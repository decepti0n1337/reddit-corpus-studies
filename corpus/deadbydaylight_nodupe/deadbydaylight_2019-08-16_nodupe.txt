Flair checks out
---
---
---
Rancor is awesome and worth it. It allows you to see where everyone is anytime a gen is completed.  Then, when all gens are powered, you can one hit down the obsession and Miri (kill) them. (Downside is the obsession sees you when a gen is completed)
---
its worth noting that the quickest method to exit the dream world, is to fail a skillcheck, so they are actually semi relevant.
---
I see what u did there DAUBENY
---
It would he way more effective if they didn't stay by hooked survivors as a cannibal with insidious
---
If only it were that simple!
---
I wouldnt say garbage...
---

---
But Mr. Boring As Hell
---
Guys, i have an idea, Tier 3 noed will instantly kill whichever survivor you hit with it! POGCHAMP!!!
---
Ahh. Ok. 
---
Pretty good job (and I mean it non-sarcastically)
---
With them adding in Skins for Licensed killers, there is a lot to pull from for Freddy. Hopefully they can add in something like this from some of the movies (like the Robotic one from New Nightmare)
---
So you are trying to compare a game with NO unlockable advantages(overwatch without perks) against a game WITH unlockable advantages(DBD with perks). In DBD you INVEST TIME (and BP) to get SPECIFIC PERKS and ADD-ONS. How would you feel to get all that taken away just because someone already picked that survivor??
---
Really? Legion? They collectively killed one guy and Susie's hand was forced. My neighbor here in Florida has a higher kill count thanks to Castle Doctrine. Legion at best belongs in survivor side.
---
i don't?
---
I had a really good Michael. Killed my team and nearly gave me the hatch (he closed it after dropping my body near it) messaged him and we played swf after. 
---
It was a pretty good match. After he killed my teamnwe played some tag lol.
---
I had a good huntress match and they added me after i axe'd them a few good times. We still enjoy killing each other from time to time
---
I think I'll just buy Spirit and the next two, personally
---
Was it near the basement on the game? I get stuck on a pallet there all the time.
---
That's why you don't just play one survivor
---
No because that sort of use of SWF is exactly why its a problem.
---
Actually one of the better concepts I've seen. This actually feels like a very unique idea I could see Behavior implementing that would have a lot of fun gameplay angles for you to play with.
---
#Power
---
Very fun and intuitive, with a lot of unique gameplay to make them feel different to play and to play against! I love powers that can be used in unique and interesting ways but can also be countered by the Survivors, especially when that "counter" can be used to the Killer's benefit. I think at a base level you could just use the power as "Freddy on steroids" to quickly move between corners of the map, but the potential for mindgames is incredibly strong with this power. It combines Freddy and Trapper in a very unique way that I think would be very fun to play.
---
##Addons
---
###Brown
---
* The increased lunge distance addons risk being OP but kinda feel weak as is. One thing for sure is that they'd be rather unfun overall. I'd suggest scrapping this idea.
---
###Yellow
---
* Hunter's Lineage is a bit too strong for a Yellow-tier addon. Feel like it should be Green at least.
---
###Green
---
* Ruler's Lineage should be Purple tier I feel. Needs testing but an on-hit Clown effect risks being OP.
---
* Dishonoured Crest is a very cool addon that could allow for a lot of interesting plays! Does risk being OP though (Prayer Beads) and should maybe be rarer.
---
* Alloyed Armor is a bit too strong, primarily because of the movement speed increase. That could be removed while the other effects could be retained to keep a "Carburetor Tuning Guide"-esque effect.
---
###Purple
---
* Destroyed Rosary would be hard to indicate when its "active" in game, but the effect is really cool!
---
###Pink
---
* Tattered Banner is really interesting but risks being OP in combination with certain perks / addons.
---
* Ultimate Sacrifice is WAY too strong. Losing one suit of armour is (ironically) not nearly enough of a sacrifice for giving Survivors No Mither after hooking them. This in essence lets you play Plague with Freddy's teleport. This is way too strong.
---
Other than that all the addons seem fine. :)
---
#Perks
---
**Keen Awareness** - A little weak and I think it could be buffed to Whispers range (32, 40, 48) The only "killer items" that would really be interacted with beyond Killer-specific items (Trapper / Hag traps, Freddy / Pig boxes, Zealot Armor, etc.) would be Totems, since people rarely sabotage nowadays. I think this is a worse totem defence perk than the likes of Thrill of the Hunt or Haunted Grounds but for the sake of Killer with intractable objects this could be very strong on them.
---
**Deus Volt** - Fucking hilarious, and has the potential to be good on a lot of Killers. The immediate Killer to think of is Doctor who can get a literal global Terror Radius with the right combination of addons. I do like how this doesn't favour instadown Killers like Infectious Fright does. A solid low B tier / high C tier perk.
---
**Crusader** - Interesting for a late game build and better than most "make Bloodlust not shit" perks. Can be good on chase Killers or for Killers who like to contest pallets instead of breaking them. With that being said I think making "Fired Up but for movement speed" is rather unfun design. I would perhaps rework this into Spirit Fury for Bloodlust, where after breaking (X) amount of pallets you don't lose Bloodlust after breaking one.
---
#Overall
---
Solid 9/10! Could use some rebalances here and there but the core concepts are great and look like it would be a very fun and unique Killer to play both as and against!
---
Billy &amp; nurse optimal
---
Any other killer- viable except legion &gt;_&lt;
---
Jk some good legion may make it work
---
Can confirm. Did that with character portraits, add-ons, items, perks, everything before I realized you can just do that.
---
I don‚Äôt mean it that way, it was super funny, the fact you know what I know, so we know.
---
I'M HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM... IT'S USUALLY TO DOCTOR TOO. WHICH IS TGE ABSOLUTE WORST TO SPAWN NEXT TO KNOWING THAT HE CAN KEEP YOU USELESS FOR A MINUTE.
---
I'm sure those dudes are better than me, they do have more experience in survivor than me, but it just seemed like you took a jab at me for no real reason. It is better to do gens than heal a lot of the time, even if you are only decent at survivor. Pretty much any decent survivor would tell you this.
---
It is
---
So you say we need to play 4k hours instead of 1k hours just so we can use each perk we want?
---
Nah. He can still spam the chainsaw too much and curving make him too powerful if you get used to it. He can regularly still get 4k‚Äôs. 
---
But that depends on your definition of balance. I consider balance 2 live and 2 die.
---
The Claudette hiding in the picture
---
No, you do know you don't have to spend BP on the person you get the BP with right
---
Ooo you touch my tralala
---
oh my bing bing bong
---
Maybe we could get together and repair those gens. Five are faster than four.
---
If it‚Äôs not bad then why don‚Äôt you use it?
---
*Thinks of Zoe and Emrakul*
---
It could be.
---
what the fuck
---
Yeah i do know but with your logic you need to have at least 4 survivors maxed instead of 1 just in case the other 3 are already picked
---
You're right, it's not easy. You'll get better though, and the important part is you're enjoying yourself
---
As a killer, my version of farming is mostly just playing the game softly. 
---
However, if a survivor doesn't run from me, I will kill them. I'm not looking for free hooks, and I'm not handing out free escapes either.
---
What
---
Lol. Thats what it feels like when I play killer too. Wanted to hit the p3 Claudette hidding in the corner? No you wanted to hit the Meg completely AROUND THE CORNER. You know, the one you didnt even know existed.
---
Omg XD Can I steal this for my etsy? Lmao, I have something like  
---
"Keeps your table safe from the entity of condensation" but yours is just so realistic hahah
---
I run Rules No. 2 with Amanda's secret :)
---
He apparently has some sort of grudge against you. Did you loop him for a while or something? Not saying that's a reason to be the way he is, just wondering
---
APPARENTLY I AM NOT ALLOWED TO USE RUIN. I PLAYED A TRAPPER MATCH AGAINST 4 PRETTY BAD SURVIVORS WHO COULDN‚ÄôT LOOP AND IN THE END THIS ONE GUY SAID THE ONLY REASON I WON WAS BECAUSE OF RUIN AND THAT I WAS TRASH FOR USING IT, AND THAT HE ‚ÄúGOT TO RANK 1 SEVERAL TIMES PLAYING WRAITH WITHOUT RUIN‚Äù. HE THEN LEFT 3 COMMENTS ON MY STEAM PROFILE CALLING ME TRASH. I‚ÄôM SO FUCKING PISSED OFF RN
---
Billy and/or Freddy.
---
Both of them put up an insane amount of map pressure while not being brokenly op (nurse) or undertuned (Legion). Billy, even with his chainsaw charge add-ons, is still completely loopable and while fast, he can't be everywhere at once.
---
It will never be fixed. The devs made a huge deal about them "fixing" totem placement so survivors no longer spawn on top of totems. Still didn't fix the problem as you can see. So they wasted a ton of time on nothing. 
---
Just slow the game down so killers don't need Ruin. That's all they have to do but they relentlessly drag their feet when it comes to addressing this core problem.
---
Should have done dark sense and the killer version of it, they are literally the same thing.
---
I wonder if it's a coincidence that hour long 3 gen doc games exist then, since they will technically fit in his lore.
---
@ u/VladDaSocialist
---
It's oinking time. Great cosplay!
---
Yep honestly I am doing fine it‚Äôs just kinda weird hearing .....your terrible ..... really you mean I have to work at it to get better , shocking development üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
Agree. It comes down to skill and play style. That can vary by person. 
---
My mains are Hag, Freddy, and Trapper. I like traps. Adds some advance planning that I enjoy. 
---
This question also comes down to perks and addons. It‚Äôs a hard question. 
---
Myers has a great balance of snowball potential to take advantage of mistakes while also being very loopable. That‚Äôs balance of potential.
---
Fair answer
---
When I play Hag with Devour hope. Have one troll ass survivor. Build my stacks of Devour Hope. Hook one survivor then carry the troll to the hook survivor and Mori the troll as a warning. I let the hooked survivor and the remaining 2 leave the game. 
---
That is a perfect game to me.
---
Also, the music.
---
XD that's so messed up.
---
Judging by their flair, you might benefit from Calm Spirit
---
Have a good day/night  sir/ma'am.
---
I haven‚Äôt lost an offering if someone dc‚Äôs during loading? Or do you mean if the Killer dc‚Äôs mid-game?
---
me and some mates almost lost the game to someone actually using this build, don't bloody underestimate it and stay the fuck out of the killers way if he is gonna pick someone up.
---
Someone claimed ‚ÄúTake off Susie‚Äôs Mask, clean the dirt off her face, and remove the hood and she looks normal!‚Äù
---
That counts for the rest of the Legion, too.
---
Some people in the community just take the game too seriously. I've reached the point where I just go with whatever they say and move on. I just wanna have a good time, you know?
---
Sounds like you're non strategic whatsoever.
---
Weird. I just did, and this isn't the first time. A survivor left while I was the killer during the loading screen and I lost my offering again.
---
Exactly I don‚Äôt respond to trash talk I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs worth the effort to report them
---
They made this game! It's called Deaths Garden. Oh wait, you can not kill the hunter in that.
---
Man my friend doesn't understand dead hard is not a sprint burst for injured people
---
Well they stated it poorly and I wasn't sure. Thank you for being about 10iq.
---
I didn't understand the fact on s3, they went from supernatural beings who took will, to dealing with russians.
---
Girls are really leaving money on the table.
---
I'm not sure if you meant to imply that Hillbilly was a later non-licensed killer, but Hillbilly was one of the first Killers in the game.
---
Also Dead by Daylight "Kill your friends"
---
Spirit is a guessing game for survivors and a listening game for killers. If there was a bit more telegraphing of phase walking, I would agree as it would add more skill in counterplay. Even if it were as small as seeing grass or corn move (which is not happening with any killers right now)
---
Right now, though, if you don‚Äôt run iron will, spirit players can track you fairly easily.

The Nurse is not a tortured soul on the level of 'murdered by father' and 'picked apart by cannibals like a turkey dinner', she literally killed an entire insane asylum by herself
---
Is the odd bulb still useful?
---
Cleanse the totems. That's it, that's all you have to do. Am i the devil now for using Noed?
---
We gotta give it a name, it is our duty. You could say it's a calling. Sort of a call of duty!
---
Swf group. One person brings a rainbow map with glass bead and range increase addon, another brings a purple key, other two bring toolboxes. Gen rush, get all 5 gens done. Person with map finds the hatch, and sets up the beacon. All survs go there and guy uses key to open it.
---
No I meant he should be included
---
its also a pc thing also when i play killer
---
That's like saying because the game was out you can't make a major change to it because it would effect your play style. 
---
Your argument is shit, you just like having op perks and not having to give yourself a challenge
---
Ding. Ding.
---
Eyes are up here
---
I got it! Call of shooty!
---
I do use it, I just don‚Äôt use it all the time. Maybe you should reread when I said ‚Äúand my 4th perk is whatever I have on that character.‚Äù
---
I really like the concept of Nancy Drew, but it seems like it would be exploited and become OP (imagine a full SWF all team using it).
---
I'd say make it only one gen per match. Once it's done, the survivor does repairs normally. If that still ends up being too powerful, maybe make it so everybody running the perk are obsessed with the same gen (so that the first gen would get done EXTREMELY fast rather than potentially all gens being done VERY fast).
---
Bitch, this is the Fruit Ninja build.
---
Backpack.... Pfft.
---
Genius! Ship it!
---
Ah I gotcha, I didn‚Äôt know if it was like a bug or something, thanks for the explanation.
---
Huntress already has Tapp though.
---
Not when your bad T.T
---
You wrote ‚Äú4th perk that I have an whatever character‚Äù
---
Read your own comment before telling other people to read better.
---
Basically that. Devs admitted they actively make adjustments to account for the difference between the local killer and remote survivors. 
---
Looking forward to the dedicated servers so they can make it more consistent.
---
If that is what it takes to actually down ANYONE then yes
---
Hex: Teabag. 
---
Affects one survivor. Either cleanse the totem or you have to leave by the hatch.
---
Nice glad we message the parties.
---
Nah I don‚Äôt care
---
When I beat a killer I always recommend to them in Ps4 messages to Youtube 3 gen strategy and Slug build. I don't want baby killers to give up. I want them to mature.
---
"Put twitch in the name you cant expect intelligence" - jfj
---
The game is more fun swf I think. But then again I came from Dark Souls and Nioh games before Dead by Daylight.
---
Balanced landing- a perk that is basically a two in one and at certain areas on maps will make it impossible for them to be caught
---
DS-You Don't Even Have To Worry About Going Down After Being Hooked Effectively ruining killer pressure
---
Adrenaline-In An Swf gens get done fastrr than anything else, which means you will lose before you can even start with most killers
---
Overall survivors are much, much stronger than killers. 
---
Killers do not have good enough perks to stop a decent swf and it's obvious. 
---
The only argument you have made is "I want to play this character, but I can't so I will say it shouldn't be in the game" you must be the same person who quits in games like rainbow six siege when you don't get your main. 
---
P. S.   If you have put a fuck ton of time in to making out a survivor then all your other survivors should be lvl 40 so you have their teachables.
---
Nobody is going to agree that Doctor with Iron Maiden is straith god?
---
True, but I wait at the exit gates sometimes to allow the killer a last hit for extra points. Also, the longer the game (up to 10 minutes) the more experience points you get.
---
Seems like you don't need tips
---
So who gonna tell him thats not how tbag works?
---
*confused elephant noises*
---
Felt really bad once I figured it out lmao
---
My answer depends 100% on whether or not they're holding a flashlight.
---
The only time I ever 3 gen someone is when they do it to themselves. 
---
Seriously I never pay attention until theres 1 or 2 gens left to do for them. And I go oh well you guys made this easy.  I'll still lose somehow and let all 4 escape tho
---
I definitely agree with you on that. I feel that "solos" is the true survivor experience.
---
I have a bunch of friends who play as well and I'll sometimes duo with one but most the time we all just get together and play KYF
---
Thanks!!
---
At least you got the vid and report. Should be an easy ban there.
---
lets start a petition
---
I remember that like wtf he clearly wasnt
---
Please find me and put me into the dying state and Mori me
---
In my case: for the longest time, because my computer was complete potato.
---
i swear to god if this links to hentai
---
Well I didn‚Äôt know that. Im still inexperienced.
---
That sounds like a really good perk. Slows down the game without being unreasonable. Great idea!
---
Lol, naw, just tweet at them or something. No need to do mob stuff.
---
Now a cosplay of you swinging and hitting him while he's on the other side of the pallet
---
Then again, we already got Tapp. Think a sheriff might be just too similar.
---
maybe unactivated armor can have no collision
---
the fuck are the first two
---
I have been looking for reasons to scrap that perk honestly. Another month or less, and I may as well. I've been needing extra room, since I love using empathy, and have not yet used bond 3. 
---
Spine chill- u do feel naked without it/ specially on solo games. I really just hate being the 1st to be targeted so I run it. Plus my headpones lacks volume :/  (cheap headphones on console)
---
I took it off, and it did feel overwhelming.
---
Yup, it feels like Killers stomping it shut have priority over Survivors jumping in, which is nice.
---
Wow that‚Äôs really good. The game honestly has big lore potential, at least i think so.
---
do people even read perk's description before posting on reddit? yeah, your teammates need to die if you want the perk to actually function
---
That‚Äôs odd, because in [my clip](https://xboxclips.com/bop%20vendor/2f8a3d30-e636-4ad4-8b81-afbc12793b38/embed), the only sound you get is her walking over dirt. Maybe it‚Äôs only corn that makes noise when she phases through it.
---
If you do it, make sure you are facing the exit so the hit knocks you out of the gate. Otherwise it they knock you down you could be picked up. 
---
Enjoy the game. It is in a much better place than it was years ago. Just try to have fun with it.
---
Cant dribble DS anymore.
---
So you are saying all killers are easy?
---
see this happens a lot to me, as a killer main! i've learned to accept this as it is!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
except when the survivor that was teabagging me the whole game escapes
---
that's when the PC goes through the drywall
---
No t-bagging isn‚Äôt toxic,
---
I read it. But it doesn‚Äôt clearly say they have to die first. It could have had your aura hid then get stronger
---
Anyone that puts 'Tunnel me' as there name is asking to be tunneled
---
I've watched this at least 5 times this is just so insanely satisfying to me
---

I mean sure, but that‚Äôs nothing to brag about. 
---
‚ÄúLook guys, he‚Äôs only incredibly boring, not broken anymore :D‚Äù
---
I hunt them down, tunnel them and slaughter them like the pigs they are.
---
Just give them literally the same mechanic like the killer, they can only body block for 500ms and then you pass through them
---
I know but I just can‚Äôt that iridescent chaser. It‚Äôs so frustrating because that‚Äôs all I have to do to get all achievements!
---
I have never had a grasp of the Spirit's power, so she always throws me off

Survivors are just trying to escape

I'll never get tired of this meme

---
It works with grass too. Didn‚Äôt try the bamboo. 
---
It is pretty quiet and you do need to be close. If it is in your clip, it might be too far to hear or overridden by the open gate sound.
---
Not that it matters too much.
---
The sound is too quiet to really hear in a chase (where you are on the other side of a loop) with the music going and the heartbeat. 
---
I hope that it is a bug not to see the objects move. Otherwise it doesn‚Äôt make sense to hear the different sounds. It is happening with all killers, now. 
---
I am pretty sure that was not the case a while ago.  I could try and download a build from a year or so ago to test that (or search for some old YouTube videos), but that really doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. 
---
Either the devs fix it or it stays as is.
---
I play both sides, that way I always end up on top
---
Well the pancho for ghostface removes the little strips on his back soooooooooo
---
It does, but technically only because the killer is host. They have a ping advantage in the sense that they have 0 ping.  
---
Dedicated servers will make it more so that if you both hit it at the EXACT same time, whoever has the lowest ping will win.  
---
It's actually gonna be a HUGE thing for killers to get use to, cause they've had it so good with 0 ping for years now.
---
Putting the trash in its place

Beuno‚Äôs dias fuckboy
---
Thank you
---
When I first mentioned you going down fast that was sorta a joke lol. You took it to heart. Anyway I agree with not healing depending on the killer skill level and number of gens. I never heal with 2 or less gens left because I run adrenaline. You should always heal vs spirit however.
---
Bannable offence btw, but I don't know how fast people get banned on console.
---
I used to prefer empathy too, but after memeing one time and running bond, damn it's so much better. I'd say the only exception is if you're trying to follow chases to flashlight save in which empathy will allow you to see who is being chased.
---
Hope the Killer killed them and let Ash live.
---
If ur in Xbox msg u about how trash , fat and a virgin u are üòÇ
---
Absolutely. But they need to implement this into the game first before it is actually like this.

I was expecting haunted grounds

It is implemented

too bad

I thought that was in game for a sec üòÖ

These streamers are incredibly useful as well, believe it or not. I like being able to see myself play from a different perspective, and they're basically a free watch replay button. It's a good learning tool, I get someone else's commentary, and if they're turbo salty I get to have a laugh about it too. It's just a win-win situation. There's always a chance they're a decent stream, too.
---
I'd never try to give streamers a bad experience just because they advertise themselves. That's just rude.
---
Hahaha that's the way to do it.
---
Uhhhgnn I keep trying to sneak up on survivors but my dummy thicc ass-clapper keeps bing bonging and alerting them
---
yes but you not only have to have the prek but you have to find 1 out of the 4 surviors on the map that balances it with the fact that if you miss the hit you lose you're speed 120 is bl2 so if any killer was perma blood lust 2 it would be crazy
---
I remember reading a fanfic where the Huntress realized she was killing innocent people only for them to come back later, endlessly torturing them, so she decided to drop her weapons and be friendly. Survivors were skeptical at first, before warming up to her, and the Entity was displeased from the get-go until it realized that the Huntress being friendly gave the survivors hope again, which they were basically out of, so instead of torturing the Huntress and rarely calling upon her when she didn't kill it actually put her in more frequently to bring the survivor's hopes up so it had more to feed on.
---
Pretty sure devs stated 75% of games have swf in some form. Not necessarily a 4man but it is most likely at least a 2man squad. So... swallow that, I guess.
---
Yes some people are not good people.
---
The Blendette needs to be in her natural habitat

yeah so based off of your singular experience, which could be subject to all sorts of other factors and random chance, you're calling this entire group of people toxic. so your argument is no better than SMALL STREAMER BAD

Tell that to the baby Dwight popping those gens with ruin up
---
It doesn‚Äôt make me mad, it makes me think less of the person doing it because it‚Äôs childish. Every single game where I haven‚Äôt gotten at least a 3k, the survs sat at the gate instead of leaving to get me to watch them teabag before they leave. I just see it as a form of acceptance when they teabag and I‚Äôm about to kill them, though.
---
The weapon is only kinda racist
---
Left Behind. 
---
Perk made even more obsolete by the endgame collapse.
---
You're not saying hi you're communicating a form of disrespect to the killer.  Everybody knows this it's a question of whether or not it personally triggers the killer getting teabagged.  For me I usually laugh it off because teabaggers are often trash anyways but I totally understand why it would annoy another player.
---
Sorry I think you accidentally forget to label the flair as Shitpost

Congrats!

&gt;You gain a 7% movement speed bonus for 7 seconds after the end game collapes has started.

&gt;After unhooking yourself, the aura(s) of hooks are revealed to you within a 48 meter range for 8 seconds.

&gt;You gain a 3% healing and altruism action speed bonus for 15 seconds after the exit gates are powered.

The game considers hex skill checks and great skill checks to be the exact same thing as evidenced by Stake Out and This Is Not Happening.

Why? She tbagged cause she knew she had no chance. Thats how we can communicate. She prob wasent being toxic but every one on this subreddit just assumes this shit.

---
Nurse without add-ons is possibly my favorite killer to play against. Now with 5 or omega blink...
---
Use your traps to take people down. Quick downs are what makes you get more points. 
---
Get away from the hook quickly (after trapping) so the emblem is not reduced. 
---
Try out Make your Choice to get faster downs, but wait until after the unhook to teleport. (A time addon and a distance addon can help)
---
If you use a time addon, use it to be in two places at once in a loop. If a trap triggers, you can use it to ‚Äúpinch‚Äù the survivor. 
---
The adept achievements are harder now. Used to just be escape or 4K. If you keep having issues, they did say they were going to rework the emblems. You may need to wait until then or try to get lucky during a rank reset.

I sometimes thank you crouch, maybe thats what they were doing

This game I was lucky enough to 3 gen them. Didn‚Äôt get a hook until the 4th gen popped and I just threw up on everything and got a 4k
---
I like bright outfits, hell I occasionally run the neon lights nea outfit, but don't expect to make any sort of stealth plays.

Doesnt matter, i sacrificed 3 and one escaped, She's really fin but a Lil bit complicated

I just think anyone who puts TTV in their name has lost all faith in marketing their own brand, doesn't want to put effort in growing their channel, and just want clout.
---
buddy i have average 300mbps and usually have good ping, is it my fault when a survivor rubberbands every where when I play killer? Like I see that survivor's ping before the match and it's bad
---
It‚Äôs all in the game of course, but the DBD Gamepedia page has it all pretty well organized, I like to scroll it while I‚Äôm bored at work sometimes. :)
---
Dude I dropped a pallet on a billy clearly on the other side barely within stun range.  Dropped the pallet and got hit after he teleported to my side of the pallet.
---
When I play, on Xbox, TTV players almost insta-DC after first hit every time. It's really irritating and I cry inside when I see TTV in lobbies as killer or survivor.
---
You attacked a baby dweet? :(
---
Claudette are the actual reason headphones for killers are a must. Them and grey trenchcoat Adams.
---
Honestly (not trying to be mean) yes because me and my friend have AWESOME internet but  killers internet may not be compatible with ours which in turn makes our internet shit when we enter your ping. Dedicated servers means a lot to me
---
Did this happen to be on xbl by chance? On myers map?
---
agreed overgrown-fetus but couldn't she have pointed instead? or done the wave emote?
---
If you buy the whole DLC, you get both killer and survivor for IIRC 8 dollars instead of 10. But if you have the teachables for the survivor or if you don‚Äôt like the teachables then just buy the killer.

What about 'tunnel me daddy'?

Would we not tunnel them?

What do you mean? You can body block a survivor as killer on various places and they cant do anything about it until you hit them

People who do that when there's a known streamer in their lobby deserve it, yoh only put it if you are trying to grow and you have always it on

I tried doing that but sadly it teleported me back onto the map, nice reference to Samination though

I find DLC better so splinters stop showing up in your bloodwebs. On PC buying a killer with cells doesn't stop the splinters from appearing.

Already is now
---
Plague. To cure or not to is a preference for survivors I have learned and not everyone has the same to counter. so if you're not in a SWF which I am mostly solo queueing since... I have no friends to play DBD with, I'm usually screwed with plague.
---
True not tunneling them into the ground would help the killer, but it sucks to play with.
---
I actually spare Twitchers in the most obscure and baffling ways just to confuse them and then watch the playback.
---
"The Killer Tourist" was one of my favourites, where I play as Legion on Gideon Meat Plant and just look at all the signs and posters and not actually attack anyone.
---
Well, that‚Äôs why there is the break armor action that is quicker than the power cooldown.
---
Poor Ace XD it really sucks to have that happen to you.
---
You must have not played killer against the old decisive strike if you think it wasn‚Äôt a nerf. It was vastly better before. You could use it before even being hooked.
---
 It‚Äôs not even an anti-tunnel perk now, If I down someone who I think has DS I‚Äôll slug them, chase someone else and then come back and hook the guy, or they waste time picking him up.
---
It‚Äôs also a simple waste if the killer just goes for the unhooker anyways.
---
It relies on the killer messing up to even have an effect, and even if you get it off the stun isn‚Äôt very long at all, the few times it‚Äôs happened to me recently I‚Äôve just downed them again shortly after.
---
Abit of advice, when she does go corrupt, take some time to hide. Hiding next to finished gens is a good spot if you are sick.
---
As someone that uses OoO alot for information and leading the killer away it seems everyone expects me to play more cocky and ballsy which sucks because I'm neither of those things I just really like it as a perk.
---
But if you can use her properly, you will get an average of 3-4 kills a game. Especially with a good pair of headphones
---
Same problem very often on XO
---
Yes
---
How you do this?
---
That looks fuckin great
---
I know it‚Äôs THEIR rule, but man they should just break it at this point. Also the demogorgon is humanoid enough to not go too crazy, and it absolutely would still fit the aesthetic of this game
---
Mmmmm the problem is your teammates so play with your f also the killer cant do anything about it like uuhh? Anyway im a person who wont cleanse with Thanatophobia or without.. but uh does that have to deal with mmm ranks? Or nah
---
Why

It's so satisfying when you pull it off lol. The Doc was cool, though. We had a good laugh in messages after the game

Haha no the joke is 20k is a lot for surv

Yw brother

Now I want generators to spew a fuckton of gas/smoke as an april fools update
---
I agree with those changes but i doubt they will touch Legion at all since the already reworked him, he is no longer a problem and i dont think bhvr cares for him being trash to play as.
---
Someone had a cool idea where only 1 gun can spawn in 1 persons blood web it lasts 24 hours then it appears in another ones blood web can kill survivors and killer
---
It‚Äôs more-so to stress the mentality of the vast gap between bp gain lol 
---
Survivors make dirt so getting 20k is like hot damn wow!
---
Playing killer where you generally make more and your bonus point perk isn‚Äôt a detriment to you makes you roll in that dough. I generally get like ‚Äúoh :^\ 40k huh‚Äù when I get into my killer games.

BTW ignore my happy noise. I was not expecting to catch her in time.

swf is 50% of games. 25% of swf parties are duos. solo vs 4 man swf winrate changes are marginal at best
---
The ranking for killers is mostly judged by how the devs want you to play. Same can be said abit about survivors. Id like to see rank either removed or give it seasons with rewards and a separate playlist.

---
....im sorry...but its like the most common thing. Every time I see a Michael, its a given they have noed.
---
I don't mind it, but I also think it's just better to advertise it in pre and post game chat. Doesn't put as big of a target on your back during game, and doesn't let the killer be able to stream-snipe you and your team if they're feeling extra-toxic that day. (Especially since stream sniping is allowed in this game, sadly.)
---
I love checking out my skins after the match on the streamer's vod :D
---
Plague.
---
Thx.
---
Honestly could not give a flying fuck about streamers one way or another.
---
But it is common sense.  You make yourself stand out or paint a target on yourself people will take the opportunity to fuck with you.
---
Its childish but its life.  Sitting here pretending like you don't get it is a vain effort to appear better than yourself or the public at large so you can impress strangers on the internet. That's honestly more of a head scratcher to me then wondering why people fuck with you after you basically leave an address for people to find you.
---
Eh. Sometimes I forget I'm posting on reddit too.
---
That was legitness
---
Well question is do you have Micheal? Because if you do then there's not alot of reasons to get Ghostface as Micheal is superior in more ways then him like variety,not getting countered by OoO,Spine chill etc, while Ghostface is easily spotted and doesn't have  many builds he can do that are specific to him as his add-ons only tweak the abilities numbers and detection not make it unique although Ghostface has good mindgame potential with his ability(coming from Ghostface main). I'd say pick Spirit but you could just buy her with shards.
---
The killers are overpowered guys I swear
---
Have recruited the killer a couple of times afterwards, never another survivor though.
---
This makes no sense. Why is streaming a bad thing? Why does it at all make bad manners okay? They aren‚Äôt doing anything wrong
---
WHY MUST SO MANY PEOPLE FACE CAMP.
---
Literally what im saying.
---
I find this to be a very interesting idea and it would definitely spice up the legion gameplay, though I'm not certain if the ability to change the character on command is super balanced. Perhaps you'd have to complete a prerequisite or after a certain amount time has passed?
---
 Also, I think each character should also have different disadvantages. For example, Julie could suppress her terror radius but can't track the players while in feral frenzy.
---
All in all, I really like this idea, it makes legion gameplay varied but I don't think it makes them too op, as long as the survivors had some queues to know when the killer changed. Perhaps the mixtapes of each character could play when they're currently in the trial.
---
Its better quality than the chrome one
---
Most of my killer games come in 2 different flavors.
---
1. We're all equally skilled and I can typically get 2-3 guaranteed kills. Survivors tend to be more skittish and tend to hide more. Gens don't pop left and right within the first 3 minutes of the game. The match can be pretty balanced and It's safe to assume the survivors don't know each other. 
---
2. I get completely stomped and can barely get 1 kill. 3-4 gens are done within the first 5 minutes of the game. They're pretty good at distracting and peeling for each other. One of the guys grabs my attention then proceeds to loop me. If I forget about him and go for a different survivor, that survivor loops me while the others safely go back  to playing with the gens. Sometimes they're bold and do gens that are nearby or right besides me. When I go back and check the gen being worked on, they wait to see who gets chased and proceed the looping/gen rushing process.
---
I would say most of my games tend to fall on category 1 (60% ish). The games that fall on category 2 just seem hopeless. The coordination and flashlight spamming is way too strong. They seem to always have the advantage no matter how hard you try. I tend to assume those games are influenced by discord and people who are swf. 
---
I don't mind these games too much. I understand that you can't always win or always get 4 kills. I tend to be happy with 1-2 kills and generally always give the hatch for the remaining survivor. My last game, one of the survivors disconnected. So I hooked everyone once to get my BBQ stacks then gave them the exit. They refused the exit and just let the entity kill them. It was a very friendly and fun game. My only issue is when those supposed "swf" groups get all toxic at the end of the match. It's like okay... You're supposed to win. You're all most likely on discord and scouting information for each other.
---
Wot
---
You need to do them sooner or later, waiting just gives the killer free time to catch you.
---
That coat is great
---
Sometimes I wait till the person doing the gen right away gets caught and then I take over lol but thats true. I'm not great at chases so I'm always cautious.
---
killer cant be in 4 places at once. The common logic of "I'll wait till someone gets caught" just results in giving the killer a free hook for no reason.
---
Might not get gen rushed because of ruin.
---
I agree when you're playing survivor you should suck it up, but a few killers intentionally set up the 3 gen strat. In that case its not really the survivors fault. There's not much you can do about it.
---
Thats one way to look at it, yeah. Works a lot for me though but you right.
---
Doesn‚Äôt deja vu help enormously with this though?
---
I usually wait until someone gets chased then I start working on a generator. I do this because im not the best at chases when I start a match I kinda need to get into the groove of it
---
Special ability: spell red.
---
Especially if the killer happens to have BBQ, which should be accounted for most of the time, as anyone whos farming bloodpoints will be using it.
---
Do them. If you get caught by the killer then try your best to waste as much of their time as you can so your team can work on objectives. 
---
If you don't think you can do that, run stealth focused perks like Urban Evasion and Iron will and Calm Spirit so the killer has a harder time spotting/tracking you and learn key LOS breaks that allow you to stay close to the killer, move around, and stay undetected.
---
I'd say swap Surveillance for Bitter Murmur and I'd say switch Stridor for Nurse's until you can get it to tier 3. You should be in a lot of chases as Nurse so patrolling gens isn't gonna be much of a factor.
---
My Nurse build is: 
---
**Barbecue**, **Nurse's Calling**, **Deerstalker** and **Shadowborn**. 
---
You can also switch Deerstalker or Shadowborn for Whispers. Other perks that work on Nurse are Infectious Fright, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Make Your Choice and probably a few others. 
---
What you don't need on Nurse is Ruin, NOED, Sloppy, etc... She is strong as is. Slap as many information perks as you can and have fun.

I like how he threw her outside afterwards "git outta here!"
---
No. If a killer is setting up a 3 gen, knowing where the gens are does nothing.
---
Yeah, I think a global cue when they switch could be a good balance.  The tricky thing with it being an interaction to activate means it basically has to be something that‚Äôs easily repeatable, which for killers is basically just searching lockers.  I could see that being the case, and it would have synergy with Iron Maiden, but then you run into the issue of being unable to search lockers without going through all the other aspects, and since it‚Äôs more than just a binary choice you can‚Äôt just swap like the doctor.  You need it to be something that can be selected without too much effort, since the deck is already stacked against killers that have to waste time with that kind of interaction.
---
Wh...
---
How can the KILLER hold the game hostage? You do the gens, the game ends. You don't, it's not ending.
---
Actually, they're trying to hook them.
---
Wholly disagree, but to each their own
---
"Yo man why you gotta come into my stream just to talk shit"
---
Uhhhh you put your stream in your name soooo you're asking for it.
---
These are incredible! You should look into making different icons for DbD, so that we can use your work in the game! I'll be watching this space &lt;3
---
Me too! Although I dont hide in the shadows but I dont like getting caught so quick
---
Good tips! I love urban evasion! Helps me in a lot of situations
---
Stream sniping is as legitimate as voice chatting is, though.
---
Are you really going to tell Killers they shouldn't be allowed to have their web browser open while they play the game? Especially when you use the game's services (the display of your IGN) to tell them where to go?
---
It's not cheating or hacking, despite being an external program.
---
If you don't like being sniped, set up a broadcast delay, or don't stream. The burden is entirely on the person with .TTV in their name and no company or publisher, for any game, should take action against stream snipers when it's the streamer's fault for playing under TTV without a delay.
---
WHEN SHOULD I USE PALLETS?
---
I do totems and saves or loop killer if needed. Then after totems I do gens and saves or loop the killer
---
I did some private games with 4 other people with voice chat. One guy picked wraith and took the silent bell add-on. The point was rendered moot because he'd always announce himself over mic.
---
Same on PS4.
---
Instead of that pig's perk, maybe put on Thrilling Tremor it can help to locate who's on a gen
---
Just go the the top controversial of all time on r/art
---
Spirit in another level. Get her if u can
---
I didn't even know they can spawn right in plain sight without any other asset beside it.
---
I'M RUNNING DEVOUR HOPE ON MY MYERS FOR FUN SO MAYBE I'LL RUN INTO YOU, GET ENOUGH STACKS AND KILL YOU. (PEOPLE SEEM INTO HIS MORI AND I 100% GET IT)
---
Dlc
---
Wow your 360s are disgusting
---
I usually run either premonition or spine chill, and I'll start a gen.  
---
That said, I feel like the killer comes to the gen I'm working on more often than not (no offense, but it's probably because of people like you, op).  
---
So I will sometimes start it and sneak away to another gen.  Then it becomes my decoy generator;  the killer will break it and sometimes spend a little time looking around for a person who is no longer there.
---
Other times, I'll finish it.  Just pay close attention to whether any of your teammates took a hit (also, I pretty much always run bond these days.. it's an incredibly useful perk in my opinion).
---
That‚Äôs how you‚Äôre meant to be playing
---
Sickeningüò≠üòÇ
---
yeah, fuck us streamers for being attractive and likable enough to stream and make money on the internet! we MUST deserve to die in a video game
---
I WAS REFERRING TO WHEN PLAYERS T-BAG AFTER THROWING DOWN A PALLET OR SOME SHIT, NOT FOR THAT! I DO THAT SHIT TOO.
---
It's still not hostage taking, just a strategy you don't like. You can still try for those gens, it's just less safe than youd like and if that works for him, so be it.
---
Oh come on. Don't be obtuse. It's a shitty thing to do or take advantage of, and it's not the same thing as voice chatting in a SWF. Did you put your finger as close as you could to someone's face as a kid and then say "I'm not touching them!"? People are just trying to advertise their channel and potentially generate another source of income, but unfortunately there are jackasses who have to take advantage of every grey area. Like, how entitled or tryhard do you have to be to sit there and say "is that a ttv I see? I simply can't not look and squeeze every advantage out of it at their expense in this single trial." Can't let em have fun and stream. No sir. Not on my watch.
---
She should have a unicorn mask
---
BYE BYE KILLER WE DONT NEED YA
---
YOU NEED TO RUN FRANKLIN'S WITH TRAPPER, SUCKS THE TOXIC FUN RIGHT OUT OF 'EM.
---
I don't get sniped?? I'm not a streamer, I have shit internet. I just think it's unfair for the teammates of people who have .ttv in their name. They can easily get just as fucked over because of it.
---
You're a dickhead attention whore if you stream snipe. Can't have people advertise their start-up and try to generate an alternate source of income while also having fun on my watch. No sir. Not today.
---
Freddy is you want to ez win, Pig if you want to meme

I'd rather make sure NOED isn't here.

Why am I not surprised
---
It‚Äôs a bit annoying when the hit on the window should‚Äôve hit them, but did not and they start teabagging and flashlight clicking
---
You mean the perk that just gave you a free health state and greatly fucked the overall pacing for the already middling M1 killers?
---
I start the generator as soon as I see it. Usually I can complete or at least 2/3 of it, unless someone brings the killer towards me. If I get chased off it early by the killer, then there really hasnt been any lost progress if I didn't do much work on it.
---
what about in their profile?
---
Spawn in
---
Walk to a gen
---
Sit
---
If ruin? Still sit
---
If not ruin? Super sit 
---
Repeat until found then run 
---
Hopefully 2 gens get done before someone goes down 
---
Profit
---
Also, if you play as Ace, you are definitely tunneled. The Doctor kept chasing me, until I died. Kind of bad, but I played as Ace, so everything's figured out.
---
I played against this absolutely disgusting console Nurse with Surveillance, Pop goes the weasel, Ruin, and Discordance. It was like playing in quicksand.
---
The issue is survivors need viable secondary objectives to do other than gens.  In the end, the only thing survivors have to do is gens outside of killer interactions.  Give them more things to do that can let them impact the map state.  For example, many doors that are currently opened if you do X gen could be changed to a seperate interactable object that the survivors can do.  I know the gas station or whatever map it is where you need to do that gen to open the big garage door has that gen feel so scary because you are locked in a room with exactly 1 way out till that gen is done.  Especially if the other part of the gas station has terrible window and pallet placements where a safe exit is pretty much non-existent.  If we could open that door as something like a 20 second channeled interaction so that we could do that gen safer, it would be 20 seconds more time a gen isn't being worked on, but survivors would almost without a doubt do it just to feel the faintest bit safer.
---
Put more places and interactables in the map like this, and let killer and survivor interact with them in this way.  So a survivor may spend 20 seconds opening this door to increase the safety of an area, but the killer may just slam it shut again in 2 seconds of interaction to get back the control of that part of the map.
---
That you have NOED on billy?
---
No one, since killers already get enough bullshit on them tbagging. And the survivors will keep harassing that tbagging works that way.
---
im not calling nea a killer
---
Entity disliked that
---
NWORD
---
You didn't buy Mettle. You bought Ash. Ash is still there. His perk could have been gotten via shrine.
---
If you paid for just Mettle, then that's your own fault. Especially with how vocal everybody was about how dumb and badly designed the perk was.
---
They‚Äôre not going to listen to this because then they won‚Äôt have a reason for playing poorly except their own fault : (
---
^hey that‚Äôs what my mum said about me!
---
The perk was designed fine. It was easy to out play.
---
  
---
Now that all of Ash's perks suck ass, I've been ripped off.
---
Infantry belt. Even at that, it‚Äôs still a 3 hatchet maximum for how many she can carry at once.
---
The point was more-so the fact she can insta-down him with either an M1 or a hatchet.
---
Did you even look at the publicly available statistics? Lol this is not even close to correct
---
You can‚Äôt report for that type of body blocking.
---
The devs have even spoke on this subject, survivors body blocking a hook while you are carrying one to that hook is a not against the rules and they won‚Äôt ban for it.  It is different when survivors do it to other survivors, or when killers do it to hold a game hostage. 
---
This has the full list of things they won‚Äôt ban you for, for future reference:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system
---
Other things they don‚Äôt ban for are gen tapping, hook camping, tunneling.
---
Just because someone is tbagging doesn't mean they're not toxic. He knew he was being toxic. Alot of people (even me) are used to hatch standoffs. He just forgot they fixed that.
---
Because if you camp and tunnel your way to 4 kills somehow you don't deserve a pip.  How you get your kills matters which is why they changed it.  I personally have never once had an issue pipping off a 4K.  Kill them off with multiple hooks each and it's stupid easy to pip.

Don't want to hear any complaining about gen rushing then
---
I have the same rule
---
Telling the killer he was eliminating 1 opponent. 
---
Telling the jungler he camped top.
---
Telling the spetsnaz he was defending B.
---
Telling the Zerg they rushed.
---
Telling the soccer team they kept passing
---
__________________________
---
Sucks for you but it worked.
---
Many survivors have set the tbagging=toxic standard. I just try to use pointing, "follow", and head nod. Anytime I see a tbag, it 9/10 results in a DC, sacrifice, or mori if available.
---
Tunnel snakes rule
---
yay! you've got this!
---
Not rare at all. It‚Äôs what they do when you‚Äôre the last survivor alive 8/10 games or if they are just hook camping jerks. I see it a lot cause I usually spectate matches after death or it‚Äôs happening to me. 
---
But teabagging only annoys me when they wait at the exit gates to do it or after every single pallet like....what are you doing? If your all at the exit gate just leave. If I know they are all there I just walk away and break pallets or look for hatch so I can close it when they leave for those extra points.
---
A bit complicated imo.
---
After being unhooked within 16 meters of range of the killer, you gain the endurance status effect for 10 seconds.
---
I got self-borrowed-time
---
Just break the pallets and keep chasing them, if that doesn‚Äôt work then you should probably switch to another killer that‚Äôs more viable at higher ranks
---
Everyone knows that tbagging=toxic. It's the standard. It wouldn't be like that if survivors wernt toxic and tbagged. You have 2 (4 if head nod and head shake) emotes, tbagging was not the appropriate one if she wanted hatch.
---
Looked like you just had a major spike. It goes from no one to everyone in a split second
---
Lag switching is when the fucker is clear across the map and the fucker teleports behind you
---
I‚Äôm not an amazing killer I‚Äôm Lowkey pretty shit but I‚Äôd suggest looking at some videos like mind games for looping. I‚Äôve seen some good rank 1 wraith mains crush pallet loopers so hop on YouTube and take a look at some of those videos.
---
They will
---
I got yelled at for a "4k mentality" because they grouped up and I slugged one to get the other
---
I don't get why someone would watch someone else play  a game they can play.
---
What‚Äôs more complicated than the doctor or plague changing stances/power modes?
---
Telling the opponent they spammed the same move. 
---
They figure that you should be able to have a well-rounded match, ex for killer: preventing gen completion for several minutes at the beginning of the match, maximizing chase and hits, using the killer ability as best as possible, and maximizing hooks (getting as close to 12 hooks as possible); ex for survivor: doing as many gens/totems as possible, being able to put up long chases, altruistic actions such as healing and protection, getting as many unhooks as possible, and avoiding being downed a lot. Remember, most of the devs play at a rank of around 12-10, where matches last a longer time than matches at rank 20 or rank 1. To them, it‚Äôs very possible to do those things. Because they can, for the most part, have games like this, they believe it should be possible at every rank (and it is, if you play correctly, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get it every time; you‚Äôre not meant to win them all).
---
Tell me more, never heared of that part of the lore. Kinda imagined it tho
---
Editing and brutal strength
---
SHIT JUST GOT REAL!!!
---
Yeah but some are lazy, and I do walk by it more often than not
---
Dwight you should be in the closet
---
Catch 22. If you don't run ruin you are going to get gen rushed. If you do run ruin you'll still get gen rushed, but statistically it'll still buy you a little bit more time. I've been running pop with ruin since pop got buffed to pretty alright results. I basically run ruin, pop, enduring and brutal on any killer that isn't nurse or spirit and it seems to be pretty average in red ranks.
---
Cool
---
Have my down vote
---
Bring it on
---
Yeah I'm going to need to watch some good wraith guides. I understand he isn't quite "meta" but meh, I try and make him work lol!
---
Pretty much. The extent of my perks is limited to the Hillbilly perks and Thrill of the Hunt and Unrelenting, which both seem useless on a Killer with a strong ability. Enduring it is. Time to disrespect the Pallet.
---
The RNG for Totem spawns are frustrating, but your games will fly by even more so without it. Good luck
---
This is where I‚Äôm just confused at because I legit didn‚Äôt camp nor tunnel at all the entire game, I mean obviously in the times where there is an injured guy and a healthy guy running ima go for the weakest one but otherwise, I hooked everyone but one 3 times in the latest 4K no pip game. It‚Äôs getting super ridiculous.
---
Survivor mains have so many rules about how killers are meant to play. Imagine if Killers said the same kind of shit. ‚ÄúIf we kick a gen you have to leave it and go to another one until it‚Äôs finished regressing‚Äù. 
---
I think the problem is that anyone who just plays one side will always have a broken perspective on the game.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
Thing is, in dbd the objective is to kill all 4 survivors. If a killer tunnels 1 survivor, all of the generators will be repaired and 3 will escape.
---
Resulting in a boring-ass match where 1/5 people are unable to have fun
---
Hey man play who u wanna play I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get it
---
Don‚Äôt bother with those people. Mad cuz bad.
---
Enduring.
---
Don't think about the games in terms of winning or losing. As a survivor you can get loads of BP and rank up quite easily even without surviving most of the time. 
---
I would hold off on playing killer until you unlock hag so you can get ruin as a teachable otherwise your games will be wildly inconsistent.
---
Also, playing as survivor a bunch will help you be a better killer.
---
Cleanse totems or play safe in endgame.
---
I started running haunted instead of ruin. gets me the early game pressure i need to play without ruin
---
It's screen peaking in a game of hide and seek.
---
Bubba best boi
---
I had a game as Myers last week on Temple map. I was doing my initial scan of the gens and happened upon a survivor by ruin totem near the killers hut in the far corner. Hooked him and noticed another survivor nearby so I attacked them too and hooked them. The entire team came over and they all eventually got away after a scuffle. 
---
I am still in the same corner by the Killers hut with ruin nearby in front of a tree. I noticed that I had 3 gens all nearby in a triangle with Ruin right in the middle of the triangle. I was like ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô I‚Äôm not giving this spot up and stayed their the rest of the game. 
---
Yes it was a slow game and yes I won, and yes I did indeed get a salty message from one survivor at the end of the game but that was just too good of positioning to give up. To me it was a change of pace from the hectic chase of all the other games and I enjoyed it. I can definitely see why a survivor would be salty but I don‚Äôt really care. Like I told the survivor. A unique opportunity presented itself and I took advantage to do something different. 
---
:)
---
Oh ok carry on with the begging
---
I would love to have a knight killer. I was thinking a wanted a castle map, where you are in an old medieval castle, another indoors map.
---
Nurse is very hard to learn and you won‚Äôt do very well until you learn them, learning them is worth it though because a good nurse is probably the best killer in the game
---
Probably on par with the effort put into that taxidermy
---
I just really like the way he slowly emerges from the shadow.
---
fucking pieces of shit
---
the double standards in this game for toxic survivors and toxic survivors
---
maximum heal speed increase is 100% (We'll make it)
---
DEADASS
---
Why meesa here? What harkness scale?
---
If bullshit window hits stop, it would be one of the biggest nerfs they can get.
---
Then when the gens are done and we die to NOED, you'll be to blame. I always have us escape doing what I do.
---
You must be getting gen rushed or camping to get 9 to 10 hooks without pipping lol. I've had 2k games where I am an emblem away from double pipping in red ranks.
---
But I did do my objective though, the game should be centered around doing my objective, killing the survivors. Not ‚ÄúAh shit, if I just kill him right here I‚Äôm not going to pip, lemme just let this guy use me as a doormat for 5 minutes and then kill him so I can make sure I got the Chaser emblem requirements. Survivors‚Äô goal should be orientated toward escape, not always requiring to escape, but partake in events to ensure the survival of their team if they need to be a sacrifice. The killer player is solo, thus needs to play centered on his/her objective KILLING. He/she doesn‚Äôt need to be helping others or performing actions to better the chances his/her team has because they‚Äôre their own team and they have one goal, kill as many as they can. I performed that goal going above and beyond securing four kills and I get punished because I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt kill them correctly‚Äù yet I hooked each but one 3 times. That match I lost ruin within 30 seconds, and still managed to play properly enough to get a 4K but it‚Äôs not a win in the devs eyes
---
bing bong boobies
---
Go try it in kyf, it's been a thing since before ash came out.
---
Yes, let rank 20 get destroyed by rank 1 billy, it will make more people want to play the game. They totally not gonna uninstall the game after the match.
---
I always start on a genny the second I see one because honestly me running around aimlessly gets me caught / in a chase faster than getting on a genny. Often it‚Äôs nice to get on a genny with someone at the start to also see if the killer has discordance
---
For the most part wraith is an M1 killer so you have to loop the way any m1 killer would, I suggest watching good killers on YouTube and seeing how they do that
---
Additionally with wraith, because of the invis movement speed you can try and get to the pallet or window first to bodyblock the survivors, or do the pig mindgame where u uncloak at the middle of the loop/pallet and 50/50 on which side you swing on, they have to pick a direction to run and because of the speed boost you get coming out you can catch them on certain small loops
---
As for perks bamboozle is good for countering loops and you could always run enduring/spirit fury combo
---
That‚Äôs how it works, you need all iridescent
---
Lol you don't need anything more than anecdotal evidence, if they piss you off then that's enough evidence. What do you want an angry small streamer montage? Honestly. You sound like you've never played killer against them.
---
&gt;Proximity to hooked Survivior. 
---
._. let that speak for itself ig.
---
Survivors are not idiots and actually coordinates in red ranks. Killer: " Is this a toxic swf?".
---
I stopped using Ruin at red ranks for exactly those reasons. I've been doing alright with Pop and/or Corrupt Intervention.
---
This, all day this. If I played a good game, I‚Äôm not sacrificing points to be ‚Äúnice‚Äù or show any kind of sympathy. I‚Äôm completely against any form of toxicity, but people doing that has only caused survivors to think they are entitled to the hatch if they are the last ones standing
---
All that work to get to purple rank. 
---
Wasted
---
I've always found putting .ttv or whatever else indicating that you are a steamer as a bit pathetic and desperate. At best you'll get one or two people to look you up, but mostly you're attracting people who either will stream snipe you or focus on you / screw you over.
---
Yea and it‚Äôs shitty
---
Good luck learning her
---
likely around 40-45. if you are grinding for the prestige you shouldn't be entering the trial without items/offerings used. add ons are more flexible that i save for later, but no reason to run self care if you have a med kit available. by the time im 50 / 1,000,000 i still have some items/offerings available.
---
4% isn't that much. Shhhhh.
---
Nurse, her hitbox is ridiculously crazy
---
You can still dc I‚Äôm dedicated servers lol
---
Camping is literally ur best bet if ur trying to preserve a kill while the gates are open. $50 says these guys would be staring a blendette dead in the eyes on struggle if the gates were open and they had no kills.
---
I had completely stomped a team with my Ghostface, only to get a message saying what‚Äôs the point if you‚Äôre not even gonna try stalking. ‚ÄúI never saw my bar rise‚Äù was his wording
---
But if a survivor hides the entire game, doesn‚Äôt do any gens, waits until everyone is dead, and escapes through hatch, then that‚Äôs ok for Adept?
---
It completely negated his points for "Surviviors found"
---
Her booty doesn‚Äôt fit next to that metal bar
---
If you continue working on the gen after not hitting the skill check no progression goes up for a few seconds is it‚Äôs like a ‚Äútimer‚Äù if you will.
---
WHAT DOES TUNNELING MEAN?
---
I never said it was okay. In fact I'd be happy to see more requirements for a Survivior adept. 
---
But at the same time. Let's admire the reason that emblem wasn't gold. Bc that, my friend, is a -4% you could have changed.
---
Only on Nurse's native map.  A map that has both some of the absolute best spawns, and absolute worst ones.  With no in between.
---
It use to be just get a 4K but that was too easy
---
they're gonna start punishing it pretty hard, like you dc too much you basically have a scaling time penalty so you can't just do it always and you have to take your lumps
---
I'm bring OoO.
---
gen tapping is bad m‚Äôk but its done to avoid the skill checks. However it just slows the game down and increases the repair time
---
4K on hooks only, no moris, but getting survivor adept is still easier before the adept killer change
---
most mid-high players dont waste time healing against legion because his power is so easy to land.
---
i use lullaby if your pressure is good it works wonders
---
That's not how it works. Pip system is still garbage anyways. Ghostface is a stealth killer, so his chase is always garbage. Same is true for Meyers, Wraith, Trapper using traps well, good Spirits. All generally have poor chase scores unless the killer intentionally chases for longer periods of time.
---
Ruin doesn't have to last entire game, it have to last until you get your first hook, to not get 3 gens done before you catch first survivor. When you get the ball rolling, it's all pressure from where, as survivors have to scramble.
---
They do it because while they are not making any progress in the gen they can still get another skillcheck and regress the gen more.
---
Killers do the same shit, what are you talking about lmao. "Don't run these perks! Don't bring a flashlight/medkit/toolbox! Don't try to get my attention! Don't play certain survivors/cosmetics! Don't use teamwork!"

You don‚Äôt like it = Never? Ok bud. Also I‚Äôm pretty sure the devs said the entity can take any creature from any timeline (past or future) and saying it will never be added because it will ruin the ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù is silly. Also, money talks, so yeah.

This is Lawbringer. A possessed suit of armor, and the armor even looks similar to his.

Okay! Thank you for the suggestions! Those are quite helpful. I've always struggled with mindgames so your advice helps quite a bit.

a montage wouldn't prove it either, did you read my comment? saying you don't need more than anecdotal evidence is also ridiculous, because then following that logic you could justify being racist too. ex: "I've met 5 black people, 4 of them were bad people, therefore most black people are horrible people"

The only difference here is that racism is generally a worse problem, and has a history, but it's the same thought process

Thats what slugging is for commrade üòé

It'll scale higher than that I'm sure.

That's ultimately why I switched to Wraith lol I was playing spirit because she is "high tier" but I just wasn't having much fun as her.
---
the DbD devs talking about wraith at red ranks.
---
The Dbd devs showing off trappers win rate at decent level.
---
The Dbd devs showing ghostface win rate at high level.
---
The dbd devs talking about clown at any level where survivors can hit skillchecks.
---
The Dbd devs when pig exists.
---
Yeah I feel that. I love playing ghost face.
---
You need to get chased to get better at the game. It's the only mechanic with separate noobs from pros in this game. So don't be afraid to get chased and killed, watch what you did wrong, watch few YouTube videos of tru3, when he is getting chased he explains his thinking process, and try to recreate it in your games. 
---
Most people will hate you, when they are being downed and see you crouching in a corner doing nothing.
---
When are we going to eat Grandma?
---
Tru3talent is a really good person to watch, he‚Äôs helped me immensely
---
this game is rough, so dont get discouraged
---
Only time I use it is on Hag cause I still haven't gotten adept
---
finally got to 8
---
it's a good meme tho :3 if you need help with gimp/want ps message me uwu
---
&gt;That you have NOED at all
---
Actually the score reads as negative for you even if for example they hook swarm you. So if you hit someone near the hook it gives you negative score. Kinda busted tbh.
---
Walking around the hooked survivor to check for any hiding survivors, just passing by them to get to the other side of the map, chasing a survivor that just so happens to pass by the hooked survivors, lots of factors I can‚Äôt really do.
---
ok so I'm new and the hight amount of bp i get is 32k as david king. how the hell do I get 90k as a killer?
---
Because I'm one of the few losers that still enjoys using it. I follow quite a few blogs that post content I enjoy so.... yeah. Still using it. Lol
---
Thanks, I guess?

Currently rank 6 rocking No Mither since reset. Fear me or tunnel me either way I have a cool hat.

---
But the gens aren‚Äôt gonna be done because we have an immersed Claudette just doing totems and when she not doing totems, she‚Äôs just hiding in a bush (aka her home) waiting for the gens to be done
---
Everyone wants you to drop ruin so that those 20 seconds you had ruin up could‚Äôve just been 25% on 4 different gens before you find the first into 3 gens popping at first down. Even if my ruin wasted that one survivor 10 seconds and those 3 survivors 10 seconds not getting easy progress on gens it‚Äôs a win in my book. Pop goes the weasel and sloppy butcher slow the game down enough afterwards to hold the fort down.
---
No, I assume it‚Äôs because they consider looking for the totem, but change their minds and go back to their gen
---
Then how is it I do 2-3 totems, 2 gens, and help the others escape?
---
I would Love it if they added Freddy's Power glove from  Nightmare on Elm Street 6/ Freddy's Dead. Like it could light up and make beeping sounds every time you whacked a survivor.
---
Thank you this was very helpful (:
---
once i played survivor someone farmed my friend while i was waiting until said teammate would leave (the killer was following him). My friend was able to leave after getting farmed and i just teabagged on the antimate and left instead of healing him. later i farmed him and the killer was tunneling him. he tried to make the killer follow me by pointing in my direction with a flashlight but the killer still wanted him. karma finally did something good uwu
---
I switched to corrupt intervention and like it more than Ruin. 
---
I was deranking for rank reset (I play casually and deranking pre-reset prevents me from having to deal with red rank 4-man's with instaheals and purple flashlights. By the time I rank up to my normal rank the red ranks are back in red ranks and I don't have to suffer) and was doing the [Don't Wake The Beast](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/92kzyu/dont_wake_the_beast/?st=jzdn6yiz&amp;sh=815bf52b) meme build, and 9/10 times out of 10 my totem was being touched before i could reach it or survivors were right next to it as I reached it. I even had it cleansed before I could walk over to it a few times.
---
Without a doubt the totem spawns need to be shaken up or better hidden (or the logic for which totem is the hex) because they do get cleansed super fast. 
---
Either run Corrupt Intervention which is MUCH more "Reliable" than Ruin (Always lasts 2 minutes I believe) or run NOED to punish survivors for "GenRushing" although I've had NOED fucking cleansed because survivors were doing a DULL TOTEM and it turned to NOED at the last second or all 5 dulls get cleansed. Survivors will bitch at you for running it but if they're allowed to run whatever perks they want, you're allowed to do the same.
---
Perk bbq&amp;chili can boost it by 100%.
---
With a party streamer or other bp offerings you can get high amounts.
---
I ain‚Äôt fw no tombstone at gates I‚Äôm out that bitch
---
But the rank 15 wraith who got destroyed by the 3 red ranks with their rank 20 isn't gonna quit after playing the game for just a few days?
---
‚Äú2-3 totems‚Äùyou do know five spawn per game right? You cleansing 2-3 isn‚Äôt getting rid of noed
---
pretty much, as soon as I hook the last survivor or the exit gates are open I just start spamming my dream snares
---
And they'll get what's coming to them for trying!
---
Yeah! I've watched him before but never studied how he played, I'm sure he would be very helpful.
---
actually, you know what? you're right. I'll use my anecdotal data then, i actually have checked out most small streamers i play against and they were neutral or really nice. That makes me right now right? since what i experienced proves how all of them are?
---
Because Dwights a pedophile and I want that pigtail Meg!
---
but Trapper is my daddy cause i hear the roar of a big machine, hot metal and metherdine
---
I think the safe rescues should add bonus BP'S. Too many hook bombs, where I get saved by some flashy (clothes) player , just 2 get smacked in the head again.  Leading to instant death before I am able to do anything else.
---
Yeah it sucks in those scenarios where there‚Äôs literally nothing the last survivor can do sometimes. I usually just let them open one of the gates in that scenario when I‚Äôm the killer. They should try their best to make it so it‚Äôs always fair to the killer and the survivor so there‚Äôs some sort of play they can make at least, instead of the gates being so close together it‚Äôs just gg.
---
Take Enduring and never respect pallets ever again
---
I agree, I never see killers actually complaining about "gen rushing." Gens literally just get done too fast sometimes for the killer to actually be able to do anything about it, but thats not the fault of survivors. Gens are survs objective, killing is killers objective. I really dont understand the people who play this game.
---
That's just being a bad player. Most of all the community will hate you for that. 
---
Anyways play the way you like, but that's probably the main reason killers get tbagged. Survivors Confronted with a killer that has a shitty playstyle leads to all survivors thinking that killers are all the same, and deserving of tbags.
---
I only got it because a spirit felt bad
---
Teamwork. That's it
---
If you put ttv in your name you're shameless
---
Dwights a pedophile, we can hook him and pick up the killer as an honorary survivor!
---
Little reddit saplings sometimes forget the downvote button is not a disagree button.
---
I've seen this a few times, does that actually work?! I can't imagine people running up when there's a camping cannibal, just do the gens. That cannibal is sacrificing map pressure for one kill.
---
By far the best Pig cosplay I‚Äôve seen. Looks straight out of the game ü§òüèª
---
I just played about 6 matches and tried both the killer and the survivor. I am very pleased thus far. The matches go much quicker than I thought they would. I'm having fun so far. I will say that being the killer is way more difficult than I thought it would be though.
---
Doin gens, you?
---
3 years aka gens
---
I had a huntress hold the game captive once it was a 40 minute trial. she had her huntress lullaby TOTH and 4 gens all around the collapsed mineshaft. once she got her huntress stacks she squatted pretty hard. She still hooked you if she managed to down you until a guy just sucided when he got his 2nd hook. after that we were slugged, at one point all 3 of us were slugged, but she wasn't done with us so she'd drop/pick up so we wouldn't bleed out, but would chase you off gens/totems.
---
We finally did break through with a final of 1 sacrifice 1 bleed out and 2 escape. Wasn't even that relieved escaping, just felt tired/hollow.
---
3 gears like for gens
---
Well each represents their objective in my opinion like killers are well killing people and the gears represents teamwork because they all are together working for a common goal and for them it's generators and leaving

like a wall mounted thingy or how do you envision it? :)
---
I haven't had that, though there was one time...
---
So another game I play is "Deathcount". I hook everyone twice and then inatead of killing them I slug them and count it as 1 death. Esentially "I could have killed you but didn't". 
---
There was a streamer, a Legacy Claudette with a flashlight and teabagger... I was playing Nurse. Oh man, he was so salty. Everyone else in the game "died" about twice and one of them 3 times. Him? 7. He died 7 times. 
---
He then proceeds to call me bad at the game and a loser and what have you. Here's the best part. He plays Nurse the next game during his stream to show how much better he is than me.
---
He got a 2K. I "killed" everyone an average of 2 times and killed him 7 times and he couldn't even muster up a proper 4K.
---
That was my most toxic experience with a streamer (not counting the time I got stuck with AngryPug while I was playing Survivor) and I hold that memory dear to my heart ‚ù§.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night. Rank 13 is low.

Yea killer queue times are great but survivor queue times have been ass today

Because protecting yourself is your responsibility. [The Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/) people are assholes on the internet. If you dont want to deal with assholes, then you have to protect yourself, you can't rely on people not being assholes.
---
Do you play both sides? I recommend trying that to get a balanced view on how salty the both sides get. There's probably more whining survivors just based on how there's 4 times more of them in a match but the salt is there on both sides. 
---
You yourself said in this thread that you facecamp flashlight users as if that isn't just as pathetic as crying for not getting a hatch etc.
---
I'm rank 1, streamers know me by name, played since beta...
---
Trust me you know a SWF when you see one
---
Perhaps an addon that makes him slower every time a trap catches someone, but the survivor can‚Äôt escape the trap without help? The rarer the addon, the closer he gets to normal speed would be a good idea too?
---
To simplify my idea for a (new) addon tHaT doesn‚Äôt remove others
---
Survivor gets trapped, can‚Äôt escape without help of other survivors, but Trapper is slowed. The rarer the addon, the less slow trapper is.
---
yeah on xbox one get into one in less than a sec and this is at 12 when I was on around 8 it took longer
---
And this is the exact reason why I left red ranks. I sit in purple ranks man, where I can play any killer I want and experiment with fun builds, and the best part is I don't have to worry. I'm stress free and don't have to sweat my ass off. 
---
It's really nice and I highly reccomend it, because red ranks is an absolute miserable place to be, for both sides.
---
My favorite small streamer is ItsGhostbusters, because hes a really cool guy and weve become somewhat of friends. Hes decent at the game but he plays to have fun, not win. He doesn't rage quit or anything like that. And when he gets on with other streamers sometimes he's "toxic" in the playing to win sense, but he doesn't play scummy. I enjoy playing with him too.
---
It‚Äôs actually a fan designed possessed armor suit for a character called Varesh from a game called Battlerite. I gave credit to the artist in my explanation post.
---
If the killer is purposely setting up a 3 gen strat (protecting 3 gens from the very start) knowing where they are won't help much as the killer is just hard patrolling them. Deja Vu helps against survivors accidentally 3 genning themselves.
---
Yeah, I play more SWF than I do killer. We do fine against killers. Playing survivor is probably why when I kill that one flashlight player I let the rest live. I'm not crying, I'm accepting the flashlight player as tribute to save their friends.
---
At least you‚Äôre immune to NOED lol
---
Also works for Wraith but yay, Bubba love!
---
I do that so the killer gets their points and I can move on to the next game.
---
we saw that aswell, thought it was some addon, but only 1 trap appeared
---
I feel you are just worrying too much about winning have fun, experiment like try bad killers to mix it up like Pig or doctor, it doesn't matter that they aren't top tier all killers are good if you try and get good at them he'll if you don't feel like switching try meme builds like heavy smoker nurse or speed limiter hillbilly and only go for chainsaws just try variety I don't run meta perks and I'm fine. You are too comfortable with the killers you're playing now that's why everyone feels non viable also so just stop yourself from playing them and only use other killers.
---
if it isnt your first time hitting red ranks why does it matter to you if you‚Äôre red rank? play other killers and dont worry about getting 4ks all the time lol. i stop caring about running sweaty builds all the time once i realized literally no one cares about what rank you are so just play for fun and try every once in awhile when you feel like it. dbz doesnt even have a leaderboard, pretty much nothing to work towards each season. lastly, no one is good at a killer when they dont practice. i guarantee you werent wiping whole teams with nurse when you first started using her. practice with the other killers and have fun, its ok if a survivor or two gets out every now and again.
---
DragonOnCoke and Made with KINEMASTER
---
Yeah I noticed as well. Though the survivor times aren‚Äôt any better. Even here on Playstation.
---
Nah, I was watching my boyfriend play today and he got downed as the exit gates were opening so a Feng Min body blocked the Michael allowing him to wiggle free and escape. She had already done this previously for him as well after blinding the Meyers. It‚Äôs a good play on survivors part and it‚Äôs not a bannable/reportable offense because the killer can avoid it by successfully hitting the body blocker. 
---
Bodyblocking a survivor into a corner and just watching them as others do generators or if they are the last survivor left is holding the game hostage. Reportable. 
---
Bodyblocking your fellow survivors into a corner and not allowing them to move while crows fly over your heads is also holding the game hostage/griefing. Reportable.
---
ohhhhh looks amazing!! üòç great work!!
---
Honestly been enjoying running small game. it can be worth is running it for a couple days and you'll pick up on most spawn points fast.
---
A survivor had this happen to them and I couldn't see it. I guess only survivors see this kinda stuff
---
And if a killer doesn‚Äôt have noed or your teammates don‚Äôt cleanse dull totems? You waste precious gen time on things that are totally based off chance
---
This is neat and all but reading this ability and addons I have to say...
---
Congrats you made the weakest killer in the history of dbdl... like his ability is Map presence that CAN BE BROKEN BY SURVIVORS....
---
And your addons suggest that hes gunna be using this in chase... WUT TF?
---
You basically made a shitty m1 killer with useless addons and an ability that gives him WORSE THAN FREDDY map presence until they're broken by survivors...
---
Cool look, cool sounding.... dog shit ability design. Fun to think about though
---
DONT LET THE TOXIC SWF GROUPS RUIN YOUR FUN. BUBBA CAN BE A FUN KILLER TO PLAY ONCE YOU KNOW HIS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION AND IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THE KILLERS YOU ARE ALREADY GOOD AT THEN MORE POWER TO YOU. I JUST WANT TO OFFER SOME SUPPORT AS A FELLOW KILLER MAIN.

---
Near addon idea but his addons are good enough I just buffed his KIT so hes no reliant on iridescent head to get a 2k at high ranks on a mid range map.
---
Thanks man I didnt expect as much love for my less typical ideas for reworks.
---
They really have to fix wglf. 4 unhooks is just too much work while when you play killer you just get them anyways. Maybe they should add that healing someone would give you a Token
---
He was specifically chasing me. And then chasing me after I got unhooked.
---
?
---
I wasn't even an obsession.
---
Thanks alot,say a survivor is level one how much bloodpoints would that be?
---
Thanks
---
It's gotta be wraith lol
---
Bodyblocking in general is reportable. Says so in game.
---
The killer, not sure of his name. I feel as though if you can turn invisible then your movement speed should be slowed down. Just a noobs Rage Rant lol
---
Ah, I play a lot of swf so I forget about not being able to communicate. They should vc for survivors, at least proximity chat!
---
If it‚Äôs wraith then you can still see him lol, plus he cant hit while invis
---
Can‚Äôt say I agree with you, but I appreciate your opinion on this thought project :)
---
If you pay clise attention you can see his outline when he's moving around while cloaked. It's Like fighting cloaked elites from halo if you've ever played that before.
---
Does Freddy's stun noise make your heart melt like a sweet oink?
---
Yes &gt; What's wrong with you?
---
No &gt; Buy Miss Piggy
---
I don't think i've ever been betrayed by a killer once they decide to farm.  There was a time a LG killed another survivor but I think they didn't realize it was their last hook cause they didn't do it again.
---
It's not reportable as long as it's not indefinite, like in his last two examples? The devs have said it's not reportable. There are evening scoring events related to body blocking.
---
I WENT TO DROP A SURVIVOR IN FRONT OF ANOTHER SURVIVOR SO I COULD MORI THEM AND HAD CARRIED THEM TOO LONG SO WHEN I WENT TO SET THEM DOWN THEY RAN OFF INSTEAD. I HAD TO MORI PEDOPHILE DWIGHT INSTEAD!
---
It's cool but having stationary points around the map serve you no point in a chase...
---
And the fact they can be destroyed makes them bad map presence aswell...
---
No chase, poor mobility, poor at finding survivors... it's worse than old freddy
---
Lmfao. I saw the thumbnail and said to myself " I already know where this is going."
---
He was only attacking me until I was sacrificed.
---
yikes. that‚Äôs all
---
Seems about right
---
&gt;drops victim
---
This 100%. It's important you down the victim before going after the farmer so that the farmer doesn't get their safe unhook points. I wish more people did this.
---
I love seeing a survivor POV of me playing killer. I always check if they‚Äôre online after the match and watch the VOD.
---
Trust me, you'll get used to him, learn how to loop and abuse him, then eventually laugh at him while he cries because you broke his mental.
---
Why does it matter what you call it?
---
[proof](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system)
---
Or moried
---
YT, HD or .TV? Hippity hoppity, the hook is your property.
---
That's the best
---
This is absolutely...killer...work. I love how accurate it looks, and the little detail of your positioning of your fingers adds that extra creep factor that I  L O V E.
---
I've never once seen someone with TTV actually streaming when I checked their profile l0l
---
I haven't
---
If you fuck the gen spacing the only thing you need to do if a killer finds you is TO RUN TO THE OTHER FUCKING SIDE OF THE MAP, and repeat  
---
those guys were idiots
---
Wait I thought adept was just use the three perks that come with the character and get a 4k or survive
---
You‚Äôre the real MVP.
---
This is me 100% as I‚Äôm running around looking for and chasing survivors. I always be spamming it haha forget strategic placement, just do it while looping. Get the points AND cancel loops on the spot
---
Honestly getting 100k bp from one game is so amazing
---
I'm always up for helping people get better. If you're not toxic in post game chat, I'll give you pointers, if you're toxic I'll just report and move on.
---
No way. That would make him even worse than he already is.
---
I unhooked myself and jumped into the hatch once. Against a Nurse. I don‚Äôt ever think I‚Äôll be that lucky again. I wish I‚Äôd been recording.
---
‚ÄúTiresome but kinda fun‚Äù describes Legion at their best
---
I'm not sure how much this'll help out, but a minor thing you can do is try to watch the top of the corn stalks to see them bend, or rustle around. It might be hard to do on legion because they're kinda short, but on taller killers like Plague or the saw brothers it might help
---
I‚Äôve been accused of being SWF when I was playing solo. I‚Äôm assuming these killers never play survivor because it‚Äôs extremely easy to communicate without voice if the others know what they‚Äôre doing and you‚Äôre using certain perks.
---
Well then..... that was actually slightly beautiful. Love the comments on that thread
---
Dude no offense but Wraith is mid tier at best in the hands of a good player, just need to be more aware of surroundings.  You can see a faint outline when he's cloaked.
---
Don't rub it it'll only make it worse! Gently swab it with a moist towelette.
---
I do this because one you can get another skill check while the progress is stopped and if I'm on a gen with some one else it shows I was the potato who missed the skill check lol
---
Nice :3 
---
Me with my best friend tried nurse + someone. I mean someone because I was in common stuff, and she just stabbing me with her (real...) saw. 
---
It was fun. 
---
How much photo have you taken, before good ones came?
---
I don‚Äôt think so, because if u have a good headphones just turn the volume on whenever u have mother daughter ring on and trust me u will never need scratch marks + with surveillance discordance or thrill of the hunt u can grab them pretty easily .
---
I run breed with the ring / ruin to slow the game down Just a little bit/ surveillance/thrill  of the hunt/ 4th perl irrelevant (nurses or sloppy butcher)  and believe me that shit is so nasty and opü§Ø
---
I dunno. Ill check back in 3 days when i let all the rank 1s turned rank 10 get back to their normal rank while i sit comfortably at 12
---
There was an update which made you required to kill everyone with a 2 pip
---
that's exactly why I hate the community sometimes, ttv gets to show me exactly how much more toxic they are out of chat.
---
Not to mention like you said, .ttv players are easily the most toxic I've ever met, in a variety of different ways and levels. I used to be excited to see them, especially in other games, but now I do honestly tunnel them because 1. I feel ashamed for them when they spam their link in either chat, and their entire name is that. and 2.) they are obnoxiously toxic, and end up having superiority complexes from my own **PERSONAL EXPERIENCE**.
---
That just happened to a ash on my team 30 minutes ago... feels bad man :(
---
MID TIER?
---
he's second worst!
---
Never use unrelenting. Its a perk that only works if you miss your target. Missing is inevitable but so are pallet stuns and the recovery you get from enduring is way better and more commonly useful
---
That change would hurt literally no one, and that's why bhvr won't do it
---
More like 720
---
Hey don‚Äôt bring doctor into this! He may not be the beet killer, but he‚Äôs annoying as fuck and that has to count for something, right?
---
Welp no more adepts for me
---
I found a YouTube stream by searching them up on YouTube while waiting for the game to start and low and behold they were in my lobby. Was fun getting to watch it back after the match and seeing what they saw.
---
I think 7 seconds base is fair with a max of 15 seconds base if they disarm and give you max stacks... this is increased by addons to a max of 19 seconds....
---
This makes traps an objective if he gets his stacks.
---
The pallet break shit could be made to stack with brutal but a max of 45% pallet break speed is pretty sauce... if its gunna stack with brutal I needa made it a stackable 5% to a max of 20%.
---
Which is fair....
---
I will not back down on the injured survivors being put into dying state on a trap, this mainly, assists trapper in situations where he wants to slug to chase someone else when an injured survivor hes chasing steps into a trap...
---
Owch a real saw blade. It was a 30 min session so there was alot of multiple of the same pick. The hardest part was explaining to are camera person the shots we wanted cause they had never played the game before.
---
Well if you were actually talking shit, then you‚Äôre the one in the wrong. You can‚Äôt do bad things and say it‚Äôs okay just because someone made themselves an easier target
---
My butt cheeks were clenching the whole time; what a great escape!
---
1 million bloodpoints gets the survivor to about 30-37 depending on what you spend it on
---
I couldn't stop laughing unaware if he was going to let me live or not? He killed me, but that made my day.
---
What was she like before her buff, and when was it? I took a break from dbd for a while so maybe I missed it?
---
That shit hurted
---
It's your close mind that's preventing u from having fun. I have shit games often, but I don't let that ruin my fun
---
Got a source?
---
Not saying it isn't true mind you I just love lore stuff and want to read it myself.
---
If 4 alive, have to do all 5 gens for hatch to open or just spawn?
---
Then we'll just break los and you're screwed.
---
Nope. I'd never use Legion if not for her lol.
---
Can you actually check video content half an hour earlier in an ongoing stream?
---
Sounds like you've been playing against JenDenise a lot...
---
STOP DISCONNECTING THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE DOWNED OR HOOKED! PLAY THE DAMN GAME!
---
Yea exactly! U want to be the god basically
---
You posted something on reddit, expect people hating.
---
This hurt my brain
---
Owieüòû
---
Why are you booing me? I'm right.
---
No, it uses to be a 4k but then the description didn't match because a 4k used to be merciless, so rather than try to get achievement descriptions fixed through console processes, they just changed the trigger.
---
If difficulty was the decider, survivor would be a double pip too
---
I almost play Survivor exclusively and I think that slugging is a valid strategy. Puts a ton of pressure on survivors to heal teammates quickly and eases the killer concern on gen pops.
---
Because there is no ranking system as of now, this shit doesn't work at all lol. Hopefully the one they add "soon" is going to be better.
---
lol imagine camping someone for using a item in the game.
---
Bad killers like Pig??? I happen to do very well with Pig lol. You are right though. Just try to have fun. Killer will get plenty of blood points. Have fun messing with them. If you get kills good. If not do dumb shit to laugh at. Any killer can be fun if you play to have fun.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Devious AF. You can be so creative on this game.
---
Entity, ya dang goofed
---
Now you‚Äôre free
---
Yea its not a bad idea but we both know this is gunna have 0 impact to the devs and their trapper changes anyway... soooooo ye
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
---
This. They already "fixed" him, so he's not getting ANY attention anytime soon, same with Trapper and Wraith, they got "fixed" so no further work will be done on them, maybe ever, but let's hope it's only for a few months
---
Really nice idea.
---
Do you know at what level were you able to unlock it on the bloodweb?
---
Thats why I don‚Äôt understand some killers, if this is happening to me I‚Äôll drop the survivor then go wild and when they spread out I hook them.
---
I use the locker jockey build on Adam but instead of hope or adrenaline I use deliverance since I'm usually not the first person to go down
---
I‚Äôm still wandering, how do you pull of of moris before downing
---
Dude this is fucking awesome
---
That could of been me because I remember that happening to me as Freddy. Who knows?
---
I guess?
---
Pop Goes The Weasel and BBQ will be your best friend forever, never even used Ruin because I leveled Clown first and I don‚Äôt regret it.
---
I know your right, but a small piece of me likes to hope that they read a lot of this and maybe it gives them ideas of their own.
---
I know, my mom says I'm funny too.
---
Spirit for sure. Without a doubt. No objections.
---
I'm not saying  pigs horrible just below average which well bad I guess.
---
TTV in name
---
- what you ask for: "hey check out my stream"
---
- what you don't ask for: "hey stream snipe me"
---
Wearing revealing clothes:
---
- what you ask for: either nothing or "hey check this out"
---
- What you don't ask for: "hey objectify and harass me"
---
You are right, it is indeed a rough comparison, stretched a lot.
---
Nevertheless, I don't think anyone is *asking* to be stream-sniped because of trying to advertise their channel. I'm sick of people blaming the victim (even if it's just in an online game).
---
Sooo many people use that nick
---
Yet in all those situations the opponent had a chance. When your tunneled you have little to no chance to escape.
---
1. If you go in a locker the killer is forced to pick you up so you will use ds.
---
2. If you know the killer has a mori, if you get tunneled after the unhook going in a locker also saves you from the Mori.
---
3. If the killer "slug my ass" that means that he doesn't hook me so my game will be longer which means more chance to survive.
---
4. Maybe I will die anyways but if I get tunneled I want the killer to waste the biggest possible amount of time so I will make the rest of my team escape.
---
I remember being terrified when that opened on my first Skyrim walkthrough
---
Not a bad idea, kind of similar to an idea I poster a while back. I like the idea of cutting grind and actually making prestige worth something.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cjusl4/reason_to_prestige_and_cut_grind_idea/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I would actually wear that
---
hatch only opens on its own when there's one survivor left
---
Well it mostly depends on how you like to play. I, for example, like to play BBQ&amp;Chili / Enduring / Spirit Fury / Tinkerer. This way I can know when survivors are almost done doing a gen and sneak up on them, down them quite quickly and hook them and then I go to another person with BBQ but the chase usually doesn't last long as I don't respect pallets: Enduring and Spirit Fury give me that possibility. But you could also play some "Bastard slugging Bubba" with KO / Third Seal / Haunted Grounds / Franklin's demise. There's also classic anti gen tactic: Thanatophobia / Ruin / Overcharge / Tinkerer. Or you could go for a sweet sweet basement bubba lol, it really depends on how you wish to play
---
Imagine protecting your kill on a hook and survivors complaining about it. If a killer is camping you should be punishing him by doing all the gens.
---
this is rly pretty i love it
---
Hell yeah bring in the Terminator, Xenomorph, Predator, a huge spider and William Birkin fourth form.
---
You can run spine  chill to tell you when shes looking at you!
---
Don‚Äôt worry you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Some people get salty about NOED but don‚Äôt feel the need to stop running it. It‚Äôs a good perk so people get mad
---
Why do you think mad grit perk exists?
---
I actually never tried the perk, it's something the playerbase commonly agreed upon ever since I started playing, so I never tried.
---
The reason it's so low is because you only get use out of this perk when you fail. It's not like it gives you a negative effect, but basically every othdr perk is a better pick than unrelenting
---
I think at this point you gotta just play with the perks you got and see what comes of it.. You might surprise yourself
---
Who are you to decide weather or not a killer deserves a kill? For that elitist mentality, I hope you get tunneled and camped!
---
why do insta heals and keys exist, they're so op and most of the time the survivor doesn't even deserve to escape
---
I saw a survivor about to farm someone on the hook even though I was walking towards the runner. I wanted to punish him for farming, hit him in the back, but no, the survivor on the other side get hit.
---
I would Mori you for that!
---
My Cannibal goes BBQ&amp;C/SpiritFury/Bamboozle(coz Bubba is slowest around windows)/(Discordance, Whisper or Bitter Murmer for tracking Survs)
---
I like your hex idea.
---
Do your gens and be happy! There are survivors out there who don't have gens, you should be appreciative!
---
You‚Äôre a liar I do not associate with this man
---
Doesn't mean you need to call anyone out,  just adding fuel to the fire
---
My thoughts exactly
---
New to the community, can someone please explain what tunneling is. Not really clear on all the terminology
---
Epic
---
Walter
---
Be like that scene in Dirty Harry when the pimp pours drain cleaner down that woman's throat, except replace the pimp with Nea and the ho with the wraith
---
By that logic the pig shouldn't be  a killer because she's from a horror serious but there is no slashes till the final instalment and that was Hoffmen . Why say some horror ar ok bit others arny personally I'd love to see a xenomorph or birkin first form.
---
To quote a smart, amazing and beautiful man.... "Just do bones!"
---
It's literally the counter to NOED. Unlike adrenalin which has no discernable counter that I can think of....
---
Except NOED.... 
---
Shit.
---
Do whatever you want! Killer dictates the game. You want to scumbag it and run noed, hex ruin, haunted ground, bbq. That's your choice. The devs are on your side. I like to turn people in to backpacks with iron grip, aggitation, and the legion perk!
---
It‚Äôs so much of a problem that Killer see swf where there is none.
---
That fool thinks camping is bannable, the devs even said you cant be vanned for camping, btw I'm not calling you the fool SirBaronBonBoozle
---
u/VladDaSocialist
---
I'd still prefer Distressing Doctor
---
As far as I know they have a data sheet for April, shown above to be about 50% for that month of April, other than that these "publicly available" statistics are only their dev streams. 1 of which, I believe last October stream stated about 70% swf. Which 70% in October, 50% in April. Don't know what it is now but I wouldnt be surprised if it went down. People are more likely to stop playing reducing swf's than a swf group to start playing.
---
But please share a link to some more recent publicly available statistics. I don't want a "lol this is not even close to correct" Give me a statistic from the devs that shows 60% completely solo games or more. Please I would like to know the truth.
---
I couldn‚Äôt understand his point through his example.. Did he think adding the Nurse was revolutionary or something? 
---
-The nurse is a female
---
-Females are human 
---
-Just ties into what I said with ‚Äúall the killers were/are human‚Äù
---
-?????
---
Yes those are also op and most of the time annoying
---
How the survivors feel after a round with the clown lmao
---
&gt;replace the pimp with Nea
---
Soo... No change?
---
Yeah just salty because it happened to me recently
---
Mmm. Yeah can't wait to try that. Plan on getting that particular killer soon.
---
Then you can't complain about noed. That's like a killer saying 'I'm not kicking gens when I should be hooking survivours'.
---
not as pathetic as this post
---
It only gets revealed that they have it after they get someone and if that someone is you then you‚Äôre out of luck and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs annoying
---
This makes me have mixed feelings =)(
---
And it‚Äôs one thing to compare in about it but another thing entirely to insult me because You only got one gen done even though your whole team has 4 max rank perks while I only have my one hank 1 perk
---
the last killer i played with let me finish the last gen and then opened the gate for me because i was the last survivor :)
---
Honestly Decisive Strike doesn't really counter tunneling.
---
Like maybe if you're not the best at the looping, but most people who are really good at looping only go down once they've exhausted the pallets in the area.
---
Meaning they Decisive Strike right into a dead zone that they can't escape before the Killer is not stunned and catches back up.
---
So there are four types of Decisive Strike.
---
1: Those who get downed because they're bad and get caught when the Killer returns to check the unhook, without being tunneled, and get to DS because they're bad at running for the 30-40 seconds left on their DS timer.
---
2: Those who are legitimately tunneled or camped.
---
3: Those who get unlucky at a loop or are even legitimately mindgamed at one.
---
4: Those people who either intentionally get caught, or are intentionally farmed.
---
1, 3, and 4 are not fair towards the Killer who is not camping or proxying, because the Survivor is only getting DS off because they either messed up a loop and got caught when they shouldn't have been, or because they got farmed by another Survivor (which isn't the Killer's fault and they should not be hit with DS for it).
---
&gt; 32k - perfect game (4 iridescent) 
---
4 iridescent doesn\`t mean you get 32k BPs. Rank and BPs are 2 seperate things.
---
&gt; ~~128k - perfect game, 4 stacks of bbq, 100% offering (streamers, cake)~~ 
---
32k (perfect game) + 32k (bbq 4 stacks) + 32k (100% offering) = 96k (+ 32k = 128k during x2 event) (+ 64k = 160k during a x3 event)
---
Max bloodpoints you can get is 32k + 32k (bbq) + 160k (5 BPS) = 224k (+ 32k = 256k during x2 event) (+ 64k = 288k during a x3 event)
---
With your calculation it would be (32k + 32k) \* 2\* 2\* 2\* 2\* 2) (5 BPS each double the amount) = 2048k bloodpoints (don\`t even start with events...)
---
It should be obvious that you can\`t get 2m BP in a single game
---
If you can‚Äôt handle a Wraith, I‚Äôd hate to see what happens when you go against a Nurse or Spirit
---
Spirit is a  blast to play Survivors like to yell at you a lot for playing her but she‚Äôs just so damn fun
---
Bond = pocket SWF
---
Prove me wrong
---
Confirmed, nerf bond
---
You can buy shards and if you play enough you‚Äôll get a lot of blood points
---
Fun fact: if you can't emote at all in the game you have the glitch!
---
Clearing dull Totems offers survivors largely nothing other than clearing a perk that may or may not be there. Most survivors aren't going to clear them because they waste time when they could be doing generators. 
---
Also there is a clear divide between NoED and Adrenaline. Adrenaline is rewarded at the end of the match to survivors who did their jobs well enough to get through 5 gens without dying. It is a survivors goal to make it to that point, thus a full health state is their reward for doing so.  NoED, however, is given to the killer for failing at their objective of killing 4 survivors effectively enough to get them before the 5th gen pops. The killer is rewarded with bonus movement and an exposed status for losing. You cannot honestly say the two are reasonably comparable.
---
When the game has many different perks that are meant to support the killer and survivor in a slugging situation, you're doing alright. It's just frustrating to deal with random people like that. If I could, I'd give you a jar to keep the salt in for when people get upset.
---
Gotta love a killer with a built in camping ability! Doesn't even need to be on the same side of the map to camp :)
---
And here we see why Dead Hard is an amazing perk
---
No
---
I would‚Äôve blew up her gen before darting off
---
Yup. Just go to their ‚Äúvideos‚Äù and the most recent should be their current stream. Might not work if they have VOD‚Äôs disabled.
---
It'll scale up to a week eventually
---
Just a little bit
---
It really is shitluck, but it doesn't always proc. You almost know when someone has it. If it's negated, then that's 1 less perk you have to worry about the whole game. I'm cautious when I see someone get 1 hit.
---
Right. I use this logic all the time. I cleanse ones I pass by and then mentally map all the dulls I cleansed so IF NOED spawns I already know which areas of the map to ignore for it.
---
Its both of your connections,  if your connection to the killer has a massive spike you'll experience the lag but he won't, of course he'll be met with the bs that is a teleporting survivors.
---
I like how it is different from the one perk that does the same thing but it allows people who were working on a gen beforehand still work on them but that gen is outlined for the killer.
---
1.Either i should go to bed cus I've lost my sanity
---
2.You should get sleep cus you've lost your sanity
---
Or 3. Enderman and Steve confirmed for next Chapter
---
Yeah me too, still an op perk that shouldn‚Äôt exist though, the killer doesn‚Äôt deserve it because the killer only gets to use it after they fail at keeping the gens from being done, so the survivors are punished for winning
---
That's why i am leaving lobbies when i see someone with .ttv because i know i will play 3v1
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Yeah, do bones, like those idiots told you to do. Do bones at red ranks vs good killer that will take advantage of every single second you waste. Do bones whitout knowing if your mates will do them(if they are red ranks they probably won't). Do them. Listen to those rank 20 scums.
---
Big brain time
---
Ew not Steve. Broke ugly ass man. Make it Alex! Ginger queen üòç
---
Yeah maybe I should just waste time and cause my teammates and I to die because the killer may or may not be using a certain perk among many others
---
[deleted]
---
Theres nothing wrong with being bad at a video game. Just dont blame it on the game.
---
I do this with Hag as her traps as well.
---
no one cares
---
Forget the old statistics, just click the survivors profile in lobby a check out their friends list. Additionally, I'm certain the higher the rank the increased % it's atleast a 2 man SWF
---
It's the same as with Legion right? Deviousness not Hunter for those fat stacks of bp if pudding isn't available?
---
The best part is when after you hook a survivor, you go out of your way to go for a different survivor, then the original survivor just waltzes right into your path.
---
Me too, I thought for sure people would understand but I guess not, thank you though for understanding
---
They should put voice in game so you can hear when the survivors talk to each other
---
Most of her mind games just consist of standing still. Doesn‚Äôt take much time to learn lol
---
I still watch them from time to time
---
I‚Äôd rather not waste a lot of time to stop something that might or might not happen
---
The only point to playing Wraith is getting those sweet sweet bing bongs.
---
Using an add on that gets rid of the bing bing just seems pointless.
---
Certain perks will boost your BP gain, David King has a perk called We're Gonna Live Forever where unhooking people or protecting someone from a bit gives you tokens, each token giving an additional 25% BP, up to 100%. If you have a good game with this ability you might have 15-25k bloodpoints then doubled in the post game. A lot of people also have a character for farming bloodpoints to drain into other characters rather than spreading it around, so they can get teachable perks from certain killers/survivors to help get more points
---
Some youtubers get all DLC's for free so they don't use shards on the shrine. And trust me if you play 10 hours straight in a day you can get 9k shards in a day. And those youtubers and streamers probably played dbd for 2000+ hours.
---
Yeah, shame. Its either they try to be the designated distraction or just have the deemed toxic perks and items
---
I didn‚Äôt know they got all for free
---
Distressing can help Legion find more survivors while using Feral Frenzy, but Distressing is primarily situational when it comes to the terror radius increase, however, I try to run it as often as possible because of the Deviousness BP increase. I run any Deviousness point increasing offerings I can for the most part, so if pudding or other general bp increasing offerings aren't available, run Deviousness offerings, it's what I do.
---
Of course, I dedicate myself to point gain, and not to rank increase, so I've been levelling Doc for the perks, and before I prestige him I'm going to start dumping points into Leatherface for BBQ&amp;C, then when I prestige Doc, I can start getting BBQ&amp;C, I won't care if survivors escape or not as long as I get a boatload of BP during the match, which is the primary reason I play at all.
---
Fr considering I‚Äôm a Quentin main too...
---
Damm, I remembered when survivors were able to bring memento mori to the trial!
---
The best is that the killer could kill by its own hands.
---
I‚Äôd rather not waste my time and possibly get my team and I killed for something that I don‚Äôt even know for sure is there
---
again that damn logic right?
---
It‚Äôs Dwight‚Äôs perk ‚Äòbond‚Äô it allows you to see other survivors within 20 meters
---
So you drag the folder into the Icons folder?
---
Equally frustrating is when it's a Killer with an instant-down.
---
I had a Feng farm me right off the hook against a Leatherface tonight.
---
Leatherface not only said it was better and easier to down me despite having a chainsaw that could instant-down the Feng.
---
That is, the Leatherface thought that one downed+one healthy survivor was better than one downed+one injured survivor.
---
He also said in post-game that an EW3 Myers would be better off going for an injured survivor instead of a healthy survivor.
---
I wasn't even on death hook, if I was then maybe I would understand (though still be a bit annoyed) since a death hook is worth more than an injury.
---
But a Killer with an instant-down (Leatherface, Hillbilly, certain addons for Clown/Huntress, Make your Choice users, Ghostface or EW3 Myers) have little reason to tunnel when someone is unhooked right behind them, it's better to nail the healthy survivor because of the exposed status or one-shot.
---
Yet these Killers seem to tunnel the most.
---
Stacks of Save the Best for Last. Each time you hit someone, you build a "stack", reducing your cooldown after a successful attack by 5% (up to a maximum of 40%, or 8 stacks). 
---
Hitting someone in Feral Frenzy applies Deep Wound, and builds a stack of Save the Best for Last. If you hit someone with Deep Wound in Feral Frenzy then you'll be kicked out of Feral Frenzy, but you still build a stack of Save the Best for Last.
---
Normally you would build two stacks every time you face a survivor - one for the first hit, one for downing them. With Feral Frenzy, you can build three or four stacks every time - one for the first hit in Feral Frenzy, one for the second hit that takes you out of Feral Frenzy, and a third for finally downing them... or one normal hit, a Frenzy hit, another Frenzy hit, and then downing them out of Frenzy.
---
Note that the cooldown reduction only affects *successful* hits - but it does mean that when you're being crowded by survivors, or if you catch them in the middle of an unhook, you can go on a stabbing rampage and cripple/down them all before they realise what just happened.
---
Not everyone but they call them 'fog whisperers' or something and it means they get free things from bhvr to promote it.
---
Btw I liked your nickname
---
Bonus points if you make them rage
---
With Spirit I usually 4k with a safety pip. Using D. hope I only need 5 hooks and getting gens grabs mean no chase tokens. I don't care about gen profession, I *want* them on gens.
---
So you bully rank 12 killers? Congratulations.
---
I just get myself hooked and move on to the next trial at that point. 2 blinks can be juked, 3rd blink is always a free hit.
---
Late Bird is basically a much better Wake Up!.
---
I really like Decoy though, could be used for loop mindgames, making the Killer think you vaulted a window but are still on the other side.
---
A win is not a win, until you leave the gate. It's not OP, it's just bad luck. The main objective is to walk out that door. Finishing the generators is not the end of the match. That's a killers trump card. It's 4vs 1. If you gen rushed, it serves him right. 
---
As a main survivor I don't see anything wrong with it. That's what a survival game is. A survivor is not meant to feel overpowered. A killer running noed is the least problematic out of all the things killers can do to you. You ever been 1 hit by a killer not using noed. That actually feels shitty, and OP, but that's how the game is. The killer is buff or what would be the challenge of escaping playing against baby killers.
---
Some killers insta down you, like bubba or hillbilly at any given time, should they be removed too?
---
You'll probably get over it once you play more, or switch sides.
---
I agree with that last part stay well clear of that.
---
Basically, the problem I have with it is that once you complete one gen it would immediately show you where the second and repeat until all gens are completed thats pretty strong not even adding the boost into the mix
---
My ideas:
---
1.starts with all of his traps. It's ridiculous how much time you spend placing traps, let alone picking them up from the end of every maps corner. Trapper should start with all of his traps, if not at least have stitched bag as default or be able to pick up traps from lockers like huntress
---
2. His trap hit boxes need to be bigger. Soo many times a survivor just slips through your trap because of how small the hit box of the trap is
---
3. Honing stone should be baseline. Soo many times you trap a survivor across the map and they just free themselves first try and walk away scott free. If not, then there should be a base amount of times that a survivor needs to attempt escape before actually escaping
---
4. There needs to be some sort of risk for disarming traps. In a lot of matches a survivor just follows you around and disables your traps, making you a useless, powerless m1 killer (who also wasted a lot of time setting traps). I don't have any great ideas for this particularly, but ones I could think of is perhaps a 50/50 chance of getting injured after disarming a trap (kinda like bloody coil), or making it take way longer to disarm traps
---
If you'd rather not waste your time, you'd rather get slapped by NoED.
---
You can't say it's a problem while completely ignoring the counter to it.
---
Super super super late to the party but you will also see this if the Freddy uses "Pill bottle"
---
That's my exact experience, sadly. All ttv survs I played with/against were super toxic and/or salty.
---
So what should I do? waste time and likely die just to counter something that might not be there? Seems like a good idea
---
Thanks. Will keep it in mind
---
Ok, i have 1000+ hours on dbd and I'm talking about my experience, the experience of streamer I usually whatch, and my friends' opinion. I will try to give you the most exhaustive answer i can, but i sometimes struggle a little with English, so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. So, in my opinion ruin is one of the strongest killer perk, if not the strongest. But it has a problem, a very big problem: you can't totally rely on it. Ruin can last up to the entire match, and when it happens, it's a lot easier to get a 4/4, but sometimes it get cleansed at the start of the match, so you basically play with only 3 perks. It doesn't give you a standard to adapt to, and that sucks. Furthermore, ruin is so strong that it slows your improvement as killer: when you play killer, the most important thing you wanna achieve is a very strong map pressure, and ruin basically does that job itself (when it lasts a bit), so you don't learn how to properly apply pressure. And applying pressure is very difficult, because you must know when it's the moment to slug, when you must leave a surv, you have to predict surv's moves... It's a lot of stuff. Another point against ruin is that its strength is only apparent, because it will do a lot of damage only vs not-so-good survs. Vs good survs it's a lot less powerful, cause they will hit perfect skill check, and will very quickly found the hex totem, because a very experienced surv most likely knows totems spawn. So ruin basically makes easier to win vs not-so-good survs(which you would anyways probably beat if you are a good killer), and it's slightly annoying Vs good survs. So, in the end my tip is: don't use ruin, try something else and learn how to apply map pressure; you will get a lot better a lot faster. At the beginning you will struggle a bit, cause if you are a ruin user you are probably not used to apply a devastating map pressure. With all these things i said i absolutely don't want to mean that ruin is weak or useless, as i said in the beginning it is probably the strongest killer perk, but it has a lot of downsides too, so learning whitout it is definitely worth. Hope to be useful to some fog whisperer. Cya.
---
Yeah, as killer main post game chat where salty SWF tells me to kill myself or my family made me a better person for sure. When I see messages like that I'm totally full of positivity and love :)
---
Just because people dont dc doesnt mean they will suicide on hook
---
I mean they probably try to just advertise themselves but most put it because, along with their toxic behavior, they aim to annoy the killer for content. I like to stream snipe and bring a mori for TTVs.
---
He used to slow down the game so much and just made it impossible to escape from him. There was a way to cheese his ability into getting 2 or 3 hits in frenzy then moonwalk to get stunned just to get the m1 and have a down or multiple downs.
---
looks a lot like jane lol
---
Decoy is my favorite. I can see the Spirit's face after being mindgamed
---
You guys getting payed?
---
[Hell I'd Still Hit It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_4Wqm_zhIY)
---
That‚Äôs not tunneling. That‚Äôs understandable, as a survivor main those are just salty survivors. Tunneling purposefully not hitting someone in front of you because youre straight going for someone that just got unhooked. Or getting looped by a survivor and literally only going for that fool for the rest of the game
---
Where is Bubba on your list?
---
No they shouldn‚Äôt be removed because that‚Äôs the ability of the killer, they can‚Äôt do anything other than that, having a killer that can do other good things plus insta down everyone they find just because they failed at stopping the survivors from doing gens isn‚Äôt fair and panders to gameplay styles that obviously aren‚Äôt working so why should the killer be rewarded for playing badly? Gen rushing can be easily countered by patrolling gens which takes a lot less time than going out of your way to look for bones to stop something you don‚Äôt know for sure is there, it takes too long to find and do all the bones, it just isn‚Äôt worth it
---
Tantrum intesifies.
---
I personally think that his ability can turn a game into a really annoying heal fest where no one can do anything until they heal up and getting the right perks means you can literally end games in 2 or 3 minutes.
---
These are very basic and not very detailed but these are certainly the right idea... less time waste, more power usage... not bad but might not be the most efficient way to do it.
---
I'm level 13 without either of these :]
---
Is THAT what happend to her??
---
Thats a problem right there. If you increase his movement speed there needs to be a drawback. I would suggest keeping the mechanic that if you miss a swing you lose the frenzy.
---
Apprently bubba op.
---
They will die on hook. End of story. OR force quit when they see a Mori XD honestly force quitting is fun to see ngl XD I love when I‚Äôm waiting for that force quit chat and the killer is ranting away &amp; everyone is staring at their ultra rare offerings and ebony going ‚Äòwhew ty unknown force quitter‚Äô
---
I use wraith and he is my strongest killer. Running pop, overcharged, ruin and haunted.
---
Been playing solo a lot. Very rare chance of the killer having it. Some of the killers that did have it weren't much of a problem. 1 got slugged by it, every1 scrambled. When the survivor got hooked, if we decided to go save him, we destroy the  totem 1st. Then went for the save.
---
If we couldn't find the totem, the survivor that got caught, had to be sacrificed or it would be a 4 man slug. There's lots of ways around this. I've learned a lot from my experiences. It also helps if you're not wearing bright colors, and if you can end a chase quickly before getting slugged by it. 
---
With SWF, this may be more problematic since people refuse to leave when the odds are against them for 1 teammate that puts everyone at risk of getting slugged. Offcourse if you find the totem on fire, go save your teamate. If you can't, then don't take a risk you can't afford.
---
If 4 players can't end a chase right away, and all get slug, something's wrong with that team. Maybe 1 or 2 people.... but all 4. That's a teams mistake from a strategic POV
---
Tell that to the good killers who still use NOED, just because you said good killers won‚Äôt gamble on it doesn‚Äôt mean they actually won‚Äôt because surprisingly they still do
---
I play both survivor and killer, so I understand both arguements. I do agree that Adrenaline is a little strong atm but I would argue that NoED in it's current form is more unhealthy for the game. 
---
My idea for an adjustment would be to take it off a totem and make it a token style perk where you can build up to the exposed status with hooks and put it on a timer. That way the killer earns it just as much as a survivor earns Adrenaline, killers still get a decent counter to Adrenaline, and it doesn't mean end game hooks are a 4k because survivors can attempt to juke out the timer.
---
Moronic hook rescues are so awful.  I think people who do them end up never leaving their home town, still live with their mom and have ugly partners because they don't know how to do their own laundry or cook anything besides a can of Beeferoni...
---
This voice chat could be only available for survivors, so they couldn't communicate with killer. Or maybe make it so that the killer could say something, survivors could hear it, but killer couldn't hear survivors.
---
I was speaking from a survivor standpoint.
---
The goal for all the player is to entertain the Entity. Do you think it would be entertain to see a killer kill all the survivors in 2 minute? Or to see all the survivors escape without a single chase or hook? 
---
This game is designed to have both party interact with each other, so it discourage with any measure action like stealth or quick ending.
---
It can and still does happen, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, just because you talk about a strategic POV doesn‚Äôt mean that there aren‚Äôt players who still play that way and get killed for those reasons
---
Is he not free on PC. I have him for free on console, and he is by far my favourite killer. I think he is such an underrated killer. I'm rank 15 after getting the game about a week and a half ago and he is by far my favourite. He is great at end game generator defence, and stealth is out of the question when you are the final survivor looking for the hatch. And I think many people don't know that your shock stops any actions being performed, so if you shock a cocky (or stupid) survivor before they vault or drop a pallet, you can quickly get a free hit as they can't stop you.
---
I wish people would stop gunning so hard to turn anything into an excuse to tunnel. I've found some decent streamers this way, and their commentary and gameplay helps me improve. I can understand tunneling/camping/mori'ing a genuinely toxic survivor, streamer or not, but if you're the kind of killer who will outright hunt down the people with .ttv in their name without giving them a chance to show if they're toxic or not, don't use their name as an excuse - just do everyone involved a favor and admit you're just not a decent killer and don't want that streamed live.
---
And, before I get downvoted into oblivion, **that last part I specifically meant in reference to the killers who will make it their goal to track down the .ttv survivors from the very start of the game for no reason other than they have .ttv in their names. Doing this to toxic streamers is not what I'm referring to.** Yes, I have seen it happen. Yes, it's fucking ridiculous.
---
KOBE
---
Omg i figured out now that you are the same dude from the noed post. Nice to see you again

Solo is most common, and a 2 stack SWF is vastly more common than a 4 stack. 3 and 4 stacks are very low percentages, 3 stack being around 10% and 4 stack being less than 10%. So, yeah, you‚Äôre most likely playing against solo queuers or 2 stack SWF. This is last edited from May. Also, remember, survivor queue in general has been dwindling since it‚Äôs more rewarding to play killer (point gain-wise). Queue times are long for killer because of this. Additionally, I think people are enjoying the variety of killer ability and playstyle and that they see survivor gameplay is generally pretty boring. Finally, most new survivor perks aren‚Äôt very enjoyable or useful to play with, making the perk meta incredibly stagnant, therefore dulling gameplay further. 
---
So, yeah, it‚Äôs pretty unlikely that anyone is consistently playing against a 4 stack SWF. Sometimes people play better than you. Doesn‚Äôt mean anyone is bad, but no one is going to win every single game they play in any game. People just seem to take a loss much more personally in this game for some reason. This community seems way more sensitive in this area than any other competitive PVP game I have played.
---
it doesn't make sense, there are a lot of multiplayer games where you can't play one character 'cause someone else pick it.
---
Personally i prefer when everyone pick a different survivor and as a killer it allows me to not killer someone too fast 'cause i forgot which meg i already hooked twice for exemple‚Ä¶

I was speaking from a survivor standpoint.  It seems like ...from a killer standpoint ...slugging in this scenario would basically just be proactively making all the survivors suffer through an annoying game just in case one of them might be a KAREN.
---
XD
---
Really? I‚Äôll believe that when I see it XD
---
Thanks for taking out the trash
---
Oh shit this is amazing! Makes me feel so sad though, poor hag :c she didn‚Äôt deserve to be cut up by cannibals.
---
Counters
---
1. Do bones
---
2. 99 the gate
---
3. Destroy the flaming totem when it does proc
---
4. Leave your teammates on hook/ not worth the risk
---
5. Don't group up/ split
---
6.stealth- don't get spotted.
---
7. End chases fast.
---
8. Stay out the terror zone. 
---
9. Change perks so you're not at a disadvantage to it.
---
Good wraith bad wraith doesnt all of a sudden make a killer good...
---
Hell you dont here people saying oh nurse isnt S teir because there are bad nurses I see em all the time...
---
It doesnt work like that.
---
You don't go, oh wraith isnt dog shit weak cause I'm a good wraith and I can win sometimes.
---
A 4k doesnt mean a killers good just means survivors are bad...
---
If wraith is your strongest killer and the only one with good perks I cant assume you play much or at a high rank.
---
Even if your the best wraith out there, good survivors and SWF are simply gunna eat ya butt... i know you know the games I'm talking about.
---
I feel like a bloodpoint multiplayer for each colour set of ranks you're in that stacks the higher you go, plus an extra bonus of something even like shards or Cells for staying in rank 1 as an incentive to stay in it. Games will get sweatier for sure because everyone will want the rewards but maybe it can encourage people to stop smurfing?
---
Excuse my ignorance but what does BMing mean?
---
Hag. You want to grab that Hex: Ruin.
---
If the person I'm playing with is decent and doesn't sandbag then I will check them out after the match.
---
With so many counters, I don't see why it's OP. It's pretty balanced if the killer can't get it to work. Then again, you've probably been very unlucky if that's your case. Maybe switch up perks/clothes.
---
If he can't find you, you have the advantage.
---
She isnt skillbased, she is knowledgebased, have a good understanding of where survivors will go and outplay them, simple af
---
You still can 99 all hooks and then just pop them when killer is about to hook someone. And 3 minute respawn time it still really long, especially since team focused on gen rushing can do most of the gens and escape in less than 5 minutes. And let's be honest - noone uses Hangman's Trick.
---
Srry i was in a bad mood, and was pretty drunk.
---
We can be frens now :(
---
Zone control killers like trapper and hag need to play around their lack of global presence. That usually means 3 gen strategies unless you specifically run perks to improve your map pressure.
---
Yea a multiplier could be pretty good too. I just feel as if the flat rewards would be far easier to implement knowing how "BRILLIANT" the devs are at coding stuff... Personally i don't see all that many smurf accounts even in the low ranks so i don't really see it as a problem
---
Stuff still happens, just because you‚Äôre telling this to me doesn‚Äôt mean every survivor that plays will see this, a lot of people still have problems and are victims to this perk, nothing will change that until the either get rid of this perk or at least nerf this perk like they should have a long time ago
---
There are two basic tenants to playing spirit: Predict where survivors will go, and train yourself to hunt and react-by sound. Those are skills. 
---
You need to be able to predict survivor patterns and jukes since the scratch marks are delayed. That gets you in the general area. 
---
You need to be able to track by sound and have twitch reactions to attack if a particular sound is heard or you hit an invisible barrier. You need to train yourself to listen for breathing, movement, or sound of pain and quickly change course and attack. 
---
Just because you may not think there is sufficient counter-play or the skills may not take as much to learn as Nurse, does not mean they are not skills.
---
This way of thinking is way more obnoxious than a guy who‚Äôs just trying to get a viewer or two and isn‚Äôt hurting anyone
---
Always a pleasure to see the actual Saw pig mask instead of the oversided ant-eater mask in the game.
---
**Wow!**
---
He really said that but thats no reason to use it as an excuse to scare off new players
---
That looks like a very uncomfortable butt plug.
---
I recently played against twitch.tv/laughnn and oh boy was his squad mad.   
---
I was playing spirit and absolutely destroyed this squad.  I then went into their twitch said gg since I thought he left the game and they were so mad...calling me toxic and everything 
---
So I pretended to leave the stream, waited until they got another game found, and then said in chat that they got me as killer again.   
---
he rage quit.

I just don't see skilled players getting wrecked by it constantly. I've played this game for a year. Took a long break, came back, and just found out what noed is. It was never a problem before taking my break, and it still isn't. 
---
Experienced players know better.
---
I like fire trucks and moster trucks
---
They're pretty bad perks by themselves, and only really half-decent if your team helps you. And if everyone's running sabo no mither. people might go down before they can sabo. It's more of a meme build than a legit strategy
---
Mindgames. Making the killer believe you vaulted a window when you are still on the same side, deceiving the Spirit as she phase walks, misleading the Nurse's blinks...
---
Not everyone is a p3 blendette man and most people don‚Äôt use that kind of play style, what I said stands, it‚Äôs a perk that many people die to because they‚Äôre ‚Äúunlucky‚Äù or because the killer isn‚Äôt a rank 20 potato that doesn‚Äôt know how to mindgame, you telling me these things isn‚Äôt going to save an entire community from this perk
---
Thanks =D
---
I‚Äôve had plenty of TTV team mates in the past, the one that sticks out though was a female streamer (didn‚Äôt know she was female until after the game) who was in a SWF. We were vs a nurse and her SWF was fantastic at running the killer, the TTV however went down around 7 times (I started counting after the third time she got slugged) The killer didn‚Äôt hook her once despite her getting caught about 5 more times than anyone else. Eventually the rest of us got caught and killed and it was just the killer and his little slug TTV. I spectated after the game and the killer was just nodding over her body then finally picked her up and took her to the hatch. I went on her stream after (and realised she was a female streamer) and her face cam was the same size as the game. I made a comment in the end game about how I was going to start putting TTV in my name to get special treatment and the poor little white knight killer got his feelings hurt so he spouted a bunch of toxic racist shit at me and then disconnected. I thought ‚Äúwell I can‚Äôt imagine that goes with twitch TOS so there goes your chance of appearing on her stream‚Äù
---
Those aren't good Killers.
---
They're just Killers who are better than you.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, but you have to understand; there's a reason no one uses NoED once they get good at the game. It's not a good perk.
---
that's what I was referring to already...
---
That was posted earlier. That's only data for the month of April. The 1st chart shows that about 50% is solo. So 50% swf. Duo is still swf... 
---
Listen, I'm not trying to say I'm with or against the OG post it's just that there are a lot of salty players in this community. So on topics that can be argued and resolved with facts, stats and numbers I would much rather have that over here say. So when they OG post says they are not all swf that's true, not all games are or have swf, without a doubt. But it's also likely that there is some form of swf.
---
Ok I can agree with what you said, but if it's only a problem for some, and not others is it really an issue. Is their a pole on how much players hate noed? 
---
Does the majority of the DBD community really think noed is OP?
---
Red Forman. In proximity with a Dwight who just popped Haunted Grounds and calling him a dumbass would be timeless.
---
Ask them yourself, the majority of people I‚Äôve seen complain about NOED too
---
Saying they aren‚Äôt good killers doesn‚Äôt make them not good killers, good killers use it wether you choose to believe it or not, it happens much like many other things
---
I was the 1k upvote! Thought it was cool
---
Having ears isn't a skill. Training your ears to distinguish different sounds and knowing each detail of the audio is. It all depends on your hearing and the quality of the headphones you use.
---
It's a great feeling when you loop the killer for multiple gens, only to die to noed and not get saved
---
But it it takes 10 seconds to disarm and by the Time it gets to a 3 gen it would probably be 14 seconds.
---
Except killers can use the same tech that prevent them from cornering a survivor if they both reach the hatch (you lose your hotbox when you hit) to get into position.
---
Dang that‚Äôs cool, what happens if you like a different killer more later though lol
---
BBQ + Distressing + Thrill + BP Offering = Profit
---
I save my moris and instadown hatchets for twitchies, they give the best salt
---
It is really difficult to pull off a decent looking Trapper mask. I just think this one needed more pre-planning and structural work.
---
Without getting a good look at the cleaver, it still looks freakin' sweet!
---
Dwight costume will always be amazing
---
Right. You need more than ears. You need a decent headset (listing from the monitor is not good enough) and you need to train yourself to react to the sounds while translating that sound to a potential survivor location. 
---
Saying ‚Äúyou just need ears‚Äù is like saying you just need eyes to be good with any killer. It‚Äôs dismissive and doesn‚Äôt address the issue.
---
The reason I use noed is just because of swf. It‚Äôs broken as hell and if you are smart enough you could just destroy all the totems.
---
I can't speak for pc since I don't play on pc but 3 blinks on console is nowhere near as scary as on pc
---
Bond just let‚Äôs me cry a little inside.
---
Just like here, including the underscores, but I won't be streaming until next week when finals are over here. It's been a busy semester.
---
what about "tunnel me if ur gay"
---
Yeah, but the problem is everyone thinks they‚Äôre playing against 4 stacks and make stupid calls for SWF to be cancelled or voice chat to not be allowed when you‚Äôre most likely not even playing against a 3-4 stack and just get outplayed (which is bound to happen). No shit duo is still SWF but it is no where near the same level as a 4 stack SWF. Clumping all SWF in one percentage just to make your argument sound better isn‚Äôt a good move since there‚Äôs a huge difference between a 2 stack and a 4 stack (and even a 3 stack). That‚Äôs completely ignoring that you‚Äôre probably not playing against a 4 stack, which means there are 1-2 people that aren‚Äôt communicating with the SWF, which means there is more room for mistakes on the survivors side, which only benefits the killer. I don‚Äôt understand the whole mentality of ‚Äúif it‚Äôs a swf I literally cannot win.‚Äù SWF can completely be beat, and the whole argument is just a bandaid for people who can‚Äôt handle losing a game they take way too personally. Just play the game and move on, it‚Äôs really not the end of the world.
---
Small french one. Guess it checks out.
---
I‚Äôve never met anyone who sounded proud to grief others in a match lmao. That‚Äôs wild.
---
Killer power:
---
Cheap jumpscare. Killer darts forward fast with the camera shaking and allows the survivor to run away. 
---
Finally a rival to Legion.
---
Welcome to the wide and colorful world of fetishes, my friend. Protip: Don't kinkshame people.
---
What is TTV?
---
r/woooosh
---
I have never once seen a .ttv and thought "oh let me go check their stream" in my head it is more like "oh I get bonus points if I kill that guy".
---
I think people get mad at it depending on the situation and context, for example if a survivor tbags at the gates or after stunning the killer, they probably get upset but if they're farming or being friendly they won't
---
Me personally, I don't really get upset about tbagging but just don't be mad if I BM back and don't cite your rulebook to me after the game ends
---
Rip

---
Nah what‚Äôs damn near impossible is all red. Hardest challenge that I‚Äôve done and completed
---
They CAN make a Regina outfit for Kate. Just putting that out there in hope the universe will make it happen -
---
Is it just me or do others also find that almost universally those who put.ttv in their gamertag are terrible teammates. Either hook crashing, chase baiting liabilities who are "just trying to get clips" or complete idiots who do nothing all game. 
---
I cringe every time I load up with a Twitchie on my team
---
I agree with that. I would like a different type of sneaky killer. I would also like to see a madness that messes with player like Eternal darkness. 
---
If you got madness in Eternal Darkness, your character could turn into an enemy, make your volume go up and down, play random sounds, see random enemies, make it seem like the controller disconnected (with a disconnect warning), and have pretend game crashes where your save file was ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think they could go that far out, but it would be nice to see more types of madness illusions and things that can mess with. 
---
I would like a madness that makes you see other players as the killer with a terror radius.
---
Sorry but how can lag fixing nerf killers
---
This, but for Devotion levels.
---
Nah, shack pallet on Gas Heaven
---
And jake mains become experts at breaking other people‚Äôs shit
---
i'd eat her tbh üòã
---
Awww that sucks
---
In honesty, giving solo survivors bond and kindred would help to balance solo and SWF. This would however make survivors more powerful and killers would beed to be buffed in response.
---
Reminds me when I took a hit for a Claudette that escaped and I sacrificed myself

---
Imagine trying to peacefully farm with survivors, only to have them go and do all the gens and teabag at the exit
---
Little boy and fat man from WW2
---
Yea,I once got 4k with entity displeased...
---
Even on survivor side I've been getting SWFs who keep trying to invite me to their group.
---
Hope you get that adept soon.
---
woah their buddy. When did I ever say in ANY of my posts I did this? You okay? You need some water? You need to sit down and take a breathe? Taking this game to seriously is unhealthy, it‚Äôs a video game. When you go off on someone like you just did, maybe you need to re-evaluate your life choices... go play something else for a little while bud.
---
Some times I get downvoted if I say prayer beads is op and some times I get downvoted. I've never understood what's the base opinion of this Reddit about this add-on
---
Extra health state for hook save rush? No, thanks, I'm fed of YOLO hook bomb rushers already
---
This whole post is about swf in general.4man is definitely a problem for killers at a decent rank, 4man rank 20s probably wouldnt make much of a difference, but a 2man isnt exactly negligible either. Higher skilled survivors can give the appearance of being a 4man when solo so at those higher ranks 2 randoms and a 2man or even 2 2mans can still be exceedingly more difficult it can even be the difference between a pip or not. 
---
I will say the only time I'm positive I fight a 2man is when I forget to slug and hook them and they insta sac themselves and the last survivor exits immediately thru hatch. Now I don't send them messages accusing of them swf lol like it's going to happen just like I'll get camped when playing with low rank friends. Unless maybe they exploit sprint burst then I'll send em a message.
---
Also if I get a group with 3 offerings that thicken the dark mist and a Blackwater swamp offering and they dont attempt gens, only hide. That's gotta be 4man swf right? If so then a bill beat a claudette in hide and seek. Hide and seek game mode when?
---
He have to stalk dry two survivors for this, so it's pretty hard :)
---
I will never understand this, since I can use the BP I gain as killer on my survivor and vice versa.
---
This would only be an argument if each side had their own exclusive currency which isn't the case. The fact matchmaking is so borked during BP events is due to this.
---
For survivor meta perks (IMO) are Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable
---
For killer BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury for most killers.
---
Well no here‚Äôs the thing, why not have the guy in rank 9 be the host, so it evens out the playing fails somewhat, instead of having the rank 18 be the host so that they face low levels. I‚Äôm not sure what nobody understands how boosting and manipulating by the game mechanics is okay, just because they have friends. Be fair when you SWF.
---
They're working on making the bloodweb more friendly so I'm holding out hope. I just want my little green number to mean something.
---
The killer adept achieves are honestly ridiculous. However I do not agree with people saying "make the survivor ones more difficult" - because that's equally ridiculous. They simply need to make the killer ones require a 4k again.   
---
They actually did state in the AMA I believe that changing steam achievements is incredibly difficult so I doubt they'll make any changes to it, but I wish they'd at least address how much more difficult the killer achievements are.
---
Give us the Babysitter of the Century, BHVR. Do it.
---
Yeah I bought a coat and had to redo the whole front and put a zipper in. And i wethered it down to make it look more worn
---
Clodhopper saviour send like a better breakdown
---
Also got healed with Autodidact, let me assure you.
---
There's a part in the report section specifically for people like you. If you want more survivors to play with join the DbD discord channel, I truly hope you get banned.
---
Tysm!
---
Kek I am more than happy with my life choices, "friend". But your right you didn't EXPLICITLY say you did this but you questioning/defending the position dc'ing is "fine" certainly implies it. Also I could give a flying fuck about the game or the situation, actively going out of your way to ruin someone else's day is sick and twisted. Maybe its you who should rethink your life choices, get some fresh air or go see a counselor or something.
---
Piggie approves
---
Might only be available if you buy the entire chapter.
---
Why cant the Bloodhunt event stack with it? considering the events dont happen that often and the whole point of this is to give players a reason to be high rank every season. and 15% is no where near enough to keep players attention. Avg survivor game is around 20k BP 15% is 3k your telling me someone is going to play through all the bad games just to be able to obtain 3k bonus bloodpoints for being rank 1? i dont think 15% would encourage anyone to stay high ranked.
---
I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen any comments about the fact that 95% of these people have 0-10 followers and aren‚Äôt even live. Seems pretty pointless to have it in your name when the latter is the case.
---
&gt; they get 8-10 perks
---
Lmao that such a reach. Tell you what, name any 6 of the potential 10 perks swf get. I don‚Äôt even play swf, but empty statements like this doesn‚Äôt help the community. It breeds a ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô mentality on both sides.
---
You're getting downvotes, but I agree. If the killer is good with her, there's still no match for a Nurse. It's just so rare to see a Nurse, let alone someone that good.
---
Thrill, Distressing, and other perks of that nature help you hit the cap, not go over it. 
---
Only one that breaks the cap is BBQ, which is why it's almost ubiquitous on Killers.
---
You made a nice work, it was interesting to read for me! I would be happy if you continue to do similar works and post it on reddit!
---
r/expectedjojo For balance
---
I bought a vinyl coat and had to install a zipper and modify the whole front. 
---
I drove the coat up and down my driveway, rubbed charcoal on it, and hand smeared on acrylic paint. I tried to use bleach to remove some colour for more wear and tear but that colour is NOT moving
---
You're one of the reasons killers with legitimate complaints get shit-talked.
---
Might make an appearance late saturday : )))
---
Also Trapper, Hillbilly, and Spirit as well
---
I‚Äôll save an ebony for you
---
Ohhhh damn it
---
Because there's a bush right beside it. The gap is too small for survivors to fit through.
---
Agreed hah
---
Fair enough if it's your headset, it's just not a good perk to run
---
Kelso &amp; Red Chapter needs to happen now.
---
I felt bad for both the hag and the spirit
---
BBQ is limited and ends in a few seconds, NOED ends when you find the totem which takes time and the killer would probably go back and forth between the totem and finding survivors, that logic doesn‚Äôt work against NOED
---
Basement to be reskinned to Eric's basement to fit the theme
---
tf is this survivors gain 1500 for unhooks and they just farm teammates plus bbq isnt that big of a jump and its harder to earn as a killer anyway
---
My first few hundred hours in this game were as killer and NOED Activated 98% percent of the time that I ran it. I can remember maybe 4-5 instances were they got all the totems first. From all the times that it activated It gets popped less than half the time, alot of people just want to get the fuck out or they go down. 
---
I think what needs to change is totems, and the devs have alot of opportunity for that. There needs to be more incentive besides there MIGHT be NOED and 1000bp. I know they have plans for the Archives to be release in the next few months, maybe they should incorporate totems into it. If I remember the Year 3 Stream correctly the devs said there would be like challenges to get stuff done that would be related to The Archives. 
---
If they couldn‚Äôt do that then Small Game could really use a totem counter on it, so you know how many totems are left and if you decide not to look for them, then NOED is on you.
---
So skillbased
---
No problem. BM = 'bad manners'.
---
If you tunnel them you're gay
---
What is life's greatest illusion?
---
Innocence, my brother.
---
The killer missplayed tho, shouldve waited
---
What‚Äôs worse about that is they can disarm traps, let the friends come through it, then let you get trapped. That would really suck if that happens, hope you get the adept game soon.
---
Repost because new account and the old one is hidden
---
I played Hag on Xbox a bit and I can‚Äôt really see how she is anything more than a M1 killer
---
"Bad Manners" has somehow been turned into both an acronym and a verb.
---
I‚Äôve been trying, I just gotta learn and get used to trapper
---
**YIKES**
---
Why does it look like a normal totem though?
---
Yeah near the lower ranks you require only 3 iridescent and 1 silver but higher up you require more
---
You literally have ti double pip to get adept as killer
---
And as survivor all you have to do is escape by any means
---
Still really good
---
So your a moron then
---
BHVR is just leaving money on the table with this banger.
---
One of the faint echoes in the basement: "You're a dumbass."
---
I use red moris just to put everyone on edge and then never use it.
---
You should put there the dc icon XDDDDD
---
I don't know it bothers you so much, it's too weird. I'm here because I'm interested to know. When I'm not interested in something,  I just avoid that thing.
---
These guys are such idiots...
---
They advertise their twitch channel ingame, then they get salty when the killer says hi in the twitch chat after stream sniping. 
---
What the fuck did you think would happen?
---
Yea
---
Let me blow my own horn here: Breakdown is a poorly designed perk. In the end who cares if a hook is temporarily destroyed? The killer will just look for another, making the perk useless. 
---
Clodhopper Saviour, in the other hand, wastes the killer's time, forcing a second grab action, which allows other survivors to perform flashlight/firework saves. Also, the wiggling meter will be fuller because of the second grab, giving the grabbed survivor a potential wiggle escape. 
---
Also, the most interesting part of the perk is that it creates a mindgame: does the survivor has Clodhopper or doesn't he? That will affect the killer's decision-making process, whether to hook the survivor in the same hook the other one was just unhooked or to look for a different hook. Even if Clodhopper isn't present in the trial it will leave the killer considering the possibility it is, like the current DS (killers often leave recently unhooked survivors downed for a few seconds before grabbing them because they consider the possibility that they might have DS).
---
I consider the perk to balanced since it is easily countered (just look for another hook), yet interesting for when it works it really gives the survivor an advantage. And the best part of it is that the difference between one scenario and the other is purely a mindgame.
---
The version on PS4 comes with doc and hag and nurse, you have to buy them on pc

Actually did that to a nurse once (minus the ttv part)
---
They were so unaware of what was going on around them that a friend and I were able to sprint behind them all game. No one was ever in any danger because theyhe didn't know how to blink so they would just blink about 5 inches forward and get stunned.

It‚Äôs was very very slow, most of her add on had negatives and you couldn‚Äôt teleport as far I got it on 12/12/17 and her buff happened between the clown and the spirits release
---
To be completely honest as much as I do love streaming on twitch I can't follow their recommendations on how they've been recently.
---
"Idiot who acts in a deliberately annoying manner is surprised when person is subsequently annoyed, film at 11"
---
Or, which makes more sense as a verb, "bad mouthing".
---
Low ranks = op
---
High ranks= don‚Äôt run it
---
The buffed score events can be pretty good now.
---
You still have to get a few pallet stuns and be chased, but you don't have to be chased for four gens to get good returns if you're also doing generators.
---
I feel like being chased long enough can still be difficult sometimes, and I do wish certain other actions (chests especially) gave more. It'd be nice to get points for staying alive without being hit or discovered as well, particularly near the killer, more than like the 13 points it currently gives.
---
Literally every surv can be seen coming out of and returning to the closet, so I asked my LGBTQ friends and they confirmed that this was a key sign of gayness.
---
She is probably the second best killer in the game. Her teachable‚Äôs are great too, however if you‚Äôre investing money into the game I would suggest buying the cannibal/leather face first. He comes with a perk called bbq and chili which is great for getting more blood points as well as just being a great perk by itself. ^-^
---
Tbh when I gen jockey to punish campers I'm not really having fun either. 1+/5 people aren't having fun.

'Tunnel me dad OwO'
---
Yeaaaaaaa Adam gang good choice ooga booga
---
I had a ghost face once that I evaded all game and did most of the objectives on my own.  He let me open the exit gate, and we co-teabagged, hand in hand, to the exit together.  Was a beautiful moment.
---
What about my boi Billy? I think he has the most fucked up story.
---
How‚Äôs it not a good perk? Counters the stealth killers and tells you which way the killer is going in a chase. Can also help you know if the spirit is using her ability too
---
Mint Rag + Rusty Shackles + Make Your Choice.
---
Makes you the best basement camper without even needing to be there.
---
We're gonna live forever would be better if you do gens to get the tokens instead since if your teammates are good, you won't get any token unless you take a bit from them forcefully after running after them for like 8 hours
---
I thought I was the only one lol. It‚Äôs great drawing though.
---
In my experience the bigger issue is with streamers being fast to D/C as soon as they‚Äôre downed and move on to the next game. It‚Äôs poor sportsmanship.
---
That said, some of the best, most comedically dramatic people I‚Äôve played with were .TTV-ers. I once had a David streamer who barged through the same window at a sprint 2 or 3 times to lead a killer away from me. He almost immediately got hooked, but the sheer level of intentional noise was delightful.
---
Then they will just kill themselves on first hook, what's the difference?
---
If they use it and it gets them 2+ kills at the end of the game with the other two Survivors escaping, no, they are not good killers.
---
They're just better than you
---
Why are you so mad about it lmao. It's a game. Get over yourself. If someone plays in a manner that I wont be having any fun, why would I force myself to stay in that lobby? I don't play games to be frustrated, I play games for fun.
---
Looks absolutely amazing c:
---
STOP UNHOOKING IN FRONT OF ME!  ESPECIALLY IF I JUST WENT TO INGEST AT A FOUNTAIN, AND YOU DON'T HAVE BT!  HOW DID YOU THINK THAT WOULD GO?
---
Yeah my friend got banned for "body blocking" survivors. Which in this case means keeping them on the stairs of the basement while he hit them. He didn't trap them he was just hitting them and they couldn't manage to get around him. He got 2 downs and injured the third person this way. Went to log on the next day and he had been banned. So.
---
They all had pretty fucked up backstories unlike the movie killers
---
I was camping someone named "camp me" once. He was pissed. His friends less so at least : P
---
Maybe I‚Äôll try Bill and Jeff in a bit, I‚Äôll post them depending how well they go
---
Nea players are the most toxic. I kill toxic.
---
What perks are really good too then? Spine chill helps me know if the killer saw me, if he‚Äôs coming to the gen I‚Äôm working on and if he‚Äôs going for me instead of someone else. Many other ways too, but they‚Äôre not as big. OoO is great against some killers like GF and Wraith but isn‚Äôt as useful against others.
---
Pretty sure he is criticizing his teammates for using self care, saying them running self card is good for the killer
---
Yeah man I get you, I do see why but I also don‚Äôt agree with it :(
---
Awesome!
---
Highly doubt that since you can find out at the start of the game by emoting, since if you have the glitch it won‚Äôt let you emote.
---
That makes me think why is her hand so big in the game xD
---
Wanna beat bbq? Get distortion or run into lockers as soon as someone gets hooked.
---
Wanna beat ruin? Have two man team on gen and two looking for ruin. (If its a big map)
---
Three man team on gen and one man looking for ruin. (If small map)
---
so people still play both sides, there's no reason for your BP to skyrocket/plummet for simply playing another aspect of the game. Survivor BP is horrendous compared to killers.
---
Had me in the first half, ngl
---
I.... Have agreed to that the whole time...
---
It is fine, but I don‚Äôt think it should let you go through the killer. I have had matches where someone dead hards through me. It is supposed to protect a hit, not turn you into the Nurse. 
---
Yes, most of that may be the devs not putting the camera in the right place and crappy collision boxes, but as killer, that is what it looks like and that is the impression it gives. That should be tweaked.
---
I've ran Bubba's basement without Insidious, I've seen the entire remaining party charge in for the unhook and had them all downed even when I came in from the outside.
---
The playerbase can be very special at times.
---
&gt;  sacrificing map pressure for one kill
---
Bear in mind that you can engineer a build that uses every possible anti-generator perk so that the killer can afford to camp that first hook, and not all killers have the capacity for map pressure.
---
Bubba has an area instadown, and Myers can pull the same trick by sitting on 99% T2 and only hitting T3 when people roll in for the save. They're both somewhat incentivised to stay near a hook and snowball as people come in to save.
---
You're correct to certain exten that "just do gens" is the counter to camping, the problem is that unless you're going all-in on a generator rush you're going to have increasingly longer odds as the killer reduces you player by player.
---
There's a dissonance between players who want BP and players who want a 4k. A lot of killers end up foregoing BP for the 4k because they've had a "bad" experience one time too many, and the balance is always in the killer's favour when it comes to making people have a really unenjoyable game.
---
Oh man I can't wait until buying the Legion wasnt a mistake

---
I thought I was immerse but I don‚Äôt use a good setup for it I‚Äôm a toxic bill
---
I don't like using bp that I got from killers for anyone but that killer. With killers it feels like you run out of add-ons so quickly that you just have to keep leveling them up as you play them or else you end up with crap add ons.
---
And I just murder all of them, after toying long enough
---
I don't really get why people do this.
---
They beat you last game so you use some broken add ons/mori to win the next match. Unless they've sent you to Haddonfield with Balanced landing, what are you honestly accomplishing there?
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal.
---
The simple reason is that gambling and loot boxes are addicting. There is a reason that many games have loot boxes instead of straight earning purchases. They work to keep people playing. 
---
Fact is people like the frustration of not getting the perk because the excitement when you do is bigger. It keeps more people playing than it does frustrates people to quit. 
---
It sucks. But it‚Äôs true.
---
I get gen grabs with bone clapper + ghost so the meme works either way
---
can negate loops? can find survivors anywhere? can get insta his 90% of the time? forces survivors to crouch around. don‚Äôt you dare diss my hag. if you learn to trap you‚Äôll be good.
---
Your idea seems to be good as well but I was trying to think of something for the lower prestiges and maybe even non prestige people too.
---
Add a casual playlist to the game and lock swf to that.
---
I don't play DBD just stumbled here from popular,  
---
Basically this.  I play fighting games competitively and I stream-and i make my room name have .ttv at the end so people know i'm streaming.  So that way if we play-boom you can check my archive and now you've got free replays, something that helps out anyone and a lot of people don't do.
---
Here's my opinion on them all.
---
Sprint burst is useful to get a headstart, but it can limit movement if you plan on saving it.
---
Lithe is the most useful for helping you escape (when paired with other perks) or to get some distance mid chase.
---
Balanced Landing is good for looping and gaining distance mid chase, the killer might also just leave you alone if you use it well enough. All of this will depend on the map though.
---
Deadhard is THE best for looping and is garbage for gaining distance. I rarely see people use it effectively when I'm killer... They usually just waste it in open areas to try and avoid a hit.
---
Head On is not very hard to use, it's just very situational, but it is the most fun and can help your entire team of used right. (Fucking love this perk)
---
Everything has pros and cons. Deadhard is probably the hardest to use, which is why I usually go for Lithe, Balanced Landing or Head On if I wanna have a laugh.
---
You totally can, nothing should stop you from watching them. But know that if you need to stream snipe to win, you may not be as good of a killer as you think.
---
Every stereotypical portrayal of african american dads.
---
They would just be those shadow t pose models they use when someone dc‚Äôs
---
Well survivor is better overall in my opinion as it seems people have gotten a little bit better but survivors have been getting nerfs here and there. Grinds the same but next chapter which is soon will tweak the bloodweb, killers have been the same mostly besides some perks that needed a buff like Pop goes the weasel.
---
You might, but I don't.
---
Puerto Rico. I get brazilian lobbies all the fucking time. Its so annoying.
---
"And then everybody clapped."
---
I play Killer slightly more often than I play survivor, but I still play them about 40/60.
---
I‚Äôll touch u    ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Yeah. They could also add something for when you prestige a survivor or killer.
---
I did it in one try same as old freddy
---
I'm have you been unhooking when a stealth killer has no terror radius,not in range for it etc because BT is terror radius based.
---
That's not true. lol  You can't talk in the game, so bad-mouthing would still apply, mate.  Bad mannering isn't a verb.  Never has been. lol
---
Clown. For that *thicc* ass
---
clodhopper with flip flop and boil over sounds like a complete nightmare
---
Isn't NA EAST closer to you, though?
---
I would say it depends on your playstyle. If you're a gen jockey it's very good for that. If you're a distraction, it will definitely hinder you with better options. Good players are usually not the gen jockeys, they buy the time the team needs. Maybe you're not there yet, so keep spine chill on. 
---
If you don't have headphones- keep it on. If you get confident to waste the killers time, definitely remove it. As it really is a crutch perk. Then again depending on what build you're going for, it may benefit your playstyle
---
Female models tend to be smaller and harder to see, claudette also has cosmetics that blend in well, and her perks are ones that people want to unlock for other characters. So in other words she's viable and/or an inescapable step for most people.
---
You use the red stain, and if they moon walk they ain't showing up on Spine Chill, and if u are on a gen you can just look around you will almost always see the killer before they are on top of you
---
**YES**
---
And Lithe, I can't count how many times I disappeared in Lery Memorial Center using this combo.
---
fair enough
---
&gt; multi-blink add ons and range add ons
---
Really? I knew they're reworking her add ons but i'm glad to hear those 2 are going. Nurse doesn't need them.
---
I really hope they keep base Nurse as is, she's the most fun i have with DBD and i've put hundreds of hours into her.
---
Well thats on you. If you can average 60-100k every match as killer you should never run out if stuff for them and also level up someone else at the same time. Unless you're trying to run purple and red add-ons every single match
---
Depends on the map though, especially the closed in ones. By the time I see that red stain he‚Äôs already coming for me. I‚Äôll try and change it for a better perk though I guess
---
i haven't encountered this yet but are you sure you don't play against stealth killers or killers that have a low TR who try to make sure they hide their TR while you rescue or being rescued?
---
That‚Äôs actually not a bad idea. It does take alway from the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù aspect of the game, I think but at the same time ads some lore. Like, maybe they could be in their past skin for some reason? Also give us the opportunity to see them before they were taken.
---
Yeah, her eyes are incredibly large and almost fish-like.
---
Ah ok
---
If only I could be so grossly incandescent!
---
And I... Have disagreed with the possible reasons it's unbalanced the whole time
---
IKR but I still get Brazilian lobbies. Its so frustrating having 200 ping and then having them message you saying ‚Äúvoc√™ √© uma merda‚Äù
---
Great cosplay (and my favourite killer too :D)
---
Do you have any social media where you'd post pictures from the Expo?
---
To be fair, Billy would still look like Billy. That was why he was bricked off in a room to begin with.
---
Its sad that is whats expected of as the standard.
---
Bad JuJu Magic. She summoned something dark and sinister because she was pissed off, and I guess part of that was becoming this?
---
Usually anything yello w tier or below has no actual impact on the game. Unless you have everyone prestiged, leveling up multiple killers is slow and inefficient.  That's why it's not a good solution to me and I assume many others to just grind out like that with what feels like little gain.
---
Not only that but her jaw and cheekbones look so unnatural.
---
The perks just frustrated me instantly
---
"You only need to get all perks on 1 survivor and get others to lvl 40. killer players need to grind all the killers they wanna play".
---
I mean, if you wanna play more than one surv you gotta grind too. And killers may wanna play survs from time to time.
---
What program did you use?
---
The spirit doesn't feel that hard to mind game. It's easier with iron will. + I run lightweight. So she can't track me that easily, and gets confused when I stop running. Change directions without sprinting. Sometimes I'll even go back to where I just came from, by the time she figures out that I mind gamed her. My tracks have disappeared, and I sprint away, in a new direction. If she finds the scratch Mark's. Her power is on cooldown. So I've made an escape. 
---
If it seems like she's given up on me, she's using her power to catch up. If you play her, you'll know her disadvantages. It easy to lose survivors if you can't see her/ hide your scratch marks.
---
Nah then MCote himself appeared in the chat and gave me my own special ‚Äúdefeating baby killers‚Äù achievement that only I have. Who the fuck would be sad enough to make up a story about DbD post game chat, you disembodied foot?
---
The idea they went for in the rework is great but they overdid it. For the way he works now to be more viable he needs more speed and duration to have map pressure since he can't down anymore, less stun time either directly or with reworked addons and just an addon reowrk in general. Only 3 are good and the rest are either completely pointless or their effect is too little to make any difference.
---
Okay my dude, this is your second meme saying that Spirit isn‚Äôt skill-based. I‚Äôm suggesting that you stop sprinting everywhere you go. Get Iron Will. Stop fucking running everywhere. Learn that she is sound-based and can see your scratch-marks. And most importantly;
---
Stop making a new meme every time you lose against a Spirit.
---
hillbilly is powerful by himself but yes I run bbq+ruin+nurses+make your choice and my add ons are usually speed ones I always seem to run this build and I always seem to 4k I'll probally run this until  that's I can get a anti gen build going with discord and pop goes the weseal
---
The ultimate "Anti-Bubba Basement" build
---
I need eye bleach
---
You gotta remember, hag was young. 12-15 at most.
---
Rip me for deciding to play DBD to relax after a hard day
---
What is a dedicated server?
---
Having a decent headset is not skills either. 
---
''you need to train yourself to react to the sounds while translating that sound to a potential survivor location.'' You really are trying to make it sound fancy. That literally is you just having ears. You're not using some echolocation science equipment to track survivors. Talking like spirit is science *eyeroll*
---
It's not about the views, It's about having fun. Streaming is a great hobby to have and let's you meet lots of nice people. Some of us just do it to have fun.
---
They definitely look that way because proportionally her eyes make everything look tiny. Her cheekbones are okay, they‚Äôre set high and wide, which is common in asian people, her jaw does look very concave and under-bite-y though
---
They haven't specifically confirmed that they are removing them, but considering how stupidly strong they are and given that they are pretty much nurses only good add ons, it's quite obvious that they are removing them. The issue is that they said "we are looking to rework nurse and her add ons" which gives me the scary idea that they might nerf base nurse. I think base nurse is on a very good spot, and it would sadden me if nurse was to no longer become the strongest killer. It would also anger a lot of nurse mains, who've dumped many hours on her, becoming better without the use of extra blinks and range.
---
The responses have been enlightening, thanks to everyone for their view points!
---
Dead Hard is overrated. 
---
However DS in solo Q is pretty useful since teammates always fwrm you.
---
Don't forget your /s!
---
I have 600 hours in DBD and still don't know how to hide offerings AMA
---
Add Deliverance just in case. hahaha
---
Playing trappy boi is hard enough against solos in low ranks. Cant even imagine when you get those groups.
---
I once tried to do a daily with trappy boi. I had only one cypress memento mori. They all had insta heals and I was just waiting for them to leave while I slug on of the survivors. I had noed, they found it, cleansed it, ran to me, insta healed him and really cucked me from my daily. 
---
Then they messaged me saying I was trash and that I should uninstall.
---
Next match its the same group. This time I ran my NO GEN WRAITH BUILD with an Ebony Mori.
---
No one escaped and the game ended in 5 minutes.
---
Got messaged again on how trash I am for using OP Perks and having OP add ons and OP Offerings.
---
(This is my build btw)

I feel it's ridiculously overpowered/crutched(hex+bbq) Since killer has host advantage, and that never goes well.
---
 Descent players last like a minute at most. That's barely enough to find the totem.
---
All hillbillys bbq+ruin+1hit+host advantage/hitbox 200%= huge disadvantage + limited frames on console.
---
It punishes gen-rushing without doing totems and watching out for the killer‚Äôs perks. You can always see when a killer only has three active perks, one of which is probably Ruin, and can quickly decipher if they are running NoED.
---
It will say "hidden" or "secret" on the offering I believe...
---
I joined a lobby last night as the 4th member of a lobby of 3SWF.
---
They were all Laurie Strode and convinced me to join them all as Laurie Strode with only DS perk.
---
We did pretty solid, got down to 1 gen left against a trapper before it all snowballed from great trap placements and we lost.
---
That's usually a sign it is likely real. 
---
And while I hate the comment repetition, you should point out of to the mod of you enter want things to change. Otherwise nothing will change and you may alloy people who actually enjoy this kind of thing.
---
I AM MAD BECAUSE I THINK ALL KILLERS SHOULD BE CHANGED TO BE STRONG BUT WHEN YOU SUGGEST BUFFS PEOPLE STRAIGHT UP RAGE ON YOU. 
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH A GOOD GAME BALANCE AND VARIETY?!?
---
It's called a grab, the killer grabs a survivor right in the asshole and puts them on their shoulder and get some bloodpoints. If you pull off a Jane, the killer is stunned because they just busted a nut.
---
You have to stay behind him and click M1. Lunging won't work.
---
Or mori them
---
Is that Carl the cashier?
---
Just remember, Ghostface, what comes around is all around!
---
Had a game last night on swamp where the last two survivors alive were a Claudette and a Dwight. For fifteen minutes, I patrolled the last four gens and none of them were ever touched. Eventually found the Dwight in a locker in the basement, closed the hatch, and the Claudette didn‚Äôt even try for the doors. She just was so immersed she died still hidden.
---
What you say makes sense and i understand it too. But consider the fact that you can close the hatch even when they already jumped and they're mid air. 
---
I guess i will be certain when dedicated servers come.
---
Plot Twist: The Hag is actually Jane Romero.
---
Survivor is a risky role not gonna lie.
---
I literally have no idea what the second part of your message is even supposed to say because there are so many errors. 
---
Also, it was announced at E3 that stranger things content would be coming to a behaviour game but that‚Äôs literally all that has been said. No leaks or anything, so this is all just crazy theorizing.
---
Yea its due to a human fallacy called loss aversion. Basically we are innately wired to value loss twice as painful as gains enjoyable. Its bullshit and shouldn't really be exploited in general, especially in games. I play games to escape dull and mundane reality, not to play a gambling simulator.
---
Point of view
---
DEDICATED SERVERS WILL FUCK THE OVER LIKE NURSE FUCKS EVERYONE AT RANK RESET
---
Ah i see, getting grabbed in the asshole is a one shot mechanic in irl too so I love the realism this game holds.
---
No lunge got it.
---
It makes perfect sense, actually.  Ask an English major.  Bad mouthing implies shit talking, and just because a person isn't *literally* talking doesn't mean they aren't shit talking, they are just doing it in the only way available to them.  If players had the option to talk in game they'd be shit talking.  It's all bad manners, true.  And you can denote that as BM because it makes sense, but to imply that bad mouthing makes no sense at all is actually very far from the truth.  Also, as mentioned, bad mannering isn't a verb.  It actually fundamentally makes total sense to assume "bad mouthing" in the context of bm'ing' as a verb.
---
Ha!
---
So many easy ways to buff this character but remember: the devs are hesitant to buff him because he stomps rank 20 newbies. That is the reason why they don't buff him. 
---
Easy QOL improvements:
---
1: Trapper carries 2 traps by default. 
---
2: fix the hitboxes on the traps.
---
3: Saboteur no longer destroys traps.
---
4: make Iridescent Stone a base ability. 
---
5: last but not least, Trapper can walk over his own traps without setting them off.
---
Those are probably SWF- level headed persons or really skilled matchmaking (lucky team)
---
Do you use boost mode on the pro4?
---
Oh, I was so confused about that lol
---
Your talking about verbal toxic behavior while in the lobby before the match begins...that's entirely different and PC specific...completely agree with you there...when I play on PC, if someone is excessively being an idiot, of course I leave the lobby...many of us do ...we are just referring to people who disconnect and ruin the match for everyone else ...you are already in match and unable to prevent it ahead of time.  They screw over their fellow survivors either a)intentionally and it makes them selfish aholes ...or b) don't even think about the effect their DC has on the rest of their fellow survivors and the killer, and it makes them completely ignorant, entitled idiots.  Bottomline, disconnecting is the most poisonous and toxic behaviour in online multiplayer gaming.  Bar none...no contest.  It's the most frustrating part of multiplayer gaming because it's the only one that wastes my time.  I couldnt give a rat's ass about NOED or tunneling or any of that stuff.  I have played somewhere between 1000 and 2000 hrs in this game cumulatively and enjoy it and still de immensely.  That doesn't mean I'm going to sit tight and not try to change the world regardless of how futile it might seem.  Always speak up.  Imagine 3 buddies agree to help you move .. then two minutes in 1 or two buddies walk off ten feet, crack open a beer and sit down and watch you move the rest with the one bud left helping.  Or that person who agrees to buy something from you online...you wait an hour at home...and he doesn't show up...no call...no messege...nothing...These are the same kind of people that DC from multiplayer games.  Same kind of annoyance and waste of time.  Of course I want to single out these people for being worthless.  I enjoy the game and I have plenty of energy left over to remind these people how worthless they are.  Friend of mine also has a black list and he likes to going into matches with them and blatantly sandbag the hell out of them...I don't take it that far...but part of me wants to.
---
Yeah... maybe it's because when she called out to the entity it imbued her hand with power. Maybe she drew a symbol on the ground with it to commune with evil prior to being changed. 
---
... or it's so she reach those hard to itch places easier. No backscratcher needed.
---
yeap if it's a good team then these are your 2 options of teams when and no I have a one x and explain this boost mode lol
---
Is everyone forgetting she is a CHILD
---
Because clout chasers are a thing.
---
plane rip \*
---
Lmao this is funny but I‚Äôm pretty new. Which pallet is god pallet. Is it good because it has the best loop potential?
---
Nobody has ever used "bad mouthing" unless it is spoken or written communication. I implore you to find an example. Literally anywhere. 
---
As I have already noted, something being a verb does not matter. Refer to my previous example of memeing. We create new verbs in informal settings.
---
Looks like Jane a bit :D
---
When you say "lunging won't work" does that mean I just to make it a instant click rather than holding, or that for a split second I need to stop walking before hitting m1?
---
No. The killer can close the hatch even after the survivor started jumping in, it cancels the escape.
---
I run NOED, but as a trump card. But if NOED is OP, then shouldn't fragrent tuft of hair be removed from Myers? No, because its still balanced. I've seen people break a NOED quicker than I could find a survivor.
---
Ikr üòÇ
---
Looking at the wall instead of where the killer could be was making me anxious lol
---
Depends on the time it's either really bad or good.
---
I 4k'd against a streamer and her friend as Billy and she just complained about how boring it is to play against billy. Even her chat was full of hate lol. I just wanted my daily but I got something even better. Salty streamer tears.
---
My bet is September 3rd.
---
Killers I‚Äôd say need a buff a majority of them do cause you usually see the same two or three every game and que times are about the same
---
and alex toolnox
---
Wait what
---
I usually let the victim get away to show that I won‚Äôt tolerate farmers
---
I think being able to kill survivors mori-style is a tad much. Other than that it's a good change
---
Nice we showed them
---
or then maybe you should be applying pressure intead of winning in a cheap way. bro just run PGTW, way better than ruin.
---
Wow, 3 kids, those are pretty permanent Karen
---
You are free to do that. Those reasons still exists even if you think they're not enough. I am not arguing against you here, buddy - i am just bringing up the reasons they propably haven't changed yet
---
Did you just ignore the part where I explained why? Killers rely on add-ons, getting add-ons is slow unless you put all your BP into.
---
&gt; If you can average 60-100k every match as killer you should never run out if stuff for them and also level up someone else at the same time.
---
This is dependent on how much you play and whether you consistently run BBQ and/or bring in pudding or streamers. Plenty of people don't do either
---
U ever see a piece of fan art that makes u like a character? I thought she looked ok but this puts a whole new perspective on it. Take my upvote
---
"Bad mouthing" is not the correct verb. It is not applicable here. Nobody uses it to mean that. It doesn't make sense.
---
It's not a big deal, but not one single person uses it in the way that you are. Not ever. If someone else wants to chime in and confirm that's what they use it for then fine, but I honestly doubt anyone will.
---
I dont wanna do bones i need to do gens as fast as possible and then complain about noed
---
&gt; Distressing + Thrill
---
these do not exceed the cap, though. They only help you reach the 8000 point max. and a number of killers do not need help maxing the relevant categories
---
Because the majority of survivor players are entitled cunts. It's as simple as that. NOED is unfair according to them but somehow perks like DS, Unbreakable, Adrenaline, plus things like the Key and Instant Heal are totally fair. Not even mentioning SWF with mics. If you bring these points up to them they just fall back on BS excuses like this is casual game so they can play however they want to (but killer's cannot of course) or a million other excuses.
---
It feels wasted when it's taken away
---
"They main the other side" does not mean they completely ignore the other. They just invest more on the other.
---
WrongThink is a crime on the DBD forums, punishable by expungement.
---
gen rushing is basically survivor's job isnt it? killer can counter than playing good, and with this version killers get a massive reward for playing good. so actually makes noed better for both sides
---
It‚Äôs annoying to go against billy a lot but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs op. There is counter play. Personally I just think his chainsaw hit box is broken. And idk if it‚Äôs just me but sometimes Billy‚Äôs will obv fail at predicting me w the chainsaw n when they realize it, RIGHT before the animation is finished they‚Äôll turn the chainsaw literally last second and it‚Äôll somehow hit me. I don‚Äôt think you should be able to turn once the chainsaw has already been ‚Äúlunged‚Äù or used w.e you call it imo
---
Thanks! I also wanne start doing stuff like this!
---
Soak it in. Savor it.
---
Like it or not, that is what Prime baby dweet looks like.
---
I mean, isn't it like this with every killer? I got called noob for playing Bubba and deleting the full SWF stack. And that without Insidious camping, the only thing Bubba is good for.
---
It's a very low tier skill then. There aren't that many places survivors can even go.
---
Ehm no it's not punishing those for not being higher rank it's rewarding those for being better at the game. If there's no point in being better at the game what's the point in trying to get better at it? Right now it's literally worthless being at red ranks. Why should I stay at red ranks when I have more fun in purple and green ranks against lesser killers because I have an easier time and have less pressure to do better? Every multiplayer game rewards those who get better at it
---
Ghostface, he has no deformities at all looks like a generally average person although a little bit stabby  and for most messed up would be Leatherface mainly because he wears a face and screams like a disabled child(which he is I believe)
---
The only time I have a problem with Billy is when my team all gets downed by him and thats when Im playing with a bad team. I dont think hes OP.
---
&gt; i am a killer main.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/okp66FD
---
Idiots insist this and it's obvious that you clearly don't play killer or you hang out at the low ranks and think that stomping on tards that don't understand loops somehow makes you an expert.
---
I don't know, for the next killer could we just get the bear? Bears are pretty scary, and run faster than people.
---
if you go into the basement against a Hag you have no one to blame but yourself, honestly
---
It is when you are unhooked and the killer immediately comes back to the hook to chase/down you again (even if they are mid-chase with another survivor).
---
I HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS GAME IN TWO MONTHS AND I'M RANK 18 ON SURVIVOR AND 20 ON KILLER, EVERY TIME I PLAY SURVIVOR WITH MY FRIENDS WE ALMOST ALWAYS GUARENTEED DIE AGAINST A RANK 12 KILLER WHICH ISNTTTTTTTT EVEN THAT FUCKING HIGHHHHHHHHHH AND EVERY TIME I PLAY FUCKING KILLER I GET LOOPED BY A 4MAN OF P3 SURVIVORSSSSSSSSSSSSSS AGHHHHHHH
---
*his router
---
&gt; Doesn't even need to be on the same side of the map to camp :)
---
always love when someone shows that they haven't played the killer they're crying about
---
Cry to your buddies on Discord while you load up on insta heals and 2nd chance perks, they're the only ones who care.
---
so precious must protect
---
**This pack now includes StatusEffects aswell!**
---
We can't have survivors own up to their mistakes, and God forbid, *get better* , now, can we?
---
That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm cutting your arm off
---
You talking about bloodpoints or the "xp" given that rewards you shards per level?
---
Bloodpoints = be killer, run bbq&amp;chili,  and try not to murder too fast.   
---
Xp =  just play the game, and try to keep games under 10 minutes.   You get xp mostly based on playtime with a minor impact based on performance.  It does get severely diminishing returns, so a 25 minute 3 gen game is going to get less xp than 3 games played in the same timeframe.
---
Should've been the BHVR logo.
---
just play
---
&gt; Ehm no it's not punishing those for not being higher rank it's rewarding those for being better at the game.
---
Ehm no because you can be lower rank just because you don't get to play much. And even if you're just not as good, you still deserve to have equal access to bloodwebs. Something like this would just make it more difficult for people to get to higher ranks, not because of skill, but because they won't have access to the necessary perks to compete well 
---
The rest of your comment is talking like I don;t think there should be rank rewards; there should be. I just think NP stacks is an awful way to do it. It should be shards.
---
Not true. Around a jungle gym there is a bunch of places. 
---
Out in the open you are screwed. 
---
I agree there should be more counter-play, but it does take time and skill to learn when to use and save the power and learn to track with sound. 
---
She is like nurse, when you train with her, there is some, but little, counterplay. Good survivors can juke Spirits, though. After she uses her power, she is a 110 killer and easier to escape. You just have to go from gym to gym between phases. 
---
The problem with spirit is actually the counterplay is guessing and playing unpredictably. 
---
It would be better if the Spirit had no husk when using her power so survivors could tell when she was. The spirit could still stay in place for a pallet juke, but at the cost of loosing a phase charge if she guessed wrong.
---
playing survivor and surviving for at least 10 mins should get you around 500 exp
---
I felt like I had to show the context of the situation
---
THX dude wasnt thinking about getting one but there was an Ebay deal for 279 flat with controller  couldnt beat it ;)
---
To be fair pallet looping the killer is a valid use of time as it frees up the rest of the team to be productive.
---
Spirit is just as skill based as Survivors are. Your move.
---
You're right playing at higher ranks does get tougher because you need the meta perks for each individual killer and survivor at higher ranks. Which is exactly why they should get increased points to get the meta perks that they need. Why should people get shards all that does it either give cosmetics or maybe with enough of a grind get teachables that are random or killers. You're saying there should be rank rewards and people in higher ranks need better perks, which you get in the bloodweb which is exactly why my idea of increased bloodpoints per colour rank solves your issue.
---
you need 12 hooks in total to kill everyone. To use an ebony mori and reduce the number to only 4 hooks in total and be able to kill everyone is kill rushing in my opinion (i know it sounds kinda stupid to call it that)
---
Not sure about most messed up, but least would be wraith
---
For me it would ether be wraith or huntress

---
Preach / say it louder for the Dwight‚Äôs in the lockers and special snowflakes in the back of room
---
You know what I mean tho right you play wraith rank 1 go up against a real good team and the maps pallet woods, it's almost impossible to get a hook on each one, and it would be 4 hooks but it's technically still 8 as you would need to get them down again to mori them, right?
---
Well yeah. Naturally you have to have a power time extension add-on. Otherwise you will go limp prematurely.
---
Hell, I don't even use any of those. I just started using shitty items (farming)
---
2nd chance perks- my build isn't centered around 2nd chances. That's situational perks, which are good, but doesn't necessarily mean everyone runs them. I don't

&gt; Lisa Sherwood grew up in a quiet town. The people of the village were kind, and the elders helped settle their disputes and keep the old traditions alive. Lisa was particularly fond of the charms they taught her to draw for safety and good fortune. One night, as she was walking home through the woods, a terrible storm struck without warning. In the slick wet darkness, she lost her footing and struck her head. Slipping in and out of consciousness, she watched dark shapes approach between the trees. Soon they were close enough for her to make out their evil, hungry grins.

&gt; They kept her chained to the wall in a flooded cellar. Through the gloom, she could see others, whose open wounds swarmed with flies. They did not survive long once the cannibals began carving bites from their bodies with their rusted blades, but somehow Lisa persisted. Starved and mutilated, her gaunt arms became loose in their shackles. She pulled, and the metal tore through skin and muscle until she was free. Her flesh oozed viscous yellow pus and bones were visible beneath gangrenous wounds. She could go no further. Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. She traced the symbols they had taught her. A dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned for blood. She chose vengeance.
---
&gt; The police search eventually brought them to the old house in the swamp. Its inhabitants had been dismembered and devoured. The elders‚Äô charms were scrawled in blood on the floor. Lisa‚Äôs body was never found.
---
Where's the child part?
---
In the nick of time lol
---
i understand your point but you can do the same math with the downs. Dont get me wrong ... i know the pain of a high rankes Wraith for example ...but my point is still way stronger (for me) than just this argument
---
Lmao, true
---
No, her lore only mentions her being from a ‚Äúlonely village‚Äù with kind people whose elders kept traditions alive by teaching her charms.
---
I'd love to see her though went with Hotchner since he is no longer on the show and they could easily explain him being taken by the entity without too much extra explanation
---
Spend the time and do the bones, or don't and roll the dice. Make your choice. No baby survivor main, you don't get both.
---
It‚Äôs definitely an over-used term, but I think you have to look at the meaning behind it. Gen rushing is basically when all the survivors hop on different gens (or all bring toolboxes) and only do gens, instead of cleaning totems or looting chests. Yes, gens are the survivors main objective, but if a survivor only does gens and gets no chase time or unhooks, then they aren‚Äôt going to get many bloodpoints. That‚Äôs why I usually seek out the killer and take aggro for my team if I have already done a gen or two on my own. Plus it makes the game more fun. 
---
And yeah, Ebony Moris are the worst and need to be changed.
---
I literally do this when I want to be tunneled so the rest of my team can work on gens and I can practice being a better runner. Just drop a follow after the game ;D
---
ISN'T RANK RESET THE GREATEST IDEA EVER?
---
I hope nobody freaked out seeing you draw that
---
Yeah but an offering or add-on or something is called cannibal village elder.
---
im waiting to unllock haunted grounds so i can run that with ruin and devour.  have fun guessing
---
NO I WILL FUCKING DIE TO SAVE YOU
---
Doctor obviously he tortured people and I think they were innocent.
---
I‚Äôd have a new survivor to main if this were to happen. I dig the Decoy perk, it‚Äôs like a better Pebble.
---
4 brand new parts = 1 gen, which eliminates 1/5th (20%) of the work needed to do gens
---
Ebony Mori eliminates 8/12 (75%) of the work needed to kill.
---
So you aren't wrong lol. That's it, I'm now officially calling it "Kill Rushing" I love that in the most satirical way lol
---
Instant heals shouldn't even be a thing...
---
Players mistakes shouldn't be negated in a hardcore playstyle.
---
 limited exceptions....
---
That's pretty crutch. Don't get me wrong, I'll probably mess with them down the line as I don't run SC.
---
 Down in the red ranks if I ever get to that place.
---
As killer, Legion and Doctor are both very good bloodpoint farmers. 
---
As survivor, bring WGLF (along with We‚Äôll Make It or Borrowed Time) to get those sweet BP bonuses post-game.
---
Gen rushing does exist. It's when survivors stack perks and items to rush gens as fast as possible. I realize it's the objective, but it can be done "rushing".
---
Hmm that‚Äôs interesting. I didn‚Äôt know that. I wonder if it‚Äôs just referring to her? Who knows.
---
So is trapper
---
Yea he‚Äôs a strong killer for sure but at least 90% of the time you know his build which can be boring. It‚Äôs always ruin, bbq, enduring, spirit fury. What I‚Äôm always afraid of are the add-ons like insta-saw
---
ok this is exactly why I will never get a tat. I would want something like [that](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/b3/12/65b31226f8734af065271c99e101b41b.jpg) and get a tat like this spirit :x
---
Billy imo, looks and his back story are just really sad and his parents kinda deserved it
---
As I've said before, The Entity getting Ash is the equivalent of eating Pufferfish at a fast-food joint
---
Cant agree because the perks to use are so limited (its basicly just prove thyself or maybe stake out) i also think that items are almost equal to killers add ons (i mean ...except for keys ...they are just unbalanced): they help achieving the objective faster. Just take Huntress one-hit hatchets ...same thing in my opinion.
---
trust me, as killer you can make some good stuff to miniminize those loops, or mindgame it
---
But what else am I supposed to do in that context? I'm perfectly happy to not camp if the survivors would let me in on the secret alternate technique for this situation. Any ideas?
---
"Adept Cannibal"
---
I still would love a character who can use trees and walls, like Wendigos from pop culture.
---
I get your point, it just depends on your goal in the game. If your goal as survivor is based entirely on escaping, then yeah just do gens. But you won‚Äôt get as many bloodpoints if that‚Äôs all you do. You need to get into a chase and get some altruism to maximize your BPs each round. 
---
Personally, I play the game to have fun and gain bloodpoints. Escaping is nice but I honestly don‚Äôt care if I die, as long as it‚Äôs a fun round.
---
I agree that totems is an alternative objective. I like how if players take their time to cleanse them, it slows down the game if they decide to. 
---
I don't understand how people waste time on chest to get useless items/lose a perk slot on plunder, but can't cleanse a totem that's in front of them.
---
well, i just wanted to make noed a high reward perk for playing good and for being a good killer, i likes the other version too, i prefier it.
---
No One is sexualizing her, also she‚Äôs fictional so I don‚Äôt know why this is being taken into account.
---
Well, if you like it I guess that's all that matters
---
Thats true and everyone should think like that but lets face it: winning is fun
---
Noice
---
That is a big fact. He‚Äôd just end up looking the same regardless. Now, Trapper on the other hand....he was probably a looker.
---
ok, here is my proof:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxtoDtzerQI : billy
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWexS9Ws88g : huntress
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdgYo-_hXRk : trapper
---
want more proof?
---
Thank you for the video!
---
I body block ppl for like 30s and that's it this is just a dick move
---
People already told you to check the gate, find the other survivors.
---
Or you can play scummy and camp but don't be surprised when people rightly pointed out that you camp. Your don't get to play however you like and not facing repercussion for it. In real life, if you being unfair to someone you also face consequences.
---
Get a good headset
---
The horror aspect of the game will always have a diminishing value the more you play. That‚Äôs just natural, I feel. Now jumpscare Hag and Myers will ALWAYS make me cry like a baby.
---
Haha yeah, you can explain your perspective to them, but you can‚Äôt make them understand.
---
I‚Äôve played against many people with sloppy butcher, yet it‚Äôs never happened to me
---
Okay, that all makes sense. I never thought of trying run backwards during the loops. Thanks!
---
It'd be kinda weird if she turned into a vengeful spirit harboring hate after death because of her own Village's traditions. Also strange the village would make a search party for their own people when they're the one's cannibalizing them.
---
Small game, I like that perk but its range is eh
---
I'm at high ranks and missing some top perks and add ons for many killers. Plus if I buy new killers I'll have to start my bloodweb from 1 back to 40 at the very least to get the teachables and prestige for better add ons so is it not just simpler to give the bloodpoints?
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but whenever someone uses the perk my healing becomes broken, etc, etc. Maybe it‚Äôs just bad timing as well
---
She was definitely older , like around 18. Devs confirmed that every character is above 18.
---
if u look at 12 sec right as u turnt around for the window he was already outside running around the estate
---
Well every time the glitch does occur you can‚Äôt really do any actions
---
Did you read what I said in the post? 
---
Checking the gates will mean my survivor gets unhooked and then everyone escapes. How do I combat that?
---
Small world haha.
---
No. He said that whichever member you play as, Frank will replace them.
---
That‚Äôs another thing I don‚Äôt get, winning before chases and just straight out getting a good grab when you‚Äôre playing stealth killers or spirit from an action punishes you as a player? Why is grabbing even in the game then if it wants you to commit to a long drawn out chase? 
---
This is the same when I‚Äôm playing ghostface and even though I can constantly 4K, I barely even black pip because I just expose people and one shot them with near zero chase. It‚Äôs absurd.
---
Damn. Almost got killed for taking a chance, but good shit
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt see that
---
&gt; so is it not just simpler to give the bloodpoints?
---
So let's just increase the overall BP gain then, and find a different way to enact rank rewards and that way literally everybody wins and gets even more
---
^
---
Many survivors feel entitled to escape.  They will complain no matter what you do, if it results in them getting sacrificed.
---
The proper play here is to patrol-camp, or proxy-camp.  If you have a sacrifice, there's no reason to give it up.  The survivor might not like it, but them's the breaks.
---
The only reason I can see to not do this is if the doors are close together, and you can patrol both doors easily.
---
Baby Dwight‚Äôs are so precious.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
&gt; A child's shoe, long lost in the bog's waters. The trapped life essence within unlocks tremendous potential in The Hag's power.
---
* A child's
---
* Long lost
---
* Trapped life essence
---
Not hers.
---
Honestly, I meant it when I said a better pebble. I have only been able to successfully use pebble as a diversion a couple of times, diversion seems far more useful for my play style.
---
True, but not all loops are mind-gamable (is that a word? It is now..) and some maps have very strong buildings/tiles so even if you play well, they will still get numerous gens done in the time it takes to get that first down. 
---
Obviously it doesn‚Äôt happen like that all the time. This scenario is situational, since there is so much randomness involved in each game.
---
Oh, thought you meant your freddy attempt. I'm surprised, I did old Freddy in one try, too, but cannibal was harder
---
i mean its like when a killer ends a match in under 5 minutes and theres still 5 Gens. Most of the time they don‚Äôt back off bc its going TOO WELL for them unless they were trying adept or are worried about depipping.
---
yeah he easily could‚Äôve gotten a grab
---
And a flashlight :(
---
Bruh like you are high enough rank to know better üíÄ
---
Maybe it was a hidden tradition in their village?
---
Plague is least messed up. 
---
Freddy is most messed up.
---
It also helps that survivors are potatoes
---
Got any neat metal hats to share with others too?
---
Also, some killers are just going to be stronger in loops than others.
---
Typically it is killer shack. That pallet will ALWAYS be god pallet. But as someone else said. There is other god pallets
---
Unless more than one Survivor has Urban Evasion, yeah. They‚Äôre fucked.
---
I love making a big path of Traps leading up the stairs.
---
I‚Äôm pretty apathetic about NOED. I‚Äôll happily trade a NOED nerf for a DS nerf though.
---
You're looking for free bloodpoints with no incentive to actually EARN it and you're calling me entitled. Ok
---
And you are trying to say that I'm essentially alone in my using of the correct verb. Lol. No one said you had to respond to try to refute it and then say that "literally no one" thinks of using bad mouth in that sense. Lol
---
It‚Äôs also pretty luck-based. If you didn‚Äôt know where the basement spawned when you were downed, it‚Äôs pretty unlucky
---
It's not about stretching the resolution really, but using resolutions with more narrow aspect ratios than 16:9, such as 16:10, 4:3, 1:1, etc. Since the game is VERT+/- rather than HOR+/-, doing so increases the vertical FOV, not the horizontal like Shadowborn or Monitor &amp; Abuse, so it's not a free perk per-se, but it's certainly a direct advantage. While it's not awfully impactful in general (e. g. seeing over some obstacles a little better as survivor, or seeing a little more while breaking a pallet or vaulting a window as killer), I do consider it to be real BS and akin to cheating on Nurse, since it allows you to see more during fatigue.
---
But I doubt BHVR will address this. I think they did change the game from HOR+/- to VERT+/- in the past, but it's been 3 years and the game does not even support true fullscreen natively, so why would they go and recode the resolution scaler to be FOV-maintaining... Besides, the only practical way to maintain FOV through different aspect ratios is by having both HOR+/- and VERT+/-, which means players could still use non-standard aspect ratios to potentially gain an advantage, if giving up vertical FOV to attain more horizontal FOV (or vice-versa) is to be considered advantageous. I guess there are the less practical (less visually appealing) ways to maintain FOV by stretching the image to fit different aspect ratios or rendering black bars into the resolution, so there would be a way to address this, but again, it's BHVR.
---
Yes its so good for in fact that you can loop for a long time safely and the killer is forced to break it to keep looping
---
You earn it by playing the game lmao just because the overall points are increased doesn't mean you don't have to do things to get it
---
and yes you're entitles because you do not give two farts and a shit about the player base as a whole at all
---
When is this meme going to die?
---
You only use No one when there is not a reaon for someone to oveereact, in this case the hag and pretty much all killers have a very good reason to be happy when they put someone on the basement.
---
well said
---
Interesting
---
The basement only spawns in one of two places on almost all maps and you will always spawn fairly close to one of those two locations. Just go look real fast.
---
And one clown is a fear inducing demon, the others just a fat alcoholic finger licking dude
---
&gt;or if they are the last survivor left is holding the game hostage.
---
If egc has started, blocking the last survivor in a corner is a perfectly valid strategy to kill them.
---
If they're her only good addons they're not likely to remove them. The may make them less effective, but it's very unlikely they'll completely remove them.
---
Pretty much all killers tunnel and face camp very few don't  let's be honest here.
---
I agree, but to play devils advocate for a moment, nowhere does it say in the game rules/info that winning = surviving. Winning in this game is whatever you make it. I consider it a win if I get over 20k bloodpoints as survivor. Some might consider a win to be gaining a pip. And of course, some might only think they win if they escape. 
---
It‚Äôs all about perspective :)
---
The forest
---
‚Äî real life
---
and not only that, but higher ranks are going to horde the fuck out of expensive bloodweb gear and bust it out during rank reset making it even shittier
---
Be more observant to your surrounding as you walk to the gate. Notice any track marks, use whispers to hear if someone is nearby, use Strider, etc.
---
The only time you shouldn't cleanse, is when ruin is still active. Gens need to be worked on, and the flaming totem, must be destroyed immediately. That's really when all seconds count. Dull totems are the lowest priority at that moment, and so is chest box items.
---
I started looting items from dead survivors. Some of them bring neat things.
---
Almost every single game gives content creators free stuff.
---
Small game is also for traps placad by the killer so i can see why that woulnd't work out
---
They don't "teabag" the killers. Nea's do. Which is why they die first.
---
Two of your answers require I use specific perks. What if the gate is far from the hook?
---
If you verse a good nurse with a third blink add on it‚Äôs a gg
---
Going for a grab is very risky when the door has the 3 lights already.
---
Youre basically giving up around 0.5-1 seconds which could be the difference between a closed and an open door. Going for the lunge hit is way more safe and its a guaranteed hook anyway (if you play around DH, which this freddy didnt)
---
Also the survivor can play around the grab too, letting go the door switch when the killer is in grab range.
---
Tomorrow
---
You're helping them farm though.
---
Honestly it should be two different perks
---
* Detects totems and shows a counter
---
* Detects traps
---
That clarifies nothing
---
Yeah I have, I‚Äôm never sure though but I‚Äôll start a chase and when I down them 3 gens are done and maybe I‚Äôm just bad but I like to think I‚Äôm pretty decent
---
I hate to break it to you but it is likely your PC or internet, the killer is the host
---
This happened to me momentarily when I was playing as the Pig but it pushed me out the pallet after a small bit of time, it's very weird
---
I play a lot of Spirit üòÖ
---
you just fixed this community
---
No you want a handout because either you're not good or you don't play the game as much. If you want what the game has to offer then you have to put the time and work in that's how literally every game works and if you don't like it find another hobby. And to counter your point earlier saying I don't care about the games health the game is 3 years old and still thriving. And that's because of the games grind if there was no grind everyone would be bored after a year like call of duty. The game has long term playability in mind and unfortunately the grind has to co exist with that. If you want everything handed to you go play Minecraft creative mode or something
---
They could still incorporate a counter for totems on it. That wouldn‚Äôt affect Small Game‚Äôs power to warn the player of traps.
---
Hard to detect and only gives a small advantage. Also there may be people who have a stretched resolution for non-malicious reasons (they like ultra wide monitors)
---
Definitely not worth banning IMO
---
Remember to click your flashlight at the killer.
---
Bent-neck lady vibes.
---
This is why I play trapper, that way when toxic survivors stomp in my jaws of death I let them bleed out on the floor. Not my fault they stepped in a trap so far away and I couldn't find them
---
: )
---
Good thing you also get stacks for protection hits and bear traps if its the Trapper.
---
IIRC they recently mentioned they currently don't intend to add a counter
---
Even with that change. I don't see myself running that perk. I have tried it, just not worth a perkslot for my build. 
---
Definitely can work well with some builds I suppose.
---
Let's see the trapper tattoo!
---
r/edgy
---
I was wondering if the Thrill bonus was applied during or post-game. Damn. :/
---
I main Trapper and have had plenty of games where survivors screwed up and 3 genned themselves.  What I don't do is camp 3 gens from the first second of the game to force unengaging 30 minute a piece games.  Beyond weak playstyle with zero consideration for the opponent.  I play both sides so I know how incredibly weak it is to artificially force that situation rather than let it happen on its own.
---
Same here.  It needs to be saved for those last few gens lol.  üíÄ my one friends is like noooo every time someone uses it before then.  He is the inspiration for this picture LOL
---
staying at a hook when gates are powered is not scummy foh
---
I agree. 
---
The issue for me is that when you go against experienced players, they know where totems spawn so they can chunk out all 5 in about a minute if they want. Playing a Hex perk is low odds gambling.
---
My mum was abit concerned lol
---
NOED is balanced you idiot. It counters stupid survivors that like to gen rush.
---
Anyways, thank god they nerfed decisive, that shit rewarded bad gameplay. Also, adrenaline is op pls nerf.
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
---
/s btw
---
LMFAO you can‚Äôt take killer mains seriously, you simply can‚Äôt. What I wrote as sarcasm, most killer mains will think makes an actual argument. They can‚Äôt see how stupid it is to criticize old decisive while defending noed.
---
very sorry some survivors want to advertise themselves while playing a game they enjoy.
---
Nice cosplay üê∑
---
Least messed up is Ghostface in pretty much every way. Mentally developed, not overly brutal, no deformities, intelligent, etc. Most fucked up is... Tough. The Doctor with that Halloween skin probably, but Leatherface is also a contender, and Freddy did used to be a pedophile.
---
I was compelled to make this meme after playing against two people running Object. Neither of them had Self Care, Exhaustion Perks, or the knowledge to run to pallets. Would just see them injured from across the map and walk straight at them while they stared at me before getting a free down.
---
Killed one Object user before even a single gen was done and killed the other one at 4 gens. Hope the other two Survivors enjoyed their 2v1 :)
---
Where is the victory if there is no challenge?
---
If you beat up only baby Dwights, are you actually a good killer?
---
It's not about honor. I'm just reminding you that you play with a handicap when you stream snipe. You totally can do it, just don't get surprised if you do well.
---
 No one is gonna disagree with your logic. All your points are valid and I agree. But it doesn't make it any less of a bitch move. Camping is camping. You can choose to do it or you can choose not to. It's that simple. 
---
If you need a reason to not camp, that's on you.
---
But dont hide behind logic. Admit your camping and take the bitch on the chin.
---
A fan made survivor for the game Dead by Daylight
---
And the next game is a bunch of Rank 20‚Äôs new to the game that you can M1 down.
---
But then you get that oh so satisfying feeling of being sacrificed and still double pipping.
---
ok a recomendation here: leave the chase when a survivor is going to those big buildings, it doesnt worth it, instead go patrol gens or try to find survivors in unsafe zones.
---
Yeah I was trying to let some Claudette escape but she kept running away, looping me, and trying to hide like we were in some chase while the Kate was just kinda hanging out with me so I killed the Claud and let the Kate go.
---
survivors dc when they see u have prayer beads. are u convinced?
---
I was gonna walk around and click my flashlight at people for a video to post but they‚Äôd probably just kill me and that would just be too similar to dbd üòÇ
---
Str8 up bro, depends how far the gates are from another and how far the hook is from a gate, take the 50/50 secure that gate and secure that hook you cant be everywhere but its all about the risk you take, should you try to get more points or kick back with the hook you got and patrol around it. What sucks is this game is high risk little reward game and nobody like that lol.
---
Showing the number of totems wouldn‚Äôt be needed if dull totems made a map-wide sound (without location). Then you could just count them. That should be a base part of the game, not a perk
---
literally no one would use NOED if it had your changes.
---
Legion was massively overnerfed. The only thing that needed changing was the moonwalk exploit and "Nurse for stupid people" multistab. They changed those but also nerfed everything else because Behavior doesn't know how to exercise restraint.
---
It's literally Freddy all over again. Legion only needed a small downwards tweak and instead they beat them half to death with the nerf bat. It's still possible to get a 4k with them but they're very weak and have a bunch of really stupid limitations that don't need to exist.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but you haven‚Äôt played this game long enough, your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter. Everyone that has played this game for more than a week knows that noed activates once the last generator pops, not when the gates are open.
---
You don't get to decide that. Different people have different opinion on what scummy and what is not. I think any situation where you can get an advantage over someone who can't defend themselves is scummy in my eyes.
---
why? literally makes it a great perk, is not an end game perk and its kinda a secured devour hope
---
If addons were more than loosely related to killer lore, that means Myers wears jewelry, a hair bow, and carries around a sleazy letter from his boyfriend. The cannibal village addon is only related to the Hag's background. It doesn't mean she was part of the cannibals.
---
If that happened almost no one would use the trap detecting one.
---
Well, they use Reboot Freddy, so he's a pedophile, which makes him the worst person.
---
The Doctor is probably the most insane, although Wraith makes no sense, as he's a killer because he was upset he killed people.
---
Hag's the grossest.
---
Gen rushing is more of a feeling like the game was not fair. On large maps with a slow killer, it is difficult to get any pressure. One chase can knock out 3 gens. 
---
It is the same as saying killers are OP or survivors keep getting nerfed. 
---
Both are feeling generated by balance issues and lack of alternate objectives. 
---
If they instituted something like the hallowed blight objectives for additional BP or XP, then a bunch of that feeling would go away.
---
I'm not sure about range add ons but it's very likely that they're going to remove extra blinks. What my guess is that they'll remove all extra blink add ons (if not, give her an extra blink add on but make it very rare) and give massive set backs to extra range add ons, and remove the fact that they give you not only extra range, but extra speed.
---
...so how is that the Survivors fault? The Killer has if I recall 14 seconds to move you around, more if they use the Perks. And even worse if there‚Äôs a Gen nearby.
---
You can‚Äôt blame a Survivor for not knowing exactly where the basement was, and for not running away from it.
---
How is it lone objective when you can still check the gate, survey the surrounding. 
---
If you gonna claim statistics them at least show the actual stats.
---
You want to camp, them get ready to face the music. No one likes playing against scumbag.
---
They could give nurse 10 blinks and she wouldn't be scary on mobile
---
Brave should be worth way more, as should taking hits for allies.
---
Although really, just remove the arbitrary caps so people aren't punished for being too altruistic or committing to gens.
---
I've had multiple killers complain about gen rushing. Saying that we were bad players because we rushed the gens, and that's why he camped or tunneled or whatever. It's such a stupid complaint. I'm all for the killers trying to kill us, that's their goal. But it's stupid to get upset over the survivors trying to complete their main goal too.
---
Play Identity V. It is basically this.
---
This is such a garbage post, the bar is so low for memes lately
---
Those yeets were the yeets of a god
---
I was chilling and playing as Trapper last night but a 3 men swf came with and destroyed me with their 2 instant heals and a rainbow map. Got them again next match so I switched to Spirit and got my revenge. I would love to play Huntress more but my aim sucks...survivors can dodge my hatchets so easily :(
---
I've been body blocked for several minutes by killers though. Only got dbd 3 months ago.
---
WAAAAH!
---
You're absolutely fine.  99% of survivors understand the situation when there are no gens left to patrol they are the lone objective left on the map.  Every other survivor will be in a position to escape through the open exit gate OR attempting to make the save.  You leaving just to placate entitled little shits makes no sense.  Only toxic memes of survivors have the balls to bitch about endgame camps.  The lone exception for this is like if the doors aren't even started and you think you got a realistic shot to catch and down another survivor attempting to open.  I'll trade bodies all day but end of the day once a gate is open or nearly opened thats that.  Post up your tent and secure your final kill.  They still got a chance to make a play anyways.  I've gotten my teamates out of that situation countless times over the years.  Borrowed, decisive, dead hard, body blocks they still have a shot to make a play.  Unless it's Bubba then they fucked.
---
I prefer killer Freddy over nonce Freddy
---
The new one gets released in September. You may want to wait. 
---
If not, I would go for Bill. Borrowed time is critical for endgame saves.
---
It's sad that that logic is accurate, but I don't think it was a deliberate design choice so much as just insufficient planning. After all, you can play your main Killer and funnel BP into a new one.
---
It'd sure be nice if they didn't lock Perk slots until level 15, though. What's the point of that? All it does is punish anyone using a new character, or worse, new to the game.
---
Yeah, Hex‚Äôs become a lot less useful as you Rank up. Eventually you‚Äôre better off taking a Perk that can‚Äôt be removed.
---
Even if you defend that one Totem, if they have any kind of SWF it will be gone the next time you pick up and hook someone.
---
Considering that SWF survival rates are about the same as solo, yes it means exactly that

"gj tunnel camping"

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cr8g3g/who_is_the_best_most_fun_and_most_annoying_killer/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That's why totems shouldn't be right next to spawns.
---
But then isn't your entire game plan is based on gen-to-gen play, trying to get grabs or jumps on survivors who can also wisen up to as much and play more carefully, preemtively running or hiding whenever they have heartbeat or whoosh on gens? In chases, MDR can be benifical, but obviously also rather detrimental.
---
I think MDR is best when *combined with* Prayer Beads (or Father's Glasses, which is honestly equally as BS as Prayer Beads). Maybe you have stellar auditory tracking and don't ever need scratchmarks, but I regularly even use Predator on Spirit. I find audio-based tracking to be inconsistent in this game. Plus you regularly have 10+ meters distance to survivors once you actually start phasing anyway, and without scratchmarks you can't even get close enough to hear whether they've made a run for it. Even now after the audio improvements, I mostly use scratchmarks for guidance for my in-Phase tracking, and audio mostly to make some finer or reactive adjustments.
---
The wiki link I just left you is pretty clear explaining what the categories consist of. I‚Äôm not sure what else you want me to say, as I‚Äôve already tried to explain it to you. 
---
Preventing gens from popping at the beginning of the game for a few minutes is a good way to gain emblem progress. Chasing when you can is good, but if you‚Äôre in a chase you can‚Äôt win, don‚Äôt bother. You can always come back and get them because at some point they‚Äôll be in an unsafe area. The game is designed so that the killer has the advantage in chases. Wasting time in a chase you won‚Äôt win after a decent amount of time is allowing survivors enough time to finish gens quickly, which will reduce your own emblem progress. 
---
You also keep obsessing over kills. The kills actually matter less than the accruing of hooks. You want survivors to get unhooks so you can unhook them again because hooks are more rewarding than the actual sacrifice. Camping hooks reduces your amount of points. I always see people say ‚Äúwell I saw scratch marks so why would i leave?‚Äù Leave because if you play well, you‚Äôll benefit more from it. I have pretty consistent, high scoring (and ultimately 4K) games at red ranks, and I‚Äôm not afraid to leave the hook even if I know someone is there ready to unhook. Let them. They‚Äôll most likely stop to heal anyway, which still means they aren‚Äôt on a gen. Also, the more unhooks means the more chases and hits... which means more points and emblem progress and, ultimately, pips. 
---
Idk what your perk build is or what killer you play, but one that revolves around gen prevention is the best. Anything that will push survivors off gens. Depending on what perks you prefer in your build for gen prevention, high mobility killers are better. It‚Äôs also good to remember that the killers abilities are designed differently, and some will get more points for using their ability than others (ex: pig doesn‚Äôt get much deviousness, but nurse gets a lot because her primary mode of movement is her blinks). Try changing up your perks, playstyle, and killers and try maximizing your hooks. 
---
In the end, I‚Äôll reiterate: rank does not matter at all. You should be playing for your own enjoyment. Play how you want to play and forget about rank. Just have fun, man. Fun doesn‚Äôt always mean getting a 4K either.
---
High key bro i play on xbox, and billy is one of the killers i like going against, he seems fair all around bro just get some distance, use lots of windows and be immersed AF cause yeah if he saw you from and distance and you dont see him, he could be chainsaw curving right to you.
---
I face camp with leatherface whenever I see someone with TTV
---
A killer got mad at my team because we wanted to play swf. They refused to play and just hung out in the basement while we got all the gens done. At the end they said we were lame because we were a 4 stack and called us trash. Like, you don't even know if we're trash because you didn't try to play the game. Made me so angry. You can't even play with your friends because killers will refuse to play against you because they're scared they're gonna lose? WTF?
---
Unless you trap everyone, though, that won't accomplish anything except for boring two Survivors to death at your own expense.
---
And I have less sympathy for SWFs raiding the basement as a team.
---
Besides, aren't the stairs usually too wide to bodyblock?
---
Get yourself Kate. Dance with me Combined with Lithe and quick and quiet is pretty good to loose the killer :)
---
Yup. Guessing most random groups are using their echolocation to coordinate.
---
I think this game is balanced in its unbalance. Some games favour the survivors and others favour the killer. It depends on too many factors, including but not limited to: 
---
- Map RNG
---
- SWF or solo queue
---
- perks/offerings brought in
---
- each player‚Äôs experience and play style 
---
Devs will never be able to make the game perfectly balanced. It won‚Äôt happen. Because the outcome to each round depends heavily on all the above factors.
---
So my advice is to just play the game for fun and don‚Äôt be mean to others.
---
They said in a recent ama that they‚Äôre considering adding a totem counter and mentioned that they don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll add it to small game, implying that they might add it.
---
&gt;. Every Nurse returns to hooks.
---
An honest question, do people actually get mad at killers when they return to the hook? I do it all the time, but I don't tunnel. Even if a survivor farms their teammate in front of me and I have the opportunity to kill them, I swing at the unhooker. As long as I don't tunnel, I don't see a problem with returning to the hook?
---
There it is, dont hate me for this but PC dbdl is vastly different to console and you see it in the players
---
More like get out
---
*People already told you to check the gate, find the other survivors" are we reading the same thread? Lol every comment I've seen except ONE has said yes, in this situation, you should camp.
---
He actually is on this subreddit and comments on things frequently. Your post/comment history is cancer by the way, well done.
---
Standard matchmaking abuse at work here.
---
Ohhh okay
---
How is it unfair to the killer?  You want to win using an advantage that survivors don't have. If he leaves the hook, at least the survivor has fighting chance. If he doesn't then they don't. So who's being unfair here? Especially given that killers are faster and have tracking ability.
---
You won't have to complain about DCs if people stop playing altogether because of shit like this. I struggle to understand how people on this sub and some streamers fail to realize this. Making the experience for the other part as miserable as possible (killer or survivor) will only cause people to get bored of DBD, as it has been happening already. Dedicated Servers won't force me to go through a miserable experience, have fun in that 3v1 match.
---
Jeff for distortion and aftercare.
---
Indiana Jones
---
Someone told me "I can't believe you said that" when I pointed this out. Fanboys or just dumb?
---
Anyways even though it's 100% developers fault it doesn't mean you can't have any personal responsibility. I don't run instahelas everygame because I know it's unfair, I didn't use old BNP everygame because I knew that was unfair, same for ebony mori's or when Trapper used to be able to put traps underneath the hooks. Some people use crutches and others don't and I respect people who don't 10x more thn the people who do, the end.
---
or you could just bring pop goes the weasel lol, or slugging, you can still go to the easy target
---
The rulebook that the survivors come with for killers to follow has two major uses: paperweight and kindling.
---
Slugging is fine. It's annoying, but nothing wrong with it, especially since there are perks revolving around it.
---
I was expecting pre-Hag to look more... black? She looks white.
---
You must be a pretty miserable person lol
---
The Entity puts the survivors through trials endlessly while it gets the Killers to put on a show for its twisted game.
---
It is possible for killer mains to think NOED is a no skill crutch perk which it is.  It isn't just survivors that think so little of it.  I feel the same way and was a killer main for the longest time before becoming more of an even 50/50 player.  It teaches horrible habits and does nothing to teach a killer the skills they'll need to defeat strong teams of survivors.  Learn to apply aggressive gen pressure and chase intelligently and you don't need that trash on any of your killers.  I used to stomp swf groups on Coldwind with Old Freddy sans babycrutch so I know it isn't necessary.
---
I don't see any issue with prox camping during the endgame. It's shit like what I ran into last night, where I was playing against a Clown who managed to kill my one friend and a rando, then downed my other friend and stood over him while he slugged, hoping I'd come out to get my boi, which I eventually did, then downed me and hooked me, face camping and hitting me the whole time. He explained this behavior by saying I was "an immersed shit and a bad teammate who did nothing" (I spent the majority of the game saving my teammates from hook and trying to find the Ruin totem and pipped up from my play). That's bad camping imo.
---
I understand what you are saying, i think it just comes down to defining ‚Äúbitch move‚Äù. 
---
I define it as something you do that is cheap, completely unnecessary, and done just to annoy someone else. 3 criteria for me. 
---
Camping at endgame does not meet the unnecessary or malicious criteria, but is cheap (easily implemented with little skill). So for me it doesn‚Äôt meet that. 
---
If your definition differs, then you are correct that camping could qualify based on your definition.
---
My bad, dude what you said seemed future tense with also mentioning leaving a lobby so naturally I assumed based on that statement.  And also I completely disagree.  Killer is being an ass you play it out rather than screw over your teammates.  Might suck but at least you don't ruin everyone else's match in the process.  This is a team based game...survivor DC  for ANY reason they screw over their teammates.  Like if you were the goalie fir a hockey team and an opposing player calls you a poopy face, and you get frustrated and butt hurt and quit.  Now your team has no goalie, but hey ...screw them ...at least that guy cant call you poopy face again because you left and you'd team is hanging high and dry and down a goalie.  If a player cant finish matches due to butt hurt, emotional distress anxiety, fear of frustration, vaginal discomfort or any other reason, then that person should not be playing multi player team based games.  Period.  That's the whole point.  That's why there is a way to report it (though ineffective it may be), Because there aren't supposed to be people playing that can't handle finishing a match when others are counting on them to play it out.
---
&gt; If you are assuming they are going to be toxic before the match even starts then I think you are the problem, not them having .ttv in their name.
---
Disagree.  There is like at least a 90% chance of them spewing toxicity and non-ironically quoting the Survivor's Rulebook for Killers.  Add in SWF and you may as well bump it to 99.
---
You see the irony in this comment? Why would you even post this unless you're a really angry person.
---
still not broken
---
Sorry could you reword that?
---
What's the point of this video?
---
Yup, there are always going to be changes that need to be made. Ebony Moris are at the top of that list, for me. Although Myers Tombstone is a close second. 
---
But I see the point of your post and thought it was solid, so figured I‚Äôd respond.
---
Least Messed up : Adiris (Plague), she never killed anybody, spreading infection wasn't some thing she did consciously. Even in game, she is killing alien looking beings (a 4000BC woman in a perpetual 1980's world) for what she believes are her Gods' orders.  
---
Most Messed Up:  Herman Carter, nobody forced him, nobody tortured him. Govt. only enabled him to carry out his experiment and he went real nuts with it. Like, really, really bad nuts. And killed about a hundred of people.
---
Lol me saying a killer has a right to defend a kill with zero objectives left on the map is me being entitled?  Dude you sound like a cartoon right now.  You aren't entitled to a free escape with no objectives left sweetheart.  Honestly it isn't a guaranteed kill either unless they're playing Bubba.  Do you have any idea how many facecamped survivors I execute a nice play to save endgame regularly?  We got borrowed, decisive, dead hard, body blocks.....git gud and make a play and earn that shit man.  The killer isn't going to just give it to you for free in that scenario nor should they be expected to.  It's up to you to make a play or just leave.
---
A great Nurse. A player who knows how and where to blink is the worst to go up against. But a good Spirit with good addons is a close second.
---
THIS SENTIMENT IS ONLY ACCEPTABLE IF YOU BRING BORROWED TIME LIKE A DECENT HUMAN BEING
---
If you're meming my favorite thing with pig is while crouched making the oink/roar sound
---
yeah I think he was honestly lost as hell and couldn't believe what happened and then got lucky and ran into you
---
Main thing I'm wondering is if we'll get any teases/reveals about the upcoming chapter.
---
That‚Äôs an... unfortunate face
---
Almost certainly
---
If you look closely at all the characters, 80% of them have an anatomy issue you can‚Äôt unsee after noticing it.
---
Probably Doctor, Plague and Legion due to their power
---
Removed - Uncivil
---
I stopped because of it especially smurfs on low levels I can go up in ranks with people knowing all the tactics is hard to get good enough to beat them so I have given up for the moment.
---
Yes I want to in the future
---
All your posts are just complaining about dead by daylight, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the angry one here.
---
Doctor and legion for me. I love going against the rest.
---
You seem to forget that toolboxes mixed with prove thyself can make a gen complete within a minute. 
---
Gen rushing is a thing. Not saying ERmAhGerD StOp doIng gEnS sO fASt! Because I understand that it's an objective. Disagree all you like, but statistical facts are there. Downvote away.
---
PC killers can simply check survivor‚Äôs friend lists and many do exactly that
---
Well don't use NoED on Killers i'm familiar with, i do use it on killers i'm newly trying out though (If i have it) i don't want to de-rank accidentally and face players that are under my skill level.  
---
But everything is kinda fucked because of Rank reset right now, so i don't run it period
---
Definitely Nurse.
---
Although to be fair, it depends more on the play style of the person playing the killer. I‚Äôve played against Doctors, Legions, and Wraiths who were terribly annoying, even though none of them are considered top tier killers.
---
Both survivors and killers get salty to be fair.... I've had killer accuse me of being toxic cause i kept stunning them at pallets and then I get survivors that say I tunnel cause their team won't tank hits for them and just hide while leaving them out in the open
---
Wow, did you just accept my difference of opinion without being a dick. Much appreciated. X
---
You're right it's totally down to individual definition. Hence the ongoing argument above us.
---
Of course : 0 )
---
Sounds good then i remember no one ever does totems anymore :)

Ok so say you get to rank 2-5 and gain 75% then a blood hunt gives you 100% add a party streamer for 275% you will be walking out with near 70k for a bad match. I personally think that is to much for a match all the time. Some of the fun is playing to the mil points and spending it. At the same time I do not think bonus blood points are the reason why people would want to play high ranks. It's just an award for doing so. I try for high ranks (I am terrible tho) to get a harder challenge with a decent team  of course it's gona be hard with potatoes.
---
If he beats out Steve I'm boycotting any monitary purchases full stop.

And noed  as standard but it last all game
---
These would work but their not very fresh and they remove addons and have the potential to be OP since theres always no reason to disarm traps since its tuna reset in 30 seconds.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cr8xu3/i_absolutely_love_this_game/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Of course it's not always going to be in your favour all the time. And the answer to your question is 50/50. I've seen killer actually secure two kills because they check the gate instead of camping. And by trading you know what happens?  More people stay in the game and healing, giving you more chance to get kills.
---
You have nothing of substance to offer my dude.  You aren't making any effort to invalidate my points because you know you got nothing.  Literally your entire defense rests on nothing more than personal feelings of entitlement.  Enjoy being needlessly salty to killers in that all too common situation.  I'm sure your post game chat is a joy to be in lol.
---
Least is wraith, dude wasn‚Äôt even killing willingly, just doing his job destroying cars which happened to have people in them, though he did kill his boss when he found out. 
---
Most messed up I‚Äôd say might be doctor, as he was a torturer and loved it. Definitely a few screws loose in his head
---
That would be undoubtedly broken
---
that's fair, i'm personally not bothered by ebony moris, but they're definitely very unbalanced and i don't blame anybody for wanting them gone.
---
Thatd be balanced.
---
A+++ content! Nice job :)
---
dude. print these are stickers. these are cool as hell.
---
Had a really good feng  loop me for like 3 gens last night. Decided enough is enough and switched to a weaker survivor, hooked them and the feng obviously got mad I dropped the chase because she came over to take a hit before I hooked. Decided to go back to the feng since I knew she was injured and ended up downing her thru a window and she insta dc before I can ever pick up. Like ok? You looped me for 3 gens almost 4 but we‚Äôre mad I finally got you? ... ok....
---
Is legion good? Hah. No. (Do I still play them? Yes.) 
---
My advice for playing them though, when chasing one survivor use your power to get first hit, then try and read where they‚Äôre running and use your speed to cut them off, making the recovery time of frenzy less punishing 
---
Deep wounds are an absolute joke so don‚Äôt expect them to do anything game changing
---
Doctor. I can't play stealthy agaisnt him. What's a game of hide and seek when the seeker has the complete upperhand?
---
Items are there to get an advantage in doing gens or other things and of course you can combine them with some perks to make them even more profitable. You can also run bbq&amp;chilly with an speed saw build with billy to kill survivors even faster or something like that. Thats how the game is. I think both things i just mentioned arent unfair. But i dont call the billy with great perks and add ons "kill rushing". Thats silly. No, i dont thing thats "gen rushing"
---
More like when the killer picks you up but the ping is really bad.
---
Edgy "survivors hate me" flair &gt; still has ochido living rentfree in his head 24/7 because he got stomped by him once or something.
---
I like to go for the "Username420" or "Username69" personally.
---
i fucking love these type of posts oskckcnfküò≠
---
Would just be nice to punish swf for using third party comms while giving other users a way to communicate.
---
I think a change is necessary for Ebony Moris now. My idea would be that you can only use them after hooking EVERY survivor once. That way they still have power, but the killer can‚Äôt just tunnel the first person they hook and get them out of the game as quickly. Seems it would be much more balanced.
---
I mean iri hatches is broken and does not take skill lets face it.
---
I play a lot of legion in the past then the nation of the baby survs attack
---
Literally me
---
Which is broken
---
Looks like ancient Jane
---
This reads like a complaint about old Freddy
---
Freddy and Hag
---
I faced him on xbox once. He didn't do so well. I almost dc'd because I was scared he'd turn me into a pedophile.
---
@vladdasocialist
---
Yes it won't always be on my favour, but  if all the generators are done I'm already at a disadvantage, and you're telling me to actively choose to put myself in an even more unfavorable position, on a possibility. I'd rather secure what I have than be greedy and potentially lose it. The problem with survivors is they feel entitled to having EVERYONE survivor. Everyone's not going to escape just accept that
---
I‚Äôll probably post them on my tumblr which I never use. Or maybe my instagram. Tumblr is suspiciouscorvid
---
As killer you can slap the survivor right after hooking to cut the scream short. A little BM from the survivor's eyes but with no intention from the killer's part.
---
Freddy is most op, leather face has best perk. Pig isn't that good tbh . Ghostface is pretty solid
---
How many times are you gonna respond to me and then delete your comment lmao. Seems like every other person in this thread agrees so :/
---
Neither is yours. Your point is regurgitating the same BS that doesn't hold up if you actually play without resorting to scummy tactics. Also, people who accuses others of toxic post game chat are usually the one who does it. Unlike you,  I don't use the chat. I just write down the players name and make sure I don't play with them again whenever possible.
---
Feng can feng my meng anytime
---
I think it's totally unreasonable to expect players to follow arbitrary rules (arbitrary because only you could know them) regarding things that help them win the game. That just breeds toxicity because everybody gets upset at everybody else for using mechanics that are intended.
---
It's fine to hold yourself to a standard based on your values, but when you start punishing others for not following your rules you've gone way too far
---
When the series is done I'm going to make stickers!
---
Ur mom
---
This happened to me the other day, but the killer disconnected. Imagine my disappointment as those 0's flashed across the screen
---
I totally agree with everything you're saying. I mainly play survivor and I do think there are some crutches in the game that really give killers a leg up (not that they don't already have a leg up, but it gives them even MORE power) and I think that going to the devs is the right answer. 
---
It is frustrating though when you get every killer for the night running Hex: Ruin over and over, it starts to seem like it's more of a killer mentality than it is a dev problem. But bringing it up to the devs is definitely the best solution to the issue.
---
As a side note, and this is just my personal opinion, but I feel that a perk like Hex: Ruin should be an offering instead of an actual perk. That way killers don't have the ability to use it EVERY game, but it still adds that extra level of difficulty to the survivors from time to time. It just gets so exhausting and has become a joke across my friends every time we enter a game. And yes there is a way to get around Hex: Ruin without finding the totem, but at times it seems like the killer is just using it so they don't have to work as hard. Again, that's just my personal opinion.
---
&gt; What's a game of hide and seek
---
oh dear you're one of those
---
That's seen as very toxic behavior though so I prefer not to do that.
---
I also find that alt+4 works amazing when getting hooked
---
I have made so many friends by entering a lobby with survivors and popping in pre-game saying glhf, and then I lurk their stream for a few mins.
---
Or, even better back when killer queues weren't hell on Earth regardless of rank, I'd poo in, way glhf, nearly mute stream and tab out, play the game then pop back. If there's a vod I'll rewatch my killer play from their perspective. But almost all of the streamers I've done that with I've fostered some sort of good connection.
---
And then one cunt saw me, instantly assumed I was gunna be some cunt troll and banned me on the spot. He was a massive bitch, lost to ruinless hag pre-buff. Epic.
---
That‚Äôs a up vote. your so talented that‚Äôs amazing drawing
---
a killer with basic chase mechanics cannot be OP. You just can't loop
---
Right. Judging from that comment, I can see that you have NPD. Should have suspected it sooner. Sorry but I got nothing to wish you as I don't like you and I don't want to pretend by offering take pleasantries.
---
That's "the game" for me
---
Why do people use that atrocious headpiece?  
---
Beanie or nothing.
---
But Jeff is John. And Jesus.
---
Ghost face is the most messed up because he‚Äôs the only human (Micheal I don‚Äôt count as human since he‚Äôs described as pure evil) who isn‚Äôt twisted into killing by a mentor or the entity and the least is the legion excluding Frank they just had a shitty nutball friend who forced them into murder
---
That's a really risky build, I get where its the prime in there but oh god I find it very situational and pretty good snowball also. Thanks for the advice ! Been switching the 4 perk actually. 
---
Ruin, Bbq, Nurse Calling ( Thana, Haunted Gr, sometimes Slopy, )
---
Then don‚Äôt look for the totem
---
Lol what rank are you? At around 10 people become decent enough they can loop Freddy a bit. And it gets worse and worse for him the higher in the ranks you ascend.
---
You saying Feng isn‚Äôt enough of a badass already?
---
Freddy is not OP lmao, people just don‚Äôt know how to play around him yet lol
---
Cheating? Thonk
---
- Paid
---
He knows *something* is fucked up with his situation. He sounds scared out of his mind!
---
i'd say hag is the most annoying, as she can "camp" the hook while being 40m away
---
All my friends hear is horrible stuff about the game, but I play it obsessively.
---
The killer is only toxic if the person playing them is toxic
---
Ash From Evil Dead is the chosen one who's destiny is to protect humanity from evil.
---
No, it means going after one person the entire time until they are dead, no matter the situation. 
---
Example: played against a Clown who hooked my friend, then went off to a gen across map and hit someone there. So I unhook my friend because the killer should be occupied, but he immediately comes back to the hook. I try to take a hit, but he manages to get past me and downs/hooks my friend again. This is tunnelling. 
---
Hope that cleared things up :)
---
No, that would look really bad, plus you aren't supposed to know which totem is which
---
I think sally (aka. Nurse) because she has gone through mental trauma and harrassment from other patients... If you think of that in depth, that's pretty depressing and Brutal.
---
Decoy plus Adam‚Äôs perk (I don‚Äôt remember but he throws a pebble) can be a super combo. Imagine if you use decoy on a window and throw the pebble inside the building to make it seems like you went further.
---
Does Turtle Egg really make it last 8 Seconds? 
---
Damn. I have like 33 of them I never use because I didn‚Äôt know the exact time it increased.
---
From a perk/gameplay standpoint I'd say Pig. 0 terror radius when crouched, Pigs will tunnel survivors with party hats on, MYC is Hook NOED until actual NOED pops with 95% of Pig mains.
---
Ghost face but only because his stalk power can be pretty broken when it comes to breaking the stalk
---
It takes most of a match worth of stalking to charge and gives next to no bloodpoints.
---
Hey, what about my man [Ryan Hurst](https://cimg.tvgcdn.net/i/2018/08/27/531e9534-5e48-4e65-b6f1-cf2396954e2f/a52310f4c540218938f832caf18260be/180827-ryan-hurst.jpg)?

---
Yo that's nice
---
I thought it was if you only get the special edition
---
So its jane
---
I agree with you, at higher ranks it does seem like gens get finished very quickly. But I've had nights in the 13 or 14 ranks where all the killers run ruin, which just makes the game so frustrating because you have new players who can't hit the skill checks. I think it might be a good idea to make gen time a bit longer to make killers feel better about not running ruin every game. I haven't gotten to that high of a rank, 7 is the lowest I've gotten to, but it just seems like every game is an endless search for a hex ruin.
---
Its good that his kit draws out the game and his powers are quite cool. I just feel like games are uneventful against him
---
I just use green Moris on laggy survivors because I don't feel like dealing with that shit. Like alright man, you're warp-sliding around like a crazy version of Gumby, you're gettin' ejected.
---
My trapper build is third seal,bloodhound,lullaby,and whatever you want
---
...
---
Just a little drinky poo
---
I'm curious to think why it would be bad I don't see any thing wrong with knowing your totems
---
This contains the same amount of actual points you offered up in your previous comments.  Thank you for not disappointing.
---
Well...Pretty much EVERY character besides Michael, Ghostface, The Doctor, The Pig (debatable) and Freddy had REALLY traumatic childhood/lives/events that turned them into "monsters". Even Leatherface, as disturbing as his story is, is kinda sad because he was mentally challenged and he only killed to "protect" his family. So...
---
Most: Michael
---
Least: The Plague (hers isn't revenge or bloodlust) 
---
Saddest: The Spirit but the The Hillbilly's story is actually pretty sad too
---
Scariest: Prolly Leatherface or Doctor bc of the torture
---
Spirit and Hag.
---
The Clown, his mori is disturbing because he cut the survivor‚Äôs finger and suck on it.
---
I saw that bottom part of her dress as balls and now I can't unsee.
---
On some maps its not as bright as it usually seems to be, like this one. I only noticed it was ruin because I looked out for the little glow at the bottom.
---
Oh I see! That completely makes sense
---
I used to think like this but after playing survivor for over a thousand hours, killers humping their totems are extremely boring to go against. At least when they have multiple totems with TOTH they can't choose which one to hump effectively. 
---
Say they have TOTH, Ruin and Haunted Grounds, they would hump TOTH and Ruin while allowing the other two to be cleansed.
---
Can always get more!
---
Sorry, but that picture reminds me of the evil CEO in the Brandon Rogers video's
---
Doctor
---
Hag
---
Ayyy
---
I thought you're done but I guess you lie just about everything,eh? Classic NPD case.
---
When killers bring secondaries to the game it gets so much more complex, ie. Plag, Pig, Freddy. I like that aspect but it doesn't allow for a wide range of killers because if those things are good there are only so many iterations of, "walk over to this thing and complete it to not get screwed" you can have in a game concept this simple. 
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
---
No classic Freddy wasn't but he was a child murderer. Only the remake Freddy was a nonce
---
You mean get INTO low ranks
---
Bro just read the lore lol. She gets captured *by* a cannibal village
---
Song?
---
It's for the naughty bees
---
I hate the glitch.
---
Video games cause violence. Me just trying to escape from the shooter (Huntress throwing hatchets)
---
Endgame chat was probably all of them calling you a hacker
---
That system only purpose is to encourage depipping as killer, bc on lower ranks you need less emblems to double pip.
---
Hag, Ghostface, Spirit.
---
Hag because she's designed to camp, pretty good job so far btw.
---
Ghostface because his counterplay is half-assed and he's just a better Myers in every way possible, Myers was already balanced so fill in the blanks what ghostface is.
---
Spirit because she's overpowered and doesn't require much skill to be overpowered.
---
I can hear the messages now
---
Gg. 
---
Good killer
---
I deserved that
---
I love this game
---
Ok
---
Rancor, bloodwarden, BBQ and chilli &amp; NOED.
---
It's actually decent tbh.
---
You do you tho.
---
I mainly play survivor, so I guess I'm coming at it from one perspective. I don't doubt that at really high ranks the gens get completed super fast and I'm not saying there isn't a need for ruin, but it does seem like it's required at this point. I haven't gotten to that high of a rank, 7 is my highest. But even in lower ranks killers will run it with newer survivors, which seems like overkill to me. But again, it is just my opinion and I'm not saying it should be removed from the game. But if something were to change to make it so killers don't feel the need to use it I think that would make things more balanced.
---
Crouching wont activate her trap ya know
---
Is it not so that thou art new.
---
Thou fared well to find me.
---
But cometh thee not for the grave of Sir Artorias?
---
My advice true, forget this!
---
The legend of Artorias art none but a fabrication‚Ä¶ Traversing the dark? 'Tis but a fairy tale.
---
Have thine own respect, go not yonder knocking for nothing, I say!
---
you are a psycho just accept what we are in common
---
Just crouch
---
Instead of a terror radius, what if he had the static interference noise?
---
They related with her innocence towards the whole ordeal
---
I play a lot of Hag, so once that 3-Gen Strat kicks in, the game starts to stagger with 1-2 Gens left. I‚Äôve had a 3-Gen last literally 45 minutes.
---
Doc just annoying to play against
---
It doesn't make sense for killers to complain about gen rushing because it's your only objective, what else are you suppose to do?
---
Lol you are legit pretty classic man.  Came here to say camping bad in endgame provides zero intelligent argument to support their point then resorts to petty insults and accusations of mental illness.  You're not unique man.  Just a textbook toxic survivor man.  Play both sides and you'll understand.
---
Is "groovy" his catchphrase?
---
&gt;I run Rules No. 2 with Amanda's secret :)
---
So you jumped into the conversation to announce to everyone that you waste a whole lot of time doing nothing just to go chase someone that just got a trap off their head.
---
Flair checks out.
---
Yes.
---
He's a pedophile, might as well be highfiving freddy!
---
B U T T H O L E  C L E N C H E D
---
For most messed up I would say Freddy, I mean he was a child rapist, and for least messed up maybe Wraith because the first person he killed was his boss(Who worked for the Mafia and made The Wraith kill hundreds of people without him even knowing it)
---
Omfg, I'm gay; but piggy can Fuck me up anytime üòòüòÖüòÇ
---
They should still look just a little off tho. Partially for the gameplay but mainly because this is the entity‚Äôs realm
---
If you gain pleasure from causing misery to others that really says a lot about you :(
---
We at least might get a glimpse of how they looked when the Archives get added to the game!
---
Yeah they have buttons for eyes and a sewn mouths.
---
I can understand  that, near 10 and higher can end up like that a lot, i notice it as killer and survivor where gens just will not get done with ruin up. Seems we agree that it'd be good to re-balance how fast the game is and then maybe rework ruin after that so it's not so needed. because at this point ruin seems like a base mechanic to keep games not so short
---
welp, its okay to loose
---
And you are the one who thinks I'm delusional. But here your are assuming I never play killer. Lol. Typical gaslighting technique.
---
Nothing in particular, it just happens a lot when I play Killer.
---
I‚Äôll hit someone, down them in the first minute, and then they‚Äôll D/C.
---
Whatever, I‚Äôll keep playing like normal and finally when the game ends, the person who D/C‚Äôd stayed there the entire time just to wait and call me ‚Äútrash‚Äù or whatever, it‚Äôs just petty.
---
In that allotted time, they could have searched and found a new game.
---
it is noit situational if you are playing a good match
---
I think Wraith is the least messed up, he killed one dude because he never wanted to kill anyone and now he‚Äôs gotta kill everyone because the entity picked him up.
---
Ive only had 1 game where claudette did the gens. She did all of them while the rest of my team was in a locker and i was running from gf
---
Yeah, people talk down on stealth but to evade the killer completely *and* be a clear benefit to your team should be rewarded more. Especially since if you're team is pretty good, it's hard to be altruistic and that kind of just forces you into a chase (which can be good, especially if you haven't been hooked yet).
---
God damnnit... I'm never not going to be thinking about that from now on.
---
'The Nurse' is gorgeous!  Glad you're making stickers, these are great.
---
...That's still situational
---
i hate relying on noed to win my games. its a cheap and skilless a
---
way to win a match
---
I meant low ranks as in lower skilled ranks. IE, most online games use a bronze/silver/gold/diamond/whatever system, I would refer to bronze/silver as "low ranks" even though there are no numbers.
---
The number rank system in this game def make that unclear and I should probably start saying something else.
---
I only care about gameplay itself and getting better/ being skilled and not one bit about grinding so ye dbd is not the best game for me.
---
not really in my games
---
I thought you had Blood Warden for a sec (because I‚Äôm a survivor main so I forgot). That would‚Äôve been so cruel.
---
Three words: BBQ and Chili
---
Do what?
---
So like what happened
---
rightfully so!
---
8.8 seconds Indeed. 
---
https://youtu.be/9CQLh1atAPU 10:43 is the time stamp.
---
That movie is a classic between me and my family
---
Nurse has the ability to sort of soft teleport. She can stop at any point and swing, but the downside is that she‚Äôs actually slower than survivors normally (only killer that is slower than survivors) and after her second blink she slows down heavily for a second.
---
But if you put add ons for her, you can increase the range or number of blinks that she has or both. For PC players, the quick camera speed that a mouse gives makes her extremely deadly with 2 blinks on good players. With more blinks, she becomes extremely hard to play against on good players and she becomes hard to play against on bad players. Console Nurse is far less scary because camera speed is slow, though with add ons anyone can become more frustrating.

You mean shroud of seperation right? Right guys? I can hope right?
---
Yeah I definitely think we are on the same page with that! It's nice to feel like I can have an actual discussion with someone without people getting rude or angry over an opinion. It's a breath of fresh air from some of the other threads I've seen on Reddit.
---
It can be a bad game but still have fun moments that keep you coming back.
---
A bit of context MIGHT be helpful here..
---
You actually lose points if they get downed
---
I leaned through a YouTube video, I‚Äôm still kinda bad at it.
---
I saved her from hook and she can see my aura with aftercare. When there are 2 gens and 2 survivors left, she was downed and I was close by the save her. Then she wiggles off the killer and pointed out to the killer where I am. So I started to hide from the killer while she is doing the gen. Apparently she is working with the killer at this point. I couldn‚Äôt do any gen because she pointed out my location 3 times to the killer. Finally she repaired the last 2 gens and powered up the gate. But she didn‚Äôt power it up all the way and blocked the gate so that I can‚Äôt open the gate either. And keep pointed to the killer where I ran. Eventually I got caught and hooked. She completed the gate power up and escaped right away as soon as I got hooked.
---
P.S I have saved 3 survivors and repaired 2 gems prior to this. I have no idea why would this dick do this to other survivors
---
I‚Äôve never read her lore but my god it‚Äôs terrifying. Thank you for making me want to read all the lores.
---
bHVR said that they were gonna add that later on in the year
---
On many occasions I get accused of being swf when I‚Äôm solo, just cause the team is coordinated.
---
you are aware you're not allowed to shame other survivors on this subreddit right? there's literally only 9 rules here
---
Billy for me
---
It's a really good movie.
---
Can‚Äôt post a pic with context. I made a comment below to describe the situation
---
Exactly, it's kind of ridiculous the stuff that players will get mad about in this game. Of course I find myself frustrated at it too, but I understand the objective of the game and I don't get upset about people completing the main goal of the game. Whether that be killing or surviving.
---
Yes, we can see all of that just from this screenshot...
---
Don't name and shame others, even if you had video. If you think they were working together, record, report them in-game and send the footage to DBD's support team.
---
Wellp, time to start using the 33 I have stocked away.
---
WHY IS THE RAGE WEDNESDAY THREAD STILL STICKIED 2 DAYS LATER ON FRIDAY?
---
I think its entirely playstyle dependent. Any killer can be fun and any killer can be annoying. Face camping and toxic postgame chat is what drives me crazy.
---
Sounds like a report to me!
---
Well... maybe you would decide to camp the Hex: Ruin and leave the Haunted Ground unattended so the survivors would get exposed.
---
It‚Äôs in the comment. You guys are too fast. I can‚Äôt finish typing lol
---
It's still really good
---
Head-on? (Apply directly to forehead)...always helps me out against Nurse
---
This is what I think about when I see people on here complaining daily about getting SWF every single match.
---
Maybe it was just a good group of survivors instead of always being SWF.
---
Probably should have got a better tattoo though.
---
I don't mind, if it means the asshole "team"mate doesn't get their points.
---
She is being a 100% jerk. No one should be in a match with someone like that. Read the comment and tell me you won‚Äôt shame someone like that
---
Same to you!
---
That's me as survivor.
---
About 2.5 million is my guess. Cant be precise because of the nature of the bloodweb, but 1 million will get you to 30ish.
---
I DC only In cases when ping was Green, but I teleport the entire map
---
A load of OP offerings for killers and absolutely nothing for Survivors. They can have 3 of these per game?
---
&gt;-(Rare) Mural of Corruption: Greed - Survivors within a 16 meter range of each other increase their consumption rate by **70%**. Item Art: The twisted off wing of a crow with the severed end dipped heavily in blood.
---
70% on items like medkits. You wont even be able to use half of them once.
---
&gt;-(Very-Rare) Mural of Ruination: Decay - Reduce Survivor repair speed **to 40% of base stat**. Item Art: The rotting severed head of an owl with moss growing out of it is attached to a snapped humerus bone.
---
Doing generators at 40% of their intended speed? Sounds like fun for the survivors.
---
&gt;-(Very-Rare) Mural of Affliction: Hypothermia - An unearthly cold from nowhere causes all survivors to suffer hypothermic conditions. At the start of the trial all progression speeds are hindered by 10% with an extra 10% for each passing minute it is active to a **maximum of 70%.** Item Art: An antler of some large deer.
---
All progress speeds. This means things like mending, waking up, cleansing. Everything. Nice.
---
&gt;-(Ultra-Rare) Mural of Torment: Trapped - **This Mural does not appear until after all generators are completed or there is one Survivor remaining; whichever comes first. The exit gates and the hatch are blocked off for 100 seconds.** Only needs to destroy 1 Mural. Item Art: A severed fragment of the Entity itself festering with lesions.
---
So a more OP bloodwarden which will completely kill any chance of the last survivor getting the hatch and punish them for absolutely nothing the Survivor has done.
---
I don‚Äôt think that was it‚Äôs ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù the devs would put something in the game for the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of encouraging depipping. 
---
I do agree it is easier to get adept at a lower rank, but it‚Äôs also easier to rank up at lower ranks, and they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpurposely‚Äù make it that way to encourage depipping either, it‚Äôs supposed to get harder as you get higher in rank.
---
The adept system was made to challenge players to use the core abilities and also get a merciless killer rank, to get that you need to run a almost perfect game.
---
CAN WE PLEASE FUCKING FIX BODY BLOCKING IN THIS GAME?!!?! IF I GOT FUCKING BODY BLOCKED BY ANOTHER FOUR MAN SWF I'M GOING TO LITERALLY SHIT MY PANTS IN FRUSTRATION. FUCK YOU FOUR MAN ASH GROUP
---
Owning all of them the most fun i have is with ghostface. More stealth based killers are my jam not to big on pig though. Interesting mindgames with GF nightshroud such as when moonwalking on loups using his power to get rid of the red light killers have catches people out all the time
---
About 1.3-1.4 million. 1 million buying the cheapest options on the bloodweb gets you to about level 39 or so. If you're buying purple and pink things it would probably be 1.5-1.6 million
---
Agitation, Mad Grit, Iron Grasp, Lightborn = Backpack Bubba
---
If you manipulate the bloodweb effectively and with good RNG, around 1.500.000 bloodpoints.
---
Ok, thank you very much
---
Also they should bring back the unlimited stabs while in feral frenzy. Not because it‚Äôs needed but because it was cool and makes sense considering it‚Äôs called FERAL Frenzy, not limp dick frenzy.
---
I'm guilty of it myself lol
---
Add the Clown coughing when he hits the wall.
---
Thanks bro!
---
Wasn't sure whether I was on the DBD ir GTA subreddit for a second
---
Great concept and as people have said before survivors not being able to know which is being channeled could be cheap so to counteract this the legion should have a Walkman on their hip which is turned on for feral frenzy which would muffle audio by playing that characters mix. They would also have an animation (1-3 seconds) where they swap the tape and channel someone else when this happens a tape rewind noise would be heard by everyone along with while in the terror radius a faint sound of the specific music would be heard by the survivors
---
Should I buy ghost face?
---
That's a great power and all, but I used to put my babies near really cheap ovens outside. I'd start cooking something on them and then leave so it would catch on fire, killing the baby lol. I always did that when I had too many kids.
---
How does this get 5k upvotes when I can't find someone who agrees with this.
---
For a second I didn‚Äôt know which to post it to but I realised nobody would understand if I posted it on gta haha
---
I get it that it‚Äôs breaking the rule. Thanks for understanding tho.
---
\*Sad trapper and billy noises\*
---
This is the power of requiem
---
Oingo is best JoJo
---
This is why deja vu is the undisputed best perk in the game.
---
People always wonder why I run whispers on doc. It's actually really great.
---
Derank weekend homie
---
What the fuck did you say to me, you little shit?
---
Rank reset affects pros and boosted survivors alike.
---
Perfect idea
---
It's because of rank reset
---
No problem! 
---
Wraith can be lots of fun, and has a few solid addons that are cheap too. Look for the brown addon called ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù and pair it with the yellow one that makes the direction of your bell sound undetectable (I forget what that addon is called at the moment) for a fun build that doesn‚Äôt cost many BPs.
---
[Uhh](http://imgur.com/a/9CCVnMs)
---
Not sure I use my p3 head piece when I do play her but I do have the pink hair as i think it‚Äôs cool
---
professionals?
---
That makes sense.  I just literally never thought about looking for the gates.
---
Classic Freddy is still heavily implied to be a pedophile. The child killings were almost certainly sexually inspired. The creators originally intended for him to be a pedophile but he was changed to just a child murderer because of some real life case that was making headlines at the time. The connection is really obvious though.
---
Which is going after the most vulnerable target.
---
I hate it when people just stay in the gates and t bag to be toxic, whenever I play survivor and nobody needs help I GTFO
---
What perks is he even using?
---
There is a very small window to where you can actually get the drop, if you pallets slam during the killers pickup animation it won‚Äôt work.
---
     SO a Youtuber Named The King made a video talking about changes he would make to No One Escapes Death, but i wanted to ask you guys, what do you think, after being where its been for 2 years does it really need to be changed?
---
      My personal Stance on Noed (Survivor main with over 6000 hours) is that it isn't that strong nor do i actually think its a perk that rewards bad play. In the current state of the game, it is very possible to have 3 gens popped as you down you first survivor. doesnt mean you did anything wrong as a killer. Its Just the other 3 players that you weren't chasing just did everything right. The Devs themselves say they balance around 2 escaping and 2 dying every game, meaning more games then not all 5 gens should be getting done, so you should get to use almost every game unless you are doing EXTREMELY well. that being said, having No one escapes death in a 2v1 scenario can be all you need to clutch a 4k before the last 2 get away if they play too cocky around the last gen popping which i think is fine and exactly what the perk is for. NOED Will not give you a 4k at 0 gens with all 4 survivors still alive unless ALL 4 players make a mistake, and if that happens that's on them, for their misplay. there is counterplay to it. Spread out, get the totems, go for different doors, YOU HAVE OPTIONS. I personally think its fine where it is. You can stop it from even turning on with Perks and items, and it is a fair punishment for going for gens and ignoring all else in the game, like hook saves or totems. I don't think every killer needs it, but it also does a great job of keeping M1 killers like wraith competitive with Hillbilly, Ghostface, or Meyers.
---
     As for the change @TheKing proposed  , I dislike it as well because it would reward tunneling towards the end of the game, as apposed to say a perk like BBQ that incentivizes you chasing people you haven't hooked for more blood points at the end of the game, spreading the chases out among all the players. also i get that it sucks to juke the killer all game and get hit with noed (I've been that guy more times than i can count), but saying you should be safe from one of the killers abilities just because you hid all game doesn't makes sense. you then punish the people who know how to run the killer, and reward players for hiding and using Urban Evasion all game late game. DBD is both Hide and Seek, and Cat and Mouse, that change would blatantly punish players that are used to more of a cat and mouse gameplay loop. And lastly the movement speed is nice for the killer but FAR form over powered. Its a little edge at the end of the game, that last for maybe the last 2-4 minutes of the game at most.
---
      
---
**TLDR**: In closing I get the gripes with NOED but TBH as a survivor player, I think Its been in the best spot its ever been. You can counter it in so many ways, and it mere existence promotes players doing totems, thus slowing down the game and promoting a healthier meta game. I disagree that it rewards bad play because based on dev balance goals it should get activated in every game(Meaning all 5 gens should get done see the 2 die 2 escape goal from earlier), and is the perfect "Oh Crap" perk that can clutch a close game into your favor, and again it can be countered.
---
personally i think ghostface is more fun
---
I think I got it. But why would he go for you if he sees the injured guy right there?
---
I‚Äôll give it a go! No doubt on BBQ for points. Iron Maiden is fun. I think early game could be wait for whispers to go off and then switch to treatment? Use it sparingly? It‚Äôs nice not having that first scream right off...I want to save some for mid game if I can. 
---
I feel like STBFL is a must when I play...if you can zap lock someone at a pallet or window they get greedy and sometimes you can sneak in another shot and down them.
---
Meh, it's the Sims.
---
lol idk what kind of games you're playing but i can count on one hand how many times i've been hit on the hook by a killer. it's extremely rare in the games I play, hence why I asked the killer what the deal was
---
I agree 100%.  It's just stupid to hit someone on hook.  Also, I can't speak for everyone, but as killer, I never have had visibility on all four survivors at all times during a game.  So how could I possibly know what every single person did or didn't do in the game?
---
Survivors spend all this time running away from killers, but when are killers going to run from survivors
---
[Laughs in rank 19 nurse]
---
Ghost face is fun to play and fun to play against.
---
Legion is annoying to play and annoying to play against...
---
i made jane but she‚Äôs not THICC enought
---
Well at least we cleared you wouldn‚Äôt make a good teacher
---
Ofcourse this reddit 100% agrees, filled with the biggest pieces of shit on the planet. When Truetalent gets sniped though all bets are off and everyone has to shed a tear for the poor guy who already has succesfull twitch-channel. You people who do this are just cunts and I don't even stream.
---
What about the clown?
---
Boi I will try that, seems fun. I know he isn't best killer but there is something that force me to play him :P
---
I usually play survivor so I just use them as an additional camera lol
---
we have no idea. I am just worried they will use the battle pass as a excuse not do reward events anymore
---
That is how it works tho, that took away the other points, all he had to do was not stand next to the hook as they died, seems pretty simple.
---
I‚Äôve ran plenty of merciless, hook someone and walk away immediately, find someone else hook them. That‚Äôs the only way to get it, no camping or tunneling will really help because of the negative bonuses it gives you such as this. You need to hook all survivors 3 times and hope no one DC. 
---
And ghostface gets chase points just fine, you get good chase points if you actually chase instead of auto grabbing or exposing them immediately. Adept doesn‚Äôt mean kill everyone as fast as you can, you need to take time, play with you food.
---
W a l t e r   C l e m e n t s
---
Each hook brings them closer to their end state.
---
SwF though. People straight up abuse the matchmaking system to boost
---
Ive already said it two times but Im going to say it again:
---
---&gt; This freddy shouldve waited for the dead hard before attacking. Dead hard is completely useless if there arent any pallets or windows nearby because any decent killer will wait for you to DH. He had enough time and space to wait for the DH.
---
You also ignored the part where I tell you that survivors can avoid getting grabed from the door by letting go. Like please,dont reply if youre just gonna ignore anything I write.
---
Could you give me a list of the clothes you wore if you remember ? It would be funny to pull up on my friend looking like this.
---
He did it to himself.
---
And you can‚Äôt look at them, they teleport around kind of but that‚Äôs really just them moving normally
---
1.8 mill sounds about accurate I would say.
---
I think he's correct at high ranks, for new players it's always a stealth game. At low ranks that doesn't happen anymore.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll sign on in about 40 minutes and send you a list if that‚Äôs okay
---
Full video [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOEKAdhsqxw)
---
Excellent point. I was talking about killers deranking to bully worse survivors. 
---
I frequently see SWF squads with a red rank and a bunch of other worse teammates
---
The Plague is the least "messed up". She may be deathly sick and look grotesque, but she never killed anyone prior to being taken, she was actively trying to save lives in fact.
---
The most messed up is tough. All of them are more or less psychotic monsters at this point, though some were like that long before the entity got a hold of them. Doctor, Freddy, Clown, GF, and Michael are all the most  abhorrent among them though.
---
This is a cool idea! It would be nice to have different mori animations you can select for your build. I‚Äôd buy some cells for some cool moris
---
I think it‚Äôs fine how it is. The only time I ever use is with a killer I‚Äôm bad at like nurse
---
Had a game as the Plague last night on Badham where I got off to such a terrible start that I spotted them 4 gens. 2 problems for them though. They cleansed like crazy and also 3 gen'd themselved hard. It was a mega-sweat 4k.
---
Alexa what is Fugu? 
---
Alexa: read the damn wiki nerd
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugu
---
Yeah I got an ‚Äúez baby killer‚Äù when I played as trapper yesterday lol. I just wish he started carrying more traps or could carry more traps without add-ons. I‚Äôll try him again but I don‚Äôt really know the common loop places for each map because I end all loops with nurse by teleporting through the wall and nailing people in the back of the head.
---
Yeah, at the beginning what I do is I see whispers go off then chase the survivor I find and don't use my static or therapy attack so I can save that tier 1 scream for later, whether it'll come in handy or not. If they go to a loop that I think I can shock and hit them in I will regardless of if they've been tier 1'd or not for the first chase.   
---
Also I use it to know when and when not to switch to treatment because if there are no survivors around there's no point in treatment and I can stay in their area and make them go mad and in the process find them.  
---
I will also give your STBFL strat a try.
---
I love this!!!
---
If u don't have urban invasion you're F'd. Not that you should have it on, but damn you do wish you did. Still not worth it for 1 killer,and probably not the best perk choice. just has a few advantages, one being hag.
---
Can I get the Huntress and Spirit tattooed? Do I have your permission?
---
*Bing Bong*

Most messed up - The hag 
---
Least messed up - daddy myers
---
I can see why you‚Äôre salty. You got farmed by a potato that didn‚Äôt even put on wglf lol, I would‚Äôve just DC‚Äôd if a player was cucking everyone so that way they get BARE minimum points and depip back to potato land
---
This is why you spend money on someone who charges more for their skill. If OP is fine with it, cool, it‚Äôs their body. But if I was going for photo realistic I‚Äôd be paying 3x as much if needed.
---
I've been looking for a killer to main. I'm not a big fan of legion, I hate leatherface, hag and trapper are okay, and clown and Huntress are so hard to use. The stealthy approach seems way more fun
---
If the hag is not on the same side of the map when the unhook happens, there is more then enough time to get away. The traps only have a few meters of effective range, 3 meters if I recall correctly, and with a survivor base crouch speed of 1.13 m/s or  28.25% that can be cleared in just under 3 seconds (2.65 seconds to be exact).
---
Hag has a reduced movement speed of 4.4 m/s, thus in those 2.65 seconds she could close an 11.68 meter gap if there was *absolutely no obstacle in her way*. If she got back to the hook using that short amount of time then you were well within her terror radius.
---
If you do have time after getting past the trap then hiding should not be difficult. If you get killed by a hag in this way it's your own fault, there is either enough time to get away or you chose a very poor time to save
---
Doc is annoying to play *as*
---
I‚Äôm not criticizing him so much as the artist... it looks half-assed. Again, if he doesn‚Äôt care then that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs his body. But it looks like it didn‚Äôt cost very much.
---
Especially when you're just patrolling gens in the cornfields
---
From what I remember legion waa considered annoying before they were nerfed.
---
I recall a video with a funny thumbnail that said this
---
How to counter Legion.
---
Spoiler: You Can't
---
I mean we are rank 5 so we aren't exactly bad
---
I won't try to change your mind because you're right. Prayer Beads are overrated and a 1 trick pony.
---
This has been suggested countless times
---
The game is designed for killers to tunnel. Tunneling is arguably the single best strategy that every killer should be employing.
---
And she can tbag survivors.
---
Just use ds and you re fine.
---
I think it needs a slight change. For example if you hooked every survivor once the totem will activate  upon powering the exit Gates. So it rewards the killer for doing his job instead of just sort of waiting for it to activate and it still punishes gen rushing
---
Nah. Tbagging doesn't bother me. It's the inappropriate actions with minors, ban evasion on multiple accounts, all around shitty personality, holding games hostage, glitching to trap other players, witch hunting other players, hacking the game to obtain items he shouldn't have.
---
Should I continue? OhPedo aka pizza face is a disgusting person. Not needed in this community.
---
Hey man, Fugu too!
---
Do those hatchets have an iridescent head?
---
You get 2500 bloodpoints in Deviousness for "No One Escaped."
---
I think the legion is really not that messed up especially the girls
---
Dude I feel for the hag.. If you read her Bio.. its terrifying. She was also one of the only killers (who's lore I've read) that was not only willing to work for the entity, but begged for its help upon death. :( imagine being in that much pain.
---
Myers and pig are the closest comparisons to ghost face in my opinion, if you enjoy them theres a chance you might like ghostface
---
I play both killer and SWF on the regular. Id be happy to just have 10k bonus bloodpoints for going against a SWF team. Just give us some kinda compensation
---
Game is definitely active but I hear lots of people on PlayStation complain about queue times
---
/u/gematria666
---
Mentally
---
if it did that it would say breaks the hook temporarily. only if they have hangman‚Äôs trick would it repair itself in ANY given amount of time
---
You did a good job! Well, you know, besides for the fact you gave them tails
---
Huntress is least messed up just because she doesn‚Äôt know better
---
Clown is up there in Highly messed up but still no where near Herman
---
Hah, true but it is still super fun watching survivors do the math and then slow crawl over the pallet right into your arms
---
* 2500 Deviousness for missing out on the No One Escapes bonus
---
* 200+500 / 250+500 Sacrifice points depending on if the EGC is active or not. Add in another 200 if that survivor hasn't been hooked yet since they'll go straight to struggle phase and you'll get points for that.
---
PS4 player; very active game still. I don‚Äôt have any problems with queue times unless it‚Äôs really early in the morning (2-8 am) and even then it‚Äôs maybe 5 minutes.
---
Yes, you lose on the 2500 for No One Escaped, but there are other factors that I'm wondering about:  
---
Potentially catching (600) or hitting the survivor (once 300 or twice 600), hooking them (200) or late hook (250), sacrifice (200), entity summoned (200) or late sacrifice (500)? Am I missing anything?  
---
Is it always a late hook and late sacrifice if it's the last survivor as well? If it's a late sacrifice, is the entity summoned given if the survivor was not hooked before?
---
Maternial instinct is way too strong however everything else seems great! Good work!
---
He‚Äôs apparently scared of his family and scared of upsetting them, that‚Äôs why he kills like he does.  He genuinely doesn‚Äôt realize anything is wrong with what he‚Äôs doing because it‚Äôs what he‚Äôs done his whole life.
---
Personally, Legion is more fun to play but Ghostface is more satisfying.
---
Isnt legion a bunch of people that dont have deformities eighter?
---
i think making it a token removes its counter-play and would make it more frustrating to deal with too ya know
---
As a claudette main, i can confirm its part of the handbook, it's illegal not to
---
I forget to change the name back all the time. But I do get the odd follow now and then.
---
ahhh, the good ol' days. 
---
Now the killer can shut it with your legs in the air.
---
I think he's referencing the fact that you *do* need to be on the same side of the map to camp, since her teleport doesn't have unlimited range.
---
Though I do agree that one of her strengths is camping, same as Hillbilly or any other killer with a mobility power. Such is life in DBD.
---
Entity: So, how sneaky my totem was?
---
Killer: No
---
Both are quite eüÖ±Ô∏èic but i prefer legion because ghost face is hard for me
---
Oh. Well, I think that "Late Hook" and "Late Sacrifice" refers to if you do it during the EGC.
---
If that's the case then I really should use Breakdown more
---
I feel like Lisa has the most messed up origin story
---
I mean, that has nothing to do with her getting captured and eaten alive by cannibals.
---
Noed and Adrenaline are fine but I like your ideas!
---
I‚Äôd love to see this in game
---
Maybe try contacting bhvr
---
**Rule 3** - Shaming other players.
---
* Do not publicly shame other players.
---
A cross map yeet is impressive enough, but also securing the down? Now that‚Äôs something.
---
No problem
---
Dead hard is useful way more often and in way more scenarios than DS. I haven't had a game yet where it hasn't saved me from going down at least once or twice
---
remove this hellish garbage from the face of the omniverse.
---
So what you're saying is that I CAN USE THE WAYS OF THE AFK TO MY ADVANTAGE.
---
Interesting.
---
So her pupils are a *little* dilated, big whoop
---
That mean's XBOX is ok. Hows your connection breh?
---
So if Brutality, Deviousness, and Hunter are maxed out then the cost for the killer is only 300 BP while the benefit for the survivor is 5000 BP?
---
But if those three categories are not maxed out, then the cost for the killer would be 2500 in Deviousness, 300 or 600 (one/two hits/catch) in Brutality, and 750 (late hook/late sacrifice) in Sacrifice. 3550-3850 total cost if those categories are not maxed.   
---
Then there's "Survivor Found" from the Hunter category for an additional 400 BP cost and "Chase" for 0-8000 BP.  That could change the total cost to 3550-4250+.  
---
So if the categories are all not maxed, the estimated cost for mercy would be at minimum 3550 for the killer up to 4250 or more. Correct?
---
Huntress be looking like a panda with her face reveal üêº
---
Nice.
---
Get thee back to hell, demon!
---
SRY BUT I'M NOT HOME. I'LL SEND YOU A FUCKING FRIEND REQUEST IN A FEW DAYS. I'M FUCKING SORRY BUT I CAN'T RIGHT FUCKING NOW
---
Doctor probably isn't having the time of his life doing the Entity's bidding considering the contraption he wears on his head is a punishment from the Entity. Clown on the other hand is more than happy with his life in the Fog considering the Entity loves the guy.
---
Yeah I can't watch the elm Street movies because I can't focus on anything but how much I want to fuck Freddy
---
I think if noed gets changed so should adrenaline, they are both on par for eachother but one is given for free and one is for doing gens. I would like them both to be changed and it would be good for both sides
---
It no longer kills you at the end unless you had it on before the gates were powered (before the last gen was finished).
---
The most normal of all the killer has to be the Pig.
---
Amanda might have worked with Jigsaw, and went through some shit before hand (drug abuse, the RBT game and the house from saw 2), but she is otherwise a normal person, with normal emotions and mental state. She just happened to die, and is in the realm.
---
Compared to the next most normal, Trapper, she is a Saint.
---
The "Fucked in the head" winner, is totally Doctor. He is way more sinister than clown or Billy or Huntress, and insane to the limits of normal reasoning.
---
One: I‚Äôm a Hag main. I know how her power works very well. 
---
Two: I find it very funny when people tell me I‚Äôm camping from a distance because they don‚Äôt respect my traps. 40 meters is a decent chunk of distance to cover for her by just walking. If you‚Äôre going to go for saves you need to either respect the trap, get a flashlight ( chests give flashlights very commonly), or at least confirm she‚Äôs in a chase with anyone else. 
---
Also Mint Rag Hag is a play style you have to work around. Usually people bring MYC and Devour Hope and if you know you‚Äôre against a Mint Rag Hag, you need to save your allies either very late in their hook stage or extremely fast because you have 15 seconds to react if she teleports far away enough for DH/MYC to be active. 
---
Also if she is using that setup, you need to rush down generators because she would only have 4-5 traps down at a time to not litter the map or confuse her targeting to return to a hook. 
---
Plus Mint Rat is Ultra Rare and you probably have encountered it a handful of times if people even play Hag after a while.
---
i mean i‚Äôve never see a hook i broke with breakdown come back so idkü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If you don‚Äôt care about BBQ then go with Freddy. But any killer that plays this game for any amount of time needs BBQ. There‚Äôs really not a single decent killer that will argue against this.
---
Lol, just don‚Äôt be bad at the game and you won‚Äôt need DS, dead hard, instaheals, adrenaline, borrowed time, lithe, balanced landing, sprint burst.  
---
I
---
I actually learned how to fix this. My friends and I were in a KYF match and I got stuck. Gotta yoink the survivor and it positions you back to a normal spot for yoinks.
---
I would assume that you're being sarcastic, but on this (toxic) community i'm not sure.
---
If you're serious, that flashlight spamming was to indicate Nea to open the door (she prefered to do nothing instead), plus the killer wasn't even remotely close.
---
I close the harch and let them open the gate, need those points
---
Ya but this creates the problem wherein in order to play your one survivor your best bet is to just play killer(leatherface until atleast 35), and use the bloodpoints on your one survivor. 
---
There's also the problem where killer's BP boost perk is actually useful for the killer, as it comes with another benefit(Wallhacks for players far enough away, which ironically is also a wallhack for players too close). Whereas the survivors BP boost perk doesn't have any listed secondary effect, except that encouraging players to dehook casuses them to go for really bad unhooks or take hits when there was no reason to, giving more advantage to the killer.(Also the stacks for taking hits for teammates seems to only activate when the killer is actually holding the survivor, it rarely seems to proc otherwise the range seems ridiculous.)
---
As you can see, time killed me in the escaped area...
---
Did you try.... going back into the map and leaving again?
---
Anyone want to fill in a noob on what this is?
---
It can be pretty nasty too.  
---
I had a game where I managed to down 3 people with it, and I just kept catching injured survivor after another. Got 2 kills with 5 gens remaining.
---
No no no I‚Äôve been corrected that Leatherface is in fact OP.
---
I like it
---
I'm sure you also complain and moan when you get rekt then message the killer after every game with some type of personal attack, like most of your kind anyways, rofl.
---
It rewards players who failed to do their job. Perks don‚Äôt reward people for doing nothing. You have to earn it. Adrenaline rewards you for completing all gens. Perks are also there to allow you to do stuff I.e. allowing you to self heal.
---
Noed is a perk that helps with shit game mechanics of afking on gens and holding m1.
---
I agree DS is good at low ranks but is basically useless at high ranks unless you aren‚Äôt the obsession because if you are true obsession then people could just wait one minute or not target you for a while
---
Gg ez?
---
Pig can be a bitch sometimes because of the rng that's involved with getting the trap off your head. You've basically just got to get lucky. 
---
For Leather face You want to always make sure he doesn't catch you out in the open. Stay near windows and pallets if he's nearby and he shouldn't be able to do a thing with his chainsaw if played correctly.
---
That is so evil lolol I would have been going through so many emotions, poor Nea :( lol
---
BBQ is just short for barbeque
---
Ohh damn. Just read the wiki.  Guess my luck ofor noed is high. It's not as common for me on console. Seems a bit excessive, but I wouldn't remove something that's been there forever to water down the difficulty. 
---
Worst case scenario- he kills everybody.
---
Best case scenario- 1 guy gets sacrificed
---
Damn you did all this in one plane rid?! Impressive
---
You have to find hatch it‚Äôs not just Riven to you. You don‚Äôt have to earn NOED it‚Äôs just given to you
---
he didn't have borrowed time. like he saw me coming to rescue my friend and i hid to wait. then, he just farmed her
---
I used to, back in the day, now i despise people who do it, its just mean honestly, and if i get tunneled i stare at my screen and die inside a bit and go on to my next match
---
Played the doctor with a Game offering with Distressing, overcharge, Unnerving presence, Ruin, and Calm add-ons (purple and yellow). Survivors didn't get anything done at all really.
---
I agree but I put an idea for adrenaline rework because I believe noed should not be reworked without adrenaline being reworked too
---
If there are no bones, there is no NOED, you dont just get NOED you need to protect atleast one Totem till the EndGame, don't BS me
---
I literally just did it 5 minutes ago in a match they work
---
No reward. That's just a perk man. It's not a guaranteed kill. It's a good chance, but even a good chance can be reduced to 0.
---
But you have to earn those second chances. Metal of Man is a prime example. You have to get hit 3x before s second chance.
---
naked blue lady as a tattoo. das a yikes
---
It did until the EGC was introduced.
---
I would say Pig. She tortures people for fun, or maybe because she believes she's helping them. But she only thinks that way because of how Jigsaw's games have warped her mentality in the first place, so she's doubly messed up.
---
Spirit's Taco Stand?
---
Well, yes and no.
---
No One Escaped is 2,500 in Deviousness, but there's no rule saying it will be the last 2,500.  If you have 6,000 points in Deviousness, then it's only 2,000.
---
What triggered the EGC?  Did killer open door, or close hatch?
---
The point here, is there are way to many variables to say what the cost is.  If you wanted an average, I would say 3k to 6k, but that's still a very wide range, and results will vary based on match conditions.
---
He just seems like he walks v v v fast as well as the chainsaw thing being like 3-4 hits that can potentially one shot.
---
Iridescent Revolver: Allows one survivor to kill another while healing at the expense of two pips, but triples the total amount of bps earned. Iridescent Revolver can only be used once per match. Bloodpoints will be awarded at the end of the Trial.
---
No one thinks insta heals are balanced or take skill so its irrelevant to the discussion.
---
 I agree, it depends on the player. Some twitch streamers are super fun memelords that play well and entertain their audience with unique gameplay, while some twitch streamers will teabag at every stun, whine about only being hit because of lag, and ending every game by dcing or accusing the killer of camping or tunneling. 
---
 
---
 Some people can entertain their audience without very well and realize losing happens sometimes, but some people get too concerned with looking cool and are afraid of losing on camera so they blame the killer.
---
That's an expensive mistake you've just made.
---
i disagree. i'm in green ranks usually and gens never get done lol. though, doing gens can be boring at times, i see why they're set up the way they are. 
---
ime, there's a good enough amount of games where it's tense. most survivors are on their final hook with 1-3 gens left (not counting time around rank reset since that's a grab bag)
---
Should hatch reward teams for failing the main objective. Should we remove that? No one complains about that... I'm not saying it should, but hell, I wouldn't mind losing a game for not completing the main objective. 
---
Survivors words.
---
Plague and Wraith are probably the least messed up, and it‚Äôs VERY hard to choose a winner for most messed up
---
Imagine Spine Chill and Premonition in real life?  You can sense danger long before it ever gets you.  Parents would love bond, it‚Äôd make watching kids much easier.  Or Calm spirit for zoologists, and Ace In the Hole would be OP considering it applies to allies, so if you‚Äôve got like 10 friends, prepare for your life to get a lot easier.
---
:/ sad yo.. poor Claude you could've taken the hit with Borrowed time, nobody had to die
---
Wow you really went hard on the most messed up ones
---
Thanks man. Really dick move. When I beat a killer and they were really trash I just give them tips on how they can get better and send them links to youtube videos.
---
I think ill be ok without your approval lol. You couldn't even argue any of the facts I gave because you know its all true. 
---
Have fun worshipping him. Im sure he super cares.
---
Pig - if your issue is boxes you're just getting unlucky. If it's stealth just keep moving your camera around and react to her roar or use Spine Chill. If you're looping her and she crouches, what you do depends on the size and shape of the loop. That last part is just experience, really. You'll learn if you should just leave that loop or if you can stick in it and utilize it still
---
Clown - You're going to have to drop pallets early a lot of the time especially if they have an effect increasing add-on. imo you can run around Clowns pretty well at L-T walls by faking out directions and make them react to something you aren't actually doing 
---
Bubba - You have to say what your problem is. Like you just loop him like anyone else, really
---
That sounds delightful!
---
Hmmm that‚Äôs an interesting perspective on the Wraith, never really thought of it like that
---
Best combination ‚ù§
---
I mean all the exhaustion perks have prerequisites. I'd say dead hard is the most useful overall. It's not map or object dependent. Also, you have more control over when to use it, compared to sprint burst.
---

Sooo true af how many games i lost (depip) because idiots think they will farm XD
---
I love all the downvotes you're getting for respectfully stating your opinion on how the Nurse matchup works. Just shows that people don't want to bother learning how to deal with her. I play Nurse(and other killers like GF and Billy) quite often, so I can vouch for pretty much everything you've said being accurate. Nurse is so much fun compared to the other killers since you rely totally on hitting your blinks precisely instead of getting looped every game. Normal chases can still be fun and have mindgames that can be played, but they're different kinds of mindgames than what you need against a nurse and that's what people don't want to admit.
---
As for the addon 'rework' that nobody seems to have any *factual* info on, I'm fine if they remove the extra blinks, maybe 3 max for an ultra-rare but that's it, but I quite enjoy the range ones(call me a scrub if you want but I consistently 3-4k with two blinks and max of only 1 range addon). Having more than 1 currently is a bit overkill, but having only the default range as an option, while good, makes at the very least learning her way harder than it needs to be. Newer players who don't blink a lot give up a ton of mobility by not blinking everywhere and a little bit of range can help them realize that blinks are useful outside of chases too.
---
It was 10 hours haha! Only took me like hour n  a half:)
---
That is awesome my dude
---
Does nobody on this subreddit know how to do bones? It's such an easy counter that people who hate noed don't even acknowledge

New Killer: The Chancla
---
I‚Äôve actually been using small game a lot recently and feel like it‚Äôs pretty good. It detected hags traps as well as trappers traps. Also it‚Äôs really good when ur in red ranks and all the killers are using ruin and noed.
---
Welp. Sorry I dont have enough money to play on PC. Really want to get one soon tho, cause I have a lot of pc games I want to play that I cant cause I have a mac.
---
I get that but you really can't argue that that is how a majority of streamers feel. Not that it is wrong, but nearly all streamers wanna make money. As I said, that isn't a bad thing.
---
I feel like at least one of these should have some reference to "Don't Mess Around With Jim"
---
Lol protect dull totems. I don‚Äôt see the big fuss about NOED. Just take the L and move into the next game.
---
Survivors are way more toxic and complainey than killers in my experience
---
They are fun to use tbh, but on the receiving end is just frustrating.
---
My heart seeing happy faced hard working Rin materializing behind me with a massive sword to chop me in half. 
---
I need this more than anything.
---
That's cloudet in bush.
---
It is good to not cleanse against Plague like you said. She can not get her power without people cleansing. 
---
The only time I cleanse is if someone else has and she gets her corrupt, then though it just snowballs for her power.
---
Least I'll go with Wraith. He just took revenge for all the people he killed unknowingly
---
Most messed up...that's a hard one. Ghostface enjoys being a slave to the entity. Doctor loves to torture innocents, Freddy diddled and killed children. I think I'll go with Doctor because I don't like children
---
Self heal is often rewarding bad players. I don't think u should be able to self heal in a co OP survival game, unless you're a medic or something. Healing each other seems balanced enough. 
---
Personally if they removed the hatch, I would be happier that the team would function more efficiently into completing the main objective. 
---
Bad teams shouldn't be rewarded either. Hatch ain't a perk. A mechanic indeed, but the point is if the killer is running a perk that can be countered or reduced have it's chance reduced to 0. Then It's quite fair on both sides. Killers are not meant to be weak in the first place. A win is declared until you leave the gate, not when the last generator pops. 
---
Why do so many players like easy wins... whether it's crutch for the killer that doesn't matter. Your objective is to escape regardless of any outcome. That's what a survivor player is. If you don't have that mentality, maybe you're not a survival player whatsoever. 
---
I knew survival players that would brag for doing things hardcore. From other games in general. The bad players were the ones complaining in GENERAL. Whether the killer wants to crutch, that's irrelevant to a  survival player. escaping against all odds is what makes things challenging. 
---
removing noed is the 1st step to watering down difficulty when it's not necessary. Honestly, I hate for games to get easier, when I'm constantly practicing/adapting to get good.
---
Leaked new Freddy cosmetic huh?
---
Idk dude, I truthfully believe huntress is the highest skill cap killer in the game. Players are STILL finding angles and strategy's to this day where as nurse is just.. well she's the nurse.
---
Why is that a picture of my blind fat ass and how‚Äôd you get into my house?
---
How would he work power wise?
---
Also would it be better if he didn't have a normal terror radius?
---
And then the devs retired them because they were kinda op if a killer/survivor burned one in their favor
---
&gt; Plague to clense or not to clense? Does she get your blood for one shot if no one clenses at all??
---
Don't cleanse. But if someone else happens to cleanse, that's when you have to make the decision to also cleanse or try and wait it out, and there is no standard, easy answer there.
---
If no one cleanses, she gets her Corrupt Purge (the one that damages you) only if she brings in one of the add-ons that gives it to her without someone cleansing 
---
And just to make sure there's no confusion, her Corrupt Purge is not one shot
---
Like I said, I could be (in this case, I clearly am) mis-remembering.
---
She‚Äôs been steadily being nerfed, despite not being strong at all. Her traps are good for stalling the game a little (as a proud Oinker I never expect the timers to reach zero), while her crouch power is so niche during chases you become an M1 Killer. And using crouch as stealth can be negated because people see the Jigsaw Boxes and know to be on the lookout for Pig. Imagine how weak Myers would be if you were told at the start if the game it was Myers and knew to avoid him stalking you and towering up.
---
Her two best addons are common (Combat Straps and John‚Äôs Medical File), while many of her more rare addons actively weaken her power. The most ridiculous ones being the addons which increase the chance of getting skill checks when searching Jigsaw Boxes, because skill checks are so rarely missed that the bonus a skill check gets you makes the trap be removed quicker.
---
You‚Äôre right and all man, but it‚Äôs not fun to get rekt by someone who has more experience when you‚Äôre still learning killer. We‚Äôve all been there
---
Yeah I was being sarcastic / mockign this community
---
In this game you have to keep in mind that you might not always escape. So do your best to cleanse dull totems and do at least a gen or two and if you are chased a lot you will easily pip.
---
Now about the killers.
---
Pig: She is a very good stealthy boi but can be easily spotted if you are on your toes and know what she looks like. Even then she will spook you sometimes. As soon as your head is trapped, try and find the box that is nearest to you and then the farthest from you. This always works for me at the beginning when you have the most amount of time. Other than the traps she is an M1 Killer with a really rudimentary Stealth crouch power.
---
Clown: just dont breathe in his codeine farts. Avoid him at all costs and try to not run if you manage to have him lose sight of you.
---
Plag: she is hot garbage and can easily be bullied. Never cleanse but if you want to, you can. Just know that you must avoid her vomit at all costs.
---
Bubba: just dont get hooked, cause most bubbas facecamp. Run close to rocks, pallets or t walls. They are the best to avoid getting hit by his chainsaw.
---
This would be such a cool fucking screenshot without the HUD and perks
---
Well, damn.
---
Its risky if you run ruin and devour. If you run pop and devour they don't usually rush to cleanse and by the time they realize devour is in play its usually after 3 stacks. It depends on where you want to hedge your bets. The way I think about it is ruin slows the early game, devour slows the mid game and noed slows the late game. 
---
As spirit I find that if my early game was amazing the game is over anyway so I don't place much value on ruin whereas getting a down or two because of devour can save a losing game.
---
wow how bold

I would consider my self average and honestly nurse can be good on console if people learn where she lands.
---
Only S Tier Killers on console that I have noticed are Freddy, Hag and Clown. They end chases fast and can easily find you if you are not good.
---
I‚Äôm a doctor main does that say something about me?
---
We still have three sets of skins (Ace/Nurse, Nea/Hag, and Kate/Jeff) left to get in this mid-chapter, so that would mean the last set of skins will be Sept. 3rd or 4th. I'm guessing the following week.
---
Okay I might be dumb but what's swf

Hey man sometimes it works. At the very least it helps me out plenty.
---
they were kinda innocent,the people he tortured were enemy spies
---
Depends on rank. I generally only play solo q in red ranks and most of the time your average fellow survivor has enough awareness and desire to win to not farm you. Most high rank survivors have a pretty good idea of the killers location based on a ton of factors.
---
The hags name is Lisa Sherwood
---
Are the dates when the chapters were released for everyone? or on the PTR?
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt have to earn NOED it‚Äôs just given to you
---
This is frequently true of Adrenaline also unless you think every survivor who has it contributed decently in every match
---
Good most of the time. Maybe I have a flawed idea of when to do it. But at the same time I‚Äôve walked through pallet areas, got hit and just kept walking, so obviously that‚Äôs passed the initial animation.
---
When your playing survivor and you start getting bold points even though you cant see the killer.
---
Lery's :(
---
Kind of a subjective question, if you want to win, spirit and nurse are fun
---
If your just looking for unique gameplay, Myers has alot of fun things you can do, pig has fun pallet mindgames, plagues power is very unique
---
Huntress can get some sick throwing axe plays
---
Drift king Billy build is a blast you get to do map length chainsaws
---
I guess what I'm saying is their all fun, depends what your looking for
---
What the fuck is this shit.
---
I mean, everyone wants to make money...?
---
I don't really understand your argument. Not trying to be mean, just legit don't understand why advertising your stream is a bad thing.
---
More like going in for a 3D, photorealistic US flag and coming out with a 2D flag with only 46 stars that's upside down
---
Porque no los dos?
---
Yeah I'm the same way, red ranks aren't fun as killer can't mess around with bad killers without getting stomped, I just wanna play fun builds :(
---

---
You mean ultra rare? There are plenty of very rare offerings for survivor, that fog one (those don't do dick anymore btw thank fuck), White Ward, Vigo's Jar of Salty Lips, and I think there's a purple shroud too but I'm not 100% sure
---
True, I guess it could. I just don't recall seeing that recently, but ya never know!
---
Exactly. There's two people injured, but one of them is down a health state, and thus closer to being out of the match, and thus more vulnerable.
---
Health states aren't the only thing that matters. Hooks do as well.
---
It's better to go for the person who is going to die quicker and thus make it a 3v1.
---
For me it's "Playing as the Hag be like"..... Damn killer is like 4 foot 7 and can't even see over Autohaven loops
---
I had a few on my Dwight and on my Ace before I finally decided to start prestiging survivors a couple weeks ago
---
Her lore mentions her dragging her mutiliated, barely-held together hand out of her shackles - her claw is the result of that.

As a pig main, this is every game on the plague‚Äôs map
---
I dropped it, got tired of yelling at the people crouch walking slowly towards me while another teammate is chased down half the map away.
---
That's a p4 claudette with the wailing bell.
---
Leatherface would be hiding in the back corner of the Game map sweating in fear of being eaten.
---
Ash mains rise up!
---
If you are a survivor and a killer uses a "secret offering" (usually a Mori or one of those offerings that separate the survivors spawn point from each other) you wont be able to see, survivors usually fear a mori for obvious reasons.
---
When survivors use a secret offering (I believe the only ones are the ones that make them spawn far from the killer, or close togheter) the killer won't be able to tell which one it is.
---
Its funny because many times I have seen people baited into thinking the killer is using an ebony or ivory mori and made them dc early when in reallity all they had was a cypress or a shroud offering.
---
Just yesterday I had a killer call me and a bunch of randos "stupid faggots" because we were using "overpowered perks." I see shit like this just as often as survivors who bitch about dying. It really seems like nobody actually wants to enjoy this game sometimes.
---
Once a killer did that exact same thing you did to the Nea
---
Most messed: anyone who's drop the last survivor at the hatch and close it.
---
Old legion was fun for the person playing them, literally no one else. He ignores chase mechanics completely and slows the game down to a gruelingly boring pace
---
I agree new legion is too weak, but we can't just revert him back
---
I tried getting the adept for 3 hours straight and just gave up. I‚Äôm only in rank 11 and i was getting gen rushed like crazy. Hopefully you can get them soon
---
Maybe. But don't worry, I also main doctor
---
August 21 teaser, August 27 ptb, September 10 release?
---
Im glad someone else has the same problem! I felt really alone in this
---
Lol u probably do gens as fast as u can while sneaking around the map just to get 1 hit either noed üòÇ
---
that depends on the person, there is no killer that is universally considered "most fun" to play.
---
DOES ANYONE ELSE GET THAT BUG FOR WHEN YOU DEADHARD IT DOESNT USE IT? PS4 BTW
---
Man Purple ranks are the best. Because we get all of the crazy killers. Not sure why you're cursed with only those 3 lol
---
You doing that is probably why they blew through gens. You're not pressuring the game at all
---
Camping/patrolling isnt a good strategy and against good survivors they will do gens very quickly, since youre not applying any pressure whatsoever.
---
 Your reward for taking part are bloodpoints and some shards.
---
what? it's just natural that you relate to a character or person if you have a similar background or upbringing, compared to Wraith the Hag does not have a conventional background (in the western world aka were you'll find the majority of dbd players) and is therefore ppl do not feel as bad for her as they do for Wraith
---
Pig. Hit her with a pallet and you will hear my primary reason.
---
I love that that is a thing.
---
Have you ever thrown up and said to yourself ‚Äúoh I wish I can do that to people‚Äù? If so, boy do I have the killer for you
---
By doing the exact opposite of what you're doing.  You need to not be worried about the previous hook you should play to pressure the remaining survivors of the gens and always work towards getting your next hook.  The goal is to constantly make them pull off gen repairs to perform altruism and in doing so create pressure that slows the game down while you cycle through hooking the survivors.  Playing this way can make the game slow down considerably when it comes to popping the final 2-3 gens while you rack up a considerable amount of bloodpoints and an easy pip.  Worrying too much about the hooked survivor is a trap that causes gen rushing.
---
Looks like she's half a second away from sneezing
---
Ghostface, he‚Äôs not overly complex, gets 1 hit downs, and is a sneaky bastard who can teabag, what‚Äôs not to love?
---
Spirit
---
It's not unfair, you can do what you want and patrolling can be easily punished, but it is considered BM by the community
---
Ghostface or Pig
---
I feel like the extra blink add-on with no penalty should be an iridescent add-on, and that the one that slightly reduces range should be purple. At least that way, when a nurse triple blinks you, you know she brought the big guns. 3 blinks as-is, isn't super uncommon to come across, and you can just use two yellow addons for a slight range increase as well as an extra blink with no penalty
---
The fact that the basement is close by is the exact reason i just chunk out that Gen ASAP when i play Survivor, it‚Äôs unsafe because of how there‚Äôs two entrances, but only one escape and no good places to hide.
---
Some people also just don't like playing killer period, and I'd wager those people vastly outnumber the opposite situation.
---
I think the BP gap is supposed to incentivize people to play killer, but as more and more content comes out, it just means playing killer is a necessity if you want to get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Unless you‚Äôre using a tuning guide and primer bulb
---
I would say adrenaline works after you get hooked once, that way both the perks work under the same situations but noed still counters it
---
Yeah post a picture please on this sub :D
---
I played as Spirit with ruin and mori.
---
Spirit, because she is the second best killer in the game after you learn her and Clown is pretty ... shit.
---
did you draw this? this is bad ass man
---
lmfao you seriously think it's impossible to find the basement within two seconds if starting the trial fucking amazing
---
It depends on your playstyle and perks you have for teachables.
---
Holy shit, hooks are a real thing!?
---
Between those two definitely Spirit unless you personally are intrigued by Clown or think you'd like his play style
---
I mean, NOED on Cannibal is ok, because Cannibal is trash.
---
Sometimes if I'm playing with a real jackass on my team I just won't even bother unhooking.
---
Prayer beads spirit probably causes the most rage quits in this game. I'm not afraid of it, because that's the same as saying I should be afraid of omega blink nurse. If anything, it ironically makes the game very boring because you lose your counterplay options
---
I got ruin, third seal and devour hope (yes I am an Hag main)
---
The question here is, will she ds him first or will he tombstone her first?
---
yeah I downpipped that match but worth it!
---
You literally cannot get across the map with her ability even with the green add-on for range. You literally do not know what the fuck you're talking about
---
They are siblings.
---
In my opinion, Spirit :)
---
I actually made a Coraline chapter concept haha.
---
I would **KILL** for this. This is not an exaggeration.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c6a5xq/the_coraline_chapter_fanmade_chapter_with_power/
---
Seriously, this. I don't even understand how people have fun using broken shit if the outcome is pretty much the same every time. I thought things like prayer beads and iri head were funny for around my first 100 hours, but after a certain point I realized how stupid it is to play the game with the sole purpose of giving others a bad time.
---
Sorry, let me come with my offerings for Haddonfield and Ormond üòÑ.
---
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable. Head on also synergizes pretty well in that build
---
Mentally, they're a huge clusterfuck of mixed emotions. Their physique might look normal, but if their mental disorders took physical shape, they'd have a tumor-infested head
---
Ghostface is at least concice and focused in his psychotic nature
---
Not to mention she sees over everything being 13 feet tall
---
thx for your infromation sherlock
---
I swear, there's a bunch of degenerates on this subreddit.
---
Holy crap it looks good. I'm at work so I'll have to read the perks later. But it looks really cool.
---
Spirit.
---
But even then, you wont be banned unless you did something wrong. Maybe you lag switch or have internet that has a lot of ping which makes it harder to play for the survivors and escape you. 
---
I played a game yesterday where none of us could do anything bc the lag. The doctor kept teleporting places and knocking us out. 
---
If you were banned, other killers would be banned too bc I have faced some shitty people with laggy internet. I too play on PS4
---
Reverse Ghostface. You get a negative effect for looking at him, that increases the closer he gets.
---
Then maybe you should be the Killer.
---
Don't even need to be at the basement at that point. Just wait for the unhook, then as soon as you hear that boom, teleport over. Flashlights are the only counter
---
go for it
---
I've done that before and most of the time they escape before I get tier 3 activated. Because I don't do much other than stalk to try to rush it. Thankfully I got it one time early (I'm talking only 3 gens done) since I had a 3 gen strat set up and they kept trying one gen on the other side of the map. I kept stalking them and had all four in the same area.
---
Clowns Power is boring for me.
---
His Perks except Coulrophia are great.
---
Spirit Power gives Map Mobility, can hit during it but gotta recharge while Clown got 4 or so bottles which slow movement.
---
Spirit got good Perks but Haunted relies on having Ruin or Lullaby to be cleansed.
---
Spirit + Headphones can ensure that chases end fast
---
The problem is that there's no way to tell if they're all done when you solo unless you personally spend the whole game only searching for bones and do them all yourself.
---
It'd be great if the UI kept track of them...
---
Look at the canon Halloween - Halloween (2018) then tell me again.
---
I know but I‚Äôm worried about tracking in phase mode and clown is like Pig #2 I mean his lovers really loves him so there should be fun. I really like Spirit and her perks but again if I can‚Äôt use I will regret for it and level almost 40 up again to get Clown too
---
The stairs may look wide enough but they aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôve tried to walk through gaps in trees that end up having some invisible barrier between them even though it looks like I can make it. Your friend must of done this before they updated character collision on the basement stairs making it to where if you injure a survivor they can run right past you. If BHVR banned your friend it was for a reason and at this point he should no longer be banned and this whole situation doesn‚Äôt matter. So.
---
The implication is that it‚Äôs stuff that was left around the Meyers house, either stuff his victims left or stuff that wasn‚Äôt cleared out when it was abandoned. So a letter from the boy he pinned to the wall and some crappy jewelry from his sister or one of his victims, and he stole the headstones and brought them to his house so.
---
No.
---
I'm not that much of a disgusting creature
---
Says the person with ‚ÄòNea is best girl‚Äô in their name.
---
Thems fightin words.
---
Never forget intentionally stepping on them.
---
Just buff the base gain, having to lose a perk slot just to not make trash BP gains is pathetic
---
As long as you're not playing against billy, they can't down you anywhere near the basement. Run to the second pallet, drop it once the killer comes, then run if they break it, and stay if they don't. They'll have basically no way to catch up to you before you're well away from the basement. And then you have a second safety net there as well.
---
It's easily the safest generator in the game if the killer has no instadown
---
I got ruin and headphones so I guess I can be OK
---
Thai Tea is disgustingly amazing. I feel this on a very spiritual level.
---
Hospital Bag is the worst for me. I can't see over counters and you can spot a trap three rooms away. Only baby Dwights ever trip them.
---
Do you are so excited I love it, wonder what winning the lottery looks like. Lol in all fairness good job reminds me of umbra.
---
I always thought her face was mostly a skull in the front, only leaving sinew and the like around her sideburns and scalp, and I think her bottom jaw is broken off in the front.
---
Is there any way to listen to this outside of Reddit? soundcloud or YouTube?
---
It was rough. I got it twice that match though. But due to me only have the purple tombstone, it takes me back to tier two immediately after one kill. I got so lucky right there. I did however catch the next person since they were already injured trying to loop the shack. Now because it does mean I can kill someone without ever hooking them or hitting them prior, it does make people mad. But as you can see I only was able to do it twice in a match  before the gates were activated and that was insanely lucky to get it twice.
---
That broken status offers Killers so much knowledge. Dead Hard , Resilience, tenacity or Unbreakable
---
You can do this in less than 2 minutes with Photopea, which is basically online free photoshop.
---
I like how even when he's tryna be the romantic spoon he doesn't take the mask off
---
Yea but honestly I thought it was done better where it‚Äôs implied but not like the remake where they‚Äôre like yea he definitely raped them and they repressed it.
---
Stupid and Lucky, that's what he's all about
---
Ok got it
---
You are rank 15, rank 15 survivors are very easy to track and you can mind game them by just standing still with Spirit. You will regret Clown, because you will see that he is very weak in red ranks once you get there.
---
What?
---
I haven't prestiged Michael and I found it close to level 35
---
The reason they probably won't is because you're not supposed to have good or great add-ons every game on either sides, and the more bloodpoints you get per round, the more easily you can sustain it.
---
I'd honestly rather just see more perks per bloodweb, as opposed to a bloodpoint increase. No need to rework add-ons for everyone, and it'll dramatically reduce the grind
---
That's literally her best map
---
I never said across the entire map, you shouldn't play hag that far from a hook. Half the map? That's plenty close enough.
---
Ok so if you are a hag main I would go with clown. He has a closer play style to hag then spirit, and he goes really good with Ruin. Clown also has good perks that are good for all killers so if you decide to main someone else the perks on clown can still help you.
---
This happens to me and my friends quite often. Just another glitch that fucks over survivors and never gets fixed...
---
Ok thank you and I hope I get there tho
---
Okay, I think you‚Äôre delusional lol you literally brought up a sprint burst exploit randomly? Maybe read your own comments lol anyways I am definitely done talking to you because you make no sense at all. Have a great day!
---
If I'm being honest I dont know how to explain it well. 
---
When you apply pressure you force survivors off gens, so naturally injuring multiple survivors will achieve this. I cant tell you exactly how to apply pressure because a lot of it is down to decision making, but here are some scenarios. 
---
Example 1: Youre chasing a survivor and notice someone is working on a gen nearby, its okay to go break away from your current chase to hit that survivor working on the gen. 
---
Example 2: You down a survivor and slug them so you can injure or down another survivor who is nearby.
---
still not camping you fucking nerdshit

I can't stop
---
If you rack up Deviousness, brutality and hunt full then few extra BP dont matter.
---
Atleast 5k for survivors escape and mercying one survivor isnt much of a BP loss unless you do it every time
---
Both Nurse and Huntress are hard cos they require preciseness and prediction. I cannot predict anything at all. I'm not good at aiming already and survivors start dodging hatchets so well when I hit green ranks! I guess I will just have to keep playing and hope that one day I can predict survivors and land cross map hatchets.
---
All the timelines are canon. It's just that Halloween and the 2018 timeline is the only good one.
---
Doctor was the hardest for me, as you have to shock survivors and knock them down. Though I slugged a lil bit to get it
---
Thanks I appreciate the advice, I'll try to relax and focus more on keeping up with the match, chasing and watching gens, I didn't really know how blood points work, I'll put in some time and practice, and try to not focus on only getting kills.
---
Oh right, most broken killer in the game. His power, addons, perks. Everything beyond broken. Forget Nurse and Spirit, Bubba is the real threat.
---
It's insanely satisfying. Fun fact, though this survivor was salty as fuck afterwards and was calling me out for being a noob for using an op build, I called him out for using an instaheal and DS and Borrowed Time. We both recognized we had strong builds and that ultimately it was his choice to stay when he knew I had tombstone that led to him getting caught. He calmed down and admitted it was a cool play and we chatted for about 10 minutes in post game chat about our favourite killers and how late game builds are so satisfying as killer. Cool guy once he calmed down.

---
That's something I had thought of when making the concept but I couldn't find a ''balanced'' power that started her off as weak but stealthy with only the button eyes giving her away and ending the game as monstrous and powerful, since having pressure in the early game is so important as killer.
---
Conceptually though, I absolutely adore that idea and I'd love to hear your spin on her power!
---
Maybe it's a platform problem? I'm on PS4 and this is an implemented feature
---
I get the occasional Huntress, Myers and Trapper, but i'd say a fair 70% of my games are up against the top 3 killers running OP addons and the same 5-6 meta perks, which is just not fun to play against as a survivor. And when you see someone not playing Billy/Nurse/Spirit, you can be 99% sure they'll bring in NoED, so yeah, not much fun to be had there as a soloqueue player either.
---
Unless you hooked in a corner of the map, you shouldn't stray very far away from a hook as hag in case they trigger that trap. The range isn't the full map of course, but you can go pretty damn far still. Easily upwards of 70 meters. 
---
and IF they are in a corner of the map, they're trapped over there since you SHOULD have had traps everywhere else on that side of the map anyway. It's a lose lose against a good hag, the best you can do is have the unhooker take the heat while the other guy keeps crouching/healing.
---
No Mither is mostly used with perks that benefit from being injured or speed downed state recovery up
---
Killer is always host. Killers internet is used to determine hit and Collison. Until dedicated servers come out... It's killers fault.
---
Thats a good tip, I'll try to not tunnel vision kills, what is slugging though?
---
Clown
---
Could you open it for a bit
---
Doctor's was my first Adept lol
---
Why would you be afraid that you can‚Äôt use spirit? All you need is ears.

On a serious note, get whatever you‚Äôre comfortable with.
---
So ome day late sorry, BUT in a more discreet section of the lore that might not acrually be cannon but I believe it is, trapper put beartraps all around the estate to protect his father and his fortune as well as to stop any of the employees for leaving the estate
---
Imagine being so bad that you complain about adrenaline. Lmfao. If you actually knew how to play the game md you protected gens maybe you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about adrenaline ü•µ
---
And lmfao imagine complaining about exhaustion perks lolololololol
---
I would say buy Spirit because of her potential mind games but clown is cool to play. I like both and play both. Clown is more for fun build. For try hard game use spirit.
---
I think we found the new SKSKSKSKSKSKSKS

True, but at best, he could escape the entity's realm. He'd never be able to fight back

Yeah actually I‚Äôm good at soundtracking but I‚Äôm just worried
---
I personally don't like the 2010 Freddy being a pedo and I prefer Robert Englund's Freddy. I mostly imagine playing as the original Freddy and not the new one
---
Bruh I only had one hook all game. That was the first person I caught out with Tombstone and it was like 3 minutes into the game. If I took bloodwarden and actually got it off, I would've gotten a 4K. Someone ran out right next to me as I killed this survivor. But after this, you see me start looking. I actually got the next survivor since they were injured trying to get past me by looping the shack.
---
Don‚Äôt be. At the end of the day all that matters is what you want to do.
---
Lmao aight. I mean he got banned for body blocking when he wasn't body blocking so I would think the situation obviously matters. Obviously killers are being banned for doing the same shit survivors do. And he would hit them and they would run down the stairs then come back cus they were braindead. as was evidenced by the fact that they hung out in the basement to heal. Idk why you are getting so aggressive when all I'm doing is explaining a situation that was unfair towards someone that pertains to what we are discussing.
---
‚Äúdont wanna be in the basement? just don‚Äôt go near the basement!!! lol!!!‚Äù
---
There are literally some maps where you HAVE to be next to it, like The Game or some Coldwind Maps. It‚Äôs not HARD to find the basement, just in that some cases it‚Äôs not ideal to find the basement and try to actively avoid it forever.
---
Just wait, the killers are too fast or they're bots.
---
Pretty much üòÇ
---
Ok thank you
---
I love when I'm playing Freddy and the survivor starts to loop a fake pallet
---
That drawing is so good, and it wonder how the wraith looked before the entity took him.
---
I actually went up against a Hag with that loadout, we all got hooked in the basement with no gens done in under five minutes. On top of that she had Ruin.
---
LMFAO I love you
---
Well Clown has a sick Mori
---
Damn, that's a counterargument I can't beat! Such outstanding logic. 
---
Yes, of course, your unseen knowledge realizes that the hag is not literally camping the hook, but if you have a trap there ready to teleport to, or force the survivors to slowly crouch away as you come back to the hook to find them still anyway, what is the difference? You either trigger the trap or get found shortly by the hag that shouldn't be far away anyway. A hag trying to actually chase other survivors is just going to get hilariously destroyed.
---
TIL
---
Bleeding is when a survivor gets healed after you injured them i believe so you probably won't know where they are but correct me if im wrong
---
A disgusting Mori let‚Äôs say
---
It's worse when it's the smaller killers like legion and you mistake them for being a survivor
---
Did get reported, but not banned. Also, that fucking plug-in tho. Wouldn't get banned because the report system back then was hella broken.
---
This is genuinely one of the most relatable pieces of content I've seen on this sub. I remember I once got like 200 downvotes when I said killers need better totem spawns
---
I'd say Spirit, as both her perks and base kit are far better than Clown's. Spirit fury is great for M1 killers when it's paired with enduring, and if you're a Hag main haunted grounds can work pretty well too (I actually run it on her myself).
---
Clown's perks are pretty meh IMO. Pop is good, but if you already have ruin you don't need it as much. I'd stay away from bamboozle too - it can be helpful on some pretty busted windows (ironworks, suffocation pit, etc.), but it's not worth sacrificing a perk slot for. You can also run the risk of becoming too dependent on it when you're running normal tiles like the killer shack and jungle gyms, which is going to hurt you as you get better at the game.
---
But... he‚Äôs already in?
---
The Ayowoki
---
Well his reasoning in post game chat was that there was already another injured survivor and he didn't think I could use my tombstone again. And most of the time he'd have been right. But I drained all 4 dry of stalk. Including the first person I caught out with tombstone. So it was insanely lucky. He wasn't being toxic though I agree that those survivors who t-bag should just leave.
---
I kinda like this idea, if we're being honest
---
That sounds so fucking terrifying
---
I laughed about it when I was clipping it.
---
I third that
---
Well, for one did this only once and it was awhile ago. But also, I did try to play the game like normal, I tried to rescue the first person hooked but then it became something else.
---
Whether you're good at her or you get bullied &amp; demolished, Spirit is *sooooo* much fun to use. I have every killer and I always play Spirit when I'm just looking to have a good time. Most people get constant 4Ks with her which is great but she's just super fun to play as.
---
Clown can block paths if Survivors dont want to go into the gas and force survivors to run out of hiding when you accidentaly gas them
---
His perks help other Killers close Window loops or Pop the Weasel with 25% gen regression
---
This would make her a basic bitch to loop but hey gotta help survivors
---
Aggressive? My dude I‚Äôm laying in bed with a fan running in my face feeling pretty good and calm? I‚Äôm just telling you BHVR doesn‚Äôt ban people for no reason. Survivors can body block a hook because you can just hit them and down them and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not reportable. Body blocking basement stairs for more than a minute is reportable because that‚Äôs holding game hostage. If the killer is standing at the top of the stairs there‚Äôs nowhere else to heal &amp; I heal in the basement with We‚Äôll make it as long as TR is not around. Have a good day cause I‚Äôm done with this convo! (^‚Ä¢^)

I thought I was the only one to call Trapper that

Hello! fellow gamers

Hail to the king baby!

Honestly Trapper.  Got me dying inside

Pop Goes The Weasel, a Clown teachable perk, is high tier. I initially bought Clown for that perk when I was new, but didn't really play him much after I started playing other killers.
---
Spirit is one of my mains, so I'm going to be partial to her. Her play style is fun, and she's a strong killer when you get the hang of her. She might be a bit difficult to get the hang of if you're still learning killer, but lower level survivors will likely have trouble with her as well.
---
To me, Clown is a chase killer - using his bottles, you can end chases quickly. Spirit is more of a mind game killer. You make survivors make mistakes, and then capitalize on those mistakes.
---
I agree old legion although fun to play wasn't fair and they are broken so they do need a rework.
---
I read a interesting post some time ago suggesting that legion be a co op based killer where 2 to 4 people can play as legion and due to their slower speed they have to work together to down people since it would take 3 hits to down them.
---
And after you hear a chainsaw
---
Fun? B A C K P A C K B U B B A
---
I personally only really DC if someone is hard tunneling me for no reason or if they slug the entire team.
---
Slugging is downing a survivor and leaving them on the ground
---
I had someone who I morid that said thank you in post game chat. His name was mori me
---
DECIDING ON A FAREWELL TO DBD. THIS GAME HAS FUCKED MY ASSHOLE TODAY. 4 GAMES IN A FUCKING ROW I'VE BEEN TUNNELED, 3 OF THOSE GAMES WAS A HILLBILLY THAT DID NOT FUCKING PRIMARY HIT ONE GODDAMN TIME FOR THE ENTIRE GAME. ALSO WHILE BEING TUNNELED FOR THE ENTIRETY OF 4 GAMES MY TEAM DID NOT GET ONE FUCKING GENERATOR, NOT ONE GENERATOR OVER THE COURSE OF 4 GAMES. FUCK HILLBILLY AND FUCK SPIRIT. THIS GAME CAN SUCK MY WHOLE DICK. SPAM SPACE ON A PALLET? NOPE FUCK YOU. SPAM SPACE ON STRUGGLE? HAAAA FUCK YOU MORE. I need help, very tilted.
---
It's ironic
---
Legion does need a buff or rework but not to their old self and although fun they were broken and unfair
---
What do you mean? Tunneling isn't cheating, it's just generally regarded as bad behavior.
---
Or you can just play like a rank 20 and loop the pallet Freddy just broke.
---
Please, remove the "don't" part. Thx
---
Also remove the (Sobbing) part and replace it with (Moaning). Thx
---
I think hey overdid themselves with the new Badham though. All the other maps except The Game and maybe Lery‚Äôs have shit totem spots for the most part.
---
If you're immersed you will never get better at the game. Hide if that's what you want to do but if you can't chase for more than 20 seconds than you hinder you're team getting gens done. Practice looping, it's better for you in the long run
---
For high ranked survivors not really, because the killers are better at sound tracking/spotting visual clues but on low ranks I definitely notice the difference! If you play Claudette with dark outfit ‚Äì boi, you can ninja your way through the match.
---
Did you escape?
---
Nvm, Franklin's
---
Most TTVs I come across aren't live. I think if you aren't streaming you should take the twitch out of your name. I've also had TTVs that never stream at all. Can't wait until others start advertising their Reddit account
---
can players stop complaining about matchmaking, it's the same shit over and over again, we get it, matchmaking is broken.
---
Nurse is awesome on console. It just takes alot of dedication and patience which most players do not have. Especially, when Hillbilly and Spirit exist and are much easier to learn and handle.
---
I'm late to the party, but I seriously think that they'd've dropped the ball hard with a Stranger Things crossover if the intro doesn't sound like this.
---
&gt;:)
---
Freddy Kruger who literally was and is a child murderer
---
No, it worked. You Died Hard...
---
Yup, sounds about right tbh.
---
They'd also have to ban use of the web browser even if you AREN'T looking up stuff on DBD because the web browser would be open.
---
Freddy is literally a child killer
---
Freddy killed kids and got away with it
---
dude what the fuck
---
I hope you bring Franklin's every game.
---
Yet y'all like a bunch of gay shit. Lol
---
That's mostly because survivors don't really use pebble that well.  At least the ones that I play against they always try to throw the pebble in a complete different direction that any experienced killer will just know that it's fake.  
---
One of the ways I've been juked by a pebble was when survivors throw it nearby but to a different exit to the same area.  Like you walked out of the jungle gym heading East but tossed it at the vault that heads North.  Or occasionally a survivor will toss it to make it look like they left the loop but they actually just hid.  And once I check I see them sprinting away - even if they don't get away completely they basically just reset the entire chase which is also pretty good.
---
Another thing is when survivors juke themselves with it - like they throw the pebble at a dead zone in the map and wonder why the killer didn't go check it out.  I didn't check because I don't care if there's a survivor in the corner of the map with no gens or hooks.
---
LEAVE BUBBA ALONE HE IS TRYING HIS BEST AND THATS ALL THAT MATTERS
---
HIS BEST ISNT GOOD ENOUGH AND HIS PARENTS ARE DISSAPOINTED
---
I disagree
---
The way I see it this perk is a good fall back plan should you fail to stop gen completion.
---
This is not easy at high ranks especially against swf or when playing weak killers like Cannibal as they aren't good enough.
---
Another thing is it won't trigger so long as you destroy all the dull totems which you should be doing anyway for the extra BP.
---
The only thing I think should change is add a totem counter letting survivors know how many dull totems there are that way they will know when all are destroyed.
---
I found a streamer behind a rock from his injured breathing and he complained how I was stream sniping him. He called me a troll for asking why he thought I was stream sniping and said if I wanted an answer to give him money. His chat backed him up too.
---
An omnipotent being known as the Entity feeds off strong emotions. So it kidnaps random people and killers to create trials where it can feed off the strong emotions. Survivors can become emotionless husks who lack feeling, becoming useless to the Entity, so they‚Äôre sent to an empty void and ‚Äúdie.‚Äù
---
Oh, and there‚Äôs this Benedict Baker guy who documents most of the things in the Entity‚Äôs realm.
---
Funny. Even if it does look fake.
---
Well, too bad since original Freddy was planned to be a pedo and it's heavily implied. The only reason it wasn't made explicit was due to a prominent case at the time. No matter what version of Freddy, he's still a pedo.
---
Just depends on what playstyle you have. Survivors like myself have played hundreds of hours and the only thing we like to do is get chased, so we pick more visible outfits.
---
But to have those perks work you have to earn it. Unbreakable you have to earn getting up. Unbreakable isn‚Äôt always great
---
They were literally broken and not being played as intended before, no.
---
Yeah, I only wish to somewhat see a new cosmetic for Freddy to make him the OG Freddy instead of this one
---
Yes! There should be a UI for it so you can counter play. My friend and I are the gen jockeys so if we knew hey there are 2 left then we can know to stop and find them before we finish
---
I‚Äôd buy that. I know I sure don‚Äôt use it well
---
Hatch most of the time rewards one person who is the last survivor. And losing one person out of 4 isn‚Äôt a loss
---
It's the rank reset chaos. You'll have to either deal with it or wait it out as the various SWF crews naturally gravitate towards red ranks.  After the chaos is over, you'll likely only deal with the occasional red rank SWFing with low rank friends.  Gotta make their sick 360 montages somehow.
---
You mean playing the game how it was meant to be played?
---
what the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
SURVIVOR FOUND
---
Claudette at MacMillan or in the corn at Coldwind. Every. Single. Time.
---
Oh my god ahaha, I need this in my life
---
Michael is basically just pure malevolence. Even Freddy who's completely fucked up is only evil by our human and societal morals, but Michael is literally just evil. He exists to be evil without any more depth to him.
---
Then how it stacks to 3? And i think dying light is pretty balanced, the obsession heals herself and heals others faster, but if she dies everyone is fucked.
---
Small things to add:
---
I really liked the idea of inflicting status effects by hitting survivors. But Black Poison comes with a twist.
---
You can hit Survivor and trick them into thinking you lost them / let them go. If they dont heal fast enough (which they are unlikely to do because they dont know about the perk, at least the first time) they cannot heal further because they are broken.
---
I guess this sounds strong but the healing progress stays so Survivors are just forced to pause their healing.
---
The killer can get a lot of pressure with this perk. Could also be paired with Sloppy to make it almost impossible to heal in time.
---
This would consume two Perk slots though.
---
If the killer commits to the chase he waists the full potential of black poison, because the 30 Seconds broken are likely to go by during the chase or on the hook.
---
Just some thoughts. Let me hear what you think...
---
The original video can be found here so go credit the original poster. https://youtu.be/aGizQ8PnuCU
---
That's not always the case - in fact it's often better to juggle survivors so they have to spend as much time as possible NOT working on gens.
---
Still though often you're correct and it's better to take someone out of the game than chase someone who hasn't been hooked yet.  95% of survivor complaints about "tunneling" are really just admission of "I don't know how to safe unhook" or "I'm blaming the killer because I farmed my teammates" or "That's not fair, I don't have Borrowed Time!".
---
It's pretty laughable to complain about tunneling against a mori.  Yeah, let me chase and hook you instead of instakilling the person you just farmed.  You can complain but killers are trying to win just like survivors are - but survivors are more numerous and think their complaints are more valid for some reason.
---
I agree with you on broad perspective but if you read both of their lore with more attention, their is a distinct difference. Hawk is a serial killer like Ted Bundy, he collects trophies of his kills, he likes to select his target carefully and work slowly on it. 
---
Yes, Serial Killers are bad but they have an artistic touch about them. Indeed a messed up touch but killing is the only creative outlet they know. They kill when they get insatiable about expressing themselves.
---
Carter on the other hand is your run of the mill Nazi Scientist who has no emotion or satisfaction behind their genocides. He doesn't regards his victims as humans or equals, he treats them like lab rats and has no empathy for them either. They are just numbers on his experiment data sheet. And thats not it either, coz science is just an excuse for him, he just wanna commit a purge.
---
In short, Clown has a hungry belly (no pun intended) which fills up with every kill and slowly gets hungry again after a certain time. Doctor is a void, a black hole which will never satisfy, no matter what number goes down for him.
---
Neither Wraith nor Hag truly wanted to be killers. Both killed when they had a chance not to, but Hag needed to to survive in a real fucked up sense
---
You do realize she was only a kid when she was taken right? Like, between the ages of 14-16.
---
And some people may be like "yes, I can see what I did wrong" and then they go to check it after the game to find out the person wasn't even live. It's better to just put your Twitch in the profile.
---
it's even worse when they have mint rag and just teleport to a gen and grab you without notice
---
Oh man, Imagine moon bouquet game against scratched mirror Myers
---
The special edition is console only isn't it? Console dbd only comes in "special edition" and the "special" part about It is that of flesh and mud + spark of madness chapters come with base purchase (it cost 30 dollars instead of 20, saving a little bit of money)
---
Tell me you dont wanna 69 with that huntress body pillow.
---
Plague.  There's more than enough spirits already.

There is this as well.

The goddamn swamp as the Pig. Even standing she‚Äôs so goddamn short!
---
I was showing my mom the merch shop and she was like "oh, so you want a body pillow?" I completely forgot about the Shirtless David and The Huntress body pillows.
---
True I think he is worse.
---
Oh absolutely I agree, Herman is by far more fucked up in both quality and quantity. I just wanted to show the distinction that they had different intentions and desires behind their slaughter, but I absolutely agree with the analysis of the two distinctions in depth.
---
do the daily‚Äôs and play killer
---
You‚Äôre 100% correct. The points are awarded for how long they were bleeding for.
---
Its not for each map its for the tiles I'm pretty sure and since people can memorize tile's totem spawns its relatively easy to find totems. I'm not sure anyone has any idea how to make totems with better spawns aside from allowing them to spawn randomly throughout the entire map except unreachable locations to which they could spawn on the walls of the maps at times.
---
Not gonna lie, didn't expect this.
---
This reminds me of that one guy who got a lee sin tattoo on league and it kinda made me realise why I'd never want a character tattoo'd on me
---
I mean Michael shows a lot of emotions especially that one time when he didnt kill that baby or his niece called out to him and he didnt kill her for it
---
I still have common bloody party streamers in one of my characters bloodwebs. Now those were the days
---
I seventh that
---
Glad to know we are on same page, tbh every killer in DBD roster is very different from each other. 
---
Amanda kills thinking she is righteous, Michael is rebellious and has his own fucked up code and can disobey entity, and Legion thinks Killing is fun and games. Also, Trapper's lore is so ambiguous that we don't even know if he is in this realm for being a killer or a victim of his father. It is an interesting mix which makes the game so interesting to explore. I hope upcoming archive will expand the stories further without taking out the mystery.
---
In the movies she starts out as a true believer in Jigsaw but by the 3rd movie she's explicitly designing and building traps that are inescapable. Her in game lore makes it clear that she doesnt believe anyone is worthy of redemption. 
---
The most messed up thing about her is that at the end of her lore it's implied she sees the entity as a mentor or even a father figure. No surprise there's no evidence of entity torture on Amanda, she probably attached herself to the entity as quickly as she could, which is its own kind of fucked up.
---
Good point
---
How about ir only has one of the effects?
---
No they don‚Äôt follow David Harbour on twitter
---
-Michael Scott
---
Farn with a team for 30 seconds, and then chainsaw them all in 1 shot and hook them.
---
Leatherface is not to be trusted.
---
Good. I'm not alone. I bring Franklin's every game on Spirit for salty survivor tears. I even stole someone's purple key once.
---
Hell no it‚Äôs not ban worthy. I find it hilarious when it happens to me.

Yeah. Some people want a streamer to watch, others want to see what they could change in their playstyle. It could be whatever reason. Some people can be dissapointed because of it. Same goes when you get against a bitchy or asshole TTV that complains about everything you did that they didn't like.
---
Thank you for this info. Really interesting tbh. How BHVR has progressed in the later updates in terms of quality in design. Hope they update survivor models later tho.
---
I eleventh that
---
I like how you kill them **while healing**. Like you're all happy that the other guy is healing you then suddenly **he takes a revolver of his belt and fecking shoots you** .
---
I have read its PSed.
---
That would make him extremely interesting to play and would raise his skill ceiling considerably.
---
I think mechanic-wise, it would be cool for him to work like this:
---
- Moves at Huntress Base Speed.
---
- His lunge is replaced with a mid-range tendril strike. Same range as a regular lunge, but he doesn't move his whole body forward, restricting him less in a chase while maintaining a more passive, detached characterization.
---
- Directly observing him displays static on your screen, slowly exposes you (think reverse Ghostface) and reveals your aura to him.
---
- Can short-range Warp when not being directly observed by any unhooked survivors. Think Nurse Blink, but used only to maintain ground/cut off escape routes. Upon arrival at his destination point, all survivors nearby or looking at him get static on their screen to mask his reappearance and notify of his repositioning.
---
- His model always looks like it's looking at the survivor from their point of view, even if the killer is actually focusing in on another direction. His red stain is the only true indicator of where he's actually looking.
---
-Terror Radius is the default heartbeat, but his chase music is varying intensities of static.
---
-Exposed status can be quickly removed by collecting Journal Pages that spawn on trees (similar mechanic to Plague's fountains), but taking a page alerts him. Otherwise, it runs out after a set amount of time, similar to Ghostface.
---
As far as teachables go:
---
- Boogeyman: You are cloaked in mystery. Your terror radius is not detectable to a survivor until they have directly observed you. After 60/45/30 seconds of no direct observation, your terror radius becomes cloaked again.
---
- Proxy: You become obsessed with one survivor. When the Obsession tries to heal another survivor, they are forced to perform a tremendously difficult skill check. All healing skill checks they have are replaced with tremendously difficult skill checks. Failing these skill checks causes the target of the healing to bleed profusely and become afflicted with the Broken status.
---
- Something else, I dunno.
---
Give him at least one large map in a variant of the Red Forest that spawns assets like the mine from Suffocation Pit and a few suburban houses from the Haddonfield map.
---
Meh never been a fan of the perk. Can‚Äôt fix stupid survivors and smart survivors will see the camper before they farm you or get themselves downed.
---
Then it was worth it of my time at least :D
---
Solo players are cursed
---
Me always. I even blame my glasses if I'm wearing them instead of my contacts and after a while I discover that the survivor is wearing a dark skin and hidden next to a tree...
---
I know, surprising. I thought she was a gamer like Feng or a loser like Dwight
---
They are listed as a exhibitor they are showing something
---
How does that not make you sad
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm still hoping!
---
That sounds perfect actually. I‚Äôve been sitting down lot more than I used to at work and I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs translating into a few pounds gained. Nothing extreme, but a noticeable difference for me.
---
Right but the question was who is the most messed up. And don‚Äôt get me wrong Michael is bad, but nowhere close to the level of messed up Freddy is.
---
You do
---
But can you explain why when a Billy chases me sometimes the chase music stops but he is behind me?
---
You mean off?
---
I was sort of being a dick and sarcastic because that's not exactly how you use the uh... Abbreviation... 
---
Thank you for being this wholesome though :0
---
Seems like we had a breach of SCP-173 apparently...
---
Micheal just bc here‚Äôs a better killer, but if you‚Äôre looking for perks bubba.
---
That's interesting since you get bad vision and exposed when looking at him and if you don't look at him you wont see where he is during the chase and it might be harder to loop or escape and he'll warp quickly.
---
I'd actually like to see that in game
---
Survivor: Had a David more worried about healing himself than saving 2 teammates on hook as a ran the killer to the other side of the map so he could save. David decides to let them die while camping hatch. I fortunately have bond run killer to David. David gets hooked by hatch killer leaves. I sneak in look at David, look at the hatch, fake unhook then ditch him with my key.
---
Can you show me where it says that?
---
I like the drawings! Think you got what it takes to draw more killers?
---
I put it on billy because I don't have better perks, tbh
---
Would the tendril attack give him better Rane to the point where he can hit you if you stand behind a pallet
---
I mean... You have a vac ban on your account, either deal with the occasional complaint or make a new account
---
You made him look so adorable, great job! My boyfriend and I love Wraith and think he‚Äôs such a sweet boi that we have started to call him Harrison instead haha.
---
That might be.  The one time I saw that notification and then finally located them, they didn't seem that hurt again.  Though instead of "bleeding" it should be something like "bandaging" or "not bleeding anymore."
---
Tunneling? I'm talking about stream sniping. Do you not know what that is?
---
What probably happened:
---
He already owns Michael and had those perks you don't see equipped on him + the add-on that lets him Mori survivors when he's in T3. The perks you see here are the perks he has equipped on his Wraith.
---
Discordance
---
How to counter noed. Do bones. Dont stay in the game longer than you need to. Dont be overly altruistic thanks for coming to my tedtalk
---
It is haha
---
Other survivors: Run!
---
Ash: That's right, go on and run home to MAMA!
---
And if you're looking at him you are experiencing different hallucinations and debuffs.
---
And you have to blink every 3-5 seconds, which creates windows for killer to teleport closer
---
Stoner hag cosmetic when
---
Freddy was also pretty much corrupted from being born from 100 maniacs micheal just became evil one day
---
Why should anyone believe you without showing that you actually got morid?
---
It means ignoring the other objectives in the game- patrolling generators, stalling the clock, applying pressure- to camp and get one cheap kill.
---
Thx

This is the answer.
---
Great concept.
---
This is it. I've done it before
---
- Basically it happens when you try to escape and go through the doors and it does not play the cut scene or count you as escaped and lets you roam around grass and does not let you win.
---
You say that like it's my fault if my solo queue teammates aren't as experienced as me
---
Thanks, Keanu!
---
I quite enjoyed that. Logical thought process explained clearly. Your teammates were infuriating to watch though lol...
---
GG
---
now THIS is GG WP
---
You realize it could be either, right?
---
I see, so he can apply different perks to the offering instead of his wraith build?
---
Same with evader. You stealth the entire game and only get chased maybe once just for the killer to leave you alone and you end up with silver
---
Thanks i'll watch it.
---
That is definitely not true. I play survivor more than killer and I have the worst internet the world has ever seen and get BS hits on me all the time because of my internet
---
Thanks SleepyWillo, glad you enjoyed it! Yeah not the best of teammates but this is rank reset! Usually I play killer so survivor is always a challenge haha
---
Hope you enjoy!
---
he didn't just kill them, this is remake Freddy who is confirmed a kid diddler
---
what a cute draw!! please draw more and do trapper and legion!!
---
Instead of ruin use Devour Hope and thrill of the hunt. With hag, you can't lose. Unless you suck lol
---
Oh yea totally agreed with you. I play both survivor and Killer and i had equally frustrating games as survivor where one of my teammates evaded the killer all game and i somehow don't pip because i didn't "evade" the Killer enough. Then Killers wonder why sometimes SWF teams t bag around them as a group.
---
That's the point dip shit.
---
Everyone on this sub always turns into a middle-aged woman when someone posts their tattoo: "you know that's permanent right"
---
‚ÄúTunneling‚Äù. That means you downed them again right after they got saved, right?
---
I wish we could see the real numbers.
---
Super coordinated pallet jockey SWF groups aren't all that common in my experience...
---
I've had quite a few random games as survivor where baby killer cries about SWF at first opportunity but no one knew each other.
---
I'd argue that the most category has a similar arguement to Leatherface.  Aside from the manipulation part, anyway, Id say Clown and Meyers all suffered from mental illness, likely something along the lines if DID, hence why Meyers, for example, wasn't jailed for his crimes but put in a ward.  ~~cant recall doctors story off the top of my head oops~~  
---
That said I thought LF was mentally disabled not ill?
---
and this is the 7th week someone has reported this meme
---
Fuck and yes.
---
Very nice! I absolutely suck with the huntress lol
---
either or is fine with me i just wanna use it in twitter
---
Devs said that there more killer players than survivor players. So if they boost bloodpoints for survivors (same average amount as killers) then it will balance killer/survivor ratio for better.
---
ITS ALWAYS THE FUCKING JAKE.
---
WELL I'M THE BIGGEST CUNT IN THIS FUCKING WORLD THEN
---
I understand how the emblem works, and i explained why i think its stupid. I caught all survivors extremely fast.
---
Good point. Maybe that's correct - I'll pay more attention next time.
---
bro
---
I don't think a high level killer "toying" with survivors that dont have a chance to win is a good thing. Same for other way around. If survivors are dominating a killer they should just escape and get it over with instead of having to toy with the poor dude.
---
That just makes it worse
---
Yea dude I‚Äôm not even gonna bother debating this. It‚Äôs been proven time and time again by decent killer mains who **never** tunnel still *often* get sucker punched by DS. I know you know this so quit being part of the crowd bandwagon that says, ‚ÄúJuST dOnT TuNnEL‚Äù. 
---
Does it punish tunnelers? Absolutely. Does it reward bad survivor game play? Of course and that‚Äôs the problem. It definitely
---
Needs adjustment IDC what you or any other survivor main says.
---
oh ya easy, bottles are much easier to hit than hatchets.
---
Oh gotcha, I was replying to another comment. Stream sniping is when you watch someones stream a game while playing against them in game. Which is cheating. This other person is promoting stream sniping and I'm calling them out on cheating.
---
Ive been thinking about this for a long time as a cursed thought in the back of my head sorry
---
You call someone pretentious and say that its your lobby. People wanna try and do what these big streamers do. when no one will spread your name to get viewers you gotta do it your self. The best way to get people to check out your content is promote yourself while you do entertaining things. People wanna follow their dreams no need to shit on them cus they put letters in their name.
---
This is a blessing you are forgiven
---
I really hate how they removed these from KYF. I understand why (too hard to make the lighting work on all new maps) but it feels like a waste.

I got that for the first time ever today! It‚Äôs ass I even left the gate to go to the other one and I still couldn‚Äôt escape :(
---
Thank you, i think shes beautiful
---
&gt;I understand how the emblem works, and i explained why i think its stupid. I caught all survivors extremely fast.
---
I think the emblems are way better than what we had. Just because you killed all 4 survivors with little effort doesn't mean you should pip, a camper can also do that. I don't see how they can fix one thing without also affecting the other. With that being said, I don't know why they haven't specifically looked at chaser emblem problems with 1-shot killers.
---
I agree with you that Chaser emblems needs or at least could be looked at, I disagree on how.
---
It‚Äôs their lobby, they are the host that provides connection to server, the lobby is included.
---
Hag forever because I just feel so in control of dictating the flow of the match but lately i have been playing Plague like crazy.  Really love the sickness and how it spreads to everything
---
Any help with perks. I'm running BBQ. Ruin. pop goes the weasel. And I've tried infectious fright. Monitor and discordance. But nothing's really stuck

Fucking love it well done unlike my steak which I enjoy medium rare.

He had an add on that allowed him to Mori people while in tier 3
---
Rewards them for what?
---
this reminds me when i got told once to kill myself for cleansing a haunted grounds, like, people need to chill about a videogame
---
This cracked me up lmao
---
Ok? What about the people who murder intentionally?
---
They recently have done multiple tests regarding a more consistent ranks between everyone involved in matches, it led to terrible queue times and people started complain nonstop about not being able to find a game. Literally every 5 minutes or so someone would make a thread here saying "*yo guys, its been 30 minutes and I can't play as killer*".
---
The result? They widened the search for players so killers can play or high ranked survivors. If someone is queuing for a while, it throws you in any lobby like in this case. Now people bitch about matchmaking being unfair. 
---
They just can't win no matter what.
---
if lucky, 3 blink nurse is boosted and you can mind game her easily, unless you're in a dead zone with nothing to hide from, but even then i've gotten out of it cuz they can't aim XD
---
Because they couldn't get the license for the original Freddy, only reboot Freddy. Same reason Ghostface is only a costume rather than a named killer like Billy Loomis.
---

Since I have no friends... I am forced to play with randoms. My depressing is getting bigger and bigger with each match.
---
Hag is super fun to play, especially with m&amp;a.
---
That makes sense.
---
Oof
---
He doesn‚Äôt actually get the perks in game that are on his wraith and shown in the screenshot. Usually when you run an offering on a killer to use another killer you dont have, you enter the game with no perks, even if the original killer has a full loadout. Since that kid already had myers, the perks and loadout he had equipped on myers got used when he burnt the offering, but you couldn‚Äôt see it on the postgame screen since it was through the wraith
---
Takes time mate! Shes the most satisfying killer to play well, theres SO many possibilities with her  and the time and effort put in to learn her has been so worth it!
---
Can confirm this is about how almost every match goes
---
Thank you for your comment, I get that people get frustrated but I cant imagine they hadnt seen the post 2 minutes before them with someone else complaining about matchmaking.
---
Should be an older coraline though. Cant imagine hooking a kid haha
---
Wasn't their choice. It's all about the rights they can actually get.
---
See the amount of times i got abuse for running noed on ghostface, even though I literally had no other killers levelled, and had minimal perks to choose from that were actually good, was unbelievable. People just love to complain.
---
Can we console players get chat?????????
---
Decisive strike when?
---
Except I never called you a survivor main. I just grouped you in with the survivor mains, I can‚Äôt help if you can‚Äôt read.
---
Second, yea skilled killers, some very well known, being  punished by DS when they weren‚Äôt tunneling is a valid point. Right? Because your counter argument was ‚Äújust don‚Äôt tunnel‚Äù.  So if the perk is effectively supposed to punish tunnelers, but also punishes good killers who aren‚Äôt tunneling, I think we can agree there‚Äôs a slight problem with DS. Or are we just gonna be cool with the 4x 60 second immunity for terrible players?  Don‚Äôt even answer, I know what your answer is.
---
Look at this of (Today): https://imgur.com/a/TZ8wMg5

Did Behavior cancel their stand at gamescom? It means ... there will be nothing? Idk...

And old sick man being powered up and given supernatural powers by a literal god that can take people from different universes bring people back to life and trap people in an endless loop of torment and horror

If you don‚Äôt have BBQ&amp;C. Then I recommend Cannibal, and if not then Spirit is really good

Wow that‚Äôs amazing

Nea is secretly the entity
---
You should retweet my reach out to Devs.
---
Can confirm that this is how it feels until you learn the game
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that, thanks for the info
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
One google search later and it is stated that the entity has the ability to grant powers to killers
---
If they would've got on gens then the killer COULD'VE leave, even if the pig didnt, being farmed and tunneled is not anymore fun then being camped, in my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs fine as long as they fucking tease the damn chapter already
---
Add the flair then
---
If I have NOED and down a survivor just before the last gen is done, when I pick them up does it tell them (and everyone else) that I have NOED? Or is it only the first hit after it‚Äôs activated?
---
Game: You‚Äôre welcome.
---
&gt;Except I never called you a survivor main. I just grouped you in with the survivor mains, I can‚Äôt help if you can‚Äôt read.
---
&gt;you or any other survivor main says.
---
&gt;you or ANY OTHER survivor main says.
---
okay. I hope I don't need to explain what "any other" means.
---
And if my opinion wasn't valid, what makes theirs valid? Because they're well known? I mean, you don't know my skill level when it comes to killer, it doesn't make their opinion any more valid than mine.
---
Honestly decisive's stun feels very miniscule whenever it does hit me, but it rarely does because again I don't tunnel. "60 second immunity" is so misleading. It doesn't make them invincible. Literally just leave them on the ground and go for someone else, slugging is very powerful when done correctly because that's one less person running around. As with old mettle of man (which I also didn't have much of an issue with because it got me to 4k quite a bit of matches) the effects of the perk are being blown out of proportion, and the downsides of running the perk is being completely ignored.
---
Ds doesn't punish good killers, and if it does punish good killers, well the effects are negligible because a good killer can work around it with ease, which is one reason they're a good killer. Yeah there are a few times that it takes control out of the hands of a good killer (they're crawling out the exit and you have no choice but to pick them up) but those occurrences are rare, and its goes both ways, as there are times where control is also taken away from a great survivor (you know, literally nothing to work with because your teammates waste pallets).
---
"I'm on it"
---
Na
---
If you weren't gonna try you could've just not responded....jeesh.
---
Blood Warden to block the exits after hooking someone
---
No One Escapes Death to instadown survivors (though I'm playing Leatherface in case they cleanse it)
---
Iron Maiden in case they try to locker juke if I need to chainsaw
---
Iron Grasp to better ensure the survivor gets hooked
---
Im purple ranks currently and I keep getting matched with 17-20 ranks and have either a level 20 killer (anyone who gets caught gets camped to death, a lot of disconnects) or a red rank killer (other survivors get caught immediately and disconnect or kill themselves on first hook). Ever since the latest. It's not really fun when either happens.
---
Barely any unfortunately. Lmao
---
No one is watching your stream, guy
---
It‚Äôs not up to them, it‚Äôs up to New Line/WB, who have been pretty insistent on pushing the newer Freddy as *the* Freddy for some reason.
---
More likely than not, it was easier to obtain the rights to the remake. And by easier, I mean cheaper. Mortal Kombat X mobile *eventually* got a Classic Freddy skin, so it‚Äôs possible that we can get one down the line, but I doubt it‚Äôll ever happen. BHVR has virtually no reason to want to pay for Englund‚Äôs likeness, even though he‚Äôd likely allow it for not too much. 
---
As for why they chose Quentin over Nancy, that‚Äôs easy. Rooney Mara‚Äôs Nancy was fucking atrocious. Quentin was far and away the best teen in the 2010 film, Kyle Gallner (his actor) and Jackie Earle Hayley (Freddy) are two of only three or four redeeming factors in the film.
---
Yeah, most likely the 4th, as they've been releasing them every Wednesday
---
If you suck at killer/Leatherface otherwise, probably yeah
---
I get stoned and play as killer. Can confirm my eyes do this and then crust over like a crab in the sea for far too long
---
More like vice verse lul.
---
As the Huntress, I'd rather have the equivalent of 3 perks + 3 add-ons than 4 perks + 2 add-ons.
---
It‚Äôs kind of wild to think about how different the franchise would have been if he‚Äôd been a pedo from the start as originally planned.  Can‚Äôt see them marketing Freddy lunchboxes if he had molested the kids before just killing them.
---
The killer didn't fail anything. The survivors failed. 
---
The objective of the killer is to kill, and they have until you cross the exit threshold to do it. 
---
By assuming the killers objective is gens, you fail to understand the game. If anything the killers goal is to stop you from escaping, and they have been given the tools to do so, but truly it is to kill, by any means. 
---
Noed should always be assumed a threat. All survivors are responsible for doing what it takes to counter the killers options, like not opening the gates if the killer has a hook coming up, and cleansing the totems before gates are powered. Failing to do so, allows the killer to catch you, and you won't escape. 
---
The propsed balance of 2 kills, 2 escapes, means the gates WILL be powered, the doors WILL be opened, and somewhere before the score screen, 2 people will die. Noed allows some killers to assert dominance in situations where they are losing, and can turn a game around for them. I don't think they should take that away. 
---
If there is a perk where a side is given power they didn't earn, or earned by playing badly then fine, fix it. Noed punishes teams that make the mistake of ignoring its power. That's not the killers fault. Noed isn't always there, but it could be, and when it is, you need to be prepared.
---
Dying state, really helped out buddy.
---
But, adrenaline does work when you‚Äôre in the dying state.
---
ya know what... I like it. That could actually be a pretty okay build for him.
---
I'd prefer to wait 30 minutes to play a real match than wait 3 minutes to get gen rushed and have the match end in 3 minutes.
---
Also bold of you to assume that I'm not still waiting for 30 minutes.
---
Gets you 50-80k per match ( Even if you bloodfarm )
---
Should mention that in order for the killer to grab you out of a vault, you need to be injured
---
There was a guy named ‚Äúsecret/mori=DC‚Äù and i brought a shroud of separation as a troll.
---
He didnt dc unfortunately.
---
I don‚Äôt think my point was entirely clear to you.  
---
You‚Äôre talking about the crutch perk NOED. I agree that it‚Äôs too strong for what it currently does, but it‚Äôs still tied to endgame.  
---
Don‚Äôt you agree that those survivor perks could be considered crutch perks, too?  
---
I haven‚Äôt been playing for too long, I‚Äôm relatively new to the game. I‚Äôve used NOED, and it‚Äôs very strong. I agree that as a survivor it really really sucks getting hit after it activates, since you don‚Äôt see it coming right away. I‚Äôve been a victim of it quite some times now. I wanted to flame the killer, but that would make me a hypocrite. Having the perspective of both sides, I feel as a survivor that it sucks and that the killer sucks. On the other hand, as killer it‚Äôs a very strong perk, and if you‚Äôre having a shitty game it will ensure you (in most games) at least one kill. It‚Äôs an insurance perk. You have 3 perks until 5 gens are completed. 
---
It‚Äôs just not healthy in my opinion to trash talk the other side for playing the game in a way that inconveniences you. Both as survivor and as killer. I‚Äôve dreaded playing killer, because my experience was more often than not that I got survivors that would complain about anything. No matter how much I try to play ‚Äúfair‚Äù, some survivors are never satisfied.  
---
I‚Äôll give you an example: I played a leatherface game today. I hooked a nea about 5 minutes in. 2 other survivors were around that hook. I chased one, but knowing I won‚Äôt catch up(there was a very big loop), I ran back to the hook. Well, there was the other survivor trying to get the unhook. Then I chased her off the hook, then returned to find the other survivor I just chased off trying to get the save. Chase him off, go back, spot the 2nd survivor. Rinse and repeat until the person on the hook was dead. There were 3 gens left to be done. Only one person was on them. Do you feel like, as a survivor main(which I‚Äôm assuming you are), I was in the wrong here? It was a tactical play in my opinion and not so much a ‚ÄúI want to ruin the fun of these players‚Äù situation. I felt bad for the person on the hook, but I had not much choice. I‚Äôm also trying to win as a killer.  
---
Let‚Äôs start over, shall we? We started off on the wrong foot and I‚Äôd just like to understand your perspective and compare mine to meet eachother halfway.
---
hag is also great for points, as setting and having traps triggered are worth points. easy deviousness.   
---
and if you whack em after a teleport!
---
Had a game where we all spawned together beside the hex.  It was haunted grounds and the killer was the spirit.
---
She died for your sins
---
Why you report
---
and once you learn how to play her she's ridiculously lethal. forgot to mention that. check out Space Coconut for some hag pointers on youtube.
---
I do a fake out struggle and fill the bar to 80% if no one is coming to get me and it's safe.
---
I do a spamming grab at the hook if the killer is camping, also feels like I'm taunting them for camping too which lessens the pain of it.
---
True but I feel like camping is usually an indicator of a poor killer which occur less and less at higher ranks while survivors at higher ranks know the best way to put pressure on the killer is to burn gens rapidly as possible. While playing solo some people tend to just assume someone else will do the rescue.
---
"Who am I chasing- what?!"
---
This whole community is aids. Yeah I said it.
---
Freddy is a pedophile
---
Coldwind, especially as a short killer
---
&gt;I'd prefer to wait 30 minutes to play a real match than wait 3 minutes to get gen rushed and have the match end in 3 minutes.
---
&gt;Also bold of you to assume that I'm not still waiting for 30 minutes.
---
I'm sure you would but the thing is, other 100 people wouldn't want to wait and instead, they would spam this sub and devs social medias complaining about queue times. Get the picture? 
---
People complain about queue times, devs make matchmaking wider. 
---
People complain about matchmaking, devs make a stricter matchmaking that causes longer queues.
---
Shock Wave Flash
---
Hag, your totems are going to get destroyed real fast.
---
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it.
---
I‚Äôd problem go TOTH over Whispers just for those extra points
---
Also a Trapper main, I LOVE these proposed changes, but I fear they be too strong for the lower ranks.
---
I already stomp survivors easily as Trapper until about rank 9, which this is when I suspect SWF becomes more popular even if it's only a 2 man or 3 man.
---
I would love to say they can just deal with it but realistically if/when our beloved trap daddy gets his buff/rework those lower ranks are going to play a big part of how they balance him.
---
As long as they atleast increase his amount of traps started with/can carry and the disarm times he will be in a much better place.
---
TBH I just use Whispers and Tremors to find them as fast as possible
---
"Stalked the last 3 gens" otherwise known as doing what youre supposed to do.
---
That being said, if youre camping then your playstyle is directly preventing others from enjoying the game so expect the complaints
---
Well In theory it sounds great TBH.
---
If I'm nurse I get 1 shot on someone, they vault a window and I can see them for 6 seconds allowing an easy follow up.
---
My problem with whispers is that it's too broad and nurse's calling better for more slugging and passive nurse playing.
---
I'm very aggressive and only find It helping me twice a game.
---
I seventeenth that
---
No, 1. A mural is an single offering and you can only bring one. 3 murals appear around the map that need to be cleansed.
---
Yeah I feel your pain, this has happened to me numerous times. I‚Äôve found that every time I jumped off the ledge it spawned me at the closed hatch (I‚Äôm guessing the killer closed it) so I haven‚Äôt tried it but my theory is if you have a key you should be able to get out of it bugs like this but the amount of luck ya need for that to happen is too much to ask for in one game üòû
---
Probably for disconnecting.
---
I started using BL recently and its SO GOOD
---
Wait, she can do that? I have never seen this happen and now I want to. I'm tempted to play nurse just to do this and scare the living shit out of people. Wouldn't even hook them, just down them and walk away as they crawl towards the exit or stay still since the player just died of heart attack
---
Hag or Plague i recommend
---
I said it would LOOK really bad, because that seems hideous and intrusive.
---
What about the pig? Under that mask is a girl.
---
I really want the Chef Rush outfit, it looks super clean.
---
Rip, just got a bunch of new killers. So far not one match without a dc
---
By those terms, Clown and Michael would fit even better, since the Clown literally rode into the Entity's realm and liked it better, and Michael *wanted* to come to the Entity's realm.
---
There's one exception. Michael actually doesn't know what's right or wrong...he wouldn't care regardless. He is pure evil. Right, wrong...they are just words to him. In the grand scheme, he's just pure evil.
---
In the bio it talks about her being young and one of her add-ons is one of her shoes that she lost the night she was taken. It mentions being a child's shoe. At this point she's definitely a lot older but when she was taken by the entity she was still a teenager. I think BHVR never specifically gives her age because they don't want to risk dealing with the potential backlash. I personally think it adds more character to her and makes her story more tragic.
---
Lol
---
Aww yeah. I remember these as P3 Claudette right when huntress came out her map was super dark, plus darkest moonlight, and then purple mist.
---
That's really the only constant I can think of with Michael, that he's just straight malevolence
---
Have you not played high ranks in a bit? I get camped all the time if I run the killer for a solid amount of time and they don't ever get off my ass. Litterally yesterday i had a Ghostface who camped me for taking a down while my friend cleansed his Devour Hope while Thrill of the Hunt was still up. He camped me in stalk while they did gens. Only my 1 friend knew cause we were an swf of 2. But people still understood what waving my arms up ajd down meant, it meant he was camping. This doesn't need changed whatsoever, it helps by telling the team that you are getting camped, so they need to do gens or get me off with Borrowed Time. I ran the guy for 5 gens, while my friend tried getting his attention on him and not me, he took 2 hits for me, but even then they were for distance. So i told him to do a gen and he did 2 by himself while I was chased all game. Then I ended up decisive striking him when I went into a locker and he still chased me lol. Then once the gates were open, everyone bodyblocked for me and we all lived. Moral of the story is that if this is changed, then people wont get gens done against a camping killer, the only reason we escaped was because he camped and tunneled me hardcore, but my teammates knew because I was flailing my arms.
---
&gt; I think the emblems are way better than what we had. 
---
Far away in my memory, but i agree. Its an improvement over what was there before, it was even worse.
---
&gt; Just because you killed all 4 survivors with little effort doesn't mean you should pip
---
I disagree. The point of a ranking system is to match people of equal skill level together. If you are very easily 4King people it means you probably are too good for your current rank.
---
&gt; Needlessly to say there is a huge difference in play style between someone dominating survivors and someone camping but you need to look at this from the scoring system perspective.
---
The best solution to camping would be to increase the time it takes for hook stages imo. Then survivors can simply do gens while killer camps.
---
Yup been playing off and on since beta. I miss pink perks.

&gt;The best solution to camping would be to increase the time it takes for hook stages imo. Then survivors can simply do gens while killer camps.

In your opinion, not in the devs opinion and also the majority of the community (myself included).
---
Don't care. Could be screens of another comment. Your opinions are still garbage.
---
So, like, chasing a survivor till you get him isn't tunneling. 
---
Gotcha! Awesome! Thanks everyone for filling me in on the lingo
---
I thirteenth that
---
No, they bleed while healthy.
---
Doesn't sound very useful
---
I use lithe with dance with me. I‚Äôve lost a lot of killers with this combo during chases.
---
The one who kills for no reason just seems like a wild animal, it almost seems like it doesn't know what it's really doing. The one who tortures people does it to bring misery to others for self pleasure. I don't know about you, but that strikes me as pure evil.
---
IF YOU HAVE SHITTERNET, DON‚ÄôT PLAY KILLER.
---
The only good streamer is a small streamer, and they're the ones who mostly have ttv in their names nowadays. Big streamers that use that deserve every Iridescent Head Ebony they get, because it's just greed at that point.
---
ok. 
---
hey consider suscribing and thanks for saying im good.
---
well with Ghost Face it makes more sense for it to be a killer just using the persona than it does to have a specific ghost face killer, i think. 
---
It's really unfortunate that it's reboot based because when i think of elm street i don't think preschool, i don't think male survivor, i don't think 2010.
---
Like it isn't how Freddy looks that bothers me because like....i don't see him while i play him it's everything else that's bothersome because it's just a shame that it isn't as true to the series as Michael and Leatherface and Amanda
---
I believe you can't buy Meyers and stuff with shards because licensed killers
---
Wraith is a good one, but I typically recommend Leatherface to new killers. It teaches you to really learn the game since he‚Äôs looped pretty hard and earn some sweet BPs with BBQ.
---
We already have cosmetics that drastically change butt size. May as well add one in that makes claudette david's size (except the head ofcourse)
---
A wild animal kills for food, protection, and territory, it knows exactly what it's doing. Freddy kills for pleasure, Michael kills because he's evil. Michael is pure evil.
---
I feel like the Other Mother is more like a distant taxonomic relative of the Entity.

How do you have 54k subs but can't even break 1000 views on your videos? For comparison usylis has 43k subs and gets like 20-50k views a video.

I like the closet idea. But maybe not all closets, just a number of closets she can trap cause the trapper has a limit too.

It‚Äôs not true it‚Äôs bullshit I didn‚Äôt do it. I DID NAT!
---
No, not at all. The devs said they were going to look at how much it and the Blindness add ons were used because so many people called them utter shit.

That said, they've never done anything about the countless other Haemmorhage and Blindness add ons despite nobody using them.

-huntress main.
---
Mortal Kombat was different though, both fatalities were references to the first movie, and he was voiced by Robert Englund, it didn't look like him, but it wasn't necessarily based on the reboot just because it came out a year later.
---
the black and red sweater would've been a thing even if it was classic freddy, just because green &amp; red isn't easy on the eyes
---
What does classic freddy even look like in mkx mobile?
---
I named Billy Loomis because if they got the rights to that version of Ghostface we could've had a survivor like Sydney along with it. But as you said Ghostface can be anyone really so it doesn't matter much either way. 
---
Hopefully we eventually get some version of original Freddy as a cosmetic maybe but atleast the reboot is better than nothing.
