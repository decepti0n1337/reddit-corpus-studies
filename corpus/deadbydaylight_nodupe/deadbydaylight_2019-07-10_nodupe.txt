Good news for you, there’s an add-on that does exactly that.
---
---
---
Ok but what if you think they have devour?
---
Played the Dude card on him.
---
Its amazing 😮
---

---
(He needs some vaseline on them elbows xD)
---
This, a million times this. I love spirit!
---
He definitely wasn’t the worst killer in the game I have no idea where you got that from his power is way to good dude. I’ve gone against 4 Freddy’s in the past 3 days using perks to drop their terror radius down to 2 meters combined with his power he’s ridiculously strong
---
ngl I feel it too...
---
1. The perk opens up the back of the locker in a kind of portal to the basement, so there's room.
---
2. Two buttons.
---
It looks broken, but it isn’t. Trust me. I just made a post and I hope it opens your eyes
---
If a Freddy has slower progression add-ons you probably will want to wake up with failed skillchecks
---
Unless your team is a pair of dipshits
---
I sent this to my boyfriend and [got this gem in return](https://imgur.com/a/AHNeevg)
---
Yeah, how dare you not stand still in the corner so that we, the true heroes of this game, can rush the gens and flashlight you freely! Toxic fucks like you are ruining this game. /s
---
tbh from what i've seen of hexy's stream, current rework of freddy is actually well balanced, no buff needed.
---
That’s a add on in his base kit there’s no point in leaving dream world
---
Okay did that, also double-checked the file to make sure vsync was still false, but it doesn't seem to be working. Still 60 fps in-game.
---
Unbalanced does not show something with too much power. Old Legion was unbalanced because he had no counter play but without some good add-ons or use of the exploits no one would call him overpowered.
---
What about the snairs? There really weak
---
Yes there is, the more people in the dream world, the quicker his gen teleport recharges, and when you’re in the dream world, you are affected by dream pallets and snares. Making loops much more difficult.
---
Even then, killers just swing. If the survivor jumps out and is downed there is no stun.
---
Hexy said snairs &gt; fake pallets.
---
Mori'ing in the exit gateway is the best part of this game.
---
Nice Jake outfit.

Stop. Not all kids are like this, can you imagine if you were a kid and whenever your peers did something stereotypical you and your friends start getting bashed? You can't pull the stay in your zone card because the kid zone is rather small and you only get bashed harder for being in the kids zone as a Kid, and when the people who belong in the kid zone go in the "adult zone" the kids who belong their get bashed. I get this isn't to be taken seriously but just be a little understanding please?
---
So guys, we did it. 
---
How, you must be the entity.
---
Lol you have 5 seconds to get away from the gen also dream pallets and snairs are cool but if you know how to loop they won’t really affect you
---
I don’t know how I’d even do that. I made them myself, so I only have the skins themselves as pictures.
---
You gonna be posting all the new ones ?
---
Ooff that stings. People have a hard enough time with survival points. It doesn't affect me much thoigh because I never get to escape.
---
Definitely leatherface for his perks. BBQ is such an amazing perk for both grinding and just play in general. Franklins is also pretty strong against bully squads with flashlights.  
---
  
---
My second choice would probably be Of Flesh and Mud. Hag has some pretty good perks - I love devour hope and ruin is super strong. Third seal is okay. Ace's perks aren't necessarily the most powerful but they have some good utility, in particular ace in the hole is good when combined with plunderer's.  
---
Thirdly... Spark of Madness might be good, mostly for the doctor and his perks.  
---
Generally survivors have a pretty strong perk pool without dlc. Most of the strongest perks for them, such as borrowed time, dead hard, adrenaline, etc are baseline. For killers, a lot of their perks are tied to dlc killers. And given that different killers unlike survivors actually change the gameplay based on your choice, I'd strongly recommend buying dlc based on the killer instead of the survivor.
---
I do have an idea of why this happened. I was awarded BP for completing games for the DBD PTB vanilla test. Maybe these awarded BP's did not count towards the 1 mil BP cap?
---
Whoa, this is one of the best concept of a killer that I’ve ever seen on here tbfh. I kept hearing people saying they wanted Jason in the game, but never knew how he’d be able to work, like with his power and all, but this is actually super awesome and in depth. Well done! 😌
---
I mean, this happens once, twice and then you should know better than to fall for it again... either slug him if you think he has ds or go after someone else, if they force themselves into you it means they're not on gens which is a plus for you. It's honestly so easy playing around it.
---
You should watch tru
---
How long have you been playing?
---
The Jeff and Kate skins are Must Haves for me.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Is there anything you think is too strong? I'm always open to criticism.
---
In the coming days, I'm going to add the Survivor for this chapter concept. It's going to be Whitney from the 2009 movie as well.
---
Also, I went and edited the formatting to be easier to read.
---
If a particular survivor used Deadhard earlier in the match, next time they're injured and you're confident you'll get a hit, don't swing right away. Drive forward as much as you can into their rear bumper and make them think you're about to hit them. They'll use Deadhard and then you can swing risk free right after.
---
Pls god pls no
---
Its a sad day when a brown add-on is significantly better than a purple add-on.
---
Suppose this is the devs way of trying to make bloodhound meta for Freddy.
---
Im about to go to work but ill do nurses really quick
---
I'll let you decide that ;)
---
I'm sorry the answer you were looking for was "Your mother Trebek "
---
I plan to eventually get all the dlc at some point, are there any you would recommend i definitely save for last?
---
You were being toxic and passive-aggressive when you answered my question though. Don't try to paint yourself as the bigger person LOL
---
Template pls
---
Jesus christ, its jason bourne
---
Hasn't the ptb been out for like 2 days. How long do people think it takes to get used to a killer
---
I took a 6-8 month break from the game and I feel refreshed and dont get angry anymore. Maybe try that
---
Bwaaaaaaaa haaaaaaa haaaaa haaaaaaaaa I trust my barber.
---
I like my food the way I like my survivors.
---
Kidney stone-inducing levels of salty.
---
I have NOED available to most of my killers but I have never used it. Seems too easy of a perk and I have had it used on me a lot. Its tempting on certain ones, like Freddy when he already has to pull someone in the dream state, and then 1 or potentially 2 hits before they get out, especially when so much of his own perks are built around the end game
---
I'd like to see David and Jake training Mewtwo and Giratina.
---
So on the second day you played, you had the teachables from 4 different killers on Myers all at tier 3? Do you honestly expect me to believe that? Why even lie? That's just pathetic.
---
And I have a enormous amount of hate,because that usually means a Derank.
---
You can do it! 
---
Just have fun and ignore idiots who tell you you suck.
---
The snare makes lots of bloodied arms reach out at the survivor when triggered.
---
You didn't reaaaally expect to pip with mori and what it looks like 4-5 hooks now, did you?
---
I watch both guys actually. True is usually on during morning/early afternoon, while hexy is more during evening.
---
He made it up because he's mad and thinks people don't pay attention
---
Cut the crap. The community as a whole is toxic, killer included.
---
Number of times I've seen team mates face camped because they dared to run away or loop the killer for longer than they want.
---
It happens on both sides.
---
Lmao I would love to see the flying dutchman! 😂
---
Noob question, but why is it more expensive than the rest?
---
Yeah, I have been rank 2 at best, but was too tired to play to rank  it. Now I am  just 13 since I have not played a lot after latest reset. I think, you do not need any specific build for that.  I noticed that gameplay always gets better after you get under rank 10 for the reason that your random teammates get better. Playing  at rank 13 is horrible as noob teams are literally suicidal and have a deathwish. 
---
I have DS, lithe, mettle of man and urban evasion.  I do not have self care at the moment, but it is actually often very useful.
---
The feeling you get when you play the huntress and hit a sick snipe.
---
Sarcasm? xD Sorry, I can't tell.
---
Darkness among us is kind of meh, the saw chapter is okay at best. I wouldn't get those any time soon unless you plan on actually using the killers from them. The bloodstained sack, charity case and head case aren't worth getting at all, but they're debatably not real dlc.
---
I can’t wait to see it! 😌
---
Ptb came out today, which is even worse
---
When chasing a survivor thats injured, the ones with dead hard usually run in a straight line. They do this because they're looking back waiting for you to start to swing so they can dodge it with their dead hard. 
---
Instead of lunging into a survivor to get the hit, just keep following them untill your are right against them. Once you're close enough, it forces the survivor to use dead hard because your close enough just tapping the swing will down them. They use it, and jump forward, but because you didn't swing you can just walk and close the distance. Hit. Downed.
---
Good surviviors will look back less often and move more sporadically, so it becomes harder to tell if they have dead hard. But thats the fundamentals of baiting dead hard.
---
That’s it’s place. I’d argue New Freddy can get a lot of value out of it as well, he’s got great Add-Ons. Perks that are good on certain killers are more interesting than perks that every killer should run.
---
Thana for console players
---
The problem is, from what I've read at least, the stuff they've added to survival is in no way shape or form going to add up to a thousand points a match on average. This actually Nerf the entire subset by adding a bunch of little shit that's hard to achieve than just escaping.
---
I don’t get how that makes the difference.
---
"Please don't kill me, Mr.Voorhees, I want to be in the knock-off version!"
---
I think it could reveal the aura of the hatch within a certain radius, maybe 16m, and it be somewhat useful as the last survivor with the new end game without intruding on any other perks or being too strong.
---
I feel like if you run dead hard you're a pussy
---
*JUDITH'S TOMBSTONE AND TUFT OF HAIR INTESIFY*!
---
like dude im all for the "people who run decisive should be put in a zoo" but death threats about people who complain about tunneling is like mmm a bit much i feel
---
The trapper sets traps.
---
Good ol Mug
---
I don’t believe Breakdown should cost 2700, as his DLC only came in December. Surely it’s 2000, right?
---
Buff freddy’s hand BHVR 😡
---
Yeah it's kinda dumb but whatever. I barely play survivor so I feel like I don't really have a right to complain
---
That makes sense, it REALLY was hyped. Still though, if it does come out cells only I'll be sad.
---
My favorite thing to do is to camp the last couple generators. With her  surveillance perk you can just run back and forth cause they have no choice but to fix one of em. I like trapping towards the end too. I almost always get 4ks and if not it's a 3k.
---
I think because it's a perk from a recent DLC but I think that's a bullshit excuse because we're multiple DLC's past Legion and Jeff.
---
Hospital gown laurie would be the besttt
---
Literally a few hours maximum
---
Comes from nurse some people like to play characters they level
---
*"If you counter my perk I'm not the stupid one. It is in fact YOU who is the stupid one!"*
---
YES.  I've been waiting for Surveillance for my Spirit build for a while now.
---
I hooked everyone at least twice, even the guy I moried. The problem is that they kept stepping in my traps and I didn't get to chase them much because of that.
---
I play both, because I have friends that play dead by daylight and you can't play with them as killer. It sucks that playing with my friends means I get less points.
---
Would you do Kates next ? I’d love to see her new outfit clearer
---
Not being sarcastic, genuinely well played.
---
Behaviour Studios! Hear my plea! Bring us Grim!
---
Got a message calling me bad after i downed an AFK dwight
---
&gt;When you get a rework but Rank 20s who used to main you are complaining that you don't have an infinite supply of crutches anymore
---
Perks cost 2700 shards the first time they appear on the shrine.
---
Just time your dead hard right.
---
What a swole boy!!
---
Seems very Incan-inspired. I have flashback to TinTin's "Seven Crystal Balls".
---
She's gooing to be a little harder, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. 
---
I have a distraction-type perk like how she distracted Jason with the necklace.
---
Two minutes? It obviously takes two minutes, that is why they get killed by the first person in the PTB they go against. It totally isn't because they are still learning how to combat the new version of the killer.
---
Yup, I played about 11 hours a day, and when I took that screenshot it was at the end of my 2nd day, totalling 22 hours. Not that hard.
---
The said the same about never having a clown killer at one point and eventually went back on it, I wouldn't rule it out entirely.
---
That’s pretty shitty, but thanks!
---
I like that marked idea, to make Death the ultimate pursuer. You can run, but eventually, he'll get ya. Like the obsession leaves scratch marks even when walking or something.
---
Yeah I have a friend who will sometimes ask me to play survivor with him but I never solo queue as survivor because I hate it. Sometimes it seems like I'm the only killer in the game who doesn't camp/tunnel
---
The Huntress hunts
---
It really do be like that sometimes.
---
Ooooo I like that idea; I’m excited to see what you bring to the table! 😌
---
Can't believe they actually nerfed head on. Oh well
---
*time to commit toaster bath*
---
 Epic
---
I mean preferring to go for the survivor with the med kit so they can't use it, rather than survivors with no items, is literally just the correct play.
---
The beauty of playing killer is making your own rules, and it feels shitty when you break them.
---
I personally never intentionally kill survivors, I just torment them with my delay build until they inevitably win.... 45 minutes later
---
Also, solo queuing as Survivor is basically signing up to have your shit pushed in haha. You get no help and have no communication.
---
Failed gens and thrill have the same sound. You have to pay attention to where the visual queue comes from
---
wtf
---
Baiting DeadHard..Hey that's illegal!
---
How many games do you play where you do zero healing?
---
Watch out for the crapper, don't step in his craps
---
I’m from one exact year in the future, did it download yet?
---
That's why. Any time you're awarded BPs by BHVR, they can go over the cap. I'd still spend some just to be safe though...
---
Yeah, but that’s my problem. I’m busy chasing a survivor or looking in a direction I can’t look away from, but would do a 180 if I knew it was Thrill popping.
---
There *is* more to this. This post cuts off the addition of 2000+ additional points:
---
* Reduced the Escaping score event bloodpoint reward from 5000 to 4000.
---
* Increased the Hatch Escape score event from 2000 to 2500.
---
* Increased the Killer Blind score event from 250 to 400 (outside of a chase).
---
* Increased the Killer Blind score event from 250 to 500 (while in a chase).
---
* Increased Cleansing (dull totem) from 600 to 1000.
---
* Increased Cleansing (hex totem) from 1000 to 1500.
---
* Increased Map Scout from 150 to 250.
---
* Increased healing an ally without a medkit before the exits were powered from 400 to 500 (percentage based).
---
* Increased healing an ally without a medkit after the exits were powered from 500 to 700 (percentage based).
---
Yupper! Since I started over a year ago it’s been stupid as fuck for the little points you get playing as survivor, now if I play killer 30-31k points almost every game not including if I burned a pudding or streamer the. Also bbq-chili points on top of that! But I don’t like playing killer all the time!
---
Yeah I assumed so. Kinda want to stay over 1 mil tho 😂
---
Ikr? This upcoming skin is best skin to date. It's sad :/
---
Spirit!
---
Omfg I did this to myself just the other day
---
Ikr? I'm sick. Can they please come up with something else
---
Ah another new rule ?! Thanks !
---
i... had no idea...
---
&gt;believing a survivor who you killed
---
woah, it's really cool that you can talk to dead people!
---
I can see both sides of this. I think that if you're going to slug as a killer then survivors should be able to Unbreakable themselves back to their feet.
---
This is why we serpentine
---
It’s not very well known tbh, and it’s not mentioned anywhere in game except patch notes. The devs refer to it as trap buffering I think???
---
Yup, this. If there's a single defector, everyone should cleanse immediately. If nobody defects, nobody should cleanse until people start going down or she gets an apple charge.
---
But if you're in chat, get everyone on-board if you're going to cleanse, because you otherwise just screw everyone else over.
---
This shouldn’t be downvoted. This also doesn’t mention the 10+ minutes of matchmaking each time you play as killer
---
What can I say. 
---
You gotta pay better attention then.
---
Wicked Wares was a pretty great meg skin Tbf. I think this skin is painfully plain and I hate the braids personally.
---
feels good
---
Me: *counts the times I hook survivors so that I hook every survivor twice to get my max sacrifice points while the survivor all survive*
---
The survivor I hook for the second time: *dies*
---
It hurts so badly
---
I think they were so angry that they transcended to a past life as a 50's comic typographer.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cb9gwi/anyone_had_this_bug_before/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This is cute lol
---
I have a build for Doctor that is exactly this. All screaming, fake pallets, bonus skill checks, and generator regression. I call it “No Fun Allowed” and use it to irritate players until they just give up
---
Whatever gives the Nightmare most control in the dream world. Aura reading was very useful but I like the idea of adapting the Hag-type teleport as Freddy should be everywhere at once, playing with his victim before gutting them. He is the Nightmare so whatever makes you pucker your butthole while playing lol
---
Aw, yes. But when I’m not playing killer, the totem is in the most obscure spot, tucked away in the tightest corner of the map.
---
herman you’re doing great sweetie
---
It's a simple spell, but quite unbreakable
---
It was the rework in the PTB
---
Everything Freddy did prior is gone now. Only new abilities.
---
Thanks
---
Bruh I am a 12 Y/O kid
---
"Exposed". It's a good time to go and save that guy in the basement as a whole team.
---
WGLF could do that, but unlike BBQ there isn't a benefit
---
Could they drink the margarita's?  Did they get any pleasure from them?  AFAIK, if so that would be the only actual pleasurable experience they would have had since becoming survivors.
---
Surveillance is decent, however maybe just keep your shards :)
---
Savage 
---
I love gen grabbing with her.
---
Poor meg
---
this is probably why I have a negative view on pig and think she's a shit killer. Most of the one's I go against literally just camp and tunnel the person with the trap on their head.
---
Consol players lmao
---
Didn't they also say they were going to start giving survival points for time in the trial.
---
I remember never being able to get past rank 19 back when you could go down in brown ranks. It feels good to grow, doesn't it?
---
*not really you mostly just abused the survivor sided gameplay design by looping pallets and rushing :P*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So... played to the best of their abilities??
---
And if WGLF had any actual in game effect it would easily outclass any perk in that category that did that same thing. The best thing they could do is add We’ll Make It into WGLF and just have it be like that.
---
I mean, I play mostly killer, but agree with the most common survivor rules (don't camp, don't tunnel and don't hit hooked survivors on purpose)
---
Have you been living under a rock? Pig is literally getting two skins within the next two weeks.
---
You should be altruistic. Saving your teammates is part of the game.
---
don't blame the french, they can't help themselves
---
Hemorrhage * and it increases the amount you bleed which makes it more visible to the killer .
---
Even when I cared to get rank 1,back when huntress was new, no nurses.
---
What are gens?
---
He is my role model.
---
You too kind stranger!. I hope you die in 100 years!
---
You know if you didn’t run *behind* that wall and waste a lot of time, you would’ve made it.
---
If the killers actually gay then the jokes on them..
---
Then they should all be secret:) why do I need to know if a killer is getting extra bloodpoints and visa versa?
---
He's woah what how'd I get here
---
Finally a new Kate Denson cosmetic that looks good.
---
Don't worry, we're probably gonna have to wait a bit for these new skins.
---
That's not sarcasm though. You actually have told someone before so you can't be being sarcastic. I don't think you know what that word means. It's being passive-aggressive, "dog".
---
just had almost the exact same thing happen on my 3rd killer game. got called the worst killer ever, and then less nice, more racist, stuff. like, fuck, I just bought the game yesterday, and I'm trying to learn
---
Oh I totally agree with those rules, but it’s all the other dumb ones I was referring to. Such as the one in OP’s post.
---
who runs more than one exhaustion perk anyways?
---
You are doing the lords work, but I fear it's a wasted effort. I appreciate you trying to explain it to people, even if they dont seem to get it.
---
I was a fan in the dark souls days also and just found out he played DbD a couple months ago only :)
---
Don't know OP's reason but from what I could see, that guy was tunneller.  I'd teabag any camper and tunneller as they deserve it.  There are 3 other players he could shift his focus on but his toxic mentality won't allow him to do that.  A less experienced survivor always suffer against POS like that GF.
---
"The killer killed us, welp lets explain how outsmarting us was wrong" - too many fucking survivors.
---
No
---
Generators
---
And be careful which thread you say that in here. Otherwise you'll get downvoted to hell.
---
Last night I was a Feng named Hook if Mega Gay with a friend named Hook if Double Gay!! And we ran into a killer with the name hella gay!
---
What that smile that he is mechanically forced to have with his eyes pride open?
---
LOL toxic
---
Babylon was different time then the black death
---
but when everyone's trying to get unhooks pretty much fighting for wglf stacks it becomes counter-productive
---
I've got nothing against balanced landing itself, that perk deserves more spots to use it. My problem is when they put every generator in the map on the second story of a house (haddonfield)
---
If they got Sunglasses Freddy literally everyone would buy it
---
What are generators? 🤣 It's 2019, the objective is to be altruistic until everyone is dead then go for hatch.
---
Some people seem to like her based on her noise when getting slammed by pallet.  I don't think I'll ever understand that.  Her personality on screen and her behaviour based on her players are just all around unpleasant.
---
I’ve got 29 rainbow maps just sitting around and allot of Chrystal beads
---
I get most of the common survivor complaints, but I really don't think survivors should complain about slugging.
---
Unlike tunneling and camping, you're working towards the objective of killing all survivors instead of focusing on killing 1. You're also giving a survivor an extra chance.
---
I think the reason people always run self care is because of how medkits are a precious commodity and sometimes your team is unreliable so you have to do the job yourself (same with hatch 1v1’s) if you don’t have a medkit or adrenaline your most likely going to be screwed in the endgame
---
I wouldn't mind a change to his teleportation that hides scratch marks for a few seconds after teleportation.
---
What's the difference between BP offerings marked "personal" and ones that aren't? Do the ones that aren't marked personal apply to everyone where applicable?
---
Yeah yesterday I was the n word and some homophobic slurs and a try hard because I got 4k without camping or tunneling, actively trying to avoid hitting the same person twice. You can't try win in their eyes, and I'm a survivor main. I see it on both sides most every game.
---
TRUMP 2020
---
Killers in a nutshell. I once saw a post that said killers are the most important role in the game and that survivors should have p no perks and should be 1 v 3 to be fair. The guy seemed pretty serious.
---
*The Creeper*
---
*Power:Explosion*
---
I think my brain just got sacrificed in real life
---
Holy shit
---
I know survivors say "not all survivors are toxic, blah blah" but there enough buddy fuckers, pallet teabagge,  ECT to make it feel that way. It's about every other game at green ranks that I get a survivor who leads the killer to teammates or farms a guy off a hook or body blocks a teammate or something. I think it's why a good chunk of survivors play survivor, because they watch popular YouTubers being toxic to killers, and find it funny, and want to replicate It, and when they can't they settle for briefing teammates. Again it's no where close to All, or even most survivors, but it's enough that every solo survivor main runs into at least one each play session.
---
Imagine cleansing Devour Hope, I'd personally be against that change.
---
Play a different game. Like, literally any other game.
---
bUT CAMPER
---
Nope
---
This is the closest thing we gonna get to shirtless trapper
---
Everyone is missing the second part of this change where they made the perk actually work.
---
Botany Knowledge seems like a better ace medic perk
---
Damb
---
This happens when BHVR gives you bloodpoints for what ever reason. People were losing their save data a while back and they were giving them like 10 million bp to compensate.
---
They did, that's the second change to head on that everone's ignoring
---
No, I just was afk for like 15 minutes then the game shut down, I wasn’t trying to shut off my laptop or anything
---
Story of my life
---
Nah that’s not what happened, I was just afk for like 15 and then that happened
---
Is there a reason she shouldn’t be? Any add on that gives her extra blinks she be super rare, if she blinks next to you there is nothing you can do. With billy you can run around objects and stuff to make him miss. Pallets don’t work, running at nurse when’s she about to blink doesn’t work on anything above a noob nurse, retreading steps only works at best once before a good nurse kicks the shit out of you. If there no counter play it does not belong. For example Noed you can at least destroy totems.
---
Me:steps in bear trap that I saw the trapper place just 7 seconds ago
---
My brain:
---
It’s because hiding in a locker is seen as a sign of weakness, and the weak need to be weeded out.
---
It's Ashe
---
So because your teammates are bad players, that’s the perks fault? Like even if all 4 people brought WGLF, like at some point you have to realize that swarming the hook like flies gets you all killed and 2 stacks off of 7k points is not worth.
---
As a killer main I say spirit and myers are my top 2. not sure about my 3rd though
---
Quick and quiet is an awesome perk, and Surveillance is a must have on specific builds, like Spirit Gen Snatcher. Definitely worth picking up if you are a killer main and don't want to level up Pig or don't have the DLC:)
---
I hooked a guy and he left and immediately said since I missed one kill I lost even though I killed the other three
---
SCP-106 has broken containment!
---
If it says personal it’s just for you. If it designates for everyone or all players then it applies like that.
---
"Ok, I'll suicide, and that should give him enough time to esca-"
---
#"GOD DAMMIT"
---
I once had a guy tell me he was going to kill me. Just ignore the shit community and have fun
---
bruh
---
Not true. Dc's can totally fuck you over as killer and prevent you from pipping.
---
I've been playing without it for months and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Once you do, you realize how much time survivors waste trying to self care themselves, especially through sloppy butcher. Like seriously? I don't mind if they self care if they have botany knowledge and resilience since it's actually quite fast, but nobody ever runs that combo.
---
I feel like you've been dying for an excuse to use the toy story meme and you've succeeded in using it directing it appropriately to this game. Bravo.
---
No I meant he says I loss the match because I failed to kill someone I still pipped
---
Here's the thing:  I'm pretty new to the game, and I'll be the first one to admit that I have a lot of room to improve.  My highest level survivor is 27, and that's Feng.  
---
I've got a few perks to help with being stealthy, and Lithe as a last resort perk.  
---
I dunno, I just wish my teammates would, you know, **focus on the objectives and work together** instead of being toxic.
---
How dare you assume things about my internet piss jugs for you reeeeee
---
"Respect the 4%, you gotta let me go"
---
Well, the thing is some, don't designate personal OR for all players. They just put "hey, here's increased BP" like [this one](https://i.imgur.com/FSfG39X.png)
---
Surely the pretty good job so far guy is like... Swedish or something
---
Nope, just checked on my switch. Not in Nintendo e-Shop.
---
How dare a persona take time and effort to learn a difficult killer in order to reach a high skill ceiling to play a character
---
Just play normally. Try to do gens, get saves and good chases. You don’t need to survive with survivor it’s SUPER easy to pip even without surviving. Just play your part and you should at least safety pip
---
This is super relatable
---
You said it yourself, console player. The vast majority of the playerbase is on pc where it's a lot less common for killers to ragequit.
---
&gt;On another note, if I escape a trial, I should (at bare minimum) break even. I see no reason why, if I escape, I should ever de-pip. That's just ridiculous.
---
Let me introduce you to my proposed pip system I'm trying to spread trough the community
---
Pip system for killer:
---
0k or 1k -&gt; -1 pip
---
2k -&gt; 0 pips
---
3k -&gt; 1 pip
---
4k -&gt; 2 pips
---
Pip system for survivor:
---
0 or 1 escapes -&gt; -1 pip
---
2 escapes -&gt; 0 pips
---
3 or 4 escapes -&gt; 1 pip
---
If you escape: +1 bonus pip
---
Canadian actually
---
No shit, huh? I only heard it for the first time yesterday.
---
The gates were powered, so although the one I hooked was part of the SWF and they were as healed as you'd expect, they just left him.
---
Focus on the objectives? Someone’s being useless in a locker. Work together? Someone’s being unhelpful in a locker. And it’s not even toxic. Kind of just a joke.
---
Try not to die. Works for either side.
---
Dude ever since Ghostface came out I swear the sound for the killers have become even more loud threw what it was before.
---
It happens just as often, if not more often on pc lmao.
---
I’d honestly like a study on this lol maybe it’s because on pc you can actually be banned for disconnecting, whereas on console they don’t give a shit about bans or punishing players? 🤔 it’s almost like they put more focus on the pc playerbase than the consoles.
---
just don't face-camp or tunnel 1 person all game, and if you still get salt in chat then that's their problem
---
If someone DCs you have to let the rest of the survivors escape
---
That's playing killer right? Cuz jesus its making it feel almost impossible to hear survivors sometimes cuz of how loud all the killer noises are now.
---
Does he have a French accent or something? Or am I just stupid?
---
Say goodbye to your precious devotion!
---
To be fair, us Wraith mains have encountered a lot of survivors who don't seem to notice the shimmer.
---
Maybe it's just a regional thing then. Or rank-based. What's your region/rank? Personally as a rank 7-ish survivor in AU I rarely see killers DC.
---
Canada is half French and English. So he was probably born on the French side
---
I agree with your general statement, but not with your wording, so let me fix a few of your sentences so that I can fully agree
---
&gt;I honestly don't understand why the killer needs to get so much more BP than survivors
---
I honestly don't understand why survivors get so much less BP than killers
---
&gt;Also why do killers get a sick perk that gives double BP and survivors don't?
---
Also why don't survivors get a sick perk that gives double BP like the killers have?
---
Then train your mindset to getting 2 or 3 kills is a win.
---
I wish they’d punish people for disconnecting. I don’t think survivors get any points for a killer DC. I honestly feel like it should count as an escape- 5,000 BP
---
I believe they did increase the volume for killer and survivor noises. I know survivors seem to sound horribly loud breathing and groaning when injured after the last update.
---
I was just wondering. I remember him having an accent of some kind, wasn't sure what. The voice in OP's video sounds more like an American/English Canadian accent to me.
---
Lemme spell it out for yall
---
1 less survivor in the match -&gt; gens go slower -&gt; game goes slower -&gt; more time to farm for emblems.
---
Tactical. Advantage.
---
Killers get a ton of points so it really doesn't matter unless everyone leaves
---
You can’t wait for dead hard is one I’ve heard recently or you have to let the last survivor get hatch of one survivor dcs.
---
&gt;You should be altruistic.
---
One of the worst advises you can give to survivors. Unless you're a killer main and want easier games
---
Damn.. that sucks.  My only other experience with a game like this is Friday 13th, and I got really great playing as Jason (I usually managed to kill everyone), but I always preferred playing a counselor.  
---
This game really seems to depend more on teamwork, though.  Maybe I should be a killer main.
---
Funny story earlier I was scratched mirror Myers, doing very poorly bc I just got him, and someone DC against me. Who DC's a scratched mirror Myers??
---
Lmao you are not getting 30k and a safety pip
---
Hey so is the rework on ps4 yet?
---
Brutal.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. There are many games where I’ve done well and would have gotten a good amount of points, but the killer disconnects. It’s very unfair. However, reports on console do basically nothing, and you can’t really contact Sony about anything in the game. Maybe if we get dedicated servers, they’ll do something about it, but I am still doubtful. The devs play on PC themselves, and if a “majority of the playerbase” (which I would be interested to see the numbers on how many people actually play across the platforms- id argue it’s possible there’s more on console, since the game was free for psn and on a game pass for Xbox recently- never heard of it being free on pc) is on pc, unfortunately, I don’t think they’d even bother, since it would cost them more money, time, and effort than it would be worth (in their eyes).
---
Ah makes sense. I'm a Jeff main when it comes to survior and I'm realizing I get heard now way to easily even when not injured lol
---
Entity he's doing it sideways
---
😭😭😭
---
That is not normal unless you prestiged your characters, I would make a technical support post to BHVR
---
0-1 kill is a loss. 2 kills are a draw. 3 are a win. 4 is a perfect.
---
In any fighting game, perfects are rare. Use this mindset and you'll be golden
---
Prayer Beads Bracelet is in the game, sol it's fair to use. So is the Leave Match button \*shrug*
---
Neat
---
So is slugging and yet you complain about it anyway.
---
He has a sort of American Canadian accent with a bit of French so yeah you wouldn't be too far off but I think they probably didn't expect anyone to get the line because it takes too long which is why they probably got him to do it
---
*Judith's tombstone would like to know your location*
---
You're not allowed to use noed ever even though it's a legit perk..
---
I haven't gotten to the point where I can prestige anyone so I'll contact BHVR, thanks
---
Honestly those are the exact people I do not want on my team lol like ffs go do a gen why tf are you taunting the killer when we could be done with objectives by now?
---
I once suggested on the official forums that wglf should also disable the unhook notification sound but they told me it would be too op and wglf is fine as it is.
---
Can the killer predict with 100% accuracy when the survivor will use dead hard to avoid a swing? No.  
---
Understanding that would require basic game sense.  
---
Which, as stated, has been ignored here.  
---
The point being that predicting when dead hard should be used is equally unpredictable from either side, and being salty about it equally ignores that fact.
---
you cant look up during the pick up animation, and there's not always a wall to look at either

Holy shit I thought that series was just like a fever dream or some shit. I remember telling it to my sister trying to remember the name and she said

---
We laughed and forgot about it.
---
Shut it Steve!
---
Two people dc at game start, you are not pipping at red ranks.
---
What system you on?
---
I remember being legit depressed when the main guy got unwound. Then they Frankenstein's him back together
---
I can agree with this unfortunately
---
Just think of it like this the devs intended killers to get about 2 kills a game
---
I'd recommend trying both survivor and killer some, playing one will give you a better idea of your opponents and their capabilities when you play the other. I can give a few more and more specific tips depending on what you need to know about. Don't get me wrong I'm not the best player in the world but I have a good 650 ish hours and I like helping new players.
---
My ideal world would have the last survivor alive changed dramatically when hooked. 1st phase depletes in about 10 seconds, while also allowing the same number of Kobe attempts (just make it not reduce the bar or something in that case). If you hit phase 2/are hooked phase 2, you’re immediately killed and given the struggle points (maybe a little extra for being last alive). If you’re already on the hook and survivor 3 dies, it changes to this outcome. 
---
It’d be really complicated to implement with what I’m assuming is the finest Italian spaghetti code, but it’d make the end of match procedures more bearable.
---
Shit, did Connor get unwound? I need to reread it immediately.
---
He had to endure for over a year before he was let loose.
---
If someone taunts you with teabagging to make you chase them, don't do it because it's to distract you and make yo.
---
Bill man bad grrrrrrrr
---
Yea,last book. A parts pirate got him. (Nelson I think) and he went out in peace,listening to the song the librarian told him about. (Smells like teen spirit,I think)
---
Thank you so much! I'm always so nervous playing online games so it's nice to get some extra info.
---
Ok, so how is me hiding in a locker for a few seconds so detrimental to the team?  
---
The choice was either be seen and try to loop (which I suck at and don't have perks for), or hide long enough to get back out and finish the generator.
---
In the games I've played, I stick to being stealthy and I typically finish more generators than any of the randoms I play with. I don't get how that's not a contribution.
---
Just rework looping. The best killers in the game (in my opinion, plz no hate) are nurse, spirit, and hag and the only reason they’re so good is that they don’t need to worry about looping as much.  So that wouldn’t change anything about those three and would MASSIVELY change the success of the weaker killers like bubba, trapper, and legion. That’s just my opinion on it and you’re completely entitled to yours!
---
Quentin must straight up DIE
---
US and rank 1-3 on both sides.
---
Can we get a Scary Terry skin?
---
As a survivor, don't be afraid to get hit. Don't take someone immediately off the hook. Don't use pallets willy-nilly. Watch a few streamers to get a good flow going. Watching streamers really helped my survivor game.
---
For killer: don't get caught up in a long chase if a survivor is looping you, go after someone else.
---
I play survivor almost exclusively,  I say as long as you don't face camp, do what ever works for you. Face camping will always be looked at as the bitch move it is.
---
Will do!
---
I guess I've been out of the loop. When the hell did they make a Mobile port? The Steam version breaks every patch, the console's patches are always delayed. They barely take the time to rework killers now. But on the bright side now while I'm on lunch at work I can be chased by a 5-blight nurse
---
Ps4
---
The problem is they nerfed one of the only scoring events in the hardest category to score in (survival) while also buffing points in arguably the easiest category to score in (boldness). Survivors at higher tiers were already maxing put boldness usually just because of their ability to run the killer around
---
1. Because you are mending the wound not healing it, once you mend you dont go back to full health state you stay in the injured state.
---
2. Mending takes about 15 seconds (dont remeber correctly) the dont need to mend if theyre in your terror radius, they can mend themselves.
---
3. It doesnt
---
4. The fury only injures them, you cant down anyone with Legion's power, if you're saying that you hit them with the normal swing and they didnt go down maybe they had Meddle of man
---
It wont be turned into a "healing action"
---
Ugh, please no. That game already died a slow and miserable death.
---
I promise this killer is really bad, sorry but 180s or 360s or whatever they’re called is the killer missing
---
Hey! That's me! Make fun of him, you fun of an innocent redditor!
---
Am dumb, didn't look at any of the UI. Didn't even know they started on a mobile port
---
As to be expected. Did you think such a perk that was so powerful upon release was honestly going to stay that way (especially since it fucked over more than half of the killer roster)? Also, the dream state thing should be fixed. Freddy has enough problems as is.
---
I'm not really into sea theme outfit but... Trapper is Trapper🌚👍
---
make it so it’s balanced around the best ranked survivor please. they should’ve been facing a red or purple rank and I’m sure several people can agree
---
Its Ash. Sometime he talk when he joins a lobby too.
---
You can always said up with me and my friends.
---
We don't play to be toxic or are we gods at the game, we just play for fun.
---
Though one of us is a really toxic survior main... We're all decent enough
---
*throws bottle at /u/escaplays
---
I only play killer unless a friend or two wants to play, and i say just nerf her extra blink and blink range addons
---
My wallet suddenly feels much lighter
---
&gt; Then why is he getting a rework?
---
He's not really a lot of fun to play as, or to play against.
---
You can't do anything to awake survivors, so they can cleanse your hex totem, finish off the last gen, or unhook their friend literally right in your face and there's no way to stop them. Additionally, his power isn't very exciting or interesting: You get aura reading at a distance, survivors do stuff slower, and you're invisible to awake survivors. None of that is really stuff that you can do, like setting traps or throwing hatchets or swiping with a chainsaw. It's just passive things that happen to the survivors during the game, with next to no direct feedback to you.
---
Playing against Freddy is also really lame. He's invisible when you're awake, if you go to sleep you're doing everything at half speed. It's boring.
---
That's essentially what he's doing, except with a new match instead of game. He doesn't like, he doesn't play. Your words not mine.
---
XD wow that's amazing.
---
&gt; since being forced to get woken up every 60 seconds would be extremely annoying and would slow the game down a whole lot
---
Pretty much, yeah. Freddy's a stall killer, the whole point of him is to slow the game tf down.
---
True. Had a friend I was playing swf with not notice the shimmer on the 3rd side of the gen. I booked it like a mofo, he started to bitch and I just heard the dinging and him screaming fuck
---
Better fail a self healing or generator skill check, it’ll definitely help you out.
---
Lol, this is a great meme, and well used in this case. I can hear my friends yelling at me through the picture
---
I’m sure someone may be nice enough. 
---
But really?
---
Ask your parents man.
---
Big ol oof
---
I've posted this before, but:
---
Don't do gens for the first seconds after you spawn. Be aware of who the killer could be, look for clues (traps for trapper, the Nurse's screeching sound, Meyer's music). When you start a gen, swivel your camera to look for a stealthy killer coming your way (The Pig and Ghostface can crouch with no heartbeat). Get good at good skill checks. If a fellow survivor is being chased, good. If not, worry about where the killer is. 
---
Chases are the hardest part of DBD. Look for pallets and windows (if you can get the survivor Kate Denson's perk Windows of Opportunity, it highlights those for you). Use Nea's perk Balanced Landing or Meg's Spring Burst to get away.
---
Altruism is situational. Don't put yourself in danger, especially as a new player, to unhook someone immediately or take the chase for them. Be aware of where the killer is before you go help. 
---
However, if a survivor is downed and the killer leaves them to chase someone else, I ALWAYS try to get them back up. It may save them from being hooked, which can be a gamechanger. More survivors alive means better chance at escape!
---
Anyway, just some musings from a survivor main. Good luck and have fun!
---
Me no can sentence properly when me angry about BP
---
Oh my god i need it
---
Run Fuming Mix Tape And don’t use your power to hit people.
---
Update: Bought it tonight, already had a toxic player message me. Game is fun however, will continue playing.
---
I never mentioned slugging, I said Prayer Bead's Bracelet and the Leave Match button. Those don't spell slugging no matter how to slice it, but you do you I suppose.
---
Was having double pallets at every loop a killer design?
---
Was having no bloodlust on game release a killer design?
---
What about taking a fuckload of time to set Hag traps or Beartraps a killer design?
---
What about having SUPER obvious hex totem locations? Was that a killer sided design?
---
What about infinite window loops or original DS? Surely those were designed to be killer sided.
---
Mettle of Man? Was that overpowered for killers?
---
What about not being able to damage gens on  game release? That's definitely an op killer mechanic. 
---
What about permanent hook sabotage? 
---
What about a 20 second cooldown on Exhaustion perks? That recovered while running? That only disabled one Exhaustion perk at a time? Those must've all been killer buffs.
---
I don't know what rock you've been hiding under to believe that the game is killer sided. But please bash your head in with that rock ASAP. 
---
And yes, killers may complain a lot. Because fuckers like you abused what was strong and then teabagged like you were hot shit. Killers complained because the game was, and still is, survivor sided. Less so for sure, but it's taken a long damn time to get that way.
---
*“Don’t win”*
---
Just PayPal me $20 and I got you fam.
---
If you're still on the map, you're a camper.
---
We aren’t talking about the whole game, we are talking about the time you spend in a locker, what if the other person is looping around it. How much time does that waste? What about how one of your teammates is being occupied by attempting to loop the killer while the other two are attempting to get gems done, rather than the other three. This could cripple them and in turn cost you the game.
---
I would search for Fungoose's "Shrine of Secrets" videos on YouTube, he posts an in-depth analysis every week on what perks are best and in what situations, and he's a god DBD streamer.

Killers complain a lot too.

That makes me question the Blue Dress and Green Dress add-ons now. The Blue Dress, the green add-on, has it's effect at "slightly", the same as the Green Dress add-on (the yellow one). Add-ons should get progressively stronger the rarer they are (and not by one measely second as it is now between those two add-ons on the photo).
---
Sorry to hear man. But I still stand behind what I said.
---
Been playing for a while and still don't know the shack loop yet, truck loops are my strong suit.
---
I'd blur their username. It's one of the rules.
---
Yeah I’m taking down the post tomorrow morning
---
should've captioned the bottom: DARN RIGHT
---
I'm pretty kind most of the time. The only time I ever went out for blood was when it was obvious these two SWF deranked to get a low rank killer, they T-bagged me once and they immediately DC'd when I knocked them down.
---
Wow he’s fun
---
Why didnt you take a picture of everyone
---
If you know how to loop you won't know what dream pallets are real or fake and traps aren't always avoidable.
---
People like you don't get the point of the fucking Teleport, it's meant for pressure not killing.
---
Is Survelliance good on a Leatherface, Pig, Ghost, or Freddy? Those are the ones I usually use
---
I got 169 so far (:
---
I will! Thank you!
---
I agree
---
I normally respond with the biggest comeback ever “k”
---
Point for wiggling and medkit healing both sound like possible survival scoring events, ontop of them getting survival points based off of how long they survive in a match.
---
Honestly no one has a clue why it just is
---

Thanks!

I had a game once where a 3 man left me behind because I was doing gens against an insidious camping Leatherface. They had a key and didn't tell me  then left me behind even if I did 3 gens on my own
---
Rank 6-8 in Canada on console and there are loads of trash killers who will DC if all 5 gens are done and the survivors are looking like they're all going to get out. It's sort of a take my toys and go home.
---
Just shut up you shitty ass player. Your just bad.
---
His rework he can't see you anymore he doesn't have a pull, and it suewht have slow down. Man your just stupid.
---
I respect your balanced and postponed opinion. Kudos mate.
---
Lol all I say is GG and after that he says “EZ” like he won or something
---
'The Ghost Face' has a ghost face.
---

---
You are very angry over an opinion lol
---
Hybridpanda does a shrine watch video every week as well. He gives an honest opinion on what perks to pick up or if they are garbage. He's mostly a killer main but will play survivor as well. He's honestly the reason I started playing the game. I'm a survivor main but nonl where near his level.

bleed out timer too op pls nerf
---
That’s fine and dandy, but in the meantime all they’ve really done is nerf survivor scoring events. They’ve been saying for like 2 years that there’d be a Freddy rework and we just got it, not to mention the dedicated servers they promised we’d have by last December. Granted, those are more developmentally intensive than changing some scoring events, but I just don’t see them doing it anytime soon
---
Is someone wearing a bandana around there mouth?
---
Get perks for characters you dont have
---
Cool idea! Fake pallets could have a different color aura than real ones.
---
It would work quite well on Ghostface and less so on Pig.  Any stealth killer or a high mobility killer would benefit from it
---
I was actually thinking this too. And it would be a nice, small buff to another borderline useless perk. Hard agree!
---
Survivors will literally use any excuse to victimize themselves. It's like anything the killer does that actually helps them win is either "tunneling" or "camping"
---

---

---
Awesome job man!
---
When the killer swings and you dead hard into a tree but he still misses:
---
Oh fair enough, i did mention if they fixed the collision on the environment it wouldn't be as bad, but i guess all the problem was just in the hatchets. I didn't think it through as much as i could have. thanks for the info \^\^
---
Haha good to know! I'm new and pretty good with Freddy and Trapper so far. Myers is possibly my favorite slasher so this is hype
---
I dunno I feel like that'd make the fake pallets completely worthless
---
To be fair, both sides say a lot of absolutely idiotic shit that's just basically, "What the fuck? I'm just playing the game?"
---
You bait out dead hard, supposedly your a pussy. But I've had many killers say if I pallet loop and/or gen rush, I'm a pussy.
---
There's just no winning in this community.
---
How about making him able to switch weapons around the map like he did in the movie
---
Yeah I’m playing on PS4. And that’s what I do or I usually just send happy thoughts their way.
---
True I haven't been scared in like 700 hours but these new doc sounds when I heard them made me jump like crazy
---
That’s a dumbass comment lol but to be fair to them they weren’t necessarily saying it was a rule they were stating their dumbass wrong opinion lol
---
Dream Snares...?
---
Oh those are for Killers. All of Killer offerings are personal besides BPS and Gruesom Gateau.
---
All dressed in black, his heart so heavy, a love attack, a damp cigarette in the rainnnn
---
Works on both sides tbh had a hag once threaten to “Lynch me like the n word I am” all because I escaped hell he didn’t even see me the entire match so I wasn’t being toxic I don’t get why people take this shit so seriously
---
I disagree, because if i slug for like 2 seconds then they weren't getting away anyways, if i did it long enough for them to get themselves back up, then their teammates should have gotten them. Dying state is supposed to be an opportunity to be saved, not to save yourself. aka when you've been hit 2 times, you're supposed to be punished hard unless the killer fucks up, like if they slug you and leave you out to be saved too long.  
---
As survivor it's pretty easy to combat slugging anyways. split apart and don't go for dumb saves. I say this as somebody who has played much more survivor than killer too
---
I usually down the unhooked survivor but don’t hook them, it’s good for wasting survivors time.
---
I don’t think he’s Hitler level chief
---
It doesn’t even matter what rank you are half the time 
---
Killer, swf or no swf  the matchups are pretty inconsistent
---
I highly doubt everyone would use it. Itd still be super specialized. By that logic calm spirit makes doctors power worthless and it should be nerfed.
---
I see the devs have done exactly nothing about how it looks like someone dropped ten thousand fog machines in the dreamworld and just left them there.
---
Sorry for taking so long to respond. Due to spirits mobility, you can generally find those you injured fairly quickly. Survivors will almost always heal in a corner if they suspect you have it
---
?
---
Damn did you run into the hag I played against a while back? He loved using the n word as insult
---
I think its just a shortening of PogChamp which is a twitch emote

&gt;make for some cool counter play
---
More like uncounterable counterplay. A perk shouldn't literally make a whole part of a killer's power null and void.
---
Bill is such a badass tho
---
Yes. You can see it coming 36 meters away which is still 1.5 times her terror radius of 24 meters.

The dream snare looks like a Tainted Coil spawn. Which is kinda cool.
---
Time to start the petition. Get them to change it before the official Freddy rework hits.
---
The Nurse was a Nurse
---
Why tho Laurie is a horror icon
---
See the problem with this is that only the hatch escape is being buffed for the survival category. And honestly, escaping out the hatch is currently considered an objective category. So unless they change that, it’s not even buffing survival. Everything is boldness, objective, and altruism. 
---
I mean cool, but usually you only get 5k survival points as is. There is absolutely NO reason to nerf that category further.
---
I mean, I dont play pig, but 'last will' essentially doubles your RBTs, but idk

---
Still gonna call BS on that. Feel like proving it?

Why is this a sub lol
---
I mean he’s right. Surviving as survivor is an expectation not an achievement.
---
Doctor can do it too. It's really not that bad imo.
---
Probably insecure fucks who need to feel good by mocking others in a videogame to compensate for something... That or just your good ol' 12 YO hell spawns from ~~COD~~ Fortnite. In any case, don't let them bother you; I know ya did well and you'll eventually find some wholesome people to play with.
---
Can someone explain what's happening?
---
If you get down to 2 survivors and there's more than 1 gen it's over for them lol
---
Remember guys, unhook your friends before they die.
---
It makes getting vomited on the face a whole lot worse remembering he can’t close his mouth.
---
The shirt is a custom mesh created by me, the tattoos were custom done by me, and the bracelet on the tattooed arm is a combined sims 4 mesh recoloured red. She also has her crescent chest tattoo but its partially hidden by her hair and shirt.

That's Snorp!

LMAO THATS FUNNY

This comment section is such a circlejerk lol

Isn't this: taking the in game hostage?

Get enough survivors like that and you'll start to love camping

---
Explain how it's a buff where you get exhausted even on a fail for an already really situational perk.
---
I play 50/50 and definetly find it a good way to not get burnt out or constantly salty over shit
---
If that bitch is toxic to me I'm being toxic right back

Console Nurses get mad respect from me.
---
For those who haven't checked patch notes, Head On hitbox got buffed to where the perk should work reliably.  It's not to the extent where the perk needs a nerf, but honestly this is such a minor nerf I doubt it'll affect gameplay.
---
What about object of obsession on GhostFace? Or small game on trapper and Hag? Or even call spirit on doctor? So your point was . . . ?
---
Most people on this subreddit play killer, but I believe survivors make up the majority of the player base.
---
So how's rank 20 killer then? Since you clearly haven't gotten better than that
---
Dwight players are terrified of everything and hide in lockers.

Meg players take 3 exhaustion perks and sprint burst away as soon as they hear a heartbeat.

The numbers suck so it barely makes a difference, but Legion desperately needs for survivors to have some penalty for being injured even if it’s miniscule. So even though the perk sucks its usually important for Legion to run.
---
No swing chains?
---
If you're playing pig already just unlock it by leveling her up. Waste of shards if you play her regularly
---
A lot of people who play survivor feel entitled to survive and when you get in their way they get upset and send hate mail.
---
They're also recoloring some debris and boxes around the map later on in the year, More hits towards a Stranger Things Hawkins map?
---
when all the other survivors dc or the killer is afk I can't heal anyone
---
People are always gonna be salty when they lose. 
---
I remember one game i had i was playing wraith, and a SWF group all had toolboxes set up for sabo. ( I checked after the game. all were set to sabo quickly.) so when i picked up the first survivor i downed. All i hear was three hooks being broken. So what did i do? I slugged him. Of course because it was a SWF they were super altruistic, and they all died because of it. 
---
After the game they all complained, stated that i was a camper, and a crappy player because i slugged them. I said that it was a counter to them and their sabo build. They got all butt hurt. Tried to say that it wasn't a sabo build, and that i was just toxic. I recorded the match, when i watched it, it was indeed sabo. I laughed at them, said gg, and left. Some people are beyond reason.
---
Weird first time I ever heard that you can get banned in a ptb as it’s meant to test shit
---
Use that spicy black ward so you keep the addons ;)
---
from my knowledge the ones that talk about acceleration don't do crap, I don't main him cuz he's kinda ass (ps. this is just what I heard)
---
If you like being toxic spirit takes the cake.

No I'm angry you didn't even bother to do any research before complaining
---
So heads up to all those head on users. And killers alike, apparently the perk works when exiting/entering/even when exhausted. Hopefully this gets fixed?
---
Yeah but it's still an entire killer ability countered by one perk. (even with drawbacks)
---
the entity has found out that putting you in debt will make you play more games to pay it off, congrats
---
I remember it happening when Ghostface was still in the PTB, he had a community post showing that he got banned for "exploiting" and several people pointed out he was in the PTB, so he shouldn't of gotten banned because he was just showing that the multiple killer glitch was still a thing.
---
He did it in a SWF group too, so he wasn't hurting anyone by doing it, just confusing the guy who was suppose to be killer.
---
It’s acceptable if the killer BM you
---
This is perfect
---
And if I'm reading it correctly you can still slow-exit the locker to not activate it right? So it only uses Exhaustion if you deliberately activate the perk. It's not like you're automatically exhausted every time you spend 3+ seconds in a locker.
---
I didn’t have time to look over the rework so I came here to ask if he was getting nerfed in the rework that’s literally the first thing I ask lol and imo his power is definitely getting nerfed his pull range and his regression is going to be gone which I’m completely okay with again stay angry over my opinion in a video game lol
---
Pig's stun is the worst *noise* in the entire game out of all the noises a killer can make except for Wraith's stun, and a few of the particularly high-pitched survivor hook-screams; and this is true for all of Pig's SFX.
---
Also yes Pig players are usually douchebags (spam Mori canceling, teabagging over you for four minutes while you bleed out, facecamping more often than Leatherface and Ghostface combined)...
---
I’ a rank 18 killer and want to rank up efficiently any tips?
---
&gt; Can they not wake up at all?
---
They can wake up just a little bit
---
I don’t see how Meg is at fault.
---
Ya that’s sad the devs banned him for that looks like he’s back though. I laughed so hard at the ghost face video
---
Not been playing killer for long and I do this majority of the time. Playing from survivor main to killer yep.
---
https://youtu.be/FXPkDb5n4bU this video might help you
---
Lmao -- I'm good, bud.
---
Your right i did blank on the gen teleport cd out of the 3 u mentioned that is the only useful one.
---
Regardless it means fuck all they will all be slept in 60 seconds its not worth a ultra rare not even a little bit and again they don't wake up even with the action speed addons its not worth it.
---
Lol. Thanks.
---
He was riding your ass longer than a cowboy on a mule
---
LMAO 
---
That's so beautiful
---
That has to be a bug. Please tell me that's a bug.
---
You don’t unhook a survivor when you’re in a chase unless you’ve got borrowed time or are willing and able to take a hit. It’s 100% meg’s fault
---
Quick question how did you do that?
---
Suggestion to the devs:  Turn off (or give ability to opt out of) post game chat.  There's literally no reason to have it except to either GGWP, talk shit, or maybe talk with another survivor about hooking up in SWF.
---
So you complained about getting slugged. You just gonna continue with the semantics here, or..?
---
So this MUST be a bug. I was playing with Head On like usual, when all of the sudden THIS happened. Hopefully they fix it!
---
Frank Reynolds as a Survivor when?
---
Regardless, something was complained about
---
Thanks peeps!
---
he stood in front of me and spam crouched, I think he wanted it to end too.
---
I feel ya Quentin is my main and id take anything on him.
---
In the end hes  like “fuck this shit Im out” and leaves lol
---
Yes. Their own mistakes were complained about, not the things other players did. So your whole argument about them complaining is debunked
---
It's like. . . If I were to disagree then I'm saying that I'm not entitled to an opinion, but if I agree then I'm acknowledging my opinion is wrong.
---
Removed for party thread please post /r/dbdLFG
---
Replacing snares with pallets at a common rarity seems weird. Most times if a add-on completely changes how a power works, it's higher rarity like Hag's body blocker add-ons or Myers' 2 mirrors
---
I don’t understand the issue with hitting the person that just got unhooked one they’re already hurt and I can down them and two if your getting unhooked in front of me by some asshat without BT that’s not my problem
---
I’ve been watching a Killer main play him and it almost feels like the dream snares are incredible, you literally cannot loop him because he can place the traps mid chase and the slow lasts fairly long.
---
complaining about other people slugging them when they aren't running unbreakable sounds like a problem with something that's in the game to me.
---
I'm pretty sure nobody wakes up on hook anymore. It's failed skill checks, other survivors (although I think sleepers can wake each other up maybe?), and alarm clocks.
---
Though I do feel like Windows should get a buff I don't believe it should be this. This would also hurt Doctor which in his current stage isn't really powerful and isn't in need of a nerf. I don't think this should be the way Windows of Opportunity should get buffed.
---
I mean, it opens up different playstyles akin to Doc and his illusionary add-ons.
---
Otherwise Freddy might end up a little too powerful if he can shut down AND trap loops on top of his gen teleport.
---
Their perk and add on balance is a little wack, but I honestly feel like they’ve done a great job with a majority of the killers.
---
someone post the old feng description
---
Onion head ass
---
The problem is in the game but isnt a fault in the game’s mechanics. Thats the survivors faults.
---
Prayer Beads is something only the devs can fix. Do you see the difference?
---
People are still going to call freddy trash
---
Of course it is. They noticed the bug where you are exhausted no matter what on fast exiting the vault and called it a feature. I think this is further proof of that theory, lol.

I’m sure people will complain but it’s not much different than when Trapper traps a pallet, you’re screwed if you try to use it when you need it but you can throw it when not in a chase if you know it’s fake. It’s honestly going to be a fun game of memory for me :p
---
Not really. The problem wasnt complaining about something the devs can fix or not, it was about complaining about something that's in the game which therefore makes it fair no matter what.
---
I been using the nurse on ps4 .......
---
At least at the end when they're teabagging me at the gate, they let me practice my blinks. 
---
Hey I hooked 1 person 1 time, but yes let's tbag.
---
no
---
in a way, end game collapse did more for the game than several other chapters/ new meta perks have ever done
---
You can still complain about a shitty idea. This in no way benefits survivors enough for the nerf to points when killers already make almost 2x the points tunneling one survivor. 
---
Source: Am survivor main.
---
That sounds an awful lot like someone I know...
---
Then again, a big chunk of the playerbase seems to agree with this statement.
---
The Pig. She's the best imo and the reverse bear traps are a lot of fun and also when you put  them on a survivor or two you don't have to worry too much about gens because they most likely will be running around trying to get them off instead.
---
The Barnacle Bastard
---
With the implementation of dedicated servers, I hope they will make it so that the post-game chat won't be disabled when the killers leaves. This isn't really a question. Just felt like saying that.
---
Reminds me of the Doc’s release. “We want stealth gameplay to be viable” “Also here’s a killer who ignores that.”
---
When Myers stalks you for a while then Tier 3 music plays... ahh fuck, I can’t believe you’ve done this
---
I feel like if you try to win, you’re a pussy
---
Wow you did it, since some of the trophies are hard like the nurse 3 blink grab and etc and I was so thankful when I completed that trophy and got the platinum I let everyone escape because how happy I was :)
---
Yes!!! that whole scene is exactly what it is like trying to please this community.
---
Watching him will give you a killer victim complex, he's in a really toxic region where survivors are a lot more aggressive, not to mention he has fed a culture of stream snipers by reacting to them.
---
I would humbly suggest Hybrid Panda or Otzdarva. Both are really smart and have an understanding of both sides
---
Can we all agree to crouch spin at exit gates as a gg?
---
If he’s your nightmare does he kill himself? Are we the bad guys?
---
I'm mostly responding to your first paragraph, to give an example of why people may do that for reasons that aren't completely toxic. There's some survivors, especially new ones, who run into a locker the second they hear a heartbeat. This isn't always a bad move, but the issue comes in when some survivors basically live in the locker all game. Maybe it's from fear, maybe they want to camp the locker until the last survivor dies so they can get the hatch. It can be very frustrating to see be hooked and see a survivor who hasn't done shit finally leave a locker and creep towards the hatch. So it's possible they have experienced that before and are assuming that's what you'll be doing, so showing the killer your hiding spot is the only way they can combat that.
---
Now, from the sounds of it that's not what you're doing, and either way it isn't fair of them to assume that's what you're doing so quickly. So I'm not defending this behavior, I'm just trying to give another perspective on why they may be doing it that doesn't come from a purely 'fuck you other survivor' mindset.
---
That's why you always run No Mither.
---
GET. REKT. SCRUBYERS!
---
I just lost IQ points
---
As killer I love it when people drop the pallette before 3 gens are done, it's magestic, especially if the basement is in the shack 😂
---
Should make the houses less mindless. They already added new footstep sounds to some of the carpeted areas inside some houses so there's atleast some mindgame potential
---
only on the snow, and it doesnt need the offering, he can still place traps at the big house but, its broken that map for freddy
---
This is a lie and theres videos showing it takes longer than usual to recover. Thankfully a dev said it should be fixed with this upcoming mid chapter patch.
---
Yikes dude
---
It's also completely irrelevant to the conversation at hand. Seems weird to look through someone's post history to bring up something they said in a different thread, but that's just me.
---
As a killer main, this make me wanna go on a murdering spree in Sims 4.
---
today i got a swf that used that offering, i got a 4k because they sucked but the guy that used the offering is already resported on the support and hopefully banned
---
I know some people might flame me for the ttv or the 4man swf as rank 5. Im not getting boosted, idc bout my rank, im just trying to get irl friends into a game we can all enjoy. 
---
Ignore the ttv, its not about that, its about the bs matchmaking... were talking (4+13+15+14)/4 = 11.5; 18-11.5 is a 6.5 average rank differential which is unacceptable imo.
---
Ok im new and people keep on saying swf what does it mean?
---
Australians will wonder how you look when you hit a great skillcheck instead of how you feel
---
I know
---
STOP BULLYING HIM!
---
The pallet itself is too bright to see anything.
---
Both survivor perks are OK
---
Surveillance is always a yes, but overshadowed by some others that are slightly better. 
---
Never been a fan of thana.
---
I would recommend adding in discordance (mainly cause I’m a legion main) but if you stalk multiple people while on the generator you can make the most out of your power
---
And? Those just take out perks and you're not looking right at someone the entire time.
---

And? Those just take out perks and you're not looking right at someone the entire time. 
---
Making WoO do this would literally prevent Freddy from using one of his two powers for the entire game. End of story.
---
You're using a cheap shortcut that you don't have to use to have a good game, that is the definition of being bad at the game.
---
Do encourage survivors to go into SWF comm groups and plan to genrush? If not then you're a hypocrite.
---
Why does the picture for *Quick and Quiet* look like Meg trying to be iDubbbz?
---
Making WoO do this would literally prevent Freddy from using one of his two powers for the entire game. End of story. The other perks do not completely take away a killer's power for the entire game.
---
They're compensating with more for cleansing totems
---
Don’t even try telling me ghostface was nerfed that hard. He’s still very good
---
Haemorrhage, and it increases the frequency of your bleeding. Can be caused by the perk Sloppy Butcher as well as numerous add-ons,
---
“Genrush” isn’t real, it’s just survivors doing their objective lmao
---
And “cheap shortcut that makes you bad at the game” is a laughable thing to call it. It’s literally just the killer doing their objective, sorry it doesn’t mean your standards.
---
This for the killer as well. I know how shitty it is to be working my way up the ranks as killer, be in the yellow ranks, and then get slammed with green, purple, and red rank survivors. That shit is so far away from being fair it's not funny.
---
Why are you downvoted for the truth? This community mad wild.
---
Started last night, I got a decent amount (10-15 I think)
---
idk might have sounded gamergate tier to people or some shit
---
Yeah thats for sure a bug. Are you logged into the right account? Just to make sure.
---
I can see they're trying to put less emphasis on *you need to escape to win*, and more on *perform well during the match to win*
---
They compensated the fewer escape points with more points for cleansing totems, and I'm guessing they could be doing more
---
Yea I knew how to play nurse when I was unlocking every teachable in the game but still it was a good day for me
---
Tenacity level 100.
---
You're arguing for the wrong thing. Nobody is saying the easier use is a nerf, we're saying exhaustion no matter what for a situational perk is a nerf, which it is.
---
I don’t think Freddy was that bad. He was greatly lacking, sure, but people were always too harsh on the poor little guy.
---
That makes sense, now that you mention it
---
I think the highest rank person should be the one hosting because atm I think that affects it, as well I think you should maybe be playing a little easy when you're queued with much lower rank players. Not a requirement but it's polite.
---
I tried to do that once in a game where they were baby rank 20s with only one gen done and the lone Feng wiggled off from right next to the hatch and ran away in the other direction TWICE, I was so confused lol
---
The third time I just hooked her because I don't have that much patience lol
---
When you float
---
text colour isnt very good against the background
---
I'm guessing its to take away some of the dependence on escaping so more survivors will be willing to extend the match
---
**Ash, what are you doing to that Pikachu?**
---
Those idiots are giving the rest of my people a bad rep.
---
I realize that now
---
I got well over 200 downvotes the other day for making a joke about promoting my twitch stream. People in here are weird.
---
I (the red rank) was hosting. I definitely wasn't playing at my best, I actually was trying to get him to kill me at the end and he refused lol
---
Also as killer...like ummmmm killing survivors....is like ummm also against the rules.
---
Selective bias. if it's not the killers complaining about killers being victims, survivors are complaining about everything else
---
In our culture, we consider this a dick move.
---
But if it’s easier to hit, does the exhaustion part really matter? If you are hitting it consistently then why does it matter if you’d get it anyways. Once again the killer will smack you anyways if you miss, and if you plan to use this perk you wouldn’t be running other exhaustion perks (most likely). You could argue that if you use Dead Hard incorrectly you get exausted and then it becomes just as useless. So does that exhaustion change really matter that much?
---
The Demogorgon
---
Yea forgot to address that but i still think it's weird
---
(Femur breaking intensifies)
---
That weird demogorgon monster thing is my assumption
---
I usually use the tbag as a way to say “thanks”, whether in a sarcastic way or a genuine way is up to the killer to decide.
---
It’s weird but legal so...
---
Enjoy Head On before it’s get a huge nerf I’d say lolz
---
I turned off messages from everyone &lt;ps4&gt; because salty survivors would message me after matches either saying I'm bad cause I 4kd with a perk they dont like or the survivors wrecked me. Happens from time to time in like for honor or maybe siege but it was basically every other match... why survivors so excitable?
---
Me looking down at people that get needlessly mad at people that say shirtless David or shirtless Myers
---
Great perk idea but I don’t think any perk should be just a better version of another perk, they would have to rework territorial imperative, amazing post though!
---
Demigorgon. Though I have no fucking clue what it would be able to do honestly, maybe some kind of Freddy’s power but buffed, kinda like they did with Ghostface and Myers? Who knows.
---
We are getting some fucking quality memes today
---
I play on PS4 and actually had a dude send me voice messages about how sweaty I was for waiting out his dead hard everytime. Apparently we're supposed to play stupid?
---
It is possible for the killer to injure survivors faster than they can heal, if they can keep pressure up while multiple people are injured. An injured person can't really save a slug/ safely unhook anyone without just trading off.
---
Of course it IS possible for survivors to just avoid being slugged like you say, but only by making sure they don't give the killer enough momentum, but that means they have to play more immersed while they heal up, even though that means generators are not going to be getting worked on very much. not working on the objective gives the killer even more time to gain momentum until survivors start getting sacrificed
---
The teleportation is not long enough to get a safe distance away without running meaning he is almost guaranteed to find you when he teleports.
---
Not a very good joke.

Ah, you saw that video, I see you're a man of culture as well

Same. Basically playing every other game as a no mither out here.

The SovietWomble one
---
C’mon, we all love Ghostface. He’s fun to play, fun to play against, is super spooky, and has some interesting perks.
---
oh my God 😂😂😂
---
I'm pretty sure those red ranks are just as good as green ranks if they play solo instead of SWF.
---
Indeed, my friend.
---
they were all SWF tho. I could tell because of how confident and coordinated they were
---
Literally no idea what you’re going on about. I said in my comment that she was a runner (which is a sport btw❤️) but for some reason you are trying to start something.
---
Agreed, Josh would be too OP.
---
Thanks my guy hopefully I’ll get it during the next Bloodhunt
---
Yea can't really judge people if it's legal unless it's something very very weird and creepy
---
He’s at least B teir now, rework was mostly less time wasted and more gen pressure. Pretty nice, he’s actually usuable
---
lol that makes sense, the side with more players and gets to benefit from EZMOAD SWFs and coms should earn nearly as much as the dude who has to play his fucking ass off to even get a kill.
---
Salty, yet satisfying.
---
Thank you
---
Which they aren't
---
It was in the shrine two months ago
---
Good, fuck em.
---
Let em be rank 20
---
or you need to harden the fuck up and stop being so fragile over what some anonymous stranger online has to say
---
Its you guys fault. Such a large rank difference. You are not allowed to complain about rank differences if you’re doing swf with people 10 ranks below you
---
&gt;why can't some people just say gg and be done with it. :(
---
why do you have to be concerned about what some stranger you'll never meet or likely play against again have to say?
---
It's the [Dance of the Survivors](https://youtu.be/2xyHUJxzsTQ)
---
Respek our culture!!
---
I'm not complaining about my gameplay experience, I'm complaining about the killers. Read my comment.
---
No that's not true
---
I hooked a guy, hooked his friend, first guy got downed, DS activated
---
Explain how chasing an entire other guy is tunneling 
---
Until you had four adrenalines pop while the dedicated 'runner' is baiting you away from the gens for the 5 seconds three people need to finish a gen  then you can't say shit about how balanced the game is
---
My guess is that it wasn't funny.
---
Am I missing something?
---
The only problem with that is No Mither is good for different killers and playstyles. Not all players play Michael, or use NOED, etc.
---
Lol was expected.
---
Follow-up questions: If you deplete your brought item in a KYF match, is it gone for good like in regular lobbies?
---
If you find an item in a KYF match and escape, do you get to keep it?
---
I feel like the teleport and snare will get nerfed.
---
Thanks for the enlightenment and good vibes
---
It's obviously a bug, it's gonna be gone when it goes live.
---
DS has a 60 second timer after being unhooked, means you downed the downed the guy who just got unhooked. There is no other way to trigger DS.
---
Oh i get it, BHVR is making most of his addons shit as joke and will change it later, right?
---
RIGHT?!
---
If you play the game and not let others win, you're a pussy lol
---
Nah, I've noticed something. Just a dumb theory, but it's happen enough times for it to just be coincidence. They designate one guy to disconnect when they know they aren't going to win.  I have another account I practice Nurse and Huntress with, it's rank 8 right now, but when I was in green, I'd play several different SWF, I'd be destroying them, and one would always disconnect. It wasn't my connection, I know that for sure. I noticed that everyone who stayed in the game were either purple or red ranks. Excuse was always "one of our teammates disconnected, wasn't fair".
---
If a game only lasts 10 minutes that means he's safe for 10% of the game
---
It should be turned off after you hook another player
---
I play both relatively equally.  I enjoy killer much more, but survivor is my go-to if I just wanna listen to a podcast and relax, or of course to play with friends (though we often get enough together for a Kill Your Friends session).
---
You're good was mainly memeing as first didn't expect an actual conversation
---
I made this really quickly so sorry for the potato quality
---
Thats messed up. How's that funny?
---
I fucking love panda. Dude’s literally put his life into this game.
---
If the killer was proxy camper or tunneller then I will teabag.  If you're going to grieve another player by making their experience as miserable/non-existent as possible then you deserve it.
---
Ugh you're being such a cunt about this. What can I do to prove it to you? I feel like nothing I do will make you happy.
---
In KYF, nothing carries over. You get no bloodpoints. You can't deplete/get items. You get every perk and item in the game to choose from while selecting your character.
---
Bruh where would the challenge be then? I like having tough games and survivors that thibk outside the box, it's way more satisfying to work for the kills and you get better that way 👌
---
Really? Damn, I started playing not far from that time.
---
Some people pair it with other exhaustion perks, others might still miss it due to ping and may want to give it another shot injured or no. It was an unnecessary change to counterbalance the new stun window that brought the perk to a usable status
---
that’s what I figured. they consistently queue together but have this guy dc/throw to keep him at a bad rank and get everyone else to 1 easily. but I really do think that they should be centered at a red/purple rank, because their average rank is 6.5
---
🤡
---
You cant say that anymore after they’ve made it harder to rank up
---
I took it negatively because the Claudette that was tbagging all game was next to her
---
Fifthed panel, get the hatch yourself!
---
Only time I can accept tunneling is if the survivors team insists on performing unsafe hooks.
---
I don't camp either I patrol a wide area. If they put effort into stealthy unhook they can get quiet a headstart.
---
Here’s why https://youtu.be/AMtRRTvmYpM
---
He’s not safe. The timer keeps going if you slug him. Just don’t pick him up instantly or just go for one of the other 3 ppl in the game. It’s always a mistake to go back to the hook as you’re wasting your time. 
---
If one is hooked, one is saving and you hunt another - that’s 3 people occupied.
---
She was next to the asshole Claudette so I felt like she was being an ass. But either way, I got my points.
---
It was a sarcastic comment following on from your paragraph about her sporty nature to which you got overly offended by which I can only assume was because you lack the facilities to understand blatant sarcasm.
---

I see you wouldn't notice sarcasm even if it'd smack you over the head and hooked up as sacrifice to strange sky spider leg thingy.
---
I would have to disagree. Red ranks CAN be potatoes but it's unlikely at this point. My friends that I play with play just as much as me and they rarely crack the purple ranks. Skill is highly important and playing Ghost Face at high rank gets sweaty 7/10 games. He's a solid killer but he'll get looped and gen-rushed into oblivion like half the roster.
---
Oh boy I cannot wait for what these people will do once proper DC punishments are doled out. Oh what will P3 Purple Flashlight Claudette do!?
---
True, but for now, you just have to deal with it. Use it as a chance to better yourself as a killer. I mean, I rank 1 every time. It's nothing but SWF in red ranks and I rarely lose. Whenever I go up against a well coordinated team and get massacred I honestly hope I could play them again so I could figure them out. Honestly, most SWF are pretty predicable and the main reason I win so often is because they're doing things I've seen literally hundreds of times.
---
0 kills is a loss, 1 hook &amp; several non-death hooks is a tie, 2-3 kills is what you should be aiming for (preferably not killing those people with 3 or more generators left), and 4 people is Being Greedy/ Domination, depending on how well the survivors played. 
---
Bad survivors = Greed, Good survivors = domination.
---
The snare is already so weak. It's a slightly worse clown gas
---
is your sound on?
---
Yeah, you can tell sometimes if their bar in the lobby flicks from red to green a lot. Otherwise there's not much you can do apart from report them after.
---
Was still just messing around
---
I wish have this perk in stable version coz it looks so fun.
---
not be able to queue for weeks on end, thank god. unfortunately, they’ll still be able to just have the one guy sit in a locker the entire time and still escape
---
If you randomly find the same guy again and aren’t sure whether he is still on the timer, let him there for a few seconds. Someone will have to pick him up so you waste another guy’s time as well.
---
I agree there should be a very distinct notice or even have the perk being cleansed turn red on your HUD so you know they're touching one of your totems.
---
If you think it's bad as whoever you're playing, try Impossible SkillCheck Doc with gens and screams going off every 5 seconds. You'll NEVER realize your totems are being worked on with all the visual and audio feedback going on.
---
IMO this whole game is killer sided, i say there needs to be a balance patch to add a cooldown period after downing a survivor where the killer cant pick  them up.
---
you can technically easily identify and separate mobile x pc/ mulator players, including even Identity V and PUBG do it.
---
yeah, I usually just struggle because of how there’s always one person so close so sneakily. I don’t have the best headset or gamesense, and there’s always the one person with the flashlight somehow waiting in the wings for me to pick up their friend
---

---
Don't let it get to you, you can close the chat box if you want aswell

I hit 32k and only got one pip
---
Rank 1 isn't hard, The game is balanced for rank 10
---
Agreed. The one thing I hate though is when people say "the counter to ds is to just not tunnel" which I agree with to a certain degree, but there are times where you'll get dsed even if you don't tunnel.
---
LMAO You teach that fucking scum survivor!!!!!!!!!  I love this!!!!
---
are you okay
---
Ya and look I got 7 downvoted for saying I’m a rank 4 I was just saying that I understand  that it’s not just the press of a button  🤦‍♂️
---
Because it doesn’t mean a damn thing. It’s just playing the game, it may sounds like a dumb explanation but that’s really all there is to it. 
---
Ofc you can get there faster the better you are but every average player will get there eventually. 
---
The only bothersome thing about red ranks for me are the queue times. Not so much as survivor but very much as killer.
---
I don't understand, what's the joke?
---
I think that's a you problem. I was just playing pig 20 minutes ago when I was crouch I didn't hear any foots steps. And I was hearing survivors breath and grunt from pain and was able to locate them immediately based on the direction I heard the sound from. So I don't know whats wrong on your end but everything is working just fin over *hear*.
---
Yah I agree it was just a suggestion because he’s smart ,knows good builds and is good
---
I highly recommend the Hyper X Alpha's. Under $100 and the absolute best I've ever owned. I want another set for my wife. They're amazing... They really do make a huge difference in being able to track people. I could hear people breathing in lockers. It's great.
---
Turn on the sound and listen to the "not enough currency" sound effect. I'm basically just playing the chase theme by clicking the buttons.
---
Sounds fun 😂😂
---
I thought that was Nancy?
---
Okay cool lol because I swear people on here live just by camping and it’s irking me 😂
---
I can tell by the points the survivors earned that you ended the game as fast as you could without taking the time to work for any emblems.
---
you deserved it.
---
I heard it but didn't understand that it was the chase theme, thanks for the clarification
---
It only trips me up sometimes when they do something extremely stupid, and I'm just gloating and picking them up only to get DSd like an **idiot**.
---
Otherwise if I see 1 obsession they can just *squirm* for a while
---
Don’t forget that one of her achievements needs her to have 3 blinks.
---
It is? Either we are playing different games or I just suck.
---
And we both know the answer to this one.
---
Yeah but that's so much blood I can spend on fixing my prestiged piggy and legion. I'M STRUGGLING MAN.
---
I dont think youve played against redranks then chief. If you did then they must have been boosted lvl 20s. Most games the survivors wipe the floor with anyone who isnt a nurse or billy main.
---
Rank 18 killer --  Matched with a Rank 4, Rank 8, Rank 19, and a Rank 20.  
---
Rank 11 Survivor -- SWF with  my rank 15 friend.  Gets another Rank 5 in the lobby, rank 19 killer.
---
Sigh.   Not fun for killers.
---
Woooooow that's like some next tier arseholery like I'm a killer main and I feel that 😭
---
Yes, it should affect all movement.
---
I do not think anyone has the game working on an emulator. maybe the devs are trying to make emulators not work. I guess it does make sense why they would not want ppl playing it on a emulator
---
I'm not saying he's bad at the game, but you could also pick up some bad habits which could turn you into just another toxic player
---
What kind of scrub ass survivors miss a pallet blind lmao
---
I know, I’m a Myers main and I live for those moments where I pop tier 3 and down all 4 survivors.
---
"oh? Go loop around it again"
---
Mate most Redditors are thick as pig shit so if your  comment is -1, it will just spiral out of control because no one thinks for themselves here.
---
Also, try to use "/s" at the end of a sarcastic comment because like I said most Redditors are thick as pig shit and wont understand sarcasm when they see it.
---
hey cool idea, now i wanna create some dbd sims too! nice work
---
OOTL but what does BM abbreviates exactly?
---
A PC gamer who doesn't know how to send someone a link to their achievements?
---
Someone did that to me! It was with huntress i think and i was just like wtf is going on here?? I’m trying to stay alive there’s another locker like 2 feet away just crouch over there!!!
---
I think I own those I believe. but mine are kind of destroyed. gotta love having a little brother, right?
---
Pls no, my voice is so bad
---
I agree. Though I watch him for strategy.
---
I'm pretty sure according to the rest of the patch notes this was a hit box reliability buff since it was so inconsistent before when the killer was walking perpendicularly to your locker and you tried to stun them but correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't played ptb.
---
Ya I literally just died 15 minutes ago right after opening a door and running 3 steps through. Hurts like a bitch and I'll be up all night crying, but that's part of the game. Dumb baby game for babies.
---
Done that before. Got called a camper!
---
Thanks. Don’t know where people’s sense of humor went. I’m new.
---
I’ve been there regularly since unlocking the achievement back in 2016.
---
Maybe I’m just biased af cause I play this game for three years now but I really think once you figure the emblems out it becomes very easy.
---
I'd prefer Hellraiser, but if it had to be ST then definitely a Demogorgon. I'd say the ability to set hag traps on walls and be able to move through them. Like trapper but you can teleport from one trap to another. I think maybe Barb for survivor, or maybe Alexei lol.
---
Well I'm glad you actually get to play whoever you want with no issues. If you own Spirit, I implore to to play her first without Stridor, then with. I used to use Stridor but people were sounding horrendously far away causing me to reappear no where near them and facing the wrong direction. Then I took it off and it's still way too messed up to be able to hit grudges properly.
---
I really don't intend to brag, but I would hit a grudge about 90% of the time, but since the update I'm lucky if I hit 30%. There is absolutely something wrong with the sound and I'm really tired of Spirit in particular being ruined by yet ANOTHER round of sound issues.
---
For real, I don't get people who are afraid to die
---
Also super frustrating cause you can run the killer around for several minutes and there will still only be one gen done tops.
---
Using a gen monitor build, something like pop goes the weasel combos extremely well with it.
---
I use it on my Trapper so I can keep an eye on what gens I need to pay attention to, and relocate my traps to those areas.
---
Fuck that sounds amazing
---
Define camping...
---
Ooooh yes as a trapper main I approve this message. Please give me extra glowy survivors 😍🗡
---
I do it and don't get upset if it happens to me when gens are done, especially if I've gotten zero kills and want to secure one (or one more) because once the gates powered (or even worse, open) the Killer is out of options. You either camp the guy on the hook and maybe secure a kill, or move away, his buddies rescue him and escape. 
---
Camping is an issue if it's done from the start of the match or on peoples first hook. I find that a shitty strategy because other survivors will rush gens in the meantime. For me to do something like that a survivor has had to seriously push my buttons (and I am an extremely patient person so to set me off that bad you really have had to have BM'd me something fierce.) in some way. 
---
Basically doing it at end-game is fine because the killer doesn't have any options left especially if the gates are open. Otherwise it's a poor strategy in the long run but I might decide to camp someone if they went above and beyond to piss me off in some manner to the point I honestly don't care if the other people escape if the shitter dies. (No Mither SaboJake 99ing every goddamn hook and teabagging as he drops hooks as I'm carrying, then runs to the corner of the map to ensure I can't carry him to one in time, resulting in a stalemate because I can't slug him, nor can I carry him to a hook, people who use a flashlight macro as I have hyperacusis and this is genuinely painful for my ears, people who would go to unreachable spots back when those were a thing and teabag, etc.)
---
When I’m playing with friends, I don’t mind skipping SC, but in solo other people are ... unreliable. I’ve had people run AWAY from me because I was hurt, I’ve had people ignore me so they could finish their gen instead. 
---
Or just not find anybody.
---
-85 on the original and -29 on the one where I said it was ironic. Why? 😐
---
You and my friends have said the exact thing and I don't even notice it lol
---
Did you try to stretch the game out so they have a chance to do gens, get some unhooks and healing done and not constantly be bothering them so they have a chance at some points or did you head back to the hook as soon as someone was unhooked?
---
Lmao, and a downvote to boot. You're super toxic. Nevermind, you can legit fuck off, kid.
---
With the current and new Head On you cant really get locker grabs.
---
ya it is a known glitch and is fixed in the ptb I think
---
Bad Manner
---
It's new and I don't mind it at all tbh, once they have a better idea they may change it
---
*yeet*
---
Yeah it makes it sound like OP wants killers to get less bloodpoints when in reality survivors need to get more.
---
I know this is about Freddy, but I'm just wanting Bill tbh. He comes to consoles with the mid-chapter patch, and its exciting for me.
---
Had a Claudette looping the killer for a few good minutes to where we finished up two generators and were halfway done on the third. As soon they got downed for the first time they DC'd. 
---
Or whenever I match up against a Nurse, there is usually one or two DCs as soon as they hear her teleport. I get she's unfun to play with depending on the skill and the map but at least try.
---
this is why I absolutely hate playing survivor some times it's teammates like this
---
Fuck me the attention to detail. Respectable
---
Some just where paint
---
It will happen
---
Thats my exact spirit build lmao
---
Well it doesnt matter what you or i think mate.
---
Enjoying my stay.  It’s making me want to play again, It’s been a while.
---
I immediately farm as killer. It’s like cleansing my pallet after a bunch of shit games.
---
I don’t make it obvious at first but I never hook and do a ton of chasing and slashing and kicking gens. I usually max out every category (except sacrifice obv). We all leave with a bunch of points and everyone is happy.
---
Aww thanks
---
Yeah, I didn’t really think about it as doc. I’m running it on a hillbilly build and complaining about it, so it must be horrible for you.
---
Half these already exist, the other half are just bad. Sorry.
---
Why cant we just use the new rework? Its fine. Why do want to alter it?
---
I did in fact say the n word, "nOo"
---
OoO should probably be adjusted against ghostface, it completely disables his kit against SWF.
---
It would be like small game highlighting all the traps on the map lol
---
The killer doesn't *need* to predict when the survivor will use Dead Hard with any degree of precision. It's wasted as long as the survivor uses it any time besides right when the killer swings
---
I had too!
---
He plays on PS4 like me, so if he got banned for the messages then it would have been trough PS4
---
I wouldn’t say it’s greedy to try and get the 4K it’s the killers job to try and kill all survivors, in the dev view point the game is “balanced” around the killer getting 2 kills per game obviously that doesn’t always happen being greedy is more around the lines the game should be over but your keeping a survivor alive to get more points then killing them but hey agree to disagree
---
When I was rank 16(new to killer/the game in general) I had numerous games of a rank 16 + 1(16 was obviously a skilled player) and SWF lobbies that were toxic queueing with a brand new player.  Absolute hell for a new killer.
---
I'm more understanding of some unpopular survivor opinions than a lot of folks, but this is just plain stupid.
---
As a killer, I love it when people pull the plug in rage. Makes me moist.
---
Yeah, but I split off because I wanted Quentin to take BT aggro so he could get a little speed boost but I messed up regardless lol
---
It’s exactly that tbh
---
Lmao why did I get downvoted tho
---
I wish that were the case but it wouldn't help much.  If you were getting someone into the game putting them up against a rank 5 killer or something(especially if the killer is one of the ones that tunnels on weak links) they're not going to have fun at all.  Could also lead to the higher ranked friends to get on other people's accounts or making a smurf account which is arguably worse than what they do now.
---
So we all thought.
---
When I get called a tunneller for not ignoring the freshly unhooked survivor that literally ran straight towards me
---
Like...am I *not supposed to hit you?*
---
they're too busy nerfing head on ;)
---
The damn season hasnt even been out a week yet. Chill with the spoilers.
---
They're not saying to slug more.. they're saying stop camping and tunneling and these perks won't be a problem. 
---
If you're pissed off over DS and BT, you're doing both.
---
Because some people aren't good at ignoring what others say about them
---
Lol deal with it i dont care wat perks survivors use   doesnt really matter.
---
Even if I play immersive I'm always found first and die within the first five minutes? Do you have any tips on that cause uhhhhhhh it's getting frustrating 
---
If not it's good. It could be my rank (14-16)
---
Holy shit that slipped me I'm so sorry, fixed it.
---
Oh God I'd have liked to see the post game chat...
---
it's either hellraiser next season or stranger things, Yeah teleporting might be it's main ability but it can't be as strong as the nurse's.
---
😂😂 EXACTLY! Glad to know we are on the same page. When i try to explain this to survivors i get hit with a medium rare "LIAR YOU ARE JUST ToXiC!11!!!1!! #FaCtS!1!!!1"
---
I never noticed how freaky that effect is with that face
---
What about the survivor?
---
Dude, imagine breaking a pallet in your beach slippers.
---
I'm so buying those pants, lol.
---
It is from a new cartoon on Cartoon Network. Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart.
---

---
It happened soooo many times in this patch. I played only SIX games and I couldn't run out for 5 times.... This game is hilarious. :D
---
Wow that cracks me up.  You realize how ironic it is posting that here.  Your approach to the game is no different that the guy in OP.
---
I feel like alot of people can relate to this but..still you can relate the most😂👌
---
The reason it was a functiom because you could have dc'ed if your in a spot you cant escape like a glitch. It wasnt made for rage quiting. Your friend also must have DC'd every other match to get banned. Also dont feel bad at all for him.
---
Thxs for the flair.
---
Okay you’re right lol I’m talking face camping and very close proxy camping like where they circle you but very very closely
---
Hey if you need more people to play with you can also join my group as well, we just mess around all while still doing objectives. Do gotta warn we are red ranks and do cuss a lot towards this perfect game lol
---
You don't like someone online? Don't worry, they must be a kid. Still not proving your lie btw. 
---
My heart goes out to you ♥
---
It’s a demon tree.
---
Freddy isnt going to kick them, hes going to L I C K them.
---
Face camping is dumb and it is horrid. Proxy camping depends...if I know someone is nearby why would I leave? If the entire game people bum rush hooks or quick save why would I leave. It varies.
---
I'm not a fan of the whole "It is ok to be reprehensible when someone else is reprehensible" attitude. Only being a dick when others are dicks perpetuates a negative cycle.  
---
We're all adults here. We have mortgages and kids. Some of us have grandkids. Let's be better than that.
---
Hate to break it to you, but you shouldn't have your hopes high. Since the F13 franchise is stuck in courts becuase the creator and writer are in a lawsuit, we ain't getting anything for it Any time soon.
---
Name the best player in the game and link his youtube / twitch
---
I guarentee he still gets mad at ds / bt
---
They both steal too much game time towards the survivors
---
The catch to his teleport is that it takes ages for it to be usable again. But if everyones asleep, it decreases the cooldown. So if you're that annoyed by the teleport, just wake yourself up so it takes longer to use. I dont see how this isnt balanced.
---
If you google it, the DBD wiki page will tell you.
---
Gives power cooldown reduction and let's traps activate.
---
How did you get mobile? Was it a pre order thing.
---
I had a question regarding the new Freddy rework. I understand the power but there is one aspect I'm a bit confused on - when survivors wake themselves up from a failed skill check/an awake friend/their clock thingy, do they start to passively fall asleep straight away or is there some other function that I missed which can put them back to sleep?  
---
It states in his little power description that survivors passively fall asleep over 60 seconds as soon as the game begins, but it doesn't really explain the process of how they fall back asleep so if anyone could explain it would be really helpful :)
---
Bright red, maybe?
---
Oh, he might be me
---
3 come to mind Steve, Hopper, or Joyce but this is just a guess it could literally be anyone from the show excluding the kids for obvious reasons
---
I completely and whole hearted agree with this ! I don’t get mad if the killer is trying to get a kill and it’s like last minute i get that and sometimes I do it too.. but I’ve been having killer just straight face camp me on my first hook and I’ll message them because sometimes I can’t resist the urge to and they act like they aren’t wrong and they are the best like no my guy lol you fucking suck if that’s how you get kills.. and tunnelers I hate that shit like when I’m a killer and a survivor gets saved I’m going after the savior like I get tunneling works and shit but like ugh when I kill I try to play as fair as possible but also get kills if that makes sense

I really don't get the Trapper's self-harm aesthetic. Isn't he a rich kid psychopath along the lines of Dandy Mott from AHS: Freak Show?
---
Isn’t this just 12 year olds in general?
---
Right that’s why I said proxy camping very close (basically facecamping) irks me I don’t get mad when the killer proxy camps because sometimes they look for the others and shit so I get it but dude these face campers got to get a new strategy it’s starting to get old ahaha
---
You can’t use the argument that people might miss it due to bad connection because that just breaks the game in general and in a lot of different ways. You shouldn’t need to be pairing exhaustion perks together anyways. Even if Head On is situational, it’s smarter to use your perk slot on something else instead of equipping a second exhaustion perk. With this new change to Head On, it should be relatively easy to use, making he change to the exhaustion nearly pointless
---
Survivors can be giant assholes. They will bash you if you win or lose. Like, we all got out of the gate, why are you bashing the killer for having NOED? Just leave it at gg and leave.
---
You mean like some perks take away the screams from the Doctor and Plague?
---
Oh no my ego
---
And even then there are far better perks for both those killers. There's no situation I'd run thanat.
---
I like how the salty survivor mains downvote me since they don’t know how to play against nurse lol
---
Nailed it &lt;3
---
If I can sit through Nurse games on PC, you could play Haddonfield. Don't screw people over...
---
Um... Everyone knew this? It tells you in the power.
---
I totally get you I'm a trapper main and nothing makes my game more than trapping the shack window and watching a Claudette or Jake vault into it. Or trapping the basement stairs and getting another straight for the hook.
---
Yea and what if I'm playing Billy and chainsawed to other people and hooked them. Just to find the guy with DS with 10seconds left on DS and he gets away after I instadown him because I played the game. It's really annoying that it's so long
---
He means for trapper and Ghostface. OoO just hardcounters Ghostface.
---
Because tracking isn't really a problem, especially after the chase has already started.
---
Screams aren't their entire chase potential.
---
It is awesome he got banned Should be for longer than a wekk.
---
Please leave Freddy alone. And maybe buff a few killers, depopulate the low tiers
---
No, but it's how they counter stealth builds. Can you imagine a perk so OP that it takes away the ability of the anti-stealth killer to detect stealth players?!!??! It would be a tragedy.
---
Not every person would run WoO. Relax. It would take the perk from C tier to B tier.
---
happy cake day friend
---
It takes years. Havin the same wait
---
I cant really say anything, as I play on console and don't see alot of nurses.
---
That's part of my point. You're not looking at someone for the entire match unless you're trying to be really inefficient (and/or want to be carried by the rest of your SWF group).
---
Pallets
---
Camping brings all the salt. I love it.
---
I agree with this.
---
Yep. Sometimes you get games fast, other times it can take ages to get a game.
---
Oh fair enough
---
for people wanting to see what the live stream is like, this is a quick clip  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbakr3/cosplaying\_a\_killer\_im\_playing\_people\_have\_been/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbakr3/cosplaying_a_killer_im_playing_people_have_been/)
---
Completely negates? He still has traps and teleportation and people falling asleep.
---
Those are just screams. Doctor still gets the BP notification (not sure about Plague). Plus, people are acting like Doctor can't just put on those add-ons that adjust the time his clones show up. Calm Spirit is completely useless then. 
---
Not to mention that those screams are only part of their power, a tracking device at most. They are not half of those killers' entire kit, and trying to bring them up to counter my argument is a fallacy.
---
I think I'll like it on both sides but others don't like  having killer counter play.
---
Yeah, that’s why I hate when the season sets back the ranks. I go from playing with normal, helpful teammates with strategic killers to immersed and farming teammates with face camping killers
---
With his base high mid tier now which is great. The abundance of abilities makes him very stronv but not nurse, spirit, and Billy tier. With the right Addons though he gets really strong. Now the dream pallets may not be biable at high ranks because I dont feel people will fall for it especially since we see spirit fury and enduring combos alot and most of the time assume a killers has it. I will say the new freddy isnt the weakest. Wraith now is alone.
---
How is it a gg when other side gets absolutely destroyed?
---
The dream pallets are one of two item Freddy can spawn in the dream world. He's can also teleport. Dream pallets aren't half his build.
---
Mmm, payback for all those months of pain. Very tasty.
---
Had it happen to a buddy today. He used the teleport to get to the center of the map and found hatch instead. I THINK you can escape through the other door if you can make it back. Otherwise try and get hatch. It’s all you can do sadly :(
---
… You just confirmed that they are, though. Lmao.
---
&gt; Status effects other than longer heals, broken, and exhausted: do nothing
---
Broken is pretty useless too. Only really helps against insta heals.
---
Gross
---
What are these called I want to get one of a survivor on a genny
---
Neither should be an item. The devs have said that they plan to nerf insta-items though, because they finish objectives too fast.
---
*week
---
Bruh, I know it sometimes sucks being the last as survivor so I pay it forward if they've done a good job running me round or their team was a cakewalk cos I've got near max points by that point anyway
---
Plus it's never happened to me
---
r/subsithoughtifellforbutwerereal
---
Yeah, it's never fun lmao. You play on pc or console?
---
Bruh I am with you 100%. Unless I’m playing the huntress most of the time I can’t even get more then a 1/2k. I’ll dc on lerys
---
Breaking pallets and playing the long game helped me in the beginning. Mastering and Ranking up 1 killer with BP to get good perks comes in handy! Always develop better strategies for counter-looping, you'll get this from experience and watching good survivors play! I play the shape and learn from watching Noob3 and painreliever on YT, they're pretty cool
---
Thats good. Its just annoying mixing atleast 2 instaheals with all of the perks. Im running franklins because its so common rn.
---
Is that why its literally impossible to fail 360 noscope against adams?
---
Matchmaking system is kinda busted, me rank 4, 2 friends rank 2 or 1, 1 friend rank 7. Yet we get killers who are rank 8-10 like wtf
---
Console. Got the game for free with PlayStation Plus
---
'Please... guys... don't go... I'm so hungry...'
---
Yep, because the rank 20s screech the loudest about "broken" or "op" things and thats what the devs hear most often.
---
Also the ambush on the pig does not work.
---
Well I personally would never use stridor kind of for the same reason that I would never use add-ons on nurse, once you are not using it anymore the muscle memory changes. Stridor would ruin my idea of how far away survivors are. But maybe I'll play spirit and give it a shot. I havn't been playing her too much lately.
---
lmao he just leaves afterwards ahaha
---
If you're actually sick of it, why respond? You don't have to get into conversation with the killer postgame
---
She's in the same boat as The Spirit for me. Their base kits are fine, it's the add-ons that need some work.
---
boohoo whoopi do
---
It doesn't matter how clean your code is. In a game like this, bugs will spawn with any change, no matter what.
---
Anna..., I just Mori'ed a Tapp...
---
Put a trap on his head, it exploded now he is dead...
---
They see blinks and teleporting and think insta win killer but if they ever tried playing her for a bit, they’d realize just how hard it is to play her
---
Aaaaaaaaand killer has ebony mori
---
Agreed. Plus it's dumb AF that survivors can just run in, tap an injured or downed survivor and then run away like it's nothing, and the killer gets denied a hook/kill through no fault of their own. It's yet another thing that allows survivors to be way too ballsy.
---
You took the time to write this out and falsely labeled it. This post is trash, so the shitpost flair is the correct one.
---
Is it possible to buy kate’s skin with iridescent shards?
---
Tell me yes please :(
---
Leave.
---
In all seriousness I think object of obsession is a super unfun perk for killers. It completely destroys you ability to play stealth and that all some killers have going for them. It forces you into chases, no sneak attacks allowed and overall I really really dislike that perk.
---
Except if you've ever gotten to red rank as killer you'd know that there are a lot more good players than bad compared to green or purple ranks for example. At red ranks, its much easier to depip and much harder to actually get a pip because it scales a lot more.
---
Easiest indicator for me is to check the lower left if someone gets injured during the unhook animation or while I'm on my way to the survivor. We'll make it is so useful, it's saved my teammates and me a couple of times.
---
I found this was the best thing for me, instead of fixating on being the best I decided to throw some BS hatchets and hope to get some fun clips. I'm rising in rank and just laughing the whole time.
---
how is this trash when im not the only person thinking it? Should just be a discussion but people are sensitive so ill let you have the salt/rant flair.    Care to explain WHY it’s cool to lobby dodge?
---
Ive only played one match at rank 4 after taking a break and its ridiculous especially if the survivors are shortsighted enough to 3 gen themselves. I used to run sloppy butcher in the spot i filled with surveillance and while its nice as a slowdown perk, surveillance is soooo much better.
---
Can confirm
---
Get yourself a Mad Grit perk and forget about hookblocking.
---
you’re very bright
---
For real, DS never bothers me anymore. If I get hit by it it's _my_ fault. It's a great anti tunnel perk , but it's also easy to negate as Killer. I don't tunnel anyways though, so it's even less a problem for me.
---
Nah. I don’t talk to people who believe that “a good killer will always win”. 
---
Bye now.
---
Should've put the shitpost flair, dude.
---
you're very salty
---
Lets see how those Teabags at the gate go with Rancor and NOED
---
I wouldn’t even be mad if they kept this in honestly
---
Meme looks so cute this this picture :3
---
Lmao it's 1000 points, you make twice that now with all the other additions. Grow up
---
I heard ps4 gets super loud when playing dbd lol
---
That had to have been one reeealllyyy  nasty hate message after
---
It‘s easier to depip on red ranks, this is correct cause the threshold is higher, yeah. You won‘t find new players there by accident either, sure. 
---
But you guys make it sound as if it‘s the elite of players up there but it isn‘t
---
Lets Freddy actually use his abilities in a chase and lower the cooldown on his gen teleport ability.... So, nothing useful, really.
---
It's fun to laugh at BHVR's failure
---
that's a trap
---
HG is the real MVP here
---
"Welcome to Proim Toim, bruv."
---
So I'm weak if I see 4 toolboxes and they all joined at the same time and why does this only go for killers? Why not Survivors that dodge against a Prayer beads spirit or Omega blink nurse? Are they weak or is it just bullshit and they are allowed to DC I'm willing to discuss but you seem bitter
---
A stove is a stove
---
Use the flair salt/rant because that’s basically shit post.
---
Being asleep mattered, that's why people where waking up with failed skillchecks and the like. 
---
With the new sleep I see no reason to sacrifice gen progression and give killer notification in order to wake up.
---
Hmm. Well, he can teleport which isn't affected by WoO (THAT'S ONE), he can spawn the dream snares which wouldn't trigger WoO because *they don't look like pallets*(THAT'S TWO) and he can summon dream pallets (THAT'S THREE). Oh, and survivors that are awake don't see him clearly as they fall asleep until 16 meters away - which is unaffected by WoO (THAT'S FOUR) and is totally invisible past 32 meters - also unaffected by WoO (THAT'S FIVE). Oh and survivors who are asleep still have a 50% penalty to all action speeds. That one actually would be affected by WoO. Nah I'm just kidding. That's not a pallet, it's just part of his kit that's also unaffected by WoO (THAT'S SIX).
---
So yeah, of the many aspects of Freddy's new kit, a perk the can sense his dream pallets would obvious take away half his power because 1 out of 6 is the same as 1 out 2.
---
where can i get these patches?
---
It starts right back again on the 60 second timer unless they use the alarm clock thing that is placed on the map, if they use that they have 30 seconds before the 60 second sleep timer starts again
---
Its normally a bad strategy, but can be used in well certain situations.
---
Also it's boring to do and play against.
---
I can agree with that. There’s no way to adjust the sound. IMO, the generators are loud but sometimes I don’t hear the killer until they’re right behind me.
---
Could it maybe be 50% of the time...? &gt;.&gt;

---
That's part of my point. It was so piss easy to wake up, the dreamworld action speed reduction hardly ever came in play unless the survivors just got screwed over by RNG and Freddy happened to get lucky. That's not something Freddy can control. 
---
This is a problem. Being asleep should be a threat. But now, since there's no aura-reading and no action speed reduction in the dream, there's no threat anymore. It's just like if the survivors were going against any other killer then.
---
Had that happen when I was rank 15 or so, would get 2 red ranks and 2 20/19s. Thanks MM :)
---
But its true. All the elite players are at red ranks. You may very rarely find good players below red ranks but thats unlikely considering they either deranked or havent played since rank reset.
---
"A good killer will always win, SWF, against a flashlight, toolboxes."  
---
AHAHAHA Are you fucking for real dude?
---
The only time new DS really bothers me is during endgame where if they get unhooked it is literally impossible to stop them escaping. But that is a pretty niche situation so I don't mind the perk being powerful in niche situations.
---
I've found that happens for me. I'm a dogshit survivor (15 or 16 atm) and my friends are 1-8. When we squad its usually 6-8 for killer rank
---
Moooood, gotta be occupied during the 5 min wait
---
I think it would have to be a smaller character, as those would mess with the continuity of the game. S3 spoilers: &gt;!Although with how S3 ended maybe Hopper would work lol. But we all know he's in Russia, though lmao.!&lt;
---
Mmmmmm, no.
---
The red snares are baseline. The dream pallets that replace said snares only come into play if Freddy puts on an add-on, which (again) prohibits the red snares from happening. And I don't consider him being semi-invisible a power. 
---
The dream action speed reduction is gone. Did you even read the PTB patch notes???? Again, Freddy has only two abilities.
---
Good learning experience though.
---
Dude. I was in a game (I play solo survivor) and i guess two of my teammates were SWF. I scarified myself and unhooked one of them, just for him and friend to run to exit gates and literally tbag while me and other solo survivor were hooked. I’ve never had such shitty teammates before
---
I don't think I've ever seen dbd gameplay look this bad before. And I've seen it recorded vertically from a camera pointed at someone's tv.
---
What if, he **IS** the crapper
---
Right like I understand if the gates are open or the gens are done like I don’t get mad at that they need a kill like if needed I’ll sacrifice myself lol but like I’ve been having straight face campers on first hook beginning of match and it’s getting old 😂🙄
---
If the killer is good enough/better then the survivors, the game is usually in their favor. 
---
Of course, it's easier to be a great survivor then it is to be a great killer, hench the notion that survivors are always better
---
She about to be ***^deboned***
---
Yet he's kinda right
---
Are you saying you can’t win against this? 
---
I don’t mean together, and always in one sentence. More as, a good killer will always win regardless of . . .
---
Is that not how the game should be? If you’re better, you should win. 
---
That’s not what he said though. No matter the skill of survivors, if a killer is good, he should win. That’s practically his statement. And that’s not even close to being true.
---
It looks more comical to me lol
---
Ace, David and Kate totally fit well as gym leaders in that pic. Nice art.
---
When I'm doing SWF with a rank 8 friend, a rank 11 one, and a rank 15 one, and the killer is rank 16... something is wrong.
---
You replied back to me, and Sorry you don’t have the confidence.
---
**very good**
---
I really want more game modes like time trials or something
---
What, you think the elite players are hanging around down in yellow?
---
&gt; Freddy only has two abilities.
---
"Well what about being invisible"
---
&gt; Well I don't consider that an ability.
---
Okay, well I don't consider the pallets an ability so the WoO buff wouldn't even affect Freddy. So I don't know why you're throwing a fit.
---
Wouldn’t say salty, I’m not mad... I just think it’s funny “missangelbaby”.    Nice try hard name for the thirsty guys on the internet to know you’re a girl
---
It's still a threat. You being asleep buffs killer power recovery speed and allows you to be affected by dream pallets/snares. There are some add-ons that encourage waking up too. 
---
It's just no longer a "stop everything you're doing and try to wake up *right now*"  mechanic. Which could be fine, depending on how powerful the rest of Freddy's kit is. We'll see how he performs when people learn how to play around him.
---
But I mean it.
---
What!? The LAST ultra rare survivors have is getting nerfed!? This is bullshit! It better not be as worthless as the other two
---
You're right about nurses muscle memory because she only really has 4 worthy add-ons. I never use them apart from treating myself with omegablink once in a while. 
---
I've honestly had my doubts about using Stridor for that reason, but I feel like that perk almost guarantees a hit. I have used Spirit without it for quite a while mainly to open up a perk slot, but I just keep coming back to it because I feel like the couple hits I miss because I didn't have stridor, hurt me more than "losing" a slot. 
---
I would endorse Spirit players (especially new) to learn her without Stridor, but for me personally I feel like the perk is more valuable than any other. Spirit is already the 2nd best killer anyways, so I don't really have any perk that I feel I NEED to have. Again, not to toot my own horn, but seeing multiple skilled streamers play her and miss more grudges than I normally would because they think stridor is worthless, really cements my opinion on it. Imagine if there was a perk that guaranteed a blink hit. 
---
Anyway my rant is over. I'm just pissed about not being able to play her (and Nurse but to less degree) and not seeing anyone bring this up as well as the dev's ignorance to the sound issues.
---
Feels bad man
---
why is it bad I don't wanna go against 4 toolboxes?
---
Except his pallet add-on affects his power...….
---
I feel like this is the face I make when I’m working on a gen and another survivor misses a skill check 😂 or drops a damn pallet right next to me 😂🙄
---
She just got one, that's probably why.
---
K.
---
I made this account to speak my mind. Didn’t realize their were rules 
---
And lobby dodging happens much more than dc s against those add ons, don’t deny that shit.  DCs will be getting punishments. Not dodging.
---
I think its more to find survivors that have Iron will and Calm spirit, and also downed survivors too.
---
They simply don‘t care at all. They have nothing to prove.
---
try pop goes the weasel
---
I feel like they just generally want to make it hard to get BP. Cap maxes per match, bleed out gain...
---
The scary thing is that this means BP will become purchasable if I'm right.
---
Yeah, but we're just deciding what is and isn't part of his power. So I'm deciding that the dream pallets aren't.
---
Words are hard.
---
Primary reason I like NOED.
---
Red paint brush has a second effect
---
Put on franklins bitch
---
I fuckin love the idea of dream snares. It’s legit how when you try and run when having a nightmare you just fucking can’t run faster than a snail
---
Where the hell did this comment section go?
---
nice bait post
---
It's nowhere near being as strong as Wake up.
---
Plus the bug isnt even consistent. The stun effect doesn't always get repeated.
---
Bro, stop being good, it's hard to win when you do that.
---
Yeah, like how NOED, Rancor, Devour Hope, Haunted Ground and the 5 other methods of instant downing prevent survivors from a chance to escape. 2 of our 3 ultra rares are worthless, now they said they're gonna do the same to our last?
---
Well then every killer ultra rare better become just as worthless as ours otherwise i'll just play killer exclusively from now on so I can 4K while i'm making food in another room

My build is Sf, enduring, bamboozle and BBQ.
---
Sf/enduring for pallets. Bamboozle to shut down jungle gyms/shack and force that pallet down quickly. BBQ for points, and to gain information on where the other 3 survivors are.
---
Silver digger LOLS.
---
oof
---
Yeah but you can tell he's upset. People become extreme when they're upset
---
Blindness isnt garbage, because you cant see hooked and downed people. Its like a way better version of knockout but instead of wasting a perk slot you waste an addon slot and get more bonuses.
---
Come to console my friend. No evil post chat board here muahahaha!
---
I do want one though. There are times when the game breaks, an epic save, or just a good game happens, and I can't say gg. It's so frustrating
---
If they're asleep.  Everyone was whining about dream snares being underpowered and here I am on my ass going 'How is 15% slow considered underpowered?'  Honestly alarming how people judge the game balance.
---
Nvm google play store is gay
---
100% get Surveillance if you plan on playing new Freddy, a god tier perk on him
---
Tunnel them down
---
You're just mad cause no girl will ever notice you in the way you so desperately want to be. 🤣 have a goodnight
---
Yeah deviousness is whack you’ll hit 8,000 deviousness in less than 2 minutes if you’re playing doc but it will take all game to maybe get to 6,000 as Pig
---
i love it when itbag to toxic killers. so the dogs learn there place
---
Pallets.
---
Dodging doesn't waste Add-ons or offerings though there is literally no negative for anyone besides having to wait for another match. Lobby dodging is such a trivial thing to complain about hell I lobby dodge also if I feel my teammates will be bad.
---
Also to avoid the camping excuse, I use devour hope. If I have 5 stacks and they say I camp, send them a screenshot of that perk at 5
---
good, I hope they made you suffer.
---
Traps are replaced by the pallets. You can't use them if you use the pallet addon(s).
---
People falling asleep still don't compensate for the fact that one survivor perk removes absolutely every tool he has during a chase. That's why he is so weak in his current state.
---
Your **Dream Traps** (Pallets and Snares) work only in **the dream world** and each survivor that is in **the dream world** reduces cooldown of your **Dream Projection**
---
Good joke man.
---
It's NEARLY good on third seal because of what you said, but 30 seconds of blindness that happens almost entirely during a chase is worthless. The ONLY people it affects are ones running Bond, WoO or Alert.
---
That’s shitty man... if you’re gonna play the game, play it properly. I would rather you kill me and let me get in into another game than you take it hostage and BM for an hour.
---
While yes I agree with your points Laurie from Halloween was taken from the first film yet she appears in the newest film of the same name and older sequels basically they can write it into dbd but it would be non cannon in the actual show.
---
When is next rank reset?
---
4 man squad- Searching with Four = Swf

Does Bloodpoints affect pips? I thought it was the emblems

It also causes mlg pro music play in the background upon a hit

I’m a killer main and I indorse this message
---
3% is like 2 seconds on a gen
---
Yeah, because healing someone in the corner of a map id very "altruistic". When you say "altruistic survivor" you're usually talking about someone who will often go for hook saves, flashlight saves, bodyblocking ect.
---
The reason why it's a bad advise is because they tend to unnecessarily get themselves in danger and barely get any gen progress in.
---
When I play killer, ablout 3/4 of my 4k's are because survivors play too altruistic (teammates get unhooked too quickly, they end up all together, etc.)
---
Oh yeah I forgot about her. Yeah then main characters would be cool. Hopper, with a perk where he shouts at the Killer to leave the exit gate open 3 inches
---
I WISH I HAD THAT KIND OF LUCK WITH MATCHMAKING

There is a new VFX apparently, I'm trying to find video of what it looks like.

i'm a survivor main but i try to follow this message. after all this is part of the reason I don't play killer

maybe try looking up survivor gameplay on the PTB instead of specifics
---
What does wake up do now?
---
If I play any killer I have to put up with soo much shit, after all a survivors best perks can counter a killers best perks
---
I play survivor and I play solo cuz no frens and randoms suck. I don’t enjoy killer as much but when I do play, I usually troll
---
Or I could come here and see if anyone has already made a clip of it? Much easier and time efficient.
---
Eh, I usually just hook them one by one trying not to hook the same person twice in a row unless A. There asking for it, or B. They can’t seem to lose me or at this point keep on fucking up to the point where I feel there purposely screwing over their team. Then again I run noed and bloodwarden so I can somewhat safely do this
---
why can’t we all be fwiendly?? stawp saying mean stuffs &gt;:( we get enough of being other’d irl hmph!
---
I dodge survivors with 150+ pings or if more than 2 of them have 100+ pings. Other than that, I ready up first unless I’m distracted
---

Right, why are some, maybe most killers are so afraid of swf? It ain’t even that bad. And you have the luxury of seeing their items before the game starts and you can fix your perks around.

You should use /s to mark sarcasm, people can't tell difference if someone is joking or is serious just by text. And "no one is that stupid so it is obvious" is not true

LOCKER REQUIEM
---
I did that once on my last attempt, really didn't expect it. But the other person got downed anyway and dead hooked. I scavenged a rainbow map and got the hatch before the Billy realized what happened. Still one of my favorite games, and I still ha e the rainbow map. It's lucky
---
“Are you my mummy?”
---
I feel the wait times are fine currently I usually get a match in a minute or 2 and it would probably be faster if they evened out the bloodpoints which they're currently doing. I feel you should've just said this to convince more people to not dodge because being aggressive never helps change people's minds.
---
Actually it’s the new hidden rework ability for Freddy they just used a mod to make it seem like it was huntress
---
I like to drop them, pick em up and let them choose. Wiggle and you die.
---
My friend did that today it was his first game and he was playing on my computer as I said "dont just press space when you see the wood things"
---
i'm good nah cause i can literally only get nice amount of bloodpoints using bbq and chili were WGLF literally does the same thing but you don't get any passive abilities with the perk. tbh I'm trying to help out survivors cause I know the grind is ridiculous compared to killers which I mainly play killer i'm just tryna help out survivors but I should grow up thank you
---
I mean, shouldn't you feel nervous about playing survivor? Isn't there literally a whole category of actions Killers get BP for just by making survivors nervous and feel presured?
---
I disagree I think it's fine to do it unless you do it every single damn time. The only problem is DCs not lobby dodging because it doesn't get of the stuff you brought
---
Definately some sort of animation simular to a tbag. I feel like the "no" and "yes" head shake are too broad. I need something to show the same level of disrespect when I encounter a toxic survivor.
---
13th of every month
---
Its like this on every single killer. Just wait until people leaen how to counter him
---
Anniversary event really spoiled me with those gateaus ever since it ended and I ran out of them it's been really hard for me to get back into the game. Leveling up is such a giant chore
---
I love it but wouldn’t changing the lighting mess with the game
---
Tonight its pretty slow as survivor. My killer games took like 20 seconds but I tried to play survivor and it took forever.
---
As legion? Wow. I'm impressed.
---
Where everyone I ever need, always ends up leaving me alone...
---
You can use SWF against them, just hook one and camp him/her. They will come to you, like flies to a freshly dropped piece of cow shit!
---
Can we get one with Kanye west?
---
A killers power should do something without addons. Using a trap that is glaringly visible is pointless, even in chase, unless its the size of Texas it's not doing jack. The traps only work if the person is asleep, and his teleport is so obvious you will be miles away before he can do anything. There is no scare factor, no reason to go oh crap its freddy. He Is essentially a much worse hag with 115. Its hag with slipper and hand. That's it.

Hey, u/TR-Graybles  as a Freddy main, how do you feel about the rework?
---
swf is survive with friends not searching with four lmao
---
All I was running was Discordance and it didn't even pop once XD
---
If you guys are playing on ps4 and against wraith, that may be me lol. It keeps happening and its hilarious
---
If you were a good sport and kept at it, evading, doing gens and giving me a hard time, not t-bagging me when I mess up and all that shit.
---
If you are new and it seems like you tried and you didn't make stupid mistakes. Or if a newbie made stupid mistakes and farmed you but you didn't hit third hook
---
Leaving before a match starts isn't really assholish imo
---
Out of curiosity what makes the pallets so good compared to the snares?
---
his basement perk wouldn't really make sense on most of the killers someone commented on how it's op I think it would better as a power that allows Jason to have different shrines around the map Jason puts a survivor in a special state that makes them slightly slower called FEAR but they have to go to one the shrines to get rid of it but honestly idk man Jason is fucking op no matter what and he just doesn't fit in this game with all of his powers
---
Eh I have some killers that can do well with sloppy, thana and nurses calling. If you can juggle well and keep pressure up it can keep the game hostage for a decent amount of time. I usually run that on ghost along with thrilling tremors or pop goes the weasel. I refuse to use hexes anymore since they just get blown up immediately. As I said I juggle the survivors and keep them all injured with one on the hook almost constantly. They are all either healing or trying to get a save and barely any gens get done as long as I play well.
---
jeff's perk on the shrine AT LAST

sweeeeet

..... w-what? I don't... I don't understand...
---
yer they cant wake up from missing skill checks the worst damn way they have 2 others

I don’t really get hit by DS... because survivors make it pretty obvious when they have it. 
---
They always run to you, dead hard a hit, then go down on purpose. Slug and move on.

I think my heart just grew three sizes this is so wholesome omg

Then his friends won every auction for his parts (tampered with labels to be affordable) then stuck him back through the machine to staple him back together lmao
---
Nice user flair
---
It gives the killer a very big and pretty unfair advantage. All they need to do is down, hook and then down you again to get you out of the game. When I'm talking about killers "misusing" their ebony mori, I mean that they'll always use their mori first chance they get, then there are the ones that will tunnek unhooked survivors to take them out of the game ASAP. The anti-tunneling perk Decisive Strike also doesn't help here.
---
When I use an ebony mori, I only use it on survivors that are on death hook or to flip the game back into my favor when survivors are about to win. I despise killers that mori someone they only hooked once, before 2 gens are done.
---
There is nothing wrong with trying to get a 4k as killer, but doing this at the expense of survivor enjoyment is something I do not feel okay about. Killing survivors is as much the killers job as it is to entertain the survivors.
---
You're playing a game, meant to have fun, yes, your own fun comes first, but it's possible to have fun yourself without taking away the fun of the other team.
---
Being the first survivor found, getting hooked, tunneled down and then mori'd is simply put, not fun. Even if you remove the "tunneled" part, you'll get mori'd before you can score any points or emblems
---
Considering why he's burnt, probably not

As a survivor main that plays killer every so often for those sweet sweet BP, I can’t believe how many bad players there are that just LOVE teabagging after dropping a pallet, even when they miss the stun lol survivors are so toxic it’s upsetting cause I’m a survivor and I hate that people automatically assume I’m a toxic one too :/
---
I run overcharge, ruin and brutal strength and beat the shit out of those gens and patrol them instead of chasing for too long cos they'll always return to the gens without fail.
---
Well, that's the last time that guy trusted a killer...
---
Entity very angery
---
People die when they are killed.
---
Love the cracked phone on her bicep strap. Cool touch.
---
I enjoy a lot of Meg's cosmetics, but I wish more of them were 'fun.' The Fortune Teller outfit is one thing, but it seems all of her's are just 'runner, athlete, I do sports.' I know it is her shtick, but that is all they do for her. Other characters, they seem to have a bit more fun with.
---
Idk, just venting I guess. Love the render, lol.
---
Another week, another terrible shrine
---
I was thinking that at first as well, but the way I interpret it is she works with making tinctures and such, so surely she'd know how to mess around with poisonous ones.  
---
That and, as a botanist, she is guaranteed to encounter plenty of bugs trying to jazz her plant steez, so she might as well make good use out of them.
---
Is it worth it?
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
She’s adorable :)

Here I come. Seriously though, how'd you guys get in my house.

I'm just making sure my legs still work after all that running. Leave me alone

Cool!

LMAOOO fucking hell imagine being so insecure you have trouble getting to rank 15 omg my sides
---
Skillchecks now haunt you
---
Thank you!! :D
---
Well he isn't exactly high tier either. He ends chases really fast but has zero map pressure. Hes maybe low-mid tier
---
Well not "pause" in the traditional sense, but a menu that comes up when you push the start button/escape key.
---
The fix is easy. How ever many SWF you have is how many perk slots are taken away. 2 person SWF plays with 2 perks each. 3 person SWF plays with 1 perk each. 4 person SWF you get no perks. It completely ruins the balance of the game. Comma give you way more than 4 perk slots on its own so I feel that’s 100% fair and an easy fix.

Pretty much anything that helps towards gen stopping or finding survivors. Chase oriented isn’t too needed since he has a one shot. I run ruin (sorry), BBQ, and whatever else I feel like that day. Ruin and BBQ are pretty essential to me

Take my upvote.  Uncharted is good stuff.
---
By far the worst exhaustion perk. I’d recommend using Lithe or Balanced Landing. I personally use Dead Hard but that’s a bit different.
---
Yah but i don’t understand how people didn’t get that pallet = button so technically it is, is the joke. I didn’t know redditors were so thick 😅
---
Because you're not a good survivor. 15% is nothing to a good survivor.
---
It's an ok experience. The graphics are bad, but it's in beta so it's excusable. My ping is often quite high since it's only for northern Europe, but I'm not teleporting around so it's playable. It runs ok, but you can't turn around your camera fast without losing track of things on your screen since it lags behind a little, almost as if you're playing on a controller. On the good side, it does have every character and the gameplay is pretty similar to the PC version afaik (I don't play on PC, I just watch videos at times) 
---
TL;DR: If you don't necessarily need to play right now, waiting for the official release might be a good thing.
---
Removed - Uncivil behaviour.

Be respectful towards other users. First and last warning.

Morf is a fucking idiot.
---
True, but still there should be some award for people who get a lot of chase points and don't get downed
---
If I'm running Dying Light then I'm proxy/roam camping, outside of that I view it as a bad play.
---
I guess I'm just not totally convinced most people will be fooled
---
It's mostly learning to read your queues.  If you see someone's status change from injured to downed or from healthy to injured, then you know the killer's busy and you can go wild.  Find out who your killer is early.  I typically go for totems early since killers won't typically be checking them first and I don't want to deal with NOED, which is why I run Small Game.  When you have visual of the killer, just start doing whatever generator he checks / leaves that hasn't been started yet.  They will assume no one is there.
---
The fucking corn goddamnit.
---
What kind of argument is this?
---
The moment when you've just finished mori-ing the killer.
---
**Survivors shouldn't be able to see the timer but Freddy can.**
---
\- I can fully get behind this... Survivors shouldn't be aware of how long they got on their Sleep timer.
---
**The Gen Teleport should be 3 seconds.**
---
\- The Block add-ons could diminish the time Gen TPs take like they reduce the sleep timer pre-revamp.

I’m not sure if you’re joking but head on is when you bust out of the locker it also stuns the killer when he’s near

It’s really hard tho :(

Even when u have a fun time the toxic survivors will just message u and ruin ur mood :(
---
If I know two of them ran this way I'm gonna have a peak around and try to hunt out the one I didn't hook, they can't be too far. 
---
I have never face camped with the exception of excessive teabagging me all the time like bruh Imma watch you struggle or dc in front of me foe that then get the rest of ya crew XD

Same kind as an idea of a reward "We grind a game every day, so it would be nice to get premium currency (aka money) for that"

You're playing a videogame, don't expect them to behave like adults.
---
We have gypsy and matsuri outfits, tennis is definitely still athletic gear..
---
Ok I’ll delete my comment then
---
Not to mention that him stabbing you and running off doesn't do much to mess with your plans.
---
I got spooked by one that was above my trap and it scared the shit out of me
---
I'd wish I'd see him more often. As a survivor, he's one of the least played killers.
---
You gotta find your own way man, when I get slaty messages I just send them random Parks and Rec quotes or recent movie spoilers, etc.
---
It took me along time to gain this mindset, but I also took Trapper to rank 1 that we hands down the worst experience I ever had on this game lol

As others have said, it’s pretty much a sign of sef. Well you can normally tell from the moment they load into the lobby. 3-4 of them join at the same time and are on each others friends lists. Theres the usual cosmetics, pink hair nea, noob 3 nea, brightoy coloured meg, p3 claudette, cowboy or douche looking jake etc
---
They’ll burn party streamers and all bring their strongest items etc
---
They’re on voice comms and they all know your location because of it. It’s pretty much broken considering the rest of them get the benefits of OoO without the downsides.
---
Also i’m going to assume that they’re probably a higher rank than you and have many more hours of playtime. They tend to do this vs lower rank killers to bully them for the fun.
---
As others have said just leave. They’re exploiting the perk for the sake of being toxic. Dont entertain them.
---
Yay another shitty shrine
---
at least you drop to give a hint. i’ve had killers pick me up and then get mad if i wiggle. it’s your job to kill and mine to survive, how am i supposed to know if i’m against a nice killer this round or not lol
---
High Quality Shitpost
---
DWIGHT MAINS RISE UP!!
---
What if we buffed survivor bloodpoints so they earned equal to killers (for equal performance), **but** survivors automatically lose their item (and all addons) at the end of a trial even if they escape?
---
After all, killers losing their power addons is the primary reason they earn more BP, so if survivors earn more, nix getting to take your item out with you.
---
Pls do w the Kate
---
actually that's what you do too by hooking them. Just sayin'
---
&gt; Like how is it possible to even have fun while playing killer ?
---
1) Don't read post-game chat (disable messages from non-friends on consoles). 
---
2) Realize that while they're tbagging, they're losing time by not running away. You will catch up to them faster. 
---
3) Play how you want to play (except for outright cheating or exploiting). If you have fun camping, do it. If it's fun for you to tunnel, go for it... and then remember about point 1.
---
To be fair, they announced the concept of exhaustion on fast exit a while back. Like around when Ghostface was announced. They said they'd be changing head-on to play the stun animation whether the killer is there or not and exhaust you. In exchange, if the killer walked anywhere into the stun zone during that time, you would stun them. This was meant to make it more consistent. Before, it would check for a killer in range the instant when you ran out. If they walked in range slightly late, no stun. If they walked out of range after being detected, still stunned. This was why people said it felt inconsistent.
---
My bet is they didn't iron out the bugs with this change yet.
---
No dude this is exactly what they intended, but it's totally fair since you're stuck in a locker
---
Why do you care so much about some random saying some random things on interwebs?
---
The doctor was a doctor
---
They will turn into their new forms, so no reason not to level him up
---
&gt; Also worst part is i’m not even a camper/tunneler , they just like to blame their death of camping and tunneling even tho i didn’t do it
---
That's why there's no reason to read those messages. If you know you didn't do that, why would you believe in what some salty random wrote?
---
Yes please, if it isn't too much trouble for you.
---
please tell me that your kidding. you think that keeping this in the game is okay? maybe judge it from the killers perspective you potato

---
Bruh. If you had time to run away but I found u anyway after a bit, am I supposed to let u get away even more.
---
you’re exactly what people hate. if you do this to everyone, just for the sake of being toxic, then you shouldn’t be playing at all, because you’re what drives away new players and will kill the game
---
Oh yes this was frustrating! Mind you it was before EGC.
---
It was such a roller coaster of emotions how I got it, we were doing decent as a team (everyone was a solo surv) and the hatch spawned right next to the last gen which also happened to be next to a gate. However, the killer(freddy) followed the only other surv who was not on the aforementioned gen and downed him right next to us.
---
I, claudette and one of the two neas went for the save while other nea started opening the gate. Saving nea did the rescue, I did the block and we dashed for the hatch. Luckily me and Nea made it before we got in sleep mode but Dwight barely made it as he got hit and jumped during Killer's cool off.
---
I was hopeful that I got the achievement but when I spectate, the other Nea she was still on the gate (remember me) and was put in sleep. Only then she made the run for hatch and was definitely late. However she made it to the hatch only to be caught between midjump. 
---
I screamed the biggest "Nooo" ever in this game. However, perhaps for entity that was enough and I was granted the achievement. #Blessed
---
If your awake you don’t see traps, and he is easier to detect.
---
Oh okay. Hope u can find soon, np &lt;3
---
The hand only looks weird because his sleeve goes halfway up his palm--same goes for just about every killer and survivor with long sleeves. I always wondered why they did that. Some kinda design cover-up? (They seemed to "fix" that with Ash.)
---
dont forget thicc
---
Thats the one :)
---
But her mouth, her lips are bigger
---
When making a new Chapter, the artists' work is done relatively quickly. So, when not working on Chapters, they are making skins. Skins then fund everything else.
---
If they make fewer skins, they can't make as much money. That means fewer people fixing bugs.
---
You're immune to traps/pallets and there're addons to slow down sleeping survivors' actions
---
Imagine being this pathetic lol. I'm guessing u cry about hacking when you're found first and disconnect to save your little ego. Or u complain about ruin but run crutch perks as well. Also imagine being able to spell.
---
The killer life is a hard life, but someone got do it, no killers no game.

But do you go back to sleep after the 60 seconds anyway?

BPs don't affect pips, only the emblems do

But you go back to sleep after 60 seconds anywaym

Yep,

“I see the problem.”

The RNG on them can truly be terrible. The side-to-side ones on maps like some Coldwind variations are awful. Phase-walking, blinking, chainsaw sprinting, all can be done to pretty much assure no one gets out. With perks like NoED on top of that, it can be game over, which is especially annoying when you've gotten all five gens done with all four survivors still standing. Albeit, it doesn't happen all the time, it isn't exactly great when it does.
---
I only play solo survivor, killer makes me too sweaty
---
I basically only have fun while pallet looping
---
So i know what noed is but what does it stand for
---
Some people want killers to 4k for free, what can you do
---
Well that's just a free pass to me tbh...
---
Literally the first time I ever played killer, I lost (obviously) and got called bitch boi in the chat. Second game only one person got away, to which that one person type "to ez". I've heard killers getting a lot of flak over being toxic, but so far survivor mains seem to be toxic as fuck. For seemingly no reason other than to be just a prick.
---
What a nice guy
---
I dont really know :( 
---
I know that’s stupid it’s just everytime i get one of these , it kinda ruins my mood and i just go back to playing survivor

The only nerf was 4% to the detection and some addon nerfs.

Rest was bug fixes.

It actually triggers me as killer.

when the survivors use a fake pallet, the pallet explodes in blood
---
I do to, therefore since 66.6% of Survivor ultra rare are worthless, so should the killer ultra rates be worthless.
---
Mediocre killers should not be able to kill everyone like most killer mains want.
---
Most of the time when a killer loses, its because they suck, and need to learn how to get better.
---
Soon if they keep this up only the 10% of godlike survivors will keep playing and everyone else will move on. Lets see how happy killers are then

Why not just leave

With a file manager, go to Android/obb/ and create a folder called com.bhvr.deadbydaylight
---
Paste the downloaded obb file into the new folder and launch the game.

She looks like something that has risen from a swamp
---
Theres a reason moris exist, and its for people like you :)
---
TL;Dr?
---
Haha, I can feel the rollercoaster. I can't imagine how loud I woulf have screamed if I didnt get the trophy.
---
Legit I try my best not to tunnel or camp but I think survivors forget that they leave a bright glowing trail behind them when they run lmao like am I supposed to just ignore them and prance around laying traps in the grass while they do gens?
---
Never let anyone escape. Ever.
---
Sry, no mither main overhere
---
150 cells a month. That amounts to $1.50 USD, every month if you play every day. Do you think it should be 2 auric cells every ritual? That would make it 60 auric cells a month. Do you think 60 cents a month would make the devs lose money substantial money? Thats not even enough to get 1 full rare or very rare outfit a year. 
---
The reason this is a good idea is because no one would stop spending auric cells because it wouldnt be a reliable way to get them, even if they are 5 auric cells every ritual. Who the hell would wait 1 year to be able to get an outfit for free? Absolutely no one. What makes you think the devs will suddenly go bankrupt if they give 5 or less auric cells per daily ritual?
---
Is it for collecting those salty salty tears?
---
Why?, what’s wrong with letting the survivors escape?
---
I believe they said if you wake up with the alarm clock they are adding in you get a 30 second pause on the timer before it starts counting down again
---
I dont liked this comestic but your render is amazing and help this get a little better
---
 This is honestly where the EGC sucks. It’s supposed to stop ppl from jerking around but it absolutely ruined last second saves
---
Yeah i didnt forget the s/ i just figured the i didnt need it. woops?
---
I think when u get hit u get put to sleep also.
---
What are you talking about? Both sides have the same grindy bloodweb system
---
Bro, I'm watching game play and I think hitting survivors puts them to sleep.
---
You know why the queue times are bad at red ranks for killer? Because not enough survivors are getting to red ranks. If even average players made it to red ranks easily, the queue times wouldn't be as bad.
---
&gt; That amounts to $1.50 USD, every month if you play every day.
---
Now multiply that by the number of players.
---
&gt; What makes you think the devs will suddenly go bankrupt if they give 5 or less auric cells per daily ritual?
---
I didn't say bankrupt. I said they'd lose money doing that. And they're not a charity.
---
Miranda Cosgrove as the new killer pls
---
Because it does.
---
Does it do the noise? 
---
If it does, I have a good feeling just like how the death noise is called the "DC sound", this new sound effect will just be associated with NOED and nothing else.
---
its like a fake appstore i downloaded dbd from there too bad its shit
---
It’s bad enough that you are a troll but it’s worse that you’re not even good at it
---
I just swapped to PC and bloodpoints are in short supply. I NEEEEED IT!!!!!!
---
Yes, and that was pointed out by many players. I guess we'll see some changes to that before it goes live
---
xD
---
Nurse is free, I'd honestly just level her for the perk.
---
So they're incentiving survivor to cleanse more totems which is already a pain in the ass as a killer getting the hex cleansed after 2 minutes in. Don't get me wrong, I'd give survivor more points too, but the totem's spawn points should be fix as it's getting ridiculous.
---
Stop. Reading. Messages.
---
&gt; to find survivors that have Calm Spirit
---
Who?
---
Unbreakable? I assume you mean breakdown? Go for it.
---
I’m gonna try i promise un
---
Hey my man, what kinda perks you running on that huntress?
---
You sound like the main reason why this game requires a lot of patience.  Make em work for it. I like that.
---
Well it was probably close to 50% if combined with other perks and items like Prove Thy Self and a purple toolbox or something. Not completely off. But yeah it was even making vaulting speed and things like that 15% faster. Was nuts.
---
No I'm not a survior main. And its the killers anyway trying to use this mentality anyway.
---
You have meh killers upset they can't kill people actually good at the game and want them nerfed.
---
It's like a guy who has never ran in his life trying out for the Olympics and getting pissy when everyone is better then him so he keeps asking for stupid rules that will make his life easier. Bottom line, right now:
---
Good killer will usually kill a bad survivor
---
Good survivor can usually escape a bad killer
---
However, the hook vacuum, ridiculous hit boxes and outrageous auto aim give enough of an advantage as is, and it only takes one lucky instance for them to get a kill.
---
Hell Wake Up! Wasn't even gamebraking (it was basically old Leader) and it got patched FAST.
---
The wonderful bug with the gens is still in the game guaranteing wins to all but the worst killers
---
I’d like it because I think it’s funny, don’t get me wrong it’s absolutely broken and I’d be pissed while trying to kill them but I’d die laughing about it afterwards.
---
I am judging it from a killer’s perspective you mongoloid
---
True is what made me start and learn the game. I watched a lot of him before I got the game, and climbed very fast just by knowing how to mind-game.
---
I mean I think that'd be the best cause then you'd have to hit them to put them back to sleep and that'd just make you an m1 killer. At least you could wait for them to sleep again.
---
Until they nerf it to a 10 second channel time and 90 sec cooldown
---
Ok
---
This is not it my guy.
---
I'm impressed A+ for effort
---
the only numbers i’ve seen floating around in July 23rd or July 30th
---
Rank 20-16 Killer always 4Ks
---
Rank 15-5 all sorts of things happen here
---
Rank 4-1 unless you are the best of the best, survivors can run you around forever
---
I believe survivors are slightly harder to rank up than killers but only because they can have the bad luck to be removed from the game early. 
---
Otherwise I think the amount of players making it to red ranks is roughly balanced, the only real difference is that after a lot of killer buffs (and killers getting more points anyway) there’s just a ton of killer players. Remember you need 4 survivors for 1 killer and killer making it to red ranks faster.
---
Probably
---
the health states are kinda a reason why this game works
---
lowest settings :v
---
What's the point?
---
&gt; Medkits will now restore 14 points of health every 7 seconds
---
From dying to full health in 56 seconds??? Isn't that too slow?
---
No matter where you goes
---
It happens sometimes, lmao. Someones tired of versing a Doctor and they run it.
---
exactly xD
---
Ye but the difference is that t-bag doesn't change the result of a match, it's just annoying. Facecamp with a spammed chainsaw makes the game boring for everyone and ruin it.
---
Thing is any competent survivor will just window vault and mindgame around shack, the pallet is there as a safety lever. If they drop it after 2 loops and a moonwalk they must be absolute shitters
---
The kind of medkit used isn’t specified because of all of the different addons and types. This would essentially be brown medkit with no add ons
---
Copied from user/ImmortL1
---
Shadowborn: 15 Degrees wider POV
---
Hex: Ruin: Slows down gen progress and sometimes gets people to leave gens
---
BBQ&amp;C: Bloodpoints and survivor locations after hooking someone
---
Iron Maiden: Search/reload at lockers 50% faster. People who exit lockers are exposed and have their auras revealed
---
This isn't needed. Right now you could easily take 5 seconds off of your gen time, run in a small circle while you're awake to identify and remember the real pallets and hop back on the gen. Windows can *already* counter dream pallets if you use it to its potential.
---
I wish I vs'd MORE Doctors haha
---
Noone escapes death
---
Thank
---
It was a hyperbole. You also seemed to ignore the rest of my comment. Again, no one would rely on Auric Cells to pay for outfits. They would still buy Auric Cells. If you think it should be lowered to 4, 3 or even 2 cells per ritual, fine, but everyone would still buy Auric Cells packs.
---
*Well, What is it?*
---
The Chili add-ons don't do much by themselves, but pair them up with The Beast's Marks or Knife Scratches and they are strong.
---

---
The fact i cant tell if you mean deathgarden or DbD only proves the point even more.
---
I’m a very intimidating brightly haired small girl. Pretty sure people already do think I’m in a gang ;)
---
Tbh I like the recycle mechanic it’s a step forward in the right direction, it was a little too easy for hunters to kill scavs especially when they’re fully leveled up (have you seen a fully upgraded Inquisitor rifle damage? Shit can melt your health in a few shots). Definitely needs some adjustments to make it more balanced though. At least in my opinion.
---
I would’ve loved to get to choose the perks but they’re still pretty awesome :)
---
I mean.. a downvote for a downvote!
---
Right I get that too that’s why I crawl away ahahah but yeah I be in a party sometimes and keep having to remind them like bro you LEAVE SCRATCH MARKS and they never listen 😂🙄 so you’re not wrong I swear they forget and then they get mad when we follow because you know you can totally tell which survivor leaves which scratch marks 😂😂
---
Probably are, still happens with higher ranks though
---
No you uncultured fuck that is wosh
---
It’s even worse when you know they are using the most OP perks and communication.
---
Why do you think that I downvoted?
---
You downvoted and then just upvoted before you posted this comment I-
---
the clownedy
---
hmmm i don't really get how this perk can be meta. I mean if the killer is camping the hook you don't really need to see his aura.
---
Funny how your lack of caption works well with the context of the meme...
---
Yeah, but I don't have a PC good enough for DbD so it's my only option.
---
Ah, a fellow stalky boy! As someone who just started playing killer with the release of ghostface I know how you feel. 
---
Good luck on your conquest of watching survivors creepily brother :)
---
The amount of times I've lost killers as survivor just by running around a wall then crouching in a nearby bush or corner till they go away

Don't give me hope
---
i love it when a killer camps me 
---
ez gens and escape for my team
---
claudette players are definitely the summon 3 phantoms and then chameleon in a corner type
---
I mean, they were at some point planning to actually have the nerf in the game, so just because it turns out it isn't, this attitude of his is a little misplaced. Even the intention alone to nerf an already meme-tier perk in any way warrants people voicing their opinion. (Then again, there are tons of mediocre and trash perks in the game that never or only negligibly get buffed, so this shouldn't surprise anyone.)
---
Now to talk to the actual substance, the "nerf" would have been rather miniscule, whereas the buff is of course considerable - it will be a lot more consistent stunning killers with the perk. Though for that it obviously first has to be active, and since they did not reduce the 3-second activation timer, it's still a meme perk.
---
One interesting bug has made it into the game with this change however, and that is if you time the actuation right as the killer is grabbing you out of the locker, Head On will actually free you from their shoulder. This is something that should stay in the game I think, though there's some real funky stuff that happens afterwards that obviously needs to be fixed (Head On then applies  just by standing in the locker, and works even while exhausted and without having to wait for the activation timer).
---
 Haven't played dbd fo3 like....4 months.
---
What killer are you playing?
---
Thank you for these renders. Boring outfit though. The hiking one was pretty cool but this looks like it took them 10 minutes max to make.
---
I would just level Nurse to 40 if you really want that perk.
---
Stick with it. Killer games are more stressful than survivor games so you just gotta try and get comfortable. Just focus on getting better every game. And if you can pick out 3 generators that are close together and keep them for the entire game, the endgame should be very difficult for the survivors since you can just patrol those 3 and hopefully pick them off. I'm no expert but I've been going through getting the adept killer trophies after basically only playing survivor and it's helped me. Also, play some survivor so you can see why they do what they do. Best of luck!
---
Yes :)
---
Will these be downloadable?
---
Right big same bro lol and they get so mad 😂😂 I get messages and everything
---
Play a killer with map pressure. If it's not nurse use enduring spirit fury. PGTW and ruin can slow gens down quite a bit. The only real answer is to use billy nurse or spirit unfortunately just because of gen times and map size. Even a god tier m1 killer has a hard time winning on temple of purgation or mother's dwelling do to survivors being able to go down instantly but a gen still get done in the time it takes to hook them and walk to it. Not to mention toolboxes speeding that up even more. My best piece of advice? Try to keep your rank around 6-10. Lower is just potatoes and smurfs while higher is tryhards. Purple and green ranks are where the fun games are.
---
Play as survivor for a bit. You'll learn how they think and you'll become better at putting yourself in their shoes. You might also learn a few things from facing other killers. You can also freely use any BP you earn as a survivor for advancing killers or vice versa so you don't need to invest in survivors if you're not that interested in playing them.
---
I MUST CONSULT WITH the GHOST FACE.
---
It's not nerfed, you should try stuff before talking shit about it.
---
this would just be annoying 
---
i just wish more perks were better so there could be variety but there will always be a meta and that can’t be helped
---
Started with Trapper, but when I realised his ability wasn't my thing and that I'm just bad at traps I tried Hillbilly. Unfortunately I can only use his chainsaw as a really long power up melee. 
---
I found *some* success as ~~Nea~~ The Doctor. But in general, I'm just constantly getting matched up with Survivors who know everything about this game and I'm still struggling to figure out how Dwight managed to get himself off the hook for the 3rd time in a row and why all four Claudettes are wearing the same stuff and screaming about tunneling. What even is tunneling?!
---
Please for the love of god
---
Nea's next? :)
---
I shouldn't be forced to use a certain killer.
---
I can hear the REEE from here
---
I think a snare or something to halt the killer's movement would be pretty cool, they would still be able to see in front of them so it's balanced because the 5s head start doesn't hinder the killer too much but gives the survivor a good chance to escape and get away
---
The or at all ruins this post
---
I mean the chase was not short or anything (or at least it didn't feel short), so I was not expecting the ds to still be active but I was glad to take it since it was relatively early in the game and it can mean a free scape in end game.
---
I became leatherface main when I found out about the barbecue and chili bloodpoint factory, and I can confirm this. I did the best when I played him like a straight up M1 killer. Luckily I found that killer can actually be fun and branched out from my survivor only/leatherface for bp comfort zone, but it made me realize how not great LF is lol
---
Yeah and sometimes I like it because of that but when it’s constant omg that shit just gets annoying
---
Just saying, I wouldn’t mind a DBD anime.
---
And to think that I switched out Head on with Lithe. I was never aware of it's power
---
Oh definitely. Eating a DS early is such a relief tbh, because nothing sucks more than a EGC unhook that you catch and still lose cause DS.
---
Its the public test build, things like this which BHVR somehow love to fook things up is funny. I mean if you took everything seriously in DbD, I don't get how your still playing it. The game is so buggy lol
---
&gt; If you think it should be lowered to 4, 3 or even 2 cells per ritual, fine
---
No, I think it should be 0.
---
You know what's good ma dude !
---
You can do emote of follow me or pointing one.
---
2 others that would require either 2 people wasting some time together, or one person wasting time to go get to the alarm clock. It's like you're going out of your way to be dismissive of the actual effects just to have excuses to hate on it
---
Personally I'd put Dwight and Jane as a duo. Or perhaps Dwight and David. Basically, Dwight is without a doubt sticking to the team plays.  
---
Another good duo would be Jake and Nea.  
---
As for the Final Four, Laurie and Quentin for sure. Quentin seems like he can push through a lot of tough shit and earn that place, and Laurie strikes me as one very fierce girl.  
---
Maybe Ash and Bill as well. I imagine they'd be quite seasoned, not to mention relentless against their opponents.
---
What would be a time to fully heal a survivor from dying state? Without a medkit (to 90 health) and with brown no add-ons (to 100).
---
Very nice. I think the top would be paired rather well with her ripped jeans, as the tie at the waist makes me see "pajama bottoms", ha.
---
Spectacular render.
---
I'm just gonna throw this out there.. (PS4 player) I would totally sink iri shards into buying alternate perk icons
---
I also think maybe the red skirt since the top has some red in it .
---
No. Survivors already hold too much power over the killer, they don't need more options.
---
i was just thinking if i should have mentioned this in case someone thinks i'm suggesting to add all of it. but here we are: so, well, all of the suggestions need not be implemented. but i think 2 and 3 are what i am looking for the most.
---
You can't balance around DCs or "all teammates are potatoes".
---
Adding some new ways to deal with chases (maybe on both sides even) is a right idea, I think. But not from "a lone survivor is too weak against a killer" POV. It's the core of asymmetrical game.
---
They both give the BP bonus, that's why try are similar. The difference is that one doesn't give an aura reveal. The downvotes for no reason wtf
---
Can't wait for Hag and Trapper
---
DbD IS BalANcED ArOUND RanK 20 !!
---
It's decent on Legion and Plague. It's meh for everyone else.
---
Do you realize that two of your examples work only with a perk and the third one is a 4% chance?
---
Thanatophobia is really weak in general, unless you can keep multiple people injured at all times like Legion. Spirit and Hag are not particularly good for that, there are plenty of perks that will prove way more useful for them.
---
I would but there is just so much to complain about this game that I gave up lol.
---
A focused competitor, able to focus on objectives and quickly switch focus. Still makes me laugh
---
You can not balance a game basing your decision on worst players, and you can't even balance on top players doing nothing else in their life except playing videogames.
---
why atleast loop the shack 3x and go through the window when you can drop the god pallet right away
---
So even slower healing than now.
---
Thx
---
Wow she’s gorgeous
---
It would essentially be slower without anything attached but faster as you don’t need to heal to full in order to take 2 hits, Full would allow you to take an exposed hit which is a buff to survivability
---
Breakdown doesnt let you see the killers aura.
---
&gt; they introduced a mechanism that has little to no purpose.
---
That's because falling to sleep is too fast compared to a bonus from clock wake up.
---
if you run noed you are a twat
---
Quick and quiet is good you can occasionally trick a killer into thinking you didnt vault.
---

---
Aren't they making it so even if the Killer isnt in front you get exhaustion?
---
Fair enough I did see that Head On got it's activation fixed, that should make it more usable. But I cannot get over the purple hemorrhaging add on, it's so dumb....
---
So when I buy that perk, I am quiet whenever I jump (fast) vaulting? Or slide over pallets? Or is it only when you do it slow? Or also in fast mode lol.
---
Head on got buffed for good players and nerfed to bad players. Did you read the patch notes about head on? Now you can stun over THE WHOLE head on animation, so, if you rush out without stunning, it's bc you are bad and you deserve to be exhausted. Also I heard in the last freddy rework stream that devs want to add new ways to get BP in the trials, they were thinking about getting BP in surviving category just by being alive more and more time in the match
---
If a ghost face does not tbag me after downing me, i get pissed. That shit is hilarious and so long overdue for killers.
---
&gt;i would legit smash my head into a wall
---
The one time I've ever seen Dwight look cool
---
# "yes"
---
That pallet hurt my feelings
---
* Sorry miss the T, in Dwight his name lol. Was typen too fast.
---
Same
---
Also FGM is fine cause labias are ugly amirite
---
Apply directly to the forehead.
---
I mean circumsition is only normal practice in the US i think?
---
and yet most players don't use it because it takes time to walk/run across the map. they rather just sit at a gen and let it blow up then continue fixing it. it's more optimal.
---
I proxy camp if I feel like it's beneficial but I always go for the unhooker if I find them, otherwise I slug the unhooked. Tho I don't worry about tbaggers
---
Its just a meme btw :)
---
I don't understand why hemorrhaging is even in the game. You'd have to run bloodhound to get any use out of it whatsoever. If you're going to waste a perk slot and an addon for it, you may as well just run stridor instead and save yourself a slot.
---
What were those hands coming out of the bloody pool on the ground?
---
A lot of people say that just the fact that there's 4 survivors and 1 killer means that by sheer odds, you're going to see more rude survivors than killers.
---
I think that survivors have just created a "culture" of having unrealistic expectations from the game. To them, everyone who doesn't go out of their way to provide them a "fun experience" is ruining the game.
---
Freddy’s new rework lets him apply dream snares onto the ground. Stepping on them makes survivors scream and makes them slower.
---
Those faces are the best effect in game. Who is the model?
---
what do ranks reset to (depending on your current rank) ?
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
As a survivor main I'm looking forward to and also dreading how scary he's gunna be
---
juess chrirt this is good.
---
yes it does
---
again there isn't any mindgame in what you said. Only : "dont go there maybe freddy put false pallets so it's risky"
---
Have truly never understood why ppl view crouching as toxic, the first thing I do when I see a fellow survivor is crouch bc its rly one of the few forms of "communication" u have with ur teammates in the game
---
When I play killer and I see someone "tbags" me I don't take it personally because its a game and its meant to be fun and its a fun thing to do bc of how dumb ur character looks when doing it :)
---
there is nothing cool about being toxic
---
Stay awake/remember pallets locations/2 pallets together stay away and look for another loop nerby/drop the pallet early if you want
---
Lose your hope.
---
where is the mindgame ?
---
I don't get why anyone complains about ruin honestly, it's about as useful at slowing things down as thanataphobia is. 
---
Now pop with unnerving and overcharge, that's cruel.
---
I really love the personality of Huntress you are developing through all the comics. Great job!
---
This is savage taken to the next level
---
Very well put, but OP. Specially the wall hack perk.
---
I wear a oversized jacket and carry an ar-12 by my side while walking to school, my intimidation level is beyond past its point 😃👌🏼.
---
Its called the gen teleport?
---
Without a doubt changes to the character need to be given approval.
---
This is fucking amazing.
---
I didn't know killers can be stunned by lockers. I always thought that survivors were giving up cause I was about to smack them.
---
Looks realy good. Face seems realy wacky tho.
---
Just like nurse, being overly reliant on pallets is not going to work against Freddy any more. It's your playstyle that needs to change around his power, not the other way around.
---
Meh not really, mom didn’t have a counter.
---
What do you mean about ping being long? lol
---
well, i think so. i found him weak when i tried and then i went on to watch [**TrU3Ta1ent**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHklDPNc9WZFUY0jaZNdcFQ) to see what he has to say. it's pretty much the same in most of the discussions. his only major strength now is the fake pallet add-on, which is still, relying on an add-on. he's definitely better than he was before, which was the worst, but he's not intimidating enough for having the title the Nightmare. well, how do you find him? easy? difficult?
---
So it's just a big buff to him with no mindgame for survivors to counters his power ?
---
Personally I’ve considered getting this done, and I’m 28, people say I would miss it though hahah
---
It is “as long as”
---
I dont think that it's a mindgame, its more like a memory game, but there is counterplay
---
Shit wait, I just realized my retardation
---
Surveillance and quick and quiet aren’t trash I’ve juked killers so many times with quick and quiet and dance with me
---
If you're the kind of player that runs around in the open trying to lead the killer to pallets and that's all you know how to do, then yes.
---
What? I'm a killer main and I don't see tea bagging at the exit gate as that bad I usually just spin in circles or walk back and forth to try to return the favor. I don't get annoyed by losing, it was a game well played. The only time I may get annoyed is with toxic survivors and even then I don't care much.
---
i don't think it'd be cringey, sounds like a you problem.
---
Love how he HEAD's ON out after awhile.
---
i might have used wrong color again :(. the purple one dint seem to look good so i used Janes hair color :P
---
I'm really curious. What does behaving like an asshole to random people on reddit make you accomplish exactly? Does it make you feel better about yourself?
---
Either LF (I feel like both power and add-ons needs to be looked at) or Nurse (add-ons only).
---
There is a reason:
---
people are dumb :=)
---
I mean, he doesn't feel weak in PTB. Buffing him even more? I'm not sure.
---
ill first do survivors in a batch.. then killers.. i havent extracted killer files yet. will do that in few days :P
---
*A connection error has occurred, returning to your world*
---
How is it cringey? Just imagine that he is a viking if you don’t like the skin. The plague is trapped in the entities realm, why cant a viking be?
---
Freddie deserved it
---
Mid-tier, closer to higher end, I'd say.
---
Why is everyone making this unnecessarily sexual...
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Meg Cosmetics just involve giving her a Jersey Shore haircut and dressing her up like she's from Compton.
---
Claudette either gets something nice or something terrible but they are both impossible to spot in tall grass.
---
And then they give the Wraith or Legion cosmetics because bad killers exist.
---
Sure it'll work at rank 18, but then again everything litteraly works at rank 18, your playing against brand new players
---
In all fairness you only had like two outfits due to only being in one movie but they're making shit up for detective Tapp. I'm sure they could get some stuff for a Quentin as well. Saw and Nightmare on Elm Street certainly seem to be the most lenient licenses.

Yea I mostly play killer because I hate relying on random people, but the last week or so I've been playing survivor and it's been fun, and straight hell :/
---
unfun? she and the spirreh are the only killers that force me on the edge of my seat!
---
Seriously wtf is wrong with rancor?
---
&gt; We're all adults here
---
You wish...
---
Think about what you just said: they're the same but different. And that one difference consist of actual in game advantage. WGLF only gives bloodpoint bonus, and only if you go for saves, ignoring the main objective, it offers no gameplay advantage whatsoever. They are not the same. BBQ is a very good perk,  without the bonus points people would still use it. Tell me what advantage I would get in game if I ran WGLF?
---
To top it all off Claudette Meg and Nea all have the most free Cosmetics for female survivors so new players tend to flock to them without even knowing anything about the perk trees or bloodpoints. 
---
And then they get Cosmetics practically one out of every two rotations.
---
David, Feng and Kate need more love from Devs, give them more stuff so more people play them and then sell cosmetics. You'll sell more if the character is someone's Main.
---
For example compare Nea or Megs customization by default to all of the newest survivors who have two shirts that are indistinguishable from each other. There's a reason nobody plays Jeff or Adam.
---
Thank you! She’ so perfect girl🐰
---
Up until the 10th time it happens. And you have a survivor purposely doing this to delay the game.
---
Damn
---
'k ! we can counterplay him but the way to do it is a secret !
---
using pop AND ruin
---
and what would they do to pallets? currently you can mix any two add-ons and they'll work. having add-ons that work only on snares would kinda break it
---
check out my build about to post it
---
It's when he's channeling the teleport
---
Nurse: Doctor! Another patient!
---
Doc: Oh, let her in.
---
How did he know the next patient is female? What kind of stuff is Herman on?
---
Alright cool, thanks
---
self-care is useless.
---
The cornrows are ew, but the outfit is great. I may give in and buy an outfit for the first time.
---
Well, high tier is like nurse or huntress. I don't think he's even comparable to them. Billy and Myers can OH down. Clown without add on can chase from far since he can apply his slow from range and with add on can OH down survivors. Even Trapper's traps require skill checks and can hurt. Freddy still seems pretty underwhelming for a rework.
---
Everyone disliked that...
---
Wouldn't it be better to have a fuckton of immersed players, rather than players who learn how to loop. Those kinda players you don't see for half the map, but keep going down until they screech "tunneler!", when you do
---
Get Thanatophobia for your Dwight

I have over 500 but I think I’m pretty successful with my little time
---
I only just got the plat today, I was stuck on the 4-man hatch escape achievement, I got really lucky and found a key in a chest, and everyone was in one place at the end. Once in a lifetime opportunity
---
That's the same thing as me punching you in the face and saying "it builds character"
---
Nope. Was only hooked once but didn't go in to struggle first time, second time just died straight away. 
---
Are you telling me they changed the game so second hook is straight death? I swear it used to be second hook you go in to struggle...
---
Noed?
---
Would legit sign this
---
Saying survivors loop a pallet for 40 minutes... Clearly you stop whenever that survivors gets close to the pallet, to avoid getting stunned, allowing that survivors to go around one more time (aka respecting pallets). 
---
Pallets are not an issue if you don't respect them and if you deny optimal directions to that survivor, instead of mindlessly breaking pallets.
---
Its fine how it is, Its down to you as a survivor to find the hatch before the killer. If you can't then you still have a chance to escape via doors and there are certain tactics you can use to help aid the escape. Learn about how much progression you can do to open the door before the first red light appears. A lot of the time, if I don't know where the hatch is, I go straight towards the nearest door and If the hatch is along the way, Great, If not you camp the door until the killer finds the hatch and closes it. You start the progression towards the door and stop before the first light appears. Wait for the killer to check the door, and when he goes to check the other door, you should have enough time to open it fully. Sure this won't always happen but its a chance and you also had a chance to find the hatch too.
---
I do love me some organisation.
---
I honestly think that anyone that unironically says that NOED needs a nerf never played killer in higher ranks.  
---
It's easy to counter noed.  
---
That's why no killer is using it in red ranks.  
---
But here we still have yellow rank survivors complaining about a perk which has easy counterplay.
---
I especially like the: 
---
&gt; OR have a timer before it begins 
---
I mean, sure. If NOED activates at all it activates arround a time where the exit gates are allready close to being opened.   
---
You probably have arround 20-30 seconds to make use of NOED.  
---
And you want to put that perk behind a timer?
---
I didn’t think it was possible to make her even uglier.
---
you don't watch a lot of high level dbd streams i guess.
---
Legit organization is something I can get pretty damn anal about xD
---
If the hatch comes into play you lost anyway, it’s a slight maybe escape, it’s not the free “my teammates sucked free escape gg ez” that is used to be,
---
yeah, but freddy has other things while the clown only has the gas, so if it's close to clown gas and he can teleport and the whole dream mechanic
---
You're absolutely right , don't bother trying to explain, those are survivor mains.
---
That’s what it’s supposed to do...
---
I hate american circumncision memes. Circumncision outisde medical reasons is mutilation, especially if it is done to newborns for religious and aesthetic (american) reasons.
---
The worst thing is that americans think that being uncut makes them dirty while you can just wash your dick like any other part of your body and don't understand that they lose sensibility, and they are pro mutilation.
---
I am italian and I am circumncised for medical reasons, I would NEVER mutilate the penis of a kid for my ego.
---
But the clown doesn't need you to be asleep for the gas, and has addons that improve the gas. Also the clown is pretty weak.
---
We don't need more weak killers, we don't need to keep cutting killers off at the knees because people don't understand what a "power role" is
---
As LF main, i agree
---
or it should show the killer for 3-5 sec or something for both the unhooker and unhooked, so they don't run into him (if he is not camping ofc:). This would not be a big buff, but would help.
---
That is without a doubt Nancy from the 2010 remake.
---
You dont have to say you're gay. No one cares who you are attracted to. 
---
I like goth chicks but you dont care, right?
---
Omfg this made me laugh so hard, fuckin 10/10
---
Theres no reason to teabag at the exit gate...ever
---
😂
---
Saving this for a later read. Read the first paragraph now I gotta read the rest later ;p
---
If survivors loop a dropped pallet just break it
---
I find surveillance very good on GF. Extra 8 meters of audible repair noises is also a nice bonus when sneaking up on gens.
---
99% chances are you will need to start over
---
I think the thought behind that add on is that it would allow for tracking even when the survivor is not injured (they still bleed when healthy using that add on).
---
Doesn't mean it's good... scratch marks are way better than the blood in almost every scenario, not worth even being a green add on in my opinion
---
And not get a hit? If ts safe sure, otherwise ina attempt to play it.
---
i dont tunnel or camp how do u think im rank 1..... YEET
---
Head on was buffed.
---
Of course youd only know that if you actually tried the perk on the PTB instead of mindlessly ranting on Reddit
---
They will be able to drop the pallet, from my experience. The best placement I think is on the outside of the loop, as far away from the pallet as possible, so they are forced either to cut the loop wider than you, or run through the snare and potentially not make it to the pallet in time. Placing multiple snares obviously makes this even more effective. If the pallet is dropped, you just want to place a snare on one side of it and force the survivor to vault into it, kicking the pallet while they are slowed down. If it's not an unsafe pallet, that is - on unsafe pallets you probably lose more time trying to use your snares than simply playing the survivor. But I guess you can turn some semi-safe pallets into unsafe(r) pallets with the snares.
---
Just like with Clown however, most of the time they will still be able to drop or play the pallet, your ability mostly just forcing them to do so earlier than otherwise. So, similarly, Brutal Strength will be his go-to chase perk. Dream snares to me do seem like strictly-worse gas bottles... The ability to set them up out-of-chase might prove more impactful than I imagine, though the problem with that is just that survivors can easily spot and destroy them while you are otherwise occupied, so I don't see it making up for the ways in which snares are worse than bottles, especially given the lack of add-ons to make the snares better.
---
Its a beta, bugs are expected
---
Depend on how large the loop is
---
I really dont know why your are being downvoted. The direction that the devs are currently taking are explained well in this photo. There is a reason why killer queue times are longer than they used to be.  
---
What is being done is not balancing. It is just butchering one side while keeping the other side untouched. If they are sincere about balancing the game, why does 5 blinks nurse, prayer beads,  iridescent head, eboni mori ... etc still exist in this game? 
---
I am not anti nerfing survivors. I am just saying that both sides have BS, and only one side is being touched.
---
Awesome I just got surv on my gf just now. Ruin doesn't work very well cause hex gets destroyed in no time. So I think I might switch to pop
---
&gt; I rarely see it come into play anyway, and when it does I'm more angry at survivors who run around doing nothing the whole game than I am at the killer who played a perk that we fell for. 
---
The honest truth about NOED and survivors will downvote you for this.
---
Still have my upvote, though.
---
thought the same.. redid the lighting and re rendered her.. she looks normal now :P
---
well, everybody is in sleep after a hit, so it makes finishing the chase shorter. And if you teleport to a gen you can start the chase faster (put in Discordance for more info also?)
---
thats pretty funny, oml
---
Hope you are wrong. Nothing personel kiddo.
---
That was very clearly sarcasm
---
With the right placement they wont.
---
&gt;  the hex cleansed after 2 minutes in 
---
This would be a dream.  
---
Ruin lasting WHOLE 2 MINUTES?  
---
Holy shit.
---
Make Your Choice is a pointless perk on Myers due to his ability to already one hit down survivors.
---
I like to play ghostface "in character"
---
BBQ obviously
---
Franklin's because items 
---
NOED/Bloodwarden because it works every once in a while
---
I don't ever play unfair or BM anyone but ghostface is kind of my troll killer
---
But bbq has counter-play and requires you to hook each survivor once. Wglf can award you stacks just for being a potato.
---
What if every member of the swf is way out of the killers rank range?
---
You kinda do get that reward, but in terms of emblems. But I do agree with you, getting a few extra blood points for escaping unbroken would be pretty nice for those few times it happens
---
If its a standard pallet loop you can normaly get hits anyway by fakeing double backs to trick survs into not vaulting, or commit to the double back if you think the oposite is the case. I can do this reliably with all 115% killers.

This build will get absolutely destroyed at the higher ranks. No pressure for gens, no counters to pallets and survivors who are proficient at looping.
---
Just get in the femur breaker and await firther instructions
---
Ah, I am now torn between my main and playing Jane for this look.
---
It really works for once if you actively try to use it on chases.First it does work because the killer doesn't expect it,next time be sure he's going to check the locker all the time.With a SWF team it's great for doing saves.Tell your partner to go down in front of the locker you're in,and go out as soon as the killer starts moving.
---
Gone , reduced to atoms
---
Yup, bring it back
---
I’d argue that the new hatch system does not really work like that a lot. I have seen so many times a survivor sees the hatch first and it simply won’t let him jump in cause killer can instant close it and it comes to a point that a survivor can be in jumping animation but the killer can still close it causing you not to go on. So a survivor could find it first but with how long the death animation takes the killer could easily make it to the hatch before it opens. I think the end game is a great idea but it does need a little work
---
I thought the same
---
How dare you dismiss Quentin like that
---
I love how every response to this whenever it comes up is survivors saying "oh are you scared of a challenge?" 
---
But really the same logic can be applied both ways. Why not play solo, are you scared of a challenge? To which survivors reply: "I just want to chill with friends, we dont even talk about the game we just bullshit around"
---
Two days ago, I was playing with some friends and they suspected Leatherface of using a lag switch because every time we got to a pallet or window, we’d lag. Then at the end of the game, one of my friends was ahead of Leatherface and running out the door and I was spectating him. He suddenly lagged and got pulled back 3 times while he was trying to run out. Leatherface just walked up and downed him, then put him on a hook.
---
Yeh but it's not like Nurse is hot trash on console...she's just not S tier like on PC. Still a decent killer but the whole concept still remains of not being easily looped. Plus she's still fun
---
Actually, normally its one week of testing, then one week for them to change stuff. Then it comes to live.
---
lol ;p
---
nah, Ash is louder my man.
---
Right, those help a lot. You need that help to keep up with coordinated teams. The traps are highly visible and won't stop most survivors at most loops. 
---
Good survivors move to loops without them or SWF who are asleep will run them before you and your victim remove them. I'd argue for a buff in some way.
---
A good freddy (and a good killer) should almost always be able to get you. There are 4 of you after all
---
I endorse this message as a former killer main who now mains survivor.
---
Yeah, if it’s one hit the moment you get hooked it’s not BM. The killer is saving his ears.
---
Is this some peasant joke that I am too rich to understand
---
\-Me, right now hoarding 35,582 shards because I don't know what to buy
---
You don't even need mad grit, you can just drop and slug most of the time, it takes even more time away from gens because your chasing someone while others have to pick them up.
---
coachella ready
---
Yeah same. Before the tough part was not being able to see him until he drags you into dream world. Well that makes getting away from him way too hard. I run straight into him a lot lol.
---
Unfortunately the game isn’t cross-platform (yet, I hope) so you will have to start over
---
Well the difference is you've done gens for adrenaline and deserved it, you didnt do anything for noed tho (it rewards you for losing)
---
The DC’s are what made the Deva pay attention. Were there mass DC’s against Freddy? No. 
---
How long it take to make that change?
---
Were there mass DC’s against Legion? Yes. 
---
How long it take for that?

The post talks about killer dealing with more toxicity than survivor, and I said ye, but the toxicity of survivor is a kind of toxicity that is annoying as fuck but doesn't change the result of the game, while toxicity of killers (like facecamping) makes a game boring for the killer, boring for who spend his game just doing gen and nothing else and boring and frustrating for the guy facecamped. This is obviously as a much bigger impact on the game result and quality, than a survivor pressing a key. So my comment was like: "yes is more but easier to deal with and if you are a good killer you will get your kills anyways". Now I would like to know which part of the comment went off-topic. Or maybe you are just someone who likes to put bad comments under everything that does not talk shit about everything that concern survivors.
---
It's always better to just break a pallet, with any killer, imho... Only when it's a small loop and you can mindgame 'em into vaulting over to get the hit, then break the pallet and pick 'em up!
---
Just to clarify: His teleport takes 3.4 seconds. Go in a trial and time it. You can also time it here https://twitch.tv/videos/448233426 at 26:44
---
I hate how fast misinformation spreads on this subreddit
---
Yeah every patch that they don't get rid of ebony mori's is proof that they are incompetent as fuck.
---
Well that’s highly disappointing. Hopefully the other ones will balance him out. I know panda and gibs liked the rework. They are considered killer main but both play survivor a good amount. Gibs is rank 4 survivor.
---
Guess these memes be laying in *Uncharted* waters.
---
Nah, they’ve got the standard suit/clothing with dual wield pistols and maxed Ghost. Carrying a giant saw or an LMG would be mildly suspicious.
---
Don’t forget that dodge build, or you’re getting kicked from the Death Wish run.
---
My bad, haven't played the game in awhile, it used to moderately decrease it. Wonder why they'd literally get rid of the only thing that lets you know when she's phasing towards you
---
Whenever a mindgame is possible its best to preform it if it will lead to a hit.
---
Salty andnoob survivor main spotted.
---
4 stacks as killer is easy and natural.  4 stacks as survivor takes a certain playstyle and the stars to align.
---
HAHA thanks, mate. It had to be done.
---
This. I play killer sometimes for quick BP, but I’m a rank 20. I get rank 19 idiots that tbag after they hop even window or miss a pallet. For some reason, they think they’re pros at the game. No, Nea. I just let you hop off my shoulder so that I can get more points for chasing and beating your ass.
---
It depends what you call winning... You don't need every game to be a 4k match as killer! If you get top BP earned you won, if you pip you won, if you double pip you wiped the floor with them!
---
Please God know this triggers my PTSD
---
i fucking screamed
---
Ahh thats hot
---
anniversary “event”

Is it just me or is the pallet cute how it giggles in for its animation

---
The perk Adrenaline will wake you up if you are asleep when it activates.
---
This is a nice little knod to the Michael Bay reimagining. I love it.
---
Our favourite resident clapper.
---
Yes but he need perk like BBQ and ruin to be able to play it, otherwise you will genrushed before getting tier 3
---
I have no idea what I want! I wish I had this kind of knowledge - been playing for six days.
---
Even tho not a massive rework, Trapper really needs a change to make him start with all of his traps or something, cause right now it's just painful and is the only killer in my opinion on which Ruin is MANDATORY.
---
Here is enough records from that
---
The fact that right before the Test Servers went live they changed it so that hitting survivors automatically puts them in full dream state makes the traps way more interesting. Before they didn't plan on doing that Freddy's powers seemed weak, but now coupled with the lullaby change he's actually a beast!
---
2 Days ago i was stunned mid blink with the nurse and got slingshotted in the air on top of the pallet
---
also double engraving billy on auto haven can use the hill as a ramp and get on top of objects, (maybe this is intended)
---
i mean its choice, so if you dislike the pallets just don't use them its not hard. But I think pallets can be good especially on good pallets (like shack)  you break. but I like them and have gotten hits with them
---
That’s cool but can your friend lend me a hand, we got our ball stuck on thus tree
---
Wow.  I have 689 😂 and as a P3 Kate I appreciate that use flair
---
Now all i can imagine is a trapper, billy, Myers, and new Freddy. You can trust nothing.
---
At first i was impressed, thinking "Wow, they put weather effects in the mobile version?"
---
Then i realized you probably meant "lighting".
---
Trapper needs his traps to work 100% of the time. That would be a huge buff.
---
Sometimes they just straight up don’t activate
---
Been doing mostly Jurassic World Evolution or vermintide 2
---
it was a fucking event last year are you on drugs?
---
The Entity did it.
---
what about it bitch?
---
The game will eventually toss anyone in your game if the queue goes too long, but it is entirely different to knowingly queue with lower ranks - skewing the game match making.

My first killer was the pig, I love saw and also she is soo satisfying to play, then I tried the spirit, and in 6 days I leveled her to p3
---
A horrible fucking shit show of an event.
---
If that's what you think good luck improving
---
Yeah but that would be a waste of points for us console players where Nurse is unplayable
---
For our anniversary event we got a Bloodpoint offering with 3% more then bps, and party starters. And lights in the menu. Pretty shitty event if you ask me. I’m disappointed we didn’t get a summer event
---
NoED and Adrenaline are both end-game peeks that give speed and can assist in a pinch, yet one seems to get a lot more criticism than the other
---
This man is a visionary
---
Killers are just as toxic as survivors, it's just that we have a 1:4 ratio going on so despite the toxicity per capita being comparable, the raw amount of toxicity is far greater for killer.
---
Survivor-sided game, fuckign 4head.
---
This is the highest quality meme I've seen on this sub in quite some time.
---
It rewards you for guarding your totems.   Survivors now get more points for cleansing them and killers for interrupting cleansing.
---
Franklins and MYC should Go for Ruin and maybe  STBFL
---
Yeah. same with new legion even. Less control is needed for it so you can do it far more effectively. Nurse and Huntress are good examples of killers that need fine control, while Doctor and Legion need far less fine control, making them better on console. Billy still OP though, sniping cross man with his chainsaw.
---
As a killer main, why would they change that?
---
I was watching ohtofu’s stream and he went against a rank 20 freddy with fire up level 1 as his only perk and he wrote in the end game chat ‘yeah freddy is still weak’ I’m glad behaviour aren’t listening to high ranks opinions as much as they did in the past
---
Once again, Spacebar Simulator isn't conducive to wglf (or a great play style in general).
---
I cleanse for points
---
Nah
---
Also most killers can’t teabag back.
---
Oh okay
---
Flip flop is not worth it; I tried pairing this perk with boil over and never managed to escape the killer grasp even when slugged.
---
Iron will, borrowed time and decisive strike should be your highest priorities.
---
Map’s called Disturbed Ward
---
because now its completly Impossible to find the hatch before the Killer or wait at a gate while the Killer closed the hatch /s
---
Why haven’t they hired you already?
---
I’ll give you this, it should be an ultra rare and not a purple
---
I agree thank
---
Or his eyes.
---
I wasn’t salty about the match, it was funny, I was just annoyed that I lost the footage :/. Also has this been a big for a while? How hasn’t it been fixed lol.
---
Dang thanks for that lol
---
You don’t lose your offering if anyone DC’s during loading.
---
Unpopular opinion but I think this is ugly
---
AHAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Pretty sure yeah its Nancy and Glen.
---
I prefer to play goopy clown rather than put all my chase power in the hands of the survivors. Nice meme tho!
---
&gt; Sure this won't always happen but its a chance and you also had a chance to find the hatch too
---
That's why I said this ^^
---
I see he's into foot amputations...
---
Did they? I thought I saw someone using it a few days ago
---
did you got triggered that much for you to annoy me in every comment in write LMAO jeez I'm sorry kiddo
---
How are they nerfing it or are you talking about the bug?
---
They were obviously joking
---
Imagine being this retarded.
---
Compared to what it was before? I'll be generous and say it's a 25% chance the survivor makes it, not enough to convince any sane person to play with a bunch of potatos and dcers vs a bunch of ebony mori spamming ultra rare addon spamming campers and tunnelers.

I was seriously anticipating the game just giving you the teachable for just mashing the icons... was about the flip my shit until I unmuted the video
---
Thanks for gold, kind stranger!
---
Oink
---
Oh fuck I thought you said "Yeah in first world countries we do it"
---
cough cough ebony mori using boosted killermin cough cough
---
Is it new?
---
Id prefer it if they made a certain amount dream pallets base along side the snares (say 4) and make the claws and paint thinner do that.
---
Oh okay good talk buddy.
---
I'm not a fan of the head Cosmetic but I really love the rest. But I value your Opinion because the Christmas sweater is a really good one indeed
---
Unsure about that honestly
---
Cough cough I got rank one without crutch perks cough cough
---
lol, weirdo
---
Distustang
---
Far from triggered I like reading your comments it's good comedy
---
I feel like this is what pig should of been, where you actually would have to get out of a jigsaw type game instead of just the random jigsaw boxes.
---
Dont you dare be sorry of this masterpeice.
---
Well, I’ve seen footage and it wasn’t the best. But I have hope. Dedicated servers are usually a good thing, they definitely revived for honor.
---
*lol he doesn't even wanna tlak to my angry killermain rank 15 ass, what a weirdo*
---
Wouldn't it suck for a killer if the Entity went and chose a completely different aesthetic for a killer, tho? Like, imagine swearing a blood oath as Rin Yamaoka only to be forced to wear a doctor's coat for all eternity.
---
Unfortunately I don’t think it will.  Kate’s necklaces are usually part of the body
---
I’m really interested to see what that top will look like with the black skirt of hers.
---
it is good to laugh a bit if you spell some tears out be happy buddy
---
lol? Killer rank 5
---
Survivor rank 1, but good on you for jumping to weird conclusions
---
Pretty cool. Would buy this.
---
Behavior needs to stop making me want to fuck their characters.
---
That's basically the same with discounts in terms of cost: 
---
"30% heaper" beats "30% more"
---
Rank 1 -&gt; Rank 10 w/ 2 pips
---
R2 -&gt; 10
---
R3 -&gt; 11 w/ 2 pips
---
R4 -&gt; 11
---
R5 -&gt; 12 w/ 3 pips
---
R6 -&gt; 12
---
R7 -&gt; 13 w/ 3 pips
---
R8 -&gt; 13
---
R9 -&gt; 14 w/ 2 pips
---
R10 -&gt; 14 
---
Then it just follows the pattern until 20
---
Salty survivors everywhere
---
How about they don’t fix it
---
I might buy Kate just for that. Looks amazing
---
No he won't, I'm certain BHVR learned their lesson last time. I don't think they will touch anything about him, haven't encountered any bugs so far either
---
I want to do an orgy with Ace, Jake and David, all with these old style skins
---
It really depends on what you call toxic, people will say that every sort of camping or tunneling is being toxic when to me, there are situations where it's completely okay. Killers overall have more "rules" to follow in order to not be toxic in the eyes of survivors.
---
And in MY experience, if you pick one random survivor and ignore the others, he has way more chances of being toxic than the killer. I rarely see a killer bragging or being cocky in the post-game chat, or insult people on their steam profile, really the only sort of toxicity I come across are facecamping/hard tunneling killers for no reason.
---
If they run/hold shift while vaulting a window or entering/exiting a locker, you will get the "blow up" notification.
---
Ballerina Feng Scares the shit out of me, makes her look like the spirit.
---
The Spirit didn't need to be tortured to become compliant like most killers, such as the Trapper, so they just get to be whatever, I guess.
---
Ha peasants
---
I'm not saying fake pallets are too strong. I'm just trying to say that there is any mindgame around it. Either you know it's fake or you don't know. There isn't any juke to do around it since the killer know which one are fake, he creates them and they are shiny for him.
---
All that to say that's it's not a fun interactive power. It's not skillful to use  in addition.
---
and i just change my main from Ash to Kate... instabuy
---
Nurses calling works great on him. I'm trying to get PGTW, Ruin, Haunted ground, Nurses, as a build.
---
That's what I was asking for, now I undestand :D Thanks
---
Then every survivor will run into a locker and do this every chase until the killer gives up and all gens are done. The game would become a complete mess and die a quick and painful death, all because of you, thanks for that, you ruined this game.
---
Don't really understand the new pallet mechanic myself as I haven't experienced yet. Looking forward to playing against him and as him. Thanks for commenting!
---
Aura
---
A new killer has joined the fight:
---
It’s “000”
---
Three New Survivors have joined the fight
---
Sam, Dean, and Jack
---
To the right of the right wall. You can see his head
---
&gt;You don’t lose your offering if anyone DC’s during loading.
---
The killer does.
---
I play survivor/killer 60/40% of the time on dbd. I have hit rank 1 on both multiple times before and after the emblem system. I use to play 20/80% of the time, but I play swf with high ranked friends a lot now and being called out on for doing my job as killer gets tiring after 5 games of being called an asshole for not giving a free win. 
---
Legit, played No Blink Nurse for fun 2 days ago and I killed 2 people on Autohaven (with garage) without bamboozle. During the match I mindgamed a pallet cause the survivor only looked forward during loops and got them in the basement and the messages me and the rest of the team that we were all bad and that trying to be funny with No Blink Nurse is not allowed and that I need to be taught a lesson because I am a bad killer and etc. So I camped him, keep in mind 3 gens were already done and Ruin broke at the start, this dude was my first hook and I wanted to go away, but i didnt because he started messaging everyone in the match and calling us crap during the match while he was hooked. So eventually they got all of the gens done and I got NOED for approximately 30 seconds and downed 1 other person and got them in the basement, then NOED broke once she was hooked, and the dude from before kept calling the other survivors pussies so i continued camping him and left the girl, but no one went for her. I felt kind of bad for her, but I did end up with a 2k with No Blink Nurse. 
---
Afterwards, before I could even see what they were all running, i get a dm from the salty dude and he starts calling me trash for using a dumb tactic. So i told him that i just wanted to have fun and he told me to face him and his friends on coms in kyf so he can beat my ass and show me how much of a shit killer I am. I never did join up and after a while, my friend got involved because the dude was spamming me by calling me a fagg** and wouldn't leave me be and he threatened to rape her, so she reported it and he got his account suspended. Legit though, one match led to an account suspension....that is really pathetic that even when you play No Blink Nurse, someone out there will get salty enough at you to constantly spam you just because they died to it.... Btw, I'm on PS4.
---
Save your shards
---
Surveillance
---
auras (red silhouettes) of the survivors shouldn't show up just because they did a loud/fail action unless you are using a perk like I'm all ears. However if you are seeing an explosion cloud that's the penalty on survivor's account
---
They don't have the rights to the movie version.
---
New killer: The Payday Gang
---
Power: You can drill/saw into generators to damage them heavily, but the drill can be jammed randomly or by survivors. Jammed drills are revealed to the killer permanently and reveal the survivor who jammed them.
---
*”Broke dick piece of shit drill!”*
---
Im not suprised
---
Yeah, they've only licensed the mask itself if i remember correctly from the devstream.
---
About Billy, his power is even easier to use on console, because on mouse it speeds your sensitivity up in the first second and then slows it down for the rest. On console you have your normal sensitivity during the first second and controls for the second part feel more natural
---
One friend
---
I see you, bitch.
---
NoED is only ever useful if you're about to lose a match. Adrenaline is only ever useful if you're about to win. Using each tells a lot about your expectations about how matches will go and your skill level.
---
I really wish they sold more patches, I’d love to choose my 4 favorite perks ;-;
---
Honestly I think the reason all the low rank killers camp is because it's a bad strategy and they don't get many kills that way
---
I'm Surry butt why is this needed at all? It's bad
---
Kate is best girl
---
I don't know. I'd like to know. But best advice, ignore the toxic players. Play to have fun your way. And when you get good and nice players who compliment you and are nice and all that- make sure to give them compliments and such back! Make some good self-nice rules for yourself. One of my golden rules as killer is if I get a DC, from that point on I make it a friendly farm game for me and the survivors.
---
You cant let shit like this get to you or will have a tough life.
---
Playing against immersed gamers is unfun
---
And? It also doesn't give him his Teleport cool down.
---
&gt;He can teleport to my gen and gay.
---
Misread it at first this way...
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/PoorDullInternTBCheesePull](https://clips.twitch.tv/PoorDullInternTBCheesePull) 
---
Yea Pretty funny stuff :D
---
See, exactly what I'm talking about. Some of you truly are scum.
---
He kinda looks like Ghiaccio to be honest
---
DC is extremely common in this game, especially if its solo queue. There are many reasons why people DC but often the most common is to derank or rage. Since there is no reward for ranking up except more experienced killers with often better add-ons.
---
As killer, my favourite is survivors who DC on death hook or during a Mori. Not only do I still get the points but I get a quitter bonus at the end too.
---
What? It's agreed upon by many that it's a survivor sided game. If me and the 4 survivors are all rank 1 and we're on a huge map like shelter woods or that other MacMillan that's 5 miles long and I'm wraith with no windstorm, I'm going to have a bad time. Bro you know this.
---
Why is my man getting downvoted smh🤦🏾‍♂️
---
by nerf do you mean fix? this is a bug
---
I need this sooo bad you don’t even understand
---
I’m sorry sir
---
Hallowed Blight says hello.
---
That was exactly the point of this post.... this comment is kind of redundant
---
Your face is trash.
---
It's really fun to see 4 bps and an ebony.
---
I have never gotten a negative steam comment from a killer. Even other survivors were more likely than the opposing side.
---
There is no and. I was just adding information for a future person to see if they search it.
---
My bad then.
---
Certain killers can overcome OOO such as Nurse or Spirit but if the user is a looping God it best to just move on.
---
Thanks for all the comments, to be clear I'm fine. It's just a shame that some people feel the need to act like assholes on the internet (what a surprise).
---
If this isn't a bug then I hope there's some sort of cool down lmao
---
Get two experienced swf survivors and somewhere like the lockers in Lery's with the killer just in the right spot and you've basically got a forever stunned killer lmao
---
So the killer can't hit you at all during the animation right ?
---
I've noticed it on some killers and not on others. Freddy I've heard the footsteps slightly where before they were silent  and with the Doctor it sounds like I'm Frankenstein sometimes! (actually, as the doctor, I don't mind it. Makes him feel more... awesome and fun.
---
I love when your team offer the Gateau and Party Streamers, then the trapper places a bear trap in the doorway of the ground floor bathroom in the Meat plant...10 seconds in to the game...so fun.
---
I would like to agree with this, but sadly it's not true. If you play on console most of the players are literal children (since a mom is more likely to buy her kid a gaming console than an actual gaming computer)
---
I usually play spirit where this isn't a problem, I'm just saying in general. I've been ran around for a while on a small ass loop without respecting the pallet and still be there for too kong.
---
I already have it, nurse was the first killer I maxed
---
Hey that’s a good idea thanks. Last night someone got that 4% unhook chance. I downed them as soon as they got off but I took them to the exit gate and let them struggle out. My wife was so mad that I didn’t just hook them again but I figured if you got that unhook you deserve to survive. I still managed to get 50k blood points so I was happy with my decision
---
Not sure about that. If the hit cone for head on is longer than the killer's hit cone then no, they shouldn't be able to hit you. If it's the other way around, or if head on doesn't hit sideways, I think it's still possible to get hit. Unless head on gives I-frames like dead hard, which is possible.
---
Nice repost.
---
Here's my take on it.
---
**Adrenaline**: Heals 1 health state and gives sprint burst once when the gates are powered, causes exhaustion so it has a drawback on a once-per-match activation.
---
**NOED**: 1 hit downs; Adrenaline's heal just became useless. Permanent speed boost; Adrenaline's *temporary* speed boost isn't as effective now.
---
I've had more games as a survivor be ruined by a killer using NOED than games ruined as a killer by a survivor running adrenaline. But that's just ***my opinion***^tm.
---
The icons feel real but everything else feels just iffy. I'm hoping it's real because a demogorgon would be awesome as killer
---
he looking even more thicc
---
Skemooo i love you always &lt;3
---
I do think Chains and Rope could become the go-to, similar to how Blocks used to be. That is if dream snares don't prove so ineffective that dream pallets become a quasi-mandatory add-on. It really depends on the actual numbers behind the action speed debuff on those add-ons, too.
---
Sloppy Butcher is not a bad pick, and Thanatophobia might actually not be all that terrible since it stacks with Chains and Rope, but I think there are better choices. For one thing, perks that help you end chases faster enable you to weasel generators more often as well. When using dream snares, Brutal Strength could be enough itself, though Bamboozle is also always great to have. So I'd probably end up with a boring build along the lines of BBQ, Brutal, Ruin, Weasel.
---
Freddy doesn't really provide as much room for creative builds anymore as he used to. Slugging builds, end game builds, Class Photo + Masterpiece map pressure builds, Red Paint Brush assassin builds - none of these really have any particular synergy with his kit anymore, or just downright do not exist, in the case of the latter two. I guess you can still go for oppressive Black Box + Dying Light + Ivory + Chains + Rope builds, though. Stacking Masterpiece and Sketch and using Surveillance might become a new pressure build akin to Class Photo, but eh.
---
Quite some time ago, Exhaustion recovered during a chase. They never re-balanced her add one once they changed that.
---
The problem is, what survivor mains define as "proxy camping" or "tunneling" is as loose as definitions get.
---
Except killers are supposed to be stronger than survivors.....
---
Hex:Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, Discordance and Surveillance with both add-ons that reduce generator teleport when survivors are in Dream World.
---
Barbecue and Chilli/Thrilling Tremors instead of Discordance could also be a good choice.
---
oh man, only two viable killers? Better nerf them!
---
Ik this os a bug but the 1st head ok would never have hit so un glad muy favorite meme perk is actually useful and viable
---
its part of Torso so no i guess..
---
most people that use head on (including me) just use it for funs lol, its a gimmick perk
---
Is that a bug? What’s causing the force field?
---
Wake Up! was definitely gamebreaking, it affected a lot more than just gens. That isn't fair at all and it definitely needed to be nerfed. 
---
I can't take your argument seriously since you're trying to say that killer mains who you think suck want to be able to kill everyone, but think stuff like the Wake Up! bug is fair.
---
Meh, dedicated servers are coming, that will sort the little shits, if they do that they will only hinder themselves.
---
I really wantthe servers to hit already, my main gripe playing killer is that I dont usually have the best connection for hosting games, so sometimes the survivors suffer along.
---
Spirit is viable as well.
---
Hag is viable as well against any team without 2+ flashlights.
---
The perks are shitty enough that this might be real tbh.
---
I see that lil peeping ass
---
*porn music starts playing*
---
No, you see, if we fear nothing, not even our own evil desires, then WE become the horror movie monster from the hit 1984 film A Nightmare on Elm Street(TM), now on Home Video.
---
Good to hear!
---
You're right, we better nerf those as well.
---
Oh they can lag switch... and it won't do any good to them because the server is the referee and it will say you killer model never came nowere near to hit the survivor when you purposely caused a delay.
---
She did it, she finally made it on tv
---
I always give the 1 gg teabag.
---
Didn't they say that the Dedicated Servers where going to come with the Freddy revamp mid-patch?
---
Same when I was thinking of what map to go along with the warden i thought alcatraz xd
---
They look SO SATISFYING, I'm so peanut butter and jealous
---
yeah ikr. like how the fuck is rushing 2 meters out of a locker exhausting
---
I main Nurse on console - she's definitely playable, but it takes a good time investment and some thick skin before you can routinely 3 - 4K with her.
---
Thank you the amazing comics ^ ^
---
No we must assert dominance and show the baby killer who’s the boss
---
I remember getting "-rep too stupid to hit skillchecks" when I was rank 20 playing my 3 or 4th game ever just because I kept fucking up the skill checks.
---
If you're playing as fat jesus then sure but everyone else it doesnt make sense.
---
Yeah honestly. Anything else like pointing or signalling to come here seems like an insult too.
---
4 surviors = 1 killer.
---
No they aren't supposed to be stronger except in 1v1/1v2 scenarios (and they are, any decent killer won't let a 1/2 man group escape if they haven't gotten the gates powered by the time the other guys died)
---
I know but most people don't go out of their way to do that if they make a concept of a chapter which honestly gives it some believability
---
Don't feed Michael like an idiot, Premonition and Spine Chill exist, and actually look around at your surroundings. Done.
---
And I'm positive there are dozens if not hundreds of good survivors and killers who agree that survivors need to be nerfed. Getting salty and trying to say that such people are bad at the game isn't helping it get fixed.
---
Head on me pls
---
Do you? I never really see Billys but that may just be lack of skill on console since i see doctor all the time and he’s easy mode on console.
---
It'll be neat to see if anyone DOES know what they mean.
---
So what you're saying is that when the killer is toxic everyone gets their points and the match is over quickly. Interesting stuff.
---
I just hope for once they leave him as is so he’s on the live servers before making any changes.  Hexy also seemed to really enjoy new Freddy too.  I watched him a bit yesterday.
---
I mean. I would prefer a buff for some of the weaker killers but knowing BHRV that probably won’t happen. They’ll get confused and buff Nurse again.
---
I’d suggest making The Clown first since there’s a clown outfit in the game. You have to summon Tragic Clown first, though.
---
I could have sworn they had the hit = full dream state during the live stream a week before the ptb went live, they didn’t mention it but I think I saw it happen during the stream
---
I would like to know as well
---
I’d say the same, but killer addons are so much better than survivor addons. Think about it, imagine if a Michael Myers got a 4 mori with tombstone and tuft of hair, and got to keep the addons. Same with a 3 blink or even 5 blink nurse. I’d say objectively the best survivor item is a purple flashlight, which is SUPER situational now, unless you want to blind at pallets. On top of that, all survivor items have durability
---
Except they're supposed to be stronger than survivors. The survivors should need to cooperate with one another to win with numbers against strength, instead of stuff like one person being the looper of the team while the others bang out gens.
---
I dont see a stranger things dlc comming at any point. Its prob sad to say but i dont think this thing is popular enough. They only bring real classic killers. I mean killers most people instandly notice. Myers, ghostface, freddy ... we all know these guys. People rather know myers then dbd. Devs prob release another classic killer someday but not this one.
---
First off, how can I stop others from feeding Michal? How do I know to use Premonition/Spine Chill?
---
However, in the end, I won't complain about this to much. It's rare, and unlike killers, I won't complain about a rare occurrence
---
That would be a somewhat free Whispers whenever he did have to channel his teleport. He would simply know there is somebody very close by instead of potentially wasting time.
---
Damn swfs fuckin heckin wreckin me
---
:'(
---
That's on them if they do.
---
That's part of the risk of this game. What, you expect your build to be viable against every killer? Nah.
---
So cute!
---
Hatch? Oh you mean that thing that always spawns near killers who close it?
---
Ah yeah that thing. Haven't seen a hatch escape in weeks
---
&gt; I could see dream snares getting a buff
---
They do the job. If you buff it to the point where it becomes Clown level then you would have to remove Freddy ability to teleport trough the map.
---
You can't completely denying loop points AND having good map control.
---
Then don't complain that you can't always beat a certain survior build
---
Now I know you're salty. You must have been in matches with hatches that spawned near killers. Your salt is not an argument.
---
Guess im gonna main her
---
Honestly? How often are you going to sprint out of a locker when not in a chase?
---
I want you to pray
---
Every time survivor teabags me in game ill make sure to stay by the hook without leaving until you dead.
---
Except after weeks of constantly having the hatch spawn 3 feet away from the killer tell me otherwise. When it stops happening I'll start counting the hatch as a way to escape again.
---
And it's not salt. Its the truth. I'm not mad. Just having a normal conversation
---
Except that item completely fucks killers over, completely makes an entire objective null and void, and again, allows survivors to be way too damn ballsy. So yes, I will complain about it.
---
be quiet you scum
---
So... it happened in your matches then. Good to know.
---
1 person bbq noed and mori that is countered by a locker?
---
Can you cancel the gen teleport before it finishes to mindgame people or are you locked into it?
---
Except the EXACT same thing can be said about a NUMBER of killer perks/add ons.
---
Both can be countered.
---
So why complain then?
---
Do you also think surviors should die on one hook? Do you think they should have to do 10 gens, each one taking 20 mintues each?
---
But why?
---
I forgot who Jeff was
---
He will be nerfed to only being able to place 5 pallets. I'm calling it.
---
&gt;those shoulders
---
there goes my purchase
---
I feel like they might consider adding a slight self-slow when casting the snare traps.
---
Even Clown slows down a tiny bit when throwing his bottle, Freddy gets to use the snares without any chase slowdown.
---
bu wha 'bout billeh
---
Like sure they looked stupid but having absolutely no vfx is even stupider
---
Well if you force the others out I know the other gate is open and I just leave. I rather get into another game then to wait just for thos 400 escape bp.
---
Hold on, you do understand that you don't have to actually do anything to activate it? You potentially can sit in the corner for the whole game and still "earn" it. And that ability is countered only by not letting survs finish gens.
---
Until they separate season rank from matchmaking rank, it is pointless to care.
---
Leaves? Is he a tree?
---
well if your a toxic killer, expect toxicity back :)
---
On the roadmap they released it looked like the servers were coming live next chapter
---
Ruin or BBQ.
---
Trapper needs at least the brown/gray trap bag as a part of his base kit. One trap is not good enough.
---
Fuck you its Wosh
---
You can loop him once, then he places his snare, and you just go to another loop
---
I don't remember a really good DLC perk for the killer besides Bamboozle (released June 2018). Before that, Barbeque and Chilli (September 2017). If these perks are real, they won't influence current killer builds. It always seems that the DLC perks are filler. I'm always filled with excitement to read the three new killer perks three times a year and i'm always left disappointed. :(
---
Haha buddy this is everywhere might aswell delete this post tbh
---
Someone please tell me Ash is also getting some new cosmetics
---
It depends on what else do you have, probably you don't have BBQ or Ruin
---
Oh no no no... Is that a man bun? I'll stick with metal Jeff.
---
ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ 🎹 ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ
---
Oh thanks. :)
---
No offense but your build sounds awfull
---
At least use BBQ and ruins
---
Yikes dude, five gens left? She must’ve been very good or your team was very bad
---
what you're proposing would essentially extend the game for a significant amount of time, considering all four survivors would get to use this wonderful snare. do you really think the game is unbalanced and killer-favored enough that survivors need to be given a lot more time to do their objectives?  
---
i'd say no, i think the game is pretty well-balanced as it is. i like adding more items and content to the game, but your rationale that survivors need more tools to end chases is off. killers are meant to win chases eventually. if the game was 1v1 i'd agree, but it's 4v1 and the killer needs to take them all out to win.  the only way i'd agree with your idea would be if these snares spawned on the map when there's only one survivor left.
---
For real, I still don't know what the key does, someone, please?
---
I like that last bit, I’ve also thought she could similarly have one where the “unsheathing” sound her blade makes while uncrouching becomes silent. Something to make her stealth aspect better would be cool
---
Ehh, disagree
---
Ghiaccio is my favorite character in jjba and idk why
---
It looks like a ponytail.
---
"Its right there, It came back after I looped the ptb freddy"
---
I hope they actually add this or something similar to this
---
Now I can't un-hear it, OP.
---
i will literally always teabag a wraith because the character itself is a toxic creation
---
The Dwight was a locker boi
---
"Hey, this one killer would like to have his movie reference back which does nothing to impact gameplay" 
---
"FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING SWEATY ASS KILLER MAINS YOU DESERVE NOTHING" 
---
But the people downvoting you for acting a fool are the "scum"?
---
Just message the killer gg you get his name at the end of the match
---
Kate is my only P3 50 all perks survivor. Now, she will be my only P3 50 all perks survivor. There's no need for the rest anymore. Yassssssssss I need this immediately!
---
Yes, they’re best friends already!
---
I like your tag and I agree... but no billeh is best of the rest but not very hard to VS
---
You should never balance the game for the casual audience. Because then you'll alienate the dedicated audience, and they're the ones that will play the most, as well as spend more money on your game. Balance for competent players, and the casual will catch up.
---
I get wanting to play with friends, but playing isn't the same as carrying. And when you do it consistently,  with multiple "friends" - it's clearly manipulating a poorly managed system.
---
very true. let get a hit if you can too
---
It's not useless, being able to heal oneself is great in certain scenarios, such as being the last one alive... and that's pretty much it.
---
SC is just a time-sink for yourself and it doesn't help the rest of your team. Iron will+bond is a good combo for being silent while injured and finding a teammate to heal you. There are so many other perks that do everything better than self-care, or you can just bring a medkit (or bring pharmacy lul) which heals faster
---
Apologies if I sound harsh but devs specifically stated that all the killers brought into the realm were once human, as they had emotions able to satisfy the hunger of the Entity.
---
Lmao. Watch samnations video of dead by daylight parodies he makes trapper a theme song I think survivors and killers would be much happier if all you hear was theme music
---
I’ve playing for 79 hours
---
If I heard Barney's "I love you you love me" song while getting chased by Leatherface, dude I will be fucking CRYING from how horrifying that is.
---
Yup. It's an advertising thing. Intelligent people will look for rational, and constructive criticism. The vast majority of players aren't rational, and will click on the most "interesting" title. Which "OP" happens to be a buzzword that gets attention.
---
You can also play it for fun.
---
Have you seen the upcoming Kate Denson PTB Render? 🥵🥵😍
---
Barney's i love you song was used as torture method
---
I cant tell if the top right picture is that one British comedian or someones lesbian aunt
---
People in this comment section go full:  
---
"Why do killers complain if I wait at the exit gates for 5 seconds because maybe I decide to go and help a teammate?"  
---
YES, this is okay.  
---
Nobody is complaining about that.  
---
But there is a difference between "waiting at the exit gates, because you might want to help someone"  
---
and 4 claudettes hugging each other waiting for you to arive just to flicker their flashlights at your face and butt-dance, proceeding into a: GG EZ.
---
That is a point, however I havnt watched the new season of ST, does it show *what* the demegorgons were or if they have no emotions or?
---
Is the release date for new freddy known yet?
---
betrayal at it's finest.
---
Splitting the player base up is typically a bad idea. And since you don’t queue as a specific killer and can change your killer in the lobby, the way it would work is “some survivors in this lobby do not own this DLC, please select another killer”. How would queues be any shorter considering you don’t get nearly as many match making options.
---
Fuck off?

Well netflix already tweeted out that their working with bhvr.
---
It looks great but... THE BEARD
---
Honestly the survivor perks seem far better than the killer. Imagine new Mettle Of Man with the ramming perk. Since it requires you to protect someone by taking a hit or other protective actions this could be seen as protective, as you can keep other survivors from being damaged, giving you a free token.
---
As long as it’s just Claudettes that are triggered, I’m fine with it.
---
Discordance Legion.
---
I like Thrilling Tremors 
---
Pop goes the weasel is also good.
---
Infectious Fright on Nurse is great.
---
This might be the coolest costume they've done to date. Time to main Ace?
---
I believe it’s on the road map. but no specific game mode.
---
You: This
---
DbD Reddit: Cowabunga it is.
---
This better not awaken something in me...
---
Yeah but I’m sure they would work around it for a show and possible new comers. They also could change there minds which is the most highest unlikely possibility.
---
havent extracted killer outfits yet... ill do it after i finish rendering survivors. Ghost face seem to have some kind of reflection cube to his mask.. chrome mask may be.
---
Agree I enjoy their hesitation to pull down a pallet thinking it’s a dream pallet.
---
"Make like a tree, and get out of here!"
---
its a pony tail.
---
Billy's only played on high ranks because he might be easier than on PC but Console players naturally choose the easier options when possible because of how bad your controls are
---
The stranger things x behaviour is confirmed soo..
---
Yeah we really need K+M support so we can properly play. Would be great with 60 fps but we all know Microsoft won’t do that.
---
True I’m right now playing ghost face as I’m burned out from playing spirit
---
Wait, so Kate actually gets some cosmetics that blend into her environment. Bout time.
---
Damn you worked hard on this, props to you man!
---
You would say they test the perk what is getting changed.
---
W
---
Exactly. This sub is absolutely full of toxic and entitled killers. They make the game unfun and ruin the community experience. Aka, scum. Just like those who downvote legitimate complaints or those who misquote and twist comments in an effort to belittle the poster. I want them to bring back *nothing* for you unless they separate matchmaking for those who do and do not have DLC characters. If I don't have ghost face (or any other DLC killer), can't ever play him to learn how he works, I don't ever want to fucking see him. It's not fair and you're either a lier or a moron if you don't see that.
---
Sure but they're not meta perks. May be good as 'tech' perks though.
---
\*\*helloooo\*\*
---
I think the yellow one also reveals the survivor’s aura when they fail a skill check. Helps if you run Overcharge on him.
---
Maybe on pallets(at least for the rarest addon of this type) it would cause them to scream, so if some baby survivor drops a “pallet” and sees blood squirt out you get a notification that they’re a moron?
---
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the zoo.
---
I haven't read about his update at all. Does he really et pretend pallets like the doctor? Cause that'll be hilarious.
---
Honestly, I get it.
---
Nea, Claud and Meg are the most common survivors because they are all free, not as fucking huge as the male survs, and have good perks. Each one of them has at least one perk that's very good for new players. Free characters will always be more popular than those that cost money.
---
On the other hand... the characters technically aren't free since the game costs money. But oh well. I assume the logic could be that since they don't charge money for those characters, they need to get the money other ways.
---
Probably a retarded question but do you make these yourself?
---
Popular opinion:  
---
If you don't disconnect after you hook someone, you are camping.
---
Damn that looks so good
---
Brb gonna run Ruin, Pop, Unnerving, and Overcharge. No map pressure but gens will be hell on earth.
---
Pyrocynical formats get an upvote from me.
---
Both good guesses.
---
Problem is survivors decide if the killer is an ass or not.  
---
You can play perfectly fair but if they don't like the perks you use, the killer you've picked or the strategy you follow, they'll proceed to behave toxic and justify it by their own opinion about you.
---
So you are just confirming what I was saying. A toxic survivor is annoying but have no impact on the result of the match. If you are a good killer you will get your kills anyways even if he t-bag at every pallet. A toxic killer have a bigger impact on the gameplay and the match result, you can be the best survivor in the world but you will not get the pip and the points.
---
Friday the 13th. It had a similar asymmetrical multiplayer game play style except it was seven camp counsellors against someone playing Jason. (It was sort of random who got to play Jason.)
---
The developers were notoriously silent during the first few months (year?) and it was very frustrating since no one knew what was happening... there were a lot of bugs and exploits.... the game paid a LOT of attention to details from the movie series and was impressive in that regard. As a counsellor you had to run from cabin to cabin looking in drawers and on tables for weapons, walkie talkies, maps, etc...  You had to find keys for the two cars, gas cans and batteries, (for the cars), a phone to call the police (first you had to find the fuse for the phone.) Meanwhile Jason is teleporting around trying to kill you.
---
The object was to escape: by powering the phone and calling the cops, waiting for them to arrive, and run to them. Fix the car using the battery, gas, and key and drive out. Or wait for the night to end. A well coordinated team could also do certain steps with other items and kill Jason.
---
For me (and others) it was fun to bask in the effort they put into getting all the details right, and find all the references to the movies - but it eventually got boring running around looking for items, especially if you get a bad RNG and spend the entire game opening empty drawers only to get killed. Since everyone is on comms (including Jason) there was a lot of cheating, sandbagging, or people helping Jason. There were a lot of kids playing, screaming into their mics... 
---
The devs got burnt out, the player base dwindled to triple digits and then there was a lawsuit involving the rights holders of Jason which put development into limbo and eventually the devs said they were no longer going to update the game, no matter the outcome of the lawsuit.
---
Tiptoe through the tulips anyone?
---
I think u/skemooo already did one
---
Still no news on Invisible Skill Checks? No Dead Hard, Self Care, Or Exit through thte gates bug? Nothing?
---
What the fuck is wrong with this company.
---
I wouldn’t worry about slowing the game down too much in the lower ranks since most survivors are potatoes. BBQ is great tho
---
She gets as much love as David does according to the cosmetic piece numbers and despite being released 9 months after Nea, Feng only has 3 less purchasable cosmetic pieces than her. 
---
It just seems like a decent portion of the subreddit pays more attention to Feng's cosmetic releases because they aren't getting exactly what they want, there's always some top post about "Still no Bunny Feng".
---
I'M the captain now
---
Moniter and Abuse, Ruin, BBQ, or Nurses Calling would all be great for you
---
Leatherface so you can get BBQ and Chili
---
lookin like jesus from the walking dead
---
Please receive christ
---
Both of you
---
You toxic survivors really don't think too much, do you?
---
You think a game with this playerbase size can afford to split a playerbase like that in multiple ways? 
---
CoD did that and COMPLETELY killed all of their old games. 
---
stop being mad and trying to ruin the game cause you're too inept to adapt.
---
Wholesome
---
I'd have preferred a half bun, but I'll be getting this for sure.
---
Yeah i just leveled meg, especially since i just wanted Sprint Burst and Adrenaline from her and to use her as a main. Now to get Plunders and Pharmacy on Ace so i can have an item build.
---
I don't think they have, but I'm not sure. I pretty much through the match when I'm placed on that map though. I'll dick around and farm with the survivors before I DC.
---
#*Heartbeat*
---
I was waiting for someone to make this.
---
The beard is an issue in many of his skins. His normal one is so big that his neck looks really weird in any of the others.
---
Even better my friend it’s a add on but he sets up fake pallets. So when they drop it it bursts into blood and disappears. Enjoy swinging through for an easy down
---
True, but it's easy to break out of lower ranks quite fast.  And with the matchmaking system as it is, he's still likely to be put up against survivors that are out of his league.
---
In my experience this isn’t true at all
---
not even shock therapy tho
---
How the fuck is your comment a legitimate complaint when all you say is "lol no" and you don't even back it up with a reasonable explanation and instead whine about downvotes?
---
True.
---
I think she is a lil more T H I C C
---
Real talk the snares are boring. Why not just make the pallets his actual power?
---
Left. Leave. Leaving. Leaves. Yes.
---
In my opinion, snares are unique but underpowered
---
I hope her hair doesn't remain all stringy. I Love the rest.
---
I thought she had stretched ears for a second and almost nutted
---
Then realise its a broken key...
---
Yes.  
---
An additional problem with that is that usually one side will perceive something as "toxic" even though it isn't.  
---
"These guys have been looping me for ages. Fuck them. I'll facecamp these assholes."  
---
"Genrush? Toxic. I'll facecamp you too."  
---
Seen killers say this. "I only camped because you genrushed."  
---
It's worse if you face survivors.  
---
They behave toxic because they don't like the perks you brought. Or the killer you've picked.
---
I've seen survivors be toxic and when I asked them why they just told me: "It's because you play Doc" or "It's because you play Legion."  
---
Reminds me of the old League of Legends days where people would report you for picking Evelynn. (After she lost her stun).  
---
I personally don't have a problem with insulting someone that started to insult me first.
---
Or if someone points at you/flickers his flashlight after every pallet you know that he's trying to get on your nerves.
---
But when people go by vague subjective things it becomes a problem.  
---
Camping? TOXIC. THAT JUSTIFIES ME INSULTING YOU. Even though camping is perfectly fine.
---
If I see your 3 buddys standing 10m in front of me spamming the 'Come here' emote I will stay next to the hooked guy. You aren't doing any progress. So why should I DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT ME TO?  
---
Tunneling? A survivors definition of tunneling is as subjective as camping is. If the killer manages to find you twice they'll throw this 'insult' at your face.
---
I hope this doesn't mean we won't be getting an antique deep sea diver killer in the future
---
Oh my god, I am a filthy survivor main but I cannot wait for the mayhem in end game chat when a teammate gets tricked by one of those.
---
I like the torso and pants, not really feeling the hair.
---
Bhvr give us the cowgirl hat for Kate :c
---
Yes is a Head on bug.  The bug and the reason for it to happen has already been  reported to the devs. Glad that it got found during the PTB and hopefully fixed for the Live version.
---
The art team doing a great job as usual.
---
No I'm saying with a toxic killer you're out of the game faster than with a toxic survivor. Even as a survivor, you're often stuck with another toxic survivor longer than you would a toxic killer because that survivor can go drop a bunch of pallets and hide in a locker. The best you can do against that is try to lead the killer to them and hope the killer gets what's going on.
---
Probably some toxic 10 year old survivor main.
---
I'm going to miss these.
---
I want the “uhhh so horny, uhhh so horny” song personally.
---
If you make a meme based on a opinion it's obvious that in the comments there will be people who give their opinion. As you see the most part of the comments there are doing so. 
---
Anyways the post flag is suggestion so if someone suggest something you have to expect that people will think about it and reply. 
---
Another think that I can't understand is: even if it is just a meme so the only allowed comments are "ahahahahaha so funny" or every other sentence will transform the post into a discussion?
---
Is this loss?
---
There is a wiki for a reason
---
"The Wardens... Members of an ancient order... Fallen into dust..."
---
"Sworn to defend the weak... Masters... Of the longsword."
---
"Their origins lost to history, still they fight for what is right."
---
"Driven by duty, devoted to their people."
---
"But only a few... May join their order..."
---
didn't know wraith hosts funerals
---
It's because the intend is to taunt the killer.  
---
It doesn't matter if you take it personal or not. Somebody will.
---
Just "crouching" isn't toxic.   
---
Flickering you're flashlight/pointing at your face after every pallet drop; Waiting at the exit gates just to hit you with a couple of t-bags; Followed by a: GG EZ BABY KILLER in the chat though IS toxic.  
---
You might find that funny.  
---
You might not care about it.  
---
But somebody will.
---
Taunting the killer isn't fun for the killer, and this is what it is about.
---
Survivors DCing when caught is a very wide spread problem that devs needs to fix.
---
Can we get one of Claudette and Nea’s?
---
I'd wait until they finish optimizing the game before they increase the quality of the graphics.
---
The perk makes you unable to get hit for a short time like dead hard so you shouldnt get a protection stack for m.o.m but when i think about its prob to op because you could just ramm the killer when hes picking up someone when you save it for later, so it would be a garant save from a hook lmao. Well its just an idea anyways

Survive with strangers all the way
---
I think most of the 2016-2017 problems that made survivor strong wasn't in the game because survivors asked for it. It was just oversight by the devs really. I dont think the devs are sided anywhich way.
---
95% of the time i play solo (i have a friend that she's a killer main and refuse to play survivor unless she has multiple dailies to do as survivors and i play with her) because it's quite frustrating to be dodged constantly or waiting around 10-15 minutes for a match only so the killer will dodge, i also have that kind of fear that i'll do something really stupid and my teammates will blame me for screwing up the entire match for them + i've noticed most killers will proxy camp because they know how overly altruistic swf are and that will win most of their matches so i'm just better off playing solo even if sometimes it's infuriating af
---
They're kind of just a mix between clown and hag traps. The area isn't big enough to have any real effect other than making a slow vault.
---
It's main purpose is techniaclly to use addons on it for aura reading. But the purple and pink keys allow you to open the hatch early so thats what every actually uses them for.
---
That’s what i meant by protection. He can’t hit you but you also get in the way of the other person getting hit, so does it count? Same sort of issue with Borrowed Time, does the immunity let you take a hit, get the bleedout timer from Deep Wounds but still give you the token?
---
**DI MOLTO**
---
Deliverance is a good perk in the lower ranks (for obvious reasons). But in the higher ranks, it does not justify a perk slot in my opinion.
---
Ngl if this is coming i might have to drop a bit on the game to get it.
---
Why would you say "hello" to the killer in a manner that's usually perceived as an insult?
---
This skin hard. I’m still waiting on the failed chute Dwight tho
---
I play solo for the pro’s you listed. I’ve found a lot of SWF (when I have accepted the invite in lobby in the past) to be toxic and actually grief you if you don’t do what they say.
---
I’d rather have an actual game where we communicate with hand signals than someone eating chips screaming on mic with their smoke alarm batteries dying in the background.
---
Also, I’ve seen a lot of SWF spawn in, hate the killer and decide to DC one by one until it’s just you, whether or not you decided to join their squad.
---
I know 😂😂 ahah i was playing with a friend and he wouldn’t move his camera anywhere else ahahha I had to get a pic of that booootttyy 😂😂
---
See, this is one of these 50 IQ survivors I've been talking about that ruins the game.
---
So I suppose survivors are toxic for using Balanced Landing and Urban Evasion since they already have so many options to get away from the killer?
---
survivors who waste pallets are also the ones who complain why their teammates got downed in the first 30 seconds of the chase
---
"This is the worst day ever."
---
"Because we're being chased by a murderer?"
---
"No, because it's a little humid *yes because we're being chased by a murderer!*"
---
I've used this argument before because it's 100% the truth but a lot of people don't seem to understand this.
---
I still can't see him, is he inside or outside the exit gate area?
---
My endgame piggy wants to have a word with you
---
So swf you need to find who you vibe with friend them and play with them all the time. When you do the community swf it sucks like ps4 you can do that make your own party put it in the community and people will randomly join but if they're annoying or constantly singing I can kick them and someone else can join. 
---
I literally have 600 friends on ps4 and like to play with the 3 same guys everytime I swf. We all get each other, never have to worry if someone is doing gens and we all cleanse totems. We work so well together and it's fun.  You have gotta find that!! You will then love swf!! 
---
I some times play solo its nice also.. testing out your skills without knowing if you have people to lean on and help you through.  It's such a gamble.
---
That seems accurate.
---
I used to play SWF on Discord religiously and hated solo. I'm at the point now where I can barely stand SWF. 
---
For me it's Duo &gt; Solo &gt; SWF
---
Benny hill's theme.
---
I remember getting comment bombed by a four man SWF when I DC'd. They were all calling me a pussy and stuff but in reality I just had to go and didn't have time to finish the game.
---
Lol bruh. I had a David tbag at every pallet but when I tbagged him he disconnected. Fucking hilarious. The tbagger has become the tbagee
---
For me it really depends on the person you get. I've done SWF with some cool people but also with some people i can't stand lol
---
never tried duos
---
True, I think DbD would have done a better job than Friday the 13th

---
Well what exactly is the difference between crouching and tbagging in your opinion?  
---
Also tbagging is in no way a bannable offense for valid reason, if it triggers you to the point of not enjoying the game then you might want to find another game. It's like survivors being mad for getting hooked, sorry you used a mechanic in the game? 
---
Crouching/tbagging has been defined as toxic strictly on the reddit, anybody who plays the game casually / isnt subbed to the reddit wouldnt know it is toxic and would be punished for using ~a mechanic in the game~
---
Where's shirtless clown
---
Truly as long as the high rank survivor isnt being a dickhead I dont mind that much. It's the fact that many higher ranked players feel the need to show off their experience by teabagging and clickyclickying that puts me off.
---
Hit em with a quick ez4ence when you get absolutely destroyed in the first 14 seconds of the game.
---
STOP CRYING ABOUT NEW FREDDY BEING OP, JUST GET USED TO HIM OR YOU WILL FACE NURSES/SPIRITS/BILLYS TILL THE END OF YOUR MISERABLE LIFE
---
U better not have tbagged.
---
Wow, any excuse a killer can find to facecamp...  sad little dbd world we play in... I would've pointed also.. I feel like you couldve made it to shack pallet if you would've kept running.. he wasnt a good wraith.
---
Yeah that’s a struggle, I hate hearing another person’s game lol.
---
If I do what they say every time, that would mean me abandoning a 80-90% progressed gen from across the map (and possibly also injured) to unhook their friend that keeps purposely running into or BMing the killer - all while they are in closer proximity and could easily do the same.
---
How was he toxic? Cause he killed the other 3?
---
It'll remain short. Sadly but you'll see.
---
I honestly wasnt thinking about to many other perks when i had the idea for it but it prob should only work when you are in a chase. Since the killer cant get in a chase when hes carrying someone. There would be no way to get the stun wat also means no way to stack m.o.m. im not sure if i unterstand you right with the borrrowtime issue, my english isnt best. So i would like to explain the perk again. You gain 1 token after 60 seconds of beeing chased. And you lose the token when you use it and ram the killer this would mean you could avoid beeing hit by legion frency and stun him so you wouldnt get bleed out timer also you could avoid beeing hit after you got saved with borrow time so there would be no timer.
---
oh no
---
&gt; hopefully
---
we need to form a movement
---
I can literally see hair resting on the back of her hood wym
---
Laughs in small game!!!
---
Anybody else getting slight Life Is Strange vibes from this?
---
I feel like to balance it out it should either be on a time limit or at the end of the game cleansing ANY totem will deactivate NOED.
---
ah, apparently I’m an ace main now.
---
Also killer main here, I get that she’s ridiculous, but only if you take the time to actually get good at her
---
Dude, you fucking killed him.
---
Well as a both side player, getting a survivor like this as killer would make me just kill him for first, getting a team mate like this as survivor would make me smash my keyboard
---
i can’t tell if that quality is good or bad for mobile
---
Seriously...who does that?!
---
Same kind of person that likes kicking puppies right?
---
Time zones aren't the same for everyone maybe more people are on in another region at that time or something
---
Pretty sure there's a Ghostface cosmetic somewhere are you going to post it any time soon?
---
I'm pretty sure they mentioned a summer event in either their live anniversary stream or another one.i cant remember
---
Not that I can recall. He’s just not a very good killer. Absolutely fun if you’re looking to have fun. Also since you’ve been gone a year you’re in the ranks where you won’t get dominated for playing a not great Killer.
---
I agree, when people DC or give up it really hurts the team.
---
I just think that "toxicity" in this game is super fucking overblown and stupid. I don't think that tbagging and flashlight clicking is "toxic", I think those two things should be considered like emotes are, as a way to BM, and BMing and being toxic are not the same thing. Also don't even get me started on killers who think that genrushing and looping are toxic just because they can't deal with them because they are bad, and killers complaining about crutch perks while they run enduring / spirit fury every game. 
---
Same goes for the survivor side, most survivors that complain about tunneling can't loop and/or draw too much attention to themselves so they get caught, and if the killer facecamps one person on first hook, at least 3 and maybe 4 gens should pop during that time so the killer is screwed afterwards.
---
I swear man people just take this game so fucking seriously and if you all can just loosen up and enjoy the game and its BM maybe you'll actually have fun instead of feeling the need to bitch about toxicity on reddit.

Spies From The Shadows.

Whispers will tell you if you’re in range of a survivor (and this perk’s range), and since people still ignore crows the Spies will tell you exactly where they are.

Good idea, I just did that. Thanks!

Definitely need Loe tums

I remember finding the hex ruin within 10 seconds of the game starting. It was in the map that has the circus area, and it was under the red and white striped tent when I turned the corner after spawning

Amanda 😍🐷

Oh easy. Survivors. The entire game is designed in a way in which you the killer is dehumanized. They dont care that you are a person too, your actions directly affect the success of four others. They gang up, they talk to eachother, and together they decide they are right and the killer is in the wrong. This breeds toxicity. They then begin taunting. It may start as a way to distract a killer, but it turns to toxic play and serious bad sportsmanship. This frustrates killers, who then return the favor. Bad killers get tired of it quickly and become toxic themselves, camping and tunneling so they can get any kills, which continues the cycle as the survivors now have something to complain about. Its a vicious cycle of rage. Thats why I dropped from red ranks, I play in around 10 now, and relax, usually let 2 people leave, and we have fair fun games. You dont get anything for playing in red anyway, just stress. The game can be fun, when everyone takes it less seriously
---
I got bullied so hard the other day when I played freddy I wanted to scream as a matter of fact I did. Bring new freddy to me!
---
I was just posting because there was a lot of people who thought it made it to the ptb
---
hi it me
---
Theres a few good vids on YouTube about this. Personally, I think looping is always about planning ahead, specifically knowing where you're going to loop first if you're doing a Gen. If a Killer appears, where are you going to run to so you can try to loop them but also, you need to know roughly which direction you're going to run after you've dropped a pallet for example.  
---
Definitely when you're looping jungle gyms and the killer shack, use the killers red stain to your advantage (the red mark infront of them to indicate where they are looking/coming from). Looping takes a while as its all about mindgaming the killer (and not letting the killer mindgame you).
---
Killers shack is a good place to learn. Learn when to use the window, when to use the pallet, when to use the short outside route and when to use the long one.  
---
Honestly, its just practice but try to look behind as much as you can, know how far you have to run to loop around something ensuring you dont run into any objects and dont push your luck with the pallet. If you think you're going to get hit, drop it then I usually stand there for a split second. If you drop the pallet and run off immediately to the left for instance, they might not break the pallet and just run left and catch you. You want to stand there for a split second (you might see streamers do a little 360 spin when the drop it) as its to confuse the killer. At that point of dropping the pallet, the killer is going to most likely think "is this guy going, left, right or ahead?" and that answer will depend on them smashing the pallet or not.
---
What is best killer rn then? Oh wait i already know its the docta man
---
Wait time is usually good, but sometimes it takes really long, i think the lobby bugs or something. Like, 3 survivor join and it takes forever for the fourth one.
---
Question is did he get points for it counting as a kill as well.
---
good on you man
---
Flight-Captain Ace, I love it.
---
I'll get the whole set 😍
---
It probably happened right around when you left and didn’t start until you launched the game again
---
I’m not even in red ranks yet which is sad. I’m rank 16 and every match I get at least 1 person messaging me and if I’m lucky I get up to 3 lol. I don’t even want to climb ranks I just want to have fun
---
God damn. Actually awesome
---
No0b3 is Nea wym
---
OH MY GOD THAT IS BEAUTIFUL
---
How was he toxic? What'd he do?
---
That sucks. Oh well.
---
Hahaha that’s amazing
---
I’m an Ace main now
---
sits next to hooked people and revs chainsaw lmao
---
*Thank You!*
---
Yeah he does, happenes to one survivor when i was playing killer, you get points for kill, cause you didn't technically escape
---
He looks like he came straight out of Pirates of the Caribbean
---
I am SO going to buy that manbun
---
[Backstab Incoming]
---
Offended by teabagging haha
---
FINALLY!  It's been 4 survivors vs 1 killer for too long.  We need 4 killers vs 1 survivor!
---
Let the killers fight each other over who gets to sacrifice the survivor while the survivor tries to escape.
---
That was directed at peanits.
---
Teabagging during a chase can keep the killer on you or make him angry enough to not keep chasing the person who is one hook from death. 
---
Regardless, you should treat others how you want to be treated. If you facecamp, you are making the match unfun for others and have no right to complain when they make it unfun for you.
---
Head on is supposed to have a 3 second activation and activate exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds. It cannot be used while exhausted (the player in this video is). This is clearly a bug with exhaustion and the activation timer. Changing either or both would fix this problem.
---
Snares are good for Map Control/Gen Surveillance.
---
Fake Pallets are good for ending chases/getting hits.
---
It’s a vicious cycle, toxic survivors produce toxic killers and toxic killers produce petty toxic entitled survivors again which then produces toxic campy tunnelly BMing killers and it just keeps going around and around
---
Spirit Furry?
---
Outstanding move.
---
prestige and i use make your choice as my primary way to expose and save tier 3 to down those who loop me or at least are the more skilled survivors for the down
---
Chloe 😭
---
“I come out, and I throw snares *all* over the Map! And then, I start hooking garbage!”
---
    now this is epic
---
We finally get a swimsuit outfit and they cover her up :’(
---
Huh?
---
Did you even read my reply? Are you dense? The wiggle mechanic is not meant for you to escape the grasp of the killer it’s only there to stop the killer from carrying you indefinitely. Stop being a child and grow up the wiggle mechanic is not meant to save survivors it’s meant to save the game. The fact that when you wiggle out it doesn’t stun the killer for longer than 2 seconds shows this because the killer is almost immediately able to knock you down again. 
---
The wiggle mechanic is stop the killer from being able to carry you while chasing another survivor making it impossible for any one to save you, next you will be complaining about the 4% chance of getting off a hook. 
---
You just need to get better at the game. Perks are there to help you not to make you overpowered. Whichever “obstacle” you find the hardest build your perks around that. The fact you say you need 10 perks to counteract all the obstacles baffles me and how little you understand about this game and any other game and just basic common sense in general.
---
Maybe you want to remove killers perks then? Or make the killer unable to use vaults etc. Neither team likes players like you, you don’t understand the game. You are too lazy to figure out how to overcome these obstacles and instead want a cheap and easy way out. Best of luck in life but with an attitude like this I doubt it will ever be much of one.
---
&gt; Teabagging during a chase can keep the killer on you or make him angry enough 
---
So facecamping someone to make him/his team angry enough (because camping seems to trigger survivors aswell) is fine by that logic, too. Thanks.  
---
&gt; Regardless, you should treat others how you want to be treated. 
---
So if someone uses DS and it makes me mad I am also allowed to do something which makes my opponent mad?  
---
&gt; If you facecamp, you are making the match unfun for others 
---
If you cleanse my hex it makes the match unfun for me.  
---
See. This doesn't work.
---
Imagine being the kind of person that watermarks their memes.
---
Oh my bad I forgot once dedicated servers come they are not going to lag switch they are going to dedose the server yea that’s a it
---
Nani?
---
I agree, and I'd also really recommend Monto. He plays really well but most importantly has so much fun with the game and always finds interesting new ways to play it. Hybrid Panda sounds like a really cool guy but he is really bad at the game, I watch him for fun but not to learn anything.
---
Not a fan of the head piece but love the rest of the outfit
---
I watermark it so that if someone reposts it they don’t take all the credit
---
I couldn't walk between the gap of the (meg?) and the bucket of fire even though visibly there should be enough room
---
She’s a babe.
---
STOP TEABAGGING, YOU’RE JUST AN ASSHOLE FOR DOING SO
---
Massive improvement from that trash dress she got last time
---
ugh i love you for this
---
Wait legit? That's dank of its true
---
Ppl have to learn how to play against him but i still think that fake pallets are a very strong power
---
Like I keep having to tell people, those are not real rules.  Most people just play the game to win, not to abide by some silly extra rule set.  Your attitude about extra rlues is just as me-first as the OP post is.
---
She’s not dead, just sort of have to let Arcadia Bay get destroyed but I think she’s ok with that.
---
The nerfs coming, it always does.
---
I mean look at ghost face, he was so unfunctonal and piss weak now he's easily top 5 killers
---
"Oh no they're using Huntress armor. Is that dark be-"
---
The problem is that BM for main survs means "the killer tried to kill us instead of accept that we were going to bully him"
---
imho, there is no reason to stay at the gates at all, when everyone is safe, just leave, don't make the killer lose 2 minutes.
---
And here we are still without the release of the Pig’s cosmetics... 😞
---
that is THE best survivor skin ever
---
Oh no, you bought one of the best killers!
---
Right like I said. A lot of people are saying that the snares are bad because it's not getting them hits like pallets do.
---
I can't really say whether snares actually need a buff or not. As the forced slow vault on windows is quite nice. I'm just saying if they were to buff it I'd rather they have it force a slow vault on pallets as well rather than increasing the slow speed like others suggest.
---
If you think camping &amp; tunneling = being a dick and not game mechanics then your opinion is trash anyways
---
-using his ability “Nightmare”, he is able to place nightsnares
---
*in the tall grass, staying in cloak mode all the game
---
&gt;"Please, Internet people, don't steal my meme. I worked really hard on it, and I don't want anyone to take it and show it to other people, despite that being the literal point of memes."
---
I. NEED. PIG'S. COSMETICS. NOW.
---
Book! Get off the stage *throws churro
---
Whaaa, he's a normal M1 with a timed expose that he can be knocked out of by looking. The hell game are you playing and where can I buy it?
---
Bamboozle. Reminding survivors that to escape a killer, running in circles is not the answer.
---
Kinda disappointed Dwight is purple rarity. At least it’s available with shards
---
I FUCKING HATE SURVIVORS WHI WEAR COSMETICS ESPECIALLY NEA BECAUSE THATS TOXIC AND WHY THE FUCK DO SURVIVORS CLEANSE MY RUIN 24/7 AND FUCK YALL SWEATY HILLBILLY AND NURSE MAINS GHOST-FACE MAINS ARE BETTER BECAUSE WE ARE TEABAG MASTERS THANKS FOR COMING TO MY TED TALK
---
I bought amanda to use surv into my gf, I'm too bad to play as pig, I'll hat tunnel dor sure
---
But didn't you say facecamp can be a tactic? I was responding to that. You don't know what the other person's intentions are, but most players find both actions (facecamping and teabagging) to be toxic. 
---
Cleansing a hex and ds don't hinder your ability to play the game in any way. That hasn't stopped me from being face camped, but apparently that's not toxic to you.
---
Welp, my wallets gonna hurt
---
***Neck***
---
The entity already have enough morsels.
---
Yes I'm still salty, really wanted that perk.
---
“Herman, why are you smiling?”
---
“Oh, sally you poor soul, of course I’m smiling. Internally I am in extreme, unadulterated rage.”
---
Like I said, I haven’t been ignored once. Maybe it’s different on PC.
---
Thank you, great work!!
---
I love this
---
I mean yeah when things are op they deserve nerfs
---
should be hag instead of doc
---
it was worth it
---
&gt; You don't know what the other person's intentions are, but most players find both actions (facecamping and teabagging) to be toxic. 
---
The only difference being that facecamping wouldn't be toxic if you go by the definition of Toxicity in online gaming, while t-bagging would.
---
&gt; Cleansing a hex and ds don't hinder your ability to play the game in any way 
---
So? This has nothing to do with toxicity. The killer trying to secure a kill does not make him toxic.
---
&gt;  apparently that's not toxic to you. 
---
It's not about my opinion. It's about facts.
---
I go by the definition of 'Toxicity' and if you go by that Tunneling and Facecamping would not be toxic, while t-bagging is.
---
This is not a good thing to do tbh because it is a shit idea and very abuse able  no offense op but the system now is decent
---
You ever think about how lag switchers are basically using King Crimson?
---
Hitting you on hook or nodding.
---
I think Billy is fine, but nurse's omega blink and 5 blink needs a mega nerf
---
His stomach looks like he ate the Clown
---
[Yep, it's true](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/571826/#Comment_571826). I'm glad they reverted it; it was the most unnecessary and unwelcome nerf to BP gain they could have made.
---
When Michael levels up I legit do a 180 and scan the whole place, look for the nearest vaultable object(because of lithe). It helps so much playing with headphones.
---
The doctor is a doctor
---
They have to do the drop animation, so yes.
---
This ^^
---
People keep thinking that the goal of this game is kill or escape. Flash news, for you: it's not.
---
The goal is to amuse the Entity, so long chase, multiple hooks and saves, hit the survivors and make them bleed, stun or blind the killers as much as possible, etc. etc.
---
Doing a 4k or escape without doing anything, it's worth nothing
---
I agree mate but as I don’t want to start any religious banter change it with god I’m just looking out for you :)
---
Thats Badham Preschool only lol.
---
Nope but survivor pretty much loops a palletless spot and then stops to drop an illusive pallet. I've seen Monto creating a fake pallet town, pretty much free downs
---
Yeah lets not buff other killers lets nerf the only two viable ones
---
For what
---
IT's THE MANIAC
---
Monto was making them look pretty good, they shut down loops pretty well. They ain't no dream pallets thou :P
---
Of course he does. Why should he care about being respectful, or a nice person, when he can attempt to irritate people online? Clearly it’s a much better use of his time.
---
Found the rank 20 that Devs listen to
---
Saving the best for last
---
Hag I suppose in theory but since her traps aren't physical it can still be played around especially if you have BL or DH. Nurse is notoriously bad on Haddonfield. 
---
I believe I'm correct. I don't think Haddonfield's are widely known but people with a lot of time will/should know them.
---
They are only as strong as survivors are dumb ;)
---
That's just bait at this point.
---
Some people told me that old Freddy was top tier and this rework was a downgrade.
---
I am in fact a rank 3 killer main lmao but Freddy does seem a little up for it not to be tweaked
---
Out of curiosity, what was the Wake Up bug?
---
Weirdly I find devourer of hope good on him without ruin :/
---
The head is great!
---
I get the feeling these are part of the next chapter collection that will be themed around the killer.
---
We need to theory craft who the killer will be based on these leather outfits.
---
Interesting 🤔
---
Breakdown is in the shrine. [Obligatory JoJo reference. ](https://youtu.be/E3SLE19QLEs)

WHEN YOU PLAY AS HER YOU LEARN HER MECHANICS WAY BETTER AND IT BECOME

WICKEDLY EASY TO COUNTER
---
SOURCE RANK 1 SPIRIT
---
Killer complains about wake up exploit, takes weeks, survivors moan about score, fixed instantly.
---
I was gonna fix this, but I see I have been beaten to it.
---
It caused all your action speeds to be buffed by 15% at all times. +15% to healing, repairing, cleansing, etc. Even vaulting was made faster by it. It was a dark few days for killer mains in the red ranks.
---
Dude I don’t even play Kate and now I might have to become a Kate main.
---
He was fundamently bad, the fact that he can't hit people until they are asleep makes it so he s automatically at a disadvantage that shouldn't exist. Of course people can do well with him, but at the same time all he was, was an M1 killer with wallhacks.
---
Dang, she's super cute! Love that set, def gonna get the head &lt;3
---
When my boy Adam gonna get a costume where his head don't look like a bowl of buffalo kettle chips?
---
Oh, +15% compared to normal action speed? Oh boy.
---
there is a heartbeat sound in IDV.
---
The thing is it’s annoying when YOU make a meme just for it to die in new and the very next day someone reposts it and gets in hot. That’s why I watermark it. Not because Im full of myself
---
Self care, after the nerf, it's useless. It takes so much time that, in the same time,  you can basically run half the map, find a survivor and let him cure you and have spare time to start working on a gen
---
That's pretty stupid. Theres no way for me to know which pallet has already been dropped if I haven't been in a chase all game.
---
Oh nice, at least it won't be as bad as wake up
---
Sometimes when the killer gets absolutely wrecked I dont really like to type gg because it could be interpreted as being toxic and truely that wasnt even a good game for the killer
---
I use the Green Dress and Jump Rope a lot it makes them slow as a dry slug without skill checks to fail. I'll pay the extra 0.5s. delay for that. And with SWF buddies swarming the hook when you get someone applying it to all of them is just a benefit.
---
Not to mention if you could apply Sleep in this case to the last 2 survivors they are dead, you slug one and the other one can't go anywhere, there is no hatch there is no way he'll open an exit gate becasue with the jump rope and sleep it'll take near to 1m. to get a gate open (without "Remember Me").
---
I never said it should be nerfed, I said literally that some perks can be broken under certain circumstances and those perks with the data the developers collect, may need changes even if most of the people don't agree.
---
I said that head on, was pretty strong on swf and that MAYBE could be op in a situation like that.
---
I also told you to learn how to read what others wrote, not what you want to read. After that, when I saw that nothing was going to change, I just moved on as I don't want to debate idiocy
---
Nah even then I'm still gonna try and down someone else.. I'm not gonna stand there and not play.
---
I'm talking about how shit ghost face was before his PTB changes when he first went live until they legit fixed him and made him a functioning decent killer with good stealth strats and good map pressure.
---
an innocent, happy-go-lucky country girl to an emo, edge lord
---
Is the update out? I'm out of the loop
---
Yaaa
---
am I being stupid or conversion rate of sharts to blood is irrelevant? It takes way more time to farm 2k shards than it is to get Meg to lvl30, so it will be always optimal choice?
---
Haddonfield is hilarious when you're Trapper
---
Lore-wise it's the killer's "job" to sacrifice survivors to the entity so it can take a fragment of their soul/ feast on their emotions, so it's not really a heavy requirement that you kill all 4. Having 1 survivor escape would give the entity a lot more hope to feed off of aswell.
---
Does it?
---
Boil Over, Unbreakable, Flip Flop and Tenacity with a sabotage toolbox and a Lerys offering.
---
Buff again! Buff again!
---
Screw them
---
The "god" pallet is the pallet in the killer's shack, which, while every other pallet on the map is randomly generated, the pallet in the shack will always spawn there. It's called that because it's generally considered to be the safest pallet in the game to throw down, as the killer will have no choice but to waste time destroying it, since it blocks the doorway and makes it so that the survivor can loop the killer around the shack forever until they break the pallet.
---
It's almost always a bad idea to throw down the god pallet while being chased if it's early into the game, as getting the pallet destroyed early on means there's a higher chance someone will get caught in the shack because the pallet wasn't there to protect themselves with.
---
"Google" isn't a source. There is no official meaning and like you said, "gamers" made it, so it is subject to change overtime due to custom and different games becoming the norm.
---
 I mean, teabagging from halo days used to be crouching over someone's face/body from what I remember. Now people are making it to be just crouching in general. Google it now and the first "definition" you get is what I just said. That would mean that what survivors do wouldn't fit this "definition".
---
I'm not saying camping is always and wrong. Just saying in circumstances where your intentions are up for interpretation like teabagging, you can expect to be met with disdain.
---
Change Sprint Burst to Lithe and it's actually fun. Try to hit the killer with all 4 of them in the game
---
add Solidarity
---
Verify game files
---
I think there was some talk about giving more ways to earn survival points. One person suggested that sabbo could be changed to Survival instead of boldness.
---

Except all killers except Nurse have a artificial skill ceiling, because of the way their powers work. And survivors can get past that ceiling if they're good enough, at which point the killer can't do anything anymore. Killers all rely on survivors making mistakes, it doesn't really matter how skilled you are at them. Sure, mind games exist, but past a point survivors aren't gonna fall for them anymore and they're not intended mechanics anyway. killers have overall simply not enough control over the game, a role that survivors have instead. But, ugh, I'm tired of saying these same points over and over again.
---
Windows of opportunity also works. But ya I think there should be a cooldown on Freddy getting the pallets back. Say 30 seconds or so?

---
You can get offerings to play killers you don't own. Lol
---
Devs might also consider changing that point category over. I heard someone talk about sabbo getting made into a survival point thing
---
AGREED.
---
I think the nose ring ruins it but I am biased against nose rings.
---
My man looks like he’s going to fucking shoot down a school and bang his sister #alabama100
---
It almost never works in chases for me because of the activation time. I'd love for the activation time to be 1.5-2 seconds instead of 3. Might actually be used more.
---
Survivors could definitely use a buff to the survival category. i typically only sabo for dailies, but would still appreciate the change
---
Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Lithe, and Vigil. The 'I want to use the exhaustion perk of my choice as frequently as possible.'
---
Using your power doesn't do anything for emblems. You have to keep survivors from healing and hit a lot of survivors early on in chases, and even then a lot of the time you will somehow miss out in just one category
---
Yes lore wise it’s their job to sacrifice all survivors and kill sacrifice same thing you knew what I meant, but we we’re talking gameplay wise going for a 4K isn’t necessarily greedy that’s my point their just doing their job
---
*Pizza Combo*
---
Yeah something. But if Billy doesnt get a cool down why should freddy?
---
Such a good video. I laughing the whole time with him
---
Happens to me ocassionally. Assuming you bought the game on steam:
---
1) close Dead by Daylight
---
2) right click the game in your library -&gt; Properties
---
3) go to the "Local Files" tab
---
4) click "Verify Integrity of Game Files" and let it go through the process
---
I don't have my computer so Im writing these instructions off memory. Some things might be named slightly different but you get the general idea
---
They can't even stop the longer loops lol
---
Are you fucking serious?
---
Wake up was fixed in like what, 2 weeks?
---
Survivors played for months against Tinkerer 2, Sloppy Butcher Wraith and Infinite Mending Legion.
---
Killer mains are definitely NOT the victims here.
---
I LOST PS PLUS SO NOW I CAN'T PLAY DBD FOR A BIT
---
Yea that 4% hurts, now for some reason when you are leaning on a wall and you hide behind that wall, they stop your power
---
And it was the only improved line by Robert Englund in his entire career as Freddy too. Thanks Dead Meat.
---
Lol who wants DS reworked again?
---
I mean, he was never top tier, but this "bottom of the list" trash comes from people who play him once and get bullied because they play him like an m1 killer.
---
This video really explains the hidden power that freddy has. https://youtu.be/0OgCvfzNyHc
---
*chainsaw noises intensify*
---
Why is breakdown 2700 on Xbox1? Has the top perk always been this way? I’m just not sure because I’ve been unable to buy anything for the longest time due to having a lot of perks.
---
Their time isn't money. Let them waste plenty of it so they can wonder where all the time went when they are older.
---
You didn't tell me that, you told the other person that. If you didn't delete all your comments, you would know that. Also, he probably couldn't read what you wrote because what you wrote made no sense. As in, it was not even English.
---
You said that head on needed the exhaustion nerf because it is op in a swf despite it requiring 2 conditions. You said people use it to "troll" the killer because it stuns you and restarts the chase...which is the point (lol). 
---
I told you to use iron maiden if it's a frequent problem for you and you deleted all your comments.
---
no but the rework is out on the ptb
---
As a newer player, I have escaped from the hook exactly twice.  Both times, i was actually trying to suicide.
---
Yea That's the only little thing why I don't like it. I'm biased against nose rings too lol
---
Groovy
---
It's so perfect it looks fake
---
Janes a chic celebrity not a rocker lmao
---
I only get upset at low points, that's why I don't care for tunneling and camping, less points. If I die idc I just need muh BP
---
Lmao I don't see why it's free 
---
Don't waste pallets like a dick and you'll be fine
---
Billy OP? Lol he’s the fourth best Killer. Hag and Spirit are better than him because they can’t really be turned into an M1 Killer against a decent looper.
---
I am not saying you are supposed to win everytime but when the killer gets 4kills every match and has a bullshit arsenal of perks to lazily help them. It gets stupid. I love games where it is cat and mouse, hu right now it feel like cheetah and tortoise
---
I stopped reading at “the game is heavily weighted in the killer’s favor”
---
Need to add the shitpost flare. I know you're joking, but others might not
---

---
People typically call the one pallet thats inside the Killer shack the god pallet since its incredibly safe when looping since the killer pretty much has to break that pallet once its down.
---
The whole point of ruin is to get the chainsaw snowball going so it's not really a big deal if it gets found.
---
It's the pallet on the killer shack. If you throw it down and the killer doesn't break it , it's 100% safe against all killers except Nurse.
---
&gt;"Your patronising tone actually aggravates me."  
---
Good for you, buddy.  
---
&gt;"You made a big thing out of something basically irrelevant."  
---
If that's how you feel about it, more power to you. Again, however, I enjoyed doing it, and the responses made it worth it.  
---
Your contribution to my personal enjoyment is sufficient, and I'm very proud of you, little guy.
---
That knife is more like a shortsword than a knife.
---
Spine chill, sprint burst, lightweight and whatever you want is my go to.
---
That's the thing. It's not painful to play killer if you play correctly. The people who say it is are stupid and don't know what they are doing
---
Out of the LOOP
---
Once faced a SWF using unbreakable, Breakdown, no mither, dead hard, and sabotage toolboxes. They actually won lol
---
But you still have to drop it eventually. But instead you are just being smacked
---
Every survivor rank 13-20 right there. Solo queue sucks.
---
Oh, pallet looping?
---
Yes
---
THe game is supposed to be balanced, are you really this fucking stupid that you think killers should be stronger than survivors by default? Don't you think that could be kinda boring and detrimental to the game?
---
A god pallet is any pallet that the killer can't mindgame you on. The most common example is in the killer shack, but the two near the bathroom in The Game are also.
---
Imagine trying to police what internet strangers should or shouldnt joke about.
---
Well bugs are not part of balance so can't really say that.
---
But how all of this happened from a simple state? That's amazing.
---
Lol. Nah, totally serious. It's time to show these sweaty killer idiots that the game will no li get out up with their stupidity.
---
Why did this post get removed, is the moderator of this subreddit a killermain too?
---
I do think there should be a perk (maybe an update to Small Game or a Quentin perk) that lets you know what pallets are real or not -shrug-
---
I half agree and I don't
---
Yo what platform were you on?
---
Dead by daylight is in the best state it's been since release and if you can't accept that it shows how little you pay attention to this game. You have no idea easy the game used to be for survivors. I play both sides and I think survivors STILL have it easier. Just play the game, if you lose you lose so what. If you make the most out of your losses you can have an enjoyable experience.
---
Indeed
---
Im the best of the best lmao, for me rank 1 survivors are mostly potatoes, there is a minimal good survivors
---
Freddy won’t be stunned when dropped so don’t really need a slow down. Plus he can see where his pallets of you aren’t to far away  and hear the drop like always
---
The whole of reddit is killer main as is the forum and a Facebook, but that's okay. I won't stop.
---
4 survivors go into the ritual. Only one comes out.
---
Those shoelaces though.
---
Solo survivors deal with the most toxicity. We get all the dumb randoms, the swf that won't help anyone but themselves, and killers taking all the shit out on you cause they assume you are a part of the toxicity when you're just trying to enjoy a game that none of your friends like due to the toxicity.
---
Finally, BHVR added a drop spot to activate Balanced Landing on MacMillan Estate. 
---
And you guys said the devs don't listen. /s
---
It's a 1 vs 4 horror game. The one is supposed to overpower the 4. It's that simple.
---
Im gonna buy him when it comes out
---
1.Urban evasion (yes I know its a joke) to completely avoid confrontation with the killer 2.Spine Chill to tell you the killer is coming so you have a small amount of time to hide
---
3.Stake out (from detective Tapp) use urban evasion to stay near the killers terror radius and gain tokens to use on the generators
---
4.resilience (when injured repair faster) get hooked once and get safely unhooked you will be injured with 9% increased repair speed+great skill check tokens because you were in the killers terror radius while getting chased
---
i'm not 100% sure, but i think when someone reports a post, it gets "removed" until a mod can either clear or confirm it.
---
hopefully someone who can confirm will.... confirm.
---
NINE, TEN, PLEASE DON’T FUCKING NERF HIM AGAIN
---
Yeah most surviors do suck at the game. Most killers don't want to admit they're bad so they try to claim survivors are OP, when that really isn't the case
---
yeah the 1 should be just as powerful as those 4 combined, not any more or less strong dude.
---
Haha I can literally hear it
---
Um it happens to survivors every 2 or 3 matches and has been around over 60 days and it isn't listed under their known bugs so I am making sure nobody forgets and everyone knows. In it's current state it is heavily catered to killers.
---
It's 16 perks vs 4 perks. + the majority of killer perks aren't that great.
---
He'll get nerfed. Ranks 10-20 literally live only by pallet camping so Freddy basically gets a ton of free enduring+fury free hits. People will whine that keeping track of dropped pallets is too hard and they'll make dreamstate harder to enter.
---
I’M TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY DC ON THE LOADING SCREEN WHICH PREVENTS THE MATCH FROM EVEN STARTING
---
... I mean yeah... Most killers ARE just bad at the game, but...
---
There is an inexhaustible supply of things to buy with blood points but you only need so many shards to get what you need. So it really doesn't matter how long it takes to get one versus the other. You amass both resources at the same time while playing normally so it's not like you're sacrificing BP farming time in order to farm shards. People trade shards for blood points all the time simply because they need the points more.
---
&gt; am I being stupid
---
In short, yes.
---
Don't forget that there was an other survivor outline exploit before this one
---
I've made 5 friends from memeing in the endgame chat after the match got cancelled, as killer.
---
I ALSO MAIN KILLER AND ITS OK BUT I STILL GET SALTY
---
So as a killer we shouldn't punish bad play from the survivors?
---
I disagree, I date girls like this, they still like being dominated, just more bratty.
---
"I paid 10 bucks to go in and i will throw all the pallets I find at bing bong boi!"
---
"and stop call our elephant bing bong boi"
---
I don't have a goddamn clue what the hell kind of point you think you're making.
---
FOR FUCK'S SAKE CAN THE SHRINE DROP HALF-DECENT PERKS FOR ONCE? I JUST WANT RUIN AND BBQ SO I DON'T GET MY ASS KICKED AS KILLER.
---
The fact that they don't fix a bug or acknowledge it as a bug doesn't make it a part of the balance or meta.
---
Not that great???? Seriously...
---
Plus the survivors perks are next to useless.
---
I have one soultion Perks are longer teachable so can't be mixed.
---
BHVR have stated that a perfectly balanced game is when two survivors die, and two escape.
---
They arent even as strong. Unless you play nurse with decent perks. Killers as of right now aren't the power role. I have 3,000+ hoirs on dead by daylight. It's super easy for survivors as of right now. I'm not saying nerf them anymore, but I want the lower tier killers buffed.
---
Lord forgive me for what i’m about to do
---
More specifically it’s the most important pallet on the map. It’s generally agreed upon to not use it at the beginning of the game because of how much time it can waste against the killer. Only in case of emergencies should you throw it down. Maybe not even then depending on what point of the game you are in. For instance, if it’s your first chase of the game and you will go down if you don’t throw it, I would suggest not throwing it and just going down. This is because you have more than one hook so it’s okay to go down right now. By leaving the pallet, you just guaranteed someone else a long loop time against the killer when time is more precious (at the end of the game). 
---
TL;DR: Don’t use the god pallet even if it would save you. It wastes so much of the killer’s time that it’s worth it to keep it until the end of the game.
---
You tunnel and face camp to get kills
---
In other words: you're trash that needs to camp and tunnel to ensure kills
---
Down vote me, I don't give a shit, camping makes you a shit human unless it's on a toxic player or when exists are powered
---
Same for tunneling
---
I'm not saying don't camp or tunnel
---
I'm saying that doing it means ur a shit killer unless toxic survivor or gates
---
Fight me
---
PLAY GHOSTFACE AND TEABAG THEM BACK
---
I don't know for sure but I'm pretty confident you're literally talking about Windows of Opportunity
---
You would rather spend 16 hours earning your bloodpoints to spend on one perk when you could get all 3 of her perks in 6 hours. How confusing is it? Spend your time however you want.
---
I wish I oukd enjoy the game more, but getting killed all the time by sweaty killers who abuse the same perks and then get told that they are getting buffed again is kind of a joke. Endgame only made it worse. If the killer closes the Hatch and they have NOED it should not activate is one example.
---
whether a joke or not, this is the kind of attitude that creates such a divide in the community. Never mind that Legion had an exploit just as bad as Wake Up in the same exact time frame and as of now killers have a game breaking bug of basically free aura reading.
---
I think the dream pallets are really powerful and hard to keep track of. But that's not a bad thing. The only thing I'd consider is a very slight sound effect the dream pallets play if you're in the dream and aren't in a chase.
---
Thankfully I zoomed in on her face and lips and now she's in the uncanny valley somewhere between Fergie and a blow-up doll.
---
For anything to do with F13 in DbD. It's not going to happen in the short/medium term.
---
He tries to hide in locker but can't fit.
---
IF THEY DC WHILE LOADING YOU GET ALL YOUR ITEMS BACK INCLUDING OFFERINGS SO YOU DON'T LOOSE DICK-DIDDLEY!
---
Pfft. Drop every pallet on the map on game start. Freddy replaces them for you anyway.
---
It wasn't me. That's for sure. It said a survivor disconnected during loading or something to that extent.
---
I know, but the issues I’m experiencing are pretty big so I was just trying to see if it was just me.
---
They should update the render picture of her profile face atleast.
---
Terrible play.
---
Dont do that, please.
---
Idk why you got a down, WoO is intended to help recognize and remember pallets as long as you are smart and scout the area, good on you, buddy.
---
The latest I had was a game as ghostface, the survivors were pretty organized (probably swf) and it was down to the last gen when I found the last two survivors. Downed one and hooked the other and as soon as i found the last one i hooked her and started running in a circle while crouching. One person called me a rude asshole and the last survivor sent me a friend request.
---
Good thing I didn't buy pig during the sale.
---
That's so sick
---
But it does when it has been happening for so long. Maybe some people dc matches so much because they can't use their perks or escape if they get to the gate. Oh so much fun, especially for SOLO survivors.
---
Maybe? I haven't used the perk before, nor have I seen someone use it with the new rework
---
ELEVEN, TWELVE HE'S GOING TO THE TOP SHELVE
---
Billy shouldnt be able to manually stop once he starts actually running. Gotta hit something to stop.
---
Every other killer actually has to think if its the right time to use their power or not. Not billy tho, 2kool4skool
---
&gt;but i still think that fake pallets are a very strong power
---
They are, and there's nothing wrong with that.
---
Head On's hitbox activates on frame 1 (the moment you press shift+space to get out of the locker). If the killer is within the radius of the move (it's just a little bit smaller than the area that the doors swing through), the killer will be stunned WHEN THE ANIMATION FINISHES. This means a few weird things
---
1) the door doesnt actually have to hit them. As long as they are in range when you initially press space, theyre getting stunned. Ive pressed it right before a nurse blinked and she got stunned like 40 meters away after the blink. It also crashed my game lmao. The only time this rule doesnt apply is if, during the time the perk takes to activate the killer enters an "unstunnable" state (ie, how you cant stun a killer mid picking up a survivor). The game will only use the perk, apply exhaustion to you and a stun to the killer if the stun is "valid".
---
2) the killer can always interrupt headon if they know it is coming. Since the "hey im busting out of a locker" animation MUST complete in order for the killer to get stunned, the killer can react by pressing m1 to catch you. Catching the survivor using headon will ALWAYS stop the killer from getting stunned. This means that the mindgame that a lot of killers do where they dance in and out of stun range to try to get you to come out is useless (it's actually really bad considering the properties of headon that i talked about before. This "dance" actually gives the Jane a free stun if she understands how the timing works). Instead, if you think you are going to get hit with headon, walk up to the locker mashing space and press m1 if you see the doors start to open. This will always grab the survivor.
---
This does put a smile on my face.
---
Self care, dead hard, iron will, adrenaline, balanced landing, sprint burst, poised, prove thyself, bond, aftercare, we'll make it, spine chill, lithe, distortion. I could go on and on.
---
I've seen a shiny Silver Mask For him so far.
---
This actually happened to me yesterday. Playing spirit on lery’s, totem is by a gen they are working on and they ignore it for fear of haunted grounds, mori’d 3 of them and last one escaped, they were pissed with each other in end game
---
r/brokenstreak
---
Spin chill (to tell killer is comming), urban evasion, Distorsion, sprint burst
---
And that happens how often? If you play a low tier killer (even with good perks) your chasing capabilities are trash.
---
Gonna need that to beat the Nightmare Requiem.
---
Report and move on is the best course of action. Venting can help or taking a break. Mean people suck and toxic people are catching up.
---
Well at least I don't see why it shouldn't counter Freddy's pallets
---
She looks like she's that leader of a motorcycle club you don't want to piss off
---
Most killers need these buffs because they are bad. But you do have those killers who are great, and the buffs make them unbeatable...
---
However, 90% of Survivors suck. Badly. The rest are the ones everyone cries about, because they are also good.
---
Thankfully, it's harder to be a good killer then a survior, so just practice loops and infinites. Learn what perks to bring to which map. You'll be bullying people in no time
---
Oh so you're saying UNINTENDED gameplay issues aren't fun? How interesting.
---
There's no reason to not teabag either.
---
Almost all survivors will esacape. If not all of them.
---
So the shack pallet is the god pallet. Due to the shack being a strong place to loop killers. The shack is so strong with a window to fast vault, a pallet sgarp corners and easy to red stain walls its great. Now the pallet is there for when you have no other option. People get mad because the killer will always break the pallet its a strong pallet and a safe one. Safe pallets are pallets that have a very low chance of getting you. People typically dont want to waste the pallet but if you have to you have to.
---
Killers know do to if they see the obsession symbol and they have no obsession based perks. Also with the DS changes if you immediately go after the person just unhooked they'll probably have DS.
---
The fact that moderators have hidden this post only goes to show how killer oriented this place is. If behaviour wanted to have a discussion about this they could have. But instead they thought they could sweep it under the rug.
---
Maybe a different debuff? But you are right, there are other BM behaviors other than tea bagging that are toxic. Like the constantly slashing the hooked victim or constantly dropping the victim while carrying them. Maybe only address the ones that the game recognizes as toxic thru persistent button use. Dropping the victim more than 2 is unnecessary. Slashing the victim on hook more than once as well
---
*hyughhuuhyyyyyhhneck*
---
The Dream Warriors were a group of kids who learned they could give themselves abilities in their dreams to help them stand slightly more of a chance against Freddy. At least I think that’s who the title refers to. I don’t think the actual term is used in the film.
---
“Mains” are what divide this community,
---
Streetwise with a strong ass toolbox with repair speed addons.
---
Prove Thyself to be able to power through gens with another survivor.
---
Stake Out to get stronger skillcheck tokens for repairs.
---
Urban Evasion to avoid killer interactions.
---
Oh, finally a good Jeff outfit
---
They may wanted him to look 'cute' with part of his hand in his sleeve lol
---
So please tell me about Wake Up. Less than a week it got fixed while survivors still for over 60 days deal with 3 bugs wrapped into one and killers can see auras on gen. Please show me how biased you are towards killers. I play both sides evenly. If you don't want this game balanced then you are not part of the solution.
---
I always said it as survivor main, Freddy almost always won games when I played against him. Where are some crazy ass Freddie's who just bounced around the map putting everyone to sleep, making them to blow gens while downing someone and continuing the cycle until everyone is dead, and at best 3 gens are done.
---
there are ways of gaining control without being toxic, like pallet looping, L wall T walls, generally being good at survivor, but tbagging, pallet blinding, and especially post game toxic comments ( which is what this post was actually in reference to ) are unnecessary and only serve to make players look like dicks and ruin the experience of the killer.
---
\*picks mic back up and dusts it off for you\* also you dropped this bro.
---
But do the reports actually reach the Mods of the game?
---
Hahahahaha
---
I was killer chasing an injured Dwight, he stops by Locker and starts pointing at it mid chase. I down him and grab the Claudette in the locker and they both get hooked. I bet that Claudette was pissed cuz I had no idea she was there without the Dwight sandbagging her. Even felt a bit bad, I don’t think she deserved that but meh, I’ll take the 2 for 1 hooks, just doin mah job
---
After playing Trapper on Haddonfield no less. Say what you will about NOED but I don't think you have the right to complain about other people's perk choices when you run the literal most sweatiest build possible.
---
IF YOU ACT LIKE A DOUCHE AND TEABAG I WILL FACE CAMP YOU I DON’T CARE IF IT’S A 1K I WILL GET YOU
---
i have no idea how often that happens. But if you find yourself being overpowered by survivors, perhaps you're better off watching some tutorials and learning a bit.
---
alternatively, you could play survivor every now and then. this may give you insight as to how they work, and how they can be exploited.
---
Spine Chill, Urban evasion, lightweight and probably a good exhaustion perk - Balanced Landing/Sprint Burst/Dead Hard
---
Could swap that out for adrenaline but you're going to get found at least once and having one perk to help you in a chase is a good idea.
---
Other's have suggested distortion to deal with the BBQ aura read but those tokens will disappear immediately - if you're gonna be immersed just get in a locker when you see a teammate get picked up.
---
why did you respond twice? perhaps you should take some time off and relax a bit.
---
You know it's bad when even the fucking *wall* is afraid of Myers.
---
FOUND THE TEABAGGER
---
Okay but stop saying "they should be stronger they're the killer" because that's literally the most moronic shit I keep reading on this sub. The  survivors as a team should be as strong as the killer, right? If not than you're just bad at understsnding balance and definitly a killermain. Also there's plenty more overpowered shit in high ranks that'll get you easy wins as a killer, spirit, hillbilly, ebony mori's etc, stop being one of these phonies who pretends they only ever die to nurse.
---
A D A P T
---
Coming from a killer main, there should be a grievance option for teabagging. It's absolute BS because whenever I get t-bagged for no reason, I neglect the rest of the game just to kill them. I know I shouldn't let it get to me but it's hard not to when you're waiting 10 mins to find a game with that type of behavior.
---
Its the perfect tunnel build
---
EVERYONE'S ON THEIR SECOND HOOK AND NOT A SINGLE GEN IS DONE. RIP OPEN THE EXIT GATES DAILY.
---
very well stated. cheers!
---
because survivors, especially SWF, and ESPECIALLY STREAMERS are super toxic for no reason sometimes.
---
My man pebblelaunch
---
The bias is strong in this one. Having read your other comments in this thread, I gotta say this:  
---
Give it a rest, dude. You're just embarrassing yourself.
---
Ahhhhh thank you so much!
---
With the wraith you can just endlessly bell on em when they’re downed
---
Dude, you broke rule #176 of the survivor code of conduct: Killers cannot run any perks that will help them down survivors
---
Question. Do killers just hate Ace or something because I was leveling ace and trying to get adept and about 80% of the games I got tunneled to hell and back.
---
Yo 950 are still points
---
real bruh moment
---
Wait, SHARDS? Oh thank you devs, I'm a Dwight main, and this is so epic.
---
Never said I only die to nurse. I've died to every killer multiple times. Gens get done insanely fast at high ranks (80sec solo, 44.44 2man etc..) There's too many safe pallets that buy too much time. One survivor shouldnt be running the killer for 3+ gens.
---
I ONLY BOUGHT LEATHERFACE DURING THE SALE BECAUSE I BARELY MISSED BBQ WHEN IT WAS LAST ON THE SHRINE. HE IS SURPRISINGLY ENJOYABLE AND WAS LIKE 2 EUROS ON SALE, IT MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING.
---
I don’t want to! You’re a shiny Pokémon!! Too rare
---
Same honestly
---
I don't play so I'm not biased.
---
I was interested in the bug because I come from a coding background and didn't know it. I'm curious how they fucked it up from a technical point.
---
I'm saying that this is a bug and it should be fixed ASAP, like all bugs that alter the game in a way that the devs did not intend. 
---
When the balance which is the INTENDED gameplay is bad, then you can bitch on it being unfair and unfun.
---
To reiterate: bugs are NOT intended, so it is not surprising that they fuck things up.
---
maybe...
---
The only person that will like you for it is the killer
---
I am devotion 6 and play both sides evenly actually. Get your Pig to rank 3 then talk to me about being bias because my traps and perk have been glitched the whole time. I want the game balanced, nothing more.
---
It could be, mainly because dead people don't count as asleep because it would buff his ability
---
In my first draft it was hag. But doc has fake pallets and hag does not so doc
---
i think it shouldnt have the 3 second cool down
---
it would be way more useful if it was instant with the exhaustion thing still applied
---
that way you could use it in a chase
---
Is there anyway I can post a pic and show you my stats on here?
---
You could use Windows Of Opportunity to clock real pallets while awake and if you notice them while asleep, you can avoid them.
---
bitch you know we tea bagged and got out
---
They reworked it so when you get dropped and picked back up you get a lot of wiggle progression! So when you’re dropped twice and picked back up, your most likely getting out of it :) but I DO agree with combatting toxic players
---
It’s ok now amazingly useful but it can be good against killers that are near you.  The biggest problem is that it isn’t very good in chase unless you are very far from the killer
---
Dear god I need this on nea
---
Just...just throw me a bone or something...I'd prefer a cheeseburger tho...
---
Amazing, where did you get that?
---
I think that snares have the issue of not being punchy and fun like fake pallets. At this point I’d rather lose with current fake pallets than win with buffed snares.
---
I mean getting a hook shoved through you would wake you up, I think this is intentional because I believe they said that you could wake up the same ways you could before worh the addition of the alarm clock
---
Is existing BM?
---
what exactly are you trying to prove? 
---
really, you should just calm down before you give yourself an aneurysm
---
MOAR
---
Yup! I always go for the guy teabagging when I play killer, unless he’s a really good looper, then I’ll go for his bad teammates on the gens lol
---
If you don't play then you can't speak from experience. I have been dealing with game breaking bugs every 2 or 3 matches as a survivor for over 2 months and they don't have them listed under known bugs even tho plenty of people are complaining about it.
---
I think that's why they gave pallets a brown-green addon set, more or less a toggle mode
---
Spine Chill, Prove Thy Self, Poised, and Quick &amp; Quiet are my go to perks for getting gens done and evading the killer.
---
me and my brothers shall rise up, no longer will i stand for this oppression! ;(
---
I am yet to find out if this guy has trouble with the exhaustion debuff
---
You're welcome bud
---
I don't think anyone does, it just still shows up in memes about toxic survivors, which is what this meme is about.
---
I want him in a john wick suit. Everything else doesnt matter.
---
\&gt; getting a meathook shoved through you
---
i sleep
---
\&gt; hearing an alarm clock
---
real shit?
---
Because Survival BP can now be earned based on survival time.
---
I've seen like 8 of these threads crying about the BP gain reduction when you will now get more the longer you stay alive in the trial.
---
Fuckers need to stop cherry-picking which facts they show you. Survival BP got a buff and this was their way to balance it.
---
IT'S GHOSTFACE ALL OVER AGAIN. NO DIGNITY.
---
Sounds neat. I think her base speed would nedd to be a lot slower though and by the end she would be a bit faster than most killers. Perks like NOED and Play with your Food would be really strong on her because of how fast she would be.
---
Aww bitch
---
Had surveillance for a long time but still not in Freddy’s bloodweb:(
---
Awesome! Where can you get these?
---
SEND A MESSAGE TO BEHAVIOR SUPPORT POSSIBLY A FALSE FLAG OR MASS FALSE REPORTS
---
At that point, it'd just be an easy pallet stun though
---
Ah yes, because survivors need a 4th method of waking up.
---
I don't HAVE to speak from experience. All games have bugs. This game isn't different.
---
Bugs SHOULD be fixed. I do not know why they don't fix it. And yes, they suck. But they are NOT part of the balance.
---
Yea but I bet you sweat bullets just to try and black pip at rank 1 while you chill and smoke weed while playing survivor and 2 pipping
---
This is the kind of skin I buy.
---
Kate may become my next survivor to get to Prestige 3 after this.
---
I do not know. I'd like to think they eventually do. I just really want them to enforce people who dc.
---
It is until they are fixed because it is how the game is forcing us to play.
---
they are good at small loops they slow the survivor down just enough to hit them when you wouldnt have reached them before
---
but dream pallets are intended to be way more powerful. its why you need an add on to use them
---
Rise against the p3 Claudettes! Remember, you TOO can blend in with enough blood
---
nurse tier now
---
Because he is the killer with the strongest defense. His chainsaw multi-hit plus tantrum allows him to down multiple survivors in one attack, making it very easy to defend any one location, meaning he lends himself easily to camping and such strategies.
---
I'm not even angry lol.
---
That's not something to be proud of.
---
I'm going to show you my stats.
---
Sure. See it that way. Also works for me.
---
Your last post, from reading the comments, stemmed for Killer perks being too strong and it being too easy to get a 4k. If that is the case, why are only 3 killers considered viable in the highest ranks? Also, DBD is a great game. It has it's balancing issues, but nearly every competitive game does, (For Honor, Smite, LOL). If you don't like it, a boycott for a game you've already purchased means nothing.
---
I think you have reddit confused with an official forum of some kind.
---
Plus a boycott thread seems to be against the rules. It's not censorship if a post violating the rules was deleted.
---
*shrug*
---
That tattoo dirt interface is solid lol
---
Lol i was actually going to do this, how fun if this?
---
Edgy
---
I always thought Kate Denson was the Black Canary. Now I’m sure.
---
p3 quentin is best stealth survivor
---
This just raises new questions, like what is considered balanced? Even with WGLF to even compare to BBQ you need to greedily hit every unhook and mix some risky unhook for protection points, if every survivor ran WGLF, then you'd always end up with 50k~ less than a killer would. So what is this being compared to?
---
Base BP for killers? If it is, then WGLF as well as BP perks for survivors need to be seriously overhauled.
---
Definitely a mistake from Dwight. Luckily, I figured somebody would go for the save at same time. So I guess also a read?
---
You definitely want ruin. Swap MYC for it. By the time youve hit t3 they could finish 3-4 gens, so it's pretty important.
---
*a brown or yellow or green one
---
I don't blame you for doing that I mean there's a reason you're the killer , but these snitching survivors deserve it to be camped at if I am honest.
---
Lmao, dream snares are pretty much worthless. At least dream pallets can actually cut chases down a lot and their mind gaming potential is endless. And they're damn fun/satisfying to pull off.
---
It didn't go against any rules. It was simply a call to action. If people don't agree they didn't need to take part. I plan to take this to the official forums too.
---
yeah but i've had games where it breaks within the first 20 seconds and feels useless
---
Egads a killer might even be able to reliably kill survivors. Must be op
---
Blinky Bill was so fun to watch
---
IT’S ANNOYING TO WAIT IN A LONG ASS KILLER QUEUE JUST TO HAVE THE GAME CANCELED AT THE LAST MINUTE
---
But there’s shards? I mean you get 300 (something like that) per later player level. It would be hard to save up to get a full outfit but buying costume sets individual i.e head, shirt and pants would be possible, I’ve done it. Just sucks for the costumes that you can’t buy with shards or even dlc cosmetics.
---
Wow, how do I do that bloodpoint conversion?

Ok, who the fuck wants to call a boycott over nonexistent balancing issues? You are the epitome of survivor main. If you always get 4ks to the killer, run better perks, learn to play. Don’t get all political and start critiquing BHVR for their game. Their game sold 5 million, which admittedly isn’t as good as other games, but WHO CARES. I don’t rate games based on their amount of plays. 
---
&gt;After the Boycott
---
What boycott?
---
&gt;Help make the game more fun
---
Um yeah I hardly think this one person with such a toxic attitude would make a world of difference to dead by daylight. 
---
But then again:
---
&gt;What can you expect?
---
Right. I just don’t get how people can do that for every game
---
I don’t wanna boycott the game lol, it’s fun.
---
Spine Chill is by far the best for that. I would say Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, maybe Poised?, and Prove Thyself. If not poised then run lightweight. Spine Chill lets you know when the killer is coming to you, urban evasion lets you avoid them, poised lets you yeet out of there after you do a gen, and prove thyself will help you do gens faster if you have a teammate with you. Lightweight is also really good for stealth builds. If I were you I would check out [PainReliever](https://www.youtube.com/user/AaronComplex). He's a rank 1 survivor main and unlike every other rank 1 he doesnt like to loop the killer all game and instead likes to plau it much more stealthy. He has a LOT of good tips and tricks that'll help you counter kills and avoid detection entirely.
---
Do you think you’re the Martin Luther King of DBD? I’m sure everyone who bothered to sign up to the forums *despises* the game.
---
They can be.  It's just that these people seemed completely normal, weren't doing anything toxic in-game, weren't having anything toxic done to them in-game, were getting absolutely shitstomped and were just laughing about it with each other.  Like I said, I expected them to be bitching about the game when I went to their stream and told my friend they weren't bitching at all and were just having a good time.  Then a single GG triggered them to the point of no return.
---
When I play someone streaming on Mixer I like to rewatch the VOD (if they have them enabled - most don't) of when they played against me and a lot of times you get people just talking out of their ass ("Oh he's got an insta-saw" when I'm using brown add-ons, people blaming their loss on Whispers, etc.) and bitching because they fucked up but don't want to say that to their friends.  These people were fucking up, admitting they fucked up and just laughing about it.  Then the killer sends them a GG and they lose their minds.  It's just mind-boggling.
---
... If you get exposed you loop him, stun him and then run to the other side of the map.
---
Fuck off.
---
What speed would you put her base at?
---
As a Kate main...I love this!
---
It's is your opinion to say they are no balancing issues. I disagree with you whole heartedly however. I am both a former rank 1survivor and killer. I know how easy it is to play as the killer. It is the killer comunity that needs to learn to play and stop falling for simple mind tricks.
---
Hate it so much tbh, if you’re playing anything but the nurse you pretty much have no map pressure. My biggest issue with the map is that it’s just way too big to be fun for killers
---
Lightweight is practically worthless. It sounds okay on paper but it's horrible in practice. Barely removes any scratch marks
---
They said that you can't wake up anymore if you are healed from dying state, but they didn't say anything about hooking ...

it's what she deserves
---
That is as false as you can be. The average human reaction time for visual queues is around 250ms, or 1/4 of a second. Go look it up.
---
fair enough. i agree with removing snares. i guess most people are seeing pallet as base skill since it's definitely the better option. the root idea seems scary but maybe during the scream they can only run and not perform actions i.e. vaulting/pallet drop/dead hard? a complete stun might be strong. the fake gens seems interesting, but might be too strong considering 25% of gen time (assuming ruin is in the game) is wasted. but i like the idea as players not also have to remember where the actual gens are, making it more of a memory game.
---
until the killer decides to camp your body
---
CAN SOME OF MY FELLOW SURVIVOR MAINS TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER THAT THE FREDDY WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW WON'T BE THE SAME AS THE ONE WE'LL SEE ON LIVE? I AGREE THAT HE NEEDS SOME TWEAKS BUT THIS IS THE PTB- WE'RE PLAYING IT SO THE DEVS KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE STOCKED UP ON FREDDY ADD-ONS AND ARE PLAYING AROUND WITH RANDOM COMBOS WITHOUT A WORRY ABOUT WASTING THEM, SO A LOT OF THE REALLY STRONG ADD-ON COMBOS WE SEE ON PTB WON'T BE SEEN NEARLY AS OFTEN ON LIVE THANKS TO BLOODWEB DROP RATES.
---
The new freddy has 2 abilities.
---
Ahh I played it and it’s really not great. It needs a ton of work.
---
You need to buy a perk you already have from the shrine. It will tell you that since you already learned perk, it gives you 150 000 bloodpoints instead.
---
Completely useless meme-perk that they released while simutaneiously buffing killers constantly to the point where anything but top-tier perks for survivors will make you look like a gamethrowing douchebag.
---
The idea was fun but why does it trigger exhaustion again? Oh right because else the killermains on reddit would get upset.
---
Overall I love this. Friends to the end is kinda bad, seeing as for all intents and purposes you now need 3 more hook states to win. Hidey Ho is... weird... it seems both broken and terrible. On one hand, a free basement hook is insane... on the other, they need to be in front of a locker, which people dont go for ever. So Idk how youd get it off. But I love your idea for him, if only BHVR had the balls to do it
---
"I have a dream. A dream where survivors actually stand a chance of escaping. Where 4 kills doesn't happen 95% of the time. A game where skill is rewarded and scummy tactics are punished."
---
Sounds good but I don't have the kind of gravitas to pull it off I am afraid.
---
Dat subbreddit is full of game designers as I c1n see.
---
Five blinks is trash and omega blink is fairly rare.
---
Oh. My. Fucking. God.
---
&gt;Mind tricks.
---
BHVR Interactive is a video game company, not an abusive parent. 
---
I refuse to believe that you have been both Rank 1 killer and survivor. If it’s so hard to escape as surv, according to you, HOW THE HELL did you get to RANK 1? I play religiously 50/50 and only scrape purple ranks.
---
Lel u confused bro I agree but in the mind of a survivor the toxicity is how they feel about gaining control meaning they don't even realise they are doing it instead of actually gaining control they feel they still are which in most cases they ain't
---
Keep the mic bro
---
It's not safe! There's a killer on the loose!!!!!¡
---
Oh ok my bad I thought I heard it in the Livestream
---
why use a hand when you could just have her like launch a web at someone?
---
You can't complain your way to win. You are basically saying "how dare the devs make a good perk" Imagine if killers started complaining the same way. *Survivors need to not spin juke anymore , it makes the game hard for me to catch them* *Can you guys stop dropping pallets when i'm trying to get points? thanks* *I just don't think it's fair that you get 3rd person while i'm stuck with shitty 1st person screen* Fun fact, (losing) is also playing the game. You don't always have to win to play / enjoy the game.
---
I can now see your argument for the wiggle and now agree. The 10 perk comment was not to be taken seriously, hence the “lol”. I, like everyone else can  have an opinion (to agree or disagree with as you see fit) which your reply has now changed due to the good explanation you made. I’m not “lazy”, I’ve only played the game for a few months now so I may not be the expert at it and things like this help me to develop the gaps in my knowledge. The last remark wasn’t necessary however it’s not that deep as I don’t know you or care what you think of me. Thank you however for seeing the wiggle mechanic in a different way
---
Bc it means hello in other games I play (Overwatch, Rainbow six siege) I’m not saying I’m right just that I do it lol
---
Surveillance is dope
---
The only thing you’re gonna pull off is your dad. Your posts and comments are literally internet prions.
---
That is a very and I mean very creative interpretation of it. A Boycott is a form of protest to being about change. Not quit the game altogether. The fact that this post is also hidden now only further proves my point.
---
Time to write to the Canadian Media Fund I think. Time to hit behaviour where it really hurts: The Money.
---
so gen rushing
---
It was an attempt at sarcasm you imbicile.

---
250 is not 150, so I am still right. Also, while your brain may receive the stimuli that, it's gonna be a while before your hand reacts, it doesn't matter how fast your brain reacts if your hand is slow.
---
I really appreciate the amount of effort put in to this, great job! That being said, the mothers shrine concept sounds insanely OP and I dont think it would ever really work in the game. Giving literally any killer the ability to teleport to the basement has the potential for a mear guranteed insta-win scenario. Still a cool concept though.
---
i disagree when you say "useful in many situations" useful when you are being chased and hes about to catch your ass, or if going for a basement save. If you aren't actively trying to set it up and revolve your play style around it, it really wont come up often
---
Freddy really only has 2 ablities and a passive part of it. 
---
Both clown and Trapper's system are stronger then Freddys single power, but combined it adds up. 
---
You need to look at the combined power, as a kilelr with more to their power has more power budge in each part.
---
WOULD IF I COULD BUT IM ON CONSOLE AND LITERALLY CANT GET PAST THE CLICK X TO CONTINUE BUTTON.
---
Imagine falling for 360s
---
I think the activation time should be 2 seconds and it should also apply a 1.5 second speed buff when landing a stun. It is an exhaustion perk after all, this would also make it a little more viable for juking and chases.
---
It can be very useful though, but the amount of times I land a stun are few and far between as it can be very tricky to pull off. I've still helped my team escape the basement a whole bunch of times with it.
---
Regardless, this doesn't qualify as fascism. Hyperbole and histrionics only hurt your cause.
---
Because its all LF is really good at, and he the best camper in the game
---
Well he can only place on pallets that aren't there anymore he has to break them first. It takes prep time and luck to get the free hit, you don't know if the survivor will drop it or not, or if any survivor would go anywhere near
---
Good point, I was mainly focusing on what the meme said. That's my bad
---
A dev stream.
---
Some brown addons say they only effect one or the other so I imagine that scenario already exists anyway.
---
It shows you the aura of Freddy's dream pallets. I still use it, though, as it lets me see nearby pallets before I go to sleep, and then when I do fall asleep I know where *not* to run in the direction of, when more pallets just mysteriously appear there.
---
I literally saw the same post from someone else like an hour ago:/
---
Yeah because everyone needs to be spirit-tier good and easy to play or else the killermains will make constant memes about how terrible some killers are, couldn't possibly be that spirit is just a bit overpowered no, every other killer is underpowered and they need to get "rEwoRkEd" (massively buffed). 
---
Meanwhile ebony mori's, irri heads, prayer beads, all untouched, maybe I can beg the reddit killermains to make some memes about it because that's all that BHVR seems to notice.
---
Dude, this is so true! It's honestly annoying seeing people asking for nerfs specially on the Nurse when she's the only instance of the game were the killer is the actual power hole (and even then, she's hard as balls to play, specially on console). It doesn't matter how good you are with Spirit, Billy, Huntress; at a certain point, the game simply doesn't allow you to win.
---
I mean, they are just as potnent as clown gas. While they wont give as much map control as trapper or hag traps, they do reveal survivors to give tracking. 
---
They also slow by 15% lasting for 3 seconds after they leave, and the traps slow for 5 seconds, so it can also be used to block off areas. 
---
I do think the pallets are better, mostly because the pallets are way harder to counter. They aren't inheritly stronger. 
---
The pallets counter..loops. And the Snares are better for Window loops.
---
This was my favorite Nightmare on Elm Street
---
Yeah, the mainstream media is really going to go all guns blazing because Jakeb Luther King can’t win a game of DBD.
---
Thank you!
---
Dude this is great - you can see the sweat shine on her body - if only down the line the graphics or what not can be improved
---
Awesome
---
At the same time, Doctor can also get more illusions out of the power too. 
---
Honestly, i feel like Madness should do way more because it really isn't even noticeable until tier 3.
---
But I love my hope it's my baby
---
WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY IS SO UNDER FUCKING RATED!!! IT SHOWS YOU EASY WAYS TO EVADE OR RUN THE KILLER!!!! IM NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO USE IT but it would be nice of you 😊
---
Apply the same logic to yourself
---
So are Freddy's blood pallets just straight up better versions of The Doctor's illusionary pallets? At least with the doctors pallets they don't lock the survivor in an animation and you can keep running but with Freddy's you're stop and let him catch up to you.
---
I hope this is a shitpost. The music is SUPPOSED to make you feel stressed and scared, thats the entire point.
---
Good to know
---
lol so you admit that what you are doing is insulting. Whatever bud. 
---
Just don't be a hypocrite and complain when a killer remembers and is toxic towards you.
---
Omg its our lord and saviour wosh
---
Can you show me on the doll where spirit touched you? 
---
On another note, if Spirit's are that much of a problem for you, run Iron Will.
---
Unless it comes from a BHVR offical then don't think its real until it comes out.
---
I don't know if that's true. I haven't seen a ton of gameplay, but from what I've seen from one of Monto's videos on the PTB it looks like he's able to place dream pallets wherever a pallet could spawn. It would be a good strategy to place them where real pallets used to be though.
---
Dream Snares don't seem that nice but Dream Pallets are so good!
---
"This one was invented by a freddy"
---
oh, there's one, only one that mentions Dream Snares and not the Dream Pallets, that's the one that makes slow useless but gives you more points when they touch the slows. Keen eye. I missed that.
---

---
All of Spirits perks, most of the Clowns perks were pretty good. Legion had Discorancde which is really good. Thrilling Tremors is pretty useful.
---
gg
---
Killer: Oh thank you! G-
---
ez
---
Killer: oh... :(
---
That’s where I’m placing my bets judging by what happened with ghostface.  He’ll get “hotfixed”
---
They've always been able to do actions while asleep it was always just slower to do so
---
Optimal perks: Surveillance, Discordance, Thrilling Tremors.
---
HE WASTED HIS BPS AT LEAST
---
The timer is short on purpose. It's meant to counter what survivors used to do, which was opening exits and then running out and farming the killer, totems, etc.
---
This was and is still my favourite film...
---
You just made me a happy man 😅
---
For some reason after every update this shit comes up for me i hate it
---
I need this!!
---
YEAH BUT I HAD LITERALLY JUST REACHED RED RANK IM SO TILTED
---
Sorry that’s what I meant, I meant does the obsession have to do that all game? Because that must kinda suck
---
I tried saving a David who was hooked twice before we even hit 5 minutes in the game, and he ends up letting himself die when I was about 3 feet away from me. His death literally stopped the whole momentum we never had. How does this manage to happen?
---
Survivors have always been able to do things while asleep, they just had an action speed debuff, they removed the action speed debuff. However, there's another addon that gives a small action debuff
---
NO DOUBT.
---
Ahh thank you :) I feel a little more educated now
---
Ah shit, now I got a new main
---
I would NEVER sacrifice my dick cheese. Shits too delicious
---
Oh is that so? Well then it's even better, a skillfully placed trap pallet could be amazing. You just gotta steer survivors to them, kinda like a trapper
---
Ye probably does suck and ye he doo
---
Also, spine chill
---
THIRTEEN, FOURTEEN, KEEP CRYING YOU SOYBEANS
---
You can also place them where pallets CAN spawn, so you when you're asleep you have to pay attention to see if you see a pallet that wasn't there before.
---
TRU DAT
---
THE NEW FREDDY REWORK IS SO GOOD, AND I FEEL LIKE HE'S ACTUALLY FUCKING GOOD AND I JUST KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COMPLAIN AND BITCH AND MOAN AND BHVR IS GOING TO GO BACK ON MAKING HIM AN ACTUAL VIABLE KILLER
---
AND IT'S KILLING ME INSIDE, BECAUSE THE POOR GUY HAS BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH, JUST LET HIM SLASH SOME GOD DAMN SURVIVORS IN PEACE, LEAVE THE POOR MAN ALONE, HE GOT FUCKING BURNED TO DEATH FOR CHRISTS SAKE, HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT ALREADY
---
i think “yo. she-bitch. let’s go!” from ash in army of darkness is a little better but this is a close second
---
This is a horrible way of interpreting what I said.
---
It wasn’t too hard, and now ghostface gets revealed while behind walls and survivors are third personing over walls and out of your sight.  Huge nerf.
---
Flip flop pairs better with unbreakable rather than boil over. Personally I’d just like to make an unbreakable, tenacity, flip flop, boil over build to get the achievement for escaping the killers grasp/the occasional meme build than run any of those perks (except for unbreakable which is a great perk) on their own
---
IF IM ABOUT TO GO TO SECOND HOOK STATE, STOP CROUCHING AND UNHOOK ME YOU STUPID FUCKING BLENDETT BITCH! THAT DOESNT MEEN FARM ME W/O BT THO!!!

---
It also shows you the killer’s aura when you’re unhooked which can give a head start to avoid the killer coming at you after being unhooked.
---
No blinding after a pallet is the only way to use a flashlight other than a save.
---
Scratch Mark's last for seven seconds I believe and lightweight paired with lithe and quick and quiet can be pretty gg ez Houdini
---
I FEEL THAT. SOMETIMES YOU JUST GET DICKHEAD KILLERS. LOTS OF KILLERS MAINS ON THIS SUB WON’T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THOUGH

Is that live or.still in test realm
---
i just want to thank you for being the exact human being i expected you to be based on a single comment i read of yours in a thread
---
this comment combined with your flair for that given subreddit gave me such a good portrait of who you are as a person and being able to look at your comment history and be 100% correct brings me no greater joy
---
i truly just enjoy so much being able to know that people like you exist and are simply the most predictable entities on the internet
---
thank you for your service
---
Hot goth Kate
---
I want to know more about the golden perk. What's that Surveillance got that my Surveillance doesn't? &gt;:(
---
My P3 level 50 Freddy can finally be of some use :')
---
well, im gonna enjoy it while it lasts.
---
it cancels
---
You're using it against your girlfriend?
---
i would pay to have things like "crouching 3 times in a row causes exaustion" or "crouching 3 times at the exit gates blocks it for you for 10 seconds"
---
I feel you shouldn’t knock off Adam, deliverance is a great perk and diversion is a really fun perk even if it isn’t really ‘strong’
---
I approve of this DS9 meme
---
I wonder if it's a bug or indended
---
GF is my gf, só I guess yes
---
Op since you also used blender can i ask how did u correct the fingers of Ace? i always get aces fingers goign crazy when i port animation i have to manually correct them..
---
Nice bait
---
You never know, maybe that firstful of knives is laced wit fast acting sedatives
---
well technically none of these players are high rank. and full perks are unlocked with like character level 15? thats like 50k bloodpoints. so spend em on your huntress and you will have full perks slots too :)
---
TEAM REFUSES TO HEAL AGAINST A SPIRIT. BEST PART IS [THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE FUCKING ADRENALINE.](/intensifies) WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS EXPECTING TO HAPPEN? DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO 4 GENS AND OPEN THE EXIT GATE AND NEVER GET FOUND BY THE FUCKING SPIRIT?
---
there are currently not many rank 20 survivors because the season is almost done. on july 13th you should find better matches
---
Can the words 'Ghostface' and 'good map pressure' even be used in the same sentence?
---
I normally don't camp or tunnel unless a survivor is being toxic and toxic to me is someone who tbags after every pallet and uses a flashlight whenever I break the pallet.
---
So basically every Claudette after rank 15
---
Nothing is established yet but so far I feel that dream pallets are much more useful than the slowdowns. As far as I know you can't tell if the pallet is real or not when asleep. I also just think it's really cool how survivors can interact with them whereas Doc's illusions simply vanish and he giggles at you.
---
You are correct, some Killers get one ability, some two abilities, some three, and some zero. 
---
Welcome to the game made by the most blind, unaware and incompetent game design team on the planet. If you're wondering if DBD's success was a fluke on BHVR's part, just know it's certainly not a success due to their skill as game designers.

[Slight edit](https://i.imgur.com/oDYotns.png)

OH THEN IT WAS DEFINETLY A FALSE FLAG LOL YOU KNOW THE CONSOLE PLAYERBASE
---
Didn't do totems gamer lmao
---
There's FIVE totems... It is not that hard to take them out - with friends anyways. However, survivors do need some way to know how many totems are left imo. Doing 3 totems and then dying to Noed cause the other 3 people on your team can't do 2... It's getting kinda old.
---
This isn't a nightmare... It's a dream come true!
---
Quality post lmao
---
I WOULD BUT I HAVE NO MONEY AT THE MOMENT.
---
Every ptb should start all players with Max bp so players can buy all the new addons and perks to test them so bhvr can effectively get feedback

I can tell you on PS4 this game runs barely on 30FPS it's a disease there!

This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.  
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.

Be careful, friends!
---
Legion is pretty much the most purge like thing ever
---
if he’s not better than nurse, or just broken, he does not deserve nerfs
---
Yea and he can never come out of the locker either
---
This thread has 900 upvotes with the sole message that you shouldn't tea bag unless the killer is being toxic. Clearly the community doesn't support mindlessly butt dancing without provocation. While you seem to interpret their teabagging as "good game", the majority of survivors are trying to insult you.
---
I'm glad it doesn't seem to bother you but the majority of players in this game don't seem to think the way you do.
---
This is fake I remember it was posted on this sub a while back even before we had speculation to think stranger things was coming to dbd
---
It's a relic from when there were three Killers, no teachable perks and no way to increase your ability to track survivors.
---
Not top tier, but decent and fun to play!
---
&gt; Killer is then able to exit the locker (1 second animation).
---
Well yea he can
---
Nurse cant teleport to gens, and if your going by that logic: 
---
LF is a copy of Billy since they both use chain saws. 
---
GF is a copy of Myers as they both stalk and instadown. 
---
Hag is a copy of Trapper as they both place traps. She is also a copy of Nurse since they both teleport. 
---
Clown is a copy of Huntress since they both throw things from a range. 
---
This logic and argument is entreily dumb.
---
Considering queue times to find match as a killer, I think game struggles to find opponents of same skill and ping.  
---
As for the dickheads with "gg ez, l2p, etc", well, there is always a small(90% in my case :) ) chance to get little troll out of 4 survivors, who just wants your angry reaction, no matter if you did good or bad. Just ignore them
---
PS. Im new player too.
---
Kate a basic country white girl and now she has a rocker outfit
---
Thats a problem with the shitty Macthmaking of DBD sadly.
---
The fact that they were all running adrenaline and hope and talk about killer using an end game perk. Lmfaoo
---
Bullshit. Survivors would love to fight more than just Nurse/Spirit/Billy.
---
To a rank 20 newbie, yes, they are pretty much the same as high rank players. The skill gap can be quite enormous between a purple survivor and a completely new killer.
---
As for the perks, don't pretend you don't see the problem. It doesn't take a long time or much bloodpoints to get a full perk loadout but it takes far longer to get an actual build of decent rank 2-3 perks. He could be level 15 with only Territorial Imperative, Distressing, Monstrous Shrine and Thrill of the Hunt and you know damn well that full loadout wouldn't equal what I see here: dead hard, adrenaline, self-care, decisive, sprint burst and all.
---
Even if he had 4 perks, he would not be on the same level as these players, skill-wise or hard stat-wise. Matchmaking is fucked and it's putting him in some pretty desperate scenarios a new player isn't very likely to enjoy.
---
But what if he was more purgeier
---
Sorta sounds like the Future Dwight post from a couple days ago (the concept of a locker based killer at least)
---
Hes a rank 20 paired with a green and purple rank and a yellow ranks. They are high compared to him.
---
We were just talking about this last night! It'd be awesome to have a killer that can hide in lockers.
---
but whats the point, we're locked into the animation so the blind just makes us mad rather than helping you cause we still know where you went
---
Ohh yeahh
---
No, i told myself no more having crushes on game characters...why do you make it harder for me ;-; (im a girl ;-;-;-;-;-;)

I think having one Gen color perk is good, Survialnce, Discorance, so on, since he can use his teleport. 
---
So far, I think the pallets are only sightly better but thats cause the traps take time to use. 
---
Survivors who dont wake up are just dumb like Plague. Never waking up lets freddy teleport nearly every 10 seconds anywhere he wants.
---
BIT RANDOM THAT I WAS ALLOTTED 17 DAYS
---
Amazing
---
It's intended. They had mentioned it in the reveal stream.

You literally just listed off his entire power and complained about every strength in his kit lol.  That’s the whole point of doctor my dude, and he isn’t exactly a high tier killer either so you’re probably better off learning how to counter him and play against him than waiting for BHVR to delete him.  Cheers.
---
I think the lobby was 3 players vs 2 killers fron the start
---
Woah is this the chase music?
---
Nope he picks one locker and never leaves, his favorite food is lil Dwights
---
i think lightweight and dance with me are good
---
The best face for nea i think its the p3 version they should put blood on her face cuz the hair is cool but that face omg is disgusting
---
**Yeah, and Clown is a child between Doctor and Huntress.** 
---
Hag is like trapper but she  can teleport to traps instead of capturing people in them.
---
Without a pointer thing?? Guesstimate??? Are you playing on console or something? Its the fucking MIDDLE OF YOUR SCREEN LOL. People even know to RUN AT HIM to get a long enough look to break him out and loop him as a shitty m1 killer, he’s honestly not hard at all to go against unless the player is really good at sneaking up.
---
im not asking for them to delete him i just dont find him fun to play against, also how do i counter not screaming.
---
Reporst
---
Can’t these get banned by EAC?
---
This isn’t always true. If someone is using an obsession perk, an obsession will randomly be chosen, but it doesn’t mean the person using decisive will have it, especially with how it is designed now (turning you into the obsession when you DS). My swf group, two of my friends use DS, and in nearly every game, myself and my other friend who never use DS are always the obsessions. It’s rare if they start as the obsession. It’s rare even out of SWF to see someone start as the obsession who has DS. I believe they changed it after they changed DS, since DS now says it only increases your chances of becoming the obsession.
---
the real problem is, that the season is almost over, so it's almost impossible for rank 20 killers to find 4 survivors with the same rank
---
Ah yes, I remember the days survivors complained about The Doctor. We rarely see that anymore because BHVR added stuff that’s way worse.
---
I'm abit out of the loop. Did the rework actually happen yet?
---
fair enough, still dont find him fun to play against though
---
I always thought that it happens because of SWF parties with gap in ranks.
---
It depends on the situation, but if doctor is trying to catch you at a loop by making you scream sometimes it’s just best to abandon the loop and get out of his shock range if there is another loop close or faking out a vault etc.  Also if we’re talking pallets, sometimes it’s better to drop pallets a bit early similarly to playing against clown.
---
Nice gaymer meme!!!
---
Shit I've seen so many slurs in this games chat I can't keep track lol it's sad. So probably!
---
Real damn fun.
---
Yup. I had to do it the longer way too until the guy I linked uploaded a condensed method. It was enough to make me not play a couple times lol.
---
Honestly I think the entity likes me because I feel like it's much more
---
Everyone’s got their own killer they hate playing against. For me, it’s Spirits that use sound whoring headsets. Literally no counter if you didn’t bring the right perks.
---
Honestly all they need to be good is for them to auto-reset after use after like 5 seconds or something, that and additional 5% slowdown. If they did that they would be amazing. As is now they're use application is limited.
---
Yea i didn't really clarify that in the post, but an option to enter a locker would be cool too lol
---
Freddy will Game end so many survs now.
---
this video
---
no you just do not change it as the game is running
---
Cry the fuck more. You acted like a shithead and got voted accordingly.
---
I've seen a lot of people running Iron Maiden lately
---
&gt;An additional problem with that is that usually one side will perceive something as "toxic" even though it isn't.
---
&gt;It's worse if you face survivors.
---
hmm.
---
every start is rough, but he will get there. sure theres one purple player in there but he could have had it much worse imo. dbd doesnt have a HUGE playerbase so you gotta have to deal with some wider matchmaking.
---
fair enough, but im too *shocked* by Jane being a fat ho and not vaulting i know hes not a good killer im just bad against him cos he requires reaction time and im really slow thanks for giving me tips tho.
---
I did when he was on sale the other week just for this
---
the hit probably registered on the survivor being unhooked, and not the person doing the unhooking.
---
Yes.
---
Nope.
---
Please no, those films are all trash, I'd rather keep that influence away from this game, thanks.
---
From so many good horror classics you could have mentioned the one that came to mind was The Purge? Really?
---
This is a late reply because i just found it lol. But when i play pig i do hit someone who tries to take it off, but i also go after the other survivors not just the player trying to remove their trap.
---
I'm just not a big fan of the super angry look she has
---
With Trauma I don’t think the Survivor should become completely blind it should at least cause some other status effect, with Dark Hope it shouldn’t be that long of a delay until the hatch opens it could be something like 15/20/25 something not so overpowered and other than that everything else seems pretty Ok
---
Try a billy with spirit fury, enduring, ruin and BBQ. Then tell me if you "sweat bullets". I'm not saying it's easy, obviously at high rank have to be challenging but if you are a decent killer you are going to do a lot of good games. Btw don't expect to arrive rank 1 if you have 100 house a few perks and weak builds. Anyways as I often say the problem in this community  is that everyone thinks he is a pro player, and everytime loses starts to blame the players, the game mechanics, the teammates, and the most creatives ones starts to suggest big nerfs on Reddit.
---
Watch out, there's this weird bug where if you drop your pallets, and Freddy replaces them, they don't work. Hopefully it should be fixed by the time it goes to live.
---
Of course.  To be honest I actually usually enjoy playing against doctors because it’s different
---
can we stop posting this
---
Lmao maybe my dude itd be dope
---
I want this.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbk8y7/new_sp_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This is almost exactly what happens when my wife and i play. we tend to do very little talking, most of the time just focusing on what we're doing, or talking about our days.
---
Happened on PS4, when I loaded into the map, the map introduction never went away and I did not see anything HUD related. Perks, cooldowns, gen bar progress, skill checks (only the sound was there).
---
I tapped every gen because it was literally impossible to hit "invisible" skill check.
---
A while back you could hit the survivor on the hook while they were being unhooked and it would down them as soon as they were free to move. Devs decided to get rid of that and now you can't hurt them until they are able to move their character (you still have to wait like 1 second after that) but the 200iq devs decided to still allow the people on the hook to be hit even though it wont hurt them. I can't tell you how many times I have tried to hit the person making the rescue, and it should have downed them, but instead somehow magically managed to hit the person on the hook and because they can't take damage both survivors get away. Devs should make it so if you are close to the hook you swing though the person on the hook so they cant absorb hits that you obviously weren't aiming for.
---
Just to let y'all know that doctor has fake pallets with the right add ons
---
Damn.
---
That may be true, but what you didn't factor in is how long it takes to get 2000 shards, you need 4-6 games to level up and those only give 300 shards per level up (towards the middle and end of devotion anyways) assuming you only make 20k a game (no perks) you'll have made ~500,000-600,000 bp.  (basically a million if you run wglf or BBQ)  which gives you significant progress (spent well 1,000,000 can get you past 40) so in regards to time spent you would be better off spending BP than shards.
---
In fact, the way I'm using it is specifically how they said to use it.
---
You should be able to get a grab if you time it right.
---
I feel like this is a lost cause. We probably don’t have any experience in managing a company so we are pulling shit out of our asses.
---
I main Trapper, dont underestimate those bear traps. ;)
---
True. They aren't very high ranked but as a new rank 20 player, they've played the game a lot more and have much more understanding of the game than I do. There is still quite a skill gap. Maybe high rank wasn't the right term but the game gets kind of frustrating with such a skill gap, I see your point though.
---
It's just personally for me I'd rather be having fun playing against my own skill rank than being forced to brutally learn quickly. I understand where you're coming from, stuff is kind of rough with a smaller player base.
---
i think they should just make the time to leave the trial shorter like a minute less since the main idea of endgame is to make survivors leave
---
oof. I hate that. Same shit happens when I play against the doctor. 
---
GAME BREAKING
---
The hair reminds me of Gargamel.  🤮
---
For me it’s in between. Like we are fucking around but somebody’s gonna die or we have to get the gens done or we all die we do get really coordinated.
---
I think he gas nice feet
---
It’s one of my friends...
---
900 hours, all perks that you'd want on all killers 
---
Gotten rank 1 most every season (Sometimes I don't play long enough to rank up because other games)
---
The game mechanics are shit, the SWF is shit, survivors should be always one down and hiding should be more of a gameplay. 
---
If they added a realism queue and double / triple bloodpoints for survivors I guarentee people would queue it
---
First of all calm spirit will stop the sound of the scream so you cant be revealed be him just walking around. As for the screaming at loops the doctor has to slow down and charge his shock and then after shooting it he has to change back to melee form and then swing. When he is charging his shock just keep looping, the slow he gets from charging will be enough for you to get 1 more loop off.
---
When i run a flash ligjt and blind a killer at a pallet they typically lose me for a few seconds because of the blind.
---
I can already tell how awful the hair's gonna look in game...
---
I agree that Killers get more targeted toxicity but I personally think Survivors have the chance of dealing with more toxicity. We have to deal with random survivors and the killer at the same time.
---
That being said SwF can be extremely toxic and I do feel bad for the killers who have to deal with that and I try not to play with friends who do things like t-bag and whine at the end for killers just playing the game.
---
A third of a second is 333ms. That's how much slower it is than it should be. They promised a ~150ms buff but made a ~150ms nerf. Therefore, it is a very noticable improvement. Even then, the 150ms nerf was noticable by many, including me.
---
Get off stage
---
There’s a difference tho, people are complaining cuz doctors pallets disappear when you get to them. Freddy’s dream pallets don’t. They’re better but there’s definitely ways to counter them.
---
New Freddy doesn't need a nerf. At most maybe number tweaks but he's been out for only a day so that's still not really a issue. Everything about him got better, and all the animations he got are amazing. I saw that gen teleport shit and instantly knew that was going to scare the shit out of people seeing Fred pull himself out of the blood like that. But I'mma be real, I see more people complaining about supposed survivor complaints... Than actual complaints that he's op.
---
Nerfs aren't coming, the only killers you can say got truly gutted were Freddy before his rework. And Legion. Everyone else got either minor nerfs, buffs, or in Ghostface's case, fixed (partially) he's better now.
---
Here's hoping Legion will be next on the rework list considering if this is what comes from them, I'd love to see what they could turn my boy into.
---
Seems like the only solution is SWF voice-comms
---
i normally scout around the area of the hooked survivor but i feel like facecamping  is bad, i’ll facecamp if the survivor was toxic and annoying
---
What is lol? Lmao.
---
Did you just call the movie your dissing a “Horror Classic?” You do realize that Legion basically is the purge right? Group of people hellbent on killing innocent people for sadistic reasons. Group of teenagers killing innocent people for sadistic reasons and peer pressure. Not that different. The character designs are also very similar. Expect Joey.

---
&gt; With Trauma I don’t think the Survivor should become completely blind it should at least cause some other status effect
---
You mean its OP?
---
I'd rather face a Killer using Trauma than something like Spirit fury. But maybe 2 second is a bit long. 0.5/1/1.5 may be better.
---
&gt; The killer shouldn’t be able to teleport to a locker near a survivor, the killer should be able to select a locker to teleport to by looking at it
---
I believe that would be weak compared to the power of other killers.
---
Jesus they just buffed the entire killer with an awesome rework and you guys are STILL fuckin whining lmao ungrateful little shits arent ya?
---
Have an upvote because im legit so worries about this. It’s funny, Freddy was nerfed so hard at launch because of over reaction. Two years later we finally get the rework and now we’re all worried he will be nerfed again for the same reason. I get it that dream pallets are tough, but I really hope the devs/10-20 ranked survivors understand there is a TON that goes into it more than that. Work the gens, don’t get caught in the first place, remember where the pallets are/aren’t, remember which have been broken during YOUR chase, etc. Guess we will see.
---
He’s thinking Claudette looks like a snack... literally
---
But it makes it so the killer cant see you? When I blind at a pallet, I crouch and hide behind the nearest thing and they almost never find me.
---
Well now is my time to only use Dwight
---
Why did they remove the Ghostface DLC music? I really liked the diversity of themes that we have to listen to while waiting so damn long for lobbies.
---
Imagine believing this was real for even a second. All of these are obviously fake. It's just a fun little fan concept.
---
Ok as a red rank console killer main I can say that the top happens 60 percent of the time why? Because it’s impossible to know if people are a swf if they are chill
---
/s?
---
she a whole meal...
---
"Mom said it's my turn to play dbd"
---
https://youtu.be/_ypdDN388Xg
---
If I’m a killer I give myself rules if someone decides to be a jackass and try and cheat I will leave that person alone and go after the other guys if they dc after going down at the start of the match I’m gonna give em the game or farm with em
---
It’s fine how it is. First to find the hatch first wins. That’s how it should’ve always been
---
yes! i’ve been experiencing that with myers, especially on an indoor map like the game, all i can hear is THUNK THUNK THUNK
---
Omg 😂😂😂
---
&gt; Infectious Fright on Nurse is great
---
More than great, i see no reason not to run it, Nurse is the one killer who benefits from this perk the most, i can turn 1 down into 2 hooks easily thanks to this perk + Deerstalker :)
---
I also run this perk on Myers combined with M&amp;A and Dead Rabbit = i can see the screaming survivor notifications so so far away and snowball em all down as long as they're not god tier loopers.
---
It released like 2 days ago. And it’s Behavior. I wouldn’t put to much money on it being you. It’s definitely just a glitch or you have your ringer off and you’re stupid lol.
---
The Demogorgon is literally the face of Stranger Things. It even got added in Fortnite which is way more popular than DbD will ever be.
---
Yeah same or if the gates are open and I need a kill lol but other then that it’s just annoying
---
I really wish they would just make WGLF a lot easier. Whenever I play killer I more often than not get 25k+ points each match and 4 stacks on BBQ. With survivor, I rarely get above 20k and boy do I have to go FAR out of my way to get 4 stacks to WGLF, I have to really risk it and make what is technically bad choices for my win condition to get them. While I as killer just play the game and I get my 4 stack without putting any thought into it, without going out of my way to get it done. Bleh :V
---
Doesn't really matter how long it takes if you get both resources (shards and points) simply as a byproduct of playing and you end up with too much of one ressource (shards) and not enough of another (bloodpoints). I don't know why you would bring up the time it takes to rack up 2000 shards like anyone is ever actively farming shards. That's just not a thing. You play the game enough and you'll eventually trade them in for points unless you like shitty recolored cosmetics.
---
YES
---
That's great, because yeah that was a terrible change
---
Dude wtf... I was calling the Purge films the exact opposite of "classic", lol. All if not most of them are pretty bad horror films with a dumb story.
---
And yes, I know that Legion draws inspiration from these filmes (and maybe a few other similiar films too), this isn't new to me. It's why I don't even play as Legion and actually think that he's the worst/most uninteresting DLC killer they've released to far.
---
They killed one person (mainly frank, on a reflex action) while vandalizing a place. I don’t think they’re really that purge-seque lol
---
I doubt it's true.  The character bio is really bashed out. Only the perk icons are plausibles.  I believe we're getting a Stranger Things chapter tho.
---
Well *now* they are killing a lot of people.
---
It's in the test server
---
You disagree, or what are you trying to say?  
---
Survivors have more 'tools' when it comes to things that could perceived as toxic.  
---
Besides Ghostface and maybe Pig killers could just slap you, moonwalk and nod.
---
Rank 20 here, I’m very confused about this. Is there a context where it’s ok to heal right after you’ve been unhooked? I always just run bc I’m scared lol
---
what happened to ghost face? I was gone for like 5 days...
---
I mean yeah but so are literally all the other killers in the game lol but it’s not even in a similar context. The lore implies many of them are being manipulated by the entity to keep killing or they are tortured, so it’s not really out of sadistic joy or anything like in the purge films lol
---
Thank you for the meal
---
They always do that at mid-chapter. You can still hear the theme before getting into a lobby, by selecting Ghostface.
---
I’m pretty sure this is not how you use this format
---
Ok yeah now that I’ve reread that last sentence you’re right. Like reread it and you’ll get what I’m saying here. Cant argue with that. Legion is really bad.
---
Several of the purple cosmetics are available with shards (that's how I got my beautiful black wedding nurse) and are an easy reason to save shards for, I brought it up because in comparison by the time you earn that many shards, you could use just level them up and pick up all 3 teachables instead of only getting the one.
---
I tunneled. I camped. I slugged the last survivor and closed the hatch in front of him. I typed GGEZ in endgame chat. But the most damning thing of all: I think I can live with it. And if I had to do it all over again, I would. Leatherface was right about one thing: the self respect of a single Killer is a small price to pay for a 4K against a toxic SWF. So I will learn to live with it. Because I can live with it. I *can* live with it.
---
Swap dying light with something else. Having it and PWYF is kind of bad. You can't use them both to their full potential like that. Run it with STBFL or something.
---
nerf NOED pls
---
That's not the case; it was planned from very early on. When the changes were first prototyped, hitting survivors would not pull them into the dream world. We decided very early on to add that in. Naturally for us, we eventually took it for granted. During the stream, it was not mentioned because to us, that's just how Freddy worked.
---
We realized after the stream that it was an important detail and we didn't mention it, so we did our best to clarify that. It was already in at the time (you can catch glimpses of it in the gameplay shown in the stream).
---
They do tho 🤔🤔🤔
---
Lol I was gonna say right, till he chainsaw snipes you across the map.
---
I will reiterate what I do every time. Is this killer stronger than nurse? If yes, nerf if needed. If no, it’s all good. 
---
New Freddy still ain’t better than nurse.
---
True, but look at how many games sell cosmetics. They're relatively quick and easy to make and take few resources away from other teams.
---
Some of the killers love the hunt. Namely, Doc, Wraith, and Clown. Doc and Wraith had their powers gifted. Clown is just fucking weird lol.
---
Hell yeah. Campy, but still great. And that Dokken title track is amazing.
---
Dude I noticed that too, hes so thicc
---
Wait are you agreeing with me now? Cause what I’m trying to say. That Behavior should spend more on the coders than the skins.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DioxNMpQdzM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DioxNMpQdzM) 
---
here's a comparison of with or without lightweight
---
More made up rules to make games easier for survivors.. nice .
---
I’d argue the trapper loves it. The wraith also canonically killed one dude (unless you count the others he didn’t even know where there, which would be stupid). All of the killers had abilities gifted. Idk, I never liked the premise of the purge in the first place, and the game is nothing like it. I think it’s more interesting as a concept for an all powerful supernatural entity manipulating individuals in a dimension of its own creation to feed off of the energy. Way more interesting than no laws for a day tbh
---
They must be bad then because literally every time I get blinded I find it absolutely trivial to continue to track the survivor by sound alone for those few brief seconds.
---
Oh...thank you for letting me know!!
---
got my totem, did you? oh no...whatever shall I do ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That watermark is really easy to crop out though
---
Ruin, NOED &amp; Devour Hope.
---
Don't bother looking for ruin, just learn to hit the skillchecks, cleanse it if you find it though. 
---
For NOED you wanna cleanse some dulls as you go along and check the ones you left up after last gen is done.
---
For D-Hope you really gotta find it if activates.
---
Oh yeah. DBD’s Trials are  way better than the Purge. Well Trapper’s skin is fucked because he was tortured because of his undying loyalty to his father. Even though he killed him? Idk the lore is fucked. Anyway, I don’t know if it’s Agitation or his lore that says he is fueled by hatred, like Jason.
---
i do terrible with the spirit.  must be doing something wrong.   my wraith is 100 times better than my spirit
---
Lmao nice flair btw
---
I think its still aight not the greatest but you cant lie it can get results even if it dont work on the best you can still fool the average
---
 "-now lastly i hate how when you are screaming you cant do **ANYTHING** and the screams last so long, sometimes i try to drop down a pallet or vault, but instead i end up screaming in game and irl when i wonder why jane isnt vaulting the window as the killer puts me down. "
---
That's basically his only power, and it is so inconsistent &amp; buggy to begin with. Doctor is dogshit.
---
Yea it’s fucked up how seriously people take this game
---
Yeah, most of the killers were tortured to make their appearances look the way they do. A lot of their backstories had tragic aspects to them to give reason for the entity to find control in them, except for, like, ghost face who is just a bassard.
---
You're like a little kid over Xbox live that realized they can't win an argument they started so they say they're just doing it for personal enjoyment so they can seem big. Oh man you're so hardcore dude
---
That’s kinda what it is inherently
---
"Two killers are broken so no one else can get minor buffs"

Legion is a copy of billy because he is fast, pig is a copy of wraith because she can kill her terror radius, spirit is a copy of nurse and billy because she can run fast and “teleport”, etc etc etc......
---
Preach
---
Right. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Oh well.
---
Are you kidding? The killer already gets more than survivors anyways and a majority of killers run BBQ and Chilli.
---
If anything survivors need a very slight increase to their BP gain. It can take like 3 times as long to level crap up as a survivor.
---
Wrong Jazz. I don’t bring items most of the time, I play Quentin about 97% of games, my Claudette is bright pink (not blendette) and I’ve used her maybe twice in the last month. Also don’t play SWF at all.
---
You don’t sound like the type of person that would be worth remembering though to be fair.
---
I believe haunted grounds is a bit more frequent than devour hope.
---
Or your just bad and need crutches to play.
---
He killed 3 while standing to hooked one?
---
Agreed 100%.
---
More like me yelling at my rank 20 friends to get out of the fucking locker and do a gen
---
Imagine playing Old Freddy for so long and knowing how to do well With him in any rank against any survivors.
---
You learned all the small details and watched every vid there is.
---
And it is now all gone and people are like "it is fine he was shit before"
---
He was not and it really hurts losing my favorite killer.
---
Edgy teenaging gone wrong... such a strong and interesting lore, am I right?
---
Nice one kid. Talk about what you know, right?

so funny lmao

Release day her hair will be shorter.

Lol I love the new Freddy, I could easily get 4ks with the old Freddy and this just makes it easier

I AM SICK OF HAVING SURVIVOR GAMES RUINED BECAUSE A KILLER IS IN THEIR SMELLY BASEMENT ON THEIR COMCAST MCDONALDS WIFI HITTING PEOPLE ACROSS THE MAP.

Pc only?

Oh my god! Amazing

oooo looking hot

on all of the survivors he just sttod there and revved his chainsaw

PC survivors have a 70% escape rate OMEGALUL
---
what's funny is he had one of the strongest end game potentials, but now he becomes literally 100% powerless at end game. No gens to teleport to, adrenaline wakes everyone up, and chances are most pallets are used so survivors would know they most remaining pallets are dream pallets should they fall back asleep.
---
His 3 main abilities all have decent counterplay to them and once people catch on he won't seem that overwhelming. Definitely not bottom of the barrel anymore, but he sure as hell won't be anywhere near top tier.

Yep, that's exactly what I am. You figured it out, pal.
---
Oooh, interesting. Thanks!
---
I JUST LAUGH AND THEN PUT THEM ON A HOOK WHILE THERE FRIENDS SIT AND TEABAG TOO, THEN I PUT THEM ON HOOKS. WHEN THERE IS NO ONE LEFT TEABAGGING ME, I TEABAGG BACK, BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL ON HOOKS! IT DOSNT BOTHER ME.
---
this IS true! it's in his power description, but not in the patch notes, so very few people are aware of it. They're actually very useful in the right circumstance, but that circumstance is not looping
---
Right? Lol I mean there’s more to them, but not anything that relates to the purge in any way. It’s funny how people are like “they wear a mask and have hoodies they’re literally purge” when nothing else is similar and there have been many things that have had mask wearing people in hoodies lol
---
Not even. Even with voice comms it's very difficult to explain where you are on the map to explain which pallet has been wasted
---
I think the dream pallets should be part of his kit instead of being a add on.
---
I've been struggling to keep one survivor on the hook without camping. I'm not expecting 4k matches, I was expecting being able to plop someone on the hook and the 4% base chance to unhook solo will do it's job.
---
Looks like a Billy to me, good sir!
---
True enough. I mean, you can just buy the cosmetics. With Money. And save those shards for bloodpoints conversion in the shrine. That's the closest you can get to buying bloodpoints. But not everyone values their time (or their bloodpoints) the same.

[Glass Bead](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Glass_Bead)
---
**Glass Bead** is an Uncommon Map Add-on.
---
A strange bead circled with gold that can be used to magnify the map and mark a specific position. The bead emits an energy which can be felt and seen by Survivors.
---
Unlocks the Marker Ability on secondary action.
---
Creating a marker that can be seen by all the Survivors.

Running in the 90’s plays every time you use an exhaustion perk
---
CLEANSE TOTEMS OR DONT CRY ABOUT NOED, GENRUSHING IS LITERALLY WHAT ITS FOR
---
Now I’m conversing and wondering why people are doing this and I get told to shut up? I’m confused dude I’ve only been on reddit for like 3 weeks
---
NOED and Devour Hope are two that you should look out for. Get rid of Devour Hope ASAP, as letting it build up will allow the killer to mori without an offering. 
---
NOED can really screw you over after getting the exit gates open.
---
At least more killers would play the game making the survivor queues more enjoyable (on console that is)
---
Same though.
---
Going to have to rebuild my Kate
---
only if survivors also get bonus bp for going against nurse, billy, or spirit
---
I second that notion
---
tfw you hear the breathing but you can't tell where it's coming from
---
Isn’t there a buff to survivor bp on the orb right now? I know they lowered escape points but they buffed a lot of other point awards
---
There's nothing you can do but try to get hatch of pips really matter to you.
---
I only have one friend who consistently plays DBD, and he's not always on, so i'm usually running solo, if i'm not killer.
---
sounds like a serious case of gitgud, if you can’t even get out of yellow ranks.
---
Well I mean... I wouldn't have cares about earning one in that situation. Just don't think it's fair to lose one when your teammates rage quit.
---
So it slows survivors AND acts as a teleportation device? Wow.
---
True. Tbh I can't play it until it hits console, but I just wanted to point that out. From what I've seen its just another thing you need to keep track of like hooks and gens
---
Ranks reset the on the 13th of every month.
---
Entity, Delete my entire Chaser score.
---
You have a nice guy mentality which is fine I guess. Since I'm playing a killer I like to have the merciless killer mentality. As soon as I load in expect no mercy no pity. Also seasoned survivors know how to exploit everything to always have the upper hand anyways.
---
Omg yes !
---
Then it's haunted ground MUAHAHAHAHA
---
The restrictions at the moment stop it from being bs though
---
oof okay my bad it’s just saved me a couple times from a surprise grab
---
What's with all these meme formats no one understands
---
A reticle to assist in knowing where you’re precisely “spotting”—with addons it’s harder &amp; harder to tell.
---
Why does Nea always look like Golem
---
Okay but that's literally not how any of this works.
---
Learning from an experience usually requires a skill level remotely comparable to the experience you're trying to learn from. Getting run around by a Rank 2 who can perfectly loop and pathfind as a newbie killer only serves to discourage the killer, because they don't have the foundation of knowledge to draw from. It's like I walked up to some poor sod who just picked up Soldier in TF2, and told them to do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6Y68my2nT8). More likely than not, they're just going to get annoyed and give up.
---
Thanks for the explaination. I honestly just thought it was change for the sake of chance. I was just kinda bewildered for a sec.
---
I thought I read power description... One second.
---
I see nothing mentioned about Dream Snare teleportation.
---
Good ffs we killer mains need every goddamn boost we can get we are fucking starving for buffs over here
---
Devs said on stream that WoO still shows dream pallets.
---
Perhaps if Ghostface has no addons, but GF can also use his power in a tiny crack in a window, etc. There’s a purple add on he has that made it pretty much impossible to spot him.
---
Ye its Ashe, I was chilling in a SWF lobby alone (as Ashe) waiting for my bois to join when he said it
---
If the person rescuing you has we'll make it (you'll get a message on the right side of the screen), they can heal super fast. If the killer isn't around (will take some judgement but if you see someone get injured in the bottom right, or see a survivor running like they're in a chase while you're hooked, those are pretty big clues the killer is busy), then you're safe to get healed up and back on a gen in no time.
---
I’m reading the description right now and do not see anything mentioning this, I will update this comment once I test it in game.
---
If they'd just make is so you get a stack for unhooking and for healing another survivor one health state, then it would be fine.
---
I know that, what I meant is that the game reset my rank EVERY time i closed the app.
---
Huntress with darkbead would be the scariest thing in the game
---
Devs balance for low ranks (20,16, even 12 maybe) so that the new players do not get overwhelmed; however, when those new players LEARN AND GET BETTER the game becomes unbalanced. I know damn well my fellow Red ranks and even purple ranks did not complain about Freddy’s aUrA rEaDiNG. New Freddy is fine, if anything the snares need a tweak or just need to be cut cause they’re pretty bad lol. Some add-ons are pretty atrocious too. Devs did pretty well granted that they give killers who already get hurt by loops massive counterplay.
---
Lol on another note if you wanna do remotely decent vs 1 of 16 killers you better use this perk, what about the perks u need vs the other 15 killers you ask? Nothing you just die, thanks for the info killermain trash, sorry that you can only play easymode spirit and you don't get any respect for it.
---
I can't get out of yellow ranks because almost every game I get either a rank update error or a pip error which  don't let me gain ranks.
---
Bahahaha you mean the only killers that can deal with high ranks. Cry baby
---
Where are the outcries for her being broken? when is she getting nerfed? where are all the topics on this shit? No let's first bring every other killer to their level and then we can maybe nerf some in 2030, fuck off.
---
So fucking true

---
You can find all sorts of perk and item recolors over in r/PerkByDaylight
---
Sounds like you need to get better. Im actually glad DBD isnt a game you can just pick up and dominate in. So how you just stop playing so we cant stop hearing you complain.
---
Be honest the first time you stepped in a snare you screamed. Or was that just me? I definitely think snares need a buff or the pallet addon should be a higher rarity as addons are supposed to make the power better (at least imo) so if makes sense why they they are superior
---
You know billies with actual skill can snowball without needing crutches like ruin.
---
N I G E R U N D A Y O , S M O K E Y
---
When you have a 50/50 chance to choose the right pallet, little did you know, they're both wrong
---
I did think that time zones played a part but there is no way in hell people with 50 ping could have a more 'appropriate' time to play games, I don't even get people with that low a ping during the day
---
i don't have friends either so i use discord's SWF chats
---
Are you selling them
---
Lol why? Nurse, spirit and hag are the only viable options at high rank to counter the endless looping and gen rushing toxic survivor strats.
---
Every fucking killeridea just gets thrown on here, how about thinking for both sides for once in your fucking life? here we got ebony's still up and running everyday I have to face this fucking bullshit but "i don't get bp vs swf as much, devs pls urgent fix this". Fuck this subreddit.
---
That's actually not true, that's not the MorezPack, That's the Golden Pack
---
It should be there on the PTB. I teleported to the traps on multiple occasions because I read about it and tried it. I've teleported using it multiple times (the teleport button is the same as for Hag). I also witnessed other Freddy players teleport doing this when I triggered a dream snare.
---
Yeah, except that it works nothing like the Clown, the Doctor and the Nurse. Can you please stop writing non sense?
---
Jane better watch herself
---
I hate having to force other survivors to go save their friend. It's like herding cats. At least they have a better excuse because T1 Myers radius is so small they think I'm not near them
---
PREACH
---
Lol nice downvotes
---
Welcome to high rank where the only viable killers are hag spirit and nurse. And even then you get fucked.
---
I'll try but i'm probably gonna get a medium vault
---
He's really fun to play as. I haven't tested the Dream Snares so I don't know how powerful they are but the dream pallets are pretty good and satisfying to use.
---
OP is a Claudette so you know at least one person wasn't doing gens.
---
I'm kinda dumb, but what do the dream pallets do again?
---
Maybe same speed as the Nurse? Except instead of blinking she just gets faster and faster until the end where she is much, much faster than the survivors. I would like to have another killer that gets more and more dangerous as the match progresses. Kinda like Myers.
---
:(.. may be coz they dont use real mesh for eyebrows. only jeff i think has actual mesh for eyebrows.
---
Clown is very fun, I'd recommend him. But you're different. What do you find fun in a killer?
---
Does Windows of Opportunity counter it? Or does it show fake pallets as real ones in the aura reading too?
---
Yeah, it’s gonna be a pain in the ass remembering as a survivor main but I guess it’s payback for all the times I was able to be brain dead against old Freddy
---
No that's still toxic
---
He can place traps which slows you down and teleport to gens and you fall asleep over time. You're not affected by the traps when you're awake. With an addon he can place fake pallets.   
---
How is that complex ?
---
So guys
---
Literally everyone knows theyre broken and the only viable killers at high ranks, and have been for some time. Why tf would people still being complaining about it?
---
And regardless, slightly buffing other killers to be a little less garbage *encourages* people to play other things, thus reducing the amount of broken killers in queue. Is that too much to ask, or do we have to wait for *every* killer to be trash before addressing any of them?
---
This is exactly how me and my cousin play
---
The plague is an excellent killer, she's really balanced.
---
If you don't have ruin then the hag is also a very fun choice.
---
The thing with clown is that he could still be looped like crazy even if he has his bottles idk
---
She still looks homeless lol
---
Seriously? *This* guy's mouth is perfect? Have you even seen The Doctor?
---
Proxy camp? You're not sneaky. I SAW YOU.
---
He was getting revealed behind walls before that nerf or what have you; it’s a kind of bug
---
Omfg I feel this on a spiritual level 😂
---
This is not a git gud rant, this rant is about how much of a buggy mess this game is. i'm definitely not a high rank player for sure, I understand that myself, but in order to become better i must play VS better killers for example and in my case this is just impossible due to not beeing able to rank up because of multiple rank error I get almost every game. I still get the bloodpoints but I don't get pips, the game just displays a huge "PIP/RANK ERROR" on my screen and proceeds to kick me out of the aftergame lobby denying a pip.
---
&gt;That's the Golden Pack that u/Kingslay87 used to make and I'm updating it now.  
---
&gt;

&gt;The current version (even with the new Freddy status effect)

Look who's shittin in the tall grass
---
So true
---
Iron Will is top tier and super good on every killers. I'm sorry that you only know how to loop. And judging by the fact that you need 4 perks , you're most likely not good at it. Get good scrub.
---
First I was like, a cosmetic for Jeff? Who cares about Jeff? (sry Jeff mains)
---
But, this is directly inspired by "Jesus" from TWD, looking at the hair. All we need now is Negan, oh wait, right, overkill kinda threw that out of the window, ffs.
---
PSA to everyone that StoneToss is a  *Nazi* asshole. Don't spend the effort to spread his comics please.
---
Oh so they only removed the music for the opening menu? That makes more sense
---
Ahh okay. Thankyouuuu
---
Iron Will is good against all of the killers, I'd call you a survivor main but if you don't know that, you need more practice
---
You don't want Survivors on the hook until they die... You need to play the cat &amp; mouse game. It'll give you more points, Hook someone go look for more once you've done some hooks and come back around to find a previous hooked person he can't escape because he'll go to tier 2 hook stage and needs to mash buttons to stay alive. Let them escape and either re-chase or stay on current target if you found another survivor in the meantime.
---
Then leave. If you have issues with the game then leave. No one in this sub is gonna try and make you stay.
---
Just because survivors don't make enough BP, isn't a reason why this is a bad idea. You could always add a multiplyer for if a killer has a Mori to balance it out
---
WHEN WILL KILLER ADEPTS BE FIXED! GETTING TIRED OF TRYING TO DOUBLE PIP WHEN A SURVIVOR CAN JUST ESCAPE FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT
---
I thought the hair was going to be more similar to dreads.
---
Is this description in English for you in the game? I **for real** don't see *anything* about this in power or add-on descriptions.
---
I believe that it is reportable due to targeted and consistent harrassment
---
That
---
Looks like Rachels (spoilers alert for Life is Strange Before The Storm) real mom.
---
I agree with that, sucks to go through all the waiting just to get mori’d a couple minutes into the game.
---
hmmm perhaps you're right. I'll edit this accordingly. Likely the mistake in this is that dream snares when used effectively are usually near generators, and instead of teleporting to a dream snare are teleported to a generator. I'll test this further, since when I did it I was certain I was teleporting to a snare, but I think you're right. Thanks for pointing this out to me!
---
Noed users be like
---
It would be cool if you got a token if you complete a generator too.
---
Question: Why not name the streamer? Besides reporting the harassing behavior it'll help your case if it happens to others
---
I mean tofu loves to mori most blendettes. I doubt you are talking about him? But to be honest it is gross what a blendette can do.
---
That's a pretty big difference. In 150 hours you havent taken that issue to the bug forum?
---
4/5 and 5/5 gens. are very hard to accomodate as they're much later in the game. The lobby should be permantly closed 
---
by then.
---
**Right now** however, survivors have a **major** disadvantage with DQs once the match starts which should not even be the case at 0/5. It's *as well* stupid for the killer especially during events when you have to hook people.
---
He is nothing like those killers. He doesn’t need to reload, he does t cause survivors to scream with his terror radius, and the argument that the gen teleporting is like Nurse then you have lost it
---
I bought him in August of 2018, loved him even though he was soooo "weeeeak". I loved him and really wanted to spread some love for him by commeting #SupportFreddyDBD whenever I felt as he was being bullied.
---
I now gotta start using #BringBackOldFreddy because, truth be told. This. Is. Not. My. Freddy.
---
Well I have friends, but only one of them plays Dead By Daylight.
---
As a killer is so fucking terrible idk what to do. I'm rank 6 and I'm getting paired with 8, 7, 2, 1.how is that fair
---
So basically hook them, let them get that little bit of hope that they'll survive, and take it from them with another hook?
---
Snares are quite good. Most players are just bad at mind games and placing traps while chasing.
---
Im welcome for the change. The biggest thing i dont like about freddy now is putting them in the dream
---
Why does breakdown cost 2700?
---
Against the subreddit’s rules I believe
---
What show is this from?
---
My mistake!
---
I've seen people on bug forums with the same error yet nobody got the fix. I also reported the issue to DbD directly and only got a generic "We know this issue exists, we're working on it" reply.
---
Rule 3. That's why you don't name the streamer
---
Don't neglect the fact that now there is a nice ui and no skill check bug. Has it happen to me 2 nights ago. Fun stuff.
---
And I don't
---
\#BringBackOldFreddy
---
I know that, I just had to let off steam.
---
they are fake pallets
---
You'll find 300 "freddy f-tier memes" before you'll find a singular thread that isn't downvoted to shit saying that spirit is overpowered. 
---
And no every killer is fine the way they are, we don't need to bribe killers in order to play something semi-decent "because we buffed it pls play it mr killer" they'll only play the most broken easymode shit and no buffing will fix that only nerfs will, the end.
---
Luckily i got the notification that someone mentioned me.
---
Thanks for remembering about my existance &lt;3
---
Bloodlust is pathetic. It’s the bad killer mechanic. Learn when/where to chase and how to mindgame correctly. Not everything needs to be in the killers favor, that’s boring. 
---
Trapper is my main killer, always has and always will be. I had no problems before and have less fun now. Hag too. Learn time management and how to plan. 
---
Original DS was a joke. I didn’t use it because there’s so many better perks, I still don’t use it since it’s even shittier now. 
---
Mettle of man is also a piece of crap, you killers are fucking pathetic to whine about MoM. Seriously it’s not enough that IF they manage to get away they are injured or visible to you anywhere on the map. Just wow. I love when ppl use MoM, it’s so easy to use as a killer tool to ensure more kills. Learn how to play the damn game. 
---
Everything else was needed changes. I don’t appreciate you telling me to kill myself with a rock, wtf. Don’t assume I’m toxic because I’m better then you. I don’t abuse anything or teabag at the gates, why would I? I’m not a broken little shit.
---
Is there really a streamer named Tofu?
---
I really dont want to escalate the situation and have other people raid a stream, I'm almost finished prestige-ing so I guess I'll just report and then if it continues I'll take further action.
---
The doctors pallets sound like the better version TBH
---
Now this ill buy
---
Ok? Why not go to r/rant ?
---
Ohtofu yes
---
Definitely reportable for harrassment and griefing and especially if you have proof then he should get banned.
---
are those the galaxy icons?
---
No not tofu, its not a well known streamer. Just gonna report if thats what I should be doing. If I finish prestige-ing and it continues I could take further action then.
---
They make sharp hand joe even more obnoxious than he already was.
---
Do you have a better idea(s)?
---
I've had this exact thing happen to me feelsbadman
---
A change, was needed. But definetely not a rework (I can't spell english, don't bully me ;( )
---
All we needed was a proper buff, putting him up there with the Pig. Microsleep when falling asleep within 8 or 16 meters. Constant Pill Bottle outside of that range. And a 5 second fall asleep. Done. Easy. This won't make him OP, it won't make him weak either. A good balance in my opinion.
---
ok.....
---
Oh stfu the "iron wil is top tier derrr"-mob comes along, it's such a bullshit argument, i see you noobs in my game you get shit on all the time, "no self-care that's bad" &gt; sits in corner of map with iron will waiting for hatch. Fuck off iron will is dogshit-tier and the only reason I'd ever run it is because it completely fucks with braindead spiritmains, but hey then they'll just play Hag and I can "just equip urban evasion duud", fuck off noob.
---
You don't even know what the killer did and still flame the survivor lmao.
---
WoRdS hUrT
---
Not everyone has time to put hundreds of hours to mastering him
---
This is happening to me, this Freddy is rather boring imo, and I think I'll stop mainning him. Shame I put do many blood points in him.
---
It really isn't though and I'd call you a 200 hour dogshit player but reddit doesn't have your steam profile linked so I don't have proof.
---
Idk MB repair gens when he does it?
---
Dude I posted this under a "Salt/Rant"flair of DbD reddit...
---
So this might be a stupid question, but does Freddy still have his Aura reading ability when survivors are asleep?
---
TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY
---
It's survivors' own fault they go against them. If you wouldn't complain and demand nerfs with every new killer, you wouldn't have to deal with just those three
---
Must be the first time it has appeared on the shrine. First appearance is always that bit extra expensive
---
I'm gonna miss making people so angry that they lost to Freddy that they rage in the chat. It was always so satisfying
---
Don't even trip.
---
Were you going to finish that thought or na
---
The first time they are hooked they can escape with a successful skill check, the 2nd time they can't anymore so if you are up against an altruistic team that saves hooked people almost instantly just keep hunting and hooking again every time you hook you get more points.
---
If a Survivor dies after the first hook you get:
---
- 500BP from the Hook
---
- 200BP x2 for the 2 hook levels
---
- 600BP (I think) From the final sacrifice
---
- If you rehook 'em you get 500BP for the 2nd and 3rd hook as well including the BP from chases and hits. 
---
It's more beneficial and fun for both parties if you don't camp the hook. If they are dumb enough to save a guy when you're near the hook and you slam his face into the pavement almost instantly then it's on the idiot that rescued the hooked person. Usually if the game goes well you opt to let the hooked char run and go for the altruistic douchenozzle since he has potentially more points in him. That coupled to the 2nd charge you can get in BBQ+C will make it more worthwhile.
---
I just attempted to teleport to a set off dream trap. Did not work.
---
Mario Royal was a fun way to wait. RiP
---
The thing is he said what he has done
---
Yeah i get it. Its frustrating to see what you've come to known completely gone
---
Rank isn't that important dude. It's more time played than skill really.
---
BT can be strong in a coordinated SWF, *if you're camping*. It only triggers in the killers terror radius. 
---
DS only triggers for *60 seconds after someone has been unhooked*. A SWF has nothing to do with it. 
---
Your play is what makes these perks an issue for you, there is no argument here. 
---
I remember when DS actually *was* a problem. Survivors just had to wiggle to 35% of their meter and anyone could use it.
---
Oh, and I play both sides. You're making assumptions because of my flair.
---
The first time a perk appears on the shrine it's more expensive
---
Every time something is put on the shrine for the first time ever, it’s cost is 2700 instead of the normal 2000. Next time it appears though, it’ll be 2000
---
Sure wallhacks that can be disabled by a single skillcheck are cool, but you really don't think teleportation and fake pallets are better?
---
He also mentioned that the killer face camped the other three while revving his chainsaw.
---
That's like 90% of survivors and since unhappy customers dont buy cosmetics...
---
Don't hold your breath on Freddy staying as he is.
---
If you spawn next to a Jigsaw box you know it's Pig. If you spawn next to a fountain you know it's Plague. It's just a consequence of their toolkit. Freddy's passive sleep helps him more than the knowledge it gives survivors
---
They should at least buff his dream snares
---
Holy shit I'm new and didn't realize seeing them on gen auras was a bug. That would have thrown me off playing Killer when it's fixed.
---
It was definitely smart to break chase in the main building. That place is too strong.
---
hey pal, check the edits I made
---
STOP DODGING IF YOU SEE SURVIVORS BRINGING ITEMS TO THE GAME, WE WILL STOP DODGING MORIS, AGREED?
---
It's certainly a region based issue; I noticed the Russian chat too. This isn't very uncommon though in any region of there are not enough players on.
---
I always feel bad when  I accidentally tunnel but then I remember I don't actively sac if they're passed the struggle phase
---
I refrained from making that pun. It was in vain.
---
Okay this might sound toxic but they need to slightly buff his dream snares. Maybe make them less visible or take away the fast action when they trigger it. They keep fast vaulting even after they hit a snare.
---
Yeah, definitely strong.
---
It worked - Thanks guys
---
Wouldnt that make the Freddy version better because it locks them in the animation, giving you time to catch up? And what do you mean "pay to win killers"? DLC?
---
It's about as useful as any other stealth-perk, do you go around praising urban evasion as top-tier? Premonition? No? How about running all those perks because they're so gooooood.
---
😂 ok then. Makes sense.
---
I agree they only think about killers they need to think about both sides
---
It'd be cool i'd WoO didn't
---
His name is tendie man.
---
I believe I've seen this meme already in this sub.
---
Lmao. Who touched you? Self-Care is too much of  a time-waster. I'd rather stay injured and wait for adrenaline cause I know I can keep the killer occupiee 'til then. Self-Care is a noob perk for people who can't keep a chase injured.
---
Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart, great new show on Cartoon Network.
---
No killer can resist the hot bod of Ace. They just need to give the entity a taste. Its a fair price to pay for perfection
---
I appreciate what you’re doing, but that’s not quite how the internet works.  GravelHeave is gonna be circulated tons by mere fact that it is easy to make stupid exploitables like this.
---
He's not even a stealth killer. He's an objective blocker.
---
Most survivors find out who the killer is within the first 30 seconds just based on items they find, sounds they hear, or animations they see. Knowing that Freddy is the killer in the beginning is meaningless to his power, because his power is to have map pressure.
---
You are underestimating his toolkit, because you have completely misunderstood what his toolkit is tailored to do. He's adding map pressure, distracting survivors from the objective, and slowing survivors in chase. Stealth has nothing to do with his toolkit.
---
Cool thanks
---
Recent characters have more expensive perks IIRC
---
I get the salt/rant if its a unique complaint something new happens and you are salty. Youre just salty complaining about things commonly known, then saying im leaving and not comung back acting like youre some important figure in the game we should keep. Just leave no cares if you do.
---
Hey it's Sully. Who gets to be Nathan Drake?
---
Quality
---
Freddy is not just an m1 killer that can find survivors if he lost them.
---
Freddy is the with the best sneak attack, tracking, and stall that can not be compared to other killers.
---
He is the only killer who can leave survivors and come back later so he can manage his time so darn well while the survivors get stuff done so slow Freddy might as well just afk for a bit grab something to drink and come back since he can do that.
---
He is the most misunderstood killer there is, people play him wrong and think that he is shit while they play him wrong.
---
He has so much to learn and you feel and see yourself improving whenever you use that new thing you learned.
---
I love playing as Freddy.
---
Ahhh cool thanks
---
I DON’T EVER DODGE LOBBIES, BOLD OF YOU TO ASSUME THAT
---
As someone with 3200+ hours in the game and easily 600 in total on OG Freddy I can say that I like the rework. I felt the same as you for a while. I grew fond of old Fred as I had mastered him. However, these new changes are incredibly fun to play as and against. You are also severely underestimating the power of the dream pallets.
---
There are many things I'll miss about old Fred, most of which you mentioned, but I am incredibly excited for the rework now.
---
Yikes.
---
If he's not a stealth killer, explain his invisibility then.
---
AS OTHERS SAID, YOU HAVE TO PLAY AS HER TO SEE HER WEEKNESSES. FOR ME NOW ITS SUPER EASY TO JUKE HER PHASINGS.
---
Duh. Each person has their own experiences and issues that only matter to them
---
Suddenly I’m a Kate main. 
---
*Throws Adam away*
---
Yea
---
It's too sweaty, You can't be chillin at rank 1, you have to manage every fucking microsecond and play around all the bullshit perks
---
After rank reset you can take your time and fuck around doing weird builds and silly things
---
Rank 1 isn't fun, and you get nothing for being there
---
Why would his snares need to be nerfed?
---
Sloppy butcher wraith? I'm a wraith main how have i not heard of that?
---
A LOT OF KILLERS DO, CONGRATS, YOU NOT ONE OF THEM.
---
No it would not make Freddy’s better, the survivors are at a severe disadvantage from the beginning, especially against Freddy.
---
And by pay to win, I mean **PAY TO WIN**.
---
As in, you pay real human money and are given a killer that has unnecessary abilities and perks that make the game substantially harder for everyone playing against that killer, and substantially easier for people playing as that killer, so they are **paying** to **win** because they **paid** money for a killer that makes it a lot easier for them to **win**. 
---
Killers don’t need “time to catch up” they’re already faster than the survivors, and Freddy definitely doesn’t need time to catch up.
---
...new freddy isn't invisible...
---
90% including me XD
---
True but it's still nowhere near enough at least in high ranks
---
Playing killers for a daily doesn't count
---
Not OP
---
Pro: Respawns automatically
---
Con: Can be checked by survivors outside of chases &amp; before starting to loop.
---
I think Freddy's are better. With doc, survivors can't be tricked into looping around the fake pallet.
---
Except he is from a certain length away from awake survivors. Did you even read the patch notes????
---
There is no real direct measure of pure skill, what's the measure? 
---
Being able to get a 4K with no perks or addons on Rank 1 with fully geared up survivors?
---
Or maybe it's maxing out all the bloodpoint gains to maximum WITH 4K?
---
Maybe it's how short the match ends WITH a 4K?
---
People toss the word "skill" around like it's nothing, it's hard to get a proper measure of skill, perks or lack thereof is not a *particularly* good way to judge it.
---
With most of the killers being very M1-oriented, the actual skill you can actually learn in the game and your most useful one, is learning the map-layouts and the loops.
---
Perks don't make the man, and lack of perks don't prove anything either, just let people play how they like.
---
Yup drop them in front of pallets and windows.
---
Ah, yes, from one of recent games.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/QE4sY6F.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QE4sY6F.jpg)
---
NUT
---
He's too easily looped and juked
---
Poor leather face.
---
Your moronic ideas touched my head, also I dare you to say "who touched you" to someone IRL and see if you don't get your fat ugly face punched into. Spirit is for braindeads, you're butthurt about me saying the truth that's the end of this story. You have fun roleplaying as a survivor who's actually good show me some of your replays and I might reconsider, oh you don't have those? Gee what a surprise.
---
I started with the game playing all killers a bit and I mained pig when I got her.
---
But when I started to play Freddy I first thought he was shitty but then I learned that I played him wrong and as soon as I got used to the new playstyle I could not stop playing him.
---
I played him atleast 80% if all my games in dbd and I watched many videos who learned me how to use his power even better.
---
So having my favorite killer being taken away really really hurts.
---
luckly for me i already main her, insta buy &lt;3
---
I don't have much hope for Freddy getting out of the ptb intact. The devs have a history of nerfing the things that work instead of buffing the things that don't. 
---
They'll probably solve the dream pallets &gt; dream snares thing by nerfing the pallets.
---
Freddy is currently pay to lose tho, because prerework hes honestly hot garbage with minimal chase potential. You'd be much better off playing ad nurse or Billy, both of whom are free to play once you own the game
---
[The Survivor POV :POG:](https://clips.twitch.tv/PhilanthropicUglySoymilkRickroll)  Nuts!
---
That just reinforces the Pay to win aspect of the game.
---
&gt;items give a negligible at best increase at the odds of survivors escaping.
---
I'd say having a good toolbox, medkit, key, etc. increases your chances of survival drastically, same way add ons do for some killers. Having a syringe/skeleton key can be huge, not having to depend on your teammates for healing is great too.
---
&gt;You level a survivor to get their teachable and then you don't need to put points into them anymore.
---
You can still want to play different survivors? You also might want to have items/offerings on them. Survivor bloodwebs are just as grindy and slow as killers' webs, having way less points doesn't help. There are 51 teachable perks, each of them going to 3 tiers.
---
&gt;Try to ignore the circle jerk for 5 minutes and actually realize why killers have always been better at getting BP, We NEED more.
---
Sir, I'm almost exclusively a killer main and I know that some killers like trapper, wraith or doc are garbage without add ons. I also know that there is a lot of killers who's base kits are good enough to function perfectly well without them.
---
Maining killer doesn't prevent me from realizing that survivor point gain is absolutely pathetic. I'd wager that a lot of people got put off survivor due to how few points they gain.
---
She literally looks like a bratty sub with this skin.
---
Why wouldnt they DC a camping, slugging killer?
---
Yes lol.
---
Lmao i wasnt camping, nice bait tho
---
Dream pallets were not meant to be more powerfull, they were meant to be an alternative ability. Thats why the addon is brown.
---
Lmao😂😂👍 ok thats a good one i have to admit.
---
OH SHI-
---
This is beyond relatable.  New Freddy's fun, but he's not as addictively fun as old Freddy once I learned him.
---
I feel like stage one of the escape part is a bit op, 8 seconds *6 = 48 seconds. It isnt always the case but 48 seconds out of 60 on just part one? Seems a bit impossible and unfair. Maybe less keys like 4? One for each survivor?
---
Yeah I don't record my games. Get good cunt
---
if he's a certain distance away you don't need to see him. you'd still hear his terror radius, when he gets close, and by the time you'd have made preparations to hide yourself you'd be able to see him.
---
Also, because of the passive sleep timer, everyone's usually asleep anyway, so they would be able to see him! There's no point in stealthiness. The passive sleep timer helps him because he does more damage as an objective blocker than a stealth killer.
---
Feel sorry for everyone upvoting and believing this scam
---
Oh please stop whining. "If their good at a certain killer, it's hard to win!" Yeah no shit, that's the point. Would you rather have a character that's hard as balls to play, and have them suck balls?
---
I mean sure, but then you have another instance of a single perk countering a main aspect of the killer’s power, Ike OoO and Ghostface.
---
Honestly the biggest communication I have when I swf is
---
"Who's the killer?" "Its x"
---
"I'm hooked and nobody else is near, help"
---
"I'm hooked and the killer is camping, dont bother"
---
"OH FUCK OH FUCK THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND ME OH FUCK"
---
Idk telling someone to kill themself vs tbagging and taunting are very different things. For one, telling someone to kill themselves is bannable and tbagging isnt, devs actually have explicitly said not to report ppl for tbagging because thats just an aspect of the game. When you use expletives in the end game chat and threaten other players your intent is obviously made clear, however without real communication you can't tell if somebody is crouching rapidly in a friendly way or a toxic way. 
---
There is no solution to people tbagging besides removing yourself from the game. People aren't going to stop doing what they're doing because it hurts ur feelings. Thats an aspect of any video game, some people really enjoy trolling the enemy and use it as a tactic to win. If that genuinely upsets some people I think they should reevaluate if they should be playing the game. 95% of the time I really enjoy playing the game and have no complaints about the killer. Its really frustrating as a survivor to get tunneled/camped and shit talked for crouching 1 to many times for their liking, if i happen to spawn near their ruin totem, or loop them for the majority of the game while my teammates got gens. However that's just how competitive games like this work. If I was so pissed off about getting camped / tunneled I wouldn't play the game because I can't change the play style of anybody else but myself.
---
I guess I'm kind've just sick of people complaining about toxicity on the reddit (on both sides really). Toxicity occurs in nearly every multiplayer competitive game so why would dead by daylight be different?
---
XD true, true.
---
Yeah and you wouldn't have the balls to say any of that shit IRL to anyone either. Feel free to record one right now, you'll probably double pip anyways so not really a problem right? Oh no time for that either? Gonna stop responding? That's what I thought, keep roleplaying scrub.
---
That is worth noting yes. Using a successful snare doesn't feel as good as pallets let alone most powers in the game.
---
Nobody care about losing, but when killer abilities and perks are full of unthoughtfulness, like being screwed over by unfair builds that's when we all stop playing.
---
Dream pallets are pretty strong. Seems that’s the much better choice between the two. It’s a free hit essentially.
---
The soft counter is Windows of Opportunity and memorization, maybe if you’ve been around the map enough, but realistically no. A perk to counter one killer will get as much use as Calm Spirit to counter screams. A survivor isn’t going to have the total map knowledge to remember where pallets were and weren’t if they haven’t been chased around.
---
It’s an easy free hit and honestly if they nerf it or change the add-on rarity I will not care. Or buff WoO so that it is a hard counter and does not show the aura of the pallet, and the perk may get more usage.
---
Freddy is still in a much better state without the pallets. Strong map coverage with a teleport with no range limit. Snares to trap loop areas and windows to slow vaults down or disable loops.
---
He has better map coverage and a better way to deal with loops even without dream pallets so honestly the only thing I’d nerf are the pallets.
---
You can’t see Freddy coming, he gets 2 chase opportunities, one of which he’s invisible and the second one you can only wake yourself up after you fail a skill check or get woken up by another survivor but only if you manage to juke him and escape. 
---
I haven’t played against him since the rework but if he was considered “hot garbage” *before* the rework then I can’t even imagine how toxic he is now.
---
Jesus Christ dude, I'm not an important figure and I have literally no idea why would you think that. I'm sorry if the post made you think that. The problem is that I don't want to leave, I just love the game's concept. But I feel like the game MAKES me leave due to literally not being playable for me personally. I expressed my thoughts hoping that maybe somebody who actually is an important figure will pick up the subject and the devs will fix these issues so I will be able to finally enjoy the game. Of course the chance of that happening is close to 0, I'm aware of that, but I gave it a shot. Maybe somebody else has the exact same list of issues as I do and maybe they will feel a little bit better knowing that they are not the only ones. Maybe they will read the rant and not post theirs. Maybe someone will help me fix some of the issues that I have, who knows.
---
It's not. Pick a north, south, east, west. Stick to it.
---
I said I thought current Freddy was fine and got so much hate for it
---
I think I'd dare do it to you considering how pathetic you are right now. Writing a fucking paragraph over a video game lmao.
---
Even GG is toxic. If I get destroyed and it's completely one sided how is that a good game? GG stands for good game remember? And the only ones saying GG are the ones that win let's be honest. Haha
---
They buffed pallets two updates ago, which is the biggest buff they can make.
---
poor man
---
When was slugging ever toxic?
---
45 seconds but it’s less per person asleep
---
I HATE SWF. WHY CAN'T I AT LEAST GET SOME COMPENSATION FOR HAVING A GROUP OF SURVIVORS WHO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I AM AND WHICH GENS TO DO? IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.
---
I didn't ask for the movie version of Ghostface, I asked for a costume that doesn't have stripes or other color details and it's fully black so he can look more like the OG Ghostface. And considering that FunWorld itself sells full Ghostface costumes that resemble the movie ones, I don't think how there should be a license problem?
---
Well there is no more action speed debuff so It's not that bad
---
Lol all those perks are completely busted ngl
---
Think of it this way.  With dedicated servers, if we get into a game where its laggy AF and the lag benefits the killer, there is No other option to think than Lag Switching and then everybody report him.
---
Yeah agreed.
---
Hag has a lot of hilarious moments.
---
\- surv gets spooked by a clone and doesn't notice that he actually keeps running into you looking behind;
---
\- surv drops a pallet, triggers a trap on another side and jumps over back to you;
---
\- surv doesn't respect a trap during unhook and gets yoinked.
---
And her rare add-ons are also very fun. Silent traps and bodyblocks can create even more funny situations.
---
He has nothing going for him once hes in a chase though. Sure he can sneak up on people, but any attentive survivor will know when hes coming and know to get to a loop or pallet. Once you're in chase hes an M1 killer with no other ability. His wallhacks are very good tho, as long as you can keep people asleep.
---
😂😂😂
---
Rest in void old freddy. My memories of mindgameing survivors with the transition will not be forgotten... if only people bothered to learn him, if only the devs buffed him properly instead of replaceing him with a compleay new killer.
---
Great outfit but i think the hair could be drastically changed. Maybe like a single braid or something else (i dont know hair lol). Very likely to get the top and shorts.
---
yes please
---
Whenever I play with someone we just talk about everything and nothing and mostly about something that has nothing to do with the game. It’s rather a distraction than help, especially when there is more than one other person. Good luck in hearing Myers breathing while there’s someone talking or laughing, countless times I died because of something like that.
---
This is true for 2 man groups, the more people, the more they think they’re in a mission impossible movie
---
But being in a chase is already an advantage because the killers are faster than the survivors, there’s nothing wrong with looping and juking, it’s literally the only way a survivor can escape unless the person playing the killer is garbage.
---
There is a lot more to Freddy though. Micro-sleep, a basic attack puts you to sleep, alarm clocks, lullaby, limited visibility range and intermittent phasing, traps, teleport. 
---
Trapper traps are stronger, but that's literally the only thing you have to worry about when playing against trapper. A lack of availability of game mechanics for killers is largely the reason why many of them aren't viable against an organized team. When killers are too straightforward, it's difficult to balance them. Look at clown. He's not in the greatest spot. If his bottles were so strong that he could always catch survivors using them, then he would be OP. They aren't that strong, and he has nothing else, so he's under-powered. Rather than just buffing the numbers on other killers, they need to have something that enables them to make plays.
---
Which one out of thanatophobia and surveillance would be good for a killer? Does it depend on who you use? (Ghost face cough cough*)
---
What’s wrong with you?
---
Pussy
---
What what showed that he did
---
thank u  🅱️ eanits
---
You posted this to see if others had similar issues of course, as told you we all see buggy and major gameplay issue. Most of just dont go on a rant about because in reality we as the majority know it what point is there to conplain about it on reddit. This still confirms this is a justification post which is still makes no sense. Its even more odd why you said all this. Just leave
---
&gt;you can't tell if somebody is crouching rapidly in a friendly way or a toxic way.
---
That's bullshit.
---
I think it's 100% clear if someone is trying to get on your nerves or just saying "Hello".
---
&gt; telling someone to kill themself vs tbagging and taunting are very different things. 
---
Different? Yes. One is way more extreme than the other.
---
Completely different? No. One is toxic, where you try to make the other guy mad.
---
Where the other one is trying to make the other guy feel hurt.
---
That's not exactly the opposite.
---
&gt; Toxicity occurs in nearly every multiplayer competitive game so why would dead by daylight be different? 
---
Same. I don't have a problem with Toxicity. I am toxic myself.
---
I just hate the double standard. I am 100% certain that this subreddit is mostly just a survivor circlecerk.
---
Complain about any OP survivor perk? Downvoted. "You got ruin, noed!"
---
Complain about any killer perk? Upvoted. "Yea, killer that use this have no skill!"  
---
Survivors complain about camping, tunneling. Upvoted. "Yea that shits toxic!"  
---
Killers complain about t-bagging, getting insulted and more. Downvoted "Thats part of the game. Just deal with it.
---
This is what bothers me. Facecamp, t-bag, and tell people to kill themselves all you want. That's just online gaming.
---
But damn I hate the survivor circlejerk we got on this reddit.
---
"Only we are getting nerfed! Killers have the power role! We are the victims of toxicity! We are only toxic towards camping killers! We don't have any good perks anymore!"  
---
It just makes me roll with my eyes every time.
---
I love all of those. Only second to when I'm crouched as the Pig and randomly wander into a survivor when they turn a corner and get a face full of pig head.
---
Just remember that he is the THICC boi that breaks hooks when he gets off them.
---
Right, when you get down to it, I can’t think of a power that is less exciting than snares. I guess legion bleed spamming?
---
Your downvotes are an indicator that nobody cares about your basic ass advice. Can you kill with Freddy? Of course. He's my 2nd favorite killer. That doesn't make him good.
---
I SEE THROUGH YOUR SWF  PROPAGANDA RANK 1'S
---
I dunno, *Now I'm playing with power* is pretty great too
---
They’ve been going this for a while. Plague is just a mashup of pig and huntress, GF a mix of pig and Myers... Legion... less said the better. Spirit was the last original killer they made.
---
If I remember the more people in dream reduce the cool down I think 15% per person but even with it the cool down is still fairly long and there is a lengthy animation to him doing it so it's easy for survivors to get a head start or hide if there fast enough
---
Well done, friend. Doing our ghosty boi proud.
---
Now we just need some way to make it so that the killers without anti-loop powers aren't unusable past rank 10. And make Trapper's power cooldown-based for god's sake. Just have the traps disappear with that weird Entity effect when they get used or something.
---
Lol you said downed 2 of them while they tried to save. I wonder how that happened? Myst have been close to the hook. So yep, camping, slugging killer.
---
because I like to try to bring new formats to keep my shitposts new and fresh.
---
*also I really like the source show and have been making tons of formats from it*
---
I was playing against a Laurie one time who used every single pallet she ran into. Little did she know I was destroying every single one and continuing to chase because I knew there'd be no pallets left by the time I had to chase other people.
---
I ended up getting a 4k, and that Laurie at the end said "I should've won, pallets should respawn"
---
Never have I played against someone so convinced that using pallets meant they had skill. Made me laugh so hard
---
😂😂👌
---
In its current uses...
---
Imagine if there was an add-on that made it so if you were downed under the effect of a dream snare, the next time you are unhooked you’d be broken for 1-3 min, then it would make it so that surv would have to play safe and not do gens, or work on gens and risk getting m1’ed, it has the potential to be good, the devs are just too stupid to make it good, the other statuses like bleed more, and blindness have no way to actually be good tho, they’re just terrible and always will be.
---
She kinda looks like a type of Black Canary
---
When you played a killer for a long time and then somebody who played the killer for less than 5 games but is up to date with the memes tells you that you are wrong.
---
I don't think he used the add-on that makes freddy invisible whipe carrying a survivor. 
---
Now that's the ultimate scare machine. A body from nowhere coming to hit ya? Comparable to prayer beads spirit. I need video proof to see if it's working as I think
---
The point is that he couldn't kill 3 by camping
---
thats how its supposed to be
---
Oh...
---
Where did you get it?
---
Unless the multiplier for killers with Moris like x3 - x5 it wouldn't really make a difference for those that die instantly, and I doubt they'd do a multiplier that high. Also, not every killer runs a Mori, so that's hardly a fair way to excuse killers getting even more BPs, and like I said, killers already get a USEFUL perk that allows them to double their bloodpoints... Not to mention the perk has extremely easy requirements.
---
If survivors got a small BP gain increase and "We're gonna live forever" was actually useful in some way OR was affected by healing others... Then why not? However, the BP gain gap between killers and survivors is already HUGE. If anything that gap needs to shrink before stuff like this can be considered. It's a good idea but I just don't think that the side who can earn 50k+ from running BBQ or even 100k + from running BBQ and party streamers deserves more BPs. 
---
I'm lucky if I get over 30k as a survivor, even with WGLF. All depends on when you die and how useful/useless your team is. My average is usually around 15k - 30k as a survivor, as a killer it's probably triple.
---
And looping and juking killers is also how it’s supposed to be when trying to escape. 
---
I’m not complaining about killers being faster.
---
Some cosmetics were only obtainable through events that have already past and will probably not come back
---
that doesnt make it not true. freddy’s pallets are better. of course theyre going to be better than the doctors - no one would pay for freddy for no reason.
---
There's plenty of killers, matchmaking is just beyond garbage.
---
im not sure what your point is
---
If you have more than 10 hours in the game you know that's a lie, especially if the survivors go for ~~stupid~~ risky saves
---
it's a great idea if you have a competitive game. this is an assymetrical casual game with a low skill ceiling where rank does not really matter. this is not counter strike with real elo and equal sides so at silver both teams sucking is working for balance. they cannot balance with only the "i play daily 7-8 hours" guys in their head.
---
I know, but the perks names contradict each other
---
Thats fine then, patrolling each gen, especially in early game will take awhile
---
Was this picture taken before or after the Endgame update??
---
I've always been of the opinion that the bloodpoint bonuses from bbq and wglf should just be innate to all players normally, then rework the perks so they can be actually balanced. Well bbq is fine, but the bp bonus is almost out of place on it.
---
Well yeah, but being in a chase with many other killers is far more advantageous than freddy. With Billy you have instadown mid chase, with hag you can teleport to a popped trap for a hit mid chase. I do agree with the looping and juking statement considering those are the two ways to escape a killer
---
So that's a big no on the replay then huh tough guy? Don't want me to see the rank 15 icon or what's the problem? Pussy, lying bitch.
---
Ping Crimson
---
THIS ISN'T OVERWATCH IT'S A PUBLIC TEST _BUILD_
---
Haha imagine playing nurse and complaining
---
How was there a nerf to slugging? It still happens almost every game in higher ranks, so get outta here with that BS. And map rng changes have definitely benefitted killers waaay more, I really don't know what you're on about lol
---
Hey what does the new freddy do? What has been changed?
---
Ruin bond with brutal strenght.  
---
My marriage in a nutshell.
---
He's only invisible from farther than 34 meters away and only against awake survivors. It helps him move around the map, but he's definitely not a stealth killer.
---
This kid is actually mentally disabled 😂
---
Then there should be pay to win survivors too, last I checked there aren’t any, but we’ve got toxic ghostface, Michael, Freddy, the stupid plague, huntress isnt too bad, the legion, the pig. All pay to win killers, all killers that are given an extra unfair advantage that you have to pay actual money for, which makes the game less fun for other people who just want to play it to have fun but then these people come in, buy the winning killers, run in and camp and teabag and troll, while using all of the pay to win perks and killers acting like it makes them better players.
---
no, but it looks the same it's two packs are colorful
---
these are sick man
---
Thank you kind sir.
---
If healing gave one that would be great!
---
"GG PLAGUE OP BHVR SO KILLER SIDED" - NEA WHO LEADS THE KILLER TO ALL OF US, REFUSES TO UNHOOK US AS SHE HIDES IN A CORNER OF THE MAP, AND DOESN'T RECOVER WHEN SHE GOES DOWN
---
I ESPECIALLY LIKE HOW SHE SAYS THAT WE DID NOTHING EVEN THOUGH I SPECIFICALLY TANKED A HIT FOR HER SO SHE'D HAVE A CHANCE TO RUN AWAY, THEN LET MYSELF GO DOWN WITH DECISIVE STRIKE SO I COULD UNHOOK HER
---
Daaamn that would be scary o.O
---
Funny coming from a guy behind a screen whose probably morbidly obese never had/will have a girlfriend who lives alone crying his nights away because no one loves him, fight me in real life bitch and you I will fucking paralyze your pussy ass
---
but that’s not part his main power, it’s still an add on right?
---
It is, but it replaces the dream snare entirely. It’s either or.
---
I’m asking. Is it just in the orb right now? It def wasn’t out yesterday on the live version
---
Once is the key word there. Lame was also considered one, as well as dumb. But the times have changed and left you in its wake, gathering up all these titles and wearing them proudly.
---
YEAH I ALSO MAIN KILLER AND IT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME. SOMETIMES I'LL TUNNEL THEM THO 😳
---
Exactly, survivors have to put up with bullshit too. Especially solo players, we can't communicate and we don't know how many totems are left.
---
Not to mention killers get a quitter bonus when a survivor DCs... The fuck does their team get? A harder match. Just what I want when the stupid toxic Nea gets downed and DCs, a harder match... Wooooooo...
---
Okay that is true. I feel like a lot of people don’t know you can do that with the hag though, at least it seems like they don’t
---
She used to have a pentagram on her head, why did they change that before release? Fuck.
---
Thank :3
---
Killers have to work with 4 randoms every game though.  At least when I play survivor I can wait out hatch or door if I *have* to.  Or, worst case I can just SD on hook.  As a killer I feel like I have to face the toxicity if I want to do my job/get out of the game. and 
---
Ive felt frustrated more often as killer than survivor over all my playtime, and since you're more "held hostage" by toxicity as killer, it makes it that much more frustrating.  
---
~~This is an opinion piece, do feel free to have your own opinions, thank you~~
---
Stop would be useful
---
on a side note, I want Ace to have finger guns on his point emote
---
I honestly think that would fix a lot of balance problems with BP
---
Would be nice. The fact is the barrier of entrance is getting worse and worse with each expansion, so getting new players to the game will be harder and having that as a default would help with it. Because not only would you need to pay a loooot of money to get all the characters, but the grind to get the ever increasing amount of perks for just one character is so damn long now. The steeper you make that climb, the more people will go "Meh, too much time" and leave before they get hooked on the game, hehe, pun intended.
---
really? thats weird lol
---
Because you can recover to 95 percent which is a one tap. That's a straight fact that was a buff. All the RNG like opening up the game and removing dead ends from it and Lerys were survivor sided change.
---
IM AWAY AND CAN'T PLAY THE GAME
---
THAT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT. HIGH RANK KILLERS WHO TUNNEL AND CAMP ARE FUCKING COWARDS
---
He still needs a skin that gives him an Aris Bakhtanians beard.
---
As a Jane main I love this.
---
that's certainly never happened before /s
---
JUST FARM BP. IT ONLY TAKES LIKE 8 HOURS TO GET EITHER ONE IF YOU'RE AT LOW RANKS
---
aaaa these are always so cute
---
So you must be a survivor main who thinks that if i see someone coming up to unhook their friend i need to leave instead of go for hits. Real smart lmao. They both ran up together thinking i couldnt get them both.  One hit a trap the other got pulled from the body. All dced
---
Definitely would. But I still think survivors need more BP from different actions. I know they've addressed it some and I hope it helps a good deal. But I still think the amount you have to do to get even near 30k as a survivor is insane and mostly out of your control. As killer, I've done perfect games multiple times, even without aiming for it. Survivor, never hit 30k, ever.
---
PEOPLE ARE JUST GONNA WHINE ABOUT HIM BECAUSE IT'S ONE LESS KILLER THEY CAN JUST HOLD M1 ON AND THEN SAY "GG EZ CLAP" IN POST-GAME CHAT
---
True
---
[Redacted] And yet you still yikes. You are a very bold or chaotic being.
---
ok bye lol
---
What is an NPC mask?
---
I personally would much rather get chased by a Freddy than a Billy or Spirit. If you feel differently, who am I to try and tell you who you'd rather get chased by, lol. To each their own😊
---
nurse with addons is too strong for solo teams
---
i'm strongly against whistle emotes. your general idea is fine, but it would get abused until every one hated it.
---
Thank you❤️
---
Do you find Nurse or Spirit more fun to face?
---
Wait what? This is an actual bug in the game right now? Do they just see us all the time we're on gens or naw? 
---
The devs fix shit the killers complain about but not shit like this? Like wtf?
---
They're kinda gay
---
This Ace skin wasn't released yet, I'm sorry for the bad wording on my first reply. The ones that came out today and can already be found on the PC version of the game are the new Dwight skin (failed chute) and the new Huntress skin. Dwight and Huntress, both are 1080 auric cells or 21k something shards I believe.
---
seriously? there’s ash, laurie, quentin, and tapp who need to be paid for, unless their perks show up in the shrine, but the same goes for killers. plague, huntress and legion arent even pay to win - you can get them for shards. ghostface and michael are extremely balanced barring red tier addons, but thats how its supposed to be. pig isnt even that good after the introduction of end game collapse, and she wasnt much better beforehand anyways. camping teabagging and trolling have absolutely nothing to do with these characters or how they work, but it has everything to do with how the person behind the killer plays the game. it sounds like youre too whiny and entitled to learn counters, mindgames, looping, or strategies and instead of learning how to play, or at the very least taking out your anger on the killers who actually decide to abuse the game mechanics, youre taking it out on the characters for being ‘too op’ when really youre mad theyre abusable.
---
I wish I could disapprovingly shake my head at other survivors. Facepalming would be even better
---
LMAO
---
Me, too!
---
it is now our time to rise brothers
---
It might be, I think it didn't load her rig correctly so it used Jake's, I was in a call with the killer and them just to see it was client side so I quickly took a screenshot, directly after the rig corrected itself
---
I PERSONALLY DON'T WEAR COSMETICS ON SURVIVOR BUT THOSE WHO BUY COSMETICS SUPPORT THE GAME DEVS AND KEEP THE GAME ALIVE AND THIS GAME IS SO UNIQUE I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT DIE
---
1.Jane is my second main after Feng}
---
2.This Outfit is Fucking amazing}
---
-&gt;insta buy 😍😍
---
I like the healing idea. I think it would be cool to have it broken into like 5 stacks of 20% or even 10 of 10% instead of 4 stacks, because some games I get 4 stacks in like 5 minutes and other ones it's hard to even get one or two because it's only unhooks.
---
Yup he is actually mentally disabled 🤣🤣🤣
---
How did the guys die at the top? You couldn't have Mori'd them? Did they just bleed out into the dirt?
---
\*proceeds to miss the ruin skill checks\*

STONKS ▼
---
&gt;Ive felt frustrated more often as killer than survivor over all my playtime, and since you're more "held hostage" by toxicity as killer, it makes it that much more frustrating.
---
I don't play killer so I can't really compare the two personally. But I feel like with the addition of the Endgame you can stop them from stalling the game, and if they aren't doing gens you will end up just killing them even if it takes longer. When there are toxic survivors you still have the ability to play the game. If you're unlucky to be the target of a killer who is toxic or just happen to have a very bad day they can just facecamp you and you are literally unable to play the game.
---
I do think we can all agree there's just too much toxicity in the game though and it sucks no matter what side you're on.
---
I AGREE BUT MOST PEOPLE WHO RUN NEA COSMETICS ARE QUITE TOXIC AROUND RED RANKS
---
At rank 16, I'd say that 1/4 games (or even more commonly, maybe) I play the killer is a hardcore camper.  
---
With these players, I've noticed a couple things: 
---
1.  You can safely work on gens, usually even when they're extremely close to the killer.  He won't leave the hook.  You can usually get 2 or 3 done while he's standing there.
---
2.  These players almost always suck at chasing survivors.  I suck at looping, but I can almost always get away from them.
---
Because of how often this happens, I almost always have Kindred equipped.  If I'm the one who gets hooked, my whole team can see the idiot standing there beside me. 
---
I just sit back and smile, proceeding to struggle as long as I can while my team proceeds to turn on all the gens and escape.  Bonus points if the killer freaks out right at the end and finally heads to the gates so someone can get me off the hook.
---
You're running through the cornfield.
---
There is no one around as your team is rushing gens.
---
Suddenly, out of the corner of your eye you spot them.
---
T w o  p a l l e t s
---
No he doesn’t, they removed that
---
Few quality posts there though :(
---
Ur the best survivor main ever
---
Clown is fun to play. I personally enjoy playing as him though he isn't the strongest. I also am a huge fan of the Pig and Ghostface. Pig is ton of fun and nothing better than hitting an ambush hit. Surveillance is also one of the best underrated perks in the game. Seriously get it on the shrine this week if you don't want to pick her up. Alot of people say she is weak due to the changes with endgame collapse but, I think she is as strong as she was before. Ghostface is fun but has a high learning curve, he is better if he is played like pig instead of Myers.
---
Says the guy who called me mentally disabled two times in a row
---
Yes, s/he had no item the entire game.
---
I do agree with your point. For me, I don't like risk involved. Ruin might help me, but it also has a good chance of getting destroyed. There's even a chance, albeit a smaller one, that they'll just work through it with no problem. It's definitely a gamble that can sometimes pay off, but I don't think that gamble is worth it.
---
Also, this isn't an argument about the balance of killers, this is about a perk that is only directly affecting survivors. Survivors are in complete control over their ability to hit a skillcheck, so I think saying "good survivors will ___" is a fair argument. I've seen good survivors, and they will hit that skillcheck. If this were a post about how a killer is fair because good survivors can counter them I would understand your argument, but it's not.
---
i dont want to be rude or anything but.. your ghostface is prestiged so your not exactly a.. beginner with him?
---
Also mind you blinding isnt the problem, its the bm of dropping a pallet, and waiting for us to break it. The blind is completely trivial and just annoys us. It doesn't help you unless the killer sucks at listening. Blind us when carrying a survivor is fine, blind us when we are getting near a gen to allow a teammate to finish it off. That is fine, its serves a purpose and helps yall. Blinding us while breaking a pallet just gives us a smaller gap to close once we are out of the animation
---
Everyone needs a hobby. Some people play tennis, I erode human souls
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I got BBQ when it was in the shrine last and despite the grind I still don't have it on any killers. :/
---
just don’t heal lol
---
When I see a nurse or billy with ruin, I see a killer main who doesn't believe in themselves
---
nurse cos 90% cant play her but i dont think spirit is that bad
---
Buff dream snares, or scrap them entirely in exchange for something else?
---
Legitimate question. I just know we've got two dudes doing snare techs already.
---
leatherface's are drooling over that insidious
---
"bold of you to assume I use my eyes"
---
It was taken today.
---
They’ve been ignoring the really bad killers though, unfortunately. I’m glad Freddy got lifted from trash tier, but the EGC changes and concurrent nerfs to her kit just let Pig fall in his place. Trapper, Wraith, and Clown are in a very sorry state as well. They’ve also just let Billy reign OP for ages now with no signs of stopping him, lol.
---
you always get random perks like this... i really wish that i got the teachable perk upgrades instead of these perks that i will never use.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Eh you lost like 8 seconds. Not a loss
---
We gotta write a song about how we do not diddle survivors!
---
Someone raised you right
---
I don't see the difference (not sarcasm please help dad)
---
He wasn’t using the three GF perks, and we don’t know if he even got merciless.
---
Check the watermark
---
What do you mean "fixed enduring" ? what changes were made?
---
You can heal with a brown medkit and sloppy butcher. Items have CHARGS not SECONDS: With sloppy butcher, those charges are wasted slower because the time required is longer, but you still need 16 seconds.
---
I’m highly blind aparantly lol I don’t know how I didn’t notice that sorry
---
What people mean when they say self-care wastes time is, you are "wasting" 32s or 40s self-healing rather than progressing a generator that only takes 80s to complete, almost half the time worth of gen progress.
---
Also, during those 32s chances are someone is looping the killer and burning pallets, which is how killer's progress the game in their favor. The "optimal" way of playing would be to use that looping time to progress generators. 
---
Another scenario are survivors choosing to self-heal while someone is hooked and there is an opportunity to perform a save rescue because the killer is chasing another survivor. 
---
Self-Care is really good if used correctly. 
---
1v2 scenario and your teammate is hooked? Self-Care is your only shot in getting that guy if the killer is patrolling the area.
---
In case people didnt know; in jungle gyms, the real pallet will always be on the side where the window isnt on
---
How effective is quick and quiet?
---
I was an idiot, yes. I prestiged him cause I thought the Monochromatic skin would be the second prestige :| didn't know it came when you bought the full DLC. 
---
Trust me, my rank (10-9) reflects my skill with GF. Look at my sorry ass perks and you'll know I didn't prestige him cause I played him a lot :))
---
At this point I've seen players think it's just mandatory gameplay. 
---
Have seen them genuinely confused to be told teabagging is disrespectful.
---
when she gets hurt it really sounds like moaning too lmao
---
How is lol no a legitimate reason to start bombarding me with down votes with no reasonable expectation?
---
 You seem to forget who started this, ill give you a hint, everything I've said after "no" is 100,000% reactionary to the fuckers like you.

---
The survivors literally get everything they fucking want. But when the killers ask for one thing, survivors say we're "Whining" the DBD community is such a toxic shithole. And you're an example for it.
---
Hey look buddy, I'm an engineer. That means I solve problems, not problems like "What is beauty?" Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don't work... Use more gun. Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil' old number designed by me, built by me, and you best hope... Not pointed at you.
---
Wouldnt say its completely countering the main aspect. Its still on cooldown and freddy still has the gen teleport.
---
OOO doesnt really counter stealth killers, its a tradeoff. You see the killer, but the killer doesnt need to waste time to look for survivors
---
Only if you're a Killer.
---
At least it is hid between grass
---
Yet to see a survivor post or anything about Freddy other than these memes saying survivors are complaining that seem to be every other post since his release into the ptb...
---
Freddy as he is in the ptb is definitely great, can't wait to play as and against him. The only thing I may see them doing is tweaking a few numbers up or down, but i doubt anything major will be done to him again.
---
That sucks. I wondered about the jakebun specifically since I saw it in the store once, then not, then again a few months later. Shoulda bought it when I had the chance lol
---
Some killer abilities are smaller than others. Clowns is massively effective at what it does and Freddy has two mediocre ones. Freddy has the snare/pallets to make chases the tiniest bit quicker and the teleport to get around the map but the nurses one ability helps her get around the map and make chases short so that’s why.
---
oh ok. sorry for my misunderstanding
---
Agreed. And it's completely fair as ghost face to give retaliatory teabags.
---
Kate’s my favorite survivor and I’m glad she receives a new cosmetic outfit, Im definitely buying this !!
---
I’d say Pig’s nerfs were a lot more severe than they seemed. It took one of her viable setups (out of her, what, three?) and completely trashed it. She’s at best an M1 killer that can be a pain in the ass, but 90% of her add-ons are worthless and Ambush is genuinely trash. Girlie needs her endgame build back (just treat survivors with traps on their heads like downed/hooked survivors so the EGC timer slows down), or some really significant buffs. Otherwise she’s doomed in bottom tier.
---
You realize you need to traverse the map for gens *at some point*, right? What if, and now listen to me carefully, you happened to find a way to be awake while doing that? Which means you could **see** which pallets are used and which (real) ones are still standing. Now I'll leave the rest for you to think about.
---
I'd even say top 3. You have to play Nurse, Spirit or Billy. Maybe just maybe also Huntress if you're can hit all of your hatchets and of course if you have the addons for her. But it just feels like a chore.
---
On the survivor side... This is exacltly the type of stuff I'm dealing with in my survivor games. And the worst part about it is that I just can't escape this low rank hell because of rank update errors.
---
IMO it feels like everyone knows that these issues exist yet nobody gives a damn about making the devs fix them.
---
Exactly, last night I went up against the same killer 3 times in a row. (Literally the same player, character, and build) The rank differences in those matches were crazy. They were 11 but the survivor side was between 8 and 18 rank in those games. Matchmaking has been crazy on console since the last patch. I wonder if they have some sort of flex rule where it relaxes the requirements of rank the longer you are in a que. During the last double point weekend, I had waited 10+ minutes to go against a group of 18s as a 11 rank killer.
---
Who would want to take credit for this low effort post that you butchered the fuck out of the format.
---
Sloppy Butcher makes it take 40 seconds, in both cases. You can full-heal yourself with a brown Med-Kit through Sloppy Butcher. Opening a chest takes 10 seconds.
---
Other than that, I agree with your point: Self-Care is still a strong perk, being the only way to reliably heal yourself if you are not bringing a Med-Kit, which is definitely very impactful, especially in solo queue games.
---
That's fair. I got salted out by consecutive toxic SWFs for daring to mess around with Wraith and went into my next match ready to tunnel with Nurse at the first sign of teabagging.
---
When people hurt you, you want to hurt them back. When it seems like they're always going to hurt you, you want to hurt them FIRST.
---
still a fun perk to use in my opinion
---
'cause in high ranks you have all the good swf who aren't meant to be balanced.
---
most people that use head on dont try to use it very seriously. most of us just use it for funs
---
&gt; They’ve been ignoring the really bad killers though
---
Since when are you playing the game ?
---
But that wasn't a direct nerf to HER. Just an undesired side effect of making the game better.
---
Goddammit, I just finished getting everything on Meg after I already finished Jake...
---
Now I gotta work on Kate.
---
I'm just saying, a lot of people mindlessly throw down pallets
---
I clearly stated my rank in my post, but it seems you ignored it and I can see why lol. When I said “and even purple,” I am acknowledging not all are very amazing at the game, but the people who I know that are consistent purples all claim they never complain about Freddy because they know all they have to do is loop him. I will respectfully ignore you now because I get a feeling that you, indeed, are someone that knows very little. Have a good one bud👍🏾.
---
Don’t speak of Jane like that, curves are beauty
---
Just give me my enduring already please ty
---
Nobody is saying that Moris and other things aren't BS but there's no reason to use that to devalue other concerns.
---
I'm just tired of Billy's
---
It's just so frustrating when you try to chainsaw a survivor and it stops for no damn reason. Although it does make survivors cocky sometimes which can lead to easy downs.
---
You can't convince me everyone playing this game is even technically an adult, let alone a homeowner.
---
How does one check ram health? I'm having this issue too and have found others but I've tried all of their solutions and nothing has worked yet
---
i know but it doesn’t let you go down to completely sane
---
Nothing. Ghostface was shit at the start because a survivor could shake their cam and get him. Then they fixed it but made the issue that revealing him was unreliable as you could reveal him from across the map behind seven trees. But couldn't when practically sniffing his ass. So they fixed it by making the detection zone larger which while it still has questionable moments, definitely made him more fair and less "what the fuck i stared at you for a minute why aren't you fucking revealed?"
---
People just act like he was gutted upon release when all that happened was him being fixed
---
I’m a killer main anyway so i haven’t established a survivor culture outside of rapidly crouching to say “hey” or “I see you” or something. I don’t do it after pallets or to be toxic. It’s just what I do. A quick double crouch then I leave.
---
It should be like snapping out of it.
---
Long as he isn't wearing kewpie dolls, we're good.
---
We ALL play dbd. We get it pc have more possibilities blah blah blah but at the end of the day we're ALL in the fog. So stop, get some help
---
This is me when I verse survivors at my rank :P if the last survivor is a Kate Denson, I give them the hatch, or if the last survivor is a Laurie and I'm Micheal, I give them the hatch :) also if I destroy them and I know ill pip anyway, I'll give them the hatch
---
As somebody who plays swf a lot, there is a lot of very valuable information that passes around. Like where on the map they are, or if they're distracted in a chase, or if they're coming back to you. swf is pretty strong, because otherwise you're totally blind
---
You should leave that survivor alone and find someone you can actually catch.
---
Oh, no. Don't go lowering expectations. We have enough problems stemming from just accepting awful behaviour IRL.
---
Some people are just garbage, but we should still try to not act like hate-chimps.
---
As a complete survivor main and horribly inexperienced killer, allow me to chime in!
---
Ghostface's main power revolves around him locking on to people and one hitting them, therefore if you're using Ghostface effectively, you aren't using Thanatophobia to its full potential, right? Unless you never lock on and use the lack of terror radius to sneak up on survivors and get more hits in to build the buff's effect.
---
At least, that's the way I see it? Or maybe I just really dislike Thanato as a survivor and am subconsciously trying to dissuade people from it, I don't know.
---
A good killer playing killers that arent nurse billy and spirit should have to tools to beat a good swf. A very good player cannot beat a top swf team without the top tier killers
---
Yup, a slugging, camping bum killer. Only way you get kills bum.
---
&gt;The survivors literally get everything they fucking want.
---
Give a recent example of this happening. I’ll wait.
---
that reminds me of some mid-rank matches i had against wraith, and i guess they weren't very good, because they were binging and bonging all over the place.
---
it was almost non-stop. apparently if the survivor got more than a few meters away, they'd just bong to get that speed boost, only to bing right back in after a couple of meters.
---
For context in the lobby all the font was weird and some textures were missing, I hovered over the offerings on the loading screen and it never went away. On the end screen it didn’t load past everyone running and I didn’t get any blood points.
---
TLDR: Offering didn’t disappear all game and I lost all blood points
---
He's a regular killer with stealth abilities, not a killer that relies on stealth ala Wraith whose only ability is stealth.
---
I find the dream snares ok. They could use a buff but I would much rather a buff go too the teleport. It takes way too damn long to teleport xD.
---
Literally everything.
---
If there’s one thing I learned about the dbd community is that everyone is gay, ask anyone here and they’ll without a doubt want shirtless Myers or Jeff etc or if it’s not gay we’ll find a way to make it lol /s but for real I think you’re thinking to much into it
---
No, I know, those phantom connections are awful. But then they actually did attempt to address them once before, and it led to Billy's chainsaw having some wild 360° "cone" registration that would make backrevs impossible to miss, and create some other ridiculous interactions, like pseudo-flicks after sawing.
---
I just don't trust them to actually fix that issue without messing up his saw, good or bad.
---
Go away please
---
Elaborate
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Playing killer from rank 20 to 12 is just so easy. Every game you play it's very easy to get 4 kills. You can not balance a game basing your decision on rank 1 and swf. If you really have the hours you say you have, you can easily understand that your nerf idea were insane and trash.
---
hot
---
Lmao found the toxic survivor. Hope to see you in the fog m8
---
I do agree that there should be some warning to fake pallettes, but wasting pallettes doesn't help either
---
I'll skip going over ruin and noed as others have said enough about them but, I have seen a ton of Ghostfaces running Hex: The Third Seal as of late. The blindness affects all aura reading abilities, except for Jigsaw Boxes and Pools of Devotion. They are running it as a counter to object of obsession which is a great counter to Ghostface and other stealth characters.

---
I actually had a similar issue earlier today as gf. This Kate kept looping and chasing me around. After about 30 sec of no hits I just left and went to find another survivor. Later in the game I was able to chase her no problem because her teammates had used all the pallets. I know it sucks to “give up” but it will all work out in the end
---
So it released today? Hell yeah thanks for the help!
---
I mean you can just keep queuing and if you happen to get into his lobby just dodge it, eventually he would lose interest and if the dude really does that I doubt he has that big of a viewer base. But yeah is a little rude.
---
It does it enough to where you can play the game normally. Sometimes it'll do the random placed skill checks but if you're already looking for them it's not hard. I just try to keep track of where my madness is during the game.
---
True, fair enough.
---
He don't keep his original look with that power. He copy the other survivors looks to trick the others. But don't think this will work on swf or have a good map pressure. It will be fun but very useless if there is nothing else added to it.
---
Trapper would be totally balanced IMO if he didn't have to go pick his traps up. Hag can lay down traps that she starts with, granted they don't impair your movement like bear traps but still. It's terribly time consuming to go pick up a trap, then go place it especially without add ons.
---
You mean like 3 hours to know everything about his power that it S u C k S.
---
killer is in an exponentially better spot than it has ever been.
---
I like it, it will allow you to occasionally fast vault without making noise.
---
Paired with stuff like Lithe and Dance With Me can make for some quick and hard-to-follow escapes.
---
There's some real solid truth here.
---
Think of the game like a chess match, sometimes you have to lose some pawns early in the match to get the queen or king later on.
---
What does yellow mean?
---
But camping puts you at a disadvantage. You're losing gen cover and BP to get one kill.
---
This is the best comment by far
---
THANK YOU, IN MY RAGE I FORGOT MYSELF, HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY
---
The last part of your name is wrong.
---
I love getting hate mail playing as killer. I always just respond "the entity is pleased."
---
Top pic = Red ranks and occasionally purple
---
Bottom pic = everything else.
---
Actually is, she is the top, anything over it would be OP ( nurse is OP with some add-ons), and anything below her is or balanced or underpowered.
---
Pallet blinding? Lol ok buddy.
---
Jumpscare myers with the scratched mirror and that map is so amazing.
---
This is the worst way to share a video, wow.
---
Frankly, I don't see that as a bad option. It's also not like they can't have preferred queuing for dlc owners
---
Idk man, “I ain’t got time to bleed” is pretty high on my list.
---
Although I gotta say, Freddy’s is marginally better.
---
I really think it's just a matter of capability. Killers can simply do less in the game, barring the top meta Killers who got there based on their movement.
---
So it's not that Killers are better people on average, it's just that Survivors have more power/freedom (especially in SWF) and more ways to behave toxically.
---
Of course, there are also 4 Survs to 1 Killer, so while cross-Survivor toxicity happens, Killers mathematically just get more, too.
---
FUCKING REWORK THE PIG IS A SHIT KILLER AND IS SAD BECAUSE THE KILLER POWER IS FUCKING INTRESTING BUT ITS EXECUTED IN A SUPER LAME WAYYYYYY DO A REWORK LIKE FREDDY ADD OTHER THINGS THAT CAN HELP HER OUT LIKE OTHER TRAPS THE SAW FRANCHISE IS FULL OF FUCKING GOOD CONCEPTS FOR TRAPS FUUUUUU

I too wish he could carry 2 trap by default. Trapper is one of my favorites, but he is very difficult to play at high rank. Honestly, I think he's mostly fine against solo queue players. The problem is that SWF can instantly communicate where all of the traps are. While SWF is strong against all killers, I think it hurts trapper more than most others. Without anything else to fall back on, it really sucks if they coordinate to disarm the traps. You become an m1 killer.

I get what you're saying. I don't want them to try to make every killer mechanically super complicated. Maybe the better solution is to change the game's objective progression in a way that offers killers more strategy in how they play. There's rarely time to be doing anything other than chasing down survivors, and it ends up feeling like you don't really get to make many decisions during gameplay as killer.
---
Good times.
---
Just hide in a locker 4head
---
Honestly trappers' traps aren't strong, maybe compared to other killers traps, but even then they are at best tied with hags and easier to destroy. Trapper is known as "Man with Machete" because his power is often useless in game.
---
Yes, a lot of players are bad in this game.  
---
I am not saying that camping is the right decision to make.
---
I am saying that it "can be" the right decision in certain cases.
---
I've killed countless red-rank swf's that played bad and hook dived a camping LF (while the exit gates were open) because they tried their best to save their buddy.
---
I mean, I would consider myself to be a survivor that plays optimally. But I too sometimes when playing with my buddys say: Fuck it - and just go and take a risk that I shouldn't while facing a camper.
---
And to get back to your point: It can't be toxic since you're still following your objective of killing a survivor.
---
An "objective" is involved.  
---
For something to be toxic it has to cause harm AND not follow any objective related to the game at all. 
---
(Like for example taunting the killer, or insulting someone in the post game chat).
---
Would honestly be a good change to the perk. Paired with those perks obviously there would be no escape but the perks regression usually isn’t enough to hit a survivor that just dodged you. It’s enough to get rid of the punishment of that miss.
---
Well, most of the survivors he go against is low rank. And for shutting down loops, clown is just better.
---
I HATE THE DWIGHT THAT BLOCKED ME FROM ENTERING A LOCKER AND USING MY HEAD ON AND GETTING ME KILLED
---
I had a lot of fun once I started playing this game but it just kept getting worse and worse as time passed unfortunately.
---
I think both Clown and Trapper could use some QOL improvements. I posted the idea yesterday in someone elses thread that I think Trapper should start with all of his traps active. I also like the idea that he could reset his traps while they are still on the ground instead of having to pick them up and then put them back down in a good spot. 
---
Clown is a bit more tricky on how to improve. Maybe add a caustic meter that the longer you spend in his clouds it pushes you down in healthstates, sort of like the sickness mechanic for the PLague. Or allow him to laydown bottles to trap areas so if a survivor runs over it, it triggers and applies the slow and vision effects.
---
Yeah nobody here is gonna miss you. Take care :)
---
Ppl downvoting bc they are so deeply in the closet with their racism.
---
Broken pieces (for now at least) dissappear when you place the fake ones
---
Trapper (since I last played him) also breaks his neck every time he works with traps. Specifically it is resetting them or the initial placement, but for some reason it jerks your camera really low.
---
Ok so if a player wants to use the Basement build then they should be treated with tbagging even though their using a strategy built into the game?
---
Is there a video on the leaked sounds? Hellraiser would be pretty cool
---
Haha you wont ever see me. Im rank 1 buddy. Youll never make it there playing how you play. I guarantee you didnt even pip that game. You got 8K bloodpoints lmfao bum
---
I'm pretty sure there's a sound, that visual heartbeat is just if you're playing in public and you can't have sound turned on.
---
I may be wrong but I believe the latest bhvr video on freddy states Windows of opportunity showed the fake pallets aura as well as the real ones so you couldn't tell the difference.
---
Found the troll
---
Typical survival response
---
You have to sign up for it. Just look up dbd mobile and you should find their website.
---
Thats the thing, she was in front of me, its like if my knife hit through her
---
I understand that. Truly I do. It's just like you know every killer is humanoid scratch maybe the hag in that regard. It just Eirks me a bit. Kinda like if legion was a survivor
---
To be honest if he could just teleport to your spawn i think that would be a bit frustrating, considering you generally spawn very close to a generator.
---
I mean you counter killers like the Huntress or Clown by instantly using the pallet instead of waiting for the last -stun- moment.
---
This could work with Freddy aswell.   
---
Don't wait for him and try to stun him, just immediatly use it.
---
Ik, but i had noed so i went for the swing
---
There's literally no threads on reddit front couple of pages asking for Freddy nerfs. I've only been playing since after Clown release, but Legion didn't get nerfed, was just never good. Spirit is top tier. Plague was never top tier, and Ghostface didn't get nerfs, just fixes. So I disagree. If you bother to read survivor main comments, a majority of them just complain about the stale gameplay from high ranks only consisting of 3 killers. But okay, you guys just keep living in your bubble.
---
Meg here to say a leatherface tried that with the mori. Jokes on him
---
I think everyone thought that
---
You failed twice then.
---
Too bad I play on console and will never be able to use these :’)
---
I put exactly one thought into it lol.
---
pissing
---
Forums, DBD streams and YouTube videos are a hotbed of whining. Give the complaints time, they will get here too. This entire situation is feeling so very familiar.
---
Yeah, Spirit is considered second best killer right now and is a bit overpowered IMO. She has no vaulting animation, can use her power for chases or map pressure, and frankly passive phasing is just a stupid power. If they removed that it would be a lot more fun to play against her.
---
If you are doing better with wraith then you probably just don't have the mechanics/game sense down on spirit. My best killer is trapper, even though he is generally considered garbage, because most of the good killers require better mouse control than I have.
---
I think so, too.
---
But wil he be stronger than a Nurse, Spirit or Billy?   
---
I don't think so.  
---
He might be on that Huntress/Hag level though if you swap his snares for pallets.
---
Or maybe he'll be a bit under them.
---
i'm not dev (obviously) but i wonder if it has something to do with the way the hits are detected. perhaps the detection is from left to right even though most killers use their right hands?
---
just a thought. i don't know.
---
Exactly. We've danced this dance before. It'll be ironic if they nerf him so hard that he's worse than he was before, rendering the rework entirely pointless.
---
Never let reality get in the way of free karma.
---
Too bad your toxic. I sent them all gg after. We could have had a nice discussion. Despite what you think i didnt camp. You high ranks always get pissed when iwned by a low lvl killer lmao
---
don't be a fucking prick just because they were running NOED.
---
i agree with you 'cause i want to face something new and have a challenge, not the same shitty ass Spirits and Billies (i play on console so i don't see many Nurses) because those are the only viable killers at red ranks, otherwise you'll get destroyed 🙄
---
i also want B-C tier killers to be fun to play as and against without using strong add-ons
---
Jane moaned at least this loud
---
I usually do the same with Spirit.  
---
Is it better than the spirit? ==&gt; S Tier, maybe OP.  
---
Is it as good as the spirit? ==&gt; Balanced.  
---
Is it worse than the spirit? ==&gt; Needs a buff.  
---
Currently only Spirit is as good as the Spirit.  
---
Nurse is better.
---
Billy might be slightly weaker than Spirit.  
---
And the rest needs a buff.
---
unfortunately we cannot :(
---
And then he will write "NICE NOED n00b Killer"
---
They are weak in the sense that they have a lot of counterplay, but strong in terms of impact when you do get them to work. Catching a healthy survivor can turn a whole game around. Even if you see the trap, running to a trapped pallet will usually still result in a free hit. Some of his add-ons are very strong, and will make the traps a real threat.  
---
The problem is when you go against a coordinated team, especially SWF. Survivors having access to 4 peoples' worth of info hurts him a lot. I've seen good trappers pull off some big brain plays at rank 1, but overall he is weaker there.
---
I mostly agree but I don't see how making ghostface twice as easy to reveal + nerfing his addons is a "fix" that made him better.
---
Everyone is right that the new rework makes Freddy very good and more usable now but I will miss the old Freddy as I actually liked that better just knowing his character.
---
The dreamworld, which is the premise of his whole character just seems like the normal world now and it doesn’t really matter that your in the dream world unless the killer has certain add ons. Before the dreamworld was a very powerful place for Freddy and the survivors wanted to get out of it as fast as possible because of the default slow progression and aura reading at a distance. Now the only point of leaving the dreamworld is so you don’t have to mess with snares or fake pallets. Now especially with the ability to see Freddy in the real world it just seems pointless between the two.
---
Also it just feels cheap for Freddy to just hit someone to put them to sleep. That doesn’t really make sense knowing the character and how he works in the movies. Plus in the dreamworld, that should be HIS world and make him powerful. Now just feels like a normal killer that can teleport. If they would have just added that to the previous Freddy I think that would have been better.
---
Because the devs dont give a fuck
---
I don't think the Killers know how to use them yet, just like Survivors don't know how to counter Freddy yet. More time is needed.  
---
Also, if his traps are buffed, then what is even the point of the Clown anymore? Freddy would just be a better clown with higher slows and teleportation.
---
I switched from Kate main to Jeff main cuz he is metal, but now Ill just go back to mommy Kate...
---
I'm not sure where to ask but do you have ANY plans for Plague? I keep checking the patchnotes everytime you guys release something and everytime she's missing on there. 
---
Not only does she have gamebreaking bugs (quite literally, her puke can CRASH the game), she also is extremely unrewarding to play as and gets genrushed to hell. When will you finally buff her?
---
ah, then killer still had the advantage.  just find the hatch and wait for the timer.  sad.  Lag switchers need to DC then never play the game again
---
How are dream pallets the only thing that might make him viable? Because free hits?
---
Killers want better map coverage and ways to deal with looping and you get both of those with gen teleports and snares.
---
The gen teleport has no limit on range and that saves you a lot of time does it not?
---
Snares slow you down effectively countering loop areas and will slow down your window vaults as well.
---
It is still completely broken.  
---
I've been "maining" him since release and every second or third game I'll be atleast revealed once when I should not.
---
Sometimes the person in the basement is revealing me even though I am above him.
---
Other times I am getting revealed through walls.
---
And it's buggy on both sides. A lot of times someone is standing close to me and looking directly at me and the revealing isn't even starting.  
---
But yes. They 'fixed' it. But 'fixing' meant doubling the area at the center of your screen which you need to focus him with to reveal him.  
---
That's a nerf that didn't make him better.
---
Before the rework, Freddy wasn't even an M1 killer when you were awake. He was literally nothing. Adrenaline fucked him more before his rework, actually.
---
Ok i knew somthing was off about you, you obv dont know much about the game. When people dc you get enough points to safety pip for 1. For 2 you have to be some kid trying to get a rise out of people online. Get over it. I didnt camp. And the game lasted 3 minutes. Thats why i didnt 8k. I hooked 1 guy. Downed 2 and all dced. I let the last one go. Can you even read at all?
---
Part of Freddy's kit is being invisible to awake survivors from a certain distance away from them. So yeah, he is a stealth killer. 
---
And none of those are his stealth ability, so.... what was your point, again?
---
Absolutely
---
Honestly. Like bitch what are you doing I’m running his ugly ass and you’re healing instead of doing the last gen?
---
This is pretty much my same post but instead of killer chase music it’s swf nice edits tho
---
Hook emotes: Come get me and dont even try its an insidious Leatherface basement.
---
One where we can flail our arms when running for comedic value
---
I have noticed a tendency for people to yell "NERF" at things before they even like, attempt to adapt to them.
---
You're the one bitching about spirit.l, but are unwilling to learn to counter her. Big brain logic right there.
---
So she'll be needing a buff or a rework. Oooo, what if they also rework her map like they did Freddy? Make it even more trap filled and spooky feeling.
---
To be fair, EGC was an amazing addition to the game. But you can't deny that getting a trap on your head during it would've basically been an easy kill.
---
Me and my swf group is mostly making weird jokes while someone is on the hook begging to get rescued . We suck lmao.
---
Thanks. Didn't know that. I like to spam it for fun.
---
What killer are you?
---
Ruin or not gens get done fast nowadays. Partly because Ruin is overused to death (for the obvious reason though) and so Survivors have gotten used to powering through it. Also the frame rate was recently improved on console which makes hitting Ruin skill checks much easier than before.
---
Seeing 3 people in a row in these comments use the Romani slur is a trip, just pure ignorance.
---
It happens fairly frequently actually. People tend to be very cocky when they think they’ll win, I’ve gotten like 7 kills today as Billy from charging people trying to teabag me inches from the escape line, lol.
---
At this point it’s better to assume a survivor will do some dumb shit to try and salt on you than playing it safe.
---
He's doing a double tea bag if that makes any difference. When someone points at me as a Survivor or Killer I just laugh.
---
😂😂😂😂😂. Spoken like a true 8k bum camping killer.
---
You're sad. Go outside. Pet a dog. Chill the fuck out.
---
The shape
---
Huh
---
I can't tell you what to change untill you say what killer do you play.
---
They fixed it by making it more reliable than before. But i even said that it still has issues that need to be ironed out so that the mechanic isn't so weird with how it works.
---
Noooo I love him. So fun to play against
---
Fake, but would be really cool. Only thing bothering me from this "concept" is the lack of a Killer Power...
---
I think, if they do buff the traps, is to either let them do something out of a chase (my personal is a 1 second snare in place) or make them have a bigger area and last longer.
---
You conveniently forgot the main benefit of not running self-care:  freeing up a perk slot.
---
Asa ghostface in red ranks i can say that that is great work
---
Then with plague they just yeeted the whole stealth idea with Infectious fright, one of the best Nurse perks rn.
---
I think the point of balance being referred to here is essentially a linear scale of strength, not a direct one-to-one correlation of every aspect of their kits and playstyle. 
---
If, on a scale, a Killer could be measured as stronger than the Nurse, who is currently considered the strongest and possibly too strong,  then that Killer is also probably too strong.
---
The way in which their kits create this strength is a different discussion which would have more nuanced measurements, but as a shorthand 'is this Killer op?' the Nurse makes for a great ceiling of measurement.
---
Would need to be at least a bit faster than survivors at the beginning.
---
Survivors dont always get what we ask for, and regardless of someone asking for examples and you giving shit "examples" (which I dont remember anyone asking for. I can just state some random shit as fact too. "We should be able to see survivors more. *BBQ and Chili added*" see how dumb you look? Learn how to source shit), that doesn't disprove what I said at all. Everybody bagged on the devs to fix freddy and when they did you guys still arent happy.
---
It's also no secret that survivors get nerfed way more than killers because the devs have joked about that in the freddy dev stream when mentioning the pallet value changes so even they know.
---
My point has nothing to do with dbd at all anyway. You guys basically begged your parents for help fixing up your beater car, and when they went out and bought you a new car entirely, you told them you dont like the color. You're a fuckin joke lol
---
Fun fact, most of the other guys I’ve dated have played dbd. It’s funny because in my own anecdotal experience 90% of people that I know who play this game are gay.
---
Or make the developers more killer sided, and not survivor. As of now, the devs are AFRAID to release a strong killer into the game, and being bashed by the survivor mains (majority of the community) so much. 
---
Thereby, it is much easier for them to nerf the killer into an oblivion, rather to deal with the unhappy community. 
---
Example — how ridiculously underpowered Ghostface, Legion (?) and Ghost were on PBE, and even when released to the life servers. Only after weeks of bragging, they were finally given some life-quality buffs/tweaks to WORK properly (some still don’t compared to their premise upon release — legion cough cough).
---
Ok ima change the title no one understands the circle
---
I know, but you could still easily put them to asleep and also slow down door opening since there was very little ways to wake up outside of self care or finding someone else.
---
I'm not saying he was good, but his power is literally non-existent at the end game in his current form, no gens to teleport to, having to wait 60 seconds for survivors to fall asleep or chase them as a standard M1 killer with no power to put them back asleep. See what I'm getting at? The other half of his power doesn't even function when everyone is awake, and CAN'T function until you hit that 1 person, while the first half of his power is completely gone since there's no more gens.
---
Get it? He still had power pre-rework, regardless of how weak it was, in this form he will virtually have nothing. That's what I'm getting at
---
The dev's even said.. anywhere a pallet would spawn is where you can place it!
---
Personally,it's the best build I have at the moment
---
It’s not just a hairstyle
---
Funny. I cant even get my swing to activate when I’m blinded mid chase.
---
They need to make the breathing louder on him. Almost gave the poor guy a heart attack xD
---
As long as it stands on two legs, I don't see the problem.
---
&gt;What the fuck am I supposed to do on Haddonfield as killer?
---
Kill.
---
Pig is no where near how bad freddy was. She slows down the game and can stealth. And if the survivor is unlucky, die to a trap.
---
Or better yet
---
Swf: "I'm going to throw in a map offering, any preference?"
---
Me: "Yeah I'm running Balanced Landing so anything but MacMillian"
---
Swf: yeah sure....*Throws in MacMillian Offering*
---
Me: You SOB
---
Swf: *maniacal laughter*
---
This game so far seems like a cesspool of people with ego problems tbh. I even ignored thier friend when they stopped moving I thought she was afk. This game is like an outlet for these people to try and be the big tough guy
---
Why?
---
no fucking shit?
---
Think its safe to say imma be a little broke after it comes out.  Still need to get Ghostface :D
---
Enduring
---
As a nurse main, nurse is op.
---
Well when a nurse is good try surviving. I dont think nurse ia a point of balence.
---
So first: It's not free hits.  
---
You have to meet a lot of conditions first.
---
Dream pallets only work if you're allready asleep which means: You basically have to get the first hit without any power at all. (I won't count the TP because it doesn't give you any advantage in a chase. It's for map coverage/gen pressure mostly).  
---
After that you still have to place the pallet/lead the survivor to the area with those fake pallets.
---
Plus a good survivor might also keep track of pallets or notice fake pallets (Since a lot of spawns shouldn't have a pallet because they'll be right next to a window or something else).  
---
And then you could still just use common counterplay tactics which are used against huntress and clown and don't rely on last-second pallet stuns and use them way before the killer reaches you.  
---
It's easy to counter that power. It's way stronger than what most killers have, but it BY NO MEANS NEEDS ANY NERF. 
---
It's good where it is.   
---
The gen teleport has a loooong cooldown. It start's on cooldown (you can't use it when the round starts) and since usually most people should be awake it can only be used once per 45 seconds.  
---
You can't use it to surprise people since it will give a 3-5 second long warning.
---
It's just a nice little extra.  
---
And the snare is shit. It's miles weaker than clown gas. Pallets is where it's at. Good killer and survivor streamers allready showed that by using common anti-clown counter tactics you basically just can ignore this power.
---
If you post stuff like this on reddit, people are bound to try and trigger you man.
---
Funny cause everyone was just laughing calling him a garbage killer weeks ago 🙄😂
---
New Killer: Dr. Mantis Toboggan
---
Weapon: Toe Knife
---
Add-ons: Rum Ham, Monster Condoms, Trashcan, Egg
---
Huntress is free, and plague and legion can both be earned in-game without spending money. At least be accurate when you're complaining about paid dlc
---
Yeah I step in them sometimes too. I only play trapper when I play killer and I just wish he started with 8-10 traps. They’d have to rework his add-ons and stuff. Maybe even have him pick up ones that are tripped or that he wants to move obviously
---
Agreed, looping should be fixed. As in, it should be as important to find the survivor by the killer, as to catch him. 
---
About the trapper — not sure. He should be buffed (making his traps invisible or something, but reducing his MS to nurse’s. Now he is too weak).
---
CONCEPT I LITERALLY JUST CAME UP WITH: HOOKS ARE REPLACED WITH TRAPS. OTHER SURVIVORS CAN HELP YOU OUT OF THEM, BUT IT TAKES LONGER AND MIGHT REVEAL POSITION WITH SKILL CHECKS, MAYBE THEY GET INJURED DOING IT WITH AN ADD-ON CUZ THEY CUT THEIR HAND OR W/E
---
THIS IS PROBABLY A TERRIBLE IDEA BALANCE WISE BUT I'M SLEEPY AS FUCK AND IT SOUNDED NEAT IN MY HEAD
---
With borrowed time i was using it as an example. With it you can take a protection hit and live, letting you get MoM stacks easier.
---
You hit the nail on the head there. But you can at least take some solace in knowing that if you kill them and beat them, you ruined their fantasy for a while
---
The game has an interesting thing about it- it makes people angry and emotional.
---
You can see that as a bad thing, but a lot of players find frustrating matches they wish they could just simply be better in.
---
Especially when the other team does something cheesy or something that feels scummy. For instance, when a killer camps you, you wish you can sometimes just be a better survivor that ran them for a while or did more to fight back. Being upset that way makes you want to have more tricks up your sleeves to have something to throw back in the same scenarios.
---
I've heard the game be described this way: at its best, it's mindgames and outplays. At its worst, DBD is about being the biggest piece of shit you can possibly be.
---
... But people like that. :)
---
Fucking love the new freddy
---
Middle finger
---
God Pallet; something a Claudette is drawn to and will not be afraid to drop the second they come within reach of it regardless of how many gens are remaining or how close the killer actually is to them.
---
but before the rework in the dream world he was just an M1 killer who could find survivors if they lost him in a chase
---
Got a link to yours? Couldn't find it in your profile
---
I'm honestly thinking of getting them so I don't have to see their icons haunting my bloodweb
---
Pretty much nobody at a high rank uses self care, so I think the "hipsters" are the ones actually running it. High rank players know better than to waste time healing in any fashion that isnt adrenaline.
---
So there is now way to tell if the pallet is real or fake?
---
If not I guess there could be some legitimate complaints/concerns.
---
But it's only been about 1 day of Freddy being in the PTB. Everybody calm down and allow the players in the PTB and Devs come to the best possible solution.
---
(Also it doesn't hurt to look up videos of popular DBD streams and see what Freddy is truly like for yourself.)
---
P.S i like the general feel of Freddy's rework. his powers and the looks of his powers. The devs actually put in some heart and thought into this rework.
---
Like I Said, she is the absolute top, nothing can go beyond her.
---
Yeah but it was already easy enough to max out the other categories and they made the hardest one harder to max for some reason.
---
With my group they usually tell it's mikey from my scream at I notice him standing next to me/he yoinks me off a gen
---
It's okay I screamed with you
---
There are also 5 god pallets in disturbed ward middle building
---
He said it's hard to communicate, I explained that it's not. I never said anyone had to play like this.
---
The second one is basically me and my friends playing together 😂
---
I used vegas pro and this was done rather quickly. I noticed the missed frames during rendering but I decided to go with it. Thanks for the feedback
---
Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart. Pretty good show, sort of OK KO and Adventure Time vibes.
---
You don't have the necessary IQ to understand what people are explaining to you. I don't know any other way to put it.
---
That's pretty gross
---
There are only a couple of killers that work in high ranks nurse, hag, spirit and I guess some people say Billy. The rest are incredibly difficult to get just 1 kill with because of obvious reasons: no map pressure, easily looped among other reasons. Survivors have a huge advantage over all the rest of the killers in high ranks because they can easily gen rush while you get looped to death doesn't matter how good of a killer you are or your perks and I'm def not the only killer main that has been saying this.
---
And youre still here 😂😂😂😂
---
It's almost always the right play. Sometimes it's even fine going down on a pallet if you're not sure the killer's swing will damage you even if you drop it.
---
If I could just stop getting teammates who take a hit as they drop the pallet, that would be lovely.

Im ranking down again. I was practicing nurse, prestiged her once and now im back on trapper. Its all good. Shit happens. Lobbies on xbox have been messed up. I get alot of rank 5s and below in lobbies
---
I can't seem to preview the file with the links to the packs. No matter what I do I can't view the files. What do I do?!?! I need these!
---
I think that they should nerf the shit out of the op killers and buff all the shitty ones so that you can play any killer you want without feeling like the game is impossible while still not spamming spirit every game -survivor btw
---
Can’t buy him with shards
---
I think that some form of balance too. All his perks for the late game. + NOED and there is some synergy with him being strong at all point in the game. I think?
---
Lmao, that's the only response you can come up with, I guess. My IQ is fine, thank you very much.
---
Yeah he is terrifying, esp when you're just on a gen and then suddenly think 'Whose breathing is tha- OH MY GOD' The only thing worse for me is setting off my first Hag trap lol
---
The new badham map is hot ngl
---
Yeah, it's definitely a new player only perk for the most part. Could use some additional functionality but I think the above suggestion is a little much, haha.
---
Are the devs ever gonna extend the time it takes to do a gen? Or add a proper second objective? It's so fucking stressful to play Killer because you have to do perfectly and not waste a second or you might as well give up on the game.
---
Same on ps4 it can be rough
---
&gt; Never have I played against someone so convinced that using pallets meant they had skill. Made me laugh so hard
---
I feel like a survivor's skill level should be calculated by like
---
"How long they lasted in a chase, divided by amount of pallets they used"- you know, but roughly. Going down instantly and not using any pallets doesn't mean you're infinitely good, but if you run a killer for 3 minutes and only use 2 pallets, you're a god.
---
Haddonfield really isn't that bad
---
Is this for real? Because this is my favorite thing ever
---
I'm sure this is a bug involving RNG for generating maps.
---
That's true it is in a better spot still doesn't mean it's in a balanced spot.
---
Wow being invisible when you are half the map away, that's really stealthy. Hes really going to catch me off guard when I see him walking at me 34 meters away. No matter which way you spin it he is not a stealth killer. And I also like how I pointed out how his 3 active abilities are not stealthy and you response was yeah but none of those make him a stealth killer ignore that. If that's the case then Huntress is a stealth killer. She can hit you when you don't even know where she is and has a smaller then regular heartbeat so she can sneak up on you.
---
True true
---
Thank goodness. As if survival points were the not the hardest to gain besides escaping the match alive.
---
*STOMP*
---
So how many games did you play?

Yes i love the hair cuz in match looks cool but in my opinion nothing is better than the blonde summer hair with glasses
---
Huh I feel the same way when Nurse is choking me
---
I want new Freddy so bad
---
I wonder how he lost his eye
---
Sounds good. Thanks
---
Why are they not meant to be balanced?

---
You can even see in the beginning of the video that when i was trying to body block for the ace, i exited the match but he broke the boundary somehow
---
Hahah ok dude.. its nurse Billy spirit and then hag.  I cant with you. If hag is so good why dont you see her in red ranks?? I see lots of Billy tho.
---
Bet he did it with something from Jake's toolbox.
---
Opinions aren't allowed, good to know
---
I guess I'm speaking from my own experience. Billy is high tier which makes no sense to me but I guess it makes sense to others.
---
And the jacket is wonderfull
---
Oh man, that's amazing. No way it's intended, but I still love it.
---
This was glorious.
---
Snares are fine, at this point hes a better clown if you play it right. Dream pallets are just extremely powerful.
---
That build is actually super op tho.
---
Fucking hell, survivors lived a good life for far too long, they are used to versing sub par killers when everything but nurse spirit and billy is coming up, they are way too used to dominating the game, it would be time for the majority of the killers to get fucking buffed. I'm sick of seeing toxic survivors t-bagging and being dicks. How about they get as frustrated as every other killer main? They should be the fucking prey after all. That's why it's fucking killer and survivor, you have to fucking survive you twats, not BM
---
Say it louder for the toxic nea's in the back!
---
The map isn't always 68 meters, dude....
---
And yeah, he is a stealth killer, otherwise his invisibility to awake survivors wouldn't exist (also keep in mind add-ons lower the range; don't tell me those don't count, either). 
---
Huntress is not a stealth killer. She is loud and visible. If she hits you from far away, she's a very good shot and you were stupidly standing out in the open.
---
And why do you think he needs that Nerf?
---
Well I’m sure they have heard of this before so you would think they would try to fix it but as you said they just don’t care about unfair shit like this :/
---
I got the head case DLC and the NEA head is legit pretty. She got blue hair and makeup.
---
Nah all the ones that are for sale should still be there. I've not seen any disappear and don't know why the devs would tbh. More stuff for people to buy
---
Use the element of surprise and expose them
---
I don't know
---
I believe in making sure his content stays in the depths where it belongs. Not on our front page. I understand the comic is being used as a meme format, but the credit/name of the artist is still there. Not saying the poster is a Nazi.
---
my favorite is the ones who jump out a window into a long drop, landing on my trap. they never see it coming. it's clearly someone who's been at this a long time, yet they're surprised I trap the heavily trafficked spot at the cabin window? Nea you dumb bitch.
---
The lines let me teach you a lesson in trickery for killer mindgames and

Wraiths invisible form needs a buff, as, by itself, it's not a viable option.

/r/antifastonetoss
---
You might just need more practice with the clown’s bottles. If three gens popped that means you spent a lot of time on that first chase. I’ve been having a lot of luck with Corrupt Intervention over Ruin on him. It helps for patrolling a smaller area especially since he lacks map presence.
---
Because she’s one of the hardest Killers to be good with.
---
Here's what I *think* happened:
---
FunWorld made the Father Death mask. Wes Craven/New Line thought this mask was perfect for their movie. New Line and FunWorld reached an argreement;
---
NL could use the mask in the movies and all related promotional materials. FW still owned the mask and name, but were allowed to make costumes based on the movies. This promotes the Scream films, while making FW money.
---
FunWorld do not have the right, however, to licence out the Scream design of Ghostface. NL co-owns that design, and thus has to agree to any licence deals.
---
I liked Freddy's power, but I liked Freddy more, it doesn't matter what his powers are now.
---
I definitely hope they do something similar to his old power for a future killer. Maybe with a different concept they can make a healthier version of it.
---
i love the freakout lmao. the visual terror in you was amusing
---
Decisive strike was a very strong perk...I guess there was some thing wrong with that.. 
---
Mettle of man pretty strong perk....I guess there was something wrong with that..
---
I guess strong things can only be given to one side 😜.
---
Freddy: "wHAT THE HELL IS THIS"
---
Lol I've done that too lol, like I'd spin 3/4th around thinking Im safe cause my spine chill wasnt going off, well he tiered up and I asked my swf 'which one of you let him stalk?' and that's when I finally did a full 360 to see him just chilling out in the freaking open staring at me. Oops lol
---
I feel the top image, except it's usually more like 'fuck it, everyone put on the red shirts, grab your firecrackers and leftover Halloween flashlights, we meet in the basement for a party.'
---
It doesn't inhibit the way he operated with his 'stealth' aspects at all though.
---
Survivors being aware that they are playing against a Freddy doesn't make Freddy less stealthy in his encounters
---
Did you use a VPN? I tried that but Google Play Store just says Dead by Daylight by Behavior isn't a available on the Google Play Store.
---
Doctor has had his illusionary pallets for over a year now. I think Freddy should be fine. Just remember which pallets have been destroyed.
---
Yeah, do these people really think I care about bloodpoints or rank? I’ll facecamp any BMing survivor and I’ll tea bag towards any killer that’s a douche, my wager is that they care a whole lot more than I do
---
r/wheeeesh
---
Plez gimme wraithy boi
---
Is it just me or does it look like she has bathing suit tan lines on her shoulders?! either way, a nice look for jane
---
What did it now do? Did you try VPN?
---
That’s not enough because  blood points are a free thing you earn and most people that dc don’t care about bloodpoints,
---
You dont
---
I'm saying BHVR aren't spending much in making the skins, and that the skins pay for the coders.
---
Without regular sales of cosmetics, we wouldn't get as much content or as many patches, as BHVR would have to resort to making money off of other projects to fund DBD.
---
you are screwed at rank 16, try around rank 10-13 you'll get some more brain activity
---
It legit sucks that killers that give survivors moments like these will never know their reaction and if they appreciated the moment or not :(
---
The only part about him that needs to be changed is the visual fx were removed and his baby hand
---
Yes, you aren't entitled to a free escape. But simply put, EGC and the traps don't work together. It would be another noed situation but this one the survivors can't stop. You're not entitled to a free kill because you allowed all the gens to be done. The climax should be suspenseful, but having a trap on your head and left to sit there during EGC waiting for your team to either leave or pick you up just to have the pig tunnel you back down isn't suspenseful. It's just you're going to die and there's nothing you can do. It would be worse than the killer camping you on the hook because even if you did manage to work together to pull of that risky hook save, you still have a bear trap on your face. You can't leave, and the pig is checking her boxes for you with the timer now already half complete and your trap timer ticking down.
---
I'm not saying she doesn't need changing, she certainly does. But she currently is the price that was paid for EGC. Hopefully she'll get a rework or a buff for her during the trial as a killer shouldn't be only viable after all the gens are done
---
Thanks, any idea how long it’ll take me to get there ?
---
this actually happened to me. Still got a 4k tho.
---
Find cheeky angles and lean like crazy since it gives more stalk meter
---
This 100%
---
If you yourself do good (generally speaking) you'll get there in less than a week if not a few days
---
It is, but you know once the rework drops 90% of the killers will be Freddy, just like with any other killer. Normally it wouldn’t matter in the slightest, but knowledge of a perk countering a new/reworked killer’s abilities would make that perk top tier for a couple of weeks. 
---
Sure, that can be fine, but as someone who played GF exclusively and ran into 1-3 OoO about every game, it was the opposite of fun to even try to use the power.
---
The option wasnt there for me and no I didnt try a vpn but I will rn
---
Ah that's hot
---
That's hot.
---
Omg. So many killers whining he needs a buff and so many survivors whining he needs a nerf. Give it more than literally one day smh
---
Except once it's been broken and replaced
---
reeeepost
---
Right dude lol I hate him so much ahahaha as SOON as someone’s like oh shit it’s micheal I almost give up right there because I don’t want to have a heart attack and die 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
---
If the survivors are toxic, I'm toxic back. Mainly cause the messages of hate after each round are hilarious.
---
I like the head. Sue me.
---
I was more suggesting that he add a /s, but I guess I will just take the idiot points...
---
Very rarely do I get the opportunity to 4 man swf these days (OCE/AUS killers don’t like coordination apparently) so I just duo with my mate and it’s surprising how coordinated we get around killers, which gens to do and what our teammates are up to. We pretty much sit in the purple to red ranks every season, so communication when you VS the same killer 7 times in a row is pretty vital. Especially if they’re looking like they run NOED, all totems have got to go before the last gen pops.
---
It is rare to play with a group of survivors that impress or surprise you.  Just focus on trying to impress yourself and you'll be happier.
---
"A lot of time" I spend maybe the first minute or so, finding, hitting twice and hooking. I really don't know how I could be more efficient than that.
---
Yeah but clown can't teleport to gens and make fake pallets appear.
---
This was a really lame serious post. Also Mettle of Man is useless now, survivors got nerfed, decisive rework, survivors got nerfed, to stop you complaining about gen rush, use that one ghost face perk or one of the two plague perkz that directly disable Generators, and stop being a little baby 😴😴😴
---
I'm just saying unfortunately making a statement that the artist is a shit person doesnt mean people will automatically stop using his work.
---
The same thing I do on The Game as survivor, try your best and suck it up?
---
I don’t really think that was the best argument you could have made but they did well on Myers and Scream so why not Freddy?
---
this isn't just good Dead by Daylight advice, it's good life advice
---
It's an add on tho, not a perk. So it would be more comparable to an instaheal or a key
---
It can be broken and replaced? I don’t get what you’re trying to prove...
---
I use iOS if that changes anything.
---
Nope doesn't have EU as a location fuck
---
When you do swf
---
Stalk em, stab em, profit. Make sure you have his power activates so you don't have a terror radius and can sneak better. Try to take cover and lean when you stalk too
---
I love doing it as wraith. You can just appear suddenly and slash them.
---
No but it didnt work anyway
---
&gt;Misc cosmetic improvements
---
gee thanks for telling me if my stuff was changed
---
So nurse is actually better on mobile than on pc...
---
&gt; Freddy has traps OR snares + the gen teleport
---
You're ONLY mentioning the powers he has. As someone above said:
---
"There is a lot more to Freddy though. Micro-sleep, a basic attack puts you to sleep, alarm clocks, lullaby, limited visibility range and intermittent phasing, traps, teleport."
---
The character has a lot more to it than "just one more power." The Clown literally JUST throws a bottle. The trapper literally JUST places down traps (his whole power is garbage though, even worse without addons). All I'm saying is these older killers need something done to them to keep them up to date. Especially Trapper and Wraith who are garbage tier
---
Once dedicated servers are live they'll get punished for repeatedly doing it
---
Pig cosmetics when?
---
I hope not cause the perks suck
---
well most of the time i’m trying to sacrifice myself so my team can get out so it’s not much different 
---
unless i’m doing an adept achievement then i won’t throw myself at the killer
---
Literally the best lol. I might have to see how the top and head look with her charcoal shorts.
---
Yes exactly lol sorry for previous comment was not trying to be weird 😂😂😂 ahahaha
---
Well when freddy comes out I'm gonna being adding it to my build
---
No mither, solidarity, self care, left behind
---
Man, I just want to say I love the Mao Mao memes you've been making lately. Keep up the great work
---
The thing about this community is that every little change is considered a nerf. He could get a very reasonable tweak and people will cry about it being a nerf 🙄.
---
Damn this is fucking cool. Pretty good job so far
---
So what punishment would you find fitting?
---
1. then blame that on the player, not the character. they flock to ghostface because he has the ability to crouch, that doesnt mean crouching is op.
---
2. dont mistake top tier killers for being unfair. characters like michael and ghostface are labeled hard difficulty for a reason - its not easy to know how to use them to their full potential, but when you learn, its lethal, like pc nurses. as long as there are counters, theyre not op, you just need to learn how to play according to the killer. theyre only really unfair when theyre as bad as legion was pre-nerf, when people could abuse the mending time and run backwards at a survivor to guarantee downs.
---
it takes more effort to put people asleep as new Freddy than old Freddy. Granted his ability is stronger than old Freddy, but when the end game hits he is at a drastic disadvantage.
---
Having everyone asleep end game as old Freddy was devastating and rather easy to do if they were grouped up, this isn't the case anymore as new Freddy. That's my reasoning, I'm not saying it's bad or overall worse, but it is kinda funny since old Freddy had a decently strong end game with his aura reading massive slowdown and certain add-ons and perks. New Freddy loses it all at the end game.
---
See my reasoning? Can you comprehend, I know it's hard but try.
---
I’d love to play ghostface but good luck playing him with no ruin in red ranks
---
SWF will always be painful to go up against. Communication will always break the game in some way or another. If you dont wanna play against them then just dodge them. 
---
Plus people fall asleep passively AND they fall asleep instantly when you hit them. The dream pallets are very difficult to get rid of if your not in a chase, but they are practically guaranteed to have an effect on the survivor your chasing while so long as they are up. Trust me the dream pallets are very strong.
---
What Caliber?
---
Wild.
---
A lot of killers are good in high ranks
---
Why though? It’s also not fun to be slugged on the ground in order for the killer to try to 4K. Not going to lie I have been enjoying killer more since it has gotten easier to play them. What happened to having fun in this game? Why does every little thing need to be made out as though it’s the end of the world? We can already close the hatch and force a 4K when played right. Crap like this is why the devs can’t focus on fixing bugs and actual game breaking issues. We are too busy being triggered and complaining about a survivor dc’n.
---
Blessed affliction should still work on exhausted as a way of punishment. It would make it a (not too much) strong perk.
---
so is there a counter to dream pallets or what
---
One time I had it spawn there and it actually lasted a decent while. It’s almost like it’s so obvious that nobody looks there lol.
---
Same here !
---
nah man i upvoted you
---
I’ve been through 20+ bloodwebs and haven’t gotten teachable ruin for ghostface. I’d really like to play him but all you do is just get gen rushed if you don’t have it
---
I'd much prefer 4 perks for 100% of a game than 3 perks for 95% of a game, just because some youtuber said I have to use a "MaNdAtOrY" perk.
---
That's a bug actually, nothing to do with lag
---
Cool perk ideas
---
But it's realy worth it for those games where it stays up, and finding and cleansing the totem takes up time survivors could be using to do gens.
---
They probably deranked on purpose so they can bully new killers
---
You're right, they are a small company with fair work hours. Too bad there isn't any way to hire new employees with all the money they hoard from constant paid DLCs or cosmetics on their game that costs money.
---
im a freddy main and im happy with the rework. but im sure gonna miss the wallhacks tho
---
What exactly do you think is killer sided?
---
If the minimum number of pallets cannot be generated, some tiles with have two pallets.
---
Okay so to preface, I am a total scrub who just picked up the game in the sales. Played a few games as survivor but mainly played killer as Myers. I've had some decent luck and managed to get a few 4Ks, after two of these I've had people leave comments on my steam profile as well as call me out in the after chat. 
---
Is this a relatively toxic community? Or am I just playing really cheesily? If its the community I don't really care, I've dealt with some before, doesn't really bother me tbh. But for the most part, I guess I play pretty safe? So after I hook the first survivor, I'll usually hang about somewhat nearby to bait the others out (not camp at the hook, but don't stray much further than a gen or two away). Now, straight up, if its 2v1, I'll camp that second last hook to make it 1v1, especially so if I know where the hatch is. Is my playstyle cheesy? Am I the problem? Or am I just trash and just playing inefficiently anyways? Either way, just wanna say that I'm really enjoying the game so far, raging that I didn't pick it up sooner!
---
Also shout-out to the two survivors who camped in the digger on one map for 20 minutes playing hide and seek. I legit thought I was in a bugged game or something, you properly bamboozled me. GG.
---
Oh that's chill. I found this on Twitter myself lol
---
Dude I did the same thing as the plague a few games back. David was standing at the entrance to the exit gate tea bagging me waiting for me to hit him. I downed him with NOED and hooked him. So satisfying.
---
Right and that’s 6000 shards , I’d rather just level her up ... most players play her first as survivor anyways
---
How did you make this? Photoshop I presume.
---
I think that the power is much too powerful. Maybe reduce the aura detection so it is not the whole map?  I also think that the frenzy lasts WAY too long maybe 30 seconds instead of 90. Also the horrifying revelation perk either needs an increased cooldown or a decreased amount of screaming. I think the concept is good it just needs some adjustments to the power.
---
Never
---
I have noticed this with all killers too
---
Actualy I feel like this Freddy without pallet addon will suck anyways. But these dream pallets are good and well balanced. They are not overpowered but they should be jn his main part of power. These snares should be a purple addon which would grant bonus 300% deviousness points like for hag or green and 200%. It should be for farming you got me
---
Can someone help me? Will the Switch version be the same as the PC (killers and survivors as paid dlc)?
---
Stop chasing that person. I wanted to assert my dominance on a Nea who was doing the same thing to me. In the end I ended up only killing one person and depip’n because my pride took over any logic that I had about the game.
---
As a huge fan of Freddy I'm extremely hyped for the rework
---
Which just gives him more opportunity to catch up, unless they've got lithe/balanced you're most likely not going to reach the next jungle gym/loop without dropping a pallet.
---
Freddy forcing a pallet drop without getting looped once means he's shortening chases and having more pressure around the map, even without people stepping in his puddles.
---
Once you get to the rank 10 stop gap the average skill levels seems to to go up
---
Spirit
---
"It's right there, see? I threw it down in front of the killer."
---
"You were supposed to stun the killer with the pallet."
---
"Dude I'm gonna."
---
"Then go stun the killer."
---
"Alright! Sheesh..."
---
*slow vault*
---
"I see the problem."
---
"OH DO YA?"
---
sorry i can't look like her
---
Yeah it's scattered everywhere so honestly I don't blame you for not posting a source, this is the earliest post of the Pic I could find so I'm considering it OP but I could be wrong.
---
It will probably be like obvious window vaults against trapper; if you don't know for certain just assume you'll get got
---
Surveillance is way better. Thanataphobia sounds good on paper but it's actually pretty bad. Supposedly, with all the stacks it only increases a gen by only like 4-7 seconds or something like that.
---
If I'm being honest, you should try getting Pop Goes The Weasel on GF. It combos with Thrilling Tremors. You down someone, pick them up, you see what gens are being worked on, you hook someone and you use pop goes the weasel on it.
---
The FPS on console would fucking explode
---
Spirit is strong but definitely counterable
---
Or... or... let it go and not add to it?
---
Thank you! I've been doing my best to make memes, with only 10 episodes of content. I think there is still more untapped meme potential I haven't found yet.
---
pop goes the weasel, ruin, bbq, and nurse's.
---
I really see no reason to use dream snares insted of fake pallets. They took longer to place and have a least interesting and much weaker effect. They really should eather make fake pallets his base ability and srap dream snares or change them to be actually interesting and a good alternative
---
Alternatively, when cowboy jake finds your ruin
---
Wonderful guide mate
---
Watch hybridpanda play killer, he's not insanely good but he's a solid player and he practically never uses ruin but can still get real solid matches at high ranks.
---
But ... just play meg to level 40 for her teachables ... then when they pop up in the shrine spend your shards on them for 150k blood points each ... which you will
---
I hear you, bitch
---
Little tip with Ghostface/ Myers, you can stalk through a crack in the wall in killer shack.
---
they hated him because he told them the truth
---
replace killer mains with streamers or youtubers and i'd agree
---
Wait how am I crying? It's simple logistics?
---
I'll definitely miss the aura-reading Freddy has. It made ping-ponging between survivors super easy and he was godlike in the 2v1 slug game. I like feeling like I'm playing 5d chess with myself and getting 4ks not because I was tunneling or mori-ing, but because I started a war of attrition and won it.
---
This meme gets me every time
---
lol
---
Oh hey, maybe its time to throw down on some kate
---
WHAAAAAAT?! Oh damn, my friend is gonna flip SHIT when she hears this
---
I have fun all the time. I never try hard but it is the goal of the game to see how many survivors you can kill so it shouldn’t be allowed to disconnect your game to give another survivor an advantage
---
Banned for a few days after doing it 3 times
---
I'M ONLY RANK 12 BUT KEEP GETTING AT LEAST 3 COORDINATED RED RANKS IN MY KILLER LOBBIES
---
I agree this makes sense to me
---
The snares seem so forced. I would want them switched out because they feel like a mix of clown traps and hag traps. They don’t feel like him at all, or feel good to use either. Pathetic pallets though? Amazing.
---
👍
---
Try to 99% each survivor's stalk meter until the best time to pop it
---
Let her give up man, I know how this feels. ):
---
Aww little baby survivor dcs if they’re up against a half decent killer that’s so adorable
---
Exactly. I will continue to support this game as long as I play it
---
3 times in how short a time period?
---
Is the red bandana(?) part of the body or the head?
---
Tbh the game should force you to do the tutorial first for bloodpoints and get the basics
---
Absolutely, we’re making progress but we’re still not there yet
---
Body
---
LOL you’re such a salty killer main. Bet you only play nurse spirit
---
Just spit balling, feel free to make suggestions
---
I suppose. I've never had success with it.
---
"Ruin the game" LOL. Is that what you use to justify the unnecessary anger towards people with differing opinions in a videogame? Yikes. And Freddy was already weak before his nerf. No amount of buffs / nerfs would've changed that. That's not something you can put on the community. No "repeats" will happen now that he's fixed
---
IN THE CASE OF GHOSTFACE I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY ACCURATE. GHOSTFACE'S MECHANICS SEEM TO HAVE UNINTENDED EXPLOITS ATTACHED TO THEM. FOR INSTANCE HE CAN BE CHASING ME AT FULL SPEED RIGHT OUT OF A QUICK SHROUD AND HE HAS 0 TERROR RADIUS DURING THIS CHASE AROUND TIGHT CORNERS WELL AFTER LEAVING THE SHROUD. IF THAT'S "INTENDED" THEN YOU NEED TO RETHINK THAT KILLER BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS.
---
Idk cuz I ain't no killer main but I think ya should be happy
---
tbh almost anything you see on twitter more than likely came from reddit.
---
They removed the radial sound but it’s still there.

&gt; Killers always run slightly faster than you. 
---
*Angry Nurse screeches intensify* 
---
But for real, this is a nice guide, especially with the easily understood descriptions.
---
Yeah, if someone drops the pallet, Freddy can kick it and make a new dream pallet in the "right" location. The info still helps not to drop a pallet that *can't* be real, but the pallet opposite the window isn't necessarily real either.
---
I’ve seen several killers go to a corner and stare down and shake their head when they struggled all match. When killers give up, I usually give them a sacrifice and and/or encourage teammates to farm/let themselves be hooked. The killer usually messages a thank you later, and I’ll usually tell them they’re a better killer than me (even if it’s not true.) :)
---
Which one out of the killer perks seems the best for a ghostface?
---
Yeah, but after Marth did his De-Pip series most killer mains think that is how every SWF plays -- Tactical comms, top tier game play with coordination.
---
Just giving him the yellow bag + darkened traps would make him extremely better. Frees up addons and gives him things that should honestly always have been part of his kit.
---
They do that but they take a full second to place plus a full second to activate and they are really small even when activated. The pallets are way faster to place, way more interesting as a mechanic and way more impactfull. I can't see a reason why someone would use dream snares over fake pallets in their current state
---
Yah I’m at rank 6 with killer and rank 3 with survivor and it can be very unfun
---
Not anymore
---
Cool, thank you :)
---
I disagree. As long as it can buy you enough time in the early game to get your momentum going then it’s done it’s job. It’s pretty telling how powerful a perk is when it can be destroyed in 30 seconds and it’s still the best perk in the game.
---
They need to add 1 more emote. Both point and come here could be interpreted negatively. Sometimes tbagging is just a form of recognition/communication at the end.
---
How to Run All Generic Tiles as Killer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ - Learn to not rely on Ruin, there are many more fun perks that you can use. Hope this helps :)
---
Yes, that is the same way I love to play as killers. I like the harder killers that can’t just straight up kill survivors. I like really working for it.
---
Jeez. I'm rank 13 for survivor (1 pip to 12) and 17 for killer. I'm trying to stay in grey ranks for killer right now since I'm just starting to rank up the Spirit and all of my perks are level 1
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh if you did not say anything only the killers would know about it. Damn man, you were that kid in highschool weren't you.
---
Dude Barney's music would make me feel terrified
---
I inmagine this almost like sige do it twice in 1 day and you get like an hour ban and if you do it after that ban is lifted than you get a day or something like that
---
I think somewhere on the forums it was said that it is a bug. It isn't intended for their bodies to obscure the gen aura.
---
According to Wikipedia:
---
FunWorld created a costume with the iconic mask, but a white cloak, in 1991/2 and called it "Peanut-Eyed Ghost".
---
During production of Scream, Marianne Maddalena discovered this mask and brought it to the attention of Wes Craven, who thought it was perfect.
---
Unable to obtain the rights, Craven and Kevin Williamson designed a legally-distinct mask (similar to what happened with the MTV series). Eventually however, Dimension Films were able to come to an agreement with FunWorld and use the original mask in the films.
---
In was Craven and Co., however, that coupled the mask with the cloak. So while FW own the mask and Ghostface name (which R. J. Torbert came up with), the combination of the mask and cloak was owned by Dimension.
---
FW were, presumably, allowed to make and sell costumes based on the movies. But they did have the right to licence out this appearence. The mask? Yes. Mask and cloak? No.
---
This complex licence agreement is why the first two seasons of MTV's Scream didn't have the classic mask. MTV partnered with Dimension, but the latter's agreement with FunWorld only covered using the mask in the movies and related promotional material. As such, they didn't have the right to use it. 
---
For season 3, though, they managed to obtain the rights.
---
I should probably drop in rank for killer so I can get everything I want and farm bad survivors but idk
---
try to find good angles to stalk &amp; expose survivors without them being able to break you out of ur power. also always try to lean and stalk if u can, it marks them faster.
---
Clown and Myers main but ok
---
Windows doesnt counter fake pallets, they still show up as being normal ones. They said on the stream it doesnt show them as being fake pallets either
---
Why is kates head twisted?
---
That’s kinda broken
---
I'm not even gonna argue with you, entitled survivor main. If it was that easy, Freddy wouldn't be getting nerfed right now. How about you stop whining when a killer whoops ur ass and then ask for a nerf. 👶👶👶
---
Kate isn’t a rocket. She’s a country girl. She should get a cowboy hat.
---
You started off saying his endgame potential isn't as good now, which isn't true. You can switch up your argument last second to try and make me look wrong if you want to I guess, but I'm arguing with your first statement. Now you're saying his endgame isn't worse, it's just a lot different. That's something I can understand and agree with. But if you're saying that new Freddy is worse endgame against meta perk survivors than Old Freddy, I completely disagree on all fronts.
---
I meant that campers can easily get multi kills oops.
---
Speaking of killer, who do play
---
Yuck :(

---
I'M MAD BECAUSE I'M BAD. EITHER EBONY MORI'D OR GRIEFED OR NO TEAM WORK OR I MAKE STUPID DECISIONS AND DIE. WHY AM I LIKE THIS.
---
I want to play ghost face but once you hit purple ranks you get gen rushes without ruin unless you have insane pressure, I play spirit, ghost face, and I wanna get into pig and Michael. I’m the sneaky killer. What about you?
---
Which pocket is it in? Left pocket means he wants to pee ON you, right pocket means he wants to GET peed on
---
Clown is pretty good in chases. Three gens popping means at least 80 seconds past, which is definitely a long time for clown even at red ranks. You mentioned you do better with Myers with fewer gens popping so that leads me to believe you’re not terrible, just perhaps less experienced with clown.
---
It's not letting me in at the moment :/
---
Since when is huntress free?
---
hey, you killed them. That counts for something, right?
---
He's really not that bad in his current live state.
---
Well that would be op then. By the end she would be at 120% speed. Add Play with your Food and NOED and she could possibly be at 139% speed. That's way too much. If she's slower at the beginning she was to mind game survivors to get them. The more gens that get done the faster she gets. By the end she would be at around 128% speed. That's much more balanced.
---
Maybe, but survivors need killers to play against. In the long run, the devs can't afford to upset killers too much either.
---
Repost
---
Sure, we'll go with that : \^ )
---
Triggered much?
---
I’m sorry you’re getting downvotes. I thought it was funny.
---
The one person in Monto's video did just that for most of the game. I think it was the Nea with the blue shirt that wasn't the obsession.
---
Rank 11 but okay buddy. I play the game quite a bit actually and the nurse really isn’t that bad at all, especially compared to ghost crutch, Michael, and Freddy.
---
Right! 😏
---
Can you do Meg next please?
---
NO
---
/ssssssssssssss
---
Sucks, but thats random placement for you. Could be in first 5 seconds, could be the whole match before they find it
---
Then your statement is either pointless or, at best, out of place.
---
He's far from the worst imo. People like to treat him like other killers and that doesn't work
---
HOW ON GODS EARTH CAN PEOPLE SAY GENS ARE DONE AT AN OK PACE, THREE GAMES IN A ROW NOW, NO TOOLBOXES, NO REPAIR PERKS, NO NOTHING AND WITH NO RUIN, THEY POP THE FIRST THREE IN A MINUTE. ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT RUIN ALWAYS GETS FUCKING FOUND, IF KILLERS NEED RUINS TO MAKE THE GAME FAIR IN THE FIRST PLACE, THEN HOW IS THIS GAME WELL BALANCED! AND HOW ON GODS GREEN EARTH DO SURVIVORS THINK THAT THIS IMBALANCE SOMEHOW MAKES THEM GOOD ENOUGH TO BM EVERY SINGLE FUCKING MATCH!?
---
Since she came out as far as I'm aware
---
Not a bug, it's intentional. A map must have at least 8 pallets.
---
Really don't know why they don't just make variants of killers, so you have fun, underpowered variants, as well as the new balanced one.
---
Ignore all the jerks in the comments section. If the game frustrates you to the point that you’re considering or wanting to suicide, it’s just not worth playing. Think about all the frustration and enjoyment you get from the game and weigh them. Honestly, the real reason so many people are addicted to this game/can’t quit it no matter how mad they get is because of the love/hate relationship the community has with the game. The back and forth of emotions is addicting to the human brain. It’s why we love drama and emotional payoffs. Think about a game where you get tbagged and bullied and the survivors use exploits. Now imagine if the next game you managed to 4K with an ebony mori. The intense anger you had will then convert into intense joy. It’s definitely not healthy to your mental state to keep alternating between the two. The game is fun and all, but it can be intoxicating.
---
There was a LOT more than 8 pallets
---
There's a practice mode. It's called Kill Your Friends.
---
Yea, as survivor main I agree that killers need to stop getting nerfed, and maybe mettle of man too
---
Absolutely. In reality, there are so many addon’s which feel as the intended part of the kit, which was scrapped in the last second (for the balance purposes?).
---
Not everyone has friends they can play with.
---
Killers in this thread like Hello fellow survivors.
---
I'm most certainly not terrible. I still think 80 seconds way too short a time to allow for three gens to be done.
---
Some of his add-ons needs buffs. For example, his purple add-ons seems really underwhelming,
---
except maybe Swing Chains. Z Block is just trash, this add-on literally makes Frank's Mix Tape looks good, that's how garbage it is. Class Photo has too much of a down side and Pill Bottle doesn't have a very useful effect in my opinion. 
---
Class Photo and Pill Bottle from old Freddy were actually really powerful and these add-ons seems just much weaker now ...
---
Yes, pls wait me a sec
---
YOU COULDVE JUST CAMPED THE EXIT GATES WHILE THE KILLER GETS THE HATCH THEN FREE ESCAPE
---
I've been playing since release man dedicated servers are a pipe dream
---
Very accurate
---
I'm not very vocal about nerfing, but like deadass use those Gen-Stopping perks if that's a big complaint, more situational than Ruin, but not a hex, so maybe run both if you like Ruin.
---
They did remove it so the killer can't hear it, but it's been put back with the Freddy rework patch.
---
Do you have the rest of the match recorded? If so, you can submit a bug report on the official site.
---
I would pay money to keep old Freddy
---
Oh that does not surprise me AT ALL. Guess Dwight looks for “fountains” even when he’s not against the Plague
---
weird, Last I checked you still have to pay for her. Unless I misread and it’s a different currency used to get her
---
Clown is one of my favorites I would go for it
---
They've said that every alternative they've tested has been boring. I don't believe they want to add a second objective.
---
I hope someone makes a meme like that if they give Piggie a buff again or something xD.
---
this is good, thank you
---
Your comment is a repost 😂
---
Self care is an A tier survivor perk. It’s not S tier and you can definitely make a build with 4 perks that are better than self care, but for what it’s worth the perk is pretty damn good. Being able to heal yourself is more efficient because you don’t to scramble around looking for a teammate and it also frees up the other 3 survivors to work on gens, go for unhooks, get chased by the killer, etc.
---
Yes it’s not a meta defining perk like it once was and it’s not even in the top 4 survivor perks. But anyone who thinks the perk is legitimately bad is delusional. Notice how every time someone makes an argument for why it sucks they say shit like “cause people just run to the corner of the map and don’t do gens!” Just because people suck at the game and run to the corner to heal doesn’t mean the perk is bad. Hate the player not the game
---
imagine using emotes on reddit
---
Easy. Jane’s hollow.
---
Blessed Affliction would be absolutely nasty on the Plague btw, but I'd like it.
---
Nurse isn't really unfair, she just required you to know how to play her better than the nurse your playing against. The nurses skill isn't in how well she can control her blink, that's her skill floor. Her actual skill is predicting survivors movement. If you can put yourself in situations where there's more possibility for different situations, you can build distance. You want to avoid looping spots, and go for jungle gyms. Do things like double back, fake window vaults, sometimes look the opposite way of where you want to run. And make sure to always use cover to stay out of her line of site.
---
For me, I have a tougher time against spirits. I basically have to play stealthily against them.
---
Because the game demands also entity powers
---
But pre-rework Freddy isn't trash.
---
Set your desktop resolution to 720p. Its the only way on PC. I think DbD is the only game where I have to run my 4k monitor in 1080p because I can't set a in game resolution. Its so stupid
---
On PS4 and steam her entire DLC (including David) is a free download. I can't verify Xbox off hand
---
I bet I'm the only one too blind to see him
---
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY FUCKING TUNNELING, CAMPING KILLERS RECENTLY? I CAN'T PLAY MORE THAN 3 OR 4 FUCKING GAMES WHERE THERE'S ONE FUCKING GUY TUNNELING THE SHIT OUT OF ONE SURVIVOR!!!
---
Sadly no. I only saved this clip from that match
---
So should i just save my points for when pop goes the weasel gets in the store? I have enough points for to be able to buy two perks
---
From Old Worst to New Worst
---
i see hag all the time in red ranks on pc
---
Oh perhaps you were looking at her individually in the in-game store, idk how she's listed there, but her DLC is a free DLC on steam and psn
---
did u make her squirt? because ur friends and u are literally fingering her
---
Another way to get ppl to play with go to lay station communities at the home screen and look up dead by daylight find player theirs like 60k and you can find ppl to play with every day
---
That's part of the challenge though. There are already elements in the game, like map layout, which you should memorize. Also, a good memory can be trained. It's a skill, like other skills in online gaming.
---
yes pallet blinding, stunning then flashlighting the killer when they break the pallet. Its extra as fuck and if you do it your just trying to piss off the killer to be toxic, buddy.
---
u/ArtoTime
---
Basically, yeah (even though I thinl Bubba and Wraith are worse)
---
Why is it always the "worst" killerd that are the most fun?
---
Have to be on pc and download it from steam
---
Around 5, I'd play more but 45 minute queue times are rough
---
Actually the first panel is exactly how we play lol. We never stop talking and make sure we always give all possible information to each other to he as coordinated as possible. Doesn't mean we never mess up, but we do try our best to win.
---
Just giving my own input on it.
---
Meeeehhhhhhhhhhh
---
Yes? You can get a general idea for a killer by playing them a few times. And in my own opinion his snares are useless
---
*fingerguns*
---
* **Rule 6** - Support Post 
---
* Looking for group posts - Use /r/dbdLFG.
---
Plus the placement system is weird, like where I can't place on anything but a flat plain
---
Hoo boy, I almost downvoted til I finished reading
---
Then maybe scrap the whole generator thing completely? Because I dunno what to tell you but a game mechanic that is boring for one side and nerve-wracking for the other is pretty bad. Why not implement smth like in death garden where the thing you have to do is active instead of passive?
---
20 pallets on the game btw.
---
The best thing you could do if you are struggling on that map is just pick 3 close gens to defend. Avoid wasting too much time chasing people through the houses and just focus on keeping those 3 gens safe as possible. You don't have to chase people in unwinnable loops.

What makes the new killer worse? Is it his abilities?

Yeah I noticed this playing. You can see from very far at times kinda unfair lol.

Oh you already said who you play
---
Yeah balance is never going to happen but pretending like survivors don't get anything strong is just wrong. For nurse though yeah it amazes me that Legion gets kneecapped but they let nurse continue to exist.
---
Bitch
---
It isn’t released at the moment I have no idea how this person was able to get it in game my guess is that this maybe is the design your own cosmetic winner and got it earlier or it’s on the dev build
---
that is not shocking ranking does not really work on ptb
---
Oh, I’m on Xbox, might be different I guess
---
Rewarding survivors for failing at not getting hit is the problem with both of those.  I see survivors complain all the time about NOED rewarding killers for being bad...  isnt that what MoM and the old DS did?
---
Still a little strange
---
what rank are you playing hag at?

*ptsd clears up*

You are a good gamer, thank you

1 step ahead of you, bud. Sneaky killers are pretty fun

#NotAllSurvivors
---
Dwight's stand would be a locker
---
How funny that I had a round and a Jake also suffered the same fate.
---
I had no problem dunking on him since it was warranted.
---
Assuming fake ones are actually intangible this sounds hilarious
---
I always thought Freddy’s  lullaby was always non directional honestly
---
Ok thank you for your help
---
Looks like I’m a Kate main now.
---
Any competent survivor doesn't need any of that information. No heart beat? Stay on the generator/totem. You don't need to know if they killer is chasing someone, even against tier 1 Myers it still doesn't matter.
---
The only useful pieces of information? Lit up totem locations, killer camping hook, and if another survivor is saving you from hook. That's it.
---
Can if its the basement.
---
You on PC?
---
Get pig and fall in love with her.
---
I would upvote but it's at 420
---
I would say forcing them to avoid killer shack is a positive not a negative..
---
No its a bug. That would be really op if it was on purpose.
---
They can be unless you get gen rushed
---
Question. I'm on PS4 so I dont have access to the PTB. I know the dream pallets are an add on, but can you use the pallets and thr snares in one trial or just one
---
K i n d a
---
I think people need to learn how to use them. they're underrated
---
Spirit fury with no enduring ?
---
Exactly
---
I saw a baby Dwight in this outfit today and I just couldn’t kill him he was too adorable
---
Trust me, there's no fixing that.
---
No it's not a legitimate strategy and every good killer knows that. Because as was just stated, the survivors can just do a lot of gens then. Also, standing there for the duration of a full hook as a killer is super boring. Also, the killer camping in the first place is not what this whole post is about, it's about survivors who immediately charge in after someone gets hooked to "rescue" them, without giving the killer a chance to leave the hook (or at least more than a few meters).
---
I just recently bought pig so I don’t have it yet. Even though I’ve spent a shitload of bloodpoints in her bloodweb trying to get it
---
I'm willing to help with your video.
---
Truie
---
Yeah but there's also a bunch of perks that almost stump certain killers if you run them, however it doesn't mean every survivor will run that perk - neither will they find any other use for it other than stumping that one single killer. For example, I think Iron Will is good against Doctor, and Small Game is extremely good against Hags and Trappers. Do you see people using these perks? Rarely. I use SG but I've only seen a couple other survivors use it in my games. It won't be an issue.
---
You must be pretty bad to rely on a bug for kills.
---
Oh shit, she is free. In the store it just says to press a button to buy it so I assumed it costs money.
---
it's actually 3 addons, you can only use snares OR pallets, but not both.  
---
3 addons:  
---
brown: you can set max 10 dream pallets  
---
yellow: you can set max 10 dream pallets + surv aura shown for 4s when triggered  
---
green: you can set max 10 dream pallets + surv aura shown for 6s when triggered  
---
tbh fake pallets are way better than the snares.
---
You should definitely always take a perk no matter what, even if both are trash just pick the slightly less trash one. Otherwise it'll take a loooong time to potentially get all the perks you want because the bs ones WILL keep showing up if you don't take them.
---
When people tbag, tbag back while stalking. Then 1 hit them, profit
---
I love the renders! Ghostfaces outfit is what I'm very excited for
---
I know it's a shitpost but just saying, killers hate swf just because of their ability to share the killer's position, that is it basically.
---
Still not fixed, damn shame!
---
If only I could see what was actually happening...
---
Tapp cosmetics were already leaked
---
I went against a Freddy main this morning that was saying this exact thing in post chat. He despises new Freddy, and like you, has spent the last couple of years getting good with him. :(
---
Whatd they say
---
Exactly. You'd have to be to a moron to think every SWF in the game is a tryhard. Most games are full of duos/sometimes trios anyway. Most of the time they aren't toxic. But then you get the dreaded 4 man group...and they're all wearing P3 clothing/really bright store-bought outfits...and two of them have flashlights, and that's when you know they're just going to be total cancer.
---
Hope you have some fun playing around with huntress/David!
---
With the pallets maybe. Snares are poop
---
Yeah, my friends told me something similar, might as well.

I guess they were talking about freddy and huntress\^\^
---
STARTED A MATCH AND A KATE WAS AFK UNTIL SHE HAD A CROW
---
SHE WAS IN THE KILLER SHACK
---
I RAN OVER TO HER, DROPPED THE GOD PALLET, AND FAST VAULTED 4 TIMES TO ALERT THE KILLER (who turned out to be a memelord ghostface anyways, but I didn't know at the time)
---
ONCE I DID THAT, KATE **ALL OF A SUDDEN** DECIDED TO NOT BE AFK ---- INSTEAD SHE SANDBAGGED ME THE ENTIRE MATCH.
---
FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I'll agree. Enjoyed playing as and against OG Freddy quite a bit, liked the design overall, was obviously aware of its weaknesses/flaws too (most of which I think could have simply been remedied while keeping to the core design, however). Didn't enjoy my time as PTB Freddy (which admittedly was a rather limited time), and see less potential for creative and varied builds and strategies. He definitely has a stronger base kit, but I'd argue OG Freddy with add-ons is actually stronger than New-Freddy with add-ons.
---
I haven't played against him yet, but if that's really a problem, they could change it that you can only be put in the dream state by getting hit.
---
Just in case you get in another lobby with him, record it . And once you die make sure to highlight his name so Bhvr knows you have proof it’s the same person
---
I've been thinking of playing as her, how long did it take you before you considered yourself decent?
---
As a Nurse main, i love OoO users, either they realize they can't bully me or fail hard trying :)
---
Who the fuck runs around looking for someone to heal them? Go sit on a gen forehead.. replace selfcare with adrenaline.  You'll run into a teammate eventually meanwhile you're getting gens or totems done.. not off in the corner using selfishcare..  it's an utter complete waste of time. Bring a medkit and man up.
---
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PLAY HER IF I DON'T OWN HER.
---
Facts
---
1, that squadette pun makes you the most respectable person I know. 2, playstation is what I play on. And time slot is really any day after Sunday the 15th.
---
Upvoting for truth.
---
*downvoted for wanting all killers playable*  
---
???
---
hey mr fuckface, repost more you ballscratching fucker and go blow your dad
---
it’s too early of a thought. pallets are simple to use and people aren’t used to them yet. snares definitely are gonna require more time to see what the most effective use of them are.
---
It makes a fast vault make no noise, so really it's as effective as the survivor can make it
---
Nope it’s not, I’ve played the game long enough to know about it. I shouldn’t be able to see their aura if it was OOO because I was about 16 meters from them; and ooo doesn’t work within that range 
---
And it’s not an aura it’s a weird outline.
---
Interesting. I have no clue
---
I buy what looks cool and i use it if i want to look cool. 
---
Skill be damned.
---
As a Nea main I comply
---
As a prestige 3 Jeff main finally something else to wear that isn't trash.
---
3.0 Dev build, my friend just copied the skins from the ptb and pasted them on the dev build
---
&gt;No I will not open a locker if you point to it. I will down you and camp you for unsportsmanlike behavior! 
---
You should check the locker after you down them just in case. If you pull someone out you can let that survivor go and punish the sandbagger. If there was no one and they were trying to mind game you then you're just a camper.
---
PEOPLE WHO CROUCH FROM ACROSS THE MAP AND WAIT UNTIL YOU GET TO STATE 2 TO UNHOOK ARE GARBAGE.
---
as a killer main, I cannot legally contest your point.
---
The game is fantastic for Balanced Landing though.
---
Fair enough I guess.
---
So when does the actual game start looking this good?
---
The clock already adds and addtional 30 second buffer before you enter the Dream.
---
Except I am intelligent enough to understand it. Or, by the same token, are you saying that you're not intelligent enough to understand what I am trying to explain to you? You're being insulting, whether you're trying to or not. 
---
Disagreeing with people does not mean the other person isn't intelligent enough to understand the opposing argument. In fact, only a smart person would be able to tell that they disagreed with the other person's argument, simply because they can understand said argument enough to know that they disagree.
---
The problem is both killers and survivors take out their rage on the NEXT opponent(s) who might not be even slightly toxic
---
No because then the killer will know you’re telling people NOT to save and thus encourage them to leave the hook.
---
I **taste you,** bitch
---
Then don't bring up Huntress to try to hold up your argument, lmao.
---
Yeah, and that's what, one spot out of how many spots on the map? Not to mention that most traps survivors can just disable.
---
Quality tips 👍🏼
---
That used to be the issue, but then they reworked matchmaking so that you just get matched with wider and wider ranks the longer you sit in queue. So if nobody of your rank is playing, you'll eventually get matched with rank 1s, regardless of your skill level.
---
I dont think so. Snares defeintly are not useless. They give tracking, a decent slow, and counter window looping. The Pallets counter Pallet loops. 
---
You gotta pick and choose.
---
Freddy’s rework makes me want to buy him.but I’ll wait until the official release is beee to see if he’s viable final release
---
https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cbgb5f/build_ideas_for_new_freddy/etfb8fv/?st=jxxvlrxj&amp;sh=fec4b14c
---
One more thing that I thought of is the synergy of his generator teleport with Devour Hope and/or Make Your Choice: all you have to do is hook the survivor in proximity to a generator, and then you can quickly teleport away to get into activation range, and/or back, once they get unhooked, to get the jump on the unhooker. Teleporting away might be risky with MYC, as your teleport could be on cooldown once they get unhooked, so do this with caution (or stack teleport cooldown-reducing add-ons). The "optimal" build for this strategy would be something along the lines of Agitation, Barbecue, Devour Hope, MYC, though you can certainly moderate the build more, replacing Agitation and/or Barbecue with Brutal Strength and/or Weasel, or simply taking MYC as a flavor perk, otherwise going with the standard of Ruin, Barbecue, Brutal, Bamboozle, Weasel, and such.

Oh so you carried the team into a rank they don't de serve and almost did everything by yourself?
---
Well fuck you, you finna get camped now
---
and as surprising as it may sound i don't main survivor
---
Saving me from a hook is actually part of knowing if the killer is headed towards me. Idk what game you play where knowing if the killer is bee lining it towards your gen makes no difference, especially with killers like billy, spirit, or even nurse. It seems like you just want sound like you're good at the game, and who knows, maybe you are, but i think you're fooling yourself if you think that information has no value.
---
 also the "only useful pieces of information" you listed still make swf much more effective than 4 randoms
---
Bruh 😳 I *feel you* bitch
---
Please be able to be bought with iridescent shards, damn it...
---
Yet Survivors still dont avoid Hag Traps or Trapper traps now do they? Just because you can see them doesn't mean you can always just avoid them either. People assume oh ill jsut go around but the killer is right behind me so i cant oh well.
---
It's just the first time any perk shows up it's more expensive. Most of the time this means recent perks. But for example, I'm still patiently waiting for Discordance from Legion to go on the shrine and he's not really recent anymore its been over half a year since he released but Discordance will still be 2700 the first time it shows up
---
Their bodies all remind me of Patrick Bateman's body. Myers' especially. That firm, cute bum.
---
That looks badass! I love it.
---
no.
---
Freddy's traps cant be disabled.

You only get two power squats from me, take it or leave it.

I'VE ALSO BEEN TOMBSTONED AS THE DYING LIGHT OBSESSION WHILE THE DS USERS ARE NOT THE OBSESSION AND IT SUCKS.
---
THATS THE NAME. I couldn't remember the movie/killers name. He should be a killer! Thatd be awesome.
---
I personally not only use glams to look pretty but because I feel that muted colours make me more invisible. If it's true or not I don't care, I feel safer. That's why I don't wear bright colours or play with characters that only own brighter glams. 
---
If you like it, wear it, not every match is a good one for everyone :)
---
Like with a hammer?
---
I always feel sorry for her. She didn't deserve this after the awful thing she gone through in her life.
---
But then again most of Freddy's victims are sympathetic characters, which make him all the more deplorable.
---
Lol what the best killers are all free though are you high as fuck
---
WE MUST SAVE THIS INNOCENT MANS KARMA
---
that just happened to me, i restarted my console and it seemed to work, maybe try again?
---
Rebuild database if that does not work redownload it
---
'It doesnt matter if your in the dream world or not' Why are people so stupid. They keep spearding this false info, saying that you shouldnt clense either and just play the whole game broken. 
---
Being Alseep: Makes it harder to track Freddy, gives his teleport a much faster cooldown, lets you be affected by his traps. It can also apply a debuff if he has add ons. 
---
There is no way to make the Freedy you want work in this game. He wont be able to be super powerful i nthe dream world due to mechainces.
---
Mhmmm I think people are really jumping the gun calling his snares worthless
---
My man, don't let your anxiety win, fight that bitch, use your cosmetics.
---
You like them, you paid for them, IDC if you go down in the first minute an suicide on hook, show them digs mate!
---
So until Freddy hits someone he's just a M1 Killer? No thanks.
---
My only issue with old freddy is that it felt like nobody played him, I literally never get into games against him and with the rework more people are probably gonna be playing him. It's better than just seeing Billy and Nurse and Spirit over and over
---
Are we really defending D/Cing?
---
#I am you bitch
---
Whoosh. I literately used that same argument as you about Freddy not being stealth with Huntress and you fell for it lmao. I don't care how you put it Freddy is not a stealth killer. If you think so then you should probably write a letter to BHVR cause I'm sure you know a lot more about Freddy's design then they do and I'm sure they would be happy to offer you a job on the balance team.
---
It uses your charge according to how long you were channeling it, with a minimum of about 25% of your charge, it seems.
---
Nope, everyone needs to cleanse totems to show the entity they can't decorate worth shit.
---
Her outfit is badass!
---
Do we
---
Yup 😥
---
I mean, she's the perfect survivor, she is thicc but not so much like jane, she's has the best face in game, she has physics too, she is not quiet but is not fucking loud like jane, she's is our queen, she is a country singer and the most important thing, she is badass as hell, praise kate denson the queen
---
Its so long because one: Its passive and he has to do nothing. Plague timer is about 30 seconds when she does nothing, Deep Wounds is 20. Hits also have it happen immdnetly. 
---
Two: The Dressers can give him away anyway. So can Trapper Traps, Jigsaw boxes, fountains, Myers tier up music, any killer with a debuff on the status screen, Billy and LF with their loud chainsaws. 
---
Freddy isn't a stealth killer anymore.
---
Ok man, think what you want. It seems to me like you're going out of your way to try to be dismissive of his snares without giving adequate time to practice and figure how you can effectively use them.
---
Ikr, such a queen
---
Idk every time I play I get more heated over my idiotic teammates than the killer. I mean you shouldn't bitch at the killer for killing lol
---
I'm not speaking for all survivors you derp. I'm talking about my own group. I understand that not everyone on either side is exactly the same.
---
Treasure Hunting gang roll up
---
Also don't care about the survivors if you're the killer or even if you're solo, I edited the comment a lot (lol) but you're playing for your enjoyment. I'm not saying to be a complete dick about it but my general rule is to give what you get. If its an even game then I definitely try my best to win or escape, if I stomp the survivors then I might start to ease up, but you're job is the escape or kill so you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
damn that sounds awful. well i'll bet you know to try reinstalling/verifying/ installing on a different drive. I wish you luck in the issue not persisting
---
He is invisble up to 32 meters where he still has a complety normal TR. From everything ive seen, you barely even notice his stealth at all in any game because the ranges of it suck for it to be useful.
---
I do see myself liking new Freddy, but I’m really gonna miss old Freddy. Part of the reason why I liked old Freddy was because he was a perfect stealth killer to me. They essentially changed everything I like about Freddy, but I do like new Freddy. Guess I’ll have to find a different stealth killer to play.
---
I kinda feel that you lost some credibility on that obsession D-strike comment. The obsession can no longer just use DS you have got to be tunneling off hook for that to happen.
---
Also guesses are not mind-games but luck based.(Some seem to like that only when it benefits a certain side) Also with every update the totem placement change as well. So unless you bring maps or use small game(which is at best an okay perk.)
---
As I said before I want counter-play not nerfs.
---
Broke: 2blink nurse
---
Woke: 1blink nurse
---
Bespoke: noblink spirit fury nurse.
---
Bateman, the Psycho, coming this fall to Dead by Daylight.  
---
His power is called Ambiguity. When playing as the Psycho, survivors aren't sure whether or not you actually killed anyone, and everyone will be at each other's necks disagreeing about what parts of the trial really happened and which ones were just made up in your head.
---
is this a sc from the mobile version?
---
He just means triggered while Freddy's not around I imagine
---
Mount Ormand resort with the basement in the main building?
---
look at it this way; since his new power is actually fairly decent it'll take you less time to get the hang of it than the original.
---
They put a fair amount of effort into reworking Wraith (not as good as Billy or Nurse but imo he’s better than before) &amp; Freddy so they deserve praise for that, albeit BHVR took 1-2ish years to release both.
---
No but you are injured the whole game and cant heal
---
I just had a thought while I was reading this. Imagine STBFL on Freddy. Everybody's asleep all the time, especially when they're clumped up.
---
I dont main them either, for many reasons. I play them yes but i pefer to murder everyone in my path.
---
Which will still cause you to scream and reveal your location to him.
---
Then what's the point of this perk lol
---
I think they mean that if you have a “perfect” SWF and a “perfect” killer, the SWF will always win &amp; escape.
---
Some perks benefit from being injured so maybe having it active kicks in the other perks
---
“HEY BOIS, ITS A WRAITH!”
---
Is this outfit matching with Kate? Because it looks that way to me. ♥
---
That’s when you bring the noed, blood warden, mori triple threat
---
Na i think Myers with tombstone works better, it's awesome!
---
Billy that needs Ruin is usually a bad Billy.
---
I love it! How are you able to see these outfits?
---
I'm not nea but I'm in this post and I dont like it
---
Thanks! I'm looking forward for the midchapter
---
Then african americans should probably stop wearing Tshirts, baseball caps, cargo shorts, etc.  
---
Nobody is saying "this is african american culture".  It's something imitating it because they like the style.  That should be taken as a sign of admiration or respect.
---
A true gentleman
---
Is the 3.0 leaked dev build, my friend copied the ptb 3.1 outfits to the dev build so well be able to look at the cosmetics in depth
---
At least it was you spanning next to it and not a surv
---
3.8 Roentgen... Not great, not terrible.
---
Hey, I'm minding the gold perk, why is it gold?
---
You knew this was coming, pete!
---
Don't feel too bad man I'm mildly autistic.
---
I won't see it even if I wasn't looking for it
---
You really gonna sit here and say the majority of the community are killer mains????? Lmao
---
Good work, fellow pig
---
Two power squats and a point emote final offer
---
Honestly why don’t we have Shia Lebeouf as a killer already
---
At higher levels it’s muffled, but it’s mainly a perk that provides unlimited recoveries from dying. Most people use it with tenacity to recover faster while moving, or dead hard so they can dodge when they need to.
---
yes
---
it was perfect. I just waked around and looked at them and they looked at me and looked down
---
