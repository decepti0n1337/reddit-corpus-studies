Haha nah not that much. Went right over my headüòÖ
---
Remake Freddy looks more ghoulish, but the DBD version makes him look like a cancer survivor.
---
Maybe she jumped in the ded
---
I love the 1k now I had the juiciest set up of like 4 totems in a row and I has 4k boldness before I even did anything else
---
I‚Äôm getting Jeff p3 then get all perks for him not because I‚Äôm a wannabe jake main it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt see jeff mains I only saw 2 Jeff mains through out when the legion dlc came out
---
As a Quinton main i must say we are very rare due to the fact swf Quinton are killing friendly Quintons
---
I usually can find one any time but it takes anywhere from 2-10 minutes.
---
Something tells me you're a pig main, just a guess.
---
Same, just pointing out how much power they removed from FF. The stun is definitely the worst part now and is probably the biggest reason why I tend to avoid using FF in the midgame.
---
Bing bong boi is husbando
---
I agree the add ons part. There's not a funny one, only a try hard one (iri head) and then basically add ons to prevent survivors to dead hard for example. Still, I would've put Huntress in A tier but that's your list not mine, so I respect.
---
Jesus someone shat in your cereal.
---
Considering that the only two things that are hidden are Moris, Splinters, and Shrouds it's kind of dumb to have them hidden at all. So it would definitely be better to have everything hidden for Killer offerings.
---
What you are talking about is called game throwing/harassment. Camping/tunneling is just the way the cookie crumbles. If the killer wants to be depipped, get zero or occasionally one kill and a serious bp reduction than good on them.
---
I used to think she was op as fruck but when I played against the pig for a few matches her weaknesses became clear but it took some time. I think most of the killers that have been brutally nerfed were great the way they were, I think it would be better to atleast try to get a understanding before asking for a new killer to get nerfed like with ghostbro. Free my man ghostbro from the nerf chain
---
Mori's everyone, most likely tunnelled/camped, and still wonders why he didn't pip.
---

---
Lol
---
As a plague player I use the black incense which reveals em every time they puke so  either way it‚Äôs a win win for me
---
Postal 2 is a great game but it doesn't work like that, hatchets go through pallets as you throw them
---
So lucky of the hatch to spawn there! Beautiful play
---
Leaving the game is just as cheap and being a poor teammate you can signal the camp then stay alive as long as possible on the hook so your team can just do gens then leave.
---
How about you don't camp the hook and actually play the game and have fun instead of standing still in 1 game
---
I've been losing a pip when someone fails to connect during the loading screen. Twice.
---
Reduced accuracy of a straight line totally makes a difference.   /s
---
But yeah, she has a brown-tier addon, Torn Bookmark, that gives a third blink  at the cost of max range and chain blink window time. Neither or those makes much of a difference but the addon is very common, cheap, and adds a huge benefit to the strongest power in game.
---
Although, I do notice that accuracy reduction does make those quick direction changes slightly farther. Like when someone jukes the first blink, your second blink goes slightly to the left or right. Not even close to enough that it makes you miss the hit, but just barely enough that I actually notice.
---
But it is an infinite until you do this ;) So yes, there are infinites
---
Wow you really thought this out. Nice job
---
What was the pussy dc for?
---
Yeah, it's necessary.  Sorry - it's a horrible perk because it's literally just RNG.  I rarely have Ruin last more than a minute and I'm at rank 10.  But it's basically necessary because gens are too easy to complete.
---
[removed]
---
I feel like bleeding love is kind of useless
---
Meanwhile Amanda's being nerfed :'(
---
I'm not going to apologize for pointing out the stupidity of someone. I value both my time and money and BVHR has failed at offering a decent product of which I have invested both in because of their abysmal QA and piss poor use of the PTB.
---
Connor!!
---
I kind of intended it that way, but it does dodge MoM, so it has a slight advantage. But its intended to be a meme perk.
---
Just had a game and it didnt get broke. 
---
I find it always depends on maps and where it spawns for the most part. I like my perk loadout the way it is for the most part.
---
I run ruin, discordance, bamboozle and bbq and ruin. I imagine most people will tell me to take off bamboozle, but when im in the higher ranks survivors will loop you until the game is over. Which bamboozle counters very well.
---
Range addons are needed to make his shock useful but they increase charge time to the level it becomes useless anyway.
---
Beside that his addons are okay, the problem is madness itself, without addons doesn't do anything.
---
Well I know but is it actually 5 different versions? Is it permanent?
---
I've had something similar happen to me on PS4 too, I've discovered it's honestly best to go all the way back to the main menu of DBD before closing the application. Still agree it needs to be fixe dhtough.
---
Wraith has at least silent approach...
---
Thanks! Its the first in a line of tarot card themed killers I'm theory crafting, any preferences on which card next?
---
She up and wasted the god pallet
---
"dad some guy on reddit fucked your future dead body I'm sorry"
---
fuoff
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted.
---
It was an honest mistake, and you did say ‚Äúnot my art‚Äù.
---
I think the zombie family would be cool, have a killer control extra ai to do stuff as well to help out.
---
Ya know seeing wraith, Im surprised he isnt any lower since his power feels like its not about stealth but making sure to get close enough to the survivor so that the speed ramp from uncloaking hits.
---
Drugs are bad mmkay
---
Someone had kindred while someone is on the hook and if the killer goes near them everyone can see him simple
---
Shit like this pisses me off even when I'm the killer in the situation, i usually just let the sandbagged leave and go after the sandbagger.
---
Have you read the rest? Tenacity is shit, unbreakable is not. It's like comparing Wake Up and Adrenaline. Both end game perks but Adrenaline is balanced because it's a deserved one time use and very powerful, Wake Up is not balanced for same reasons.
---
On top of that, Shrouds are worthless. I've used them several times, and the Survivors still spawn on the same side of the map.
---
Maybe stop playing so sweaty, nerd.

At least you made the red rank DC.
---
Outplayed, amazed she didnt dc.
---
I'm a killer main, I play survivor with friends. üôÑüôÑ
---
Yeah, I read it, and I'm ignoring it for the most part. I even addressed it in my comment: "Tenacity is another perk entirely." Have *you* read the rest?
---
Wake Up! and Adrenaline do two completely different things. They can't be compared.
---
what's pegs?
---
Yo wtf why are super intelligent scientists playing this game
---
You're meant to do more than just one thing for the entire match. The game wants you to do a little bit of everything, not just stay doing one thing for the entire match.
---
I learned a lot about playing Killer by watching tru3. He has an ego, but he's not obnoxious as other streamers.
---
Jokes on you, with or without the totem I will have your asses at rank 1
---
Oh boy, I just had a game where Claudette and I spawned in the shack. She immediatly throws down the pallet, then goes to the gen. I stare at her, then leave, Freddy comes and kills her, she disconnects.
---
*fin*
---
if youre working on a generator, your hitbox doesnt get smaller only the character. So basically you have your standing hitbox while youre repairing
---
Slug Nurse should do the trick.
---
The design for this Freddy was the 2009 remake of NOEM
---
God, those are spot on. 
---
Feels bad for poor Jeff.
---
I get trapper every 3-4 games lol (red ranks), hes a solid B imo
---
Someone point me in the direction of these "nice" Pig mains. I swear every Pig game I get is an awful, awful experience.
---
Dedicated servers when!?
---
The killer shouldn't be punished by the game, he should be punished by you, end of. If you're playing solo run the perks that help your team not just you. If I'm on my own i usually look to see what's Harrison and use perks that help the team. If the killer calls I'll always go off and start another gen. I'm not gonna give him time.
---
A sweaty PC nurse vs a bunch of controllers
---
Lost items too.
---
He's saying his SWF is a group of monkeys and would give you a free game because they care more about having fun than being sweaty.
---
Hmm your flair says otherwise 
---
So instead of doing the objective of the game I should go chase the killer and let myself get hooked so my team can get save points
---
And you bothered to engage in conversation with these chumps?
---
kinda true and sad tho when I was in the UK for the holiday you see homeless people everywhere :pensive:
---
I'm not complaining about the killer, its the survivors. I don't care about having a bad game because of shitty tactics, I care because my team play like lemons.
---
Why hide? I like a little dad pudge.
---
I'm trying to work on my listening skills. Right now I can't hear steps or breathing very well. Groans of pain I can do allright. I very rarely phase out and manage to hit someone based on sound alone.
---
Do you have any tips or does it just come with time?
---
Interesting, I don't see him too much, usually only when climbing. 
---
He seems like a decent Killer with the right addons, but most of the time survivors disarm a lot of his traps and loop him for ages.
---
that's an easy We Going To Live For Ever stack right there.
---
Literally everyone in D tier is better than pig what are you on
---
Yes.
---
Worth.
---
It.
---
That's... what i put
---
I mean, he uses takes many pills to stay awake sooooo...
---
Thank god it‚Äôs not just me who thought this
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
As I said in a similar post a while back, I'd rather become a willing Killer than a broken Survivor. I'm sure I'd abuse my power, which the Entity may or may not like, depending on whether it can comprehend my actions.
---
What pussies.
---
Cleansing gives Plague access to corrupt purge which is her vomit that can damage instead of infecting. The downside to this is you are 1 hit down and Plague has things to make that a bad idea. Things such as: Black Incense, Apples, Thanatophobia, Iridescent Seal, being generally competent.
---
I say Make it so when a hex totem is destroyed if there's a full totem on the map that dull totem becomes the hex totem that was destroyed this happens 5 minutes after the first hex is destroyed.
---
Jeff&gt;Jake
---
I believe Pig has good mind game potential and game slowdown with RBT. I think she is underestimated greatly.
---
IIRC, there was a post somewhere that the Entity punishes Killers that don't obey it or otherwise displease it. By the same logic, I'm sure it would appreciate someone harvesting the fleeting hope and dashed dreams it uses for sustenance.
---
Don't get your hopes up, remember Last Year and F13?
---
Keep your expectations low and you'll never be disappointed.
---
I mean.. I‚Äôd be down for the angry princess.. I guess.. please..
---
Can confirm
---
How? lol
---
PC, Ingame/Menu, every time I finish a game as survivor (dying or escaping), I get a "rank update error". I don't have a screenshot of what the message looks like as of 3.1.0, however, prior to the update, the error looked like [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/449930181373591553/604832735076417542/Desktop_Screenshot_2019.06.24_-_20.50.11.18.png]this.[/url] As of the current update, it just says "Rank Update Error; There was an issue updating your rank" and then boots me back to the starting screen. I don't know how to replicate this issue, any info would be greatly appreciated.
---
Honestly I believe the hard cap is the problem it should be a soft cap at 8k points per category. Because not every game is even some games you get capped in altruism because of a good killer or none at all cause of a bad killer not hitting / hooking. This way you would be able to at least not have to kill yourself in the focus of getting altruism / boldness points. Either make the category that‚Äôs capped then bleed into other category‚Äôs like altruism bleeds into survival.
---
Hell yesüòèüòèüòè, ill let her chase me all game.ü§£
---
Fucking Colorado is like this too. When will people realize unconditional liberalism is easily taken advantage of.
---
Myers is the most fun but spirit and clown are fun as hell too. Ghostface is good to counter tbaggers. Plague kinda hurts sometimes to use tbh.
---
Just make Ruin a permanent killer ability.
---
Oh I would. I'd get what I wanted, and it'd get what it wanted.
---
Wraith is very fun to play as, indeed. Ghost Face however is, for me, much more fun than Wraith, but I didn't gave them those positions due to personal enjoyment. It was mostly how Survivors can interact with the Killer's power and their add-ons. Wraith has very interesting add-ons, but almost all of them offer no real interaction with Survivors, altho it's fun for both sides when he jumpscares properly.
---
Still, it was somewhat conflicting for myself to put GF in tier A rather than B exactly because he lacks a proper build-up, making every trial a wild goose chase with a lot of attrition that doesn't really grow in some way. That's something that maybe could have been solved by add-ons, but it isn't. It's not something that undermines his fun factor tho, but I recognize that as a personal opinion.
---
Yes cover your mouth instead of checking on the kid you just bitch slapped into the hard tile floor.
---
Well first of all the universal counter to pig mind games is to just run to another they‚Äôre not great but they‚Äôre okay.
---
But I‚Äôm D tier we have
---
Clown who turns most safe loops into unsafe ones, 
---
Michael who has an instant down with amazing snowball and decent stealth
---
Freddy who can also cut off loops and has amazing map mobility 
---
And Ghostface who has good stealth and instant down potential 
---
Pig isn‚Äôt anything compared to these guys imo. She‚Äôs one of the worst killers in the game no question.
---
"Yes officer, this one here"
---
No he did not "definitely" cheat.
---
It's a bug where sometimes as survivor you won't get the entity blocker applied to you but the killer sees it anyway.
---
I wish, but the lack of add-ons that would change his gameplay or give him some kind of build-up for the trial makes it very hard to place him higher, which is very sad because he is so extremely fun to play as and full of potential lol
---
Wtf
---
He didn't do shit to glitch it.
---
It's a random glitch that happens without any conditions needing to bet met.
---
That's why it's been in the game for ages and the devs still haven't been to isolate it, it happens completely randomly and the survivors have no way of triggering it on their accord.
---
Wait, she got nerfed again?
---
That obsession Myers is beautiful
---
Freddy sits beside Clown on my tier list. Which is high B. He has varsity with his powers, but he's not ridiculously power with it, regardless of add-ons. He doesn't have to stop to restock his power somewhere on the map, but his power in of itself doesn't cause damage to anyone.
---
Again, it's a random glitch that occurs randomly with the survivor having zero way of intentionally triggering it.
---
Reporting them would do nothing.
---
have you played against enough Pigs? They literally all camp and tunnel whoever they put their trap on, she is by far one of the least fun killers to play against if you take into account her stereotypes.
---
On PC
---
Not sure whether it's an update or a bug, WGLF no longer grants stacks if killer hits you while carrying someone. Affects all killers.
---
Equip WGLF, while killer is carrying someone, run over and take a hit.
---
Expected results: Gaining an easy stack for 
---
Actual results: Nothing at all
---
Yeah, that's what makes me sad. His add-ons are very versatile and offer him different ways to jumpscare Survivors properly, but mostly Wraith players just try to get real close and get an easy first hit or trap you in a corner.
---
It's full of good intentions, but easy to use badly in an unfun way because Survivors have no real agency over/with his power.
---
'In agreement'
---
Why not
---
I want to say that it is too much of a buff. At least the survivor has several chances to get rid of the perk/totem by cleansing the dull totems that are on the map. Plus, it will give them something else to do besides the objective; which is repairing the generator.
---
they should make it so whenever he bumps into an object a nuclear explosion goes off and instantly kills any survivor within a 32 meter radius
---
Is a pig main that uses Jake the small percentage they play survivor. Lmao
---
Teleporting has a hefty cooldown. Snares and Pallets only affect you when you're asleep. He has no true map pressure when people are awake and can work on gens.
---
Ruin has plenty of counter play. Hitting greats, This Is Not Happening, Stake Out, Toolboxes with larger skill check add ons and speed add ons or Gen Tapping. Most survivors run Self Care, so make that a permanent survivor ability for balance if you must. I‚Äôm a survivor main by the way for what that‚Äôs worth.
---
Why, what's going on?
---
Clown: A fatter Freddy with better slow down power.
---
okay if you shit on my boy jesus once more i will kidnap your dog and treat it better than you do
---
It kinda happened reverse for me I got called a bitch for using unbreakable
---
It‚Äôs not the stabbing and killing that‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs the power legion has that is boring. Specifically not the ‚Äústabbing and killing‚Äù but the power itself. ‚ÄúJust stab all four survivors‚Äù lmao okay right. Like they‚Äôre all together all the time for that to work and isn‚Äôt a circumstantial case? Legion is the worst killer by far just to play as/play against.
---
Dead meme.
---
Yea big oofs for pig
---
Lmao, what? 
---
And what the hell are you talking about? My point is that you're meant to do more than just get chased by the killer. Do gens, be altruistic, maybe even cleanse some totems and search some chests. Be bold and defend your teammates from the killer.
---
Yeah it would have been more trouble and money to use the actress‚Äô likeness. Which I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd agree to depending on what she wants.
---
fake, i get hit over character height rocks a lot by good huntresses in chase
---
I know that, why are you bringing this up?
---
It was only once for me.
---
Oh sorry. I was suggesting to all the Hex perk like Ruin, that is including: Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Huntress Lullaby, Ruins, The Third Seal and Thrill of the Hunt. 
---
My bad. I'll edit the Title.
---
I cannot believe you went back for the save. Absolute madman. Great play.
---
Dude, right? They always place the bear trap on your head and then tunnel you to death anyway.
---
Worst map probably Haddonfield can cancel his stalk through fences but he can't stalk over them
---
Fix your eyes.
---
Big facts. People want to whine and complain like they‚Äôre helpless but there actually is something they could have done to prevent it.
---
They don't exist, they're either just really annoying or toxic.

Survivors don‚Äôt like to swallow their pride and just accept that they got outplayed. (Trust me I play both sides) I also that kind of y‚Äôall when I use something like ruin and thanta.
---
Actually at a convention recently Shawnee Smith was asked how she felt about Amanda in DBD and she just said she was sad that they didn't ask her to do the work for her since she's so protective of the character. I feel as she would've given her likeness of they ever approached her.
---
But going for boxes when you can't see them is a complete waste of time. As long as the trap is inactive you don't have to worry about it, the visible auras make more people want to do the boxes first.
---
Having an active trap isn't too big of a problem if she's not using both tempered timer and crate of gears, and if she's just waiting for you at the boxes then you can just get into a chase. Sure you might die, but you are basically guaranteeing your team a win.
---
&gt;And if you even do something as simple as chase people off their box
---
Camping boxes and chasing trapped people is a really crappy way of using her power. You are going after people who are not going for gens and are instead giving people who can do gens a ton of free time. You are not slowing the game down, you are giving up on pressuring the map to try to get a trap pop.
---
I thought we agreed to not kink shame.
---
You sound retarded, so it makes sense why you would think that.
---
Anyone who complains about going against swf is just sad. Yes, if people play a party game with communication, they have a better chance at winning. Maybe make some friends fucking loser lmaooo
---
huntress in herself is B tier, add that half the maps in the game is shit for her and she drops to C tier
---
We just sandbag eachother, not the randoms.
---
No... no... don't worry about saving me. She's face-camping. :\^)
---
Where‚Äôs the shitpost flair
---
Literally every killer in existence is hard to deal with for new survivors. But they are known to complain about stealth killers the most
---
That's quite the coincidence because I'm mocking dicheads like you for getting so butthurt over a taunt that you use it to justify toxicity
---
Imagine being so bad at killer that you have to make a fake account pretending to be some whiny survivor
---
He fucking he eyed himself through the window it was absolutely glorious
---
That meme format took me back to my childhood man haha.
---
Yeeted
---
A streamer called Umbra has that bug.
---
Although she deserves it for being a sore loser. (If you beat her when she's playing huntress she'll throw a hissy fit about how the game is unbalanced and it's so unfair how she lost).
---
She's the only other person I've seen with this bug.
---
Eh, why does a grown man needs protection?  Very infantalizing.
---
I also find the idea of giving Dwight a preference just because he's might be new is very off-putting, not to mention create an unfairness to other new players using other characters.
---
"Alright, you can't do anything untill that trap is off your head and your teamates are probably doing gens... better chase you for the rest of the game just to be safe"
---
No, but the "it's the killer's job to killer" shit is. I mentioned that killing people off as fast as possible hurts both sides of the game.
---
But hey, as long as you're trying to keep the match on longer, you're already a step ahead of some other toxic players
---
I dunno,fatigue time addons are good too tbh
---
My partners father has one of those, it is like a hand-held spotlight I swear
---
oh no, you're not allowed to have an opinion about their precious streamer /s
---
DS sucks it's literally a non problem you wait 1 min after the unhook if your stupid enough to tunnel then I have no words
---
Well that's good to hear. And yeah, do whatever you want when the game is about to end, especially if you haven't killed anyone yet.
---
Actual meghead
---
Like R6S with skulls in China üòÇ
---
thats literally his whole point, it would give survivors the incentive to search out all the totems, he means that when you cleanse it, it will reappear on a dull totem, so if there are no dull totems left. there will be no where for the perk to manifest, similar to how noed works now with the gens being powered. it would also give survivors something else to do than 80 sec gens
---
What we really need is a left for dead killer
---
A UK political party released an ad promoting their policies to address homelessness. Unfortunately they chose the slogan "We're going to cut the homeless in half by 2025."
---
I‚Äôm new to the game, only had the game a week, how exactly did they nerf the character?
---
Codes/ciphers in the descriptions of anniversary weapons that devs said we're decipherable
---
Why didn‚Äôt you use balanced
---
I‚Äôm sure my screams are loud enough for all to hear across Australia anyway.
---
Wait wtf did they do to her now? Can they stop?
---
Killing is tohcksick, you boolie.
---
All of this is wrong
---
nurse and huntress have my fav abilities mainly bc they take the most skill and they are fun to play around with.
---
Sometimes we need a little protection, regardless of age or gender. :')
---
The Scranton Brothers. Maybe they are all from The Office.
---
Nurse is the only Killer we have for R1 probably because she is so powerful with her broken add-ons that Survivors need to be balanced in ways that make them a challenge for her. I don't know if the devs are trying to pull some kind of linear progression with Nurse being some kind of "last boss" but if they are this is the very wrongest game to do so with this ladder system.
---

---
Also during a stream, which I can't find right now.
---
Yeah, the second Deep Wounds rework completely broke this perk.  If the gens get done this perk becomes a ridiculous get out of jail free card.
---
Dead by Daylight but it's The Office
---
The salt, my meal is ruined
---
Look how they massacred my boy :(
---
Everybody gangsta till the hitbox fuck you
---
First of all they're trying to waste your time, stop chasing them and go apply pressure on gens
---
Second of all you're Clown, your kit is designed to end chases early, so git gud
---
Better hide spots for totems is a better idea, not like new badham bs spots lvl but better than u know the actual spots u can get.
---
Haven't checked but you still do pull them into your dream world.
---
thats the problem with dbd, "hey nurse is in a good/great spot and the rest are shit outside of spirit and maybe billy if you somehow manage to get chainsawed." so lets balance survivors so nurse vs survivors are a fair match and every other killer gets fucked 10/10 game design - IGN
---
I wanted to see how it would end. And I wanted to see if they had any point in any of their sayings. Apparently, they did not. It's just a never ending arguement, where you are the clear winner, but, the idiot laughing their ass off on the other side of their screen, thinks he's right. 
---
I have now made a promise to myself to just ignore any and everything that people have to say about mt playstyle.
---
No mither, iron will, self care, unbreakable
---
 &gt; How about you ~~dont camp hook~~ get atleast 2 sacrifices before gens get done or else anything you do afterward means nothing
---
The guy in the back is the one good survivor trying to do the 3 close gens but getting chased out by the killer
---
s a m e
---
A man of culture I love it.
---
If you play solo, you gotta play with your best interests in mind. Half your team is dead and your other teammate isn't doing shit in the hopes the killer finds you while they look for hatch? 2 can play that game.
---
Yep.  Unfortunately that's just how the game is made - passing on an easy down because another survivor was a potato or an asshole can cost you.
---
That's the best threat I've ever seen. I'll be stealing that like Hag steals my heart
---
There so many small ways it could effect you, and then you could change the worthless mist offerings to subtract from survivor luck offerings

Plague has a nice build-up, depending a lot on Survivors making choices about either healing themselves to the expense of giving Plague more power, or run around coughing and injured to end the game faster and gimp her while gimping themselves. She can trap interactive objects for some time, forcing Survivors to make even more choices. I was somewhat conflicted about her position, but I think the devs went the right direction with her.
---
Spirit is the one I'm conflicted the most. Her power allows Killers to behave in multiple different ways, making each Spirit player behave somewhat differently, and she has good potential for jumpscares, but isn't quite *there* imho. She barely squeezed herself into the A tier because she is the most mindgame-y of the Killers.

And when Bill does come out on PS4: *I'm so glad you're here*
---
I know new gestures were leaked but I didn't expect this
---
They can be placed anywhere a pallet could spawn.
---
I dont think i need it because i know the maps really well. I just use it to plan my loops better and see what's left on the map later in the game. I will try it though.
---
You should check r/dbdgonegay
---
The funny thing is The Pale Rose had most of these problems and right after it's rework they added yamaoka
---
Spirit should probably be at the bottom, right above Nurse.
---
She's really fun to play as, but playing against a spirit who has ears is awful.
---
Once your injured against spirit, it's GG, unless you have iron will, then you might be able to make a play. But the Spirit can always run Stridor just as a little "fuck you". Spirit is almost as one sided as Nurse.  
---
Also, her """mindgames""" which include: standing still at a pallet, aren't really mindgames.
---
I‚Äôm pretty much the same but it‚Äôs saved me once or twice from deadzoning later in the match.
---
Seriously. If I depip it mostly just means I won‚Äôt have to play against another fucking nurse.
---
yep I agree. When I play against nurse as survivor I get so bored so quickly bc of how good she is so I def see why people don't like the nurse.
---
These videos are always incredible. I really appreciate how you go in-depth on the numbers for add-ons, because BHVR's "slightly/moderately/considerably/tremendously" method is terrible and doesn't seem to actually mean anything.
---
Stop dead harding the question.
---
With the plague if you cleanse youre screwed and if you dont clease youre screwed. Me personally i cleanse depending if the plague knows what she is doing or if youre on a map thats easy to break LoS
---
Forgot to include in title, It's trapper.
---
This sub would actually enjoy fucking that thing in the ass
---
Whoa that was definitely unecessary nerf.
---
Least they're diverse...
---
Yeah love getting BT'd before I can leave the hook with 0 counterplay.
---
I would not say so, but I‚Äôve always known the definition of immersed survivors to urban around the map and do basically nothing, maybe get an unhook if the opportunity arises?
---
II tend to be a little altruistic which is why I run d-strike :3 Otherwise there would be no need if you think you‚Äôre not going to get hooked at least once during the match I guess lol
---
She‚Äôs really not. She doesn‚Äôt play dead by daylight, she plays her own games and all the normal survivor tools to go against killers become worthless. She‚Äôs a horribly designed killer made only because it was the dev‚Äôs weird ass decision to try and counter infinites.
---
When I play Pig it‚Äôs always the first one.
---
Oh I'm sorry lemme just let 2 people escape when the gens are done instead of securing another kill
---
Damn, my joke was not funny.
---
Never seen anything about the time travel, some more things to add, Freddy and Michael are from Ohio and Illinois respectively, and Amanda is from New York. Although I am still interested in seeing how the Entity's power would've spread so much that it was able to take people from Japan and Babylon(modern day Syria). It is also mentioned that Jed Olsen was taken from Pennsylvania. Hag has no real clues as to where she was taken from, but I'd probably say somewhere in Europe when when paganism was practiced, so likely a little before the dark ages
---
Yeah I know which one you're talking about too. That shit always spawns for me when I'm a survivor and let's be real, anyone with a brain is gonna abuse it and I abuse it to it's max because of the double long loop and window vault with 2 pallets and I run balanced so that loop is godly. You can waste a whole match running the killer by that building that has the gen upstairs when those tracks spawn the double pallets. 
---
I've never seen it spawn when I'm the killer but if it ever did I would just walk away. It's not even worth a fraction of effort because it's so broken.
---
&gt; Huntress mains will never use m1 because they are "Top tier chads" and will instead go for the hatchet plays [....] Just don't say to them that Huntress is a mid tier killer at best because they will scream.
---
I'm a Huntress main, and this is so me. For the last time she is top tier REEEEEEEEEE
---
Nurse is not fun or fair at all in general
---
At least you can play the game. I can't because there's a half an hour que and with this insanely hot weather no thank you
---
Because nobody wants to get bullied for 6 games before they depip into a rank where their killer isn‚Äôt assfire
---
Hehe,  i will give it a try!
---
I feel like you're pretty much right.
---
the routing of unlocking teachables you choose is very unconventional but i like it. if you wanna go down the road of that playstyle dwight would definitly be your next target.
---
Macmillan estate is the second best map other than autohaven for pallets and they continually double spawn next to each other on those maps. I'm not talking about shelter woods either. I understand how and why they do double spawn. It's just on certain specific maps it's busted.
---
Na, corn maps r his worst same for Myers.
---
It‚Äôs literally more canon than these stupid fucking things. And far more Amanda‚Äôs style- These boxes you can actually win, meaning that they‚Äôre 110% not made by Amanda ‚ÄúKerry Killer‚Äù Young.
---
Now make em kiss
---
He can‚Äôt stalk through corn!!!
---
I don't go for the hooked guy no matter what, I just go for the one who is the closest to me. If that happens to be the unhooked guy, RIP to them. But sometimes I feel the urge to go for the unhooked one even if the one who saved him tries to block me just to send them a message like "This is what happens when you are stupid, Meg, now you have one less survivor on your team, **Meg** ."
---
It's just a troll account, best to just downvote and move on.
---
Quentin looks high 24/7
---
I could. I should!
---
gg
---
Yeah, hes fun for nobody
---
But still, with every new chapter it means you have one or two extra characters to lvl up and all that.
---
Besides, wouldn't it be just better if Devs just set the BP to double until they come up with a better bloodweb concept?
---
You're more boosted than Neil Armstrong.
---
The data might not have been faked, but it wasn't enough trials to give an actual conclusion on how it works. It's coded to be random, and like all random things, it's well... random.
---
It‚Äôs just a theory... A GAME THEORY! Thanks for watching
---
SwF is OP but you were Clown, a character made to stop loops. You had to have played poorly
---
He got a 4k. He should pip anyway.
---
I cant believe these fucking clowns still haven't fixed this shit.
---
Oh wait it's BHVR, so yeah, I can.
---
Unless he's got green beast marks, then if you're somewhat close you are going down.
---
Every time I play as ghost face I am always t-bagged at every pallet stun then when they get downed and do it back I‚Äôm a ‚ÄúToxic Killer.‚Äù
---
No wonder his suit makes so much stretching noise...
---
The problem with Survivor perks is that most are situational. You‚Äôre never gonna spend a game saving others doing gens getting chased all at once, and you won‚Äôt really know until you get in which you need to do. All killer perks revolve around the one thing they do, kill, but survivors have to do 1-3 things a game.
---
That would be too much for a single perk to do. Like no mither which reduces grunting by 50%, can recover while downed, and makes you permanently hurt. Every other perk just has one purpose
---
it still says that you can interupt survivors jumping into the hatch by catching them
---
Don‚Äôt listen to this guy. Urban Evasion is useless at higher ranks
---
Same, that or Jeepers Creepers.
---
That's so awesome!!
---
Next time upload the whole match
---
Yeah it's the worst when you've ran the killer around for a bit and your team does fuck all. Then they come to save you and get caught instantly.
---
I think you got the wrong idea from my post. Kinda took the idea of camping boxes and ran with it. I never said that you should camp boxes, but there are scenarios where you can only find the survivor doing the box, and in that case, it's not always a bad idea to scare them off of it. It'll take up their precious time till a head pop to get back to the jigsaw box they where on, complete it, and then still possibly have to go through more. Doing that can get you a head pop, especially with tampered timer and crate of gears. Then you can run after other survivors, given you found them, and let the timer kill the one with the trap.
---
Honestly, the reason Pig's Rule Set No. 2 should be a part of her base kit (Besides it fitting in with the Saw Motif), is because it would do it's part to slow the game down, while also making traps more threatening to survivors. In their current state, they're laughable at best. You got trapped? Who cares! You can just run between Jigsaw boxes willy-nilly while your team continues gen pressure, and you'll probably be through half of them (if you don't already have your trap off) before the gen is done. It takes away any suspense the traps have, and any real threat, and instead just make them a slight hindrance to a survivor. They're not half as threatening as I think they should be.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm new to clown and got him about 2 days ago. My perks aren‚Äôt good and I probably shouldn‚Äôt of made a post about this when I‚Äôm not nearly as good as I could be with him.
---
So reading this I was wondering, do you know how things like pallets spawn on the map? Because I didn‚Äôt realize there would only be one per area...
---
i absolutly get that, thats me about 200-300 hours less in the game. at some point i just learnt that most people beeing toxic is because they can be without any form of punishment and just get a hard-on over those conversations
---
It would depend on how much the endgame timer compensated for an active trap.
---
I feel as a doctor it's kinda mandatory to keep the game going on a bit longer, as long as it's not a 3 gen doc (which I just found out about yesterday and it's the most toxic shit ever)
---
Trapper over here asserting dominance
---
Me too
---
They could also have BT so you are better off attacking the farming cunt.
---
Okay so when you're outside of a terror radius you hear her phasing if she's close but if you're in her terror radius you don't hear her phasing even if she is right on top of you her husk acts as a killer when you get close to it the terror radius gets more intense
---
Only reason you got saved is because that Kate was sure she was gonna die so she was just like FUCK IT ALTRUISM POINTS. That would have been my mindset anyway. Nice plays though
---
Usually if I'm in a good mood or I feel like a survivor deserves the dub bc of their trash team, I'll give them the hatch
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

This sounds like something you could put in over watch or league of legends, NOT dead by daylight
---
Ash smokes weed all the time in Ash vs Evil Dead.

Billy says hi

Blackbeard is still fundamentally broken and overpowered as shit if you know how to play him right

I try to be a good Pig main
---
bubba: am i a joke to you?

Who is that girl holding tue thing?

I love grabbing people off totems and gens with spirit

That works too

Why fuck me?

So keys are used to open the hatch ?
---
nah that's alright, hell, i enjoy playing Legion because i like to run around and stab people and Legion is considered to be the worst killer in the game even though he isn't. it's just so much fun to RUN and STAB people, i would play him more if the queue times weren't as awful and i had to make every killer game count
---
I am too. I just feel Clown has more interesting lore than ‚Äúi killed a guy once and had my friends stab him so now we‚Äôre sociopaths‚Äù.
---
6th sense
---
God forgive me what i‚Äòm about to do now.
---
Another little thing i noticed on that map is that in the barn you can actually hit Survivors through the fences with an M1 attack.
---
Not sure if it works on every part of them nor if it works with every killer. I only tried that once as Leatherface (I think) which kinda surprised the guy trying to use that god awful loop.
---
Lol no I get a feeling you‚Äôre a prestiged Claudette main. Guaranteed you play immersed. OP, don‚Äôt listen to this guy, instead of using UE maybe don‚Äôt be a shit teammate and run Borrowed Time. 
---
There are different styles of play but there‚Äôs only one that‚Äòs optimal: not playing with your tail tucked between your legs. Get out there and don‚Äôt be afraid to try to loop the killer. So many players get boosted to higher ranks by playing scared and relying on their team for a carry, and Urban Evasion is *always* the perk they use. Many players miss out of the survivor-killer interactions you while get while ranking up because they‚Äôre too busy hiding. Can‚Äôt gauge when to throw a pallet, when to mindgame a pallet, can‚Äôt loop the killer for more than 30-45 seconds. It may work for you  (huge doubt, would need to see gameplay) but for majority of scary players who use UE it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Maybe Billy could hammer both their kneecaps and then when they are on their knees he could shove his chainsaw in their face.
---
Nice
---
Please look at the bottom oh the comment page
---
Makes sense. The red might confuse us that it is blood.
---
how is michael even so swole?! wasn't he in a mental hospital for 15 years?
---
I got that part but my question was about the transition from outside the radius to into the radius.
---
Example: I start Phasing outside of the terror radius of the survivor -&gt; While in Phase, I progressively move closer to the survivor, to the point where the actual (invisible) Spirit is in their terror radius -&gt; I exit Phase, and find myself right next to the survivor.
---
What does the survivor all perceive in this process?
---
P
---
When is bill coming to ps4
---
Oh sorry
---
I really like the Trapper idea btw :)
---
Fair idea. I feel like for Legion another design could be one fourth of each face(in the middle of the picture) being the kids face while the rest is their respective mask. Have the knives making borders between them and you got a legion portrait.
---
"can you explain your points?"
---
"hahah u stooopid"
---
*daaaaamn you really got me
---
Yes
---
Wait what was his rework cuz wraith best boi
---
All killers are genetically altered by the Entity, even Piggy and Legion, the Entity gave them enough physical strength to perform what the killer needs to do. Destroying solid Pallets with 2 kicks, carrying an atleast average built adult on their shoulder by merely grabbing them by their booty with their left hand, swing them a bit in the air so they land on the shoulders, and damage a generator with 2 kicks. But.. Legion, Myers, LF and Piggy are the only ones that are still human, as in, their body didn't alter in any way. Myers is not fully human, so he's out.
---
So there's only Piggy, Legion and LF left as human beings that are still well and alive. Now I don't know if Legion is like all gang members are in the entity as seperate humans, or if they are all gang members in one body, which would kick them out of the list again.
---
So we're possibly left with only 2 Humans, so the "your're a normal human being, too" is understandable.
---
Yeah he mostly uploads on his 2nd channel now as most of it is stream clips
---
He's in a good spot. People need to learn to swallow their pride and just learn how to play against what was once an F-tier killer.
---
The only way to get Irridescent shards is by increasing your Player Level (The yellow Hexagon in the top right).
---
There is no way to speed that up besides playing a lot.
---
However, the higher the level the more shards you get per Level Up.
---
For more info about this: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level
---
Killing 4 with ebony mori directly off hook camping let's say should absolutely depip.  There is a way the pip system isn't designed to determine rank off kills only.  How you get them does matter and is weighted heavily.
---
If you‚Äôre trying to get medkits i suggest dropping a small amount of cash or Shards to get Quentin‚Äôs Pharmacy perk and using Plunderers as well(if you want to see chests and get a faster speed on them). I‚Äôve run 2/3 of that combo and it works wonders for altruism.
---
Nothing you can say will justify yourself to the braindead survivors who throw out hackusations like candy.
---
"How did you find me? I was hidden" Despite the fact they were working on a totem while injured. Crackling sounds, whimpering sounds.
---
They can't comprehend that you can use your ears or intuition about where they might have gone. They just rationalise that it was hacking, because they're too stupid to have done the same if they were in your position.
---
These types of players go into the game thinking they're the best in the world. They can't possibly comprehend that they were beaten fair and square, because they're that ignorant.
---
Yeah?
---
You mean leaks right?
---
What else is he gonna do but work out his body? He sure as shit didn't work out his issues.
---
Hag is way too high considering she has a camp centric playstyle with her traps and most survivors hate that.
---
I think Clown should be a tier lower I don't think he's fun to play as at all.
---
Billy should be D tier because he's just not fun to play against as a survivor unless he's bad and you can loop him endlessly.  His mobility is ridiculous especially if you're down a survivor or two.  Tons of games have gone well against a Billy and then he gets that one down and everything falls apart because of a bad save attempt.  His ping pong patrolling is super unfun to play against.
---
Nurse is not that much worse than everyone else unless you're using add-ons on Nurse.  I don't mind playing against someone on Nurse if they only have two blinks.  If they have two I'll at least feel like they had to be decent to get a hit on me.  Nurse should be D tier with Billy.
---
Yeah dude next time you're gonna make a post like this it's the end of game loadout screen you want to use. This tells us nothing other than the fact that you have 0 chase points.  Other screen would have shown us exactly why you depipped.
---
That build sounds nasty!! And I love it! If I run a Totems build I usually go Nurse or Spirit, but this one sounds more brutal.
---
Lol I'm an Ace main. I'd say don't listen to you, but the only thing I'm disagreeing with you on is that UE is not useless. I absolutely agree that the only way to get good at loops and chases is by doing them and OP should be doing those things.
---
I'm just of the belief that we shouldn't choose not to use perks because a subreddit made a stereotype about it and now if you use the perk you're a shit player.
---
But I'm not gonna clutter OP's post with a disagreement anymore, so have fun, and I hope to see you both in the fog.
---
I feel really bad as a future pig main(as i am leveling her to play currently).
---
Wait, they're needing my baby?!
---
Game health going from hemorrhaging out of multiple severed arteries to stage 4 terminal cancer patient instead of an event. I guess I‚Äôll take it.
---
Then your rank 20 teammate you're playing with against a rank 1 killer drops both of them when the killer looks at their direction from 20 meters away
---
That can be played around in some scenarios but it's kinda like the pigs dash in terms of counterplay. That being said i'm not gonna argue that the 2nd best killer in the game after pig shouldn't get a buff (not biased i swear)
---
You must be playing against different survivors to me then. I‚Äôll hook, kick the gen next to the hook and they‚Äôre already there unhooking. I‚Äôm not going to walk away and give up some easy hits
---
due to tge end game collapse update you can no longer grab survivors jumping into the hatch, but a loading screen still says you can, it can confuse new players
---
Keys mate
---
Newer player here, what did they change about deep wounds?
---
When they step on your trap that is guarding your ruin and you're on the other side of the map. **And they get off on the first try**
---
I love it when killers do that panic lunge even though they're obviously not going to interrupt the hatch escape.
---
Why can't we see trappers big thick cock bulging thru his overalls
---
New killer.
---
SwF and Key is fair against Ebony Mori.
---
I like that moment "FUUCK I CAN'T GO UP FUU.. ok nvm taking the window again!"
---
You do know that there's a spelling difference between Fortnite and Fortnight, right? Even if you tried making this a joke, fuckin' terrible one mate.
---
Yeah no swf is equivalent to nurse / spirit with fathers glasses and prayer beads
---
Not terrible but Pop Goes the Weasel is better
---
You forgot the fact that only 25% of Nea mains have any sort of skill at the same; the other 75% are 16 year old no0b3 subscribers who wear that one vest top with the Muertos design on it because they don‚Äôt have a Diatech.
---
Where are you from that‚Äôs got less of a homeless problem than the UK? I‚Äôll also add that panhandlers would congregate where there‚Äôs lots of people/tourists etc so you might be seeing the worst of it
---
Welp, that's a fair point. Didn't thought of that.
---
I think you're missing the point. Yes, these are obvious things, I said so myself I thought it was obvious. But the fact of the matter is, there are a LOT of people who didn't bother learning how to play against Freddy, a lot of people you would likely put under morons by your definition, and are trying to get him unjustly nerfed, and the purpose of my OP was to help prevent that through education.
---
I will give you that. I went against a 3 blink Ebony Mori Nurse with NOED. And to think we made it to the last gen being done! Didn‚Äôt escape though.
---
With all due respect that would be bullshit and unnecessary.  You would make it insanely easy for people to be mori'd directly off hook for the killer by hiding the fact that a mori is played.  There is a reason the devs made it so survivors have a pretty good idea one is being ran.  They fundamentally remove the difficulty of playing the role and naturally require survivors to play a bit differently hence the heads up to give them a chance.
---
Yeah I use that as well because I don't have ruin on him yet so the gens get done pretty fast but pop does help a bit
---
I feel like ot would be cool of there were more consequences to have a trap. Lile maybe if you unhook someone with a trap it drains the timer significantly. Then you could potentially have to make tactical decisions. The perk make your choice if the most on theme thing about her. I wish the reat of her arsenal was as focused on punishing altruism as myc. That feels very accurate to the saw movies. Idk
---
Sadly but you could have escaped with a key therefor key=ebony
---
Yeah then all the survivors scream at the killer for "tunneling"
---
Late comment but uh you're a fucking idiot
---
I dont know if he edited his post after this comment or not, since I'm on mobile, but it says 3 seconds
---
Thanks so much for the help. I'll keep an eye out for the add-on. :)
---
Even as a meme perk, maybe add 50% bloodpoints to the brutality or sacrifice category for x seconds(depending on level, idk what would be balanced).
---
We would have had a better chance. I only use keys I find in the match. Didn‚Äôt have a second for totems or even looking for hatch.
---
If you enjoy stealth killers then definitely get Michael! He‚Äôs very versatile and fun to use also when you prestige him, his weapon and mask look awesome! His perks are meh
---
didnt they say they were looking at the chainsaw boys?
---
Thanks, I sorta imagine it like the survivor pushing back, trying to keep their arms locked, but the trapper is just too strong and in they go
---
Nobody "outplays" anyone during a NOED down.  It's the perk that does the work not the player in that instance.  That's by design though.  It's designed to grant an effortless down.  If you need it to get your downs it is what it is but let's not blow ourselves for running it either.
---
Ain‚Äôt that the truth!
---
Great job! I 100% would have missed that ds skill check because of the pressure of the situation!
---
run through it before you drop it
---
I imagine this survivor be a P3 Claudette with Sprint Burst, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline and Object of Obsession with her SWF team.
---
I think we'll start getting lore dumps with the release of the archives
---
Nurse be like **now kiss**
---
I like seeing that hag placement, but every hag I have actually matchmade with other than myself places about seven traps at the hook instead of using the power right.
---
He be up in the gym, just working on his fitness
---
That or he has save the best for last
---
Are you 12?
---
I had a survivor running a needle tell me I was toxic for running BBQ the other day lol.
---
Careful. Using logic around here will get you downvoted in a hurry.
---
Is there a template for this? Or do I have to import my own images?
---
Is that why they stopped?  I kept meaning to ask during the Monday thread but it is usually is Tuesday when I have the thought again.
---
Oh shit yeah keys are soo bad nobody cares that they give you a free escape moris are bad killers should farm and flashlights are not toxic
---
The black lock doesn‚Äôt show until certain requirements are met. Ebony Mori just needs a survivor to be hooked once? Seems unbalanced. Also keys can only last a litttle bit unless you are swf, the others don‚Äôt know about it when it does appear. 
---
Then the killer can also close the hatch. 
---
Also it triggers end game once the hatch is opened, leaving the rest of the survivors with only gates, unless one of them is lucky enough to have another key...
---
Cough cough moris give you kills EARLY keys let you escape EARLY so I need to continue ?
---
thicc
---
You can't even interrupt hatch escapes anymore though. Doesn't stop me from trying though
---
Open handed, bond, kindred, and dead hard.
---
It's ironic how bad people thought Billy would be without his flick. While I still would love to have it back, it's impressive how much map presence he still has and how that keeps him near the top
---
Every once in a while you just gotta go full toxic build.
---
As is tradition
---
I'd love Pamela Voorhees - she can shoot multiple arrows that cause survivors to bleed out and fall to ground and can teleport to various closets and jump attack survivors and pretend to be another survivor. 
---
1. Attack button - attacks with bowie knife
---
2. Charge attack - shoots an arrow that depletes one health state
---
3. Two modes like Doctor: one is teleport and one is disguise
---
How to fox pig: remove the amount of RNG 
---
Literally make it a 50/50 and it would be fine
---
Pig is really fun to play against ignoring the constant 3 fails I normally get with the party hat
---
I liked him during skull rain when the shield hp was 150, I thought that was a fair balance but they made it way worse like the shield blocks one bullet for most guns.
---
Good then we are all going to keep complaining about it
---
Perks: Man with a Huge Bong, Truth or Dare ("I dare you to make out with that moose."), Good Work Zombie Arm.
---
Yes yes we do.
---
Wtf is she getting nerfed again or
---
Honestly huntress isn‚Äôt even one of the worst ones, she‚Äôs still decent without them 
---
But yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous that more killers than the devs would like to admit require add ons to play
---
It's not every once in a while it's half the games
---
I think that what happened was the entity made a deal with the spirit that it will bring her back to life to get revenge on her father but once she had her revenge the entity would want her to be their killer. And so she would probably be reluctant at first but would really badly want revenge on her father so she would accept it. At least that‚Äôs what I think
---
I'd rather wait
---
that‚Äôs really cool, i didn‚Äôt know those were there. good work!
---
I main Myers and have ran tombstone literally twice in my 300 hours I have on him.
---
I was just talking about the recent ambush nerf. But its dumb
---
fuck you
---
But you have free healthcare!
---
I'm working towards this build:
---
BBQ, Discordance, Thrilling Tremors, and Rancor.
---
I based it around his genporting. I'm halfway to grinding my way to the teachables. Shrine hasnt been kind to me lol
---
They didn‚Äôt need to nerf survivors either ....

Glad to have been of assistance
---
Agreed, I do pretty damn good and have fun with Amanda, whether I win or lose, she‚Äôs by far my favorite. A lot of people seem to feel she‚Äôs near the bottom of the pole, it‚Äôs just puzzling to see that.
---
I kind of feel like there would be too much room for error if you accidentally move your controller a certain way and your scream gives away your location haha. I hated the screaming on Friday the 13th because it pretty much negates stealth.
---
&lt;3
---
In your scenario the hatch isn‚Äôt visible to survivors to open. I think you‚Äôre missing the main point here. You‚Äôre being downvoted by not understanding the rules of the game that you‚Äôre arguing about. If there are 4 gens and only 3 survivors, guess what? No hatch.
---
That‚Äôs not immersed. That‚Äôs being a good teammate. As someone who primarily loops I don‚Äôt expect you to take aggro all the time. If you‚Äôre doing gens while I‚Äôm looping then I‚Äôm not mad when I go down. If you‚Äôre crouching around the map then I‚Äôm seriously pissed, and probably will kill myself
---
Buff the pig, please
---
*Stop fucking Nerfing, Amanda!*
---
I feel like it takes so long so I have to give up the pallets to focus more on the genporting part
---
So we have confirmed that the Entity is an eldritch God with the ability to control reality as it sees fit.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs number of remaining survivors plus 1 remaining gems after a quick search on google mate
---
So they gonna start hosting The Purge, UK edition?
---
Fair enough. 
---
I run Huntress or Doc most of the time and I feel like I'm in an episode of Jackass if I try anything other than my main build on her. That and the fast toss mod. I get looped like a chump when I forget that I ran out of them and then whiff on the toss.
---
No one needs an ongoing nerf. Just fucking get good. I get killed a ton as a survivor and dont cry about it. You have to outsmart the killer or the survivor. Just because your gaming skills are in the trash doesnt mean they need a nerf
---
I love the genporting and think i could make some plats with the build I'm working for. And I seem to work fine with just the snares but havent used pallets yet so not sure on that
---
I will say as a whole Claudette is accurate, but as a Claudette main I gotta say I have the most fun working on gens and hiding entirely too close when the killer stops by to break it. Doesn't always work out for me (especially when people are watching me play) but it is SO satisfying when the killer literally bumps into me as they go by.
---
I agree .
---
yeah but only in killer matches and its stressful when you don't remember how many gens are left lol
---
Me: "Aww, a survivor? I wanted hatchets."
---
Brain: "A survivor is worth many hatchet hits."
---
Me: "Explain."
---
Brain: "Survivors can be hooked for multiple bloodpoint scoring conditions."
---
I legit thought this was talking about peppa pig and I don‚Äôt know what to do
---
You're the actual definition of a potato Dwight. Went for a chest instead of trying to get him off hook, dafuq fam.
---
To be fair, when is his hex is purged, 0 perks. Cause the 2nd perk is near damn useless.
---
Thank you
---
Thanks
---
From a Plague main, Splatoon taught me everything I needed to know.
---
A di ris
---
ah de ris
---
When the Plague came out they said her name quite often in the DBD stream :)

---
I fully expect NOED on Spirit. I also expect on literally any killer who tunnels (because they tunnel all game and then use it as a crutch), but especially Spirit, Freddy, Hag, Nurse etc.
---
NOED Spirit gets fucked, good job
---
I honestly think Wraith or Trapper are the primary offenders. At least in my experience
---
Maybe ‚ÄúIridescent Hammer‚Äù which makes his m1 insta-down people. I think that would be cool.
---
*cries in MYC hag put me in basement pls help but also don't there's no point*
---
Here you go since you clearly are sure you are correct. I did the work for you so you can be wrong on your own post. 
---
It‚Äôs not the gens that are left to be done = remaining survivors +1. It‚Äôs the number of gens that are repaired = remaining survivors + 1.
---
Next time YOU should use google for yourself before being so absolutely sure about something that is completely wrong.

When I play killer and the useless fuck teammates farm the hooked guy in front of me I go after them not the hooked guy! Just got out of a game where a fucking Claudette kept farming me right in front of the killer and then that asshole just kept rehooking me! Like really, you both toxic and any killer who does that and doesn‚Äôt go after the prick doing it in your face makes you a gutter low life pos! I wish they would put a deny unhook button for assholes like that!
---
Thank the Entity that no conservative territories have any homeless issues whatsoever. I had no idea that societal woes can only effect you if you live near a large enough concentration of liberal-minded people. /s
---
There's poor everywhere, champ. Some people are so far down on their luck that they give up. Others have histories of abuse and trauma that broke them on a fundamental level. Some are just so far under water that they stop swimming and let the current drag them. These problems can't be "fixed" by pointing fingers or hand waving. Shit is complicated and goes well beyond this tribalist, 'us vs them' bullshit.
---
It's ok man clown is a tough guy to get down it's all about strategy and prediction with your bottles. He has some of the best perks in the game tho. Bamboozle tier 3 is amazing at stopping loops and with brutal strength they will quickly run out of shit to loop with.
---
I love to play Legion too, and it's true that they are not the worst, they are just ONE of the worst, not THE worst. Because against semi-competent survivors they are more annoying than anything. Like old Freddy. No real threat, just damn annyoing. But that's what I love about playing Legion, using both mend-time addons, sloppy, thanatophobia, ruin, just be as annoying as I can be.
---
I play PS4, every Legion, Spirit and Nurse have NOED it feels like
---
Imagine having a permanent instadown to your weapon. Also, add-ons must affect powers.
---
Just to clarify you keep referring the to survivors terror radius, they don't have one. The spirit has a 32 meter terror radius.
---
When a survivor is within this terror radius they will always hear a heartbeat sound effect and will not hear the whoosh on a phasing spirit. If they are outside of the terror radius they will not hear anything. If they are outside of the terror radius and then a phasing spirit gets close to them then they will hear a whoosh.
---
Another way to think about it is that when you leave behind the husk you also leave behind the terror radius. So if you phase and then a survivors walks near the husk they will then hear a heartbeat sound effect.
---
It is technically impossible to tell the difference between a husk left behind of a spirit that is just standing completely still. That's why some people will pretend to start phasing by standing still and watch where the survivors go. Sometimes the survivors walk right back into them and sometimes they crouch behind something and sometimes they keep running.
---
Well there not in the game now so whats your point.
---
You cant just show a video like that and not provide a rank at the end...
---
You forgot the funny
---
Yeah I knew my initial wording wasn‚Äôt what I was after, my bad. Need more good team mates and less urban evaders around the corner of the map.
---
When the totem is haunted grounds
---
The new killer teaser seems pretty good
---
No
---
Okay thank you all soooo much this is really solid advice. üñ§üñ§üñ§
---
The pipping system is absolute garbage right now. The devs rushed it. It harshly punishes instadowns for some reason. Instadowns should count as two hits and two chases ended instead of just one. If you used an Ebony Mori to get a 4k when the Survivors were on second hook without hard camping, then you should be guaranteed a safety pip at the least. If you used it when they were on death hook or got 4 sacrifices without hard camping, you should be guaranteed to pip at the least.
---
Flashlight OP, yeah, that's the reddit state of mind. Against any even only halfway-competent killer, all they can do is at best blind during pallet breaks and window vaults, hoping the killer can't track you, which they regularly can, especially if you are injured. And this does not even work against Spirit and Hag, and Billy as well as Leatherface can play around it at pallets.
---
BNP OP is something people even around these parts don't dare say anymore.
---
Syringe/Styptic are BS, but there are a lot more BS killer add-ons.
---
And then there's Moris, which have no equal, and are the single-most broken item in the game. Keys are nowhere near equivalent, given that not only would you need to finish all gens to get everyone out with a key (or 4 gens for 3 people), at which point you regularly could have just as well used the gates, but without survivors knowing each other, it is nigh impossible to get more than one person out with a key. You also have to find the hatch, which often loses other survivors the round, and obviously as does leaving without them. Moris on the other hand have no such "crippling" conditions, and the only condition they do have is one that is directly part of progressing one's round anyway. A key-equivalent condition would be that in order to be able to kill a survivor by hand using a Mori, they would have to first have hooked every single Survivor at least once. And then keys can actually be countered to extents, with Franklin's Demise, closing the hatch, tunnelling the person with the key. whereas Moris have no counter whatsoever - hell, you don't even get to know if the killer has one, or which one it is.
---
Imagine comparing teabagging and the N-word. Yikes.
---
That aura range, love it! Kindred is severely underused in my opinion and is a life saver in solo q
---
So you get shards from increasing you're player level and increase player level by getting XP after every game. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I thing the the XP after a game is 100% entirely tied to time spent in game. So playing well wont get you shards faster it purely based on time spent playing. And of course the devs want you to spend money buying characters and such so they aren't going to make those shards come fast. Think of it more as a treat you get after playing for a while. Kind of like "Hey you been playing our game for a while, treat yourself to a free cosmetic or character"
---
Michael is so fun to play as and against. It always gives me an anxiety attack when he tiers up and I hear a heartbeat behind me.
---
I love otz haha
---
Ok mate the thing is flashlight burns your eyes it‚Äôs not op but it burns your eyes mate and key=Mori pretty much
---
Lmao you gotta take pride in being a spirit. If you main spirit, that means you're just done with survivors' shit. And OP stated that spirits get more annoying as they're more skilled. He's right. I can easily get grabs while phase walking within 30 seconds of a game, no prayer beads, but you need the perfect distance from them as to not scare them. It must feel like shit being pulled from a gen from a non player beads spirit, but it's never really happened to me.
---
Any ranks suck ass for queue times, which is why I can't play the game as much as I would like.
---
It seems like it isnt effected by your sensitivity, either way, if thats true then it'll only make it equivalent to pc, which it should be anyway.
---
op you didnt have to be this brave but you did it for us. thank you
---
I was bored
---
That's what I figured tbh :)
---
Lol you're bad
---
nah chief.
---
Every killer except spirit is dogshit compared to nurse.
---
imagine calling me bad without providing any form of rebuttal because you know that your so wrong.
---
PGTW is better. If you want to keep track of when survivors have gone back to a gen, the Surveillance and Discordance combo is Freddy's best friend.
---
Okay I got another idea! What about if his chainsaw hit basically killed people. (works like an instant mori)
---
&gt;It's lAtEnCy
---
Its funny you joke about that because 9 out of 10 times, the cause is in fact, latency. People are just jumping in the bandwagon of complaints about "broken hitboxes" without even knowing the difference between latency hits and hitbox related hit. 
---
In this specific case demonstrated by OP, the issue is in fact hitbox because just like healing, your character's hitbox is standing up while your model is crouched.
---
I play PS4 too
---
Heya I‚Äôm a pig main that lets last survivor leave if they were fun. Oink oink!
---
thanks for this guide
---
And I keep getting smoking splinters in my blood webs, pisses me off the most when I‚Äôm putting a mill BP into my already maxed trapper trying to get iridescent stones and bag add-ons but am instead met with smoking splinters.
---
P3 Freddy btw....
---
Yes, I have to verify my game files because EAC becomes broken with every update. No, PC isnt the best platform. I'm not trying to start console world war 3. It's just a meme.
---
Freddy OP? Just avoid him when in dream state and your good to go. Dip out the dream as fast as you can and help teammates out always from it. Boom countered
---
&gt; He was eager to get there, but then...he just lost motivation.
---
Me after every grind I've ever endured. Always so hyped to finally get what I've spent so many hours trying to achieve. Only to be met with the feeling that I miss the grind more than I enjoy whatever I grinded for.
---
But this Killer actually sounds fun.
---
I'm gathering up perks for a fully gen focused freddy build,purpose built to shur down gen rushes.
---
Discordance,surveillance,pop,and ruin.
---
I'm curious to see how it turns out.
---
Imagine if you get frustrated and dc to end a chase, then reconnect a few mins later after the killer forgets about you. Nah.
---
Almost every game I play ends in 4k, but they still need to buff killers and nerf survivors more.
---
Head On, Quick and Quiet, Bond, and Borrowed Time
---
So this is promo?
---
A puley rope and hook system
---
ALWAYS try to use your power in chase
---
Oh yeah I was trying to do that, I just assumed that‚Äôs how it worked
---
For me personally : You do you, I do too.
---
If I feel an urge to bring a ebony mori, noed, blood-warden, ruin and bbq on nurse, then I'll do it. If you feel the urge to do the same, do it.
---
If you want to play 4 man SWF with full meta perks + object of obsession with 4 insta-heals, go for it. The most you'll get out of me is a shrug and a gg.
---
Items, Addons, Perks, Playstyles, Choice of Character are not toxic. The only thing that's toxic is being a whiny cunt after the game because your (not directed at you OP, just in general "your") sensitive heart couldn't handle that someone didn't play how you want them to.
---
How about you purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.....
---
Cough cough killer chases you your on death hook and your crawling DC on hatch and rejoin when the last guy is dying
---
It‚Äôs a de-sync glitch. It appears as if it‚Äôs blocked, but not really. It looks like it is for you but not him
---
Otz is probably my favorite twitch streamer. He always comes up with new and creative ways to play a game on top of just being a great guy in general.
---
No just a funny clip to make people laugh that's all.
---
I'm just saying most people including me as they haven't read the book or seen the movies/ remember them. It's similar to Tapp, no one would want to main them because they dont know him and probably wont get much cosmetics
---
Weird glitch
---
Nice save into Borrowed Time my dude.
---
Says something is dog shit - uses NOED. I smell dog shit on your clothes my fellow killer player.
---
I'm a p3 trapper that doesn't use noed it's such a glass cannon crutch that I believe it hinders your ability to become a good killer.
---
Lol you said it isnt hidden and used hidden to explain the offering dude
---
HONESTLY! I always see toxic ass survivors on youtube videos but i have yet to encounter one! Im seriously just chalking it up to canadians. Maybe it's mostly swf groups that talk shit? Because i think i mostly play with lone players most of the time.
---
I'd boycott the game and demand refund the minute they do this. Surv got nerfed again and again but this is BS.
---
Honestly, I only said it because I was hoping someone would respond with
---
(*Horses neighing in the distance*)[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zdIID_TGwhM]
---
ok
---
I dont consider her human due to in her back story she died i think
---
There's a difference between exploiting the game and ruining your fun which hurts your feelings. Guess which one breaks the terms of service and is against the rules?
---
Hint: Making sure you have fun isn't in the TOS. Get over yourself and either get some friends or learn to loop.
---
Leatherface. Just... Leatherface. No more needs to be said.
---
Snares &gt; Pallets
---
When I get grabbed off a gen by a scratched mirror Myers on lery's
---
Thank you for sending me this lol
---
Yo Angelo
---
i personally love shit on my profile, i keep them as trophies lol
---
I had a harder time going against Freddy before this rework so I‚Äôm happy with him now! Idk why I was shit against him before when he was shit but now that he‚Äôs good I find it easier but still hard
---
Yeah but its still morally fucked up
---
i‚Äôd kill for a witch or a smoker
---
Im talking people who are currently alive
---
They can also burn Hag traps (and Wraith, but it's pretty easy to play around).
---
On the other hand of things I didn't mention, even with their utility being as limited these days as it is, there are a whole bunch of perks to counter them, Doctor can innately counter them, they have next to not use against Nurse, and all killers can obviously at least try to play around pallets or windows in chases against flashlight-wielding survivors.
---
Na trapper has a face
---
Not really, i meant they are currently alive, most of them died in their story or are simply not human
---
He‚Äôs not even that good tho
---
Apparently dead hard is a big counter to the snares. At least one snare
---
She's not as hard to learn as people say she is. 
---
Relative to other characters in the game she is hard to learn, but compared to most video games it doesn't take too long to get good with his
---
You can crouch when doing actions to size down your hitbox. I know it's not OP's fault for not doing this, as I'm guessing not many people know about it, but OP could've crouched while repairing that gen and avoided the hit.
---
Really wish they would bring her endgame traps back.
---
Thanks mate it helped a ton.
---
No problem ???
---
Oh I'm sorry I was just repeating the same things told to Surviviors who get upset when they loop a killer for 3-4-5 gens, and get downed and facecamped bc the killer had Noed. 
---
Also if you look at pretty much my entire history on this sub, I'm a Nurse main you ad hom fiend
---
thats what all these shitpost are for, creating a very specific and useless tier list, except this one isnt, because it leads players that want to have fun instead of winning to a killer that they will buy. hmm isnt that interesring
---
Wait are you mad because you didnt find the hatch first?
---
Considering the main dev guy on stream (I don't know his name) has said that each helmet is allotted a jigsaw box on being put on, it's definitely not random in regards to 50/50 chance.
---
https://pics.me.me/haha-yes-37055409.png
---
Skilled billy mains are wholesome :)
---
Lmao
---
My personal fave is Hag with 3GenStrat. So good.
---
I don't think they should. I think they need to siphon power into her that makes her more consistent for mid game. Better crouch, traps are harder to get off but less RNG so you don't have the "I searched all the boxes except 1 and now I'm dead bc I'm out of time" and you don't have the "oh look first box", but keep the nerfs. They were only targeted at Pigs who used the traps the way the devs stated was not their intended purpose
---
HUZZAH?! A man of culture
---
The perks that counter them aren‚Äôt used and flashlights can be effectively used against a nurse. When in fatigue she can be blinded.
---
This man ascended as a Freddy player.
---
yeah pretty much
---
The way I kill the survivors is by penetrating them with the dick snares

---
One of the Dwight pants is super thicc, I noticed it the other day
---
I had a stupid idea back in the day of an Ultra Rare add-on for billy that silenced his chainsaw with Tremendously increased movement speed and turn radius but would probably have Considerably increased cooldown, miss penalty and/or charge speed decrease.
---
I don't need to provide a rebuttal. You literally are bad if you can't deal with a nurse at all. Sure nurse is a tough killer to deal with because you don't get to loop her forever like the rest of the killers. She makes you actually use your brain and change your playstyle. Learn to adapt and she will be more fun to play against.
---
He works it all off by bodyblocking injured survivors and looping for hours.
---
Right? Don't tell me that Dwight who probably sits on his ass all day has a better butt than a rugby player
---
Favorite Jake combo?
---
Haven‚Äôt tried Head on since the mid chapter patch but before then I‚Äôd never been able to use it successfully. What‚Äôs the hit box like on it now?
---
If you held me at gunpoint and told me to pick one thing to nerf, it'd be that I wish his traps could be crouched through like Hag's
---
Maybe David skips ass day.  As someone of Irish/Scottish decent, I can say having no ass runs in the family lmao
---
Audible crack as her head hit that fuckin tree
---
Poor clarity on my part. Clown has add-ons that make his power actually effective in being anti-loop. His base isn't enough.
---
Freddy is stuck at the default value and can do nothing to raise it. His only add-on that affects it actually makes it reduce speed even *less* in exchange for more BP.
---
Absolute madman is exactly what I was yelling. Incredibly entertaining play.
---
No I‚Äôm mad about how many toxic people are in red ranks
---
If you see 2-3 flashlights in your lobby, Lightborn is an easy equip. I'm just saying even more counters exist, to an already neutered item.
---
Bad Nurses can be blinded in fatigue. Any experienced/not-bad Nurse will know they can't look up or down in fatigue, and simply turn away, the survivor then having made a lot less distance attempting to blind her.
---
Freddys kit is fine but the pop bbq build is oppressive af.  It's like they didn't consider how he interacts with perks when designing him, go figure.
---
Seriously just increase the CD on his TP.
---
I know billy has his instasaw, but every other add-on is fun and balanced.  Turn billy is fun and survivors don‚Äôt really care.  Crack billy is just terrifying and only useful on skilled billys.  Silent saw is like jumpscare [insert killer here] which is super fun for survivors because of the jumpscare factor.  His chain add-ons do nothing pretty much.  His cool down isn‚Äôt really noticeable to survivors.
---
Me: I can't wait to see what killer I'm playing against! I love that feeling of tension of not knowing who it is for the first minute!
---
Game: lmao bruh don't get hit by Freddy cuz it kills you
---
Bing bong main here, can confirm
---
So im guessing the majority of the playerbase is bad then. A killer that literally breaks the game and has the only counter play of breaking LOS and hoping the nurse is bad. Its clear you have some sort of bias or rarely play survivor if you find nurse fun or balanced. You still havent provided a valid argument to your ridiculous statement.
---
Seems to me to mostly be an swf thing,yes.
---
I rarely have solo survivors being toxic.
---
Sometimes they will bitch if i ran noed that match or something,but even still it's pretty rare from solo's.
---
Balanced as all things should be. I will take my flu shot anytime
---
You're joking. They're so easy to play against
---
nah, all the good killers are zero fun to play and the fun killers are bottom or low tier
---
by that logic my mans david should have some impressive glutes üëÄ
---
Best one today. Love it!
---
Havent seen noed in red ranks tho and im on ps4 too.
---
"Toxic pointing"
---
This right here is where people dont take you seriously.
---
downing a survivor, trapping them, camping the hook in crouch, waiting for them to get saved, then continuing to chase that same survivor is why Pig's get a bad rap.
---
ty ü•∫
---
Aw man. Thanks for letting me know.
---
NP
---
Nea with pink hair is awsome.
---
I enjoy vanilla chase dynamics a lot, so I tend to gravitate toward the more barebone and therefore weaker killers, such as Wraith or Legion. They are still easy enough for me to do well with.
---
But playing something like Billy or Huntress is just a more gratifying experience in the long run, because it requires an extra layer of mechanical skill. I like more strategically demanding killers √† la Trapper and Hag, as well.
---
Either way, Doc is a pretty good choice of weaker killers. You can practice shock timings in chases and get really good with it, getting really good use out of it, as well. Plus he has some fun builds and strategies.
---
This is awesome fanart.

Schoolgirl Spirit &gt; All

Ghostface is actually selectable, which is a bug as the character clearly was removed in 3.1.0, replaced with the Nightmare.
---
*Haunted Ground*
---
Love the Feng outfit.
---
So you're asking people to use their skill and brain instead of relying on killer's weakness?!?!
---
Blasphemyyyy!1!1!1!!
---
/s
---
I'm curious, are you getting consistent wins with him against Red Rank Survivors?
---
You know when they tbag then spam point really fast?
---
I really like the little breaks in games you get like that
---
Back when I got the achievement the basic rule I went by was doing 2 full gens and getting two hook saves was enough to black pip and surviving on top of that was usually a pip. By those standards ranking up wasnt too difficult, being able to run the killer around for a minute or so at least was also a great help point wise. I havent looked into how pips work since Ive come back to playing the game but I still usually pip on decent games in which we dont get slaughtered in the first 3 minutes. 
---
Whats your play style? Being stealthy will generally reward less points as you dont interact with the killer even if you do get plenty of saves and gens done. Also can you prolong chases/get pallet stuns?
---
Well that was partially my fault 0_0
---
Honestly, as far as bloodpoints are concerned, I prefer that over a 4K that usually nets me less than 20,000.
---
Whether everyone gets out or not as long as you have an active game with enough action everyone gets rewarded.
---
Still doesn‚Äôt feel good though.
---
Ash is the best character
---
Legion.
---
Leatherface can down people with his ability.
---
Legion can run. That's it.
---
I'm amazed that exists.
---
Nurse: really nigga -_-
---
Ah yes, Red Ranks, where everyone is a SWF, everyone has Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Balance Landing (One will run Object of Obsession). 2 have Purple Flashlights, 2 have InstaHeal medkits. I'm not even being sarcastic, this is a majority of the games I play. You know what I do 9 out of 10 matches? Destroy them. They become predicable once you play enough. Every now and then you'll go against a rare player who jukes, loops and 360s the hell out of you. This person got to red ranks all on his own. He/She actually has skill. They won't be Tbagging or spam clicking their flashlight, they just play, escape and move on to the next game.
---
That was osom
---
Probably because Ash is supposed to be a certified badass demon killer who is constantly ready to do so. It's most likely playing to that area and nothing else. Why he can't have a dad body is beyond me considering that it's kinda the new age thing for dads or dad characters to be bad ass in media.
---
No its not, it isnt taking the game hostage, its the exact reason that amandas letter was made, so you could easily catch people at traps
---
Wrong hatch
---
Well.. i just thought that they may spent most time being a survivor so they might be good
---
Blocking a box isn't bannable?
---
Pretty narcisistic, nice tho.
---
That is true... encountered some that are not
---
No but still d seems a bit low to me. I get enough wins ok. I don't need 50 wins a row each day ok survivors have the ability to win too
---
"Rarted" has to be my favorite part out of all of this.
---
Nurse outperforming the pig? Nooooo.
---
Thank you!
---
Witch no doubt
---
Sorry for being the negative mentality. Just sticks with me being the killer :/
---
o7
---
"mostly non meta", I like that distinction.
---
Resilience, Spine Chill + Exhaustion perk + 1 is one of my favourites.
---
Exhaustion perk is usually Balanced Landing or Lithe, sometimes Sprint Burst, with Dead Hard not really being an option because Resilience and Spine Chill shorten its range. The last perk is usually one of either Self-Care, Iron Will or Botany Knowledge, but it can be much of anything, with Decisive Strike, Hope, Bond, or a second Exhaustion perk to pair with Balanced Landing being my more common picks there. If I'm not using Self-Care, I will always bring a Med-Kit with this, in order to be able to 99-heal, taking advantage of Resilience without risk.
---
&gt;Blocking a box isn't bannable?
---
Obviously not. Scummy? Perhaps. 
---
Before they changed killer's collision at the basement stairs, you could even body block people downstairs until their timer expired. 
---
The downside of this strategy is not applying pressure to the other survivors that aren't involved in this situation.
---
It's broken on all systems currently.
---
This has happened to me 8 times, I‚Äôm so used to it.
---
I think survivors forgot that if you rush inside a locker it creates a sound cue that basically gives away that your hiding. Also  I think they also forgot the killer can grab you even if your in the exiting locker animation. Really dumb how they forget this and call it hacks
---
Jake has a nice butt.
---
You're pretty cocky for someone playing against a dumbass killer.
---
Since its been deleted, i assume this was a whine post?
---
&gt; its the exact reason that amandas letter was made, so you could easily catch people at traps
---
OP is not talking about catching people. He is talking about sitting in front of one of the box, preventing a trapped survivor from searching it.
---
Your a rarted nigger

No it doesn‚Äôt

---
Them cheeks
---
&gt;Sometimes
---
Thats not bannable either, its abusive but it doesnt stall the game, you can do other things with a trap on your head, its basically the same thing as camping but not as worse
---
People are on here arguing "this isn't logical" like it's not about a fictional currency/energy in a fictional game that runs on illogicality. Suspend disbelief people.
---
Trapper on PC, but Huntress on console.
---
She's slow, with no enhanced mobility. 
---
Any kind of loop cripples her.
---
Reloading takes upwards of 10 seconds.
---
Her terror radius is huge, cannot be altered and doesn't give the benefits of a large terror radius.
---
She has no map pressure.
---
All this for a power which is incredibly hard to effectively use.
---
&gt;**A: Pig:** She can crouch. She can ambush. She can trap. Survivors suddenly need to make choices, will they take the trap now or later? If you do, will you try to stay inside the TR while doing so? Also keep a good eye, maybe the TR won't even happen before you're hit. Sadly, her add-ons are a huge mess, altho there's one that tries to change her gameplay from trapper to tracker, which is sadly the most rare of them all.
---
Sorry but I just do not understand how anyone finds Pig fun to play or play against. Her traps are meant to slow the game down and its just a glorified slot machine. Even worse than Ruin. A match can go completely south or in your favor based on your box RNG. Whether the 4th box was the one with the key or the first box was the one with the key. I know newer players do not mind mechanics like this because they feel they always have a chance to come back but it is such a lame way to balance a power.
---
The crouch is almost useless. You move terribly slow and if you attempt to use it at a loop a good survivor will just run to the next one. If you want to make an ambush attack your roar is so loud the survivor can get away in time. 
---
And then you take into account how her kit lets people play in the lamest way possible. So many times I‚Äôve seen Pigs down someone, trap them and hook them and then proxy camp the hook while crouched to lure people in and to prevent borrowed time. They then go for the unhooked guy *while they have a trap on their head*. They arent even using the power to slow the game down. Total anti fun especially if you‚Äôre the one getting chased because you cant go for the exit gates.
---
She is an M1 killer with an RNG clown fiesta of a power to slow the game down (or be a total joke). Someone explain how this is anywhere near ‚ÄúA Tier‚Äù.
---
Way to be, I always have teammates ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù to be altruistic when really all they do is sit in the exit gates waiting to be pushed out so they can say there was nothing they could‚Äôve done.
---
C‚Äômon, you‚Äôre giving Hag way too much credit here. She‚Äôs an A tier at most.
---
Dick riding Jake I see
---
Feeling satisfied after watching that. Thank you.
---
Deranking is easy and this game isn't competitive enough to have smurfs. Likely they are just playing with friends
---
Exactly with what happened to both hag and the wraith.
---
Not at all. Needing an add on to have a semblance of map pressure is not real map pressure. Real map pressure is the hillbilly (chainsaw sprint buult in ability, not add-on dependent).  Killers who can cover distances quickly have tons of pressure, or killers who have a psychological mind game like Hag or Trapper with their traps. Wraith is just invisible and SLIGHTY faster at base, that‚Äôs it. And most of the time you can see him coming unless you have his silent bell addon.
---
No, huntress has a full face. She has no hair, though.
---
Did someone hurt you in the childhood? Whats so wrong with dyeing your hair?
---
I know what you are talking about (i'm 13 now) but I have been enjoying it.  Sure it isn't fair but man it is exhilarating trying to get the drop on someone who clearly is more skilled.  That's just me.  I usually lose but it makes it real fun.
---
Fred's not OP at all and they shouldn't nerf him.
---
That said, the new Fred meta of hook ==&gt; BBQ ==&gt; Teleport ==&gt; Pop Goes the Weasel ==&gt; rinse and repeat sure is getting old fast.
---
Amusingly, doesn't the Doctor share Trapper's animations, particularly his walk cycle and his lobby idle animations?
---
I'm a Wraith main, I know all this.
---
But I'm practically never not using Windstorm, Green or Purple. So I count him as having decent map pressure, as it's not hard at all to always have one of the Windstorm add-ons.
---
My point is that Wraith can't be played as anything but an M1 killer during chases. He needs perks to buff chasing the most out of any killer in the game. I don't use it on him, but NOED is fine on Wraith.
---
Only about 10% of people have made it to rank 1 survivor
---
Claudette isn't the most toxic survivor and that's just basic knowledge
---
Or maybe... and this is a wild thought...... people just want to play with their friends and it's not their fault that bhvr sucks at making a good matchmaking system?
---
Leatherface 1000%. Literally has no power if the survivors can find a window or pallet.
---
That‚Äôs not a bannable offense
---
I'm rank 11 and my friend who just started is rank 17 and half the time I'm getting destroyed by rank 1's who smurf there way to rank 20ish
---
So broken*
---
Yeah, because getting harassed and being called "lil rev" 15√ó is definitely just that rank 3 having fun with friends.
---
Bless your soul for going back in!
---
That would make sense, but that would mean she also was able to use echolocation to see before being taken into the Entity‚Äôs loving grasp. And last time I checked, people can‚Äôt exactly do that even if they tried, soooo...
---
Solo is difficult while swf using coms makes  it easy.
---
Right.  And then the unhooker runs off with the BT-ed survivor body blocking and you have just lost.
---
Id kill for that map
---
Nah, a guy I screwed over with blood warden
---
I never said it isn‚Äôt justified on Wraith. But I understand with what you run he may have somewhat meh map pressure, but I am saying there are plenty of people who like to use other add ons that aren‚Äôt windstorm, therefore making his map pressure most of the time pretty ass.
---
Me: *sees this*
---
&gt; Holy shit these guys are toxic. Giving ghostface a spammable crouch effectively solidified him as the personification of Killer Toxicity. People who main him always have the most toxic perks, the most scariest addons and of course will have an Ebony Mori for that admittedly cool Mori. 
---
Me: (wtf.png)
---
Would buy all three and I don‚Äôt even really play them lmao
---
It really comes down to rank, at low ranks there's gonna be more toxic killers than survivors, face camping, tunneling, those kind of things.  Not many of either at low ranks, but still. High ranks is when you start seeing more and more of the survivors side of toxic. T bagging, flashlight clicking so on and so forth.
---
People actually teleport? I just use it go make survivors run to me
---
Because the doctor is the least fun killer
---
The thing next to your name says "zappy boi main" so I don't really think you have any power in this situation you neck beard fat beta
---
Teaming is a bannable offense
---
I haven't played vs him much but he is so so much better to play against now. Before people say he was bad but I always had trouble I never vs him enough to get a routine and not having any indication of where he is besides singing was complete balls. Esp jigsaws map no damn grass to at least see movement.
---
My three most played survivors are Tapp&gt;Quentin&gt;Kate.
---
*Giggles* I'm in-dangered :D
---
Most of my friends haven‚Äôt played DBD in a while and they‚Äôre between ranks 13-18 due to reset and inactivity. Because I‚Äôve been playing more consistently and have ranked back up somewhat, I‚Äôm not allowed to play with them?
---
What flick?
---
Maybe it's because you're using no mither?
---
I saw someone on this sub Reddit ask that the pigs trap go off when gens are done and that was today. The pig fine.
---
So no mither doesn‚Äôt let you get the trophy? If so it should really say that.
---
I saw someone doing the pig thing for a meme and it was super funny watching two people hopelessly stare at him
---
Yeah 
---
He makes the game challenging and fun
---
The animation at the end used to have an active hitbox IIRC
---
That'd be broken.  
---
  
---
And no Pig is not fine.  She was midtier at her best and she's had 4+ nerfs since then.  Her addons are all bad, except maybe 3.  The only reason Ive seen any pigs lately are her new cosmetics.  If anybody needs a buff it's her.
---
I‚Äôm just not seeing it but I respect your opinion friend.
---
Chill but makes you scream like you're about to be killed
---
I mean just watch the Monto videos? He labels them.
---
PS4
---
So how long are survivors going to have to deal with the bug where we can't heal/be healed and when the gates open, we can't actually escape? Because this is getting really frustrating now. I'll spend all game doing gens and avoiding the killer only to get killed by the end game timer because I can't actually leave due to a bug.
---
rin and adam lived in japan, anna is russian, legion in from alberta, etc
---
but no everyone has been confided in the east coast
---
That sucks. Why don't they show progress?
---
 No idea but I‚Äôm not a fan of it. I picked PlayStation over Xbox for exclusives but man I wish we had that feature.
---
It's a joke. He moves sooooo slow because he got super fat and out of shape from eating too much Burger King
---
At least you're respectful.  I feel like half this sub is a downvote brigade most of the time.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right that‚Äôs all this sub is about. I wish nothing but the best for you stranger
---
True but nurse is so absolutely broken with add ons, that they need a change this instant with nerfs to the base kit maybe idk there cause imo the basekit is fine but others find it problematic. 
---
And doctor need add ons to even be playable. Without 1 shock range increaser he is awfully weak and needs a buff to the base kit there as well
---
thats so cute, I would not fuck with her, she means business
---
Haha, you too, good luck with your matches and such.
---
Boss
---
Lol I hate people calling stuff op, he finally got a rework that makes him viable and there are still people hating on it. Mayve instead of calling every NEW thing that you don't know how to play against yet just git gud ?
---
Ace in the hole is one of the most value perks in the game, you always have the chance of 3 insta heals
---
I'm on PS4 unfortunately ‚òπÔ∏è
---
(it's really late and I'm sleep deprived so this might make no sense at all. Also this will probably end up being a shit comment, if that's a thing)
---
1) yeah but hatchets
---
2) no, only infinites will probably do that 
---
3) no, not at all
---
4) yeah but ok (I have no argument since I don't care about terror radius)
---
5) meh, certain maps will screw her but it depends on the player I think
---
6) no, didn't take long to be accurate on console
---
I've never heard of tyde tyme.
---
First match I ever played against a hag was during my first few hours after purchasing DBD, so I knew nothing about her. I was in a SWF, and the only experienced player there noted that it was a hag from my loading screen tip, but elected not to warn me lmao.
---
This hag put her traps in the most random spots. I shit my pants, and so it was the first chapter I bought.
---
I can imagine that others have had their first games against a camping hag and thought differently.
---
Sadly if you aren't on PC reports will do absolutely nothing.
---
I meant that shit like this happens all the time, why get mad over it?
---
Well played.
---
LMAO
---
Because it's annoying tbh. I agree with you and I ignore all idiots like the ones he mentioned, but I definitely can see where he's coming from.
---
Don't answer him with logic, just reply to him "gg super ez" he doesn't deserve more than 1 sec of your time haha
---
Does anyone know the meme format?
---
Where do you people find these nice "pig mains"? Every single one I run into employs the I trap I tunnel strategy and is usually crouch camping around the corner from the hook.
---
I hated Mettle of Man as killer but they pretty much gutted the perk.
---
I just think they should make it like We're gonna live forever. Protection hits and safe hooks
---
U/BigMuffle
---
Relatable haha. Feels good when I punish those ranks 2,3,4 or mori them and then they start crying lul (killer 7)
---
Do you remember which anniversary weapons correlated with which messages? Nice work by the way! :)
---
Everytime I hear nerf now I cringe for the poor pig. Man.... Feels bad
---
Yeah this is one little thing that's blown my mind: Since I've started playing DbD, I've always wondered what it's like playing with Rank 1 killers, but I've more than likely been facing them on many occasions, this whole time.
---
The best players say stealth and hiding is useless but that's because they play HYPER aggressive to get at and stay at high ranks.  Although some killers you HAVE to stealth vs given how mobile they are, Billy and Nurse namely.
---
Maybe if you're rather new, I can imagine being overwhelmed by his power. There are only a few doctors that actually use him correctly or have fun builds
---
Of course he was, I thought that was pretty explicit, much like how Trapper is clearly based on Jason.
---
ruin
---
that was a fucking rollercoaster
---
amazing work!!
---
Add in Insidious for possibly the most S P I C I E S T build ever. They won‚Äôt even know you are there until it‚Äôs too late....
---
I‚Äôve seen boil over work like once out of dozens. It *can* be useful
---
Her Ambush ability no longer functions as a basic attach, so it doesn't proc things like Exposed anymore. So now there is basically no reason to use it ever.
---
As a wraith main, i hit and bounce. Its usually more beneficial to go chase another survivor and wear you all down over time. When I tunnel a survivor i often slug em and leave em crawling.
---
First they give us licensed characters now its licensed cosmetics
---
Kill them then, lol. Sometimes I play friendly Myers, but if the survivors are too stupid to realize that a killer moonwalking at them and 360 swinging while nodding isn‚Äôt friendly, I just kill them. Same thing goes for if I know they‚Äôre going to complain about dying no matter what.
---
Hello! I'm a PS4 Huntress Main.
---
How can I help? :)
---
So some backstory, this guy was a random that was an AMAZING teammate (which is very rare). He helped do gens, hook saves, and cleansed totems. I could have easily just left him there and escaped but I wanted to repay him for the help he gave me and my 2 friends.
---
Beautiful! I would play her a bing bong song when she went down cos she totally deserved one :)
---
It was a good kind of cheesy, cmon now.
---
Thing about tunnelling and camping is against competent survivors you'll get 1 kill if you are lucky and hardly any BP. The idea is you've to apply map pressure to survivors and staying at a hook let's them do gens because all you are doing is wasting your time in one place. Same goes for tunnelling, whilst you focus on 1 survivor you are letting the other 3 do gens. Not saying that if you stumble across the injured survivor you should walk away and leave them but if you specifically hunt them down then you're  wasting time. 
---
If someone farms them in front of you then hit the injured to drop them to the floor and then leave them there and chase the healthy survivor. That was you have 1 on the floor not doing gens, 1 being chased and you force 1 to come and pick that person up meaning that's at least 3 people not doing gens. 
---
Camping and tunnelling are legit strategies at certain times but if you are tunnelling and camping with 5 gens still up then yeah it's pretty shitty and boring and you'll never get any better at the game playing that way. You're honestly better getting good with loops and mind games and trying to get better at winning chases. That's what makes the game fun and the best way to earn BP.
---
This is what I hope to see at my bedroom door, as I‚Äôm laying in bed with a cigarette loosely hanging from my lips, calling for daddy.
---
I‚Äôm just amazed you‚Äôve managed to even have a win streak against Freddy. Considering I‚Äôve personally seen him be played for a grand total of once.
---
All he needs is one simple fix.  Reduce, or get rid of, his chainsaw slow down.
---
You mean to play against or play as?
---
Meh, another decisive crutch escape, been there se-OH HOLY SHIT IS HE RUNNING BACK IN TO SAVE THE LAURY?!
---
Man that was great, at the edge of my seat after you ran back in.
---
I forgot all about her! Aww, Erin I‚Äôm so sorry!!! She was AMAZING...
---
What perks would she have? This community has kinda slept on Cassidy from Sorority Row but I made a concept for her and people actually liked it!
---
Become a true asshole like me. Kill them all, no matter the cost. Show no mercy. You're playing as a mentally-deranged murderer. Act like it.
---
To add on to the other response you got, remember that you can still wake yourself up by failing a skill check. If you make your way near the clock, heck yes use it, but there's plenty of better ways to wake yourself up in a pinch.
---
If your on console, switch your messages to private to avoid the harassment.
---
What do you mean his slow down?
---
I think he needs the charge time to be reduced.
---
Was he running mad grit?
---
Yeah that would help especially on maps like mother's dwelling with all the trees
---
Myers? He's the most over played killer in the game, personally I think wraith deserves that spot , but that's just me. Or piggy. Both enjoy her, shes not too op, but you can play airy the traps and use them to keep people moving,or just focus on sneaking. I find using the traps very rewarding. If you keep the pressure on, you can usually get two popped, and the others were screwing around trying not to kill their friends.
---
Will be released around December. Right now it‚Äôs still in the making
---
Her survivalist upbringing calls out for some scrappy bullshit.  Somehow being able to turn the killer‚Äôs power back on them, maybe?  Even just a small buff.
---
I had completely forgotten abour rank reset and stepped in about rank 13. I don't know if it's just my luck, but I ran into him pretty frequently.
---
If you have Spine Chill and the killer looks at you when you are being healed, you see the bar turn yellow even when the healer doesn‚Äôt have it.
---
It‚Äôs either a visual bug OR all action speed also works on being healed
---
Thx for letting me know! I have it on pc already but I was just curious

You‚Äôre next needs to be the next licensed killer, change my mind.
---
Who says I'm gay
---
If you think camping and tunneling is viable for you, then do it.  You‚Äôre going to get messages and if you think it‚Äôs too much turn your messages off for non friends. 
---
But I will say.... content with 2k almost every game is cool.  But imagine getting a 4K almost every time. You will if you didn‚Äôt camp or tunnel. 
---
I‚Äôm not going to assume you‚Äôre a rank 20-15 by any means (if you mentioned it, I didn‚Äôt see)  but eventually rank 1s will not keep falling for your bait and more times than not they‚Äôll do well and all escape.  (If you didn‚Äôt know what tunneling was, I wanna say you haven‚Äôt been playing long) 
---
BUT REMEMBER. You doing that denies survivors a lot of points. Between 1-7k if lucky and that fucking sucks. You. A 19k-26k on average. All 4 stacks and 28k and up is a beautiful sight.  Survivors aren‚Äôt entitled to an escape and you‚Äôre not entitled to a sacrifice. Play to have fun. Because eventually, sacrifices won‚Äôt matter and bloodpoints will
---
Nice. Amanda's face was adorable
---
Ehh...personally I disagree. I find Billy to be the most fun killer to play against when he isnt using braindead instasaw add ons. For the most part,Billy can be looped to hell just like any other killer,but it depends on the skill of the survivor as well as the Billy to determine how fun the match will be against him. Chases can be pretty fun,when he starts revving the chainsaw I know I have to find something on the map to loop him around,find a pallet or try and dodge the chainsaw. If the lands the chainsaw on me and I did all these things then that's his reward for either hitting a good chainsaw with curving or whatever.
---
Bing bong song then go make a sandwich while she waits on the floor for the spikes
---
I got robbed of my adept freddy once (old adepts, just needed a 4k). I had two kills, one downed (i knew they saw the hatch) and one person I was chasing the last one. 
---
I downed them and went toward the hatch. The person I downed disconnected to give their friend the hatch
---
What did they do to her?

Camping is annoying for the person on the hook because their game is already over in a couple of minutes because of in my opinion a bad player. Tunneling is also annoying because you just got off the hook you want to get back into the game and guess what your already back on the hook one step closer to death. A good killer can get all 4 kills without camping or tunneling.
---
Was that English? I don't understand what 13 year old kids who go to public school and have no basic comprehensions of standard grammar mechanics are trying to say.
---
100ms latency is 0.4m difference. So no, hitboxes*.
---
I‚Äôd quit the game if we did.
---
I love Shawnee so much üò≠
---
You're the type of kids that gets what's coming to him in the next "thoughts and prayer" and no one even remembers you were at the school.
---
This was rank 11 the killer was rank 9
---
I don‚Äôt run Spine Chill though and don‚Äôt recall seeing it on my teammates in end game screen but I could be wrong.
---
I think thats why so many claim that hes OP now, the contrast between old and new Freddy seems to be so extreme. So he seems OP if we say that the old Freddy was the medium for all killers. However thats not the case. Old Freddy was the worst of all the killers and I would put new Freddy slightly above the huntress.
---
Last year I started playing this game because it was free on Plus. Reached Rank 1 in 2 months and as solo survivor. I didn't find it that hard to pip as Survivor, you just need to unhook someone, heal, loop killer some time, do some gens and you can already make a pip by that without escaping very often. Just try to think as a killer and prevent his moves. Never waste time hiding unless he is near, don't waste time finding ruin but try to hit the skill checks, it's not impossible. Keep in mind of killer perks such as BBQ, Nurse, Discordance, Noed... Sometimes you just can't save someone unless you have BT and you have DS, planify gens and don't make them all near eachother otherwise killer can patrol easily at the end.
---
At gates risk don't risk to open a gate instantly, but just open it like 30% before the red light appears, then hide. Wait the killer to check and when you are SURE he is gone go open. You have this way a 70% increased chance.
---
IMHO, to make both playing as and against Spirit more fun, it would make sense to remove the vacuum cleaner sounds but also remove the collision detection while she is in spirit realm. It just makes ‚Äúmindgames‚Äù waiting unless you stumble upon a survivor.
---
I never understood the tier system, I've always killed survivors with much ease as any killer other than the nurse. 
---
Even prior to the reworked version I 4k'd with Freddy in over 95% of my matches. It was easy to do as well.
---
Wish I knew how people are tiering these killers though and what criteria goes into such grading.
---
No u
---
RIP Michael, all he wanted was to make a friend...
---
Not that hard actually. Yeah, difficult at first, but you need to put much less time into Nurse to outplay Survivors who played way more than you.
---
What's this?
---
I mix it up with both so it keeps them guessing
---
Map control + instadowns is having double power. IMHO, hillbilly chainsaw should not put in dying state. That‚Äôs what Bubba‚Äôs power is for.
---
Where did you find this?
---
You have my respect
---
Ruin is there to slow the game down at the start, not when 3 gens are already done
---
Yeah and I would say you can even see that a part of the community has already adapted to his changes.
---
He usually ends with 2 kills now instead of the 4, survivors start to wake themselfes up because they realize they won't be affected by 50% of his power if they are awake, Killer queue times aren't 30 mins anymore.
---
yet you are the part of the problem?
---
Do you know how easy it is to dodge the chainsaw if Billy is trying to snipe you with it from across the map? The saw is so damn loud,and no one uses the silencer add ons.
---
I think that explains why the killer was camping him and then randomly stabbing at him. I don‚Äôt think he appreciated his previous actions!
---
What is even the point of 3 genning? You aren‚Äôt going to commit to a chase so you aren‚Äôt hooking anyone. Just makes the game long and boring for every party.
---
Most people who say that never heal anyway
---
Freddy's OP, that said it's part of the games challenge I'm tired if people whining like kids whether survivor or killer. 
---
Now where's my flashlight...
---
1) you'll probably be seeing a lot of Freddy since he got reworked, but it's usually a mix of everything
---
2) Whatever you prefer
---
3) None, people will probably say NOED (it's not as bad as people make it out to be)
---
4) Nope (I think)

5) Dedicated Servers coming late September. There's a new machanic called mending where you have to "heal" before the timer runs out, when you get hit by Legions (New killer) power you'll be put into the deep wound state and have to mend, and when you use Borrowed Time and get hit, you'll have to mend. DS was reworked, now after you get unhooked, downed, and picked up in 60 secs, you can use DS to escape (one use per match).

11) big gripes?

But thats the point of the ability.  Its an addon. If it was his power 100% of the time then maybe you might have an argument but its not every match.

Didn't know you could close the hatch while being cloaked. This made it even more satisfying.

Tbh I was exactly the same at some point. Don't worry.

&gt;as fast as you can

Depends: You know Freddy is chasing a teammate and you just happen to see a few of his traps / pallets? Make sure to "disarm" them while he isn't near. (For the pallets tho, please only do that with pallets you are 100% sure are dreampallets *looking at you Claudette from my last game, who just threw down every pallet even before the survivors were asleep for the first time (actually had snares with me but welp)
---
You can play how ever you want to, camping and tunnelling aren't against the games rules. You won't get banned for doing either, and at beginning and middle ranks they're often pretty effective.
---
You're getting messages because they are unfun to play against. Hear me out, I'm not saying don't do it nor am I saying you should be playing by survivors rules or anything of the such .. I'm just talking about how a match against a camping and tunnelling killer feels for the survivors in the match. 
---
If you don't ever play as survivor, you should. It's easier to understand when playing than it is to just read about it, plus playing on the other side can make you a better killer from seeing things with a different perspective.
---
When a survivor loads into a match and is the first one found, they'll get chased and 99% of the time get downed and hooked within a minute or 2 of the chase starting. Now the way most survivors expect the match to continue to play out, the way it will against high skilled killers that are trying to play most effectively and efficiently, is the killer will move off to find a new survivor to chase, down, and hook. The general idea here is that while the first survivor(1) are hooked, and the killer chases another survivor (2), yet another survivor (3) will need to come unhook the original survivor. That's 3 survivors busy and only 1 survivor working on gens. Killer downs and hooks the second survivor and the cycle restarts. Survivors cycle through who does what, or specialize in doing a certain aspect, but everyone bounces around, gaining points, getting saves, working on gens, healing, getting chased, as the killer brings all of them closer and closer to death. This is typically a fun, satisfying, healthy match where regardless of if the killer gets a 4K or a 1K, everyone leaves the match having earned some decent points and put up a solid fight.
---
When a survivor loads into a a match, and is the first one found, and eventually downed.. and then the killer camps the hook and if other survivors ever manage to unhook the killer then tunnels that first survivor down, it is incredibly frustrating and boring. It puts survivors in a bad mood because camping and tunnelling often feel like punishments intended to prevent the survivor from having any fun in that match, keeps that survivor stuck earning very few points , liking depiping. It's boring and frustrating because when a killer is camping most of the time the hooked survivor is absolutely 100% aware that the killer is utterly fucking them and essentially preventing them from getting any fun or enjoyment from the rest of the match. 
---
For survivors, the best way to play against a camping killer is to ignore the hooked survivor and just chunk out gens. That is to say, the best way to play against a camping killer is to basically just not interact at all. Doing gens while a killer is camping is boring, there's no excitement. It's not a fun tense match, it's a disappointing slog. So as a result of camping, the killer is turning that match into the most unfun version and least interactive version of DBD. 
---
Yes, killer is not obligated to play DBD in any way to appease or appeal to survivors at all. But at the end of the day, we all play DBD to have fun, and when a match becomes decidedly unfun after a minute or 2 and a single chase, it causes frustration and in the long run will contribute to people stopping playing the game because they aren't enjoying it. 
---
Camping and tunnelling are bad for the health of the game and the community.
---
I mean that he literally combines two powers. Whoever has instadowns has no map control, whoever has map control has to chase and hit at least two times. Hillbilly might first get to you in seconds and then (even if you dodged the first chainsaw) one shot you anyway.
---
But many do. Even at higher ranks, people are going to heal. The Plague guarantees they don't. The Plague's ability just saves her time. Many times she can end a chase before it even begins. I'm not saying that she's an amazing killer, but she's mid tier at worst. Around the same strength as Ghostface and slightly weaker than Myers.
---
Yeah pig is still kinda useable we need to change that.
---
Well then I dont know how I am going back in ranks. I read the same somewhere else mentioning u cant derank but here I am.

0:27 That's the first time I've seen the killer 360 themselves. :P

Ohhh it‚Äôs tall man yeah he could make a interesting killer

Might just be fan art for freddy, the bubble looks like affect around freddy's clock.
---
Today I had a game as plague where the last three gens were close enough together. Apperantly the two remaining survivors were germophobic, they avoided AFK crows by doing whatever in the other part of the map while I stacked points in deviousness for vomiting on some gens. I got called out for protecting the gens, apparently they wanted me to let them do the gen without interfering. Yeah, sorry, buckaroo.
---
Stop tempting me Satan!
---
Love that
---
I am sure devs will address dreampallets itself somehow, now that they are getting a lot more data. 
---
As it stands right now they are considerably unfair which leads to frustrating gameplay.
---
#oof!
---
Yes you're playing killer completely unoptimally if you think camping and tunneling by default is the best way to play.  Good survivors will destroy your playstyle.  Your comment about spending as long as needed to focus a single survivor is particularly troubling.  This will lose you so many games my dude.  Every good killer knows when to break off a chase.  Tunnel vision will just create gen rushes from the other 3 survivors you're doing nothing to stop.  As you get more experienced playing killer you'll find leaving the hooked survivor to patrol and pressure gens and initiate a new chase with a different survivor to down is the most optimal way to play.  Keep them constantly having to stop gens to perform altruism while you rack up hooks, and eventually kill them off throughout the game.  Honestly I completely get why the survivors are salty about your playstyle but that isn't why I'm telling you it's bad.  One killer to another your playstyle earns shit bloodpoints and will depip even with kills at higher ranks.  You're hurting yourself playing this way.
---
Holy crap, can you imagine the skill ceiling to play nurse with touch controls? Unless there‚Äôs some serious aim assist then you‚Äôd need to be a top player to make use of her
---
I respect clowns ( I kinda main him tho )
---
He's one of the more difficult killers to learn and play well.
---
Not bad. The ball could be like the hatchet toss. The movie is phantasm correct?
---
yes just change your region to denmark using a denmark address on ios not sure on android
---
I try not to camp and tunnel
---
Take note of your surroundings while you‚Äôre awake and if you notice pallets spawn that weren‚Äôt there before and Freddy is pre-occupied throw them down (like you would set off Hag traps while she‚Äôs picking someone up)
---
Don‚Äôt spend the whole game asleep, go between awake and asleep to optimise your awareness.
---
We had it the other way round and it was never this bad. I think there‚Äôs more to it. For queues to be like this, the survivor count would have to be really really small
---
*insert Wilhelm scream*
---
You already said you do it and see nothing wrong with that. For the record I think you play like an unfun ass but you are allowed to play how you want.
---
Thank you.
---
These are cool but I'd ditch the swords
---
Because the one who called it that is very creative and quirky.
---
I hate the trap stuff, I did like 3-4 different boxes and guess what? None of them contained the key and I died. 
---
Thats the type of RNG that I hate in any video game, they could maybe give us a clue which box to use or atleast make it a specific one at the other end of the map like with freddy's escape dream thing.
---
&gt;purposefully

So people aren't allowed to have lower ranked friends??

It looks like Jake to me the jacket is a dead give away
---
Im aware. Im just saying it really helps. In case you do end up having to leave the area as you cant indefinitly loop one area in my ranks.
---
I've already seem this like 3 months ago, is it still being a repost?
---
I have a ritual to mori as nurse. I‚Äôm trying to complete if for 4 weeks already. Luckily I had many moris saved up.
---
You wait 20 minutes for a lobby to get all 4 survs DC when they see a secret offering and hear nurse‚Äôs blink
---
Thanks for a good answer. Gives me a better idea about the tiring system. I honestly never cared in the past to learn about it but this thread raised my interest.
---
He's not wrong, anecdotal evidence isn't helpful in assessing raw stats. Freddy's new kit is decent but good survivors will start to show you the errors in your kit. 
---
I played against a bill who pre scouted badham preschool and made a mental note of the pallets, piece of shit ran me forever in there and because he had the foresight to check which pallets were in there he never fell for a single fake pallet.
---
Why Trapper‚Äôs pp so invisibleüò°
---
Well, killer tirerlists are almost exclusively based on how killers perform against experienced survivors, so playing at lower ranks doesn't reflect anything about those tierlists.
---
Mad grit doesn't speed you up anymore.
---
MoM had to be taken care of tho. It was making lower tier killers even worse, while most high tier killers could either avoid it (hatchets, instadowns) or didn‚Äôt care about its effect (nurse)
---
The whole game was laggy as hell, but she was the only one to get stuck like that...
---
Where'd you get the pic from? It's cute
---
Definitely a perk where she can booby trap a few windows for killers once every game ( like the spike block scene in the film)
---
All I see is the pallet being dropped on the killers head. Weird enough there was a blue waluigi or something behind the killer
---
Not really, I doubt wraith could turn invisible before he was pulled in, that‚Äôs not how the entity works. We can discuss lore all day but it‚Äôs not gonna change the fact that the lore is spotty and inconsistent at best anyway.
---
Personally I think snare is stronger than dream pallets simply because they make like 99% of the loops unsafe, and even if they remember where the snares are, it won't help. He seems A tier imo, I really put him above hag but that's more personal opinion
---
Come on guys, use your awareness and team communication.
---
Not every ability needs a specific hard counter or a nerf.
---
Freddy‚Äôs pallets aren‚Äôt that big of a deal if you‚Äôre paying attention to the game.
---
If Freddy‚Äôs on the other side of the map I don‚Äôt see the harm. Did it in a game earlier with Gates Open, helped save a Tapp from cucking himself to avoid Freddy on the way out.
---
I used to main Pig. It is far more effective to find someone to put your trap on than tunnel the trapped survivor because the trapped survivor isnt going to be doing anything while the rest are guaranteed to do objectives
---
Provided leatherface gets the chance to down anyone. Most people will not allow it unless they get unlucky and run to a place that is already missing a pallet for example.
---
Even before freddys rework I believe leatherface was the worst, still think he is.
---
So you're essentially asking for the game to cover for you if you make a mistake. If you forget which pallets aren't real and try to use one during a loop, you made a mistake and deserve to get hit. Yes, the pallets are "chancey", as they should be.
---
I did that in the ptb and it was pretty fun to hit and down survivors while carrying another
---
Except Freddy can easily teleport via a gen over to you. That can turn into a massive problem you just gave yourself.
---
Huntress needs a homer skin now
---
I mean the addons for that arnt as common. Doctor is annoying in general himself and his addons are far less frequent then freddies and also require you to get shocked for them.
---
True it is all situational, but it‚Äôs yielded results for me so far. High risk high reward I guess
---
Can I ask you a question about the Wraith addons? What the hell are the ones that uncloak you when you damage generators etc. good for, if for anything at all?
---
Yes he was. Who was worse?
---
Old Freddy (without addons) had the following things going on:
---
 \- Invisible for all nonasleep survivors + Unable to hurt nonsleeping survivors. Also directional lullaby.
---
 \- Takes a few seconds to put a survivor to sleep.
---
 \- Can see survivors who are asleep and far away
---
 \- 115% movement speed
---
 \- Survivors are slightly slowed down while they are asleep
---
He was a noobstomper but he was the worst against any survivor who had atleast a bit of expirience.
---
\- The directional lullaby and him still moving grass while walking over it gave his position away.
---
 \- If a survivor is put to sleep there are two options:
---
\- Option 1. Freddy chases them: Freddy doesn't get any help in loops at all. He is just a 115% M1 killer now.
---
\- Option 2. Freddy doesn't chase them and Freddy goes after another survivor: The first survivor will be awake in about 10 seconds.
---
 \- Slowdown: Freddy will stall the game for about a minute or maybe two. But in the end he will still loose more time by getting looped. 
---
So against expirienced survivors his only power basically is that he has to wait for a few seconds before he can hit survivors. So he becomes even weaker in the endgame. A door is open and he just hooked a survivor? Well seems like they can be rescued without any problem, have a lot of time to run to the escape and can't get hit for the next few seconds and even if he downs them shortly before the exit, you can easily heal a survivor from the dying state with two people before Freddy puts both of them to sleep. Also: When they are healed from dying to injured they wake up. Oh and don't forget: Survivors who are awake can still block a hit for injured survivors who are asleep thanks to the autoaim of the game, without taking the damage for that hit.
---
Next update: Killers can no longer attack survivors ‚ÄúWe received a lot of complaints from the community that all Killers were overpowered, so we slightly reduced their ability to pose a threat‚Äù
---
I mean no first off pallets are already risky because most killers just swing through. Are you expecting survivors to also have perfect memory and run a marathon around the map first?
---
I'm pretty sure the lowest rarity for both relevant add-ons for Doctor and Freddy respectively are both brown.
---
Freddy's pallets also require you to be asleep before you can see them, so I'm not sure what you're trying to get at here.
---
But I thought BHVR won't do killer who can shape shift.
---
But it'd be cool if it's indeed from Phantasm.
---
If the people who have p3'd got cosmetics to compensate depending on if the change was so drastic that it severely reduced the grind to p3 level 50 (similar to how legacy was, obviously not as amazing) id be okay with it. I just make bank as killer so I don't personally really mind the grind
---
Exactly! But you will never know unless if you stalk them :eyes:
---
Best waifu
---
It doesn't really line up well with the chainsaw animation, but imo that doesn't look like an absurd distance from the window to be hit. I think with most M1 animations it'd look moderately reasonable.
---
Where is this art from?
---
Im pretty sure it's something like when being chased by the trapper make sure to watch out for traps
---
If you‚Äôre worried about survivors rescuing your hooked person, get the Leatherface perk BBQ &amp; Chilli. Good for BP and let‚Äôs you know if it‚Äôs worth heading across the map to knock down more survs.
---
Nah. Most of the time they're running dead hard to compensate for the one hit they lose by not cleansing. It's the question of "can they use dead hard well" which puts her powers viability in question. In theory it sounds great. But in practice it just doesn't work.
---
Even if they do cleanse (they usually dont) they make sure to cleanse far away from the map so that you have to take the time you "saved" to actually collect your corrupt stuff, which means not going in chases for example. The fact that her fountains heal you is insane, really hurts her viability. I really wouldn't put her next to ghost face, not midtier. A lot of rank 1's know how to play injured, they can honestly run no mither and itd make no difference in anyone who isnt nurse or spirit. Unless they get unlucky and run to a place where someone already used a pallet at for example
---
Not running around the map to see all pallets doesnt qualify as a mistake my dude. A mistake is improperly running a pallet. Dropping it to late instead of taking a hit. Youre essentially saying people should run windows of opp to get a good scout of the pallets. Im just saying small game negates it amd helps tale out ruin like every high rank killer runs.if you think that having a bit iota of skill is knowing where all the pallets are. Also small game simply help you to prevent making that mistake so you can better loop without as much fear of knowing weather the pallet is fake or has been dropped and replaced. Im very skilled at looping pallets and windows and mind gaming. The dream pallets are simply a loopers worst enemy.
---
Depends on each person's tier list.  Every person will have a different criteria for how they're grading each killer.  For example, one person might only be thinking of the best of the best situation...  Nurse with 4 blinks + distance increase or 5 blinks, or Iri head huntress.  The way I would make a killer tier list would be based on not the best add-ons because who is going to run iri head huntress every single game?  
---
But really it's based on who is basically the best at dealing with the survivor's strategies to live.  Most survivors are taking perks like Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time.  Absolutely none of those being stealth perks so Spirit does insanely well.  Nurse does very well because she doesn't have to deal with looping, the survivor's best defense against most killers.  Billy has a hard time against strong loopers but he has insane mobility and map control so that's why those 3 are likely to be at the top of everyone's tier list.  I personally think Nurse&gt;Billy&gt;Spirit.
---
I think the most glaring issue with Freddy is how much value he has for such little effort. You mentioned how his abilities are similar to other killers but those abilities are literally the other killers‚Äô entire kits. Nurse and Spirit are difficult to play and Freddy isn‚Äôt. He has more abilities than any other killer and is going to be #1 played from this point on.
---
&gt; It requires a little memory and pallet spawn memorization against Freddy.
---
This is a big load of crap because the issue with these pallets happens when you dramatically change areas because of a chase. If you are a half-decent looper, the chase should cover a good portion of the map. 
---
Here is a very clear and simple example, Suffocation Pit or Azarov's Resting place. When the game starts is not uncommon for the killer to spawn on one side and survivor's on the other. If the chase happens to go towards the other half, you are doomed. You can't memorize anything because at that point you either fell asleep normally or got hit. This causes the second hit to be pretty much free or even both hits. 
---
You can't also memorize real pallets when you go cross map asleep to perform a save. 
---
&gt;Pallets are meant to be a tool survivors can use to attempt to make a situation safer for themselves. 
---
There is a difference between making pallets not safe and removing them completely. 
---
&gt;If people are really having this big of an issue with it, they can run Small Game.
---
Have you ever ran this perk? At this point it looks like you are trolling. Most loops on DBD have 2 pallets slots so even if the perk warns you, you still can't tell which one of the two is real and even both can be fake. Its radius is fairly big so you can get alerted about a fake pallet nearby while sitting at a real one.
---
Ahh perhaps im mistaken i thought it was only iri and green addons for doc. You passivly fall asleep anyway. And simply getting hit puts you in the state. The doctor has to actually hit you with shock which can be dodged or be around you long enough to get you in shock state.
---
if you combine that with silent bell, you got a real spoopy killer
---
I loop killers all over the map. It kind of is a big deal. You cant have entire map awareness. My dude.
---
Honestly MoM used to give me a fair share of 4k's. The aura reading was amazing. Worked well as pre rework freddy, being able to see the aura of someone even when they went asleep was nice
---
Buff other killers, nerf nurse, fix maps instead of needing survivors.
---
I definitely love playing him but he is so frustrating to play against.
---
The reveal mechanic is still super inconsistent and the addons which make it even harder are bullshit.
---
On some maps he is super strong thanks to a lot of obstacles and on Coldwin Farm he blows.
---
That is correct. The killer would be the Tall Man.
---
Anyone got a recording of this in action?
---
Rank means foul smelling. Coincidence?
---
Unfortunately you can't guarantee flashlight saves since you have to blind them AFTER the picking up animation ends which means Killers always have a chance to look away before you blind them.
---
If you get the timing down PERFECTLY then you can still save but you have to know the animation pretty well.
---
Judging by the downvotes I‚Äôm gonna guess there‚Äôs a lot of survivor mains here
---
I'm pretty sure matchmaking is broken right now because I keep getting rank 10-15 killers while playing solo survivor at rank 5

Dream pallets are more about survivor map awareness. You can't see them when you are awake, and if you know the tiles and map layout well enough, you'll be able to remember where there are and aren't pallets. Also it gives you a reason to spend time waking up with alarm clocks.
---
Dream pallets are more to test the survivor than the killer's skill.
---
When you used DS, I was like "Okay, so you get out.. Congratulations...", but then... when you came back for the save and that extremely lucky hatch spawn, you deserve it.  Well played, sir/madam!
---
Yes! Honestly a lot of characters have short cosmetics. I hope the devs see this and do something near it at least
---
you‚Äôre not allowed to say anything negative about this man or him and his entire fanbase will deem you a hater and harass you.

What film is Erin from?

*Playing as the Trapper* loading screen tips: "Tha Trapper can step in his own traps and make survivor fall" "The Trapper's traps can be sabotaged with the perk sabotage or a toolbox" ah ok i thought this were tips for me
---
Many killers had no way to counter it tho and that‚Äôs the problem. It had too big of an impact
---
You can get better during regular game time, what has that got to do with the last 1 or 2 minutes of the end game?  
---
At that point, you can at least get one or two kills.
---
You‚Äôre Next
---
We tried banning A and B tier perks on both sides when we played KYF. We had a few problems trying to put anything worth a damn into our builds
---
Entity must live for these days because he usually watches teabagging and flashlight clicking all day
---
Are you in the UK and have virgin media as your provider?
---
There‚Äôs a strict timing when the killer is picking someone up. Other than that, they‚Äôll simply look up.
---
Yes, it is. I ran into the same glitch yesterday on Xbox, and it lasted for three or four trials.
---
You‚Äôre kinda being a bitch here, but people who DC to give a friend hatch are the worst types of people, glad that won‚Äôt be able to happen anymore when dedicated servers come out since they‚Äôre adding the husk mechanic
---
I had a pretty fun 3 gen game as Plague on one of the farm maps, can't remember exactly how it ended but it was definitely tough for both sides.  The worst part is if they're smart they'll go cleanse on the other side of the map where the 3 gens aren't at.
---
Winning is the point
---
An easy fix to the grind is to make it so that after Level 50, whether you‚Äôre Prestiged or not, there are 4 perks per Bloodweb and you‚Äôre able to purchase 2.
---
If it's a killer that does well through the game and has noed  for the last killer or whatever then fine. But so many don't try to get good because they know they have the crutch there. That's my point. More often than not the killer gets outplayed all game but speed boost and instadown gifts them an easy kill or more if the team are alturistic and it hasn't been found.
---
It must be the way her traps mixes the meta. A lot otherwise "ok" survivors get off-balanced hard when the match isn't as straightforward as rushing gens, t-bagging and escaping. It's pretty funny, really.
---
You guys just can't handle a strong independent woman who pegs when she wants to.
---
Since the blind for a save had to complete once the killer regains control, theoretically they can look away, but if the blind finishes within the first few frames of the killer being able to look away, then they don't really have time to and you can get the save that way. The timing is very strict though, and the killer could always face a wall or something to cover their face during the pickup.
---
Intern: Let‚Äôs release cosmetics for a killer, after nerfing them to shit, and then, get this, nerf them again! 
---
McCote: get this man a legacy skin!
---
They said in the next patch or it could be a hot fix. The first patch after the mid chapter update is 2 weeks.
---
Worst case scenario 2 weeks, but it could be sooner if they hot fix.
---
Erin is honestly one of the most badass protagonists from any slasher movie I've seen, she'd be a pretty good addition.
---
I was playing Bill today and I traded for someone after gate was open and I was on death hook, he made it out alive
---
A tier kist is just comparing killers. No matter how good every killer is, there will always be a best and a worst (which doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they are not viable, it just means they are the worst compared to the others).
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone is holding back his gameplay because you think, Oh, I have noed for the end game, so it‚Äôll be fine.  
---
Either you get your kills or you don‚Äôt.  
---
Noed has nothing to do with it.  
---
M1 killers get outplayed all game and that‚Äôs frustrating, so they at least get one or two kills with noed during the end game.  
---
Nothing wrong about it. 
---
Better killers don‚Äôt need it, because the valuable perk slot can be used for something that kills before the end game.
---
Exactly. I play Hag mostly and even I can only do so much. I tend to make people salty and complain to me (even though I don‚Äôt run Ruin or NoED) and running Franklin‚Äôs is practically integral to my survival playing a B rank killer.
---
Probably well over 3/4ths of my games against a hag involve her getting one person in a chase, hooking them, setting up a million traps near the survivor and then leaving and teleporting back as soon as one triggers.  Tunneling the survivor until they're dead.  I'm sorry but that isn't fun.  You might not do it, but most hag players do do it which is why she isn't fun to play against.  
---
It's also not fun crouch walking over to unhook your teammate.
---
or maybe dont tunnel and camp? literally destroys the effect of the perk if you dont set up a tent near the hook
---
&gt;They are not meant to be completely safe at base.
---
That just isn't correct. Pallets have always been meant as a safe zone for survivors. It's more that looping pushes the limits of safety in pallets. They can ALWAYS be dropped to give you a barrier between you and the killer that is one of the safest positions to be in as a survivor, but trying to maximise the time used at a pallet minimises the distance between you and the killer, making it riskier. Freddy's power now punishes that risk/reward behaviour by increasing the risk in the same way that Spirit Fury does.
---
Like Spirit Fury/Enduring, the safest play is to drop the pallet early if you suspect it's fake, which again forces you to play risk vs reward. Is it worth dropping real pallets early in case you would take a hit due to a dream pallet?
---
True, just the grind is a lot for new players, just got a friend to start playing and he's already a bit overwhelmed. Possibly add more incentive towards ranking up to move focus away from the grind. 
---
Although as mentioned by someone, adding more perks to each web would probably be a better fix
---
Borrowed Time is not even a second chance. If the killer is camping you don't have first chance any way
---
Doc just checked in
---
I suppose it has happened to us all before.
---
They can't comprehend that if you see a survivor suddenly dissapear you sometimes want to check lockers.
---
I suggest getting ruin or pop or the plague perk (corrupt intervention I think)
---
Even with slowdown perks gens still pop way faster than they have any right to, slowdown perks are an absolute must, especially at high rank
---
I don‚Äôt know who that is on the right because that‚Äôs not Claudette
---
I 3 genned as wraith for ages once. Why would I just let the survivors win the game? It's their own fault that they put themselves in an unwinnable position
---
The most essential thing is time. Good survivors have been doing what they‚Äôre doing for months or years. 
---
The the Freddy has been out for not even a month now, so there‚Äôs a huge difference in experience and it‚Äôs still too early to accurately tell if he‚Äôs good or bad.
---
No, how dare you for having completely reasonably not watched some 70s horror movie.
---
For the snares if freddy is chasing someone else step on any you find to get rid of them
---
I actually hadnt thought people might not get that.  But yea it was pretty funny how many pallets i was picking up the several games i ran it
---
The only thing I have to say about Freddy is I enjoy the fact that everyone automatically goes into dream world..  But there is no reason as far as I can see to wake up as he can hit you while your awake..  That's the only problem I have with him..  I like the idea of traps and fake pallets etc
---
The thread made me rethink a lot of decisions and if I were to redo it now I'd put GF one tier up, Spirit one down, Billy one up and make one intermediary tier to put Plague, Huntress and Wraith there.
---
Huntress couldn't get any higher tho because her power is completely one-sided and the add-ons neither change her power in any surprising way nor do anything more than power creeping, allowing her to deny exhaustion, give her more hatchets, make them instadown or some combination of those. She is very fun to play as, but for the Survivors it's hard to be surprised by her in some way.
---
I think Spirit is actually a good fit where she is currently simply because the scariest moment I ever had was getting pulled off a Gen by a Spirit out of nowhere. She always keeps me on my toes and there is this sense of "Is she going to show up out of thin air and eat my ass?" and that makes the game super fun for me as a survivor. Biggest  downside is her add-ons though, if she could have more add-ons to change up her powers a bit she would be way more fun. I would say the main thing (for me) that makes her more fun than the Huntress is that she is actually scary to go against whereas the Huntress is either completely frustrating or just laughably bad.
---
Then they get brutal killer or entity displeased...btw waiting is fun!! 1!1!1!!1
---
No, seiously, stop disconnecting.
---
Only if you buy its chapter, i guess. Im getting splinters on the only killer, i bought ingame, not as a DLC.
---
A friend got it yesterday so all good.
---
To be fair though, that's because it's Sorority Row.
---
The Pig is pretty fun for Meme-ing
---
Smooth. Deception nat 20
---
I'd like to confess.  I have never watched any 70s horror. 
---
I have not watched freddy Kruegers films. Or michael myers. 
---
In fact.... I don't watch horror. Am I a bad person? 
---
Help me.
---
Couldn't give her the Rancor kill.
---
He's okay. Gets hit real hard by stuff like body blocking and second chance perks. Basically doomed if he gets hit with the swf adrenaline gen rush strat. 
---
He's not very good but he's got a lot of flavor and matches with him are very unique so he's cool. And he's not a completely useless turd like the legion are.
---
Gotta agree here, it's the same as Hag and Trapper. Yes, they CAN choose to ditch a chase and come at you instead, but they're in a chase and have no guarantee going for you is a better option, so why would they risk it?
---
Unlike Hag, you aren't even risking a direct teleport, he HAS to go to gens so as long as you aren't right next to one you're pretty much as safe as you would be otherwise.
---
He would be if him popping in and out of cover didn't completely deny you any chance of revealing him. 
---
It's a one-sided minigame, he gets to keep his stalk on you, your reveal meter resets every time he hides.
---

Eh. Not really.
---
Im only in my 20s and have to say, if there's no factor of nostalgia for you, then the originals are pretty bad movies. We've been very spoiled by cgi, special effects and just general improvements in movie making. Seriously the original Halloween, the most tension is a kill scene is a quiet squelch and them going "ow" pretty much.
---
Honestly a pretty entertaining movie. Wish the shark ate more people tho
---
That‚Äôs all I needed to know.
---
I got the trophy while I was playing killer. Most likely because someone else got it (or didn't get it) in that match.
---
Fun is subjective, but I'm trying to take a more objective approach by judging the levels of versatility and interactivity that can be attained.
---
Myers: How exactly do you get hit with a tombstone piece in the first minute of the game? There wasn't enough time for even T2 to build up. I understand the problem with his base kit being shallow, though it's probably because it's simple that it's also easy for the devs to make it so versatile with infinite T1, infinite T3, tracking, obssession-stalking, etc. and his kit makes it easy for Survivors to understand and interact with his power.
---
Hunt/Billy: After discussing in this thread, I agree with you. Huntress and Billy should have been dealt with more care.
---
Pig: Her RNG goes both ways and, altho I agree that it should be more fine-tuned, the mechanic of having traps that you can choose to deal with now or later, besides the effects that could be caused by them, is a good way to have a killer-survivor interaction. That and her stealth + ambush in the kit allows for more than one approach to hunting Survivors, which gave her a higher tier. She definitely needs an urgent rework due to her add-ons being a mess, tho, which makes it hard for me to justify her position.
---
Plague: Yeah, after discussing and reading some comments, I was convinced that, altho her power is very useful in a lot of ways and keeps forcing Survivors to make decisions mid-game and mid-chase, she doesn't have more than one approach to chase Survivors and her power isn't as interactive like GF's which gives the match a more frenetic pacing.
---
Only two thing clown has over the snares is the area of effect, which is just a lot bigger with clown, and the fact that they can be thrown quite far ahead to shorten the time required to catch up.
---
Yeah that's really all I can think of
---
Hey thanks! I searched forever to find who it was.
---
While what you say is true, it being miserable is something else entirely. I, and I've seen many others in this sub, play solo survivor just to calm down and have a good time.
---
But when playing killer there's a lot of stress,  I often run into swf groups whose sole purpose is to bully the killer(Also with the broken MM I often get survivors that are simply way better than me), and I hardly ever really have a good time. Because really, you always depend on 4 people. As survivor, you depend on 3 randoms and the killer, and as killer you depend in the 4 survivors.
---
Console nurse main here, my life is suffering
---
This sub I swear
---
Credit goes to Mau Lencinas for these amazing designs.
---
Doesn't stop bad Pigs from doing it, they see it as an easy guaranteed kill no matter how bad they are.
---
He'd be garbage if his chainsaw didn't instadown.
---
His chainsaw is already pretty easy to deny if you know how to loop, you can force him to be an m1 killer. 
---
&gt;That‚Äôs what Bubba‚Äôs power is for.
---
Leatherface is one of the worst killers in the game, his chainsaw is painfully unreliable and weak. You can't chainsaw anyone who's not in an open space with nothing around to use.
---
Yeah goodluck with that. Trapper blows. But he's fun
---
Soo.. 
---
As survivor you depend on 3 survivors and a killer.
---
As killer you depend on 4 survivors. 
---
Both sides you depend on 4 people.. 
---
On top of that,  it being miserable is something else entirely. I, and I've seen many others in this sub, play solo survivor just to calm down and have a good time.
---
That is what the perks are for to give you a better advantage of survival by countering things killers can do. Like Iron will is particularly good against Spirits, Calm Spirit counters a Doctor, Urban Evasion is great against Hag traps, Object of obsession works well against Pig and Ghostface. In the same vein small game counters Freddy and the Trapper, also good against Hag. Not every mindgame is as simple as moonwalking as a killer or ducking behind cover from a stalking killer, some of them can be based around your perks.
---
I have gone against a team that were not SWF a few times who are red rank and they do well. I do well against Freddy. It is just about memorising the pallets and understanding the loops. If you can't do that then you use a perk to help you, like when you can't do Ruin so you throw on Stake Out to get easy Hex checks or how most people when they begin use Urban Evasion till they understand how to run a killer.
---
i apologize for my brethren, they can be assholes
---
I really really enjoyed reading this. Best way to explain how survivors feel in the most respectful way. Thank you.
---
Same. I play solo and still get anywhere from rank 1 to rank 20. Doesn't seem to matter what my purple rank is.
---
Legion is really really weak
---
I think he's 100% ruined by inconsistency. Half the time you get revealed when behind completely solid objects, sometimes they stare right at you and it doesn't register.
---
It's not fun to lose because of a mechanic not working properly, it's not fun to win because of it either.
---
I also find his stalking takes way too long for very minimal impact, and he's better off using his stealth to attack more than using his actual power to expose.
---
Mostly I just don't enjoy playing him because of how you feel like you're constantly playing against built in limiters more than the actual survivors.
---
Yeah, his stealth is really bugged, needs something
---
How does that work with doctor pallets? They're rather similar but I've never considered people disliking them because they have less mindgame potential
---
Soooooo ads in my game. No thanks
---
I do feel the map pressure part. If I fuck up my first hit or they see me too early and a chase starts I just have to hope I'm better at the mad strat mindgames to end it real fast before the others do too much. But if I'm successful with that first hit and maybe get a second regualr hit on another survivor I can snowball it pretty good. I usually play with devour because with the shroud active if they didnt catch it even one down on a healthy survivor is worth it. But yeah totally agree spine chill is my absolute weakness but with the open field part at least for me I can usually find an angle that I can work with at least a little bit and attempt a play hoping theyre not paying attention.
---

---
And as counter to what you're saying:  you always depend on 4 people. As survivor, you depend on 3 randoms being good and the killer being bad, and as killer you depend in the 4 survivors. 
---
Besides that, as a solo survivor you can very easily still escape or do well even when 3 people are shit, but when 3 survivors are good you will always lose as a killer. 
---
I play both sides equally, but solo survivor is basically my "chill out" tine..
---
Sorry this triggers you.
---
If you can't play around Billy's chainsaw then that's more on you for having no situational awareness and being bad at looping.
---
Billy is really easy to force into being an m1 killer if you know how to use pallets and windows. He's much more interactive than Nurse. You can loop a great billy, you can't do much against a decent nurse.
---
Counter and counter to hag is at a cost everytime if you crouch time wasted hag happy. Flashlight deleted a trap charge used and requires to know where they are. Triggering her trap while carryibg someone gj she knows where you are now.
---
There's a reason most (if not all) of those perks aren't meta.
---
Not even the most skilled player in the game can be able to determine what pallets are always real. 
---
To sum up this debate, I have stated my issue with the pallets, you have offered a bunch of conditional perks would help me in 1 scenario, but be worthless in the majority of others. You then claim a skillful player can somehow memorize something that is totally random.
---
He doesn't really have any way to drop chases quickly. Taking the time to stalk only to get saved or having to land an extra hit is hard for him.  Everyone else has at least something to make that extra hit a bit easier but for ghost face it's just a pain in the ass.
---
And the body blocking can suck because if he's previously taken the time to 99 that person that's now just wasted time. He's not exactly punished for injuring people but doing so is kind of a waste for him Majority of the time
---
Exactly, they‚Äôre not hard to go up against. So when you do get skilled players they‚Äôre going to ruin the fun for you just as you‚Äôre doing to others.  It‚Äôs not fun for survivors.  A lot of killer mains know that, that‚Äôs why they choose to play as ‚Äúfair‚Äù as they can. 
---
Someone wrote a long, insightful comment. It will never compare to mine but I suggest reading it over and over again until it makes sense. 
---
Everyone just wants to have fun and denying someone is not cool.
---
This man gets it
---
8-20*
---
Why are you hating on noed when all survivors run adreno
---
&gt; Adam Francis: Playing this guy is guaranteed suicide no matter &gt;what. He is a tunnel magnet and will always be targeted by the &gt;killer &gt; no matter what.
---
I main three survivors. Kate, then Feng, then Adam. And god damn, this is the one that got me. I never get tunneled even half as hard as I do on my best boi right there. It's crazy. Those killers are racist as shit :(
---
Yeah, as I said, I'd place Wraith higher if I were to redo this tier list right now. His add-ons are half of the time very one sided, changing the game more for the Wraith than they change for the Survivors, but you do have a point about his bell-changing add-ons, they do change his approach. His place is mostly influenced by personal experience with how people play Wraith versus the Killer's concept itself, but it's not healthy to trust personal experience too much.
---
Ghost Face got that place because his power interacts with Survivors a lot and can get them off-guard, but I guess you're right, he can't be too distant from the Huntress. I'd still be hesitant put them in the same tier because GF also has crouching and leaning and Huntress is extremely straightforward and only throws hatchets.
---
I'm considering redoing this tier list and posting it again, revised.
---
At least from the PTB he stealth breaking for me has been pretty decent. I agree it's inconsistent but not enough to ruin it for myself. With the stalking if you do a cover lean stalk 0% to 100% takes like 4 seconds and to me thats a short enough time. He's not right for everyone and I get why you don't like him.
---
0 map control but has free hits built into his kit and the ability to instadown. Also has some niche mindgames with his crouch and stealth.
---
Honestly I think he's got more potential than Freddy but that's just me. Still loopable to high hell on certain maps. More fun to play GF than Fredward for me.
---
Although technically doctor pallets are similar, they give themselves away the moment you are near them. I have to actually throw the pallet down to find out it's fake with Freddy, and in that scenario I would waste time looping around the pallet. Doctor pallets are also sometimes already down, which gives them away.
---
Only works the first few times, I think once you play a few games (like 5-10 games) they start to disappear
---
one of the smartest final girls in a horror movie
---
I know I'm in the minority here, but as long as it's not multiple blinks, I love versing Nurse. It's a hype chase and it feels good to juke her completely. People who think Nurse is an instadown just because she's good have no clue what they're talking about, she's the most fun 1v1 you can have. (Again, assuming she isn't calibrating her five blink approach as if she's fixing the Normandy)
---
Yes, with dedicated servers.
---
It looks like the entity is giving you a SUV for surviving.
---
So what if the entity and the trials and all that are just a contest tv show?
---
Yes, that's mostly why I gave Spirit that place actually. She has some scare factor that it's hard to have in DBD.
---
I didn't mean tombstone in the first minute literally. But say he feeds off of your teammate with stalkspeed add-on, manages to sneak up on you with t2+m&amp;a and then just takes you off of game with pretty much no way for you to counterplay. Not a fun game. That and against exoerienced survivors most of his anti-stealth builds are a bit of a joke due to how easy he is to loop
---
I definitely understand that he is the most fun killer but i'd argue that not by a whole tier
---
Depends. If my team isn't punishing it by working on three gens, I'm out. Had too many people throw away games to still waste minutes watching them all feed the killer a 4k. 
---
And, unfortunately, camping is a good startegy precisely because of that. Bhvr needs to implement mechanics to actively punish camping outside of attacking hook divers, or else that shit will never stop.
---
I would say he has low map presence not necessarily low map pressure and yeah I have to rely pretty heavily on hoping my mindgames are better than the survivors if I get into a chase.
---
lmao that last line
---
but yeah, I agree 100% that nurse can be a lot of fun - she just needs a good rework with the right mindset to not alienate the nurse mains we already have but at the same time put some needed brakes on her
---
You can loop a good billy.
---
You expect 4 perks to counter every killer in the game? Do you not think that is the point when the devs make a lesser used perk counter a killer? To kinda mix up the meta and force people not to just play the same 'optimal' builds over and over, killers get enough grief for using the same perks. If you aren't good enough to beat the killer with no help then they have provided a perk to counter them more. 
---
You may not be able to believe it but yes I have played against quite a few red rank players recently, who came into the lobby at vastly different times so aren't SWF, who have been able to memorise what pallets have been used and then either don't use them or deliberatly destroy the dream pallets. I don't see how that is so unbelievable the reason the best survivors are the best is because they remember what pallets have been used throughout the game so they never get caught out by the killer. I use Bond because that helps me more as I watch teammates in chase and see the animation of a pallet being dropped in a jungle gym and I know not to use that jungle gym unless desperate. Will I always get this 100% right no but no hard counter to a killer is a 100% perfect and the ones that work best come from the addition of perks.
---
That's a good point that you've convinced me to agree with. Sincere upvote.
---
But why
---
Yeah but hes got that whole invisible thing going on, so im not sure if you would count him or not
---
They are alive they just disappeared because the entity took them into his realm
---
Death from above
---
In the body blocking situation I would just voluntarily drop the survivor to finish the stalk and down the other one. In my mind that would be a minimum of 3 usless survivors one chase, one down, and one healing the downed. So at least for a moment nothing is happening and theres a good chance Ill down my new guy and I'm back to where I was before likely without a body block this time. Also yeah I try to avoid long chases as best I can and I usually do that by using the stealth to get my first free hit and then I only have to chase for 1 hit so thats 1 loop maybe 2.
---
Maybe a misunderstanding, I mentioned Wraith because you want to put him in the same tier as Plague.  
---
But I‚Äôd argue his add ons make him better than the Plague.  
---
And if you say add ons have the most weight in your list, then Ghost Face and Plague should be the same tier.  
---
Both with fun powers, but boring add ons.  
---
So maybe:
---
A Wraith
---
B Plague and Ghost Face
---
C Huntress
---
If the add ons are most important to give variability and mix up gameplay.  
---
Because I think they are all fun to play against.
---
I thought your opinion was fair until that last line. Boi have you ever played against a nurse?
---
Tbh I find DS less of a second chance perk then then BT. F.e. a teammate can just instantly farm you with BT, while the killer just hooked you. But if you are hooked, get camped, get unhooked and immediatly get tunneled, then I see DS as more fair then BT.
---
Overall I thing both of these perks are pretty fair, but also really strong
---
Only morally fucked up thing is when I brought her a box of chocolate and flowers she still put me on that meat hook
---
He's mid tier right in the lower B to higher C area. Isn't bad but isn't my first choice for killer but he is getting picked over others.
---
Yea thank god *rolls eyes*
---
I except my 4 perks to be usable every game, or at the very least 3 of them. The perks you listed basically counter 1 type of killer. What if I don't play against that type of killer? 
---
Of course they can memorize what pallets have been used, IF THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE!!! Otherwise, it's just a guess. Memorization skill is very different from a guess.
---
Lisa has a lot of different approaches available for her and her power is very manageable for the Survivors to counter and even dismantle, plus she has a very good jumpscare factor in her favor. She is one of the prime examples of how add-ons should've been handled for every Killer. Also her power is like playing chess with Survivors, just like Trapper's power should've been but with more agility, mobility and scares.
---
Who would you pick over him and why?
---
hillbilly huntress and leatherface are SS for me
---
Ashy Slashy has been killed by the clown. Yeah, by his mori.
---
Patrolling gens slows down the progress of the game even if you don't have ruin. 
---
And the same argument can be used against camping. Smart survivors will do the gens while you camp and escape.
---
don‚Äôt pull her hair she‚Äôs gonna kill you
---
There‚Äôs also some bleeding into other killers , like the clown or doctor
---
Disturbed Ward has the best totem spawns
---
The devs tried to fix his reveal mechanic by giving the Survivors more window to reveal him, when it's actually clearly a bugged feature that otherwise was doing very well.
---
Dead by... You already know
---
And you'll miss
---
Wow, it‚Äôs like I haven‚Äôt said it was
---
Fast as fuck, boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
You need to pay this mind of toxicity in kind. You should have rang the bell in celebration of victory whilst nodding your head when stood facing the camera. The last thing they see as the entity consumes them üòÇ
---
I for the life of me don't understand why they haven't made luck affect the chance of getting a better item from a chest.
---
Just put Jason in lmao
---
I've been using it a lot with the new head on and I am starting to think that it might actually be worth using by itself. It's made killers go back thinking I didn't vault windows when I did and it can also give you locker plays as seen here.
---
You can play kill your friends
---
My point was that most survivors are so stupid that they need the obvious spelled out for them.
---
What are his abilities though like trapper is basically Jason lol I don‚Äôt see how he could fit especially since his machete was taken already
---
I agree that they should, pending the legal variables, just make their own Jason. Why not? We have 'billy and Leatherface.
---
He did it seems
---
can you do this with pwyf?
---
If it wasn't for Object of Obsession hard countering his power I'd say he's a slightly better Myers. But, since Object of Obsession is a thing I'd say he's worse than Myers and probably at the low-mid tier range.
---
let me get my 30 dollars
---
Sshh, let's pretend the original whihelm scream is from Borderlands... :p
---
What really sucks is when they see you, you duck behind something but the spotting effect (whatever you want to call it) continues for an extra second because fuck Ghostface I guess?
---
You are really lucky the GF didn't want to punish your teammate for you farming him
---
2 killers can have  a machete but they can just give him a different ability
---
no
---
If you play survivor enough you can understand that this isn't always a ping problem. After 1100+ hours I know how this game works and for sure, if I was the streamer, I would never have vaulted the window. Probably in that situation I would have tried to fake the vault and to dodge the chainsaw. Considering he is playing dead by daylight, I would have been surprised if this was not going to hit him lol.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs also some bleeding into other killers
---
Sorry not a native speaker, what do you mean by bleeding in this context? (I guess it is not just: Losing blood right here.)
---
What about streamers tho, Jendenise has her icons changed for a long time now and she didn't get anything ?
---
What really happened in the ending of the original Halloween movie
---
They can still spawn insanely close to your totem too.
---
Have you tried Civ6?
---
Legion also has stall, map pressure, tracking, free first hit, chase.
---
You know wgat LF has? Nothing. None of that.
---
Not today Brian.
---
Yeah but I want Jason to be kinda his own thing like he‚Äôs one of the biggest slashers out there so he should be unique
---
It's filled with Broomsticks with homing rockets and griefers of all kinds. Not hard to find a solo public session if you want to grind though.
---
If you're looking for PvP I'd go elsewhere.
---
Yeah, I just feel that there are killers and survivors who ruin it for everyone
---
Nah it was ridiculously cheesy and corny but it was also ridiculously well made. The designs of the ghosts, the house, the lore and the glasses aspect were all fantastic. It was just letdown by the fact it was far too fast paced. It‚Äôs enjoyable fluff, and holds up surprisingly well on repeat viewings
---
Same. Voorhees is my dude. But I feel they could easily set him aside from Trapper. For one: he won't sing about eating ginger snaps.
---
I am glad you don't make games because if we had only 4 perks that were meta and amazing the game would be so dull. Small Game can still be used to locate totems so you can find Hexs quickly or NOED if it pops at the end BUT also you can use it to work out what is real and what is a dream pallet. The perks are all still useful just not meta but if you go against that killer then it becomes meta for that game. Iron Will is a great perk and can save you in a lot of clutch situations but it works best against Spirits and Nurses. 
---
Yes knowledge you can easily get from a great perk like BOND. You are not going to ever have a situation that you can counter something 100% of the time and you shouldn't. This is a horror game that is supposed to be built around suspense and mystery. Your supposed to not be able to communicate with your teammates, know what they are running, know what the killer is running and up until Freddy know what killer it is until they interact with someone. The element of mystery adds dread and tension which is what makes this game exciting. The addition of many perks means it is a crap shoot, if you happen to be running iron will against Spirit your chances of survival are up opposed to others in your team who aren't. When you limit the perks people use the game becomes stale, repetitive and predictable. 
---
I will summarise this debate as I am done after this; your complaining about Freddy's pallets because you feel you cannot mind game them and theirfore you cannot outplay Freddy. I have told you of my own experience as both killer and survivor where Freddy has been outplayed, you do not accept this. I have then advised perks you can use to boost your chances to outplay Freddy as that is what perks do they help us with something we are weak on, you do not accept this. Instead you only want perks that are meta against all killers, even if they may contribute to any game in some way, and your adamant people are unable to memorise where pallets have been broken throughout the game so they won't use them in a chase, even though you can watch any content creators who are good survivors and see that people who excel already memorise pallet placement throughout a match. I can't help you no more but honestly I think you need to consider its you who has the problem and not the design of Freddy and maybe to try out some different things so you find your games with him easier. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results, if you won't consider learning to be good enough not using meta perks even if they make a killer you find hard easier and your going to just run your same build nothing will change.
---
lol np
---
I'll probably try it again, taking in consideration the discussions (including this one) that this thread stirred up, maybe in a week after Freddy is less of a novelty and with more clear rules about what is an "objective" fun factor. Thanks for the healthy discussion too.

Never going to happen. Way back when they tried a "hook progress slows down when you're too close" type deal but survivors abused it by looping near the hook and pounding out gens. People are just going to have to accept that camping happens. It sucks. I hate it too. But the best way around it is to play with friends that can punish it, or run kindred like I do.
---
Suviviors already don't do that vs NoED why would they now?
---
Why? It's the only outfit that gives her CLOTHES that aren't a freaking kimono or naked for no reason.
---
Holy shit now that‚Äôs a play. im shocked the Laurie came for you tbh, if that was me I‚Äôd of been left hanging on the hook.
---
My condolences. What caused you to lose your sight?
---
Wraith is probably the best killer for defending the hack now that it can be closed. Just stand still on top of it and the survivor won't even see you. Only thing they see is the hatch closing in front of them and you uncloaking towards them. (Unless they brought a key of course.)
---
Just play vs him like a stereotypical swf would and he will stop maining killer.

Couple days of pallet tbagging and flashlight clicking should do the trick.

Something the Friday the 13th game should‚Äôve done

[The game had just begun](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/937185783119370336/EDB67593FB6B298170E0BBC2E44582F5A7F658D7/)
---
NOED is for those who can't get a kill without it. Fact
---
the system sometimes checks if they suspect something. it was just bad luck they checked your files.
---
Ok so if you are in her terror radius or has the prayer beads add-on you cannot hear it. Other than those two things you can hear it
---
Plague should be in F tier. This is about fun for both sides, and she's simply anti-fun for the killer. You want a fun game of puking, projectile attacks, a power spiking ability? Well fuck you, this is M1 simulator because nobody cleanses.
---
Her add ons are very 1 dimensional, and better than that, 75% of them DO NOT FUNCTION since you aren't allowed corrupt purge in a match, and they only take effect when you have it.
---
Thanks for the update.
---
You hear it,when you are out of her husks terrorradius. Thats it
---
In her phase walking terror radius, or the husk's terror radius?
---
*i think we did a pretty good job*
---
Thank you so much!

I use a fabercastel ink pens for the lineart and watercolour paint for the colouring. For the black background I like using indian ink.

---
Oh OK, thank you.

Husk
---
And that‚Äôs why low levels bill are exactly that, low level. High ranks are high ranks because they either have great situational awareness or are selfish. Most likely the second.
---
That's not true at all, I'm red ranks as both, and there's not *always* Nurse, not even close. Spirit is way more common 'cause she's way easier to play. Same for Billy, really. And campers are still aplenty. Not as common as in brown ranks, 'cause they don't understand their objective, but still common, because they do it specifically do be dicks.
---
Unless he‚Äôs me then he‚Äôs going to lvl 50 bubba nurse and hag and a spirit main
---
Yeah its really sad that everyone tries to survive on their own at high ranks. A little selflessness goes a long way.
---
That‚Äôs great!!! It‚Äôs always a amazing moment for your first 4K!
---
How did they nerf her?
---
Camping isn't punished at all once you have the perks you want. You don't need BP and you don't need emblem ranks. Deranking through camping is a benefit, if anything.

It's also the reason why it's harder for killers in the upper ranks.  Altruism kills.  You can't force the little bastards off gens for nothing.
---
Because coders and artists are different.
---
Hey there! In this context bleeding into other killers would mean that he is sharing aspects of other killers but in a more subtle way. Hope this helps!
---
Yep, they are time based,  but it caps out at like 10 mins per match so you cant just afk with a killer for 20 hours to farm them.
---
what the hell just happened
---
nice play!
---
nice but spirit and wraith(with certain add ons) should be there too
---
I mean, you say that until you verse literally any stealth/trap killer, then the hospital visit makes it a bit of a drag
---
Didn't you lose half of your collected liquid if you died though? Or am I remember that wrong?

I don't know... I think you might get some weird looks around the office if you start 3D modeling dick that will never be used in game.

Oh yeah it does xD Thank you very much.
---
That's such a horrible game lmao
---
I just got spirit yesterday and I realized I just spent $8 just to be even more trash at the game
---
That spirit could‚Äôve got you if she played smart and instead of hitting the unhooked and risking BT, hit you where there was no risk of another hit.
---
I feel like I'm the only who didn't like that movie or this character. She looked like the Mary-Sue of horror.
---
Maybe, but that surely didn't stop survivors from doing that

If they made it so the blood for prestige was an overlay for skins (so it could go over other cosmetics) I think that would be a perfect reward.
---
This is the Freddy I strive to be
---
I've got around 40 hours of playtime, still haven't bumped into a single Hag so far. I thought that maybe she is used more in higher ranks and not so much in low ones, but it seems like that's not the case either. She seems like an interesting killer and Ruin is one of the most powerful perks in the game, so not seeing any Hags around is weird.
---
Not sure what to tell ya about your experiences. Maybe get good so you don't have to go against trash killer players. Sounds like that happens to you often enough to the point it isn't just pig players that do that to you and now you got a chip on your shoulder. Anyone who actually mains pig and is good at the game doesn't do that.
---
But he can just place new ones really fast. It's not like hag that needs to take her time to place them.
---
He's there he's just cloaked
---
That would be amazing lmao

They only disappear if you buy the dlc pack not just the killer

Man, it does my heart good to hear that! I won't quit all else because I do need to have a steady 9 to 5 for financial reasons but I hear you. My real problem is that in a way, I'm much too anxious to go all out. But that's another topic all together.
---
You're right, reddit is a good platform for my original work too and I should post more to get more exposure. I've stopped drawing for a while but I'll get back into it. I have many sketches just waiting to be inked. ;)

But it still means you can do at least 1 loop rather than getting killed in shack in under 5 seconds

If someone teabags me at first pallet i tunnel them for as long as i need to ensure they die. I dont even care about the game, just wanna slap em around

I was about to comment about Nea looking like a completely different race and Claudette's skin being significantly lighter. Makes sense know. OP should definitely add a note that these aren't directly modeled off the survivors.
---
There is a difference between other people expecting you to play by a rule

&gt;You hooked me so you're not allowed to hit me again or that's tunneling

And making rules only for you to follow

My internet is good, but when playing on my PS4, the game stopped and a message saying "Cannot Connect to Online Servers. Please try again later. Error code: 8,018"
---
Does it matter tho? If a killer is on your back, you shouldn't get an easy escape that abuses the turn speed difference between survivors and killers on console.  If anything the 360 soin should heavily penalise the survivor and slow them to a crawl.

The comment wasn't really meant to be taken 100% seriously.

The point is that as a killer, you shouldn't feel entitled to play politely.

Upvoted for your username.

I bought the game for three of my friends when it launched on xbox.  The que's were like 45 minutes so they ended up having a terrible experience and never playing it again.

I feel like they dont really fit them

---
There's being smart and turning into a complete badass in 5 minutes time. The movie isn't that fresh in my mind honestly, but if I remember correctly, everyone is scared (for good reasons) but her, she sees every trap, create her own traps and can tell what the killers are doing. 
---
For example, a character that is smart but not unstoppable in my opinion, would be Jenny in Eden Lake.
---
Why do you only have 1 perk
---
Yes, thanks for explaining your point of view so that I can change my mind.
---
I dont level up wraith. I did it for a daily ritual
---
\*slaps table\* Thank you! Everytime I rage under a post like this, I get downvoted to hell (maybe because I'm really mad about this).

The only thing she needs is a add on rework. More add ons for ambush, less annoying ones for RBTs

someone gets 360d a lot
---
The grind is really bad but otherwise it's better than DbD mobile.
---
Macmillan industry, Autoheaven shop, every Coldwind map, Disturbed Ward... Shall I continue?
---
Ok, yeah. As a killer main and a pig-trapper-hag main...that's whack.
---
Are you sure there's a lock on lunges ? I'm pretty sure that's what allows people to 360 because there is no lock hits compared to a simple attack.
---
As a wraith main, I've never read something so true.

I've never used them, but I'm assuming that you get the speed boost from uncloaking that way, so you could use it to mind-game survivors who don't run
---
You can get it on iOS I have it on here
---
Otz is so fucking amazing, super chill dude also
---
I‚Äôm not talking about the farmers (they are another issue tho). I don‚Äôt like getting 2 levels every killer game. I like the grind.
---
I've never denied that it's way more balanced than it used to be, it was the stupidest perk ever, so it can only be more balanced. And yes it happened once or twice that someone run into me on purpose and that's obvious, thanks you, but most of the time, it's me getting them by surprise. And I slugged people once or twice when I suspected they had DS, but slugging for no purpose is sometimes a waste of time and leaves you with almost no pressure which killer is all about.
---
Pick up animation Iasts approximately 3 seconds. count 1, 2 then flash. Assuming you have an angle it works every time
---
In SWF, yeah, sure, not getting the totems then crying about NOED is in most case not really justified.
---
But in solo queue, without any type of totem counter, you never know if you're the only one doing totems or not, if you need to keep searching after doing 3-4 of them or if someone else in your team took care of it. So unless you do all 5 of them by yourself, you're never sure. And statistically, if you only do 3-4 totems, NOED is going to end up on the hardest to find one, which is worst than if you didn't do any totem. So you're better off letting at least one easily reachable totem in place, but then when you come back during the endgame, some dumdum may have dismantled it for the BPs and NOED then spawned on a well hidden totem.
---
See ? NOED is often a checkmate on soloqueues, and easy to deal with by SWF, which I think is very bad design, because we're supposed to make soloqueue survivors lives easier and SWF harder, not the other way around.
---
Nooo, did they really get rid of that!?
---
Wheres the totem? Just too well hidden smh
---
Because you a testosterone built up incel telling me an 18 year old who‚Äôs clearly leaps and bounds more mature than you, telling me that I‚Äôm going to be shot up in a mass shooting really drives home your point, gg

man really lovin my 30 second hinder glue. so useful
---
Just realized we have yet to get an old lady survivor.
---
I didn‚Äôt read the last part of your comment and just clicked....
---
because noed only comes into effect after objective is done, while stuff like ruin and devour are active from the start so alot of people would star looking for more totems with the threat of those returning
---
"Dont let the killer find you and you'll win every game" you must be one of them locker hiding survivors who wait for their teammates to die so they can get the hatch.
---
There are like 5 pallets there, a few windows, the killer shack and that‚Äôs basicly it.

Literally read his thread with me, he‚Äôs a moron, he even direct messaged me to tell me to kill myself

Yeah it‚Äôs big brain time

Yeah, it was obvious, but their OC now absolutely outclasses the original and I can't help but find that hilarious.
---
Not mad over him doing it, actually frustrated at teammates not doing their objectives when they can see him because I have kindred.
---
This. There are almost no pallets and god forbid you are with a random that throws them down like they are going out of style. Window vaults are very minimum, if you run BL and get that map its basically a useless perk.
---
That too
---
I am surprised people still think this is true, that was placed by an individual as satire.
---
The 5 second stun needs to be nerfed to 3 seconds to stay in line with the Enduring nerf. The timer was only changed to 5 because Enduring made it a joke.
---
Also, they need to bring down the timer to 45 seconds. One minute is crazy long, and I‚Äôve had many many times where I‚Äôve downed two, hooked one, downed a third, and then get DSed by the third.  It can totally crush momentum and turn around the game entirely due to the extremely long timer.
---
Also, even though its unique, I hate going to lery's as both killer and survivor
---
You aren't depending on anyone as killer you don't have teammates
---
I don‚Äôt hate that.  Three seconds was the equivalent to old Tier 1, which while it wasn‚Äôt godly, I wouldn‚Äôt call it garbage.
---
Not even all SWF groups, I have had many of them compliment my skills and hand out many ‚Äúgg wp‚Äù‚Äôs. Obviously there are always the ‚Äúgg ez baby killer‚Äù players but they are few are far between (though more common at the higher ranks it seems)

True I shouldve put that, i agree its not a poorly designed map, just not fun to play

Is nudity allowed on this sub?
---
Every killer is a crappier version of hillbilly or nurse really. Legion is fun because you can get easy first hits and force survivors to waste time mending. Map pressure, detection, stalling potential is his purpose but he lacks lethality.
---
Go ahead and tell me why any of those killers are as good as Nurse, spirit, or billy. Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll wait.
---
Oh.
---
They‚Äôre NOT??
---
I guess that makes them worse versions of nurse spirit and billy huh
---
I think Noob3 ran just No Mither and Self Care doing the same premise, so I think you‚Äôre onto it
---
I had my Plague at P3 Level 50 and wanted all perks on her as she‚Äôs my main. I only have 50 of the 60 Killer perks unlocked anyway but even then it took me almost 20 hours of playtime to get enough BP for them all, and that was using Tier 3 BBQ and a Survivor Pudding/BPS in practically every game.
---
A 50/50 can very much be a mind game.
---
Take pretty much any fighting game, for example.
---
This just looks like a re-enactment of Halloween ending
---
Uh, I never said they were as good, but they have very different strengths than those killers, therefore making them different. 
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yikes lighten up loser
---
Dont tbag, don't flick your flashlight, run ds=toxic, run adrenaline=toxic, run borrowed time=toxic, pallet looping? Toxic, getting totems too early? Toxic, swf? Toxic.
---
There's plenty of things, just normal people drown it out and dont listen because it's just people in denial about not being perfect. 
---
I realize it's just a meme, felt like this was needed tho.
---
Try minecraft. Might be your speed.
---
Before it was okay because you could use it whenever you were downed, now you have a very specific scenario. It would probably need testing anyway, it's hard to tell if it would be good enough or not.
---
If they aren‚Äôt as good as Nurse, spirit, or billy, and they‚Äôre a killer, that makes them a worse version of nurse spirit or billy. It‚Äôs simple logic
---
Transforming (pretty sure they said they wouldn't make a killer that disguises itself as survivors)
---
Oof...
---
But well, I don't watch Noob3 that much, so I don't know in what kind of a style he usually edits his videos, but I edit my videos more like OchiDO, so I thought about bringing something a tinsy little bit new to the table with this idea. (unless someone has done the exact same thing)
---
I suppose the killer can be better, all Ik is I don't run it bc for me it is a dead perk 9/10games. May I ask what killer you were? Bc only a few can catch decent survivors by suprise, and typically if a killer isnt tunneling, I just think that a decent survivor can run a killer long enough for DS to wear off
---
Nothing to do, you already acknowledged it. I didn‚Äôt see it 3 months ago, so it‚Äôs new to me. Ignore the people who cry repost.
---
oh okayüòÖ thank you i felt bad haha but thanks
---
Yeah
---
That's not how logic works mate. None of those killers are stealth killers, meaning that stealth killers arent a version of them. Yes they're worse, but they're still different
---
Ruin is honestly useless, or that's how I feel. It's a hit or miss, especially at red ranks. I just run tremors and PGTW, also discordance. Last perk to help in chase or something (I use sloppy)
---
no, go somwhere else
---
You also get kidnapped by rednecks and wake up dressed as a gimp. Truly a masterpiece of mankind.
---
Slugging always makes me want to bring Unbreakable. Then I bring Unbreakable and never once have I been able to use it
---
They‚Äôre still killers aren‚Äôt they? Then the logic applies.
---
There‚Äôs no separate category for stealth killers, they‚Äôre all thrown in the killer category, that‚Äôs it.
---
I mean it‚Äôs a fairly Noob3 build if you added BL over Deja Vu, BUT don‚Äôt let that stop you, should still make good content and he‚Äôs never as far as I know done exactly that
---
Because the game knows what you want! I clearly wanted Monstrous Shrine T3, not anything like BBQ or enduring!
---
Maybe in your mind, but many people have stealth killers as they're own category. You're the only person I've ever met who didnt
---
I dont remember the fractured cowshed map by heart, but Im pretty sure it had places to use BL. And ik sheltered does its just there usefulness isnt that great. You have the trew in the middle, which has no pallets near it, i guess you can use your BL to go to one of the few pallets on the map, and then there is the basement stairs which are very hard to utilize even moreso than the tree
---
But they aren‚Äôt. There‚Äôs only one category.
---
Also: *their

Dead hard is bugged. Whenever I activate it I don't gain a boost forward and it doesnt seem to negate damage. The perk is pretty much useless for the time being and I hope for a quick fix.

---

---

---
just remeber to mark it as spoiler or NSFW
---

---
I swear I only ever get swamp or ironworks every single match and it‚Äôs making me hate them.
---
Alright, thanks for letting me now! :D
---
Again, you're the only person I've ever met who didnt categorize the killers at all. They arent the same, therefore they arent categorized as the same. They all have strengths and weakness, though some are much stronger or Much weaker than others. However, Billy, Nurse, and Spirit lack the strength of stealth without the use of add ons or perks, meaning that they are seperate from a stealth killer since it is impossible to categorize them as such
---
First game as killer on mobile 3 of the 4 survivors were on emulator.
---
When you're right, you're right.
---
Nope
---
This category doesn‚Äôt exist. There‚Äôs one category and it‚Äôs called ‚Äúkiller‚Äù. You can say how YOU categorize them all you want, but it‚Äôs wrong.
---
Ah ok. But at least with cowshed even if your BL is useless you know there will be a lot of pallets and vaults to fall back on
---
Not gonna lie, you're kinda a cunt
---
That's not what I said at all but hey man, if that's what you got from what I said then LMFAO.
---
Being able to tackle charge a survivor sounds fun, even if it might be a worse hillbilly chainsaw or pig dash, and I don't think having a secondary power to not have to walk to a hook after you down someone normally and pick them up would be too strong.
---
They should just add old lady laurie
---
Epic gamer insult, you really got me good
---
Again, have you not paid attention to the fact that me and most of the community uses stealth as a category. If you're gonna pull out that card, I can use it against you. YOURE the only person ice ever talked to or met that has put all killers under one category. Clearly, you dont pay much attention to the community.
---
Oh that‚Äòs great news! Compared to being lesbian that‚Äôs really a minor issue. Now it‚Äòs just about you telling him that you met a wonderful german man on the internet and you fell hopelessly in love. If he loves you, he will understand. What a great guy. Very canadian of him.

Agree. I yes

I can name a lot of the killers rule book

---
**DON‚ÄôT PLAY LEGION**

It doesn‚Äôt matter what either of us think, I‚Äôm just saying what the game says. The game has one category. I couldn‚Äôt care less what you and the rest of the community think, in fact I agree, there SHOULD be different killer categories, but there aren‚Äôt.
---
I played a ton of Freddy yesterday, but I think it also happened with Myers and Pig. With Freddy I remember clearly, two of them was when I teleported to a gen while in a chase and arrived behind them, another was just a plain outplay, not sure how to explain it. Otherwise some of them just didn't see me and ran into me.
---
I've only gotten a few matches against new Freddy in to be fair, but I think his passive sleep is underwhelming as it is. As I understand it, the only reason to stay awake is to have immunity from snares/pallets, and theres an add on or two that applies a debuff to repair/heal/sabotage speeds. But I haven't actually seen anyone using that addon yet so I dont know how strong that is or if it's just thanatophobia levels of secretly-actually-garbage. Meanwhile waking up seems to take a progressively longer time to do the more times per game that you wake up (alarm clocks may not count for that), and you're automatically "slept" after freddy hits you the first time regardless. As survivor I find myself wanting to just stay asleep and chunk gens, throw down fake pallets to help my teammates, etc, and as Freddy I'm hoping survivors are getting scared of sleepyland and wasting time on wakeups. 
---
I've gone off on a tangent but my point really is this, I love the idea thematically of only becoming sleepy when within freddy's lullaby radius, but mechanically I think it would be a big nerf to a part of freddy's game that doesnt feel very strong in the first place.
---
If anyones got a different take on his power or if this has been hashed out elsewhere I'm all ears, I'm just thinking out loud
---
"Sounds like you're bad and I'm good therefore I'm right" that's essentially what you said you twat
---
What annoys me though is that it works after 8 games of being completely useless
---
Wow. And here I thought massive TR doc was an evil build.
---
Still doesnt make them the same as nurse Billy, and spirit. Ghostface is nothing like them, so how is he a worse version of them? That goes for all the stealth killers. Whether you categorize them or not, the fact still stands

**Breakaway:** It's not over 'til it's over. After escaping a chase, gain a 5% bonus to repairing/healing/sabotaging/opening/searching for 15/20/25 seconds. 
---
**Misdirection:** You can't outrun them, but you can outthink them. After performing a fast vault or pallet slide, leave no scratch marks and gain the ability to perform rushed actions silently for 2/4/6 seconds.
---
**Watch Your Step:** You know that a seven inch nail can do all kinds of damage. Sabotage up to 2 windows, lockers, or dropped pallets to decrease the Killer's vault/search/destruction speed by 20/30/40%.
---
It‚Äôs not a fact, just your faulty reasoning, if they‚Äôre all only labeled as ‚Äúkiller‚Äù then the ones who aren‚Äôt as good are worse versions of the better one. This whole thing is a meme anyway that you‚Äôre taking seriously.
---
Atleast the others have something unique about them. All legion seems to have is speed. Nurse, spirit, and billy are faster and do more damage?

Doesn't even need to be skill or game mechanics that lead to the discovery, but just dumb luck or blind hunches. The first ranked match I ever played as a killer, as soon as the game started I went straight for the closest generator. I heard it running so I knew a survivor had been working it, but there was no evidence left behind of where they went. I was about to leave the room it was in, when I decided to check a locker in the room just to be safe.  Boom, survivor. He rage-quit after I got him on the hook.  
---
There was no reason for me to check that locker, other than just an assumption based on what I might have done where I the survivor.
---
Ok thank you!

5* wraiths there

How is it better? Because it runs Balanced Landing now instead of Sprint Burst? Because you sometimes run Adrenaline instead of Decisive Strike?
---
Since the release of Laurie Strode we haven't had a single purchasable DLC with an A tier perk. ~~Ash and nerfed Mettle of Man doesn't count.~~ The last character release that's had significant meta relevance was *David King*, released with The Huntress more than **two years ago.** Yes we've gotten some alternative situational perks like Deliverance and... Deliverance.
---
The Killer meta is also stale as shit but at least we get genuinely useable perks with every new Killer. BBQ and Ruin are still way too strong but at least perks like Bamboozle, Discordance, and Thrilling Tremors are being added. I wrote a [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c3h2kp/dead_by_daylights_unchanging_meta/) on this awhile back and that thread contains my thoughts a lot more concisely.
---
The most dangerous game is texting while repairing a generator. A mini heart attack each time
---
Yes they can but most people don't have all the perks for each character, and those 4 have perks right from level 1 that really can ruin a slugging killer. (Bill unbreakable, Ash flip flop, Kate boil over, Tapp tenacity)
---
I wonder if it sprint bursts in water

From what I've heard, MaA is incredibly strong. Maybe replace discordance with that? Build A is just s typical m1 build so that's pretty rigid, but you can build him pretty similar to myers imo.
---
Except they're mechanics describe who they are. Mechanics are the embodiment of a video game, not the names of menus. You still havent proven that wrong, you've repeated your point which I've invalidated, ignored my argument, and insulted me. You clearly dont have any other points and just cant accept that fact that you are wrong

Dad bods are best bods
---
Yes I would consider rank 6-7 experienced. And yes ofcourse you can make 4ks with old Freddy and there were also people who got to Rank 1 only with Freddy. However, that works with literally any killer. 
---
For the video: Yes otzdarva is great. He does explain how Freddy works and he does give good tips for the old Freddy but also alot of tips in general (his predictions how the survivors will react and which way they will go, what to do with what info etc.) He does play out Freddys strength very well, and he also explains his weaknesses. The thing is: In this game he does have a good luck: He mentions that Freddy isn't good at loops. And that's why he doesn't really commit to most chases. However the map kinda helps him with that. This map does have a lot of just cornfield in it, so less safe loops. The survivors also group up pretty often (here comes Freddys streangth) and they also aren't really coordinated (injured survivor goes for the unhook). So basically Freddys two biggest weaknesses aren't present in this video: Coordination and lots of loops. 
---
However he is really good and plays that really well, but just because you can play a killer good doesn't mean he isn't the worst killer. There was just no other killer that was worse than Freddy at the time. I mean who do we got there? Wraith? Always got his sneaky aspect. Bubba still has an instadown. Legion? Mending does cost more time than waking up.
---
Jakes r poo, unless it's Daddy Lynk :&gt;

How do you spin so fast without buffering your turn? When I start spinning, it's way slower. Maybe I'm on ps4...

But why Evan \*insert thinking emoji cause I can't copy paste one on my PC\*
---
My current build for legion is pop goes the Weasel, ruin, bbq and thanatophobia. I would really count bbq as too useful but I just really like bloodpoints. 
---
Basically he‚Äôs extremely strong if you control the pace of the game. Don‚Äôt hook the first person you see, frenzy hit them and try to get as many ppl injured as you can
---
I do because the killer would walk away and I used it to motor away
---
My friends and I have as well, and there was another post about it. Hopefully these have been seen and they are working to resolve this.
---
The best feeling is when the killer gets greedy as shit and tunnels me after slugging someone. Like sure buddy you‚Äôre definitely going to down me in 20 sec and hook both of us like I‚Äôm a rank 20. Slugging will never be a viable tactic if the survivors are. Well, unless you‚Äôre up against a God Nurse or a good Billy
---
Jason is the single most well known horror icon other than Freddy (and since we can't have the original Freddy it's definitely him) so he'd be way more than just a skin for their original character. And of they can't come up with anything new with 12 movies of  inspiration, they might as well not bother to get the license.

If that's not what you said that what did you say? Btw it's 2019, "triggered? xd" is only said by incel twatbags, which is clearly the case here.

You know you make yourself look 1w with every comment you make. You're the kind of person who ruins communities for people because you've clearly never heard of the word "kind" before.
---
Yes, downing someone but going for their teammates instead. You‚Äôre trying to down as many as possible, so you‚Äôre slugging. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to leave

Ahh okay, at least I‚Äôm not the only one. Thanks for letting me know!

The most important part of playing Legion is knowing when to use his ability. For starters, always run sketchbook or mural sketch for extra duration because base duration isn't enough. The only good addons Legion has are Stolen Sketchbook, Mural Sketch, Irridescent Button and Yellow Ruler. Don't even bother with anything else. Secondly as I said before, know when to use his ability. In the start of the match if you use discordance it's better to wait for it pop before you use frenzy because you might not have it ready for the chase. Wait around 10s for discordance to pop and if it doesn't, then use frenzy to patrol gens quickly. Also use frenzy to get out of the basement quickly, close the gap with a survivor and counter strong loops that can drag on for too long. When discordance pops you immediately know that there are more than one survivors there so use that opportunity to quickly chain first hits on multiple people. Ideally you want to apply deep wounds on a survivor then go to the next one, then the next one until there are either no survivors without deep wounds left or the last one is too far away for you to get there in time, cancel it and down the last one you injured. Be very careful though, ideally you want to injure around 3 survivors with every frenzy because trying to chain hits on all 4 survivors who are far away from each other wastes more of your time than it wastes for the survivors, but if they are all nearby by all means go for all 4. Since you are in lower ranks I assume, you should know that survivors tend to panic and run away after getting hit with frenzy so you will most likely find them in unfavorable situations for example far away from any pallet, loop, or double t-wall ( two T shaped walls with windows). Legion dominates small ranks because survivors tend to run away after getting deep wounds so they will run away to mend, then heal and then get back on a gen. This leaves them vulnerable and prevents them from doing their objective.
---
In DBD time is of utmost importance. The more time you make survivors waste is time taken from doing gens so make sure to always apply pressure; never camp because it's a horrible horrible strategy that makes you lose time, abandon a chase if you see its dragging too long, keep a mental image of which gens were being worked on so you know where to go if you just hooked someone or can't find anyone etc. I can't stress enough how important is to not stand around the hook and leave it because this way survivors will be forced to stop working on generators and come to help their hooked friend. 
---
Thankfully you don't have to worry about healing because Legion negates it since it's so easy to just injure them again and after you cancel your frenzy injured survivors should be easy pickings, for now atleast.
---
Good perks for Legion: Ruin (significant time waster), Spirit Fury/Enduring combo (you don't have to worry about pallets), BBQ (legion's map pressure makes him get to the survivors in time), Discordance (let's you know the location of multiple survivors and thus helps you get first hits), Pop Goes The Weasel (all around great perk and Legion's map pressure helps him to important gens in time), Franklin's Demise (his ability to quickly get hits robs survivors of their precious items), Monitor and Abuse (lowers your Terror Radius outside of a chase and let's you sneak up on survivors and the increased terror radius outside of chase helps you detect more survivors), Thrilling Tremors (Poor mans BBQ, great detection perk), Save The Best For Last (his ability to chain hits grants him tokens quickly), Thanatophobia (quick injuries means more use of thanatophobia) and Sloppy Butcher (forces survivors to waste time with healing).

Everybody comments that it happend to them aswell so im pretty sure now that it was just an connection issue. i wasnt too sure if it was a lagswitch or not, from what i seen over the internet, it looked like a lagswitch. I wasnt being salty or so at the killer, i was just confused over what has happend that match. So thank you for everyone who has commented on my post and showing me that it was just a connection issue :)
---
Man...every. Fucking. Time.
---
Pretty sure this is being used correctly
---
B doubt
---
Well, the Wraith was probably taken soon after killing Azarov. And even then, you don‚Äôt need invisibility to kill.  The Huntress, however, would have to be able to learn and use echolocation all by herself, in the middle of the forest, away from society, without any assistance or guide, and use it for about 20-30 years. Why would the Entity blind her? Also, I‚Äôd imagine something important like her being blind would be mentioned in her lore. Or maybe her FoV would be black and white to simulate her ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the world. But no, she sees color. And another thing, I‚Äôm not sure if humming works for echolocation. The blind usually click their tongues instead, like you mentioned with the blind biker.
---
Agreed to an extent. I still find his hitbox to incredibly ridiculous and that's irritating but otherwise it's been fun. And I have had no trouble with dream pallets since I run alert I see every single time he places one down
---
Ooh!

One of them was a friend, the rest few were just people complaining about it on a discord server I frequent.

The whole point of the movie is that it's supposed to be your common slasher movie but it turns out Erin, who looked like your typical final girl, was actually someone super prepared for something like this (due to her father). 
---
I can't see her as a Mary Sue because: 
---
1) Her skills came from somewhere. We just don't see her learning them because that's not what the movie is about.
---
2) Basically everyone in the movie hates her.
---
3) One of her traps backfires in the ending due to her being overly-prepared.
---
She's competent and the killers weren't expecting something like this. That's why she looks like a badass. Half the killers weren't trained and the trained ones had the element of surprise against them.
---
To be honest with you, I don‚Äôt even think he saw us until I had already got him off the hook and got in position to take the hit.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs very blind too
---
Sure thing! Funny enough it was against a hillbilly who already tunneled a random to death and we found this but couldnt cleanse. Immediately I was like nope, sorry but not gonna play a bugged 3v1
---
Fuck no I ain't taking off BT. Even if I play solo I'll still have BT equipped.
---
Why would you DC against him though? I feel like trapper, wraith and any of the sneaky bitches are way more annoying
---
No it was about mutual exchange.  If I'm the last survivor and I don't make the killer chase me, and instead they want me to help them complete rituals, that's fine, but sacrificing me afterward instead of giving the hatch is not cool.  Mutual benefit.
---
Haven‚Äôt tried it myself but I feel like pop would be incredible on Freddy right?
---
I guess all that stalking must be a pretty sweet workout
---
Its not bannable. Doubt the community likes this, but do what you must imo if it'll help you enjoy the game Idc
---
Killer's instinct is not attached to TR anymore so M&amp;A won't change the distance in which you can see survivors. Also, now that they are a 115% killer, healing is more important than before.
---
You would think. You can go to a gen across the map in seconds and regress it.
---
just start a match and leave immediately. survs don't get a boring match and you loose 2 pips
---
Switzerland flag, nice. France is beautiful.
---
Can? Yes. Will you? Unlikely. There is zero working way to report anymore. The in game reporting system does nothing and they closed the forum reporting.
---
I play on ps4 my dude. I've had great games and I've had shitty games where I get face camped because I ran the killer around for an entire match. I also play killer and a lot of survivors are complete trash but there's an even amount of survivors that are really good and fun to go against. 
---
 Everyone always says the killers on ps4 just tunnel. Have you ever thought that running was a bad idea though? Have any of y'all played killer besides just for dailies? You leave scratch marks everywhere. As a killer, if I see scratch marks and I'm not chasing someone, I'm gonna go see what's up. As a survivor, I always walk away from the hook unless the assclown is legit just face camping me. Y'all gotta play smart and unfortunately for you, especially when you solo queue, you can't just be running everywhere all the time. I play both sides. If someone unhooked me I'm gonna walk away and let the killer to after the scratch marks left by the dude that got me off the hook and ran like an idiot. I can't even count how many times I've been within 5 feet of a hook and the killer didn't see me and you can see them looking around and at the ground for the scratch marks then start chasing the one that ran instead of me. It doesn't work 100% of the time but it works better than getting tunneled right off the hook. A lot of you throw a stick in your bike wheel and blame the killer instead of admitting you made a mistake when you fall off your bike.
---
It's easy to remember bad matches and then assume everyone plays like that. Hey, a lot do but there's more that don't than there are that do.
---
I love how you gave him a peace offering!
---
True, but fun? The Hag isn‚Äôt all that fun to play against, probably because there are way too many people playing as her. I prefer variety. Also, it‚Äôs really not fun at all to have to watch your footing. With a bear trap, it‚Äôs easy to see and can be avoided. With the Hag‚Äôs trap, however, it‚Äôs a little harder to see and needs a flashlight to cleanse. Not to mention the team coordination needed to avoid them. I‚Äôm a solo survivor, and if I had a dollar for every time I warned a teammate but then die because they didn‚Äôt heed my warning, I‚Äôd be able to buy all the DLC twice. I‚Äôm not joking. 
---
Ghostface, however, can be pretty fun. It adds a bit of stress to the game since he‚Äôs hidden in plain sight. He has a good counter, which is just looking around. However, when survivors don‚Äôt observe their environments, they might just fall prey to Ghostface. His power, in my opinion, has a little more of a counter than the Hag‚Äôs traps since you can actually cancel out Ghostface‚Äôs power without a flashlight or any need to move around. You just stare at him. Seems simple to me.
---
As someone that does play surv, I would be happy for AFK-ing killer, as I could farm points then. And when AFK-ing, I could just leave the game running and not wait for getting match, which is *long* as a killer, with added bonus of EXP.
---
But I guess it would be more fair, and losing 2 pips would make it twice as fast, so thanks for the tip! But again, is this bannable, or not?
---
Always Xbox Players. üëè
---
Always Claudettes. üëè
---
No. There isn‚Äôt.
---
 Yes, when you hit, the killer does turn to directly face the survivor. However, that‚Äôs after the hit has already been detected. Without that feature, you‚Äôd still hit and do damage, you‚Äôd just appear to do so while hitting empty air.
---
They‚Äôve explained this on a stream before.
---
How will you ever get better if you don't want to play with survs who know what they are doing
---
&gt;when you slam it down and Freddy still smacks you
---
So what the difference between fake and normal pallets?
---
Cept no because what made mom strong wasn't just the extra health state. It was the complete immunity to going down at all. For example lets say your inured with old mom active.Well now you can take a noed hit, an exposed hit , or a fucking chainsaw. You can't do any of that even when full health. The only other mechanic in the game that allows for that is borrowed time which utilizes the same status effect. 
---
Trust me ranged machine gun hatchets with broken inconsistent hitboxes make not cleansing much more meta then you'd think. Ask any plague player and ask what type of team tends to survive against them more and 9/10 of them will tell you those that don't cleanse.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm tired of wasting my time because a butt hurt killer disconnects and we get no escape points as survivors (but killers get points when survivors DC) üôÑ
---
I don't think there's a balance problem with him, I just think there's a fun problem.
---
Huntress commands a fun and interesting metagame revolving around one simple mechanic: bitch has hatchets. From that one mechanic there's a series of different outplay options from both sides.
---
Meanwhile Freddy is just a fuckin messy pile of mechanics. From the start of the game you're transitioning to the dream world, while you're awake make sure you're keeping an eye out because he'll blip in and out of existence at a specific 16m window of distance, and being asleep really doesn't do much anymore except make you vulnerable to the rest of the mechanics, but also it can still slow your action speed if he has the addon, but it's ok because fellow survivors can still wake you up or you can go find the new *~alarm clock~* prop to wake up or fail a skill check, and then once you're in the Dream World you watch out for blood puddles that slow you and also apply the most useless status effect but it's there, but also if he happens to have the addon then don't worry about puddles because then there's fake pallets so pay attention to which pallets have been dropped until you see a blood puddle. Also he can teleport.
---
And for all that, you don't run loops any differently against Freddy, you don't play against him any differently, his counterplay is a standard killer + a rubik's cube. It's just kinda silly.
---
Much to my friends dismay, I really can‚Äôt play survivor. I play games to relax and playing survivor is just way too stressful, too hard on my nerves.
---
I think it is one for meg on PC to look like zoe from l4d (not certain). Definitely havent seen it on ps4
---
This is scumbag advice.  You steal their offerings everytime you do this.  Don't be a selfish tool.  Play your games or of you must babydepip do it while AFK.
---
Actually the in game report on console does quite a bit. One of my friends (seriously who is never unsportsmanlike), got a week long ban for unsportsmanlike behavior. It's strange as I have NO clue what they're reporting him for, but it does work.
---
Gotta love endless tbaggers as spirit. They don't even think its weird when you just look at them over the pallet.
---
SWF trivializes the game. Having just one competent friend makes a world of difference. I'm by no means a pro survivor but even I hover around rank 3.
---
Seen it on Xbox so must have been with bill
---
Ignore him there's nothing fair about quitting the match and stealing the survivors offerings.  Devs already announced they'll be implementing a punishment system for ragequits soon anyway.  Honestly depipping ain't gonna help you.  If you plan on playing this game focusing on improving your play is what you need to work towards.  You won't do that playing potatoes at rank 16.  Watch some YouTube videos there are plenty well known established killers that provide informative videos online to develop your game.
---
Maybe *learn* how to type correctly?
---
I dont want bill i.want the mags pants and claude's pants
---
Pop goes the Weasel is unbelievably strong on Freddy with his gen-teleport, and especially going to one two survivors are working on.
---
Your Build A is the classic M1 killer. It would be less effective if you take dream pallets, but if you're bringing snares go nuts my man.
---
Was he using add ons?
---
Found my new sub!
---
When you learn Spirit. You‚Äôll never go back.
---
The mobile version looks pretty bland/bad imo. This game doesn't work nearly as good on the medium as it does on the PC/consoles imo.
---
What does this do? I‚Äôve seen streamers play with it before, but didn‚Äôt know the reason why.
---
Nope, it's the same. Sloppy only makes it slower.
---
So start playing more survivor, there's obviously to many killers at the moment.
---
Unless they can hit skillchecks, because then they‚Äôre still fine.
---
This is a wonderful joke. I wish the entire world could enjoy it.
---
Things I didnt know existed for 400
---
understandable, have a nice day, also why people says "legion rule n1, don't play legion"?
---
That's shitty, but as i play mainly killer I know camping and returning to an early unhook.
---
I fucking hate these sorts of survivors.
---
Lery's because the map layout is extremely confusing for me.
---
Any Swamp map because of how massive they are, one has a stupid loop, and the other wastes too much time
---
He is slower than survivors during the charge time
---
I was trying to work that outü§îü§î
---
the killer rulebook is "just leave"  
---
the only rule is just dont be toxic lol
---
I honestly don‚Äôt want any more licensed characters. I get that other people do but a large majority of our licensed killers have been disappointing. Up until a little while ago two of our licensed killers have been f tier and the worst in the game. Obviously not every licensed killers are or will be like this. Myers brought the stalking mechanic to the game and piggy, despite being nerfed for no reason, has a unique and cool power. But it‚Äôs hard to get outfits. It‚Äôs hard to shove into the lore. And it sucks loving a character and knowing they won‚Äôt ever get anything.
---
Good to know! Thank you.
---
Lol I literally just destroyed a totem at that spot 2min ago. Then decided to check reddit while looking for a new lobby. Terrible totem spot.
---
I was going to say, "at least you can charge in and easily take people out, so that couldve been fun", then realized you were leatherface. And that build... Idc if I get karma bombed, u get what you deserve XD
---
My heart dropped the first time I  realized that the bleeding generator was just an added creepy effect
---
"people of the fog. Please uninstall the game"
---
sometimes its very easy, its pretty inconsistent
---
Ooooh. That hard R is cringey
---
now switch out adrenaline or ds for dance with me and watch killers doing the loop a few more times before they realize you're gone xD
---
To add to your great points, I saw the movie also as a metaphor for relationships. Girlfriend comes into a family situation where people are hostile towards her and her relationship. But she is actually prepared to take on their bullshit and she is she is not to be underestimated. 
---
And in the end the one she should‚Äôve been on guard against was her boyfriend who brought her into this situation and just hoped for the best when she could‚Äôve been hurt (killed).
---
That's why you leave and rob them of exp and points, there's only 1 way to win against trollers.
---
Ignore scumbag bm survivors.  Hope you reported the guy at the end there though.  Racism or the KYS shit is where they cross the line and deserve the bans.
---
If killer DCs, the survivors should get a shit ton of BP
---
Oh, it steals their offerings. Not gonna do it that way then. I know how wasted offering feels (in a big part because of playing on this rank, and getting 0k sometimes when I used survivor pudding).
---
I may watch some guides, but I'm not sure if I'm too much about improving play. I like to play various killers, including low tier ones, recently I've been playing a lot of Wraith (in some part because he is the only killer I have purple BBQ and Chilli on), and it's punishing. 
---
If this game had some sort of reward for ranks I'd propably be more about it, I know it from how I cared about rank in LoL and Overwatch. But that's not the case, so I don't really feel need to be better.
---
Which youtube channels would you recommend that may have some guides?
---
Yeah, I did report him. I don't usually report people but I agree, racism is crossing a line.
---
Dude I had the funniest shit ever. 
---
We had a Clown on Ironworks that I looped for 3 gens. He downs me, hooks me, and then proxy camps. Our Claudette saves me and I let her sandbag me bc I had decisive. Well clown downs me again and I decisive off of him. He chases me again and downs me in a corner. And the only 2 hooks he could have brought me to, our Meg sabo'd so I wiggled off. 
---
He DC'd. I was laughing so hard
---
I wonder who they would blame if no one plays killer anymore? 
---
Probably the game or the devs.
---
Yea I sometimes proxy camp if I know it‚Äôs an swf group and I know they are gonna be altruistic.
---
Wait the mobile version is out?
---
If only that would happen
---
Or the rev of the saw is faster.
---
Post game chat is awful on pc. I'm sorry dude.
---
I don‚Äôt think Ruin is necessary for Freddy now
---
BBQ / Pop / Enduring / SF is what I‚Äôd run
---
Wow that‚Äôs fucked up... ridiculous the lengths some salty basement trolls will go to be an asshole.
---
Ngl I‚Äôve done this to people who were being dicks to me
---
no lunge should not be nerfed at all, it's perfect the way it is, if it doesn't exist then no survivor would die lol, all am saying is that Freddy's lunge looks longer (some guys say it seems longer) but during chases I'd have quite some distance and he jsut lunges on me, other killers miss from that range, thats simply all what am saying. maybe it's intended or a bug, idk
---
God, I keep watching this because it's so beautiful.
---
Just equip Plunderer's and Ace in the hole and give items to your teammates and just don't give a fuck if you die
---
Hope all tbaggers rude and racist players get their gaming screen exploded on their face with shards of glass sticking in their eyes blinding them.
---
My favorite is the ones who think they're smart and will climb back over as they think I vacuumed away but I'm just having a moment and catch them.
---
you sure mate? it feels like he has quite some distance from you before he lunges, like longer distances compared to other killers.
---

dont forget the ones on the hills, fucking lighttowers.. but i havent seen those in a while so maybe that did got fixed
---
Was this a Nea?
---
maybe its the claws thing, but like a lot of times I notice he is quite far from me, other killers cant lunge, but he does... maybe he's intended to do so, or if not its a bug.. idk
---
I play Quinton and Laurie from time to time but it‚Äôs not fun seeing everyone get cosmetics but you. I‚Äôve been playing a lot of David lately just because I don‚Äôt see too many of them.
---
That would be awesome, thanks!
---
So there are infinites ^_^
---
IDK whether it belongs to r/dadbydaylight  or r/dbd_irl
---
He walks like he got a dildo stuck up his ass, tunnels the shit outta someone.
---
Wraith is also a pain in the ass.
---
r/lostredditors
---
Oh I agree
---
So if someone Tbags you Aka Taunting or making fun of you then they should Die, Nearly Die or have a fucked up face? That‚Äôs pretty fucked man. 
---
We would need another Frank Castle around these parts.
---
Same thing happened to Noob3 when playing the PTB on dedicated servers. 
---
The game is gonna improve a lot when the dedicated servers come out but it is not gonna be perfect.
---
Very situational, but can be paired with BS/Fire Up and be used as a faster uncloak.
---
Have you considered the option that you are bad at hitting them?
---
You could always change it to pressing the scrolling thing, or m2 if you don't use medkits or toolboxes. I play a lot of Overwatch and changes my melee to pressing the scroll thing so I'm used to it
---
I'm terrible at remembering specific variation names but if the worst designed map isn't Haddonfield it would definitely be the Coldwind variation with the absurd building with all the rails the killer has to chase you through with no mindgame.  If you got the god spawn on the window there and it's on the side by the rails you are invincible repairing that gen.  On a related note I am so sorry to the Bubba that made the mistake of chasing me through that loop yesterday.  I know that couldn't have possibly been fun for you.
---
Survivors created that meme when Legion came out because he was unfun to play against
---
I was against a Michael as Cowboy Jake. He chased me for a while as the last couple of gens were being fixed. The exit gates were almost powered, I ran over to them. Michael got two Ash‚Äôs whilst I think David(?) ran off. I stayed and waited for them to go on hook. One Ash died, the other was in second state. The Michael knew I was around and we were next to the exit gate so obviously stuck around(as any killer should) and with BT I went to save the Ash. He got away and I got downed. I was on my last hook, but Michael picked me up and brought me to the exit gate :D He let the rest of us go. 
---
I later asked him why he let us go, and had the response ‚ÄòYou sacrificed for him, that‚Äôs respect you can‚Äôt buy ;)‚Äô 
---
Made my day. Michael if you‚Äôre reading this, you definitely deserved the kill, but it was so wholesome and made my heart melt! Hope you all have a lovely week next week.
---
it was annoying when toxic people abuse it. but it was more stacks for STBFL
---
If you dont have extra mouse buttons this works fine sure
---
Broke that poor mans ankles
---
The funeral is about to begin sir.

How do you get it on iOS?

Nah I‚Äôm Schlostic and I play Jeff because Jeff is thiccer than Jane
---
4 words. Complete ignorance, Survivor Main
---
It popped up because all the m/m stuff would get downvoted to hell while the m/f &amp; f/f would be upvoted.
---
Oh, and I‚Äôm making Shirtless Myers soon after this to celebrate Summer (which is the best season, fight me).
---
Wasn't balanced, still not balanced.
---
It‚Äôs all subjective, for me Hag, Freddy, and Ghostface are not fun to play against.
---
I do enjoy playing against Huntress, Myers, and Doc.
---
What if you just failed the skill check?
---
Yessss...YESSS...let the hate flow through you....
---
Thanks!
---
Such is the fate of most subreddits. Even pokeporn has a gay sub
---
They're not in the game anymore because they were stupidly overpowered and overly abused to the point that BHVR felt forced to remove or nerf them. 
---
Survivors had mechanics that were more broken than any killer addons, and yet killers are the ones who feel bad about abusing strong addons.
---
My point is about how there is a disgustingly blatant double standard. If killers use good addons, they're sweaty, they're toxic, they're using crutches because they're shit at the game.
---
If survivors use their op shit, it's expected, and the killer needs to "git gud" if they can't learn to beat those survivors. 
---
If survivors played fairly, they might still have the OG Brand New Part. They might still have permanent sabotage. But no, if survivors ever get something powerful, they overuse it until it gets nerfed or removed. You don't see killers doing that.
---
Running decisive doesn't make you bad.  It's the only defense against terrible killers who resort to camps and hard tunnels off hook.  I run it every game post rework (it was noed level cheese before) and I do so solely to punish babykillers.  I had to D Strike like 7 killers yesterday at rank 5 because they were playing to proxy and hard tunnel to death.  Framing it as a crutch post rework is just silly man.  It's literally the only defense you have against those types of players.
---
I could have, yes. But then it still would have Pinged me,
---
No he's not
---
Im new. What is that?
---
It‚Äôs all choices at the end of the day so realistically you screwed your self since you had a choice to get out of the situation even if it means compromising yourself.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
His snares and pallets don't exist for awake survivors, and his teleport to generators ability has a significantly longer cooldown if everyone is awake (I believe it's 15% faster for each survivor asleep)
---
Thanks for the advice :)
---
Bond, Sprint Burst (debatable), Adrenaline, Botany Knowledge, Self Care, Iron Will, Balanced Landing, Urban Evasion, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable, Lithe, Dead Hard, Deliverance, We'll Make It. These are all good perks that you can play at rank 1 without any issue, that's 14 perks, and that's without the perks that you can make a synergy with. 
---
I agree that most new survivors perks are bad, but the perk pool is bigger than ever and is okay for now in my opinion. Of course I'd love to get some perks reworked or buffed to make them viable, but the meta clearly changed and isn't made up of the same 4 perks as it used to be.
---
And Ruin and BBQ aren't too strong, they just don't have anything to be replaced with (unless that's what you meant I'm not sure) so we are stuck with only 2 perk slots available. That's my concern, even though killers have more viable perks with the new killers compared to survivors.
---
What is a 4K?
---
Only BBQ will increase the amount of BP you get and the end of the match because it multiplies what you gained before (Ex.: 15.000BP will be 30.000). The rest will only increase the speed for reaching 8000BP (the max you can get in a category).
---
ooooh
---
New Freddy jumpscares me a lot with his lullaby
---
It forces a medium vault. Same goes for clown‚Äôs bottles, as you can‚Äôt fast vault when you‚Äôre not running at 100% speed
---
About waking up, just fail a skillcheck once a minute
---
so..am i toxic if i play legion? :(
---
Honestly the "stand still and do nothing as Spirit" mindgame might be my favorite shit in the whole game. It looks sooo stupid on the killers end but it's actually godlike
---
You really don't need add ons on those killers to do well. They are really good on their own.
---
Huntress and Hag are also really good killers, try them out.
---
this is a good idea just too strong. imagine doing the objective and almost being punished for it. the exposed status should be a reward for doing something imo, not given bc you cant keep survivors off of gens. this perk would also make things like overcharge useless as why try and delay them when you can let them do the gen and then one hit them. pairing this with that perk that highlight all survivors near a gen when its completed would be completely broken. 
---
I like the idea of the ability but feel that it needs a longer cooldown. maybe 40 seconds ish as it is powerful. 
---
the second perks timer is way too long. having a survivor locked at 80% percent sprint speed  for 2 minutes would make escaping near impossible. pairing that with the ability of him breaking pallets and vaulting faster. there would be no way to loop him as a less skilled player.
---
the last perk is a good concept and it think it should be 4-5% per gen and max out at 20-25%
---
the idea you have presented with this seems to try and keep the survivors in for as long as possible. this could be boring for survivors as there could be little counterplay to this idea if done wrong. another problem is that Friday the 13th game has the rights to jason i believe so actually getting him in would be near impossible. 
---
nice idea just a bit off on timings and i dont think you realise the actual power of those perks and ability
---
oh okay!
---
Oh fuck I just realised 2020 is in like 5 months, and not 10 years üò≠
---
came here looking for this post
---
Trappers main perks to focus on are one to help out him in general as a straight up m1 killer. That‚Äôs what he benefits most along side with Hex: Ruin since he has to set up traps first. 
---
Traps well you could be predictable and be punished at high ranks. 
---
Or you can place traps in a different spot around that location and get rewarded.
---
As someone who plays killer a ton, I'll give you what my rulebook would be. 
---
Don't t-bag.
---
Don't wait at the gate unless you're gonna body block someone I'm chasing out.
---
Aaaaaand that's about it. Any killers that get upset about anything else need to get over it.
---
Nurse was a respond to survivors mechanics, so you're kinda wrong
---
Just ‚ÄúASAP‚Äù ü§°
---
Claudette or Min, probably
---
She scares the fuck out of you
---
I tried that a couple of days ago, pretty sure there was no speed boost after damaging generators. I think I'd rather use any other add on, but I only play the wraith for dailies so I'm probably not the best source for how to use his abilities
---
Ohhh okay thank you!
---
50/50 is a mindgame dude. When a killer hides his/her red light you have to guess where is he coming from, if you're on unsafe pallet you have to guess on which side killer is gonna swing. It's all 50/50, Spirit can just do it by standing still.
---
SWF = Survive with friends
---
Pinhead, Candyman
---
I think the Plague‚Äôs perk Corrupt Intervention is good for him. It blocks off 3 gens for 2 minutes and gives him a good set up time. Another perk I like on him is Save The Best For Last, a Michael perk. Also using the tar bottle add on really help trap some motherfuckers. As survivor against him, small game is great to have.
---
See, this is where devs for pure MP games shoot themselves in the foot at a launch. If its not crossplatform, then certain platforms are going to suffer through queues and just give up. Hampering a great chance at them getting more people to play, and longer queues for everyone altogether.
---
Because you can't "see" them, maybe the pole is wider then it appears in terms of blocking line of sight. The grass might also be hiding enough of their body to prevent detection as well.
---
ThEy doNt LiKE mE sO ThEY MuSt bE SuRvIvor MaIns
---
Fun is super subjective so I guess it's your tier list.  
---
I hate going against Trapper so much that I would put him in Z tier, I hate playing Michael, he's extremely boring for me, but he's fun to verse, I like going against Doctor because he is garbage but I hate playing him, because he is unrewarding garbage. Etc etc, my list would look completely different.
---
Then just? break it when it's dropped?
---
Thing about frequency of Nurses compared to frequency of Spirits, has little to do with difficulty. It has everything to do with enjoyment.
---
No one wants to wait 10 or 20 minutes in killer queues only to have people DC vs them because it's Nurse. It's also not as fun getting into a game after waiting so long only end it in 3 to 5 minutes because you're Nurse.
---
Add to that, the ridiculous emblem system, and playing Nurse ends up depipping you because you got 4 hooks, 8 hits, and 4 chases. Not nearly enough to satisfy the Sacrifice,  Chaser, or Brutality emblems.
---
That being said, Spirit is for sure easier, but people would rather play her because she's not going to depip you, not going to cause (as many) DCs, and because the games last slightly longer and therefore are more fun.
---
It really is like that too lol.  People boost rank with it and end up playing against survivors they are simply not equipped to deal with.  It can't be fun for them getting their teeth smashed in chase after chase all because they salvaged some pips endgame with a last second noed down previously.  This is a public service announcement.  If you run NOED you're more likely to rank up without knowing how to combat the mechanics of the survivors properly which will make your life hell as you get higher and higher.  Don't run it, and develop your play against opponents of your skill level.  It'll make your gaming experience much more enjoyable as you approach red ranks down the line.
---
That‚Äôs not what survives say about noed and Franklin‚Äôs demise though.....
---
RIP to your friend's dog
---
And then Myers at tier 3 comes and one-shots both of you.
---
I run into situations like this a lot its a good move with a key since the killer can't hatch grab.
---
If we both sit and spam close/jump killer wins every time. It's better to wait by a far door if the killer is camping hatch waiting to close it like i was here.
---
I wouldn't say he's going to be #1 played. He's a jack of all trades, master of none. 
---
* He has map mobility, but not as much map mobility as killers dedicated to mobility, like Nurse, Billy, etc, since his is restricted to generators
---
* He has anti-loop abilities, but ones that aren't as good as other killers dedicated to the chase, like Clown
---
I also don't think skill is a fair assessment because the vast majority of the killers in the game based on their kit design don't require much skill to learn. The main difference here is that Freddy is not total garbage like the vast majority of killers. Plus, survivors have plenty of ways to erase mistakes with nothing but a button press (Dead Hard, Decisive Strike) and have items like instaheals so the survivor side is full of unskilled things. 
---
You still have to learn the fundamentals of mindgames and chasing with Freddy, since as mentioned before, he's still mostly a M1 killer.
---
I no longer look for hatch during EGC. I‚Äôm able to trick open the door after they close the hatch.
---
I‚Äôll only go for hatch if, like you said, I had a key.
---
But 9/10 I can manage to get the door open.
---
Bloodlust isn't even that big of a boon since it got nerfed a while back. If you're playing correctly you can make him lose Bloodlust each time he gets it with a pallet.
---
Oh, yeah, never do right under the pallet, then they can just cover it over with the pallet. If you‚Äôre going to trap one, trap to one side or the other.
---
EVERY. TIME.
---
Aerial attacks on the chapel maps are quite fun with him lol
---
Different totem, pallets, holes, trees etc
---
One word
---
**Edgy**
---
Because you want free and easy wins against the majority of killers? :\^)
---
I found it here: [http://jackchain.sale/toxic-grind](http://jackchain.sale/toxic-grind) when i saw can't wait for it.
---
The way the graphics synced with the 360. Nice.
---
Rest in peace the dude under the roof minding his own business
---
Putting 2 or 3 snares up against a gen to keep anyone from touching it without Freddy knowing has worked out pretty nicely for me several times. But of course I'll be using surveillance for that purpose once I can find the damn perk in my webs
---
I really don‚Äôt like any of the perks, they are too strong, but especially #3. You are harshly penalizing the survivors for doing their objective with the killer having to do nothing whatsoever. The thought of this stacking with other perks like Thanatophobia or god forbid, Dying Light, is gross. If the killer hypothetically had Dying Light and camped/tunneled the obsession out the game, after 3 gens being done the survivors would be under a 46% penalty! And it would only get worse from there...get another gen done somehow and now it‚Äôs 53%. This would be insanely broken. Hell even just Thanat with this would be nuts. 2 gens done and 2 injured and it‚Äôs already a 22% penalty, almost equal to Dying Light.
---
Feng is the smallest survivor
---
&gt;no one runs Deliverance because it curses you to be found first
---
LOL. I wonder what would happen if all 4 survivors ran deliverance. I'm betting the killer would just show up at all 4 locations at once. Either that or the universe explodes.
---
I don't know why I love this so much but thank you
---
I brought my bud over from F13 and he's become a Michael addict lol
---
Killers can cheese the hell out of that strategy too if they run Whispers 24/7 like i do.
---
Wait by the hatch and don't close it until whispers lights up until survivors get bored then follow the perk light from door to door.
---
Basically standoffs 2.0 if the survivor is aware of this strategy.
---
Can‚Äôt argue with stupid.
---
Yea? That's his counter. The trade-off being that a single, well timed Evil Within 3 can down the entire Survivor team within 20 seconds. People misuse his Teir 3 greatly, simply popping it on a single Survivor then actually picking them up and hooking them. While that isn't a bad play, it certainly isn't the best thing a Teir 3 Myers should do. When you're in Teir 3 Survivor tend to play more cautiously, running the second the hear the Heartbeat, being less Altruistic, etc. Use that to your advantage and slug Survivors, while a slugged Survivor is in less immediate danger than a hooked one, you easily waste 10 seconds trying to hook them, and Teir 3 only lasts 60 seconds with no add-ons.
---
Serious question: Are you blind?
---
If i am the killer that only happens when u tbag me
---
A offering that allows you to play the role of a dlc killer without perks or add ons
---
This is a quick bit of hopeful fanart I put together last night. :)
---
I saw it and remembered a spirit game I had a little while ago and just couldn‚Äôt resist
---
Love it.
---
Only thing is beside dealing with "1/2 token". You should just double the value of everything so you're working with 1 token instead of 1/2
---
He shouldn't be keeping it while dropping snares, on every other killer if you use your power you drop bloodlust.
---
"Conservatives are economically ultra liberal"
---
Do you mean NEO liberal? Are you trying to say they're leftists? What are you saying.
---
deadbydaylight is literaly the definition of edgy you meg ass
---
üëΩ
---
What he said. Plus, you‚Äôre better off using strong perks so you perform better and earn more points.
---
I think new DS is fine as it is. You can see which survivors you have just hooked/downed via the HUD, so getting hit by a DS will only happen if you fail to keep track of this information. There is plenty of room to play around it. If you do find the unhooked guy again, you can still slug to create pressure.  
---
It is annoying to go against DS as killer, but I think it's more annoying to get tunneled as survivor. Tunneling prevents a player from getting to play the game at all. Rather than change gameplay to disincentivize tunneling, they've given us DS. It's not a perfect fix, but at least it makes playing solo queue a little less cancerous.
---
I am a bit nostalgic for this type of stuff because I watched it as a kid, but I still like watching these for the practical special effects. Phantasm is one that definitely delivered on the gory fx!
---
make an apple account in the region it‚Äôs available in, then just download and you‚Äôre good to go.
---
I want otz to go back to dark souls 3 but that game is old and irrelevant now :(
---
Oh my god I could only imagine what The Spirit would look like
---
Probably a "/s" after your initial post would have let everyone else in on the joke. ;)
---
You go down in rank and get easier pkayers.
---
What a fair map
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOxpBwyhz-w Late reply but according to this guide Plague both moves slower when actively charging the vomit (No idea if it gradually speeds up to "Holding" speed or if it instantly speeds up once the bar is full) and has a reduced slowdown once the meter is full. There's no overall speed boost just for having corrupt purge on you, it's just for when your puke meter is full and you're holding M2. (You still have the charging slowdown, but the "Holding puke while meter is full" slow is effected.)
---
Interestingly the better tablet addon makes you move at 117% speed when you're fully-charged with corrupt, meaning you should be holding M2 pretty much all the time if you have corrupt.
---
Try doing the huntress, she's my fav!
---
Amazing job wow
---
What were the changes that happened?
---
This is why all of my objective buttons are set to one hand. And all of my looping buttons are set to the other.
---
But if they are, only a handful of Killers can prevent the escape.
---
Dude that is actually fucking amazing. 
---
I wish I could draw that good. 
---
If I could I‚Äôd probably try and get into some animations and work with movies or games. 
---
I just get frustrated and angry too quick with my bad drawling lol. 
---
But anyways man yeah I would love to see more drawings from you In the future.
---
Just need help hitting hatchets more consistently
---
It's a cursed/blessed perk.
---
Oh boy, I went through all the Friday the 13th movies recently. Most are really tough to get through. Not because of the scare factor, but because they're JUST. SO. BORING.
---
It looks even better framed. You are an incredibly talented artist, and I truly hope your work gets well known. It is absolutely beautiful. Personally I would love to see a nurse drawing, but there are so many to choose from and I know you‚Äôll do any of them justice. Please be sure to let us all know who you decide to draw. And again. Absolutely stunning!
---
True Whispers is really good for these type of moments and I‚Äôve ran into this moments but I‚Äôve always succeeded. Maybe it‚Äôs just my luck.
---
And as far as perk light from door to door, I wait for them to check one door and then leave, I then start opening it but stop before the first light starts up, they come back, leave, and then I finish opening it up right as they return.
---
The only problem I‚Äôve had with that strategy is Billy. Spirit, I have to wait for her to use her phase to go to the other door. Nurse, I don‚Äôt encounter many problems with, but other than all that, I can manage. Again, just my luck.
---
My only drawback is killers leaving you slugged for EGC to kill you. Those moments are the worst, for when I play survivor.
---
Nurse, Spirit and Billy. 
---
Gotta give Spirit credit she is better then Billy.
---
10/10 would use this skin
---
When you have a "Trap X amount of survivors daily." God I'm lucky I ran into people willing to farm because otherwise that daily is impossible beyond rank 15

Now i think even if i know i wouldn‚Äôt tell you since i like that map.

what the fuck

Don‚Äôt get so personal about it? Yes saying something about your family is very fucking rude. But at the end of the day they are just talking shit to affect you and then they are happy and live on with there cruel nature. 
---
You can take a screen shot and find a way to send it to the devs. 
---
You can mute chat as well. 
---
But my best advice is don‚Äôt take anyone seriously on the internet when they talk shit.
---
Thanks for the concern. ;)
---
what is this 1915?
---
The trycycle behind him
---
I completely forgot about The Archives. That‚Äôs gonna be really nice to have since i‚Äôve always been invested in the lore.
---
I‚Äôve got quite a few hours of LF under my belt. I think there‚Äôs just a few minor tweaks he needs to be much better.
---
Make his chainsaw mechanic like Billy‚Äôs. No more of this 99% then lose your rev garbage.
---
Doesn‚Äôt slow down while revving his saw
---
Since he lacks mobility and is one of the biggest killers in the game, lower his terror radius.
---
Fix his broken add ons
---
There you have it. A simple LF fix. He won‚Äôt be Billy tier or anything but at least people will play him seriously instead of meming in the basement.
---
Feelsbadman. I convinced my uncle to try it back in January (my Aunt and Uncle are only like 5 years older than me) and he had time for 1 game before going somewhere
---
A farming Legion. So even if the Legion tried it was a bad time
---
This is common for alot of players and the matchmaking systen is poorly balanced. The only reason beond unlycky or selectiv memory is that you cant play WITH a 4 man swf when solo cuing but you can face them when playing killer. I know the pain but i have no tips on what to do...
---
1. Don't loop.
---
2. Don't flashlight save. 
---
3. Don't use DS.
---
4. Don't use Borrowed Time.
---
....
---
65. Don't use insta-heal.
---
Yeah, there are a lot of things that annoy both survs and killers.
---
I usually don‚Äôt but this bitch ass hoe somehow keeps messaging me after blocking her
---
If the killer isn't facecamping and there's a possibility to be saved, then I'll stay. If it's clear that the killer is going to not let anyone unhook me, then I'm just going to give up. At the end of the day, I'm playing for my own enjoyment and button mashing for a minute is a waste of my time with no valuable reward. And no, getting &lt;1000 bloodpoints, and making the killer depip isn't enough to make me waste my time and enjoyment.
---
I mean he's not wrong, but you right like bruh
---
What do neo-liberalism have to do with the left ? It's a center-right movement.

No, I'm saying ultra-liberal, like in the wild economic liberalism

I'm sorry it ended up this way ): maybe you might convince them again after so much time passed by.

i love that xbox players get bill when ps4 is still waiting..hope ya‚Äôll have fun
---
people that play meta and not killers they enjoy are brain dead. ah yes i will play this game (which was designed for people to enjoy it) just to sweat and dunk on rank 15. for fucks sake, it‚Äôs not about winning
---
but i still don't have susie
---
Dying light is a toxic perk
---
Killers can‚Äôt grab anymore bud
---
Daubeny what are you doing here , you're supposed to face a trial by combat
---
Just injures them?You know you can down survivors with corrupt purge, right? That‚Äôs why nobody cleanses, it‚Äôs too strong.
---
You do realize that survivors don‚Äôt become INSTANTLY broken, right?
---
When did I ever say anything about playing Meta killers? You're point just didnt fit. I dont play meta killers, I play clown, pig, and ghostface. I was just pointing out that your point was wrong
---
anybody who complains about those are rank 20s
---
Damn, this looks great.
---
well your defending the guy that says that spirit, nurse and billy are the only ones worth playing
---
If you play against people with brain they wont let you brake them and them M1 when you do broke them. Corrupt Purge lets you ignore most loops which you will have to run if you dont insta M1 broken survivor.

Imagine if there were dick physics in the game.  Trapper standing over you just swinging it back and forth.

Corrupt purge can hit multiple survivors like cannibal, can remove the wipe animation to save time like a hatchet's successful hit, can avoid loops at pallets just like huntress.
---
Being the best bloodlusting character means next to nothing in the current state of the game. I implore you to actually think about what you're saying before you post, and maybe get past yellow ranks.
---
I don't get it

No I'm not, your argument just didnt make sense. My original comment was even there to prove his point wrong... Are you sure you even read it?

M5 skill check gang rise up üòé
---
The entity always eats things farthest from the center then moves in from there
---
of course all killers powers center around ending loops, no shit, it‚Äôs the most important thing they need to do, but they execute it in different ways
---
So they call it EGC (End Game Collapse).  When it gets to the last survivor the hatch spawns regardless (they don't need to repair 2 gens anymore).  Also you can no longer interrupt grab them out of the hatch.  I figured I'd lead with the tradeoffs they gave survivors but literally everything else is decidedly in the killers favor with the new system.
---
Now for the good.  We can close the hatch.  Just find it first close it and it stays permanently shut unless they have a key on them.  At this point their only means of escape is to successfully open an exit gate and leave that way.  Unless they have opposite map door spawns you're pretty much gonna interrupt them at a handle 90% of the time.  Also if you're both standing on the hatch before it opens and spamming your buttons the killers close will always take precedence over their jump animation.
---
me too, took a long time before they started appearing
---
Because if we don't protect the baby Dwights, who will?
---
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
---
That sounds like such a better system, the shear fact that you can close the hatch is such a massive buff I love it.
---
You really compared Adam to Etika just because they‚Äôre black and have flat-tops.
---
Its not supposed to be an advantage, just something like second chance or something like that
---
Also forgot to mention the anti BM timer.  When the hatch is closed EGC begins and they have a timer that forces them to leave the map or die automatically.  2 minutes I believe.  So they can't just hide against you until you dc anymore lol.
---
Two builds, I usually try and stick to gens, but I also have a build which is just to get tunneled:
---
Object of Obsession, Windows of Opportunity, Dead hard, Adrenaline
---
 Dead hard and adrenaline are my staples in almost every build, but with the DH bug I am using balanced landing more. Windows and object could be replaced with Bond so I don‚Äôt interrupt gens, and Iron will to help in chases. This build is hard to run in solo q because people don‚Äôt seem to have M1 on their mice, but in a swf you can guarantee gen progress
---
The other gimmicky builds are Lithe, DWM, QQ, Iron will, and once I get head on, I will use Adrenaline, Head on, QQ, and some other perk. Also playing immersed all as p3 Claudettes in a swf can be fun, all run Urban Immersion, Iron will and any stealth perks, QQ, featherweight, sprint burst, also PEBBLE PLAYS!!!
---
duh, you just, uh, like, uhm, huh, i think you just, uh, hmm, let me look this up, oh that‚Äôs right you just-, oh wait that doesn‚Äôt work so you just gotta uhhhhhhh
---
Or maybe he's someone who realizes that a free third hit for doing fuck all was laughably overpowered.
---
You know, just like the devs did.
---
gotta buy DLC
---
It really is.  Survivors kinda get the short end of the stick now but it's kind of worth it to abolish the horrid hatch standoff system previously.
---
No... they dont. Stealth killers dont... hence why they're different...  Play who you want to play, you're right, the game is just for fun. Doesnt change the fa t that in the end, every killer besides stealth killers is a weaker version of Billy, Spirit, or Nurse. Doesnt mean you cant play them. Doesnt mean you cant 4k with them. It's just how the game mechanics work
---
What exactly is a 4K? I‚Äôm a scrub, is that just where you get at least 4K bloodpoints in all categories or?
---
Killers can now close hatch, but cant grab survivors while they jump In.
---
My prediction is Pinhead. Not based off of evidence or anything, I just have a feeling.
---
Have you tried to get a Survivor immediately broken with Vile Purge? I don‚Äôt know about PC but on console because of the sensitivity it‚Äôs not too easy, you‚Äôre not just following a bot Survivor who‚Äôs running in a straight line. 
---
There‚Äôs a slow down when charging, holding and releasing Vile Purge as well as a slow down for the cool down. Most high rank Survivors will loop around the nearest object and make it difficult to get the full spray on them... and God forbid they‚Äôre at a pallet loop/jungle gym. 
---
With Corrupt Purge you can quick fire two short bursts or shoot over/between objects to get them down, ending pallet loops very quickly. You can also pressure unhooks and multiple Survivors on gens as one spray can injure them all. If you‚Äôre good at aiming it you can also shoot it from a distance at gens to try and hit them.
---
i mean they don‚Äôt, but they help end chases.also, the fact that you include myers is odd, unless you run scratched mirror i woudnt really call him a stealthy killer
---
Well, you've 100% convinced me  to try the game again, It'l be weird with all the new killers but i'm excited to try out Ghost Fast and Clown lad :p
---
This is very clever use of this template with meg wow
---
I don‚Äôt even use Selfcare it‚Äôs a horrible fucking perk lul. I just don‚Äôt like Dc it‚Äôs fucking stupid.
---
Completing gens to show the hatch is supposed to be survivor favored because its a reward for doing the objective
---
Happy to help the game is way less frustrating for killer now if you know what you're doing.  Enjoy and good luck
---
You are really good you should make all the killers In dbd and maybe become an artist.
---
As rank 12 killer, I can tell you that's not true.
---
He starts out as one. If not that, I dont know what to categorize him under. He has instadown so he isnt m1. He has stealth at first, hes an odd one
---
Sometimes, even though it could move along the web, it decides to go somewhere in its own circle and not along the web. Idk why
---
Only if you run both effectiveness add ons
---
Can you hit us up with a download link when you're finished? ;\^)
---
i would call him m1
---
Overwhelming presence intensifies
---
I csnt fight you on that. Hes to diverse me to use any solid arguments in any direction
---
If the devs can do it, they will do it.
---
If they can't they won't.
---
Rank doesn't matter too much, and I've been at red ranks of killer for months. 
---
Just because bloodlust isn't an efficient way to spend time, the fact that you can use the handholding mechanic to cheese a loop instead of kicking the pallet is a problem in the game.
---
It would be pretty intimidating. :0
---
yes
---
I believe that ghostface needs to be buffed. He's my main and if I can't do that as him too, this game cannot be as praised as it should be.
---
really? people past rank 20 say looping is toxic? and new DS?
---
also, if so, it‚Äôs still ‚Äúunenforcible‚Äù. if you are playing killer, and is post game chat, start complaining about insta heal or something, you‚Äôve got 4 people ganging up on you and no one on your side, vs if you are playing survivor and complain about NOED, for example, in postgame chat you‚Äôve got 3 people with you and one against you. that‚Äôs why the rule book for survivors hardly exists
---
As others have said, it is mostly on you, but I feel it would also be with your perks. STBFL, MYC, Enduring, Brutal, and Bamboozle all work really well on clown. Though I am not a clown main, there is some things to note, if a survivor is intoxicated then it will force a medium vault, which if you know the hit box for a medium vault is hugeeeeeee. Also when intoxicated the survivors will drop pallets fast making him amazing at shutting down loops, also when they are slowed and their vision is blurred, they will panic so mind games will work more than usual. Also his toss looks overhand, but it seems underhand. And the biggest tip of all is to throw the bottle at the highest point. If there is a tree, you can throw it up to it and the gas will spread all around the loop. My final tip is to watch Fungoose, he is an amazing clown main, and he is possibly the best i‚Äôve yet to see.
---
I browse with one hand and do skill checks with thr other. Only ones that really get me are the damn skill check as soon as I get off the gen.
---
I was hoping for something like that when Legion was teased. Heck, even Legion's initial promo video hinted at hiding as a survivor. :|
---
https://youtu.be/459gZie0kLI
---
I didn't say not running around the map to see the pallets is a mistake, "my dude". You did. Stop trying to put words in my mouth. My point is that survivors should try to remember what pallets are already spawned and *where* pallets can spawn, to try to figure out which pallets are real or not. 
---
WoO and Small Game are good counters to Freddy's pallets, so what's your point? If you want a guaranteed counter, you should have to give up a perk slot for it, anyway.
---
The dream pallets should be a threat. Period.
---
Yeah I always go against spirits on Xbox never nurses really.
---
The strong must protect the Dweet
---
A 4K is where you get 4 kills in a single match OR the tota amount of BP earned overall for that match (such as a 32K; 8K BP in all categories). In this instance, it refers to the 4 kills.
---
OHHH that makes sense, thank you!!
---
I've been running the second build personally and I had 8 perfect (32k) point in a row with it.  It's really strong, even in red ranks.
---
Damn that means most of this sub are rank 20s then.
---
I completely agree with you on these points honestly, not much to say about that. :)
---
This happened to me the other day.  It was awesome.  /s
---
Yes it is correct, since the devs don't want survivors to feel truly safe at any point in the match. Pallets are *not* meant to be infallible safe zones.
---
And how is that a problem? Freddy punishes that behaviour, it's part of what he does now.
---
sad clown is sad.
---
*Laughs in Enduring+Spirit Fury*
---
I didn't realize Dead Hard was bugged. Oh well, I'll give it a go after it's fixed! In the meantime, does anyone have an underrated perk I should use on my David? I'm running a gen-rush No Mither build, I'll let you know if I've unlocked the perk you suggest and try it.
---
Which part of "obviously it was op and need a change" in my comment made you think I thought it was balanced?
---
Wow, he couldn't catch you while looping? Toxic survivor /s
---
But escaping by the hatch means that the survivors failed their objective (or someone has a key/waited for everyone else to leave).
---
If you don't find the hatch before you're the last remaining survivor, or don't think you can get there before the killer, the best play is to go to an exit gate. When they close the hatch, you'll have a head start on the gate. If they don't close the hatch and they are standing on it, pop a gen.
---
It isn't a load of crap. Pallet spawn can be memorized just like totems can. And you can't take the time to briefly glance around you to look for pallets as you run for a save?
---
And at this point you seem like you're just playing dumb. Double pallets aren't anywhere near as much of a thing anymore, outside of rare instances where the game still spawns them. On top of that, what's so bad about Freddy actually making that loop risky? You just sound mad there's no guaranteed counter.
---
He has no map control like Billy, he wouldn't be op, theres nothing wrong with him being able to use his say easier
---
Beautiful work! The level of detail is amazing. 
---
I'd love to see the Plague &lt;3

---
Very well made art!! Got me hyped for a second though, did you have an idea who this was supposed to represent?
---
Damn Freddys rework really does make a difference
---
I'd argue Killer's is more enforcable, as he has a handy tool called "camping".
---
&gt; None of the killers is non-viable 
---
Proof of either inexperience or side bias right there. Certainly explains why you think Freddy needs a nerf when he doesn't.
---
0.4m is a respectable distance. It's roughly the width of a survivor. I have literally seen hatchets go between survivors legs without hitting them during the fast vault animation. I seen hatchets blocked by hitting pallets midway through the animation of them being dropped. The hitboxes seem to be pretty good when it's a solid connection.
---
The need to remove her collision while phasing and they need to remove literally all of her purple add-ons. A Spirit with green add-ons can be played against. A Spirit with purple add-ons cannot. By default her ability is still great, but much like the Nurse, it only really becomes a problem after add-ons are factored in.
---
Servers? Dude, we need to talk.

Watching Freddy isn't the only way to know where he puts fake pallets.
---
Nice. I can never hit purple ranks as survivor, only as killer. Keep it up, you‚Äôll be in red rank before you know it.
---
That‚Äôs such a cunt move
---
What does it do now?
---
That is very true, with the range she has already, the ability to insta-down it is pretty filthy.

I liked it till you said go outside everything else is fine but fuck you on that last part

---

---
Horrible play, don‚Äôt do that unless you have Borrowed Time or you know the other guy has Decisive.
---
Maybe I will after I play my level 5 Trapper for the daily and face a 4man squad
---
Dude this is fucking crazy, you're soo talented
---
I dont understand what you're trying to say and how it relates to what i said
---
prayer beads on the spirit, makes that VSSHHHHH sound not happen. that being said, i play spirit. a lot. like. a LOT. and its always fun to get salty messages from survs bc i used the beads
---
I would actually recommend it with swf on higher ranks because slugging is a very useful tool to add map pressure when your a weaker killer.
---
Accidentally responded to the wrong chain. So your saying that the hatch should only be visible to survivors right? If that were the case it would be next to impossible for Killers to get a 4K. The whole point of the Hatch is a last ditch effort.
---
I can't wait to see more from you. I'm a Billy main so this really resonated with me, but I'm sure I'll love all future drawings presented. Thanks so much for your hard work and for sharing with us!
---
I got it on m4 so I can scratch my nose all day long
---
Prayer beads on spirit and scratched mirror Myers on the game or asylum maps
---
Lol you‚Äôre alright. Have a good day!
---
No problem lol. When I play killer I mainly play Spirit, tho I feel she is a bit unfair, as she isn‚Äôt really punished for failing her mind games, she can just try again in a few seconds. Unless you have Iron Will, good luck with her...
---
They did get a 4k but they were on xbox lol
---
Yup
---
If you were on ps4 it might have been me i just got evil incarnate recently against somewhat potatoes survivors.  (Normally you dont get EW3 before any gens are done so i guess tier one ruon did it's job)
---
Those smaller maps and those add ons spell disaster for survivors. Pure filth.
---
Who won, or did you just do a custom match for the memes?
---
In my eyes, noed is an easy counter. If they are a killer who would probably have noed (playing bad or just a general bad killer to use), then deal with totems. At least four so the fifth is easy to reach.
---
Adrenaline can be annoying, but honestly much of the time is doesn't get much use. For it to be max effective, the person using it has to be in a chase already injured.
---
That‚Äôs upvote from me, nice job
---
Your friend is right. SWF is bad and you should feel bad.
---
Okay so how does anything you say have anything to do with being able to have an indicator of her movements so you can attempt to counter-play? Because that's the entire purpose of this thread and you're saying things everyone already knows.
---
Ruin is basically a gen deterrent for potato survivors. JuSt HiT thOsE grEAt SkiLl ChEcks lol
---
Cursed but very good job
---
Disagreed, the entirety of her ability is pretty uncounterable because the survivors have nothing at their disposal against her, add-ons or otherwise.
---
I guess I‚Äôm the only one here who has literally never been jumpscared by a wraith. Even with that add on that makes his bell silent it‚Äôs so hard to miss his gigantic lanky silhouette moving through the tall corn. Lmfao
---
All we need is Jason, and there is no other horror icon that either fits, or is worth paying to license.
---
I'm more looking forward to cool original characters though.
---
BIG BRAIN
---
I already have Resilience, as well as This is Not Happening. Prove Thyself sounds perfect though, I'll be flying through gens. I just need to level up Dwight.
---
Adrenaline is not the equivalent of NOED because you actually have to work for it unlike NOED
---
Bro that is what I'm saying lol If it's in the game, its a part of the game, so just play the dam game xD
---
Im almost a devotion level and i still only hit great skill checks if im lucky, its actually kind of hard, then yoy see streamers like No0b3 (when he's acrually on a gen) and monto hitting them every time.
---
What's more important kills or pips?
---
whenever I play survivor I always play as if Adrenaline and Noed were just a part of everyone's base kit
---
Procreate
---
gfuel of course
---
Billy with primer bulb + ruin + noed. And at rank 14 too
---
You must be extremely insecure about your ability to kill
---
You have a better chance of getting the hatch if there are more than 3 gens left instead of 2 gens left or less. Just let that sink in. Does that make a lot of sense to have a lesser chance of escaping if your team gets completely destroyed instead of being competitive and getting close to victory?
---
Basically you just run, you can loop him two more times on each loop than you could normally, so it's pretty weak. Also you can stay in lockers and he can't mori you but that's very toxic.

---
Just make it to were you need to get safe unhooks and/or protection hits, problem solved.
---
But at the same time, noed can be 100% countered and never get used in the match. As long as gens get done, adren will activate even if the survivor has exhaustion effect at the time.
---
Also not asking to nerf adren or saying it's op, I'm sticking with both perks being fine.
---
Thats When Nea was Moried and followed up by a ban for removing props in a trail
---
Do you understand what the word viable means?
---
The only add-on that is really unbalanced is prayer beads and range/blink nurse. They have no counterplay at all. Iri head is strong but at least you can still avoid hatchets
---
I agree, he did have some good plays and Dumbish survivors, but overkill on his build.  Personally I‚Äôd use tinkerer instead of NOED, billy is one of the few that makes that perk
---
The hatch doesn't even spawn until one more gen is completed than the number of alive survivors (unless you are the last one then it spawns no matter what).  The hatch doesn't appear so the survivor has a reward for doing the objective, it appears for survivors with a key to escape through and while it's beneficial for a killer to find the hatch before it's open it works vise versa too.  The hatch is a last ditch effort, and once it's closed you can open a gate.  If the hatch spawns before your the last one either it's a close game pr you and your team aren't doing your job good enough
---
So your argument is that hatch isn‚Äôt survivor sided enough, and that it‚Äôs stupid that the game gives you a better chance at escaping the less gems you do, even tho your arguing for it to be easier for survivor?
---
The hatch is NOT an ‚Äúaward‚Äù for doing the generators. If your entire team is destroyed then the game is slightly more forgiving and you have a better chance at surviving... I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre complaining about that. 
---
Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm solo queing. My entire team is annihilated due to their stupidity. Is it a bad thing that I have a better chance at surviving? No, I don‚Äôt think it is
---
Exposed sound sucks so bad on Michael
---
Clown can use them in the middle of the loop too, but he still slows down so that he can't just throw them mindlessly.
---
That‚Äôs exactly hat I did the moment I finished the skins. Although, lingering potions are better because they, well... linger like the Afterpiece Tonic.
---
Did he change perk skins?
---
as a noob player, never saw tapp, so i didn't included it
---
Very true, but I guess it's due to also how strong the base killer is.

I dont see a lot of ppl complementing you lol good job! \0/ I thought for sure he was gonna dc XD! Just need to chase after someone else if u can‚Äôt get a survivor in under 45 secs &gt;_&gt;

That‚Äôs good! I think most of my characters have borrowed time and unbreakable. I just want him as like my checklist of collecting everything and everyone. I have every killer and survivor at level 50 already. I have 900,000+ bloodpoints and 8,000+ shards waiting to go into Bill to level him up to be compete.
---
He doesn't go faster in tier 3, he can just go through windows faster and has a longer lunge but that's it. Just use loops that are high enough for him not to stalk you and since he's slower with the tombstone you can loop him for a while when he tries to feel up his Evil Within. And he needs to stalk 3 survivors entirely I believe to go from EW1 to EW3 with tombstone and tuft of hair.
---
Lol SWF is only aids when it's a group of assholes who think they're pros at the game and t-bag at every pallet,  when it's a group who uses their low-rank survivor buddies to get baby killers and boost their rank, or when it's a group who DC's immediately when one person is downed.
---
Otherwise, SWF groups really aren't all that bad. Strong, yes, but not aids.
---
I‚Äôm not here to say either perk is this or that- but asking anyone who isn‚Äôt 3 or 4 man swf to ‚Äújust do totems‚Äù while keeping track of ones you break and already broken ones on top of balancing gens because so many people already don‚Äôt do gens is a little unfair. I‚Äôd love some Totem UI. It‚Äôd make games even a little bit longer by encouraging more breaking anyway even if there wasn‚Äôt noed.
---
Exactly. Make it deactivate after someone else is hooked
---
I actually agree with you in some ways, and think that people are misunderstanding your point.
---
To everyone else: /u/XtremeCSGO isn't saying that the hatch should be more advantaged to survivors. What they're saying is, why does the hatch appear visible when X-many gens are completed?
---
If only two survivors are left alive, the closed hatch will be visible when they complete three generators. In the past, this was a tiny 'reward' for completing enough gens, since the survivors could memorize the hatch's location and go there if they were the last survivor alive.
---
Nowadays though, this is a 'punishment'. There's far less advantage to knowing where the closed hatch is. This puts the two survivors in a *worse* position for completing 3 gens than if they had completed 0 generators: At least then, both they and the killer would be blindly looking for the hatch and it would come down to luck for whoever found it first.
---
Try fortnite, I feel like *you* might find it quite fun!
---
It's a neat idea but I could tunnel and slug anyways, this basically buffs killers and they can ignore the mechanic entirely. Tunneling is a core part of the game, there's two big problems.
---
1) Unhooked can be 1 shot OR 2 shot with a timer
---
2) Hooked survivor will sometimes have no resources, like exhausted or balanced landing or simply hooked where no palettes exist.
---
There needs to be counterplay for example letting survivors drop down and arm a trap to stall the killer. Survivors need secondary objectives so the killer has multiple things to stall out, like what if there was 3 switches you could pull and they opened a hatch with an item that can be placed near hooked survivors. 
---
Tunneling is not a killer problem, it's not a problem that should be solved by adjusting how killers play, killers will just go for the easiest target. This is something that needs to be fixed on the survivor side, tools and perks to protect unhooked. 
---
One idea I had was WGLF: a non exhaustion perk that will let you take another survivors hit, giving both of you the dash as long as you are close to the survivor. Get bonus BP on safe unhooks and protection hits. Taking hits for survivors counts. 
---
Boom now survivors are given a tool to protect and rewarded for it. 
---
DS is also a self BT but its kind of garbage right now, it should be both 60 seconds AND timer is stalled when in the killers radius, or just remove the obsession altogether.
---
Thank you so much. You don‚Äôt know how much this helped!!!
---
Me: *takes a sip of water*
---
skillcheck: "**im about to end this man's whole carrer**"
---
What grind? Lol
---
&gt; and that it‚Äôs stupid that the game gives you a better chance at escaping the less gems you do
---
I think this is a valid complaint. It shouldn't be easier for the survivor to get the hatch in general, but I think it should be easier (or at least should not be harder) for a survivor whose team completed 4 gens to get the hatch compared to a survivor whose team completed 0 gens.
---
I can finally play Jeff and still be successful.
---
Monitor and Abuse? That used to be an excellent perk on Old Freddy as Old Freddy had a smaller TR (24 meters?) which was made shorter with M&amp;A, and survivors who are sleeping outside the TR have their aura revealed. 
---
New Freddy, not so much. No aura reveal, and frustratingly sleeping survivors hear the lullaby instead of the TR, which isn't affected by perks making it a debatable pick.
---
Discordance was always good on Old Freddy to kickstart your match. Might be good on New Freddy.
---
My current Freddy build is BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Pop Goes The Weasel. Enduring+Spirit Fury is a decent M1 killer combo and allows you to chew through pallets (Very important if you're Pallet Freddy) while BBQ and Pop allow you to pressure gens after hooking.
---
My only problem is the scratch marks and audio is fucked up int he dream world, making is difficult to keep momentum going and chases engaged.
---
She's the only character who requires that and makes Urban Evasion a viable perk. Besides it's more fun to go up against a killer who requires a different play style and strategy rather than using the same strategy for every other killer.
---
Billy is my main, this look fantastic!
---
Can you post those skins somewhere so they can be downloaded?
---
Ghostface's real power imo is that he has no terror radius.  Activate your ability mid chance after a break in line of sight and you can psyche out the survivors.  It's way harder to juke a killer if you can't see his red stain and know which direction he is coming from.
---
As for sneaky stalking I usually only try from an elevated position, like a hill or the boat in swamp, or near generators.  You're unlikely to find people just out and about while stalking.  They're more likely to be found at gens.  Also at a gen is basically the only time you can stalk right next to the survivor because the gen hides the sound of you moving around.
---
If the survivor isn't careful you can get a full stalk off mid chase like you would with michael myers.  Practice leaning around corners mid chase because you're harder to break out of stealth and you stalk way faster.
---
I had one the other night where the skill check popped up but the gen competed but it still went off as though I messed it up.
---
I was practically on the edge of my seat during the entire video! Jesus Christ lol!
---
That last minute sabo before you hopped over the pallet just about gave me an anxiety attack. Too damn close! üòÇ
---
Go away.
---
Lol I got lucky. All of my friends bought DBD to play with me, since I bought it for the head our Discord. Usually if he gets into a multiplayer game, everyone will. This was back in January.
---
Fast forward to now, and he's the only one who continues to play it with me on PC. (I have two buddies who play with me on PS4). But he'll only play Survivor if we're in a SWF group. Otherwise, it's Trapper, all day, every day.
---
Ah a fellow man of culture I see
---
I'm scared
---
Jason Voorhees is the last licensed killer that I truly want. I know that it is unfortunately unlikely due to the lawsuit, but I feel as though he is the last huge slasher icon that we're missing. Wishful thinking that BHVR is one day able to add him in.
---
Why is this so relatable?
---
Yeah, you are right about parkour
---
Yeah, how dare a company have Licensing Issues slowing down your free character being added.
---
Shame on them.
---
Hello there, generally rank 15 survivor here. Freddy's not OP. I find it pretty fun to go against and when I tried it out it was also fun to play as.
---
Because, if you have an indicator of her movements, she can't mindgame, so she'd be better off just chasing with her 4.4 and her passive phasing.
---
I might not be explaining my perspective clearly, so let me try to rephrase just in case:
---
A survivor should not be rewarded for being the last survivor alive (I think we agree on this).
---
As things are now, if there's only one survivor left alive, they have a better chance of escaping if 0 gens are done (the hatch spawns randomly, and the survivor escapes if they find it before the killer) than if 3-4 gens are done (the closed hatch is already visible on the map, so the killer will be able to reach it first if they've seen it at any point by now).
---
Thank you for the sensible advice, /u/penis-muncher785
---
What does a person‚Äôs social life have to do with his or her opinion of something in a video game?
---
Adrenaline isn‚Äôt bad and isn‚Äôt overpowered because you have complete all the gens to get it which isn‚Äôt an easy feat, while NOED is rewarded by the killer failing to do his job
---
no problem glad to help
---
Definitely was it was during a chase and he smack him right as soon as I got him off. Is there a cool down I‚Äôm missing?
---
Not sure what tier bt you have, but perhaps the time just ticked down before they were hit? Otherwise, if the killer is a stealth killer and is able to hide their heartbeat while you unhook, then bt wouldn't be activated. Do you remember the killer?
---
i need a hero is the worst on this list by far. literally a free instaheal for two people with no drawbacks? how is that "not too bad"?
---
Even if he finds it first, what then? There are still the gates, I don‚Äôt even get what are you crying about.
---
We want Jason now Behavior
---
Pretty happy because I was able to get cosmetics for some of my killers and my main survivor yesterday!  Pretty happy with how they all look for the most part, also got Piggy yesterday!
---
Hoping to get more outfits for some of my other survivors since I'm gonna try to not stick to one survivor the whole time I play this game.
---
Try iron will
---
Tier 3 and against the hillbilly. Maybe it was too soon after I unhooked someone else ?
---
It‚Äôs only once per game. It can be crazy good but most of the time all its going to be doing is saving some time.
---
perfect instaheal use, hopping right into the locker then getting grabbed lmao.
---
Blame the straights for downvoting m/m gay art into oblivion but gay w/w and m/w art the top posts of all time
---
I disagree, adrenaline rewards the survivor for succeeding while noed rewards the killer for failing
---
Finding it first (even closed) is an advantage for survivor as well though.
---
So you just have to be 10 meters away from Hag and Spirit to literally never have them catch up to you. Yea totally not broken at all.
---
and what about the situations where someone just dive bombs the hook? this perk would literally reward bad plays, even more than bt or ds already do
---
Yeah bbq and chili is particularly strong on Freddy lol I always expect it
---
is it possible that he had Tinkerer and he lost his terror radius?
---
;)
---
The chance of opening a gate is pretty low. Impossible if the RNG of the map doesnt give much for sight blockers so the killer can just walk back and forth in between the two doors
---
I have never fallen for that mindgame a single day in my life. It's also completely ruined by spine chill.
---
Me and a friend tested it, he called me put perfectly everytime.
---
No it literally isn't, when awake dream pallets don't exist. Use some logic here.
---
Ideed, they are not skill based. Every killer ability is to test surv's ability, but if it isn't skill based, like fake pallets or like spirit's phase, it rewards the killer for nothing. If you are a good killer, you definitely deserve to win and you will win, but it sucks when the killer player wins THANKS to his character's ability, and not to his skill. Please note that things i said are completely different from the balance, they are about competitiveness and player's fun while playing. 
---
Examples of skill based killers ability for reference:
---
Nurse's blinks (excluding range addons and addons for more blinks);
---
Huntress hatchets;
---
Hag traps;
---
Freddy snares;
---
And some others
---
&gt;em'
---
emth
---
Even if she can hear you window vault, she can't window vault while phasing or destroying pallets.
---
I beat a team of rank 4s last night. Luckily they never found Ruin or I'd been boned. The mind game wins probably helped too. They got through 3 gens with Ruin still up, so they weren't boosted.  Freddy is mid tier at best, but he needs Ruin and other gen slowing perks and add-ons to keep his grasp.
---
"Mom said it's my turn to repost this"
---
Yeah, I think this is probably my signature move--almost doing something awesome and then failing miserably.
---
Yeah but Adrenaline last 3 seconds. NOED last 0 seconds or for the whole match. They can't quite be compared
---
I like this :)
---
Can he only throw potions of slow plz
---
I usually get to green ranks for Survivor before reset. I  go farther for Killer but that's because I don't find Killer to be boring after a while. And I don't have to worry about idiot teammates and running into the same Hillbilly every game.
---
I'm not the best at him, but I think I know a good amount at this point. Still have a lot to learn, though
---
1: Be aware of your maps. Certain maps have broken spots to stalk, such as the Thompson House in between the boards, and I think it's called Ironworks of Misery (Whichever one has that main building with the upstairs section). Some maps are insanely good for stalking. Other such as The Game and imo Lery's aren't that good for him because of how easy it is to break sight (Lery's is ok because at least there's a lot of places to hide)
---
2: 99% if you're far. You do not want to fully mark them when they're halfway across the map. 99% them, be stealthy, get close, finish the stalk and insta down
---
3: Crouching is pretty solid for certain loops and mind games during the chase
---
Russian Roulette Spirit, where you turn the main objective into totem hunting or you turn into perkless Spirit 5 minutes into the match, so much fun to play against really.
---
Because it's bull. I had situations when I went for another survivor, then patrol, survivor I hooked ran into me, and DS out of nowhere. You don't have to tunnel to feel the BS.
---
They are not the same as I've said. Doesn't make either of them bad or OP.
---
Precisely
---
this is why I have interact bound to right mouse and skillcheck bound to left mouse
---
Summer sucks winter/fall for life
---
I hate that I was born in summer ree
---
That‚Äôll never happen. I blame Sean Cunningham
---
But he doesn‚Äôt have any kind of edgy mask, that most ‚Äûevil clowns‚Äú have.
---
Summer is the worst season ever. I often feel like I'm melting.
---
I told your son to ask you to do The Legion or Michael Myers, can you draw one of them please? They are my favorites. And great work on drawing, It looks better framed
---
Thanks.
---
probably a baby nurse from quitting so long ago
---
Actually, its impossible to describe this game in fewer words. It has everything. It has toxic and it has grind. And thats about it.
---
Did he have tinkerer?
---
YES oh yes you are awesome at this please do the nurse next
---
my friend told be the best strat is to pull all the pallets down when youcsee them so you can just slide over them in a chase and the killer has to break them..
---
literally every single perk is immensely powerful and s tier.
---
so what you are saying is that it isnt a problem with the perk, but instead a problem with the killer?
---
Doctor with BBQ and Iron Maiden: *"I'm about to end this man's whole career"*
---
Or you can play both and realize there are balance issues on both sides.
---
I know right it‚Äôs not like killers complain about SWF or what perks they are running...
---
I find it pretty easy
---
Literally my strategy in rank 20. Run, throw it down, keep running, find another, throw it down. I don‚Äôt even understand.
---
Sadly, they do. Lots of " kys for looping" on ps4.
---
I'm starting to get tired of people posting their post-game chat, it's not very neat
---
Prayer Beads, Iri head with Infantry Belt (3 hatchets + Insta down), Omega Blink, Insta saw Billy (Primer and Tuning Guide)
---
I maina killer i have no complaints you win you lose ya know what I mean.
---
Good players don't use NOED because they don't need to. Only insecure players use NOED. I talk for my experience. When I play Billy I feel safe and never play with NOED, however when I play Clown for example, I suck playing him so I always bring NOED at least to secure a kill.
---
First of all I really like the art and I like that you went above and beyond to add the colored text like the real perks.
---
&gt;Parkour
---
The increased vaulting speed is fine, but making it so you cant take damage is too much. It would make certain loops and even maps (Lery's) way too difficult for any killer to succeed with. I would revise it to keep the speed boost but make it so that if you're injured and get hit while vaulting you'll get the deep wounds status effect and have 10 seconds to heal.
---
&gt;Explorer
---
This would arguably be the strongest perk in the game on either side if added as is. If this stacks with urban evasion then Neas would be zooming around the map at light speed. The increased running speed is just the cherry on top. I would revise to make it so that it when you complete a gen, you get a 3/5/7% bonus to generator repair speed on your next generator as long as it's more than 50 meters away from the last one. That fits with the "explorer" theme right?
---
&gt;Can't Stop
---
Feels very similar to sprint burst. I'd revise it to this: Gain a 4/7/10% bonus to repair/search/heal/opening/sabotaging speeds when killer is within 5 meters. Removes the ability to get grabbed while in full health. I think this would actually be pretty popular as a counter to Spirit's Prayer Beads and T1 Myers.
---
&gt;I Need a Hero
---
This is another perk that may be too strong. If an injured survivor saved a companion, they could bodyblock for their teammate and suffer no penalty compared to where they were 15 seconds ago. Making it deactivate after one use is pretty good but I'd be concerned about a SWF team all running this. Idk how to revise it exactly, I think Borrowed Time covers most of what you want here.
---
Boi both as a killer and survivor, I love the new DS, before it felt unfair as a killer to be stabbed and it was just a get-out-of-jail for a survivor with no real meaning but NOW if you stab that biscuit you do it because he tunneled you, and for that you will strike back, it feels so amazing
---
I know  what you mean it‚Äôs just this post goes both ways
---
You aren't wrong buckaroo, but idk this guy was just being weird. This is my last one though
---
Not if you party play you got coms to play as roght survivor as based on team you do really well
---
oh the totem wasn't ruin it was haunted grounds instead which is 1 minute of exposed haha
---
around nov december is when dedicated servers go live
---
"Thanks for kicking that for me buddy"
---
I love playing dbd in an aeroplane
---
Yea but out of both I see more survivors complain then I do killers and I also see more wins for survivor then killer
---
Just we opened up the game thinking it was an easy ruin totem to find
---
How do you get it
---
Bought this for my best friend when it was on sale and we both got addicted. Then my brother kept clowning me, "I don't know why you play this game all the time" etc. DBD went on sale again and guess whose bitch ass just texted me 5 minutes ago wanting to play?
---
I‚Äôm  honestly shocked she didn‚Äôt even bother to check the locker, but good job getting the flashlight blind off
---
Adrenaline rewards good gameplay
---
NOED rewards bad gameplay and negates adrenaline
---
Ash, of course. He did it groovily.
---
Im sorry but you‚Äôre wrong. I don‚Äôt need to impose rules on you for you to be toxic to me. I‚Äôve got pages and pages of unsolicited hateful messages from survivors. That‚Äôs them being toxic.
---
That's bonkers.. how did they not see that?!?!
---
*Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash.* This is a sequel to *Freddy vs. Jason* movie.  But the comic also has a sequel called *The Nightmare Warriors.*
---
You have idiots saying 'it goes both ways lulz' yet it's very rare I hear a killer complain about something stupid like genrushing, yet EVERY game I play as killer I get some clown who's crying about tunneling, my killer, perks, or that I'm a wallhacker.
---
I heard BHVR is going balls deep on that survivor dick and is preparing to nerf Nurse, it's only a matter of time before they gut the rest of the viable killers, and then durrvivors will only have queue times to bitch about.
---
I was playing killer and I had a 3k and was about to hook the 4th but they quickly invited me to a party,  so I joined and they asked me to give them hatch cause it was one of their first few games, (the survivors were all friends) and I gave her the hatch and we all talked for a while and I gained 4 new friends from it so that was fun.
---
Technically that‚Äôs true, but you could get hit early on and do nothing for your team to start. Unlikely though. But survivors can counter NOED like any hex, the effect is too strong that you are given a chance for the killer to risk a whole perk slot. Even if you don‚Äôt find the totem early game you can still find it late game if needed. It‚Äôs not OP as it can be wasted in minutes, it‚Äôs just not hard to use.       
---
      
---
  But then same surely applies to decisive strike. DSing the killer means you‚Äôve been hooked, which as a survivor is what you are supposed to avoid, so surely in a way, like noed, you are getting given a second chance to redeem yourself, yes they‚Äôre different scenarios but both reward, not bad, but less effective gameplay strategy, and are used as a back up for worst case scenarios. I‚Äôll admit NOED can be used more as a crutch for killers as they‚Äôre already more powerful, but in certain games it‚Äôs completely fair, and if survives haven‚Äôt been cleansing totems they are mostly to blame.
---
Using that logic, waiting in a locker all game while the other survivors do all the gens is good gameplay.  
---
As I've said, both perks are fine and don't need changes.
---
Look, I‚Äôm not here to judge your play style, but if you really are going for bloodpoints then killing everyone this quickly isn‚Äôt a great idea. Yeah, you won, but this game is shorter than most of my killer queues. I find it hard to believe that you got more than 20k bp (before bbq stacks).
---
It shouldn‚Äôt. The Killer should never be punished for doing a smart play. I think DS should deactivate if the Survivor performs an action like repairing a gen or entering a locker or the Killer downs another Survivor.
---
Ash is awesome in any dimension, :3
---
he played that like a complete and total 4head. correct course of action wouldve been trap her, grab you, eat ds, fake picking other jane up to.lure you into trying to save, hook you, then hook jane. you got very lucky
---
Wat?
---
It's just a game.
---
Welcome to summer break on dbd
---
Oh maybe I‚Äôm not sure but if that‚Äôs what it was it makes sense
---
Ah yes they once fixed that by the way and reintroduced it for some reason
---
Pretty much and then boom game no llonger has a fan base lol
---
Yeah not sure but if that‚Äôs the case then that would do it
---
Good story. Hope you stepped away from your PC before you smashed your keyboard.
---
Having even one player sit in a locker the whole game nearly always guarantees all the gens don't get popped.
---
Play with a group choose survivors that work well together then boom you will do better whatvwas so hard to comprehend.
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right, everyone is.thanks for helping guys, i will revise it and post again soon
---
You have to buy the full DLC in the PS/Xbox/Steam store.
---
Yeah! Do you see anonymous scrolling the comments right now?! He mentioned my comment! And you're welcome hahahahahaha
---
Nah, I'm not wrong. Just going off this sub, purple flashlights, ds, instaheals, swf,  and teabagging are what makes survivors toxic.
---
If you are complaining about something that isn't cheating, an exploit, or post-chat abuse, then you are indeed making up rules.
---
Nerf nurse to make her more playable or nerf nurse to not make her as deadly? Nurse is only as good as the player behind her. She's awful in the hands of a shit player it's not like she's some OP killer that takes literally no skill to completely steamroll your way to a 4K.
---
This glitch happens sometimes. I‚Äôm pretty sure it is supposed to say 7 minutes.
---
No movement speed reduction and reworked like Billy‚Äôs. No more 99% then lose your rev
---
Don't be like that. You did just fine.
---
It was a flat-out, uncounterable extra health state against M1 killers and WIDENED the gap between "top tier M2 killers" (Huntress, Billy, in a way Trapper, Leatherface) or killers that had instadowns (Myers and sort of in a way Plague, Leatherface although they're not all top-tier) vs everyone else. (Doctor, Freddy, Clown, Wraith, Trapper outside of traps, Hag, Spirit, Nurse although a good nurse won't be affected too much by an extra hit) 
---
It was annoying by itself as unlike old DS there was no "Penalty" to using it as a non-obsession meaning a 4-man SWF can all run it for that free extra hit. 
---
A "McLoopyPants" (Survivor build or playstyle involving intentionally getting the killer's attention and then wasting the killer's time as long as possible while annoying the shit out of him to ensure he doesn't break the chase and thus is looped for 5 gens) could combo MoM with perks like Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Deliverance, etc. with an instaheal and holy shit M1 killers suffered.
---
Go to hit, you hit him. Try to hit again, and he either uses his instaheal or dead hard. You hit him again, and he dead hards/instaheals (Depending on what he didn't do the first time.) 
---
You finally down the fucker, and hook him. He yeets off the hook with deliverance right in front of your face. You continue chasing him, go to hit him again as he's looping, and he dead hards once again. Finally you land that hit on him, but Mettle Of Man blocks it! Eventually you down him, but he hits decisive strike. The entire time this is going on he's teabagging after every pallet stun, etc. and getting on your nerves. After you break chase or give up (Maybe you realized his job is to waste as much time as possible and disengage to pressure gens) he's teabagging the shit out of you with the built in OoO.
---
This is just one survivor, and I remember matches where all four survivors were running a MoM + Dead Hard + Deliverance + DS + instaheal combo and if you were playing an M1 killer it was absolutely painful to play. Nobody seems to go down no matter how many times you smack them and the only "Counters" M1 killers had was tunnel off the hook and Mori, or facecamp. I never facecamped people for playing Ash Williams but I used to bring Mori's for Ash Williams. 
---
I actually got fed up and eventually quit playing other killers besides Freddy with the "One Punch Freddy" build (STBFL, PWYF, M&amp;A, Rancor) as MoM being an obsession perk meant they were almost always the Rancor target. I'd focus on the other survivors and completely ignore the obsession (I'd sleep and chase, then break it for a PYWF stack, swing and miss a few times if I'm out of stacks to make it look like I'm trying my best), rack up STBFL stacks on the 3 gen jockeys, and One-Punch-Mori the MoM user at the end and counter literally every single perk and item they have, including SWF partners with borrowed time. 
---
I did it because it was pretty much the only counter M1 killers realistically had, and did it with Old Freddy because he wouldn't reveal his aura from Rancor vs awake survivors. Also, I was pretty decent with Old Freddy, his tracking could make it easier to find the obsession once the last gen is almost done. Finally, I found the aspect of the "Worst" killer in the game (Debatable. I found Old Freddy better than Leatherface and Wraith with the right mindset and playstyle) insta-gibbing someone with a full crutch/meta build especially amusing. I can never thank the devs enough for making MoM an obsession perk. 
---
Anyways Old MoM is like Blackbeard in R6 Siege. Cool concept, but in reality a perk that gave you immunity to being hit for being hit from M1's is unbalanced and screws over anyone not Billy, Nurse, etc. It should have been given the Tinkerer treatment and completely reworked into something else because MoM's idea can't be in a balanced "Not extremely strong, but not dogshit" state. Old MoM had almost zero counterplay besides cheese builds, and New MoM is too hard to earn.
---
Did a gen pop not long after the unhook or around the same time? If so that would have killed his TR in which case it was just an unfortunate sequence of events.
---
Julie is gay

---
You should!  If you keep mixing up different killers and different builds it‚Äôll make your stream more interesting.  I wouldn‚Äôt go to a stream to watch someone play Trapper with the same 4 perks every game. 
---
Don‚Äôt spam your twitch link here on reddit. Just keep streaming and being active in other streams. If you‚Äôre passionate, good things come to those who have patience.

Good luck!

I‚Äôm all ears ghost face tracking perk

Not sure but now I‚Äôll be paying more attention to how I unhook now

Do you have any recommendations on which killer I should play?

Yup I would 100% change that perk over any other. It has no counter once you're found and encourages tunneling the shit out of someone cause if you don't it's wasted.
---
I feel like I Need a Hero might be better suited for something like this:
---
While in a chase with the killer and injured, a random teammate sees your aura and gains an 80% Haste effect until either you are downed or they enter the killer's terror radius.
---
Yeah that would really screw with my build
---
That sucks but it's understandable with queue times like this : /
---
I‚Äôm leveling clown atm with my huntress and honestly I‚Äôm pretty afraid to try him because to me he seems like an M1 ability that isn‚Äôt that great
---
This.
---
One thing is to make the Chili addons give a few extra swings/make the chainsaw frenzy last longer. (Same thing) Chili addons are either broken, or too subtle to be worth running.
---
Reduce the slowdown when charging. 
---
Currently I get super fucking pissed playing LF because ALL THE TIME I feel like I'm within "Yeah there's no way this can miss I'm right behind him" range, do the charge up, survivor gains a little bit of distance from both rev time, and the fact you slow down and build up speed during the frenzy, and I whiff at absolute last second. I feel like I'm a fucking idiot when it happens, which is often.
---
Planetminecraft
---
Just that small change could make him c tier
---
Haha cool
---
I don't get camped often but when I do I hope the others are doing gens while I waste his time, the only time I'd kill myself on hook with a camper is when everyone bum rushes the hook and dies instantly.
---
If she ate my DS i wouldn't even try to save the other Jane cuz i don't have Iron Will. 
---
Would've just bailed.
---
From streamers that I watch on the daily, Id say be a jack of all trades and a master of one or two
---
Does Ash have two normal hands?
---
She knew i was in there, but the killer said in the end game chat he thought i had Head On and didn't wanna take the 5 second DS stun.
---
 She knew i was in there, but the killer said in the end game chat he  thought i had Head On and didn't wanna take the 5 second DS stun.
---
Congrats!! That's awesome Haha
---
he probably calls the slightest bit of lag a lagswitch
---
LEGION US SO MUCH FUUUUUUN
---
Yeah, iri head is pure filth, and insta saw billy is what nightmares are made of lol
---
I gotta admit, without add-ons the slow down is pretty meh. It doesn't slow the survivors down too much but you can still make them slow vault wich is pretty useful. With extra slow down you can eliminate pretty much every loop. Slap one of those bad boys in, throw them next to a loop, double-back and 90% of the time you get the hit. Throw a bottle in the Shack after you vaulted the window, god pallet gone or you get a hit. Also survivors rarely play against a clown wich makes it easier for you to win since they dont know how to counter you. People think clown is like huntress but you have to throw bottles in the loop not at the suvrivors and honestly, i suck with the huntress.
---
You‚Äôre grounded, go to your room.
---
This is exactly why I rebinded my skillcheck key to one of the side buttons on my mouse, plus it makes it easier to hit them for me
---
Sorry for the long response i get too much into it when talking about how great the clown is

---
I'm about to dive in wish me luck guys.
---
Before, but hey, even today I spawn at 12m of a hex sometimes
---
Not really. I could play like an immersed Claudette and get Adrenaline to activate if my team does all the gens.
---
H- how 
---
How am I able to see his belly sticking out
---
Were you playing Leatherface?
---
I suggest playing nurse or huntress (the most cool ones to watch if your skilled). But a mix of everyone is cool. Maybe let your viewers suggest.
---
Remove the incentive and the behavior will cease, such as with all things in life. You COULD choose to continue to slug and tunnel people after these changes but you definitely AREN'T being optimal and thats kinda the point of these changes.It's not meant to punish killers for choosing to do those actions because based off how the game currently works tunneling and camping when utilized properly IS OPTIMAL. The point of the changes is to incentivize them not to, kinda like how bbq encourages you not to camp due to the bp gains and info it gives you.
---
Also NO survivors don't need a perk that does basically what these changes accomplish, nor do killers in fact to hell with the bandaid fixes requiring perks to solve baseline game problems stifles creative builds among and only temp fixes the issue at hand.
---
On a finial note yes killers generally do slug ds targets for 60 seconds, wanna know why? Because it still creates pressure for them and they will just wait the timer out. Thing is, there is no timer to "wait out" with these changes. Again remove the incentive and the behavior will cease. Not every killer is out to FUCK YOUR EXPERIENCE OVER IN PARTICULAR. It just so happens that tunneling and camping is currently situationially optimal so they do it.
---
Oh my...
---
Here who's Michael Mathers?
---
I love watching Spirit. I love watching a really good Michael with his scratched mirror add ons lol.  Ghost Face is cool if you play aggressive and get your stalks on.  But that‚Äôs me, you know?  Streaming, you kinda gotta cater to everyone once you start getting views. 
---
BUT.... people are going to love watching you regardless of who you play as long as you‚Äôre having fun and enjoying your favorite killer. I‚Äôll watch No0b3s stream and he‚Äôll play Billy 5 times in a row sometimes lol
---
This is a such a crutch bad killers use to excuse their bad playing. I know this bc I used to use it myself. But believe it or not it is possible to beat a swf. 90% of the time they are way too altruistic and you can use that to your advantage and punish them.
---
decisives, pallet stuns, teabags, blinds, instaheals
---
Disappear into the dark.
---
Yeah the LOS check is literally a LOS check, nothing more. I've seen people spawn with the totem 3 feet away around a corner, etc.
---
I literally just logged on for the first time today and I already fckn can't.
---
Thanks! It's the Tallman and sphere from Phantasm.
---
M&amp;M
---
I mean, i'm down for more objectives so long as they're done correctly. Last time we had an actual secondary objective was the plants which gave rewards for doing them. Problem was 99% of survivors ONLY did those plants so the game kinda stopped working.
---
To be honest, I'd rather they focus on the Halloween event.  I liked earning those Hallowed skins for everyone, and I'm excited to see more.  Fingers crossed for Hallowed spirit, nurse and Plague
---
If you animated the survivors it would be cooler
---
Do nothing all game, when the last gen gets popped you don't activate Adrenaline because you didn't work for it.
---
Oh wait...
---
The real one all those other Michael Mathers are just imitators.
---
You literally complained about parties in response to me lol
---
When you see the blood coming out and you stay on the gen but it‚Äôs Class Photo and you get destroyed.
---
When did you take this screenshot? They added a LOS check to totem spawns a while ago so this type of situation shouldn't happen.
---
Wraith and spirit are there, just wraith got shy and went invisible, and spirit is the one taking the picture.
---
Idk why but this is so funny
---
Do these ash‚Äôs wear ashy Slashy though? Maybe thats why as the ones without are pretty guaranteed dicks, especially without prestige
---
last i know, when you are asleep, his lullaby is the TR so it most likely should
---
Good question. How skins work is that each limb has 2 layers which can be edited, the main body and the accessory.
---
It baffles me that Jake and Hillbilly got one but not the country girl
---
So true. I mean Hillbilly is understandable, but why Jake ?
---
i think that exhaustion add ons are pretty strong
---
I'm new, as in never fought old Freddy, but the new one is fun as hell to play against. I play survivor to play a multiplayer horror game, and Freddy is very frightening. 
---
Snares are fair, the gen teleport is really cool, and if survivors pay attention to what pallets are dropped/use alert they can counter dream pallets.
---
It doesn't affect huntress so probably won't affect freddy
---
Nice name
---
Bless you kind sir!! For I often carry my team of randoms and near sacrifice my life for them usually, only to be left first hook, which conveniently happens after last gen pops and me being chased for 10minüòë.
---
But cleansing makes the plagues true power come alive ygm but still filthy
---
We are the last of a dying race. Glad to see a fellow epic gamerüòé
---
that's actually hilarious that someone would go that far lmao
---
Yeah really underrated and still really good, clown doesn't seem as popular for some reason despite his ridiculous anti loop abilities
---
Corrupt Interevntion- plague perk. 
---
Blocks all gens farthest from the killer for a minute at T3
---
Aw wasn't me then! Glad to see there are other people that do that too (:
---
Me checking what the quote was:
---
Oh thx so they left for the sake of a minute sigh
---
I guess if I had reddit when I was 15 I would ask questions like this.
---
She is a traumatized woman so she will likely kill you if you touch her.
---
What the fuck is a fucko
---
7 minutes. Seems accurate.
---
Yes please &lt;3
---
i haven't played dbd in like 3 weeks so dunno how it is to play as or against new Freddy but i saw that his TR is just a normal heartbeat while you are awake and when you are asleep it's the lullaby
---
maybe am i wrong?
---
Distortion looking like a soft (like feather soft) counter to that. If it didn't have so few tokens it would be better at it, but you could safely just Sprint burst off because no scratch marks.
---
Had to come on here to see I wasn't the only one with a bugged dead hard lol. Cost me the game but oh well
---
Thanks a lot, appreciate the words. And yeah, sadly the mask wasn't as cheap as you'd think either
---
Link to original video: https://youtu.be/Z1dxvDWBerw
---
Thought it was a cool moment to share
---
Happened to me with a wraith and leatherface. Had to set down my controller and grab the carpet to keep ly hands from throwing something Haha. annoying.
---
Let's be real though, how many times have you had a killer with NOED that didn't have it go off because all the totems got cleansed? Maybe in a 4 man SWF but I've never had a match result playing solo where the killer HAD noed and it never went off. They either didn't have it or they did and not all the totems were cleansed. And it's only OP when you're not the killer because if I ever run it it's cleansed within the first 10 seconds of popping.
---
Which app did you use?
---
I think if they were to take it away it would be ‚Äúmore scary‚Äù chase music only scares low ranks. I think it‚Äôs on purpose so you can‚Äôt hear the noises so they can get away, it‚Äôs supposed to be a stealth game after all, a ‚Äúscary‚Äù one at that.
---
Yes, but his lullaby won't disappear with dark devotion
---
I had this happen to me several times last night and can‚Äôt figure out why. I‚Äôll finish a match and search for another and suddenly get the disconnect message.
---
*high five
---
They just need to make it so you can get rank 1 without doing everything ever match.
---
Cos it's just not as S tier as everyone used to go on about
---
do you disconnect when someone gets hooked
---
Except for the saltiness and general toxicity would skyrocket
---
Wish you could change names on ps4 :(
---
I almost nutted looking at this and I don't even like Billy. If you're taking suggestions I wouldn't mind seeing a huntress one
---
How did you make this?
---
Idk about PWYF. It seems extremely effective especially on someone like Wraith who can lose chases(or at least used to if he can‚Äôt anymore) very easily, giving free stacks.
---
I think you are just getting better, which is great! Hope to see you in the fog! Which killer have you been playing?
---
Yea, just made the post to see what perks would people like to see changed or stay the same
---
And noed is essentially an anti-genrush or anti-swf perk, it sucks when there‚Äôs only 1/2 during the end when it‚Äôs on. There‚Äôs also a totem involved with it. Neither technically reward skill realistically, noed being worse due to its size of a game changer, but has less flexibility in a game as well as being completely removed without control
---
20 days ago, as the post states.  
---
But have you questioned IF the LOS check even works now with all the new bugs dbd gets with every patch?
---
The emblem system would be a good idea if it was fair, but it‚Äôs truly beyond stupid as it is right now.
---
[Only 10% of people have made it to rank 1](https://steamcommunity.com/stats/381210/achievements)
---
lmao
---
Doesn't necessarily have to be a buff, it could be a change. I only seen the perk used on Wraith and Bubba but never in another killer
---
Hi no I've never thought of seeking them but a few people have mentioned it, if I do I'll let you know!
---
Thanks for the comment.
---
Cheers!
---
Just sayin Killer is host so if only survivors are lagging that is why. Lag switching is when you get unhooked and run across the map then all of a sudden you are knocked down and by the hook you were saved from as if you never left it and then you are getting hooked again with no chance to struggle on hook.
---
About the same. IDC about looping, DS, flashlight clicks or any perks. If I can't counter them it more of a matter along the lines of  "I should git gud"
---
This so much! Like Jake over Kate?
---
Exactly.
---
Did that closed the match timer ran out and he still stud there alive and moaning....
---
This would be great, but I think it would be better if they revolved the music around his classic ‚Äúchchch hahahah‚Äù Almost making a beat that is reminiscent of that classic noise, without being too blatantly obvious
---
How is noed anti-swf if the best way to counter it is to coordinate with other survs to break totems?
---
Almost everyone. Mainly Doc, Freddy, Ghostface, Pig, Myers, and Bubba though.

If they can't do gens, why make sure they can't do gens..? Why not make sure other people arent doing gens instead of that one person who you know isn't?
---
When 90% of rank 1 uses BBQ/Ruin/SF/Enduring as killer and DH/DS/BT/Adren as survivor, there's a problem... either those perks are too good or the others are trash.
---
DS is also an issue lmao
---
That's some funny shit !!!!!!LMFAO!!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Shirtless Kevin of GTFO
---
Doesn‚Äôt wanna eat the head on or deal with the decisive
---
It‚Äôs only really grindy if you love the image of a skill in front of three roman numerals.
---
I personally just think ranks should be detirmined by how well you survive as a survivor and by how well you kill as a killer.
---
Thanks a bunch for clearing that up. Already feeling more intelligent.
---
There's just way better perks to run like bond rather than wasting time in the corner of the map self caring
---
Head On? Really?
---
Mosterious shrine is the worst perk in dbd
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
Why not? For perks to be good on all killers, either all the killers would have to have similar mechanics, or perk variety would have to be pretty shit (like survivor perks).
---
The classic Tombstone-Hair combo for Myers. Infinite Evil III, and you get to kill them.
---
Heg scares the living shit out of me every Damn time
---
Yea, I believe is because the others are trash. 
---
WE NEED MORE VARIETY BEHAVIOR!!
---
Thx I'll upload longer version with end game timer running out and nothing happening.... In the end I was forced to "kill" game losing out on match and time...
---
I was really hoping for a DS from the locker, into a pallet drop into a CJ tbh.
---
Then I'm afraid you're devoid of any logic
---
You can still get hits in tier 1 you dont have to wait.
---
Me as well friend.
---
I mean ive been called a lagswitcher when it was the survivors connection to my swrver that was bad so idk man just because youre on a laggy 3rd world internet doesnt mean everyone lagswitches
---
Ok
---
Footage is from **Scream: Resurrection**, a 6-episode miniseries on VH1. It's a fun retelling of the **Scream** story with likable characters and some surprisingly brutal kills. [Check it out!](http://www.vh1.com/shows/scream-the-tv-series)

I was confused, thought this was r/Minecraft talking about DBD, saw it was in DBD, then wondered why there was Minecraft content in r/DeadByDaylight
---
*\*confused screaming**
---
*Asswipes* They created a group message with all of them in it to harass me. Honestly I don‚Äôt really care, knowing nothing will happen even if I do report them. I‚Äôm actually sorta excited because this is the first ‚Äúsalt mail‚Äù I‚Äôve ever been sent. The convo went on for a while, so I figured I‚Äôd just screenshot the part that really summed it up, lol
---
That better be a dwight in that locker.
---
Just had to sneak in dlc didnt you? üòÇ
---
Ahh it sounds like you were camping by that last statement. 
---
Just seems like another stupid fucking Swf that acts cocky for no reason lol. 
---
He‚Äôs not amazing but I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt find him the weakest at all. He‚Äôs very adding dependent, lightbulb and gas can. Or PWYF. 
---
But knowing a loop good enough you could get a survivor. 
---
But I do think he needs a buff to being able to rev 2 seconds faster, sure it may be monstrous with his addons but it will probably boost him to Michael Tier. Maybe.
---
That is like not flushing the toilet after a shit because you might need to piss on an hour or so..
---
perfectly cut.
---
Probably will
---
The mobile controls are so clunky as killer and survivor. There were looping exactly like someone with a controller or keyboard would.
---
Then the survivor could get back in right after thy stun the killer, thus forming an infinite forcefield of inescapable death.
---
Lmao while I was watching this my thoughts exactly
---
Corrupt Purge is Huntress‚Äô hatchets on steroids
---
T-Ta-take my upvote  UwU
---
The doctor‚Äôs new insanity jumpscare always makes me jump because it‚Äôs so ear-shattering
---
LF gets looped til Daylight by any survivor with half a brain. He destroys the ones that drop pallets as soon as he revs.
---
Dammit rory this is why killers can't have nice thing üòÇ
---
I agree with most of these needing adjustments except a couple.
---
Killer Perks;
---
Infectious Freight getting buffed risks making it exceptionally strong on some of the best killers in the game, namely Nurse &amp; Hillbilly. Otherwise it works really well with killers that have abilities to insta down survivors or powers that can leave survivors injured throughout the match. Rather Niche but still fills a good role for a slugging/tracking perk. 
---
I feel like the Devs should buff the blindness effect rather than change the perk. Buffing blindness would also improve add-ons that inflict blindness which is very much needed. Perhaps having an effect of removing the killers red-stain or having the killer more difficult to visually see similar to Freddy's ability to go invisible from a distance.
---
Deerstalker is pretty decent. Its great for slugging survivors and filling that niche role similar to Infectious Freight. 
---
Rest of the killer perks I agree definitely need some form of adjustment. 
---
I would include Huntress Lullaby due to the high number of tokens required despite being a hex perk that is revealed at the start of the game.
---
Dark Devotion could have some work done to it. Considering how situational it is some minor buffs to it or entirely removing the obsession requirement for it.
---
Furtive Chase could definitely do with some buffs. Perks best feature is the ability to switch the obsession.
---
Bloodhound seems rather strange because despite it being a relatively weak tracking perk, it does exactly what you would want it to do. No idea on how a buff could be implemented without adding another feature to bloodhound. 
---
Survivor Perks;
---
Hope is pretty strong during the late game, especially against M1 killers. Having an extra 6% movement speed can totally destroy 110% movement speed killers like the Huntress in loops while also making normal M1 killers have a significantly harder time chasing survivors. Unless its a functionality change, buffing speed increase would break the perk.
---
Everything else under survivors I agree do need some form of buff.
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll be sure to keep that in mind. I might be able to post it next Friday if they work, which they should.
---
What'd ya think of the series? JW
---
Clever
---
If you consider holding down a specific area because multiple survivors are swarming you at once to save their teammate, even though they all could‚Äôve easily escaped, then yes, I was camping. And I agree with your ideas to buff Leatherface. At the very least they could let him move at regular speed when revving the chainsaw
---
I'm pretty sure she'd spazz out and slice your hook right off.
---
yeah i'd love to see more fan art here, especially like that! keep em comin! 
---
(also you should totally draw nea as one of the killers, just sayin)
---
Maybe nobody else can be in killer‚Äôs terror radius? Only way it could be viable/fair
---
I thought it says ‚ÄúBuckle up fuckos, let‚Äôs roll!‚Äù ?
---
I am pretty new but it‚Äôs an issue when I‚Äôm on the hook for a whole five gens with the killer right in front of me
---
No I don‚Äôt consider that camping I consider that stupid survivors playing stupidly risky with a low chance of survival.
---
If you decide to share them, please dm me the link, you did an amazing job!!!
---
Since red ranks seem toxic and boring im cool with playing an hour a day and just chilling in the green/purple ranks while playing the game normally.
---
I honestly don't care what perks survivors run, but if they wanna bitch about BBQ and Chili, Ruin, NOED, or any other perk they just decide is OP then of course im gonna throw D-Strike, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, and the rest back at them.
---
I know the licensing is on the fritz, but one can pray amirite
---
Ohhh that is satisfying
---
yes please draw one for all of your favorite killers
---
People in this sub hardly call anything op in fear of their opinion being downvoted. Lol. Now something can actually be op and no one wants to speak up about it I‚Äôll go ahead and say it. Don‚Äôt let leatherface run insidious. Lol I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other issues but that meme build should be discontinued.
---
Guy looking at m/w: not gay
---

---
Yeah it was alright wasn't great I mean there was a part in it where this 5 ft gay guy tapped a guy on the leg this guy was a monster  with 2 other big giant guys with him and they said let's go this guys crazy I was like really wtf irl that wouldn't happen
---
Level 15 in a nutshell lol
---
It looks like +650 BP to me
---
Worth watching tho
---
Simple: remove leatherface and billy.
---
Good job dude üëçüèª
---
Sorry to hear. Best way to counter it is hope the killers bad and have good enough teammates. 
---
Sometimes because killers camp it gets hard to pip. But if you learn to loop better you will be rewarded or waste the killers time and pip but if you escape that‚Äôs double pip. 
---
Can‚Äôt counter LF though so don‚Äôt try lol. 
---
Also if you get Camped don‚Äôt be selfish and DC let your teammates try to escape. 
---
You being on the hook for that long gives them about 3-4 gens being popped. Which is a win game if they don‚Äôt have the 3 gen strat online for killer.
---
It looks like trappy boi wants a hug
---
Actually safety pip isn‚Äôt a bad idea if you don‚Äôt dc though. 
---
But I would say just get better at looping you‚Äôll manage to safety pip or pip when he finally catches you.
---
What perk is the last one on the right?
---
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
This is not for me. This is for all the complaints. All the new players. I am devotion 6 and I can loop most killers for at least 3 gens
---
Damn that was smooth like room temperature butter going on some hot toast...or a bagel whatever you prefer.
---
Its fucked me over hard on Lery's because they kept running to the section next to the gate, and for some reason the only "close" hook was just out of reach before I could hook them. Important to note I was playing wraith.
---
Every friend I get now I'm a killer main the tables have turned
---
Holy crap these are S Tier lolüòÅ. I'm all for creativity but these are a bit too strong imo especially the last one
---
Her lullaby is more of a character thing that‚Äôs not that terror radius his singing is the terror radius so yeah it would take that away
---
The problem with "META" in every competitive game is, you cant remove it. If you try to buff something to be more relevant, it becomes meta, and you'll see it for a long time until something gets buffed so it can replace the current meta. Nerfs are the same, so can some adjustments.
---
Also, people want wins above fun, so they use and abuse the meta as much as possible to achieve victory.
---
I see your point, the same thing over and over again is boring, but theres no escape for this
---
I tried a scratched mirror Myers build for the first time, I didn't kill anyone but hell was it fun!!!
---
How about when someone DCs during load and you de-pip and lose your offering? It happened to me 2 times in the past week. Most times you don't de-pip, but sometimes you do. I have no clue why.
---
Big Tatas
---
dark sense, see killer after you pop a gen and after exit gates are powered
---
Nah dude Sony does ban accounts for abusive messages, it's always worth reporting
---
As a player who plays Doctor very often i diagnose you with shock therapy and a stack of game offerings
---
r/dbdgonewild then
---
It‚Äôs called Borrowed Time... as long as everyone runs it you can‚Äôt really facecamp minus maybe bubba.  It‚Äôs a bit annoying that it has to take up a perk slot but BT should pretty much be in every players loadout, that‚Äôs just how it is.
---
Could you draw what is referred to as ‚Äúshirtless Myers‚Äù google it and you should see it. It is basically Michael Myers without a shirt. And the whole community is crazy over him.
---
That was some Tom and Jerry shit lmao
---
I've honestly hadn't had it happen as survivor since. Totems still spawn 2 feet away but they're around a corner and don't spawn where they're visible during the camera spin. Evidently this is apparently still a thing.
---
I don't know. Killers dc often on me cause I can loop and then nobody gets points and lose everything. I have not lost anything personally if someone drops out before the match starts. I keep my mori offering, they usually close their game app after seeing that black offering.
---
*oink*
---
so basically another killer with the ability to ignore all form of defense survivors have, now with built in instadown? that's a fat no from me my man
---
i would know, when i was baby meg it was the only perk i used, i thought it was top tier
---
Bad killers grumble that without noed they wouldnt get any kills
---
Good killers grumble that without noed, adrenaline lets survivors play injured for free when there are two or three gens left to do.
---
I pray for a world where nobody uses either of those perks, they're just not healthy for the flow of the game at all.
---
This doesn't sound a like discussion it sounds like a rant
---
True
---
That doesn't take away from the fact that they are 1 sided mindgames.
---
Doctor my favourite
---
What other perks are good for camping in endgame. I have noed and what is a good killer that can camp well and counter borrowed time
---
Just wondering if I went a little over board?
---
SWF doesnt cleanse totems, they just loop and pound out gens. 
---
Then complain about noed in the post game chat
---
All this does is make it so if a Killer really wants you to suffer, they'll just camp and make you sit there until the game is over. So instead of sitting there a max of 2 minutes, you'll be on the hook probably 5+ minutes depending on  how long it takes the remaining survivors to finish gens and open a door. 
---
It would absolutely cause the killer to lose hard, but it would make the experience even worse for the person on the hook.
---
I feel you that‚Äôs my birthday October 1st ü§ôüèª
---
Survivor's currently get some emblem progress for leading a killer on a chase as gens and totems are being worked on. This was added to address "I looped the killer for 5 gens, got downed and camped, and depipped" situations.
---
I agree if you're being camped, (Killer in X meters of hook after 10 seconds, maybe if no survivors are nearby like the chaser penalty for killer) you should get SOME emblem points for otherwise distracting the killer as gens and totems are worked on. It already is a thing for chases, and should be a thing for being camped.
---
IMHO you shouldn't be able to pip up if you were camped the entire hook process and did nothing else, but you shouldn't be able to depip from it provided teammates were doing gens in the meantime.
---
hey don‚Äôt want to be an asshole but do you not mind plugging your shit? i‚Äôm so sick of people saying ‚Äúyo check out my stream‚Äù ‚Äúfollow my ig‚Äù
---
I quite like lightweight, it‚Äôs one of those perks which is alright, but it‚Äôs kinda overshadowed by the top tier stuff. I run it from time to time.
---
Just joking bro, it‚Äôs just a game lol
---
Laughs in Night Shroud
---
I always use it. If killer is soft camping me then chances are they will see the saviors tracks and not mine. Spirit can't track me especially when paired with Iron Will
---
May you be rewarded many times over for your service and for all the other Xbox randoms  who do the objective , safe unhook, body block. May your names go down in the books of gaming legends.
---
When you didnt even cleanse once but you're the 1st victim of the corrupt purge.
---
Dude, same!
---
I pip so easily, even when I try not to. Literally doing nothing will give you stealth points, and you can touch gens for very brief intervals and get lightbringer to silver so easily.
---
I honestly just thought that it was because it's so hot where I live right now but the game is probably pretty poorly optimized as well
---
Lower the settings and give it higher priority for cores, and limit the amount of other bullshit you have running alongside it. Worse case scenario it sounds like you still need to update some guts in your PC because DBD is an unoptimized mess. Some people run this on virtual potatoe batteries with no issues, it just may be you don't have the right drivers, gcard, etc.
---
Something to keep new players from putting the game down and never trying again. Nobody on my Ps4 friends list plays Dead by Daylight
---
which also isn‚Äôt perfect, jesus BHVR needs to expand their bug fixing team. half the posts here are bug complaints
---
So perks used so rarely that you never see them except from new players are good at base ? You can create a pool of viable perks without trying to make them meta. Look at Alert from example it used to be garbage, they changed it and now it's viable. All of these need this kind of improvement in my opinion.
---
Oh yea, it‚Äôs small brain time
---
Your coochie privileges, hand em over
---
I find it's similar with killers. I've done a match of me being friendly and got a pip.
---
And insidious leather daddy
---
Sorry but how is Socialize "F" tier?
---
Been playing Michael today, staying at tier one and just giving people jump scares all game. Only killing people if they make it really easy. Being told about how players literally jumped out of their seats in post game puts a smile on my face, and it's a fun break from the BP grind.
---
Ikr. Man clearly has no respect.
---
Yes I live in Arizona so it's like 110 outside lmao but we keep it at 75F inside w A/C so it shouldn't be a problem
---
That could work.
---
oh! don‚Äôt forget their marvellous and balanced perk ideas: 
---
‚Äúshooty bang bang gun‚Äù
---
Grants once every match a 99.93783839999999999% chance to kill the killer for the duration of the trial
---
Honestly why they they even need to do that nerf? Literally no one asked for it and if someone did they are probably rank 15 or lower
---
My friend also got perma banned recently seemingly for no reason. 
---
Does your friend family share on steam with anyone who MIGHT have hacked or exploited? Because we are pretty sure that‚Äôs why my mate got banned as apparently if anyone you share with cheats you get an auto perma ban.
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll get any response from BHVR, they don‚Äôt give a shit about their player base and actually communicating with bans. That‚Äôs the harsh truth :/
---
I dont know what you mean by rarely. I use them in concert with other perks. They dont need to update the perks some on here could use a buff but its a small few. Most are fine.
---
yeah but you dont have to work on gens to get it to pop. you can not do the objective and adrenaline will still pop
---
Good= doing the objective
---
Bad= not doing the objective
---
Survivors have to do gens and escape.
---
Killers have to kill and prevent gens from being done.
---
It's incredible, but I feel like the break in the music would cause some confusion towards the middle of a chase, where it suddenly gets quiet.
---
don‚Äôt forget that hitting someone more than once with your ability gives you a stroke
---
Black Incense is so strong LOL. Also, you forgot to add an Apple, so you get your power anyway.
---
You should try it for yourself and see if it benefits your playstyle, rather than asking everyone else lol it works better for some people than other people. It completely depends on how you want to play.
---
I got really pissed once when I was injured and the killer was right behind me. Adrenaline popped a nanosecond before he hit me and I was instantly downed.
---
SCP 215
---
I'm still unsure of whether the Power should be just straight up reduced in duration and remove the Glass Pane idea, or if it is better to have her start strong with survivors slowly reducing it over the course of the game.
---
"easily" *laughs in solo survivor*
---
This is the nurse
---
Dude i play both and I'm pretty good with both(red ranks). I can tell you that noed is way more annoying than adrenaline. To properly use adrenaline you need to be good at running around the killer, to properly use noed you only need to have 1 finger able to push m1
---
Also having the problem for the past 2 - 3 days
---
not to forget ghostfaces power recycling
---
Because they‚Äôve seen shitty teammates use it poorly so now the perks suck. Notice how everyone who shits on it (including the OP of this thread) always brings up ‚Äúbecause people just go to the corner of the map to heal‚Äù. Sure if your team does that than it‚Äôs bad. But that‚Äôs like saying DS is F tier because my teammates miss the skill check all the time. Self care is a good perk if you use it correctly.
---
I literally cant remember where totems are after I found them lol
---
giant chucky would kick goofy as fuck though, his head would be the size of a pi√±ata
---
I only depip and lose everything when the game loads in but right after you get DCd because someone dcd during loading. Every other time I keep everything
---
Fake Scientists....
---
She just got buffed with the lullaby not being directional anymore she doesn't need to be more powerful
---
i don‚Äôt know but if it‚Äôs another licensed killer...
---
Shirtless Dwight, imo. And hairy chest, please.
---
Playing Claudette is now reportable.
---
With dedicated servers coming, there's honestly no reason they can't do this. All player data will (allegedly) be stored in a centralized location that is platform-independent.
---
I dont play her, whats it do?
---
Then you're literally making her too strong on any other map. Just buffing her because she's bad on a few maps would make her too strong on the older maps. Huntress is honestly pretty strong still
---
Tbh the emblem system sucks for both sides. Killer has double pips (and adept achievements) very hard because of the various requirements. I've 4K'd as billy slugging everyone 2 minutes into the match, 3 sacrifice one bleedout (and maybe one DC, if so 2 sacrifices) and only BARELY safety pipped. Gatekeeper (Stalling game) was changed and now only counts for the first 9 minutes meaning you  NEED ruin if you want a good gatekeeper score, even if you're playing Hostage/3-gen Doc and drag the game out on the last gen for an hour. Silver in gatekeeper.
---
Malicious and Chaser also have problems. You get points for HITTING the survivor which means instadowns (Myers, Chainsaws, etc.) don't give you as much points as two M1 hits, and an insta-down followed by the slugged survivor being healed twice means you flat out lose a point in Malicious. I'm pretty sure if you tombstone someone with Myers the game acts as if you lost the chase since you never technically hit them and the chase ends during the mori animation. 
---
Survivor especially at high ranks also is very reliant on the killer. I tested a few things and a cloaked AFK Wraith (Or killer facing a wall) can make EVERYONE (Or maybe only survivors who didn't do much) depip because nobody got chased, healed, unhooked, etc.
---
its just my editing, the devs could fix it, filmora can't
