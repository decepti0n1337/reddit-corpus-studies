I feel we should at least be able to see the level of the character. Rank can stay gone, I don‚Äôt really mind that, but level did nothing wrong. Yeah, people might dip because I‚Äôm a Rank 7 running a Level 9 Yui, but still.
---
old ladies have money in their purses. just putting it out there :)
---
Poor Doctor...
---
I got him, played about 3 games so far. His strength (at least what I‚Äôm picking up on him) seems to be in tracking people. So perks going toward making them bleed would be a great investment. 
---

---
His secondary bash is good if you have enough time to whack em, but I‚Äôve been getting slippery people, quicker than my draw back with him, which is frustrating. But when you get a good whack, I took out two people at once. 
---
The demon dash is good, especially if you get them by surprise. Make sure you bash at the climax. Especially after the last gen pops, demon dash to the exit gate and whack a Claudette. (I love Claudette as she was my previous main, but going against so many is getting ridiculous on ps4 tonight.)
---
Overall, he has a little bit of a learning curve, but amazing potential once you get the right perks. 7/10 is what I‚Äôd give, would recommend if you like a billy that can track blood better than most.
---
If I could actually get a game, oce wake up pls I wanna play ;-;

---
Some background: there is a new bug when you get hooked in the basement and then saved, you'll "fall" forever. Also, you'll only see a purple sky. But to the other survivors you are still in the game. So my SWF buddy went to the basement to guide me by shouting which direction the exit is.
---
We laughed so hard, and managed to escape.
---
I don't know if a bunch of people who are voting are at work and therefore not looking for and upvoting posts about it or what, but it's so prevalent that I can't believe it hasn't gotten more attention (read: be the entire front page). It's 100% reproducible, and yet BHVR refers to it in the most vague way possible on its known issues and I don't think we're getting a bug fix today.
---
nah I got u man wasnt coming at u or anythig was just giving my feedback on DCers and the inspiration behind the meme really

ngl I expected way worse after seeing seeing legion's state. glad they didn't fuck his 1 shot up and changed it to a 1 dmg state + bleed or something. thx man!
---
i mean sure but it's a video for entertainment, would you really want to watch monto get Gen rushed in 3 minutes or tunneled and mori'd instantly?
---
Can't. Imagine a no mither squad relentlessly bullying a poor oni.
---
Ah okay good good. Its a good meme tho
---
Oh my god I just shit myself with excitement... I have been anticipating his rework for so long, I AM LEGIT SO GODDAMN PSYCHED FOR THIS I MISS MY ZAPPY BOI
---
I love this- can you by any chance make a version for perks where most of the bodies are traced over with white lines? The black stick figure bodies are really hard to see on purple/ green backdrops.
---
Oof this is going to take forever
---
Yeah, that's a new bug. If you get hooked there your camera just drops out of the world
---
It should be every single unhook, mines been working fine
---
i got drivers ed so i only work weekends
---
Yeah, that's fair. I might get down to that while waiting for the mid-chapter patch.
---
Twitch emote. Used for when you're saying something stupidly obvious.
---
Me: "How can i keep living like this?"
---
Friend: "Just breathe 4head"
---
Shut the fuck up. I don't care. I play both sides equally so I'm not an entitled survivor or killer.
---
We played against the hag. Suddenly he screamed: STOP TRAP! XD
---
Ah okay... weird.
---
&gt; The DC penalty will have no direct effect on anything.
---
The time it takes to down and hook the survivor is already more than we're getting right now on average for a DC, and for killers they'll get more point and for sure hook and such.
---
It's better.
---
It's not perfect, but it's better. DCing is fucking dog shit and anyone who does it is a fucking entitled twerp. Suiciding on hook is ALMOST as bad, but not quite. Fuck people who DC, and I wish they would keep logs and actually look to ACTUALLY give bans and such, cause they definitely don't.
---
One worse then the other, can't decide which one I hate more
---
There‚Äôs no pleasing them. Play however you want. I just had a survivor message me saying ‚Äúa real killer would me have the hatch‚Äù. You‚Äôre never obligated to go easy on your opponent or give free chances.
---
Feng looks adorable honestly lol. Maybe I'm biased because that skin combined with the blond hair has been my feng ever since the skin came out but idk.
---
Happend to me today as well
---
Fellow controller player here, it takes time to get the feel of each killer as each one is unique. Finding one that fits your playstyle will take a little time as you getting more perks and add lns. You can do it!
---
I like how you try to make me sound entitled when you literally just got a dump truck of other free cosmetics today
---
Considering how long it took them to rework Freddy, I fear our favorite edge lords will remain on the shelf for some time. I mean, Doc is only **just now getting leaks** about a rework.
---
I literally bought her earlier this morning cause I assumed with my luck it wouldn't show up in shrine... Just my luck.. fml
---
I just got decisive last week! Oof
---
I don‚Äôt think I really want to see Monto hyping up some special build just to watch him get 0 kills with it or get face camped 2 minutes into the game
---
*Add-ons
---
 Lets see...
---
get grabbed by killer fall through the floor ‚úì
---
get grabbed by killer can't struggle ‚úì
---
get hooked in the basement cant see anything but flashing lights ‚úì
---
get hooked and unable to die in game ‚úì
---
have oni ignore collisions ‚úì
---
go into a locker and fall through the floor ‚úì
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Also love that oni can basically be a billy but better. Charge 1 shot, charge down whole team, unbreakable required, collisions not detected, and dont forget he can pretty much track you non stop.
---
Stop looking for the hatch and save me!
---
But he looks fine af
---
Why did you censor the word unit
---
Way to go. Behavior just saw this video and now this perk will surely be nerfed lol
---
What if we stole steves sun glasses
---
Because fixing matchmaking was given up on three years ago.
---
1,2,3,4 I only see 4 survivors?
---
no pretty sure it is death or survival and I chose the ladder
---
I've had a weird falling through the floor thing no fewer then 5 times today
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs out of your hands. You don‚Äôt get to survive just bc you want to.
---
We wanted legion changes lol
---
No one here asked for what they did to him
---
It takes time to get good but its worth it. I'd suggest watching gameplay on Youtube (Puppers, Monto, Noob3, TrueTalent, TheKing, etc) to pick up some tips and tricks; and maybe also getting good at survivor before you play killer so you know what to expect from the other side.
---
Yamete!
---
I only like it because I just started running unbreakable to counter it
---
Do you ever check Reddit before spamming the sub with something that‚Äôs been posted 100 times?
---
I play both as well and usually end up disagreeing with tru3. Scott Jund, Ohtofu and otz are killer mains that are much more agreed on when it comes to game balance. But it mostly comes down to tru3 being willing to sacrifice any fun for pure competitiveness; a mindset that I despise. Fun should always be the priority in a game.
---
Wow when is it coming out
---
It's honestly discouraging when every match even though you're trying to time your hits they always miss because the survivors can play juke games with you all match. I've only found mild success with the trapper but with how many exits every room has it feels pointless and a huge gamble setting traps behind windows or even pallets.
---
There‚Äôs sensitivity on Console. I‚Äôd need help from some lads to adjust it accordingly but otherwise
---
Also, is it just me or are the swing sounds early?
---
What a weird comment. If I'm reading it right, you're upset because while you got a truckload of free cosmetics today, the few that were tied to in-game events aren't available to you, and because of that I'm supposed to feel like I'm entitled?
---
Like I honestly don't know what to make of you. If you sincerely concerned about cosmetics being made available to newer players then that happened. Enjoy!
---
But it sounds like you're full of sour grapes because they held back a small handful of cosmetica. Which makes it seem like you never really cared about the core issue at all, but are just looking for a reason to be upset.
---
Don't forget about Huntress Lullaby. Reverse skill checks with no skill check warning will be a nightmare to hit.
---
Had the same xD
---
I feel evil for saying this but I think they should have made Bills sweater a shard purchase. Now that every player has access to this it‚Äôll probably be used more than the default look all year round. Also, that means Bills store page will still remain empty even though he actually has cosmetics. 
---
On the other hand I‚Äôm happy because I like Bill and this outfit is fun but not really worth money real or virtual, same applies to most other survivor ugly sweaters.
---
Yes
---
You said there are a lot of add-ons to go through- I wouldn't mind helping out :)
---
I can even do the white line tracing for the perks
---
I always wanted to make a pack like this anyway- I'll have to match your style though (same line thickness and such)
---
Its 5pm and no DLC on Xbox... Is this not coming out today?

I love the concept of them in lockers it makes "The Legion" make a lot more sense if youre actually encountering multiple killers in the same trial
---
I mean I guess so? 90% of my matches have had someone with a purple flashlight and two green or better add-ons for it and spend the entire match just trolling with it anytime I do something. The only thing I can do is look up but even then it doesn't work half the time. Being able to tank hits for friends while you sprint off like you snorted a line of crack seems wildly bonkers to me.
---
It‚Äôs a yugioh card
---
Haha hag and doctor are free on console but anyway I would choose hag she is pretty good
---
I try to always be nice because I play survivor too and I know how frustrating it is to have an insta-dc, so I do farm. It's just... Weird. They always want more.
---
Here is mine :3 [Survivor submission](https://imgur.com/gallery/zINVJr9)
---
Ah! So your argument is that saying these things is an act of virtue signaling, yes?
---
They added robot survivor
---
Is spine chill a meta perk now?
---
Its because it‚Äôs such a shock to the killer. The light burns their eyes in some way, so they forget what they‚Äôre doing and throw their arms in front of their face to shield themselves. That‚Äôs why they drop the survivor. Maybe they‚Äôre more sensitive to bright lights.
---
Decisive strike seems like a pretty solid solution to that issue.

---
You might like Wraith a little more! I would suggest watching some videos by Painreliever on youtube. You might like perks that help you find survivors better until you get better in chases
---
Why did they do this
---
For me I had been watching Let‚Äôs Plays for months before getting the game so I went in knowing the basics. If not for that I don‚Äôt think I would have been patient enough to survive the learning curve
---
Because behavior are straight up clowns
---
I don't think you're allowed to put other people's names on here.
---
I don't think the game is forcing anyone to play the game that they don't want to or that the game does not deliver. In the same logic i see people DC on any game.
---
In LoL they could go afk because they don't want to play against Zed or Yasuo or someone feeds(same with someone suiciding on hook).
---
In Rocket League first goal against them make people insta FF or go AF(like first down in DBD)
---
and it could be same with any other online game, DC in CS GO, not wanting to play against someone in fighting games etc etc.
---

**It's the salty people that force the DC's, not the game.**

I think we did a pretty good job

Hmm okay I'll check it out
---
That ending was beautiful.
---
Theoretically, a killer could spawn on a map that has 3 gens this close together, and he could just patrol those 3 gens, never leave the triangle, slug anyone who tries to work on a generator, kick generators when they get any progress, and never pick anyone up. At some point the survivors are going to have to get at least one of those generators. What would be the optimal strategy?
---
For the legions cosmetics is it just a sweater? Or do they have anything else
---
fucking potatoe
---
Take this down bro witch-hunting isn‚Äôt allowed here
---
Tbh I think legion is fine I‚Äôm level 1 killer (1 perk nothing else) rank 14 I got a 4k earlier against rank 10,8,8,6 but I will have to admit this does sound like a great idea. Does anyone actually struggle with legion?
---
Legion: "...oh my god"
---
There are many cases that people DC after the first Down or even the first Hit, much earlier before they are even hooked.
---
Seriously you have a character called ‚ÄúThe Legion‚Äù and the only thing ‚ÄúLegion‚Äù about them is their cosmetics.
---
Damn, I‚Äôm sorry! 
---
I hope you at least enjoy playing as her!
---
And this is why I have my PS4 set to ‚Äúfriends only‚Äù with chat. Literally some players get so desperate that they try to ‚Äúadd‚Äù me so they can write a message through the friend request because they get so toxic, childish and petty. 
---
All I say to that is block, block and more block.
---
3 accounts ? For what ?
---
I thought the new killer perk doesn't, because of the changes to Deep Wounds

Game is unplayable rn fucking dumb ass devs
---
wow so funny, like this hasn't happened to half the people playing this game.
---
Thanks for letting me know! I‚Äôll remove it nos
---
Serious question:  What is the killer supposed to do if the survivors have completed between 0 and 2 gens and there are 2 survivors remaining?  They literally can't find the hatch because the hatch hasn't spawned yet, so they're betting the last kill on a coinflip at that point.  Even if enough gens are done that the hatch could spawn, is it any better to have the killer slug the second to last survivor until they find the hatch then kill 2nd to last survivor before camping the hatch?  Or is the killer supposed to just not go for 4 kills and accept that he last survivor will always get a free coinflip for the escape even if none of them even touched a gen?
---
Slugging for the 4k isn't fun, I agree.  Hatch standoffs weren't fun, I'm glad they got rid of them.  But currently there is no way for a killer to confirm a 4K without it, unless they just so happen to run into the last 2 survivors at the same time.  And if we're going to say that the killer should not try and get kills, then this game's objectives need an overhaul because that is one of the most heavily weighted categories in the game's scoring system.
---
8 seconds mend men bad
---
Yes so he needs to tunnel smh
---
Guess it‚Äôll be a week of DCing in the basement.
---

---
Updoot
---
That's awesome :o
---
Just keep running, fake vault if you know he's gonna shock you
---
can confirm this happens when getting hooked in the basement
---
Ewww spirit gg ez baby killer. Ur bad delete the game. (Where‚Äôs my upvote)
---
im a complete noob with computers, how do you draw on the template?
---
There's definitely something wrong with the basement hook.
---
I wish I noticed him 8 hours ago, I kinda just tunnel visioned on Oni and only noticed him because Franklin's has a quote now.
---
aurora borealis at this time of year at this time of day in this part of the country localized entirely within your game
---
Zubat is also the embodiment of perfection when it comes to DBD and makes weak killers look strong too.
---
But yes, a lot of people overreact about the slightest change.
---
Wait how is it outdated? Is the sound no longer global?
---
I dont really think BHVR should strive to have low tier killers, they should strive to make all killers on an equal power level and have their abilities be what defines them so you can play with any killer you want and can still do well.
---
the point of timer is its pressing you to heal when really its pressing you to just run, if a timer can be so easily ignored whats the point of having it, 
---
really the only point of deep wounds now is the extra healing time but nurses cant even see it being healed so its like a slighty buffed weird  sloppy butcher now 4 seconds vrs 8 seconds but nurses cant see the heal
---
the timer never will come into play unless in the future there is a killer perk or power that stops survivors from running (that would be OP so not happening)
---
It's ridiculous. Makes the game completely broken and should be hotfixed asap.
---
I don't get why folks are pretending he's been nerfed and are downvoting folks who say he was buffed.  His movement with Feral Frenzy was buffed in every way, only his Deep Wounds/on-hit perks aspect were nerfed.  But his strength was more about creating an annoyance and quickly putting folks in a wounded state anyway.  Thanataphobia/Dying Light are still going to be strong on him.
---
If anything he's better at applying Deep Wounds now than he was before.  His whole point is to create disruption and make Survivors stop what they're doing for a bit.
---
Are your teammates running borrowed time? BT along with DS should help.
---
Nah he‚Äôs ready to fuckin destroy mate.
---
Zubat is one of the best killers.
---
Hes either really new or has arthritis in his thumbs.

Why does The Legion evoke such hate in people? I was having a great two day streak of games with him and that's when I received the most hate messages.

so yes and no, you can see the back of your eye with this experiment but the only way you could see those vessels is if you were seeing the ‚Äúshadow‚Äù of them on the back of your eyelids (or a black piece of paper or something like that in the experiment). You don‚Äôt actually see what‚Äôs *in* your eye, you see what is projected onto the front and then focused through the lens onto the macula, anything between that you can‚Äôt see clearly because it‚Äôs within the thing that‚Äôs recording it, like if your camera had something behind the lens it would either see through it or there would be some kind of blob or black spot. Hypothetically if the light was bright enough you could probably blind someone with it regardless of wether or not their eyes were closed. I‚Äôm just getting done with my work I‚Äôll look into it more...
---
The basement glitch happened to me twice tn as survivor, don‚Äôt think they were on the back hook, pretty sure the first was on the closest to the stairs.
---
Wait what is this bug you guys are talking about?
---
Sounds like a skyrim shout
---
Were you able to use Franklin's with frenzy before this new patch? Because I was playing Legion for two days straight and I was only using Frenzy to close distance since I couldn't make survivors drop their items.
---
Oh
---
Is it ok if I remake this in Garrys Mod but give you the credit?
---
Lovely comic. Your art style is so good! Great job!
---
I've yet to find a game with Iridescent Head where everyone didn't DC in the first 3 minutes.
---
is that me omg i found you on reddit, hi bro
---
I love the *we are one* power. It would add to the jump-scare of the game and make it more thrilling too. I would add that legion could transfer themselves to the locker legion (kinda like hag) only if the legion in locker does not attack. If a survivor is smart they will just avoid lockers all together but this will at least give legion a chance to close the gap quicker.

Both of mine were on the back hook, but it could also just be any hook. I mentioned it in a lobby and it happened to someone else, they said it was another hook as well, on a different map. Seems like this is just a new game breaking bug
---
It's solo queue, it's a mixed bag of half-finished meta loadouts and "fuck it that'll do" loadouts.
---
its a fair point, maybe i could save my cells for something else, and also yes devour hope looks good, thank u
---
Truth be told... if I'd spawn next to the killer and they down me instantly, I'd suicide on first hook as well. It's one thing to be outplayed by a killer and be downed early, it's another one to basically be downed during the loading screen, more or less.

I'm on console though so RIP.

All I can say is if I use a mori and someone disconnects, I should not lose that item. Bunch of entitled losers playing this game as survivors,  tea bagging, body blocking, flash light spamming when I'm trying to put someone on a hook. Fix disconnect or not I have a damn good time anyone quits or does some salty stuff. Why? Because over the past like 50 games or more I've absolutely demolished nearly all survivors. Seriously less than 10 people have gotten away in the past 50 matches I've played.

Deep Wounds is no longer linked to Terror Radius, mending and sprinting are what halts the timer now
---
Yea I‚Äôm sorry saying DCing is bad but oh I don‚Äôt like this mori in this horror based game I‚Äôm definitely going to DC is just shitty.
---
just m1  
---
Kidding, of course. The main strengths that benefit almost every killer is learning how to run loops, when to give up, and more specific to each killer, what their map pressure is. You can figure this out by watching youtubers or streamers who play killers a lot.
---
People are sleeping on spirit fury/enduring on legion. I know it¬¥s used on EVERY m1 killer, but unlike STBFL it has no rng and the stun allows you to recover from your power super quick. That + the iri (admittedly rare) pin that lets you break pallets instantly and you got a build that feel pretty lethal imo.
---
You‚Äôre in the store you need to check customization the regular way. Just go change your top the normal way

In the PTB you left blood orbs but i dont know if they changed it

Just confirming this happened back-to-back for me, both in the basement, one from Plague and one from Billy, on PS4. I had to close the game both times, and lost pips, and am afraid of what this will do to my lobby wait time when the new penalty is issued. Hope it‚Äôs fixed soon.
---
Nope cause I live in Canada and not a third world country pretending to be a first world one (cough) USA (cough)  but I mean I get 600$ every two weeks I can spend 20-30$ on a game if I want
---
Yes any on-hit perk worked with Frenzy hits before this patch.
---
Cool story.
---
This is such a weird take. Why should any developer feel like they have to force someone to play a game? Why are you playing if you feel like you have to be forced to at times?
---
I realize iri head Huntress with Mori isn't fun at all, but play the fucking match. There's probably people in the lobby that would like to try their hardest and possibly escape, even if odds are super stacked against you.
---
Whenever you are hooked in the basement, for PlayStation at least, your screen will turn completely gray, or you‚Äôll fall through the floor.

Yo wtf how did I find you on reddit
---
I like running gimmick builds sometimes but I also want more variety for when I'm serious. I'm solo survivor so usually running the stronger stuff is necessary if I want a good time because running less than stellar perks just gets me killed early. I mostly just want a wider variety of perks. As survivor I feel like my options are far less than killer, mostly because survivors are basically skins and the perks aren't great for the most part. Then they finally have an opportunity to make a bad perk mildly useful (No Mither for Oni), then just made it not matter whether you're actually bleeding or not because you still produce blood orbs.
---

clear cache, restart ps4, start the update again

Ah my favorite killer the blenndet
---
I wish people would read patch notes before they start bitching about everything :)

Basically nemesis would bring back an actual power to the legion so that he wouldnt be a character without an M2 ability
---
Mostly just playing for fun, don't really care about reaching rank 1 since I've heard it's frustrating. I just wish i was able to use lower tier killers and do well, make good plays, stuff like that. Just playing to improve and try to have fun i guess.
---
That a lot of text for, ‚ÄúI want 4k, No escapies! Die now!‚Äù
---
Endgame doesn‚Äôt always result in a 100% escape. But slugging for the final kill makes it impossible for the last survivor to even have a chance. He either picks up the down survivor and the killer immediately downs one of the two then the other one falls quickly after. Or the survivor waits for his teammate to die so he has a chance to live or he just suicides because whatever.  Atleast endgame makes it a little bit exciting for the last survivor who can‚Äôt really do anything productive at that point. But the majority just cares about how the killers feel. God forbid the killer has to worry about losing the last survivor. But it‚Äôs really just a meme I like to make because it‚Äôs so common

You still leave blood orbs from what I've heard from everyone and I mean they didn't mention changing it

If it does its not intended - patch notes said that deep wounds is no longer connected to terror radius, and wont decrease while sprinting anyways
---
Yeah, I watch Otz, Fungoose, and Zubat, and i learn from them but at the same time it's kind of overwhelming since they make callouts at 200 MPH and I find it hard to learn what to do good by watching them do better then me lol.

---
The killer sees nothing unusual from their POV. The survivors screen turns grey and your character is continuously falling through the map and once you get unhooked you cant move or do anything the rest of the game since you're in a constant state of "falling"
---
I understand the frustration in that spawn placement, but I'm not sure what I was supposed to do in that specific situation. Like that was out of my control and the survivors control. That wasn't a game over moment for them, and I don't think the hate mail was warranted either.
---
Make ‚Äúplay with your food‚Äù the pufferfish eating a carrot.

My PC started to shut down after this update, when I either get down or hooked on Endgame Collapse.

It's pissing me off. Something similar happened last update, but it went away after a day or so.

Why is that?
---
A week or two? And you‚Äôre going to punish people who DC? This is game breaking, for both sides.
---
I didn't know I wanted this
---
I have played 20 games and just lost the first one, he is ok
---
That's funny, because Pig is miles better than Legion and honestly not a bad killer.
---
Trust me you just need to get used to it and learn how to use him
---
I strongly disagree. He seems to easily 4k each match I have against him.
---
Bill‚Äôs jumper is free, will already be in your customisation tab.
---
Bouncing off what some other people have said - early in the game if I get a survivor dropping pallets left and right I‚Äôll let them do it for a minute or so, then go around and destroy those pallets. From there you can try to herd survivors towards that area. If the dead zone you‚Äôve created is to the left, then instead of chasing the survivors from behind get on their right side and try to guide them into the area where all the pallets have already been broken.
---
LOL! This is my favorite so far
---
Maybe it was a glitch or something for me, but I'd stab someone holding a medkit or toolbox with frenzy and they would never drop it. It made me almost stop attacking with frenzy completely.
---
The new map is so annoying for killers it's so dark and has so much tall bamboo
---
It'll probably get bopped for "oversaturated meme content bandwagon" but yes
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion but you should not be punished for using a feature the Devs put in the game. If I chose to leave a match for whatever reason using the "leave game" option, I am using a game feature. Punishing someone for using your product and all it offers seems pretty shitty. We all paid for the game we should all be able to enjoy it how we see fit. Wanna camp and Tunnel as a Killer? Go ahead it's "a viable strategy." Wanna pallet loop, click flashlights and T-Bag? Go ahead it's all part of the useable gameplay features. It's all considered toxic to whatever side you main. Play how you want and Devs should just start giving BP gains on both sides and a handicap for when people DC.
---
awww thanks very much just some stuff i picked up here and there
---
Hotfix 3.4.1. is gonna fix all of what you listed. And it's launching soon, thankfully.
---
Poor doc
---
I don't understand why you're getting so worked up over a simple disagreement. I don't think playing like an asshole is okay. I'd wager the overwhelming majority of killer players think playing like an asshole isn't okay. I'm simply stating that more people are doing it than normal with the new killer because his kit is tailored towards it, and you're acting like I've besmirched some holy text passed down through generations of Insidious Bubbas who *desperately* want to justify their objectively scummy playstyle.
---
If you don't want me calling them out for playing like assholes, maybe they shouldn't play like assholes. Seems easy, right?
---
Mending is faster now too, you can also do objectives while in DW, nothing ever stopped you. Distressing wasn't worth it on Legion, M&amp;A is still decent, but that's just it being a good perk.
---
They literally have the PTB and you're asking if they test it?
---
Yeah I wasn't being literal I didn't have a stop watch or anything but yeah it was really shitty I wanted to DC but I had made good BP the match and I've never DC'd and I kinda take some pride in it.
---
Whats different about trapper?
---
Or dcs/suicide on hook/farming eachother
---
You could just go for someone else and let em unhook and then still get a 4K, they‚Äôre clearly noobs
---
fuck killer mains for wanting the win that they deserve
---
Not today, Thursday. The details are in the patch notes.
---
No i only play killer lol, haven‚Äôt been able to get a game at all today and I‚Äôve been waiting hours
---
When I play Trapper I set up my Traps before I start chasing Survivors into them. 
---
(Or step into them myself because for some reason their auras disappear when I get close to them)
---
Fairly decent advice. I would also add to run Unbreakable for a little while. He has to slug quite a bit so Unbreakable is very helpful.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main but seriously everyone needs to chill the fuck out with calling the other trash
---
Its fun when theres baby survivors and they just throw pallets because they think the killers close, but thats rare, also the occasional fatfinger fix
---
I totally replied to the wrong comment. Lol
---
Mine looks fine, maybe a shade darker. However my partner‚Äôs on the TV next to mine is incredibly dark and he was also complaining about not being able to see anything.
---
But idk what‚Äôs up.
---
At this point I hope they're just memeing, I get that it would screw you up if you played with stbfl or something like that but fuck me, if giving up that perk makes me able to jump windows and pallet faster and have overall a slighty better feral frenzy then sign me the fuck up.
---
Thank you!
---
Hey is that an actual cosmetic for head cause if it is then I might even switch from my sexy boi to another
---
I'm done with all these slugging memes. Slugging is slugging and in no way shape or form is it toxic. It's a strategy that you can use. Just like how genrushing and abusing infinites with certain perks is a strategy.
---
It‚Äôs a meme, 99% of the time any pallet worth using is gonna be broken right after it was thrown so you won‚Äôt get much mileage out of it. Ontop of that the animation can be interrupted by the killer and the cooldown is excruciatingly long. It‚Äôs fun to use in the same way Diversion is, it‚Äôs not gonna be useful most of the time but it‚Äôs fun and once in a blue moon you might get a nice play out of it.
---
Not gonna lie, I did that to a Claudette a few weeks ago.
---
 She pestered me with flashlight clicking the whole game while I was busy killing her teammates.
---
In the end I let her bleed out because the clicking was just THAT obnoxious. 
---
Longest 4 minutes in DBD ever.

Well I have the basement challenge so they can shut up.

Hey! Cheer up! You have unnerving presence to make those little survivors tremble before you!

Playing killer was a rather shit experience back then and when someone asked Cote how they plan to change that, he said they should play survivor or a different game like Civ.

I don't even know how they could rework Legion to be fun without removing the Deep Wound entierly which most likely won't happen looking on the fact that it was added with them.

Technically you bumped into the tree but yea it's dimb.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ love this
---
Hooked in the Sanctum of Wrath basement too?
---
Funny I just had someone dc on me
---
Why even bother messaging someone who's a toxic idiot? Doesn't make you look any better. Plus posts like these get removed because of the "shaming other players" rule.
---
Same, at least we haven‚Äôt gotten the dc penalty yet
---
Restart your console. The dlc launched this afternoon at 12:00 almost exactly. For some reason if stuff doesn‚Äôt show in the store completely restarting your console fixes it
---
Imagine not using mad grit all the time so you can machine gun spam your weapon while walking to the hook
---
I played at least 6 games today, none of them was the oni neither the new map.
---
I bought it through the in game store. Have you checked there?
---
Head to AppData\Local\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor, open GameUserSettings.ini in a text editor.
---
Set bUseVSync=False and FrameRateLimit=60.000000, replacing 60 with whatever you want your new cap to be.
---
If you want to uncap your framerate, open the Engine.ini in the same folder and add these lines:
---
    [/Script/Engine.Engine]
---
    bSmoothFrameRate=False
---
Then set FrameRateLimit=0.000000.
---
What? You thought people here would just take your side? You're beeing a bigger asshole than Jake is suposed to be
---
I've heard this issue with others so it must be a problem with the xbox part of dbd, it's not you so that's what's wrong
---
It‚Äôs frustrating for me too, as a rank 1 survivor. I don‚Äôt dodge lobbies with high rank survivors or anything, I just like to be aware. If I‚Äôm rank 1 and im thrown into a lobby with a 2 or 3 man swf where one or two is rank 14 or new, I‚Äôd like to know. It helps gauge how efficient they‚Äôll be during the trial and how much extra effort I‚Äôll have to put in. Not saying that rank matters, I‚Äôve seen some real kick ass players, but most of the time they‚Äôre newer and getting the hang of things still and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to know. I play with my best friends who are rank 12 and 18 and we get dodged occasionally since we‚Äôre playing in a rank 1-2 lobby, so I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs been changed.
---
My wiggle meter is gone, after getting hooked I was in the sky when unhook I was then falling on my screen the whole time but apparently sitting duck for the killer
---
What platform are you on if i may ask?
---
post it in this topic.
---
reported
---
Nah he's pretty dang good, he can use the blood to track survivors, rush across the map with no penalties at all and his ability to one shot I potent especially with some other perks. Imo he's billy without all the negatives of the chainsaw like bumping and etc
---
Pc
---
Much love for my fellow bubba players. It ain't easy, but it's honest work.
---
Technically no names were given, so as far we know this is staged.
---
Didn‚Äôt realize everyone else was experiencing this bug sorry for the over-saturation
---
Hes good, hes just jot easy to play. Give it some time.
---
I said the exact same thing. They definitely changed something because it was darker for me than normal as well.
---
Everyone with a brain thought that was what the new perk and No Mither would do in the first place.
---
That new perk is basically garbage because most killers don't even look for blood. Sure, it can make an ultimate stealth build when ran with Iron Will but not countering Oni is kind of trash.
---
K
---
It smells like salt
---
Don't forget solve world hunger and save the great barrier reef.
---
I dont understand the downvotes but its okay
---
If they changed since ptb, then no, it seems my information is dated.
---
That damn Laurie. God that makes me smile.
---
Hes right. Literally no one cares
---
I‚Äôm not going to change your mind you seem very biased and wouldn‚Äôt allow for any to change your mind so instead of wasting my breath more then this I‚Äôll go.
---
It wasnt. He went on after saying how rage quitting isnt toxic, it's just leaving
---
Think of it as rewarding early adopters.
---
&gt;It appears none of you do
---
'Wow everyone around me is driving on the wrong side of the road, the maniacs!'
---
Great shrine for survivor! But i'm already planning on buying the halloween chapter so..
---
I only play survivor and I don't even agree with this.
---
Not gonna try to change your mind cause there's no point lol
---
I play killer too and I can get 4ks without any perks, just proves u dont need perks with killers cause theyre OP.
---
of those 3 hags objectively the best and probably the most fun if you get good with her. m&amp;a is a good perk though, but you won‚Äôt win much with doctor at high ranks.
---
I don‚Äôt like that they removed it either. I‚Äôm in red ranks most months days after rank reset and have never dodged a lobby. I just like the information.
---
Like the concept, dont how how it would work on paper
---
Ah. Yeah, the survivor ques are better on there, but on Xbox killer ques take roughly 10 seconds or so. Sorry mate
---
lol
---
Yes this happened to me on Haddonfield. Seems to be happening a lot.
---
Ok boomer
---
Happened to me TWICE now. I didnt wanna abandon either cuz i dont want a ban...
---
His ability is practically useless. Your mobility is abysmal during dash. The demon strike on its own has a comically long charge. When you use the strike during the dash you can barely track survivors because you look so high up. Playability on console is not great. I‚Äôm going to up my sensitivity to 100 from 90 and see if it helps, but oof.
---
I cut out his name so it wouldn't show. I only decided to message him because I messaged one of the other survivors who played that round REALLY well, and then when I was done, I saw that guy and had another laugh.
---
The idea is to force the survivors into scenarios where they are forced to take risks and make mistakes.
---
If you chase a single survivor for a minute you WILL lose 2 or 3 generators against good survivors by the time you got him on the hook. 
---
But if you keep the pressure up against them, force them to work on unsafe generators, and dropping those precious pallets, sooner or later you will gain momentum and crush them.
---
If you don't care about "winning" or ranking up, feel free to chase survivors to your hearts content, you will get better at it that way.
---
In chases, learn how to hide your red stain and learn how to use it to lure survivors into your loving embrace.
---
No i watch survivors in my red ranked games run me around for 20 seconds and then when I catch then after 40 seconds and hook them 3 gens are done because 3 people are on gens while i chase somebody.
---
Maybe the fact that he doesn't bump into objects and is not limited to moving in mostly a straight line.
---
O no, a killer main üôÑ
---
That‚Äôs because you did it too early
---
I consistently get 4ks with him and do very well when I don't. You have to use the right perks, he's not someone you just slap the usual perks onto
---
It‚Äôs obviously not a hard counter, but 60% smaller from Unnerving is a substantial difference.
---
meme flood are only welcome if they are actually good, not someone drew pink hair and called it nea
---
It's 8 seconds if somebody else mends you.
---
And the new is barely more ignorable. I guess you can run to where you want to go and mend instead of mending and then running to where you want to go. 
---
Running pausing the timer instead of TR doesn't seem like a big deal except against Freddy.
---
Don't touch my beautiful Meg! She's perfect just the way she is.

Same for pc
---
I was just hoping Myers would find me again so they could all run out but it was a bit shitty cos i had a challenge where you need to deplete a key and i had like 2 seconds left on it. fml
---
What you didn't notice though, is that there are approximately 27 P3 blendettes in this picture.
---
good, the content was trash anyway only reason people did it was for karma
---
Its out on console tho
---
Yes, we asked for legion changes but we wanted them to be an overall buff. Instead they've just made them even less unique.
---
Nope. I main survivor. Nice try though
---
nothing because its not her lmao? why the fuck would it stun her.
---
Really ?! That sucks even more, since you guys got the dc penalty, it‚Äôs dc or wait until the game ends
---
No; it‚Äôs awful. What the fuck are you on about?
---
This is only possible because following scratch marks on Ormond is actually cancer.
---
Mentioning your names wasnt an invitation for a backstory, first off. Second, and how this has to be explained is beyond me, a name and a flair specifically related to survivors IS SURVIVOR BASED. If you think otherwise, you deserve Olympic gold for your skills in mental gymnastics.
---
Solo survivor is so hard as is and they just continue to make it harder. That was the one thing that at least gave me some measure of hope when queuing up. I don't want to be rank 9 with rank 15 teammates, its not like there is a lack of rank 15 teammates you could match them with instead considering I get in to lobbies with unique ones all the goddamn time.
---
everyone basically has permanent exposed status for the whole game what do you mean bullying a poor oni lmao
---
I literally just fully leveled Laurie for DS Last night lmao. Could have saved so many blood points.
---
Lol thanks.
---
It's really no one's ego. Sort this sub by new, and you'll see the BS survivors see.
---
You dont have to fully charge it for the insta down. Its regular charge time is like 4 seconds but you dont have to hold it down that long.
---
He's limited to when he can use his power and how much control over it he has. Sure he can technically not bump but that doesn't matter if they hug the rock
---
But he‚Äôs fucking terrible. Barely useable on console
---
I think a maybe fix to this would be putting two entrances in the basement so you would not have to run at the killer to get out
---
I‚Äôll make sure to remember that next time my survs spawn in injured
---
Poh-tay-toes
---
Had a game where the killer kept slugging the other person and then searching for me. I revived them three times in a row instead of staying at the hatch. The killer finally caught me and the other person went down like 2 seconds later. It was annoying as hell. I either keep reviving and eventually die, or stay at the hatch and be seen as the asshole survivor.
---
I have escaped all my matches against him easily. I have seen two Onis out of 4 even land their attacks
---
This patch much to no ones surprise is an absolute mess of buggy nonsense.
---
Same hahahaha Dank By Daylight is key.
---
Probably a console bug. They dont care about us üòå
---
Other players can still see you but if you chill and get downed again once you're picked up it should fix itself, friend had similar issue
---
1. Wtf do you mean 'quid pro quo'? That has no relevance to what you're talking about
---
2. You complimented another player, thats great! But that doesn't change the fact that you went out of your way to message this guy and be toxic. I don't care how funny you thought this DC was, you made the choice to message them instead of moving on
---
It helps with planning a route, or judging how a survivor might try to run away from you
---
People mention certain screams but I‚Äôve seen almost no one mention Nancy‚Äôs scream. That thing is incredibly close to the PTB Kate scream. I thought Meg‚Äôs was the worst until she came along.
---
Yeah and he's not very good. I'm hoping with practice he'll become a threat but idk. Hard to judge on the first day but I don't think a controller agrees with him.
---
Im amazed at your idiocy. "You cant reason with an idiot who thinks their right"
---
Im done trying to get through your thick skull
---
Happened to me earlier today
---
bbq stack in exchange for queue times doesn't seem like a good trade for you but whatever i guess

I don't get it. Are people actually advocating for old Legion to come back? That's dumb as fuck. He needs a rework/help but certainly not the old version
---
ZE WOLDO!
---
That‚Äôs how it works but ya know need that 4K so might aswell billy for awhile
---
how long is it going to take killers to understand that every tiny nerf to a killer doesnt gut them. It happened with nurse, spirit, and now oni. he is still good, just more fair.
---
It's a good question. The body is left behind, if the killer is standing under a pallet, tries phasing and the pallet is dropped, it should violently bring them back to the body, stunned.
---
I liked seeing peoples character and prestige levels :(
---
I don't remember having to do this before when Ghostface or Stranger Things were put out... Or any other DLC for any other game. Usually I'll see it in the store eventually. 
---
Restarting it should have been a first step bit I also had to wait for the patch download anyway
---
Awfully bold of you to call someone else an idiot when you dont know the difference between their, there, and they're lmao.
---
How do you ensure it lights up? Is that a different part of the code or is there a second icon?
---
Yeah I know that. It‚Äôs still longer than a normal lunge. Saying otherwise is just blatantly lying. And, again, you lose a significant amount of your maneuverability.
---
He‚Äôs going to go the way of Demogorgon. No one will play him because his power is so bad and survivor mains will make believe he‚Äôs actually super strong
---
Legion just needs a total power rework. Keep Deep Wounds exclusive to BT and the purple med-kit add-on.
---
Admit it. You still laugh and think "dumb bitch" but then realize you are the dumbest bitch of all. Or maybe that's just me.
---
You can buy original killer cosmetics using shards (not all cosmetics). This includes the Oni.
---
\*Cries in Bubba\*
---
IS THAT DED 'ARD?
---
Family photo!!!!
---
Tried playing the game on 3 tabs of acid a month ago too lol, that was an experience
---
OH NO! SOMEBODY DOESNT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT GRAMMAR ON THE INTERNET
---
I feel like his one shot is super easy to dodge.
---
Got it, Its there now. 
---
FFS
---
He‚Äôs bad. His power is barely useable
---
Haha good joke.
---
I see you're one of those players that think that because a killer is hard to play they are trash. 
---
I guess Nurse is bad on console as well?
---
This is the only killer adept in the history of the game I didn't get first try lol It spooked me
---
&gt; I don't think playing like an asshole is okay.
---
The crux of your argument is that "The Killer played like an asshole." This is wholly an opinion. You state your opinion as if it's fact, as if it gives you the right to judge your opponent.
---
And you completely ignore the two main points I put forward:
---
-  No one gets to dictate how another person plays within the game mechanics.
---
You are trying to shame your opponent for playing within the mechanics provided by the game, and thereby imply that they shouldn't do this.
---
- Your opponent trying to win is not toxic.
---
You are saying your opponent is an asshole (read: Toxic) because they are playing in an optimal way towards winning.
---
Those are two basic tenants of any competitive game. More so because they are neutral. I never specified survivor or killer here. No one gets to tell you how to play your game and you don't get to tell anyone else how to play their game.
---
So you're an asshole who's trying to shame your opponent just because **YOU** have this insane idea that they should play a certain way based on your made-up rules.
---
It's like you're trying to tell your opponent in Monopoly to not buy property. Or to not make 3-point shots in Basketball.
---
And yet, you somehow don't realize that you're the asshole in all this. You think it's just fine and fair that you try to shame other people for not following your made-up rules.
---
Also - Objectively means "in a way that is not influenced by personal feelings or opinions." You are anything but objective. You're an entitled, hypocritical, crybaby. Your whole post is based on the fact that you have an opinion and you want to cry and scream on that opinion.
---
So you're not "calling them out for playing like assholes." You're crying that they beat you in a video game because they didn't play by your rules.
---
You're nothing more than a crybaby and an asshole at that. Stop throwing a tantrum.
---
Well no one is as bad as you and has a very biased and shitty opinion as you, suck it up buttercup you lost this one lol.
---
Perhaps. We will see tho
---
I got 4 man escapes in all of my matches against him except 1.
---
A CIGAR???
---
Bill would never.
---
Never played it or know what it‚Äôs about but I like the trapper mask.
---
It speaks volumes sport :)
---
If only they ran unbreakable
---
it would be neat, but useless. All they need to do is not phase literally ontop of the pallet and its avoided. worthless.
---
how do you earn shards
---
Single greatest comment
---
Oh man. I can‚Äôt even imagine. I‚Äôve watch someone play Left for Dead on acid and that was a whole other kind of wild. Like a swarm coming at you in a cornfield is insane.
---
1) quid pro quo means you give some you get some. You give some toxicity, you can get some in return.
---
2) You aren't wrong, and I don't regret my choice. I got an even nicer laugh after, so it was worth it to me. If he didn't want the toxicity, he shouldn't have dished it out to start.
---
How did they go from the fun and useful perks of Nancy/Steve to this? Way too situational and with insanely long cool down. A step back in my opinion.
---
I noticed lithe works while in dying state today after taking a hit during a vault through a window.
---
I mean when you call someone an idiot you have to make sure you don‚Äôt look like one yourself and bad grammar makes you look like an idiot. 
---
I‚Äôm not here to agree with any of this discussion you guys have but just here to say that.
---
Hostage Doc.

You set up a 3-gen on The Game with Overcharge, Distressing, and Unnerving Presence.

You earn them by just playing the game. You raise your devotion level each game and when you go up a level you get shards.
---
It is. I think it might be different for people on PC versus console because good god is his power easy to counter on console. No viability at loops at all
---
I totally agree with you. It's useful information on both sides. When you're playing Survivor and have an inexperienced player on your team it's good to know in advance. I used it to help them out in matches and as a Killer I would be brutal to a new player. Now you never know what to expect.
---
Literally every third post is what they‚Äôre talking about. Has nothing to do with egos lmfao.
---
k.
---
Nope they completely changed Legion to make it so they don't with nemesis as deep wounds know only goes down when not sprinting or mending
---
you are right missed that, im not arguing deeps wounds isnt a bad debuff im arguing the timer is useless, 
---
running pauses the timer and u can run forever so is there really even a timer
---
I wish the flashlight was a pallet. Still funny tho
---
Ik it‚Äôs already a shit perk they least they can do is make it so you don‚Äôt bleed imo if you willing to be one hit. Litteraly the only good thing about it is being able to get up on your own. I wonder how it would be to run no mither unbreakable and taps crawl and recover perk
---
Unfortunately people correlate hard to play with a weak killer.
---
I'm unsure if they did either.
---
Yep, and Save the Best for Last.
---
Make survivors that dont bleed not drop orbs, make survivors with hemmorage drop more.
---
That sucks
---
speaking of which, do you have any tips to not getting hooked for the entire game? that challenge has been kicking my ass.

Ones a shittier version. Hillbilly doesn't need to collect orbs to chainsaw people. Oni is like a hybrid of Myers and Hillbilly only I much rather play Myers or Hillbilly.
---
How's that shilling? He's just simply pointing out that these things aren't as easy as flipping a switch. The issue is known, they're well aware, now they just need to fix it.
---
It'd be pretty hard to manage that, since you still don't know what Killer is going to show up.
---
In the event of Stream Sniping, I don't think the Devs really care about that.
---
Amen brother
---
Same here since PS+! Got two survivors with all the perks (both my only P3), and all killers to level 30 (35 for Bubba for BBQ). I bought all the licensed DLC, got a few paid skins, and to top it off, I'd rather play survivor with a PS4 controller. I have a crappy laptop that runs the game at like 10-30fps, and I play survivor with my controller. I only really wanna switch for killer because I suck at anything first person on console. I have to play it on my laptop when I'm visiting my parents, so I literally have one character at 40 and that's it. I'm too scared to try killer with that fps too.
---
*Surprised pikachu face*
---
Well thats kind of what I'm getting at. And its my fault for buying him without doing my research, but ive played 3 matches with him and he just seems like a worse hillbilly. 
---
Did we really need him?
---
Even worse is his regular M1 in demon mode feels like EW1 Myers lunge.
---
So actually going into his power actually feels like a bad move.
---
well now you have extra shards to buy the new killer and survivor!
---
You may have something here chief. Make sure to screenshot this so you may say you predicted the future if all 4 of them get blighted skins.
---
It was a big deal with nemesis on legion.
---
Are saying Oni is the shittier version cause you're wrong
---
Well to be fair most of them are books
---
Big Boi Oni needs to smack people with his katana and gather blood to charge his ability allowing him to basically do a Hillbilly dash without the negative of stopping when bumping into things, also he can down multiple people in a single charge not having to do multiple to down everyone.
---
Your justification for being toxic is that they were toxic first. That's some playground logic if I've ever seen it
---
I just wish they'd add dedicated servers to console
---
Hillbilly is better than Oni. I don't care what you say. My opinion won't change.

Well yeah, but if they do, then they should get punished for being stupid. Survivors get punished if they do stupid shit
---
My opinion is mostly from playing against him.
---
Hey... What's wrong with trap daddy? 
---
You know... Aside from the fact that his main power can get disabled with a tool box, that he needs to walk all over the map to gather his traps, that he only can carry one at a time without add ons and that SWF can call out traps ... 
---
... I still like him.
---
I mean if I'm devotion 16 I should be XD
---
Harrah for having even more players that use ds
---
And whats the item? I dont even know what Im looking for
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused Survivor ranks to be visible in the online lobby to other Survivors.
---
Big middle finger to solo-queue. Don't know why they got rid of that.
---
&gt; Updated several Killer perks with the Undetectable status effect: Insidious, Beast of Prey, Dark Devotion and Tinkerer.¬†
---
No clue who thought it was a good idea to buff insidious camping. I love this game but I swear the devs make the weirdest decisions
---
Feel like it would work like freddys teleport to gens but with lockers that also attacks survivors automatically
---
there are multiple streamers who use them, no one has ever been banned for using these. if they were banned it was probably due to something else

But the no logic behind your opinion but whatever you say peppa pig

It was literally uncounterable? If you got stunned with deep wound on that survivor there‚Äôs nothing the survivor could do. Zero counterplay.  
---
I don‚Äôt understand that people are surprised about this.
---
No killer solely has to run bbq and pop to stay alive but if what your saying legion has to stick to one build just to be viable. That‚Äôs not how a killer should work. A killer should be able to still perform well without perks and add ons.
---
Well I guess I'm bringing out my agitation and iron grasp build again.
---
Fuckin Straya, represent.
---
Oh shit I gotta try this. Very cool!
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
I think I just have to work on the turn radius and the charge time of the attack
---
Depends if your console or PC the ability

to move the mouse to make swift movements really change how good he is
---
Impossible skillcheck doctor, now with Obedience on top of Calm?
---
I can actually forsee class 3 obedience being arguably better than carter's notes or iri king, as more randomness in the side at which a skillcheck appears will likely be stronger at throwing off survivors.
---
M1 perks no longer work with Frenzy
---
I swear The Doctor reminds me of one of Stephen king‚Äôs book called Revival,
---
The concept is almost similar except the guy in the book heals ppl
---
Damn I almost missed Detective lmao
---
Yea he did. They still changed is his kit a lot which is why I referred to it as a rework but it was definitely a big nerf. He was kinda bullshit before but they definitely were too harsh with the nerf as well as nerfing him again

Inner strength is a blessing against SB

no. not even. you have no idea what kind of players you're going to run into when you're playing. there's a ranking system for a reason, you shouldn't be smurfing for easy wins and you shouldn't be getting 4k's every game you play. there's absolutely no reason for you to win every game. granted it would be nice, but that would make nobody want to play survivor. your devotion has nothing to do with your skill.
---
I disagree alot with that statement but I won't judge you as we all have different playstyles and for you Hillbilly might be better but for me it's Oni but yea you summed up Oni decently well
---
It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúKnown glitch, will be fixed in two weeks‚Äù it‚Äôs super OP
---
I'd be jealous.

And you got all the shitty perks in all your bloodwebs PepeHands

I used all my shards on their cosmetics, RIP.

I'm hoping for a complete rehaul, Freddy style. 
---
I can wait.
---
Forgive me, Father.
---
She doesn‚Äôt leave phase but it does destroy the husk iirc
---
The basement is a death void right now, you can get out of the void but it will take a reaaally long time to get out of it, the killer will most likely kill you before the void decides to let you go. Stay away from the basement at all costs
---
What where the fixes?
---
I'm godly at looping. they've given up on me. but for some god awful reason right at the End of the game I just turn into a potato and get backpedaled with no gens left. instantly hooked.
---
you must be new here
---
Hopefully when they rework Legion they'll just remove Deep Wounds. It's a terribly designed status effect that no one enjoys.
---
Sure. Let me just make sure I get to do a gen in the perfect spot. Awesome tip.
---
This just happened to me too! I fell through the bottom of the level when I got hooked in the basement!
---
Jesus Christ your build
---
You really do not understand that this is meant to be a TEAM GAME with COOPERATION also keys are overpowered because think about you stomped a team into the ground there is one left you are able to deny them their second chance and while you are making sure they cant utilise their third chance they just pull a trump card because they ran an item that has no counter to it and should be changed.
---
(Also sidenote the green key is for aura reading with add-ons exclusively thats why it has double the charges of a purple which is specifically made for the hatch and the ultra rare one being the best of both worlds)
---
It‚Äôs in the known bugs list. To be fixed before Christmas in the least. For now just stay away from the basement as much as possible and preserve the god pallet
---
&gt; or the killers
---
Im newer to the game, but is this why I see killer mains on streams bitch about dedicated servers?  This has to be the only community/game where I've seen people complain against dedicated servers instead of p2p/player hosted.  No wonder now though, the killers used to be at an advantage.
---
Doesn't include Dante from devil may cry, 0/10
---
Myself and another player just posted about this, I'm on PC personally. I think the character models are falling through the floor in some cases.
---
Lol I was so confusedüòÇ even in second stage I don‚Äôt have to steuggle haha
---
Had the same problem earlier today
---
You can flick still, however idk if the sensitivity on console is high enough to make use of it
---
This shit is so annoying. Most killers are doing it to get free kills and troll and worst part is you can‚Äôt even kill yourself on hook
---
Have you heard about the basement bug?
---
I'll have to mess around with him some more, maybe at higher level play there is a bigger difference?
---
Killer does well in a game? Too OP!!!! Nerf immediately!!
---
"I can see you bitch"
---
Was the person you kept getting back up a Nancy with potato in there name? Lmao
---
The only real benefit is that you would already be uncloaked so it is easier to get a hit, where as they have been able to get to a pallet. It's a gimmick build, as insidious can basically only be used for camping things in general
---
i dont play doctor, are these new changes? is there a link for the full notes?
---
If you have teammates left maybe just sit close to a gate ironwill could help too
---
Hold on give him a week or so mate. 
---
Let people figure out what‚Äôs good and bad on him, what the counter is etc.
---
His speed and terror radius make him op.
---
I never heard tru3 call anyone that specifically when they disagree with him.  I‚Äôve personally disagreed with him on stream about how low he rates billy, he had a kinda condescending matter or fact tone when he addressed me, but he didn‚Äôt call me names or anything.
---
I kinda agree but don't also as he just came out meaning everyone sucks against him but he will still be very strong I think. It's best to wait a week or two to get used to him then give your opinion instead of saying Nerf him or don't nerf or whatever
---
I'll try it. thanks for the tip.
---
Me hiding from the killer with decisive strike active
---
I‚Äôve played against him twice today and both times he got a 1k lol
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5s8l9/this_bug_is_really_something/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Use your power as soon as you get it - loop as you would normally and charge your M1 hits as soon as you approach a pallet - either you break the pallet or keep charging the attack and hit them - i use sloppy, bbq, ruin and pop however i feel the best build for him would be 
---
Monitor and abuse, thana, ruin and sloppy
---
Also your charge is like legion FF - stop when near a survivor and you will hit them easily or if you get a good position just use it
---
Dont try to use your charge in loops - IT doesnt work use your charge for covering distance and your charged M1 for loops
---
What are you talking about? Lol it's to prevent him from absorbing more of your blood to get his power and it would help the onj in the chance he is actually slugging
---
Ive seen people overreact defending tru3 as well.
---
Right after the game. I was really mad and salty. But i really do think he is overtunned ik I exaggerated.
---
That's why I suggested that it requires time just like doing a gen or opening a door. Keys that opens the hatch directly are indeed OP and require no skill at all. Also, I agree that it is a team game, but for solo queuers there's no way to communicate: no chat, no voice comms. Many players play selfishly and thinking the way you do, that if there's not perfect coordination then you deserve to die, makes for an incredibly shitty experience for us solo queuers.
---
Legion needs more nerfs /s
---
He got some buffs but he also got some nerfs. Frenzy hits no longer apply any perks that apply from basics (Sloppy, StBfL, etc), and mending time was reduced overall.
---
I bet you think legion is op too
---
The real shit build is PWYF and nemesis
---
aaaah my boy legion and doctor look so nice here! i adore this!
---
4 people tried to blame me for their bad game because i presumably did it on purpose - yes its their ego and it Hurts badly
---
No lol i think he is annoying but not op
---
Killers take one look at this guy and probably turn the other way. Either out of fear at how angry he looks or feel bad cuz hes thinking to hard.
---
I mean 6 a week is still an improvement over the 4 a week we get now, but I really don't think 8 a week is overkill. It's not like the average person is saving up 16k shards a week, and if you are you probably don't need the shrine to get teachables. Plus we have well over triple the teachables we did when the shrine first launched, so double your options/chances to get something you want seemed reasonable to me
---
The king 
---
He streams on twitch and he's had a couple of slip up moments
---
Ah, yes, the mending nerfs and the on-hit no longer applying is a buff?
---
The trapper has become the trapped
---
It happens
---
I find the new map to be really dark also it‚Äôs hard to see on it
---
Legion is annoying lol not op
---
Same for me with Leatherface! Well you can still use his Bloody face with the sweater to show off :)
---
That'd interesting to say the least I mean it give build more variety but it could lead to many op build being made could be a watered down version maybe?
---
Play what you like! I'm love my bing bongo boi but god knows hes not amazing putting out a lot of pressure. But still so fun.
---
I honestly don't understand some killer mains lol
---
welcome to the club lol
---
Legion is very annoying to play against but he‚Äôs one if not the worst killer In the game his skill is useless against good survivors that can just loop you for  3 gens the survivor will go down eventually if he doesn‚Äôt mend but by then most gens will be completed he just needs a total re work.
---
I'll try and keep that in mind. Trying to hit someone with his insta feels like you put get nurse exhaustion, whether you hit or miss.
---
He just has weird timings and lunge distances. I'm used to abuse given how much I play trapper but I'm still getting eaten alive at green ranks lol.
---
Nothing feels worse than losing to teams you can beat with trapper üòñ
---
Just give trapper infinite bear traps
---
To be fair, 90% of those posts are coming from 1 guy.
---
I mean... BBQ has a visual glitch that one time...
---
Why not 6, 7, 8, 9, 10? Then the game wouldn't be the same anymore. The limitations add to the thrill and excitement.
---
Yea I know just chill a little and play against him as that'll allow you to accurately judge him as that's better then only playing against them once and having a bad match

Because instead of making it where nemesis doesn‚Äôt effect deep wounds they completely reworked the deep wounds status effect when it didn‚Äôt need to be touched. The problem was the perk not the mechanic.

This is so cool! Good to know I inspired something haha. I actually really like that these portraits have a sort of dark and foreboding feel for most of the survivors. Jane is my favorite. Now THAT looks like a woman who‚Äôs afraid of getting murdered lol
---
New killer: the mask face
---
A rule of thumb when it comes to distinguishing whether or not a chase is worth it is:
---
1) How long the chase has already been going on for  
---
2) How many pallets/windows the survivor has around them  
---
3) Is the loop they're at safe  
---
4) The condition of the survivor (did they use an exhaustion perk, are they injured, etc.)  
---
If you've been chasing someone for half a minute, they've dropped a pallet and have one more nearby, and the loop they're at is relatively safe, it's usually better to abandon the chase and go somewhere else. For Clown, if you've thrown one or two bottle and they still have a significant distance or relative safety to you, usually best to end the chase. Also, **never reload as Clown while in a chase unless you want to end it**. For Legion, especially if you're in Frenzy, if you can't hit them but someone is nearby, temporarily break chase - it's better to apply Deep Wounds on two survivors rather than one and get looped by a third. Trapper, well, I don't play much of him, but one thing that catches survivors out easily is faking putting down traps. This can make them abandon the loop altogether. Just **never** put the trap in the middle of the pallet, as survivors can just drop the pallet and vault over it to negate it completely.
---
Another thing, if you get stunned by a pallet drop and the survivor has another pallet nearby that they start running to, **don't break the pallet you got stunned by**. You're giving them even more distance. You can always return and kick the pallet after you down/hook them, and if someone picked up the pallet, that's fine, because they'll at least have one less pallet to worry about.
---
As for Ghostface, one common thing I see Ghostfaces doing is 99% survivors that they don't want to chase or are too far away. Next time you come across them, just pop your power, stalk them, get close, and stabby.
---
I wish. I'm just a scrubby nub.
---
I have had 2 versions of this.
---
1: Wiggle option doesn‚Äôt pop up until 3-5 seconds after pick up.
---
2: Wiggle bar doesn‚Äôt go up
---
I guess your just going to completely disregard the infinite haste bug that was here for 2+ patches lmao
---
There should be a bug that gives you 100,000 bp for gens completed and 200,000 for hook saves lol
---
I feel like ghostface would be the one to think of it
---
That is quite a shit show you described there.
---
That's literally the only way to guarentee a 4K. No matter how horribly shit the survivors are and how little gens they get done, if you sacrifice the 3rd guy, the fourth will have a chance to escape.
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of running a hex. They are powerful as fuck. Risk / reward.
---
To be honest I'm okay with that. I was a nurse main when I wanted to constantly destroy groups but now I'm just bing bonging my way having a good time hoping I scare some survivors and not worried about winning or losing too much. Much more relaxed.
---
Oh wow, I didn‚Äôt know there‚Äôs so many posts about this already. I usually sorted by popular post, so I didn‚Äôt know that this has been an ongoing bug.
---
I mean i know behavior took FOREVER to fix infinites. Look at the game in 2016. But i say abuse the crap out of it so more and more people get pissed
---
It likely spawns her next to them, or they temporarily clip through one another like after gettimg hit.
---
Yea the attack part seems bad should just reveal their aura to the killer only
---
That happened to me today aswell every time I got unhooked I was just chased didn‚Äôt even have time to heal
---
Never said it was perfect but Survivors have a full 360 degree view take advantage of that and if you really don't want to be jumpscared run Spine Chill it makes his job so much more difficult, without Nightshroud he's just a standard Killer.
---
He is insanely strong - i am running addonless right now and it hurts to see how op you can get with just the right perks
---
I feel like his charge instadown isnt necessary but i like him where he is now , GL and dont forget to tell me how you did
---
All I have to say is yes
---
Happy cake day to myself  üéÇ
---
On dbd*

I didn‚Äôt even know that this is an ongoing bug, I was just so confused why my screen turned all white lol

I heard there was a bug that if a survivor is close to the killer you can‚Äôt wiggle

---
You'd think so. So far, 2 wraiths and a doctor :s
---
I'm a rank 5 killer and rank 4 survivor. He gets bullied at red ranks. His demon strike is easy to juke.
---
Wow,you're a real dumbass.
---
Kinda funny now seeing your flair as it was a GF in the last match who let me slugged, moved 5 meters away and went straight back to me
---
Well i barely watch'd dbd's reddit so yeah my bad to be part of them.
---
A spirit did that today, I guess people just need quick games and quick points to level up Oni
---
Ruin being a plain perk would ruin the game for new players
---
&gt;I actually love Yamaoka as survivor. So many hiding places! I'm really enjoying the new map too.
---
This is precisely why both maps suck. If you are an active player and looper, it might be annoying to find pallets and if you are a killer you have to deal with boring stealthy players.
---
Well see heres the thing if you have done enough gens to atleast show your team was doing what they were supposed to be doing you could be observant and see the hatch before it opens and trust me that not only rewards you for doing the objective regardless of the exit gates being powered but also its easier for the survivors to notice since playing survivor is a lot less stressful than playing killer ask anyone who plays both, (which in my personal opinion should be the other way around but thats a topic for another day) you will get an early warning that the killer is gonna hook the survivor since you will see them being picked up which is when you know to start looking (which again if you were doing the objective should already have spawned by now) you can get to the hatch and it is survivor sided since survivors can jump in before the killer can close it if they are both standing on top of it.
---
But all of this is pointless since this is a 4v1 game so it needs to be balance to that so 4 survs equals 1 killer so obviously with 3 dead it SHOULD be massively in the killers favour THEY ARE THE FUCKING KILLER AND THIS IS COMING FROM A SURVIVOR MAIN
---
Thank you! I appreciate it!
---
You‚Äôve activated my trap card

‚ÄúNo U‚Äù

Nope it's super dark. And it looks like they darkened the family residence too.

I had no wiggle bar in my last game i was so scared he would hook me in the basement and id glitch out üò≠

Just relax and try to keep in mind what i told you, also Oni doesnt need to slug now so that's really fun

Low quality bait. I rate 0/8 looks like bait ain't your fate mate

that was a completely different situation. that was their pov on a mechanic of the game at the time. their pov has changed a lot since then. but this is purely a bug.

Yes, as I said, you did it too early. You need to wait for the animation to

FF no longer triggers STBFL, Sloppy etc... and deep wounds got super buffered on the surv side. The nerfs really out-way the buffs.

play the game more and you'll earn enough to buy a cosmetic. cosmetics aren't exactly the most important part of the game though. most us have just been playing long enough that we said fuck it and threw a bunch of money at the game because we enjoy it.

---
Seems so! His sound was bugged in a game I just placed, he didn't make any noise when taking a swing, damaging/breaking gens and pallets or shocking someone so I don't know if they've messed him up somehow
---
In today's update.
---
*sad misshapen noises*
---
It would be if they allowed pallets to stun dumb spirits that try phasing while standing under a pallet. The body is still getting hit, it should still do something.
---
FUCK YOU UGLY DEVS YOU BETTER FIX YOUR BROKEN ASS GAME
---
So sorry, there isn‚Äôt :( console is always horrible for anything even slightly related to modding ;-;
---
oh you were saying the change of running vrs terror radius hurt his play style, yea i agree what you said could been read either way
---
It was counterable. Don‚Äôt stun them. Why is everyone skipping over that part and just assuming the survivor simply has to stun the killer? Like I get this sub‚Äôs poster boy put out a rushed video and that cast the die but shit man am I the only one seeing this? 
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter now. What‚Äôs done is done. All I can do now is throw points into Legion every so often and wait in hopes they are one day not a pain in the ass to play.
---
It may have been. I can't remember too well.
---
Waist high grass is my natrual habitat
---
The I√±upiaq
---
Yea so killers should just play on easy made while the survivor has to pull of a miracle or let his teammate just die. Because most survivors know your very unlikely to get the save anyway and still be able to live. When you do that your practically telling the survivor to just die. They have a way to escape because it makes the game fun. They aren‚Äôt guaranteed to escape.
---
Assuming everyone can only have 1 perk, DS or borrowed. Most likely DS because if nobody has an obsession perk its camp and tunnel city.
---
Nooo üò≠ thank you for letting me know tho, enjoy your game!! If i ever get it on PC, I might have to come back and ask you ü§£
---
this happened to me too! except on was on the hook in the basement lol
---
yea like for each person he stabs during his power he gets buffs when it ends. so stabing all 5 survs would give the most buffs, not sure what they could be though
---
What‚Äôs the basement glitch?
---
Why are people only mad about billy and wraith but not demogorgon? He‚Äôs level 1 too, guys!!
---
Anyone else is being driven mad by the potato team members on Switch? I had one game where no one got rescued and the killer wasn't even camping or people throwing themselves at a camper without coordination

I didn't say it was a good trade

That‚Äôs also a good one, but with it‚Äôs nerf it‚Äôs a lot less reliable
---
When u hook survivors in the basement, they fall through the map forever, but are seen normally for killer.
---
Oh i thought you meant you should be able to open the hatch without a key and a key should still be instant from the way you worded it, my mistake. And trust me i dont think having imperfect coordination should equal you die im a solo queue survivor main myself and i almost never run swf but what i think they should do is add game chat like you said but also player should have a bit of game sense and try and make educated guesses of what their team is doing and try to make the right descisions based off experience, like if you have the feeling that gens arent being worked on you pick up the slack and even if they are you should still be applying pressure on the killer by doing gens together (for those sweet coop point especially with Prove Thyself) or in another area so if the killer does find you that means that there is another gen thats is still being done uninterrupted. I know these arent perfect solutions and to be fair i dont know what are since its hard to balance interactions with teams with communication and coordination and teams with no coordination or cooperation whatsoever

---
I like playing as legion because feral frenzy feels very fun to use but playing against them is absolutely obnoxious. They're like the Doctor, they were designed to purposefully incredibly irritating and annoying, even if they arent very good.
---
Their power isnt actually lethal but it has very low counterplay. Once they use it you are pretty much guaranteed to get hit unless they suck and get 360'd or window juked. 
---
Standing still mending is never fun, it is just boring gameplay. Since their power is only good at game slowdown, legion is encouraged to take thanataphobia/dying light slowdown builds which just means more time as survivor spent standing around holding M1 being bored. The gray out you get on your screen when you need to mend is also obnoxious and makes it difficult to even see what is going on.
---
Add this with the story and the visuals of the killer basically appealing edgy 14 year old hot topic losers with purple hair and you get an easily hateable killer.
---
Try ranking up as killer while playing poorly.
---
Then go back to playing survivor and try playing poorly. See which role ranks up faster, cuz I guarantee that it'll be survivor.
---
At first, I didn't get it.
---
I saw a version of that meme with steve and now whenever I hear "you dumb bitch" I think of smug steve
---
So original...  your like the only 1 to post this... wow how did you ever find this unique bug?
---
I mean you could not stun him and drop early
---
My other one got suspended, u think I care?
---
I'm console. I had a feeling it made a difference but tbh it seems more like I just can't ever turn enough
---
Sounds like a lighting fart.
---
Cause tru3 babbles stupid shit live without realizing it. Constant complaining and bitching while requesting for survivor nerfs. Meanwhile at the end of the day he massacred nearly everyone he came up against with a "low tier" killer in his recent video. Not to mention his spirit theory crafting saying this is how to win and his toxic fanbase attacking Scott cause of a video dismissing his theory crafting.
---
Dude.... how about you literally just look at the first 5 posts on the FRONT PAGE of the reddit....   
---
This seriously has been posted 100 times already.  WE GET IT
---
Have you seen the exploits in the oldest versions of dbd? The game was unplayable for killer because survivors had so many broken things to abuse.
---
The great gen in the sky
---
https://youtu.be/Qj4ue37NWcw
---
Downvoting....   this is just getting annoying at this point
---
No problem! Glad I could help in some way.
---
I think it would be pretty cool, and be on par with Hex ruin, since Survivors would be discouraged from working together until the totem is gone.
---
but i allready paid for the game
---
I had the happen to me litteraly a few days ago GF had me slicked and was just crouching hiding behind shit following me as I crawled away from my teammate
---
Are you the entity?
---
Being unstunnable is considered op there isn't even a perk for that, there are 2 that help. It is not an intended part of legions power.
---
they nerfed it
---
You can‚Äôt dash and turn with it. Nerfed that way. But yea I‚Äôd also like to know
---
that's exactly what happened to me last time. I couldn't wiggle so he took me to basement, then I was in some skyworld constantly in falling animation, even after unhooked.
---
Self-care, but relying on teammates usually ends with me not being healed and being chased by the killer again.
---
My bruv u/HatchAttack19 likes remote Alaskan tribes
---
Oh nice. That looks pretty good. I guess they learned from Nancy‚Äôs terrible P3. 
---
Also, why did he make a 6-7 min video of a sped up blood web grind? Lol
---
As someone who still hasn‚Äôt bought the game, I‚Äôm glad I went on this subreddit before buying. I had planned to make a build centered around Mori kills, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much they were hated.
---
Plan B, Krueger time
---
Lol I try not to hurt their brains too much
---
it's definitely still possible on pc, i got 180'd by an Oni mid dash earlier
---
You made a new account and went to a subreddit were the overwhelming sentiment is survivors are stronger than killers (not saying I agree, just stating the general opinion). If this isn't a troll/meme account (daddy Myers) then you're just a confrontational person looking to argue on the internet.
---
If you honestly believe me that killers are stronger, then you do you man
---
That‚Äôs true, but I would use med kits as my only item instead of using it.
---
Inner strength and second wind are way less situational then a perk that relies on the killer not to break the fucking pallet. Yui has shit perks.
---
It's a teachable now. That means whe. You bought the perk it will now show up in the upcoming bloodwebs
---
Well just for that it's staying here until it gets removed, I hope you remain as annoyed by nothing until that happens :D
---
They have a rework planned for him. It seems the possible notes for said rework came with the update by accident.
---
CuteC3!!!
---
Yep. Not as soon as you go up. I have trouble finding my characters main perks now because it randomly picks out of the pool
---
That would be nice, but i feel like it should have a kind of cooldown so you dont chase right away, just like the hag has
---
I freakin wish dude. I've played 6 games today, not a single Oni (Purple/Red ranks)
---
Is this supposed to be funny?  Do you think your the first one to post this?  How about you look at the first page on this reddit and count how many people have already posted this within 30 minutes...
---
Chase music is now paralyzer by finger eleven
---
Calm spirit its looking very valuable but dam this looks nice
---
Wild. You actually understand how the killer is meant to be played. Kudos!
---
Unbreakable seems like it could work well in general, as the Oni won‚Äôt want to pick you up right away and deplete his power
---
As killer probably blood warden. Great with stealthy
---
Thank
---
That‚Äôs true, but you can only use it once, for killer I would probably use bbq
---
O M G BILL GOT SOMETHING!?!? BILL HOUSE ELF NOW FREEEEEEEEEE!
---
Nah you‚Äôre good homie!
---
I wish that Jane died, seriously she deserved it. "HahA LoOk aT mE I'm So funNy" seriously I am very surprised she didn't t-bag.(sorry for the slight rage, I just had a VERY annoying match, with t-bagging, flashlight clicking and all the rest.)
---
‚Äúeasily out played‚Äù I want whatever you‚Äôre smoking lol. Dude has one of THE best snowball potentials and pressure much like Billy‚Äôs. He‚Äôs insane
---
Change the world, my final message, goodbye
---
just found out it happens everytime im hook in the basement and it happens to my friends too
---
slugging is no longer toxic with the ranking system and gen speed that we have today.
---
I don't even find this funny, this is just surreal
---
Aww, this made me sad, poor Doctor!
---
You get an extra sad oni, he‚Äôs different but only on the inside ‚Ä¢;(...
---
&gt; My question is, why does there deserve to be one survivor every game. If a killer is good and shits on my team I accept my death.
---
As others said, it would be poor game balance if you could complete 3 generators, be the last survivor alive, and have literally no chance at victory at this time.  There is no way for a lone survivor to complete 2 additional generators and then open a door to escape.  Simultaneously, forcing the endgame of this situation to be that the killer chases a lone survivor around the entire map in a hopeless attempt by the survivor to maybe pull of a miracle is not fun for either player.
---
Providing a Hail Mary to the survivor is a way of making the game fun for both the killer and survivors.  If the survivor makes it to when the hatch opens, they have a way out against impossible odds.  The killer in this situation likewise knows the only way the survivor is going to get out, and it becomes a different sort of game: both the survivor and killer are hunting for something besides each other but also trying to be stealthy while doing so.  Or, one of them was lucky/clever enough to spot the hatch and remember its location earlier in the game and can beeline toward it for a rewarding victory.
---
"Sometimes you gotta let them have the win" really is poor game design.
---
Maybe its just xbox. I mean i main survivor and i have yet to get downed... And im playing against red ranks. I played him and hes just god awful. On xbox at least.
---
Maybe whack your sensitivity up to max ?
---
It is. I play 360 freddy haha.
---
Then why are you on the sub Reddit for the game?
---
only if you're protesting suiciding on hook to open the hatch as well
---
??? Is this a big or something I'm not aware of? Plz explain
---
On Xbox killer is a lot harder so that I can understand
---
It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre surprised. The surprise factor is that BHVR keeps nerfing legion in to the ground instead of working on a rework.

---
they gotta hide that shih, bruh
---
Buying it doesn‚Äôt automatically give it to you, it‚Äôs just makes it possible to appear randomly in bloodwebs.
---
The devs want the grind to be there both before and after a new killer launches (for example).
---
If it was a close game, feel like I deserve the 4k, and know the location of the last survivor... I might just go for it. But otherwise I'll pick the second to last one up, hook em and pray BBQ highlights them and just look for them or the hatch.
---
Yeah i stay at rank 5. Cause only time i can play killer without long wait its nighttime and swf red ranks xD
---
i usually only do it when going for adept achievements as you pretty much have to 4k to double pip as a killer
---
Camping Freddy is disgusting. He hard counters BT.
---
Wait, what's the nerf
---
I think only a game objective rework is gonna fix this. Like, the survivors must find each 3 gears spread across the map to begin to work on any generator. They aren't that hard to find and collect, but they're not right next to each other. Maybe perks like Small Game can help you find them. Just that little something, that little 1 extra minute of a gen not being immediately repaired can really help the killer.
---
And just like any hex, it gets cleansed in ten seconds because a survivor spawned next to it and it has no effect before being ripped away from you.
---
Thank you for clarifying this!
---
I read that as a black ops zombies scream
---
Why are you being sarcastic XD, enjoy the new patch
---
I know, I completely forgot about that lmao
---
"*BREAK THEIR IMPURE BODIES*"
---
Poetry to my eyes.
---
We‚Äôre not talking whether it‚Äôs OP or not, we‚Äôre talking counterability. Yup, apparently it‚Äôs not intended. Or maybe it was and they didn‚Äôt expect the backlash they got. Either way, a killer‚Äôs power making people think twice about DS and getting pallets down early is not that bad. It‚Äôs a hell of a lot less dangerous than putting everyone into a coughing fit &amp; being one-hit-down or a chainsaw that shreds pallets like butter &amp; allows the fastest cross-map movement.
---
You right, I wish I thought of that!
---
seems like the same autistic ghost face i just played against, except i got slashed in the hook a total of 12 times while being face camped
---
this is super cute (‚Äò:
---
Only 3 lockers out of all of them on the map can be occupied. The ability range is also limited.
---
The stagger effect now happens when you are exhausted. They also bugged it by making you silent when you are falling
---
Haha, thank you. Although, im upset I won't really be able to run sloppy butcher very well anymore. I'll probably go thanatophobia. Although I suppose I probably should have been going that to begin with.
---
This just turned into a technical discussion I love lol
---
Seriously good point, from overpriced cosmetics to locked content. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to pay for the base game
---
This deserves way more upvotes
---
They are stronger and I am  not trolling, look at how many perks get nerfed for survivors and how many perks get buffed for killers
---
That's what I had originally, but I just thought the probability of that happening would just be too low. Survivors don't even use lockers as much as you'd think.
---
yep.
---
Ding ding ding meeting will now come to order
---
Again. I don't want to be punished for some mistake that my teammates did. If they weren't aware enough to not stop him from getting into nigthshroud mode, then nigthshroud should be applicable only to that guy. This way, it will make the game more fair.
---
It is back to the same shit mechanic that Myers has. 99 on someone else and 100 it on me. Awesome logic.
---
Yeet
---
Are you old enough to be playing this game?
---
I find this nerf unnecessary
---
Yeah the map seems to be way too dark, every time I get it I have to increase my brightness to see around the map.
---
The matchmaking system is completely fair bud. 6 ranks below or above. They are within 6 ranks.
---
I would 1000000% trade my hammer and songbird dress for a much cooler doggo hat and donkey jacketo
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on PS4 and he seems really hard to control during his dash
---
Yea that shit hella dark. P3 claudettes br gone in a sec
---
well no, if you try to open a locker and one of the legion comes out to stab you, they would do the smoke bomb disappearing trick, and to prevent you from putting two close together it should disable teleporting to nearby ones for 10-15 seconds
---
update: made a build out of the perks you gave me, played way too immersed and sadly let two teammates die but I got the challenge done. thank god I don't have to do that again.

Ok, so I'm not going crazy. I was losing chases in seconds because of it. Oni obviously won't have a problem with this if they're injured but still.

If I get 4 od them I'm backing out.
---
Yea sometimes you just gotta let it happen for the sake of the challenge
---
Yes, It shows only one survivor if only one survivor has distortion, I saw this in a game and was confused once lmao
---
I can still do it on PC
---
Thank you, sorry bout dat
---
Free killers stopped with Huntress like 3 years ago lmao
---
Id welcome a second objective but im just confused why people say taking longer to fix gens in a game about fixing gens is boring when once they complete a game where they fix gens they queue back in to find another game where they will be fixing more gens. Im just trying to figure out what they mean.

---
When the spirit phases she leaves her body behind, she doesn‚Äôt need it anymore, it‚Äôs hollow since she herself goes to the ethereal plane.
---
Just having DS in the game makes the killer play different. If there is no obsession you don't give a fuck who you just downed, you just hook them. With an obsession in the game you need to actually pick your targets before the chase, and after the chase to remember if they were hooked recently and slug if they were. Yeah dead hard can help you get to the loop faster or balanced can get distance etc but just having an obsession in the game is way more impactful. You can run mettle of man and the killer has to be scared of DS.
---
ok
---
Just saying the bill wasnt the toxic part the trapped trapper is
---
I main Freddy.
---
Further on your point, the moment a survivor drops a pallet they could pull it right back up before the stun even ends, meaning they could potentially double-stun and maybe even triple stun if they use a flashlight.
---
I think we're up to 100
---
It literally displayed this the entire match. The Entity‚Äôs over here judging me harder than my parents. Haha.

People need to stop assuming buying teachables means you're guaranteed to get them immediately.
---
Super Ultra Dead by Daylight Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + Alpha'
---
Fuck you
---
That is a good point, if I‚Äôm playing killer and don‚Äôt see an obsession I don‚Äôt have to care who I pick up and because there can only be one obsession for all the killer would know there could be 4 people with DS
---
DS is probably the only worthwhile buy on here.
---
Adrenaline is good, but Meg also has Sprint Burst, and Quick and Quiet isn't exactly meta, but it's not a bad perk by any means, so it's better to just level her, and she's free.
---
Unnerving Presence is a level 30 perk on a free killer, you risk absolutely nothing by leveling trapper to 30 if you want this perk, and it's not like you're not already getting dailies for him, and now you have to use him for the archives. Might as well.
---
Rancor isn't nearly good enough to buy, and chances are if you own/want to buy Spirit, you'll want her other perks, including Haunted Ground, which is 35, and it's only 5 more levels to grab Rancor, or you're already going to level her to play her.
---
Laurie on the other hand has one cosmetic outfit, Sole Survivor, and Object of Obsession, which are really forgettable unless you plan on being tunneled to death in your SWF for some fun with OoO, and then she has DS at level 40, which is an actual meta perk, worth buying, allowing you to either leave her unleveled, or unpurchased, saving you both time and or money.
---
but aren't there lockers in locations like the killer shack where it would just guarantee hits?
---
Generally i think there should be more advantages to hiding in lockers to incentivise it, especially since iron maiden is a perk that could use the locker incentive
---
30
---
This went on for the rest of the match, just endlessly falling in the skybox. Anybody else have this problem today?

Oh hey.  I just got back into the game after a year and was doing some research on the new stuff.  This is good news, thank you.  I was going hard on the grind for the challenges this past week.  :)

No Mither to counter every Killer

How would you counter every killer?
---
It‚Äôs a wasted perk slot. Survivors who play efficiently will see the debuff and just run off onto another gen. No reason to get the totem at all.
---
I mean that‚Äôs fine. But we don‚Äôt need a bloodweb montage. Lol
---
Ah I see now it makes a lot more sense. I can definitely agree it feels unfair that he marks you because somebody messed up. The fact that the Mark Meter also doesn't reset if you get broken out of it is a little stupid imo.
---
Nah you're good. But it's stuff like one survivor works out what perks a killer is running, then calls it out to the team. Basically having a level of coordination and information that isn't coded into the game itself for survivors, it's shared between people.
---
Oh yeah, that too. It‚Äôs so weird. This is why we love BHVR so much. They solve alllll the big issues
---
What's the website
---
Very dark and can‚Äôt see anything in the bushes
---
If it can be abused, then the only person people should be bitching too is the devs, not the player's fault that a killer they enjoy is one survivors hate. Furthermore, every killer can be powerful in the right hands, and where there's nerfs and buffs there's ALWAYS someone who will complain, because it is impossible to make everyone happy.

I'm not downvoting as I understand this is satire.

I'm going to say Kindred is currently taking up the same spot as Empathy on the points you made. The level of information you get with that perk and making good decisions with it is amazing.I
---
Holy shit. I thought you were the Legion.
---
dog, i understand you aren‚Äôt a red rank player but with certain killers, 4king is the only way to pip. hell, you can 4k and black pip so a 3k could mean a depip. the game encourages slugging for 4ks. don‚Äôt blame the killers.
---
So gaining info that a survivor isn‚Äôt suppose to gain by using perks and unintended tactic and then sharing that to your squad is SWF
---
Maybe it wasn‚Äôt happy with the way you where dressed ?

Behavior has to make money. If they don‚Äôt make money, they will stop supporting the game. They already make every non-licensed character free with shards and provide a way to get dlc character perks for free. The base game includes 5 killers on PC, 7 on Xbox and Playstation, and 9 on switch. Plus they‚Äôre releasing the nightmare edition that basically has everything soon. The game and the dlcs go on sale almost once a month and usually get down to like 50% off. There was a sale literally yesterday. I got the game for free from Playstation plus and I have purchased almost every single dlc on sale for $4 or less, the oni being an exception, but I could‚Äôve bought him and yui with shards as I had enough for both. Mccote has said he wants to support this game for 5-7 more years, but they gotta make money to do that homie
---
this is so good wtf
---
I don‚Äôt know how to use him properly but I can hardly kill anyone with him atm on ps4, using his ability seems more of a hindrance
---
you can be matched with people 6 ranks below or above.
---
No
---
I disagree respectfully!
---
Yea, I don‚Äôt think coming out of the locker part is good thou
---
Because they're on Killers who can't apply them as quickly as Legion can to everyone.
---
It's pretty awesome to see Rancor and DS in the shrine at the same time
---
I am glad I am not the only person experiencing this. So far it's only happened on the new map.
---
STAR PRATINUM ZA WARUDO

This happened sunday
---
Basement is working fine for me ? I‚Äôve been hooked down there a few times, is it platform specific ? Or map specific ?
---
Yeah games fucked, worse combo I got earlier, I couldn‚Äôt wiggle so obviously I got basement hooked, then I got the falling bug so I had to DC.

---
Lmao a whole badass culture reduced down to yugioh. What has our world come to
---
More or less, yeah. In the vast majority of games it's not even a big deal and won't be an issue, but there's always a team who really sweats over split second timing. I'm a killer main in green ranks so I've only been sure I played against teams like that a few times, but it's super unfun. Nothing you can do helps unless they seriously misplay - and even if they do fuck up a loop or something, they can call out for a flashlight save immediately.
---
Me too m8
---
No. I mean aside from the many hundred posts about it today.
---
It's ridiculous.  Apparently there are videos on it from the PTB and yet this somehow didn't get changed.

Just happened to me?? lmao I was gonna post it too

Yeah, I couldn‚Äôt wiggle either right now. Glad to see this is being worked on

What am I looking at here?
---
For the amount of fun this game has brought me against other games? They do. This is the only game i have played with more than 3 digits. Other games drop of at 40hrs even triple A 60$ games. DBD is 500hrs and going for me
---
Well that sucks, I‚Äôve got to go get borrowed time now to make one of us live.
---
I did that with Myers
---
I don't get it
---
It happened to a survivor in one of my Killer games on the chapel, so I‚Äôm not sure
---
Just equip a green key with aura reading and waste it at the start
---
Two healing perks and a med- kit in one load out
---
BHVR is very good at bug testing
---
When a bug improves the gameplay experience. How many times have I fucking died during struggle even when I was mashing space? BHVR can we keep it?
---
This is so sad, time to only buy oni.
---
clown sucks
---
Two healing perks and a medkit in one load out
---
Bro I‚Äôve made it to red rank you don‚Äôt have to force a 4K every game
---
Oni isnt just a snacc. He is a whole ass meal
---
It was literally pointed out as a change made in one of the last few patches; people brought it up in a thread in this subreddit.  People downvoting it because they don't like it doesn't make it untrue.  :p
---
So far it‚Äôs happened to me on Autohaven and then no others because I haven‚Äôt played any more. But if you browse new, then you can see plenty of people complaining about it
---
Yes, but they'd all have to be split up, meaning unhooks, healing, and gen completion would be hampered. Plus, if the Survivors are split up, that means gen patrolling would be insanely efficient. Your chances of encountering a Survivor working on a gen increase drastically.

They just need the ability to disable certain perks while they figure a way to fix it.

---
to pip at the moment? you kind of do considering a 3k can depip you and really your main hope of not black pipping is a 4k
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts about it, I‚Äôve been lucky so far,

Don't think it'll work on the 2k+ hours people who are stacked and maxed out, but it could probably have an impact on anyone else. (The Bloodpoints one)

That's crazy. I imagine Plague wouldn't make it better either. Idk how this didn't get more complaints.
---
What are you talking about? There's no one there.
---
My friend and I weren't able to wiggle for 10 seconds after being picked up. We thought it was an add-on or something.
---
Game breaking bug!! BhVR needs to block off the basement or disable the hooks down there until this can be patched, me and a friend got hooked in the basement and it was are first hook and I seen him fall thru the map and instant death, same for me....
---
Survivors working together are already at a gen speed disadvantage. If they‚Äôre spread out they have more map control than you do. If you find Person 4 at a gen, 1, 2 and 3 are all on separate generators and it‚Äôs literally your fault. Sure you might down the one guy bc you found him so early, but you‚Äôd better be prepared for the DING DING DING of 3 separate generators.
---
While playing with a friend we both got it rip.
---
A meme takes 5 seconds to consume. An "awesome synthwave remix" takes at least a while, and forces watchers to another platform. It's just inherent that it will gain less traction, and complaining about it isn't going to make it any better.
---
You don‚Äôt need to get every new killer or survivor. You get what you like. You can earn with shards or buy with cash. Licensed requires real life money, but for understandable reasons. Overall, the game has a fair economic model. This is seriously the last thing we need to complain about rn. There are way more pressing issues hurting the game rn.
---
The idea of the flashlight just seems unfair. I‚Äôve never play Killer, but the fact that you are blind and I think the Killer drops anyone they are carrying unless they have that one perk. It just sounds annoying, especially if it gets spammed constantly.
---
It‚Äôd be too OP, literally game breaking.
---
You saying killers don't need to 3K is really the equivalent of saying survivors don't have to escape. No of course they don't have to (except if they want to pip at red ranks), but its more points and more satisfying so of course people want to. It's called trying to win, which most survivors don't want killers to do apparently.
---
Survivor wait times are long and yah the bs basement glitch is game breaking. Had allot of camping tunneling killers tonight. Psn has the trashiest killers in the DBD community!
---
It absolutely is not my friend
---
Aren't the flowers an altruism bp bonus? Medkit may be for other survivors. Have a Nancy locker heal saved up, and self care for emergencies.
---
"I'm not trolling"
---
&gt;look at how many perks get nerfed for survivors and how many perks get buffed for killers
---
Any amount of knowledge of this game proves you wrong. Both sides get nerfed and buffed. Literally look at this update. 
---
Legion, nerfed
---
Spirit, nerfed
---
Oni, nerfed from ptb
---
The objective truth is a team of survivors has a maximum possible skill that is higher than the killer, but on the opposite end of the spectrum a group of survivors has a possible minimum skill level lower than a killers possible minimum. This means at low ranks killers &gt; survivors, but at high ranks survivors &gt;killers, but for the majority of players who rank somewhere in the middle it varies form player to player, game by game. If you're adamant that killers are op, and saying things like you easily 4k with 0 perks, you sound like someone with very little time I'm this game. But go ahead and prove me wrong my dude. Switch to killer main and come back with a sick 4k vid with you slaughtering 4 rank 1s with 0 perks. I'd love to see that
---
I know that works. But I only have one. None are showing up in my bloodweb.
---
Killer: Ruin
---
Survivor: Borrowed Time
---
Canonically the Entity feeds on hope. It is perfectly within character for Killers to let a single survivor live in order to preserve those stocks so the Entity can continue to feed
---
"Come on then, lets 'ave it! I don't give a shit pal." - David King.
---
Just stand infront of the killer when they carry a survivor, and break a super medkit with botany knowledge so you're able to take alot of hits
---
Yeah but if you don't have the experience needed only other garbage players such as yourself will form shitty opinions such as "Oni weak"
---
It doesn‚Äôt change with sensitivity...
---
If someone does this too much during a match, I will let them die on a hook. Fucking morons.
---
I mean yes both sound hilarious if done right or with a decent sense of humor
---
that man has been replying to everyone who posts something about the glitch LMAO imagine having that much time on your hands yikes
---
They're used in his add ons. This would weaken him even further after pts nerf.
---
As someone that's been playing alot of Oni this would kinda be a buff and a nerf as I use blood to track survivors meaning if orbs disappear that means if I see a fresh orb a survivor is near however it make getting the ability more harder. So overall I wouldn't mind it
---
Sorry but that‚Äôs not true. You don‚Äôt have to 4k. I pip when I don‚Äôt even want to
---
Game breaking bug and where is BhVR at with disabling basement hooks or blocking it off until they can patch it? 
---
That‚Äôs right no where, when any other developer would have disabled it until fixed...
---
Oh no, im so sorry to hear about this...im pretty sure nobody posted a million times this bug today...
---
Did you used to play back in 2016??
---
nah its not toxic just a easy win.
---
Well, it could be good for versing solo-Survivors, just like the updated Kindred is really only good in solo-queue.

Permission to use as my gamer pic on xbox?!
---
On PC he just destroys. But not in the OP way, in the "fuck i actually have to try to not die" way
---
it literally is true. there are countless videos on youtube of killers 4king and getting black pips. like plague seriously gets fucked in the pipping system.
---
Did he picked you up after? Lol you even when invisible
---
Ight, imma head out
---
The wake up bug not too long ago that increased all action speed, sounds constantly being buggy every update (which is a big killer tool), haste bug, entity blockers not appearing after 3rd vault every so often, frame drops during bloodlust, Spirit woosh audible in terror radius, grabbing a survivor not always working
---
This is so bullshit. Both their accounts should be banned for this.
---
This is too true, bubba gamers rise up.
---
You're too close to the generator just kinda back it up a little then kick it
---
I'm the Nancy in the video. After this clip, I ran to the killer and led to her my friend, Nick. We desperately tried to get him unstuck, and eventually the other three survivors and the Spirit were crowding him and doing things attempting to move him. The Spirit downed him but could not pick him up and he wouldn't bleed out. The rest of us left because we couldn't do anything else and after the Endgame Collapse, he and the Spirit STILL remained on the map. He ended up having to disconnect so the killer (who was incredibly cool about this) wouldn't lose all their blood points.
---
I've activated it like 4 times today it's a thousand times easier with new protection hits
---
They don't really do much for chapters as they are afraid of making too big changes. It's kinda old how no matter how many killers are added it never seems to change the game's formula.
---
Uhh stop trying to use him like you're a PC youtuber? Use the dash for patrol and use the smash to end chases.
---
It is annoying because it usually means I've been outplayed, but I don't get salty when I'm outplayed so no worries. It's only an issue when you get swarmed by them, and when you're breaking a pallet they can 100% get a stun and there's nothing I can do. It can turn unsafe loops into a safe escape basically for free.
---
Anyways you seem like a sweet player, hope I run into you some time because cuties are few and far between lately.
---
I remember buying legion with iri shards before the nerf, wanted to try him a bit before a drastic change
---
In sense of lore , sort of, Legion is my favourite killer. Because even though there's serial killers, thing with super natural powers, and horror movie icons, you can also play as/against some fucking delinquents
---
plus i‚Äôd say killers slugging at ranks that you don‚Äôt need to is more on the poorly designed endgame than the killers
---
Chests in games to look for another.
---
I never said they don‚Äôt need to 3k is saying they don‚Äôt need to 4k
---
Nah bro he's a whole buffet
---
I‚Äôm not getting them ? I‚Äôm taking hits whilst people are being carried ?
---
Tried a couple games for some reason it doesn't count protection hits while other survivors are in a chase. For me at lesst
---
Search the chests in the game
---
He costs 9k iridescent hards, so he's free.
---
Escaping 1000 times will likely not change any of what I just said, some people are pretty stubborn in what they believe in such as yourself, I doubt 1000 4ks will change any of your opinions
---
I believe console is P2P while PC is DS.
---
i guess
---
I know, this community breeds some depressing people sometimes
---
Thank you so much, I swear to never use flashlight, and if anyone catches me they can summon me and prove me a liar. If I every do come against you, *please* be gentle when you slice me in half
---
I'm thankful that I'll never truly know how many times I've just walked right past a survivor sitting in plain sight.
---
Considering how often I manage to pull it off as survivor it's probably *a lot*.
---
I just don't have it, i can't get it in my bloodweeb
---
This is written as if BHVR intentionally breaks parts of their game
---
But only if I can apply my cosmetics to each one of them. I want them to look pretty.

Oh lol I meant he‚Äôs a dlc. Cool that they release him for shards.

---
I was hoping for the meg mask, fingers crossed
---
Thanks I'll try it   I keep losing thanks to this and rage quitting as survivors t bag me
---
I got facecamped by a spirit and their reasoning was its not bannable.
---
I think they need to be injured, not just in a chase
---
Oink
---
Saw a post on the official forums, add-ons that add extra charges are currently broken, add it to the list.
---
Charge add-ons for medkits are bugged and don't work.
---
Killer misses you regardless
---
xbox, green rank, only had 1 Oni today :(
---
Yea but YouTube killers don‚Äôt care about chases which is part of the reason why they dont pip. All a 3k does to me is make the difference between a pip and a double pip
---
*you're.... getting downvoted :((((
---
Yeah when I read it was unintentional I was like wtf
---
Thankyou! This an Asymmetrical PvP game, the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to have fun and will dc otherwise‚Äù mentality is incredibly juvenile. The bottom line with a game like DbD is generally if one side is winning then the other side isn‚Äôt going to be having as much fun, plain and simple.
---
Up against a killer you don‚Äôt find fun? Too fucking bad, play the match and learn something. There‚Äôs 4 other people in the game, get over yourself.
---
I‚Äôve been in countless matches (Both Killer and Surv) where I‚Äôve been absolutely rolled. I‚Äôve been camped I‚Äôve been flashlight clicked and teabagged, you name it. But I have never once Dc‚Äôed because I‚Äôm not 13 years old like I feel a large portion of the player base is lol
---
I'm sure there are, though I'm not familiar with them too much, but lots of players here would be happy to give you helpful advice. What side are you planning to improve on?
---
There‚Äôs Bricky on YouTube who makes comprehensive guides for every killer, other than that there are definitely things that will come up if you search for dbd guides or just watching content creators can be helpful. That last one can be a little detrimental since they sometimes use unconventional play styles tho.
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
Yes, unless it‚Äôs an insta weapon/ability.
---
The sad reality of it is that now that it‚Äôs gone and they acknowledged it as a ‚Äúbug‚Äù it‚Äôs probably not coming back, and there‚Äôs things higher on the priority list like balance changes
---
That's why I'm going to run bt
---
They nerf them because they are OP, they nerf perks for Survivors because killer mains always cry about it
---
This was my original concept ;)
---
I changed it after considering how seldom Survivors use lockers. It would be like finding a needle in a haystack.
---
I missed Haunted Grounds ))):
---
Sounds like you're crying about op killers hmmmmmm
---
All 4 survivors are feng*
---
They probably stay forever to stop them being an Uber built in tracking method.
---
Sorry, bro
---
You're tripping. There's a perk that makes your exhaustion go down faster called vigil
---
No i know all of it but i can't get selfcare in my bloodwebs, its locked. When i check info character on claudette, selfcare is locked and i know that i buy selfcare. But, they don't give me my perk and now i just spend 4000 for finally nothing. Because i buy franklin demise to.

Well of course! They'd be YOUR Legion!

Pain reliever is one of the few stealth players who is viable in high ranks. I like him and his key moments :)
---
I have watched Monto stream, and he does die as survivor, probably survives 70% of his games.
---
did you spend them all before they went missing
---
Make killer
---
I mean all those things are just bugs that need or needed to be fixed it's not like they purposely add these things in
---
The weirdest thing was the idea of having a gang of people, and then doing nothing with that theme at all. As is, there would be absolutely no change if they just named the character Frank and made it one person. Somebody suggested having the other characters AI controlled running around the map. They wouldn‚Äôt attack, but would maybe taunt you or alert the real killer somehow. As a player you would be on your toes constantly over whether it was the real killer or not. Maybe you could jump back and forth between the characters. There are lots of possibilities.
---
I also like the idea of being able to shape shift between the different characters with variations on the power between them.
---
The entire world supply of food

Pain reliever is one of the few stealth players who is viable in high ranks. I like him and his key  :)

---
FTFY
---
leaving chases is a very affective way to win the overall game at red ranks... which is on the devs, not the killers. most people want to feel they did all they could to win. sometimes you have hard game and it‚Äôs annoying sometimes for a survivor to just escape after a complete domination
---
I got a 3k but it was a long game. I found its easier to just not use his demon strike unless you dash to a hook and can get a double down
---
Yeah looks like she gets a top cosmetic and he got frosty eyes... But I think that was a gift like Bill's sweater
---
I mean you literally die, no matter what, so I wouldn't really say it improves anything, but I catch your drift
---
I like almost all of this. The one thing I don't really like is the fact that the terror radius doesn't automatically give off the shock in treatment mode.
---
Not really, just hit ready before you‚Äôre ready and then spend the queue time doing anything with perks/items and whatnot. It‚Äôll be that same amount of time but it‚Äôll feel shorter
---
Nice video game bigotry we got here, how badly did this affect your day? :0
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Any ‚Äúmain‚Äôs‚Äù opinions null and void anyway, you can‚Äôt comment on balance unless you play both equally.
---
No ds, no bt  
---
all boosted red rank survivors :)
---
He wasn't nerfed. The mend time is insignificant, and yes the basic attack change from frenzy sucks, but they gave him movement speed in frenzy, something he needed, and buffed his add-ons.
---
Ok thnx...just trying to find my own meta build...
---
I learned from Monto. He's a little toxic and that's why I like watching his videos, but he usually starts off the video explaining the perks and I liked that. As long as you try to imitate him you should do decently well at first.
---
If we made the most efficient addons basekit for every killer (except for top tiers like Freddy, Spirit, Nurse, Billy), would they have equal or less power than the top 4? (Of course Legion would still be weakest, only the books, his ruler, and maybe iridescent button is worth it, but even base kit is useless)
---
Pain reliever has some useful videos if you wanna stealth and maybe Oh tofu for more aggressive plays?
---
Objective offering I think that one is
---
I‚Äôm having the worst day ever in my entire life because of this thank you for asking
---
I meant 4K, that should have been clear considering the context
---
because the fun in the game for us isn't sitting on our asses holding R1 or whatever you're gen button is for 15-20 minutes. how is that exciting at all???? you're holding a single button in what's supposed to be a horror game. we want to get spooked, chased, and have different things to worry about. there's no fun or excitement in being a horror game that leaves much to be desired in the horror department
---
Says they reduced the amount he can turn in the patch notes.
---
The cat was bigger in the first version and the ears went over the perk background. There's just a background-shaped dark overlay when a perk is not active in game, so the ear tips didn't get darkened at first, now its ok
---
It was my friend. He sent it to me. He couldn't be picked up.
---
Seems like it's almost no turn now.
---
It‚Äôs affective at getting a 4K it‚Äôs not affective at getting pips
---
Oni is just a combination of shugoki and orochi smh

Its not blood orb that give you your power quickly, its when you hit a healty survivor. Its give you 1/2 of ur charge. So oni don't really need a nerf for now. But still not a bad ideas for a nerf

I just had this bug after waiting in the lobby for 10 minutes, getting a disconnected teammate after 2 minutes into the match and i killing myself on purpose, waiting another 10 minutes to find a match to get a clown who is so laggy that he's teleporting around and eventually disconnects himself, and finally waiting another 10 minutes to get a match where i seemingly spawn what seems like 10 or 20 feet from a bubba who immediately downs me near the basement and I'm hooked and can't see a damn thing till i realize i can look down and see the empty cloudy blue void around my Megs poor red head and get unhooked but still can't move or see anything and downed and immediately put back on the same hook in which it finally breaks the glitch. A teammate disconnected shortly after btw. I gave up and braved the lobby for another 10 minutes to find a match and that one also immediately disconnected after making us wait 5minutes during loading screen because someone disconnected. Good job BHVR.
---
HA HA HA
---
Bricky and King (I think) are great for learning killer powers and teachables. 
---
HybridPanda is great with his ShrineWatch series, if you‚Äôre looking to get a better understanding of perks. 
---
OhTofu is probably the best CC for in-depth guides and improving gameplay. His flashlight and map guides were especially helpful to me.
---
I got to roughly 35 with 970,000 BP and just getting the best items I wanted. If you were trying to get only the cheapest items you could probably stretch it to 38.
---
I always like picking up the last survivor, finding the hatch next to a hook, and then spending a few moments just staring back and forth at the hatch and hook
---
I give the hatch in those cases, if I was gonna kill someone I don't waste time
---
No friends that have the game so killer lol
---
i believe it‚Äôs about level 32? but that‚Äôs if you‚Äôre going straight for perks. this was also before they did 3+ perks on the bloodweb
---
I just used did the same thing a few hours ago. Mileage may vary depending on the add-ons you buy but you should get to the teachables.
---
I want to say around 35.
---

Int3r4cthas incredibly detailed videos explaining a lot of the games mechanics and specific killers. I‚Äôm talking 30-45min videos if you want to get super technical.
---
You know your joking around but all of those killers ACTUALLY NEED BUFFS DUMBASS
---
Oh it isnt you amigo, it's just a thing for now. 20ish posts today had to be removed today due to meme flood
---
Why doesn't Oni stop his charge when colliding with things?
---
At 0:08 you can see he has no red streak
---
When I see them hiding near a gen, I‚Äôll go smack the gen and turn as if I‚Äôm walking away but I‚Äôll walk backwards and SMACK ‚ÄòEM.
---
But legit David is my favourite survivor to play as,  and I always feel like I can never hide.

Just do it on 3rd hook. Otherwise, steer clear of it.

Ah makes sense but damn that sucks more effort
---
Bitching about survivors gets you a 4k every game dude, Just saying
---
Iron will
---
Oni's perks are a F U to survivors as a whole. What could possibly be wrong with that. Nerfing crap killers just to introduce must have new perks is circling the drain.
---
Nearly every game I‚Äôve played was on the new map. I‚Äôm honestly sick of it
---
Thanks! Ill try this when i get off
---
He was nerfed extremely hard. He can't use the two things making him even a bit viable now, which was sloppy and STBFL and his best addon was literally nerfed as well as the direct mending nerf. It doesn't matter if they made complete garbage tier addons just trash tier and the ms buff isn't nearly good enough to even out the nerfs.
---
Amigo is the best word change my mind
---
My first encounter with The Oni was... interesting. This happened to both of my matches with Oni when he hooked me in the basement. I don't know if it's Oni's bug or a Basement Bug yet. 
---
Oni OP!
---
int3r4ct - has the most accurate numbers now that he has access to most of the data. Incredibly organized video series and very informative. My favorite.
---
PainReliever - you might fall asleep listening to him but he has a variety of videos dedicated to tips. Has a series of \~15 episodes where he narrates what he does in a match and why it was right/wrong.
---
Otzdarva - he's really popular but if you're looking to learn his videos aren't particularly organized. Look at the titles and click the ones relevant to you. He usually narrates what he's doing as he plays.
---
These are all useful and accessible regardless of skill level, but it's not like you have to be a god to do alright in DBD. These'll show you the ins and outs and you'll be set.
---
I'm climbing out slowly. Thanks to a strong support structure, therapy and medication. Thank you. :)
---
Sometimes it just works...
---
Sloppy butcher,Tanataphobia and nurses,
---
And his updated pin addons that make survivors broken when hit with a frenzy chain, basically they are never healing.
---
Steve is so loud
---
I mean, isn‚Äôt that what you‚Äôre supposed to do? That‚Äôs what I always did....
---
Make sure you wait at least 3 seconds before taking a hit again. Unless the issue is just not getting the first one at all
---
Lmao right
---
Still fairly new, what does P3 Claudette mean?
---
Like. Demon dash is practically useless on console it seems any competent survivor can juke it just by running to the left or right when you're close.
---
Shit, I'm about to be the leet killer then. I'm playing as Ghostface because I love the Scream movies. I have zero idea how to use him effectively, but I'm having a blast.
---
this has been posted like a thousand times dude, they know about it
---
Clown is fucking trash, he is unplayable without the add on where you move faster when reloading his gas
---
lol imagine playing the victim when it comes to a bug.
---
Cool. Thanks for letting us know. These kinds of bugs that only affect one side can be slow to identify. Will avoid hooking folks in the basement.
---
Haha now say sike rn
---
Lmao
---
Wait.... what‚Äôs going with the basement?
---
Ghostface is a really good fucking killer, I love him so much, I main him and Michael, Keep having a blast dude
---
My guess is that was latency.
---
Could not see a goddamn survivor unless they were right in front of me and in the open. Absolutely infuriating. I'm not a fan of Hawkins, but that is really just because I need to get used to it. But this one? This one is pure fucking garbage.
---
Oh sry then didnt know that.
---
Happened earlier today and didnt watch reddit tbh. Welp
---
I Really hope this is a joke.
---
try to rework beast of prey as well while you‚Äôre at it
---
&gt;Profile has 3 comments
---
&gt;Only post is this
---
Try better next time
---
Please tell me this isn‚Äôt serious
---
I really don't know why I continue to play this game as a survivor main. I think I might be done real soon.
---
Killers get all this dope shit, cool abilities, amazing addons, fantastic offerings, and survivors just have a bunch of watered down bullshit.
---
I mean look at the fucking Odd Bulb. There are yellow addons that are literally more effective than it. Any time a perk becomes useful and annoying to killers they bitch and moan so much that it gets nerfed(Balanced Landing).
---
I mean seriously it's just not fun when it's not just an uphill battle against the killers, but BHVR themselves.
---
Ah yes and the bait is set
---
Only works some times. Usually the back hook
---
It's a basement bug. Every basement is bugged like this.
---
Killers are already running Iron Grasp Agitation and Mad Grit to abuse it. Game is near unplayable, if you go down once you lose.
---
clown is easier to pickup but his skill ceiling is about a foot higher than his skill floor. Huntress is much harder to learn and is probably the only killer where you can continuously get better at no matter how good you are
---
devs seem to become more incompetent every patch, reminds me of the Hoi4 devs
---
OhTofu
---
That sounds like the play style simply has changed, not "nerfed extremely hard." If I wanted to call it a nerf, I'd call it minor, or near moderate.

"Please provide proof to back up this meme you've posted. If you fail to take time out of your day re-watching 15 minute-long DBD streams to send me a timestamp of each specific instance, I will start raging and calling you names."
---
Imagine these two sparring in their free time lol. Spirit would probably get all acrobatic and flip kicky while Oni would just flick his wrist and break what remains of her spine.
---
Yeay you're right, they force us to buy cosmetics or else we cant play...
---
I'm saying we should get auto-struggle as an option or feature.
---
Definitely Bond for Survivor side. I absolutely love all the map info it provides and I feel totally naked without it. 
---
As for Killer... it‚Äôs hard not to say BBQ just because I love the massive BP gain, even more than the tracking aspect. Favorite perk other than that though... I do love me some Infectious Fright.
---
*when ghostface hides behind a closed chest*
---
Lol I guess I dont have much choice lmao xD
---
Awesome. But I'd have given you a Silver had it been the Clown saying "I'm gonna bite off everyone on of his fingers on at a time", because ya know... his Mori....
---
I hope they fucking ban all the people abusing this shit right now. I'm just reporting anyone who hooks in basement.
---
Fake post, said indian instead of native american
---
I like hitler
---
Lookup not otzdarva
---
The bug is so annoying I've seen players get blinded for like the whole match. Apparently picking them up fixes it but still
---
There's nothing on my screen.
---
No its an amazing glitch get hooked in the basement and you shall see the shadow realm
---
He lost everything that made him decent and you're talking about minor or near moderate :D
---
you played spirit so who cares
---
No worries! We all go through it, any support is helpful :) keep pushing
---
Well yea he's an easy going guy that just does random ass builds and ends up not doing well sometimes because of it. That's fine if you don't care about points or winning, but most people do. Like most streamers, he doesn't need bloodpoints anymore so doesn't really care how well he does every game.
---
I agree, you shouldn't have to mash in a game like dbd, it's not a 2008 QTE heavy game
---
If perks are still appearing in your blood web, then you just have to keep clearing and hope it pops up. I recommend getting perks you don't care about since they'll stop clogging up the blood web.
---
If there **ZERO** perks in your blood web, **even after it refreshes**, then something is wrong. You'd have to take it up with BHVR.
---
I hate the fact that when I get kicked off a server my rank get penalized so it better not or I will be pissed!
---
Imagine still thinking infinite loops exist, thats why theres only 3 vaults, And theres plenty of killers that waste time. Also theres maps were the doors spawn right next to each other.
---
Bond would be the best
---
Clown is huntress but a little faster and throws bottles that slow people down but still cost him time, Huntress is stronger because she can throw hatchets and hatchets hurt people

Mending will only go down if you aren't running so as long as you're sprinting let's say for a save, picking up a downed teammate, etc your timer won't go down.

Connection rebound. Before it was always killer sided now it can be survivor sided and holy shit when it is...... Nothing but wow moments. I've seen a lot of jumping corpses rubberband away.

---
Lol he‚Äôs currently rank 1
---
I have it, but killer wait times are so long it's not worth playing it.
---
I didn‚Äôt know until recently that flashlights (by only the bravest survivors) can interrupt a Nurse blink if timed right. 
---
Other than that, I had a good time looking closely at all the perk icons. Some had details I hadn‚Äôt even noticed, like a skull in the cross of Nurse‚Äôs Calling. Heck, M&amp;A looked like a random gen for the longest time to me, until I realized it was the Doctor‚Äôs head. Doh. XD
---
The downvotes have already started. There's really nothing you can say, no matter how much sense it makes, to stop them. Your average redditor sees a negative number and just assumes whatever's in the comment is wrong.
---
His frenzy shouldn't have had the ability to apply basic attack perks in the first place, so yes, minor or moderate nerf. His play style is harrassment, and isn't an MS  (basic attack only) killer. Thanataphobia and dying light easily can replace those two perks, alongside using bbq, and ruin or pop. New, easy build for slowing time and harrassing.
---
Sure, but she *didn't*. She just ran around and gave the killer a free hit. What's wrong with that? She didn't teabag or click her flashlight or anything toxic like that.
---
different ethnicities is fine (which they already clearly did a good job of) but we don't need gays or trans like you also suggested, while being off-topic, by the by. different ethnicities are fine, as god made us all different colors and such, but if u start including gays and trannies, you may as well include rapists and child molestors too, because it's a totally different topic: it's evil, and ignorant of god and judgment
---
When the succ is too good
---
And the doors spawning next to each other and hex:ruin being buffed from affecting 1/2/3/4 survivors to all survivors.
---
Actually the Oni also gets blood from pulling survivors out of lockers, there is no real benefit from forcing him to grab you out of lockers other than temporarily canceling his power.
---
37ish
---
Three African American killers (the wraith, the doctor and Joey in legion), two Asian killers (the oni and spirit) possible tribal woman killer (hag) and ancient babylonian killer (plauge). If you wanna claim the game is racist and has all white cast... maybe play the freaking game.
---
His first girlfriend also turned into the moon

Xbox one: not really related to the most recent update but I‚Äôve been wondering about syringes and the pill insta heals. Do those not work for everyone else too? Or do I need to like delete and redownload the game

Can you please explain what "early" in "Players who disconnect early from games will receive temporary matchmaking bans" means.
---
How much is "early"? Within first 30 seconds of the match? 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes?
---
So will a player not get a ban if for example they DC on their last hook 1 second before dying or at the opened exit gates because it's not "early"?
---
I really want to know the numbers of what exactly "early" means.
---
Killer 2 survivors it seems related
---
During endgame is pretty much the only thing the killer can do so it‚Äôs whatever.
---
alright alright chill
---
I also had a bug where nothing on my screen showed up as survivor, no perks, no team mates status, and skill checks were invisible, anyone else?
---
Oh I see so it is a different code. I just wanted to make sure that replacing the file doesn't replace the effect too, rendering it useless lol.
---
I made one of these threads and I miss the functionality, but Peanits said on official forums that the devs didn't want the feature present because it incites lobby dodging and this is something they want to mitigate
---
Unable to look right now sadly so if you could tell me... what Oni running change was added?
---
What else are you supposed to defend when the gates are 99'd?
---
Yeah because cosmetics are vital, like why do the devs need money, should just make them all cheap or purchasable with iri shards. Then they‚Äôll make less money. Smart

End game collapse or when you‚Äôre down to three to four gens in the same area. It‚Äôs more of a soft camp with the latter as you have all your objectives right around you in a small circle.
---
It looks like he only affects skill check if you use an add on now, that's a huge nerf if true.
---
Getting hooked in the basement sends you to a weird gray hell world, scroll the sub and you'll see dozens of videos of it
---
What was the use of the extra "reported to lock this"
---
It sounds incredibally petty, but i'm kinda happy they're going to think about not releasing the event cosmetics for free to everyone. 
---
I'm tired of the excuse of "Your reward was getting it early"
---
Nah my reward was putting in time to farm them and thus they should actually be indicative of that. If they release them for everyone for free, then whenever people see them they won't know if i actually put time into getting them or not, which IMO is the entire point of event cosmetics.
---
What do you mean extra? Isn‚Äôt it just giving you back the 1,000 cells you spent to unlock premium?
---
Suck more dev cock please
---
Wow, you're a horrible person.
---
Some people might not know to be fair, since it doesn‚Äôt happen all the time (not sure what causes it) and not everyone checks reddit/ forums. 
---
I did notice killers purposefully avoiding the basement tonight when I played, even when it was better for them to hook me there, which I thought was really nice and gave me hope in this community!
---
Quentin lovers unite! I love this picture.
---
If u got wrecked and its endgame its like the only option you have as killer, other than that camping is just dumb imo but i can get the view of ‚Äúthe survivor was toxic so im not gonna let them live‚Äù but still that‚Äôs probably what they want out of you and toxicity just breeds toxicity.
---
Literally takes roughly 20-30 hours of playtime to earn 9k, why should you be able to get all new content free. Unlicensed content is for current players, like I doubt this chapter is going to bring in players like stranger things did. So majority of current players can buy with iri shards. Those who don‚Äôt will pay. ¬£5 shocking

---
I‚Äôm rank 3 survivor and have been killed by legion so many times today. Every game was a 4K. I think he‚Äôs fine
---
&gt; I got to rank 7 from rank 13 on rank reset just dropping pallets in chase and vaulting windows until entity blocker kicked in. Difficult role my ass.
---
Dude, I was agreeing with you. That's why specifically wrote how easy it is to rank up without even learning to loop.
---
Lol you're those kids who buys cosmetics because you think they make you a pro player
---
Did you actually compile every single one of them?
---
David and Ace are confirmed gay. Hope there will be more gay characters to piss you off.
---
it was around for so long without excessive complaints of lobby dodging, imo. DCs are a much bigger issue than leaving a lobby when you see you're in a group with low/high ranks
---
‚ÄúHeals‚Äù is such a strong word for that book.
---
I will thank you! I like Micheal too, and Freddy, but those are because movie nostalgia.
---
It's hard, but I am.
---
If a killer is decent in high level games with no perks, then they will be completely broken with perks. Perks for killer are extremely significant and if a killer can do well at 70% power then that killer is obviously way too strong. Add-ons are different imo, it's cancerous as a survivor, but I don't mind killers having a couple of add-ons which make them comically overpowered considering how rare they are.
---
Dying light won't do anything for you, it's a ''win more'' perk. BBQ on a detection killer is really smart, ruin is standart for literally every killer and you won't get enough fast downs to use pop to it's full potential, or even at all in some cases. He now just has a worthless power which doesn't really allow him to do anything besides injuring, and while adrenalin, DH and so on are meta, injuring someone isn't that great when compared to an ability, which helps you get kills (like his old m2 with STBFL, you could just be a 115% Killer with pretty much garantied full stacks of it). Thana does 16% slowdown, thats not really much on it's own.
---
Basement challenges made easy courtesy of bhvr interactive
---
Yeah, but- shit, you're right

Yeah first one looks morr iconic, default skin works cause shes so new.
---
Oh don‚Äôt support anything or anyone in life??? If people do the same you, you wouldn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúcourage‚Äù that you do. I‚Äôll leave it at that
---
When you realize you're playing against overly altruistic survivors and can use that as a way to get quick pressure. Doesn't make sense to keep walking away if you know someone is going to be there in the matter of seconds.
---
If survivors keep rushing the hook or if it's endgame collapse those are the most valid reasons to camp and maybe if you're losing by alot you could camp but eh not worth doing it

Honestly a lot of times surviviors bring camping onto themselves,  I'm a survivor main btw. If everyone is non stop hook rushing or insta saving, why would the killer leave? I'm running into that problem a lot lately,  where a killer isn't camping until everyone starts instantly yanking off the hook before the killer gets 10 steps away. 
---
Then of course to secure their kills during endgame,  and that you cannot blame them for that especially if they had a rough game. Annoying, yes. Toxic, no.
---
That's how every multiplayer game works? Even much more competitive games like dota or csgo will let you just quit the game before temp-banning you.
---
BHVR?
---
I got a no-k against 4 blendettes on that map as  F R E D D Y. Fuckin shoot me mate
---
Funnily enough that tracking method starts to become worthless once they're literally everywhere
---
I liked it too. Now I have to wait till the end of a terrible game, see that two survivors were rank 18 and it explains so much.
---
I also liked seeing peoples prestige characters just cause I'm nosy.
---
When you go over to your gf‚Äôs house to meet the parents and she looks nice but her grandpa is holding a shotgun
---
Pretty cool but I don't see the whole 'getting attacked when close to the locker' part being that effective considering it's only 3 lockers and survivors don't really get close to lockers unless they're hiding. Maybe if  survivors try to hide in a locker occupied by the legion they're instead get grabbed and held there for 30 seconds and you could tp to the locker to grab them or something. Idk just picturing a survivor opening the locker and getting pulled in by one of the legion members lol.
---
We already have a child molester in the game with Freddy. But going out of your way to say being gay and transexual is evil... well that is closed minded. Like I would not mind like one or two characters being gay. To me that is not an issue, but going out of the way to have a transsexual killer? What does them being transsexual add? I would not be against it but saying "THE FIRST TRANSEXUAL KILLER" and using it to bring in as marketing is my issue. Besides we have leather face who cross dressed, and while yes he is depicted as a killer, he still has character to him than just that.   
---
My biggest issues with the post is them claiming there is NO representation for characters other than white. Yes we have yet to get an indian survior/killer but when he have several characters that are not white. Wraith, Doctor, and Joey all being killers that are black and even wraith being directly from Africa with that cultural influence in his add-ons and cosmetics.
---
did you play the ptb? I played it for a few days on release and never encountered the basement glitch once, nor did i hear anyone complaining about it.
---
It's not like the ptb had these glaring issues that were completely ignored and pushed to the live servers
---
Sprint Burst. Dead 'ard is shit with the servers, lithe is a meme, and SB is arguably better than both.
---
It's used primarily at the start of chases to get free distance, usually coming off hooks and gens.The "weakness" that it pops in a really easy way is actually a strength if you manage exhaustion. People used BL as a mid chase helper, but you can do the same with SB. It's a little more difficult, but it's way more satisfying than BL when you pop it to cross an empty stretch after the killer breaks a pallet thinking they've got you in a dead zone. Also, when it comes down to the last few gens, sometimes killers just drop the chase since you get so much distance it'd waste precious time.
---
It's bad for noobs since they only walk around with it, but it just keeps getting better the higher up the skill ladder you go. Dead Hard is real nice when it works but SB is more consistent nowadays.
---
PSA: Don't play the Wraith.
---
His uncloak haste has been gutted, so he's gone back down to being roughly the same power level as Legion.
---
What a fucking racist piece of shit.
---
They only need to be injured but not actually in a chase iirc
---
I actually play on Xbox and find him to be better controlled than Billy. Really all you need to do is keep R stick centered but still move it to look around and turn and move L stick around near objects. And make sure you don't try to flick with him, it lags the game and you're almost certain to miss. Otherwise, a nightmare to go against.
---
I finally got one and wow, I couldn't see a damn thing. Good on you for getting a 4k lol
---
Mods love it it‚Äôs stayin
---
have ya seen classic Ghostface? you Oni have it lucky!
---
Ah, a man (or woman) of culture
---
i havent used it on live servers but i got it to activate like 3-4 games in a row on the ptb. It's not as op as release but it's definitely more consistent than before
---
Honestly camping someone who is "toxic" usually imo is a lame excuse. If someone runs/loops you for 3 gens before you can get them,  that doesn't make them toxic. T-Bagging also shouldn't make them camp,  you're just literally ruining the game for yourself by losing your points over something that doesn't ruin your game. Yes it's annoying, but no it doesn't literally ruin the game. I also play killer,  and it sucks getting outplayed and being taunted by them, but their our other ways to best them besides ruining your own game like they want, as you said lol.
---
Oh really I didn't know that. Thats actually cool. Two characters you wouldn't think were but are... Thats what I prefer that they don't shove that concept down the throats of the consumers in order to look far more appealing. But you know what... I can get behind those two being gay :D
---
I just ran kindred and had the bug happen to me in my last game
---
Most of those types of trophies are made to be completed over time rather than forcing you to grind them out immediately. Trying to unhook yourself 50 times is going to be a boring and a pain if you completely focus on unhooking yourself every game but its also something that you'll get eventually just by playing the game normally.
---
outside of the whole god thing, we really don't need a trans or gay killer lmao, it adds nothing to the killer by having it in the backstory and since we will never get anything of pre-entity its just pandering
---
Atleast you care
---
...no.
---
youre a cunt lmaoo
---
I would love for them to scale back to new shit every 4 months and just balance/bug fix in between
---
Said the loli with one eye closed, cheeks blushing, and the background behind her turning into stars.
---
I saved them for today the release I did not spend a single one
---
was that the 4.6 m/s 3 blink nurse?
---
Have even seen the new map yet
---
Omg I messaged the mods yesterday morning about this when it started. Thank god!!!!
---
Behavior should release actual new content instead of another bag of perks overy 3 months.
---
Ahh, now I understand why they were running into walls in the basement earlier haha
---
Freddy hitting a survivor that just got unhooked with BT and chasing them was another good reason. You couldnt do shit and would just flop in front of him when the BT was finished
---
If a killer doesn‚Äôt have a reason to leave the hook, i don‚Äôt see why they should and don‚Äôt blame them for camping. if the team has been playing altruistically and you‚Äôre in the end game collapse, they probably know you‚Äôre coming back to get your friend, so camping is how they can potentially secure some kills. it‚Äôs not fun and it sucks for survivors, but I don‚Äôt blame them for it at all.
---
camping during the generator part of the game is also extremely annoying, but they‚Äôre punished for it because a good team of survivors will be doing gens, so you aren‚Äôt as likely to get the other three. 
---
it‚Äôs a valid strategy. speaking as a survivor main, killers don‚Äôt have to cater to what constitutes a fun game for the rest of us.
---
Unpopular Opinion: Having an ability that puts a hard cap on chases isn't necessarily a bad thing.
---
Use your power immediately once the match starts, go to the farthest generator and look for survivors. Try leaning to stalk as it exposes them about twice as fast. Also remember to use your power once it's recharged during chases as it gives you no Terror radius or red stain and can really confuse them. Just a few quick tips.
---
Where was this confirmed? 
---
Asking for a friend xx
---
Oni's perks are super weak. I don't know what planet you are on that makes you think otherwise.
---
I legit only do it when I know there is a survivor right near me and even then I don't directly sit in front of them, and if I know that survivor is not around anymore I might move along but then come right back to be sure. The only other time is during endgame collapse.
---
I mean, different races doesn't add anything but pandering either.  You can't even see half the killers' skin.  It's literally all there for character building.
---
Now we just need a thic female killer all we got is spirit to sorta fit that role
---
Oh.. hmm that isn't good at all
---
Gens all done, survivors in eyesight, a slug and a near finished gen real close. That being said, make laps, staying right in front of hooked guy can let teammates get close and coordinate
---
Nothing says "deep wounds" like a cut that seals when moving!
---
I don't think endgame collapse should automatically signify that you should camp. Especially if nobody has escaped yet

Annnddd the basement is even more crowded
---
I never said anything about ranking up. Getting a black pip is piss easy, once you get to rank 1, it's nearly impossible to derank. Pipping in red ranks however takes a fuck ton and usually requires a 3 or 4K.
---
;)
---
That would be fucking terrifying. And Rin charging you with a fucking war club.
---
Don't forget there is an archive challenge to hook people in the basement. A lot of killers might just be trying to get their tome done and not even be aware of the bug.
---
Then why play survivor since youre guaranteed every match to be doing the very thing you describe as unfun?
---
Take out the extra and your statement is fine. Then repeat process for permanent free rifts
---
Thank you for your contribution, DecutorR.

Not bc I think that‚Äôs balanced. But I wanna know what being God feels like.

out of pure boredom. who said i play survivor though? definitely play killer more.

Small price to pay for salvation

I‚Äôve never gotten above 38 and I‚Äôve p3‚Äôd most of my killers. The lowest was like 35 or 34 because I went for a lot of fancy add ons.

I just played my first match against him. Genuinely creepy. Him raging out and storming the halls looking for me was terrifying

Yea you shouldn‚Äôt throw a game bc someones being annoying i usually do the opposite ignore them and go for the others bc most of the time the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù person is the best out of the group and knows it so they want ur attention to waste your time etc thus if u go after the others u have a better chance at actually winning and winning against a annoying team is way more satisfying then camping the tbagging claudette well the others leave.

That guy seems like a bit of a Jackass

Thanks for the response. Only spirit for me tonight lol
---
Damn it. Thanks for telling me.
---
35-40 with good RNG
---
I play both, but I do tend to enjoy Survivor more. As far as balance, most of what gets termed balance issues are just players' inability to adapt to different playstyles/Killer strategies.

This sub has such a weird relationship with tru3. Sometimes you'll find a post that saysnsometjing good about him and everyone in the comments agrees, but sometimes you'll have a post that just absolutely shits on him

Like I can see *why* people may not like tru3 but goddamn they are just such assholes about it always.
---
Good for looping and swf but the Nerf kinda kills it
---
Hopefully their rework of the Legion will be soon üò•
---
It's also helpful to crouch when you get unhooked. It's just a solid way of letting them know you're not about to run off
---
It's because of the basement hooking, they're in the void falling and couldn't see the trap so they didn't trigger it, could tell they were in that bug because they were humping the wall.
---
Well a peruser of the fine arts at least XD
---
You can‚Äôt rly complain since you where gonna go to struggle
---
Well watch his games he never relies on straight slugging to get a 4K and obviously it requires a 3k that‚Äôs what I was saying. I always consider a 2k a loss
---
Yes it is? Mend time is the main purpose of his ability. It‚Äôs quite literally the only part of his kit that isn‚Äôt working against him. At the end of the day, if a survivor escapes, they have to mend. Well not anymore! Now they don‚Äôt even have to mend. This change has absolutely FUCKED legions that get a hit and lose the survivor during a hatch competition. Not only does mending take less time, they don‚Äôt even have to mend anymore. A 5% increase isn‚Äôt going to do shit. STBFL was the only thing that made him viable and he doesn‚Äôt even have that anymore because they devs are more worried about cOnSisTanCy. And his add-ons were not a buff lol. They didn‚Äôt even fix the ones that needed major fixing. They just took the garbage pin add-ons and changed them to be on the same level of garbage. It‚Äôs just different garbage. I agree, he needed speed buffs. But unfortunately that wasn‚Äôt supposed to come at the cost of everything else keeping him from Freddy tier. He‚Äôs the worst killer in the game, and they nerfed him lol.

There was 1 gen left dude I could of waited but at the end of it all she let the other guy die and also sacrificed me to the killer and escaped lol

He has a somber expression,for he is a shadow,master of stealth
---
that just sounds fucking absurd, like how the hell did they think that was ok lmao, makes me wonder if with the blink addons you could have up to 6 blinks back then?

No problem.

The best part is we now have this same experience with Ghost Face.

Exactly! I want Jeepers Creepers as a killer more, but hoes are really mad when anything Fnaf is brought up. Because "fANbAsE" and "ChiLDreN" like, lmao every game has a group of kids playing it. Fnaf is just one of them.
---
I did the opposite, and now  I regret it
---
Still not worth a Hex perk
---
The movement speed while reloading addons are the most useless
---
indeed
---
Well they do make changes based on PTB on shove them in to live servers and thats when magic happens every time. Normal devs change and test again till it is all okay
---
Picking them up doesn't fix it, healing doesn't fix it. As far as I can tell, getting out of the basement blind can fix it though.
---
Yeah, build a chair you can kick out from under you when you end up wanting to hang yourself. Playing Legion is suffering and it's our only way out.
---
But for real you can try healing slowdown perks + ruin. You become a shitty Plague and good survivors will stay injured and use how you become an M1 killer to loop you, but it can be pretty fun. Mindgame practice will come in spades.
---
The Wraith combination I use (got booped earlier today)
---
https://ibb.co/7jztnsR
---
I don't know what's more annoying.  Oni or Spirit or Freddy.  Good job BHVR.  Each new killer you release just makes the last ones obsolete.
---
Ive gotten to 42. You have to be smart and just go for most of the brown addons
---
Game development is not simple. I don't advise attributing to malice what can easily be explained by like, the practicalities of code and coding.
---
Huh?
---
I don't understand how this game looks so bad tbh. It runs on the unreal engine, one of (if not) the best engines for games. Would love for the to do a complete overhaul.
---
Bugs happen in every game, and Behaviour isn‚Äôt a massive company like EA or Activision. 
---
Game design is complicated as fuck
---
This happened to me and I has to restart my game to get it to go away. At least it's not in a terrible spot.
---
i mean, i get this is a solution for ragequits but how can behaviour think this is okay when the game is falling apart with new bugs all the time?
---
there is always something, right now when you get hooked in the basement is game over because your screen turns white or another color, before was something else and in the future there will be other things too.
---
and if is not a gamebreaking bug, is an unfun match. is it supposed to be halthy to be forced to play against something or someone that is intended to be unfun except for the person that is playing it? (eg. spirit, instadown huntresss, instadown clown, sandbaggers,etc etc)
---
i think not..
---
Why leave the match with a blood party streamer though lol
---
I believe it's a bad glitch from being hooked in the basement :(
---
Is nemesis legion still broken? If so, theres still one way to run a viable legion
---
r/absoluteunits
---
Aw, what the hell? I was hoping there would be No Mither meta for a while until Oni-mania wears off. These blood orbs should really only be appearing with puddles of blood or something.
---
WAAAAAAAAATH
---
lol! your replies are spammier than the spam
---
ure too kind. lol
---
... have you actually played him??
---
Yeah I avoided doing this for my books bc It sucked when I was playing survivor
---
I mainly use detectives hunch, balanced landing, self care, and I switch off between urban evasion and we'll make it.
---
They should just remove Deep Wounds as a status at this point; it does functionally nothing. 
---
Make Borrowed Time give Mettle of Man endurance to the rescued person instead.  Same effect really.
---
they weren't apologetic, they put a heart.
---
Thank you for the quick tips. I always feel rushed as the killer because I feel like the survivors are better skilled than me, so will move faster.
---
Be careful when using excessive emojis on reddit. It's an easy way to get downvoted.
---
This happened to me before, Ran right over my fucking trap, Luckily i had another so he didn't make it far but it's pretty stupid.

I gotta use that masked cosmetic though lol
---
Huntress is top 5 honestly. Shes just so damn hard to use that everyone thinks they suck whem in reality, they just cant play her.
---
Clown is fucking dog shit lmao
---
Back then it was just different. As survivor you had much more tools (double as much pallets, faster healing etc) allowing it to be much more bearable as beginner. And also, everyone sucked, killers aswell. But nowadays... Offf, I can't hardly imagine me buying this game in 2019 and playing solo Q and actually enjoying it like in 2016. Solo Q is probably the worst experience in dbd, especially for beginners.
---
They need to start nerfing pig and stop nerfing spirit ):
---
What's up with the basement
---
same, my second hook was just a black screen till 3 seconds after the unhook, after which I saw Kate falling forever deeper and deeper into a cloud-filled void
---
Hey that's the screen i saw at the end of every oni game i played today!
---
Except for Jane who is absolutely crapping herself
---
well now I feel bad for my basement 3k D:
---
Indeed
---
Adrenaline, ds, borrowed time, dead hard and unbreakable on high ranks
---
I am not even gay and I think David is handsom
---
Killers move around the map more, they are faster. If a surv is "doing their job" as you put it, they aren't going to be wasting time pre looking for hatch, BBQ counters looking for hatch if you are looking for hatch as 2nd last is dying, and its almost always run on killers, and the hatch close is actually favoured by killers. If a surv and a killer are both on top of hatch, the game favours the killer and will close the hatch, even if the surv is in the jumping animation.
---
Also the devs said that 2 survivors escaping should be about average. That means making something slightly survivor sided in endgame is necessary for it so be anywhere close to those numbers.
---
Yes exactly! I had a super toxic Feng,  she vaulted all game,  t bagged,  and just did anything she could. I ignored her,  got a worse team mate,  then got her t bagging with blood warden,  felt good! Lol. Literally got a 4k,  and hate mail. Haha. More killers need to just ignore them,  but then sometimes they take it out on the rest of the team which sucks and will camp/tunnel whoever they get. Camping is just a shit strategy to me,  and should only be used for end game and hook rushing,  other than that you're trash imo.
---
RIGHT?! It‚Äôs totally not fair that her traps can‚Äôt be taken off and are only stopped if another survivor willingly puts themself in the unhealable injured state. 
---
Like, hello, did the developers not even watch Screwdriver 10?!?!
---
The most meta survivor build:
---
-Adrenaline (Meg Thomas perk)
---
-Decisive strike (probably the best survivor perk the game, belongs to Laurie strode)
---
-Exhaustion perk (usually dead hard or balanced landing, but balanced just got nerfed)
---
-Borrowed time (available on Bill) or Iron Will (Jake park)
---
None of them got ds or borrow tine.. Hardly a rank 1  challenge.
---
Might be just a coincidence. What map was it? I got basement hooked on the new map and nothing happened.
---
found the guy who takes the game too seriously
---
An you are basing this off what exactly? "whatever facts" the devs drop? You are fully aware they will never show anything that will cause a uproar, lol.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been called a toxic camper for staying at a hook when I see scratch marks.
---
You and I aren't watching the same streamer if you think Otz doesn't slug, because he does a LOT, like any good killer would.
---
the joys of swf
---
That happened to me first match. I was like wtf?!?!?!
---
careful, decutor will get u!
---
Lol slugging and continuing a chase are two different things
---
Fr i wish i could cancel it at at any point and just m1
---
üöú
---
everyone downvoting you underestimates how stupid redditors can be
---
Had a guy accuse me of abusing the bug when I was getting basement hooks for the rift, wasn‚Äôt even thinking about it but he *insisted* I was an evil, fun-ruining bug exploiter. BHVR pls
---
it might be to just kill them all again, but then again i got the white monster one even though someone crawled into the hatch
---
The problem with trans/bi/gay stuff is that its either a 1 liner pander to be "inclusive" or its half the story talking about it.
---
There‚Äôs two types of camping, face and proxy if you face camp your a jackass if you proxy because say you saw marks around the hook and you know someone is there that‚Äôs fine imo also camping during endgame is fine what else can you do lol
---
If I see ttv at the end of their name
---
'SPLODEY BILLY
---
Reddit is just a shit place with dumbasses pretending to be smart.
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt know how they did it so later I played oni and same thing happened
---
I know, and my point still stands. You don't actually watch Otz.
---
Which youtuber are you talking about I haven't seen this video yet
---
I've always wanted a barebones gamemode no perks no bringing in items and no addons only relying only in the ability of the chase to win instead of crutch perks
---
Legion is the new pig
---
I don't know how else unless it's points in particular categories because it was a good match. I'm not gonna complain I'm just curious. Now I can put some actual perks on. I got BBQ on my first web and ruin on my 22nd so I'm pretty jazzed.
---
Got hooked so hard I fell through the floor and couldn't get back up. Nerf Oni ÔΩ°Ôæü(Ôæü¬¥–î`Ôæü)ÔæüÔΩ°
---
I‚Äôm like rank 6 too so how the hell is he even near that lol. Not that rank 6 is good but still. You hate to see it.
---
I hope to God that he gets a rework eventually. Fred was shit too, so bad they gave him a second chance and now he's very good. It's clear the devs don't actually want Legion to have the deep wound effect, so his ability should just do something else. Hopefully something that also changes how coming off cooldown works. He's supposed to be about frenzied stabbing, but stabbing someone twice just gives them extra boost while you stare at your hands.
---
Everything about Legion and how he's handled is just so awkward. I recommend playing another killer unless you're just fucking around. Keep an ear out for changes, I guess.
---
custom game
---
What? I can see the levels of my team in the end of the match and blame
---
You just need a merciless so it is possible, I got it today and 2 people killed themselves first time being hooked, its dependent on your total score/medals rather than if you kill all 4 now so you can still get it with one person escaping.
---
Did you double pip?
---
Today I got downed early by a camping bubba and only made 3,000 blood points with my escape cake :( feelsbadman.jpg
---
My main getting a rework?!?
---
Yeah I believe so. Do you think that's what it was?
---
Not to mention clown‚Äôs rework made him a flat upgrade to Freddy. Thank god the devs fixed most of the bugs and gave console an optimization patch but the balance is still ridiculous.
---
OK sick. Thanks.
---
right now its bugged, when ever a survivor gets hooked down there they will enter the void and technically its game over since you literally cant play anymore, theres been a bunch of vids on the reddit
---
Is no-wiggle on both pc and console?
---
EGC or when you notice that the Claudette is in the bush 5 feet from you.
---
I just won't play
---
they sweatin
---
You could say the same thing about anything that appeals to minorities.  Everything is just a publicity bit anyways, the game designers don't care, it's just whatever will make more people like the game.  Make a new DLC w/a lesbian character and you'll draw LBTQ supporters in, while homophobes wont buy the DLC, or will ignore the one line.  Net gain.   
---
  
---
It's impossible not to 'pander'.  Naturally sliding it into the story as 'when X broke up with their BF and took a walk in the woods entity ate them', people will say it's shoehorned in and doesn't add to the story, then when they write the story about how they felt discriminated against or whatever, others say it's too focused on their sexuality.  Someone's upset no matter what you do.
---
I‚Äôm on console it happened to me and my friends a lot when they killer would pick you up it wouldn‚Äôt show a wiggle netter and then. After being hooked you get this screen
---
Oh yeah i love when he complains about something , make a video around it , then still 4k its so funny .
---
"3 GENS DONE IN 14S , THIS GAME IS BROKEN " 4k
---
Or when he was playing a perkless nurse at rank 1 and cried because he "only" killed 2 survivors , this guy is so funny thats the only reason i watch him
---
Yeah it‚Äôs way too easy for survivors to win. They need to add killers like Ghostface or a creature like Weirder Stuff‚Äôs demomonster. Oh and take away survivor weapons way too strong. 
---
That said they should really take away the Hillbilly‚Äôs cool down, he‚Äôs just a lame knockoff of Leatherface and I‚Äôm tired of seeing him in every match.

It seems random. I saw it happen to a teammate on Ironworks. I got on a corn map.

And then they say "nice wallhacks" in postgame

Yeah you cant go to such extremes, the guy is pretty useless but giving him back one of the main factors that got him reworked in the first place is not how things should go, and its even worse considering that it didnt even make him strong, just utter cancer to go against

I dunno man. The game is pretty, uh, messy. DCs already don't get any points, and we've all had games where everything is just shit whether it's the perfect set of OP perks or swfs or just a god awful connection. I think bhvr just needs to make a better product.

2 Great survivor perks vs 2 "Meh" killer perks
---
First new killer I've played in a while now so that makes sense.
---
I feel your pain
---
I wonder if maybe Valve didn't want them profiting off of Bill while letting them use him, and so his inclusion and cosmetics are free as a result (and that's why it's taken so long for us to get one for him, since they don't wanna spend resources on something they can't profit from)
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt it be justified? You‚Äôre stating it like it‚Äôs somehow not.
---
lol I love otz. watch his streams too
---
Same.
---
You mean the video where Scott started to argue against tactics that True never even said?
---
Thats when you be toxic as hell. Get that leatherface save the best for last noed incidence. Or play plaque and camp first hook.
---
Even if all 4 did have no mither, sure you cant use your power, but everyone is 1 hit then. On top of that it only counter oni and if any of the other 17 killers are played you are nerfed so hard it's a free win for the killer. Also over 1000 hours in dbd and I've never once seen 4 no mithers. It just doesnt happen. You cant look at one extreme case that's insanely unlikely to happen and say it would be to strong in this case. Especially when the perk is straight up garbage in every other circumstance. It's the worst perk in the game. It definitely could use this niche buff.
---
You join her. Her mass exceedes beyond human limits becoming almost unrecognizable. The *UNIT* eventually devoures all.

Murdered by morning. I'm done. X.X
---
Yeah, I saw it happen. Someone got hooked and their aura dropped through the bottom of the map.   
---
While I'd like to think people would use this exploit.... I'm gonna have to avoid playing the game until it's fixed. Because my team was destroyed after 2 people got hooked in the basement.

he went through every point tru3 made in the video as well as another video proving his theory crafting works. Regardless of the point of the videos. tru3 doesn't care about his fanbase being toxic against Scott Jund meanwhile he bitches when a survivor teabags or clicks their flashlight like it's a big deal because the randoms are being "toxic" to him.
---
Yea, he didn't slug in one game, that, of course, means he never slugs. 10/10 logic.
---
I have the same exact problem
---
It seems whenever the new killer hooks me in the basement my screen goes yellow and I have the falling action. I am assuming this is not intended?

No mercy

Alright, lemme just pull up this god pallet you forgot to break because you wanted to keep bloodlust for that one pesky survivor. Just in case he needs to run you back here and re use it and get another 2 gen loop around it :)

Can't wait to see the mom
---
That's oddly specific
---
They did that like once lol
---
you get iridescent for not getting downed what‚Äôs the point avoiding a single hit
---
&gt; Solo survivor is so hard as is and they just continue to make it harder. That was the one thing that at least gave me some measure of hope when queuing up. I don't want to be rank 9 with rank 15 teammates, its not like there is a lack of rank 15 teammates you could match them with instead considering I get in to lobbies with unique ones all the goddamn time.
---
I feel you bruh, I don't want to be rank 2 with rank 8 antimates, before that change I can easily dodge and find new lobby with red ranks

You got that freaking right. It‚Äôs fun lol
---
Where did you learn to count?
---
Exactly!
---
SO Cute!!
---
yup game is unfun, impossible to run anything but meta perks. All i play is SWF teams that tea bag and click their flashlights thinking they are really good at the game, meanwhile i am running adept Onie and gens get done in 5mins yawnnnnnnnn. This game is seriously not fun to play
---
You'd still all be 1 hit downed. Easy win regardless of not being able to use your power. And 4 no mithers literally has never happened in my 1000 something hours in this game. Itd be annoying sure, but the risk is insanely not worth it. Especially since you have a 1/18 chance of even vsing oni.
---
I wondered what ‚ÄúMurdered by Morning‚Äù was until I told myself ‚ÄúDead by Daylight‚Äù
---
Otz is love
---
Instead of just a select few killers being powerhouses, all killers should have that same killing ability as the rest. And if the base power concept is the issue for that killer, buff it so that it can be more effective against survivors. Same with any ‚Äòbad‚Äô perk in the game.
---
The CEO of gens
---
So you wanna remove his ability completely when versing no mithers especially since it‚Äôs not just for a one hit down. Now he looses his map mobility. Yea nah i don‚Äôt think so and I play survivor more
---
Ok thx
---
David and Jake you meant. They even got the pride month outfit.
---
I solo survive and I usually use: spine chill, iron will, ds, and dead hard. I swap between spine chill and adrenaline tho.
---
Mm yes
---
Bill: what are they doin‚Äô
---
Steve: they‚Äôre just standing there, menacingly!
---
Fully healed. Because balance.
---
Everybody keep saying that but I've played it a few times tonight and no it doesn't seem too dark at all. I'm on PS4 playing on a 65in 4K TV so maybe that has something to do with it.
---
why the fuck did this get downvoted wtf
---
Again, 4 no mithers literally never happens and even if it did everyone is 1 hit.
---
And he looses his ability to rush around the map
---
I dont know why you got downvoted, your right he plays both. That is a fact.
---
The 1 hit is irrelevant
---
Only fix ive seen is getting picked up by the killer, although this usually means getting hooked again immediately so you could potentially become blind again immediately.
---
Bloodhound. Idk why but I‚Äôm shit at tracking. Bh helps. Plus makes hemorrhage useful
---
Ok...and?
---
He's got a point. The most ive ever saved up was 9k and thats just do get new chatacters. Took me like 60 levels or something. Thats almost 240 games which take anywhere from 15-30 mins. Thats 60 - 120 hours. And I'd imagine most people play dbd for 3 hours a day (more or less, im going off of what me and my friends do.) Thats up to 40 days to get 9k. I think 8 perks is fine, or update bi weekly. Either one works
---
No it isnt
---
He looks like he‚Äôs wearing a mask of his own face
---
Most of the people who hate tru3 dont even watch his videos
---
In his wraith day stream he literally made a joke about how people will call him a killer main because of it
---
Is this the pure white screen glitch? I've seen it twice tonight.
---
I think if the chase goes on for more than 45 seconds, the Entity should fire the killer into orbit
---
im screaming
---
So, it seems that shock theocracy will be directly in front like the current shock, and static blast will be AoE? 
---
Very interesting on the backwards spin skill check. That's cool
---
The static charge addons also seem rather interesting
---
How do you just not stun the killer if you want to win? If you don't stun the killer ever then you aren't looping very well and get steamrolled. In a normal match (not every survivor sitting on a gen with toolboxes during every single spare moment, because that's simply not realistic) then you can't just run away from a killer without using a pallet if you want a hope of surviving. So yeah, it's technically a counter; Just as No Mither is a counter to every instadown perk.
---
This is definitely tru3 (get it...... I made a joke... Nvm) however i understand why people think negatively of him as he is very direct with what he says which isnt a bad thing, i personally prfer the directness myself.
---
Opposite for me. Ps4 is still just freddy ghostface and plague
---
Man. What the actual sam hickory fuck is this? Buffing BT... okay, why? but more importantly, nerfing Legion.... **WHY?**
---
same
---
Where‚Äôs Ash tho?
---
Dead hard 
---
Adrenaline
---
(Controversial pick) self care
---
Spine chill
---
Decisive is SOOOOO overated it's circumstancial and only 1 use congrats u now have 3 perks and u bought urself 5 secs 
---
Self care and dead hard together can make a nasty combo against Micheal Myers for example I can 99% my heal so that I still have dead hard so if he finds me in teir 3 I have it on standby and if he finds me in teir two I still have dead hard and I basically have an insta heal spine chill is the ultimate counter vs stealth killers
---
He's got a point. But they look cool
---
It‚Äôs like if DbD was aborted during the first trimester
---
Oh really. Dearie me...hot fix soon hopefully.
---
Deep wound was already a joke anyway.  The main purpose of it is that it creates a distraction and forces Survivors to tend to mending themselves for a bit of time, the only folks who go down to it are memers or folks blissfully unaware of how it functions.
---
Meanwhile Legion's movement functions in Feral Frenzy got buffed, so he's faster _and_ can vault faster than Survivors, making it much easier for him to run around and apply Deep Wounds to everyone and create disruption on a more consistent basis.
---
I love this and you so much
---
No, just the meme format is.
---
Just change the invert button but ya it happens to me too lol

Thank you. Finally someone that plays legion that actually uses their brain

It's not as easy as "not stunning Legion," though. You either stun Legion or let them get a free hit on you. It was a lose/lose for survivors

Really wish it had Funky mode
---
Specifically on haddonfield and sanctum i think
---
Interesting it shows the Killer name and possibly the players gamertag(?) above Legion.
---
So annoying
---
Haddonfield actually but it happened again on sanctum. It might be just those two maps since haddonfield had the garage bug and sanctum is new so maybe it‚Äôs just those? Idk
---
I think the issue most people (myself included) is that while this keeps old Legion away (good) it just nerfs the rest of Legion for no reason. This isn't just a nerf to Nemesis Legion, it's a nerf to Legion as a whole for 0 reason
---
Yea apparently thats intended which is fucked up theres a huge skill gap between people just barely getting into purple and rank 1. They do that to lessen queue times but holy shit is that harsh.
---
The amount of people I have seen who were excited for the old Legion BS to be brought back with Nemesis and Beast of Prey is insane. 
---
Every time I have seen it brought up and there's someone who's against they always get dismissed with something like "okay survivor main". I tend to play killer a lot more than I play survivor and I still think it's BS
---
sometimes it happens sometimes it doesnt.
---
Damn so thats why the moderators watch my account 24/7 and lock my late night posts an hour after i make them
---
I don't think this will help the Doctor that much. His chase game is garbage and instead of working on that they buffed his tracking ability. I hope I'm wrong but knowing BHVR, they'll find a way to fuck it up.
---
You are clearly the trash survivor here , self Care and empathy lol this guy just assumed you were at least not a potatoe and have things like ds or adrenaline , just git gud at some point
---
Shugo, the roach and a lil but of shaman with his mori when he rips out the tongue
---
You‚Äôre probably thinking of vigil before they changed exhaustion.
---
Balance?
---
You get the heal because if you're hooked and it activates, the second you're unhooked it triggers
---
PERRRRSONAAAHH!
---
.
---
(Is this ok?)
---
Dude I hate getting slugged too but are you gonna really post memes about it all day everyday?
---
Worst part is they don‚Äôt even have borrowed time most of the time. Just crappy team mates farming me off the hook. That‚Äôs why I always run DS it‚Äôs my own borrowed time for when I have bad teammates or if I‚Äôm actually being camped in the end game collapse.
---
I completely forgot about that. I was like an hour into editing, and when I saw that was like "Shit. Well, I'm not going back and doing that again." Idk, might redo it with the clown cuz another person mentioned it
---
Not fun or not super powerful? The two aren‚Äôt the same thing.
---
so is this only in the basement? i‚Äôm scared to play now
---
I just say "oh that sucks i didnt know" everytime. If i want to put you in the basement you're going in the basement. They showed no mercy with the Wake Up! Glitch.
---
30 second gens give me ptsd

Thank you.
---
Why, did you not know how to use it without abusing it? I'm using it all night and nothing has changed in the way I play and it's still just as useful.
---
Why would I wanna play a harder billy? I don‚Äôt have to play pick up the bread crumb simulator to use Billy‚Äôs power
---
The slam attack really feels like it needs a bigger hitbox. Or just give the default attack in demon mode standard range? It feels like trying to hit people as EW1 Myers.
---
I dunno, I really like his design but he's really discouraging to play.
---
Yea I basically am baiting them because it‚Äôs funny to see their reactions. But I also posted a meme irrelevant to slugging earlier and they reported it for spam so I decided to post extra slugging memes. 
---
Legit the only meme that got deleted for spam was a meme I posted once
---
I disagree I like all the new maps from the aesthetics to the feel of them, I really like that there's no more overly powerful loops. Now you actually have to know the maps and when to move to the next loop.
---
Not just new map, the game is considerable darker too
---
I mean that's entirely possible too but I'd rather hope that they're gonna go for a rework. Especially since hes really the only one in the game that actually needs one.
---
Or they might have been trying to do a basement hook challenge
---
He was trying to do the trapper challenge. He usually plays Nurse.
---
I thought it was a glitch when I first started playing. I was so confused and got screwed over so many times until I found out
---
He didn't leave actually
---
Watching a team mate get the hatch? Personally I like deliverance decisive strike head on firecracker t bag.
---
Still good meme
---
PS+ was $45 on black friday
---
YES, I run it for the same reasons and they all try doing it for challenges. Like,  sorry to tell ya bud but you need SAFE unhookings lol.
---
Yeah I've had this a few times before
---
Should've put a Billy somewhere on the image
---
New maps aren‚Äôt great, Sanctum of whatever is too dark, Hawkins is unsafe as fuck.
---
literally keep going against killers taking advantage of the basement bug. Theres the basement bug on top of the no wiggle bug so its not like you cant just run away from the basement. You can legit get basemented from almost everywhere.
---
achievements &gt; anything
---
not even being sarcastic
---
It's just dumb. There should be an option to toggle it to auto. You don't even have to tap the button that fast, so it's just a nuisance.
---
Honestly just seems like a bug, it makes no sense why you are capped at hitting only on degree angle on console , if you are playing red ranks you are not going to hit anybody during a charge.
---
You get a first person view of the entity
---
 Because when I play upside down it‚Äôs easier
---
Yeah, I agree. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use items as survivor or meta perks. The game is already survivor sided enough as it is, those things just make the game insufferable for the killer. Plus, I don‚Äôt get points for escaping fast
---
I mean you can literally look at them and they still wont work anyway
---
Bow down in coming threw (I'm a p3 Claudette)
---
What's vigil?
---
I don‚Äôt play console, but I definitely think there should be a limit degree as base. Bit like Billy‚Äôs curve
---
It's better to farm than to let you go into struggle.
---
Ummm...na that‚Äôs not the case 4head good try thoüëçüèº
---
Did you seriously just post a stock image of a laughing emoji
---
Tbh I used oni with one perk on the newest map and 4kd easily and I was honestly playing like dogshit imo
---
Was just looking to see if anyone else noticed this. The frames take a shit using anything regarding his power besides absorb. He feels terrible and honestly I find Billy and even Nurse easier to control than this guy.
---
isnt clown better?
---
I get why they do it, but it's stupid. I play both pc and ps4, while sure I can get a macro for pc(might be bannable idk) I cant on ps4. My controller is gonna end up breaking solely bc of this game. They need to change this. Whether they remove it completely or at least just make it to where you can hold a button down.
---
Does it really matter that much to you?
---
I just always use Franklin's Demise, it makes hits feel so much more rewarding. But I've just accepted the fact that some games are just unwinnable, a 4 man SWF with items and DS and Borrowed Time, and dead hard are just matches where the best you can do is fight to safety pip. Just my personal experience atleast, I'm a rank 1 Killer main on console.
---
Yes billys chainsaw is more reliable then Oni on console, and you can curve on console, makes no sense why he capped on his club.
---
because hes the newest killer and all loud and stuff. obviously
---
I only just noticed my phone auto corrected Yui to you

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5ugzq/got_put_on_the_back_hook_in_the_basement_and_got/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Huh, your opinion just kinda shocked me. He feels pretty different from Billy to me since my favorite part of billy is his early game pressure. Not having the power always up really feels bad compared to Billy. He feels closer to Michael for me
---
If you‚Äôre wondering what I mean, here‚Äôs a comparison
---
-Right Click allows you to weaken loops via slowing a survivor. 
---
While yes, for Freddy‚Äôs to work, they have to be in the dream, but unlike clown, he doesn‚Äôt have to reload. On top of that, he also can teleport, and slow games.
---
Her concept art promises muscles that ste not present! I need muscles!
---
No. Ask anyone and they‚Äôll probably say Freddy.
---
I agree 100%.
---
https://youtu.be/BmvLexamrmk.
---
Here is a video templet for it
---
Blizzard has that sweet sweet Chinese cash my friend
---
Yeah, people will say "Give it time!" but he doesn't FEEL right or good to control or on console. 
---
Billy and Nurse has movement adjustments that can be jarring to new players but you can get a feel for it quickly and learn the logic of the movement quickly. Oni feels like shit every time I use his power.
---
hold the attack button only a little before releasing it for the best oni slam attack
---
I think it should be skill checks, and the killer perks could affect them, so your team would have to prioritize saving you over gens and then maybe the speed gens get done will be tuned a bit indirectly?

What even are dedicated severs and how do you get into them?
---
If you have to stun the killer to loop well, I‚Äôd say you need to work on your non-pallet killer-evading techniques. Further, the killer‚Äôs power should not preserve the strength of a survivor‚Äôs strongest looping strategy. It should counteract it. Don‚Äôt make a bogus equivalence with no mither, you know it‚Äôs bullshit. 
---
If pallets are more numerous, more pallets can be chained together if left unbroken. This may surprise you, but you can leave a pallet before the killer breaks it in many situations. 
---
Sadly we‚Äôll never know how nemesis legion would‚Äôve fared outside of hyper controlled KYF matches of the PTB we saw so often. I really think a week on live would‚Äôve told us something real.
---
No, ask anyone and they‚Äôll probably say Freddy. Also, echo my other comment for a tl;dr explanation.
---
If you don‚Äôt break god pallet instantly you deserve it honestly. There is no counter play to that loop otherwise with normal m1.
---
My favorite killer is Jake Park in Murderer by Morning
---
*chase music intensifies*
---
Yeah, i already know that, when his hands turn red and shit, but the attack itself seems hard to hit, harder than billy, but it could just be because im kinda used to billy's physics
---
Yep, beast of prey was absolute bullshit. Nothing a survivor could do about bloodlust. But that‚Äôs not a legion or deep wounds problem, it‚Äôs a beast of prey problem. And yet this is the *solution* we get.
---
cry
---
As the kids say, bet
---
Feel's bad
---
I‚Äôm not great with any of those, but as a new PC player, I will have time to learn and practice those things. I want to use Demo so I can take advantage of the overpriced dlc. I was going to buy Freddy, but I hear the survivor has pretty bad perks, and I‚Äôm mainly interested in the survivors. I‚Äôve played the game on PS4 but I‚Äôm still quite new, so I may not know what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
Spirit is just a better wraith
---
Oni rocks only for the killer, where it is an easy 4k every single round.
---
Ty
---
Just played against 3 with oni. Someone deadass called me a tuneller when they all looked the exact same.
---
I dunno man
---
I dunno...
---
Looks like copyright infringement to me
---
I forgot when i started playing
---
Oh.
---
So I got 3 people hooked down there once...
---
Unbreakable and resilience too
---
The number of killers exploiting the basement bug is to damn high.    Ban those fuckers.
---
Isn't it like 40% or something? I had half of my charge and I didn't fill it after a hit.
---
Shhhh it‚Äôs a coincidence
---
That needs a lot of work and testing to make them all equal and may take forever, but not trash should be doable.
---
Temple of Purgation is dogshit.
---
He doesnt at all, top tier killer probably
---
I mainly want to play as him just because I would be playing as the Demogorgon if that makes sense. I‚Äôm a pretty big Stranger Things fan so playing as Demo just seriously appeals to me
---
Im not calling for an increase to gen speed on this post im just asking for people that have this mentality to explain it a bit. But if they did just want to straight up increase gen times maybe they could scale it by rank
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm glad there are some people who thinks he‚Äôs still viable, I would really love to play him
---
youd be fully healed because when you wiggle off you are in the injured state, if they drop you but you dont wiggle free you will be injured
---
Happens to me after just about every game and sometimes when I load in the menu
---
China would just want to make them get more money, not less. Just look at Diablo immortal.
---
So that point is not relavant at all.
---
Why not? Quick heal, slower heal with an item. Double healadge.
---
Thanks, but as I said, I am switching to PC. Hopefully this won‚Äôt occur on PC though.
---
I think the flashlight is enough to irate him but not enough to burn him!

Same can be said with bill. No one will slug you.
---
It‚Äôs just a meme mane nun serious, but I can see where u coming from but unfortunately that wasn‚Äôt the case here. I‚Äôll explain, i ran the killer the whole game so they can complete gens Plus I had already did one myself. Ran him enough for 3 gens. then got farmed and then again the same nea came to my face on the hook and left me on the hook(I cut it out to make video short) And waited by me till the other guy got downed and farmed me again when the killer got close to us Pretty much set me so she can escape. Sucks to do all the looping just to get flawed out by randoms u feel me. I still double pipped tho üëçüèº
---
yeahhh
---
but worth it though
---
No he does struggle, yet to make final conclusion like you as it‚Äôs first day with changes.
---
No wiggle bar and basement hooks are the biggest bugs I‚Äôve seen in this update so far. Pretty damn brutal bugs too. Haven‚Äôt noticed too many on the killer side but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised lmao.
---
It's not Oni, basement hooks in particular are causing all sorts of issues.
---
No I never abused it I just took it off because steamers said it wasn‚Äôt as good and to run DH now
---
Chill. Don't hate the people playing the game normally as it should.
---
I don‚Äôt want to play anymore, more like
---
the thing is people on PC can crank their mouse DPI separate from the game. ever seen someone play on 2500 DPI? I have and it's crazy the shit you can do with it. 
---
On console you're limited to only the in-game sensitivity and it hurts us BAD. ever seen the insane difference between console Nurse and PC Nurse? A PC Nurse can literally do full 360's DURING a Blink, console Nurse? even at 100% sensitivity I can only turn about 90¬∞ it's fucked.
---
It's understandable to have no control of your fanbase it's another thing to feed your toxic fanbase more toxicity with subsequent videos after the comments had already rolled in on their videos whenever he sees a spirit. While at the same time in his most recent video he gets salty about an ace being "toxic" while knowing himself that he's won the game because the ace got cocky. I wouldn't know these things and more if I wasn't a fan that watched his videos as well the other entertainers for dbd. You gotta admit that he influences his fans to agree with him that survivors need nerfs that killers need buffs meanwhile as previously stated he massacres almost every game with a "low tier" killer and he shoulda got a 4k in his most recent video if it wasn't for rng spawned key that still led him to a 3k. Literally complained all game and still killed 3 survivors that if it wasn't for the rng key would have killed all of the survivors with a killer that he's getting his feet wet with still.
---
Thx for the advice I‚Äôm gonna try it again
---
They'd look cooler if I could actually see them.
---
For people that complain about him bitching a lot this is a really whiny sub
---
"If you're nothing without nemesis then you dont deserve to have it"
---
We need lawbringer as a killer!
---
For shock dailies you definitely need to throw moldy electrode on at the least. When I play doctor I always have something on to increase range since it's so awful as is. But ya doctor is probably long overdue for a rework
---
I have not seen a single person post anything negative about it. Got any proof?
---
Use this website, it's so easy I'm sure even an ludite would use it.

 [https://imgflip.com/memegenerator](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator)
---
I have never seen such good perks for survivor in a shrine, since i‚Äôm new. Welp, instant buy for the perk of decisive. That‚Äôll save me time and money.
---
Freddy is a top tier killer now.
---
Forget any tips you'll get for it imo. Nurse is rough on console but she's still playable. Billy's chainsaw moves perfectly fine. Oni is basically broken on console, especially when bloodlust kicks in which will happen because survivors will 180 and 360 your ass into oblivion. 
---
Of course you can get a hit if they're cornered or at in the open, but right now he's a no-go for me. Way too limited in movement on console and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it's bugged.
---
It's time for consoles to actually be optimized.
---
I do. I'm there now!
---
When you make a whole status literally do nothing but make your screen bloody and dark lol

If a survivor escapes form the killers grasp the killers stun takes priority over the end game sacrifice. After the Ds stun wore off ace got sacrificed
---
Nope purple ranks team was just useless
---
Such as? We get a brand new killer with new powers and a new set of addons what ‚Äúnew content‚Äù are you looking for?
---
Alright, fine. Take your upvote.
---
It wasn't a buff or a nerf?
---
You get 50 extra
---
Shinobi killer next patch or riot.
---
Then cry for nerfs.

I had a really fun last game (which is so rare now days.) I was playing my legion and right off the bat the David DCs. So I felt bad. I decided "I'll just get points from them but I won't kill anyone." So I spent the whole game just using my frenzy and letting them heal, stun me, lead them to gens, etc. I ended up with over 40,000 blood points and didn't hook a single person. Every survivor that stayed got at least 20,000 so it was really nice.
---
You seem like a child who shouldn‚Äôt be around a keyboard. The dude‚Äôs right and you‚Äôre a clown.
---
Too bad you got downvoted OP, because that indeed is a weird and a stupid build
---
I thought it was Nea at first lul
---
give them sporks instead of knives. or just spoons.
---
ok i can kinda see hillbilly, and *maybe* ghostface, but fucking myers? how is he unfun to play against in any way?? this is the most rank 20 comment i‚Äôve ever seen
---
That sending dudes to lockers is a super great idea. I would love to see it.
---
i‚Äôm a console player. y‚Äôall sound like killer mains who always dc the second someone pallet loops you
---
Thanks mane
---
and how is he right when he didn‚Äôt state any thing factual
---
What have you done to my ginger princess
---
[https://i.imgur.com/S3GpSIm.png](https://i.imgur.com/S3GpSIm.png)
---
Yeah I had the same problem for me i just needed to pause and unpause it and some other stuff
---
Ok that is pretty cool. ‚ò∫
---
I had the same thing happen to me!!! I had a Nea who got caught in locker and it wouldn‚Äôt let me grab her out! I had to DM her asking her to kindly DC because I was doing a tome challenge and I didn‚Äôt want to lose that. This patch really really hurt that game we shouldn‚Äôt have stalemates where EGC doesn‚Äôt work and one person has to DC :-(
---
So this explains why I've been missing so many hits tonight.

---
Yea typo on my part
---
That wasnt nerfed because it was never a thing...
---
Bruh this guy is the sweatiest saltiest killer main on this sub. Guy literally bitches and moans about everything (specifically about how keys are broken) and makes autistic ass comments every chance he gets. He‚Äôs a baby rager for sure
---
Ohh gotcha gotcha
---
it barely comes up. its supposed to come up a lot first week. i need that damn trophy. i get bad luck oni killers every time i get that map
---
Basement bug, plus I don't get A or D notifications when grabbed by killer. Game is completely broken for survivors. Do not log on.
---
Ok thanks for the response.. I‚Äôm still going to buy them when I have the chance tho since he seems like a really fun killer to use
---
But once the killer does deal with those actions, many survivors will blame the killer not the game
---
yeah dude, that was my problem yesterday lol. Felt like a total beginner because it was very hard to hit someone. And if you miss a hit, the surv is already 50m away...
---
It was nice because I would lead them to gens, totems, pallets and they could get their points. 
---
I would down someone and let the other pallet stun me so they could get points too. Everyone escaped, I pipped.. Its a win win. I wish I could do it with more survivors tbh
---
No-no-no, clowns are supposed to be funny. This guy is more likely miserable and depressing. Like an orphan. With no arms..and legs. With progeria. Great, now I feel sad
---
we just got our 2 most viable killers nerfed and BL was nerfed, but is still very powerful, but yeah bhvr only cares about killers sure
---
bhvr doesn‚Äôt just care about killers, they just don‚Äôt care at all. as long as they keep shitting out cosmetics and dlc they keep making tons of money and have absolutely no fucking reason to balanced their game
---
honestly i can agree but if iron maiden would stay and Hex anarchy go in the place of mad grip.
---
Its delightful to play ghostface üòÇ
---
Nice b8 m8
---
hahahaha
---
Uh, it was. Survivors used to drop more blood than they do currently, and he used to gain more from hits. I wasnt specifically referring to bleeding=blood orbs, I was talking about how easy it was for him to get his power on the PTB. I for one like the idea of no blood equaling no blood orbs, offers some perk counterplay but considering the perks aren't strong in their own right it keeps the problem at the "Calm Spirit vs Doctor" level.
---
it means BHVR ran out of ideas for perks
---
I rarely play survivor and would know not to pick the pallet up.
---
I don't sit around waiting for a killer instinct proc unless the survivors go full urban immersion and I can't find them. The portals allow me to very quickly check all of the generators without having to drop a chase or letting the survivors know that I am aware of their location, thrilling tremors gives me some tracking and clutch slowdown if I down/grab someone on a 99%'d gen, and by placing portals between the portals on generators I can actually get hits on the survivors I spot instead of them just scattering.
---
What a very nice individual!
---
I like the one big cheek on the side lol
---
There they are!
---
To make hemmoraged survivors drop more orbs would make the effect actually useful.
---
Besides, if no blood = no blood orbs than it only makes sense that more blood = more blood orbs. Wouldnt really be fair to allow survivors to completely deny him of his power with no workaround either.
---
Steve be looking like a snack
---
Could no one tell you weren't being serious?
---
When I play survivor, that chase music scares the shit out of me
---
I suck ass in both those games so I know people are overall chill, they call me bad and move on with a 4v5.  
---
Legit does it really bother you if other people have an advantage over you that its worth sacrificing the complete feel of the game. This games win condition is already fluid, just add swf to that pile, if you beat a killer solo then feel better than if you beat him in swf
---
He's the one actually doing gens while everyone else plays immersed
---
Now you can turn into a werewolf
---
Idk. I felt kinda bad cuz it wasn't his fault he got hooked two times in a row.
---
If i hadn't seen this post i would have accidentally been one of them, been trying to get the basement hooks archive done. Sucks that i have to wait a couple weeks or ruin some matches for folks
---
falling down the basement stairs fixes it. I've done it 3 times
---
I can see the annoying factor adding to the hate, sometimes it's nice to have a quick little match instead of drawing one out. I noticed that most of my Legion matches that I recorded were around 18 to 24 minutes, and my matches with Ghost Face or Bubba were somewhere around 9 to 14. 
---
I think Legion is a pretty neat set of characters, with an interesting concept. I come from a smaller town and you won't believe how quickly a group of bored kids will start doing some wild stuff just for the fun of it. Especially when an edgy outsider comes along.
---
Same here
---
I don't really care if you believe me or not but it happened the killer wasn't smart at stopping loops
---
A person of culture I see
---
Yeah i have had a few killer mains like that and those are extremely rare matches. But i am grateful when they happen. Had one killer grab me off a gen and spin 6 billion times while i wiggled and tried my best not to Vomit Lol but still had fun with it.
---
I agree. Personally, I wanted the addon rework to focus more on the shock therapy ability (addons for increased stun, decreased shock delay, etc.) instead of adding more gimmicks to Madness. Doc doesn't need more tracking, he needs more chase potential.
---
Sexy
---
Dbd is the biggest reason why only friend can message me on Ps4, I think its kinda sad how far it has come
---
It isnt fair that Killers are faster than survivors, but here we are. Balance takes priority over realism. It would be far too strong, Oni already is teetering on the border of uncountable and balanced. And there is a work around, I'm not sure what you mean.
---
We currently have a grand total of 2 perks that remove blood from your survivor. No Mither, and Lucky Break. No Mither is one of the worst perks in the game. Being broken the whole trial and still making injured noises is not worth the cost of countering Oni's power. But it's there. 
---
Lucky Break removes blood for 3 minutes of injured time. It has a set amount of time it will work, and the Oni will still be granted Blood Orbs from hooks so it isn't a huge issue. A counter? Yeah. But like I said, it's the equivalent of running Calm Spirit hoping to counter the Doctor.
---
I've played against zero Onis today. Only one I saw in one of my games was...well, played by me and it was a pretty decisive 4k.
---
I can see their point of view on that aspect, I think part of what I like about them is their ability to slow a match down and pressure the survivors. I play pretty good with Legion and my favorite part of their gameplay is just always herding survivors around the map.
---
Onegai!!!!
---
I respect for TrU3 died when he tried to claim that he invented sloppy with Nurses and Thana on Wraith and Ghostface even though that build has existed for Wraith for almost 2 years.
---
I mean i dont think so, u can still get his attentinion to start a vhase if you havent used all of ur pallets which if ur a good survivor should him around for the time of a no ruin gen
---
Adorable.
---
Most viable, as if killers aren't dominating survivors at every level of the game lol.
---
Iff i only had one perk id chose left behind
---
Are you possibly a bill?
---
Which is?
---
I hope you don't find using a Mori as a jerk move cause that's also in the game

This exactly. I had to go totally private because of the people in this game lol.

---
Heres a timeline
---
Tru3 uploads videos discussing spirit counterplay.
---
Scott uploads counter to his theory crafting.
---
A small amount of Tru3 fans are toxic in scotts comments section.
---
Tru3 uploads another video of him outplaying spirit using his theory crafting and using that as his counter argument against scott.
---
Tru3 fans are toxic to scott in tru3s comments section.
---
Days pass and every spirit video where his theory crafting actually makes a play makes a point to dismiss Scott as someone that doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
Tru3 fans in stream and comments are toxic against scott.
---
Tru3 accepts it and doesn't stop.
---
In terms of the rest of the argument:
---
Tru3 is an og and a damn good killer
---
Tru3 complains and whines that killers need to be buffed and survivors need to be nerfed.
---
Tru3 plays arguably the weakest killer in the game.
---
Tru3 massacres nearly everyone he plays against with the "weakest killer"
---
Tru3 still complains survivors are op.
---
Tru3 complains about toxic sweaty ace in his new video. (He's being a hypocrite that's the point because he's a bystander for Scott and feeding his fanbase while bitching about the toxic ace)
---
If it wasn't for the understandable bs that is keys Tru3 would have 4ked with a killer that he's not comfortable with. Limited perks such as T1 Pop goes the weasel. Still thinks that survivors should be nerfed.
---
I wouldn't know this if I wasn't a fan of Tru3 but i'm not a fanboy that ignores this just cause he can be entertaining/informative from time to time \^\^
---
Yup today i played with full team of rank 20 im 6 btw
---
It is in my opinion.
---
Nice discussion skills.

FUCK YOU UGLY ASS DUMB IDIOTIC DEVS FUCKING NERF KILLERS YOU PILE OF SHITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks
---
Why? This shit belongs on FB, not here...
---
It's been Freddys, Ghostfaces and one sweaty slugging Pig tonight for me.
---
If you don‚Äôt think Oni is comparable to Billy... and can‚Äôt see why indoor maps hinder their power... on at a loss.  It‚Äôs like talking to someone who‚Äôs against the idea of climate control. Even with all the facts, they refuse to believe.
---
specify which loop
---
I did try to get his attention but he just refused to chase and stuck on patrolling gens. At the start of the game he was fine but as soon as he got two kills he just wouldn‚Äôt chase. Earlier my teammates cleared a lot of pallets so the only ones left were in the area he was patrolling. I was trying to lure him away so my teammate could at least start a generator but he just wouldn‚Äôt leave.
---
Game balence shouldnt let u win every game hes supposed to be more powerful than u
---
The killer being faster than a survivor is balanced or else they couldnt catch them...
---
Oni is plenty counterable. He roars incredibly loudly before slowing down and using the power he has to earn that doesnt last very long. It gives you plenty time to hide. 
---
Hes also hard to steer and has trouble around circular loops.
---
If you ran into someone using no mith and they didnt drop blood orbs they could just loop for 3 minutes. The killer doesnt get power for hitting or blood. That's a target he could never get any power from, he needs some way to stop it.
---
Oni is given roughly 10% of his meter when he hooks someone, and that's being generous.
---
Calm spirit only counters the screaming portion of doctor, not his entire power.
---
guess you're in the
---
next gen
---
EEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
Nope. I play meg or feng or nea i find the guys less stealthy.
---
new players please stay away from urban evasion and self care lol
---
Fuck you too BHVR
---
Had that today, mine was green, basically lose all aspects besides background haha I got mori'd out of it...
---
Resulting to insults because shit at the game haha
---
Lmao, every game series has kids so what difference does that make? And the demographic isn't children, just young teens/young adults
---
Yes, same thing i was in the basement and i also free fell.
---
I had borrowed time, plus bill still had the helmet so I didn‚Äôt think there was much I could do for him in that situation, it worked out regardless.
---
Game breaking bug... yeah it'll be around a week. Fucking bullshit
---
Was it on the new map?
---
The movement speed was not meant to be taken literally, obviously I know why Killers are faster. That's why I'm saying. Mega should be faster then Clown, but she's not for balance reasons. Balance&gt;realism.
---
As for that, I'd recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/DioP0OxLtQ0) for some insight to what "uncounterable" really means in regards to the Oni. It is based on PTB Oni, but the points are still relevant. The tldw is that even though you know he is coming you still cant do anything about it. Like a reverse Spirit, you get fucked either way except this time you get to see it.
---
We do, but Sloppy Butcher is very meta and already in a very good place. Perks should not affect Powers directly like this. If SB increased Blood Orbs why would you _ever_ take it off? Every single Oni would run SB, no ifs and or buts. Its double dipping, you get slower heals _and_ you buff your power? That's what's called OP.
---
A No Mither survivor will not run an Oni for 3 minutes, at least, not unless the Oni is bad. Oni is 115, and No Mither is a one hit. You catch them off guard, which is easy with Oni's TR music, and they can be down before they even make it to a pallet. The Oni wont get Power, yes, but that is counteracted by being able to quickly end a chase and put pressure on the survivors through hooks.
---
And the main strength of the Doctors Treatment Mode is locating survivors. No screaming means the Doctor has no clue where you are within his TR, unless he runs specific addons to counter the counter. Calm Spirit counters the strongest part of his kit.
---
No it‚Äôs not his job is to make sure gens don‚Äôt get complete while getting as many kills as possible he probably wasn‚Äôt chasing bc u were running to a safe pallet or a safe loop next time don‚Äôt 3 gen yourselves.. that being said if there‚Äôs only 2 people left he‚Äôs a pussy for not chasing .. and next time before doing gens try and find a key by opening all the chests
---
*Legion now enters cardiac arrest upon moving*
---
*Legion will now stab themselves if they miss a survivor. On miss: hit yourself. Idiot.*
---
*Legion now asphyxiates when using their Feral Frenzy*
---
Balanced got nerfed but it's still very good. Dead Hard would be better now imo but the dedicated serves were a solid Dead Hard nerf
---
Haven't noticed nothing too crazy besides The Oni but I do feel like bloodlust in particular took a hit with this update.
---
To be fair, they probably DCd because they were in the void.
---
Yeah I did open all the chests, and I know we three gened ourselves. The moment I saw it I was like ‚Äúoh shit were fucked‚Äù. Thanks for your comment

---
Yeah, because holding M1 to do gens is much more exciting than holding M1 to mend...
---
Oni is not uncountable, theres plenty you can do when you know hes coming. Oni in the ptb did not, his flicking was much more accurate and pallets didnt stop his power.
---
Now you can run him in a circular loop, which makes it incredibly hard to hit, or just hide.
---
Some perks already effect powers directly. Trapper has hangmans trick. Freddy has PGTW. Legion had remember me (but they nerfed it for no reason).
---
With no mither you get access to a free deadhead. A good loop can easily go for 3 minutes, especially since he does not have a power, and that survivor would have no fear of giving him his power.
---
He also has loud footsteps to accompany his terror radious, which isnt that quiet.
---
Doctor can track with his hallucinations to. He can also stop vaulting with his static. The point still stands that capm spirit does not completely turn his power off.
---
If survivors that didnt bleed didnt drop orbs he would need a way to stop it period. It's either a buff and a nerd or neither can happen.
---
Chronic DCers should be moriable on first down even without a mori equipped. They should be happy since they don't even have to bother leaving the match, the killer will delete them out of the game for them.
---
I didü§£rip to the killer
---
I read it wrong. Lmao. 
---
I drop chases unless they start to teabag. That‚Äôs just not nice. Then bubba gets the last laugh.
---
I‚Äôm shook this has been up for hours wow

God damn it u wasting those pallets hurts my brain

The grind would be fun if it didn‚Äôt take 10 minutes to find a match. Optimization. Is. Their. Biggest. Problem.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5vffc/basement_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Nope I've dealt with it 3 times now and it's the killer putting you in the basement to initially blind you then once you get off you have to wait till he knocks you down again then puts you back up on the hook then you can see again. You never get blinded after you get put back on.
---
Lol no I‚Äôm just watching YouTube on my phone waiting for it to put me into a game
---
A good killer never respects pallets, for every time you get a hit on an unsafe pallet that they missed a stun on you miss 3 hits on someone that kept running
---
It‚Äôs just your camera so they still see you. Try to guide yourself up the stairs and fall down. That seems to reset the camera.
---
Why not just add this to deliverance
---
Some incredibly strong loops can last more than a minute. Really good survivors know how to play them, and oni has no tools to mind game.
---
Stealth is absolutely a counter to killers, but it's only one of the options I mentioned. I also forgot about jumping into closets to force a grab, or simply stunning him to knock him out of it.
---
If survivors did not leave when injured than oni would not have a power. Doctor still has a power. Bringing him up was pointless. 
---
If you cant get away from an oni, that's on you. He literally has no power half the game, and he takes time to activate it, and he tells everyone hes used it, and it's easy to dodge.
---
I agree actually. Oni is pretty fine where he is.

I thought the only viable flashlights were green with green add ons or higher. Havent used them the entire time ive played the game
---
I had a game where i was blinded after being hooked, went into struggle phase, got unhooked, downed then picked up again and i could see.
---
Then i got hooked again right after and my screen turned white again as i was dying.
---
Lol, this is probably the right response to give.
---
Dude there so many bugs in this update I‚Äôm honestly shocked. Basement, wiggle, medkit charges,  it‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. I have to use self care or inner strength to heal because medkit are fucked right now and you can only heal once.  This shit is so dumb.
---
True...   
---
I have Nurse,Plague and Oni left to do from killers .... getting there
---
Bhvr: working as intended.
---
Man I'm sorry to hear that, yea ive heard and seen the glitch so ive been staying away from basement hooks so I dont break anyones game. I downed someone right next to the stairs and the nearest hook was so far away they wiggled off, didnt make it far, they actually got closer to a hook in the end lol I hope they figure it out soon.
---
I‚Äôm only left with oni. Haven‚Äôt played him yet
---
Well, we both know which ball your fondling every morning judging by the defensive comment and insta dislike. LMAO
---
Dont feel bad she is the best girl in the game ; )
---
I mean their marketing for them/him whatever was all over the place. 
---
The teaser image looked like a psychopath with four personalities making us believe it was a form swapper depending on what mask he's wearing.
---
The Trailer was just dumb for making us believe we'd actually get a killer disguising as a survivor. With David getting stabbed in the back.
---
... and what did we get? Go fast, stab fast and be an annoying little sh*tstain. There was so much potential and I don't even know who thought we needed a killer like this.
---
I‚Äôm not a survivor main so why even bring that up? If you actually know how to zone survivors with his pounce then he‚Äôs pretty strong, and a lot of people think the same. His portals are kinda meh but if you bring Discordance or BBQ you can make better use of them.
---
Dude, if I hook someone and I hear survivors around im not going to give them a save. Ill patrol until I get them.
---
I understand that the Legion can be frustrating to play against, but nerfing an already weak killer to the point where it's unsatisfying to play as, it's a bit much.
---
What ? where
---
I was wondering why my brown medkit with extra charges ran out exactly near the end leaving me empty handed
---
As a killer I eat almost every pallet. Some pallets in some situations are fine to respect and mind game, but the general rule is to NEVER respect pallets which is something I learned mostly from playing survivor and punishing killers who do. 
---
As a survivor I will always play as if you're going to respect pallets until you show me that you won't. I'll also take a hit instead of throwing down certain pallets way too early in the game (like shack pallet). I do whatever I can to avoid using pallets as much as I can. I learned pretty quickly from playing killer that survivors who don't take full advantage of pallets should be thanked for their service towards your cause.
---
They probably never run if they ha e urban evasion equipped, lol. I use it as a means to sneak around the killer when needed, otherwise I run and leave scratch marks. And I e solo queued enough times to know not to trust my healing to teammates, lmao.

---
That window is so broken it‚Äôs insane. It‚Äôs literally a free generator for the survivors
---
Played a few games as oni today. Needless to say there was plenty of tbagging and gen rushing going on.
---
Understandable, you saw a survivor near the hook so you stayed close instead of blindly walking away allowing them to unhook for free
---
I have to agree. They should have buffed the basic range on his zap.
---
If you chase the same survivor for 5 gens then your wound is sort of self inflicted lol.
---
Not only that, but my balanced landing has a 50% chance to activate when I'm not exhausted, but even if it doesn't activate, I still get the exhausted status effect.

---
At least my update was this big. Did you play on the PTB? Or did you not play in a longer time?
---
Never respect pallets survivor will alyways try to loop as long as they can by one single pallets when they see you dont respect them you will trigger them to throw them down. So you can aboid getting stunded or you will hit them through the pallet
---
Loops can last a minute, yeah, but Bhvr has been moving away from that philosophy and more towards short but plentiful loops. Plenty of short loops on newer maps, and they'll only become more prevalent as they rework more maps and add more too.
---
Stealth is acknowledging the lack of counters, actually. It's pretty much saying "I cant win in a chase, so I'm going to avoid it at all costs." Now mind I only mean in regards to Killers whose _only_ counter is stealth, namely the Nurse. And to some degree Oni.
---
Since the change to his power loss upon picking up a survivor a locker grab is not much of a counter, as if he was in the early stages of his power he can get back to full very quickly.
---
Stunning the Oni does not remove him from his power.
---
Oni would still have a power. He gains meter over time and still gains blood orbs from hooking, so even against a 4 man No Mither team he would still be able to activate his power.
---
Hes in the same boat as Plague. Yes he has no chase abilities but since he is a 115 speed Killer he can still chase and get hits easily. Activation time is negligible, he doesnt have to go to shrines or some shit (thank god) to turn it on so it isnt much of a drawback. Even knowing he used it foesnt help much. It's like Tier 3 Myers. You know he has it but so what? Sure you'll be more aware, but that's not as much of a counter as it is just playing more alertly.
---
It's not that easy to dodge though. It's like backrevving as Billy. You just have to wait for the Survivor to make one mistake and you get an instadown.
---
And same, I really enjoy the Oni. Friendship with Billy ended Oni is my new best friend.
---
What you don‚Äôt realize is there‚Äôs so many pallets on the map that you could literally play them all ultra safe and if the gens get done it doesn‚Äôt matter how many pallets were thrown. A wasted pallet is only when you get hit and then immediately throw the pallet after

I usually do this as well, I get protection hit + chase points, killer gets chase points + hit points.
---
Not to mention aura reading too
---
Disclaimer: Its the survivors fault if you commit to them the whole game and you lose, because they didn't stop so you could kill them. And Solo queuing is MUCH better than "bad killer matches" especially when you die first hook. Especially.
---
Ohtofu does submitted gameplay and talks about it and what they need to improve on it's very informative
---
He cant actually get his entire power through his recharge now. It stops charging at 98%.
---
Yeah oni doesnt have many counters, but at least he has more than the other two top tiers.

---
It‚Äôs entirely possible to be competitive and not aggressive. But this needlessly aggressive and patronising tone is exactly why some people don‚Äôt like Tru3 or his most diehard fanboys so thank you for helping to illustrate my point.
---
Oh you already downloaded the game? Then I have no idea why it is ten times my download size. Feels bad man.
---
Will happen when getting hooked on the basement you cant do anything and gotta wait until the killer comes back and finishs you off
---
I play DVD to watch Shrek 3, thank you very much.
---
&gt; I want the killer to check for no reason now, I want justice.
---
Allow me to introduce you to Diversion
---
well at least you got your laughter to coup with doc
---
I‚Äôm getting flashbacks from the ps4 Spider-Man game on the hardest difficulty
---
PC or console?
---
Stops at 98, but even if no blood orbs in NM you still get 2 for hooking someone. 
---
And Yeah hes fun and I dont feel the guilt like I do when playing Spirit (old spirit, actually. Haven't tried nerfed Spirit.) Also I'm a console player so Nurse was never an option, not with these frames.
---
I know ffs. Had to wait like 4 hours smfh
---
Not sure I get this one?
---
Pre nerf legion players don‚Äôt have a brain, let‚Äôs be honest
---
Try setting your dpi down, that was a temp fix that worked for me months ago on my new rig - turned out to be some power saving setting on my motherboard causing it long term but that might get you at least playing.

---
Guys, the devs have done some great shit in the past several updates and this is just one mistake. Yes, they should fix it much sooner than in a week, but still.
---
His power is awful on console. Massive playability issues. And every Oni I play against is an easy escape. They might land, like, one demon strike the entire match
---
Deep wounds is trash and only is good with borrowed time. Just remove it and give him a new power.
---
Why did he censor the word *ABSOLUTE UNIT*
---
Wait what did they change?
---
Ooh might honestly be The Onj just because it's so satisfying to bonk one person then run across the map bonking everyone else
---
Huntress, so I can play a first person shooter. If I had all the dlcs though, ghostface looks fun.
---
Who the hell bloodlusts god pallet
---
Fair point
---
I once tried hiding behind a tree as Claudette with the gypsy outfit. I think the Huntress saw my red butt, because she lowered her hatchet, shook her head and walked away.
---
the killer was trash that's the only way you got the save cause you garbage
---
Not a perk, just the action to do it not actually get into the locker. I don‚Äôt want some timer or perk slot I have to take up to open and shut a door for noise. Just like throwing a pallet down or something.
---
No, Auto Haven.
---
That's been exactly my experience so far. :(
---
Yes. It is a known bug. There will be a fix. Apparently in 1-2 weeks which is bull shit. It wins games for a killer if they get a basement hook.
---
I‚Äôll try this, thank you.

Old legion just broke the game and was awful in every way shape and form, so people have PTSD from that

---
I think 45 minutes is long enough
---
Doesn‚Äôt make it less painful
---
Yeah i'm on xbox and it takes me like 10 minutes to find a killer game, but only 10 seconds to find a survivor game
---
That this was only me. I play on xbox and it's very dark.
---
lol fair enough. Do what the first guy suggested then where you slowly get in, fast vault out, and walk away so you don't leave scratch marks. Its a few more steps than being able to slam the door, but it does the same thing you're looking for.
---
First game, first hook, has this happen. Was great.
---
My experience with Oni has been rather pleasant I've been getting 3 and 4k consistently and haven't "lost" a match yet  and his ability is easier to use unlike hillbilly where I suck with it. The only problem I got with the Oni is Demon strike you need make sure you line up your shot and even then it's difficult to hit them
---
Huntress is really fun to play also plague just puke on everyone. And hagster is great setting traps like crazy and slap everyone to death
---
Those perks make me think of players who crouch around the entire map the second they hear a heartbeat. Never once touching a gen because they‚Äôre hiding in the corner or running and self caring for 5 minutes after getting hit every time.
---
Whats with the basement?
---
All the 3 original maps include stupid powerful infinites. They could definantly use a redesign.
---
Ghost face is really fun, when I got the game on sale he was on sale, and obviously had to snatch him for $3 lol.
---
Lol he hasn‚Äôt even been out for a day
---
That's a terrible way to play.
---
What map? I've had it twice, both on auto haven
---
To be fair I would rather have a solo survivor game where I die on the first hook than a really bad killer game. At least the bad solo game was probably faster to get through and leave to find another match. With the bad killer game sometimes it feels like you have to just sit there and take your beating when its obvious that you're being destroyed.
---
And that‚Äôs 90% of my teammates for ya. Solo queue on Xbox is painful.
---
This is actually the worst time in the world for them to release the DC changes and then have this shitshow of a bug show up. When it happened to me I couldn‚Äôt even attempt to get off hook so my options were wait to be useless since I can‚Äôt see my way out of basement or DC and get a penalty.
---
Poor doctor
---
My friend has been getting a lot of 4K with him so far. He ass struggling at first but learned how to use the power
---
So you've been dying to him a lot then? That's okay. 
---
I mean, he is a new Killer, so you need to get used to his play style as a Survivor.
---
Unfortunately if a large enough outcry of 'Oni is OP' happens, especially in the early weeks of his release, nerfs will happen...Killer Mains will lose their sherbert.
---
That's good to hear! I'm pretty alright with Hillbilly - so maybe I'm playing too similar to him?
---
The Demon Strike is the frustrating part for me. Maybe I'm relying too much on it?
---
You're right in that regard, it gets much worse as a solo queue. It's a privilege to die first hook.
---
It isnt taking the game hostage but it's a waste of time, I'd rather just get a 3k then waste 45 minutes hoping to turn it into 4 without committing to a chase.
---
Yikes this is well very spicy take imo 1, if his orbs disappeared then he could track survivors by blood giving him more tracking, 2, his ability and how fast he can get it relies on how the survivors play meaning don't get hit at all or long as you can and heal instantly. 3, if he just got his power from the orbs it would be easy too difficult to get the ability as they just give a tiny bit.
---
Why not DC the second you see Spirit is the better question
---
I haven‚Äôt seen him do it to an individual. It‚Äôs typically when he and his chat are going off about an opinion he has that others disagree about, e.g. Spirit is balanced. He‚Äôll sit there and go on about how everyone just thinks she‚Äôs too strong because they‚Äôre all unthinking sheep who get their opinions dictated to them by others (which is both patronising and hilarious, considering how many of his fanboys just blindly agree with him). He seems unwilling to accept that some people just don‚Äôt have the same experiences and opinions as he does. It‚Äôs all ‚Äúfalse narratives‚Äù.
---
Right, I‚Äôm about it I‚Äôll have to try it.
---
It was a reply from a dev on their forum.
---
Ah, I'll just have to put in more time then. :)
---
Why not just give the survivors a chance to loot a gun?
---
Ya he‚Äôs only been out for a day after all I‚Äôm sure you will figure him out sooner or later.
---
Ghostface and wraith
---
üíïüíïüíïüíï
---
Don't rely on demon strike at all rely on his demon dash as it gets you around faster and it's easier to hit survivors as it's more like hillbilly so if you're used to hillbilly use that most of time, also you can break pallets with the strike so definitely utilize that.(also he's pretty different to billy so don't play Oni similarly to him.)
---
Doc is just awful right now. His power is only useful if the survivors can't handle the effects, the hallucinations and skill checks are useless (without restraint add-ons) and T3 dosent stop looping in any way so the survivor can still easily run you. Only good thing is the short stun from his zap attack preventing vaults or pallet drops which isn't that huge. Docter should really get some changes that aren't reliant on survivor skill
---
I wanna have the hagster, and i kinda suck with huntress :(
---
It is possible to activate, but in my opinion even if you get it once in a blue moon, you are wasting insane amount of time by sticking around chased teammates and healing up all the time instead of doing gens. And most of the time taking a protection hit to activate MoM is not really helpful  at all. So imo the perk is harder to make good use of than playing no mither and surviving. MoM is just a meme right now.
---
Its not hitboxes, its your internet connection to the host (killer). You problably have some latency issues. So it might be worth your time to look at your internet connection. Check your Nat type, nat type 2 or lower is viable. Always use internet Cable over wifi.
---
His screaming scares me more than the music. Same kinda scary as when Demogorgon came out, except this one comes at you 100 MPH and a one-hit down. So even scarier.
---
He looks fun indeed and way easier then hillbillie
---
Endgame challenge for survivor: just use borrowtime and farm one person at the endgamecollapse dont fear to die you might have no other option you just need 1 save rescue.
---
Endgamechallenge for killer: obviously you need noed so avoid taking other hex perks so you have a higher chance the survivors dont kill all your totems. Combine noed with remember me and bloodwarden and any other perk you want. Here is how you should do it: make sure you get 1 survivor out of the game before the endgamecollabs or at least try to hook multiple survivors twice. Once all generators are done try to knock down as many survivors as possible. Then open the a gate by yourself and look them with bloodwarden. This way you should be able to make it
---
Idk why instead of changing legion, or nemisis, they changed deepwounds
---
Yup, it's a similar situation for me. The only Oni's that do well are the ones who don't use his power.
---
And these are red rank killers.
---
He mustve put his controller down to eat a sandwich or something
---
What irks me is when he says ‚Äúmy build‚Äù and then repeats it in a mocking tone. Been running that exact build on GF since he came out, but I don‚Äôt remember Tru3 using it, or even acknowledge him as a good killer.
---
I wonder if y'all did this with Tapp when Adam came out ü§î
---
Now that is gonna be one hell of a balanced landing... feel sorry for the killer :/
---
You don't need to be good to use a Mori. You need to be good to time a flashlight save and you will be wasting time chasing the killer. Don't even compare both. 
---
Moris are accepted by only killer mains. People like me who play both know that it's bullshit.
---
I think about this all the time. Sometimes I‚Äôll pull off a juke that makes me wonder how the killer even let me get away with it, then I double back and realize I‚Äôve probably been on the receiving end of the same thing.
---
I wanna know who‚Äôs dc‚Äôing against Myers lol
---
I fully agree, we need to have Doc's power buffed for dang sure.
---
Not bullshit enough to be removed
---
I've seen exactly that and then pretend they invisible because baby survivors are adorable
---
You didn't deserve the kill anyways.
---
More like i dont want to play anymore because they killed my main and 1 of 2 killers i like to play
---
1 Stop playing the game after a rank reset, and then try and get it.
---
2 Don't give a shit about achievements because they don't give you anything.
---
Those are your only two options.

Dude! I was in the basement as well, when I got unhooked and healed and it stayed like that and I couldn‚Äôt see shit. Then I finally got downed again and when the killer picked me up it all fixed and my second hook I was back in the game. But died on it so..
---
Gg

yes

Walk a mile in these louboutins
---
Same people who would pallet stun legion if this change didn't go threw is my guess
---
Ah forgot there was a survivor and killer one, I've done the killer one but the survivor one is what I'm having trouble with. Is it really just waiting for the opportunity to arrive? In the 7 or 8 hours I've played today, there have only been 1 or 2 times someone has been hooked in the endgame collapse because people will 99 the gates and when I go and open them myself someone has usually unhooked them before I can get there.
---
I really wish the adept killer challenges were just 4K's. Anytime I get the urge to go for all the achievements in this game I remember that the emblem system kind of blows and lose all motivation. Its far too frustrating to handicap yourself for the achievement, get a 4K, and then have some arbitrary system be like "mmm not good enough".
---
I didn't get the kate shirt or the hound mask for huntress
---
I don't.
---
No, the killer just leaves you alone to run around like a blind rat since it's 1 less survivor to work on a gen. Every killer I faced tonight did it to at least one survivor. They're all using Iron Grip. The last round I just ate the DC and quit out. Well done, BHVR. The new chapter is a lot of fun. "I ThINK WE dID a PReTty GOoD JoB so FAr"
---
Same!!
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
i got adept oni my first try, the first time i ever played as him. but i'm rank 17, so it was supposedly easier ppl. the match was very long because with the last 2 i refused to hook one until theyre both down, but then one was too close to bleeding out so i actually had to carry them and let them run away just to buy more time to find the other first. i lucked out and found the hatch, so i was willng to hook the harder to find survivor, then stood on the hatch until i saw the last in the distance, then closed the hatch and chased them to a door. i acted like i'd let them open the exit gate, then i did the one hit down attack and hooked them. badda bing badda boom
---
"Literally uncounterable"

"IF you got stunned"

Try reading those 2 again and then carefully thinking about what the counterplay might be.

Trapper. The utter satisfaction of getting someone to step into your traps is most fun thing of all.

Idk getting mad you didn't get the map you wanted seems like a rage quit to me
---
So basically Irishman.
---
Yea its more or less just luck to get the chance for that type of rescue
---
Him being a dickhead and not hooking is on him but doing 3 gen strat on 1 of the weakest killers is fine and he knew if he chased without a guaranteed down the other would blast out a gen. When playing killer youve got your back against a wall sometimes. 
---
Having got rank 1 i can never be arsed with that and will just take the 3k and chase 1 surviver unless the swf annoys me. But i can respect the clowns strat.
---
If survivors 3 gen themself then it inherintly gives the killer an effectice strat on a plate
---
Personally, im having fun with him. Its just very challenging to hit people but its possible.
---
Happy cakeday
---
His base kit is fine. Everyone is overreacting. Even the worst killer is strong in games that suit them. His power was never meant to down people. It was a time waster. Meant to output damage in a fast span of time. He's meant to hit as many survivors as he can before his power ran out, and then transition into a normal killer. That's why they bumped his movement speed up to 115. And if we are going off statistics here, clown is the weakest killer in red ranks. A noob stomper in the low ranks. But gets crushed in red ranks.
---
nice
---
Boi I'm a feng main
---
They've already acknowledged it.

That's exactly what it is.

Yeah, I remember facing the Wraith style Ghostface builds right after the buff and they were deadly. I tried calling him out on playing ignorant and claiming old builds, but he just ignored me. I‚Äôve seen other people call him out on it, including other streamers, and then he wonders why he gets hate.
---
Removed for highlighting multiple disconnects
---
I politely disagree, inner strength requires you to have found a totem then have a locker to go into. Second wind is about as situational as By any means ( I can‚Äôt remember the name) needing to have healed someone before your first hook similar to deliverance.
---

Monitor and abuse and tinkerer are very good on him, both reducing his terror radius. Otherwise, no. His terror radius is the normal 32 meters.

---
That is a rage quit though?
---
Shit mate I feel bad no one could see your sarcasm.
---
Also legion needs to use an asthma inhaler every 50 seconds, otherwise the entity gets displeased and kills them.
---
It's weird seeing people complain about things such as Freddy being able to chase survivors until the timer winds down. That's how it always used to be before Legion was released. Legion's existence has effectively turned it into an extra health state.
---
Blatant repost

As survivor I rarely d/c but if I do its because I'm being farmed/the team is farming with killer or its blatantly obvious another survivor is working with the killer. But when I was a baby survivor years ago I would d/c if I wasn't having fun.
---
oh well, thanks for the reply :)
---
Platform: PC
---
After kicking a generator, as the Trapper, I couldn't move anymore. I had to quit the match.
---
Is it a feature or a bug?
---
yup this doesn't really address he cant chase well even if you play shock only to deny interaction.
---
Has the music changed since PTB?I played a few matches during it now I feel like it's different for some reason.
---
My game fixed itself from this twice, once when I got unhook spammed and the other when I got unhooked and somehow navigated my way out of the basement
---
Thats an Amazing idea

But devs wont make it happen cuz it will be hard to make and difficult to counter imo

Use the perk unnerving presence and kill all survivors before they can open a gate. Then you should finish the challeng. if it wont work try another challenge it could be bugged
---
I actually feel bad for doc
---
I wasn't around for old Legion, what was so game breaking and powerful about them?
---
There's little point to using Blood Wrath aside from cleaning up Blood Orbs because the charge isn't controllable and the lung has weird hitboxes and gets blocked by obstacles 99% of the time. Use charge only to cross the map, and use the lunge if you think you can get them. As for perks, I haven't gotten any good ones. I tried Nemesis and Rancor, but that didn't work out. Dying Light and Ruin are still good, universally.  My usual build of BBQ, Pop, Brutal, and Ruin will probably work just fine. 
---
I want to try an anti-heal loadout, and a Nemesis, Rancor, Enduring and Spirit Fury combo when reset comes.
---
I think wiggling might be broken because of Breakout.Wiggling appears back when another survivor comes nearby the killer.
---
Thanks a lot. When i have finally enough shards i will get her, soooo about 100 hours..... But thanks again :D
---
The fact that they were shown was actually considered a bug by the developers, so they removed it
---
Thats kinda the joke you know...
---
It's a perk aimed more at newer players.  Not every perk is going to be part of top-tier builds/designed for high level play.  Some perks are good for people learning the game/killer role, with the deliberate intent of being phased out of builds as the player gets better.  It's literally the Killer version of 'Windows of Opportunity;' training wheels for players who are still working on their understanding of the maps/tiles.
---
Let's make this the official perk logo! Come on BHVR, do it for the meme and for us!
---
They changed it
---
Do you close the hatch? I think the challenge is ‚Äúbefore the gates are powered‚Äù not before they open.
---
Thats the joke
---
I think I would change legion but having it more like you can switch between the different members and each one has a different ability and the power would be called "We are Legion"
---
Take that back, I worked hard for those!
---
Bud ure getting defensive after I present a fact to you.
---
I know man, theres just a mediocre drawing of a tree and stone, how does this even relate to dbd, downvoted and reported
---
Yep. I actually unsubbed to him because all he does is whine every stream. I find it funny how he always cries about killers being underpowered, yet when he played wraith all day a few days ago the vast majority of the games he played, he 4ked. (He normally 4ks anyway).
---
Also he NEVER understands that sometimes he just plays badly. If he doesn't 4k it's because the survivors are OP, not because they played well. Never. He's also always passive aggressive which I can't stand.
---
You can buy a good adapter that converts mouse and keyboard to controller inputs for ps4...
---
Good one will run $100-200 range. You can google and do some research into what's best for you here is a decent but older article to start.
---
https://on-winning.com/xim4-tac-pro-best-console-mouse-keyboard/
---
Can't forget when you're too close to the generator and kick it you get stuck in the generator this is fixed tho if a survivor touches the generator and you kick iy
---
It was more about broken vs overpowered. Old Legion‚Äôs timer went down out of chase so if he just walked backwards you would die from frenzy. Even if he didn‚Äôt, he had a sprint burst every 10 seconds that he used to chip away at your bar in 2-3 hits to down you with no way to really avoid it because he could swing until his power ended. There was practically no counterplay, given pallets and windows didn‚Äôt slow him down. There was no room for mindgaming, just he sprints up to you and stabs you and repeat with no counterplay. Your only option was to run in a straight line for distance.
---
Somehow he also wasn‚Äôt fun to play and sort of was bad. So you have a killer who takes forever to end chases, or cheeses them, and survivors who have no real counter to said feral frenzy always being up stabbing their bar lower. It was miserable, and if you watch any video from Legion around that time it has 2 DC‚Äôs a game minimum. Literally the second you saw the FF bar on your teammates people would DC because it just was so anti fun.
---
Officially, "early" simply means "before they're supposed to."  I assume they used the phrase "early" as opposed to "end of match" because no one expects you to stick around and spectate after dying.
---
Huntress can injure/down Survivors at a distance. Clown can't. Huntress is stronger than Clown.
---
As a counter argument to that, if you want fun game that doesn't affect other people, go play offline single player game. This is online multiplayer in which your decision makes difference to other people (i.e. makes game shit for 4 other people)
---
Killer add-on OP? Have you never played Haddonfield with BL, insta heals, DS, BT, purple flashlights etc? Swf is also powerful tool when playing with 3rd party comm like discord.

---
*Rant from a solo survivor
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not paying for some 3rd party hardware to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù the system. 
---
The system and game already recognizes mouse and keyboard. The devs just need to unlock it.
---
Servers are fucked too since the patch. I noticed in the first game I played after updating. It really is unplayable as survivor. And I can't imagine it being fun for the killer either
---
Brown medkits, toolboxes, killer add-ons are okish but there is really no need for those.
---
Just make ruin work better and remove those add-ons. I think that the game then will be more fair. 
---
If ruin was not dependent on a totem and if it was dependent on the number of the hooks made by the killer at that point, it would make more sense.
---
For example, if the killer had made 0 hooks, the gen speed will be the lowest. As the killer starts to hook, gen speed starts to increase. This way, it seems very fair for both the survivors and killer. 
---
Making it dependent on a totem is stupid RNG.
---
I didn't know bugs were included in the updateüíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'm finding it easier to just M1 most times, in and out of his power. Demon Dash is for crossing the map like Billy, Demon Slam for breaking pallets like Billy, and it burns the charge bar so I can clean up the Blood Orbs and get Deviousness points. I've gotten a double down with Slam though, which was lucky.
---
Yup and thats the problem with some of the challenges it isn't skill or a grind... its play 100 matches and hope a certain situation arises.
---
Could try looking for someone(s) to help you its easier of you have teammates on comms who can say open door and go get hooked on purpose and your team knows you need the save so no one will steal it. Just used borrowed time.
---
Methinks that they are trying to milk DbD for every penny they can while it's popular. See how the focus is on new cosmetics and balance changes mostly on whatever issue the community is most vocal on (+ whichever killer the balancing team got rolled by last morning - see nerfs to legion and nurse).
---
Deathgarden was promptly axed when it lost traction, DbD will remain popular for a time, but not forever. Instead of remaking the ground from the ground up, which risks alienating their current players, they'll squeeze everything from it and then move on - see the newest battepass rift as a first symptom.
---
I'm not judging or anything, it's how business is conducted, but it's also why the underlying issues and bugs remain unfixed. "People still play, so why bother? Let's feast while the table is full."
---
I've played one match as killer with Oni so far. Got a merciless 4k. So yeah, *personally*, he's alright on console
---
IMO **Hex: Anarchy** should be changed to 'If only one surviver in the game does that action'. So if only one survivor out of 4 sits on a gen, his progress is slowed by any%.
---
They must find a real developer and pay him to fix that......
---
I‚Äôm just constantly getting the hillbilly.
---
Um ok, personal opinion i guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Well Tru3 did think about just renaming himself to just Tru3 so it doesn't get used against him for jokes like "N0ta1ent" and the likes when he loses. Again nothing against a bit of arrogance when it's  not used to insult people which he doesn't, I just hate that he actually goes with the YT trend and sometimes goes a bit too far whem complaining about terrible games.
---
It‚Äôs actually pretty unnerving
---
Whats this medkit one you speak of?
---
Is it why I played a good medkit with 2 extra charge addons and it still went poof way sooner then it should.
---
Trust me you don‚Äôt Today we had this terrifying Oni on PS4 and he literally face camped a new survivor straight at the start of the game then proceeded to face camp everyone and we have two people dc on purpose because he face camped them and then I was the last one left I opened the exit gate only to get downed by him with one hit because his rage. Then he hooked me, you could tell my team was pissed vsing a toxic oni is  worse then a toxic spirit.
---
Ah okay, I don't usually seek out answers about things like this, so I decided to give a try. I also did try searching it up on chrome and got no answers. That's why I went straight to reddit to ask cause I see everyone use it.  Literally first time using it, that's why I didn't really think about searching for it, but yeah I'll keep that link in mind, never really knew where to go for that sort of thing, thanks for the info and link.
---
Yes charge add in‚Äôs currently don‚Äôt work

Yeah. I don't like when RNG interferes with results. It's ok for a causal game but many people including me take this game seriously.
---
Stand far away, wont get stunned. Hold Oni mode.
---
DM me and I'll show you in KYF
---
I wish they added guns into the game so I could shoot the spirit before that morphing bitch gets me
---
IKR! He is really hard!
---
BBQ, Ruin, Nurses &amp; Shadowborn. Or swap Nurses for Infectious Fright if you're confident that you can down someone else nearby quickly. Shadowborn is super handy to keep an eye on where people are heading during fatigue, but if you feel like you don't really need that then you could also swap that out for something else that you prefer, maybe Discordance (one is better than two/three) or sloppy if you're running Nurses. Hope this helps!
---
That's odd, I played nothing but Oni for like 5 hours and only depipped once. Plenty of safety pips, though, cause BHVR hates instadown killers.
---
I also killed it with the Legion though, everyone was calling them trash while I rarely got anything other than a 4k double pip. Maybe I'm just too good /s
---
So that's why the Claudette DCed after I hooked her in the basement that sounds like a nasty bug
---
Did you happen to be playing Nancy on ps4? Lol

Youre not the only one frustrated. Matchmaking, lag, and bugs are my 3 biggest complaints currently. I don't understand why it's not really getting better. 
---
Someone on the ps4 subreddit stated that a game was 'dead' because it had 5 minute wait times for rounds. I laughed thinking I'd be happy if it was only 5 minutes with dbd consistently.
---
Ruin+ pop when learning nurse is bad since it teaches the player that they can do big/multiple mistakes and get away with them. A full tracking build would be better since they want to focus on chases to learn and master her power

Oh, well that shit went right over my head.
---
And i enjoy every second of it
---
He also started to make actual thumbnails. He is probably starting to take YT more seriously so he is working on building them views, he even uploaded an entire stream like 2 days ago
---
How so?
---
so you mean to say waiting 10 extra seconds for a few extra points at the end, instead you want to start a lobby search that takes 5-30minutes.
---
That's completely understandable. I think what the game needs sadly is strong competition, only then will the devs get their stuff together.
---
Congrats!
---
Enjoy the report, people like you don't belong on this sub.
---
He's one of those people that dodges if someone isnt a rank they like, as if rank has any correlation with skill in this game lmao.
---
Ah yes when I played killer I dealt with some mean survivors, just I‚Äôve dealt with mean killers on survivor. But I am never rude even if they are to me, toxicity just spreads more toxicity, so regardless of how they treat me I just wish them
---
Well~ 
---
I dont think Ill ever get to rank 1 xD Im partially deaf and Im not that good so xD have a good day c:
---
I like your idea, it reminds me of what I've suggested a while back.
---
&gt;Give him predetermined nodes to "teleport" to, similar to Freddy or Demogorgon.
---
&gt;As a rough example, he can target lockers to "teleport" to. The effect would be he phases out on his current character, and the killer perspective switches and jumps out of the targeted locker as another member of Legion. You can balance around the range and transiting time as needed, or even let him "mark" a set number of lockers he can do this to if a hard limiter is needed for balance.
---
&gt;This gives off the illusion that you're chased by multiple killers who comes at you from different directions, like the name Legion implies. It'll also be a bit different from the aforementioned Freddy and Demogorgon as this should be geared towards an in-chase ability, as opposed to theirs being a more of a distance/pressure ability.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Thank you ^~^ ill keep an eye out for those totems, us nancy mains must always cleanse
---
His power would be looking at the camera with a half-smile, mumbling something boring in a thick European accent, before putting you to sleep with his gameplay.
---
Otz. The most boring DbD streamer there is.
---
Nancy?
---
I like that there view of a hood end is abote 3 suv dead but to be adebt ve gota get all. Non shal live
---
I feel your pain, I posted a screenplay for TV show based on Dead By Daylight and nobody even flinched to give it a look.
---
I played all day yesterday after patch drops as legion at rank 1, and 4-3k every game, i doing something wrong?
---
Lucky! What platform do you play on?
---
Me throwing a pebble not realising the killer is looking right at me
---
that would have pissed me off so hard.......dead hard
---
You can do it dude!
---
Yeah, you're not telling me what you're doing üò§
---
Ill do my best! Sometimes Im so bad at looping definitely need more practice lol
---
"Nah mate sorry you got Coldwind just give up now"
---
It happened to me too, I hope they fix it soon.
---
Do you die from it?
---
This is a y i k e s for killers
---
Believe it or not. It wasnt always the way it is
---
There are lots of great tutorials on youtube to learn the paths you have to take to loop. Everything after is just practice :)
---
I play on Xbox in purple ranks
---
Tbh they're probably better overall now. The speed boost will equate to a lot more distance which means more pressure and awareness, and will mean faster first hits especially with the vaulting increase. No more frenzying one survivor then running out while chasing the other across the map hopefully. 2 very good perks won't work on them but there's plenty of other options to mitigate that loss. Mend time reduction isn't too bad and mostly to make them less obnoxious to face, plus the faster mending of an ally is secretly more time wasted overall, as it's 2 survivors wasting 8 seconds each instead of one wasting 15 seconds.
---
Legion is best when they slow the game and hold out for an opportunity to use their mobility and map awareness to snowball. Now they'll slow it slightly less but have more effective snowballing.
---
Oh okay, I play PS4 in red ranks.
---
For some reason I'm getting back to back games against plague like everyone seems to be using her on xb1
---
After playing a few more matches, I think frame drop may be a big part of the problem. Sometimes if feels like the survivors are coated in butter and just slide away as the hammer drops. :|
---
Dante might be in it, but is waluigi?
---
I mean when any game releases new content there will always be a bug that comes with it.
---
6 month to 50??!!!
---
Pc anything is better. Have u seen they way they move compared to console.
---
6 months to rank 4 not 50 lul
---
Also talking about glitches, anyone else got that glitch where if you get hooked in the basement you phase through the map and you can't see anything? It happens to me every time I get hooked in the basement, but I think the way to fix it is to tap somebody once on the hook and then hold to unhook them. At least it worked for my friend in a public match.
---
Too much pallet toi close to each other, LOS break everywhere, too much safe point where the killer HAS to take a vault
---
I just got it in purple ranks, it took a few tries though I had to learn how to play the character but now I think I'm much better at the character thanks to practice, don't give up, it's not impossible.
---
Yeah, that's happened to me a few times. Definitely a forehead-slapping moment.
---
Damn 6 months ?
---
he said on stream the other day that the only things that bother him about killers are noed and moris and proceeded to mention that he had a lot more complaints about survivors
---
Yeah that would be cool, id like to see meme killer that can hide in lockers too one day xD, even if just for april fools day
---
Andreline. Spine chill. Lithe. And suprise..... Windows of opportunity, it let me know what pallets are gone and let me plan ahead my escape routes
---
I mean some maps are better for killer and some are better for survivor, that's called balance... Still not a reason to rage quit
---
Why did you unhook her without BT? I think the challenge needs a safe unhook
---
I really like your reply for being very informative and well worded instead of just saying "oh killer main mad, not a nerf, add-ons buffed". 
---
The biggest thing that gets me is mainly the Deep Wounds change, which prevented the bar from going down at all when sprinting or mending. Made it so it's really difficult for mending to be impactful in any way at all.
---
Yeah i am low rank killer and was letting people farm...i could have easily 4k'd them then they opened exit gate and teabagged..they must have thought they outplayed me...so i took it out on the next group and 4k'd them with spirit
---
Oh, yeah- It absolutely is an issue, it's happened to me and my boyfriend multiple times tonight. Here's hoping it gets fixed soon.
---
Basically deep wounds will never down anyone, Survivors are always running and they have no reason to be walking or doing something else when they have to mend their deep wounds.
---
Can u see the perk as killer? Like boil over
---
Is it really rare if everyone gets it tho? Kinda defeats the purpose of rarity ...
---
Since on hot effects doesnt work i changed sloppy with brutal, bbq for points, ruin for pepegas who cant work through, stbfl is stacking really slow now but you can hit for free your obsession now, sometimes its working very well, but i just dont know what perk will be better, running speed in frenzy is amazing, vaulting speed is super amazing, you can easelly catch survivor on loop even if you respect pallet, and after this just eat safe pallets with brutal mindgame everything mindgameble and you will be fine
---
This seems like a legion nerf. If not down while sprinting you loose pressure?
---
BBQ, Ruin, Haunted Grounds, STBFL
---
BBQ for obvious reasons, but it is actually even better on him since you can leave portals inactive and then teleport to unsuspecting survivors across the map on gens.
---
Ruin for obvious reasons, Demo definitely needs some slowdown, and it pairs really well with Haunted Grounds that often gives you a lot more pressure in the early game. Just don't Shred them as only basic attacks count for Exposed.
---
STBFL is the best perk ever on him, you can avoid losing stacks with Shred and it makes him stick to chases much better.
---
This is why I hate spirit.
---
Ill have to check them out~ Im sure it would help me on both sides knowing them, thanks for the tip c:
---
pre patchnotes mentality of Legion with nemesis: "just don't stun him"
---
Its not that hard to throw a pallet early, and usually it'll give you more time or run to another loop or loop around the pallet if the killer doesn't break it.
---
Wait....you can check what other people browse? If so how?
---
Well, thats what happen when consoles try to have PC games...
---
It actually just now happened to me. I had a purple medkit too, nice. Think I'm just gonna take a break from DBD till they fix it.
---
Me neither but I think this is the joke:
---
Image 1 (powerful attack): a survivor 360s because killers often lunge.
---
Image 2 (powerful counter): OP is saying, "Just get close enough to the survivor and press attack as opposed to lunging."
---
If that's the joke, then it's pretty shit considering there's a natural progression from attack to 360. Killers lunge to close the distance, eg, so the survivor doesn't get to a pallet. In response to this, the survivor 360s.
---
If you wait until you're a foot behind the survivor, you'll get pallet stunned a lot.
---
*This comment was brought to you by: Taking /r/DbD Very Literally at 8am.*
---
It's getting a bit easier. I think I was expecting Billy-level chases but that may have been the wrong approach.
---
Understandably so. No one could blame you tbh.
---
Yeah, I'm hovering between Purple and Red ranks - so that doesn't make learning a new killer any easier. :P
---
I thought it was just my imagination! :D
---
You still run STBFL now? Maybe I'll try that build with Enduring or something, thanks üòä
---
Yeah first game and had three blendettes lmao
---
Lithe probaly
---
Yeah that's a shame. I'm a legion main myself most of the time, and as much as I wish it weren't true, deep wounds really is nothing more than a time tax. I have far more luck getting pig traps to pop than getting deep wounds to have any amount of impact beyond a 15 second delay.
---
yes that‚Äôs completely true, but why put more in the game knowing your just piling bugs on bugs?
---
Yeah I get you now, il check it out
---
It would be cool to see them do this, but the truth is that they can‚Äôt. Perks are unlocked on all characters. They wouldn‚Äôt remove an entire perk and replace it with a new one. The new perk could be added to the base kit like you suggested though!
---
What are the DC penalities now?
---
Cheers, already quite high but may just have to increase it every time I get that map and lower it afterwards :D
---
I prefer M1 killers so being able to crouch and lose my terror radius and red light at any point helps end chases faster. Also I like his animation of wiping off the blood from his knife.
---
I saw that. Alot more polished idea than this one, but i'd take any rework atm.
---
If that's supposed to mean salty dragon I love you
---
I would also but pop goes the weasel because it makes 3 gens strat invicicble
---
Added, love the gamer tag btw
---
Unfortunately there are basement hook challenges in the archives, so that ain't happening.
---
Slaughter house
---
Sloppy butcher is legions best friend step as many people you can in frenzy mode. they prob wont even heal anymore because meanding and healing with sloppy butcher tooks way to much time.
---
This basement bug wasn't even in the ptb, it's new. Same with the wiggle bug
---
More boring than tru3 who has his own fanbase jerk him off?
---
thats rough buddy
---
Yeah, faster reload is the go to imo. That and exhaust/hindered gas. But yeah clowns cheeks.
---
there plenty fun ideas on the forums, even megathreads based on just that
---
Thx
---
&gt;Missing a feral frenzy attack will diagnose the player with cancer and crash the computer
---
&gt;fixed an issue that allowed the legion to successfully land a fera frenzy m1
---
Hold up. I've been playing him since release non stop with different builds and oh man is he just an unfun bundle of shit.
---
I would rather play double nerfed Legion. I'm gonna keep trying but this is making me want to never want to buy another DLC again.
---
I'm on PC and you get them if you add the game to library, you don't even need to download it
---
^ this, but unfortunately, Sloppy Butcher doesn't work on the Legion as per the new patch. BBQ would be nice, and Discordance can be replaced by something like Pop or Enduring/Brutal
---
Note on Discordance, it is better at rank 1, so try not to tier it up. I believe the reasoning behind that is you don't want the generator to be highlighted for so long, that way it can "refresh" faster if they end up leaving it and coming back.
---
Did they not change his charged up attack to not being an "on hit" effect so stuff like Franklin's Demise and Sloppy Butcher don't work unless you M1 them ?
---
So you're just ignoring the huge amount of incest hentai that the japanese made?
---
What song is this? I think I‚Äôve heard it before.
---
Yep and it happens, no not all the time but it does happen and it‚Äôs not a new discovery.
---
üòÇ
---
ah, forgot about the deep wound rework, thanks for mentioning that.
---
i hadn‚Äôt heard about keeping discordance at lvl 1, thanks for the tip! definitely something to keep in mind if i ever prestigeüòÜ
---
Thanks for ruining the racist joke. Jeez. All them Asians look the same same lol. Amirite?
---
Fixed an issue where survivors have to mend.
---
Fixed an issue where feral frenzy put survivors into the injured state
---
like i said, nerfed into the ground
---
Essentially the screen goes completely blank and you can't do anything. I think there's quite a few pictures/videos of it happening if you look around.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be a condescending asshat about it.  
---
Yeah, you eventually will get stunned. If they don‚Äôt stun you, you can just run through pallets and if there‚Äôs not enough distance between the survivor and legion they can‚Äôt drop it early.
---
&gt;You still retain the thing that has sentimental value
---
But I don't if it's given away to everyone and their mother.
---
Yeah, a shame really. I'd say use Pop Goes the Weasel instead of Sloppy, that perk is just too good.
---
Yeah, I was thinking he's pretty scary when he's barelling at you at full speed roaring.
---
pop is so fuckin good, hurts to put so many bps into clown though. i kept hoping it would come back to the shrine after the last time i missed it :(((
---
Alright thanks.
---
But it shouldn't be acceptable either. If car manufacturers suddenly started building cars where the breaks don't work in half of them, you wouldn't suddenly go "oh well, it happens all the time now, so it's totally cool".
---
Yeah no problem üòÑ
---
it'd be a lot easier to just make iron maiden standard, we haven't had a new base perk since thrill of the hunt
---
The killers or survivors aren‚Äôt there to make you play fairly. Adapt accordingly.
---
Gatekeeper is the big determining factor most times.
---
Gens only give points up to 9 mins, then an amount for how many left. If you don't protect the first 3 gens fucking hard for a few minutes to start, it's impossible to get merciless above rank 13.
---
I think the map is kinda broken, the gens are so close together
---
not all the time depends on your motive for leaving that map 
---
leaving because you played it a lot and your bored of it or you don‚Äôt feel like playing a map it‚Äôs not really out of any anger
---
If you managed to visible scare a Survivor (weird, abrupt shaking whilst running) you already won the match as Wraith, change my mind
---
The level 20 friends that swf groups bring along. These guys are so adorable.
---
True just feels like a bitch move in my opinion though just like if a survivor dc just because they see a killer they don‚Äôt like
---
Naw, Feng's still is- and always will be- my numbah wun
---
What's the basement bug?
---
I honestly think that that person is just stupid
---
What about a hex perk add on?
---
I just want to get my three daily rituals done for Legion trapper and Wraith please
---
He has to chuckle and hehe because he has nothing else to say. The guy is full of hot air. One of the least entertaining streamers on Twitch.
---
Lol that's so funny and sweet
---
How can they be deliberately exploiting the bugs? Does it not happen randomly or are the killers making it happen
---
I actually tried this before the patch notes and while I was on the hook I red them and realised "Wait there is a COOLDOWN for protection hits?!?"
---
I agree, add back the on-hit at the very least. I honestly don't mind the Legion not being able to cheese with Nemesis/BoP, but let me proc that Sloppy Butcher :(
---
I just want a new non-teachable perk
---
I wold argue that his basekit is not fine at all. Legion's power, while it very arguably makes survivor waste time, is an hindrance to them during the chase: they are a powerless killer during any chase; granted, a killer that only needs to get one hit off, but still a powerless killer nonetheless. And powerless killers, to any survivor with decent knowledge of the game, can be very easily looped to hell and back... Just because they don't have anything in their kit that helps them close the distance. Sure, you could attempt to use Feral Frenzy in a chase but my god, that 4 seconds stun is unbelievably bad. That alone more often than not puts you in a worse position than you were before you used your power. And even then, even if you chain your hits with it, now you can just ignore legion, run to the nearest generator, mend faster than before, and then work on the generator, no troubles there! Even if legion hits you with Feral Frenzy, just mend to their faces... What are they gonna do, stand there 8 years counting their fingers before deciding that stabbing people is a good idea? By the time the stun ends, you can easily reach a window / a pallet / a loop / put distance between you and them. I agree they are strong at low ranks but that is just a silly idea to think that their kit is fine, when it's flawed by the simple idea of "it actually hinders you more than it helps you"
---
&gt;That happened to my girlfriend on preschool earlier. 
---
That read so wrong, I had to laugh out loud.
---
Who‚Äôs Joe? There‚Äôs no Joe in dead by daylight silly XD
---
The basement hook bug... Some killers are intentionally doing that to fuck with people.
---
&gt;it's the one thing that stops Wraith from being as viable as Ghostface 
---
I think Wraith can't be viable as GF in his current state. Wraith is too much addon dependant, while you can play GF without addons.
---
Do you want them to add bots so they fill the missing survivors ?
---
Hes Leatherface tier. I hope you get to play against him soon.
---
There are some loops, such as the shack, where you run close to the lockers a lot. I can see it being an effective counter for shack. In other cases, maybe just like Freddy's teleport to come from an unexpected direction, or Hag's teleport to quickly catch a Survivor sometimes.
---
Dont reason with the meme 
---
Just accept it
---
Ah I see that‚Äôs pretty shitty I thought it did not happen all the time
---
Otz could tell me he hated my guts and wished I was dead, but if he says it in the way he says everything else I‚Äôm still gonna wanna give him a big hug afterwards
---
The one where you get hooked in the basement and you can see nothing but sky is a well-known bug right now and killers are purposely building to get survivors in the basement so they can get an easy Adept achievement on oni. Or just be toxic.
---
Just win 4Head
---
Nah, on a more serious note: 
---
I would play Killer. Oneshots hurt your emblems so I would recommend a Killer like Legion, since you get a ‚ÄûChase won‚Äú everytime you put someone in Frenzy.
---
Good Luck!
---
I didn't realize that was a way to thank someone. Well now I know, sorry! New player here, still learning the ropes.
---
Something is causing the glitch to happen, once you know what causes it you can manipulate it in your favour.
---
Legion is the new freddy....
---
Yui best waifu ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Where we dropping boys
---
Hopefully they fix the shit fast
---
If you think anything I said to you was insulting then you are a very soft person. Yikes. I'll find you a link O' Fragile one
---
I love how you drew Wraith :)
---
Still not seeing any proof, just some guy insulting me
---
the real question is: What didn't this patch break?
---
Its a common issue at the moment, happened to me on PC and girlfriend on switch.
---
They should do that u don't bleed when u inside but in the sec u get out all the blood orbs spawn
---
There is a group of friendly people I play with from all over if you wana join. We do have a dark sense of humour and make fun of one another alot all very nsfw if intrested. Add my name from this
---
"A cursed killer" - The Hag's description. 
---
Working as intended?
---
It happened to my friend earlier and the only way it was fixed is when he got picked up again
---
Finally i got DS :D
---
Respect the survivors but never the pallets.
---
Walking seems alright
---
I been playing him since release too. And at purple/red ranks. Hes enjoyable. I did not stutter but if you think he isnt, your loss. You should still max him out for his perks though.
---
Gotcha
---
I had a really fun last game playing my legion. Unfortunately right off the bat the David DCs. So I felt bad for the lobby and I decided "I'll just get points from them but I won't kill anyone." So I spent the whole game just using my frenzy and letting them heal, stun me, lead them to gens, etc. I ended up with over 40,000 blood points and didn't hook a single person. Every survivor that stayed got at least 20,000 so it was really nice.
---
 I would lead them to gens, totems, pallets. I would down someone and let the other pallet stun me so they could get points too. Everyone escaped, I pipped and got 3 iredesent emblems, Its a win win. I wish I could do it with more survivors tbh.
---
Yea if it was cancelable it would actually be pretty good but since it isn't it's pretty eh but the strike is still good imo
---
It‚Äôs not that nobody could see it, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs not funny
---
And you don't have to act like it's "uncounterable" but you still do.
---
"Eventually" in this game is death for the killer. Extended chases are terrible, every good killer drops a chase if it's going too long because if they don't they instantly get multiple gens done in exchange for downing a single survivor. If you actually watched some PTB gameplay instead of just "omg look legion nemesis OP showcase" from youtubers then you would know that these builds really didn't do well, far worse than this circlejerk thinks. 
---
A good survivor can loop a killer without having to stun him for some time. We have killers that completely ignore loops like Nurse or ones thay can 1shot you anytime they want, but trying to loop without stunning? "uNCoUnTErAbLe"
---
Sounds like a great idea, although what would happen if the killer is running other hex perks? Slow cooked becomes capped at a certain amount?
---
Remove the patrol and terror radiuses. 
---
Give them a Ghostface crouch that lingers when switching. 
---
Inactive members of the Legion stand still with their arms crossed. They have a slightly wider collision box then the average killer. This gives them blocking potential. 
---
Survivors can channel an interaction for two to three seconds to shove a Legion member and stun them. This is only to eliminate any game hostage situations.
---
I kinda think that what the comment meant (definitly not sure though)
---
I think is was meant as: "The perk gives a really strong advantage, IF all the stars align right." So basically an example that Onis perks are, just like the survivors perks (sorry forgot the name :/) can be really strong but are really situational.
---
WTF are you even talking about? The guy plays both survivor AND killer, and he's never suggested "Surivors (shoule be) nerfed into the ground". Stop using lies to justify your dislike of him please.
---
You realize your wait time is longer as killer because more people are playing as killer than survivor, right?
---
That's the next Pig nerf, though.
---
Well yes but no, I think the game is pretty balanced right now and the only thing the devs should fix is the ranking system.
---
Dead hard
---
You throwing down every pallet without looping hurts my feelings tho :(.
---
I promise I was talking about the map officer
---
Stick with one set up and change up my add-ons for the fun
---
Except most still won't.
---
Depends on mood, I'll usually run Corrupt Intervention, Ruin, Sloppy and Thanatophobia so I can fuck around without the match ending in 4 minutes
---
this is kind of you, explain yourself, but you don't need to do it. I would answer that with a meme. 
---
Imagine demand realism in a comic strip.
---
btw It's a very good job, and your name fits with your work, cute AF...
---
&gt;how the hell did they think that was ok lmao
---
Reminder that legion came out long after nurse. Can't wait for the next such killer.
---
I always run self care, spine chill and dark sense but I do switch up the fourth slot, I go between dead hard, empathy etc depending on how I want to play
---
As a rank 8-5 killer I get 4 rank 2-4 or 4 rank 9-11
---
Directly the first perk I hate it bc I don't need to deal with another perk that is going to ruin my day as a trapper
---
This happened to me yesterday, with the Nightmare, I was lucky I could teleport to another gen and kick it, got bugged out. As for you...thats sad. Are devs just sitting there thinking about what bugs would be the most unfun and simply add them with an update? First basement, now this. How can such a bug even occure
---
good idea, every killer could spawn in  their bloodwebs sunglasses stolen from steve as an addon.
---
For killer I usually run whispers and ruin but I‚Äôm really new to killer so I haven‚Äôt figured out ‚Äòmy‚Äô build yet
---
With Dying Light, yep.
---
I'll respect pallets that are complete trash sometimes so I can mind game at them. Anything vaguely safe, I'll plough right through 95% of the time. 
---
Determining a safe pallet is just about distance OP; if it has long walls to either side, you can react to the killer trying to mind game &amp; slide over. If it has short walls and the killer can take like 2 steps and then lunge to one side, that's unsafe and you can get baited.
---
Well good thing I'm a killer main and no bug so far has ruined my day.
---
On a serious note it's the first day or days after a update it is going to be bugged for some time
---
This also leaks the new 2 VS 8 Game-mode as well. (as you can tell ash is the 8th survivor &amp; has just finished the gen behind Joey &amp; Susie)
---
for now
---
It does feel good hehe
---
He‚Äôs not stupid at all. He‚Äôs right. The point he‚Äôs trying to get across is that It happens all the time with DbD. Every single update has a ton of bugs, some of them game breaking. And yet they‚Äôre so slow to fix them that it‚Äôs just bugs on top of bugs.
---
Sloppy Butcher doesn‚Äôt work with Feral Frenzy anymore, they nerfed it
---
It's like "oh cool flashlight but u know what is cooler that's right I GOT SOME SICK SHADES
---
To be fair it still ticks down when they do gens or heal. Imo the Deep Wound timer should be shorter now so you have to focus on mending first before you heal or do a gen.
---
U win
---
Fixed issue that cause legion ~to m1~
---
Ok, so. Heres the thing. I've been getting 4k's. That's fine. First few were rough but even after the 4k's this dude still just feels bad. Like, the controls just are on life support right now on console.
---
I already have him at 45. Checking out different builds. The power isn't very good. You can play him as an M1 killer or R2 Killer I guess but having his power just feel terrible is the problem. One that probably wont get fix. If you like how it feels. Cool.
---
I dont like how it feels.
---
Did you earn it and lost it? Cause by this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5ivpk/release_information_340/f9jx57s/ It looks like the devs decided to not give those away
---
I just played a couple of games of survivor and the vaults seem really really broken again.
---
I like this man's idea go into the water without knowing how to swim
---
I thought nurse was the worse killer on console bc she is almost impossible to play
---
Gotta learn somehow
---
I have always wondered what the devs were thinking about this.
---
I do think it is crazy that it doesn't matter what you did so long as you escape as a survivor.  You can literally go from locker to locker do absolutely nothing to contribute and so long as the doors get opened, you get the achievement.   
---
 Meanwhile, you could have four survivors run straight to the basement and have a leatherface instant down and hook all four and you will never get the achievement.  I get why the killer achievement isn't earned in this case; I just don't get why the survivor one is.
---
Haha, yeah. This explains why my teammates were in the basement the whole game while I was trying to do gens. I thought they were dicking around with the killer or were just bad.
---
Old Legion was get stacks fast, but lose them normally/fast. New Legion is like Demo, get stacks slow but you only have hit your obsession 1 time to down them because you can injure them with FF.
---
Just take a look at the rift. The game is supposed to be played on both sides, killer and survivor. My killer queue time is upwards of 15 minutes, for survivor it's 1 minute. I can't imagine there are 1/4*15=3.75 times more killer players tbh. I do know that it's not that easily comparable, but there has to be something done about half of the game not being accessible to some
---
2 meh killer perks and 2 oh dear lord survivor perks wow I like it
---
Yeah! A player shouldn't have to make the sacrifice of all of their blood points earned in order for a game to end
---
Please tell me you're kidding. This is actually unplayable
---
I love the chase music when ur playing legion and using frenzy
---
Pretty sure they said charms will not be in the store. Also you prob save more money just doing the rift as 10 bucks for the pass vs 10 bucks for one outfit
---
T-bag me once shame on me T-bag me twice shame on you, facecamping untill he's dead people will try to save him and you get more downs or they ignore him and do gens and you pissed of that guy that try to piss you off. Either way it's a win and i'm a survivor main aswell.
---
Damn that sucks it's my favorite hammer
---
The servers have been out for barely a month on the live servers you expect perfection so fast. What I think people should expect is this being how it is going to be there will hardly ever be a game where everyone has 0 latency and top tier network.
---
The first perk doesn't apply to the trapper, it applies to killers like Freddie and Hag because their traps aren't that visable compared to the trappers traps.
---
Besides, as you have stated, there is already a perk that goes against the trapper
---
Nurse doesn't really need perks unless u really wanna go sweaty
---
That is the cutest thing I've imagined all day.
---
i didn‚Äôt know console had servers
---
Unfortunately, no they are not kidding. Official BHVR response gives an eta on the fix at a week or two. Sure would be nice if they could take some of the money from selling cosmetics and hire a couple QA testers to catch shit like this.
---
Wouldn't make much sense for a perk to have the idea to finding traps but yet can't find bear traps
---
LoL game is built in a way that lets killers exploit everything possible they can. They will never be banned.
---
I still can't believe this. The game is literally unplayable for survivors this way. These type of bugs shouldn't be in any game for more then 24 hours ffs
---
Fair point, as I said, this perk I didn't think too much about.
---
Just was siting on the bus thinking about it
---
Listen point is the servers are now I'm not defending BHVR here I'm just trying to have logic behind this the game has more than ever been consistent with the addition to dedicated servers. 
---
I'm happy with consistency it is something many games can't achieve that.
---
I agree, but it's honestly in line with what the playerbase should expect from BHVR.
---
Yes, this. Same with Meg
---
When I got unhooked I fell through the world and instantly went into the dying state.
---
I can only imagine.  I also imagine half of that time was just waiting to get a damn game.
---
Looks like it. The glitch is still easy to do in KYF, and hopefully won't ever be patched since it isn't ranked.
---
Probably next mid chapter PTB in 6 weeks
---
Why is this getting downvoted?
---
This happened to me on Xbox One
---
Anytime I do I don't get iredescent emblems and I get so many salt messages I get a headache
---
I don't do either. I actually learn from my mistakes instead of blaming frames.
---
sure https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
---
More like he's being downvoted for being needlessly insulting instead of just saying "I personally dislike Otz's content", or better yet not saying anything and moving on.
---
You can fix the suvivor's camera that is hanging by starting the unhook and stopping and then actually unhooking them. Did it a couple times with friends and it works.
---
I haven't tried him yet, but it looks like people also use the movement keys when charging (something billy can't do)
---
So the skill gap for doctor is now how efficiently you can time your blasts, not how you can aim your blasts at them. Interesting.
---
Exactly that. Aslong as we laught it off, they won't put extra work into changing it.
---
"lemme just pull down this pallet real quick"
---
Yes let him bloodlust me to death so fun
---
Idk, a objective to do other than fix gens, elements that make red ranks more enjoyable to play in for both sides.
---
A new killer is just another killer, there is nothing really new that is added to the game.
---
Not at all. I play Console Nurse in Purple ranks just fine. 
---
The problem is that his power wasn't made for console.
---
Coding games isn‚Äôt easy one code could screw everything. This happens all the time with new dlcs on mostly any game on day 1. This isn‚Äôt new, it even has happened to borderlands 3.
---
You don't need to waste time switching modes to block survivor vaulting wich means doctor will be much stronger in chase
---
It's game breaking considering basement hooks happen in most games. Should be fixed immediately, yet it'll be awhile according to twitter which is just unacceptable for the size of this bug.
---
welp looks like bubba might get cosmetics
---
As long as the survivor isn't looping me around the basement, like I'm not going to ignore the fact that a survivor is using all the strongest pallets around the basement because "the basement is bugged and I won't be hooked there or I'll report the killer"; that isn't fair either.
---
Survivors will also have to avoid sabotaging too many hooks, if they don't want to be taken into the basement then there need to be plenty of other alternative hooks left nearby.
---
If the survivors are bodyblocking the killer from reaching a further hook, when they could have just used the basement without getting bodyblocked, allowing the survivor on their shoulder to wiggle out, then that is also abusing the bug.
---
Basically survivors have to let the killer hook their catch somewhere else, if they want the killer to play fair.
---
Sounds like a very interesting rework. I can think of 3 problems though:
---
1) You can set up the NPCs on the last three generators and that way the survivors won't be able to finish the game
---
2) You could set them up to body block all entrances to the shack if basement is there, making unhooks impossible
---
3) Using the "patrol zone" you could put one member at each gate and make it impossible in a 1v1 for a survivor to sneak open a gate
---
You can also apply it with a medkit now.
---
His early game is definitely worse than Billy, but when he does get his power he is a drift king Billy with insta-saw combined.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
I hate that they removed it.... hell, I even hate when you can‚Äôt see survivor rank as killer too. It seems unfair to not be able to see if the people you‚Äôre playing with are at a similar skill level or not.
---
Thats weird, on Xbox Survivor Que takes about 2-5 minutes and Killer Que is instant lobby.
---
Because you just lied and have no proof
---
Here let me do one 
---
"Bhvr staff have said DS is too strong and will have a fix in two weeks. They will be limiting it to once per round"
---
Sorry but theres other dev team members and I can't be bothered to find the exact quote but It's in the forums somewhere, trust me. This patch will be live before christmas, I read it. It's true.
---
*dies of gg ez baby killer*

I-in the same style O-O??
---
No... Steve is throwin' his hands up and feelin' that beat
---
Go get it boy!
---
Good to know!
---
This concept idea has existed since 2016, and many people associate it with the Thing Killer. But the devs have already said flat out they will never make a Killer that will be able to transform into Survivors
---
Get missed without sprint burst or 360ing in the open when the killer is right behind me.
---
Get missed again.
---
Dodge Oni's one-shot 3 times in a row and waste his entire power while running around.
---
Get instantly downed when Hillbilly hit the wall.
---
Reveal Ghostface, get exposed 2 seconds later.
---
Hear Nurse hit the window, get yanked back into her while she's in her stun 2 seconds later, actually got grabbed off while vaulting.
---
Trigger Freddy traps, while awake.
---
Dodge a hatchet, it passed through my character's chest, without Dead Hard.
---
Dedicated servers, yay.
---
It's a good perk, but it's very situational.  If you use it to raise a god pallet or jungle gym, great.  However, do not waste your time raising any pallet that can be mind gamed.  And obviously don't do it right in front of the killer.
---
It is more about general experience and skill. Survivors play much better on all ranks in general today, than used to in 2016
---
One good Doctor perk?
---
What is Unnerving Presence even good for? Terror Radius builds.
---
Who hates Terror Radius builds? Most M1 killers really, good luck catching someone when they have 50 to 60 meters of warning you're coming.
---
Does it even matter if you don't have Ruin to penalize not hitting Greats? Not really, Doctor benefits from it because his power is based on TR and it frazzles skillchecks already, but...
---
Unnerving is generally pretty worthless outside of certain highly specific 4-perk builds on specific killers and even then once Ruin or Lullaby are broken...
---
This entire Shrine is a yikes.
---
Survivors can exploit this to know if stealth killer nearby or not
---
Small team with a nice budget I think. They could hire some people.
---
Too complicated imo + devs said it is barely possible to implement.
---
I wish demo just could move freely in his current upside down and could leave this dimension anywhere he wants where it is possible to place a portal.
---
I don't think that can be seen as an excuse for it though. Just because we all are used it it, doesn't mean we should accept it.
---
Ofcourse bugs happen in all game. But when I hear that BHVR says it will probably take them 2 weeks to fix the gamebreaking basement bug, I really lose hope for this game. I'm not gonna be able to properly play survivor, and do the survivor challenges for the rift I've paid for, for the coming weeks.
---
They definitely have to be thrown down so much earlier with dedicated servers now. You get hit through them 90% of the time when you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to make the lap before. I always get greedy with my pallets as survivor but I need to stop. I never respect as killer.
---
How can Legion's mask blink..?
---
Nvm, awesome cartoon!!! xD
---
I play on xbox
---
If there's no longer a deep wounds effect, why would you hit a survivor twice anyway?
---
cant we just admit legion was a failed attempt at ghostyboi, delete legion and just forgot it ever happened since GF is a better and more fun killer to vs in every single way
---
I couldn‚Äôt watch the second half after seeing you wait at every pallet and waste them. It hurt my soul.
---
Tru3 spent a whole stream proving wraith was viable
---
unnerving on doctor is good as you generally want a giant terror radius to get people in madness faster
---
while yes not the best perk i alway's wanted to run a giant terror radius doctor build!
---
Me today but luckily no one got bugged I‚Äôm not sure why sometimes it does and sometime it doesn‚Äôt... all my survivor games anyone who got hooked got bugged but my killer games everyone was fine
---
oh hell no.
---
i know EXACTLY why people hate me.
---
*Deep wound is no longer tied to being wounded*
---
*Deep wound will no longer injure the survivor*
---
*The timer for deep wound no longer goes down when the survivor is sprinting, walking, crouching, standing still, mending, healing, or repairing generators*
---
*Survivors in the deep wound state cannot be injured or chased*
---
I agree with you, oni is so fucking loud when you have headphones on at full volume lol.
---
Rotten fields has 10 pallets total. That‚Äôs not enough for a five gen run.
---
We kinda did it for 4 rounds.
---
Vs ghostface / shelter woods
---
Vs Michael / chapel
---
Vs prayer beads Spirit / bloodlodge
---
Vs trapper / the game
---
Ghostface got an hook first 30 secs cause we had 1 guy AFK, tunneled down again that survivor and that's all he did.
---
Spirit actually got 2 grabs out of a gen and made a total of 3 hooks before the game ends.
---
Trapper got 2 hooks as well.
---
Reverse Uno Card
---
Agreed it should be shorter. Any survivors who understand how Deep Wounds work wouldn't sit around and do gens when they are afflicted though.
---
Pretty sure it's related to the basement hooks, it fixes when you get saved and then downed again but that means a fair chunk of your match is being taken by the glitch.
---
It‚Äôs not an infinite. There are no infinite‚Äôs in the game anymore. Just because you have to chase someone through the window more than once doesn‚Äôt make it an infinite.
---
How much did your set up cost and how much do you spend monthly on "steam sales"
---
Pretty hard to resist the urge to DC after it happens.
---
Just fucking remove deep wound at this point it's clearly just injured state with a fancy glowing bar and some fun effects added to it now
---
Totally serious lol. Especially if you got the whole legion gang in the works. A group shot of them in your style would be awesome on a card Keep drawing :D your work is smile inducing.
---
That's the issue, isn't it? I rather them revert the minor buffs to the vault speed and instead make Deep Wounds into something more than just "a small time waste"
---
If you can sum up a killer's ability with it just being essentially a minor inconvenience, something's not right.
---
The payment part yes there are no excuses for stuff like this affecting it.
---
However I think we both know this community very well and asking the community to care about the same thing is impossible some hate BHVR some hate the game some don't give a shit others barely play *and some just act like dicks for no reason*.
---
But I personally expected bugs like this to happen not exactly the ones we got but something and wouldn't the easiest fix for them to be after fixing the bugs just to extend the rift and battle pass by a couple of days of weeks maybe. 
---
I'm not defending BHVR they have done a lot of dumb choices when it comes to DBD but I see they are making progress and that makes me happy and I don't feel that I need to accept anything from BHVR bc I barely do.
---
I don't accept Nemesis still having Oblivious, I don't accept them not fixing trapper bc latency fucks him, I don't accept most of this game but what I do accept is dedicated servers having latency and that's probably what it is going to remain like.
---
I probably went of trail here but point is if I was BHVR I wouldn't feel sorry for the community at all from how they can act
---
For me Yui's backstory was what turned me off but I have absolutely no idea why exactly :/
---
Wait that's true, I don't know why I never realised that possibility

---
Doc may be unused but only because he is weak in comparison to other killers. Every killer has a 60% or more kill rate, so at this point, no one needs a buff.
---
i wish there was a way to go back and see like past stats in matches - how many downs, gens done etc
---
bc im pretty sure (working second shift fucks with me at times) that one of the hooks im talkin about was in the basement.   
---
you're prolly right. id rather you not be lol no offense. i like the idea of my screen not going completely fubar
---
Killers have a 60% kill rate at all ranks for even the lowest tier killer right now. Nothing needs to be increased, everyone is performing perfectly fine.
---
There already is something similar to the first perk, Small Game, though it's more an audio cue instead of aura reveal.
---
The second perk seems really interesting, getting an item in exchange of lowered mobility. 
---
The third perk I really like. Don't think you need to include the blindness, but imaging a full team running this trying to rugby tackle Daddy Meyers lol.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to go against trapper on this map ü§ï
---
Vigil
---
Kpop isnt helping your argument
---
I hate playing trapper on any estate map too big to trap reliably
---
I wish Feng outfits were more universal. With other characters I can mix and match a lot of cosmetics, but with Feng not so much.
---
Litteraly lol
---
Of course i do nex :D
---
Didn't they patch that bug with the cloth flying around?
---
Yeah I've played as killer on it and it is really dark. I like the dark atmosphere but it's to the point some spots are really hard to see.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, I always walk in to THE most obvious traps so if you went against me you‚Äôd be fine üòÇ
---
post it!
---
I was able to get out of the glitch by getting picked up by the killer again after I was unhooked the only problem is you‚Äôre gonna go right back on that hook unless DS is up.
---
They are actually doing the basement tome thing. A few are probably trolling but most want free points
---
Yeah definitely. I just played killer on there and I had to stop mid match and shut all my curtains because I legit just couldn‚Äôt see.
---
I hope it doesn't end up with a nerf for him.
---
He's one of those mid-tier hell killers and need to get out of it just as much as the other killers.
---
Yeah they changed it. This versions a lot more intense.
---
But u see bc I'm getting good at trapper I'm now at rank 5 and I hate it bc people at these ranks understand how to win against trapper most of the time
---
I usually get a 3k. I never aim for the 4k with Billy as I don't really care for the instadown. It's too quick sometimes.
---
So instead I'll play Nurse.
---
Perfection.
---
Yeah, I played trapper a few times and it‚Äôs (for me personally) one of the harder killers. I like the add on where a surv is injured when they destroy one of your traps.

Feels bad man :((
---
Your only hope is to get downed then picked up again which fixes the bug. But then you need DS or you‚Äôll just be put back on the hook
---
I think we are glad he wanted it. Bless you sir!
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
They don‚Äôt care about console
---
He is easy but bc he has so many things connected to him that makes him hard.
---
Like knowing where to trap, knowing when to trap, knowing mind games, knowing where survivors usually move, knowing how to deal with some situation and more bc most killers don't have to deal with all of this.
---
Something that trapper really needs is to have some set up time meaning u usually have to give up a gen before ur ready *and that's if RNG was nice and survivors run the loops*
---
Playing on PS4 Pro, the framerate is perfectly fine.
---
The devs have been optimising every single patch, often by updating the version of Unreal that the game uses.
---
I never said anybody who cares about that should stop complaining
---
Do u want blood rushing game play or sneaky gameplay?
---
I'm on console and it only lets me purchase one bloodweb item at a time, then freezes? Is this a bug or is it just me?
---
You played ONE match.

Ghostface and clown, ghostface is fucking great and fun and has great perks other than furative chase, but that can help play with your food if you use that on someone. Clown has pop which is great for gen destruction, bamboozle is good for some characters and the other perk may be good on a doctor with distressing or a small map.

I play on the normal ps4, and it runs horribly. They clearly stated that their aim was to reach 60 fps on ALL versions of Ps4 and Xbox.
---
You're missing the point. The problem isn't that one side is overpowered, it's that a few killers are no fun to play against.
---
He kinda reminds me of Fiona from Shrek in that picture
---
All four of those perks are not only super situational, but we‚Äôre just updated for consistency. Undetectable really only benefits stealth killers when they‚Äôre traveling around. The functionality of those perks haven‚Äôt changed at all.

- Fixed all issues that made legion viable
---
- Legion can now work on generators and drop pallets for negative points
---
I dont mind either, i just want to feel like the reason im winning is because i did that! I had the skill to place that trap there or i was able to make a great mindgame while cloaked
---
But I do believe that trying to accept what we have right now will just make them lazier and lazier, since they will see the feedback and think that everything is fine.
---
It‚Äôs a learning tool like with Windows of Opportunity.
---
At this point I really, really, REALLY, hope most killers know about the glitch and only basement hook for the challenges due to how broken it is.
---
I agree with some points. But not all of them. I dont think you actually understand the strength legion brings in this meta. People. Dont. Heal. Run thanat, ruin, pop, and chili or whatever perk floats your boat. And start stomping. If looping is your problem, run the standard build that m1 killers run. You're thinking of a simple killer as a nurse player. If that makes sense. His power is fast damage in a small amount of time, and map pressure. When he was in his annoying state. He could down people with his power. He was a braindead nurse. Ignored all the survivors counters to killers. It was unfun. Borderline unfair. People dc'd instantly if they saw Frank's mix tape. I'm not saying this should be where legion stays forever. He needs help, but not in the ways everyone thinks. They need to lower the stun. I agree with that. They also need to get rid of the vision cloud during the stun. He isnt a killer you pick for chase potential. Its stall. If you wanted an edgy chase master. Pick ghostface. If you want a killer who doesn't get looped, pick up spirit or nurse. That's it. Legion isnt going to be in this state forever anyways. It's a placeholder while they work on a full fledged rework. But that's my opinion on legion. He's a killer will struggle in bad situations or against good survivor groups. But that's not in any way showing he's bad. If you're struggling with him try looking at what's going on and what your biggest weaknesses are. Then adapt your perk build accordingly.
---
I like this idea more, it would be too random to have 3 NPCs walking around probably getting stuck in walls, hiding them in lockers would be great. But doing this would force BHVR to give us Susie and Joey skins for free, which they should do.
---
Yeah but at least you wont dodge the lobby

Nemesis brought back the old legion exploit, and they changed deep wounds instead of changing legion/nemesis

Testing your own work before you deploy to a production environment isn‚Äôt hard either...

They have made enough money for engineers and should have the skill set to make sure they aren‚Äôt breaking the game on a new release.

He truely is terrifying to play against. I had a similar scared giggle when he first charged at me üòÜ
---
and switch
---
He is like a billy rework, I love playing him cuz with billy I 4 k in 5-8 min get 35k-40k BP with bbq and in the good case get a save pip. With the oni I got 2 pip 5 times and almost always 30k+- no bbq.
---
And he feels fun to play as or against (that what the survivors said in the end game chat) and with billy I got rep 3 times for cheating cus i downed everyone in 3 min and every one is salty in the end game chat.
---
Rank 8-5
---
Well then u can throw clown off the table one good perk he has is PGTW *pop goes the weasel* yes bamboozle is good but it's generic and boring to play against so I don't use it. 
---
Ghostface right now in people's mind is a bit bullshit bc they feel they should be able to break him out of stealth easier. He has a skill ceiling not a high one bc he is basically a pig and Myers as one.
---
Oni is new so I can't really say his skill ceiling but if u like going fast and smacking people hard basically a cooler Billy then Oni is he guy.
---
But if u ask me if u want a skill demanding killer that isn't bullshit then trapper is the coolest
---
Even if you're good with clown experienced survivors will beat your ass. His power is inconsistent and bad. He's also purchasable with shards like oni if you really want to try him. Wouldn't bother spending real money on possibly the worst killer in the game.
---
I think you could, you definitely had the ability for 5 blinks, but it's too long ago, so I'm not sure if 6 was ever a thing.
---
Question: when crouching through tall grass, can the killer see grass moving or?
---
I love legions cosmetics and they keep giving them great ones but them keep making them worse to play. Maybe one day legion will be able to work on gens so we can just help survivors escape, at least then I could do something in the new sweater
---
I never said target audience, I said demographic, and most of them are young teens/young adults, so your point proves nothing.
---
Not on console. 
---
Well. Not that hes not. I still get 4ks but it feels terrible is the point.
---
the hero we needed, the hero we deserved
---
Yup. If you think into it it's a bit of a buff towards STBFL. With the Old Legion, (At 8 stacks) you find your obsession, hit them with FF, lose 2 stacks, and down them normally, minus another 2 stacks. That's 4 whole stacks out of 8, now with the New Legion, you can injure without losing stacks and down obsessions normally for a total loss of just 2 stacks, 6/8 best case scenario.
---
The nerf to Sloppy does hurt though but who knows maybe he'll be in a better spot in a couple of weeks. I gotta admit, I overreacted to the changes. Time will tell!
---
I bet you wathc Ochido
---
Yesterday I've noticed that the game just freezes for 1 second when you get bloodlust, and this wasn't a issue in the last few updates
---
Also with the crossplay thing, they could just do console with console crossplay so Xbox One and PS4 players can play together
---
Pc player and from what i heard juat dont play him
---
OoO is/was one of the most powerful perks in game for SWF because you have one person dedicated to constantly telling you where the killer is at ALL TIMES, including when they are in stealth. If you're the watchdog, you just have to make sure to constantly maneuver away from the killer while informing your teammates where the killer is while loading up escape/defensive perks to be a nuisance all the time. At high level play with SWFs, OoO is a meta perk as well.
---
Weird
---
If I was justed hooked totem&gt;me

If i am on the hook for a long time me&gt;totem

This is true, this is very true

It's sad but true
---
Iron Maiden IMO.
---
Unfortunate
---
I freakin main the 4
---
Imagine all the times I was told to kill myself after a match
---
I expect BHVR to look into the 50 or so reports people have done to me bc of BBQ and Chilly
---
You think he can still kick ass? I played for like 7 hours last night, some as him, some against him, and he really seemed to struggle on live. I actually never died as a survivor against an Oni, (rank 1) and about half of them did still have ruin.
---
I‚Äôd be interested if you had a different experience with him, because my day 1 experience could really be summed up as ‚Äúrather play Billy or Freddy‚Äù
---
Another reason that they agreed was apparently people in the Valve offices loved Peggle
---
I just wish if you played them you could que up with a friend up to 3, and be a standard m1 killer, but with 3 other m1 killers there as well.
---
Everytime I think about firing DbD up again I'm reminded by these sorts of posts how "toxic" this game can be on both sides, and leaves me with little desire to fire it up again as the "fun" ended in a few months of playing this game. Love the concept/lore and everything else but it feels like they just add perks anymore to fix known issues or gameplay problems rather than address and fix said problems. Perhaps one day I'll build up the nerve to go at it again but taking a hiatus from DbD reminded me that I play games to have fun not to be stressed over silly things done by others.
---
I like the idea of secondary objectives but you have to take into account that usually survivors have to be saved as well and sometimes even die. At some point there will be like 2 survivors alive and maybe 4 gens 'done' that have to be defended as well. At some point this becomes an impossible and incredibly stressful tasks which would just be simply unfun. Even though sometimes when I'm playing killer I'm not having fun I need survivors to play the game. There has to be a point in time where a gen is done and can't be touched by anyone anymore. Implementing a system where survivors have to travel the map for mandatory parts is cool because this makes gen repairs more exciting instead of just being in 1 spot for a specific amount of time. This would lead to more chases which would be amazing for the health of the game. In that sense I love this concept, but the part of survivors having to protect gens is something I don't really like.
---
First game on was a fuckin spirit with Stridor :)
---
It happens when another survivor is a certain distance from the killer while you‚Äôre picked up, I bet it‚Äôs to do with Yui‚Äôs perk
---
Yui outfits &gt; Feng outfits but fengs voice &gt; yuis voice
---
First game since the new dlc : oni on the new map
---
Was cool until my first hook was in the basement
---
Couldn't match versus an another Oni or the new map for the evening
---
so is bill
---
My opinion. Dead hard is way more helpful than DS. For DS to work you have to get tunneled or take hits right after being unhooked. Dead hard helps with looping and dodging killers. I would get teachable dead hard
---
Something similar happened to me, i recorded the match and reported to support. Both the killer and survivor arent playing dbd anymore, not sure if because of a ban or they are just tired of the game.
---
Maybe 1. Bc he is new people don't really understand how to play him or 2. Idk why I counted there is only 1.
---
I had a great games with Oni played 3 games got 4ks in every one of them I was in rank 6 but I also did try him on the PTB so I got the hang of his power and I basically use it as a easier Billy chainsaw seems to work.
---
Ofc as this goes on it will show the problems The Oni might have but I doubt it will be many as people get better and better at playing him
---
Its not a nurf they fixed him. I love the change
---
Not need to slug
---
60 of "I'm immortal" yea that's not very helpful is it compared to the 3 seconds DH can give u
---
erm, dead hard will continue to be on the shrine as it is a teachable
---
get ds, dead hard will be available next level bloodweb
---
My bad, BaCk In My DaY when I last played he was considered the worst. Don‚Äôt mind my internet-explorer-delay meme
---
Laughs in PC Master Race
---
I've seen some posts like this where killers even brag about doing it on here. I think it comes from the fact that \*some\* killers become irritated if the 4th person doesn't go to pick up the downed 3rd person. They convince themselves that person is "doing nothing" and feel like it excuses working with the other survivor in order to find them. Of course there ARE situations where one person is doing nothing but a lot of times killers can get it wrong.  
---
I've also been on the receiving end of this as survivor. I was in a duo SWF and the other two survivors were also friends, but little did we know they were friends with the killer. At the very first 30 seconds of the match one of the random survivors was following me about and next thing I know the killer is on me. I get hooked and he ignores the survivor next to me and nods to her to unhook me. I immediately get moried. I told my friend to hide the game out since they were obviously working together, out of sheer principle. What followed was what happened to you - killer downing and trying to see auras etc.
---
Luckily we both recorded it and sent it off. That killer DID end up getting banned shortly after since we checked up on their profile, so it's worth reporting.
---
I mean unfortunately this is like the least toxic thing about Dead by Daylight lol
---
Hey you! You're finally awake.
---
i most definitely agree with you. 
---
it‚Äôs just funny. i been wanting dh. ds too but nowhere near top of priority. so i got ds off shrine just hit 35 and OF COURSE right after i buy DS then hit david‚Äôs second teachable, the bloodweb gives me that. 
---
had i wanted that and not just bought it off the shrine, or whatever, it would have taken at least 10 levels maybe till i see what i want smh
---
Bought a sweatshirt for my best friend! Thank you!
---
*Waaaaaa*
---
Back a year ago when I played, he was the worst. Good so see my man got the comeback he deserved
---
I disagree. STBFL is good for one perk slot, compared to enduring&amp;spirit fury¬¥s two, but it is far too rng dependent to be viable. Especially on legion, who¬¥s power means you go on a stabbing frenzy that gives you a good chance of finding the obsession. When it worked, it worked greats (stab one, go to the next, stab them, stab them again, then down them normally, 4 stacks in no time!) But that is a 50% chance of encountering the obsession, which fucks things over dramatically. The only problem with Spirit fury enduring imo is that survivors can just not stun you; happened the other day where a survivor pre threw every pallet and wasted like 5 pallets in 20 seconds, but there always seemed to be another pallet...
---
His terror music is ass tbh
---
&gt; his skill is useless against good survivors
---
*goggles sadly in Doctor^
---
Playing with skilled players will put you up against skilled killers. Goodluck though
---
If I could give you a hug right now I would, I'm sorry it was a shitty day and that Hillbilly has the mindset of a child lOl
---
The worst part is that knowing about the bugs, some killers go out of their way to do basement builds.
---
Can we have an F in chat for the fallen survivors?
---
Now even more people are gonna have it
---
No wiggle and basement glitch? Uh oh
---
iron maiden would make a good non-teachable
---
I played against him 3 times last night rank 1, he 4kd every time. Solo queue. He is still Billy but can go fast around corners and bend it like Beckham when he smashes. I watched streamers play against him, was pretty much a slaughter fest. As soon as someone is injured he can keep charging up over and over, his reach is also insane. Its kind of early to say for sure, but right now I feel hes a tad over tuned like every killer when they're new.
---
BHVR was tired of the constant Legion+nemesis memes.
---
Most people don't understand that killers don't play the same. They want a powerful power to down survivors fast and easy, not to overthink about the map layout, where are the survivors, where are the gens, ect... As you said, Legion is a stalling killer, he does the most he can to slow down the game and locate other survivors.
---
I haven't tested the changes from last patch, I guess he was a bit underwhelming but I would never return to his old bullshit state where people abused the mix tape and felt proud about it. (But it did was people want, down fast and easy)
---
I'll try him with the new changes, but I don't think it will do anything against the no heal meta as you said :p  Maybe his power should also apply a temporary repair debuff ?
---
It used to work fine i mean i have a 2700xt paired with a 5700xt . Is this game that demanding?
---
'Luckily if I run fast enough these deep stab wounds will not affect me :D' *proceeds to start walking normally* 'ohshitohshitohshitohshit'
---
Yeah however what if the Npc's are put right on gens
---
Yes, stalling is a good thing, but Legion isn't exactly a shining example of killer that is good at stalling. Is power is built for stalling, but they're just unbelievably bad at it. The idea of efficient stall for Legion is the same as any other killer, keeping survivors injured and thus off the gens. Major attention to the 'thus' because with Legion if somebody is injured, they have nothing else to do other than gens. Sure, they get a 16% repair speed penalty (if everyone is injured, which, granted is very easy to do as Legion or Plague) but in the end, if you account for the time you would instead spend healing, it's not like the numbers are in Legion's favor. 16% repair speed penalty adds exactly 12.8 seconds of repair time to gens, against 16 seconds AND the necessity of finding another player / Med Kit
---
 And don't get me started on the potential stall of Deep Wounds, which at this point it might as well be a negative number. The timer is 12 seconds when you are doing it by yourself, which seems good enough, but Legion has to wait 20 seconds for their power, cannot miss it, has to take time to get to you stab you, and choose to either waste more time finding someone else and stabbing them too or chase you. But at that point, after he found someone else and stabbed them, you either are almost done mending or are running to a gen and then mending, which isn't exactly my idea of "good stall". In short, anything Legion does, another killer does better. Legion's stall is on par with the Plague, except the Plague also has good addons and has another use for her power that is almost busted (Apple addons are amazing) and most importantly, can down people super-easy with the broken-smack combo. Legion's map pressure is almost not worth it, waiting 20 seconds to cover SLIGHLTY more ground (remember that you have to eat a 4 second stun when you are done, and do not have a power for 20 more seconds) doesn't exactly seem like a good tradeoff, or a good power for all that matters. Hell, there are killers that can use Than more efficiently than Legion, and even then they are better off with another perk. All of this not even counting the fact that you lose so much time to survivors during chases, that not even all that stall compensates it. Playing Legion feels like playing Pig without her crouch and ambush: The huge problem is that stall means nothing if you have no way of ending a chase, you are just making the game a slog. And by the time 25 minutes have passed and you killed all of the survivors, you could have played 2 4K games on any other killer, maybe even 3 on like, Spirit and Nurse. Legion, in my opinion, isn't enough of a threat and can't capitalize on their stall; they just make games longer, but can't use that fact to win games, or better put, as well as other killers.
---
But it‚Äôs crap that now everyone has on their web.
---
Lol and that is why i use ds
---
He isnt hard he is just bad. He is easily loopable and because of that he applys little map pressure and it is difficult to 1 hit people depending on the map. Survivors can just gen rush him like any other killer and win. His best feature is his ability to slug people
---
i swear DS was in the shrine quite recently too. That's when i picked it up. Now if they could put BT or DH on there you'd pretty much have the build
---
trying to reply to you guys but reddit tellin me "im doin too much"u/Bookiller4518 i bought DS off the shrine. but i been waiting to hit 35 for DH bc david isnt my main currently.am i wrong by assuming that before a perk can be in someone elses web (non shrine) you have to actually purchase it first on whoevers original web its on?thats why i went with DH so i can get it now on claudette.and easy wins? nah, def not lol but idc. i do care that i have to go to sleep soon and be up for work though &gt;.&lt;
---
No guys it‚Äôs just a basement buff
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 7 hours now. I only got two Onis. One brought ebony Mori, and moried 3/4 after first hook. And second was working with last Survivor for 40 minutes. 
---
It‚Äôs mostly been trapper, ghostly, legion, and hillbilly. I haven‚Äôt even seen ONE spirit. All of them are running basement builds with agitation, iron grasp and Mad grit. I‚Äôm pretty sure they know about basement glitch, because literally every single one ends in hooking all survivors there until dead.
---
Rank 2-3 Survivor on ps4
---
Dead Hard I'm guessing? I took that perk in major consideration because it would be too op lol
---
it creeped the shit out of me. D: but i couldn't wiggle before it ...
---
Sometimes it needs to get worse before it can become better.
---
Major flaw in game is that 1 side to have fun/good game the other has to have a shit one, imho.
---
For me, it goes in between that and then the ghost face that just sits nearby waiting to stalk an Insta down the saver
---
Sadly i think the same . Clown needs more love by giving him buffs
---
&gt;How in the fuck did it autocorrect to that
---
Practice!
---
When I typed it out it auto corrected to onion
---
Yeah. I usually play survivors with a good buddy of mine and I tend to take hits for him. I wouldn‚Äôt have to take as many hits then
---
Fire barrels ftw
---
It ALWAYS works
---
Playing few games and not a single survivor DC was a BLAST!! DC ban system should have been implemented long time ago!
---
Oh cool.
---
I just solo queue as Dwight and hope for the best. Lol
---
Nah, looks like it just got out of the 3D-printer
---
They have over 500 employees at BHVR and work on titles like Fallout Shelter and War Hammer 40,000 eternal crusade, it‚Äôs not a small indie company, its one that doesnt fix bugs in DBD and doesn‚Äôt seem to care
---
&gt;The system will also apply if one or more players in a group has an active disconnect penalty, preventing the entire group from joining the matchmaking queue until the penalized members have either cleared their penalty or leave the group.
---
If the group kick the dc'ing member, will they still have to wait for the timer?
---
A couple of months ago I took quite a long break from dbd, it was perfect and made the game a bit more refreshing after I started playing again. Would heavily recommend that.
---
Peggle's pretty hard not to love, honestly.
---
This would be cool. You have my support.
---
Stand ability: bonk
---
They should just increase the base duration of his power so it's easier to injure multiple survivors
---
I thought it was just a Switch bug lol it happened to me yesterday screen just went white
---
 A. How long ago was that B. Why does that matter C. Why do you care so much
---
You'll do good next time!, I believe

* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
This happened to my cousin on death hook so he got caught and died
---
Well, there are plenty of ways for survivors to abuse a killer that can't put them in the basement (if BHVR starts penalizing it) or chooses not to put them in the basement (due to the bug) to be nice.
---
So I agree, I don't think BHVR can punish people over it because there are plenty of survivors that will start - and some are already - abusing the expectation that the basement is a no-hook zone so that they cannot ever be hooked.
---
At the same time, killers can abuse it for an easy 3-gen with no counterplay whatsoever, maybe it's time to just take a break from DbD until they can fix it, people play pretty scummy on both sides...
---
Ah ok, that's pretty shitty then.
---
Well it‚Äôs also teams, their design team does good work, their balancing team is kinda retarded but tries(and i guess really hate legion) but whoever the actually shit is their QA bug testing and maintenance team needs to be fired, it has been too long, too many glitches for them to be justified they clearly do nothing and are not interested in any form of maintenance, they are responsible for 1 thing fix bugs, if they cannot even do that right what is BHVR paying them for?

I'll probably get oni but i have 2 extremely petty complaints with him, 1. his nails look stank AF and 2. i hate the feet on every skin so when i break pallets normally i have to look at that. XD
---
My rule when I play killer grabbing the last survivor :
---
If he starts wiggling, I do a no with the head, if he continues I hook him
---
If he don't wiggle, I give the hatch
---
I don't think that's too bad
---
Would rather not change the language of my whole ps4, but seems like that's the only way. Thanks.
---
Its is the only way, sorry bud
---
It's the same as any killer though?
---
This is worse than I would have imagined then.
---
As opposed to sprinting for 30 seconds while outside of the killers terror radius which used to happen all the time? 
---
This change makes no difference to how legion is meant to work
---
Please fix dead hard, it has been bugged since I started playing
---
He hacked his legacy skins after losing them. Behavior didn‚Äôt do anything to help him, so he felt he had to get them back himself. Eventually people found out he hacked them, and he got banned.
---
Now for the rest of the killers to get some custom chase music. I really feel like the chase music adds to the intensitu and scaryness.
---
I could skim C++ for dummies and prolly code this shit better than they do
---
This made me think of a world where people end up as more NSFW versions of Pickle Rick, drunk and crazy, and it's technically gay because both sides are the same gender, but...
---
You know, it's just weird instead of erotic, still gay though.
---
I will DM it to you once I am home
---
Maybe except hillbilly. Fun to play as and against, plus he is really really good

Had the same issue with oni yesterday, oddly enough the only dedicated server issues I‚Äôve had has only been with oni.

I also updated the Key add-on and David King's portrait.

I didn't know this, but it took me too long to guide my friend out and once out, still bugged, falling off the stairs eh?

Found this on FB. Dont know original poster though :/.

Nah why improve them game when you can just sell more $10 cosmetics?
---
I knew the pipping system was unbalanced but this is getting ridiculous
---
"Legion looks a little like GF, get rid of him"
---
You can add killers getting stuck inside generators when they kick them to the list of current bugs.
---
Imagine thinking the wake up bug (which only granted a bonus speed to all actions) and the sb bug (which only allowed you to use the perk at will) is on par with the basement bug which, shall I remind you, makes the match literally unplayable for the survivor hooked in the basement
---
Survivor don't cleanse, that's why you run apples with Plague lol. What does Legion have above Plague? Map "pressure" ? At least Plague can be intimidating with the right addons, Legion isn't even close. You quite literally just said "Play him like Trapper without Traps", like what,  a powerless killer? Do you realize that's what I have been complaining about this whole time? That they are essentially a powerless killer with nothing good going for them? They are supposed to be good at stall and map pressure, but are terrible at both, and even more terrible in a chase. At least Plague sometimes can one-two survivors to the ground, Legion can't even do that.
---
About the winrates... this isn't exactly a game you can balance around winrates, take Nurse for example, let's buff her because her win rate is trash! You can provide examples and ideas of why you think Legion is good, but they're undeniably unsalvageable in their current situation. Are they more fun to play against? Sure. Are they in a better state than before? I can't really tell you, at least you could play Cooldown Legion before the rework, and that was fun.
---
Bc Spirit has been nerfed in the name of that DC campaign. It‚Äôs entitled as fuck. And soon you‚Äôll be getting banned for it
---
Sorry fam but this is a repost

doesn't even matter

The thing is that make this map nearly unplayable for most killer who don't have some mean to bypass a loop

One time bug or working every time now?

So this doesn‚Äôt work for consoles

That works when there is someone to make the gift ahaha
---
Same i do like the overall map tho, a lot of obstacles but not in a way where it‚Äôs and for anyone except maybe hillbilly
---
I wasn‚Äôt the one working with the opposing team and cheating. So yeah the escape really mattered at that point. I couldn‚Äôt let him have it when he was being an asshole

No one is able to gift it to you?

&gt;Changes that the game developers have play tested and then pushed with confidence.

Remembers legion on release.

Remembers legion after the change.
---
Remembers plague and how useless half her power is.
---
Remembers all of the maps that have been released recently.
---
Somehow I don't think we can trust the devs' "confidence"

Haha yea, usually I use dead hard for sprint burst and deliverance for iron will but i‚Äôve been using that in kyf games

omg I love it! He's so cute &lt;3

With the amount of perks there are and game's age it's difficult not to unintentionally copy someone.
---
Its not even that good a perk tbh. I dont use it as a survivor and as a killer - get slugged
---
Are we supposed to get the event items for free? I got the david jacket which I've never had yet didnt get the killer items so I was wondering if I accidentally got it
---
I‚Äôm probably the only one playing anyone but Oni as killer right now. I usually balance playing survivor and killer but I feel like I‚Äôm gonna wanna off myself after one game of survivor given the archive challenges and new killer.
---
No its a one time bug. I think its some differences with latency i guess. One of the survivors was the host of this match
---
They are in Spanish (except the licensed ones like Myers, Leatherface etc) so I assume they would be though.
---
Life's complicated for me those times haha
---
Maybe that explain why I spent 70 hrs on a game last week
---
Yeah I had that on Myers like 5-7 months ago, accept on a pallet. I got tbagged by one shit head the whole game lol.
---
If you insist.
---
Hes certainly harder on console like nurse but just like nurse still possible hes just gonna take a lot of practice
---
What? Kinda buffs? He's already the most ridiculous annoying killer in the game where nobody f'n says "overpowered" while he makes you scream up everywhere once, gives you skill checks everywhere on the screen, forces you to calm down in an extra skill checks, makes you unable to use pallets while being electrified and I probably even forgot 1-2 annoying things he does. It's ridiculous.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
What sub have you been on?
---
He just feels sluggish and slow on the wind up, feels like an eternity catching up to people in the chase. when he goes blood mode he is so predictable and easy to dodge in my experience. The dash also feels kinda wonky idk I might just need to play with him a little more but I haven‚Äôt been able to get any killer matches at all today.
---
The thing is would you physically see a member of the legion go to it or would they spawn into it? What‚Äôs the counter play?
---
The title is comparing how he grabbed me to prayer beads Spirit
---
i got teleported to another location when I finally could hit somebody running below me, but by then the game was already over
---
but it should?
---
Lmao, Bill was a FREE licensed character as Valve we‚Äôre not being stingy with the license so therefore his cosmetic is also free.
---
Ash is not free. His cosmetics have not been free and this ugly sweater won‚Äôt be free either.
---
Happened to me to
---
Steam and I'm 23! What about you?
---
I was surprised when this happened. Once I let go of my R1 Button to stop struggling, nothing happened. The Barmeter ran out on it's own
---
My favorite killer is nea, while favorite survivor is trapper
---
That would explain why so many killers were whiffing at me last night. I'm in the red ranks, but I'm not THAT good at dodging killers, esp red rank ones. (And I don't use sprint burst or dead hard)
---
Jeez I just made a mistake no need to be a asshole
---
Oh wait, that's already a thing. My bad, hehe.
---
Just wanted to tell you that with this meme you're going to create a hell of arguments about which platform is better
---
It looks like you have shock therapy, which functions exactly as it does now. Then the passive terror radius madness generation has been replaced by shock blast, which increases madness on all survivors in your terror radius.
---
Already got two ‚Äúlaughs in  pc, master race‚Äù
---
Make your choice is the other perk here that while not as clear cut people prefer to keep at tier 1 or 2 because while you get 10 more seconds of exposed on the one person that's 10 more seconds until the perk can be applied to someone else if you have multiple hooks.
---
Not how consoles work :(
---
I‚Äôm 22 :) if you don‚Äôt have the funds for it to spend real money and no one is able to gift you I‚Äôll gift you the cursed legacy chapter on steam. I don‚Äôt know how steam works to be honest I just play dead by daylight but I‚Äôll get my partner to help me figure it out :)
---
What do you mean people get stuck in the sky
---
I don't even know how it sounds bc I couldn't get to the servers from yesterday
---
Adding onto this, maybe only let him teleport when he‚Äôs in a locker? That way there‚Äôs always a member in a locker? Sounds like it could fit the 4 killers vibe.
---
Must've put his headphones backward
---
Sounds kinda Inuit.
---
Something like a Qalupalik would be a cool new monstrous killer.
---
If there were two killers, they would HAVE to be individually be MUCH weaker than any other killer. I'm talking 100% movement speed (AT MAX, I'd even say SLOWER than the survivors), no power at all. It would be absolutely broken if there were two legions in one match, regardless on how weak they apparently are.
---
Think of it this way: 4 survivors, 2 killers. 
---
- Start of the match, Julie find Jake, and Frank finds Meg. Now there's 2 survivors in a chase, 2 survivors left doing gens (not to mention the fact that there's EIGHT perks in play, so they'd almost definitely be working through ruin)
---
- Lets say it's a 4 man SWF playing optimally. Dwight and Claudette are sticking to the gens during chases, powering through ruin.
---
- 2 gens pop, Julie downs Jake and hooks him. Frank still chasing Meg. Julie decides not to camp, and finds Claudette, starting to chase her. 
---
- Now we've got Jake on hook, Claudette and Meg in chase, Dwight going for the unhook. THEY'RE PLAYING OPTIMALLY AND STILL NOBODY IS ON GENS AFTER JUST ONE HOOK. 
---
This get's even WORSE if the survivors AREN'T playing optimally, and the killers DO decide to play scummy.
---
- Claudette and Meg run into eachother whilst both in a chase. They're now stuck between Frank AND Julie coming from both directions, they have no option where to go, since they are flanked and both get hit. Assuming one was already injured, they can leave her slugged and go after the other one, almost guaranteeing a down since she won't be able to loop or run any tile at all, with two killers in play.
---
- All the pallets are used TWICE as fast as usual, limiting options even more
---
- If Julie decided to camp Jake, Frank could continue keeping pressure on the generators, completely eliminating the weakness that camping has.
---
Literally the only way it could work is by having the killers being individually weaker + force THEM to work together, much like the survivors are forced to work together.
---
Oh damn, so you won't have the passive radar of screams anymore, you'll have to pop shock blast everytime to see if someone's around. That sounds pretty shitty, but I'll have to see it in game.
---
Cuz beast of prey exists? No stun required
---
 Just bloodlust. Which you cant break them out of without, you guessed it. Stunning them
---
Only true Feng mains will stay
---
When you encounter the the same killer for the 90000000000th time
---
Wow dude is that real ? That's just so nice of you ! But you're probably student as you're 22, is it okay for you ? 
---
I think there is a few conditions to steam gift, idk exactly how it works / especially if we're not on the same region etc..
---
Well, your power is pretty broken. You simply position the other 3 at gens and congratulations, you just won the game because they can't complete the last gen.
---
A much better power would be if the other 3 members were positioned around the map and you could switch between them quickly, a bit like in GTA V where you can switch between franklin, trevor and michael. The inactive members will vanish and be invisible to the survivors without collision, but give you hints on where they are.
---
#1 was mentioned in the patch notes
---
Camera glitches out and your "in the sky" unable to see anything, does seem to fix if you get saved and rehooked but yeah, prepare for people to do a bunch of basement builds for the easy 4ks as you completely nullify a survivor if you hook them down there
---
I didn‚Äôt know about it until I had played survivor last night. I don‚Äôt think I actually hooked anybody in the basement unless they were on death hook but Jesus I got left for dead by my team because the rest of them were blind too
---
Use sprintburst and urban
---
I saw it happen to someone on Autohaven Wreckers - they were dead on hook, and I saw their body fly through the bottom of the map right after the body was hooked. I thought nothing of it and assumed it was a feature and not a bug of being dead on hook until I saw these threads on the bug. I was also hooked in the basement last night and did NOT have the bug either.
---
You cant talk about base kit then start throwing out addons. Its counter intuitive.
---
Hasnt urban been nerfed hard last patch ?
---
Does everyone fucking forget beast of prey exists?
---
Exaplin to me how you would have countered a legion with beast of prey and nemesis.
---
Go ahead I'll wait
---
You all forgot the triple skillcheck. Three timmers running at the same time.
---
"Billy is OP" -  captain 15
---
How did you read it before? It's kinda clear but anyways, using mori makes this challenge a pretty easy oneshot
---
Nope I‚Äôm not a student I work pretty much full time and it‚Äôs absolutely fine I don‚Äôt mind at all, I‚Äôm happy to do it! What region are you? I‚Äôm in the UK. 
---
We‚Äôll figure something out I‚Äôm at work just on my lunch break but when I‚Äôm home later I‚Äôll give you a message :)
---
Seems fair.
---
That is too powerful please nerf more
---
Yes, but the movement is pretty subtle, so I would think the killer would have to have eagle vision to notice movement while they‚Äôre walking around
---
I'm in Europe so i guess it will work ! 
---
Alright , good luck at work then dude ! :) 
---
And thank you very much
---
I thought it meant stop it from opening like interrupt a survivor that‚Äôs opening it, but just preventing them from being powered makes more sense
---
Not everyone in red ranks is skilled
---
I said even in the first message that Plague had good addons, not really referring to the base kit. Besides, Legion doesn't even have good addons, yeah sure, more duration is nice, but come on, one of their ultra rare doesn't even work half of the time, and the other one is just OK. All of his purples except cold dirt are a joke, and even then Cold Dirt isn't even that good.

‚Ä¢survivors who teleport back after fast vaulting a window (especially annoying, when you mindgamed them into vaulting)

‚Ä¢getting stunned by a pallet even though you are like 2-4 meters away.

‚Ä¢m1 and m2 Inputs simply not registering (has been there since last patch though)

I have to agree though, survivors definitely worse atm.

Ok if DW is gonna be this nonlethal, then the timer should down you before you finish mending if you are mending.

---
Dont forget piggy
---
Got excited to check out new killer, woke my roommate up in the process.
---
Seems to only happen on first hook. Honestly if until this bug is fixed if I am headed to the basement first hook, I will just DC. Its a waste of time otherwise
---
I've had my bloodletting vanish before too. All you gotta do is reverify and it should be there. If not, contact support.
---
For the context: for anyone who doesn't already know there's a bug where the survivors screen goes black when they've been hooked in the basement, the only fix is getting out of there blind.
---
You cant defend tru3 on this sub without people getting pissy. Everyone thinks tru3 is a killer main when he plays both. A good SWF can beat anyone with the way gen speed is that's why he complains. Hes literally said in one of his videos if killers were op he'd complain about that too, it's why he never uses moris
---
Yep
---
Finally with Knuckles now. Cant wait to fly around the map and climb walls
---
Imagine getting downvoted into oblivion for stating a simple fact.
---
Sue this guy. It‚Äôs illegal to take pics of people w/o permission ü§íüò§üò§üò§
---
I saw the title and the picture of the basement and though they fixed the basement glitch
---
Not w pink Nea :-(
---
Yes let him loop me for the entire game, so fun. See what I just did?
---
is it possible to have 2 killers in a custom still?
---
Thank you so much ! 
---
You can MP me there or simply add me on steam i guess : 157267016
---
Yeah, thats kind of the point. This is a SURVIVAL horror game.
---
theres definitely things that suck for the killer such as gen grabs not registering and weird pallet stuns, but i would say with complete confidence that the reason the killer kill rate has improved since the last stats, is because killers can get window and pallet hits when they shouldn't. With a game like DBD, where last-second actions matter so much, it removes alot of counterplay for survivors even if they react fast enough because they get hit anyway.
---
Sure
---
Tbf there wasn't much room for looping maybe 2 rotations it wasn't worth it and they also limited pallet use later
---
You get triggered by numbers? Do you know how stupid that sounds?
---
You said his base kit was bad. Which it isnt. Then you say that plague has good addons. But I'm not talking about her addons. I'm talking about base kit.
---
They should make survivor achievements harder. Escape without getting downed or something. It's supposed to be an *achievement*, not something that should be easy.
---
Same with the archive challenges. They should be challenging. Some of them were just tedious and boring, which I'm happy they fixed, but some of them should be pretty difficult imo.
---
Lmfao
---
As someone who basically dies by saving all my team mates, I was EXTREMELY hesitant to run to save them last night when it was the oni. Lol. Fucking terrifying
---
He was joking dumbass.
---
probably oni, demogorgon takes some effort into using his power efficiently. I wouldn‚Äôt consider him the more fun character due to his curve
---
Imho new DS isn't even that good. I run it to try and use it and most games I never have a chance to use it. I find myself saying "Why am I running this useless perk" a lot bc I either a) Never get tunneled. B) run the killer to long and it deactivates. C) get slugged until it wears off. Don't get me wrong it can come in clutch when it does go off say at the end of the game, but most times the perk is highly disappointing in my experience.
---
Of the two Demogorgon is more unique I‚Äôd say. Both are fun, but Oni is more or less Hillbilly + Myers so there‚Äôs less unique factor there.

This update so sucks have many bugs now...

I also stuck in 3 games at generator ( 2 with legion , 1 with hag)

White screen bug after get hit by oni rage ( happen last night)   
---
Basement also bug  
---
Medkit bug too  
---
Seriously sad release with bug. Better maintance for 1 day long and fix all that bug.
---
That's a win for me I love being chased that's the only reason I play survivor not have a killer bloodlust me have beast of pray kick in and die when my bleed out timer goes down
---
more like gf playsh
---
A crazy fun shitshow
---
Have people not actually played Legion since the patch? Survivors with DW and DS can‚Äôt try and hide in lockers now. That makes legion the only killer to break the DS invincibility aspect. 
---
Using things like Bamboozle allows Legion to vault windows ultra fast and entity block them, cutting off a lot of potentially nasty loops. Survivors have to mend, which takes time off generators. 
---
Legion is like speedy Gonzales. Not saying he‚Äôs top tier killer, but that speed buff and some perk combinations make him so nasty. Survivors will almost always be wounded, even if they try and heal. You can also still use perks like STBFL since you‚Äôre still going to M1 to down them, and now you can worry less about hitting your obsession.
---
Not saying the DW isn‚Äôt still janky, but that speed buff and vault speed buff are actually kind of disgusting. Legion is basically fast vaulting or in some cases vaulting faster than survivors fast vault.
---
Imagine control both Gates standing in one place. Like i did, playing on Huntress.
---
I close the hatch, and both Gates spawned so close, what i can just Stand with hatchet and deny any attempt to escape. Its unbalanced Shit what should be fixed
---
IM MY ORIGINAL CHARACTER BLONIC
---
so survivors get their objective done, most of them survive to the end but it doesn't matter because the killer can stand in a spot and one-shot anyone that tries to open them.
---
*we're only called the Republic. We actually are a communistic society*
---
They did!!? Good
---
Last night when I played, the majority of the killers were being intently malicious. They were running agitation and going out of their way to hook survivors in the basement
---
Oni for sure.
---
Do you have a link to the perk icons, they look dope.
---
I honestly think the rift is shit. I mean, yes, cosmetics are cool, but the challenges are just shit. I don't want to use monstrous shrine, I don't want to tunnel the obsession like a motherfucker, I want to play the goddamn game. It's a bit like the "quests" in league of legends which are completely ignorable since they are shit too.
---
Sounds like the survivors werent working well together. If two go for both gates simultaneously, you can‚Äôt guard both.
---
Happened to me yesterday
---
I just gave up adept killer achievements until BHVR change something, if they never change, those achievements will remain untouched.
---
I already have too much trouble farming BP to unlock all perks for all killers.
---
It might work better on a set pathing system. The maps are set enough so BHVR could set patrol routes  around each map for the three NPC's. With each NPC moving to a patrol node and continuing when the PC  switches away from them. Although im thinking about NPC's detecting Survivors. Maybe an a audio queue, something that doesnt make the Hag completely redundant.
---
Wouldn't that be the case for survivors aswell? I played three times in a row against spirit, I earned the right to just quit. Or I played three times on the underground complex. Sounds stupid imo and is the exact thing killers are complaining about.

Spirit got dedicated server'ed. It was very effective!
---
Just get oni, he radiates big dick energy
---
They‚Äôre probably getting buried in all of the basement glitch posts, which I guess for this time is good since we want BHVR to fix this glitch ASAP as there are killers playing the game normally that don‚Äôt know about the glitch (and are probably trying to do their totems) and some who are willingly focusing people for basement hooks. If you get the glitch, the game is over as you basically can‚Äôt do anything, even after getting unhooked. This may be why players you see in the basement either immediately DC on hook or walk around aimlessly after being unhooked.
---
As for the rank showing, I was for it, but pretty much 95% of the time, the ranking was on point for me. Even when in cases where someone below rank 15 was in the lobby, I took it as a SWF as that‚Äôs how most played when I would join up with them via matchmaking. With the rank thing gone, I‚Äôll just assume my games are still the same.
---
Who said one shots? They didnt get their onjective done. Only part of it. She doesnt have unlimited hatchets. If she wastes them, she‚Äôll have to reload
---
Q and E
---
Almost no survivor feels that way
---
Thx mate, but at least you can have a telescope on your console,  these star are beautiful
---
No mither, unbreakable, selfcare and inner strength
---
Wait im on pc, How do you get the meg mask?
---
Does everyone fucking forget that long chases are fucking **terrible** in this game? 
---
Yeah gj if the killer manages to maintain Bloodlust on you after hitting you in an extended chase after already hitting you once, you are downed. Big fucking deal. It¬¥s not like 10 other killers can easily kill you sooner much easier than that or simply instadown you but waaaaaaah we are going to whine about managing to "easily" down a guy while the rest of the team pops 3 gens. 
---
It¬¥s a bad combo, it sounds amazing on paper if someone who doesn¬¥t understand this game looks at it, but it has been tested on the PTB and no, it is nowhere near close to being as good as some people think it is, and even when it was a thing on the PTB people were getting better results with different Legion builds.
---
I would just get it over with if you have the challenge. Its not your fault BHVR manages to break the basement every other DLC update.
---
I do this way too often... well except i play around with the non SWF player. I mean they are playing the game, but the game is rigged in their favour ;)
---
Ofc that‚Äôs what I said! I just wanted to state that it is not like killers are unaffected.
---
I already finished the challenge, so I'm personally only gonna hook you there if you're a toxic little shit
---
Megamind Hag is kinda spooky.
---
Pick the biggest male character, try it again. It should be a bit more accurate.
---
All survivor have the same hitbox so if you play like Feng or Claudette it looks even worse cause they're small but with the same hitbox as every other survivor like David, Jeff,...
---
That's an improvement.
---
The ONLY killer I've been getting is Oni. &gt;\_&lt;
---
Even worse, I'm spawning too close to him. 
---
(PC, red ranks, if that matters)
---
How are you spectating the Killer?
---
I actually try to avoid it unless I‚Äôm failing as Oni so about half n half
---
Isn't the dc penalty live already? Wouldn't it hurt you more to dc?
---
I want the last of us exclusives on PC then, I wanna play as that girl. You see it‚Äôs stupid, exclusives from a console only game on PC.
---
Its terrible. In the case with 1 survivor left, that failed to complete all gens and find hatch before the killer, that survivor shouldn't get an easy escape with the gates, but theres a huge difference between the gate wars being hard to win, and straight-up impossible. 
---
In the case of my game, 3 survivors made it to the endgame. one tried for the gate straight away but got downed and hooked right in the middle of the gates, and she killed herself. I tried to loop the killer around the area while the other survivor got the gate opened but there's no pallets there anymore and it was a pretty easy down, and that last survivor is easy bait. 
---
So the game went from being in the survivor's side, because they did the gens and the killer didnt get his kills, to it being a 4k simply because of the exit gates.
---
Wasted pallets and farmed a teammate.... ouch.
---
Don't tunnel. Crazy right?
---
Demogorgon is awesome but has no cosmetics except a good p3 and Oni is decent but has more cosmetics and a bad p3. Maybe it‚Äôs because I like Stranger Things and I‚Äôm biased.
---
What‚Äôs happening with the basement I can‚Äôt find anything ?
---
That is it, the oni mains are taking over
---
That's what I want to know
---
Yes, their base kit is utter trash. I quite literally wrote down the reasons why it's trash, and you replied to me that he's "good" with perks that are good on any 115% killer and that I should play him like a trap-less trapper, which is a very contrived way of saying he has no power or that is power has no use in a chase. Their stall is not good because it's too low to be effective, and even if it was effective, it would just balance out the extra time he has to spend chasing people without a power. Their addons do nothing to compensate for this, and even extremely contrived and specific builds and perks that are supposed to play to their strengths are just better on other killers. Their power barely gives you enough time to compensate for the fact that you used your power, this is how useless they are.
---
Its the worst because on PS4 every damn killer I have played against is running basement builds.
---
If you're playing SWF, slowly unhook a survivor and then stop half way through, apparently that fixes this according to another reddit user but I haven't tried it myself.
---
Ahh, thanks!
---
Eh, Laurie has been out for a long time. People who will make good use of it already have it. People who are new - it doesn't matter that you have to chase them for additional 15 seconds.
---
It‚Äôs one of the best survivor perks lol
---
Does anyone else sweat when they're playing a non sabo Jake but someone is going around breaking hooks and you know the killer will think it's you?
---
Why not just work through Ruin?
---
Thats fair, maybe i did go off on a tangent not related to the initial post and i should of made it clear that it had no relation to reason with why he was being attacked, he is a very informative streamer who is entertaining, a person who definetly doesnt deserve to feel attacked online for doing what he loves/ his job.
---
They said we would get them mid year then gave pc them and never said a word. It's bs but hey the devs never cared about us anyway
---
When they implement basic stuff like Rank Rewards.. maybe, I'll bother giving them props.
---
In the meantime I havent been able to wiggle or struggle since patch
---
The helmet wasn‚Äôt activated
---
join us at r/Rainbow6.
---
Why they didn't just change it so the deep wound effect doesn't go down when X meters away from the killer? xD I'm playing both sides and I can say it's stupid that it doesn't go down when running lol They should buff legion and instead they buff survivors XD
---
If they were useless they would be at the bottom of the stat list. But they arent. Chill out. They'll have their time just like any other killer. They arent the best killer and never will be. But they also arent the worst and can dish out just as much damage in the right hands as any other killer.
---
Not on ps4 and xbox
---
100%
---
I suspected the chase music scared the shit out of you when playing killer. Thanks for clarifying that.
---
4 meters per second.
---
When you hook a survivor in the basement, their camera is teleported out of the map and they basically die instantly but still have to wait the game out.
---
The whole point of this meme is that people like the music
---
I do, It's just not fun to play against
---
Either ruin dies in 10 seconds (When you're killer)
---
Or you see a red bar all game as survivor and finish gens anyway
---
Wait I'm sorry, Did you just say it's fun to play against ruin ? 
---
I'm talking about removing unfun shit and balancing the game accordingly
---
The Ayuwoki
---
Had to turn up my tv brightness
---
They should add build in ruin and that's ut
---
It happens often since the last update : when you get hooked in the basement, your character goes under the map or the camera glitches and you can't see anything for the rest of the game.
---
I found the best way was to never play the killer with anything but their own perks until you had adept. Then you get used to them without the extra perks. I'm on PS4 and I think even Nurse wasn't too awful.
---
Bitch plz. Feng is and always will be better. But yui is still cute tho
---
Trapper should have 2 traps without add on for starters and disarming should be longer with skill checks. Failing a skill check should injure a survivor, but not be able to put him in dying state. Rework ultra rare add on (forgot name) that injures when disarmed into making skill checks harder and be able to put survivors into dying state with failed skill checks.
---
Was that a teleport grab?
---
god damnit
---
The basement is the worse part about the game.
---
There is a new bug in the basement that turns your screen into a flashbang when you get hooked, and when you are saved you float eternally in the void, so you become pretty much non existant
---
Oof. I thought it was a smaller shop than that that was short on hands. (And maybe they are if they have a buttload of projects.) Either way, that's definitely not good then.
---
Buuuut it has no counterplay? Which was the discussion? And it doesn't take very long dude lol with the legion addon to reduce deep wound timer on 2nd hit, he can see you, go into power, get a free hit, hit you again to lower timer, and then just follow you till you go down in like 20secs.
---
That's not very long. If you mean to tell me the killer has no chance of winning taking 30secs (and never more) to down people then we'll have to agree to disagree.
---
Actually, rereading comments makes it sounds like they've changed adept killer perks..?
---
Thanks for adding to the conversation
---
It cost you nothing and no time to just not respond
---
Impossible

I didnt say that. Dont straw man. The balance would be to make it last for a set amount of time. I dont even run ruin on killer anymore. I play against sweaty swf at rank 1. Ruin is as much of a crutch as it is a disability
---
Yeah, as killer if I get that map I pretty much resign myself to the fact that I‚Äôm not getting a 4K
---
Once you get hooked in the basement the screen turns back or grey, there were screenshots on other threads. I saw it happen to someone who was dead on hook, his body flew through the bottom of the map, but ofc I thought nothing of it because it was his third hook.
---
I only experienced it once with huntress, that it was a hit, even got the hit sound but nothing happened. I've recently started playing again, and it really improved.
---
When a survivor is hooked up the basement you infinitely fall through time and space
---
Not live until the 5th.
---
Make your own post with this. It's honestly a great idea.
---
[;)](
---
Grinding out the Wraith one took me FOREVER. His perks are goddawful, and it was before the EGC came in, so the last survivor kept getting hatch.
---
R/wooosh
---
It was a bug, the Person on the Hook, who wont die is me, and I somehow got to see the Killers view once I was on the Hook
---
Deep Wounds no longer regresses while running.
---
You can get hit with Borrowed Time, run the entire way across the map, and still have a full bar.
---
The counterplay is there even with both of them.  You can pre-throw pallets without stunning the legion, he cannot break them otherwise he loses Bloodlust, and you can loop him around a good loop where he cannot easily catch you and when he can lose sight lines. 
---
You can theorycraft builds here all day long and talk numbers in a perfect scenario, in reality it doesn¬¥t matter, a good Nurse can fuck you with actual 0 counterplay, this build has been tested and it really doesn¬¥t work as well as you think. 
---
Not that it matters because it¬¥s out of the game anyway.
---
&gt;Seriously less than 10 people have gotten away in the past 50 matches I've played.
---
 DLR: DBD IS A FUN ASS GAME 
---
Survivors having mad fun escaping 5% of their games for sure.
---
exactly why I prefer corrupt
---
Its like watching a lost pet look for his home üò¢
---
Well they are going to get a lot of money from Yui (I woulda rather gotten goth/biker skins for Feng *drools* and Oni is pretty good. I think they do need at least 2 people trying to actively rework old and useless perks better. They really just need to overbuff some and see what sticks. part of it is people just getting stuck ina rut. I think the biggest issue with this DLC is the timing, why didn't they try to push this towards the Lunar Event (even though it's Chinese).
---
What‚Äôs his name?
---
I once had a similar idea for a new killer thta used lockers, it was supposed to be some kind of bogeyman that entered the lockers and teleported between them on the map
---
you cant fond anything? the sub has been filled with videos of it non stop, well to explain it to you, if the killer hooks you in the basement theres a high chance you'll be send to the void as in tou camera goes crazy as fuck showing the sky (really pretty scenery) But if you get unhooked you stay in a falling animation and you cant do anything at all and if its your second hook it will struggle on its own for some reason
---
*We couldn't fix the issue of a weird-screen in the basement, so we made it like that on every hook to provide consistence.*
---
Yeah even in the sub I can‚Äôt find anything. But that‚Äôs really weird nice
---
awesome
---
Play another perk instead of ruin? Maybe try Corrupt Intervention or Discordance?
---
That would be dope!
---
Sounds pretty cool, wonder how well Hex:Anarchy would turn out.
---
Great power idea, gives more uses for lockers.
---
i like sprint burst, it will help you not leave scartchmarks, sinye u be walkin, also its the best perk for reposiotioning or gettin to teammates in need fast.
---
dead hard is just so satisfying, yeah its kinda bugged but still works (sometimes)
---
and head on is super fun, a bit tricky to use but its great.
---
Ofc it's a Claudette
---
I would buy it, but I have to buy cosmetics to my girls first (julie, susie, kate)
---
"Oh my GOD you're Amanda Young! So you met the real Jigsaw right? What was he like? I saw all those traps on the news and they were SOOO inspiring, how do you build all that stuff?" \[This continues for several hours\]  
---
"Please...I'm trying to be sneaky...Stop talking."
---
buy feng if you can, I'm bias but personally I think lithe is the best exhaustion perk in the game
---
Ah! That explains it. I assumed it would come with the new chapter and got confused with still getting a dc in like 60-80% of my matches last night. I suppose people are taking the last opportunity to get it out of their systems before it results in a penalty.
---
I feel we‚Äôve done a good job so far.
---
If it was basement they already know about it and are trying to fix it
---
It was 2 survivors before... just make some friends
---
That really sucks. A tip to make this one easier is to run Borrowed Time. It'll give you a safe unhook. Make it to egc and farm someone off the hook even if you die your challenge will be complete. Just gotta make it to egc.
---
yea, but on the bright side, He got his revenge ;)
---
Yeah it's good, only have it on plague at the moment but definitely a good one!
---
The difference is how hard it is to be that "good nurse" compared to a legion getting a free hit from his power and then simply having to follow you for the free down.
---
And you're hilarious with that drop the pallet early then break line of sight to break bloodlust shit lmao have you played killer? At best there's like 1-2 loops on each may where that's possible. It's not that hard to keep bloodlust up my dude

Ruin is too luck based fir me to bring it every game
---
Kinda sad tbh but kinda Typical at this point
---
Jasmine masters memes are the best memes change my mind
---
Yeah I may have to start getting used to not having it but gens just go so fast without it. Yeah I'll try and get corrupt on my other killers, cheers
---
TASTE!

I too agree its bullshit in most cases. Sometimes I just stay in the middle as the EGC timer goes down and there's nothing they can do.

How is it not a guarantee?  When Feral frenzy ends you have a \[default\] 4 second cool-down.  If you can't get yourself hidden in 4 seconds, you deserve whatever punishment you get next.
---
Fuck this bill
---
According to the stat list, Nurse is a trash killer. That is enough to realize they aren't all that important. I once again, gave you all the reasons why Legion, against competent survivors, is the worst killer in the game. You are entitled to your own opinion, but as long as this argument is "Legion isn't bad because it's good" I'm sorry but as long as I'm making points and you just don't reply to them I don't see a reason for all this. Good luck on your games I guess.
---
I main survivor so idk if im bias but im also a decent killer (rank 6) and I have 0 problems with DS and on survivor (rank 3) very few problems with ruin
---
Aren't you just a hateful, sad little critter.
---
It sounds cool but it's not loud enough for me. I feel like it should be a little louder.
---
It's funny, it might otherwise be 'ok' as you could just try to avoid basement hooks.
---
But there are archive challenges that REQUIRE basement hooks.
---
Well at least he happy about the fact they made this easier before it required 2 saves
---
Yeah Im starting to think that now. Gens just go so fast though. I literally don't have time to hook all 4 survivors once let alone 3 times lmao. 
---
Then it feels like I either get a 2-3k but have to camp for it or I just decide to lose
---
&gt;checks front page of this sub, dbd forums or twitter
---
Nope, literally nobody else.
---
If you have pop that‚Äôs a reeeealy strong perk
---
My games go fine on legion. I'm sure yours do too. You had a few bad games against swfs and got on reddit. And yes. Nurse currently is trash right now. Certainly not the number 1 spot. And that's fine. Stats dont lie. They are FACT. Ignore them all you want. But that's what the dev's look at. That's how they determine changes.
---
You should drink some water. Too much salt can dehydrate you
---
To be fair spirit just got nerfed, so it makes sense if someone wants to try her out. Same for Legion
---
Especially since LF revving up before getting to the pallet is like a free loop.
---
true i realized that after i thought i fucked up. considerin cluadette wasnt gettin any more perks anwaus. so until, if, i get another teachable, dh will continue to spawn every time after this one right?
---
"unless camping or tunneling" soooo... Just 99% of all.games? Lot of times you get called out doing this even if you're clearly not doing it
---
death ‚â† escape
---
Yeah... I'm kinda stuck on this one
---
Oh calm down
---
I literally posted this yesterday and everyone called me an idiot
---
Still hot
---
I use pop on spirit, billy etc.. anyone with the speed to use it but otherwise I don't find that it helps much.
---
You can do it, of course it's about luck and the players you have in your team but it's more than possible now since its just 1 survivor you got to save. It took me over 10 games to finally get it done but it's out the way
---
same, in other games too
---
NOED is fine tho and is actually healthy for the game by adding a pseudo second objective for survivors. If NOED wasn't a thing, you wouldn't have to worry about doing totems at all and just focus on generators with some occasional unhooking.
---
"Nurse currently is trash" , just quite literally answered all of my questions about you. I'm done.
---
Corrupt is good but has its own RNG issues. You can get bad map RNG and survivors spawning close to an unblocked generator anyway, and it gets done in a minute either way. And due to those gens usually being far from each other, it can force a horrible lategame gen placement that you cannot defend at all.
---
Speed of slow. I feel like my grandma could *walk* faster than the survivors.
---
The hatch isn't dumb if it wasn't there it would be unbalanced.
---
Oni

I disagree if u suck with him it dosnt mean he suck

I'm rank 8-5 and 4 ked every time except 1 time when I 2k cuz a key

&gt;It is the first day or days of a big chapter update I think you all are taking this too seriously. 
---
What do you mean? They had this update on the test server, everything was fine there. They did something prior to release, didn't even bother to test it (or did) and shipped it knowingly with game breaking bugs.
---
Thank you for being the hero we all need but do not deserve.
---
*Menacing*
---
^^^^wahh
---
No worriesüëç
---
Idk, man. I watched him go into the killer shack, then \*NANI!
---
I didn‚Äôt have the bloodpoints to get perks on oni so I played survivor yesterday, and almost every game when he lunged outside of his power it seemed like he teleported a few meters.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just like a visuals glitch for me or not, but it‚Äôs def a similar experience to what you had.
---
Side note: this did not happen every game I played, just a few
---
I got accused of camping because I stayed a bit to put down traps as hag.
---
Still no/dh
---
This happened to me too since I play solo and everyone dies fast. I recommend you try do as much gens quickly or get in a chase so people actually do gens and once the exit gates are open, run up with BT and save them. This challenge took so long because people don‚Äôt do gens or they farm me and I get tunneled. With the new kindred buff you‚Äôll be able to see who‚Äôs going for the save so you can stay at a gen.
---
Its not camping if all the survivors are swarming the hook
---
Well at least you probably weren't getting away from that regardless.
---
this was some dedication
---
"I think we did a pretty good job so far."
---
Well do u know their chart of what is currently important? Would delaying a update not piss the community off just as much? Bc I can put money on the fact if BHVR said "we have delayed this chapter to fix some bugs" people wouldn't give a single shit and rave about how BHVR can only make bugs.
---
I just see it as damned if you do damned if you don't when it comes to this
---
Lol , that‚Äôs cute bill cosmetic
---
‚ÄúProceeds to sprint burst into a wall‚Äù
---
You do realize the timer doesn‚Äôt go down while sprinting. Like no matter when you‚Äôre sprinting in or out of chase as long as you‚Äôre sprinting it won‚Äôt go down then it pauses while mending so it pretty much shouldn‚Äôt exist anymore.
---
If 3 of you made it to end game and nobody got out, that sounds like a coordination problem.
---
ü§£
---
Problem for that would be there is no AI pathing that I'm aware of, so a whole new system would need to be developed. If a change like this takes place expect:
---
It to be in place of the next killer
---
Plenty of bugs when it is released
---
And possibly even being poorly implemented or straight up unbalanced 
---
Not to mention there would need to be new addons and their balancing!
---
Dont get me wrong, I would love this! But it would take a TON of work from a development standpoint, so dont expect it anytime soon :(
---
Blood orbs and blood pools are not the same and if it did worked like that the oni would be powerless against 4 no mither
---
Your poor emblems though
---
Disconnecting Shitshow
---
I only see 4 or 5 posted in the last month. How is that 'so much'?

[When you buy DG for the mask and BHVR gives it out for free a few months later](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/031/003/cover3.jpg)
---
Problem for that power would be there is no AI pathing that I'm aware of, so a whole new system would need to be developed. If a change like this takes place, expect:
---
They seriously have to push back the dc punishment
---
Don‚Äôt forget that if you get a game breaking bug a few times in a row and D/C you‚Äôll get timed out now too. A+ BHVR keep it up.
---
Yeah, I also find killer's Presence to be quite Unnerving.
---
Haha, because UNNERVING PRESENCE
---
I will stop typing now.
---
Playing around both interrupts gameplay and just isn't fun
---
For ruin it just staight up sucks missing a skillcheck and being punished
---
If they made ruin "Gens are 30% slower" but got rid of that red bar I'd be ok with it
---
As for DS being forced to treat everyone as if they have it or after you hook a couple guys who made a bad play the third guy gets pulled out of a locker with 3 seconds left on his DS and it's just annoying
---
40+-
---
Well fuck
---
have you even played this game? survivors are way more powerful at the higher ranks.
---
yeah, if u don‚Äôt get a teachable in the first web it shows up, it will show up in the next ones. I think that‚Äôs what u asked anyway.
---
It's called ahegao and it's cultural tradition
---
That just looks rage inducing smh
---
This guy gets it.
---
Something similar happened just now for me, I threw a pallet down and got hit through it and the o I teleported a few feet away from the pallet after he hit me
---
#BONK
---
It‚Äôs muted tho
---
Mods need to start deleting this kinds of post in less than 2 minutes, because people dont take half a second to see the  reddit and realizing there are alredy 20 people posting the same thing over and over again (happened with the tome 4 bug, now this and will happen some other tine with another thing)
---
I want to show some clown love. The longest break I took from DbD was the 3 months when Clown came out. I did not like him at all. I tried him again way down the line and fell in love with him. He‚Äôs one of my favorite killers now.
---
He is not great by any means. However you will
---
Have very satisfying games when you get good with him because you have to work hard for the wins. It feels really good when you‚Äôre doing great with him because he has no map pressure whatsoever.
---
I too played Dead By Daylight in 2016 and 2017 until July where hooks were made to respawn due to the overall abuse of the perk Saboteur causing killers immense stress when playing against it. However, the perk Iron Grasp which increases wiggle time has since been nerfed from 60% wiggle speed reduction, to 36% and finally to 12%, a meager amount of its original dominance in the meta.
---
I turned my laptop's brightness to max and still could hardly see a thing . My mouse is also broken and the clicking doesn't work half the time. The two combined make for a seriously frustrating experience :(
---
üëåüëã toodles.
---
Monto got banned for exploiting a bug that allowed you to go on top of a generator in the Ironworks of misery where the killer could not reach.
---
Legion was clearly made the resemble the antagonists from The Purge lol. I don't think Ghostface had anything to do with their designs.
---
I heard the music, looked around, nothing. All the sudden I see the Oni coming at me at 100 mph. Loop him. He uses the wall glide trick and downs me.
---
The add-ons aren't trash though. They apply broken on first hit with the power. And they still work with Thanatophobia and Dying Light. I just went against a Legion that had this at red rank and I barely escaped and everyone else died. So yeah, I think people are overreacting to this "nerf".
---
Ohhh wow, guess the devs aren‚Äôt a fan of him rippp
---
Lucky, 75% of my games have been him and I'm so sick of it
---
I think it is more likely they understood that it was sarcasm, but didn't find it funny. If it was a replay to someone complaining about OP playing spirit, it would have made a lot more sense, but as it is it just feels really out of place
---
If you hook someone in the basement... well.. reality itself falls apart (or smth close to that). They glitch through the ground, see nothing but white/blue-ish and the very tip of the head of their character. You have no prompt to to try to unhook yourself, and the issue isn't even resolved when you get unhooked you still see nothing, only if you get hooked again its resolved and you see normal again.
---
I love the idea! If this happens I will get legion 300%
---
Just make it to endgame and just farm them with BT, done. Shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few games
---
The locker mechanics wouldn't require much AI. The Legion would just "teleport" inside of them, and leave after attacking a Survivor.
---
That's fair, I can totally see your point!
---
Same!
---
The best exhaustion perk available right now is probably Adrenaline from Meg but it only activates when the end-game starts, eg hatch closed or 5 generators repaired.
---
I agree with the disappointment. However, there's only one meaningful way to voice players' dissatisfaction so that would force Devs to take action to fix what's needed. That way is to stop giving them money until issues are solved. And guess what many players have been and will be doing in the past and next days? Yep, buying the DLC and the new cosmetics.
---
As long as the money goes in, the Devs will be in no rush.
---
That's not stupid, you can't do anything against that
---
We all know that if the whole Nemesis thing went live people would've immediately cried about Toxic Legion again.
---
 BHVR employee detected!
---
What about the event cosmetics?
---
Yeah usually when a new killer shows up that's all I see, but not this time. Which is a shame because Oni is so cool
---
If my mic werent muted, you wouldve heard my "wtf"
---
Ah this been happening to me so much
---
‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you camp??!1!1?1!‚Äù
---
dude my mom texted me and I‚Äôm eating in &amp; out, just let me have a bite dang
---
60 seconds is long enough to purposefully *not* tunnel you, only to get punished for ending a chase against you fast after a different one
---
Idk,after hitting rank1 solo surv for the 37th month in a row it honestly doesnt feel bad, you just need to learn how to play for yourself over your team.
---
Btw, someone, who looks nothing like main protagonist of the Halloween movie, has green eyes
---
90% of matches I play the ruin is never found (as survivor or killer)
---
It really do b like that doe
---
Oroboro
---
i don‚Äôt believe it
---
Because lets nerf legion even more instead of reworking him
---
It runs in the family
---
Wait, what? How does this work? Survivors are the ones who decide pretty much everything in the game. Victory is literally in our collective hands. 
---
It just sucks when some of those hands belong to potatoes that think generators are fun decoration to avoid.
---
Shhh, don't blow my cover!
---
What about them?
---
I would add something like : "everytime someone dies, 1 memebr leaves"
---
Zubat is the most underrated dbd player to exist

never throw pallets when big man bubba reving up the chainsaw
---
The reason I don't think they've touched those is because they'd need to design several new cosmetics every month which would be a lot of side-tracking
---
Laurie got tired of being slugged cuz of her d-strike stereotype, and thus she ascended
---
Event cosmetics have been released in the time for everyone.  
---
Which means, if they do it once ,they'll do it twice.  
---
Now they released exclusives, despite saying they wouldn't.  
---
What's next? Battle pass items, event items, legacy. I called it here.  
---
Also, keep giving me those spicy down votes,  I don't need an e-peen to prove my point with karma points.
---
so it's a p2w skin, I'm considering buy it over the others. xD
---
You were trying to cross the border, right??
---
Oh? The only issue I've encountered is the basement bug
---
Oh i see. Wouldn't have thougt of this. Maybe it's in the next rift :P
---
I cannot count how many times so far I've evaded a blood furying Oni because it seems like after 3 mins of being looped around they go it to a tunnel visioned rage once they get their power, it's ducking terrifying
---
For me it's just been toxic.
---
5 gens is done is 95% of the survivor's objective, opening the gate is just the last push. That's kinda like saying killers didn't complete all their objectives because 1 person died on second hook, technically killer didn't get 12 hooks, so his 4k is illegitimate. 
---
The doors were not far away enough, he only had to move a few steps because there was a tree in the way, otherwise, he could have stood still and just waited. 
---
Furthermore, he's a killer with a one-shot ability, high chase potential, and its endgame so most pallets are gone. I tried to take the chase but ended up vaulting a locker instead of a window, which is unlucky and nobody's fault, but I doubt I would have lasted that long anyway. 
---
I don't think the doors should be on opposite sides of the map, but they should not be on the same wall, and killers shouldn't be able to move a few feet to see both of them.
---
I never said the bug isn't game breaking. What I said was it probably isn't an easy fix, and that's why it's going to take time. By all means, yes, criticize them for letting that bug slip through in the first place. But you can't demand that the fix comes out tomorrow if you don't know how complicated the fix is.
---
I mean, majority of survs already have ds and adrenaline. So this wont change much.
---
I wouldn't call him bad, he's likely mid-tier, but it's the effort required to get the ball rolling that's the problem. Oni literally doesn't have a power when the game starts. I don't see why I'd pick him over Hillbilly, except for the built in tracking for injured survivors I guess (which is pretty decent but Nurse's exists).
---
I always run prayer bead Oni.
---
Played for about 7 hours on pc yesterday (I have no life, I know.) In red ranks, only got 1 oni and the new map twice during all that. And of course the one oni I get is yellow ranks, so the match was hardly even fun. He seems like a worse version of hillbilly to me, but I'll hold my judgment until people start learning him more.
---
The same one as everyone else. You must‚Äôve been on a different one
---
Hey ah friend, there is heaps and heaps of fan art and a bunch of other copyrighted stuff on this subreddit, I think your fine mate
---
Yes if you miss it or hit it it‚Äôs all used up
---
One person killed themselves on hook after trying for the gate just after we popped the gen on the other side of the map. That was what fucked us over alot, if we still had her, we might have been able to do something. Unfortunately, she was also hooked smack in the middle of the two gates, where he was standing, so it wouldn't have been an easy unhook. He was camping her and the gates, and she wanted out quickly.
---
Die hard
---
Was assuming a point in time before they worked together. You could have picked him up/show yourself. At this time he probably wasn't an asshole and also didn't work with the killer.
---
Are we already back on that? Stats say otherwise.
---
Survivors get shit on at all levels of the game and they have the stats to show it.
---
Weird, I'm on Xbox and all I've been getting are stealth killers. At which point, I've just been running Spine Chill every game.
---
...Oooo, does this mean we could get default Susie and Joey cosmetics? Maybe Susie would have the same mask as Frank but cracked and hastily sewn back together.
---
Yea
---
He looks like a nice fellow.
---
He looks like the kind of guy I could trust talking about my problems to and would give nice hugs to make me feel better.
---
What did they do about the overall abuse that is called camping ? Killer get stressed when unable to hook people, survivors get stressed when theu are unable to get hooked. 
---
Hope survivor stress will be relevant enough for them... one day.
---
Oni is another example of the large gap between console and PC. It‚Äôs unfortunate. But yeah I think your idea would make him more playable on console
---
Nice Killer Mains: well shit guess I better not hook in the basement
---
Mean Killer Mains: sounds like its time to do a basement build
---
I was referring to how we've been asking for rank rewards since the RELEASE 3¬Ω years ago.
---
Both Yamaoka maps are broken. They need to fix that shit ASAP
---
Jeff is that guy though, his lore made him my favourite survivor like he may look really tough and mean but he‚Äôs just a sweetheart I love Jeff with all my heart
---
Unlike Saboteur before the hook respawn, camping doesnt make the entire map apart from one sing area a deadzone for them to be in.
---
Yeah, I feel ya dude. Some of these challenges requires a decent team who can do gens. I either have matches where we get nowhere close to EGC, or the Killer happens to rage quit sometimes. And to add long survivor ques... The killer ones atleast I can do since I get games quick.
---
Also, it's poor game design if one survivor has to sacrifice themselves so the other can try to open the gate. We were both on first hook, and died on first hook.
---
Could someone create Telegram stickers out of this?
---
Ohhhh, that's how the bug happens? I was confused on why I kept getting called a bug abuser after hooking people in the basement, hearing them get saved, and then seeing them do fuck all for the rest of the match
---
Probably because those with cosmetics in game, played the game from the very beggining
---
STRAIGHT DOWN TO HELL AND INTO Z TIER BOIS LET'S GOOOOO
---
True true
---
Will do my best to make friends lolz
---
Except those stats shown are irrelevent. Kills do not equal wins. With the current emblem system, even the developer ideal of two kills two escapes a killer can only safety pip. Hell they could even de-pip on that. Under the current emblem system, in which a pip is considered a win- no killers do not thrash at every level. Survivors run circles around them faster the higher you go.
---
I am a bit confused on their family is Kazan like the Rins uncle or something?  They aren't brother and sister since in Rins lore it says that she was the only child.
---
The gates will never be fair. Ever. Putting them at opposite ends of the map would be unfair for almost every killer the same way really close gates are unfair to survivors.
---
I don't understand, as a software developer, how things that are completely unrelated to changes that were made get totally fucked up in updates.
---
This is advanced spaghetti code. I mean...really what the fucks goin on here? Medkit addons all of a sudden don't work? How the fucks that become a problem lmao. That should be isolated code that is untouched, and if it is touched, there should be simple unit tests to determine that when you add 12 charges to a medkit or something, it really does add the 12 charges.

Only BHVR is making science out of simple f'n servers.
---
As a killer main I'd be okay with this temporarily
---
So they did what your perk did before, but your perk did it better. You always used thana anyways, so I don't know why you're bringing it up again and again. Broken for 60 secs when most people don't heal anyways is really not good.
---
Sounds like one survivor decided to sacrifice themselves, not that they had to.
---
It‚Äôs been awhile since I played is this a new killer?
---
Kazan is the second decendant in the Yamaoka lineage, Rin being the last. But there are *many* years separating both of them.
---
But you son't have to use it the first time.  If you press nothing the first time you get picked up you can still use it next time.
---
What basement bug?
---
What? How is that relevant at all? PC players didn‚Äôt have nearly the same level of issues console players are currently having. It isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpractice and get good‚Äù situation - it‚Äôs a hardware limitation situation. The way Oni plays does not in any way work with the frame rate consoles have and analog sticks
---
Hey, thanks! I did my best using my shitty phone apps. If I had a computer to use, it would have looked waaaaaay better IMO, but unfortunately that's not the case. Glad you enjoyed it!
---
Not to mention they've added perks like adrenaline/decisive strike as well as make killers lose points when they are too close to hooked survivors. It's not perfect, but no reason to act like NOTHING has been done.
---
Hey, Thanks! I did my best using my shitty phone apps, but I don't have a computer to use with it. Glad you enjoyed it!
---
I didn't know the basement was bugged...  And I've been playing basement trapper...
---
"hardware limitation"? you mean behauvoirs incapability to enhance a game for consoles that run rdr2 in 4k.
---
I had a spirit do this for like a solid two minutes! I wanted to post the video but I‚Äôm not sure how to get it on my phone from my playstation
---
Oh, nice
---
TBH, the killer from an 'US' chapter should be themed like Legion and be multiple characters in a single killer. But in this case, each current survivor available should have their own doppelganger as a skin for this killer. Oh, imagine hunting down baby Dwights as a Dwight armed with a golden pair of scissors.

Adrenaline was added at the start of the games life (and honestly sucked at first) and DS was added 8 months before hooks were changed
---
Feng mains unite
---
wait, they removed the combo? what the fuck devs. why do you hate legion so much? and pig, for that matter? honestly. i feel like they're just doing lottery on who they're going to buff and nerf, and pig and legion just have shit luck.

For some reason r/deadbydaylight doesn't allow crosspost, so I had to download it and post, but that guy deserve the credits
---
I had survivors message me mad that I was abusing the bug, but I had no clue what they were talking about. Apparently, one of the people I hooked got the glitch, but I didnt know about this bug at the time so I assumed they had given up and just left them in the basement for the rest of the game to go kill the others. Eventually everyone managed to get hooked in the basement and they're wandering around like a blind puppy at a waterpark, I was so confused until I read about the bug
---
Mmm no, it's stupid. Say what you want but the negative votes on the post show how stupid it is.

I feel like that's why I'm there. 'I will be the one to die for you'

Calm ur titties, It was a joke.

I'm not saying they were introduced after hooks were changed. I'm saying they are viable(ish) anti-camping perks.
---
Underrated comment right here, I just laughed so hard üòÇ

I feel this so hard. Been tunneled so much I had to put on ds cause it‚Äôs been super frustrating.
---
Frank did a big brain
---
That's why hes called "noob3", he was banned two times
---
Im currently stuck in a loop of error messanges. So frustrating
---
Thanks!
---
Lots of killers are pretending not to know just to autowin rounds.
---
Yea i got a group of ashes breaking my hook only one survived and it wasn‚Äôt an ash
---
*deadhard
---
It's just for the archives challenge, i swear!
---
Adrenaline at first was defo not an anti-camping perk since it would activate even if you were carried or hooked making it useless.
---
aye. useless. that's how he's meant to work. with nemesis this was shortly not the case, but they decided to give him the pig treatment and nerf him repeatedly for literally no reason.
---
Isn't the entity's relm already the shadow relm
---
Imagine getting Mr. Voorhees, but instead of Jason he's fucking father
---
yea they didn't have to, but they didn't want to be camped. Regardless, two survivors still made it to the exit gates and it wasn't possible to open them without one survivor having to take the L.
---
Nerf an entire mechanic to fix a problem with at most like 5 interactions, for it is the Behaviour way. Couldn't have made Deep Wounds range based instead of Terror Radius based, or couldn't have made Freddy *have* a "terror radius" against people who are asleep? Nope gotta change the entire Deep Wounds mechanic and cuck Legion even harder!
---
It's the same reason why Thanataphobia and Blood Echoes are so bad: they *could* be good but Legion and Plague exist, and would "exploit" them if they were too good. So instead of fixing Plague and Legion (example: make Survivors at max infection against Plague Exposed instead of Broken) they just gut the perks entirely so instead of two Killers abusing these perks no one uses them in general.
---
I think you‚Äôre all underestimating how hard it is to find bugs. Like, basement isn‚Äôt even related to new content, so they probably weren‚Äôt expecting it. I know it‚Äôs frustrating, but for game breaking bugs like this, I feel BHVR does a pretty good job fixing them fast.
---
Come on man, it's supposed to be a joke meme. Lighten up a little.
---
Yep, I only play killer to get the tome done, so I'm still only rank 15 but get matched with green and purple ranks. As a survivor I float around rank 4-6 and get matched with greens and browns. My life being shit as killer wouldn't be so bad if I got matched with survivors my own rank but I don't. I get matched with survivors that die after 2 minutes and 1 gen done. I don't bother using 'endgame' perks cause I rarely ever even see midgame.
---
Just Google ocd..
---
you monster ü§£

Oh, right you use urban evasion.

Tbh survs are like "hey it's not like you are runnig for your life, slow down buddy"

Even on pc you can run him around thin short structures where you can quickly turn 180 degrees.
---
Someone in my game had this. I was destroying this team of chirstmas billy boyz because they were lower ranks so I decided to start a farm party n left one person in the basement  to save who ever I hooked down their. I thought he understood my message because he was just tea bagging and circling around. One hook n one d.c later the poor bill is colliding with all walls possible down their. I thought someone had just handed their controller over to their 2 year old.
---
They just don't care about console anymore
---
Perfect use. +rep
---
See, while that's true, his issue is more so a lack of map pressure then ability in chase, or anything else. a well timed shock can stop vaults or drops. legion doesn't have any use at all in their ability besides activating thanatophobia. wew. yay. good.
---
Is it me or is Plague a killer that there is a large gap between console and PC? I say this as she literally kills your frames when you try to perform.actions while sick, I faced 2 different plagues twice in a row and whenever I went on a gen or started the cleanse action my frames went from like 30 to what felt like 5.
---
4 survivors 1 killer u got my point now ? 4head and tho i wait for killer lobby like 5 minutes.
---
doesn't seem unpopular to me. it's just dev's being dumbasses who don't know how to balance things.
---
Oh man, I remember that. Killers would dodge jakes with toolboxes instead of P3 clauds with flashlights...
---
It was possible, y'all just messed up. It happens.
---
Now I'm not saying the gates are perfectly balanced, but they csnt really do anything to them without making it either impossible to defend them both or harder to open.
---
I feel there are better areas they could put their time that can actually be balanced.
---
I think the survivors should be more afraid considering rancor is in the shrine
---
If free mori state boys!
---
That actually sounds like a cool idea
---
Or we keep posting about it until they fucking fix it.  Make them know we are dissatisfied with their shitshow of a "QA" department.
---
Yeah thanks, I know what it is. Doesn't change anything though. Post is still stupid.
---
It was to counter Nemesis.. no-one wants launch Legion again.. she/he will be reworked properly soon anyway.
---
If you get picked up and hooked in the basement again you'll become blinded again. Best part is you can't even suicide on second hook (for some unknown reason) so you're forced to just go make a cup of coffee while the game [Breakdown Breakdown.](https://youtu.be/1184_mAdDWU)
---
Need to be injured for dead hard ;) if your exposed it doesn‚Äôt make a difference :)
---
Every Oni I faced sucked with his Blood Fury and just use the blood orbs to track/tunnel the person he injured only to finally face camp them in end game because it was barely his 1st or 2nd hook.
---
I haven't played as him yet, but I suspect he is ass to control on console.
---
A dead rising fan
---
got called a camper when i knew their teammate was coming back to farm them, i just wanted to kill your killer
---
I feel like I get tunneled ANY time I play Adam Francis just because of deliverance and I almost never use it
---
No, because picking him up was a trap. And picking him up would‚Äôve just killed us both. No point in that
---
A pretty shit one
---
Ruin is really annoying, i will never cease to repeat that the game need an automatic balance system, if generators are repaired too fast the system slow them down.

During my survivor matches, I'm working on a generator outside of the TR, next thing you know I hear The Oni's scream and then like 7 seconds later, the faintest Claudette scream. I was laughing for a good minute

I made a bad meme out of this sorry

Ah because the streamers said so, got it.

are you trying to get me to respond with one word because it‚Äôs not gonna work lol

Yeah I know what it is, thanks. Doesn't change anything though. The post is still stupid.

The fels. That hit my soul. As a surviver use the charekters 3 perks and brng key for 100% achivement first try

Killer. Shit they got 2+ iq

I had a match against a Rank 10 Trapper when everyone in my lobby was around Rank 3 or 2. ~~6 Rank difference max btw.~~ Guy gets a 4k against a bunch of red rank players.
---
Was it because he did well? Lol no not a single person got trapped that game. It's just because two people got "moried" because he naively put us in the basement like any Killer would if they were near the basement.
---
He asked us why we weren't moving after we got unhooked and we told him the game broke. He apologized and said he genuinely didn't know. That's great and all but I'm still miffed that I brought an Escape Cake and a good medkit to try to do my Escape the Trail rift only to get cucked by Behaviour's glorious programming skills.

Btw the clip is from a youtuber named FripFlop, he is an underrated DbD youtuber who makes funny videos. Check him out if you have the chance.

but this is to be expected.   i'll see  how it goes as i use him more, but i played that dark ass new map twice so that didnt help either.

the 3rd one was freaking haddonfield.   i was able to keep them at bay when it was down to 1 gen left for them.

Demi for console, oni for pc
---
Accurate
---
I had this problem since forever, this ist so f*cking annoying, the moment when you normally get faster is now the moment when you lose the survivor
---
I'm surprised there hasn't been more mention of killers getting stuck after kicking gens. Happened to me two games in a row.
---
More like, ‚ÄúYour older brother beating a slightly harder enemy then you and proceeds to hog the controller until he beats the round or game‚Äù.
---
I dont really see that would be necessary,  i think that maybe to make any Toolbox only usable if you are the only one on the gen,  that way ,it will still be viable,  the toolbox genrushing dissapears,  and makes everything, more balanced in some way , the gens wont pop up in like  3 seconds,  but it will still be faster.
---
Now it‚Äôs time for red ranks lmao
---
Revork ruind. And fix gens and toolboxses
---
"Pretty good job so far" or alternatively Each side get ultra angery over Vidya game.
---
Seems like you got the smac
---
I've never had issues while sick. I have had issues with Doc tho as far as frames are concerned
---
youre playin spirit, go away.
---
They should spawn on opposite sides like in Lerys or The Game map.
---
Well, that‚Äôs pretty stupid. How would I know if other survivors are actually near my rank ? Having low ranks on my team isn‚Äôt very fun
---
Bugs happen. But it depends on the devs, engine, coding and basically everything that comes with a game. I've played games as Uncharted 4 and Rocket League. In Uncharted I haven't seen a single bug in the story the first time I played it. In the multiplayer I think I can count all the bugs I've seen on one hand (and I've played it a lot). In Rocket League I don't think I've ever seen a bug tbh, while Psyonix is/was a small dev team aswell.
---
I unfortunately can't agree with that. The devs said it will probably take them 2 weeks to fix the basement bug. This bug makes this game literally unplayable, which means I won't play this game for the coming 2 weeks. That's a scandal if you ask me.
---
 \+1 this problem  
---
I stuck in 3 games at generator ( 2 with legion , 1 with hag)  
---
White screen bug after get hit by oni rage ( happen last night)  
---
Basement also bug like meme post above  
---
Medkit bug too
---
Especially with Agitation/Monstrous Shrine based Archives challenges, this is pretty bad timing for this kind of glitch.
---
Now I feel bad knowing this was a wide spread bug. I hooked a ton of survivors in the basement last night in my killer games. I would have totally avoided it if I had known.
---
I'd love to see this in action
---
I do fall asleep sometimes but because I'm tired, and him playing relaxes me
---
Don‚Äôt clog the sub
---
I was sure I responded to this yesterday, but apparently not.
---
Yes, this, thank you.
---
Those ideas would be good, but hell, even just making a separate queue for SWF and giving killers a toggle option as to whether or not they want to play against those groups would be fine.
---
I played last night for a few hours and not one oni. Lots of trappers tho! Seemed like trapper was the new killer lol. I dont even know what his power exactly does and have no clue about this music
---
They did, they are giving everyone who earned them back once they figure out who had them originally, the loss of progress they said was a big however they intended to give back the stuff Event items included to everyone once the DLC dropped, however people complained that they earned them and they wanted to make the Earnable Event items Exclusive to those who already had them, hence why they need the system to check who DID have them to give them out again, 
---
TL;DR: Community delayed the return of everyone's stuff. But you'll get it back
---
BHVR basically needs to disable basement hooks until this gets fixed, this is probably the absolute most game breaking bug I've ever seen in any patch for any game I've played in the past decade or so.
---
At this point we have people running IG and Agitation on killers that really have no business running it just to abuse this bug. I ran into a Spirit that literally only hooked people in the basement on the new map to glitch people out and get easy wins.
---
He's out since at least yesterday I think.
---
\+1 this meme  
---
i do this challenge after the update anyway
---
It punishes splitting up.
---
Ahh yes, i to enjoy shock theocracy. 
---
Jokes aside, yes that seems to be the case.
---
Bad and naughty clowns get put in time out
---
This is honestly why I don't like console.Prices are higher than PC on usual,and even then you have to pay again to just be even able to PLAY the damn game.
---
Compare it to PC:
---
1.Install steam
---
2.Buy and download
---
3.Done!
---
Also they keep messing with the lighting and sound in a game where hiding and seeking is a major mechanic. This patch, the graphics got so dark for some reason I'm watching survivors keep trying to vault closed windows.
---
Do the devs even check this sub that much? Just spam it on the forums
---
Don't associate this weeb shit with my dweet
---
They need to find another survivor if they want to evade the debuff.
---
HOW TF IS IT THAT IF YOURE DOING A SOLO FUCKING SURVIVOR GAME THAT YOU GET SACRIFCED BY OTHER FUCKING PLAYER! I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE KILLER TAKE MERCY ON ME BECAUSE MY OWN FUCKING SURVIVOR TEAM DECIDES THEY WANNA BE FUCKING WHORES AND JUST TROLL WHILE I DO ALL THE FUCKING GENS. THESE LITTLE SHITS CANT EVEN FIND THE HEX RUIN TOTEM WHILE I EITHER GET CHASED FOR TEN MINUTES OR FINISH THREE GENS. PLAY THE FUCKING GAME STOP FUCKING TROLLING
---
Why No Mither constantly giving Oni blood orbs if you dont bleed? It should not be so...
---
Uh oh
---
i have no problems with this, but BHVR said they want to avoid killers who blend in with survivors, or can be able to charge survivors without them knowing until its to late
---
As jake main. I will say"kinky killer" ;)
---
How?
---
oh cool i havent been keeping up since early October
---
Why not utilize the forum instead, as that's monitored and controlled by BHVR themselves, including a section for these issues.
---
Clogging up this sub doesn't help get this issue resolved.
---
That‚Äôs not a killer that‚Äôs a moth
---
Trust me. He wasn't lol. Console players like that seriously have that kind of mindset.
---
You focused on the wrong point of my explanation.  It's not the giving survivors a chance to win that's important, it's the fact that having a hatch makes the endgame less of a drawn out agonizing waste of time.
---
This is the whole reason the final countdown got added, as well.  It's to ensure that the game doesn't just turn into a boring fucking slog for both of the last-standing players while they stealth around each other all night long.
---
same with Fired Up
---
My DbD name is a Jasmine Masters reference and my best pre-game chats are when people get it and we just spam the chat with drag race talk
---
I'M GLAD I COULD TALK TO THE DEVS AND SORT THIS SHIT OUT BUT MOTHERFUCKER, IF YOU GAMESHARE TO SOMEONE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY THEY CAN'T BUY CELLS ON THEIR GAME AND THEIR MONEY GETS FUCKING EATEN. I WENT AND SPENT $86 (THAT I WANTED TO SPEND ON THEM GLADY) SO THEY COULD GET THE GAME, CELLS AND SOME DLC'S THAT THEY COULD'VE OTHERWISE GOT WITH THE CELLS IF THIS SHIT WASN'T DUMB. IN ADDITION US PSN HAD A FUCKING SALE TO MAKE DBD HALF OF WHAT I HAD TO PAY FOR ME, BUT NOPE NO SALE IN THE COUNTRY I BOUGHT THE GAME FOR MY FRIEND. THIS WHOLE THING COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED WITH SOME SHIT THAT LETS OTHER COUNTRIES BUY CELLS TOO BUT NOPE, HAS TO BE IN THE SAME CURRENCY AS THAT COUNTRY.
---
So now is Yui a mix of: Meg, Kate and Feng?
---
FORGET FREAKING KILLERS DISCONNECTING!!!!  I WAS HALFWAY THROUGH A MATCH AND THE KILLER DECIDED TO QUIT BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T END A CHASE TO SAVE HER LIFE.  I ENDED UP NOT ONLY GAINING NO BLOODPOINTS OR CHALLENGE PROGRESS FOR THE THREE GENS I HAD COMPLETED, BUT ALSO LOST MY DECKED OUT TOOLBOX AND ESCAPE CAKE!!
---
HOW IS THIS STILL FREAKING HAPPENING BHVR!?!!
---
Yes you are, learn to play asshole. If you‚Äôre not on mars while someones on hook thats camping.
---
Also a bug where you can't wiggle
---
WHY THE FUCK CAN'T BHVR FUCKING DO A NORMAL FUCKING REWORK FOR LEGION.
---
THEY LEGIT JUST FUCKING NERFED THEM AGAIN FOR A GOD KNOWS WHAT REASON.
---
I'M JUST FUCKING FED UP OF HAVING MY MAIN GETTING NERFED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
---
GET YOUR SHIT STRAIGHT BHVR AND STOP GIVING THEM THESE "FIXES" OR HOW THE FUCK YOU CALL THEM
---
It has like an under water effect to it with legion
---
&gt;even the developer ideal of two kills two escapes a killer can only safety pip.
---
Why should they pip when they tie? Two kills is considered a tie, 3 killers is considered a win.
---
But that's not even the point. Kills are the killer's objective, surviving is the survivors objective. If you abide by some arbitrary system that BHVR put in place for you than you're a fucking idiot. Everyone plays the game for those two purposes and if you happen to pip than great.
---
But let's go with your idea of "winning". I don't think you realize how fucking hard it is, no, how fucking impossible it is to rank up as survivor without SWF.
---
Do killers even understand what it takes to pip as a survivor at red ranks? It's fucking impossible unless you coordinate it with a SWF. You need 13 points, aka 2 iridescent, a gold, and a silver, or 2 iridescent, gold, and bronze. Anything less is safety pip.
---
To get iridescent lightbringer you need 270 points. That's 2.7 gens. That's not reasonable. Let's say you get 2 gens. You need 70 more points. Let's say 5 gens pop, that's 25 more points you need 45 more. You either need a hex totem, or you need to cleanse multiple dull totems + gate. Iridescent lightbringer is outrageously difficult.
---
So 2 gens solo, all 5 gens pop, 2+ dull totems, and exit gate powered, just to get 1/3rd of the requirements to pip.
---
But the real difficulty of it lies in the fact that in order to get iridescent for other categories other than Unbroken, you need to basically be doing things that don't progress Lightbringer at all.
---
Let's look at Unbroken. You will not get iridescent for this at red ranks. Ever. I've never had a red rank game where I didn't get hooked or downed. So instantly this is gold already. This one is ridiculous too. The only way to achieve gold for this is by surviving along with the game lasting more than 9 minutes. That is unlikely. I'd say even on games where I do exceedingly well, I often get silver here. But even if you do survive, which is very unlikely, you just get gold here. So now you need 1 more iridescent, or two more golds(1 iridescent and 3 golds is essentially impossible due to how the requirements are set up). So realistically you need one iridescent.
---
Remember, the next two categories are essentially conflicting with Lightbringer.
---
So Benevolent in my opinion is the easiest to get iridescent in. The problem is, if you get iridescent in benevolent, unless your teammates are straight potatoes, you're not getting iridescent in anything else. The only realistic way to achieve this is through unhooks, in which you need 4 of them. You can farm protection hits as well, but that usually just fucks you over in the long run. Let's say you get 4 unhooks to do this. Think of the time that it takes to achieve this. You have to get off the gen you were on, get close to the hook, wait until the killer is definitely out of the area, unhook them, and then get back to the gen. You're looking at a minute at least. If you get iridescent here that's 4 minutes of time *not* doing gens, and other survivors doing gens. That's 3 gens worth of time right there. Realistically in non SWF what happens is everyone goes for unhooks so you all waste time though so you still have somewhat of a chance at Lightbringer.
---
And lastly, Evader, which is what will fuck you over every time. It's basically impossible to get gold+ for this in red ranks. Even if you have a good chase where you loop quite a bit, if you don't escape than it's not gonna get you where you need to be. I've had games where I have literally farmed an AFK killer and didn't get gold. You need 880 points for iridescent. You get 6 points a second for being within 5 meters of the killer. That's insane and will never happen, but let's say you did. You still need to be near the killer for over 2 minutes just to get iridescent. Let's say you loop the killer for a minute. It's usually going to be .6 points per second here, and they are banked every 15 seconds. That's 36 points. Oh wait, you lost the chase because that's how looping works typically the end game is just to waste time. So that's -10 points right there. So for a 1 minute loop you get 26 points towards the necessary 780. Let's say you loop the killer 3 times for a total of 5 minutes, super generous. Let's say you escape every time. Super generous. That is only 360 points towards the necessary 780. So for gold you would have to be *very* close to the killer for a little over 30 seconds more on top of that, for iridescent you're looking at minutes more.
---
So what have we established? If you get iridescent in Lightbringer, you've greatly reduced chances of iridescent in Benevolent and gold(iridescent is impossible almost) in Evader. And this all loops around, if you spent most of your game doing Evader tasks, your Lightbringer and Benevolent tasks are greatly inhibited. If you spend your time being benevolent, healing and unhooking, other survivors are getting in chases and doing gens and you hurt those chances greatly.
---
The only way to pip in red ranks is to specifically farm it with SWF, or to get potato teammates, but not *too* potato, so they give you enough time to do some gens as well, and hopefully you get some really good chases somewhere in there.
---
So don't you fuckin come at me with this wah wah bullshit it's hard to pip. The scenario in non SWF that is required to actually pip in red ranks is absurd. You need bad teammate essentially so that you can save them, and still have time to do some gens. But because they're bad teammates, you're not going to escape, so you're going to get silver in Unbroken. And if you actually manage to iridescent in both Benevolent and Lightbringer(still outrageously unlikely), than you probably won't get the necessary points for gold Evader and won't pip. Imagine doing 2.7 gens worth of a game, and unhooking 4+ survivors, and not getting a pip. What the fuck else can you honestly be expected to do?
---
every killer has the same pallet breaking speed the same survivor pick up speed and the same vault speed \*not counting with perks or power\*
---
She even looked up
---
Ugh I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm lumped in with a shithead like him
---
yeah probably but i don't know for sure. don't forget that dbd is bhvr's biggest thing yet, they had other games that weren't near as "successful" as dbd (eg. deathgarden ((rip))
---
this year (all bugs aside) was, imo, pretty huge for dbd: stranger things chapter, firsts cosmetics for pig, tapp, laurie, myers. bill. this new chapter is also really big, brings a lot of content (too sad that it also brought like 15 new bugs lmao)
---
i think that dbd still has a lot to offer and if it eventually dies it will take a few years from now (like 3-4 i guess)
---
It's not even active until tomorrow.
---
The claudette is in the backround, she just used waning bell
---
Legion got the same treatment as balanced lancing on Haddonfield. Instead of reworking the killer and the map, they made the mending timer useless (with his addons too) and took the secondary effect of balanced out instead of reworking both Legion and Haddonfield, they're doing big mistakes.
---
&gt; I cant see peoples levels
---
This one was a bug according to the devs. It's in the patch notes in the Miscellaneous section under Bug Fixes.
---
A man of culture!
---
i never run in the right direction
---
I actually still think hes at least mid tier on console. I only played a couple matches with him, but I got adept oni on my first try lmao. He's much easier than nurse on console imo
---
Is ds still good? Its in shrine this week.
---
Listen, I know you want to feel special posting something already posted no less than 20 times (maybe its because you want to be a part of it too, because you dont want to see literally the first 2 latest posts or because you dont care and you rather fill the reddit with more post knowing that no dev is going to see it and you only annoy the people who watch the reddit), but stop it already
---
This has been a repost on this sub since I joined

MY SECOND GAME AS ONI I GOT MERCILESS WITH ONLY HIS THREE PERKS, BUT THE ACHIEVEMENTS WEREN'T EVEN ON XBOX AT THE TIME SO IT DIDN'T COUNT. THEN I TRIED FOR ABOUT SIX HOURS TO GET IT AGAIN AND I GOT NOTHING BUT RUTHLESS, EVEN HAD TWO PERFECT GAMES AND STILL ONLY RUTHLESS. GAH!

It didn't happen to me. Is it a PC issue only?

The map is absolutely garbage. Not to mention how fucking dark it is. Can‚Äôt see shit!

Perk idea: Farmer disdain
---
If a survivor unhooked another survivor within 12/16/20m of you without Borrowed Time, grants the ability to give your weapon to the survivor that was unhooked to slap the shit out of the farmer.

"Famrers get slapped, we always see to that" the Legion.
---
The DC penalties aren't active until tomorrow according to the patch notes.
---
such a bizarre take that is way too common on here. you think the devs are secretly out to get survivors and they favor their precious killers? it's their game, they want to make it as balanced and fun as possible for everyone.
---
and what's this declaration of being a survivor main? how about your try playing the other 50% of the game, as a killer, and enjoy that as well?
---
but most of all it just sounds like you aren't enjoying the game in general. probably time to take a break.

Ok, this looks extremely similar to one that was posted before

---
Dead by Daylight has been getting better and better but ever since the release of Dedicated Servers it's been getting worse and worse. I can't say this is the *worst* the game has ever been (not by a long shot) but it certainly isn't getting better. I want to go back to pre-Stranger Things chapter since that was when the game wasn't plagued by garbage dedicated servers and even more garbage bugs. The last two chapters really didn't add anything: no offence to people who like Demo / Steve &gt;!(I'm a Steve main so lol)!&lt; / Oni / Yui &gt;!(Also really been liking Yui so lol)!&lt; but none of them have been impactful additions to the game. The only character of note in these past two chapters was Nancy, and the only reason she's had any impact is because of Inner Strength. But Demogorgon is trash tier with almost all of his addons being worthless and comes with trash perks, Steve's has a huge model as well as a loud voice and comes with trash perks, while I haven't played Oni much the general consensus I've gotten to online is that he's really unfun to play both as and against and comes with trash perks... and Yui. Holy fucking shit this didn't happen with Stranger Things but the amount of dumbasses in my Rank 2 games trying to Adept Yui with nothing but her 3 unique teachables at level 1 honest to god make me want to fucking strangle someone.
---
Rift really didn't add much of value and that was the only major addition to the game beyond the last two chapters. What's more is that (especially with Rift 3) games have been substantially worse as a result of people going for Rift challenges instead of actually playing the game. [Anyone remember the great hook farming rush?](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2sgs4/legends_say_that_those_who_unhook_against/) And I can't count the amount of games I've ruined by playing basement Leatherface with Monsterous Shrine or going AFK with Wraith just to down and camp two people with NOED.
---
The devs are in **desperate** need of an "operation health" for this game. Almost everyone I've talked to universally agrees that they should delay the next chapter and focus on fixing the game's issues and buffing weaker characters / perks. I think the community would be more than happy if Behaviour fixed the game instead of releasing a new chapter but... I understand: chapters make money, bug fixes don't. But Behaviour needs to stop looking at short term gain and examine long term benefit. [The playerbase has been steadily declining](https://steamcharts.com/app/381210) ever since April 29th. You know what was added April 29th? Oh! The emblem system! And the End Game Collapse was added on the PTB during this time too! It's almost like fixing long-lasting issues that the playerbase has had with the game since its inception gets you more players than adding trash tier DLC with Huntress('s perks)-tier perks? There was a massive drop in player all through November with a noticeable drop at the turning of the month. This was around the time that the latest Tome was added so...
---
As Behaviour is treating this game currently it will die off. *Fast.* Almost every single person I talk to says they've been enjoying the game less and less with each upcoming patch. People who were once really upbeat are now salty and toxic over this game's bullshit. I've been trying to enjoy it because it's still my main game but it's more of a chore than anything. And I really don't think I need to explain why thinking a game is a chore is a problem. Practically every match I encounter some bullshit that makes me parrot something along the lines of "Hi we're Behaviour Interactive and we can program a video game!" or "BHVR be like *programming a functional video game noises.*" This game still *functions* but barely.
---
It's way more situational now, it's only active up to a minute after you're unhooked.
---
Lol. Look at all the down votes for correct information. Fuck this sub is so toxic.
---
You do realize the people designing cosmetics aren't the people designing reworks, right?
---
Fuck yah we go t ds that means I don't need to lvl laurie
---
Rocket League is far less complex than Dead by Daylight, but as u/Liliththe13 said Behaviour has a far bigger team. There's honestly no excuse for their incompetence, even if their dev team *was* small.
---
‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt play the game you paid for‚Äù
---
Its a combination of either or, and it doesnt make it any less acceptable. Vaults still vaccuum survivors backwards into hits, hitboxes and collision boxes are the size of russia. And overall dedicated servers are shit.
---
And no matchmaking isnt fine, everyone consistently gets matched with rank 15 solo players at rank 3 and its dumb.
---
Perk idea: Robin Hood. 
---
If a survivor rescues another survivor from the hook and doesn‚Äôt grant them the endurance status while you are 15-20-25 meters from the hook, that survivor suffers the exposed status and you can Mori that survivor. Expose duration is infinite and the Mori counts as 3 books. 
---
‚ÄúHelp your friends instead of yourself for once‚Äù
---
A fuck you build: Anarchy, TOtH, Discordance, Ruin.
---
How risky are these to install?
---
Most of the garbage in the rift is recolour fillers of the same charm 6 times.
---
Wait. I'm looking at the DbD wiki and it's saying this isn't there. 
---
Can someone confirm that DS is in the shrine so I can finally be a God?
---
**Over saturated Content**
---
Just don't hook people in the basement ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_///¬Ø
---
What? You want to hook people in the basement for *strategy* or because you simply don't know about the bug? No you're just a filthy exploit abuser. And on that note please don't exploit a bug that essentially gives you a free Mori, especially considering that Survivors sometimes can't struggle which gives you an easy basement hook!
---
This isnt a call to actually increase gen speeds i just wanted people that say increasing gen times would make the game boring to explain their position to me, as ive said i understand the position of people that say they shouldnt be increased for balance reasons. Also those statistics mean literally nothing bhvr even came out saying that they mean nothing so pls dont take them to heart.
---
Has somebody made meme cat perks yet?
---
Also it only healed from the dying state to injured, not even injured to healthy at first (from what i remember)
---
I TRY TO TELL PEOPLE HOW I SPEND MY FREE TIME BUT IF YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN DBD YOU SOUND LIKE A PSYCHOPATH. YES DAVE I LIKE TO HEAR MY FRIENDS SCREAM WHEN I SURPRISE-KNIFE THEM. NO DAVE I DON'T THINK HR NEEDS TO HEAR ABOUT THIS. GODDAMN IT DON'T MAKE ME STAB YOU TOO.
---
I might have been doing this unintentionally. I was trying to get the basement hook challenges and I thought players rage quit as usual, and I was complete unaware of the bug.
---
So I apologize to everyone for doing this.
---
Survivor: Furiously wiggles arms to signal I'm camping.
---
Me: Literally just grabbing hatchets before I leave the hook.
---
AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE BEAUTIFUL NEW CONTENT THIS PATCH IS PROBABLY THE ABSOLUTE BUGGIEST THING THAT BHVR HAS EVER PUT OUT, AND THAT INCLUDES THE LEGION PATCH WITH THE UNREAL ENGINE UPDATE. LET'S DO A QUICK TALLY HERE:
---
-HIT DETECTION IS NOW EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE. I'M EITHER MISSING POINT BLANK M1 SWINGS ON SURVIVORS IN MY HITBOX ON KILLER OR GETTING HIT AFTER I'VE VAULTED A WINDOW AND ROUNDED A CORNER ON SURVIVOR.
---
-THE SURVIVOR CARRY MUSIC BASICALLY NOW PLAYS EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU ARE OUT OF A CHASE AFTER YOU'VE PICKED UP AND HOOKED SOMEONE. NOT ONLY DOES IT MESS WITH MY AUDIOLOCATION BUT ITS A VERY SHORT MUSIC LOOP AND EXTREMELY IRRITATING TO LISTEN TO FOR A WHILE 10-20 MINUTE MATCH.
---
-MAP LIGHTING IS COMPLETELY MESSED UP. MAPS ARE ALL WAY DARKER AND HARDER TO SEE ANYTHING. SANCTUM OF WRATH IS BASICALLY SO DAMN DARK I CAN'T EVEN APPRECIATE THE ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY OF THE NEW STRUCTURE AT ALL. WHILE IT'S GREAT FOR GETTING MY TRAPPER CHALLENGES DONE (TAR BOTTLE TRAPS ARE NOW VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE) IT'S VERY FATIGUING TO MY EYES IN GENERAL TO HAVE TO FOCUS SO HARD AND FIND SURVIVORS. THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS OF COURSE ORMOND, WHICH IS A DUMPSTER FIRE MAP THAT SHOULD BE DELETED ANYWAYS.
---
-MATCHMAKING IS SOMEHOW EVEN MORE FUCKED UP THAN BEFORE. [TAKE THIS EXAMPLE](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/611684241914331139/651661186143748096/unknown.png?width=756&amp;height=637). I'M A RED RANKS SURVIVOR PLAYING AGAINST A PURPLE RANK GHOSTFACE WITH A RANK 20 CLAUDETTE SOMEHOW IN MY SOLO QUEUE GAME, HER ONLY PERK BEING SELF CARE. SHE LASTED ABOUT 2 MINUTES LEAVING US WITH A 1V3. ALL MY GAMES HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS IN SOLO QUEUE. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
---
-THE REAL CHERRY ON TOP OF THE SHIT SUNDAE IS THE BASEMENT BUG. IF YOU GET HOOKED IN THE BASEMENT YOU GET A RANDOM CHANCE TO BASICALLY BE GLITCHED OUT FOR THE REST OF THE MATCH AND UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING. IT EVEN HAPPENED IN THE LATEST NO0B3 VIDEO ALTHOUGH YOU ONLY SEE IT FROM THE KILLER PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW RUNNING IRON GRASP, MAD GRIT AND AGITATION SPECIFICALLY TO ABUSE THE BUG FOR EASY 4KS AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR AND BREAKS THE GAME ENTIRELY. THE WORST PART IS THIS BUG DIDN'T EVEN EXIST ON PTB AT ALL SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE COULD HAVE EVEN CAUGHT IT EARLY. BASEMENT HOOKS NEED TO BE COMPLETELY DISABLED IN A HOTFIX UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO UNFUCK THIS SITUATION BECAUSE MORE AND MORE KILLERS ARE GOING TO START EXPLOITING THIS.
---
"unhook 15 survivors" - yeah you better believe your ass is getting point pinata'd with BT.
---
Legion was the Best thing that can happen to the survivors a usseles killer with no power that buff borrow times, nerf nurse calling
---
It's on every system but it won't happen necessarily every time.
---
Something fishy going on here üëÄ
---
Oh that‚Äôs cool
---
I actually spent about half an hour last night just chasing a poor Nancy trying to drag her to the basement. She kept getting away, so I'd drag her closer, let her escape, and try to chase her toward the basement so she was closer but she was NOT having it. She probably thought I was trying to take advantage of the bug but honestly I just wanted to get the challenge over and done with!
---
Thise are not equivalent analogies. Getting 95% of your objectives done doesnt mean you get 5% free. One of you will die but others will live. This is DEAD by Daylight not We Did Most of Our Work so We Should Win by Default by Daylight
---
As someone who doesn't usually bring Moris it's been beyond boring to bring an Ebony Mori every match just to kill my Obsession. And I only bring an Ebony because I have like 3 Ivories compared to my 10+ Ebonies. Ebony Moris are supposed to be rare btw.
---
Two of those killers aren't toxic.
---
yeah happened to me one game
---
They are when im against them
---
Do you want free unearned Legacy as well too or?
---
I had chase music starting when I was sure there were no survivors nearby to be chased. One was hooked that I wasn't facing and BBQ showed the other three on gens on the other side of the map.
---
Wait until you kick a gen
---
It's not a matter of bugfixing being hard. It's a matter of gamebreaking bugs being shipped every update, and then Behaviour taking several days or even weeks to fix them.
---

Rancor your Nemesis.

Fixed an issue that prevented survivors from sacrificing The Legion to The Entity
---
He plays PlayStation 4 I believe
---
Well shit bruh. Gotta yeet this away then
---
Yeah we're taking two game breaking bugs way too seriously. We should just accept that the game is broken and smile and laugh when we essentially get Moried at the start of the game and then have to go AFK for 5 minutes. :)
---
Huh? I never noticed it and practically play only Legion.

---
It's like you blacked out and didn't read my comment at all
---
&gt; And no matchmaking isnt fine, everyone consistently gets matched with rank 15 solo players at rank 3 and its dumb.
---
uh no this is always because of SWF. always. 
---
&gt; ‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt play the game you paid for‚Äù
---
OP has said, repeatedly, he has lost hope and doesn't think his issues will be fixed. if that is your position, then yes, don't play. people stop using shit they paid for all the time. it's not like no one knew when they got it that dbd has consistent bug issues.
---
&gt; Vaults still vaccuum survivors backwards into hits
---
this is something that happens so infrequently it might as well be described as "never." what is more common are latency hits that connect after a vault and you have forward momentum 
---
&gt; hitboxes and collision boxes are the size of russia.
---
Again, hitboxes are fine and you all just refuse to accept that it's latency when you take a bad hit. if you wanna complain about that, fine, but please complain about the right fucking thing.
---
&gt; And overall dedicated servers are shit.
---
everyone and their damn mom was saying they were not going to work but the community demanded it anyway and now it's too late to go back. this is ya'll fault

I understand this is a post about the Leatherface but let us not ignore the horrible use of pallets. Hurts my soul...

I ended up having to rant about the challenges on my profile except for the killer because I felt like dog shit. I had just gotten done with the whole "hook someone in basement while someone is already on hook in basement with monstrous shrine" except I was forced to take the easy way out after like thirty games of not being able to do it fairly. I basically hid against the wall facing the hooked survivor with insidious and when someone went for the save I grabbed them and hooked them next to the person. I did let everyone go after that because of guilt but I don't want to play like that.
---
It's not to indicate camping, it's to indicate it's not safe for a save.
---
I‚Äôve already used BS on GF as I mentioned before. But I could swear that they feel slower breaking pallets. Probably something having to do with the animation.
---
Maybe because there's an achievement to hook someone while all other survivors are injured? She seems like the achievement was made for her.
---
Ruin is a band aid fix to the real problem of gens being stupidly fast. Id rather them address the real problem but this is bhvr so what if they changed ruin to not be a hex anymore but it only affects the first 50% of a generator. Id say just have it up the first 2-3 min of the game but that promotes people just playing super immersed until the ruin timer is gone.
---
Sorry for the phone picture, it's the only way I could've cencored the names.
---
UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO REMOVE THE CHEESE, BUT THEY DID IT IN THE WORST WAY POSSIBLE. IF IT WAS PROXIMITY BASED, IT WOULDN'T AFFECT CHEESERS. BUT THEY DECIDED GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION AND CHOSE TO DUMP ON LEGION MAINS WHO AREN'T CHEESEMAKERS.
---
Also wanted to add Benedict Baker‚Äôs journal entries for these two
---
KILLER-I thought there was a little girl who was trapped in this cursed realm. The sound of her whistling itsy-bitsy spider has been etched in my mind. I hear the tune draw closer until I hear the sound of scissors. She was following me, but moved in silence and precision, moved in the dark like she was my shadow. If I stop running, I fear she‚Äôll cut me with her golden scissors stained with dry blood, I cannot hide. The shadow knows where we are, unlike the other killers she seems to have a determined and yet agonizing look in her eyes as if she‚Äôs trying to find a specific person, does she want justice or does she want revenge? 
---
SURVIVOR-I stumbled upon a determined young woman the other day. She looked strong, but angsty as if she knew the danger she was put in right away. I see her move with desperation to escape, yet at the same time something is keeping her hopeful. Disturbingly, she may look like any other survivor, but she seems to have the mannerisms and instincts of a killer. Why did the entity bring her here? Was it to kill or just be prey
---
The only credit you get for an unhook is that you don't lose points. You get 10 points, but you've also lost 10 points.
---
&gt;When your getting chased, you get credit for gens getting done.
---
I didn't include this because it's so insignificant. It's a max of 33 points, and you basically never hit that. When looking at this emblem, I basically assume my teammates aren't doing gens. I'd say 75% of the time when I finish a chase and am downed, there are no teammates, maybe 1 at best, on a generator. Remember it's easy to get to red rank, so these people are dumb as bricks.
---
Get used to it if you are going to play Hag. Survivors don't understand her limitations at all.
---
Oh my god I love that.
---
Killers I want : Jason and Jack Torrance.
---
Survivors I want : Matthieu cote.
---
Things I'll never get : Jason, Jack Torrance, and Matthieu cote
---
But it doesn‚Äôt work like that. If a surv dcs then they don‚Äôt get the rest of the sacrifice points
---
CONSOLE ISN'T GETTING DC PUNISHMENTS YET SO MY STACKS CAN STILL LEAVE THE GANE BEFORE I HOOK THEM WITH PRACTICALLY NO PUNISHMENT TO THEN
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that
---
I purposely go for the other survivor if this happens. It's just so shitty and uncalled for.
---
Adrenaline is the only one I'll run, they all eventually get nerfed into uselessness or are unreliable at best.
---
Used to run Lithe, but there's no point with how bad dedicated servers are.
---
I miss his vids, I used to watch him all the time my personal favorite is "Everyone needs a Hero"
---
Nah, the stomp boy can pull minimum 90 degree turns to pop people around loops during his dash.
---
He's strong, just tough to play.
---
I get that anxiety, but honestly wasting pallets THAT frequently is only a major liability in the long run.
---
You could‚Äôve bought far more time by playing the loop as that bubba was not that good, he probably would have failed to play the loop while charging cause it‚Äôs tricky as heck to avoid bumping corners like that.
---
No he doesn‚Äôt ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
To piggy back off the top comment, I want to raise awareness to an issue that BHVR refuses to acknowledge and most of you don't think about: consoles. 
---
This isn't a diss to PC players, just want to inform you of what's going on now and has been going on for awhile. 
---
For starters, booting this game up on PS4 sucks ass. The FPS is uncapped at the screen and our PS4s take flight everytime booting this game up. Minor annoyance. Want to play some survivor? Cool, boot up and expect 5 to 10 minutes because you're a solo player and red/purple rank. After waiting that time, you find a match! Oh, what's this? Host Disconnected? Join Game Failure? Error?
---
Smash the accept button 3 times and boot up again. 5 minutes pass. Connection failed. Kicks you to main menu. Load up again and finally found a match. Being a lower rank increases the frequency you can encounter this but you can also find matches quick so it balances out. But the game is already unplayable in a sense for us that PC players rarely experience. This is DAILY people! At prime time of day too.
---
But hey, Killer works right? Load up and find a match quick because of course half the game only works and start a match. Hope you're not playing Wraith or Hag or any killer with addons that mess with their animation speeds (Plague, Billy, etc). Why you ask? Because the FPS gets worse than it already is. God forbid you get a map like the Cornfields and you might as well disconnect if you reach Bloodlust.
---
Now to be clear, this rarely costs me the game. Extends some games, sure. Might cause one survivor to slip away, but usually it just reminds me I'm a second class citizen in BHVR's eyes. But what about the new patch?
---
The new map is terrible because you. Can't. See. Shit. This is horrible as killer but I'm sure this sucks for survivors in certain situations too. And the Oni is *frustratingly* hard to control. Nurse gets joked about being unplayable on consoles, the Oni pretty much is. 
---
All the FPS issues aforementioned makes his power hell to use AND it feels like my analog sticks are held hostage in Demon Dash. 
---
Consoles need to optimized and it needed to happen yesterday.
---
I‚Äôve never had those problems against plague. I get problems against clown where my game basically freezes when I get hit by a bottle.
---
Can I use Urban Invasion on a fan made ideas project? You'd be credited
---
To be fair, part of the reason is to get the word out to other players about what‚Äôs happening. The killer in my last game either didn‚Äôt know, or was lying about not knowing. It‚Äôs not a little bug, it‚Äôs a BIG one, and instant loss for anyone who meets rather simple criteria. 
---
People should know that they have a major disadvantage for receiving a basement hook, and that‚Äôs done better via multiple posts. 
---
I didn‚Äôt post one because I did do a search after I saw a teammate‚Äôs aura fall off the map in my last game. But it‚Äôs impractical to think that everyone will do a search on day one of a new bug. Especially because the more data collected about an issue, the easier it is to figure out what‚Äôs wrong. 
---
For instance: many posts I saw were Oni specific, and others were more map specific, though unfortunately the issue seems more generic since my match didn‚Äôt reflect either of those. 
---
Now BHVR is in these subs, at least to the extent that they post patch updates and respond on Official BHVR posts. They have acknowledged the bug, but I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs been an official (usually pinned) post about it from BHVR. If they‚Äôd do that and get the word out, it wouldn‚Äôt stop the basement posts, but it would lessen for sure. 
---
But unfortunately all you‚Äôve really done here is... make another basement post.
---
Nancy's cheating!
---
The nerf doesn't make any sense at all, the passive ability was the primary use of the perk in the first place.  I'd rather they have removed the sprint entirely than to lose that.
---
Whenever I get exposed and I don't see the killer, I scream
---
I had a game two days ago where I was blinded once and it lasted the whole game. Yesterday I got stuck inside generators twice when damaging them.
---
unless looping around the jungle gym lockers is 3m?
---
its tradition to stick your tongue out or it doesn't count though, go tongue or go home
---
Reminds me of a time on Shelter woods where I had a Laurie hiding and a Dwight on hook, both were the last 2. I thought Laurie was hatch camping so I tried to cross-map yeet a bottle and somehow get her. I got a tree branch right above me and heard her scream from the rock right next to me.
---
Preach
---
Yes I actually wonder if that's on purpose or if it's a bug. I find that lately the devs did quiet a lot unnecesarry changes, that knowing them, make it more likely for different bugs to happen.
---
When the world ends, that's when
---
sorry to hear
---
I'VE HAD A STRING OF REALLY GREAT GAMES IN THE HIGH RANKS BOTH AS SURVIVOR AND KILLER THAT WERE ROBUST, FUN AND VERY CHILL ON ALL SIDES. FINALLY GOING AGAINST A SLEW OF INTERESTING KILLERS LIKE A CHAINED UP DEMOGORGON, A HALLOWED PLAGUE AND CLOWN, ETC. (SORRY GHOST FACE BUT I REALLY AM SICK OF YOU). ALSO I'VE BEEN PRACTICING HUNTRESS AND HAVE ALREADY HAD A FEW SUCCESSFUL MATCHES WITH GOOD HITS AND A GENERAL STRATEGY THAT IS COMING TOGETHER. MY SURVIVORS IN MY HAWKINS TRIAL AS THE PIG WERE EVEN COOL WHEN WE HAD A DC AND I LET THEM LIVE; THEY LEFT RIGHT AWAY WITHOUT BMING OR TEABAGGING
---
ANYWAY IT'S REALLY EASY TO LOSE FAITH IN EACH OTHER IN A COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN DEFINED PRIMARILY BY ITS MEAN-SPIRITEDNESS BUT OVERALL MY PAST GAMES HAVE FELT IMMERSIVE AND RESPECTFUL ON ALL SIDES AND I JUST THINK THAT'S PRETTY GREAT
---
I feel really bad because I‚Äôve hooked people in the basement but didn‚Äôt know üòñ
---
r/dbdgonewild begs to differ
---
Is that because of a perk on the killer side?
---
It‚Äôs to easily to judge anything. I also see some ppl on console keep complaining he sucks even though it‚Äôs been like a day
---
&gt;Yesterday I got stuck inside generators twice when damaging them.
---
Someone else just commented that aswell. This is insane!
---
*Bam Bam shows no mercy.*
---
I played one game after the new update. Got hooked (not in basement) fell through the map. And got a message saying "reported" I just sent them the clip and they were like "o"
---
This is a bad place for a consensus as this sub is obsessed with "mains" and is very survivor vs killer minded with a slight killer bias.  Even with the stats showing killers were over-performing they were arguing about killers needing buffs.
---
Either way it's way too early to tell.  Once people fully learn how to play him and play around with different loadouts we'll know where he stands.
---
Oh I am dreading doing that one as well as the NOED one. I've had them unlocked for a couple days now, but am actively avoiding doing them until I have to. I just don't play killer that way.
---
I‚Äôm not even playing until it‚Äôs fixed, mostly because I got screwed over multiple times from the multi-killer exploit alone.... so I‚Äôm not about to give killers more chance to ruin my games, and I‚Äôm not about to play killer if I can‚Äôt use hooks if they‚Äôre readily available (because I won‚Äôt do that to other players)
---
After 5 hours of playtime, I can confirm he is a BLAST
---
I agree it's soon to say, I have to play him more and against him too to  form a better view. But for sure: he is definitely not OP nor weak
---
Yes... and since my name is mori_if_ur_horni  it‚Äôs usually over if they find me. tunnel express
---
Game breaking to me is when u press play and it crashes or freezes it is big bugs I ain't saying that but besides the wiggle bug how often do u get hooked in basement? if it is so game breaking then I would expect DBD to be dead until the next fix but I doubt that will happen the game dying that is
---
I can't even remember a time they have even apologized for the inconvenience. Like damn, at least say sorry.
---
Wish granted.
---
You said that BHVR heard them loud and clear, but what did they do?
---
It‚Äôs almost as if hardware limitations have nothing to do with time
---
Huh weird
---
You couldn't mend?
---
I kicked a couple gens today nothing happened soooooo
---
MAN I REALLY HATE GETTING HOOKED TEN SECONDS INTO A MATCH ONLY FOR THE KILLER TO THEN STARE DIRECTLY AT ME AND BEAT ME UP WHILE I‚ÄôM ON THE HOOK. LIKE CMON, THATS GOTTA BE ONE OF THE MOST UNFUN THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME. SURELY YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN JUST CAMP ME AT THE HOOK.
---
ALSO, WHY IS IT THAT I‚ÄôM THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN PASS SKILL CHECKS WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE PEOPLE ON A GENERATOR???? ITS REALLY NOT THAT HARD PEOPLE. I HATE GETTING SCREWED BY SOMEONE ELSE‚ÄôS FUCKUP WHICH RESULTS IN **ME** DYING AND NOT THE PERSON WHO COULDNT DO A GODDAMN SINGLE SKILL CHECK
---
Did you miss the locker teleport?
---
ACTUALLY YOU CAN FIX THE FALLING THROUGHT THE MAP BUG, WHAT HAPPENED FOR ME IS I FEEL THROUGH THE WORLD (OBVIOUSLY) THEN THE KILLER TUNNELED ME AND I DSED THEM AND IT WAS FIXED!
---
You do realize those most recent stats are junk, right? They don‚Äôt control for any relevant variables
---
I think it‚Äôs still to early to judge ik a few ppl who have played him so far and not lost once. But it‚Äôs just a opinion after all
---
Yes i know. I have all teachables unlocked which kind of adds to the problem. 18 killers x 3 teachables = 54 x 3 tiers of each perk = 162 and you only can unlock 2 per blood web 162/2= 81 and each blood web takes like 70k to advance = 5.7 million points not including the non teachable perks. And thats only for 1 character
---
Fuck new people wanting to play with their friends I guess.
---
Dude I saw this the other day and took a screen shot. I was dying laughing
---
It's the strongest survivor perk in the game aside adreneline
---
The problem is that lower ranked surviviors get wrecked by lower ranked killers, so it's hard to fix it at higher ranks without making that more imbalanced. 
---
I think fixing the gen issue is the better option because it's boring for the survivors too. They should find a way to slow gens down but make it more exciting.
---
I like the idea for ruin not being a hex.
---
I think they need to have it so that after rank 10 or so the gens take longer or something like that
---
I FUCKING HATE CORN, PLEASE DELETE THE FUCKING CORN!
---
it actually isn't though. Killer queues still instant, survivor queues still take like 5 min at red rank and give me a purple rank killer with maybe one other red rank teammate and then a rank 13 and a rank 20. I just said fuck it and practiced Oni all night, he's fun but tough. Very good design though.
---
Or they could just prolong the required time to complete the archive. 
---
I‚Äôm not playing until it‚Äôs fixed. 
---
There‚Äôs other issues that MIGHT  be back, but aren‚Äôt getting as much traction. I got the infinite loading screen last night, requiring me to DC and depip. Now maybe that was a fluke and not an actual big bug that‚Äôs back, who knows.
---
MAN THAT REALLY SUCKS I‚ÄôD BE PISSED. I HOPE YOU CAN GET IT NEXT TIME YOU TRY.
---
Shocks stopping pallets doesn‚Äôt help in high tiers but that‚Äôs not his only problem. 
---
He is immensely addon dependent, because his base kit is ass. The shock range is terrible, and it takes a lot of shocks to get someone into tier 3. So when choosing addons you‚Äôre deciding which part of his kit to emphasize at the detriment of he others. 
---
Once they‚Äôre there, it doesn‚Äôt take much for gen to get put‚Äîor they are bad at it and can never snap out. So that‚Äôs a lot of time spent zapping, then they‚Äôre out again. The random skill check pavement again only messes up low ranks. 
---
And most of the effects are on the survivor side, not killer side. You just have to assume they‚Äôre working. 
---
Also he‚Äôs The only killer who switches modes between ‚Äúuse delay power‚Äù and ‚Äúcan M1‚Äù. 
---
Ultimately doc is a lot of low level effects set to annoy people, but amounts to not doing much beyond a moment‚Äôs disruption.
---
Agreed. I escaped my first Oni and he was very easy to counter in a chase with his ability &amp; I‚Äôm not even a good survivor.
---
I‚Äôm not too concerned with survivability, but how fun it is to play against. Like, Freddie with certain add ons makes me want to uninstall from boredom. He slows the game sooooo much which isn‚Äôt really fun for either side imo 
---
At least this dudes chase music is lit.
---
I agree. I‚Äôm rank 1 and just played a game where nobody was doing anything and, surprise, they were SWF and two of them were rank 17. That creates a completely unenjoyable experience for me since the killer is practically getting handed a game with two babies. 
---
Pls BHVR, implement this again. I don‚Äôt mind having fun and fucking around, but I frustrating experience kinda sucks all around.
---
No no, I just got hit out of nowhere. My Mend timer didn't even start going down.
---
definitely the way I see it too!
---
A few people did. I just came to vent, another person also vented in the comments. It's just a game, but it can be frustrating as hell at times.
---
That‚Äôs understandable but as a killer who is rank 10 right now, after playing 10 games last night and not finding a rank 9-15 survivor something seems a little off. Every game is three purple/red ranks and one 16-20.
---
Because they don‚Äôt work properly
---
Except i dont think anyone is buying all the legion cosmetics that come out, instead just buying their favorites, like any other killer. If anything, I could see implementing the whole group into the game itself as more incentive for people to buy more cosmetics
---
I think what OP means is people who go into a lobby alone can see the ranks of the other players and judge if they're good enough.
---
Slam hard.
---
I'm not asking to to prove it but I did not see that patch, would you mind linking it or letting me know which update it was so I can check it out?
---
Even if that is intentional though, I should definitely be able to set my bear traps without immediately getting caught in it before I even have the opportunity to move (that happens a lot).
---
You're the highest rank and died. Do they camp?
---
Not accurate, real spirit player would farm her even faster.
---
WHAT IS THE BASEMENT BUG?
---
I had a lot of fun trying to survive he‚Äôs scary as shit when he‚Äôs running at you lol
---
I thought it was just me. It's dark af
---
r/dbdgonewild?
---
Trust me. I was lol. You're part of the stupid PC Masterrace vs Console Peasants mindset, and I just caught you in the act (PC player btw)! Why should the two communities fight anyway, when we're united by our love for gaming?
---
Demo. Oni is more popular so Demo will make you stand out and you can try something a little more complex
---
ahhh, that makes so much more sense. thanks for the explanation!
---
I've seen some shit.
---
Oooh I see. Is that a Legion bug though or would it be more of a glitch with the game itself?
---
Thanks Dexter, I guess he misinterpreted my reply :P
---
cought me in the act of what? Disproving you're flawed argument with facts? I've got nothing against consoles I just find you as a person pretty pathetic ngl
---
This is true. Don't know why everyone is giving bhvr shit over dedicated servers cause of some vault animation latency when p2p has worse latency as soon as the baby killers mommy starts watching Netflix.
---
I don't recall that being covered in the original tooltip, only the hallucinations.
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
The Council of the Hairs demands your presence.
---
Have you ever played Hide and Seek or Freeze Tag? On *Halloween*?
---
Not sure, maybe he was using a Lag switch or something. Or my connection was just absolutely horrible.
---
You roasting yourself here?
---
Get BBQ on your killers. Use WGLF on survivors. Save up to 1mil BP before new characters come out, which is what this person probably did. My Yui is level 50 cuz I did that.
---
I have tried that and it doesn't always work, it seems pretty random to me.
---
Tfw you were doing the basement hook challenge and didn't realize what you've done
---
No way I'm buying that Trainwreck again.
---
Well I either had luck to meet 5-6 teams of very friendly survivors or some of them think like me that it's currently active :D
---
Either way BAN system is more then welcome addition to DBD
---
He can he doesn't know how to or doesn't want to.
---
yo that sounds epic lemme see that too
---
Don't you enjoy the lobby as well? ;)
---
I mean, they're all important
---
I think it's just a trick of the animation.  They look very low energy so they feel slower.  I swear the Demogorgon sucks at breaking pallets because of how wimpy its little paw slaps look (due to the steep angle of dropped pallets one of the slaps straight up misses the fucking pallet and it just breaks anyway out of pity anyway), though I'm sure that it's still functionally the same.
---
Smack
---
Those stats are still the best quantitative information available, so I‚Äôm going to trust them as basis for argument instead of some subjective hearsay.
---
No offense, but people who decry that the stats are junk should provide stats adjusted for the un-factored variables instead of using that as an excuse to negate arguments.
---
So the stats aren‚Äôt perfect. Ok, so we should use opinionated hearsay which has even less quantitative value instead? Ridiculous.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e618a7/weve_all_had_this_in_a_game_before/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I mean in all fairness he would have been top of the board if he got the 5k for escape so it‚Äôs fairly safe to say he did more than his teammates
---
No it was a joke. And if you don't see that you are just stupid.
---
Literally this happened to me with a piggy one game we literally crawled right past eachother
---
In the act of being a dick towards console players for literally no reason? Re-read my first reply, I'm pretty sure you missed the **"CAN"** in that sentence (which changed it from an argument to a joke)
---
Can't fix what isn't broken... Hitboxes are fine for the most part excluding a few specific scenarios, people just need to learn the impact of latency.
---
What a noob didn't even unlock akimbo glocks
---
Yeah it is just crazy. I honestly feel like we are at the point where double BPs should just become standard instead of events. There are so many teachables and killers, and everything in 3 Tiers, it takes ages to get what you want on the killers you want. 
---
Direct upgrades are kind of a nice idea, I also think we should be able to sell stuff from the Bloodweb back. Even if I could get only 1000 Bloodpoints for those crappy common fog offerings I would do it in a heartbeat. You pick up so much useless stuff that you never ever use and it just keeps piling on.
---
You shouldn't be forced to play with players with less skill than you. It's as a simple as that, and this wouldn't be an issue if the matchmaking wasn't so shit.
---
I WAS ON THE SUBREDDIT WHILE WAITING FOR A GAME AND I HEARD ABOUT THE BASEMENT GLITCH AND I WAS LIKE LOL THAT SUCKS FOR THEM THINKING IT WAS ONLY ON PC AND I‚ÄôM ON CONSOLE AND THEN I JUST GOT HOOKED IN THE BASEMENT AND I WAS LIKE....OH I‚ÄôM THE FOOL! I HAD A TEAMMATE UNHOOK AND HEAL ME BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY JANE IS STILL BITCHING AND MOANING IN THE AETHER AND THERE‚ÄôS NOTHING I CAN DO!
---
I‚Äôm not a dev or whatever, but this whole ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre an indie company, have a smaller team, therefore, it‚Äôs OK,‚Äù argument is really getting stale. 
---
So many indie companies release outstanding games with minor bugs on release day. Nothing really breaking. 
---
I look at Remnant, for instance. An enormous and beautiful game. Has anyone played it? When the game was released first, I had an amazing experience. 
---
Anyone still remembers when Demon‚Äôs Souls came out? FROMSOFT was considered an indie company around that time too. And how beautiful and amazing was DS? 
---
Even smaller games like Darkest Dungeon, Hollow Knight, Salt and Sanctuary, Bloodstained, they all offered an amazing and almost bug free experience. Updates actually fixed things as opposed to fixing 1-2 things and breaking 100 other. 
---
BHVR releases ONE map, TWO survivors, of which ONE is basically a skin, 6 perks, chase music, and... this happens. How? 
---
BHVR needs to either fire their incompetent people OR hire actual devs who know what they‚Äôre doing to TEACH their current employees. This is simply inexcusable. I have poured over $300 into DbD. A lot of time. I still love DbD and I believe in it. I‚Äôm simply saddened by the sheer amount of incompetence. 
---
I even forgive the shit graphics or the gens looking like they‚Äôre straight from Minecraft. I have given up hope on better and scarier graphics. But damn, at least HIRE MORE people to provide us players the experience we DESERVE for supporting your game, protect your game and secure its longevity instead of just calling us entitled and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing our best‚Äù, when YOUR definition of ‚Äúdoing the best‚Äù is not OUR definition of ‚Äúdoing their best‚Äù. Stop driving and pushing away people. We DESERVE better, BHVR. If I‚Äôm entitled for saying that, then so be it.
---
Right, because Legion is oh so strong even with Nemesis...
---
Found the spirit main
---
As a ps4 player I agree the fps are absolutely terrible. I'm jealous on all pc players. For some reason Hag always lags, so I can't play her. 
---
I think the other problems are on console and pc. Maybe some are a bit worse on console. But I can't judge on that since I haven't played this game on pc.
---
Poe's Law. You should know by now that sarcasm is poorly translated into text. And considering people are genuinely that stupid it's not unreasonable for me to believe it :). Especially on this subreddit it seems.
---
So much this
---
Scary lol.
---
Instaheal
---
BHVR, PLEASE, JUST LET US HAVE THE OPTION TO BIND THE LEFT AND RIGHT ACTIONS ON CONSOLE. CONSOLE ONI IS CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN PC ONI SINCE SURVIVORS CAN SAFELY LOOP AREAS PC ONI CAN‚ÄôT. OR JUST GIVE CONSOLE PLAYERS MORE TURNING LENIENCY AT THE END OF A DEMON DASH.
---
What do u mean
---
Gersebermps
---
**Explanation**
---
Claudette hits me with a pallet, interrupts my pallet break by sliding across, which forces a pickup of Dwight, slides back across, then flashlight blinds me.
---
Honestly, I had to stop for a moment and figure out what happened. And I wasn't mad. I was actually really impressed.
---
In the after game chat, he/she was giddy about it, asking the other survivors if they had seen it. It was adorable!
---
[Full video](https://youtu.be/tCjJxlgUZSg)

r/uselessredcircle
---
then add a damn question mark ya plob :P otherwise it just looks like a typo :P
---
Demon Dash takes a few games to get a handle on since the turning and movement and separate instead of like Hillbilly, but he's a decently high tier killer in my opinion. And I see now, the queues must've shifted overnight because my survivor wait times went from seconds to roughly 2 minutes at rank 1. Kinda annoying
---
ONI HOOKS YOU IN BASEMENT AND YOU FALL INDEFINITELY THROUGH THE MAP THE MOMENT YOUR HOOKED.
---
Yea! Just like with nurse, spirit, insta heals, and the recent oni changes!... Wait
---
I was defending the hatch as it stands currently in my first post, I don't see how that's the main argument here since we seem to agree on it.
---
I SOMEHOW LOOPED THE KILLER FOR LIKE A MINUTE AND A HALF WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE SHIT AND THEN HE CAUGHT ME AND HOOKED ME IN THE BASEMENT AGAIN THIS IS A HATE CRIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Love the cj tech
---
WHEN A SURVIVOR IS HOOKED IN THE BASEMENT, THEIR SCREEN GOES GREY/WHITE AND THEN YOU‚ÄôRE BASICALLY OUTSIDE OF THE MAP AND YOU CAN‚ÄôT DO OR SEE ANYTHING EVEN IF YOU‚ÄôRE UNHOOKED
---
Might as well, confusing more people won't help anyone
---
But you do admit to misinterpreting the joke, right?
---
Sadly they‚Äôve said adding custom chase music to older killers is very unlikely
---
I mean yeah lol.
---
I ALSO HAD DS BREAK ME OUT OF THE BUG.
---
THATS WHAT I JUST SAID!
---
Well I would like to play him it's just that I'm fucking poor
---
IN ADDITION TO THE BASEMENT BUG I FREQUENTLY CANT EVEN ATTEMPT TO WIGGLE. THE OPTION IS GONE!
---
No I csn completely understand what you're coming from, and agree aswell. I think there's a difference between not liking the way a game is going, and not liking that a game is getting unplayable. 
---
Ofcourse an argument could be: 'But you don't have to spend so much money. It's your own fault.' But I'd say it's more then logical that you spend some extra money on a game you enjoy. Let's say you buy a laptop. And the new software updates make it so that word and reddit f.e. won't work. Ofcourse you're gonna complain, you paid for that! So I don't think you're being entitled.
---
I like to think of it as a rework, it didn't look like a nerf
---
you glow out your ass
---
If someone brags about waiting 30 minutes for a match you have to understand it's sarcasm. Otherwise, again, you are stupid.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a glitch that‚Äôs been happening
---
Cant blame them when the archives want you to hook in the basement
---
I would,  but I got all perks tier 3 on feng, got her p3, and only 6 survivors to unlock teachables on.
---
I've dug myself too deep into this hole to yeet myself out and start all over.
---
Again it wasn't made clear considering the lack of punctuation. He made it seem like he was defending the other person's point by saying that pc's have 30 minute queue times and every killer is tunneling...
---
If you can't understand that point of view you my friend, are stupid.
---
I hate to say I don't remember which patch it was exactly, but it was within the last three or four months.  People in the threads were reasoning it's to provide a more tactical approach; you shouldn't block yourself into a dead end with a trap and expect to get out.
---
It's more likely due to Yui's new perk.
---
Mine prefers to hold my controls when I play.
---
Hacked a bunch of purple flashlights in at some point
---
Bro what
---
Otz is amazing. Who do you enjoy? Tru3? üò¨
---
You pretty much just have to wait for someone to get hooked and not facecamped. BT will be the icing on top as it will confirm the safe hook.
---
The next one you might get stuck on is the flashlight save. Took me all day yesterday until I decided to start YOLO‚Äôing saves by being right in front of the killer while they picked someone up. Worked after the third attempt. Before I was trying to do stuff from side.
---
Yeah just saw another video I was scrolling. Very fun feature!
---
what pants ?
---
Fucking Davids
---
I run Sabo on my p3 claudette. am I a bad person?
---
Placing down traps as hag sometimes take a little while longer
---
Mobile users unite ü•∞ü•∞
---
I think I have other ones, but I am not sure... Might just stick with Iri emblems for now, pretty straightforward one. 
---
I heard of the disconnect bans, but is there a new system implemented? How is it different from the current one? 
---
But it kinda is a shitshow :/ at least 2 out of my 10 games are disconnects and I am not always at fault for it :/
---
Are you talking about flairs?
---
sent the link to you and OP in DM :)
---
For me as killer, I keep rubberbanding back, denying me of a hit or running into a wall, when I try to perform actions, such as kicking a gen, I somehow get stuck inside a gen; the only way I managed to get unstuck was when I grabbed someone, then got stuck again, at the end game chat, that survivor said they couldn't see me and that I scared the shit out of them by suddenly teleporting behind them.
---
&gt; Those stats are still the best quantitative information available, so I‚Äôm going to trust them as basis for argument instead of some subjective hearsay.
---
The best does not equal good. It includes 1ks that turn into 4ks because of suicide missions. It includes people who died from memeing. It includes pity sacrifices. It does not consider survivors who would have escaped if not for a rage quit.
---
&gt; No offense, but people who decry that the stats are junk should provide stats adjusted for the un-factored variables instead of using that as an excuse to negate arguments.
---
absurd request. it is impossible for anyone not on bhvr's team to do that. it is possible to evaluate the data provided, though 
---
&gt; Ok, so we should use opinionated hearsay which has even less quantitative value instead? Ridiculous.
---
what? who said that? nice strawman
---
Oh, wow. How did I not think of that? It‚Äôs almost like I was being sarcastic to get a point across. But you‚Äôre absolutely right, the way to do something impossible is to simply ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù. Thank you for your wisdom

---
It was really weak still, it just had no counterplay and rewarded the worst play possible; either running behind and getting bloodlust and just following or trying to get stunned, still you would just straight up lose the game if you would try to cheese downs that way against any semi good survivors.
---
For a game that has such a massive player count on console and was a giant reason they could take the plunge to become independent, it‚Äôs staggering that console patching/balance is such an after thought.
---
GOT HOOKED IN THE BASEMENT BY ONI YESTERDAY AND ENDED UP FALLING INFINITELY THROUGH THE WORLD.  FILED A BUG REPORT WITH BEHAVIOR ONLY TO GET THE RESPONSE
---
&gt; Regarding this bug about Survivors falling out of the map after being hooked, our team is aware of this and are already working to fix this as soon as possible. For now, we would like to ask for more of your patience as we work on this.
---
I had to do it for an archive challenge, I let the poor Yui have hatch.
---
Better than Tru3 tbf
---
green is new red 
---
 red now a days is basically brown
---
You say that now but when that fuck is running at you at high speeds, that does get your blood pumping.
---
my favorite part is the dweet nodding in the back.
---
PEOPLE SAY THAT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO CAMP WITH DEVOUR HOPE, BUT I LITERALLY WATCHED THE KILLER WALK AWAY FROM THE HOOK AND WATCH IT FROM AFAR TO WAIT FOR MY TEAMMATE TO COME GET ME. THEN WHEN I FINALLY GOT UNHOOKED, SHE SLUGGED MY TEAMMATE SPECIFICALLY SO SHE COULD MAKE SURE I DIDNT RUN TOO FAR FROM THE HOOK. PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT, BUT IN THIS GAME IF THERES A WILL THERES A WAY
---
It‚Äôs a shame really cos that takes away from the fun of the killer. I saw a few changes that could‚Äôve made it more fair but still fun for the killer. E.g not being able to see scratch marks when in your ability.
---
I misunderstood what you meant by ‚Äúleast scary killer to date,‚Äù and I thought you were talking about dating Oni. Which is fine because he‚Äôs sexy af.
---
REPORTED THIS TO BEHAVIOR AND GOT THIS RESPONSE:
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs even worse as I‚Äôm typically a purple rank survivor (though I have been red once) and I‚Äôm stuck around 15-16 right now thanks to DC‚Äôs and troll players, and I was juuuuuust about to get out of there when the infinite screen hit me and depipped me. I just want to get back to where people are ‚Äòtrying‚Äô to complete the game.
---
Except for dodging like you do against Demogorgon‚Äôs dash.
---
I would understand if it was a M2 killer, because of instadowns, but wraith? You can just tap the gate until he sees you and run. If the other survivor has a brain he will do the same thing.
---
Mind expanding on this? I always thought besides people having bad PCs and general issues with the game that it runs fine on PC.
---
I would love to shed light on other optimization issues and just be more informed in general.
---
Sorry. I didn't even realize that was an acronym for Borrowed Time and now I feel dumb. Haven't had a Reddit/been speaking to other DBD players for very long yet. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I LIKE DOC BUT **WHY THE HELL ARE THEY REWORKING HIM BEFORE CLOWN, LEGION, AND CANNIBAL?!** WHO ON THE DEV TEAM ACTUALLY FUCKING WENT AND THOUGHT *"HMMM, LET'S FIX THIS C TIER KILLER AND NOT FUCKING TOUCH THESE F TIER KILLERS. SOMETHING SOMETHING PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR"*
---
No, it‚Äôs more of the limitation of an analog. Fps isn‚Äôt as bad as it once was. 
---
BHVR just needs to unlock the mouse / keyboard function.
---
Good to know they‚Äôre on top of it. 
---
Good luck out there in the fog!
---
I've been considering it, but I'm still a bit on the fence about it, sorry!  
---
~~mostly I'm just scared of trying new things whoops~~
---
As a killer, I definitely try to kill those who unhook close to me and put their teammates in danger.
---
Still no optimization patch since the ST Chapter fucked up the frames and stability. All I ask is that features on PC are brought to console. If both don‚Äôt happen before the mid-chapter patch I think I‚Äôd lose all hope on any type of serious console support coming from them.
---
Lol
---
It's funny, first match of the day was an Oni. Rank 3, btw. I would believe that a lot more people would play him, but I believe that not many people own him yet. He's a shard killer, though, so it won't be long until everyone will have him.
---
At rank six I‚Äôm surviving against the Oni about 70% of the time.
---
Ye but I'm not a spirit main

Just use Self care and bottany with a medkit and you'll get  benevolent iri every game as well as do 2 gens and you're purple, it's way too easy to cheese untill purp as surv :D after purple you can't rank up that easily though
---
2 weeks? That's insane. They need to pause the rank system until this is fixed. They need to do SOMETHING
---
You too! Hope to see you out there
---
Still faster then the rest of ya lol
---
He looks like a goblin.
---
They said in the patch notes it's a known issue and would be worked on fixing.
---
I would also like to mention we had to wait for the next chapter to get a fix for a cosmetic we were forced to pay money for
---
Legion just needs a full rework period I have fun playing them and even can do pretty good majority of the time they are just vastly underwhelming. Def dont need them to go back to prenerf broken shit but they should just striaght up full rework power change. I think if vaulting the pallets was just in their basekit not needing to be in frenzy would help,survivors would have to actually be weary of throwing pallets and landing the stun
---
FENG GANG RISE UP
---
There most certainly is limitation on consoles, and pretending there isn‚Äôt is very disingenuous. It takes away a major part of why he‚Äôs good on PC.  Sure, against inexperienced survivors that have awful movement, he can put down a beating.  Experienced survivors can turn on a dime and loop simple walls against him on console.
---
&gt; He made it seem like he was defending the other person's point by saying that pc's have 30 minute queue times and every killer is tunneling... 
---
Not true, he said "Yeah but" and that shows that he agrees with you but then he asks YOU "can you get camped by tunnelling Ghostfaces and wait 30 minutes for a match?" and you can see that he is asking you if you can do something because he said "CAN you". And after that it is obviously a joke because nobody brags about waiting for 30 minutes long. So now I know for sure that you are stupid.
---
They need to fix it quicker. And to make up for it give all players a few tiers on the rift, because players who paid for it including me, are not gonna play until it's fixed.
---
Hopefully not as opposition üòÇ
---
It also makes people ask "Why the hell is a fisherman in a creepy hospital?"
---
I agree completely... just like most of the player base. You're not saying anything new. I see these complaints literally every day. My friends and I don't even call the game by name any more; we just say "the buggy, broken game" and everyone knows what we mean.
---
Problem is, as much as we all bitch and whine, people will keep playing because ~~they're having fun~~ the game is one giant ball of addictive gambling mechanics. (Ever notice how much of the game is random chance? How often do you have a crap game and then play another because "maybe the next one will be better"? I know for me, that's like 4 out of 5 games. And that's exactly what gambling addiction sounds like.)
---
Unfortunately, as long as BHVR can keep abusing addictive behavior to rake in cash, there's simply no reason for them to care about bugs, how toxic their community is, or if their junkies are even having fun. And that's never going to change.
---
Once you reach rank 1 with either killer or survivor it stops mattering, i hit rank 1 killer before reset so ive been playing more casually with non meta characters &amp; im constantly getting "Thats why you're X rank, you'll never be Red ranks" "Enjoy being X rank forever" when i 4k with bubba
---
Not a big deal, you'll pick up on it eventually.
---
Understandable, but numerous people have tried to correct him and he just either ignores them or just writes them off as a troll. To make it worse, the build he ‚Äúcreated‚Äù has been a popular Wraith build since the Nurse came out so it just makes him look silly.
---
KIllers already are abusing the living  fuck out of it.
---
I have yet to win a game since yesterday üòÇ
---
Still fun tho!
---
Lol as a survivor!
---
Actually happened to me earlier. "Hook 2 survivors in the basement with Agitation in a single game".
---
I run agitation + iron grasp and I get 3 down there within 2 minutes due to some mistakes. Was really confusing cause they started running into walls down there and stuff. I understood why when the bug happened to me later.
---
I agree, I even made a post on it
---
Mending was considered different than a healing action and wasn't affected by that stuff. Nurse's wouldn't work on a mending person
---
guess I just do not agree with you guys saying he is bad but hey opinions are opinions after all. I think ppl are just judging him to early but it is fair enough
---
Yes, this is a complete shitstorm. Now people are not gonna be queuing for Survivors, so Killer queues go up and no one is playing the game soon enough.
---
True. It ha been ages since I was season 2 so yeah. I was trying to make links, my bad.
---
I honestly think that they are in serious need to create a large dedicated console team.
---
I haven't checked recently, but I had to lower my graphics settings in the past because Hag traps absolutely tank framerate... and my graphics card, while not top of the line, is only two years old.
---
They won't disconnect no more when BHVR is gonna nerf them again next patch. Right? ;(
---
You know you don't have to mori them, right? "Kill by any means" means, uh, by any means. Sacrifice, mori, bleed out... anything.
---
The oni sucks major dick on console
---
The beginning of this clip makes me wish we could play survivor in first person, it'd be so much scarier.
---
You that‚Äôs oni when he one hits you with his power
---
How is this a discussion it‚Äôs more of a rant then anything else
---
He‚Äôs not uncounterable so I don‚Äôt understand why you propose changes which would make him actively less fun even though he already is? If the changes made this patch didn‚Äôt happen and the change you suggested actually went through, not only would the killer be less fun but the things that made him uncounterable in PTB would still exist like the pallet break, flick and recovery.
---
I never said he was bad, he‚Äôs just very meh on console. Can destroy poor moving survivors and get his lunch handed to him by experienced players. Also, this isn‚Äôt opinion. It‚Äôs literally beyond him to have the same movement on console as PC.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for three hours on PS4 as oni and he sucks donkey balls.
---
Not like this game is graphic intensive anyway, so a two year old card should perfect be fine. Smh.
---
Is he tunneled you? no
---
Is he got cocked by ds? Yes
---
fair enough
---
I'm surprised to still see Spirits try and fake windows even though she has an animation now
---
Wow, why is this downvoted? Shoot the messenger much?
---
Tomorrow they will start to suicide on the hook!
---
No it isn't, it *used* to be.  It's entirely situational and is really only useful if the doors are open.  And even then you would have to be unhooked for it to even be active, it's essentially a wasted perk slot for the entire match except for that one time it might be useful.
---
Last night my buddy was blinded after getting unhooked but it was fixed after he left the basement and jumped back down
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
GO STUDY IT WILL LAST WITH YOU FOREVER WHILE THE RIFT WILL NOT.
---
How did you get both of them like that?
---
Hah right. I forgot about the whole, "DC penalties"
---
Nah imma just hook em down there anyway. Ain't gonna waste one of the thousand hooks near by
---
Yes, that'd be sick
---
remember window infinites? that was fun to play against
---
Literally three videos ago Monto posted video of him dying and losing kobe challange.
---
I HAD AN ESSAY TYPED UP, BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, EXCEPT TO SAY I SYMPATHIZE. I'LL JUST ADVISE - ASK FOR EXPLICIT FEEDBACK WHEN YOU DO WELL ENOUGH. IF YOU EARN A BRONZE STAR, GET THAT BRONZE STAR. YOU'RE HUMAN - IT'S FINE TO NEED IT. YOU DON'T NEED A PARADE, BUT I REMEMBER A TIME WHEN MY MOST RECENT POSITIVE FEEDBACK WAS MONTHS AGO, EVEN WHEN I WAS WORKING HARD ON THE CUTTING EDGE.
---
THIS WILL EAT AT YOU PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY. AND IF THEY RESPOND POORLY, LEAVE. YOU WILL SURVIVE SOMEHOW. OR YOU MIGHT NOT. BUT IT'S BETTER THAN TURNING INTO THAT THING YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF BECOMING.
---
I very much like this idea, but I have a change I think would make it more fair and better.  At the start of the game, the player spawns in as the legion, and 3 other legions are hidden in lockers. At any point, the player can go up to a locker and press the power button, and hop into the locker. The player then selects which legion they want to go to, and they hop out of the other legions locker. If a survivor opens a locker that a legion is in, all survivors are able to see the aura of that legion for 10 seconds,and the legion player gets a noise notification.
---
The time it takes a legion to hop into a locker is the same speed it takes a survivor to quick enter a locker and when leaving a locker they have the option to fast exit, where the survivors can hear the locker open and the heartbeat, or slow open, where the locker is very quiet, and in addion, when opening the locker slowly, they get undetectable for a short period (3-5 seconds).
---
This would allow both uses for stealth and sneaking up on an unsuspecting survivor, and use in chase, as quick exiting while a survivor is nearby would allow for an easy hit.
---
I think this would be really fun and would also make it so you could set it up so you can completely corner a survivor while not breaking the game.
---
The legions add-ons could affect the speed getting in and out of lockers, the stealth of getting out, and maybe their ultra rare could put a survivor into the injured state if they open a locker a legion is in.
---
The poor optimization of the game is easily hidden on PC, considering you can upgrade your gear, and generally have more computing power than current consoles.
---
oni's like "...is it ok to be attracted to ur cousin?"
---
I‚Äôm more concerned about the wiggle bar bug at this point :(
---
That‚Äôs fine, but solo queue survivors shouldn‚Äôt need to play with low ranks. It makes no sense
---
It‚Äôs not always about balance , people DC because they‚Äôre the first one to get down . Had a time where I was playing billy and I had a full map long shot chainsaw and the guy just DC on purpose
---
I also have the same question as I‚Äôm considering getting a refund on Nancy. Don‚Äôt really use her and regret purchasing her.
---
No, we dont.
---
Yes, *we do.*
---
Can someone tell me what mine is? And if I don‚Äôt have one how to add one?
---
It's not useless. I wouldnt remember what the issue was without it.
---
I mean, I‚Äôm pretty sure with an adapter you can still use M&amp;K. I have a friend that bought one for games like Overwatch and COD, and his works on DBD as well.
---
Rotated Rin &gt; screenshot &gt; Photoshop
---
I expose injured people as GF for the CLOUT
---
Lol I'm not that cruel. I've had a couple that purposely loop me around the basement knowing its glitched. I'm not going to go outta my way to hook em down there cause I don't want the game to end that quickly
---
I had this exact issue on Badham Preschool IV yesterday.
---
So much hype about it leak, but let me cool down your enthusiasm a little bit.
---
1) Getting rid of stances is good thing, but
---
a) Problem with closing down loops lays not in stance switch, but in huge slowdown while charging Shock Therapy, delay on hit and range of it. If that slowdown, delay and default range  will stay same - things will not change whatsoever. Doctor's one slot will always be occupied by range addon.
---
b) removing Treatment mode removes Doctor ability to get instagrabs, which is only his unique technique.
---
2) Replacing Static Field with Static Blast has its downsides and they overweight upsides (and I cant see any so far tbh)
---
a) Static Field works as ultimate tracking ability, especially when you look for survivors who hasnt been touched by Madness yet, 6 seconds in Field and survivor screams. Blast do not fulfill that role completely, cause it will obviously have cooldown and it has less percentage of madness inflicted than Therapy. It means that if you used your Blast and didnt hit anyone, you lose your tracking for a cooldown time, which yet to be known, it can be 10 seconds or even more, as we all know how BVHR work with numbers. (they cant judge them properly). So you can easily go past survivor during cooldown time if you are actively moving through map.
---
b) Field works in TR no matter if survivor on the same level with Doctor or at lower/upper floors. We yet to know if Blast will keep that mechanics. (Once again, knowing BVHR, probably wont)
---
c) Field madness build-up tied with TR, so if you run TR increasing Perks and Addons, survivors which are pretty far away still get a lot of madness passively. Blast with cooldown and lesser than Therapy Madness build-up will be inferior to current Field.
---
3) Blast properties is mistery right now, but I'm almost completely sure that Blast will not apply Shock Stun on survivors it hits. Means in terms of helping in chases Blast will be absolutely pointless. Yet again if Blast will have charge time to release after cooldown it will be even more worse.
---
3a) If Blast will apply Shock Stun it will have charge time and slowdown on top of cooldown which will make it horrible in terms of tracking.
---
4) Removing Exhaustion part of King and Obedience is actually a big nerf comparing to substitute of counter-clockwise skillchecks.
---
5) Judging on Calm addon cooldown time on Blast will be pretty long, I doubt they will make whole addon lineup just to reduce your TR for 5-10 seconds.
---
TL:DR
---
Judging on leaks I'm pretty pessimistic on Doc's upcoming changes. Beeing Doc main for a long time I'm expecting him to be gutted as Legion was (twice).
---
Thank you!! I couldn‚Äôt see well enough in her picture!!
---
Freddy does not a need any kind of Boost or Buff of any kind right now. He‚Äôs top 3 overall.
---
Which is a good thing. Illogical and outlandish imagery produces anxiety. It taps into our fear of the unknown and it breaks the established norm which is, ‚Äúcreepy fishermen shouldn‚Äôt be in hospitals.‚Äù Same reason why things like Stranger Things S1, It and It Follows are scary.
---
Whenever I see Ghostface peeking around a corner at me I get scared :(
---
SHOW RANKS AGAIN ON LOBBY SCREEN!!!
---
thats not wraith, thats oni with an instadown ready
---
Things like that have happen like no exhaustion or running like sonic forever  when hit , etc but they got patched up
---
Ah, okay then.
---
I thought this was another bug that came withthis update.
---
When this happened to me, my game auto-struggled once I got to second phase. Very strange!
---
Yeah well like 3 people have told me it‚Äôs gonna get removed üòÇ thought I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry
---
Those are for scrubs who want an advantage over others. 
---
The game literally recognizes when you have a mouse / keyboard plugged in. The devs just chose to lock the functions I guess.
---

Agreed! I'd also like to see Legion totally reworked (now more than ever, after their recent gutting) so that they're actually a Legion, as advertised. The other gang members (whoever you're not playing as) need to spawn in to assist the player-controlled Legion in some way.   
---
Whether that's downing injured Survivors, inflicting Deep Wound on healthy ones, or just carrying survivors to the hook, waiting near a gen, or sprinting across the map to scare survivors with a terror radius, there's so much room for creativity. Their worst designed killer with the most uninspired power could become their best with the proper rework. Emphasis on PROPER because what we got just recently made them worse.
---
Right, but how do you know it's poorly optimized compared to other games? By looking at FPS performances or some other stuff?
---
...you are the only person i have seen in a few days say something positive about this game
---
&gt; I don't understand, as a software developer, how things that are completely unrelated to changes that were made get totally fucked up in updates.
---
As a software developer, this is why we have both internal and external testing phases before releasing products.
---
&gt;If you want to loop me
---
i can't go any further than this. get naenae'd
---
I mean at the rate my oni is going with trying to get merciless and majority of my games is 2+ toolboxes the game was gonna end quickly regardless for me.
---
U mad bro?
---
I understand that AI would be hard to work on and making NPC's for an only multiplayer game, but yes I think it would be so worth it. Before the year is over I'd LOVE to see this happen. These are such good ideas.
---
just picked him up and played him last night. spotted the dwight and was blown back like oh shit we hunting
---
Omg I want the suzie sweater! But I also want a Yui cosmetic ;-; Decisions suck
---
In the original post? Complaining about matchmaking. In the comment? Literally what i said, remind you that i would have ended up first.
---
Well, it's much harder, but with patience you can still open the gates. Just run away when you see him coming
---
WHY DID THEY REMOVE THE EVENT COSMETICS FROM THE UPDATE, I NEVER EVEN HAD THE CHANCE TO EARN THEM! WHY DON‚ÄôT THEY JUST PUT THEM IN THE STORE! WHY DO PEOPLE CARE SO MUCH IF EVERYONE CAN HAVE NICE THINGS!
---
No, just disappointed
---
MY SURVIVOR GAMES YESTERDAY CONSISTED OF, IN THAT ORDER: 
---
‚Ä¢ TUNNELING DOCTOR
---
‚Ä¢ HOOK-CAMPING GHOSTFACE
---
‚Ä¢ HOOK-CAMPING GHOSTFACE #2
---
‚Ä¢ HUNTRESS WITH IRI HEADS PLUS A MORI
---
‚Ä¢ SPIRIT WITH BEADS AND YAKUYOKE 
---
AFTER THAT LAST ONE, I CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT I WASN'T GONNA BE HAVING ANY FUN THAT SESSION AND JUST STOPPED PLAYING.
---
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK PEOPLE, WHY MUST YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO SUCK EVERY OUNCE OF FUN FROM THIS GAME? THE VERY NATURE OF A GAME IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ENTERTAINMENT, AND THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE OF THAT TO BE FOUND IN THESE KINDS OF GAMES. LITERALLY THE ONLY ONE HAVING ANY FUN THESE GAMES WOULD BE THE KILLER, SO 1 OUT OF 5 PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY.
---
AND NOW PEOPLE ARE ACTING LIKE THE PROBLEM WITH DC'S IS NOW FIXED ALL OF A SUDDEN THANKS TO THE NEW PUNISHMENT SYSTEM. WELL GUESS WHAT, THE PROBLEM IS STILL GONNA BE THERE, AND IT WILL STILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE CAN ACTUALLY QUEUE UP AND ACTUALLY EXPECT TO HAVE A FUN EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE AS THINGS STAND, PLAYING SURVIVOR AND FACING THIS BULLSHIT ISN'T FUN, AND DOUBLY SO FOR SOLOQUEUES.
---
I don't think he's weak, not by any means. That's why I didn't touch his base kit. I wanted to make some bad add-ons worth the BP and to remove Forever Freddy while keeping the ropes useful. Base Freddy is fine, but a chunk of his add-ons are not worth it.
---
Yikes. I thought BHVR was like 30 people.
---
**I agree with your main point** and most of the rest... But calling Demogorgon trash tier is ridiculous. Back when he was released, most streamers were comparing him to Huntress. His map pressure is strong and becomes downright obscene toward end game, and shred is like giving Killers Dead Hard‚Äîthink you're making it to that pallet? Think again. No, he's not part of the OP Trinity of Nurse/Hillbilly/Spirit, but that's hardly a bad thing.
---
And while most of his perks suck, I love Surge. Again, it's no OP meta Ruin, but it's a solid slowdown perk, especially on stealth Killers that can one shot before Survivors get far from the gen they're working on, and fun AF for shit to explode when you down someone.
---
I completely agree. Gen speeds have been an issue now for a long time too. When will this stuff be fixed!
---
It‚Äôs a big nerf to legion because of that , think of this way , a power that isn‚Äôt really lethal and can‚Äôt down you , you get DS stun when you get out of your power and if you miss your hit you lose your power . Now that they made that you can sprint it won‚Äôt go down , survivors can run to the edge of the map to mend rather than just lose him and mend because the timer won‚Äôt run out . It‚Äôs gonna be crippling for legion right now as he‚Äôs just useless.
---
What else is there
---
I mean I agree. But games these days are just overall better with M&amp;K. Especially when PS4 controllers are so damned awful. DBD significantly shortens the already short lives of PS4 controllers, 360ing isn‚Äôt easy or always consistently accurate, keeping your camera in the right place during a chase isn‚Äôt very easy. 
---
If I could play on PC I would. But I still can understand using M&amp;K for console DBD because dear god it‚Äôs just horrible on a controller. Since I started playing almost 3 full years ago I‚Äôve gone through about 7 controllers, all taken care of and handled carefully, and DBD was the primary game being played on them. Shits expensive and not worth it.
---
I get what you mean, but trying to figure out the full story via comments I just see the same things, and also.. that anyone that memes or says "HoW dId YoU lOoP fOr 8 mInUtEs??!" They get downvoted to hell, quite funny ... But my stroaght up opinion the tome challenges make people play like idiots/assholes yet.. is that really all that different from regular gameplay at Green and low purple ranks? Honestly? And I mean red ranks just isn't fun it's a lose lose really.
---
This is blursed
---
they needed to bust out those spirit nerfs faster they had no time for testing otherweise survivors wouldve cried louder and louder
---
The game Is still full of bugs, I'm not satisfied, I see bugs ingame that exists for ages.
---
That's why I play like 5-10 hours a week, than 20-40 like I used to.
---
Sorry that happened. I love playing against Legion!
---
&gt;&gt;The best does not equal good.
---
Sure, but I‚Äôd take imperfect stats over subjective hearsay which is worse imo.
---
&gt;&gt; it is possible to evaluate the data provided, though
---
And the evaluation is that it is imperfect, therefore we should resort to personal experience which is even less reliable because it is too subjective and has limited sample size? 
---
Not to mention the self-selection bias when people try to find others with similar experiences to support their argument/increase their sample size... then it becomes a contest of who can shout the loudest.
---
&gt;&gt; It includes 1ks that turn into 4ks because of suicide missions. It includes people who died from memeing. It includes pity sacrifices. It does not consider survivors who would have escaped if not for a rage quit.
---
So the stats are imperfect. We and many others know this when looking at those numbers.
---
Question is:
---
(1) Why are you so sure these factors are significant enough that the stats cannot be relied on?
---
(2) What‚Äôs your better alternative?
---
I guess so. But I‚Äôm mostly just worried for myself because I hooked like 5 people in the basement the day the update dropped. It‚Äôd be really dumb if I got penalized without knowing. Only one person in end game chat told me what happened and then I stopped. The rest just ran in circles and for some reason I didn‚Äôt make any connection
---
I always like seeing another Shugoki main.
---
I love the Legion. They‚Äôre completely different from all the other killers and it‚Äôs fun. They‚Äôre loveable little brats.
---
That said, playing against them is a slog when it should be fast-paced.
---
If you want to loop me (Play the game as survivor) than I'm going to exploit you to death.  Basically sums it up.
---
All they needed was to be wearing bloody pants and bloody head to make it perfect.. yet.. there is something so unsettling of seeing 4 bills just... Hovering there .. in the same fucking sweater... Just staring..
---
Boo hoo :'(
---
From a distance i thought oni was finna busta cap in her ass
---
He feels like he'd be better suited in Mortal Kombat.
---
I mean fair, but face it. Most people are going to use pallets and the slow down addons like ropes or chains. Almost no one uses pill bottle or red paintbrush anymore. Honestly they shouldn‚Äôt have added the oblivious effect to him, paint brush should have stayed what it was and then been given the oblivious effect as well. Pre rework Red Paint Brush was a monster and his BEST add on. 
---
I miss my old Freddy. I actually liked him and had fun with him.
---
Double pip depends on rank.
---
Can't unsee
---
I think you're underestimating how bad code has to be for every damn change to cause game breaking bugs.
---
With competent programming techniques like modular coding, automated unit testing, etc., etc., so many bugs that are so serious just straight up shouldn't be happening, let alone making it into the final release.
---
Because Red rank basically rewards/encourages selfish behavior. Especially if you want pips. It‚Äôs unfortunate, and it didn‚Äôt used to be this bad.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm talking about thank you! I couldn‚Äôt remember what the hell they were called
---
That‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôre to rough with yours. 
---
My main issue is that survivor has a serious advantage with controller, especially if killer has to use one too. 
---
Simple, flawless 360s. 
---
Killer is stuck with analog limitations to the point that 360s actually work. 
---
It‚Äôs fucking broken and nobody seems to understand. But they are finally coming around to ‚Äúoh maybe this guy was right 3 years ago‚Äù because of Oni.
---
Even worse sprint bursts into their arms
---
Imagine being so trash at the game it requires exploits for you to get kills.  Big yikes man.
---
Ofcourse it's not an intended feature. Even the things we wish were intended features in this game turn out to just be bugs. If BHVR were to reply to this post, it would probably be something like "We are aware of this issue and it is on our to-do list", at the tail end of the massive list of bugs they need to fix.
---
His beatin‚Äô bat is so difficult to hit if a survivor has any idea of what they are doing
---
I also agree, maybe it‚Äôs an issue with my sensitivity but he‚Äôs very difficult to control during his demon dash. Makes me really sad because I think he looks great and has a pretty sick power.
---
bruh
---
I think MoM should give stacks for protection hits, rescues from the killer's grasp, and when you achieve the "distraction" thing. That way it encourages you to stay near team mates and protect them in various ways. I think it should also be that once you have all 3 stacks the next time you round be put into the dying state it would instead apply deep wounds  (which you'd obviously have to escape to mend) and the broken status affect until you're placed into the dying state.
---
Would be nice if killer mains would just refuse to reward this behavior by taking out the farmer instead of the unhooked.
---
shit meme
---
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt let me kill you the moment I see you, I‚Äôm gonna exploit a bug.‚Äù
---
How can you tell that it's flat?
---
Maybe it just changed shape :^)
---
As long as a full team is alive in a match with me I'm sitting at 30, sometimes lower. This definitely makes a huge difference.
---
And then he charges and crashes into a wall
---
Warframe is the only other game I know that releases things with major bugs, but they also release patches quite quickly.
---
(Warframe also releases on PC first, irons out the major bugs, then releases on consoles)
---
Imagine getting kills to stay in the same rank before the glitch.
---
Yall really do make some stupid insults sometimes. This is the part where you say "found the facecamping bubba"

I don‚Äôt think there are flairs for this sub just yet bud, but to be fare I was also unaware that flairs were only visible on mobile.. seeing as I don‚Äôt own a computer..

unfortunately i'm only just hearing about this now, and it explains why survs in my games last night were acting so weird, i had a laurie on the hook in basement and when i hooked another surv across the map my BBQ showed that the laurie was just standing there, and they didnt react to me at all when i came back, i was afraid i had some super bad lag or something.
---
Source?
---
I SPENT MY SHARDS ON ONI BECAUSE HE WAS FUN TO PLAY IN THE PTB, BUT THE SEEMINGLY SMALL NERFS WHEN HE WENT LIVE RUIN THE MANEUVERABILITY THAT MADE HIM MORE FUN THAN HILLBILLY. NOW HE'S JUST A HILLBILLY THAT HAS TO CHARGE UP HIS POWER AND THAT SUCKS.
---
ALSO HE'S SO LOUD I CAN'T HEAR SURVIVORS AND EVERYTHING IS SO DARK NOW THAT I CAN'T SEE SURVIVORS. WTF BHVR? WHY? WHY? [WHHHHYYYYYYYYY?](/intensifies)
---
Harder daddy

I slug the farmee and go after the farmer. Enough time for the teammates to help get the farmee back up on their feet, but still slowing the game down a little bit and taking advantage of the survivors' ineptitude. It's often pretty stressful being a killer, I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth but also I'm not gonna immediately rehook a survivor because I know how bad that feels.
---
This is cursed as shit!   
---
*Somewhere in an alternative universe* : This is Blessed as Piss!
---
Oh? Your approaching me?
---
So if you want to fix it, you have to be in comms with the killer. This is a good PSA because I wasn't aware, but at the same time I don't see how most people will manage to figure this out without comms.
---
How is me calling you out for admitting to intentionally exploiting survivors to death me saying anything remotely stupid?  You admitted to that garbage knowingly.
---
Next patch they will remove all ability to injure or grab any one as doing something with your knife is way to op
---
By comparing actual performance / looks and needs of the game with other titles
---
ALSO, IF YOU PLAY FOREVER FREDDY I'M GOING TO DC AND NOTHING BHVR DOES CAN STOP ME. FUCK YOU, FOREVER FREDDY.
---
I'd say Nurse is scary, especially for new players who don't know what the fuck is happening
---
well look at the bright side of things, BT works against freddy now... sort of. The person unhooking still needs to be awake.
---
GO SPEED RACER GOOOOOOO!!!
---
Can i join you? I'm tired of hearing them
---
I just saw another post about this and agreed, his turning on console is really, really difficult. It‚Äôs embarrassing just running into walls while chasing after a survivor lmao. Let it be known though that I usually don‚Äôt play killer as often as survivor, and when I do, I play ghostface. Idk like he looks super badass and his ability is badass but on console, it‚Äôs insanely hard for me, personally, to control.
---
legion and pig both.
---
Hey, a fellow pre-rework Freddy fan! My personal favorite was Class Photo because I loved the information it gave despite its downside 
---
The oblivious was a dubious change because of BT and reduction of useful perks (IF is no longer a good perk on him).
---
RPB staying the same and gaining oblivious would've been cool to see, and possibly make jump scare Freddy scarier.
---
THEY DIDNT THOUGH RIGHT? I GOT MY GOLDEN FENG YESTERDAY
---
Im not entirely sure about the whole X Files theme, but I love the survivor perks, and I was wondering if I could use them for a fan made ideas compilation. You'd be credited
---
We often do.
---
But it's not really on the killer to police to make sure survivors aren't being assholes to each other. And it's not a 'reward' if the farmer takes his teammate out of the game super early and they're a man down. 
---
I find it funny that even when an issue is literally a 'survivors being assholes', some of you will try to blame it on killers!
---
Yeah, but that‚Äôs not the main problem. It is a big problem though. Frames drop to 5 when you bloodlust, gens pop or multiple things happen at once. 
---
The bigger problem is not having real control. Survivors have to deal with shit frames too. They just have an advantage over killer.
---
Even though your opinion isn‚Äôt very nice, i still appreciate that you felt the need to comment on my post. Thanks and have a good day.
---
This sounds like the Nurse all over again. Next time remember the PTB is on PC and any changes may not be good for consoles. I'm not saying don't buy the new characters just don't go overboard until you try them out. And yes, the "no refund option" sucks.
---
Chears pall
---
It was though wasn't it,  adrenalin cleanses it as well and it states HEALS you one health state
---
I've been here long enough to see that everyone gets banned for exploits. Fucking give the devs actual information and proof and they ban people.
---
The Killer can try to add some of the survivors. Won't always work but it may be the only way to get help if this happens. Worst case scenario survivors are able to hold the game hostage until the Killer has to disconnect.
---
Hol' up.. are Joey and Susie an actual Canon thing? I swear that was just Rule 34 shitposting! Wait.. Cote you sly bastard..
---
Looks pretty good
---
Nice dude, congrats
---
No as I said, I‚Äôm VERY careful with mine. It‚Äôs the left analog stick every time, because wiggling. Wiggling is already funky because it fresquently just pauses on controller for no reason. I even just stopped bothering to wiggle most of the time a long time ago just to save the controller. It‚Äôs a common issue in the PS4 controller and DBD is just specifically very hard on it. 
---
And I wasn‚Äôt disagreeing with killer limitations. I see it myself whenever I play killer. Hence why I wish I could use M&amp;K. It‚Äôs just better for both Killer AND Survivor. Im merely saying it‚Äôs rough for both, but anyone who can get the hang of 360s on a controller will be able to doge the vast majority of killers. It‚Äôs why a lot of Killers on PS4 just stand there and wait now. Lol
---
This sounds like a you problem. I haven't had a single issue with him. His dash is much like hillbilly including the turning. He's really just Billy with a little leather face mixed in
---
Dude same. I went to Lery‚Äôs 5 times in a row last night. Only one of those times someone brought an offering
---

Picture took 10/31/18
---
It‚Äôs never really too early to judge anything as long as you collect enough information. After earning all the teachables on Oni and Yui, I would say he is strong but not over powered.
---
His early game potential is one of the weakest because he must injure to use his power. Gen rushing and stealth teams will dominate here. During this phase of the game he is very likely to lose 2-3 gens pretty quickly.
---
However, once he unlocks his power he is easily stronger than Billy and can snowball. Blood Orbs will start collecting throughout the map, so Oni will be able to repeatedly activate his power with less need for injuring.
---
Once again, during his power he struggles against stealth, so not getting caught can waste his time and his power. Where you heal and how fast you do it matters. Healing under hook without we‚Äôll make it is a bad idea as he can just collect orbs for his power. Healing by completed gens or corners forces him to waste his time. Doing generators while injured could end the game faster, but it runs the risk of giving the Oni his power.
---
Essentially Oni plays in two phases, very weak and very strong. The first time you exit the very weak phase it becomes easier and easier, so you spend more time with your power ready as the match progresses. Combining the two makes him a strong killer, but not over powered.
---
WHY DO I KEEP GOING AGAINST RED RANKS. I'M IN THE GREEN RANKS FOR FUCKS SAKE.
---
it‚Äôs actually kinda pretty lol
---
But if they‚Äôre sprinting so it doesn‚Äôt go down, they‚Äôre not doing anything productive, which I thought was the entire point of his power? Like, were people getting downs with his power before? The non-lethal aspect and stunning was a thing before, I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs made worse. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been stabbed by legion, he goes to chase someone else and I just sat on a gen till his terror radius was gone. Now, I have to mend before anything else. I think there still something I‚Äôm not understanding on why this change makes him worse
---
If the survivors smart enough he wont get hit by it lol. Its not hard to dodge him. And half the game you have 0 map pressure because your ability is gone
---
The problem with MoM is Endurance, devs making the activation counter productive is just a way to keep the perk dead until they can come up with another effect. 
---
They tried safe unhooks + protection hits and it was even easier to activate it than being hit by basic attack 3 times.
---
Yea I should‚Äôve known it was yet another bug. Thank you!

Some of the survivor chats have been filled with salt and people dc'ing because "oni is op" in my games.
---
I'm like dude it's barely been a day and you're already ragequitting. Bothers me when some players just don't even try to learn counterplay. (I say that as a survivor. I haven't played him yet).
---
Well there are only t gens
---
I have two words for you: Regression Testing
---
Can I get the clip art of that cat please?
---
I really like the line work in this. It actually looks like something BHVR would create for a little icon such as offerings it addons.
---
My theory: Mid-ranks have a lot of players that were put there because they ragequit all the time, and now they're getting temp bans and that's giving the lobby less to work with.
---
Dude, people playing remnant have reported constant frame rate drops on Corsus and Earth, and people's save files are STILL getting corrupted.
---
I love that game too, but it's kind of held together by glue and dreams as well.
---
The thing that hurts him most is less mend time and his attack not counting as normal so no more sloppy butcher of save the best for last stacks
---
I got to level 38 with 1.1 mil
---
...does that mean the killers being friendly with the survivors will be in character too? Or am i hopeing for too much?
---
Also I know its not good quality, but I thought it looked good with the perspective and me hiding out of the side of this house.
---
Ah, okay.
---
Class Photo and Paint Brush = IF YOU SEE ME ITS TOO LATE Freddy. 
---
I was a Freddy Main before his rework. Took the time to learn him, test perk builds, and practiced for a long time to be viable. He was the only killer other than Spirit I was able to reach red rank with. I miss him so much. No one ever believed me when I said I found a way to be effective with him. Until they tried the build. Lol
---
Wow. Nice job bhvr.
---
So good! I love it
---
That's just because he's new.  Once people practice a bit more with him that won't be an issue.
---
I can't protect the shit out of you without getting closer.
---
no his turning is different on console, you can't flick well, its seems like a bug because you can curve with billy on console
---
For context:
---
1st: getting hit throught pallets, Sure I can understand that, dedicated server fucked me there cant do much about it.
---
2nd: No wiggle bar, literally couldn't wiggle. Pressed every button nothing happend.
---
3rd: Getting send to the void by getting hooked in the basement.
---
I don't know how they managed to fuck the game up this badly with the update but this is just ridiculous, time to take a break from this game till they fix it, very sad.
---
Sorry that happened. I don‚Äôt normally play survivor but when I do I try to never dc. Only dcs I have are from internet shitting itself or the power. When i play survivor I love to see how people play each killer so differently
---
i dig it
---
Nope
---
Yeah But Feral Frenzy won't
---
Food break Bubba is a much more effective camping strategy than basement Bubba.
---
&gt; ~~this dlc is almost like~~ the team forgot about the console players.
---
I fixed that for you
---
Having a SWF as any matching survivor is intimidating but squads of bill and Ash definantly intimidate me most
---
Leatherface has a lunge in his swing, and it looks like he caught ya in the split second before you dropped the pallet. 
---
Sorry, OP. I know it's frustrating.
---
Thanks! Gotta love my boy David
---
THERE JUST IS NO PLEASING PEOPLE IN THIS DAMN GAME.
---
I PLAYED KILLER AND CAME OUT OF A MATCH TO SEE ONE SURVIVOR BEING NASTY TO ANOTHER SURVIVOR IN THE CHAT. I SAID, DON'T BE TOXIC, AND *THE SURVIVOR THAT I DEFENDED* BEGAN MOCKING ME FOR TRYING TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD.
---
NOT TO MENTION THE COUNTLESS GAMES WHERE THE SURVIVORS SWARM THE HOOK 2 SECONDS AFTER UNHOOK AND/OR START LOOPING AROUND THE DAMN THING WITH THE PERSON STILL ON THE HOOK, AND OF COURSE I COME OUT TO THE CRIES OF "CAAAAAAAMPERRRR!"
---
\*VISIBLE CONFUSION\*
---
That‚Äôs not even the biggest problem here
---
LeMmE sMaSh
---
But it didn‚Äôt go down in his terror radius before either, so it basically only went down out of chase and range. It paused while mending before too. Now people can‚Äôt sit on gens in his terror radius and only mend when he goes away. Swapping terror radius for sprinting doesn‚Äôt seem like a huge change to begin with, and it sounds like a buff to me. Am I missing something?
---
I think clown is really good .. he is just super unfun.. imo.
---
If they're swf then it's not to death. Just guide them out and make em fall. Boom fix. It's a hook, the hell I look like a nice guy?  Mister Rodgers ? Imma put you where I want you. If where I want you is glitched well tough titty.
---
Demogorgon if u watched stranger things 100%
---
Looks great
---
am i the onlyone that notices that there is a dwight in the background shaking his head?
---
Good job getting to rank 8 on killer :)
---
Thanks! :D
---
He‚Äôs an m1 killer that can run fast sometimes that‚Äôs it he‚Äôs B tier at best (base kit).
---
Dedicated servers, I know. But the main focus should be on not having the wiggle bar prompt and not being able to wiggle at all and being send to the void via basement hook with literally 0 counterplay.
---
Alright fair, but I think it‚Äôs easy to hop on the ‚Äúhate bandwagon‚Äù. The devs clearly care about their game, and don‚Äôt WANT to ship buggy content. I guess I‚Äôm mostly confused as to the point of this post? Like, what‚Äôs it trying to accomplish. It‚Äôs just gonna get lost in the sea of other complaints to BHVR about bugs. Furthermore, saying ‚Äúgamebreaking bugs every update‚Äù is a bit extreme man. In recent memory, this is the only slightly gamebreaking big I can think of.
---
Yes, but let's say the killer is also running ruin, haunted grounds, and devour. In this case, slow cook could only get one stack
---
Yea it's rough even with friends to do that lol
---
Listen to this guy, he's totally right.
---
Yui has more cosmetics at launch than Adam has total.
---
Yeah I understand that part. What I don‚Äôt understand is why the sprinting thing vs terror radius thing. I‚Äôve seen lots of people act like that‚Äôs made his power worthless and I don‚Äôt get it
---
"Look who's shitting in the tall grass!" 
---
"Kiss my grits!" 
---
Me as the killer wanting them to ready up: *Demonic Screeching*
---
At this point, he should just be removed from the roster. Blood points spent in him, as well as cosmetics, should just be refunded.
---
What exactly does slugging mean?
---
thats why we prestige him so we can feel we got another cosmetic
---
Yeah, Oni is definitely not fine tuned for console.
---
I believe the new systems are both backward compatible so we should still be able to play the same game using the new systems.
---
Then come as close as you'd like!
---
Fuck Quentins worthless ugly Down syndrome ass anyways. Bill the man
---
Copied what?
---
So double down on the cheating thing.  God damn that's pathetic man.  If you ever want to be able to play the game without having to cheat to get a kill pop onto YouTube.  Tons of videos that teach us how to play without exploiting.
---
Some of the challenges have you playing in a selfish way and some of them have them killing yourself to save your team. I think it's a decent variety.
---
There's nothing really wrong with objectives that mak you play selfishly though. This is a team game yes. From the very start though, BHVR has said they always want that element of the player having to choose whether he wants to save his friends or save himself. There was always supposed to be a little selfishness involved. The game is ultimately about *survival*.
---
Ok.
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA

---
Well with trying to fix everything is really hard, sometimes new glitches will appear and it will always happen in programming games and trying to fix stuff, i'm pretty sure they are working on it.
---
And it wakes you up, and waking up isn't a healing action. Mending is different than healing, the devs  have made that clear for Legion since day 1
---
BHVR: "We don't care, but won't be able to do anything if EAC bans you"
---
EAC: "We don't care as long as it doesn't affect gameplay, but won't be able to do anything if BHVR bans you"
---
It helped legion can catch people  by suprise , cuz when they weren‚Äôt in terror radius they had to quickly find a spot to mend while now they can run near team mates or gens being done and med near his team so if the killer come they can protect him/her.
---
Rancor, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, and something else, idk.

\[MEG DEATHGARDEN MASK FOR CONSOLE PLAYERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\](/intensifies)

---
*Ash: Ah oh! Augh! OOH!*
---
If the timer was lets say 15 seconds you can sprint around for a minute then immediately mend and the timer will still be 15 seconds but the killer can‚Äôt see the timer going down so he might think ‚Äúoh this person hasn‚Äôt mended yet‚Äù when in actuality the timer is going down. It‚Äôs a nerf because it pretty much makes deep wounds useless for killer since it never goes down even though they have to mend its like 10 seconds to mend and it doesn‚Äôt show up on nurses calling so from a killer stand point its a nerf from survivor its a buff.
---
Thank you

That bit I missed - damn, that is bad.

At least Freddy's  viable. Poor clown
---
Not what I said. There are people who are specifically looping the basement because killer are trying not to hook down there
---
Man this game is a mess right now, wth
---
THEY COULDN‚ÄôT HAVE JUST MADE IT SO THAT NEMESIS DIDN‚ÄôT AFFECT DEEP WOUND, THEY HAD TO NERF THE PLAYER AND NOT MAKE THE PERK A LITTLE DIFFERENT. IT‚ÄôS LAZINESS AT THIS POINT.
---
The new Xbox will be fully backwards compatible, so no problem. ps hasn't confirmed that yet but I would assume the same
---
Claudettes Mori looks cool
---
Two insults, one thread, not a world record but you're trying. Anyway, while you keep thinking that, I'll keep playing like normal and still do fine. Oh wait hooking people is normal. You'll live, just like how I lived with the sprint burst glitch and maybe the wake up cause I didn't know that one existed. You'll live with this one.
---
 Bye sweetie doll
---
And your solution is then to lobby dodge these groups? If everyone did that they‚Äôd never get to play. It amazes me how little this community cares about new players sometimes. I enjoyed having visible ranks because it let me set my expectations before a match. It‚Äôs exactly your kind of mindset that caused the devs to remove the bug/feature to begin with.
---
cuz people think solo survivor is the worst thing on earth
---
[I'm sorry, but it's too late](https://youtu.be/WYOAuSkPthI?t=22)

Don‚Äôt throw games please
---
Ooof, I played Legion recently (doing the Deep Wound daily) and someone was actually downed from their Deep Wound. I was stunned and had no idea where they were because I didn‚Äôt have Deer Stalker.
---
Well there's 2 whole challenges in the Archives further incentivizing killers to do, so I wouldn't count on that
---
the hillbilly one kinda reminds me of the legion

Stop farting so much
---
Great that other people complain aswell, the more exposure it gets he faster (hopefully) they'll fix their game and make it actually playable again.
---
Just use both thumbsticks, I don't know what you all mean, it's the same as on pc
---
That‚Äôs honestly the only thing they can do. There‚Äôs the stupid auto aim that leads attacks into nothing. 
---
And yeah. Left analog, top right dead zone. You‚Äôre pushing to hard and bending the components inside. PS4 controllers aren‚Äôt weak. But they break under constant pressure. I fucked up my magma controller, but my original black one still works. You won‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre doing it unless you consciously think about it for a while. 
---
And instead of slapping the stick left and right to wiggle, just rotate. It stops the wiggle because you do it to fast.
---
if you can do the objective then you're better than most player lol
---
It‚Äôs litteraly about survivors being op when the game came out with perks and infinite‚Äôs saboing
---
Had an argument about incorporating a trap into the Trappers Mori not long ago. Apparently is DOESNT make sense because ‚Äúwhat if he isn‚Äôt carrying a trap? Can‚Äôt just pull out something that doesn‚Äôt exist!‚Äù (***Cough GHOSTFACESCAMERACough***)
---
I kinda like how Wraith drags the survivor back by the ankle already though. It‚Äôs just the beating them to death that should be changed.
---
I understand you‚Äôre giving a pass for the pallet swing, but good god that was fucking awful. It literally doesn‚Äôt even connect with you on your screen. I‚Äôm on console so I haven‚Äôt touched dedicated servers, but I would‚Äôve been super pissed with that down. And that‚Äôs not even considering the other two things lmao.
---
Be sure to link me
---
That I think would be fine in relation to the AI need, however, you have to remember balance. Survivors need to have a way to determine which lockers might have a legion in it, and based on your description, I assumed that seeing the legion go into the locker would be a kind of way for the survivors to see the lockers they have to be cautious around, while still having the stealth of being able to surprise survivors who did not see the legion spawn.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love this idea, and I wish it was in the game! It's just kind of an unconscious habit of mine to analyze stuff like this. 
---
Again, I love this idea, and even with poor implementation I feel like it would be better than legion currently is! :)
---
I have an alternative to Anarchy, Hex: Misery loves company- Spawns 2 hex totems, when one totem is cleansed, survivors within 20/25/30 metres are afflicted with the Oblivious status effect, the effect is only dispelled when the other hex is cleansed.
---
I‚Äôve been so frustrated lately, keep screwing up match‚Äôs and getting teabagged at the gates and pallets. It‚Äôs really nice to see your post. &lt;3

ONI IS TRASH ON CONSOLE. MAYBE HE'S A BIT HARDER FOR EVERYONE AFTER THE NERFS BUT IT'S LIKE MOVING IN MUD WITH CONTROLLER. 
---
I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE WILL POWER THROUGH IT AND MAKE SOME ADAPTATIONS THAT PC PLAYERS WON'T HAVE TO MAKE BUT IMO HE'S HONESTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO USE AND THE FRAME DROPS WITH HIS POWER AND BLOODLUST DOESN'T HELP!
---
ALSO, REVERT WHATEVER THE FUCK MADE MAPS SO DAMN DARK. I HEARD IT'S ALL MAPS BUT THE NEW MAP IS ESPECIALLY AIDS. I HAD A MATCH AGAINST 2 ADAMS AND A CLAUDETTE ON THAT MAP AND IT WAS DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THEM. EVEN LIT UP SURVIVORS CAN JUST DO A LOOP AROUND SOME BUSHES AND I WOULD LOSE THEM!
---
AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT ASS PERKS YET AGAIN!? I THOUGHT BREAKOUT WOULD BE AT LEAST GOOD BUT THEN I QUICKLY REALIZE THAT THERE'S MOST HOOKS ARE 5 INCHES APART FROM EACH OTHER! NEMESIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPACTFUL ONE BECAUSE WHO THE HELL NEEDS WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY ON A KILLER AND BLOOD ECHO IS SO DAMN PASSIVE TO USE AND HONESTLY NOT THE GAME CHANGING, ESPECIALLY IF THEY JUST HUG POWERFUL LOOPS ANYWAY.
---
I'M STARTING TO HATE THIS PATCH!
---
&gt; constant nerfing 
---
lol okay dude
---
This has been a complaint since the first nerf to it came, and it‚Äôs still an issue. The only way to get MoM is to throw a huge majority of the game taking hits and healing to take more hits. 
---
I‚Äôm personally going for the body blocking achievement, and it is the only time I will ever run this perk. It just wastes too much time to activate.
---
I HATE HOW THIS JOB IS AFFECTING MY MENTAL HEALTH, IVE BEEN FEELING SO DOWN AND I SURE DONT WANT TO COME HERE EVERY MORNING.
---
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE, I WAS THINKING ABOUT STAYING FOR HALF A YEAR AND THEN LEAVE, IS NOT WORTH LIVING IN THIS HELL AND I HOPE YOU HAVE GOOD WEEK

I don't think 4 skins will be done, I think they will pick either Julie and Frank or Susie and Joey as all 4 has never happened all at once(to my knowledge)
---
The controlling isn‚Äôt too intuitive you kinda have to move both sticks in the same direction to move well. Wanna go left both sticks hard left, same if you wanna go right, if you wanna drift you point them either towards or away from each other. It‚Äôs confusing at first but not that bad not like it matters because his dash is really just to run across the map not really insta down anyone.
---
3.7.7 Patch Notes:
---
Grant's the unhooked survivor the mori animation of the killer, and kills the farmer. Both Killer and survivor receive points for the kill.
---
Curious as I haven't tested yet: doesn't this mean that unless you are holding sprint during a chase with Legion, your deep wounds timer will go down?
---
Does this mean it goes down when dropping pallets, vaulting windows and pallets, and falling?
---
A dull totem, though?
---
I'd rather they work on a generator-at least it would be useful.
---
Do you all need some of my special doctor approved barbecue and chili to help with those disturbing premonitions?
---
The darkness is insane now. People can just hide mid chase and it's so dark on some maps they basically turn invisible. Might have to start using different brightness settings on my monitor if they don't revert it.
---
Get rid of noed before last gen
---
Well I'm right in this case. his latest upload from the time of my comment refutes the argument of the person I replied to so you can't rly argue against me on that matter.
---
I am also wondering this
---
This happened to me in a match against a spirit on gas heaven last night. All of us were getting farmed off hook by a dwight before the spirit could fuck off. Safe to say the match was over pretty quickly.
---
If you're ever looping anyone with a flashlight next to a slug just fake the pickup and see if they try to cj tech it. Either that or look away from them and hook the slug. They usually don't have enough time to get into position for a save.
---
The last one was genuine advice.  Cheating in video games is something a 6 year old would do because they don't know any better.  This is just too sad and trash for words.  And people abusing Wake up glitch were scumbag cheaters too.  It isn't different because it is survivor vs. Killer.  Cheating is cheating no matter what side of the aisle you're on.  And no when you know full well those hooks exploit players to death you are not "playing the game normally by hooking".  You're just another cancerous exploiter doing their best to make this community shittier than it has to be.  You people ruin the game.
---
I don‚Äôt see why not he‚Äôs honestly pretty fun. If he looks interesting to you I would
---
I disagree
---
Lol. DCing on legion still. 
---
Granted, I still have bitter thoughts about her. I only consider not playing the game when they slap me with fury twice then chase me til I‚Äôm down 3 gens later.
---
I already said I don‚Äôt play rough with the controller. I take good care of it, I don‚Äôt slap the sticks around. But I play every day and as I said before, DBD it s basically the only game I play. And since DBD is a game that I‚Äôm doesn‚Äôt help the analog sticks, naturally the controller doesn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt last. After I realized the first time that it was the analog stick wearing out because of wiggling and 360s I took the care to be more gentle, keep it cleaner, and be careful with it. Still happens. 
---
And also no, PS4 controllers are VERY VERY weak specifically in the analog sticks. They always have been. It‚Äôs a very common report/complaint that has been happening since PS4‚Äôs launch. There‚Äôs plenty of complaints online to back that up too.
---
Are you on console or PC? Personally I didn't really have any issues with it but I've seen some complaints.
---
Exactly BILL Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill bill
---
A little ambitious for BVHR to be able to do it tho
---
You'd end up with a buggy mess that's even more unplayable since they don't actually bother testing or optimizing
---
It'll always be a body
---
I'll try to remember. If you want to see it in its current state, dm me your email and I'll share it with you
---
i was about to post the same, its way too darker than any other map
---
They can shove it up their arse, they already have two cosmetics in every slot
---
Do you have a dead zone on the top right of your left analog?
---
I think everyone hates Yamaoka maps. 
---
Huge. Grassy. Weird tiles. It stinks. I think Sanctum is better than Residence though.
---
The legion are angry teenagers...
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve spawned right in front of or next to a hex in the last week is amazing. If I don‚Äôt instantly see it I can hear it. I feel bad every time.
---
I think adding new objectives would make more sense then slowing gen speed down.

My laptop is 2 years old, pretty good, and can handle Destiny 2 raids perfectly without stuttering until it really starts heating up (The laptop) and everything‚Äôs exploding. DBD is a constant stuttering mess.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT IT WAS LOVELY AND GOOD LUCK IN FUTURE MATCHES

name a killer who has received significant buffs in the last couple of patches even though they are completely unviable at a high level i.e. Clown, Bubba, Hag, Doc, Trapper, Myers, Huntress (Lets see how long iri head stays as it is), Freddy, Pig, Billy, Legion - I'm looking forward to your answer and about discussing the subject

But legion wants people to stick together? That‚Äôs when his power shines the most? And how did he catch anyone by surprise since no one needed to mend in his tr?
---
Stop bullying Legion D:
---
yeah, that‚Äôs how I was really able to control it as well as I possibly could in the first place. Maybe I just need more practice, I guess we‚Äôll see.
---
And killer mains say survivor mains complain...
---
Three, 40 more and it might break the world record. You done? Cause you're wasting both our times, well really yours.

Funny how you call me a man child but youre the one continuing the argument and name calling because youre mad i don't agree with you I saod lets drop it so drop it

Gotcha I'll just let you go back to your busy day of cheating in video games.  Have a good one you insanely skilled super mature player you.
---
Imagine being a blendette and not having DS
---
He is very hard to control on Ps4....Its not the same as on PC
---
F13 is different....they got caught up in a legal battle and who knows how much money they are spending to try to satisfy both clients in the court case. A better example of failure because of shit devs would be Lucas arts and Core. Seems unless things change soon, bhvr game will disappear too
---
I always accidently push into red ranks till i just want to quit the fucking game.
---
Why do you ask? I've put together a [video](https://youtu.be/5hhQaQ-f-z4) with some memorable clips from the last week to demonstrate it. #shamelessviewsfarming
---
lmao this dude is so wrong. red ranks is just sweaty and overly competitive to a point of not being fun
---
Spending your time destroying and looking for every dull totem just in case they have NOED is a waste.
---
Jason and Chucky and I will never request anything from this game again..........maybe Pinhead too.
---
oh
---
Billy doesn't need a buff, Huntress doesn't specifically need a buff, but the maps need reworking as they are too large for most killers and it hurts her a lot.
---
Nurse needed the add on nerf, they went a bit too far though and made her no fun to play.
---
Spirit didn't need a nerf imo but at least it's minor.
---
I agree clown, Pig and the rest could do with buffs though. I also think they should fix GF though as his reveal is completely busted.
---
Well yes they do but its kind of time to speak up for the killers because of not as stated above the game will become a compelte shitshow for killer which would result in the same thing just with people not comming back. In my scenario you would still have the playerbase look at the game and hopefully come back to playing killer when it is fun again.
---
But it never went down in the terror radius either. If someone is running around for a while minute so their timer doesn‚Äôt go down, that‚Äôs a full minute not doing gens, not doing totems, not healing anyone, not doing anything. His power forces people to not do gens
---
Here comes Freddy with the RKO!
---
You see I want to give them props but with all these new and reoccurring bugs I think i'll pass this time.
---
I just don‚Äôt play killer anymore. The game is so stupidly survivor sided that there‚Äôs games that no matter what I do, I can‚Äôt win. Why would I want to keep playing a game I can‚Äôt win sometimes, regardless of how well I play?
---
There‚Äôs also the fact that I‚Äôm forced to use Ruin every match to even have a chance at the red ranks. Even though the totem gets cleansed in the first minute 90% of the time. I hate that 1 perk will always be in my build.
---
Survivor is WAY less stressful and easier. If the killer comes, loop. If the killer isn‚Äôt around, do gens. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt even use items at the red ranks. It feel unfair
---
IKR xD
---
Yeah I get it. Some maps suck. Haddonfield and farm maps for the killers and swamp, underground complex treatment theater for the survivors.
---
I just don't like it when people dc because of bad rng. Sometimes youll have to play the shitty maps. That's just how it is.
---
Only times I dc is when someone is hard camping or tunneling. Not gonna waste my time with that.
---
I'm not blaming killer mains at all.
---
Just suggesting that, when you see this, don't reward it. 
---
I wish BHVR would make it possible for us to deny a hook save.
---
My controller right now is new so no.
---
My issue is with the analog stick just making me turn left randomly. If I stand still and then hold the L2 button it makes my character walk forward. It‚Äôs a common issue. The only way to fix it is to replace the parts with a soldering iron. I‚Äôm well aware and of what causes it. Again, it‚Äôs a very common issue amount PS4 controllers. It‚Äôs how almost everyone I know has had their controller break, and that‚Äôs for people who don‚Äôt even play DBD either.
---
Wow after three insults, a compliment even tho its shade still.  Look how you matured.
---
No. don't waste time looking for totems but if you see a totem, break it
---
Thank you!, wish killers didn't get fucked been saving for a good perk
---
&gt;We often do.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;But it's not really on the killer to police to make sure survivors aren't being assholes to each other. And it's not a 'reward' if the farmer takes his teammate out of the game super early and they're a man down. 
---
&gt;I find it funny that even when an issue is literally a 'survivors being assholes', some of you will try to blame it on killers!
---
It kind of stinks being at the mercy of random survivors and how friendly the killer is, in my experience the killer is more than happy to hit me again and instantly get me on second hook. I think DS is really frustrating to go against as killer and usually encourages ridiculous risk free plays, but idk what else I can do to protect myself in those farm situations.
---
Good to see someone getting my point. About minor details with if billy needs a buff or not its another discussion but this post is about the big picture. Thanks for your comment i appreciate
---
Yes, I'd absolutely Dodge these groups because a high rank player doesn't belong in low rank lobbies. There is no problem with new people, but the thing is that new people should also be playing with other new people, not someone who's put in a considerable amount of time into the game. That's what the rank system is there, my guy. If we can't expect to play with people of equal skill, then we just get an unbalanced mess of frustration.
---
Dude you don't get to cheat in video games and then ride a high horse.  That's just self unaware Michael Scott level cringe.
---
Nah, if you miss your skillcheck that's on you.
---
I had the bug happen to me but I thought it was just a one time thing. I spent an hour yesterday trying to put people in the basement lol.
---
I guess I'll stop for now
---
Fuckin Hex: Anarchy is killer, goddamn. This whole concept is awesome, I am so ready for a killer that does locker stuff!
---
First time hearing of corrupted save files issues. But again, DbD had similar issues, no? With skins or progress disappearing. 
---
I also didn‚Äôt experience any major frame rate drops. My Remnant experience was very smooth. I remember some trophies were bugged when I went for the platinum, but that‚Äôs about it. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt saying Remnant was bug free, but it‚Äôs still a very beautiful game. And their team is smaller than the DbD team, keep that in mind too.
---
From what I heard he‚Äôs really bad to control on console
---
Well, End Game Collapse was for sure a buff for the Pig. 
---
Survivors are basically dead if they reach End Game Collapse with the RBT on or if they‚Äôre downed during that time. Unless they can miraculously find the hatch.
---
I really wish we could have an official game mode with two killers in a game at the same time. It would be so chaotic but so much fun. Like maybe 2 killers and 8 survivors? To maybe keep it from being too chaotic they could limit everyone to just 2 perks and 1 add-on. Killer combinations would also be really fun -- like Trapper and Hillbilly, or Nurse and Doctor. 
---
Or maybe instead of killers cooperating, they're competing against each other for the entities favor. Like killers can hit and stun each other, like Wraith stepping on a bear-trap. Maybe they can have hooks on their own side/corner of the map and steal survivors off of the other killer's hooks?
---
Or you know, you could just get face camped by two Leatherfaces instead of one.
---
Ah. Idk why they do that. I‚Äôve only seen Xbox controllers do that.
---
&gt; ut the maps need reworking as they are too large for most killers and it hurts her a lot.
---
I would like some reduction in trees
---
They just gonna chop the servers like they did death garden.
---
So long and thanks for the moneeeys.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, and I‚Äôve had fun with him so far. You‚Äôre not going to get mouse+keyboard accuracy, but he‚Äôs definitely playable on console.

Gens really get done to fast. But they need to think of something else. Sitting on a gen is the most boring thing in the game.
---
I‚Äôd rather have another objective added than increase the gen time.
---
2 v 8 would be so fun actually
---
Thanks for your comment. I completely agree with you. And as you said - not playing killer - thats exactly my point. But many people have to do it in order to get queue times unbearable high in order for the survivors to complain about them so the devs will do something sadly.
---
Well she does ride a motorcycle, there's a reason for that muscle
---
Killers not receiving buffs is not the same as constant nerfing, for starters. Your argument there isn't even your original thesis.
---
Then you mentioned Freddy who objectively received a huge buff.
---
and iri heads are broken sooo
---
Nope. Trust me. Not on his current state.
---
Well giving me a lecture about my skill after an update not knowing jack about me before it doesnt really make ya obligated to say I get no kills but here we are now.
---
Fs happened to me too. WhY Devs!?
---
I think gens should only be slowed for SWF.
---
I get it. tbh i couldn't fathom the frustrations killer mains have. I serious thought crap some people are bonkers and need more hugs. Lol. Screw that i played killer for a little over 2 days and was twisted up and pissed. Now that i walked on the killer side i refuse to add to that toxic crap. üòä
---
Depends on if the shock blast affects his entire terror radius. You could set up some mean 3 gens.
---
F13 is not different. I‚Äôm talking about before the lawsuit made it so they couldn‚Äôt make content, the game was a riddled, buggy mess. Every time they dropped new content, the players seemed to forgive the devs for the mess of a game they had. Until people complained about new game breaking bugs, which were forgiven and forgotten about when new content dropped. It was a cycle. 
---
DBD is the exact same thing. The game is filled with issues, which players forgive the devs for every time new content drops. Until the new bugs are shown, people complain, and the cycle repeats. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going to kill the game, but it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that they don‚Äôt hire outside help. The F13 devs had the exact same incompetence. If you cannot handle the work yourself, then get help. Both companies had more than enough cash to ask for help.
---
However, it states the waking up part, while it doesn't state the deep wounds part
---
People will treat me like trash when I‚Äôm just playing for fun and I‚Äôll hook them, and only them, in the basement ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You do realise survivors are constantly getting nurses as well right?
---
It does stink, I agree, but if for whatever reason a killer isn't 'friendly' - maybe they're not controlling the game as well as they hoped, and need to get someone out of the game quickly to slow things down - don't blame them if they take advantage of the situation. It's still the survivor's fault, not the killer, it's just EXTRA nice when they go out of their way to NOT take advantage of it.
---
So people I did some math, and I figured out even though I had 4 tokens, it only counted me for having 1. Don't know why, maybe a bug? I still haven't seen if it happened again, will later today though.
---
I really want the thing

All I can say to this: lol
---
I'm rank 1 killer and had to depip to green ranks to even have the opportunity to remotely try it, lets be real you stay 1 more second than necesary near hook and you wont even get the achievement even if you 12 hooked them
---
i have managed to do it for every single killer and it burnt me like crazy with some killers like hag was easy as hell but try it with killers with cuestionable persk and you gonna have a bad time
---
Happened to me. Played trapper, who is only level 12, and forgot to run Agitation on my first game. I hooked 3 different people in the basement. 
---
Second game as Trapper everyone would just sprint away from the basement even if it meant they were going into a dead zone.... I‚Äôm just trying to do a challenge :/
---
Sloppy Butcher doesn't affect mending. It only makes healing take longer.
---
They haven‚Äôt turned it on yet, patch notes says they start tomorrow
---
I don't think 2 v 8 would work, a killer normally chases one survivor at a time meaning 2 killers chasing one survivor each means that there are 6 survivors doing gens and also body blocking  hooks would be very easy for survivors
---
We still love you don‚Äôt worry. This is why we kept your corpse close to us &lt;3
---
I don't know why, he is really fun to play on console
---
Gen rush will never be fixed, devs stated they have no intention of changing gen times
---
Don't they just run off basic scripts? It's been a while since I played the tutorial, but I remember them doing very specific routines each time. They were also coded with the small, special made map in mind.
---
HAHAHAHAHA nice joke.
---
Your skills couldn't be anything remotely respectable if you're the type of player that stoops to cheating.  Exploiters are the cockroaches of the video game community.  You guys ruin the game for everyone involved.  There is no justification or defense for that.  You're obnoxious attempts to deflect on that is the only reason this thread is still going.   But I admit this has went on far enough.  Nothing will change.  You're a cheater and completely unapologetic about it.  I'll let you get back to your exploiting.
---
That's honestly insane.
---
Haven't played in 2 days now, so far the twitching urge to return is weakening
---
ProStrat: Don't chase the same survivor.
---
If they said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve discovered several game breaking bugs and are fixing them before release, so there will be a delay, sorry for the inconvenience.‚Äù, people would be way more understanding.
---
....How are you missing the skill check on it now? Even with Unnerving Presence I believe it's still bigger than the old DS normal skill check and people could hit that one all the time no problem.
---
I don‚Äôt do it so the devs will buff killers or nerf gen speed. The devs will never balance the game at the red ranks. They‚Äôre too afraid of pissing off survivors since most people play survivor. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not even bothering with killer anymore.
---
Survivors get like 50 crutches in a game while killers can‚Äôt afford to make a single mistake. You know there‚Äôs something wrong with the balance of the game when people WANT to be chased. Because they know the game is broken.
---
Just don‚Äôt bother with killer dude. Honestly
---
I DONT LIKE THIS
---
Which Freddy buff are you talking about? Do you mean his rework which was a good rework since before he was even worse? But yet Freddy is still not a good Killer at a high level which is kind of my point here.
---
I got bitched at before because I refilled my bottles with clown after I hooked them. When the hell do you want me to refill those things they take forever with no add ons
---
If you miss a skill check that big you deserve to get cucked

Remember the optimisation patch that BHVR promised was coming to consoles... in December 2018? One year later and I still see no sign of it.
---
BHVR don‚Äôt give a shit because they‚Äôre milking every penny they can from the game with more DLC, more cosmetics, and a battle pass. They even added extra monetisation to the battle pass by adding paid progression, lmao. As much as they talk about supporting the game for years to come, the only ‚Äúsupport‚Äù they throw at it is more and more microtransactions. Never mind the bugs and the glaring issues with balance as long as they‚Äôre adding their weekly $10 skins.
---
Leaving survivors in the dying state
---
That i can ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù understand,  bhvr at the time probably underestimated how powerful survivors could be.
---
As in my opinion playing the game early on is harder as a survivor than a killer
---
she got that inner strenght
---
Oh man, what a giggle. I think I'll put on unnerving presence next match to get you some practice.
---
Alright we get it:
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not camping if there are other survivors around the hook‚Äù
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not camping if you go and break a pallet or a gen around the hook‚Äù
---
We get it. The same meme doesn‚Äôt need to be reposted every three days in a different format.
---
Oh i see...then the answer is simple. Dead by Daylight is going to die faster than the vicious Fortnite assraping of Pubg
---
Wait was there an optimisation patch promised? Because it indeed does ring some bells.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the final kiss of death for PS4 controllers. Literally the only thing you can do is firmly tap down on the stick to center it again. But that just is a temporary fix and makes it die faster.
---
As i said i play both roles and from now on i only play survivor and to be honest i dont see a lot of nurses anymore since the nerfs. She is still playable and the add-ons needed nerfing but her base power should not have been touched which is probably why i rarely see her anymore these days.
---
What rank and what role?
---
Your posts are amazing üòç
---
It‚Äôs a free shirt already available on him
---
Have you every played killer in 2016-17? This game has come a long way in terms of balanced gameplay. No one is CONSTANTLY nerfing killers
---
it's free! You automatically have it in your inventory :)
---
Yeah no. That's retarded
---
I gotcha Hadonnfield is a bit better with the BL nerf but before that playing on that map repeatedly within an hour of gameplay just had me tilt because of how hard it is to catch people if you aren't nurse, spirit or trapper on certain spots. If I'm having a bad session and it's the same map 3 times in a row and they didn't use offerings I either afk or quit it's a bad habit. Yeah corn maps or any maps with a lot of foliage on console is some of the worst experiences you can think of.

You already have it just check the torso cosmetics

my ass trying to figure out where tf I am with all the bamboo, statues and fucking trees everywhere as a survivor
---
While I do agree with OP about this being a severe bug, at the same time....bugs DO happen. To think that any software company releases perfect, bug-free software is a fallacy and yes, even things this obvious fall through the cracks. In this case though it was a pretty obvious last minute code change that happened between PTB and Live, so we couldn't even catch it even after extensive PTB testing.
---
Mistakes happen. Nobody is perfect. That being said, I think BHVR needs to make a public announcement of the bug, state their ETA for the fix, and warn killers who are INTENTIONALLY abusing this bug (e.g. people using Iron Grasp, Mad Grit and Agitation every match) that they will be penalized for doing so with bloodpoint and progression removal and even pemanent bans for egregious abusers.
---
All that said, it's been a little shy of over 24 hours. If this bug is fixed within 48 I think that's an acceptable turnaround. If it takes a week (or more) that is UNacceptable.
---
Yes you are right. I still have a glimpse of hope for the game though. And even though the survivors are more and thats why the devs will listen to them more often they still have to realize that there is no game if there is no killer and thats exactly the point im trying to make in order to make the game better overall
---
If both killers are chasing different survivors each that means there are six survivors doing gens
---
i was just thinking about this, they should also make it so its an active ability and u can stab the killer several times in the eyes until he dead
---
Bill be looking like a tank
---
So you glitch people cos your a salty killer? Fair enough
---
They need to add this back in
---
I don't. I still save and run the killer around. If the time comes for me to escape, I just wait out the endgame timer if they don't kill me.
---
No different than one killer with four survivors? Just doubled up. The gen count per map would be higher so rushing would be limited.
---
If it works, it works
---
Okay I‚Äôll try, maybe it just comes with more practice. Are you having trouble hitting survivors in the open? I feel like his lunge is really hard to hit, even if you don‚Äôt fully charge it up. The only time I could maybe get it is through windows and things
---
Jake mains (like me) Be like: 
---
O shit
---
Skillcheck aint hard to hit bruh ruin is way harder. I'll let myself get down on purpose just to hit and if I miss I'm dead. Tbh that's a lotta gamer adrenaline and it makes you focus and just hit it. Sorry if that's weird to say
---
I had a friend. He tried too hard for his own good. That is what got him. That is what led to Franklin‚Äôs demise.
---
Don't remind me :(
---
Well i would say both sides have it bad, sure solo can suck sometimes but then there are those survivors that always find each other and make life hell, so it sucks on both side.
---
Survivors can take so long to get BP, We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever gives at least a boost for that to get points faster. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to get early. You‚Äôre right about his other two.. That‚Äôs also why I said just that perk and not his other two. No Mither is useless except for niche meme builds. I haven‚Äôt even unlocked it because I don‚Äôt want it polluting my blood webs. And Dead Hard does require skill. But it shouldn‚Äôt take too long just to unlock WGLF, and that‚Äôd be helpful for leveling.

Thank you title for ruining the joke.

To answer your question about a popular game having that many problems yes. Go look at a madden. They‚Äôve had some bad bugs over the years and that‚Äôs one of the biggest cane companies in the world.
---
It's free?
---
I got him and got a few games in on PS4. His power doesn't feel right and was very hard for me to control.
---
Im leveling him to 40 for teachable, but I doubt will do anything beyond that.
---
His frame rate for me is god awful during demon dash and when charging demon strike randomly sometimes it'll tank the fps sometimes it won't and I'm on a Xbox one X other than that he's fun to us.
---
if u play survivor u should know that they actually take forever, gen rush its a thing, ive been there, but makin the gens take longer its not a solution, maybe addin other objectives, or make u search for spare parts or gas for the gens, i play both sides and find the click holding simulator boring af, imagine if that time was longer.
---
Time of day could be a factor. Most people are at school and work right now.
---
Yeah, I've gotten more flak for playing Legion than any other killer even though I think they're the most fun (and probably the weakest). 
---
 It's okay though because Behavior agrees with them and are consistently nerfing Legion, so we won't have to worry about wanting to play that killer anymore.
---
The new map's framerate is so fucking bad on console. It's like you have permanent corn vision to where it's not even worth trying to play on as killer.
---
what the actual fuck
---
There are at least 10 games I play that constantly release with major bugs. Some of which are released by major AAA studios.
---
This nonsense of "only other game" needs to stop.
---
Yes i have played it back then and it was a different story. It was unplayable as a killer because you couldnt catch survivors at all so yes I agree it came a long way but it is still far from being balanced. It is completely survivor sided. And im disagreeing with you - viable killers are getting nerfed.
---
Punishing people who just play casually with their friends and are still noobish isn't really fair. I understand the target is the seal team six swfs but that doesn't really justify punishing all swfs.
---
Oh thank you. Are all the sweaters free?
---
&gt; Freddy is still not a good Killer at a high level
---
didn't they just announce that Freddy was one of the [strongest killers](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/)?
---
Both killers are poopoo. High level play rapes them.
---
Survivor is pretty unplayable so either people just aren‚Äôt playing or just playing killer. Also people want to play oni which probably adds to that
---
If they're running to a jungle gym you can run sideways pretty damn easy, and charge his onehit lunge for a millisecond longer than you would a regular lunge attack (regular lunge with the sword) and it's overpowered. I never really dash and try to onehit like Hillbilly unless I know for certain I'll get it. Don't try to dash and attack if there's a lot of corners.
---
I mean we just passed no nut november so the worst time of the year is over for you, atleast people will be able to relieve themselves instead of grabbing the mori.
---
Ancest.
---
Hears the killer smack me and put me back on hook
---
***Everything's fine!***
---
Most people I have seen complaining about the bug and killers hooking in basement have been directly to killer players that are ‚Äúgetting revenge‚Äù because SB bugs were a thing and I don‚Äôt know what else.
---
Yeah, hook in the basement, most of the times in my experience when a game snowballs into an easy 4K it‚Äôs because I managed to hook in basement and altruistic plays bombed the team. The basement is a great and useful feature.
---
The issue I take is when people use this bug as an opportunity to further divide and make the player base even more toxic, either taking revenge because other survs abused other previous bugs or punishing behavior they consider toxic
---
I agree nerf ruin and extend gens
---
just Bill's, but you should find a bunch of other cosmetics in your inventory as well! The devs gave everyone a bunch of the old exclusives!
---
Oni be like
---
"I need to blow off some fucking steam!"
---
I've had more survivors angrily message me about sparring one player but not them, than I have gotten angry messages for killing everyone.  I understand that I didn't see the game from their perspective, and maybe the person I spared was a no good backstabbing layabout cheat, but I don't see how survivors don't see that I don't see that.  I'm not omniscient, it'd defeat the point of the game if I were.  If I spare someone that wasn't you, there's a 90% chance that it wasn't a personal slight.  You just drew short straw.
---
That way you deny safe unhook points too, double win.
---
OH I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THAT. RIP
---
Playing solo queue without DS is like opening your buttcheeks up at a truck stop gloryhole. 
---
You're bound to get fucked in the ass by some nasty people if you do.
---
its not supposed to happen on PC where you cant turn. its a bug. sadly, itll be nerfed. more equal for console players tho
---
That's high enough. So basically, the higher you go, longer times due to less players being in those ranks. Obvious enough.
---
But the recent matchmaking changes ruin it for high rank solo survivors because a survivor of your rank grouped with a lower rank survivor in their party prolongs the match making for high solo ranked survivors and low level killers.
---
Green Ranks always feel iffy to me on both sides when I drop down to them but it is a similar issue.
---
Im with this guy. He knows what the community wants.
---
Jakeist
---
Read the nemesis perk description
---
Yup, I learned him more I think. He still feels extremely awkward to use in chases but he's fun
---
Not according to the stats. Both killers have kill rates over 60%
---
Sounds Legit
---
They said it could be a week or two and I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre saying that because they want plenty of time. If they say in two days and it‚Äôs not done people will flip. If you say a week or two and it‚Äôs done in 3 days people will be much happier.
---
Now Deep Wound isn't scary at all, you just have to keep running and the timer will never go down.
---
Not many players will be playing around rank 20 that‚Äôs why queues are longer, once you rank up more get nearer to 10 your queues should improve. Players only reset so far back so you won‚Äôt run into many that way.
---
So dbd mobile is a fail if the waiting times on pc are that long I don‚Äôt expect to have good waiting times on dbd mobile even on release it sucks because I enjoyed the game but the waiting times are absurd especially for killer.
---
ahhh, i skipped the first part cause it usually doesnt mean anything towards what the perk truly does. thank you!
---
I haven't had any issue controlling Oni on xbone, I assume you are referring to the framerate drops when speeding up?
---
That‚Äôs just what I heard. I haven‚Äôt bought him yet cause of these comments :D
---
Strength of it was ireelevant, you just died with no options or counterplay. Old legion wasnt strong they just downed you in a preset amount of time with frenzy, its boring and has no counterplay is the issue
---
This is honestly as bad as the wake up bug from a few months ago.
---
yeah me too, i havent been killer in this map yet, but is great for hiding as survivor, maybe could be good for stalky or for darkened traps but idk, i also like the statues that follow u, the little chimes, its a pretty map
---
That guy has a large penis
---
Back when space billy was still a thing, I managed to fly past a pancake shaped moon, only to see the backside is* transparent.
---
As far as I can tell most of us don‚Äôt want PC players.
---
Also idk about you but many times when i solo queue people invite me to a party (console) so we basically have the same tools as a swf but we wouldnt suffer a penalty because we re all solo
---
WHY SPEND THE TIME AND EFFORT NEEDED TO MAKE WORTHWHILE CHANGES WHEN YOU CAN JUST DO THE EXACT FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND AS A BANDAID SOLUTION AND NEVER REVISIT IT?
---
Sure how do I send picture
---
Hey cops
---
Kill rate means nothing. Pip rate is more meaningful. Kill rate takes afk, bad play, stupid altruism, etc into account. Every killer is good if survivors play like ass.
---
You just can't be mithered with said Killers so the perk would grant you immunity to damage. /s
---
Can‚Äôt really comment on the nurse part cause I‚Äôm on console.
---
From my experience playing nothing has really changed lately. You see the same killers running the same perks. Same goes for survivor
---
This is just wrong. It has nothing to do with rank, for some reason everyone is queuing as killer right now even when like 1% of them are playing oni
---
I only played one match of it as survivor but I'm sure it's a different type of hell.
---
Just provide a link or dm me
---
Honestly, yeah. Because it has to be safe. Im like 90% sure this guy was running insidious though because there was no heartbeat when I unhooked her. Then all of the sudden, there he is
---
hitboxes arent that broken, its just people sometimes being stupid. except hatchet. hatchet hitbox is too large also there is lag between the host (who has the server) and the survivor, so getting hit at a window like 1m away isnt impossible.

Ok. I had that happen to me two days ago. A hag got me down and camped me on first hit until I almost died. Someone tried to save me and she downed them too and just stood guard until we died. What a shot move. I‚Äôm not a very good player, especially killer, and I wouldn‚Äôt even stoop to that for kills.  I‚Äôm a gentle killer though except that one time they left a baby Dwight to die on the hook when I don‚Äôt even remotely camp. I wanted all them to die.
---
It depends upon on the team, as a software dev we have teams working on parts of it, should be same with games, we have 4 people on updates for a 12 years old and 2 on legacy software that is 50 fucking years old, I think the bug fixing team is either lazy or they don't have one, it doesn't take any time at all to push a patch, prolly less time to actually identify and fix the bugs, I am pretty surprised it passed the PTB to actually cause problems.
---
I'm on Xbox one X and his demon dash and strike make the frame rate go down randomly sometimes it go down a lot sometimes it won't which makes it so inconsistent to keep track of where a survivor is turning which makes me miss at least 50% of my strikes. Really wish console had better optimization and kb+m support I would go back on PC if this game supported cross progression because at this point in the games life cycle I'm convinced they don't or can't optimize the game on console.
---
It should be under the customize option by default

There was indeed: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ah2aim/tell_me_lies_tell_me_sweet_little_lies/

Pip doesn't do much either though. It's incredibly easy to pip with Legion and Doctor, but they are ass.

What bad things did you hear?

I see this cartoon alot. What is it?

STUDYING IS BORING, I DONT CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE, I ONLY CARE ABOUT THE PRESENT. AND FUCK YOU BHVR.

that‚Äôs alright, everyone is running DS anyway
---
You guys really need to stop with the whole "Ah He DiDnT PlAy CoRrEcTlY!" And try to actually enjoy the game
---
Hell at least add something to the discussion instead of just pouting and saying "Meh, don't like it? Then don't do it." It's like the most useless argument out there used by people that can't take criticism.
---
Okay now I'm actually furious!!! This is unacceptable.
---
It's really a console issue which varies from console to console probably. I'm on a Xbox One X and during demon dash and demon strike charging the frame rate just goes from 30 to 15 or so which makes it incredibly hard to keep track of a survivor as you're about to demon strike.
---
This will go into the controversial section
---
Someone needs to photoshop in a boombox in place of the chainsaw and turn it into a video with Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" playing.
---
D‚Äôawwwwww
---
Pip means you win. You can get 4 kills and black pip.
---
Convince me that I can flashlight that thing and I still won't get close to it. Scares the crap out of me every time
---
Hurts my soul how you completely overlooked the leatherface and continued to comment about the pallets. Ffs it's not the end of the world, the gens got done and I kept him on me almost the entire game
---
Hatch was a mutual buff/nerf.  In trade for closing the hatch and forcing endgame collapse, killers can't grab jumping survivors and the hatch doesn't need 2 gens done.
---
Keys never got changed, they're just more useful.
---
Instaheals got needed last chapter or mid chapter patch, now you either have 16 seconds until a full heal or endurance for short time.
---
Many loops and infinites are being removed or altered with different pallet and window spawns, pus we now have bamboozle and Ishin(?) tactics.
---
Your only real argument is gen speeds, since the devs really can't do that much about SWF.
---
Coming from a person who's played a good bit of both sides killers are far from constant nerfs.
---
Using the auric cells to buy more tiers üß†
---
From my experience it's mainly when I get chased (especially getting hit), I look behind for a second and I'm already bumping into so many shits at once and that's when I get lost and no longer know where loops or pallets are. But then again, maybe it's just me being a big meghead lol
---
Then there's how dark the map is, I don't even wanna imagine playing as a killer on this map.
---
A great example of why the ranking system needs fixed. And you can also pip with everyone escaping. It's an unreliable, dumb system.
---
Freddy is a good killer no doubt about that but if i look at my experiences with him its kind of a 50/50 i have good games yes but i also have games where i cant do anything about how it is going to end because of genspeed and loops etc. in my opinion that does not make him a viable killer since a viable killer always has a chance to win.
---
Pandas in the charity case
---
It's a pretty map for sure, but fundamentally flawed. 
---
The main issue with yamaoka maps is they somehow managed to make a worse form of corn blindness, and it's indeed very hard to really see where you even are and stuff. 
---
Then there's a literal infinite loop with a perfect jungle gym right next to the shack(Several videos on youtube if you don't know what I mean) 
---
It's a good looking map, but there's a few problems with the map when it comes to playability
---
As a spirit main
---
I can only say you are right there is a reason Wraith is the leader
---
I despise it.
---
Mainly that and just his general control. It's like a constant battle with my controller to just point the camera while moving. Slowing down it's obviously better but still feels very awkward, especially when charging his attack. 
---
The shorter the chase and/or the more open the map, I'm sure it becomes less of an issue but trying to turn to a survivor that's actively 360'ing and juking, then charge your shot then turn with the slightly slower camera is wild.
---
Bloodlust adds another level of fuckery to this and I don't people will realize it until they go against survivors that can make the most of a jungle gym or the central buildings of some maps.
---
How will that fix it
---
Yeah it doesn't take skill to use the hardest power in the game other than nurses power.
---
Hazbin hotel. It's pretty cool
---
We usually do. But not every killer does. Just like the fact that not every survivor just "does gens" when one of them is being face camped.
---
I just think it‚Äôs too dark. And also the shrine in the middle just confirms that they nerfed Balanced Landing because they realized it was another infinite. And instead of fixing the map they just nerfed the perk. (Also meant they wouldn‚Äôt have to finally fix Haddonfield too)
---
I understand, and I HAVE commented on the ‚Äúkiller wishlist‚Äù threads before but I promise I‚Äôm being original. I think because ‚ÄúPerfect Organism‚Äù is the go-to perk name among hardcore Alien fans, that‚Äôs why it appears to be so similar.  Every diehard fan who also plays DBD knows the verbiage. Last time that I made a comment on similar posts it became a long discussion on how the Xenomorph could be balanced. My idea was to completely bypass the crawl and have it walk around bi-pedal like in Alien Isolation. However the devs could add ‚Äúvents‚Äù similar to the Demo portals which could allow it quick transit around the trail area. As you can see, I would really love if the Alien came to this game haha.
---
People have said everything got darker with this patch but the new map is definitely a new level of crazy.
---
Is it just me that thinks making something black and white makes it alot more scarier?
---
Would absolutely love to see The Creeper. Unfortunately with the director being a pedophile, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve seen the last of him.
---
Inca killer confirmed

Oh no, the one week I can't be online too! Anyone know of it happens to say Monday?

Survivors who don‚Äôt like strong killers: ‚ÄúX killer takes no skill lol‚Äù
---
I get it, you fucking sweat your nuts off every time you enter a match, try to have fun in the game once in a while. I didn't farm her, I genuinely believed I could take the protection hit (which I did, it's not my fault he walked backwards and got her too). All the gens got done and the exit gates were open, so stop whining ffs
---
Honestly I gave up on trying to depip back to purple rank, and I think the made it easier to pip in this new patch.
---
Ik people don't like this change, and I'm certainly not a fan of a legion (I railed against this yesterday), but it does seem like this could be better in the long run. 
---
Obviously a survivor can't just sprint around all day. Now, when you lose one, they can't just hide inside your terror radius. If they hear you, they have to start running or they will waste time. It definitely makes it a lot easier to find them. 
---
It seems like a shift from a "wound everyone for inconvenience" to "wound and hunt them down."
---
But I'm not playing him either way cause he's a mess
---
I agree. But don't let that distract you from the fact that Leatherface and plague can be gen rushed and looped into oblivion. Just because you describe good situations for them and they have 60% kill rate means absolutely nothing.
---
The game needs to be balanced with a 4v1 mentality. Idk, agree to disagree. If you think they are good and you like to play them, so be it, do you.
---
That's what i was going for
---
You get better control from using both sticks on Oni, unlike billy. (I think billy only uses one stick for control) Also don't use the dash for when you are close to a survivor, use his charged basic. (At least I think that's what I read, I am incredibly tired right now)
---
&gt; its kind of a 50/50
---
i understand. i have some of the same experiences as a survivor. against some killers i feel like i can't be stopped, others it seems like i never had a chance. that's just the way it is. if you expect to go in and 4k every time, you're going to have a bad experience.
---
Legion became Wraith.
---
Wow you can't really tell it's photoshopped, bravo
---
So was this legion invisible the whole game or what ?
---
If you actually looked at any of the stats given out in May and November, you‚Äôd see that the game literally favors killers, even in a 4 man SWF game. 
---
Insta-heals aren‚Äôt even a thing anymore. 
---
You have no grounds upon which to complain. You will be a lone boycotter.
---
*cries in decisive*

*cried in BL*

At least his cosmetics arent a bunch of recolours and they actualy look good ya know
---
I haven't noticed that tbh, but agreed the new map is a total mess on that part.
---
I've seen a couple of Onis but I wouldn't expect to see more until a week or so have passed.
---
Give people time to level up and get a full build on their Oni. Unless they're going for the Adept achievement they probably want to wait until they have non-garbage perks going against fully perked out survivors.
---
‚ÄúFfs‚Äù do you know what a loop is???? L-O-O-P... LOOOOOOP. This isn‚Äôt fucking pallet throwing simulator 2019...
---
Does anybody even play Oni? 6 games last night and no Oni. 4 trappers tho :D
---
Unless it‚Äôs a full team breaking hooks, I never even notice.
---
There‚Äôs hooks every 2 inches so it‚Äôs never a problem.
---
Sabo is next to useless outside of the rare occasion you 99% a hook and then break it as the killer goes to hook someone.
---
Two nights ago I was one of two remaining survivors against Legion in some swampy looking place.  This killer was pretty good and was kicking our ass all over the map....
---
The other survivor got caught and was barely hooked (2nd time) when I unhooked them ( I planned on taking the hit), but shortly after the unhook they dc'd... I was wondering why but I think I know now why they did? 
---
Did not know this was frowned upon.
---
nice pic. photo looks like its actually from the 70s
---
I WAS LIKE YOU 10 YEARS BEFORE AND I HATED MY ACTIONS AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE SOMEONE GOING LIKE ME SO PLS STUDY SO YOU HAVE MORE OPTIONS MY BOY.
---
Yea it‚Äôs very satisfying though when you get they 4K or revenge on the toxic player. I play both sides so I am respectful to survivors unless the are toxic obviously. Both can be very frustrating but I tend to get more mad as killer and end up having to turn the game off. (I never DC, finish the match and then rage quit lol)
---
on consoles the game is almost dead
---
thats why
---
Understandable, but there was another incident recently with the exact same concept. It was stolen creditless from one of my friends and posted as their own, so I just wanted to check and make sure
---
for some odd reason, sometimes the map is normal (still dark, but normal to the point where I can see survivors clearly) and the next match I had, it looked crazy dark. Idk if it‚Äôs a glitch or if I‚Äôm just tripping
---
Won't happen the devs have even said a couple times a while back that they think the grind is what keeps players playing more and more. They want players to keep playing so they can potentially buy more dlc and cosmetics. In a way it works because I play usually a good amount of time because I really want BBQ on my damn Freddy.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much how every Spirit plays
---
I thought my green keys were draining too fast last night when I had the +15 second add-on attached to them.
---
Everything is way too dark now... they seem to have messed something up with the lighting in the most recent update.
---
Basically ignore everything in this comment because nothing in it is true
---
Stay the feck away from Trapper and Doctor.
---
I actually got a surprising amount of non Onis last night.
---
Matchmaking could be so much quicker
---
seem like you are a lost cause reading that. play killer get to red ranks and experience for yourself.
---
Its terrible... I love it.

It kind of sucks when would killers go for you. Like I get you are the killer, but it‚Äôs 5 gens with Ruin up, no need to sweat

Yes! Did my flashlight challenges yesterday &amp; was getting like 4 blinds out of two batteries, thought I was going crazy!
---
Legion exists and David has probably 1v1'd people worse than them, even with an unarmed disadvantage. Honestly they should just replace No Mither with a "punch sticc killers in the sternum" perk.

I‚Äôll never understand people who still DC against legion. I mean hit power is literally to just hit you. Come on guys

I think it's kind of cute. Like he's looking for friends.

You are so right i am also used to hear the crow and scream from the bathroom whils i pop my parents thinks i am crazy, now they hear badass biker they must be thinking i have issues

[Trapper when he has catched the saboteur be like](https://coub.com/view/ekprb)
---
With a little bit of HOTS Butcher to boot. I mean c'mon, you run around the map picking up blood off takedowns to power up and eventually one shot squishies. Doesn't get any more direct than that.
---
Window and pallet hits were always like that, even before dedicated servers. It hasn't noticeably changed.
---
Tomorrow is when it starts happening on PC and Switch
---
I think it's nice to have the opening cinematic be the one for the most recent chapter. I actually hope they do this for all chapter releases in the future.
---
I know all of this and still feels like shit. Lol. Again, this is all less of an issue if we're talking solely getting around the map or using the charge attack on a cornered survivor but that won't be the case most of the time.
---
I seen gameplay on him on PC and it's way smoother and people land the charged hits way more easily. It's so damn clunky on console and once you get bloodlust and try to use the charge, even for the shortest time possible.
---
I go up against mostly red ranks so these guys are making the most of every damn loopable structure and the Oni is just too clunky for me to put up with. 
---
I even played Nurse and while that is hard, it doesn't feel that bad. Just have to be more prediction based than PC players.
---
Trust me, I'm not trying to avoid playing the killer I *just* paid for, but there's something off about him right now.
---
The new map needs to be in a binary system.
---
wraith
---
I think... the Oni might be a bad killer lol. I have tried playing him and maybe its just me but he is just as loopable as any other M1 killer and his ability tends to make me get looped more rather than help against it
---
Wouldn't be surprised if it was a glitch. This is BHVR after all.
---
Well that was quick. I didn‚Äôt think I had such an impact on people..
---
Adam gets tunneled early to deny deliverance imo
---
DC penalties are coming to PC and Switch. Whenever Xbox and PS4 get dedicated servers it'll happen there too.
---
You want to talk about betrayal? A killer and survivor and teamed up to find me just so that the killer can get his last stack and then the killer let that survivor go. I made these douchebags waste literally twenty minutes looking for me so jokes on them they actually lost bp for all the time they could of spent in another match.
---
Didn't BHVR hand out a bunch of free skins last update?This might be one of them
---
did they? i wasn‚Äôt even aware of that
---
Great. Now, how do I communicate this in solo queue?
---
Creating killers that can path find around the map by themselves is a little above what Behavior has ready for DbD. There are so many variables to the game that they would be very easy to trick.
---
as I have explained numerous times, those stats are total junk. and not a single person who touts them have even tried to refute my argument at all
---
Heard he's really hard to control on console and has some frame drops
---
He is waiting for a normal face more tbh
---
I didn't even know it was changed until I loaded it up again to make sure. I was like NO I WANT THE ORIGINAL ONE. I hope they change it. Because what makes The Oni so special from all the other DLC's that came out that puts him in the opening scene yaknow? Idk. Some may be like "who cares" well i do haha i love this game.
---
Just gotta flex on me, no one told you to and you weren't paid yet you did it anyway.

Take the upvote.

I didn't get to play in a week and wanted to get back in tonight, so much for that.

All exclusive cosmetics excluding some dev items and 4 specific event items &gt;!Jokes on me for not owning the game during that event, right?!&lt; have been given to all players this update.
---
Oh yeah, its going to be so fun holding M1 for 150 seconds.
---
&gt;  But yet Freddy is still not a good Killer at a high level which is kind of my point here
---
if you think this then you are not acting from a reasonable position 
---
anyway, you walked back pretty much everything here, so eh. Guess we're done. Thanks
---
Thanking BHVR for fixing a bug while exploiting another one. Pretty on-brand for the standard Ghostface main NGL. ü§£
---
yeah i saw it coming lol, good try tho it would have worked if i did
---
I made a meme for that aswell
---
Ye i think it was the legacy skins or something like that.Idk i dont have interests in skins so i usually pay it no mind
---
Yes something is wrong i buy selfcare but i don't unlock the perk. I still don't understand because i was trying to buy again when i was able, self care but i can't. Its weird
---
I usually do it before I pick up the body so I'm ready to go if I see someone close trying to sneak up to unhook or something.

Numbers don‚Äôt lie. Read the stats. I have numberS to back my claims, you do not.

All but one killer has over a 50% kill rate across all levels of gameplay. Meaning survivors across all ranks have LESS than 50% chance of survival. 4man SWF has a 48% survival rate, meaning it actually makes the game more FAIR for survivors. 
---
Maybe people complain that killers are OP because they are actually OP. LOL. 
---
Try backing your claims up with facts and data from now on.
---
Can't, I use MYC
---
whoah that‚Äôs sweet- but also really sucks for those people who bought this mask for 50$
---
How is denying points for others a win for yourself ? ü§î
---
No esp since the game would be even more broken than it is now
---
Wasn't it originally given away for free?
---
Their fault gor doing business with scalpers I guess.
---
thank you :D but i'm legit upset to leave Feng Min, been maining her since i got the game(during Pig chapter), actually sad that Yui sounds better than her and is more interesting for RP reasons.
---
It looks great, both the costume and picture
---
They're shitting the bed big time. It is always like this after big updates. ALWAYS. There are always major bugs (along with a ton of minor bugs) that show up. I'm more surprised at the tolerance of this community. I don't know how some of you guys do it. You keep trucking even when the game is a bug filled mess. You keep supporting it by buying DLCs, cosmetics, the battle pass. 
---
Yet this game still has a plethora of problems after all the income that this team has received. Enough to hire more competent staff. In any other game, this would be enough to fix most of the issues. Enough to provide more QoLs to make the game a better experience. I respect that tolerance, that patience that some of you guys have. But at what point do you say no more? From what I'm seeing we're getting to that point where the majority of people are losing their patience with BHVR.
---
This basement bug is disastrous. Game-breaking. It comes at a time where there's a challenge in the rift involving the basement. Then you're also going to have killers exploiting it, just like what survivors did earlier in the year with 'Wake Up".
---
Then we combine this with the issues that DBD has had for a while now like matchmaking and poor optimization (ESPECIALLY on CONSOLES, u/In_Dux pretty much hit the nail on the head with the current state of consoles) and it gets borderline ridiculous.
---
People should stop making excuses for them. The state of the game is getting inexcusable and on my part, there's little room for tolerance at this point.
---
You ready have it. Its free for everyone
---
This is so wholesome.
---
*Fixed an issue where legion was added to the game. Because Fuck You, that‚Äôs why.*
---
numbers don't lie but they need to be properly interpreted and controlled. these objectively are not and were not
---
it isnt
---
I camp basement and a teammate unhooks the survivor before they hit struggle/die on hook to at least give them a chance of getting away/ds/unbreakable.
---
The unhooked guy goes down, the unhooker gets exposed and morid. fin
---
My daughter and niece play DBD in our house all the time. They take turns using a Styrofoam machete for the killer, while the other one is a survivor. They even have a terror radius. lmao
---
My niece is definitely a Dwight who hides in the lockers (or my broom closet....)
---
Crazy idea but, have you actually tried to Snap Out Of It and then just mend normally ü§î
---
Yea I love him so far and his hits do feel clunky, my biggest issue so far would have to be the actual hit animation for a charged kanabo, the triple hit just looks stupid.  
---
   
---
Also getting stunned while charging a kanabo swing breaks your perspective, with your kanabo always being held up and even your sword in default state is broken and stuck to the top of the screen until you hit someone with a basic no charge kanabo hit.
---
I dont think it's that big an issue. Seeing as 90% of people are playing him
---
I CAN'T HEAR THEIR RESPONSE. DON'T THEY KNOW IT'S RAGE WEDNESDAY?
---
WHAT
---
Could u explain why? I think I mentioned the solution for that
---
"omg youre not allowed to make fun of her for any reason"
---
Your lumped in with about  20% of the killer base
---
wasn't this posted earlier? am i getting deja vu? whoa...
---
a lot of time you do not have time to snap out of it before the mend runs out. not to mention doctor can use addons to make snap out of it take even longer
---
Forreal, I can't do shit as Oni because I'm trash, he is definitely not a mindless killer
---
I swear some people play spirit just to use her power to get back to the hook fast. They don't use it in chase, no use out of it besides going back to the hook.
---
YEAH, FUCK LEGION PLAYERS, AM I RIGHT? THERE‚ÄôS NO WAY ANYONE IS GONNA COMPLAIN. THERE‚ÄôS NO WAY THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT ANY DIFFERENTLY. WHY ACTUALLY PUT IN EFFORT WHEN WE COULD JUST FUCK SOMEONE OVER. MEANWHILE, SPIRIT STILL HAS NO INDICATOR FOR HER SHIFT, BECAUSE THAT‚ÄôS BALANCED AND FAIR FOR EVERYONE.
---
good to see some people having a brain - u/HardPillz seems to like deepthroat everything the devs say and take it as  commandments
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e63096/nemesis_on_doc_is_pretty_fire_tho/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You can always get him for his perks which are just Meh, except for Nemesis.
---
But honestly, I hate playing them and you can check my recent history on why he feels like shit on console. Lol.
---
Nurse is hard to master due to having to predict more with her and framerate not making blinking feel that good. But her movement and blinks are consistent. 
---
At high rank anyway, Oni at base is still an M1 killer and his power supposedly makes up for it. On console, not my experience and using gets me looped forever.
---
Now, can you play him? Sure, people play all types of games with bongo's and Wii steering wheels. Lol.
---
Will you enjoy your time with him? Highly doubt it.
---
You still got 35 days to do it, You had 70 when the Archive released. So depending on how many hourse you clock in and how many Lvl. 1, 2, 3 and 4 quests you complete it should be possible.
---
I had a Ghostface give me hatch yesterday because "you look like Drew Barrymore from Scream 1". I was using blonde Feng Min with the Xmas sweater and plaid skirt.
---
Bhvr, please add "face kick" to deny a unhook
---
Probably not without playing a LOT.  I play probably 4 hours a night and am still only on page 5/9.
---
How about we actually fix the damn game
---
Trapdoor used to be in the survivor‚Äôs favor, and specifically got an entirely new mechanic added to make these stalemates feel less bad, instaheals were nerfed very hard. Gens used to be even faster and also give a 1% bonus for every good skill check. Games can absolutely go fast and it probably needs to be looked at but it‚Äôs a very dangerous thing to just ‚Äúok hit the nerf button‚Äù at several times. Same goes for nerfing survivors because occasionally killers can get games against a very coordinated team that wants to win. Most very bad loops have been looked at with the exception of a few, and balanced landing got nerfed in the meantime to severely limit fall loops. It‚Äôs also not like a map rework can happen with the click of a button. The only thing that is arguably objectively too strong that doesn‚Äôt have 60 variables that beg the question of should they touch it are keys. Keys are also on a similar power level to a mori- so do you really think it‚Äôd go well if they just trashed keys randomly in a patch. So most of these already have been looked at, are an active project, or are very sensitive areas of the game. They are doing their best at making the game feel better from all angles they possibly can. If you can‚Äôt see that I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
---
i'm half way through the rift and i don't know if i'll have enough time.
---
David was just trying to either complete a tome or get wglf stacks
---
how the hell is 3 unhooks easier than 3 basic attacks? lmao, maybe if ur playing like a vulture to get every save. but then again, you‚Äôre doing that anyway with protection hits rn. too many things have to go right for that to be ‚Äúeasier‚Äù consistently
---
You can always level the free track and buy the premium one if you decide youve made it far enough to want the rewards
---
they didn't confirm this in the way xbox did, they just confirmed some kind of compatibility
---
No way, unless you play this game like it‚Äôs your job and complete every mission there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll finish in time
---
When this happens depending who I see, either the unhooked gets a slug and I run off after someone else.  Or the farmer gets chased. Douvle hook due to this is unfun
---
Nah, it's pretty absurd. DBD would have to be your go-to game to get all the battlepass rewards. I wouldn't bother buying the pass. I play quite a bit but I still don't think it's worth the pass.
---
The good news is, the rift chapters that give you blood points and lore are open as long as chapter IV isn't over. We're midway through chapter 3. You can totally 100% all the chapters in time - it may take a little dedication but it won't consume you like the pass would. Besides, the lore is the best part.
---
It‚Äôs when you pick up a survivor and hook them it‚Äôs a small bug that i noticed also if you pick another survivor up or hit them it will end I‚Äôm sure.
---
If it makes you feel better, whenever I play Pig and use Make Your Choice, I never find the rescuer.
---
Of course I‚Äôm also pretty new to the game to maybe ^I‚Äôm ^^just ^^^a ^^^^potato
---
I'VE BEEN PLAYING CONSOLE DEMOGORGON ACTER I TOOK A BREAK FROM THE GAME AND I WAS HAVING FUN UNTIL I GOT A TEABAGGING CLAUDETTE SWF GROUP. I AM NOW REMINDED WHY I QUIT.
---
Boy you have no idea.
---
No u
---
It is very stupid, I think everybody really enjoyed that bug. It was nice to know whether you had a good team or not.
---
I got you homie. I‚Äôm just a big kid when it comes to the Alien universe and have recently fallen in love with DBD. It‚Äôs now my fav multiplayer game so I‚Äôm dying for the two things I love to combine lol. Are you familiar with the universe? How would you feel about an Ash or David android killer??
---
Make him dash, doge his dash, waste time while other people do generators.
---
I think it is intentional just motivation that you can make it to higher ranks i guess.
---
\*sarcasm\*
---
That happens to me all the time
---
Next time something like this happens, start recording. Send the clip of them working together to BHVR and they'll catch a ban.
---
Ok, so I wasn't going crazy with thinking being pallet stunned was disorienting as hell!
---
And I'm glad you love him. I love him as a concept and I always have his perks. I know some people will just power through the issues but I honestly believe he's not on a good spot on console.
---
The best way to explain it is like having aim assist off on one gun in a shooter on console when the other guns have it. Can people still use it? Sure. But I would still want that weapon to be fixed.
---
I'm not sure. I would definitely prefer the Xenomorph though
---
Yeah that happens a lot, it's showing you're ranking up
---
Ok cool I guess. Maybe I try to aim for rank 8 who know.
---
It ain't called wrath for nothin
---
He has good pressure with his dash, but I would just say play a little more stealthy. I havent had too many issues in the 1v1 chase against him since he is mainly a basic killer, with his power I try to use windows as much as possible instead of finding a pallet. But as far as healing, I dont think he has any special reason you cant or shouldnt heal against him. Maybe they to run inner strength to heal quickly and also while hidden
---
agreed. you gotta dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge
---
As a Jake Main this is disturbing to watch.
---
I mean I don‚Äôt like getting farmed off a hook so my teammate has fun so......
---
So you have absolutely zero ways to back up your claims and resorted to an ad hominem fallacy. It only makes you look even more wrong, bud. 
---
You like to ignore facts simply because you don‚Äôt want them to be true. It‚Äôs called cognitive dissonance. 
---
But please by all means boycott the game, I‚Äôll be very happy to know you‚Äôre not in it :)
---
But I didn't rank up in this match I got 1 pip but I needed 2
---
Because you are denying points the farmer would get for the safe unhook.
---
In the basement shadow realm like 5465338 others on the sub.
---
BHVR gifted all players they once limited event gear for all killers and survivors.
---
Yes we are. The models were leaked not too long ago. Any month now
---
Avoid touching blood orbs if you‚Äôre not injured too because he has an add on that shows your location for 3/5 seconds (not sure which) if you touch them.
---
you keep insisting that someone is trying to utilize personal anecdotes. who? who are you arguing against here? i have made no such claim. you are desperately flinging about this strawman to avoid addressing the severe dysfunction of the stats
---
&gt; Why are you so sure these factors are significant enough that the stats cannot be relied on?
---
frankly, you are the one making a claim based on the stats. I am stating that the stats are no good to make any claim, so the onus is on you to defend the viability of the stats. you have not in any way defended the stats themselves. i would like you to do that. if you cannot, and you once again fall back on the same strawmen, then we're done here
---
&gt; What‚Äôs your better alternative?
---
it is impossible to utilize stats to say anything meaningful about the game. there is no alternative. i just hate that people are throwing around junk data as if it's meaningful
---
Your terror music is ass
---
Same &lt;3
---
To all thx. I didn't realize it was free. But thanks for the help
---
Yes I know, it means you're on your way. It's a good thing I promise
---
NO.
---
Speaking of aim assist, can we please fix it on console? You can literally cancel the killer's lunge by running at them and doubling back ahead of them.  
---
Also Destiny has the Aim Assist system you mentioned, with some weapons like a sniper named Beloved having crazy high aim assist while another sniper, the Revoker has near to no aim assist.
---
Yeah - that's the same reasoning i follow
---
Oh ok thanks for clarification
---
Tbf the more comments I read, stating facts I didn't know, the more pissed I get. I think we all know this is unacceptable. But it seems that BHVR is more to blame then I, and also others, thought. I'm curious how they are gonna react to this and how the community will react to that. If after 2 weeks they fix the basement bug, without anything to make up for it, or without any apolagies, I will be furious.
---
&gt;how the hell is 3 unhooks easier than 3 basic attacks?
---
They tested 3 stacks obtainable through safe unhooks **in addition to protection hits**.
---
Here is what people were doing:
---
* You didn't even wait for the killer to leave the hook, you tried to unhook right in his face and he would hit you right in front of the hooked guy. This gave you your first stack.
---
* While he was on attack cooldown, you would unhook your teammate, he would hit you again and this would give you the second stack while leaving you downed to be hooked afterwards.
---
As soon as the safe hook rescue event went through, your MoM would be active so the next time you were unhooked, you would have MoM for the rest of the match since having your aura revealed only triggered after you burned the Endurance and healed completely without being downed.
---
"You stalking me? Are you stalking ME?!? Well I don't see anyone else here...who the fuck do you think YOU'RE stalking? HUH?!?"
---
It should be in Bills clothing inventory. It was a free gift like all other old Event gear that was gifted to all players.
---
  God tier reply
---
I dont have any, but alr
---
Yea I get that, it‚Äôs just funny to watch
---
Got a messaged saying "Not sure what happened, post was deleted"
---
good to see you objectively looking at the subject but i think we can agree to disagree here. purple instaheal is still the same basically and i dont see infinites and god loops really being adressed (just the one farm map which can have it or not. Also saying god loops are fine just because there is a perk you can counter it with is kind of stupid in my opinion. Perks should be a "nice to have" kind of thing and not like mandatory to catch survivors at all or have a chance of the gens not being done in 2 minutes. This is no argument in my opinion. I see perks as a - you are stronger in this department kind of thing - so you dont loose as much time on specific actions.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6207a/this_game_is_so_horribly_broken_right_now/
---
I have an easier time with legion than I do the Oni at this point.
---
Lmao what? Dude you wrote this whole paragraph of blatant projection and managed to get his whole idea  wholly wrong.  
---
Oni while a cool and interesting killer Is poorly designed because his power heavily, heavily encourages Tunneling because of how his power works, leaving little room for different strategies that don‚Äôt work against you. 
---
Tunneling is boring in the same way facecamping is, I don‚Äôt like to tunnel unless there are extraneous circumstances but Oni is forced to do so to be effective. I doubt you would make this dogshit paragraph if facecamping became a preferable strategy for a killer
---
Idk but I'd love to drop out of this living hell called red rank, let me chill with the green and purple rank survivors and killers
---
Thank you for your surface
---
I'm not really into the whole "Oni" thing, but I can say his map is insane for "The Ghost Face"! It has so many hiding spots to stake out survivors it's insanity.
---
Also, can you link me to your friends idea? I would love to read the comments and add some thoughts.
---
He's not as good as on pc, but he's still pretty fun.
---
Already posted
---
**Pretty Good Job So Far:**
---
You have full confidence in your team, and will always stand behind them. If 3 generators have been completed without anyone being hooked, the hatch will spawn and you will be able to open it for your team.
---
*"I actually don't have anything to do with the balance."*
---
I'm alright with Jason being added but Chucky just doesn't fit with the game
---
Really? I also have an Xbox one X and I didn't notice any frame issues.
---
do you want me to make a sheet exactly the same to the ones from the devs so you have evidence? I give you hundreds of red rank games as killer and survivor as evidence and i tell you the game is unbalanced. Try getting to red ranks in order to experience for yourself
---
The modela were shown by BHVR not leaked
---
That is actually a genius idea, kinda like Friday the thirteenth how you need gas for the car. Other objectives would be a wonderful idea.
---
ya just buy half the tiers pog ..
---
It depends on the killer you‚Äôre playing
---
Never heard of it being done but you could send a ticket to support and find out.
---
He's really hard to control in general, not just on console
---
Have you tried morse?
---
Omg yes! I'd love to see Meg and Legion's pictures for my flair.
---
To bad not many killer do that! Especially now with the tome challenge both side play in a very selfish way!
---
THEY QUEUED SOLO. I MESSAGED THEM AFTER GAME AND ASKED. TOLD THEN THEY DID WELL AND ENCOURAGED THEM TO KEEP PLAYING BUT STILL I CANT IMAGINE GETTING TUNNELED AND DESTROYED THAT HARD AS A NEW PLAYER WAS A FUN EXPERIENCE.
---
Controls aren't that bad, but they may take a few games to get the hang of. I've only had frame drops when collecting blood orbs, which isn't that big of a deal since you can't attack when doing that anyway.
---
This is a strange opinion for me to see. I will agree that Oni is not a conventional slasher movie type comparable to many of the other killers, and while Onis are certainly part of horror culture, he does more so seems like he could be a boss in a game such as Sekiro. ...But as opposed to many of the other killers, I actually find Oni to be pretty scary. None of the killers are truly unsettling, let alone after facing them over and over again, but Oni is truly menacing. He's an ogre, and his brute force and the sheer ridiculousness of Blood Fury strike a sense of terror that while gameplay-based, as opposed to the Nurse or something actually correlates with his overall design. When he screams, stomps a survivor to death in the distance and then comes charging and you know there's not a whole lot you can do to prevent getting stomped yourself, that is actually pretty tense. A good Billy was already menacing, and Oni is that but amplified.
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
First time "EXPOSED" popped up I thought the killer could wallhack me.  
---
Naturally, I sprint-bursted right into the Myers.
---
Oof scary lol! I will probably try. Thank you!
---
Nope, accidentally bought Oni w cells instead of shards, I‚Äôd like a refund too &gt;.&lt;
---
Dang I was hoping to get them back as I have other things I‚Äôm interested in buying and I don‚Äôt use the character like I thought I would. Oh well
---
They could innovate ways, trust me. Chucky could drag people instead of carrying them on his shoulder. As far as getting them on the hooks...well that‚Äôs where there innovation comes through.
---
Is it because you bought laurie and DS is on the shrine?
---
I mean if it's a design of the system that's fine. I know R6 has none and I enjoy that game. I feel Oni is an oversight.
---
And yeah, lunging against survivors that knows everything about the game is basically a guaranteed miss. 
---
For the uninitiated, this goes beyond the standard "Auto aim made me hit the wall" mess. Survirors can practically ensure a lunge whiffs if given enough space. Like, without fail if they're good enough and the connection is stable.
---
Rare issue because very few know how to abuse it but still.
---
The farmer doesnt get rewarded, while allowing a smarter survivor to profit
---
The quality actually makes it look more authentic.
---
For end of match it rounds all players up  to next rank if they have a lot of pips. So you can get a clearer idea of their skill level. It might also round down but I‚Äôm not sure. Like if someone is almost red ranks and only a couple of pips away they are much better than the bottom of purple ranks
---
https://twitter.com/NoContextBoomer/status/1201975897261248516?s=09
---
Yeah having played with the changes it hardly seems "worse". It's different, yes, but it functions the same way. Plus, you at least have the slimmest of chances of actually getting a down from it now if survivors fuck around and try to hide in a locker or something.
---
Either way though Deep Wounds isn't supposed to get you downs, it's just supposed to delay survivors. It's like an extremely watered down RBT, except you can apply it quickly to multiple survivors and you never run out of traps.
---
ruin‚Äôs always really good and reliable
---
No I actually bought Nancy and I just don‚Äôt want to use her and really regret the purchase. It was kind of impulsive and I‚Äôm ashamed to admit, I only really got her because I like the show
---
Up the brightness for the love of god up the brightness.
---
People also sleep on Hag.  I rarely see Hag at red ranks (I am rank 1 survivor) but when I do, man they can absolutely wreck.  I also play solo queue almost exclusively, so that may skew my experience, but damn some Hag players are straight up gods.
---
cuz ur a clown
---
It happens randomly I noticed on MacMillan Estate maps it doesn't happen as much but if you use it on farm maps or any maps with tons of foliage it tanks the fps randomly. I don't know if it's a case by case basis or something.
---
My friend went apeshit when i told him bill had a cosmetic
---
sorry to be annoying but do u have a link?
---
Might replace for pgtw and take sloppy as last perk.
---
Oh Lord I remember watching PewDiePie and Markiplier playing that game years ago.
---
Walked straight into the Entity‚Äôs trap
---
There is a new bug where kicking gens can get you trapped inside the gen.
---
Ghost face probably has a little compartment where he can store his camera. You‚Äôd need a really big fucking pocket to store a bear trap
---
Wait you can break hooks?üòìsorry Ninfa new to the game highest lvl survivor is only 25
---
Thank God for that lolol
---
I don't think that 4 no mither is something to worry about
---
Would be funny if after that, Claudette and Rin became friends and bullied David in trials :P
---
I mean, BHVR knows it's audience. Same reason why Akali has more cosmetics than Malphite.
---
Is it good at red-purple ranks tho?
---
Getting stunned by a DS at the wrong time can effectively lose you the match. Entirely situational? You‚Äôre unhookable for 60 seconds when you get saved. So unless you don‚Äôt get hooked ever, it‚Äôs good every game
---
I don't know how to react when someone who escapes through the hatch says that.
---
I mean, yes, it was easy to wipe you all out, but at least have some respect for your team members.
---
I‚Äôm a force-a nature!
---
And they release a perk that works with wiggling and wiggling only works 50% of the time.
---
You have no evidence to back your claims. Anything you yourself provide is skewed because YOU are only one example. If you‚Äôre just bad at playing killer, you would think the game is against you. 
---
Unless you can collect data from games in the same manner as BHVR can, any evidence you provide would be inaccurate, and based on your tone, beyond the normal realms of ‚Äòbiased‚Äô. 
---
You made this post claiming insta heals are a problem when they‚Äôre not event a thing anymore. You‚Äôre not up to date on the game as-is, so I have many doubts to can portray any amount of data accurately.
---
Absolutely crazy to hear they're already planning on taking 2 weeks to fix the bugs. Other dev teams look into bugs like this ASAP. Even if it takes 2 weeks, that shouldn't be the deadline they put out there.
---
And I think I'm going to pay R6 and Death Stranding over this game for a bit. I was planning on taking a large break when TLOU2 dropped in February but that got pushed back.
---
But once Cyberpunk and TLOU2 comes, I'm not sure I'll touch this game for awhile without certain fixes.
---
I have literally never witnessed poor performance with this level of consistency before.
---
That‚Äôs the ugliest Bentley I‚Äôve ever seen

60 seconds of strategic balanced invincibility

This is a fantastic meme. It's extremely unique and pulls from a rare source. The execution is simple and brilliant. 11/10 meme.
---
Yes, all auric cell purchases should be refundable, but they can‚Äôt refund skins bought with event currency and probably not with shards either.
---
I know the first two tho because I‚Äôve sent a ticket before.
---
poor david.
---
definitely, honestly if you don‚Äôt have ruin at those ranks you‚Äôll almost always lose. high rank survivors know how to do gens and you‚Äôll find yourself only getting one or two hooks before all the gens are done if you don‚Äôt have it
---
Can I ask what character?
---
What? Isn't everything useless besides when it's useful...
---
And it's still really good, it allows Survivors to have 60 seconds of invulnerability every time someone is unhooked since you don't know who is bringing it. It's just even better during the EGC since it's just about a free escape.
---
True but it‚Äôs just a Mori man. Makes zero sense not to incorporate a trap in Trapper‚Äôs.
---
Hmmm, alright. So what would be the spirit build for you?
---
"HEY! You're finally awake."

Yup. Damn this patch is a mess
---
[https://imgur.com/EtolAlg](https://imgur.com/EtolAlg)

Isnt it fun if the game literally wont let you play it.
---
people who comment here to complain instead of enjoying the meme. k boomer you are vicitim im so sad for you.
---
It's probably blood orbs tbh.
---
Oh ok! So if I want the refund for the character I just send in a ticket?
---
Thank you &lt;3 I had two killers purposely drag me to the basement and there was no way for me to get out. &gt;: One that last one, I thought I had died because it felt like the Entity was taking me up, then I hit space and for some magical reason my DS actually worked. Still died in the basement again, though. Barely even got 5K BP.
---
You tell me.. I'm trying to get Meg Iron Will so I can save up for Yui once I buy her but instead the bloodweb now gives me the worst perks possible
---
I played for four hours yesterday including basement hooks and never had an issue. What console is this on that everyone is getting so mad about it
---
Ah, will good luck in the support ticket. If it doesn't get refunded her perks are actually pretty good and I hope fixated will let you walk faster while injured eventually. I also like the show and I bought all of the chapter in cells, when I probably should've just got the dlc, worked out in the end. I just use nancy and Steve sometimes I don't really worry about maining them, just got yui and a cosmetic too so my characters are definitely split.
---
Turn back brother, red ranks are a lawless land of perpetual sweat and anger
---
Nancy, she was an impulse buy and I don‚Äôt use her, the cells could be used for stuff I actually want and not a character I solely bought because I like the show
---
As long as BHVR has there white knights on Reddit/Twitter, and we keep blowing our money on their skins, (Yes I know it‚Äôs an entirely different department than the programmers, and the art team is incredible bar some cosmetics having weird clips) it‚Äôll never get much better.

What's wrong with his current state?

Nope, I just got hit out of nowhere.
---
done  :)
---
Okay what he said was pretty douchey but seriously? ‚ÄúYikes, you have less fake internet points than me‚Äù is pretty damn cringey
---
The new map is the GOAT for Trappers, not even going to lie. You can 5D chess that place like no one's business with all the foliage and blind loop corners on too of the really dark gamma.
---
Maybe they could add a pouch on his hip to store traps. Kinda like the trapper bag add on but make it seeable on all cosmetics.
---
Had to have my bro beat that ice crystal bitch in the original Dark Souls :( this is too relatable.
---
Not even Nurse is all that bad on console. Frustrating sometimes as your blinks don't always take you where you want them to, but I don't think that is a console problem.
---
I was wanting Yui and a cosmetic for her but I‚Äôm also waiting because I‚Äôm pretty close to being able to get Yui with shards. I want the cells for the suzie Christmas sweater and a cosmetic for Yui hopefully
---
Along with thousands of other people. What‚Äôs your point?
---
They don't need "stale old arguments" when they just introduced a new bug that basically moves survivor viewpoints out of the map if they ever get hooked in the basement.
---
I hate it unless I'm playing hag.
---
Should be, just say you‚Äôd like a refund for which character and then to find your account they need something called a cloud IP (I think, it‚Äôs been over a year) and that should be found at the bottom of the options menu, it‚Äôs a long ass code with numbers and letters I think, so tell them that as well
---
This is why I think the ranking system should be improved, it seems too easy to pip, but I'm against people throwing games, since they're trying to be matched against killers of lower skill level on purpose.
---
Explain yourself
---
But his power isn't instant, and you can't use it *every time* you're at a pallet. He's an M1 99% of the time, and Brutal is faster than his power at breaking thing. Only Bubba, Billy, and Demogorgon can use their power at the pallet and not loose any ground in a chase.
---
I've warned people for over 2 years that bhvr doesnt know what they're and they continue to prove me right every single patch. Something breaks (sound guaranteed) every patch then it takes them another 2 weeks to push out fixes which breaks even more shit.
---
AT LEAST IF SHE WAS SWF SHE COULD GET TUNNELLED WHILE HANGING WITH HER BUDS LIKE ME
---
It's good ONCE a game, if getting stunned for 5 seconds is enough to prevent you from getting a 2k, you're not a good killer.  Don't forget 2k is a win for the killer according to the developer.
---
"Unhookable" ok, so slug them.
---
It's not 60 seconds invulnerability time, you're only safe for the 5 second the killer is stunned.  You can still be slugged, and it's not every time someone is unhooked, only you.  It's not a free escape, you have to earn it through a skill check and you have to actually get away from the killer and you only get it if you were unhooked in the last minute.
---
Literally none of your points are correct.
---
Literally leveled Laurie to level 40 for DS two days ago....
---
Thank you so much! I‚Äôll try that tonight. I‚Äôll honestly have to look up a tutorial because I‚Äôm very easily confused but you were still very helpful
---
If you're gonna get oni eventually getting the dlc saves you $2-3 and you get a gold varient with a more white than pink shirt for yui
---
Just do a 5v5 with one killer on each team and whoever finishes the most gens or who kills all the survivors first wins.
---
He was shown during a stream by the Devs that's not leaking
---
BHVR has worked with the devs on Identity V, which is very similar (though that game doesn't have randomized tiles, so that would make it harder)
---
Plus I heard that Netease does have some stake in BHVR, enough to have someone on the board.
---
If that's true, maybe they'll get some pointers to make bots, even if they're not great. They could just put them in KYF, since they like using the main game as testers :P
---
oof... why is mouse and key becoming a hot topic now? I‚Äôve literally been saying this for years and downvoted to oblivion.
---
It's a strong loop but idk if I'd call it an infinite as an infinite implies there is nothing the killer can do to catch the survivor there.
---
Even the storehouse isn't a true infinite as the killer will eventually catch the survivor.
---
Oh dang I didn‚Äôt know that! The only thing about that is that I don‚Äôt have any money to put into my ps4 at the moment but I‚Äôll wait a bit and make the decision if I can get the refund. Thank you so much!
---
Don‚Äôt care, the models were still released regardless of who it was by
---
This bug is just amazing. I'm almost done with the survivor challenges and this shit comes out meaning either I play the killer challenges with full knowledge that this exists or I avoid those challenges until it's fixed which could take weeks
---
Its bugged to shit. I got 3 iridescent in a match and only had one counted.
---
What do you mean by "gen speed that we have today"? Gen speed used to be much faster. Are you implying that slugging was toxic back when gens only took 70 seconds and couldn't be fully regressed, but now that gens are slower it's not? Honestly slugging has never been toxic on its own, only if you used it to be an asshole and make everyone bleed out just to waste their time.
---
Interesting...
---
Thanks so much really appreciate it!
---
I have dropped over $100 as a casual player, if anything like 400$ so far. And as someone who's supporting these developers, I am beyond disappointed 
---
We have endured countless patches with game breaking bugs and here's just a short list of the bugs from THIS YEAR. GAME BREAKING ONES.
---
- Can't heal from injured state to the dying state
---
- Couldn't escape through the exit gates causing the EGC to kill you 
---
- Rubber basement hook
---
- Infinite legion mending
---
- Wake up bug 
---
Some latency problems that they said should be improved but still haven't since dedicated servers launch
---
- Dead Hard (is literally broken and unusable because of latency)
---
-Huntress hatchets hitting thin air but still registering as a hit 
---
- Worst window vaults with latency
---
- Gen grabs don't even work anymore 
---
- Nurse blinks are inaccurate 
---
- Chainsaws aren't always registering but not because of Sprint burst (yeah i know you remember that and no it's not the same problem. just latency)
---
- Trapper stepping in his own traps after placing them (please fix this wtf)
---
Also:
---
- Halloween patch was delayed because of bugs. Archives broke within the first 30 mins of release of said patch and players are still having problems 
---
- Hotfix for Archives was delayed for the weekend because of "more bug testing" and well, archives are still bugged 
---
- Game got hard-capped to 120fps and their optimization in game is declining each patch
---
Worst part is that's just a small portion of bugs that are introduced each patch. 
---
I don't even know what's going on with BHVR and Dead By Daylight's Developer team, but they're disappointing their most dedicated players without giving a flying shit about us (or so it feels like it)
---
Like, this is beyond unprofessional and we shouldn't really stand for it anymore. But they're also humans, and it's hard to make a perfect bugless game. But it's ridiculous with how much breaks with each patch and the devs don't EVER hold themselves accountable enough. It's always "Oops we're sorry here you go! Btw dlc is now on sale yay!"
---
You're welcome! The dlc is 7.99 I think and cells would be  more
---
Tar Bottle Trapper on Sanctum of Wrath is the most fun you can legally have while still wearing pants.
---
It's been counting mine, but I've been getting 1-2 per game since hitting purple ranks.
---
Besides DbD's tiles system, the very similar game Identity V has bots. And ties to BHVR.
---
Maybe one day they'll have a KYF option at least. Even if they're not great, better than nothing :P
---
Don't apologize. This looks awesome!!!
---
Unnerving presence maybe?
---
Thanks, that makes me feel better :)
---
After experiencing this all the time, I've learned to love it when survivors cry about camping. Their tears are nourishing and delicious.
---
I will admit I just did this to a toxic Yui (I swear they‚Äôre all toxic???) hahaha I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
The Survivors can hear breathing coming from occupied lockers XD
---
Re-read the description.
---
:)
---
I liked haunted grounds,  watching them try to cleanse ruin over and over and over is satisfying.
---

---
Here‚Äôs the link to a video showing them off
---
Since I already have some cells realistically it‚Äôd be the same price for Yui but if I bought the chapter I‚Äôd get her and the Oni so you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve got $2 in my ps4 at the moment so sadly I‚Äôd have to do the $10 and can‚Äôt do that at the moment
---
Nemesis and Decisive Strike change the Obsession.
---
If you still have no idea, i would say go to demogorgon.
---
You can buy oni later with shards.
---
You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
Survivors can't see the blood orbs unless Oni is using an addon that shows them.
---
I played two games and had at least one in the first game and two in the second and none of them counted.
---
* Submissions not directly related to Dead by Daylight.
---
Could be I Kno when there a lot of effects going on at the same time it ruins your fps. An example I can think of is using clown with addons that increase gas radius near a lit trash cans.
---
Update: I just went against a P3 Claudette on this map and it was in fact, trash. I‚Äôm just going to AFK when I get this map as killer or be friendly and mess around.
---
So if you see em, don‚Äôt touch em!
---
WASD moves your character, your mouse angle determines where your character and screen are looking.
---
What if the music changed when you had mix tape(s) equipped?
---
You change the key being pressed accordingly to your camera movement. If you want to run forward while looking behind, you press S.
---
Then how do you check behind your on pc while running?
---
Bug number 571 that came with this update.
---
They are french devs with 8 game designers LMAO.
---
I DONT CARE. FUCK BHVR. TRASH GAME. TRASH GAME. TRASH FUCKING GAME. FUCK. SHIT.
---
Ive played it all on killer, Ive never really run into a team thats been actually hard before besides the dbd team ID and some of its players (PC player), nothing really bothers me because 9/10 of my games are a 4k with addonless wraith so one hard game doesn't do anything but get me hyped for an actual challenge.
---
As to your first points, a person can like what they want and enjoy what they enjoy. If they get frustrated at games easily they shouldn't be forced to play other games just because they're emotional about them DBD could be their all time favorite game, yet they rage at it and d/c. As an empathetic person Id rather someone Dc out of my game and cool off rather than get more and more frustrated with it because they're forcing themselves to stay. 
---
DBD could make a bot that instantly replaces the D/C'ed player. It would be alot of work to program but all it would have to do is Gens and W game while sprinting.. cause it would be better than just being down one whole player
---
I do it so my stream can showcase moris and what a killer looks like standing in front of the hook for 2 minutes. I wouldn't call that being upset, they're just providing me quality content /s
---
Yes. With any tool kit you cab sabotage a hook and it stays unusable by the killer for like a minute? Or Jake has a perk that let's him sabotage hooks without a tool kit. If you're fast sometimes you can break the hooks before a killer hooks your teammate.
---
Yes, but what if the disconnect is accidental? And yes, what if they are stuck, what if something else happens? :/ I am not complaining or looking for excuses, just saying that the game can be unstable from time to time. And you can't blame people for leaving in those cases.
---
I saved up 1mil BP, had challenges ready to turn in, dailies ready to turn in, and shrine perks to redeem for BP.
---
This would be broken AF, but then again it'd be really meta
---
Yep I made a post about this. It‚Äôs the same music you get when carrying a Survivor and lasts all game.
---
Don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre aware already but I actually updated my game today and saw Leatherface as an available killer now so I‚Äôm guessing you can get bbq now too
---
Its so frustrating because this just keeps happening and happening and seems like the devs don't even know what they are doing at this point. Like they release a new chapter and everything goes to shit as it has done in the past and they haven't learned anything from that.
---
It's absolutely one of the best perks, if not the best perk. It's so good that it is one of the only two perks in the game that killers above a certain rank are forced to adapt their playstyle to by default, just for the *possibility* that the survivor might be running it. 
---
Think about that. Some other popular survivor perks are Iron Will, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, and Dead Hard. Of those, only the last one requires you to change how you play to accommodate it when you're killer. The other three? You're still chasing the same way you normally would. If you see the survivor speed up after a balanced trigger, you might break the chase, but you will still chase them until they trigger it. With DS and Dead Hard, you are actively holding back from doing something you'd normally do even if you don't know for sure they have it. Just the threat of DS is enough to get you to slug sometimes. That's power.
---
I mostly play survivor, but when I play killer and I see a survivor do this I 100% tunnel them and let the other kid get away
---
Thanks! We can dream!
---
you back your claims up on things the devs say when everyone knows at this point that the devs have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to balance. And I encourage you to speak to other killer mains and ask for their opinion and see what you will get from them as an answer. 
---
And it seems like you have no idea when it comes to instaheals they are a thing still at least the purple one since it gives you borrowed time which is basically the same and after a while you get fully healed. There is no difference other than if you get hit while the instaheal is active you have to mend for like 10 seconds more than it was before.
---
I play Demo with BBQ and get roughly 30-60k a match. About 20-25 games will have me maxed.
---
Eh, dbd just isn't the type of game where you run around as a tiny doll. Also BHVR has other issues to fix and adding a  new dragging mechanic probably isn't one.
---
All goods and they should direct you in the emails, they‚Äôre very patient and kind peeps over there ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Most are probably going for the challenges and/or don't even know about it.
---
I- *coughs* where should I start..
---
1. I REALIZED THAT TREES THAT BLOCK YOUR WAY IN LOOPS ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO BAMBOO IN THE SPIRIT AND ONI MAPS, FUCK BAMBOO I HATE IT SO MUCH
---
2. FIX THE FUCKING BASEMENT BUG THANK YOU
---
3. STOP RUNNING IN CIRCLES ALL TOGETHER AROUND THE DARN ONI WHILE THE FUCKER HAS HIS RAGE POWER, WHERE'D YOU GATHER THE COURAGE, BALLS AND INTELLIGENCE FOR SUCH PLAN, YALL REALLY THINK YOU CAN DODGE A HUGE ASS MADAFAKA SMASHING THE GROUND WITH HIS BAT AGGRESSIVELY OVER AND OVER??? 
---
4. HITBOXES, HITS THROUGH PALLET DROPS, AND DEDICATED SERVERS IN GENERAL CAN SUCK MY DONG
---
ALRIGHT THAT'S ABOUT IT, HAVE A GOOD DAY!
---
Why don't you like her exactly? She seems ok, perk wise and she's small
---
Just bought Laurie rip
---
They released cosmetics that were previously exclusive to code giveaways.
---
I'm in red ranks so I don't know if that has something to do with it.
---
I'm not about breeding toxicity with more toxicity. I get frustrated and I may bring a mori to use on a dead hook survivor, but that's the limit
---
Play Adam, run a looping build, get tunneled while you hopefully run the killer around for a few gens. ez gaem
---
it looks good, ill ads some oneshot perk, make your choice maybe?
---
Exactly, for some reason people rate these powers on their ability to down or kill survivors, like folks who suggest Pig is bad because her traps hardly ever kill. It's so far from the point that I just can't take those comments seriously.
---
Teleports are meh, Demogorgon has shown that while they can be good they're definitely nothing game breaking, I think Freddy's is actually the best because you can use it to mind game AND teleport unlike Demo who has to commit.
---
i expect to go in and not be bullied to absolute shit by swf teams when i play someone like trapper doc myers etc. because the game is so onesided.
---
Go right when he dashes.
---
Funny enough, I had the wiggle bug on my way to the basement where I also encountered that wonderful bug. I would have wiggled free too with the time it took away from me. How do these bugs even happen?
---
I get too many good games when I slowly derank and the game shoves me back up to purple. I'll just have to see if today is better.
---
&gt; but I‚Äôm also waiting because I‚Äôm pretty close to being able to get Yui with shards
---
lol i'm gonna get Yui with the cells i earn back from the rift. i have two tiers left i think before i can
---
&gt;&gt; you keep insisting that someone is trying to utilize personal anecdotes. who? who are you arguing against here? i have made no such claim. you are desperately flinging about this strawman to avoid addressing the severe dysfunction of the stats
---
I assumed you had some kind of alternative in mind when you were shooting down the stats. 
---
My mistake, your intention isn‚Äôt to provide some kind of solution, just to point out that the available data is bad.
---
&gt;&gt; frankly, you are the one making a claim based on the stats. I am stating that the stats are no good to make any claim, so the onus is on you to defend the viability of the stats. you have not in any way defended the stats themselves. i would like you to do that.
---
I am questioning the validity of your argument that the stats are no good due to the unaccounted factors.
---
Surely the onus is on you to prove your argument in the first place before I make the defense?
---
Before I can defend something, first I must be convinced there is a problem.
---
You say there are factors that make the data unreliable. I am asking you to prove it.
---
Without proving it I cannot agree with you that there is a problem - in which case what is there for me to defend?
---
That is my line of thinking. Please tell me where you think I went wrong.
---
no emails are collected unless you provide it in the comment box, which isn't obligatory.
---
I‚Äôm a console player so Irdk what is happening with that but I think I heard it was just a quick test they were running
---
Same xD
---
Killers are getting stuck in the animation after kicking gens lol
---
"Keys, hatch, instaheals are clearly not addressed" um what mate?
---
The devs have catered a lot to killers in the last year, they made it so that the killer can close hatch making it so the survivor can't just stall the game until the killer gets tired of playing the hatch standoff. They changed ds so that it doesn't give one player invunerability for most of the match, now it is just an anti-momentum/anti-tunnel which is still good but not good as it was imo. They nerfed instaheals in a way the killer can actually play against them, styptic specially still require the person to heal afterwards. 
---
In regards to keys, they are bs but so are moris, are you asking the devs to address moris as well or do you only care about keys?
---
Your post screams entitled killer main as it is complaining about minor annoying nuances of the game instead of actual problems the game has. The devs have not even made a significant nerf to a killer other than Nurse but even then the Nurse is still the best killer in the game.
---
I'm also on PS4, so this might be a system thing.
---
"Alexa, set a timer for 60 seconds."
---
This is an honest question
---
IDK BUT GIVE LEGION SOME LOVE, IM AFRAID OF WHAT AWAITS MY LEGION MAIN ASS WHEN I REACH HIGH GREEN/PURPLE RANKS
---
The basement bug is random and isn't always guaranteed to happen, but it only happens to survivors.
---
Invite sent, then I‚Äôll gift :) pretty sure that‚Äôs how it works lol
---
What would Hag and Demogorgon give?
---
... hopefully it's on console where there's no chat lol
---
I'm on Xbox too! What about Trapper fucks frames so had?
---
Oni on PC vs Oni on Console is another great caption here.
---
Dont have it yet but sounds decent. Do you think nurces instead of PGTW? Spirit is op against injured survivors sloppy keeps them longer in that state and as i like to change targets this could be very good with swfs. Nurces calling makes it easier to find em.
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; At the bottom of the Cursed Legacy Patch notes, The Devs listed some known issues:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/108852/steam-patch-notes-3-4-0-chapter-14
---
Multiple strings have the incorrect localization in Russian.
---
The wrong text is being displayed for The Doctor and his Add-ons.
---
It is possible for the game audio to become corrupted. If you encounter this issue please provide some information about how and when the issue occurred. 
---
Flickering Wiggle buttons when getting interrupted. 
---
It is possible for a Survivor not to have the Wiggle option when pickled by the Killer if another Survivor comes in range. 
---
It is possible to become stuck on "Loading Player Independent Shop Data" when attempting to get past the IIS. 
---
It is possible for a Survivor to fall out of world (from their perspective) and be unable to attempt to escape when hooked. 
---
It is possible for Survivors to fall through the ground to the floor below when getting dropped. 
---
The Nemesis perk does not trigger on an Obsession switch from Furtive Chase. 
---
The Oni receives Blood Orbs when hitting an injured Survivor with Endurance. 
---
The Oni can rotate faster than intended with the keyboard or joystick during Demon Dash. 
---
It is possible to get desynched between host and client. 
---
The game crashes when pressing Alt + F4 before reaching the IIS.
---
Unlocalized "Chat Offline - Host returned to lobby" in Custom Game chat. 
---
This is funny cause I've been getting nothing but back to back Oni games as survivors, matchmaking is strange.
---
Like the last bug, or the bug before that... "I had no idea....yet agitation and iron grasp are magically on every single build since the bug was found...."
---
Lamest fucking excuse in the book.
---
Couldn't he have closed hatch and went into endgame? or did it not work?
---
Have you read "How to Lie With Statistics"?
---
The lower quality of the photo and the black and white make it look like someone snapped a photo in the 70s or something. It has this eerie vibe to it. I love it.
---
Surprised Spirit is so cute :3
---
Gonna have to take this Chibi to the Dark Souls subreddit then I guess
---
u/garadon
---
Oh most definitely lol, that‚Äôs one main thing I made sure was that no one could talk to her
---
Im not the same guy whos been responding above, but, i main spirit and have gotten rank 1 w her multiple times and my go to is bbq, sloppy, thanataphobia and ruin. I literally only ran this build and only played spirit and got rank 1 a few seasons back. Even w the spirit nerf i honestly think shes still the best killer and the nerf didnt do too much to an experienced spirit player.
---
gg wp
---
Perk idea: Stop stealing art and actually post who its from.
---
Cool repost OP, [the source is my friend Mellow, here's her tumblr :\^)](https://mellowmonsters.tumblr.com/)
---
I'm seriously thinking about quitting myself. I'd have a lot more hours to invest in other games/hobbies if I wasn't grinding the rift every day.
---
This is what i keep talking about Dbd. The game is literally leaning towards killer side and Survivor get shit on with every new update there is. Watch the game die in 2020.
---
DIDNT YOU SAY YOU WANT TO DO THE RIFT, IM CONFUSED NOW
---
You're finally awake.
---
The sentence at the end is a little weird.
---
Demogorgon is objectively one of the worst Killers released in recent times and the stats show it. He has one of the lowest pick rates and lowest kill rates in the game despite being a licensed character. I didn't see anyone playing Demo when they were released and I don't see anyone playing them now: compare that to Oni who I've been seeing non-stop since this chapter's release.
---
Demogorgon is an objectively worse version of Freddy by every definition of the word. A friend of mine made an extensive post about Demo on the official forums and I would link it but I'm on mobile right now.
---
Is changing icons a bannable offense?
---
Jake main sweating intensifies
---
For real tho I see Fengs sabo more than Jakes these days and yet Jakes still get the blame
---
Yeah thats true.  I love how spirit is one of the only killers that can actually do something against swfs
---
Yep this is very accurate. It's unacceptable.
---
Mori is considerably easier and more reliable.
---
The people hate Jes√∫s because he spoke with the truth
---
"You couldnt catch survivors at all" 
---
Lack of skill is not an argument.
---
Deep wound rework:if the survivor fails to mend themselfs in time,they will be healed completely.
---
It's 60 seconds of invulnerability because he can't hook and kill you since you're just going to DS
---
You can be slugged, but it's up to the killer if they're going to waste plenty of time chasing someone who they know they can't hook
---
It is for everyone because this version of DS is the same everyone and it doesn't matter if you're the obsession. Also the killer has no way of knowing if someone brought the perk or not, they just know if there is an obsession. 
---
And if you're saying a skill check is "earning something" then you're being ridiculous. 5 seconds is plenty of time to get away from the killer if the door is open. Also being unhooked within a minute easy when the EGC is only 2 minutes. 
---
Actually play the game so I don't have to explain everything to you.
---
If you are awake when you unhook someone else you can trigger BT.
---
yes its good, if u got a small map and nurses callin they will never have a safe place to heal, but without ruin u may need pgtw for slowing the gens a little bit
---
Try to record what was happening in the game when it started and report it to the official DBD forums. 
---
They mentioned audio corruption in the patch notes; but I'm not sure if that refers to this specifically.
---

---
(See very bottom)
---
it‚Äôs just a joke i picked up while i used to use twitter it doesn‚Äôt really mean anything. i love all my killers equally
---
It only counts base bloodpoints. Extra BP from like offerings and BBQ or WGLF don't count.
---
Doesn‚Äôt count offerings and BBQ
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
the same thing happened to me the game thinks the killer is carrying you.
---
So many Daddies.  ü§§
---
You can‚Äôt fix FPS for console, that‚Äôs on the consoles limitations, not BHVR, what they‚Äôre planning on doing is fine imo
---
That‚Äôs why I got his character just to prestige him and make his ability available for others. I don‚Äôt play him tho because of that tunneling problem
---
\&lt;3 Thank you!!! &gt;w&lt;
---
FUCK THIS I WAS SO READY FOR THE FUCKING HUNTRESS MASK BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOO NVM DJSJSKDKFKDKKEKEKDKKEJAKWKRKEKDKKDKRKR
---
I never face Demogorgons and I've never had one be nice, but man I love those cuties.
---
Sure :D!
---
No, because everybody will be dead.
---
In a recent AMA the devs said she was fanatically devoted to her god, and when the entity came to take her and her followers, It became her god.
---
Thank you! :D
---
Whispers case closed
---
That's basically like Whispers.
---
YUSHHHH OWO
---
thanataphobia mixed w sloppy butcher, they spend too much time healing if you patrol gens theres almost no way they win unless swf communication. its insane i love spirit lol
---
Yea, I‚Äôd listen to this guy, I almost never play spirit. One thing I would maybe switch out for his build would be to replace thanataphobia with discordance though
---
Because I have other things I want and I don‚Äôt really use her, plus sorry for repeating but she‚Äôs an impulse by. I‚Äôm still in the decision phase though so if I turn around and decide not to, the perks are nice to have.
---
Yup. Thanks alot. Got the answer to my dream build ;)
---
It's if the killer leaves before you.
---
Thank you sir
---
Whispers tells you if someone‚Äôs in the area, not if their coming your direction could be helpful when hooking a survivor
---
Haha awesome!!
---
Does she actually play too?
---
You have a very liberal, dev-pandering definition of "game breaking", and while calling an opinion flat out wrong is perhaps a little rich I think the vast majority of people would agree that a bug which makes you unable to see in a game based entirely on vision is pretty gamebreaking.

Mate get out of here with your shit, I win 90% of my Freddy games at rank 1 and I don't even use ruin. Unless you're next argument is that I somehow never face any good survivors in red ranks your argument is invalid.

I feel ya, been getting nothing but GIT GUD messages üòÇ

I found a way to play him with no insta I use the demon power only with the obsession and I use save the Best for last
---
This image emits an unprecedented amount of raw energy.
---
Well there's my problem üòÇ
---
Your wrong but frip frop is my favorite dbd YouTuber I talk in his discord server all the time
---
The cosmetic is owned by a streamer and was given out personally by him with codes so I believe the Devs don‚Äôt have control over it.
---
Not related to auto aim, but you should have used the charged one shot.
---
Might as well guarantee the kill. Would rather play 5 games as opposed to 7 or more.
---
Haha yeah she sure does, I got her the game pass for Xbox &amp; that‚Äôs the first thing she started playing. It was hilarious, I could hear the analog stick being bashed from my room while she was trying to shake lose from a killer so I went in there and helped her on her next match lol
---
Her collision, lack of window vault animation, and the nerf to beads were needed but that is about it.
---
It's Dwight.
---
Ugh I wish I could have those cells. I didn‚Äôt purchase the ‚Äòpremium‚Äô part of the rift and I feel like it‚Äôs not worth it now
---
That‚Äôs doubtful. This sub has a meltdown anytime something is delayed. They said they were going to fix the rift and said it would be delayed from when they planned and all people did was make memes or complain.
---
I got downed almost instantly in all the chases in my first game against the Oni, because I would get stuck in the pallet animation
---
It's just a joke perk really
---
This. I wish I could reject a teammate by kicking them in the face and have my survivor scream ***NOT YET YOU FUCKING CUNT***
---
15 minute match still going on cause this huntress won't rehook me.  I'd DC but that's against the rules.
---
Gotta get those sweet &amp; spicy stacks somehow
---
Yeah, i just didnt cause it took me a sec to relize i didnt hit him
---
Imagine refusing a mode that literally would add so much fucking fun to the game.
---
do people actually get mad about "dweet" LOL
---
this is too cute
---
I like giving it to the last one.
---
That's one of the things we're upset about, they said it could take 'a week or two' to fix (though I lost the source, apologies!). For a bug so severe that's simply too long.
---
I thought the basement bug was bad enough, until I watched a team mate fall through the map on a hill earlier after DS‚Äôing the killer.  She got stuck inside the hill and could t get out.
---
Lol very cool! Wishing her the best of luck in future matches! This game is a lot of fun, and it's way better to have friends/family who enjoy it, too.
---
Right? Survivors need mechanics to ensure their own safety. Like when bhvr added the "press shift to deny heal", now the next step is "press shift to deny unhook"
---
It's only for streamers like twitch shirt.
---
Holy shit same, when I pick up my first survivor the music is on loop for the rest of the game.
---
i feel this in my soul
---
Just the other day, it was me and two teammates left. Jake was on a hook and Michael was chasing me. Bill didn‚Äôt save him. Michael put me on a hook, and I watched as Bill just stood in front of Jake watching him die. He didn‚Äôt take him off the hook until Michael left me and was 2 feet away from Jake. Michael downed Jake then Bill, and we all died.
---
Meanwhile pretty soon we're gonna have Clown running around wearing a pink elephant costume

For real, you try to play just well enough so that you don't ruin anyone else's game but at the same time bad enoughvwhere you don't pip but end up black pipping every time somehow.
---
That'd be a good addition honestly!
---
That‚Äôs a bug, not related to latency as far as I know.
---
When I first started playing, I honestly thought Exposed meant the killer could SEE ME anywhere.. So I stopped doing whatever I was doing and started moving.. "That'll make me harder to catch", I'd think.. course I'd ALWAYS run straight into the killer...
---
Ahh I see
---
I back my claims with data made by the people who ‚Äúmade the game‚Äù. Whereas you back yours with what? Your butthurt experiences? No thanks, I‚Äôll take the word of experienced game developers over some mad gamer who‚Äôs throwing a tantrum on the Internet because things aren‚Äôt going his way (ie: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad so let‚Äôs boycott‚Äù). 
---
And inb4 you make claims about the presence of bugs as justification to call the devs bad, ALL games have bugs, even the top games out right now. 
---
Time matters in this game, and if you think a 10 second heal for an ultra rare is the same thing as an actual insta heal (for a full 2 states, mind), then you‚Äôve already displayed that you cannot be trusted to understand numbers, let alone supply them for evidence.
---
You can tell who has DS because they will make the most idiotic play but forgot that you only took 10 seconds to chase them cause they stayed at an unsafe pallet.

Is that Christian Bale from Equilibrium?

Yikes, what's the basement bug? I haven't been on in a couple days... Should probably change my name from PutMeInBasementDaddy to something else, I doubt that would go well
---
You should take another photo except have Myers stalking from the treeline of a forest.
---
If you're on console just do gens. Lol.
---
I honestly thought it was an oni perk at first since it happened when I got one shot by him.
---
Don't care, free hook, wheee!
---
Yup, had no idea myself until I watched her aura fall through the map during the DS animation.  I thought perhaps it was just a visual bug but then I went back on the hill and could hear her below me.  Ended up dying and spectating and what do you know?  Just chilling in there.
---
**Yes**
---
What legion changes?
---
Nerfing deep wound and removing its synergy with perks like stbfl
---
Happens to me all the time i just quit the game idc *shrug*
---
You gotta be right in front of the hook. It's all about positioning and getting there before the killer.
---
Lol I was waiting for the image to load
---
It annoys me when survivors do the little jumping jacks thing as soon as I hook them like chill.
---
By above a certain rank I'm assuming you mean high ranks (purple and red), where the killers are averaging a 70% kill rate (game is supposed to be balanced for 50% btw).  This perk is so devastating to you that it gives survivors a chance to escape?  A perk that can only be used once, under specific circumstances, and usually has to be saved until end game?
---
&gt;you are actively holding back from doing something you'd normally do even if you don't know for sure they have it.
---
That sounds like a you problem.  You realize as a killer you're not supposed to 4k every game right?  Survivors are supposed to escape as much as killers are supposed to kill.  Also BL was just nerfed into uselessness as the passive was the only part of that perk worth running anyway.
---
Tell me what the counters are to all the OHKOs killer have.  Oni's club, Billy's and Bubba's chainsaws, EW3 Mikey, Iridescent shard Huntress, Plague Power Puke, Ghostface's exposure, NOED, Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Iron Maiden, Rancor, etc.
---
Are these any different than DS for survivors?  Of course they are, because most of them can be used all game whenever you want!

Actually, I think that most killers try to hook Adam first so that he can't use Deliverance, one of his unique perks.
---
I love this
---
y'all are acting like the mode would be some esports BS, it would obviously just be a clusterfuck of a fun mode and is not worth "balancing"
---
Anyone else hear the spooky scary skeleton remix with this?
---
But then it'll join MoM in the "protection hits fucking suck" group.
---
He has the same reach as everyone
---
The penalties literally only apply if you leave within the first minute and doesn't affect people who suicide on hook which is the better way of "dcing" anyways.
---
If you did want to dc, you more or less just need to wait for a gen to pop and you're fine.
---
Ha I wish, maybe some day. My wife has been asking questions/taking interest as she watches me play. I have the console version, and just got the PC version, too. It'd be awesome to play in a SWF group.
---
Okay, so maybe it was an obvious comment to make. Sorry for being obtuse.
---
No he really doesn't
---
Are you okay
---
Any rework should absolutely incorporate the fact that their are more than one of them. Their name, the multiple models and cosmetics, it all plays into that and should be worked into their gameplay.
---
Oh... well in that case I take everything back. You should be more than fine. Maybe it is some freak mouse issue? Have you tried a different one?
---
Nice
---
I do, hes super fun imo!
---
eSports would be the last thing I'd ever want for DBD. If that happened, I'd uninstall.
---
Yeah this happened to my friend last night in a game, I think it's linked to the new Yui perk?
---
I‚Äôm almost positive that every killers range is the same there‚Äôs a little zone where the killers weapon is if your in it you get hit lol
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e62x9l/where_the_hell_am_i/
---
I'm terrible against him but I think it's just because I don't get to play against him that often
---
No wonder you won't depip
---
Yeah, I know how it is. I'm not arguing or anything, just curious actually. Personally, I don't even bother wasting money on survivors since they are all the same, basically. I just got Oni and I regret too so I feel you man. I don't think you can get a refund, but if you do... Well great, let me know tho lol
---
Yes he does. Latency and the fact he has a glove for a weapon make it seem like he doesnt
---
My only guess is that the implementation of __Breakout__ somehow broke the wiggle mechanic. This has already happened to me and some friends, fairly common and bothersome bug.
---
is the /s
---
Is that the one where you appear miles underneath the map and the screen goes white? And you can‚Äôt struggle or attempt escape?
---
Well Endgame was there, it even ended but the game keept still going
---
So it's a feature then
---
I'd rather they make other perks like no mither at least decent ratger than try to make MoM good again.
---
Just make the NPCs walk off to a random area that's at least 10m away from the edge of the map and patrol from there and not stay in 1 specific spot
---
She is better, but def not fixed. Survivor main btw B)

&gt;It's 60 seconds of invulnerability because he can't hook and kill you since you're just going to DS
---
You can slug him and mori him.
---
&gt;You can be slugged, but it's up to the killer if they're going to waste plenty of time chasing someone who they know they can't hook
---
Ok, so it's a calculated choice you make, not a design flaw.
---
&gt;It is for everyone because this version of DS is the same everyone and it doesn't matter if you're the obsession.
---
Was that even english?  It only works if YOU are unhooked.
---
&gt;Also the killer has no way of knowing if someone brought the perk or not
---
Why should the killer know what perks you have?  Survivors don't always know what the killer is running.  This is a weak argument.
---
&gt;5 seconds is plenty of time to get away from the killer if the door is open.
---
Survivors are supposed to escape, what's the problem here?
---
&gt;Also being unhooked within a minute easy when the EGC is only 2 minutes.
---
Sure, assuming the doors are open, the hatch hasn't been closed, and the doors didn't spawn next to each other.  Oh also if all 4 survivors are alive and the killer doesn't have NOED.
---
Nah, no need to be sorry. I was actually hoping we could get a comment chain of people literally saying the same thing over and over again. Please don't be offended by my memeing.
---
Idk which i love more. The cute doggo or the topper
---
Camping is not against the rules it's rude to do but not against the rules. Just like Tunneling is also the same way. Stuff that is actually against the rules is cheating (obviously), comparing the person playing the killer to an awful person, and pretty much anything that affects the person playing is against the rules not the in-game character.
---
Really? I haven't had a single bad game against the Oni yet and he was the only killer I got put up against yesterday, the most that were sacrificed in a match was 2 people and that only happened once.
---
*Me and Dwight on a gen*
---
*Dwight blows up gen*
---
*Me and Dwight stay on*
---
My sister: *watching me play* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised the killer didn‚Äôt come.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre probably chasing someone else.‚Äù

3 seconds later: *exposed by Ghostface*

Lmfaooo, I just looked at his comments - yup. Defending Tru3 left and right. Not surprised.
---
From the game's perspective, you're either wiggling or not wiggling. There is no speed range, to prevent macros causing instant escapes.
---
Well please kill me! I want to hear the music and see the powers!
---
The Yamaoka Estate is really dark, I really hate playing it since you can barely see anything
---
Just 99 the hook and sabo it infront of killer
---
I love this. Had a Spirit the other day carrying me all around Hawkins trying to find the hatch, it was such a cute little adventure. I started wiggling after a while so maybe we could both look for it, but she kept shaking no like "Nah I got this don't worry." If you're out there, Ily &lt;3
---
Yeah, tou can break hooks, but only with toolboxes (some are better than others) or the perk Saboteur
---
Hmmm, tempting but I'll put you in the basement so you cant enjoy the experience &gt;:)
---
Yeah it encourages farming as well which is dumb.
---
STBFL got used a lot during that time.
---
My bad I didn't see that the context was about latency
---
&gt; BHVR has over 500 people
---
please tell me only around 30 or less are working on this.
---
I'm a simple man if I see Trapper push a survivors face into a bear trap I'll be a very happy man!
---
Your team playing poorly and causing you to lose doesnt mean the game is killer sided or that killers arent weak. You say 90% of survivors are derps, why balance around derps thats not the killers‚Äô fault or the games fault. I dont understand this mentality
---
its way too dark and its the inmersive P3 Claudette heaven the map even has some red hue on some parts that any blendette can just stand still and mesh with the environment
---
At least the art team excels in their work
---
I wish they'd just completely stop pumping out content for at least 6 months or so to clean op their game.  
---
I'm no programmer, but I'm worried there are problems in the base code and instead of fixing it, they build around the problem. And the more they build around it, the bigger the mess will become.   
---
I love this game and want to see it grow, but as is it's on pretty thin ice considering all the bullshit rn :/
---
They did, for the first week or two. Use your map offerings so you don‚Äôt get it.
---
A piece of their mind
---
Before weird dark screen I had a white screen and I thought they added Heavens to dbd
---
That‚Äôs true. I do enjoy their art. :)
---
Oh yeah, you're right...imagine 4 neas waiting for the flashing save while other 3 are doing gens. So much fun...
---
My favorite is that even with the 70% kill average of red rank killers reddit refuses to accept that the game isn't killer biased right now.
---
I'm a shit killer, I don't play it often, and even at mid rank I can 4k without any effort on practically perkless killers.
---
The spirit‚Äôs character design is the main reason I even play the game. The characters in this game are just stunning
---
&gt;By above a certain rank I'm assuming you mean high ranks (purple and red), where the killers are averaging a 70% kill rate (game is supposed to be balanced for 50% btw). This perk is so devastating to you that it gives survivors a chance to escape? A perk that can only be used once, under specific circumstances, and usually has to be saved until end game?
---
Not really relevant. We're just talking about the strength of DS relative to other survivor perks. You posted that it's extremely situational and only *used* to be one of the best perks. That's wrong. Now, whether or not the perk is balanced, whether or not the game is balanced vis a vis Survivor vs Killer winrates, that's a whole different discussion that I haven't offered an opinion on to you at all, and it's not what we're talking about. 
---
&gt;That sounds like a you problem. You realize as a killer you're not supposed to 4k every game right?
---
I'm supposed to try for it every game, though. Balance-wise, I should not always be successful at that, if I'm playing survivors of equal skill, yes.
---
&gt;Tell me what the counters are to all the OHKOs killer have. Oni's club, Billy's and Bubba's chainsaws, EW3 Mikey, Iridescent shard Huntress, Plague Power Puke, Ghostface's exposure, NOED, Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Iron Maiden, Rancor, etc.
---
Not really relevant to DS vs other survivor perks. 
---
&gt;Are these any different than DS for survivors? Of course they are, because most of them can be used all game whenever you want!
---
Not really contradictory to anything I said.
---
Getting mori‚Äôd after one down and having to restart the matchmaking
---
Ok, but that's a temporary problem. We already know they're working on a hotfix for it. As broken as DBD can be, situations like the current basement bug where shit gets completely FUBAR'd are fairly rare.
---
I kinda like it from a visual standpoint but I can understand why people would hate them given the everything.
---
WOowow you make such a good Myers :D
---
People seriously..... LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE. This has already been posted 100 times
---
Yep that's always fun lmao
---
Wait, where have they've said the D/C penalty is only for the first minute?
---
If another survivor is touching the killer he can't hook so dry hump that leg, dry hump it good!
---
We  NBA now boys
---
No. I am not. I am loosing all the people I have ever played with because they're fed up of the devs giving the killers everything to have a cakewalk against fully kitted survivors not thinking a second about what that means for beginners or low skilled people.
---
They are trying to balance around the 4 man sweaty swf.
---
To be honest at this point I'd be fine with any actual solution to like absolutely anything going on right now with the game
---
Stab number 12 and 13 almost made this video legendary.
---
So you are a mom that enjoys her sons playing video games....wonderfully astonishing. Thanks for allowing and encouraging your sons to be in this community.
---
That can also be put down to people not knowing how to play him yet (he‚Äôs been on the live build for a little over 24 hours- and even if you‚Äôre on PC, not everyone will have jumped onto the PTB to try him out).
---
Just played my first game with Oni and wow the blood orbs survivors leave on the ground really need to be toned down. Oni is rewarded so much by tunneling it's so hard to get away from him
---
You mean Bear?
---
That is THE perfect quote for that perk.
---
Post it to YouTube from your PlayStation. Then post the YouTube link.
---
Why balance around the 1%? Because its a MAJOR minority that feels like they are in the right? Fuck no. Dead by daylight IS a casual game. Otherwise they would've tried harder to make a competitive scene.
---
Nah.
---
When it happens and I‚Äôm killer I give the person a second chance because it isn‚Äôt fair, I just wish the glitch wasn‚Äôt even happening.
---
What did I say?
---
OP said he places a Bear below megs head.
---
I have no idea. At one point (when the game came to console), Trapper was essentially the only playable killer that didn‚Äôt nearly crash your console. 
---
As for now, I honestly don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve tried switch costumes to no avail. My guess would be something de synching with his traps.
---
I've never heard any news of someone being banned for custom icons as long as thats the only thing you change.
---
The windows look open now when theyre closed. It's frustrating.
---
yeah me to his hole deal is with traps and his mori is  him slashing megs back 3 tips not even deep
---
I remember one time where I had about 3 games in a row where somebody dc'd while it was loading
---
Did you steal this clip? I know I‚Äôve seen it before
---
'Smeagal mains waiting for the face fix'
---
I DC'D TWICE LAST NIGHT FOR NO REASON. MY ETHERNET CONNECTION SHOWED NO PROBLEM OTHERWISE. COULDN'T PLAY KILLER BECAUSE OF LAG AND DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE PEOPLE'S TIME IF I DC'D AGAIN. HOUR LATER EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE.
---
 BUGS ARE FRUSTRATING ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH BUT DEDICATED SERVER CRAP IS NOT PERMISSABLE.
---
 If the killer is camping, then rush gens, if he camped one person, he couldn't have gotten 18k BP, to get that he must have downed more than one surv.
---
I get it, its frustrating, i had a leatherface once camping basement (i went for the chest and he was just standing there, he literally hooked me and never left) the other survivors went ahead and rushed gens, he got very few BP, camping is in no way a rewarding strategy
---
You only wait 5 minutes for a Survivor lobby? Lucky
---
If you'd balance games around the top 1%. GL playing anything like dota, league, world of warcraft or whatever.
---
Lets say WoW. Mythic is now normal mode and we have Mythic, Mythic Hardcore and Mythic Extreme.
---
99% of the playerbase now cannot kill even 2 bosses of the content. People will unsubscribe and the game will die. Servers will shutdown because theres no moneyflow towards the company since they had 1 mil subscribers before and now only have 1000 left. Because the 99%, where the content was too ridiculously hard leaves.
---
How does that sound? I mean yeah, its probably exaggerated but the point stands.
---
oh yes of course, like we get it DBD can be taken as a challenge but there's so many people on this subreddit who act like DBD is professional gameplay
---
People wanted the Legion to be removed when he came out and at this point he basically is. They're no better than a Trapper without traps or Clown without bottles, AKA an m1 killer with no power.
---
That's why I said I'll be glad if it would happen... I don't see the weird direction this chat is going?
---
&gt;Not really relevant.
---
If it's not relevant, than why did you bring it up?
---
It's not the best perk, it's not even close.
---
As for the rest, my point is you want to bitch about one perk, that isn't that commonly used anymore (used to be every survivor, every match), that is situational, can only be used once, and requires a hard skill check.  You call it over powered and so game changing that killers have to change the way they think about the game.  But you won't address any of easy mode perks the killers have that have no situational requirements or hard checks.
---
They just dont care anymore. They want more. They want this to be brainlessly easy to get the other side. 4k or loss. Thats their view.
---
Ive only ever faced like 2 demogorgons. Kinda sad.
---
Yesss I've dealt with that too when I've been playing with my friend group. Usually when that happens we all go silent and just go "Yup. We're done" and go play something else lol
---
Iridescent mothering
---
copyright holders of Nightmare on Elm Street *will not budge*
---
Or above lol. But yeah, that's the one.
---
Smh maybe stop playing immersed all the time! Godamn Blendette
---
Sure. Stats also show that all killers are viable. He might not be too tier, but people acted like he and clown couldn't get kills before we were shown that simply wasn't the case.
---
BECAUSE I FINISHED IT. IM ABOUT TO DO THE EXAM.
---
It's just fun to mori a streamer live on the air!  
---
If you want to show you tag be ready to get tagged and bagged!
---
The two sides of every killer, neither is wrong if they both have fun
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of clowns out the past two days.  I mean it‚Äôs gotta be a joke if you think I‚Äôm going to ready up when I see a swf with matching names, three toolboxes, and a map. I chuckle as I hit the back out button.
---
GL
---
Just saw that I was wrong! If you end up getting a refund &amp; happen to remember this thread I‚Äôd appreciate an update! üòä
---
His name is A-Bomb you uncultured swine
---
But that wouldn't fix anything, in fact that would make legion easily the most powerful killers. They could just slap the survivor once then either run them to death in 10 seconds or they have to stop running and you can hit them again. Every chase would end in 20 seconds max as long as FF was up.
---
Is this true?
---
I CAN'T EVEN PLAY A MATCH. OVER THE PAST WEEK IT'S BEEN NONSTOP DISCONNECTS, TUNNELING, CAMPING, DISCONNECTING AS SOON AS THE MATCH STARTS, SURVIVORS THAT SUICIDE AFTER 30 SECONDS, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
---
I'M TRYING TO LEVEL CHARACTERS BUT IT'S TAKEN ME LIKE 8 HOURS TO GET 300K BP BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T DISCONNECT, PEOPLE WILL FEED THEMSELVES TO THE KILLER AND SUICIDE AFTER 30 SECONDS. I GET LIKE 10K BP A MATCH IF THAT. AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ACTUALLY ESCAPING.
---
I did that quest and actually had to get iridescent shards in 15 separate matches. It was not counting multiple ones per match.
---
Ya
---
How do they do the terror radius? This sounds so cute lol
---
Sounds like the real problem is the other Killer.
---
I read your name as LimpArmpit for some reason be it it's definitely not that hahaha
---
So that's why people got angry in the endgame chat when I was doing my basement tomes
---
Someone else actually commented that they‚Äôve gotten refunded before! So luckily we both probably can! And yea I know you‚Äôre not arguin I don‚Äôt mind the questions lol
---
Ok thanks!
---
Lmao, yeah I usually just hop on Netflix or somethin
---
I drive a box truck &amp; was really confused with the "jake break" reference for a minute...
---
I took one look at the jokes about 2nd and 3rd tome and just thought, "yeah I'm not doing any of this unless they just happen, sounds boring and ruins the fun"
---
Yes, but it won't be long before he catches on and swoops you a new one so you'll have to tiem it so the carried survivor can wiggle free otherwise you're giving him a free hit and blow your chande to get a rescue of before being healed.
---
There is also that you are left to die more than this happens, but sure. Survivors are assholes all the time. Nobody intelligent blah blah blah
---
They said in an interview or a Livestream (can't remember what atm) that they actually tried a mechanic to deny being unhooked but they said it didn't have the results they were wanting. So i assume it's probably a good thing we don't have it.

Mans be cookin'
---
I‚Äôll remember don‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôd not I‚Äôll just make a new post lol! I‚Äôm going to try for it tonight and hopefully it works out!
---
THANKS BRO. HOPEFULLY I DONT REPEAT THIS YEAR:) IF I SUCCEED, WANNA GO FOR A DRINK?
---
are u mental? Oni is fine.
---
I‚Äôm saying, they shouldn‚Äôt have taken out the terror radius part of it. That could‚Äôve quite possibly the dumbest change they‚Äôve made in a long time
---
That sucks... any suggestions for maps that won‚Äôt make killers dc
---
This sound is giving me war flashbacks.
---
He is so easily juked
---
I feel you, I was working on leveling up feng and I was gonna do Laurie after and then DS came out oof
---
Haha
---
It‚Äôs not that people are upset it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs natural order you brought this upon yourself by having that name we don‚Äôt make the rules we just follow them
---
Now I wish I could go back in reddit time. That name is far superior.
---
Me: cries in Freddy main...
---
&gt; Tunneling is boring
---
And here is the opinion stated as fact that undermines your whole argument.
---
When your whole argument hinges on an opinion, nothing you say really matters.
---
is there supposed to just be no counterplay?
---
You saying you don't like "Pitch Black"?  
---
You Vin Diesel hating bastard get ready to taste my Mori!
---
I feel you friend... it makes me sad because as survivor I‚Äôve been getting crushed by Oni, but then I play and it‚Äôs like ‚Äòlol I‚Äôm so bad‚Äô
---
Game's haunted
---
You can also partially sabotage a hook and leave it at 99% to tap later. Useful for running round in front of the killer and popping hooks before they can reach them, allowing any downed survivers to wiggle off!
---
That almost happened to me yesterday but they didn‚Äôt know where I was and I opened the exit door and got out lol
---
And it‚Äôs funny, cause so far the Onis I‚Äôve played have no idea how to use him and got stomped into the ground.
---
Feels like mud with a controller.
---
I hate that when someone uses a key and there‚Äôs still gens left it completes the gen when you close it like what?? Not to mention how BS of an item it is on the first place
---

I mean, yes, the game is still quite buggy, but I do enjoy playing it. Despite Oni not being fully console compatible, I find that BHVR did the most with the last 2 patches. The rift is awesome, the Japanese themed lobby looks cool, we finally get the latest chapter trailer as the intro video for the game, lore is expanding, we got code-exclusive cosmetics for free, my best girl Laurie finally got some cosmetics besides her stiff pineapple wig, we got a free sweater for Bill, eventhough nobody asked, and it looks awesome. 
---
The bugs still persist, but things like these soften the blow for me.
---
Not again! Last time my friend guided me up the stairs and out of the shack just for me to get downed again.
---
I mean, it was less broken before the update
---
A "fucking game" you say?  
---
And where good sir/ma'am would that fucking take place?
---
`** Crosses his fingers **` ^(PLz, say basement, plz say basement...)
---
You‚Äôre right he should just be able to spam insta down every survivor and it should not take any skill or any type of learning curve! üëç get gud kid he‚Äôs been out for a day...
---
Still tho
---
As someone who plays both sides, the issue is that there is no short straw there. If you're just giving it to someone because they're the last one left, there is a high chance it's because that person didn't help as much as they should have, are the reason everyone else is dead, and potentially because that person literally ignored the others or played solely for themselves, and now they're being rewarded for it.
---
From the killers perspective no, you can't see it every time, but if you pay attention to who is who, you'll start to notice who shows up last a lot more.
---
Giving hatch for me is specifically for those that played well against me, or someone who got fucked over, or something of that nature, for this reason.
---
"Last one alive" isn't a straw pulling contest.
---
Played against a Myers, but only played two surv games due to wanting to test out the Oni and Legion rework
---
Did they slightly modify Yui's face or am I dreaming? I feel like she looks better than in PTB!
---
I can't remember the last game as killer I had where at least one of the survivors was running it, and frequently more than one. 
---
Name even two perks that are better. There aren't any. Even Dead Hard can't compare because it can't create the kind of space or comeback that DS can. Iron Will is only better against Spirit. Adrenaline is endgame only and you've already stated that's a disqualifying aspect. Balanced Landing is a dead perk on some maps. Lithe forces you to make inefficient choices sometimes. Borrowed Time is only useful for helping teammates, does nothing for you. Unbreakable is only good if the killer slugs. Spine Chill ranges from useless to broken, and is the definition of situational. 
---
&gt;As for the rest, my point is you want to bitch about one perk, that isn't that commonly used anymore (used to be every survivor, every match), that is situational, can only be used once, and requires a hard skill check. You call it over powered and so game changing that killers have to change the way they think about the game. But you won't address any of easy mode perks the killers have that have no situational requirements or hard checks.
---
Well, if you'd actually read my post, you would note I specifically did not make a balance assessment on it. I never said "overpowered." My post was entirely on DS' power *relative to other survivor perks*.
---
my favorite thing to message in egc is tips for that killer
---
You lack reading comprehension. Do you really think making killers bring Moris is good for the game, or are you just trying to find a counter to something that doesn't have a counter? 
---
Yeah it's a choice, but barely one. If you chase them then you can't get a hook, and if you leave them be then they just got 60 seconds of invulnerability. 
---
It does not just work for the person who brings it, since the killer has no idea who brought it
---
That forces the killer to play like everyone has DS even if they don't. 
---
Never said survivors aren't supposed to escape, but nice strawman. 
---
If the hatch is closed or the doors are close together no perk is letting you leave. And you don't need 4 Survivors alive, you just need 2. And what does NOED have to do with anything?
---
There was still one gen left in my case sadly.
---
What is the basement glitch?
---
Beat the devil out of it

I kinda want to check out the Dutch translation now, just for shits and giggles.

Who exactly is high rank in this picture? üòÖ

Gamer kids are the best. I remember when she went through a minecraft phase like every other kid, I‚Äôd fall asleep while playing that game with her lol. As bad as it sounds, I even let her mess around on GTA a couple of years back, under my supervision of course &amp; she thought Trevor was hilarious. Now she‚Äôs into this &amp; I couldn‚Äôt be happier haha. I wish y‚Äôall two the best of luck when y‚Äôall become parents :)
---
Guys you are all wrong. Killers tunnel Adam, because they hate deliverance and want his perk to be useless.
---
Oh, I see what you mean now. I agree that they made deep wounds basically nothing now, but removing the terror radius part was necessary to fix the interaction with Freddy and legion+nemesis/beast of prey. I personally think they should have made it proximity based as a fix.
---
Alright done now how do I get a cool nickname like stuck in pallet or something else
---
Can I pet your pupper?
---
Cause many people nowadays, especially in this sub, love to complain whilst being lazy and meme-hungry. If something requieres more time to commit to than 60 seconds, it's not worth the attention.
---
And yet everyone's astonished about Behavior not doing what the community wants.
---
If you want the community to listen to anything you've to say, try to merge a TLDR form of your statement into one of those totally overused meme formats that are literally everywhere. It's literally the only way to get your suggestion / opinion / statement onto more than just 2 people.
---
You only get 1 count per game, so it's best to just focus on one Iridescent emblem. You'll have to grind it out we all have/had to do it.
---
Make Trappers him stomping a survivors head into a bear trap 
---
Make Wraith beat the survivor over their head with the bell and every time he hits them he cloaks and uncloaks 
---
Make Billy‚Äôs have the survivor stand up look around and have Billy no where to be seen the out of nowhere Billy runs in impaling the survivor with his chainsaw and lifting them above his head
---
Sounds like you got matched with a SWF group.
---
oh no this bug is back? it's really old and i don't quite remember the details...but I def remember seeing it before like in 2016-17
---
There are tons of games that balance around the best players. Like literally every fighting game ever, overwatch, rainbow six, etc. and those games do very well. Its because they reward getting better at the game and adapting if those games coddled newer players or low skill players it would be disastrous because nobody would have any reason to try and improve. The motivation for newer players to get good is often seeing top level play like someone might watch a street fighter tournament and see some hype shit like 8 perfect parries in a row leading to an insane comeback. They are motivated because they feel if the get good they will be rewarded by being able to pull off hype shit themselves. Whats the motivation to get better at dbd? Your main objective requires no skill as you just hold a button and tap another and when in chase you have so many get out of jail free cards that you can remain mediocre and still consistently win. Also i would like to know from your testing how many of those games did you pip? Because that is winning a pip is a personal win, escaping is a team effort.
---
Sweet home Alabama intensifies.
---
The only way to play pallets is if you think they're gonna swing through it then you should keep running so they dont hit you. When you stall to throw the pallet their swing will reach you. Hard to learn timing but you're gonna get hit through the pallet if you throw it after the killer starts a swing.
---
i can't believe the only way to get kills as legion is to get survivors to do it for you
---
They could‚Äôve just made it so undetectable doesn‚Äôt effect deep wound but they changed a whole killer instead lol
---
Corn: **Exists**
---
Survivors: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs free real estate‚Äù
---
Freddy mains in the corner sobbing
---
SURE
---
He almost tier 3d himself
---
Apparently there's now a huge bug where hooking a survivor in the basement causes their screen to turn completely white, rendering them effectively blind for the rest of the match.
---
A wizard did it
---
Hitboxes are always the same size but smaller killers like Freddy for example or hag feel like they are to far away from the pallet but their hitbox isn't because of this.
---
If 4 neas are waiting and other 3 are doing gens that is the problem of the other killer.
---
I haven't even had the chanve to play against him yet. Jesus slow down
---
Have you tried queuing as a rank 20 recently, bahroo for example when he re started playing was around that rank and couldn‚Äôt find matches for a long time, mix that in with extra killers playing and the queues will be longer.
---
Aw that sucks ): Ofc if it causes more issues or didn't work as they planned its better to not have it
---
The entire point of his comment was Oni encourages a playstyle that isn‚Äôt fun to play against and the player (killer) cannot try different strategies without intentionally harming their chances of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù  Not a single person on this sub and I doubt the wider DBD thinks tunneling is fun. ‚ÄúLet me chase the same guy over and over again for at least 5 minutes‚Äù  is appealing to literally no one. Nothing you say matters because your entire paragraph of projection was hinged entirely on the opinion that ‚Äútunneling isn‚Äôt boring :((‚Äú  while completely ignoring the criticism that Oni is poorly fucking designed because he‚Äôs only good if you play one way
---
Comments like these make me wonder if I should put a shirt back on David, but then I think why would I deprive myself, my fellow survivors and the Killer from the joy and glory of beholding shirtless David King? 
---
I also got shirtless Frank, although he does have body paint on.
---
Doin a pretty good job so far
---
I wish I didn‚Äôt find this as hilarious as I did...
---
You have to spend a couple minutes getting your power which is especially a hill billy chainsaw that can be easily dodged
---
Abbott and Costello as survivors plox.
---
What's the context of this pic?
---
My whole argument was summed up at the two points on the bottom.
---
&gt; 1. No one gets to dictate how another person plays within the game mechanics.
---
&gt; 2. Your opponent trying to win is not toxic.
---
Which of those two points do you disagree with, specifically?

They would have had to change oblivious as well, but yeah I get your point. Maybe this was less work for them?
---
Aww a baby dweety!
---
I was saying the same thing last night! But it was because it was my first time playing him and it was against rank 1‚Äôs. They bullied me...
---
Both of which are opinions, This entire post is literally just saying that Oni encourages tunneling and it‚Äôs pretty fucking clear you haven‚Äôt played 10 seconds of Oni because unless you tunnel Oni will not be performing at his best
---
Yah that was my plan. I thought maybe something with the logitech software is messing it up but i checked my windows setting sna dlogitech‚Äôs and i dont have any acceleration or anything on. Its weird because it only started a few days ago. I mean i don‚Äôt mind playing with a controller but its just weird that it happens. I‚Äôe tried running it with freesync off and it didnt help i thought that would have been the culprit. Seems like dbd doesn‚Äôt have a vsync option to change either.
---
There's a lot that Clown mains can be sad about
---
ye. except that billy  one wouldnt work well with inside maps
---
My favorite is when i start the game as the Rancor obsession, and then somebody else DS's into the obsession slot and i get to walk away scot free.
---
Haha David is my main. But I haven't unlocked shirtless. I use custom everything except the big green jacket just because he really does blend into the colour of most scenery and just looks like a rock, and I play stealth builds a lot. Otherwise I would be shirtless all the way.
---
You are too far gone friend. We need the shirtless Davids, without them we are all gonners.
---
&gt; got stuck inside generators twice when damaging them.
---
this happened to an oni last game LOL.
---
I'm sure he's viable at high ranks but at rank 7 downwards he is a little iffy
---
aight
---
So... your son let you use his reddit account, risky kid
---
Theres been hundreds of posts about this, everyone already knows
---
2v10 is where survivors have to survive for 10-15 minutes before 4 exit gates are powered
---
Not every killer has to be as broke as GhostFace. So if you expect a infinite stalk Myers and a power practically impossible to cut, keep playing GF
---
His second last stab gave me anxiety... he was inches away from stabbing his hand :'D but the bottle flip saved it XD
---
Annie?
---
I don't really remember the amount of pips i got. Most of the times i black pipped because people were not unhooking, killer was to close or whatever.
---
The difference between fighting games and DBD is that fighting games are 1v1. Thus meaning balancing can NOT be translated to DBD in the slightest. Overwatch is also a symmetrical game where you can adapt while playing (choosing different characters)  and the strategy behind that is what makes this game balanced. Have a hanzo in enemy team? Get shields or whatever.
---
In DBD there is no such thing. If you bring Object of Obsession vs a T1 myers on lerys? You just wasted everything.
---
Also still: If the game was trying to become competitive like ALL the game you mentioned above, i'd see the point. But nothing you said counts for casual games.
---
After experiencing this all the time, I've actually changed my playstyle and now rarely (1 out of 20 games maybe) ever called camper. It feels good. Try it and you may like it too.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of things that have brought me joy on this sub. Ash and Ghostface leaks (as well as the leaked outfit for Michael), god-Tier plays, very well made memes and clips with editing that astounds me.
---
But all of that pales in comparison to this. This is truly the best thing we‚Äôll ever see on this sub, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
---
Software is a different realm. Don‚Äôt apply your real life transactional expectations to this. If it was easy: armchair developers like yourself could fix it.
---
Can confirm
---
I didn't notice any significant difference in the one game I played against her so far.
---
PTB is the Public Test Build, literally in place to test out the game before major releases. I'm not seeing what's so difficult to understand here
---
It's really hard to play Pig or Hag on the new map, you can't see shit in the foliage.
---
Yeah, sorry, i Just noticed, but my first post was the first one that talked about it as far as im aware
---
Oh that's obobobo? From the dark souls days? Never seen his face
---
I really wish they would change the name of exposed. Its name and function make no sense
---
"Thanks! &lt;3 " How about an apology?
---
Aww yes I'd love to run up to survivors and blow myself up
---
Was it scary before???
---
Nope this is my acct i had questions about various things including dbd.
---
Thank you! Every year on halloween I dress as him, they call me the Maple Street Myers (I live on that street) And no one knows who I am &gt;:)
---
And the devs say that Oni is capable of turning faster than intended on console versions

I think black and white makes it what it is! Great!
---
Can't wait for the Billy Bubba combo
---
If it's not a balance assessment, than what is your complaint?  That you just don't like it?  That's not a valid argument against anything.
---
Everything stems from balance, if you agree it's balanced and it's the most powerful perk, than the rest of the survivor perks are underpowered.
---
I don't want him to be amazing I just want him to be somewhat easier to play at low ranks
---
Plan.
---
Oh cool, how long have you been playing dbd, have you gotten any good at it
---
In the entity‚Äôs realm there are people who can teleport, and people don‚Äôt die when hit with a chainsaw, unless specially done. I don‚Äôt think a lot of the rules of the real world apply
---
These would be great as in-game charms.
---
I also noticed a haddonfield game was really dark too. Almost looked like updated textures actually but wasnt sure

The devs need to like quadruple our sensitivity
---
I mean most of the things you listed are things the devs explained on stream that they were well aware of I.e ques, ranks, matchmaking, dead hard ect. Textures is new, I run high performance and I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt had a problem with neither that or lighting so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not and everyone issue or you have a po boy setup.
---
The rest sounds like rant that‚Äôs been going on since shortly after release. As for balancing and ‚Äúruin‚Äù its a thing in the game that can be removed quickly or not at all, it doesn‚Äôt make the game impossible for either side so people seriously need to stop complaining about it.
---
Don‚Äôt like using ruin all the time as killer? Get better and take it off, but prepare to be gen rushed. ‚ÄúGen rush‚Äù being a term people use when they fail to apply pressure on generators.
---
Can‚Äôt hit ruin skillchecks as survivor? Sounds like a personal problem.
---
dude same. i can't imagine what the other survivors thought when i'd just immediately start panicking and run away
---
"I'mma unhook 'em"
---
"David, no"
---
"David YES"
---
Me! Purple rank is high ranks!
---
oh shit ok
---
4 seconds üëç
---
3 mins of being looped and you've already lost though. Not really terrifying when you know the killer has already lost. I wish they had kept his faster pallet break, because now his ability doesn't help with loops at all...
---
Mmmm, Jeff... ü•∞
---
On Xbox Ive been seeing nothing but Plague and Ghostface for some reason
---
I guess you missed the Legion changes this patch. DBD ain't going nowhere.
---
I probably get that a lot these days.. I tend to run spine chill and if it starts going off I get twitchy... course to this day, the funniest moment was the time I was playing SWF and moved the camera to see Myers... he's the reason I do slow 360's around myself when working on something in game
---
I count to 5 after the actual hook happens, and then leave the locker. The killer should only be able to see auras for 4 seconds.
---
Although tbf, Hag is a killer designed to encourage camping and discourage chasing.
---
&gt;If you chase them then you can't get a hook, and if you leave them be then they just got 60 seconds of invulnerability.
---
Have you tried downing them and hooking them?  Because they can't DS unless they were already hooked and saved in the last 60 seconds!  Also I don't think you know what invulnerability means.  Borrowed Time gives you invulnerability for a short time, DS doesn't give you anything of the sort. It's really not that difficult to understand.
---
&gt;It does not just work for the person who brings it, since the killer has no idea who brought it That forces the killer to play like everyone has DS even if they don't.
---
Or you know, just play the game normally and if someone has it, they have it. 
---
&gt;Never said survivors aren't supposed to escape, but nice strawman.
---
And yet here you are bitching about a perk that gives survivors a chance to escape.
---
&gt;And what does NOED have to do with anything?
---
You keep bringing up the point that you don't know who has DS until they use it.  Survivors don't know you have NOED until it's active.  There are equally strong perks on both sides, and yet only one side is every bitching.
---
well shame on you for being younger.
---
Gotta love that old killer vault animation that used to take 25 years
---
Make it so the unhooker can only be exposed after very shortly of the hook,else campers will abuse it
---
Nice play!
---
Ok bye
---
Honestly, in terms of balance, if the devs changed it from 3 hooks to two hooks then the gen speed wouldn't be an issue. Though, that would suck for survivors that get farmed and tunneled.
---
This would be me, except i'd miss the DS skillcheck like a boosted rank 20
---
The person lagging here was probably you or just the server dying.
---
I got 1-2 iridescent emblems in both games (that I had the challenge activated) but I didn't get any counted.
---
That makes a lot of sense!
---
Unfortunately that won't happen though. A few weeks ago the devs of dbd made an 'ask-me-anything' post on reddit. Someone asked them if they would ever skip a chapter to focus morr on the games health. Not_Queen responded saying they won't do that, since people like them...
---
I've been playing him for a bit and when his power is active he's pretty hard to use in jungle gyms so if you can find one run him around there

That shouldn't have worked as that was an unsafe pallet. Lol
---
I wouldn't have broken it anyways, I would of just gone around.
---
Yes, exactly. This isn‚Äôt unique to dbd. I play rainbow 6, and people will die within 45 seconds of the first round, usually because they tried rush tactics, and leave the match immidiately
---
I genuinely attempted to take the protection hit and let her escape. I did too, the chainsaw just happened to get her too. It wasn't farming, it was an attempted save. She messaged me after she said she was in the void anyways.
---
.... I was the older brother lol
---
I think this is similar to the old basement desync bug from, I think, around when Legion was released or somewhere around then.  Reducing fps cap to 50-60 may be a fix if it‚Äôs the same general issue.  Otherwise idk what sort of bandaid might fix it.
---
Weird... Can't compare anymore really I grinded it out before the patch then you only got 1 count no matter if you had 2, 3 or 4 iridescent's at the end of the game.
---
Hey! Don‚Äôt make fun of people with Down Syndrome! You disgust me! They are the nicest sweetest and I they look beautiful!
---
True, but you're also neglecting to mention that this was a time where Borrowed Time made both the unhooker and the unhooked survivor temporarily invincible (once per match). Things like Adrenaline and DS didn't also need to be anti-camp because Borrowed pretty much gave your team up to 4 free unhooks even vs a facecamper.
---
Yes, "only".  Or would you prefer they go back to where it was always active, or where you just had to wiggle for it?
---
strong if you know how to play it. It‚Äôs not a perk that you just sit around with. The best play to make is try to have someone stun you that‚Äôs injured. Because you can then leave them to switch to someone else while they have no clue as to where they are. From what I‚Äôve seen this always leads to them cowering in fear of you being behind them. But that‚Äôs in purple ranks. This might not apply in
---
It was me, but I thought the clip was actually funny.
---
Very Interesting I like the idea but I've seen alot of people talk about having a killer then can send decoys to run in a direction for a specific time. I think that might work better for legion and it would get rid of some of the broken things pointed out.
---
Mom of Mettle
---
60 seconds is a long ass time for a survivor to be invincible.
---
Everyone gettin reworks but the boi still lookin real ruff. F 
---
(I doubt the actor cares, but I think he‚Äôs a good looking male and the game doesn‚Äôt do him justice)
---
Trapper not being able to immediately walk over his traps are mostly because of dedicated servers.
---
Anotjer reason why bloodpoints should be removed.
---
I like having the trailer from the most recent chapter, because after 1k hours you kinda get bored from the crow stuff. If they just make it so the intro vid changes with every chapter, that'd be great
---
he‚Äôs that crazy to the point where you gotta dodge twice
---
Before this deep wound nerf, yes.
---
So i've decided that if I down someone right at the basement, i'll look for a hook outside of it so your game isn't ruined. but if you struggle, it's on you.
---
This has happened to me but I didn‚Äôt get the names
---
I think i've managed to successfully do that with this post here lol. Somewhat at least.
---
Ooof, even though it‚Äôs super counter productive...I also play a stealth build...with shirtless David King. Which adds to why I question my choice of clothing or lack thereof. 
---
I always like Urban and Spine Chill, for the last two I switch between Lithe, Distortion, Quick &amp; Quiet and WGLF for the unhooking challenges.
---
I get people do it to just give up on a match, but counter point: Purposely giving up on the hook so a teammate can get the hatch.
---
Well it‚Äôs fairly different because it was literally impossible to escape legion on ptb.
---
I have many clips of a survivor and killer working together to kill me. It‚Äôs actually disheartening
---
4 seconds but I always stay in an extra second just in case :P
---
there are multiple tome challenges requiring basement hooks.
---
As a killer main, I just attack the closest thing to me!
---
I think Otz did this on his stream when he found out about Nemesis
---
I have no problems playing way more demanding games on higher settings with stable 60FPS unlike DBD which I need to play on Low to stay at 60 for most of the time (Game still has random occasional drops, even up to -30) and it's not like it has amazing graphics in the first place.
---
Stuff like this: https://streamable.com/ooaql happens, not always but it does... on low settings despite me being over recommended specs.
---
Yo, the Legion call out was for laughs. This post is about Myers
---
Reverse Chainsaw into Quentin hiding in a corner
---
Except you're not invincible, at all.
---
Depends on the survivor, there are a lot of potato red rank survivors the closer you get to rank reset. Most red rank survivors would probably just work on a gen that is out in the open or heal next to a pallet with low walls surrounding it.
---
I like to imagine that the entity kinda warped them into one amalgamated being when it took them, makes them cooler to me. The creepiest part of their backstory was the way Julie, Susie, and Joey lose their individuality and begin to blindly follow Frank. He is like a charismatic cult leader, and reading the flavor text of their addons shows how he began with relatively innocent fun like the "Mischief List" but slowly manipulated them into going further and further until they are willing to kill for him.
---
That seems to be the cautionary tale or "lesson" of their story, to maintain your individuality and moral compass instead of allowing yourself to be caught up in peer pressure and a desire to belong. It would seem fitting for the entity to skew and mock this character flaw by turning them into a literal Legion. A being made up of smaller beings but without free will, operated by a hive mind.
---
It would strengthen their character design to see that idea reflected in their visuals, with pieces of the other legion members mashed up into each other. Or even if just their idle animation on character select shifted constantly from one character to the other to show they arent four distinct independent beings any more.

Did you even read the post? I‚Äôm asking if anybody else has this issue going on I can‚Äôt even play properly because I‚Äôm sitting there flicking my finger accidentally and looking at the sky instantly

my friend described that happening to him, but all I saw was him laying there in the basement because he got downed after the save.
---
Um.... Borrowed Time, making killers lose points/ emblems when close to hooked survivors, Adrenaline's quality of life changes, DS rework, and then the classic "fuck the unhook just do the gens." Camping has plenty of counterplay and there have been anti-camping mechanics pretty much the entire lifetime of the game.

Ok tru3

Yeah and I'm sure killers would have fun with that as well.....
---
You are one of the people that make this community so fucked up. Only caring about YOUR fun but not about overall fun for both sides and thus not caring about game health.
---
That‚Äôs more due to the timing of it. The Rift was tied into what was functionally DBD‚Äôs Halloween update, and they only let us know the day before it was supposed to go live. It also (AFAIR) didn‚Äôt ship with two known game breaking bugs.
---
Did the miss the part where he got chainsawed?
---
How would he be worse at lower ranks?
---
LMAO and what happened after that buddy?? üòÇ

I don‚Äôt remember if it was Otz or another streamer, but someone definitely did it
---
You just noticed?
---
Are they Adidas pants?? üòÇ
---
poor trapper just wanted somebody to hold his hand
---
Nah, coveralls lol
---
This is true. Often the last survivor standing is just the one who played selfishly, avoided the Killer completely and didn‚Äôt attempt to help the others out. 
---
On the other hand, it‚Äôs also often better for *someone* to avoid the Killer in order to complete the gens while the others keep the Killer occupied. It can be a waste of time for multiple people to try to go for the save. 
---
NGL, I can be that selfish survivor at times since I do tend to use a stealth build because I suck at chases though.
---
same, i got new content on BL3 now and a DLC is coming soon so I'll be focusing on that more. Plus I play Conan Exiles sometimes to get that builder fix and still trying to beat Last of Us remastered on grounded. Just started it with grounded thinking I can handle and godamn along with the bullshit stealth mechanics at least in my experience, im still stuck on it lolol

Its not as easy as "just fix it quicker." It takes time to locate the cause of the issue. There probably trying to fix it as fast as they can but it's not that easy
---
We got what we asked for. Us gamers are the most gullible consumer group of all, we have no self respect. We constantly get fucked in our asses and then we defend the very people that ass fuck us while giving them money for changing some colors of pixels on our characters. We are pathetic, they know we are pathetic, they won't hire any help, they won't improve because they know they don't have to. And they're right. This will blow over, new cosmetics will release and we'll throw money at them like we always do. We don't respect ourselves so why should they respect us?
---
So old legion with frank‚Äôs mixtape built in, ‚Äúrework‚Äù frenzy running speed, new legion vault, and a power that allows them to ignore loops and regenerate when they hit the person they‚Äôre ‚Äútargetting.‚Äù
---
I think this would only make legion more infuriating for people getting targeted, and basically be not a problem for the other 3 survivors. Legion‚Äôs power is disruption through forcing survivors to stop what they‚Äôre doing and mend, whilst also applying pressure through the ability to use vaults quickly to get up close and personal. This idea basically takes away that whole aspect of mass disruption and punishing survivors for sticking together by turning legion back into ‚Äústab the person with Frank‚Äôs, chase, stab with Frank‚Äôs, chase, stab with Frank‚Äôs‚Äù but there‚Äôs no actual chase with no cooldown on the power, it‚Äôs just brute forcing and would be unfun to play against like when Legion released.
---
I don‚Äôt really have anything to add when it comes to rework ideas, but there are basically two things that define a good and a bad killer. Power reliance and general strength. If the power is useful during the chase and getting the down, then it‚Äôs an alright or good killer. If the power barely helps at all or is useless, then it‚Äôs a bad killer. if the power is up 24/7 during a chase and it‚Äôs super oppressive/can‚Äôt be counter played (like old nurse, old spirit, and old legion), then it‚Äôs way too strong and needs to be looked at. Oni is a good example of what to do with a power. Force the killer to make plays, and earn their power. His is strong because the survivors have to screw up and let him hit them, punishing them for not being careful. Trapper and clown are also good examples, as they spend time having to (in the case of trapper) pick up traps, or refresh bottles.
---
That‚Äôs just my take on it, probably gonna get shit on and downvoted into hell
---
TL;DR. Just delete the game if you don't want to play, no one wants to read 8 paragraphs of you complaining about it man.

Excactly, but it's obviously hard to pull of when it comes to OC that is no visual art. For example a synthwave remix.

Then he hit the skill check allowing him off.  Or are you saying he should have had no chance to escape there?
---
Are we also going to ignore the fact that Billy was able to down him in one hit?  Is that any more fair than a survivor getting away from being carried once?
---
Are we also going to ignore the fact that the killer allowed them to finish all 5 gens and open the doors without a single kill?
---
I do it like in five minutes in my mobile phone, so no big deal lol
---
You must be really terrible at Survivor if you're having trouble with him.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e648cm/guys_watch_out/
---
There was also an issue where there was no counterplay for unhooked survivors against Freddy, even if you did have endurance you‚Äôd just bleed out if he decided to sleep you and chase you after unhook. I‚Äôm guessing it was a solution to both that and the  Nemesis+Legion problem.
---
Agreed.  It's really a translation hiccup for sure.  Should be something like "vulnerable" maybe?
---
Gotta brine up those survivors first to make really good chili

C'mon, we all know that hand is at least at big as an actual car.

ultra rare addon allows legion members in a locker to grab survivors that try to hide in it if they can't wiggle free in time the killer can grab them out of the locker for an ez hook
---
Shortly after spirit came out, I was playing a game against one that didn‚Äôt have ruin. I came across a hex totem and figured ‚Äúit‚Äôs a spirit, who was released recently, and who doesn‚Äôt have ruin. It‚Äôs probably haunted ground, so I‚Äôll just leave it.‚Äù Later that game, when devour hope kicked in, is when I adopted this policy.
---
It's impossible to camp two Gates and a hook at the same time if you're team pressures all three things at the same time
---
So the killer downed him and had no other choice but to pick him up. DS came into play and Steve got away for free. Seems like ‚Äúinvincible‚Äù is a pretty accurate description.
---
He really was. It‚Äôs abundantly clear, and it seems everyone here sees it but you.

With minor bugs often you don't know about them and they have been present for just as long as the major ones there trying to fix. It takes just as long to fix major bugs as it does tiny ones however, you just know how long they existed.
---
She needed to endlessly loop you to survive.
---
That's just demogorgon's rework in which he takes you to the upside down
---
Sadly this is not the proper way to handle the current gen speeds.
---
Simply because the game itself is already quite fast paced, when the game would accelerate even more, the balancing would become harder and harder while players have less chances to make actual comebacks, resulting in a unforgiving and very absolute "black and white" game.
---
In my personal opinion, the game has to get slower, not faster. The bare fact that Ruin is almost essential for every Killer, already screams "Killers need more time". But as long as the gap between certain Killer potentials is that huge, this won't be balance-able. Either high tier Killers are too broken or low tier Killers are unplayable.
---
Sorry, didn't mean to write so much lol.
---
if only mikey wasnt so thicc? as the internet ppl say
---
Thompson needs small adjustments like places to drop down from. It's basically like a reverse basement. Furthermore, killers shouldn't be able to body block like that. If a survivor body blocks they get smacked. If a killer does, theres no counterplay.

Honestly now the ranks don‚Äôt matter. They rank you with other ranks all the time

That‚Äôs also what I don‚Äôt get. I‚Äôve had killer‚Äôs farm with me and my friends will start bitching and complaining and when they‚Äôre farming with the killer in the same scenario they act like they‚Äôre winning over us or something. I think people just like to exaggerate things in their head.
---
But if the killers can kill faster than ruin becomes less necessary.
---
Mettle of Mom
---
But those indie devs your talking about probably spent *years* ensuring the game was mostly bug free while the devs don't have nearly as much time with each update. I understand your frustrations but you have cut them some slack.
---
by chance is that the contest winner from that contest a few months back?
---
Is dbd a casual game when its only mode is ranked? Also yea those are symmetrical games but that only strengthens the point this is a 1v4 not a 1v1 it sounds like you want to be able to win 1v1 because your teammates are not doing anything. It should be an even chance if both sides play well. Why should the killer play well and only you play well but 3/4 of the team play poorly and still have winning chances? How does that make sense?
---
I don‚Äôt think being friendly, per say, but I personally like to think that for most of the tragic origin killers (Wraith, Hag, Plague, Spirit, non-Frank Legion, maybe Trapper with the new lore?) it‚Äôs a moment of lucidity where they realize what they‚Äôre doing and let the survivor go.
---
Too thiccüòî
---
&gt; Both of which are opinions
---
Are you saying that another play has the right to dictate how you play the game? Or are you saying that your opponent trying to win is toxic?
---
Which of those do you feel is an opinion that you disagree with?
---
Oni doesn't need a buff.
---
Becuase survivors juke more and loop more
---
Yup if you break my hooks or have a flashlight you're on my hit list
---
Yes, but actually no.
---
i like the shoes. i hope its payable for with shards not just AC. though the santa body will always be the top clown body imo. that sack is awesome. and the lights
---
&gt;So the killer downed him and had no other choice but to pick him up
---
The killer couldn't have focused on downing the other survivor that was healing themselves first?  At that point even with the DS he could have picked up the other guy.  The killer did have other choices, he chose wrong.
---
&gt;DS came into play and Steve got away for free.
---
So what's the problem here?  Again, is the survivor not supposed to try and survive?
---
&gt;Seems like ‚Äúinvincible‚Äù is a pretty accurate description.
---
Had this happened anywhere other than right in front of the door, the chase would have resumed and Billy could have just downed him again.

No doubt. She's pretty weak in chases even when traps are at the loop unless you get a good server tick on the teleport, and 10 traps doesn't even cover half of most maps at base range. That's a recipe for camping.

---
That seems pretty good but the number of seconds per breath and the radius where you can hear it would probably need to be tweaked just slightly based on player testing 
---
Also this gives rise to a few addon possibilites (solving another one of the problems I brought up in my original comment)
---
* slightly/moderately/significantly decreases the radius where survivors can hear breathing from lockers
---
* breath sounds from lockers take slightly/moderately longer to play
---
And also status effects based around legions in lockers (cool band name lol) damaging 
---
This would be an amazing addition to the game! I hope the devs see your comment! :)
---
That doesn‚Äôt make it an infinite though, that‚Äôs just a good setup. Killer can still mind game.
---
Or maybe Hulk is just a buff ogre?
---
Is there a link to where these are listed?
---
This is the cutest thing I've seen all day. That heartwarming giggle!
---
I DC if i see they are bringing me to the basement at this point. I feel sorry for the other survivors, but it is the only thing I can think of to discourage this kind of behavior.
---
The stats are massively inflated by memers and derankers. "They have a 50% kill rate" isn't saying much when 50% kill rate is the norm. All Killers have weapons and can still kill if the Survivors are morons.
---
But the point still stands that Demo is an outlier as one of the least played Killers (above only the likes of Clown, Leatherface, Plague, and below the likes of Hag - even at high ranks he's in the bottom 5 least played killers) with one of the lowest win rates (lowest flat out at all ranks except Red, where he barely surpasses Clown.)
---
People need to stop denying cold hard facts and except the fact that even though Demo feels good to play he's dog shit tier. Freddy isn't a "popular" Killer but the stats show that he has the highest kill rate out of any Killer, and nearly an 80% kill rate at red ranks. So should we ignore those stats because "not a lot of people play Freddy?" No, the same way we shouldn't ignore Demo's piss poor play and kill rate because "he feels good to play as and against."
---
OH SHIT THAT‚ÄôS HAPPENING TO YOU TO? I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST A NEW BUILD THAT PREVENTED IT COMPLETELY, AND NOT A BUG. WTF IS BEHAVIOR DOING? HOW TF DOES ADDING ONI AND YUI AND REWORKING LEGION MAKE THE BASEMENT AND WIGGLE NOT WORK? LIKE HOW?

The patch is barely 24 hours out... They need to find out whats causing the bug, fix it and then ship out a patch to all platforms.

The Freddy cheese being nullified is the best part about this change. Shitters who want to abuse that are out of luck now, they‚Äôll have to‚Äî God forbid‚Äî actually use his abilities and chase if they really want to tunnel unhooks.
---
Doing gens is incredibly boring, especially when you‚Äôve played the game 2k+ hours. The only real fun is being chased by the killer and looping, at least for me. It would be interesting if survivors could set traps or something to that effect as a side objective, or maybe having a reason to sabo hooks. They changed hook spacing but they‚Äôre still too close to do a fun sabo game most of the time.

It's obviously not a status effect. If you are near an open gate and healthy you're still invulnerable. I'm really struggling to figure out how you don't get this concept.

If you don't play around DS you're going to get fucked, "play normally" doesn't work if you're trying to pip or get kills. If someone told you to play normally against a NOED you'd tell them to get out of town.
---
We were literally talking about how strong it is during the EGC. All but 2 perks increase your chances of escaping and we weren't talking about how having good perks is a bad thing. But DS is just all around great and even more so during the endgame. That is what we were talking about
---
I guess I should've been more specific to why you'd bring up NOED when trying to say DS isn't that strong during the EGC, feel free to explain that.
---
But I never said NOED wasn't BS, I never even brought it up.  And the reason DS is talked about more is that you can go against 4 a match and it used in almost every game. NOED is not seen above the lower ranks.
---
No, please, no more custom music. Every time they mess with anything audio related, the whole audio system gets fucked with bugs. I'm not saying fire the sound guy, the man has a family, but just put him in a closet somewhere and don't have him touch anything else audio related. Please, no more, just leave it alone.
---
Remember when the rework was announced and people were saying his snares just made him a worse clown with more map pressure?

If a survivor gets hooked in the basement currently, their camera starts falling through the world infinitely, effectively making them blind until they get picked up by the killer again.

The no window vault animation was just dumb, that alone made a lot of tiles like the shack almost unplayable.

Collision should never have been a thing, basically the only use of collision was when the Spirit accidentally ran into a survivor which gave her an unearned free hit.

Prayer Beads needed nerf because they're Prayer Beads.

The only nerf that doesn't make any sense is the post -phase speed change, but that's not really noticeable.

&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works:

&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible.

&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;# New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule.

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
Is that tattoo from Harry Potter?
---
Awe my little niece is obsessed too! The messages I get after letting her play are straight up disgusting though (I don‚Äôt let her see but I have my messages open bc I don‚Äôt mind the salt), sucks that the shittiest part of the community is the loudest.
---
This. You have to get out of the basement. It's like a challenge that only David Blaine would enjoy.
---
Now if only one of the killers could get a dunkmaster skin
---
He‚Äôs not telling anybody how to play, he‚Äôs just pointing out that the way they‚Äôre playing is scummy because of how The Oni benefits greatly from tunnelling. I don‚Äôt know where you got that idea from.
---
They are 100% toxic because they‚Äôre ruining the fun of other players. Just because he can‚Äôt tell them how they should play the game doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre any less of assholes for doing so.
---
This close to rank reset it is unlikely that you will find 4 survivors with ranks that low queuing at the same time as you.
---
We playing the same game? Because every Oni I've seen has gotten a 3k and never less.
---
I played against Mariah Scarey last night. She kept popping up behind the coal tower thinking she was stealthy as hell. Lol. Two teammates were hooked, I saved one and she immediately ran for the gate- but went down and got death hooked. Shame, but if she wasn't gonna save our teammate I wasn't gonna look back. I saved the other girl and Mariah reached Tier 3. My teammate went into a locker to heal and then I went down. She saves me and we head for the gate.  I go down and she she runs out. But in true Halloween fashion I went out the hatch after almost missing my DS. 
---
But yeah the Shape is fun every match.
---
Tbh no i have played a few times and failed. But had a blast laughing and trying to run away. No stealth skills yet. But right now i am just on the munchie patrol and researcher. Lol. But i am trying and learning. And covering my eyes and yelling run alot.
---
Shit luck, my guy
---
Sorry for how bad it is
---
Beautiful
---
Ahhh, old sabo, good times
---
Honestly I'd be down for them to bring back old sabo but to compensate make iron grasp how it was before as well. And killers would actually have an advantage now since you got mad grit
---
There is a 2 v 8 mode on the Chinese phone clone "Identity V" which seems pretty fun.
---
I spent 2 hours playing dbd to try and get an Oni. My last game, I finally got one!
---
...and he was really fucking scary so I had to stop playing for the night. It‚Äôs like the Demo all over again but worse! His chase music and loud stomping when he‚Äôs enraged freak me the fuck out.
---
I don't understand why the hair needed to be added but ok
---
Inb4 ‚ÄúOni op‚Äù commente
---
lol I ran so many killers on the ironworks building back in the day
---
My favorite infinite was probably the cowshed
---
What a mess this patch is... spies is bugged, oni's add-ons are bugged, and then [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1928482455) [happened](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1928481609).
---
Sorry for bad quality. Just missed out on the achievement because apparently, I only found 2 people the whole match. 
---
So tired of this nonsense. Chaser has been broken since the day of the rework. Still not fixed, still gives a maximum of 4 points, and you still can't get the adept achievement, despite getting a 4k with 3 gens left and no camping, because BHVR doesn't play their own game and cba to fix the ridiculous ranking system. 
---
This is why people derank.
---
iFunny, really?
---
**cries in bubba**
---
God don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs crap but on another note technically it‚Äôs another team/department that deals with those things
---
I hate it especially when I die because of trying to do the last gen whilst the other guy is hiding! Like cmon killers! Give it to the useful survivors!
---
I was playing on the new map against a legion and with deep wound I couldn't see jack shit.
---
I don't know who it is but I think she sounds good!
---
Lol I just got the pic from google images, didn‚Äôt notice that
---
On console? What rank?
---
But I have borrowed time!!
---
It's like that part where Patrick kicks his own butt
---
Yeah you're right, its so easy to play against a Myers with infinite stalk that can crouch and be stealthy without addons...
---
The entire tooltip doesn't even make sense, it doesn't even say that the shock attack stops interactions now either, which would also be a huge nerf.
---
&gt; I love this game, and everyone in the community loves this game, but they added two characters and a map with this patch. Why did it come with SO MANY unrelated bugs? Why did adding two characters and a map bug the basement hooks? Why did adding two characters and a map bug medkit add-ons? Its Just an overall dissapointing situation man..
---
If you actually read the patch notes, you will notice there are a lot more changes than simply adding 3 things.
---
I have had so many people this when I'm playing Billy. I just drop the survivor and then the sabo guy has to play "don't get hit by chainsaw before your teammate is picked up off the ground."
---
I'm rank 7. The killers seem to be around that or higher... lower.. hell they tend to be 7-5 the ones I've seen.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6545s/is_the_og_ghostface_cosmetic_still_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
holy shit aren't you entitled.
---
Lol its even more fun with oni now
---
It's a powerful ability that comes with a risk to it, as it should.
---
Yeah usually I just avoid running in the grass and around killer shack sometimes I‚Äôve gotten out on my 1st try and not at all other times it‚Äôs just random I think along with whatever addons are being used
---
I'm sorry... but what in the living hell are you saying? Have you even played killer on ironworks?  Where do I even start. I guess you can technically "mind game" it but good luck with doing that... I doubt you'll even gain a bloodlust tier.
---
For comparison of an infinite and a "a good setup", take ironworks factory loop and killer shack.
---
Killer shack is a good example of a good setup because it is very well possible to mind game as a killer due to the alternative routes you can take. The acception being the god pallet. Some killers can perform much more optimal there than others but they will either get a hit or cause the pallet to be thrown down making the loop less valuable.
---
Now onto ironworks. No alternative route, it's either you go through the vault point and the survivor gains distance, or you go all the way around which ends the chase and resets the limit for however many times the survivor can vault that location and by the time you get to the other side of the wall it would be a huge waste of time, additionally there is a pallet there (which can potentially be mind gamed). Few killers can perform optimal in that loop (ie, Freddy snares, Nurse or trapper's... traps... possibly legion) and all other M1 killers can do is either run Bamboozle or bloodlust and wait for the vault point to block up.
---
This isn't just a "good setup", this is a, pardon my vocab, a steaming pile of shit for any killer who isn't high tier or well performing.
---
That's a actually pretty good. Give them optional objectives to get lots of blood points.
---
We'd need some special maps for a "survivor free for all" though
---
Hm. Must just be you, I‚Äôm also rank 7 and I have yet to see him get more than 1 kill
---
I'm not saying he's not a good killer, just that he isn't broken.
---
The thing is, it mentions to complety different shock attacks, and nether acaullty mention that it stops interactions like it does now, so im not acuallty sure this is a finished tooltip, much like when Ghostface's tooltip was leaked.
---
At least there's an *actual* reason to play Doctor. There's literally zero reason to play Clown when Freddy exists.
---
what bug?
---
Cosmetic
---
the reason it was removed is because its been posted so much on new
---
A bug called Dead by Daylight
---
This is an old screenshot
---
I mean technically it‚Äôs kind of a dick move but it‚Äôs not abusing anything since that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs intended plus you gotta admit the mori is dope
---
aight that made me laugh lmao but fr what did they fuck up again
---
üòäThank you
---
I‚Äôll take a big buff demon over a cybernetic ninja.
---
Also why the put 5 legendaries into your deck profile picture? I always found that card to be more of a meme.
---
Dumb people did, people just like jumping to conclusions all the time. His snares were obviously better than pallets from the start. It's so much better that if you literally took away Freddy's 5 other powers and all he had was literally JUST snares he would still be a better clown. They offer so much better anti-loop than clown's fart bottles to the point that you can even handle infinites as Freddy
---
Wait, this game is in Dutch. üòÇ
---
lol what are you talking about? It's an accurate way to see the level of gameplay your about to experience.  LOL
---
Honestly read the comments. There's a lot of bugs named I wasn't even aware of.
---
This tooltip looks extrelmly unifshed anyway. If he can do the shock attack while in his attack mode that would be extremly strong.
---
Mei is a saint and I had the biggest smile on my face when I saw this.
---
Someone asked for this but I can‚Äôt remember who it was
---
Seems pretty A or B tier on PC, F tier on console.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e655wi/couldnt_help_but_see_a_pallet_drop_maybe_i/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
&gt;And then ran around for another 30-60 seconds if you're even somewhat decent as a survivor.
---
Ok so you waste another 30 seconds down him and hook him.  He's either dead or can't use the perk for the rest of the match.  So what's the problem here?
---
&gt;Better run self-care so you can spend 20 minutes healing yourself instead of being usefull.
---
More like 10 seconds if you can hit skill checks and have a medkit.
---
Better tunnel that guy who D-striked you for 30-60 seconds instead of doing something useful.
---
When Bunny Feng arrives. Really though, it would be the perfect skin to add with that one, though if Bunny Feng ever comes it will most likely be Easter...
---
DS is trash, its a one time use perk that only works 1/10 games and if the killer is high rank they will just leave you as slug bait unless its 5 gens left or so. Once DS is gone you will only have 3 perks left to play around with
---
They make  him too realint on addons. Make madness do that shit base line so he doesnt need add ons to work.
---
No it‚Äôs fucking not. Lmao.
---
I just need a few more killer adepts for the platinum and every time I think I'm about to get it, someone either dcs and costs me my trophy or I don't get enough chaser points (especially playing killers with no map pressure because if you dont end chases fast then everyone else can just rush gens and that will cost you the gatekeeper emblem). They really need to adjust how to get adept killer trophies because it makes no sense that survivors get theirs so easily.
---
Yeah this will get you the free karma you need because your unoriginal
---
heh goals
---
So a perk that tells you if a survivor is looking at you? Which btw would include the hooked guy because that is how whispers works as well.
---
I have reached rank 1 with the trapper, wraith, clown ....
---
What complaint?
---
Yes it has been fixed
---
That was my first suggestion on the official dbd forum after a month of playing the game... I said this about a year ago now and guess what still hasn‚Äôt happened even though I know so many people who also think it‚Äôs a great idea
---
Hahahah
---
Well that was kind of the joke, Prince Malchezaar was always really just a fun card. Never really competitively viable. Plus I always thought the art looked cool.
---
I guess it's better to have your main forgotten than to just have them get nerfed into oblivion
---
*cries in legion main*
---
I‚Äôd rather BHVR stop releasing new content and just focus on the health of the game for a while. We don‚Äôt need a new cosmetic every Wednesday or a bunch of new shiny things, just give me a game where I‚Äôm not having to wait 40 minutes searching for a lobby. Just focus on making the game playable. I love this game and don‚Äôt want to stop playing, but I completely understand why you uninstalled
---
That's the best joke I've heard all day
---
So one of the best feature updates was an error? What are you doing BHVR?
---
You might wanna change the tag to a rant my dude, Moris are shit but it‚Äôs like the second day the oni is out they‚Äôll chill out next week
---
&gt; Tell me what the counters are to all the OHKOs killer have. Oni's club, Billy's and Bubba's chainsaws, EW3 Mikey, Iridescent shard Huntress, Plague Power Puke, Ghostface's exposure, NOED, Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Iron Maiden, Rancor, etc.
---
*sigh* Let's go and explain painfully obvious things again woot woot:
---
Oni: Prevent him from getting easy first hit to make sure you get 1-2 gens done before he gets rolling. He is useless without it. Make sure to heal ASAP to make it so that he doesn't have access to his power a lot. Also lockers and vaults are ur best friend.
---
Billy: Dodge his chainsaw, sure eventually he'll hit it but being chased as survivor is not about never going down. It's about buying time for your mates to finish the gens. So dodge it and buy time.
---
Bubba: Same thing as Billy however this is way easier to dodge and he gets stunned if you dodge it. Also he has no map pressure at all so Macro is more important here than Micro anyway.
---
EW3 Mike: Don't give him free stalk. You should already have 1-2 gens done before he gets EW3. Then just wait out his EW3. (With wait I mean play safely e.g. don't go for cheeky hook rescues or some shit. You can still do gens.)
---
Irridescent shard huntress doesn't exist, it is irredescent head. This is OP but also requires bot a red and a purple addon (army belt) and this is fairly rare. To put this in perspective most red addons are BS. If she doesn't run army you will notice pretty quickly, just make sure you dodge one hatchet and she has to reload (meaning you can get away) or she has to chase you normally (which takes forever as she is 110).
---
Plague: If you cleanse vs plague your an idiot, seriously she is mid tier if you ignore the shrines but if you cleanse you handicap you and your team very hard. If she runs apples she gets 2 free corrupt purges but you can just wait those out/accept 1-2 free down for her. Also you can try to dodge it if you know what ur doing.
---
Ghostface: reveal him, don't give him free stalk. Abuse the fact he has no map pressure and relies on his power to be strong. If you knock him out of his power he becomes very weak.
---
NOED: Do bones /s. But in all seriousness unless the killer runs a full endgame build this perk isn't a big deal. Either accept one extra survivor dieng or find the hex. And if he is full endgame you should have been able to steamroll and still be with four survs.
---
DH: Cleanse the totem....
---
Haunted: Don't cleanse totems vs spirit unless you know there is a hex (ruin/huntress' etc.). Otherwise just accept it, that's one perk slot for 1 instadown. Or wait it out, it's only 60 seconds.
---
Iron maiden: this perk is the worst killer perk in the game lmao. It's  duration is so short you have to be a complete baffoon to be downed during that time. Only killer that can run it is Huntress just for the quick reload speed (NOT for the "insta down").
---
Rancor: You know the killer has it as obsession, so play safe when the gens are done. It also gives you (the obsession) free knowledge of the killers location during the game which u can abuse.
---
Also basically none of these can be "used whenever you want", the only exception being Ghostface's power but that is literally his only power.
---
A tier during PTB and A tier after. he is an amazing killer and im sure people will figure out how to use him optimally and fuck shit up
---
I mean you can never go wrong using ruin
---
WHY CAN'T BILLY AND BUBBA JUST *CUT IT DOWN*
---
Almost makes a grown man cry.....
---
On PC he seems like a good B to A tier killer honestly on console with the current optimization more like C or D there's nothing be offers that Billy can't do with Billy at least you don't have frame rate issues.
---
If it's not a balance assessment, and it's not a complain, than what is it?  Because it's not a fact.
---
yes! he will accept any and all pets
---
That's actually a reasonable mistake. Coincidentally, I main both haha.
---
People spam moris after a killer gets released, its cool for a bit but yes it gets very annoying, it will steady out in the next few days.
---
I still dont know why moris have not been nerfed though.
---
Btw you can kick gens through thrilling tremors you don't need to wait
---
I don‚Äôt usually main one killer I just play whoever I feel like using at the time
---
After the update does sloppy butcher work with frenzy hits?
---
Look, i know, they changed how protection hits work a little bit, changed legion and spirit a little, nerfed balanced landing, changed the rank reset a bit, put undetectable effect on some killer perks, changed kindred and that Billy perk i don't remember the name, etc, but like it or not, this update came with gamebreaking bugs that should not have happened and two weeks is too long to fix it, it is unacceptable.
---
*different universe
---
It‚Äôs in many languages.
---
Yeah. I'm just so annoyed. I played really well, and I should have gotten it - but nope. 4k with only 2 gens done isn't good enough.
---
Does anyone not notice the nodding Dwight in the background or is just me‚Äî? Lol
---
There needs to be at least one gen jockey every game. That person doesn‚Äôt tend to get enough points just like the person who happens to get found by killer first and manages to loop them for the majority of the game, only to get caught and hooked later. Both feel thankless.
---
I like the concept, but it's super exploitable by killers who can hide their terror radius and insidious campers.
---
I had a game where michael killed everyone except a david but each time michael would carry him to the door, david kept running away and hiding in lockers. Michael found the hatch, closed it and kept nudging at the david to open the door. Eventually the timer ran out and david died LMAO. I was spectating the whole thing and I have never facepalmed harder in my life. 
---
"I should have left nancy live lol"
---
I was nancy and *yeah* you should have üòîüòîüòî 
---
Feelsbad
---
Hey at least you can shock people and laugh maniacally while you get gen rushed that‚Äôs a win
---
That‚Äôs gotta hurt, but it is a glitch. Unless it‚Äôs been happening often, BHVR made a small mistake
---
Google how to report it and do so. Then move on and report again if it happens again. Light a fire under them
---
I'm not sure, the Legion patch said perks with "regular attacks" no longer effect feral frenzy but sloppy butcher just says "successful attacks" So its kind of a grey area. I hope it still works.
---
There is a bug (like forever) where you cant escape the trap if they knew how to fix it they would have i guess
---
This here
---
Oh darling... :(
---
Neon clothes claudette? Impossible...
---
Harry Warden, please.
---
*additional edit: and an underground mine map.
---
But it needs to be heavily talked about, bhvr can't Just release bug filled updates everytime it launches an update
---
Just shit RNG dude, it happens. Sometimes RNGesus is on your side, sometimes he's not.
---
Clown has a cool knife, his bottles are more satisfying when you make them work than Freddy's period pools and he is T H I C C.
---
r/dbdgonehot ü•µ
---
It would just reverse the meta back to a disgusting, sloppy, boring mess that it used to me
---
Left 4 Dead has never once been on a sony console, yet we have bill and respective cosmetics on ps4. There's no reason for this to be any different.
---
I thought arm wiggles meant "coast is clear, hurry and get me!" 
---
Oops.
---
Insert "oni op" comment
---
&gt;the issue is that there is no short straw there. If you're just giving it to someone because they're the last one left, there is a high chance it's because that person didn't help as much as they should have, are the reason everyone else is dead, and potentially because that person literally ignored the others or played solely for themselves, and now they're being rewarded for it.
---
Well fuck, I think you persuaded me to stop giving people hatch.
---
It *is* heavily talked about. Anyone who browses new knows
---
yeah I'm sure they know about this
---
Can I have ur dog
---
Mending, healing, repeat all game is super annoying and boring for survivors, but not DC worthy.
---
Yeah, when I said "actual" reason, I meant, like, _gameplay-wise._
---
I prefer playing Clown over Freddy too, he's a lot funnier than Freddy and feels a lot more satisfying to use. But *objectively...* there's no reason to play him over Freddy. And that makes me sad.
---
Yeah ruin isn‚Äôt always the best - some killers don‚Äôt even need it. Once you get up to purple sometimes something else is better
---
I share my account with a friend, and I'm pretty upset with the game, so I play it rarely, didn't even get my full set hag skin.
---
But since I share my PS4 account, my friend asked me to buy the DLC, so he'll pay me.
---
The question is: Is Oni ok to play on PS4? Or It's bad on PS4 like ppls r saying?
---
Laurie mains after hitting the Decisive Skillcheck
---
*I am speed*
---
When this happens to me as killer I just facecamp the unhooker and let the other escape, unless they're toxic too, in which case there is no mercy.
---
Can you bring back visible ranks in survivor lobbies. Fuck it was useful and you only put it in by error? What are you doing BHVR? Your match making sucks. My friends have stopped playing this grind fest. I'm getting done too.
---
and they all ran noed?
---
I bought nearly all of Yui‚Äôs cosmetics and I do not regret it
---
I am glad then, we need to keep up the good fight, blendette
---
As a killer it usually doesn‚Äôt take long to find a game on Xbox, but it takes a while longer for survivor
---
Try to play more stealthy against him
---
I think escaping a trap should just take Fixated amount of time. Like 15-20 seconds to free yourself or 5 seconds for your teammate.
---
&gt; Ok so you waste another 30 seconds down him and hook him. He's either dead or can't use the perk for the rest of the match. So what's the problem here?
---
Well that is another gen and a half done (without boxes).
---
&gt; More like 10 seconds if you can hit skill checks and have a medkit.
---
One, who misses healing skillchecks lmao. Two, why bring SC when you already have a medkit. Just heal eachother and save 16 seconds, room for an insta or a toolbox and a perk slot.
---
Maths is really simple.
---
This is bannable? I've totally ratted out a survivor that was hiding in a locker because they did nothing but crouch around going into different lockers and t-bagging around the rest of us as we worked on gens.
---
Really? Where?
---
Like nurse, he‚Äôs ass to play on console with the 10 FPS these awful devs have cursed us with but on PC he‚Äôll be a beast
---
There is some AI. The tutorial has them move and do stuff. Not much but there is some and we have also seen some in dev streams. I think there is enough to make it run to a spot.
---
[The OP is also the same person who draw this to you!](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d4u2xk/for_otzdarva_the_most_amazing_killer/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
What contest was this? Is this clown skin getting added to the game confirmed by BHVR?
---
Also can't interact with anything except walk/run/tbag (and they do auto-wiggle, it's such a weird bug).
---
2v8 would be too survivor sided. 6 people being able to sit on gens would blow through them real quick with current gen speeds. Not to mention that'd be 32 survivors perks versus 8 killers perks... It's a fun idea but just not balanced in the slightest.
---
I still think the easiest way to have chucky is have the killer be Tiffany as a human carrying around chucky, she could be named The Bride and the power could be Heart of Demballa, where Tiffany will perform all the normal M1 killer stuff but they can perform the ritual on downed survivors to give chucky power to do various things to the point where you can temporarily control him while having some strong buffs, ranging from stealth, insta downs, running quickly, sabotaging pallets or gens etc. Whatever direction they want to take it. With the downside being that he can't actually carry and hook the survivors.
---
He can also be the first obsession based killer, i.e. the obsession is tied with his power directly instead of perks, to play in the idea of how only certain people, like Andy, have a weird connection to him.
---
I am kinda picturing him as a mix of Myers' power buildup and Legion's mobility. With his own personal twist on what he can do with his power active.
---
As a plus I think the Mori could be Tiffany pinning the survivor down, placing the seemingly lifeless good guy doll on the survivor, then he suddenly turns around, scares the survivor and rapidly stabs them. Akin to Bride of chucky when she first brought Chucky back to life and killed her boyfriend.
---
I think if they really don't want to create entire new mechanics for him, they can make chucky work
---
To be honest I didn‚Äôt know about the bug until he told me and it was happening to him and he told me that someone else fixed their game by falling off the stairs, so we tried it and it worked!! I have no clue who managed to figure that out though lol. Hopefully they‚Äôll fix it soon.
---
Literally me and my spirit friend to scale irl
---
I was correcting your impression that DS is not one of the strongest survivor perks, because it definitely is.
---
why were you running up there anywhere if its a guaranteed death trap
---
Excuse me can you don‚Äôt
---
you cant nerf survivors like that. That is such a heavy nerf that, sure might be a decent, if not uninformed idea for killers like legion or bubba. 
---
But the issue is, adding such a MASSIVE nerf to survivors like this would make any A tier killers (or hell arguably even B tier) broken beyond believe.
---
Survivors need another objective, one more important then totems but less time consuming and boring then gens.
---
Head on has been nice with quick and quiet. Unbreakable feels like a must. A healing perk to pick up slugs or heal so he doesn't get orbs is also nice. I would use botany since it works on myself if I bring/find a medkit.
---
Hey at least you can shock and laugh maniacally while getting gen rushed that‚Äôs a win
---
Is it the lack of turning ability on console that makes him so much worse?
---
bademester?
---
Got any more of them fps?
---
So if we‚Äôre facing each other, his right or my right?
---
Is a ranking system that only shows the tenacity of players, merely a representation of HOW MUCH you play rather than how good you play, really a ranking system?
---
The "ranking" system actually only displays your knowledge of the game rather than your skill level. I can say this with confidence since i managed to Rank up from Rank 14 to Rank 6 without ever touching a gen. I did it just by running the killer around and doing totems/chests.
---
I am not saying, that I should survivor 100% of the time. But a number closer to 50% would be great. and I mean that overall.
---
My numbers that I have collected are for survivor an average survivalrate of 17.5%. And as killer the number goes even lower. Given, thats red ranks not all ranks like the stats of the devs showed.
---
A killer shouldn't be able to safe 3k every single game and have the last survivor occasionally escape because he didnt find the hatch in time.
---
And your part about why would that strengthen your point, that its a 4v1? My argument just says that what you said about 1v1/symmetrical games cannot be applied to asymmetrical games. Because those are different types of games and there is no real numbers that reflect on how the top 1% actually does in this game.
---
This is literally the only use for bodyblocking as a killer. Why was she in a place she knows there's only one exit?!
---
I enjoy not having basement camping be core gameplay.
---
Yo wtf
---
If you don't like lore, that's fine, but other people do. Dont watch them of you don't want to, that should be pretty obvious. 
---
Side note: cinematic teams are not the same people as gameplay teams, balance teams, etc.
---
Fuck, i ment basement
---
I bet when you shout at them it's ^^^really ^^^quite ^^^^quiet
---
And watch survivors start kicking people to sandbag them :)
---
The X does give slightly better frame rates but on farm maps and swamp ones it still tends to drop from time to time. It drops even worse on these maps if you're doctor or clown who's power effects lags the game up a bit.
---
Plus avoid any ds as well. Just a good play
---
The variance is pretty goofy, yeah. Getting out in the first 3 tries vs taking 10+ is just way too much of a difference.
---
I was thinking of quick and quiet I‚Äôll have to try it out! I still need to level up my Jane. I like the idea of botany and a med kit bc self care is so slow. Thank you!
---
How's literally standing 2 feet in front of him, practically choosing between a insta down or a free hit isnt broken?
---
Tru lol
---
That's the one.
---
Spirit friend: \*Looks up\* What?  
---
Me: I said, get the door, I am not kneeling to reach it
---
Bubba just needs small tweaks imo
---
Apples and oranges. Survivors need some sort of non-stealth mechanic to survive vs killers otherwise the role is a glorified hiding and QTE simulator.
---
The hook timer is like 3 minutes. Even if it is reduced to 2 minutes there is still plenty of time to do all the gens.
---
Thank you Kindly :)
---
Head on is also just fun in general and feels so good when you use it. I highly suggest it! Inner strength is also a really nice substitute for self care.
---
Of course don‚Äôt watch if u don‚Äôt want toü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This is my thought exactly. Just like they bought the game and can do what they want, you bought it as well and can play however you want. I didn't spend $30+ for other people to have fun. It's a personal problem on their side if they can't just let it go and move onto their next match
---
forever freddy.
---
bro can u become a spirit main?  thanks in advance
---
I got feng to p3 and now I‚Äôm switching to Yui,
---
Sad but I love me some waifus.
---
Sorry bro but rank 8 is not a high rank
---
Oh thank god. Thanks dude.
---
&gt; Oh, what's this? Host Disconnected? Join Game Failure? Error?
---
If you get anything other than Host Disconnected, close the game, restore the licences (especially after an update) and restart the game. I have found this fixes the frequency of random Nat32 and Game Failure notices.
---
I‚Äôm just surprised because barely any game is translated to Dutch.
---
Hiding/theres always a chest. If the Gates were close she may have been looking for a key.
---
I really like the concept, but I think a better option to being hit would be:
---
*When a survivor passes within (X Meters) of a locker containing an inactive member of Legion, Legion will jump out and **Restrain** the survivor.*
---
*While Restrained, the survivor can attempt to **Struggle** free.  Legion cannot swap members while Restraining a Survivor.*
---
*The active member of Legion can pick up a **Restrained** survivor.*
---
It‚Äôs sort of like a combination of Freddy‚Äôs teleport with Trapper‚Äôs traps.  The inactive Legion members could still be blinded by Flashlights if another survivor is nearby to help, and the struggle timer would be a shorter version of the Wiggle timer while carrying survivors.
---
Add-ons could then buff the length of the struggle timer, apply bonus status effects (Blind, Exposed, Exhausted), injure survivors who manage to break free, or expand the range from lockers survivors can be grabbed from.
---
If the base version of the ability doesn‚Äôt cause injuries, you allow them to buff the ranges/make the add-ons more varied to allow different styles of play.
---
Well, This is pretty fuckin brilliant. Chucky in any capacity would be amazing.
---
Can we get some tests on this?
---
Yeah!
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e65hx2/anyone_else_getting_this_game_breaking_bug_when/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Ranks have never mattered in this game
---
Oof
---
All I want at this point is another Samination clip where legion gets expelled again from the hookers and the wraith puts a "No" scribble in their faces again. 
---
"Your rework as been reworked and you are as effective as a Dwight in a locker"
---
Havent played in a long time, but depending on hook spawn that used to be a spot where if you got downed the killer couldn't get you to a hook.  Given that theres no gen up there, thats the only reason to be in that spot.
---
Pig is a tough killer to main considering her stalk gives her *grass-vision*.
---
Keep up with it though! Pig is fun to play against like Myers, lots of jump scares.
---
Any time I‚Äôve played against a myers with this skin, i get slaughtered because i can‚Äôt focus on anything but those legs. Rip
---
question, have you checked ur bill recently?
---
Sorry to say but not basement. I kicked a gen on blackwater and got stuck between the gen and the log.
---
Does this change the colors of some perks? (For example, Spine Chill, which is purple in base game, but many packs change it to purple/red because many perks should be pink but are capped at very rare/purple)
---
Omg i took a screenshot yesterday but forgot to share.
---
bruh, i feel this. the moment you turn around to hit someone else with frenzy now, the survivors just stops and heals. i hit all 4 during my frenzy one game and by the time i got to the last dude the other 3 were no longer deep wounded. its like why am i even right clicking anymore
---
And behind him is the big boss who's slowly approaching the poor lad to give him his 5th disciplinary for dropping pallets randomly this month. Lol
---
Nothing personal kid
---
Why dont you like the new map?
---
I got stuck on the gen in the house on crotus penn asylum. I only got out because I had some hag traps set around and one of the survivors triggered them
---
Well it would be a complicated fix because you cant have survivor collision without killer collision.  The true solution is to remove braindead map design that has these locations with only one narrow way out.
---
Probably B or A tier on PC and same for console atleast for me  cause I've haven't had any problems with him
---
This bug happened to me yesterday, I had to quit the game.
---
&gt;Make sure to heal ASAP to make it so that he doesn't have access to his power a lot. Also lockers and vaults are ur best friend.
---
But everyone tells me self care is useless and hinders the team now!  Lockers only work if you're running Q&amp;Q and doesn't see you.  Let me know when dedicated server get fixed and I'll tell you when vaulting becomes useful.  I dropped lithe because it became useless, you're practically guaranteed to take a hit through a vault.
---
&gt;Billy: Dodge his chainsaw
---
Sure until he just butt humps you while revving it to guarantee the down.
---
&gt;Don't give him free stalk.
---
Because you just always know when he's stalking you, especially when a gen is out in the open.  Keeping your head on a swivel only counts for so much.
---
&gt;IH Huntress is rare
---
I've gotten 3 in one night, in purple ranks almost every huntress I get is running it.
---
&gt;Plague
---
If you cleanse she can one tap you, if you're already puking she can...one tap you.  All she has to do is puke on everything, wait for everyone to be sick, then one tap down everyone.  If you cleanse to heal she can...one tap you.
---
&gt;Ghostface
---
Hear gen, go stealth mode, crouch, pull survivor off gen, repeat.
---
&gt;NOED
---
I run into NOED in 90% of the games I play.
---
&gt;DH
---
And what if that totem happens to be Thrill or Haunted grounds?
---
&gt;Haunted
---
Ruin is meta, I'm shocked when I run into a killer who doesn't have it.  First thing I do if I see ruin is go totem hunting.  Oh, wait it out, only 60 seconds?  Hmmm sounds familiar, almost like DS.
---
&gt;Iron maiden
---
Inner strength is becoming more meta than any other healing perk, coupled with small game, and head on locker play is becoming top tier.
---
&gt;Also basically none of these can be "used whenever you want", the only exception being Ghostface's power but that is literally his only power.
---
Well neither can DS, and that's my point.  There's specific conditions that have to be met in order for the perk to be useful.  It's inert and useless for 99% of the match.  If you need to use it before escape is an option, you're as good as dead anyway since the killer is probably good enough to get you again.
---
Yeah, I've finally won a few, but hardly used his power. :/
---
There is a guaranteed hook upstairs.
---
LMAO
---
I hope you will (or already have) post this up somewhere :) It's a very fun idea and I think it deserves lots of eyeballs on it!
---
That is soooo cute x
---
it has been. there have been countless posts about it. this and the basement glitch are extremely game breaking and should be fixed faster than their "one to two week" mark they said. people should just stop playing until its fixed... they will fix it faster when their numbers drop across all platforms significantly
---
I will never understand why the devs create locations that can be blocked like this. That just seems like game design 101.
---
wait i can stop my teammate from healing me? holy shit i literally stopped playing survivor altogether when i got like 4 games in a row where a teammate got me killed because he wouldnt stop healing me so i could run
---
Also
---
Me: specifically walking past basement to not bug them even* if they wiggle
---
Survs: "baby killer"
---
I'm two games from just going back to basement hooking them
---
*Edit
---
While you died because you wanted to save your teammate, camping shouldt be rewarded, just leave while somebody is camping, unless you can go in with your whole team, sure your teammate will die but he only got one kill.
---
About the end game chat just dont react to anything  those people say, it is toxic and it doesnt add anything to the end result.
---
Finger sucking is a legit reason to play Clown.
---
But it isn't.  It's useless until 4 specific conditions are met.  You can go an entire match without using it effectively and still die, which at that point it was just a wasted perk slot.
---
not worth the time unless you are on coms with swf. otherwise whose to say that your teammates are gonna know this or even do it if they do know?
---
i very rarely DC, but they people DC because theyre so fucking boring to play against. i want to DC when i go against a Legion. constantly holding down m1 - whether it bebecause of generators or mending - is boring. i know its so shitty to DC, but sacrificing 10-15 minutes of your life to something as boring as Legion just doesnt always feel worth it
---
You love to see it
---
yup, I dont play killer but apparantly even max sense only allows for about a 30 degree turn
---
Big fan I see! This looks awesome. Really looks like an old photo
---
where are my melanin infused daddies
---
Thanks for taking time to reply.  
---
I feel like the current legion's power is super underwhelming.  Most of the times you activate it you will hit one or 2 survivors.  So while you have applied the deep wound to the second survivor, the first already mended.  I do like the idea of the detection it gives though.  
---
I wanted my rework of Legion to sway the power away from the ideology of " stall for time and injure everyone, then become M1 killer" to "Chase one survivor down in the intense 30 second game of who can out mind game the other".
---
I wanted his power to be a more intense version of a classic chase.  So instead of looping pallets and vaults, its mind games and 360s from the survivor to make legion miss his attack and have to either try again when their power came back or chase like normal.
---
The "base" version keeps everything's max level color. There are Red and Blue templates tho. If you want specific perks with specific colors, you can get the gold icons [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/e5nge4/the_golden_pack_updated_for_cursed_legacy/) and change them yourself
---
I personally don't like changing perk colors to pink which is why it isn't a feature by default
---
Then we're back to the obnoxious loading screen and the possibility of it all happening it again.
---
You are correct though and it can definitely be a band-aid but I want BHVR to actually address it.
---
Appreciate you commenting too because it's good to provide solutions of any kind so people know their options.
---
New players should play against other new players, don't bring your rank 20 friends to rank 1
---
I use discordance, nurses, pop, and bbq. If you don't want to use bbq you could use save the best for last if that fits your fancy
---
I‚Äôm dying at your fucking arm lmfaoo
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve been playing him today at red ranks and it‚Äôs probably the worst feeling killer in the game. Survivors just have to go around corners or rocks and they can‚Äôt get hit because you physically can‚Äôt turn sharp enough to hit them. Not to mention if you try using your dash to close distance. Your only chance is catching them off guard at a gen but even then it‚Äôs really hard to hit if they try to juke it. Great killer for PC but I think they need to say something about how they feel he is on console.
---
If you came from, where I was from... You‚Äôd be fuckin‚Äô dead.
---
Honestly, with the number of tragic origins in the non-licensed killers (since they can‚Äôt alter the lore of the listeners ones), I‚Äôve always been under the impression that the entity is feeding on the corrupted killers just as much as the survivors.  Adiris‚Äô hope she can save her long-dead people, Spirit‚Äôs hope for revenge, etc.  allowing them moments of lucidity to realize what they‚Äôre actually doing is like sprinkling Pepper on the Entity‚Äôs Tortured Survivor Carbonara
---
What do you mean it's not high rank, it's in the purple. There's yellow, green, purple, and red. It's right past that middle mark how is purple rank not high rank
---
Lmao imagine being this bad at survivor where you think this
---
&gt;You can go an entire match without using it effectively and still die
---
lol ok
---
Name some better survivor perks. Hell, name even a single one. I noticed you never responded to that when you went off on your tirade about balance or some shit
---
What if I only write "gg"
---
&gt;Well that is another gen and a half done (without boxes).
---
Just run Ruin, Pop, and Thanatophobia like every other killer in the game.
---
&gt;One, who misses healing skillchecks lmao. Two, why bring SC when you already have a medkit. Just heal eachother and save 16 seconds, room for an insta or a toolbox and a perk slot.
---
Literally everybody, had a rank 3 miss two on me just last night.  Your teammates are the least reliable people on the planet in this game.  They're more likely to sandbag you than heal you.
---
Don't need a toolbox when you can hit genny checks.  Besides when everyone throws up a toolbox you know the killer is going to slot in Franklins.
---
same except as the killer, i was wondering if exposed was bugged because i couldn't wall hack them
---
Common visual bug.
---
Relaunch the game.
---
Gg EZ baby killer
---
I am done arguing your response indicate you lack so much knwoledge about this game there really isn't a point.
---
&gt; I run into NOED in 90% of the games I play.
---
&gt;And what if that totem happens to be Thrill
---
&gt;  if you're already puking she can...one tap you
---
&gt; Let me know when dedicated server get fixed and I'll tell you when vaulting becomes useful
---
&gt; But everyone tells me self care is useless and hinders the team now
---
&gt; in purple ranks almost every huntress I get is running it.
---
&gt; Oh, wait it out, only 60 seconds? Hmmm sounds familiar, almost like DS.
---
This all is some flat-earthener level of dumb. 
---
But anyhow gl hf learning the game and you'll learn for yourself the hard way.
---
Big brain plays
---
Yea...... no
---
I LOVE pig tbh. Saw is my favorite horror series next to Scream. It‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm at like rank 16 with killer, but I get quads almost every game with her and it feels so satisfying to puts traps on people.
---
I main survivor, but playing killer feels so easy. I think it‚Äôs because I watch a lot of really good players like Monto and I just copy what they do haha.
---
I got a second body but damn its just a recolored top under the jacket
---
Great counter point, have fun crying about DS.
---
Adrenaline, it's the most clutch perk in the game.
---
i love playing meyers cuz it really feels like the movies. "why are they running. I'm just looking at them"
---
What do you mean? Survivors already lose collision after taking a hit to squeeze by the killer. They can even walk into other survivors.
---
#facts
---
Exactly this. It's better off to just leave if they're being camped and ignore the chat. Don't contribute to the toxicity by responding. Just move onto the next game.
---
I have the Same Problem now did someone find a was to fix it?
---
Ok Thanks. Never seen or heard about it before.
---
Same things happened to me three times today. Even when I got off the hook I was still stuck in the shadow realm until DS happend.
---
Wow, guys thanks for all the likes! Who would be interested if I started doing DbD skits for my YouTube channel?
---
They are Japanese. Not Alabamanese
---
You need to lvl him up and get decent perks or else hes a low tier Billy. Also even if youre playing Oni that wont stop the game from being over in 3 minutes.
---
I mean I recently got Adept Plag on my third game of Plag ever, at rank 12
---
They still are hard though
---
No right now it‚Äôs dumb if they made a more skill based thing it would be alright
---
I have been in red ranks and he demolished one of my teams and then we escaped in another game.
---
Had no success playing him personally and agrees he feel horrible. But between stupid plays of survivors and general dead spaces in maps, I'm sure people can perform with him. 
---
But trust me, when you get a team that really knows how to loop, GGs.
---
Dead by trapper!!!
---
&gt; They are 100% toxic...
---
Your opponent trying to win is not toxic.
---
Anything else? Or are you done?
---
I really liked Until Dawn (and Man of Medan as well, but UD was a better and longer game). I would like to see an Until Dawn chapter in DbD but I think the Wendigo would be a bit too similiar to the Hag, no?
---
Rank 4?  You absolute mad lad, I'm sure that was the most frustrating grind but that's super impressive.

Engineer's toolbox cannot sabotage.

Why do those orbs remind me of the ones in KH2 struggle battles.
---
Are you telling me people use a geforce launcher for games
---
I looove their games. UD and MoM &lt;3 and yeah see that‚Äôs the thing, there‚Äôs a lot of similarities to the other killers. May be why pennywise isn‚Äôt in it as well.
---
my reaction exact
---
Bonk bonk to the honk you go.
---
[Here you go](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
&gt;If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
&gt;New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
You're rank 17 so it's (questionably) working as intended.
---
Yeah I'd call that several levels of skill above just being "adept."
---
Thanks, i was like "i dont want see my teammate die cause of that, i can try" but was Just a stupid idea
---
I'm pretty sure they're aware of the bug but you have to actually give them time to pinpoint the problem in order to fix it. Debugging isn't something that happens with the snap of the fingers, especially for a smaller studio. It hasn't even been 24 hours. Like, chill and wait a bit.
---
It was a community skin contest organised by BHVR. A survivor skin and a killer skin. The killer skin that has been chosen is this one. The elephant mascot for the clown. It will be added to the game for sure but i don't know when.
---
like I might be bias because I love legion but like why. if they had to nerf a killer nerf Myers or billy. they at least had aspects that could of been changed. legions already dead
---
I posted a video of her looping skills a week or so ago... check it out, she isnt bad!
---
No sprinting as in, running. You know the 70% of the game
---
Yes, it will get added to the game as a Clown costume at some point.
---
Would the map sizes double then? I can‚Äôt imagine that many people on tiny maps like haddonfield. There would also need to be double the pallets or windows so that all the pallets don‚Äôt immediately get deleted 3 gens in
---
I like to think when I'm being camped like that as the easiest way to help my team escape. Wasting 2 minutes of the killer's time doing absolutely nothing. I just hope my teammates take advantage of the killer being occupied and do gens.
---
Also, only downside of camping is their emblem gets affected. Cant remember which one but if another survivor is near they get penalized for camping.
---
This would honestly be one of my mains. I‚Äôd also be interested in Predator or alien making it but I feel like the could be a tough design
---
Yeah, maybe.
---
Damn, didn‚Äôt know about that. Thanks for info
---
Thank you was just about to post this as it took me abit to find this out
---
Buff? Are you insane? Hes good enough as is. Jesus.
---
Also try https://www.twitch.tv/otzdarva
---
He's wholesome af and shows the more fun / positive side instead of always meta competitive stuff
---
Doing the challenge while the bug is around to get the challenge over with \*is\* kinda taking advantage haha. Unless they're on third hook, then they're dead anyway.
---
Isnt every fucking killer if you do it well enough?
---
That's how it used to be and it made sense, like, it was still a challenge to kill all 4 survivors because of the hatch, but you were also able to totally deny it if you got a really good game and killed the other 3 before they finished 2 gens.  It was tough but reasonably doable with some practice and learning how to play the killer, now it's like, you need to be an expert and also still screw around to farm points while not letting the survivors take back control.
---
I absolutely am in love with this meme , just the cat sitting in the background feeling utter betrayal. Make me giggle
---
Im rank 3, played with rank 3, 16(!) and 20(!!!) survivors and rank 7 hunter.
---
PrEtTy gOoD JoB So FaR
---
I feel you I had a medkit with two charge add ons and it broke super quick
---
I have all of them in teachable! Like last week... I'm so sad
---
Warframe releases are way, WAY huger than DBD patches. DE doesn't break the whole fucking game by just releasing a new warframe, a new skin and 3 mods. And I've never seen them really break the game even with major releases like Railjack, unlike BHVR who sends the code to the shadow realm by adjusting one of Claudette's hair styles.
---
dude this aesthetic af - genuinely creepy i love it, especially the graininess of it
---
N word /= / funny
---
easily A tier
---
Hey, what killer/survivor do you play and why?
---
Almost stabs his hand. Pure anger. Jesus
---
Yeah I got one use after adding 2 additional charges addons and was extremely disappointed.

This may come in handy, i just found it myself. Its a list of short forms and lingo 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/9152/dbd-slang-lingo-guide-wip

Just awful luck. Whenever I play trapper they get out right away god forbid I step on a trap as survivor cause it'll take half a decade before I get out.

Bill never had any cosmetics in any valve games, Quentin on the other hand

It's been a meme for years to mori/camp/tunnel content creators. Cant recall why but hey people have to put their name out there somehow.
---
I.....how can a small child make me feel like I shouldn't kill survivors anymore....
---
Ps: I love it, the most adorable thing i've seen in awhile!
---
Charges don't work at all
---
The one that increases the healing speed and takes 8 charges also doesn't affect them

---
If you think you should escape 50% of the tome regardless even if your team is mediocre and the killer plays well then i guess your right there is no way to change your mind. I think if you played or even just watch streamers play killer at rank 1 it might change your perspective.
---
Survivor Adepts could maybe be harder, but really I feel like the purpose of adept achievements should be to get players to be giving each killer/survivor set of perks a fair chance to try out, and be reasonable to complete.  There's harder and more grindy achievements, and especially having tougher archive challenges for people that want to test themselves, I think makes up for it.  There's no real rewards tied to getting the achievements, so I don't see the need to have them be /this/ difficult.
---
Huh, no wonder it felt like my medkit with double charge addons got consumed so quickly.

You'll get a match but need to let it search long enough to expand the ranks it'll accept.
---
And around 10 seems to be the best spot as it'll search for Rank 16 through Rank 4.
---
Thanks.

Why run self-care

It was me who asked for it, someone gave me a link to a meme maker and I took the time to make it

CJ tech, EzClap
---
you're like that guy from Lady in the Water that's half buff
---
Those statistics dont mean anything. Bhvr even came out and said that you cant drawn any conclusions from them but anyone thats knows anything about data and analytics already knows that.
---
Adrenaline is a 3 second sprint burst that only activates in endgame. The rest of the match you're working with 3 perks total. And if you're at full health when the gates are powered while not being chased by the killer it's actually worthless. 
---
It's not as good as DS, which can grant value at any point during the match, not just when gens are powered. At max value, Adrenaline is worth an escape from one hit. At max value, DS is worth an escape from one dying state. Their value floors are the same. DS is objectively better. There is one time when Adrenaline *can* match DS value. But it can never exceed DS' value. If you're unhooked after the gates power on, Adrenaline is worth one escape from the dying state, excluding stuff like NOED or TEW3. That is the only scenario that allows Adrenaline to be worth as much as DS. 
---
Now, that's not to say Adrenaline is bad or even not great. It's one of the five best perks in the game at high ranks, for sure. It does allow for some clutch plays and creates space if you can get to the endgame. But it's not as good as DS, which is a general use perk that will almost always generate value, and simply by its existence often change the killer's behavior just to avoid it in some scenarios.
---
Your fav is No0b3
---
You get Mrs. Vorhees.
---
Bullshit. BHVR is 100% responsible for this. It's their game. Blaming the killers is like a Prison Warden leaving a gun in the prison's cafeteria for anyone to pick up and then blaming the prisoners when somebody gets shot.
---
He was medium difficulty to use on PTB and then they increased a bunch of recovery times and reduced his turning radius on charge attack, so now he's pretty hard to use on live. It's not as hard to use as Hillbilly, but it's not easy either.
---
Honestly my first 10 or so games with him I was seriously regretting buying him, but I'm starting to get used to it. I've gone from "definitely maining" to "eh maybe it's finally time to learn to curve chainsaws".
---
I read it with his voice tbh

There's no one acting like the game isn't broken. This patch is trying to take Legion's DLC's and the "Wake Up affecting everything"'s cake for being the most buggy yet
---
Well I actually find a was to fix it xD You Just have to restart Ur Switch completly. Not stand by Just Turn it Off...
---
The three bottom one are absolute *C H A D S*
---
Yep, you just enter the abyss as survivor when hooked in the basement, unfortunately
---
I had a brown medkit with 16+12 extra charges add ons, so it had 44 charges or enough for about 2 and a half heals but I only got one heal out of it and its funny bc I thought maybe it was thanataphobias doing but it appears not
---
So it‚Äôs bad for certain killers, that does not make it an infinite. An infinite is a loop where the killer can never catch the survivor at a loop because they can not physically catch up to them. The window on iron works blocks after 3 vaults, just like any window in a loop. Just because you can‚Äôt catch a survivor in a loop before a minute does not make it an infinite. Maybe your post should about nerfing good loops because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre describing, not infinite‚Äôs. There used to be infinite‚Äôs but they‚Äôve all been removed.
---
I wasnt aware of that thats really helpful! Ill try some more tonight i searched around 10 11 and 12 but no luck yet
---
Laurie mains staring at the killer with object of obsession and then the killer starts heading towards them
---
ikr?
---
Wowee! Even more toxic than in game :)
---
Yea, figured it was a meme but wasn't entirely sure
---
So what exactly happened here? if you don‚Äôt mind me asking. He was stuck hit you and then he wasn‚Äôt? Is that always the same place that they can get stuck? And why was he in two places at once? Sorry I haven‚Äôt played on the new map
---
I think it started with other streamers tbh
---
Looks like you got beat by the A U T I S M
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a good idea but actually implementing it  in the current dbd just wouldn‚Äôt be that great
---
Yeah, the voice he gave him is just too good.
---
Multiple posts from survivor POV, happened to me once
---
Isnt there also a guaranteed gen?
---
I don't think he's weak I think the optimization on console is what is holding him back on the console version of the game.
---
If you're referring to just needing to kill all 4 survivors to get the Adept achievements, then yeah, it was changed to require a Merciless Killer rating with the emblem system.  
---
I also have done what you did, for the last several DLCs, of just playing new killers with only their perks until finally getting the Adept done, it's just insanely difficult when their perks really don't do anything to help you and lack synergy with each other and/or your power.
---
Isnt self care like one of the most meta perks?
---
The new bill shirt blends in perfectly too, coincidence?
---
Meanwhile I haven't had a single good game with him.
---
I know what you mean my man. More room for some cake.
---
Also the lack of control sensitivity and aim acceleration. I'd really love to know when the fuck they're going to get around adding more options for us console scrubs. I was so looking forward to this new killer as he sounded like he would be incredibly fun but God damn was I disappointed last night when I tried playing him for like 10 games in a row and got maybe five kills. At least I only spent shards on him and not actual money.
---
The fix I think the person you replied to was suggesting is maybe a spot you can vault down or just walk down that isnt the staircase on this map. And in other maps that have places like this, a similar second way to leave the area.
---
Yes, it is a bug. Does not happen every time. 
---
They will not be banning for it, as many people do not know.
---
So you prefer the killer just get gen rushed.....?
---
There‚Äôs been at least 1k post on the subreddit about this
---
It's really a terrible rule though. I understand the need to open up the beginner ranks due to population,but there still needs to be a hard cap, maybe around rank 10. New guys going against purple ranks is just dumb.
---
The new chapter pretty much broke everything ü§ó
---
Idk if he was camping their body, and if he was then yeah, it was shitty. If he wasn‚Äôt, though, and you just left the other player down, that might be why they both got so put off as to work together against you. If they thought you were gonna let the last guy bleed out in hopes of getting hatch, then I can understand their annoyance. 
---
That said, I don‚Äôt think what they did was right; if I were the killer in this situation I‚Äôd just go hunt you down myself. I‚Äôd still want you to die first, but I wouldn‚Äôt want an unfair advantage in doing so; if your teammate started sandbagging like that I‚Äôd probably go ahead and hook them. It‚Äôs a bit ridiculous they couldn‚Äôt find you if you really were continuing to crank out gens.
---
I except it as a way of life now. Like death, taxes and existential dread.

---
I feel your pain, but who knows maybe he'll get some work done in the next rework. So far I'd say the devs have been doing very well with the reworks so I'm sure they can make something good out of him.
---
Boy you should see the Switch version. The graphics are horrible (I saw a traper gameplay video and the ground texture for when Trapper is picking up his traps made me want to puke), and the FPS is 24 tops, which makes the game barely playable in a casual way, and 100% unplayable in an even remotely competitive way. You also can't play any sort of killer that requires more precise mechanic control because of the constant stuttering.
---
Its longer then his basic kitchen knife
---
People who try and work with me when I‚Äôm killer are the best!

There is a work around on Xbox, but not on PS4.

I mean they are pointless it‚Äôs only to make the matchmaking quick
---
couldnt have been on console.
---
why cant we do this on console i'm trying to figure out?   you can barely pivot his run maybe 10 degrees in each direction.  there's no turning lol
---
Killer i like myers the build up from tier 1-3 plus he has the creep factor with the music. Hid like i did when i was a youngerüôà. I think that is why i was able to immerse myself easier with dbd. Plus legion the first time i witnessed iridescent button i lost my mind.üò¶.
---
Survivor main is meg or nea. Both are pretty cool.but i really want to take yui for a run. üòâ
---
Would be hard to steal when it's my stream
---
No it wouldn't xD It would give the killer a free kill what even
---
I was right behind a survivor running into a bush and I literally lost them.
---
fun fact, BHVR played around with the idea of being able to kick away someone trying to unhook you, but felt that it was too janky to be implemented into the full game
---
Exactly, she must amazing at brushing her teeth
---
I personally hope that the monster in their upcoming game is good so we can get a Dark Pictures Anthology chapter.
---
Conrad and Emily would be sick survivors in my opinion
---
It really is such hit or miss, like "oh great this killer actually has a good perk/a couple good perks, this will help" vs "these don't do anything, literally."  Hag getting to play with Hex: Ruin sure was a treat, or killers with insta-downs help (at least for getting the achievements before the emblem system rework).  I'm curious now just how many adepts I did before they changed Merciless from 4k to Iridescent emblems.
---
It‚Äôs just ‚Äúa lot scarier‚Äù 
---
Sorry I had to do it to em.
---
ID DIE TO GET CONNIE AS A SURVIVOR
---
Check the symbol on the back, it's a different colour, but yes.. that is the 'exclusives' for you..
---
&gt; And if you're at full health when the gates are powered while not being chased by the killer it's actually worthless.
---
I'd rather have it and not need it, than not have it at all.  It's not at all worthless as it even works if you're hooked or downed.  That's three separate occasions it can help you to DS' one.
---
&gt;It's not as good as DS, which can grant value at any point during the match
---
Except it's pointless to DS at any point other than what's going to be your third hook, or if escape is an option.
---
I ran DS before it got nerfed and even then if I had to pick one to keep, it would be adrenaline.  It's saved me more than any other perk in the game.
---
&gt;I believe in it.
---
I hate to say this to you, but you shouldn't. The halloween event fiasco and the constant game-breaking...everything with extremely poor optimization on PC and laughable performance everywhere else, combined with the 0 amount of effort to fix them makes it very clear that BHVR cares very little about the game.  If the devs don't care about the game then it has no hope.
---
Personally I hate blizzard the whole blitzchung thing was horrible and ruined any love I had for overwatch atleast bhvr hasn‚Äôt said anything that controversial

It's your fault because the game was over with OPEN exit gates.  The rest of us get that the killer is probably going to camp in that scenario because strategically where else would you have them go in that situation?  You already ended the game, the gates open, no objectives left on map for them to patrol.  
---
If you're going to give killers salt over camps make sure they did it with gens still up because the rules change once the exit gates are open.  I feel like 99% of survivors accept that.

Will give it a shot, thanks

1) The rank reset changes really slow that progress down, I'd have to actively spend a day intentionally de-ranking to make it easier, which I honestly can't recall if that's a bannable thing or not, bit still sounds boring anyway.  
---
2) Wish I could bruh, I'm compelled to do achievements for games I like.  The process might not be the most fun, but hey, pretty sure reddit was made to complain about things. :P
---
Ranks are pointless......get rid of them and start consistently matching red rank killer/survivor vs. Yellow rank opponent/opponents and see how that statement holds up.  This statement has and always will be absurd.  Rank absolutely serves a purpose.  It's supposed to match equivalently expereienced/skilled players with each other.  Does it work perfectly?  Hell no!  It's quite busted at times but it still works more than it doesn't in accomplishing that goal.  There is a world of difference (on average) between a red and yellow rank player.
---
Damn that‚Äôs clutch I use the toolbox and medley a lot &amp; never knew definitely gonna try it out with my friends thanks for the tips guys
---
At this point, I think all killers are aware of this basement glitch and are still hooking people in basement for easier games.
---
As a survivor main, I think it‚Äôs annoying. But I have to admit that it would be dumb of him to let anyone have the opportunity to free him after the doors have been open. If the door is opened and the killer face camps, I‚Äôll typically leave unless my team is pretty good and can pull it off. Bragging wasn‚Äôt really earned for him tho. He should‚Äôve proxy camped, that way he had an opportunity to get more survivors had they gone into the dungeon.
---
Imagine thinking killers at red ranks having a 70% kill rate which is...required to stay in red ranks; is overpowered. Wahhh devs killers are overpowered they‚Äôre better at the highest rank possible and it‚Äôs difficult to escape! That‚Äôs how inane people like you sound. Killers have to have that kill percentage in order to pip / stay in red ranks.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had the exact same thing. I know when they‚Äôve got bloodlust because I lose frames, also when they‚Äôve got sloppy butcher and I get hit I lag and lose frames
---
This is a bad joke?  The new perks a situational shits
---
Right around the time my back pain starts flaring up...
---
He's not weak. But he has some pretty bad playabilty issues on console. That's what people are upset about.
---
&gt; And the perks are good
---
they're really not.
---
I tried to. I got 3 games in a row where survivors DC'd in a droves after the first down.
---
They kinda already did this. You know, with the hag.
---
Nurse has been a nightmare because of the M1/M2 input lag.
---
Sometimes you‚Äôll charge a blink, and it won‚Äôt show itself but Loop the nurse wheezing noise infinitely until you let go, sometimes you suffer fatigue with no movement speed reduction, and sometimes M1 won‚Äôt register after a blink, so you just go Fatigue and miss.
---
I mean that‚Äôs what I meant when I said it makes matchmaking faster should of specified I meant it as a competitive stand point like it‚Äôs no use cause this games not competitive
---
I feel the game change just a little bit lol I would wait for the new xbox but if for some reason the new xbox have separated matchmaking for dbd people will have to wait ages for find a match as a killer at least the first 6-10 months
---
Survival mode could be fun, but you might have to rework hooking since one killer could camp the hook while the other goes out and hunts survivors.
---
That is uh, dangerous.
---
Whoops, sorry should've read everything. I just read like half of it and assumed you were a BHVR apologist like half this sub.

Nope but is he good? Let me knowüòâ

Getting unhooked by a survivor while in the killer's terror radius without borrowed time allows you to instantly put the farmer into the dying state and allows you to mori him out of spite.

It‚Äôs not going to get better. I‚Äôm sorry. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that you are bad, try to take it as a learning experience. I was fighting rank 5‚Äôs in green ranks, and red ranks when I was in purple.
---
There are like 200 posts and memes about it on this sub
---
I understand having issues. What I don't understand is how they release these horribly broken updates seemingly without testing. Like if they just played 1 or 2 games, they would've seen this bug and could've just not released the update.
---
Same here, that‚Äôs what I want
---
Or we just take away any survivor hit penalties on legions power and nerf the time, then add a teleport power that requires a full charge which you need to open a locker, an empty locker then allows you to teleport and take control of one of the other 3 legion members hiding in random lockers. 
---
Survivors opening lockers with NPC legions take a hit and suffer from exposed status for 3 seconds. Each time legion teleports to another legion he gets exposed for 4 seconds.
---
Tbh it gets worse with every update. Console optimization lmao.
---
In which case, they would STILL be abusing a shitty mechanic. That archives objective isn't even hard if you're not terrible. Embarrassing that you need the game to literally break to achieve it lmao.

The saddest thing is getting your generator to 95%, trying to pop it, but the killer shows up and stops you.
---
If they hit you.
---
I keep getting the complete opposite. I'm rank 9 that had rank 16, 18, and 20 players in my last match. Seriously?

Takes a bit to get used to it but once you have the flicks down, Oni with controller is still great. The controller vs m&amp;k argument doesn't really make sense to me. I feel like this game is fantastic with either.
---
Interesting...you learn something new everyday thanks !
---
I love how Tapp just looks slightly tan
---
What a duck lmao let the man be happy
---
The joke was that you can do all of that on PC.
---
Just make it so you drop it on trial, but can still get it back. Otherwise the perk is (more) useless
---
Well then it's a good thing you can run both. 
---
A lot of high rank survivors usually do. Adrenaline, DS and Dead Hard are the three most common perks that I encounter during my matches. Balanced Landing is after that.
---
You have to hook people in the basement for the challenge, its not there fault that it's broken. Do you actually expect people to pay for the archives and not try and complete it just because they have to hook people in the basement which is currently broken?
---
Doing that would need a complete redesign and it might as well be a new Killer. Fun idea tho.
---
What I am doing is trying to make what Legion has now, useful.
---
huzzah! Praise!
---
That's my secret Cap, im always shifting the blame.
---
Your lucky, keep getting spirit perks which is ironic
---
I got stuck with the clown on a generator in the pale rose
---
Hell, just a power to apply map pressure would be powerful. I forget I have pallets or snares when I play Freddy sometimes. Playing as a m1 killer who has that ability to teleport is still fairly strong unless it's against top tier survivors.
---
Legion and Doctor have no such map pressure which is where they fall. At least Plague has either sorta insta downs (no cleansing) or becomes super huntress (with cleansing) but without map pressure her gens will probably still get done.
---
The best is when you hook someone, turn around, and slap a crouched Feng in the face with your monster dong, and they still accuse you of camping.
---
Okay, now thats cute
---
Well the hag is actually a wendigo. A girl kept in captivity and starved who ended up eating flesh to survive. She then got possessed by a cannibalistic spirit. I mean her mori is literally her eating the survivor.
---
That‚Äôs what I was talking about
---
Oh man.. I thought I was suddenly stupid. But apparently I'm just unobservant
---
Nah, I don't mean doing it specifically NOW to use the bug. I mean that it needs to be done now, there's only a month of the rift left. And they said the bug wont be fixed for 2 weeks. It's unfortunate timing.
---
On Playstation he feels very bad to play. It's not even possible for us to make it so certain buttons turn so we can somewhat control him more easily. The options are flat out blacked out for us.
---
Probably, the hitbox is the same no matter if you are playinga  bulky guy like trapper or doctor or a smaller framed killer like legion, hag or Freddy. It's crappy but technically it's only fair that the hitboxes are equal across all killers. You'll just have to get used to it, or use Enduring and don't respect 'em at all!
---
The new map is so dark, someone will literally turn a corner and I'll lose them.
---
Blood orbs are going to get nerfed, I think. Been playing a bunch of Oni and the tracking they offer is out of this world. The fact that you can see them through walls is crazy.
---
He's not bad. Just a worse billy. And no, billy is not harder.
---
I will. P.s i don't mind the f-bombs. Sometimes they are called for in my books. The first time i saw a cod lobby video i freaked. That rocked me. toxic times a thousand.
---
Idk man he can snowball pretty hard off of his power as long as you just slug and don‚Äôt pick anyone up. It‚Äôs a bit toxic to slug lol but just keep practicing and you‚Äôll get better with him.
---
I think it‚Äôs just her I have the same problem and I use the purple hair

&gt; You say there are factors that make the data unreliable. I am asking you to prove it.
---
It is literally self-evident: it does not control for
---
* rage quits
---
* afk killers
---
* killers who let the survivors live
---
* ebony moris
---
* suicide missions
---
* early leavers which make the game fundamentally unbalanced
---
* memers
---
* griefers
---
* pity sacrifices
---
And a host of other relevant variables.
---
Also I am not saying the data is unreliable; that would imply the actual numbers are wrong. What I'm saying is that it is not adequate to make an analysis of game balance.
---
That distinction is incredibly important. I have asserted it over, and over and you continue to ignore it.
---
&gt; Please tell me where you think I went wrong.
---
you went wrong when you decided somehow that all of these incredibly relevant factors not being considered doesn't matter. Again, you are engaging in statistical analysis without even the most basic fundamentals of statistical analysis being met. Your position is broken at its core because of that.
---
DS for sure
---
As a Myers main, he‚Äôs in good shape at the moment, may we suggest Spirit?
---
This is why I‚Äôm falling in love with Oni right now. So many 1 hook matches are now turning into 2-3 sacrifices when they all rush him instead of leaving.
---
Ds or adrenaline
---
I still need it haha

---
Any killer that can't disable a loop is bad against an infinite... so that would be 14/18 cast killers we currently have.
---
And have you even considered the amount of time that loop takes for a chase at minimum? Compare that to something like killer shack and I think you'll understand why they are still called infinites.
---
Because most people already caught on that he's a not that good. So they went back to their favorite killer after unlocking his skills... I like the new map though, but the Oni really isn't that great he's got great looks, but looks ain't gettin' you hooks!
---
Well killers gotta keep pointing it out if survivors are gonna keep bitchin
---
Arenaline 1000%
---
And that's the reason why we shouldn't stop talking about it until they properly address the problem instead of going radio silent.
---
It‚Äôs cuz of the new challenges
---
You meme this, but there are a lot of killers that just nearby and wait for you to hit struggle phase to screw you over.
---
I'm becoming especially good at this.
---
In theory he‚Äôs OP (imo) because of the blood trails and ability that‚Äôs similar to Billy‚Äôs but easier to turn etc... but on PS4 he‚Äôs bad, like BAD. I escaped every single Oni I faced today.
---
That's happened to me, but I had merciless killer
---
I never give hatch so I don‚Äôt have to play favourites. If I know I already pipped and the game was challenging, I give them the death they deserve. The only time I show mercy is when there is like two dc‚Äôs at the beginning of game or teammates were complete potatoes and died within like 8 minutes. Then I usually farm and let them go.
---
I believe it's one of the reasons the community was upset when the Event Exclusives which were actually good weren't given out this patch lol

I hate to be that gut if they did have a child it would not be incest. Genetically they would be extremely different and no longer related. 
---
So morally dont do it, genetically its alright.
---
Yui is definitely great for beginners, being able to lift up pallets lol, I'm glad you use Myers or legion since they are great starting killers lol. I would level up meg first since she can sprint away fast üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
i had been saving up &amp; just bought Legion with shards the actual day before this change occurred. i am so annoyed right now. should have just bought someone else.
---
But if they buffed him I‚Äôd cry. I think they need to rework the mechanics on console, that‚Äôs all. A killer that can track, insta down and is extremely fast with his ability does not need a buff. 
---
Also, he‚Äôs new, people just need to get used to playing him.
---
Frankly, it's startling how hard you're fighting against basic statistical analysis standards
---
Did you not read the news tab on the game menu? They gave everyone a bunch of cosmetics that were originally codes given out at game events and such. Check your survivors, you probably have a bunch for some of them now.
---
its been explained. the keys for the cosmetics were through steam only and key resellers were selling them for ridiculous amounts of money so they decided instead of steam only having them, and a big fuck you to resellers, they gave them all out free
---
billy does not need a nerf at all
---
In my defense, if it‚Äôs 3 or more items, or two or more flashlights/toolboxes. I run Hag without Ruin, so you understand that flashlights and toolboxes are not the best for my fun game experience. I used to run it on two of any item period, but since Medkits got reworked idrc.
---
i have gone on a very very similar tangent about this game in a bug report. i talked about how i have friends who have bought this game and refuse to play because the quantity and severity of bugs is comical. the game is a joke. the people who play this game dump hundreds of not thousands of hours and drop tons of money on cosmetics, yet the game continues to be all but unplayable. i got a response from someone who basically just tried to calm me down. basically said ‚Äúrest assured we‚Äôre doing all we can.‚Äù 
---
maybe if more people bring it up to bhvr directly?  i agree that something‚Äôs got to change.
---
OH SHIT
---
That sounds like something someone from Alabama would say.
---
I hook people wherever is closer don't go to the killershack if you don't want to run the risk of being basement hooked... If BHVR was on the ball it could have been fixed already, but seeing as how they handled the Legions infinite healing bug we'll probably risk bans soon enough if we basement hook before they can patch it!
---
Billy doesn't need nerfing... He is probably the most balanced killer.
---
DS because you can level up meg for adrenaline
---
Do you know if those are available for PS4?
---
I avoid hooking people in the basement because it's unfair to break their game. What if they're just caught on a gen in a central/main building and basement spawns there?
---
Woah, what if that became a thing? Like part of the lore?
---
they would have to find a way to prevent item duplication then
---
my nightmares were at ironworks when that was a thing
---
To true!
---
Billy is actually a very balanced killer
---
Instead of nerfing strong killers they should focus on buffing the weaker killers
---
true. Memes should honestly be completely banned without actual work put into them. At least a little editing like your second picture at minimum not using mspaint on patrick lmao
---
Survivors that bring a white wards items can not be picked up by other survivors
---
gen tapping for people like myself is great if you are horrible at hitting great skill checks. i might hit 3 out of 10 if im lucky so gen tapping is key. however i usually hunt for the hex as soon as i know there is one while the other teammates are either doing gens, keeping the killer occupied, or searching as well. if it takes 2 minutes to find it and destroy it thats worth it imho
---
Beep boop
---
DS and Adrenaline are so good. 
---
But I would go for DS. If you don‚Äôt have Laurie, then boom free perk.  Meg is easy to level and teach it. Don‚Äôt miss out
---
Know what would be cool? How about a more obscure killer? Or someone from a web series? I‚Äôd love to see them get someone like HABIT from EverymanHybrid or Firebrand from Tribe Twelve. The Goat from Black Mountain Side or The Abjuration from The Void would be cool too!
---
how would that even be coded
---
EDIT: never mind I misread your comment. Whoops
---
Little disclaimer: I created both of these myself, so no I‚Äôm not putting anyone on blast :)
---
In my opinion we need a balance between the old ‚Äúvisually related‚Äù rules and what we have now, which allows too many basic reaction images with the same overused joke? I mean, how many times did the two screaming women with the cat, with the joke ‚Äúme who plays both sides‚Äù make front page?
---
I‚Äôm on console and I barely get him, why is he unplayable? I haven‚Äôt educated myself on what‚Äôs going on lately
---
Whatever is closed is good enough for me...  
---
Unless I run a basement Bubba, it's not a Basement Bubba is you hook 'em just everywhere!
---
What is this nonsense Billy is one of the most balanced killers
---
Wake up captain!!
---
Lucky, I got a lame ‚ÄúGg, best match I‚Äôve played in a while, thanks.‚Äù message.
---
Rip that karma
---
They sort of had that with the visually related rules but that put a lot of restrictions in place, which led to the ‚Äúsmol billy‚Äù being added to every meme to comply
---
DS without a doubt not only is it great, it's also Laurie's lvl. 40 perk meaning you'll never have to level her higher then 35 if you don't want to in the future!
---
How can a killer that has huge mobility with no punishment for collision, a one shot with increased lunge and the ability to track any injured survivor be considered bad?
---
I think Creeper would really be just another Huntress really. Big axe and throwing stars I mean...
---
Completely honest question, I don't even play SWF, but what is determined as sweaty? Trying your hardest to win? I thought that was the goal (besides obviously having fun)
---
They feel relatively the same.
---
Why are we nerfing billy? He has great aggression and map coverage, but can be looped all the same. Yes he can break pallets with his saw but that usually takes around the same time. This is similar to oni but NOWHERE NEAR the same. He has to get his power first and that can take 2-3 hits. Before that he's an m1 killer. After his power if they all heal he's back to an m1 killer. Neither of these killers need a nerf. Let's buff the bad ones first.
---
No idea but honestly you are better off getting a m&amp;k adapter really.
---
it's necessary to counter genrush
---
I ended up hooking a Claudette in the basement, forgetting about the bug. Figured it might've only been on certain maps, since Claudette seemed fine. Hooked a Bill down there as well. (It was Lery's and they were doing the gen in the middle, no other hooks around besides basement.) Went down there because I hadn't seen the Bill a few minutes after he got unhooked, poor thing was running into a wall and crouching. Picked him up, carried him out, and made him do a gen. Let all his teammates out too because I felt bad. Gave him hatch as well! I swear survivors are the cutest things when they're friendly.
---
*Burn it*
---
Kid gets grabbed by big hand man
---
Not easy to control on ps4 same with nurse
---
If you mean people who are doing it without knowing then yes obviously, the original comment wasn‚Äôt about that though.
---
And here we goooo, the exact thing people were worried would happen after the Spirit nerfs.
---
Gotta move down the list folks! After Billy it's on to Freddy! NERF. THEM. ALL!
---
Yup, that did it. Bhvr needs to stop doing this shit every patch making their game look like complete butthole.
---
I'm super new to survivor. I think I can only afford one but should I try to get both DS and Adrenaline?
---
**Playing the Oni with Tinkerer:** "Did I sense a Gen at 85%! Peek-a-boo!"
---
I have to work a lot this week so have limited time. That being said your post is spot on with my experience last night. Played for 2 and a half hours and got no oni's, ON THE DAY OF RELEASE. I did get 4 trappers though lol
---
Idk , maybe make the item not even appear for other people. Not a coding expert
---
It really is one big joke of a Mechanic at this point and always has been in my Opinion.
---
Gen tapping doesn't render ruin pointless because it's still slowing you way down. It's better to just take the skill checks as they come, and if you don't get a great then let go of the gen and wait for the cloud to disappear so you don't trigger another. Even if you can never get a great skill check it's better.
---
Check around your first gen when you see ruin, but don't go traipsing around the map for it.
---
Here's an example video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfDKivUof08
---
I did immediately get DS but everything was good üòÇ
---
forsen1 I C BAJS
---
I thought that claudette will call her camper lul :D
---
If it glows it goes say goodbye to that tree
---
I really don't like Nancy, those arms freak me out.
---
Yea, 2 bad Freddy doesn't have a REALLY good loop counter and amazing map pressure. Oh wait.
---
Quack.
---
I got DS since while I do have Laurie it's just really helpful üòÇ
---
Swap NOED for Ruin.  NOED is a trash perk.  Causes bad decision making and losses against good groups who will cleanse your dulls preventing the crutch from activating anyways.  It only beats bad groups reliably which you definitely won't need any help doing playing Spirit anyways.
---
I've had a couple games where I can't wiggle while being carried. I hit the buttons but the wiggle bar won't fill up.  Played a few games as killer where I got stick in a genny after I kicked it.  Then there's the infamous basement glitch.   
---
That's not even counting all the broken perks, terrible hit boxes, garbage tier killers that desperately need buffs.  
---
BHVR need to pull a Rainbow Six: Siege and completely overhaul the game and fix it. There's still bugs that were introduced a year ago and have yet to be fixed.
---
Decisive + head on = ez rekt
---
Who would possibly think Oni is weaker than Legion ?? He has one shot and high mobility compared to most killers lmao
---
They changed it because nemesis
---
Realistically  STBFL was not healthy on legion, he already gets free hits on survivors, getting rewarded for that is not the best gameplay for survivors, it should specifically apply sloppy though.
---
They honestly should've just changed the perk instead of fucking with the whole mechanic and gutting legion.
---
But it's beneficial to the killer to kill people fast, especially if they are gen rushing or close to finishing the match. Most people run the  60 second untouchability perk anyway so you will end up slugged and have a chance of your teammates coming to rescue you
---
I don't know if it's my controller but I feel like even at Max sensitivity on the game I turn so slow this one really sucks with nurse because you can't spin fast enough post blink.
---
This would explain how I inadvertently shook off so many chases
---
I have footage of a match against some really good survivors, and honestly if it wasnt for discordance I wouldn't have won that match. Such a nice little perk I think, I finally unlocked it in the blood web for Ghost Face so I can have some better map presence with him on some of the larger maps.
---
It was the recording software, my game runs perfectly smooth hahaha
---
Farming or sandbagging; someone is playing poorly either way ha ha
---
Nah, the time is now to do it on any killer. If you hook them in the basement it basically guarentees two people if you tunnel the unhooker, since the hooked guy is blinded until downed.
---
so they would also have to change plunderer's instinct so that it doesn't show auras of items for individual survivors on the particular point they brought a ward
---
you are asking for a lot over 1 purple flashlight
---
If you wanna be the fun police, apply to be a mod.    Otherwise, go outside and get your monthly allocation of sunshine.
---
&gt;Ok so legion now can vault windows faster, but the mend state is now completely voided as you can just run. 
---
This didn't change much... the mend state would pause within killer's TR, now survivors must be running for it to pause so they can't work on generators while inside his terror radius.
---
If anything, mending has been buffed.
---
i was also hoping for this
---
No if they did something more 1v1 can you loop the killer and survive type thing it would be who is better the killer with mind games and power usage or the survivor with looping and perk usage
---
Or they could remove Franklin from the video game
---
To be fair not every DbD player participates in forums and Reddit so they probably don't even know especially if they have messaging blocked.
---
It was a really dumb idea to make a component of a killer's power useless just to nerf a single perk
---
I mean even if it doesn't mean much anyway, it made Legion even worse :(
---
lol fuck off
---
fucking survivor mains
---
I feel like I've sees a similar art style somewhere. Are you inspired by anything?
---
Look man I just wanna see some dank memes, this ain‚Äôt Facebook. Sorry if that bothers you
---
I mean it doesn‚Äôt impact the game really, people only use it to be dicks
---
I feel so bad when I find AFK survivors. Like I don't want to hook you, but also I kind of need to get some people out of the way. 
---
I left an AFK survivor alone last night and later realized they were using my unwillingness to down them as a means to work on 2 nearby gens.
---
Generally because you can‚Äôt do a bug on console. You‚Äôre not supposed to 180 on PC but it‚Äôs bugged where console gets the backlash.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you wiggle? It looks like you had plenty of time
---
I think a big reason my friends are not interested at all in dbd is having to play survivor if we want to play together as a team. They say they found it repetitive and didn't care for it. 
---
I feel if we at least had a 2v8 my friends would be more inclined to playing killer with me as they're arguable the more interesting playstyle with powers instead of only perk builds.
---
Just because something is a joke doesn't mean it's a good, funny, or clever joke.
---
Ik I really hope they buff or rework legion soon because this is insane
---
There is a perfectly valid reason to play Clown.
---
Freddy isn't on the Switch version.
---

people use it to counter the strength of 3 commodious toolboxes. or make it harder for the team to heal.

Uhhhh why is he getting downvoted... just wondering.

---
You must be new here.   A rose by any other name....
---
We don't know sadly but if I were to guess I'd say the next Mid Chapter Update.
---
maybe he had borrowed time....
---
Wdym by not healthy? As in it prevented his effectiveness or wasnt fair for survivors because either way this killer was on the lower end of the killer list and honestly they should've left STBFL the way it was before IMO.
---
Not to mention if killer is near and not on you you have to risk mending where you are(killer may hear you) or running(killer will see scratch marks) I think mending mechanic kinda got buffed for killers and now they cant cheese anything with like pig or wraith
---
I really like playing as them so it kind of sucks that I get more hate because of it, if they're such a shit killer and your whole team is losing to them then I'm not exactly sure what to tell you. I'm not the best player and I don't even run the meta perks on them, so I don't know what that says about the survivors.
---
wait what it takes more than 1 minute to find survivor lobbies??  
---
i get insta for survivor but if u wanna play killer its 15 min or more
---
Dear god
---
Sometimes the bug doesn‚Äôt blind them, I didn‚Äôt get blinded once but I did some other time. I think it might be random.
---
I was stuck, when I was on the hook, everything just went white and I couldn‚Äôt do anything even after unhook. But when the killer came back and hit me, it worked again
---
Sure that works I suppose
---
My bad, must just be similar to another clip I saw I guess
---
Oh for sure, no survivor was good back then, but I'm saying that behaviour literally can't predict how something is going to be played until it's live, no matter how much testing
---
Or people will just DC before you get down the stairs with them.
---
We still got 1 or 2 weeks left before a hot fix. They gotta fix it then we gotta wait for MS and Sony to approve the patch.
---
Rip hillbilly the original speed king
---
I don't think it'd be much fun for the survivors, but it'd be interesting to see.
---
This is really good! Looks authentic, gives me the creeps.
---
oh ffs. you know what i mean: a condition you earn and has some interaction with the killer that wouldn't require slugging
---
Because survivors constantly DC the moment they're downed by him.
---
At least thats from my experience.

third one is me after using mori on a key player at the cost of everybody else escaping

They aren't bad, but considering they take an add-on slot and snares are just fundamentally more useful idk how you can call them better than snares
---
People were running IG and Agi because there‚Äôs a rift challenge to hook someone in the basement while someone else is in the basement with Monsterous Shrine.
---
What about perma blind?
---
Nobody is talking about it, and survivors are being ass holes about it, both exploiting it by all bringing flashlights, even if they suck with them, because you only need to scratch the camera with 0.1 seconds of light to trigger it randomly, and by taking the free win without any grace.
---
omg is that a blendy in the back by the tree? lol
---
How do you do the 2 killer glitch in this patch?
---
It takes you 5 minutes? It takes me 20 minutes at least with every goddamn error message on console.. I will never understand wtf a NAT type error is :(
---
So many times I've had a killer give me a gate, only to down me the second the gate opened and then hook me.
---
Now, I stop opening just before the gate opens and then just stand there until they move away. 
---
If they don't, oh well. They won't get the satisfaction of siking me out again
---
some random person just came up with that as a suggestion, I don't think the devs ever actually acknowledged the idea

Legion just has a problematic power. Legion is the next old freddy and will need a complete power revamp.

 Any good talking about the meme about a month ago about playing ranked I also posted that.

is that really how it has to work? I wonder if they wanted to could the put the patch out on Steam before it goes to console, and just disable cross play or something until then.

t still blows my mind that a bug like this would take longer than a day to fix, its so gamebreaking...

Yeah I'd like it too!

You'd be able to aave your own highlights with ease!

Ah yes, the souls of the weak will fit in there nicely.

Yeah I guess I wasn't so clear on that, I do like the concept of it being 4 killers but in game the other 3 don't matter at all and I don't like that. 
---
Something that I thought would be a cool power would be similar to the hologram powerup that was in Halo Reach. Sending out one of the others as a sort of decoy could lead to some interesting chases and mind games. The decoy wouldn't be able to actually attack but maybe do vaults or get stunned by pallets. The decoy could be active for about 8 to 10 seconds and would have a cool down of maybe 90 seconds.

Ironic that it's a Claudette getting farmed.

Although somewhat true, it is mainly due to his teachable perk "Deliverance" that killers attempt to hook Adam first.

yea, that seems to be whats going on lol

his power is pretty bad because you lack the ability to control it due to frame rate and the analog stick's limitations
---
It sure is
---
Yes your post sure showed them.

Wish my team did the same. Most of the times 2 of the 3 others are near to me so they can rescue me which does not happen.

‚ÄúOH IT‚ÄôS THE JUGGERNAUT, BITCH!‚Äù
---
I thought this was a Siege meme.
---
Much appreciated:D
---
Thank you :)
---
no one is upset they can't 180 on console. you cannot aim it at all because of the analog stick
---
What else can a survivor do tbh. Cant really play the game after that.
---
Fyi dont heavily rely on streamer builds because they wont be 100% effective in every match.
---
And speaking of streamers, watch otzdarva, he is by far one of the best strramers dbd got blessed with (he uploads most dbd content or stream highlights on his second channel not_otzdarva)
---
Mending really isnt that load especially if they have iron will then you can barely hear them. Also like you said it doesn't matter if your in a chase, but now not only will the timer not go down in a chase, but itll stay perfect while they're running and while mending. They made the whole mechanic survivor sided and I cant really see it in legions favor.
---
Tbh I dont care about cosmetics that much because the characters can look good if Im not playing with them. And usually the best cosmetics comes on characters who I dont main. But still if theres a chance to get something cool you expect something nice
---
Alright sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to. I just wanted not to steal your job
---
That isn't even a little true man.  Franklin's is used strategically by tons of killers myself included based on what we see in the lobby.  If I saw stacked medkits I knew they were likely instaheals and threw it on.  If I saw a key (the most broken survivor mechanic left in the game) I had to throw it on.  It's only counter otherwise is to kill 3 or more survivors. Before 3 gens get completed.  
---
Franklin's has a strategic purpose and we aren't dicks for running it.  What you're suggesting is making it so survivors have a free pass to stack lobbies with every item they want with no room for counterplay on the other side.  You need to get over your salt with Franklin's because it's causing you to say very biased and very silly things.
---
yeah kinda bad that when I see a huge game breaking bug like this and my reaction is just "well I suppose there's always *something*"
---
&gt;They will not be banning for it, as many people do not know.
---
This right here is why there will be many many assholes abusing the bug, simply because they can.

---
but that utterly defeats the purpose of franklin's which is to counter really strong items

2 vs 8 would be OP for killers. The synergy between powers and perks would cripple the 8 sweatiest meta build survivors.

White ward let‚Äôs you keep your item after the trial right?

I think it should be a true perk that fully heals the unhooked and injures the farmer

That is amazing

Yeah somewhere on here someone posted a Dev reply which said a week or two. DbD doesn't have cross play do they could honestly roll out the fix on PC as soon as it's fixed but idk if they want to wait till everyone gets it on the same time.

Normally I'd agree but BHVR isnt a giant studio. A lot or them probably do multiple jobs

Really?? That‚Äôs sucks -___- luckily she hasn‚Äôt gotten any messages yet, if she does, I‚Äôm deleting them right away type of deal. I think in all of my time playing, I‚Äôve gotten one hate message saying I play killer like a dick lol

I just did this

Thanks for the video. I was curious about something though. In the video you posted feng was tapping much faster than I usually do I can get at least 1 second fully before having to retap without getting a skillcheck. Either way it seems that gen tapping will never be BETTER, so thanks for the video. Usually solo'ing I figure people search for ruin immediately, so I figured tapping would be efficient enough. When I can play next I want to start my own timer and compare different speeds now that I've actually seen it in action.

Must be pure coincidence it is on over 90% of killers after this update, where previously it was quite rare.  Tome has been out for a while now, so just lucky then....
---
Quit trying to hide behind feeble excuses for abusing a game breaking bug.
---
you‚Äôre*
---
Ah I see, lmao
---
Ah yeah fuck those who haven't finished the tome challenges about putting people in the basement.
---
Nerf keys then the perk doesn‚Äôt need to exist, also nerf toolboxes... simple fix
---
Medkit charges are not working
---
You have a 30% chance you won‚Äôt be able to wiggle once picked up
---
Sometimes your wiggle speed drops to 0 after the killer hits someone despite them not having Mad Grit equiped
---
The basement void thing
---
Flashlight saves not working sometimes (killer regains control, looks up, gets blinded anyway, no save)
---
All players in pre-lobby group char have the same nickname color
---
Doctor has power and add-on descriptions for his rework that wasn‚Äôt even announced yet
---
Oni can hit through some walls
---
Should I go on?
---
Oh is it randomly what you get or did everyone get the same ?
---
I didn‚Äôt get dude because I don‚Äôt pay attention but thanks really confused me xD
---
That's cool but I play solo.
---
Doing God's work....
---
Two heads are better than one I suppose. I'm horrible at hitting greats, but I'm still having fun regardless.
---
Not even a little bit the maps are gigantic.
---
Poor lil susie
---
I had no idea this was a thing
---
So instead of having a perk a killer has to dedicate a very important perk slot to which only impacts certain lobbies you're saying you'd rather just have every item in the game nerfed to uselessness to the point where killers won't care if you bring anything in?  Lol!  How is that a solution to you?  Sounds like you'd be screwing over survivor as a whole all because you got salty over a perk that isn't even a thought on most players minds.
---
Yeah, best just not to play until BHVR fixes it. The more it affects their bottom line the faster they'll fix it
---
It's gonna take 2 weeks because it's the holidays. They released new content for the holidays and went on break but forgot the important step of checking for bugs.
---
Here is the remainder of the clip for anyone interested, I forgot gfycat caps video at 1 minute.

I want an x-files dlc. Mulder and Scully would be a very classy addition and I feel like the stranger things dlc really bridges that gap of accepting a show that isn‚Äôt always horror themed. I haven‚Äôt watched enough of the show to know the perfect monster they should use but it would be cool if they added a fan favorite or something.
---
Sounds like that worked exactly as designed- you brought a powerful item, the killer countered, the game rolls on.
---
I mean toolboxes are overpowered and so are keys so might aswell nerf them, in just saying it‚Äôs kind of gay that a perk makes me lose 21k bps
---
You know that David is running We‚Äôre going to Farm Forever with borrowed time to get those safety hook tokens.
---
And then those farmers are the same who say in the post-game chat that "the killer was a camper noob".
---
I've been playing for hours and have only played against him once.
---
It seems like every other match!
---
All his new sounds, do sound terrifying. But they also some how broke other sounds, like killer kicking gens, searching chests, and most importantly my small game perk!
---
Yeah OP is pretty ignorant.
---
That would be a great weapon. Give us landscaper billy pls.
---
Finger lickin' good!
---
I brought an offering to prevent that... flashlights are probably the worst item in the game too, it‚Äôs very rare you are able to get saves off with it because killers expect it so the killer just robbed me of 21k bloodpoints
---
Was REALLY hoping to see this :)
---
you cant flick on console / with a controller
---
Not gonna lie I didnt watch with audio so I had no idea that was a woman
---
Or that Ornn still only has his launch skin... And Taliyah atleast had a championship skin :(
---
ill downed the first guy not hook him then chase the other guy down hook him find the downed boy bring him to a gen
---
Actually agree with all of these.
---
Imagine playing Pig or Hag***
---
FTFY /s
---
I'm kind of disgusted they ported it to another console before optimizing consoles.
---
it prevents the item being lost if you die with it
---
Je rly got lucky his stupidity didn't cost him a trip to the hospital, brcause it easily could've been one.
---
I've been asking this for awhile, 2 killers 8 survivors, 10 gens and a huge map. Ready to hate my life please.
---
Lol for real, I just think it would be interesting having killers working together. Also creates potential for some killer coop perks, and even survivor group perks or double danger perk.
---
that sucks man, we really need the DC penalties asap
---
Ooh that's a new idea. I kinda like it. Another DLC with 2 survivors seems too much though...
---
The same thing happened to me earlier, but on Ironworks of Misery.
---
I jumped from the hill and downed a survivor midair, afterwards I have been stuck in the air at the hill.  
---
The 2 survivors that were left could blind my "new" body, but since they didn't know where I actually was, they had to fix gens and leave.
---
It really is frustrating. I move on though since there is only so much you can do in that situation. That's the rough spot with survivor and being solo.... relying on your teammates and hoping they have a brain.
---
I played ghost face on the new map, it's basically an uno reverse card in this situation.
---
To be fair this map is the WORST. I straight up refuse to play it if I‚Äôm killer.
---
Don't bully best girls &gt;:(
---
and you don't see that as a problem ?
---
I've honestly had a similar dream and also one recently where the killer grabs me and then screams that balanced landing is getting nerfed.... Found out after that it actually was getting nerfed so I must have skimmed past it somewhere and my brains picked it up.
---
I got proxy camped and killed in first hook...
---
I'm not bullying them, they're just... Not at their best spot
---
I will check him out 2nd time he was recommended.i do follow streamers but i take them more as guides for some perks and add-ons and builds i would have never tried. But seeing reddit clips and streams help some with tips as well.
---
Ohhh right. Okay yeah nevermind then
---
Not all heroes where capes some walk around with melee weapons
---
&gt;:(
---
On Pig too, nice! She can be difficult to get max deviousness on
---
Oh nice more PC circle jerk
---
I has same problem yesterday. I was playing Billy for a daily ritual, and got stuck while kicking a gen. Tried to get out running or chainsaw sprinting, but nothing I just moved like a step and got to my spot again. The survivors started to work on that gen(maybe it's a cam problem, but you are moving in the "real" game (aka for all the other players)?) When a survivor got close enough, I used chainsaw and was able to hit someone. In that moment, in a nurse's blink-like camera moment, I got teletransported to the basement and regain movement. 
---
In the endgame chat, she said I hitted her from nowhere, without being near. Luckily for me, I could explain and they didn't even think of reporting for hacks.
---
Yeah I need to move my tv or put a blanket up or something, sun reflection covers whole top right corner
---
So 6 people working on gens while 2 people get chased? Why?
---
No they can't. Because if they don't vault back they can get hit at the hay bale easily. Yoyre not invulnerable when standing on it. Either way, tractor has been changed anyways even if BL got changed (proving BL wasn't what made it OP)
---
Then don't go near it

at this point Legion is just a meme of a killer, and needs a freddy tier rework to salvage him
---
Roughly as powerful as Hillbilly. He's better than Hillbilly in some ways, and worse in others.
---
In other words, he's pretty balanced.
---
They'd have to put maps together there's a lot of similar looking maps that would work.
---
Well , technically it's behind the killer.
---
Do you really want to fight against forever freddy and 3 gen overshock doc holding the last 3 gens hostage tho?
---
I did something similar when I was playing killer, I was being friendly with this surv, they kept running to pallets so I thought ‚Äòthey probably want to do the stun the killer twice challenge‚Äô or something like that... nope turns out they were just a dick üòÇ
---
just make it sound like somebody getting into a locker, there is only three of them that can be trapped so no reason to make it too easy to identify. i agree with the teleport thing tho.
---
Extremely fun.
---
wholesome &lt;3
---
I think Doctor is getting a rework maybe after that Legion can get changed.
---
Feels less competitive and more selfish tbh.
---
I dont see how it really matters either way imo. Nobody downed survivors w legion by the deep wounds mechanic before this so how is it any different? If legions wanted to down people with the deep wound mechanic they still can just as well
---
Report him.
---
Body blocking ***like this*** is a banable offence under Unsportsmanlike behavior.
---
Body blocking by running to a vault before a survivor gets is not though.
---
r/terriblefacebookmemes
---
Sloppy, thana, ruin, and pop because of high movement speed. I‚Äôve considered thrilling tremors for slowdown/info since you lose your power once you pick someone up.
---
Or 2v6. Hard to say before you can try.
---
I really would prefer more original killers as long as they‚Äôre well thought out
---
Because Borrowed Time needed another buff.
---
For 8 survivors and 2 killers?! You do realize the killers can just patrol 2 seperate sides of the map and nothing can get done?
---
Even if they did it still doesn‚Äôt matter. They need to rework their ranking system a lot better.
---
Perk rework: decisive.
---
You hate farmers. You grab at whatever‚Äôs at hand and stab it into the nearest survivor.
---
*puts the survivor in the dying hook when stabbed
---
*the survivor that was stabbed can‚Äôt stab you back if they have the perk
---
*only a single use
---
‚ÄúYou unhooked me in front of the killer, I‚Äôm just returning the favour.‚Äù -Laurie Strode
---
Oooh didnt think about pop...with his movement speed it makes up for going out of the way to kick a gen.
---
Whats the point of shaking your head. Just comes off as toxic like what ur telling me to not do that ? To not play the game ?
---
I mean there are 2 reasons.  
---
First one is obviously not enjoyable game, plenty of bugs, way too big skill gap in rank 1 as well.  
---
Second one is i wont support a game or developers that give no shit about players.  
---
Its not about whining as i did underline it before just some warm words to devs or players to understand how the game looks like in current state ;x
---

---
Last night a killer camped and tunneled all 3 survivors only to give last hatch. I'm pretty sure we all felt this way
---
Tbaggers the whole game after any missed hatchet/pallet stun, just returning the favor
---
I love how myers was the manliest killer to a lot of people then rolls in this Japanese tank of a samurai.
---
They fixed that.
---
You do realize that two people could hope on four generators and the game would be over right?
---
Honestly don‚Äôt even remember why I was up there lmao
---
A lot of them don‚Äôt know about the glitch and just want to do their basement challenge
---
That happened to me 2 times yesterday, gladly there were survivors around,  and when i hitted one of them i got teleported some meters in the direction i was looking,  and it looks like they cant see you while you are stuck,  so they see like the void hit them
---
It could be rift challenges. The game itself is asking for basement hooks
---
High doubtful. Although I wonder if it falls under the category of exploiting a glitch.
---
Had this happen last night, same build you're talking about with iron grasp/agitation. I kept running to the far corner of the map to buy my team time to finish gens since they seemed to set their eyes on me only
---
Sounds like a fun time for all. /s
---
Yeah i play ln pc , that‚Äôs really weird that it doesn‚Äôt really work on console, hope it gets fixed soon for you
---
Had us in the first half...
---
Only makes him angrier
---
people just don't like going against legion. the first hit is basically free so no looping (which is one of the funnest parts of the game) and then they have to waste time holding m1. As a survivor that can be kinda boring.
---
This whole post is a jojo reference
---
Doesn't it require monsterous? Because I see none of them running monsterous with it.
---
I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had even close to all ten traps down tbh
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
considering theres literally challenges for hooking basement with agitation and monstrous shrine u can't really blame them lmao, its the best time to get them.
---
At least it‚Äôs not next week anymore
---
This is why I think playing both sides is valuable. Not only to become a better killer or survivor, but also to learn about unfun bugs like this.
---
With the release of Oni, Inner Strength is one of the best perks in the game. Started running it this week and haven‚Äôt looked back.
---
agreed especially if I'm trapper but then again this guy is a little sweaty 2 injured and one fresh one on the hook sounds like a good start to a manageable game
---
okay? it's still one flashlight and one offering. you will be just fine. there is barely any difference between the flashlights anyway. using a ward for a purple beam is, frankly, a silly decision
---
Thanks =D 
---
I mean you only get 4 perk slots. All perks should have an oomph to them.
---
I don‚Äôt see killers having to have 70% kill rate, to stay in the most skilled tier in the game? No. Perhaps survivors should have more stringent requirements to weed out the garbage ones. Killers should not be nerfed because they‚Äôre better.
---
How is the basement glitch not their top priority...?
---
The locker idea is amazing I love it
---
Basically make your choice but better
---
21k bloodpoints.......
---
The next shrine better offer an annoying Killer combo, like Ruin and BBQ, or a bunch of insta down shit. lol
---
Even if someone else hasn't posted it, this is a terrible title and shouldn't get stickied. We'll wait for someone less apologetic to post this info.
---
And I have 24 white wards
---
I did a basement trapper build earlier for the 5 traps thing and forgot about it until I heard crows in the basement. I kinda let them all live after that.
---
Most of these are okay but bamboozle doesn‚Äôt need a change
---
bp is not remotely difficult to get
---
Damn thats nice
---
People are probably grinding for points, rank 1 still doesn't really work without perks and such and some people probably just didn't know he came out Yesterday until they got the update.
---
so you have a fucking abundance of them? stop crying oh my god
---
!!! thank u
---
just because they did it to you doesnt make you magically not an asshole for doing it back. you couldve been above them and just ignored it, but you end up just being exactly the same as them. enjoy getting tbagged.
---
I have a new perk idea, blood sucker, it makes the survivor loose 1000 bloodpoints when they get hit
---
That's the falling out of the map part.

---
yeah but the map and key should always be a secondary means of escaping anyway, without them you can still do gens and open the gates
---
I have no idea how BHVR is justifying this taking 2 weeks to fix. Never seen a bug this game breaking bad before and that‚Äôs saying something.  Even the glitch where you could survive after the exit gates you could still MOVE.
---
it would be useless if the title wasn't vague. but since it is, I agree, the circle is useful
---
So me not wanting to spam the page and apologising in advance in case i am...is a bad thing? Huh that's new.
---
Idc, go search some music from jon rob or someone else. It's too good.
---
I still enjoy the game, but my biggest problem with it is the queue times for killer and survivor. I can be waiting more than 30 minutes to play a game. I find the game fun and enjoyable but I wish they‚Äôd take some time to fix it. Especially when the player base puts real money into the game for things such as the rift pass, characters, and cosmetics.
---
I imagine there may be bans. It is an exploit. I've been avoiding basements as killer because it feels dirty.
---
May a get an explanation? I'm new, and nemesis only seems to apply oblivious and reveal aura after getting stuned.
---
Not really
---
It's a video game my man, it ain't that serious. I have just as much fun shaking my head back at them as they are all dead with 5 gens left as they do tbagging me.
---
He didn't have double Calm + Monitor btw.
---
Did they say it's this week then ? I remember someone posted a Dev comment earlier and it said it would take a week.
---
How are these two related or have anything in common?
---
I made a post basically saying behavior learned patchwork from Microsoft. Microsoft does the same thing, makes a patch that will break their own software before 3rd party developed software. If they weren't practically a monopoly, they would probably lose all their customers.
---
Behavior, makes changes that almost had nothing to do with sounds, minus new killer sounds and next thing I know my small game doesn't go off, I can't hear if a killer is kicking a green, searching through chests, finishing a gen and probably more I haven't noticed. My second game yesterday, I experienced the basement bug and was like wtf, this is some PC issue BS right here.
---
I know programming, and I find it hard to believe the changes they made accidently broke this much functionality. Either they have really sloppy coders that have poor coding practices or they are just shoving lines into places with almost 0 testing or debugging. I also though the new patch wouldn't happen until 12/5. So 2 extra days they could have tested for this crap, but instead here buy these new characters now!
---
This is why I don't micro transact on games
---
I like playing solo queue survivor because imo it‚Äôs the most challenging. Don‚Äôt get me wrong swf are super strong but I don‚Äôt often play it but when I do we just play chill.
---
It‚Äôs just annoying how a perk makes me lose 21k bps... and I say that white wards should cover my lost item but it doesn‚Äôt and people like you get mad and Juno to the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù and the ‚Äútechnicallys‚Äù
---
You are kidding right?
---
Please delete this lmao. More survivors do NOT need to know how to explot this.
---
The first Oni I faced yesterday was doing some form of lagswitching. The ping was fine in the lobby, but in his first chase, he stopped moving for a few seconds (as if to start a download) and then we were all rubber banding everywhere and were completely defenseless. It was solo queue, but none of us DCd because we were unsure if DCing is now bannable on console.
---
I had a lot of trouble with it, then switched my loadout to bond, spine chill, BT, and assorted 4th perk (windows, I think, but that‚Äôs hardly crucial). Self-care might be a decent choice so you can be sure you‚Äôre fully healed when the time comes. Play stealthy/immersed and avoid playing survivors that tend to get tunneled (e.g. adam (bc deliverance), claudette, laurie with object, etc). 
---
And be on the lookout for farm-friendly trappers. 
---
If you‚Äôre good at looping, try and take as much heat off your teammates early on as you can. Focus gens as much as possible, etc etc.
---
you realize that requirements like this are one of the big reasons why queue times are so long and matchmaking between ranks is so fucked. drop the requirements for staying red rank for killers and balance the game out a bit towards survivors and things would be fine. this is coming from a rank 2 wraith who only has a couple hundred hours played on the game i'm calling it how i see it and the game is currently too killer centric, just my two cents

I agree, op is no better than toxic survivors when he did that
---
If the Archives want me to hook in the basement, then I'm gonna hook in the damn basement. I will avoid doing so when playing otherwise, though.
---
I did this the other day and the farmee instantly dced. I was playing leatherface, survivor A got downed and hooked not inside the basement, unhooked like 5 seconds later by survivor B before I get to walk very far, I down survivor B and put them on the same hook, I walk a bit, I turn around and see survivor C running in for the save, so I start revving my saw and walk towards the hook, down survivor B and he instantly dcs. At the end of the game survivor C says that they farmed survivor B because survivor A and C were together and "nobody touches my man". It was fair enough.
---
Let BHVR see it and decide if it should be in the game or not, it's better if there's footage of this "feature".
---
It's a bug rn, the oni can get stuck in a gen. The survivor can't see him or hear his terror radius. Happens randomly when the oni kicks a gen.
---
That's fine, still enough survivors and perks to get the unhook
---
Just flip the setup
---
Ive had killers do it to me after ive ran them around abit, i never tbag it‚Äôs unnecessary and if im going to be there awhile id much rather get bits or healing done
---
Or you could like idk pm it to a bhvr employee on reddit and not post it here for thousands to see lol
---
Nobody gets to play now.
---
Why it's a simple request, I just want the alien from The Thing. Or Doctor Satan... Or one of the devil's rejects...
---
According to the survivors rulebook, all of them apparently.
---
Shit just grind for 2k more
---
getting basement hooked
---
screen white

---
haven't faced Oni yet
---
haven't played the new map yet
---
Honestly, I'm all the way a clown and disappointing. This game straight never lets up.
---
The toxic p3 claudette that just broke haunted: manical laughter
---
Is it that bad? I haven't played as killer on this map so I wouldn't know.
---
I was just shitting my pants the whole time. He walked on me a few times and I was certain he would grab me. Got to keep my rainbow map!
---
It's very clearly *not* intended, so you posting this to the general public is doing nothing except encouraging exploits. There's no guarantee bhvr will see this post.
---
Is there a new bug??
---
Considering that nobody was banned for the Wake Up exploit, probably not.
---
&gt; ORMOND, WHICH IS A DUMPSTER FIRE MAP THAT SHOULD BE DELETED ANYWAYS.
---
FUCKING AMEN
---
Hillbilly is definitely better. He's kind of like Michael too, but in my opinion Michael is more fun to play because he's stealthy in tier 1 and 2. He may be better than Myers though. I think the Oni against people who heal or throw themselves in lockers to take him out of his power, he will be pretty underwhelming. He's quite easy to counter. And is pretty easy to juke on console.
---
Every survivor used to come with two free cosmetic sets until the release of the store. Now every survivor comes with paid cosmetics and no free ones.
---
I agree but I just want to point out that if head into wasn‚Äôt an exhaustion perk than people could use multiple times in a chase and that would be really unfun for the killer
---
This person getting triggered over a reddit title x'D
---
Which Killers ?
---
Are you ok?
---
Great comment!
---
Was it Freddy and were you asleep?
---
That‚Äôs just doctors rework
---
Can‚Äôt trust anyone out in these streetz
---
Ruin. But I understand why almost all killers run it, gen speeds are not okay.
---
If they report for hacking does it even matter lol
---
You serious? Am I about to get wooooshed
---
I‚Äôm thinking about it but usually I only play at night since I work most days so it only becomes a problem when I‚Äôm not working
---
New killer with limited perks against red ranked veterans, you're probably going to have a bad time.
---
Already adepted my yui, against an oni. Never chased or saw me all match. I unhooked survivors 3 times, did 3 gens and opened both exits. I think I saw him 2 and he walked right by me both times.
---
I really like this idea, I just wish more community ideas were listened to
---
They both have pretty sharp teeth and some nasty claws. Chewing through bone can't be THAT hard for them
---
I used to get tunneled while running Object(not surprising) but the killer would let everyone farm after killing me üíÄ
---
Not everyone knows about it, so you can't assume that people are trying to exploit it.
---
I love Pitch Black! But pitch black maps are a totally different thing
---
Thank you for your kindness :)
---
I still think this would make him pretty underwhelming.
---
First time?
---
You need to ‚Äúleave match‚Äù at the very end. Just depends if you care about deranking more than bloodpoints.
---
New doctor rework is looking lit
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt like playing against ruin either but I can tell why so many people run it so I try not to complain about it
---
It is a bad title for a sticky, because it does not tell you what the sticky is about.
---
The "less apologetic" stuff is a bit salty, though.
---
I played killer a lot just because I like the hunt feeling and actually play Legion (his new update doesn't change much to me I actually like the speed boost he got)
---
I stopped playing killer as much tho because it's getting kind of stale. 
---
I enjoy solo queue games as survivor, but recently tunneling has pushed me into playing sweaty to avoid it.
---
Killer is fun, but boring after a few hours of play and survivor is fun till 8 games of solo queue tunnel fest.
---
&gt;  AND ONE CANCELLED 30 SECONDS IN AFTER A DC
---
JUST GOING TO POINT OUT THAT TECHNICALLY IT WASN'T CANCELED AFTER THE DC; THAT DC WAS THE PERSON WHO LEFT DURING THE LOADING SCREEN. SOMETIMES IT TAKES AWHILE TO REGISTER
---
*loads glock*.

That bloodline transgression cannot be forgiven

You can only upvote this comment if you know where the images for this meme came from

Pyramid Head with James as the survivor?
---
I'm down for the Silent Hill chapter
---
Oh no it's the end of the world..
---
Balanced landing never worked with sprint burst but okay
---
I think you should still have enough time
---
Depending on your level but it would be a grind
---
as in, its bullshit gets 4 free hits and now attacks faster bc of it.
---
I think it might only be some maps, didn't get it when I was hooked in the basement of one of the MacMillan maps (don't remember which).
---
nice.
---
Gen rushing doesn't exist. Just learn to play.
---
Obsession change as well after pallet stun
---
Isn‚Äôt this the re-enactment  of the ‚Äúbring out the dead‚Äù scene from Monty python and the holy grail
---
Fengs are the new immersed claudet‚Äôs i swear
---
... as we know it ...
---
i main survivor because it's more satisfying to beat someone 1v1(which is really all i care about) if im not the power role. like when if i play killer, and i down a survivor in 30 seconds, it's just empty to me because im the power role, of course theyre gonna go down. but when i play survivor it's much more satisfying to have those chases that go on for a long time
---
Try spirit fury and enduring combo then rush EVERY pallet on the map. They are going to love it
---
Chin up, we all have bad games. Next time you play it might be a better time.
---
Lol you noob I got a sniper as a huntress
---
Did you watch the clip, or are you really just that dense? She was hooked in the basement long before I used the god pallet, and she got downed again before making it out of the basement despite me taking the protection hit.
---
Beast of Prey would be too OP. How would survivors be able to loop jungle gyms? They'd have no idea where the killer is because of the line of sight blockers. By the time they'd see the killer, it would be too late.
---
This is crossplay between the windows store and the steam store. Queue times shouldn't take that much longer. But if you want to try and re enable it, go to the settings and find the button that says "enable crossplay".
---
I got hooked, someone unhooked me and I started flailing in the air for the remainder of the game until the killer somehow struck me down and hooked me to my death. it happened in the basement. ü§∑
---
Lmao. Yeah lemme just down this survivor *2 gens pop*. Am I not supposed to chase survivors? What am I supposed to do? Run Ruin, Corrupt, Thrilling and Pop?
---
Also don't agree with Head On. The only buff it needs is a 5 second stun instead of 3 seconds.
---
Stats were released earlier in the year showing that SWF made up something like 4% of games and only had like a 48% survival rate and we still have the reddit echo chamber that SWF is unbeatable and toxic. 
---
And when stats were released yet again showing killers are not actually struggling, reddit refuses to accept that statistics mean more than their anecdotal evidence. 
---
To be fair, it's why I sort this subreddit by controversial. It's hilarious to read the arguments.
---
bamboozle always fucks me over for some reason.
---
UH ARE YOU SERIOUSLY COMPLAINING ABOUT POST-NERF PRAYER BEADS RIGHT NOW?
---
LMFAO

Done. Here's the thread:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/110032/sprint-burst-bug-lets-you-vault-a-window-run-and-keep-it/p1?new=1](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/110032/sprint-burst-bug-lets-you-vault-a-window-run-and-keep-it/p1?new=1)
---
Are you talking to steam support or some guy from BHVR. Steam usually resolves issues like this rather quickly.
---
Unless people don't play survivor or have their messaging turned off, they know.
---
I enjoyed this. Thank u
---
I will second this, even with bright cosmetics, if you stop moving in the tall grass/bamboo, it is insanely difficult to see a survivor.
---
franklins. and only franklins. the rest is entirely up to how the killer plays
---
I actually can‚Äôt see on the new map
---
I think he was using insidious because I genuinely didn't hear him near us when I started it. Then all of the sudden he runs down the stairs swinging. I got the protection hit, but then ge still managed to hit her. 
---
Not that any of that matters though, she messaged me after saying she had the basement glitch
---
well you‚Äôd have that ability anyway if you were talking to the other survivors via discord/party chat, so that should be balanced
---
Don't hide this like all the other shits are saying.  The Devs are notorious for not fixing shit unless it is flung directly in their faces.
---
Bad internet does not mean lagswitching. Imagine thinking people actually lag switch intentionally on DBD in 2019, lmfao, just like how everybody on COD has hacks, right?
---
Ruin only really works in mid to low tiers. Could use a rework IMO
---
I played Engineers Square dance music over this and I don‚Äôt regret it, especially when sped up
---
YYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
---
Not if they gave it a two minute cooldown, like the new pallet perk. And even if they were to do it in chase after two minutes, it‚Äôs unlikely the killer wouldn‚Äôt be able to get to the locker in 3 seconds before head on activates.  If the survivor was able to accomplish keeping the killer busy for two minutes and getting into a locker and having enough time for the perk to activate, then I think they either earned it - or there is a huge skill gap. Honestly, I‚Äôm not gonna chase a survivor for two minutes.
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Myers will make t-bagging at pallets much more enjoyable, in my experience. Add Bamboozle for some laughs. Sure, you won't get 4Ks, but you'll close chases beautifully and feel better.
---
&gt; Sanctum of Wrath
---
How are you sure you were being t-bagged if you couldn't even see the survivors? It was probably just a jittery bush.
---
&gt; BUT IT'S LIKE MOVING IN MUD WITH CONTROLLER. 
---
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD WAY TO PUT IT. I'M SICK OF PC PLAYERS BEING ALL "LOL GIT GUD" WHEN CONSOLE PLAYERS TALK ABOUT HOW BAD HE FEELS TO PLAY
---
*takes notes*
---
Dope as shit üëèüèΩ
---
He is built to slug, and that is considered the most scummy way to play Killer.
---
He's not OP, he's just annoyingly strong, and most games I play he has my 3 teammates as slugs for 99% of the match, leaving little room for gens to get done.
---
Don‚Äôt chase a survivor for too long bc you‚Äôre just buying the other ones more time on the gens. 
---
It‚Äôs actually counter-able just adjust your strategy and don‚Äôt fixate on one person.
---
Adrenaline &amp; Unnerving are both on characters you start out with.
---
Rancor is on a Original character you can unlock with Shards.
---
Decisive is on a Licensed character you can only unlock with cash.
---
DS&gt;Rancor&gt;&gt;&gt;Adrenaline &amp; Unnerving
---
Or when you finally experience his Obsession perk and remember what Oblivious does. Literally thought I was playing against a Ghostface at one point.
---
With the balanced landing change, it wouldn‚Äôt be too bad either. That was my only fear with making some kind of vault from up here, could have been extremely strong with old BL depending how it was set up.
---
Soon you will hear the huntress song thru out the house.
---
so you're not done crying about franklin's i take it
---
Edit: people can still just die on first hook which is the equivalent of DCing, just taking it. idk.
---
Not true. I have him and he‚Äôs fine. I think it‚Äôs unfair one side has 180 tho.
---
It‚Äôs amazing how just inverting one things makes something better.
---
Nah the ban for DCs are perfect...And weird bug this one you posted, I've never seen it, never ever, not today nor yesterday...
---
I remember December last year they promised PS4 would be fixed with a patch and then that didn‚Äôt happen, it actually made things worse, then they said they‚Äôd slowly start fixing console. They didn‚Äôt. BHVR lies all the time and whenever you complain a million reddit lurkers come out of the woodwork to bitch ‚Äúwe get it we see 5 posts a day‚Äù
---
Problem is if we don‚Äôt post literally every day it‚Äôll never get fixed. When‚Äôs the last time you heard about console performance?
---
I‚Äôm not really crying, I‚Äôm just asking a question... idk why people like you act like actual 7 year olds
---
Ik same gona take a lot of practice smh
---
If it says soon I‚Äôm guessing tommorow or the day after tomorrow
---
in my experience ppl dont care to hide in lockers when they hear his roar, thats kinda slow and boring
---
What about a perk for larger skill check success zones (gens, healing, sabo) for the expense of x2 or 3 more skill checks?
---
Penalty for missing would be x2 loss of progression maybe?
---
too bad that the overwhelming opinion is in the other direction
---
There are posts, but you can easily experience it by playing as survivor and purposefully losing a chase near the basement for experimental reasons. One tell that I always see is that if you can‚Äôt wiggle, it will likely happen.
---
With these devs, as soon as possible probably means after the new year.
---
In the 5 games I‚Äôve played today this happened twice, never had this problem before
---
Can you explain it to me?
---
Sadly they are not able to help, guess I‚Äôll have to just deal with it! Will definitely put more money into this game though when I have the chance only this time, I‚Äôll think before I buy lol
---
It did, people just didn't use it much, mostly because there weren't that many places where you could reliably activate it, plus even though it sounds somewhat scary (3 times per minute) most of the time you are in pallets and do not give a damn about sprint.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a rank 3 and it typically doesn‚Äôt effect me but it‚Äôs annoying when you get really early skill checks making it really hard to hit them
---
The basement glitch is the current worst one, but there are a few. If you get hooked in basement there is a very high chance of your screen going blank, all game sound going out, and you're character animation just falling non stop. It fixes if you can somehow get out of the basement (it fixed half way up the stairs for me the one time I was able to make it.)
---
Killers are also getting stuck in gens when kicking, but I haven't seen this yet on all of the stream I've watched, a lot of addons are broken, I know med kits and flashlights for sure are just wasting addons and not actually utilizing them.
---
I'm sure there are a bunch of other little ones, I've see a few random pictures of funny glitches, but no way to know if they're caused by this patch or not.
---
oh my god. again, the only issue i raised is item duplication which is a very real concern for the devs
---
fuck off with this victimhood shit
---
Sadly they cannot refund me. It‚Äôs alright tho thank you for the help!
---
Thank you! I appreciate it.
---
People with bad internet can start a download of a game on console to make their internet slower. We don't have dedicated servers. Stop being a sarcastic prick.
---
I mean at some point I have to commit to a person or I won‚Äôt get a down
---
It's okay, I have BT so this goes completely unpunished.
---
Same here, it must be new. Why is no one posting 100+ posts about this issue?
---
lol give me a break you literally made a post just screeching about franklins and now you made this thread for the same general purpose
---
Same here, rank 15
---
Screeching? I don‚Äôt think so
---
It's partially a problem on console. Someone posted messages on here of a Legion admitting to doing less than 2 months ago.
---
if you can quickly identify people who made similar posts earlier, maybe you should take a break from reddit
---
T3 Myers with this is terrifying.
---
Then I try to think of a way to fix that and then people say ‚Äúhow would that be coded ü§ì‚Äù
---
Idk why you are so mad
---
Iron maiden
---
I just had a game where I was guilty of this. It was a farm map with a Huntress; someone got hooked very shortly after the start and was put in the basement. They DC and the three of us struggle to do all the gens. The last one pops and someone goes down. The problem is I'm doing the challenge where I need to escape 5 times. I open the gate and pray the Huntress doesn't come my way since the gate was right next to the last gen. I left immediately.
---
&gt;they would also have to change plunderer's instinct so that it doesn't show auras of items
---
The perk only shows chest auras and gives a better chance at high quality addons, it does not show you the aura of items.
---
He really is scary with that
---
I mean biologically speaking that's not a woman, I'm just using what I'm assuming is the proffered pronoun.
---
I'm All Ears. They are so scared of my Dance With Me combo.
---
THAT GAME WAS BEFORE THE NERF. I ASSUME THE GUY JUST WANTED TO USE THEM UP BEFORE THEY STOPPED BEING AN EASY WIN.
---
Dwight is basically Cote.
---
oh yes friendo
---
This happened to me vs Trapper, the killer said he was stuck on the gen and couldn't get off until he pulled me off. I think its similar to the basement bug.
---
Everybody needs festive skins like Dwight and Clown have. Huntresses' Reindeer skull needs Christmas lights strung up in her antlers. 
---
Fuck Biker Meg. Give her like some Mrs Claus type shit. Or a matching elf costume with Dwight. JEFF needs a Santa costume.
---
Some other people would disagree and say that franklins can be used ‚Äútactically‚Äù when toolboxes and keys are the only really strong items
---
Okay, what about a constant flickering effect, kinda like Spirits passive phasing? Then with the normal conditions with bloodlust?
---
Poztre77 never seen this bug folks, we can all go home.
---
This post is art lmao
---
what's the perk that shows item auras? because a perk was recently buffed to do that. i'm fairly certain it was plunderer's unless bhvr decided to backtrack on it for some reason
---
I don‚Äôt really care btw, this guy does for some reason
---
That sounds more balanced
---
So cote cosmetic for Dwight?
---
no, it was recently buffed to show item auras. unless it's a different perk that got that buff
---
Or the perk can just get entirely reworked and get a cooler effect.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel
---
oh im not mad. i enjoy dunking on nerds
---
Never would‚Äôve expected I‚Äôm all ears tbh
---
pretty sure theres points per state heal too.
---
1) I thought he was going to stab himself.
---
2) I thought the pumpkin was going to use DS.
---
&gt; Ruin only really works in mid to low tiers.
---
i see Ruin in almost every match as survivor (ranked 4/5). If it doesn't work, why do so many killers run it?
---
still kicking gens without problems
---
...because video games are made of coding you absolute fucking idiot
---
Is there any way to counter the Oni? Haven't faced him yet
---
I won't be satisfied until I see an exact replica of Mccote in game. I'm talking suspenders, tall as fuck, voiced by Mathieu himself and everything.
---
u say that but I doubt it
---
There are multiple tome challenges that require basement hooks. 100% guarantee these ppl dont know about thr glitch
---
Congrats!!
---
u/StrengthToGoOn going to sleep at night knowing he called me a nerd üòäüò¥

it was not even 10 minutes ago and i only know because i was talking to them personally
---
nice try tho
---
The fuck have those crazy Canadians done?!
---
I realize that but it seems like if u give a solution people go to the extreme
---
i think the topic is great, to be honest. It's a discussion point and not a shitty meme, and i'm always curious to see what others say.
---
It was made that way purposely. First and foremost to prevent item duplication and secondly to have a perk to purposely negate white ward so you lost your item and an offering. It was literally designed for that purpose. Why you salty?
---
&gt; nice try tho
---
dude, the world isn't out to get you. maybe you should calm the fuck down.
---
Horse?
---
Happened a few times. Thing is if I play survivor, since BHVR have removed the visible ranks in lobbies, I play like 3 games in a row with rank 13-15 when I‚Äôm rank 7. ruins the game. Matchmaking is absolute donut fingers dipped in jam.
---
I would like to thank you for being civil, some people take some of this shit waaaay too seriously
---
Incredible Job!
---
The DC punishment is coming at the worst time.
---
With more reasons to leave due to bugs, a lot of people will be stuck wasting time, or banned.
---
Super bad timing.
---
Ah yes really realistic that the dEeP wOuNdS close itself while you are sprinting, but open when not moving. Its accurate because mending it not considered a "healing action" in DBD either. Kappa
---
Seriously BHVR wtf..
---
AH OKAY. ONE LAST RODEO I GUESS
---
Because I lost 21k bloodpoints because the killer hit me once
---
Which just increasingly contributes to how stupid of an idea this is rofl
---
Yeah. I just wanted to rant. Needed to get the anger out a bit. I just don‚Äôt know how to take it easier when playing.
---
You don't have to try bad ideas to know they are bad ideas
---
I would agree to your terms, but you forgot to hand in your paperwork
---
in what universe is that the extreme?? are you serious?
---
"how can we code this" is like the most basic aspect of changing coding 
---
oh my god
---
I actually wish survivors had something like this built in based upon who you played as.  It‚Äôs kind of boring that all survivors are the same.
---
oh i'm going to write about it in my journal
---
You can technically escape if you position your camera towards the exit and walk to where you think the stairs are. I've escaped the basement once like that, but I think its luck.
---
Lmao. Probably. But also at shack window and all. But thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have many teachables. I will keep this in mind, though
---
lol oh fuck off with this backtracking shit. you know full well what you were doing
---
I don't feel like Head On should *not* be an exhaustion perk.
---
The reason it is is that they don't want you to be able to stun the killer then immediately sprint burst/Lithe out of the gate, which would be far, far too much of a headstart on the killer. Instead of just being at a disadvantage trying to catch up to them, you'd basically make it a get-out-of-jail-free card.
---
Also, disagree with Mind Breaker, as that would just flat out remove Exhaustion perks from the game. It should affect you no matter how far along the gen is, rather than having some stupid high number.
---

I think what they did was to give you the ability to see if there are items in the chest that you see the aura off. I vaguely remember noticing something odd about the auras when I did the Plunderer's challenge.

Unless it was in the most recent patch and I missed it in the patch notes.

My hope is that BHVR is just waiting to release a new chapter featuring the 2010 Nightmare on Elm Street franchise that would include the Quentin rework, a new survivor from the movie with a map included. That is my hope.
---
This happened to me yesterday as well but only as Survivor. I‚Äôm on Xbox so maybe it‚Äôs a console thing or solely Xbox thing.
---
I already don‚Äôt like playing survivor so this makes it worst cause people think I‚Äôm purposely DCing.
---
I haven't seen one yet, but I predict it's because everyone's waiting for the DLC to be on sale during Christmas or something.
---
I love the guy that posts those remixes.
---
The waltz of Death Grips was epic.
---
Its Legion... ROFL. He's practically not even a killer.
---
Holy shit. I posted it for 20 seconds and you got all these links in 20 seconds. I'm impressed.
---
That's what the devs intended. I don't see them reworking it.
---
Pro plays
---
i love you.
---
please keep the list going. i wanna see how big it gets
---
No, it was a couple patches ago. you could actually see the item auras on the ground
---
they may have gone back on it i guess. i remember because i was weirdly excited about it
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Pog
---
If 2v8 were implemented, it'd need to be implemented right. Not saying it wouldn't work, there's just a lot to consider. With two killers, chases would be over VERY quickly (just go opposite ways around a loop and the survivor has to leave the tile). This means stealth would be the main tool for survivors. Also, double M1 hits from killers in quick succession sounds awful. Survivors would need invisibility during their speed burst to prevent double hits. I could also see situations where one killer plays "offense" while the other playing "defense", meaning once you're hooked you're pretty much dead. However, with all of this being said, it completely changes the landscape of the game. It's no longer a game of tag, it's a game of hide and seek. And for a horror game, that wouldn't be the worst idea
---
You get a white screen after being hooked on the basement.
---
I'd think because match making is still always a mess theres a good chance on being matched with lower level players who cant hit skill checks
---
That list just gets longer and longer. If people would literally just look at the fucking subreddit before posting
---
Apparently when you get unhooked your screen stays glitched, but you can move still. It's just like playing a blind survivor. I was guiding my brother out of the basement last night. You cannot go into lockers while this happens. I guided him to a locker to hide, but it wouldn't let him enter.
---
New perk idea, blood sucker, if you get hit you lose 1k bloodpoints
---
Sad Quentin Hours
---
i do like the festive sweaters but yes christmas jeff please.
---
Not only a nerf to legion but a huge buff to BT i believe. Even stronger than the old BT. Imagine the doors are open and 1 or more survivors get unhooked with BT.... killer will never catch them.
---
Not sure why construction sites would have pallets, but if it's anything like a grocery store, pallets aren't allowed to be standing up or propped up against something. They're considered unsafe. 
---
So do your fellow survivors a favor and throw down every standing pallet you see. Don't want OSHA coming in to be the next killer.
---
Wasn't there an edited version of this pic with Claudette glasses and hair on that thing?
---
Well, it is not on the wiki. But I found people talking about it on the internet when I googled it. \^\^

---
Are you on the autistic spectrum? I have to assume so after such a stupid comment lol, this is the epitome of trash killer mains who get rekt so they get an erection when they can abuse a bug. -Fellow Killer Main
---
Once yes.
---
Atem is the next killer.
---
i don't understand the frustration with ruin you have so many options
---
1. you can look for it (check where the killer is coming from at the start of the game, so many killers go check on it right away.)
---
2. you can homp the gen, slower but no skillchecks.
---
3. actually hit the skillchecks you will miss some but you'll get it done, slower but that's the point of ruin i guess.
---
Cool concept but I doubt that will ever be a thing unfortunately.
---
He means in the sense of the general slowdown, if I might elaborate:
---
Most, if not, all Red Rank Survivors, know all the totem spots and typically that's the first thing they do before going on to a gen, so Ruin can be gone almost instantly.
---
Secondly, and the most crucial part for why he said it somewhat doesn't work is because these Survivors are typically good enough to hit the great skill checks all the time and make the gen go the maximum time of 80 seconds, which is what Ruin guarantees, an 80 second generator minimum if One Surv is on it. 44 seconds if Two Survs etc. If they had normal skill checks they would blitz through them so goddamn fast the game would be over in 5 minutes, maybe less. This is only if Run stays alive however so yeah... It doesn't *really* work like it does in Lower Ranks for Red Ranks, but it's almost certainly required for the start of the game.
---
That or you load in and someone left during matchmaking
---
Except she went right through the rock after passing this trap.
---
Every time I‚Äôm half way through a match my game crashes üòî
---
Lobby simulator
---
I have a x and the game plays surprisingly well on it. Very fee issues or hiccups, so you should be fine upgrading.
---
Yea ik. It would be way more complicated because 2x map per server plus having to rework surfaces to act accordingly
---
I'm a little sympathetic - the game is explicitly rewarding basement hooks and even calling for certain basement perks. The first time it happened to one of my survivors, I assumed she'd gone AFK. Better than a DC, I supposed, but I had little reason to question it.
---
Survivors are probably more in the know, experiencing it themselves or seeing an aura persisting there. Surprisingly, you tend to have more information about your fellows than we do.
---
No DC band are not perfect because this game is broken as hell and I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for getting into bugged or horribly laggy games and wanting to play again the next match. Punishing quitters, fine whatever but punishing everyone because the game runs like shit is the dumbest crap.
---
Also it was really hard to get green perks back then, so maybe that's also was part of the reason
---
looks like someone is mad
---
It gives you nothing, you just know which locker they used after your ability runs out... And then you loop him for another 2-3 gens if he finds you.
---
Myers, Plague, Freddy and Billy that i can remember. Been trying to get the 1 safe unhook after end game collapse. Unhooked a survivor 3 feet from billy but she still went down for some reason.

Thataphobia, dying light, and ruin together.

If I see a teammate gen-tapping, I'm probably gonna just DC and move on to the next game. It's so slow, and won't help you get better at the game
---
He lost me at the carton flip
---
They don;t but they can. Also even if they don't getting anyone who knows what he's doing on a jungle gym with his ability is kinda imposible.
---
I cant really say as I only been trying to get the adept achievement with him. But I can say he's rough without ruin. Then again every killer is.
---
No, im just saying for trash killers its literally free real estate. EZ 2 monsterious shrine kills
---
Idk how I'm always in the opposite.
---
The day oni came out, I was probably the only one in killer lobbies, because I was into game inside 4 seconds. And consistently too. No issues, no waiting, full ready lobbies waiting foe me. 
---
As survivor, it takes 20 minutes or longer. And my team is always quitting in 1 hook.
---
that's a good way to put it. i can definitely understand that. 
---
of course, with everyone running ruin, it just makes me practice hitting the great skill check, and i'd be willing to bet i'm not the only one.
---
YES! One of my biggest inspirations is [BRUSH](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRqcPtAY2IrOjjOPt2TbYVQ/videos), his videos gave me the idea to try a cutesy style for dbd characters!

I know where the images are from but I‚Äôm not going to upvote your comment because I feel like it.

Umm... is that not what it means?  I‚Äôm pretty new.
---
Me yesterday... Except I watched the Wraith farming with Fing and letting her do gens. I was the only other survivor left but once she crossed by me, he wouldn't stop. I broke out twice, looped him, and he put me on hook. 
---
I had choice words to share with that.
---
Could you not have cropped the meme?
---
This is a shit post right ?
---
Dunkmaster Huntress/Demogorgon when?
---
Iron Maiden gives you nothing? Lmao an exposef status and survivor aura are tots nothing, I forgot. 
---
It makes it so the survivors are iffy about going into lockers. If youre constantly gping up against survivors who counter oni with lockers, like you said in your post then Iron Maiden would be a soft counter to that.
---
Only gone against him so far, and he's pretty fun to go against.
---
Still think Lucky Break/No Mither should counter his ability though. If I'm not bleeding, I shouldn't be leaving blood drops on the floor for him to track me by.
---
Just give me wolfman and ill be happy
---
It basically means that you can be one hit instead of two
---
Let's be clear: noone is going to be able to give you exact recepie how to "git gud" in a Reddit post. Watch a YouTuber who comments on his action and learn. Try Fungoose.
---
Fair enough. Either way, it was just an example to show that most perks that aren‚Äôt meta need a buff or something that will make you go ‚Äúdamn, I don‚Äôt know what perks I wanna use‚Äù other than top 6-7 on each side.
---
It would make for a lot more varied play styles.
---
I just miss seeing new perks from new chapters that actually are exciting, most peoples reactions to them (myself included) are ‚ÄúOh look, another perk I‚Äôll never use‚Äù
---
Whenever the sub gets spammed we can always count on you
---
thats because the killer is the power roll, in a 4v1 of absolute shitters, the killer gets a 4k every time unless his mouse is unplugged. Survivors can't kill a killer, killers can kill survivors. If they cant do ruin then they just lose.
---
At least it wasn't *too* hard for you.
---
Really? For me ill wait 30 sec for survivor lobby and like 10 minutes for killer
---
bc most players suck. Killer is easier at the start, unless you are playing spirit then she is easy no matter what.
---
Exactly it's like... A blessing and a curse to run Ruin. Does it slow the game down (just a lil bit?) Yes! By making gens a minimum speed (baseline ofc) but when you go against that one Killer who isn't using Ruin? Oh boi... Good Luck winning that Killer! We're conditioned for the great skill checks so we're gonna blitz through them!ü§£

as of the patch no additional charge addons work bud.

Good
---
...well it depends on what kind of survivors, are all newbies? Are they red rank? Or is it a mix? It all depends on the other players
---
How is Oni like Myers in any way? Myers is a jumpscare stalky boy, Oni is a in-your-face smashy boy
---
filament seems to work
---
Why run NOED on Huntress? she is probably the worst person to run NOED on.
---
There would probably be at least 4 or 5 gens remaining instead of 3 tho
---
Oh my god I saw it, thank you so much!!   
---
I hope she likes it &lt;3
---
Myers has to get his instadown. He doesn't start with it. Just like Oni.
---
I'm a survivor main on PS4 and yes killer is harder to play.
---
SMBC is saterday morning breakfast cereal. It's a webcomic with and eclectic selections of comics. Quite a bit of subject overlap with xkcd but  not really the same.
---
Try playing survivor at rank 1 then go play killer at rank 1 and youll understand.
---
Whatever floats your boat
---
Only two are really 'new' skins, the rest are recolors. So, you know. Quality over quantity.
---
Understandable, I love using this as killer though
---
Extremely entertaining
---
Yeah it‚Äôs horrible in my opinion. The map is very dark to start with, it‚Äôs also 90% long grass that‚Äôs so easy to hide in. 
---
I enjoy playing survivor on this map but the long grass, although very good for hiding does rustle quite a lot, so that‚Äôs one thing to bare in mind for killer. 
---
That‚Äôs hilarious, I almost managed the same to a Hag on the other Yamaoka estate but she found me üòí
---
Also the first guys went down really really fast, we been against green killer tho.
---
AgentPineapple is probably talking about the online comic "Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal."
---
An username like that playing huntress? I approve
---
&gt; There seems to be a lot of confusion in this thread
---
&gt; When he refused to hook the last downed player and forced everyone in the game *to wait until the end of end game collapse*, that is taking the game hostage
---
I actually think its vice versa  let see as a survivor you have
---
*latency/bug/glitches/possible toxic teammates who may be also bad if your solo queing and toxic killer 
---
 killer u just have toxic meta survivors from time to time but it's mostly laid back Imo and winning is not the object it's about fun and survivor is without a doubt just unfunny as hell for me
---
Yeah, you‚Äôd think this map would be perfect for trapper but it‚Äôs so DARK you can‚Äôt see anything.
---
Thing is, you say gen rush isn‚Äôt real. I know its the survivors objective, but that doesn‚Äôt make it fun. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist. Because if 3 gens pop within 2 minutes, what are you supposed to do?
---
Was maybe level 25, my other options probably included deer stalker and monsterous shrine. Build was not my first choice but the best i could do at the time.
---
I mean... considering they aren't even active yet, how could they?
---
There is a reason why we have the perks in the state theyre now. The Devs know what they have to avoid in order for one perk to dominate the game. Look at the old Decisive Strike for example. Thatll never happen lol
---
This reminds me of what it was like during my divorce... :P
---
And yeah, I know. I just wanted to rant. I know every killer has bad games, or even bad days.
---
oh yeah I've heard a lot of complaints about that from this map but hey who know bring in the right add ons and make hell happen
---
This has the same vibes as those fake slender man pictures that are really low quality and b &amp; w
---
Not for this to be an r/untrustworthypoptarts or anything but I literally got bbq and chili on the first bloodweb as well for oni
---
Oni: Hey guys, I‚Äôm-
---
Entity: Better not fuck up...
---
Yeah will have to try out different ones to see what works

---
It unfortunately got reported on Xbox a month ago and I had to change it :/ Had the GT for almost 5 years and someone butthurt in DBD reported my name, I guess it was too inappropriate for Xbox.
---
Seems kinda toxic.....ranking up has nothing to do with how your team performs....o.o
---
Well I will gladly suck your toes uwu
---
The basement hooks are laced with LSD
---
How easy do you think it is to fix bugs? Tell me
---
Borrowed time should be by default
---
I thought they were, my bad, explains a lot. And as you can see I was pretty mad about it lol
---
I can only upvote this once
---
Your arguement can literally be used the same for Billy.
---
anyone's better than breezy bruh come on
---
It starts on the 5th. I can imagine people are being even more of a dc prick than usual because of that.
---
This happened to me once as I was playing as Mikey except they were a bunch of Neas. 
---
I generally try to get everyone on the hook at least once before finishing them but turns out I accidentally tunnelled one of them for half the match then the others just kinda have up and kept running towards me. 
---
It was amusing but oh so confusing.
---
Not just that, but texture would be a problem to implement. Don't get me wrong, I have faith that demogorgon could have been made like that if the time was taken, but overall I feel it would be too much on the devs hands to handle given their roadmap.
---
Idk if you genuinely dont know how much of problem Legion was or just havent gone up against annyoing legions
---
How do these perk help you end chases?
---
Bc survivors become super toxic when they realize they‚Äôre better the the killer that people just bought and have played a total of 10 min and have 1 perk on them so instead of playing a normal game they tea bag and flashlight clock and don‚Äôt do the last gen to be as toxic as possible
---
I like it
---
I mean technically gameplay wise Freddy can‚Äôt slow down people far away from him unless they blindly run into a puddle you placed earlier, and clown doesn‚Äôt have to hit people or wait for them to fall asleep.
---
But yeah, in 95% of your gameplay Freddy is just outright better in every way.
---
If only survivors knew that I only let people go based on how cute their outfits are.
---
And I go easy on Jane by default.
---
I've often said that I think there should be a solid four man team. A gen jockey, a looper (or two) and someone to heal and get off hooks and help on gens.
---
And I feel fine
---
Well, you may say so, but when was the last time you actually saw somebody actually use this perk in a chase?
---
THIs legitamently happened to me, I was 1 Day away from the Chapter I had 1000 auric but then my gold runs out)(I play dbd with gold too so.)
---
Hm. Freddy and Myers can avoid triggering Borrowed time. (Myers only in T1)
---
Maybe they were using perks like the new Nemesis or Insidious to disable their terror radius.
---
But since this is BHVR we are talking about it is probably a bug.
---
Imo it‚Äôs making the game stale and boring. Making perks virtually useless isn‚Äôt helping the game. People are still crying about nerfed decisive being OP. I never said it would happen, and that‚Äôs a shame. 
---
People whine too much on both sides tbh
---
&gt; Even the lowest tier killer has kill rates above 50%
---
You're referring to the most recent data BHVR put out, yes? I wouldn't do that if I were you considering it's no good for making statements on game balance because not a single variable relevant to that analysis was controlled for.
---
BHVR didn't control for issues like early leavers that force the game into a fundamentally unbalanced state - something like that does not mean the game is killer sided or that killer is easier. 
---
It doesn't control for 1 kill games that becomes 4 kill games because the survivors who could have escaped decided to go on a suicide mission for that last survivor. You can't use a situation like that in data to make the conclusion you have.
---
And there are a lot of issues like this.
---
Gen tapping with 3 ppl is faster than normal progress with ruin with 3 ppl.
---
She is very rare to go against indeed. Nearly as rare as Nurse for some reason
---
It‚Äôs not an aura unfortunately
---
I do know how annoying he was, but gutting him to be unplayable wasnt the way to do it. Also I do know the problem I main him and got to rank 1 from that.
---
Deathgarden is that you?
---
dont act like you didn't almost DS your self
---
How exactly did that get communicated in the game? "hey help me find this other guy and I'll let you go" why would't he just kill that guy and let you go? Since you know....that guy was already found.
---
Yeah I was just informed its not out yet, ooops lol, either way though I feel the same about it. But yeah you‚Äôre right they probably are in over drive.
---
That's actually a game mode in Deathgarden and i honestly hated it.
---
Also his perk Nemesis makes him like tier 1 Myers.
---
Gen rushing exist. its just not toxic.
---
I play nothing but Oni. If you're sitting around rank 5 you should see me eventually. Unless I depip again trying to get that godforsaken adept trophy.
---
I wouldnt say he unplayable, just have to adapt to his rework. I went up against a legion yesterday (he was rank 4) and he did fairly well; he got a 3k.
---
funny how all SWF say that.
---
This image screams KILL BILL Part 3
---
Managed to trap three survivors up there by placing a trap at the top, best feeling ever.
---
Did you really search up dead by daylight memes AND not crop it AND put the whole meme in the title
---
people payed for the game so unless they give something else to those players it wont be added or it will create a shitstorm
---
I just uninstalled and was reinstalling when I read this, feelsbadman.
---
must be the hours you play the game, I play from 12am to 6am est and I see all kinds of assholes.
---
as long as i can throw my downed friends at the killer im down
---
thanks!
---
"Borrowed time (/etc. Other perks):
---
While within 12/16/20 meters of a hooked survivor, you appear with a yellow aura (green with kindred) while within line of sight.
---
Wouldn't be too good, but helpful.
---
Right, killers are also aware of the glitch and I‚Äôve noticed that repeatedly killer are running agitation and iron grasp
---
I don't care if pc players have a advantage over console players. I just want faster matchmaking
---
This is gorgeous! Take my upvote
---
Those poor survivors
---
Idk I might just be jumping to conclusions. I got a 3 man yesterday and today I was on the farm map and got a 1 man. But his whole rework fucked with me because his attacks dont apply STBFL or sloppy anymore and that became a problem as I had one of those perks and it essentially made it useless.
---
Filament doesnt add charges, it reduces the amount of charges used. Difference.
---
My Oni has the same outfit. Best combo currently imo.
---
Oh my bad. It's the location of the locker revealed, not the aura. I coulda swore it was the aura unless they changed it? Or im misrememebering
---
Oh ah! Thanks for letting me know. Newer to DBD so didn't know that was a falling out of the map glitch
---
I am just venting frustrations, I know there are options. In the first place I shamelessly run ruin in most of my killer builds and I expect  ruin in every game I am survivor.
---
That's what I dislike, that in game with so many perks and combinations, this one is always the "go to" choice. Because why wouldn't it be, it's conditional, but very powerful perk.
---
80% of my games as survivors are against ruin and if I do not run ruin myself at red ranks, I am in for a sweaty game.
---
Idk you tell me. Made a simple mistake :)
---
What did you do in those 2 minutes? How many people did you hook in that time?
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre understanding the definition of an infinite.
---
Console doesn't have aim acceleration. That's honestly the biggest problem. I play on both console and PC, and besides all of the optimization problems, there is definitely a noticeable difference. If there wasn't, the nurse would stomp on console. And she doesn't.
---
Both batteries and filament are supposed to increase duration ao kinda same thing
---
Man from being found in a locker to the ticklemoster mori. 
---
F in chat.
---
That's why you gotta read the rework notes and nake sure you dont take useless perks into trail lol
---
It gives the killer extra time to chase because gen speed
---
soooooo annoying
---
Not gonna lie, I always put an Adam on the hook first
---
Lmao you say perks are virtually useless?? Ok try getting Merciless Killer with no perks against rank 1 survivors with all meta perks, lemme know how useless perks are then lmao
---
As someone who plays both, I‚Äôd say in terms of easiness it‚Äôs about equal for killer and survivor because the killer has the whole map to pressure and when someone is hooked they have two objectives to defend, the hook and the gens. Survivors, when someone is hooked, also have two objectives, the unhook and the gen. The killer can‚Äôt be in two places at once (apart from hag I guess), so survivors do have good odds throughout the majority of the match. 
---
However in terms of earning blood points and ranking it‚Äôs much easier to do as killer because you can‚Äôt get taken out of the game early by anyone.
---
The adept achievement for killer is just garbage in general. Got a 4k but didn't double pip? No trophy for you. Someone DCs on their first down? Nope. Try again. Its such a damn pain.
---
Yup, because as Clown you can throw a bottle, and they just run. Freddy‚Äôs snares keep a loop unsafe.
---
Clown is only fun to play with Pinky Finger
---
true i do not play killer alot myself so i understand it's a must or you just get genrushed in 5 min by an swf and i suppose i'm so used to having to deal with ruin every game i don't even bother anymore.
---
That context makes no sense. 
---
I said MOST PERKS OTHER THAN THE META ARE USELESS.
---
Learn to read.
---
I want a game mode with all members of legion at once against a fuck ton of survivors
---
That's pretty extreme lol. Just put on plunderers and ace in the hole and find your good shit. Escape and unequip your item. Do this until you have a stockpile of purple items. That's what I do.
---
your thicc my dude
---
I want Freddy in a Pin stripe Mafia outfit
---
Look at how they've massacred my boy...
---
Yes, killer is more difficult to play.
---
Unfortunately, many many many people abused the Wake Up and Sprint Burst exploits and were not banned. 
---
Because of this, they cannot ban for this bug. Additionally, they have no way to tell who knew and who did not know.
---
It'll never work
---
r/dbdgonegay vibes
---
"Making perks virtually useless isnt helping the game" lmao I did read you fucking goon. You didnt say anything about meta perks in your last comment, to which I was replying to. Not my fault, nor is it my problem if you cant understand basic reading comprehension lmao
---
This has gotta be a shitpost
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt have my ace level 40 yet and My feng would probably be P3 level 100ish
---
Honestly I did it with Spine Chill, Left Behind and Distortion with a key. Just hung around cleansing totems, hiding in lockers and only going for very safe hooks saves until everyone was dead. Then jumped through the hatch after the Killer closed it.
---
Easiest way to get it done is be in full swfs hope the killer isn't good and tell your 3 friends to do gens while you just hide around till all the gens are done.
---
https://youtu.be/XF5cyi4NPLs?t=435
---
Dude gave me hatch when I was playing Jane once &amp; messaged me this exact thing after lol
---
When the fact he didnt crop the meme Is funnier then the actual meme itself
---
nope, ruin and the whole gen mechanics should be reworked.  As survivor a game takes 3 min to get out without ruin, its so simple and killer can do nothing about it.
---
As a killer its a "must have" or core perk (however you call it) otherwise you may be gen rushed so answer is simple. Nothing personal cuz i can still do 4k without it due to #EveryoneCanBeRank1 but gl against SWF or sth
---
Nothing personal and actually i didnt give a shit about it in the game. Still perk definies the game which shouldnt be a thing.
---
For me its any time I run deliverance, doesn't matter character.
---
[The wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Benevolent) is pretty great for questions like this.
---
&gt; 10 points: awarded for healing another Survivor (partial progress awards partial points) 
---
So you get half a point for those last 5%, probably rounded up to 1.
---
20 points are needed per emblem "stage". You start with 35 points and lose 10 per hooked survivor which get refunded when they get unhooked.
---
If you want to farm the Emblen, unhooking survivors savely and then healing them 1 state will net you 30 points. Do that 2 times and you got an Iridescent unless people,^(( do it 3 times and you can let the rest die on hook and still keep Iridescent. \^\^))
---
I mean... I don‚Äôt know about ‚Äòdon‚Äôt know how to aim‚Äô but PC definitely has an advantage over console so i wouldn‚Äôt be jumping for joy if crossplay was a thing.
---
On console you should max everything
---
I apologise, I misinterpreted this post.
---
The vertical sensitivity is too high, and I believe that this is a known issue in the patch notes.
---
Spine chill is a good perk to run for this. I‚Äôm not saying you have to play immersive, but just kind of really keep your guard up. I know sometimes there‚Äôs super unlucky moments but you‚Äôll get it
---
Red rank killer is 100% harder to play and win than red rank survivor
---
I just spent my entire last trial blinded and unable to swing. I'm loving the Oni but these bugs are unacceptable.
---
Ok thank you for letting me know
---
Eerie and creepy. Well done!
---
I wish these changes could happen (well most of them) but unfortunately knowing this community it ain't gonna happen anytime soon, but good job anyways
---
except its completely different. Adding 2+2 is not the same as 2/.5 in game coding
---
Every fucking time
---
Mate. You blatantly stole this. You didn't even try.
---
I only do it if I actively see someone running up to the hook. It‚Äôs not a camping signal, just signaling it‚Äôs not safe yet.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for it to be implemented. So sick of people DC‚Äôing is they get downed once or even on the hook for the first time. If you‚Äôre one of them and you‚Äôre reading this , fuck yourself.
---
Sorry for keeping you waiting guys ...
---
I just need to work on few things before release it !
---
I promise that i will release it **REALLY** soon with the Kate Update &lt;3

---
MYC is really tough unless you're using a killer like Wraith or Spirit or Freddy or Demo, someone who can traverse the map quickly before the rescuer has time to hide.
---
Depends entirely what killer it is. But for myers, after tiering up, maybe a gen has popped. Then when I down someone, even if it was a fairly short chase, another one pops. And also working on getting tier 3. Maybe Michael isn‚Äôt the best for me. I enjoy playing him a lot. But being against full sweat lords with like prove thyself and all toolboxes, there‚Äôs only so much I can do. I‚Äôm going to sleep now because my sleep misses me and I miss it
---
Getting out of the basement isn't a guaranteed fix. I guided a friend up in dying state and he was still blind all the way at the top. Only solution that seems to work 100% is the killer picking you up...which usually doesn't matter since they just hook you again anyway.
---
Ok mr Yale
---
Exactly. When I play killer (im rank 1) I have to put in all my mental energy and focus. When plahing survivor (im rank 4) I usually have a podcast playing in the background and still escape most of the time
---
I think it‚Äôs because nurse is hard on console.
---
OPs talking about the challenge where you have to escape with spine chill though
---
You think time is only used for chases? It also gives extra time for everything else killer does, like tracking that immersed p3 Blendette. Or even simply helping to create a more relaxed no sweat game.
---
Dude Jane is just. I love her. If I came across a SWF of 4 Jane's its gonna be a farming game. People are always talking about Baby Dweet and I'm sitting here crushing on Jane.
---
Well yeah that's why nobody plays as her, I mean I wonder why Hag is played so little. She isn't even bad or as hard
---
You could tie two maps together using an extra exit gate spawn.  A gate spawns already powered/open to link two maps: killers are guaranteed to spawn on opposite sides.
---
There would be interesting gameplay opportunities in how to handle ‚Äúguarding‚Äù the open gate.  It‚Äôs not possible to do all required gens with just one map, so killers and survivors have to focus attention on both sides.
---
I already want to scream.
---
The heck is a quentin main?
---
You must actually be slow if you think knowing simple math operations is university level knowledge
---
Not everybody sits on Reddit for the latest news. I didnt know about it until I myself got banished to the shadow realm just this morning.
---
Chases would be impossible lol, but it'd be super fun. Maybe the two killers are divided into two sides of the map and have stay on that side, or it could be like a tag-team thing. With a ton of players the maps would probably have to be way bigger too.
---
Gg piece of shit
---
The game and SWF is balanced, you just need to git gud and stop complaing about red ranks in your purple/green ranks /s
---
Oh gotcha. Yeah I agree I definitely wish I saw more hag. She‚Äôs fun to go against.
---
Low key overlooking how they still got the last mid-chapter patch out before Halloween and fixed the Tome Lvl 3 on Monday.
---
It means instead of having to hit you twice the killer can just down you instantly. You'll mainly see it against Ghostface and Myers.
---
thanks :)
---
That's how you farm though
---
Yes KWF vs SWF let's go
---
Still worth a shot if you're saving in the basement. Either that or you lose a teammate for the entire game.
---
1 week is way to much for just 1 dc maybe a 8h for the first dc, 24h for the second,48 and then a week lol
---
She's a baby Nancy, hiding in a locker with Inner Strength. XD
---
First time it happened, my character paused right before throwing a pallet down (conveniently above the killer basement), the killer hadn‚Äôt even turned yet and there was another survivor as well so I assume I lagged out or in and soon I was exposed and knocked when the game finally unfroze and as soon as I was  hooked, the screen turned a pastel fog green and I couldn‚Äôt see anything. I still went through the hook phase as well and even struggled a bit but I just left.
---
The second time (this time) I wasn‚Äôt lagging at all but as soon as I got hooked, this appeared and I just DCed. I also struggled a bit this time too hopeful that it‚Äôd just go away but no.
---
First time was against Myers and the second against the Clown.
---
Thinking about it now, this only happened in the killer basement, I usually never get hooked as I‚Äôm terrible in chases so I remain hidden or I try so I‚Äôm not an easy down.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/108882/release-information-3-4-0 bottom of this page. Although they did say testing begins then. So it might not be on all platforms.
---
Wut. Why not just  look at auric prices yourself?
---
FYI that's like 30 bucks work of cells. Either the 20+10 packs or I think there is like a 35 dollar pack?
---
I did in my main post, you dolt. Use context clues. All my posts are built upon my main post.  ‚ÄúMaking perks virtually useless isn‚Äôt helping the game‚Äù isn‚Äôt referring to all perks. Otherwise I would have said  ‚ÄúMaking ALL perks virtually useless isn‚Äôt helping the game‚Äù 
---
Again, context clues. I was referring to major nerfs that perks receive regularly. Nowhere did I say that all perks are useless. And as I said before, this entire post is EXCLUDING META PERKS.
---
So come back when you actually have basic reading comprehension.
---
No they literally just thought I was a really bad killer. I got a message afterwards about how easy it was and that I shouldn‚Äôt play killer üò¨üòÇ
---
the other night i gave the survivor that was nearly impossible for me to catch the hatch. dude left without even saying gg when i was about to compliment him. for the rest of the day i pink mori'd every survivor. i felt bad afterwards but i was butt hurt and wanted to remind every survivor what i could do if i wanted to
---
 just do the kyf multiple killer glitch
---
Please no.
---
Yea. You dont even really need to play at rank 1 to understand. Watch any streamer whos at rank 1 and if they play killer their usual super focused and dont look at chat during the game but look at some rank 1 survivor streamers and theyre all laughing, listening to music, shooting the shit with chat. Its all completely observable.
---
The challenge OP is talking about is to escape with spine chill though
---
I know how batteries vs filaments work. Thats not what im here to discuss. I just told they have similar effects ingame although the work progress is different
---
I'm survivor rank 6 and still find that killer is easier to play than coordinate a team of other purple ranks.
---
I do know what infinite means, but just take a moment to think of how much time you waste to that one loop in comparison to many others.
---
Nice ad hominem. But console players are just going to play like bots. Gonna make the game boring.
---
Well put
---
I'd say 7, with the time needed to repair them being increased, and there's 10 generators on the map.
---
I wont even talk about it. Ive only played killer while i did something else so actually i didnt feel queues time but its a joke as well.  
---
Game is not enjoyable at rank1 thats a thing. Till you learn the game and people dont abuse mechanics, exploits, bugs its fun. On rank 1 where killers use a lot of bugs, survivors are sorted for those who can play and for those who can use urban evasion. A lot of people disconnects, troll others, farm, yea. A lot of top tier players dont play solo for current state because its just unplayable. Most of them dont play till they have someone else to team up or rather to farm as a killer
---
There should be an option to kick a rescuer off.
---
Fucking decisive strike needs a fucking huge buff ive never gotten it work for me such a useless stupid perk
---
Ara ara~
---
i only give the hatch to the last person IF i noticed how well they did(usually happens if you loop me so bad i give up chasing you)
---
Be careful with this. You dunno if they're dealing with a skillcheck so it could cause you to scream instead.
---
Learning young. A good start
---
sry urban evasion god
---
Wait until she gets older and teabags you at every opportunity
---
Just yell BA BA BA BA as they get closer
---
I gotcha there but when they do it as soon as the hooking animation is done I'm like really give me at least 5 seconds to start walking away.
---
good to know, but im talking about situations where the killer already sees us and he won't let me run so i get downed cuz i was still injured
---
and the textures are not proper, hit streamers so you will know ;)
---
I know, most seem to just want to nerf anything that annoys them.
---
And this is what‚Äôs killing the game.
---
He‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve had in DBD and he‚Äôll likely be my main. He‚Äôs difficult to play but very rewarding.
---
wrong meme format
---
So good.
---
same way you did it before
---
I really wish console had this. Of all the ones I‚Äôve seen, this is the one I would use
---
Ngl I do the same thing as him if someone references Scream with their username
---
Why have memes got so progressively bad over the years? To the point that I could show Joaquin Phoenix‚Äôs joker this and he wouldn‚Äôt laugh. And mans got a laughing condition.
---
Abandoned AF
---
Rank 1 survivor. Yes killer is 'harder' in that it is much more stressful. You can fuck off and sit on a gen or hide if you start having a bad game as survivor. You can die on hook and move on if you find yourself against bullshit you don't want to play against. Killer doesn't get these luxuries. You face who you face or you dc. You have a bad game with toxic shits? You camp and give up or you DC
---
what a beautiful story
---
they don;t have similar affects. Extending the duration is different from adding duration
---
Oh yeah, that's really shitty to be in.
---
Just allow any hook to give credit until they fix the bug then. Making the game unplayable for other players is not a good compromise for your quest progression.
---
You are my hero. Keep it going
---
I fucking hate that change.
---
$5 gets 500, $10 gets 1,100, $20 gets 2,250, $35 gets 4,025... There are other, more expensive packs also.
---
But, again, why post this? When you go get your auric cells, you'll see this same information I woukd say about $25-$30 would get you there.
---
there are a lot.of unspoken ways to communicate in dbd. a survivor dropping his item at your feet, booping pigs snoot, pointing at lockers, etc
---
They are not the same but u cant say they are not similar
---
I'm all for a week ban, so long as the game can differentiate between a bruised ego DC and a "host lost" disconnect.
---
If someone starts unhooking, stops, and then unhooks you, doesn't it fix it? That's what I've been doing and it seems to work from what I can tell.
---
If only there was an in game menu that told us this info
---
Yeah, and they would have a little less than half those cells to spend on something else
---
Oh you mean in your edit that wasnt there a couple of minutes ago lmao you're a joke, buddy. the only place you mention meta perks are you in fucking edit lmao and yes, i know for fact when you said that you were implying that all perks are virtually useless.
---
Try Franclins if you see more than 2 toolboxes. Use Discordance if suspect SWF. Keep track of gen progress as you run through map. If gen progresses faster than other and you suspect multiple people doing it, stop everything else and look around as they will want to finish it. Drop chase if it takes you too far from where most worked on gens are.
---
Holy shit, this is amazing.
---
I am being a little optimistic, yeah.
---
Decisive strike can fix it from what I‚Äôve noticed. When you get unhooked, you‚Äôre in falling animation.
---
He was already nerfed in multiple ways. I do not agree.
---
In what ways was he nerfed?
---
Yes, it's boring facing bots. And that's what console players will be.
---
They might not despawn, but he still has to be near them to collect them. He literally came out yesterday, he doesn't need to be nerfed already.
---
I didn't buy the game to face up against bots.
---
Okay yeah but kid with knife?
---
-BHVR
---
I feel like the brightness should go down a little bit on the sky and background it would be beautiful and really bring it together
---
Honestly I'm fine with it taking a week to fix the bug as long as they issue a statement intending to penalize killers who abuse it and then enforcing it relentlessly. Make the challenges involving basement hooks work for any hook in the meantime.
---
This won't change shit.
---
The only reason matchmaking is slow is because the servers suck.

maybe I'm weird, but i go even harder if 2 people dc cuz i want to let them get into another game faster. this game isn't fun for any of us so might as well end it asap

He‚Äôs just an m1 killer that can run fast sometimes.
---
Identity V is not a clone. It shares the same basic mechanics, but seeing as BHVR helped Netease with it, that is not surprising. Identity V has characters that aren't just skins of each other (so no two characters are alike), there is something called a "Terror Shock" (Basically, if a survivor takes damage while they're interacting with anything, except pallets, they go down, even if they weren't injured), and an entirely different mode that is basically a free for all.
---
You keep our games looking pristine. :) Thanks for what you do and take your time.

Bill is, quite simply, an exception to that rule. He never had any cosmetics other than his base and prestige before the sweater.

Ya got me there, I just thought the beginning sequence was amusing enough.

Hey you‚Äôre right it probably is too much but I‚Äôd be okay with it as someone who doesn‚Äôt DC.

---
100% agree
---
Gimme a full doggo pic. Love the topper to tho.
---
Ace and Ash have probably the worst ones
---
Slow the Yuletide down, just a little bit.
---
Despawning would create it's own problems as then he becomes a much more reliable tracker/hard tunneler.
---
Im sure it's really hard but when every major patch fucks multiple aspects of the game, some of which break the game like the basement bug right now it becomes so tiring.
---
Its actually funny cause a surv also DC‚Äôd in that game when they got downed a second time. Yet the three of us left pretty much escaped and the killer then DC‚Äôd, those two should be friends lol
---
Did you not read the patch notes? He didn‚Äôt receive any super heavy nerfs but they are there 100%
---
Wow, someone was finally the change they wanted to see in the world
---
I laughed, good job on it!
---
Ace lmao 
---
His only good perk is the chest one, and even then it‚Äôs still very bad
---
I legit dont wanna play SWF with people because everyone rages in vc.   
---
Oni is kinda strong but he's not really OP. Even then like you said it will take time to know for sure. Clown was thought to be strong on release for instance so it all depends.
---
*Slippery meat* - I am so sorry
---
Watching zubatLEL play Oni versus watching myself play Oni
---
Pallet break speed drastically slowed, flick rotation slowed, cooldown during dash increased, lose 25% of your power on downing a survivor, etc.
---
You‚Äôre an idiot. I was not implying that all perks are useless. Why the fuck would I do that? Obviously meta perks aren‚Äôt useless. I said in my original posts that it didn‚Äôt involve the meta. You are the one who‚Äôs dumbass enough to believe that‚Äôs what I meant. The only edits I made was to clarify what the topic was about LONG before you first replied. And a couple edits to make shit easier for your dumbass to understand.
---
Hey you take that back!
---
What rank are you? He's one of the most viable killers. Even at red ranks.
---
Forgot shitpost flair
---
Perk: Sinking Ship
---
If unhooked in the killers terror radius, and hits will effect the other survivor for 3/5/7 seconds after unhook.
---
Make this happen dbd team. Low ranks will thank you.
---
They always blam the devs for all of the problems, but most of them are this dam community's fault, they will never understand that, and they will kill this game, then another and another, it never ends. Ironic

How do you type it wrong after doing it correctly in the previous sentence
---
What are you talking about he's a top tier killer?
---
Monsters Inc crossover?
---
I'd also have to go with Ash on this one. All his perks are weak. Mettle of Man used to be good until they nerfed it to the ground though.
---
Nothing I typed is typed wrong.
---
If only they buffed luck to matter he could have a top tier perk possibly üòî
---
‚ÄúI would of gone around‚Äù
---
I feel like I get a lot of Pig's daily challenge to dash-hit 4 survivors so I play her quite a bit. And I tend to get 4Ks more often than not. She's fun.
---
Your incompetence is not other people's problem.
---
I'm not done hanging out with my killer frieeeeeend yet!
---
IT GAVE ME THE CREEPS !!! Myers scares me so bad since forever lmao
---
Like I said, nothing I typed was typed wrong.
---
It‚Äôs would have, not ‚Äúwould of‚Äù
---
And it's tireing on both end, they don't want these bugs but you can't make it perfect, they are trying, the bugs annoy me too but they are trying at least
---
I wont, nor cant, because you're right.
---
You can lose every game and still reach purples and red, it's dumb.
---
So true. It's especially annoying when a killer is a few ranks lower and doesn't use all meta perks. I'm like "You are calling rank 10 killer who lost against mostly rank 5 team Trash? Wow, what a fucking genius, you just figured out that rank 10 is weaker than rank 5. How about learning a new math skill of comparing two numbers less than 20 each and understanding the obvious conclusion? I hope you are matched with people at least 5 ranks higher than you for the rest of your life and they all make sure that you know what trash you are."
---
What all tbaggers deserve
---
The devs could handle things a bit better, but yeah, it‚Äôs mostly the community ruining the game. The devs just do what they can to keep them from crying for a little bit.
---
How did they nerf Legion? I think his Feral Frenzy and window/pallet vaulting speeds were increased on the new update?
---
But I'll admit I haven't faced a Legion in some time.
---
Poor legion...
---
Bro Freddy has the highest kill rate at red ranks over every other killer on the game. You must just be fucking terrible to think that he is weak.
---
It works either way and anyone who says otherwise are lonely douchebags that need a life.
---
Downed him by basement, but with the bug I didn't want to put him there. Couldn't find a hook fast enough and he wiggled off...only to get stuck in the hill. He could spin, crouch, and heal, but that was it. Thank god endgame could take him out of his misery without having to DC.
---
Well that's because it was deathgarden
---
I wonder what would be the most deadly combo, Freddy + anyone would already be a nightmare (no pun intended) because of the slowdown.
---
Ghostface + Plague would be scary since you‚Äôd either have to deal with blood vomit or being jumpscared by 0 terror radius insta-down.
---
Double Legion would basically mean they could stick together and injure entire groups really quickly.
---
Of course Nurse and Spirit would be strong, but nothing really special about their interactions with other killers.
---
One option let's more people have fun tho. I'd say that's the better option.
---
‚ÄúWould of‚Äù is literally incorrect and doesn‚Äôt even make sense.
---
I usually don‚Äôt have issues with perks I usually hate certain add ons with certain killers though.
---
This feels like a cursed image...
---
If you didn't have to work toward a specific thing every time o would do this.
---
I'd love the tension of running from 2 killers.
---
This is the basement bug this is what happens if your on PC and get hooked in the basement till you get hit
---
I feel so bad they have to deal with these people, everyone wants to be pleased and the devs are trying, but at this point they are probably tired of it all, just so tired
---
Bro just jump the fence smh
---
Im having so much fun playing blendette in the new map.... sooo easy. Iron will and sprint burst in that map is OP. i seriously havent been hoocked once in that map. Not joking and i played like 15 games there
---
Go through his post history and you‚Äôll see he is off his rocker.
---
I can relate
---
They nerfed one of his blade add-ons and reduced mend time from 12 seconds to 8 seconds "in exchange" for the faster vault speeds
---
No cap, he might not be home to check y‚Äôall lmao. He might be away from his system
---
have you ever played the game you can't
---
Mate, go blendette with iron will, sprint burst, urban evasion and spine chill... you will have the time pf your life
---
Gotta love it. And when you call them out for being unnecessarily nasty they start bullying you too...
---
Simple. Give survivors 3 hits, and have anything that would put a survivor into the dying state immediately (such as noed) instead damage them twice. (So if they're healthy, they stay on their feet with one hit. If they're injured, it's business as usual.) No mither/broken would give only two hits, same as in the normal mode. Borrowed time would only give 5/10/15 seconds to mend, and would only be active for 8. MoM would be banned.
---
I ve heard about this glitch so much that i plan on going out of my way to basement hook now.
---
Yeah, like I said killers are taking advantage of it and it really isn‚Äôt fair
---
Well at least you admitted that the game is in fact survivor sided but there‚Äôs not enough good survivors for it to matter. That‚Äôs been my opinion all along. Even at rank 1 you can win 90% of games as killer because the survivors will make enough mistakes for you to capitalize on.
---
I'm rank 4 and see about 2 rank 13-17 due to swf before I would just Dodge and keep looking for other high ranks but now you can't and it's bs
---
"GG EZ, baby killer." - said the toxic Meg that was 5 ranks higher than the killer while playing full SWF at the same ranks as her, with everyone running the usual meta/evasion builds. :)
---
Yeah lock this up somewhere, never to be revealed to the public again. K thnx. Hahaha
---
forsenE Clap
---
I figured, but it‚Äôs nice to know for sure :( appreciate you letting me know!
---
Yeah, and I've just proved that you guys are full of shit.
---
Argueably its worth leveling ash for the addon perk. That, pharmacy and plunderers with a coin offering is just dank. Especially with these plunderer challenges.
---
Yeah because nobody says mid rank survivors are OP. I could probably 4K every game with Clown at that rank.
---
Or the community is split? People have opinions.  Crazy
---
There's only one dev I would suck off.
---
I hooked 6 people just now and it didn‚Äôt even work!
---
They really should have just nerfed the time it takes to break pallets, make it similar to demo and it‚Äôd still be useful, just not insanely fast since he doesn‚Äôt have any startup
---
Vids I used for juke parts

Yeah, I hooked quite a few people in the basement today, more than a handful, and I had no idea there's a glitch/bug down there.... What is it?
---
If you have distortion its basically a free win unless your team is trash. Just gonna be the steathiest bitch alive. Run bond so you can int your teamates by running the killer to them.
---
Not in a while, because it‚Äôs an exhaustion perk
---
Nope. If that were the case people on either post would agree with the post. But that was not the case.
---
The community just loves sucking the devs cocks and can never say the devs are ever wrong.
---
Deep wound got changed again, it doesn't go down while sprinting.
---
r/oddlysatisfying
---
Sucking cocks amazing though ?
---
Well i do hate it when i get hit after i vault the window and my character is like 2 meters away from the window after and the hit still lands, those lag hits are stressfull and the huntress hatchets, i have been hit by those when i was behind a tree or behind a wall and the axe  went right through the wall not to mention recent bug with the basment, one killer in the chat admited to abuse that bug cuz he cant do the challenges like wtf  there are a lot of bugs in the game but i just wish they looked into these 1st before adding comsetics -\_-
---
Perk Idea: Voodoo Doll  
---
If unhooked in front of the killer by someone without borrowed time, the dying status effect transfers to the unhooker, while the unhooked survivor gains any health states the unhooker lost.
---
Then why don‚Äôt you leave? Bye!
---
Or people have different opinions? The ones who agreed with you probably upvoted and moved on, the ones who disagreed with you wanted to say their viewpoint. Also, how does this make everyone suck dev dick?
---
Yeah even if you're running Borrowed Time, I'm *right there* dude. You're not getting nearly the value that you think you are.
---
I usually let all survivors live because I like to have fun with them and try and scare them in creative ways so I just got for 2 hook on everyone for points.
---
Sometimes, seems like every game honestly, they don't unhook someone on 2nd hook and I feel bad letting everyone else go after they let someone die on hook.
---
I get sad messages afterward by what I imagine are survivors who look exactly like the cat in OP's post.

And then Claudette became the new killer. The end. Actually is is possible for something like that to happen?
---
Loving the new map. A huntress literally walked right into me and didn't even see me.
---
Nope, if that were the case people would disagree with some of the commenters. Didn't happen. One of them had over 100+ comments.

It's obvious that this community treat the devs as God and think the game is always perfect even if it isn't.

‚Äúmy homie over there thinks youre cute‚Äù
---
If you think clown and doc are bad, play Oni
---
Because they know that real life bullying has consequences. So they take it to where they can do it anonymously. Weak people need to "prove" themselves.
---
Toxic survivors need to remember that the killer is trying to win just as much as they are. They're not there to let you win
---
What rank killer are you? Also theres a big difference between purple ranks and rank 1. Like i said you dont even need to play it yourself watch some streamers, its very easily observable.

Cool, dude.
