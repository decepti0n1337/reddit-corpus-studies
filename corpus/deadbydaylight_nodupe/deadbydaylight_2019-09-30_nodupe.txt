Aiming and shooting beams of light with the flashlight is pretty intense.

---
PC or Console?
---
It wastes as much time as being healed by 1 teamate.
---
I would like to thank the Leatherface that had barbecue and chili, saw my teammates had zero interest in saving me, saw me kobe off the hook and showed me the hatch. Thank you, really. You are my hero
---
That could be cool but from a business standpoint I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll do it.  Licensed killers are bringing lots of new players and selling lots of DLC.  I never imagined there would be a game where I can play as Freddy and teleport around the map lol.  But originality is always appreciated as well
---
BBQ
---
that new matchmaking hurts
---
What are thooooose swings from clown oh my god
---
Having subtle nods to a character being gay would probably be more effective and not make it seem like they're just adding the survivor to be INCLUSIVE.

did i accidentally create a meme template

Ya. Sadly we will most likely not have Dollface running around a garage and looping her around the Semi-truck
---
Sorry just really proud of it
---
Hunter from Halo or Tank from L4D would be terrifying
---
Congrats
---
I didn't mean this sarcastically, really, congrats. You did something some people will never do
---
Yea but 1) You'll never get better at dealing with X if you never play against X.
---
And 2) You're outight fucking over the other 3 players by handicapping them with 3 vs 1 and 5 gens.
---
It really is just crybaby Survivors who want to only play matches where the odds are in their favor.
---
I mean not many survivors would get out of that situation with 2 left no matter what the killer is. At most 1 escapes
---
They have a key and open the hatch and hop on in?
---
Don't forget being unable to see blood in Frenzy which I don't get as it made Bloodhound pretty good on him.
---
I have a feeling the devs had multiple ideas how to fix the moonwalking exploit (Have timer not go down in terror radius so moonwalking won't work, hide blood so they can't track while walking backwards in frenzy, etc.) and they simply added all of them instead of just one or some.
---
Hold L1 or whatever the sprint button is for you at the same time of entering.
---
Better then I‚Äôve ever done and IM RANK 12 üí™üòÉüëà
---
I genuinely don't understand either just wanted to save my friend so he could escape lol
---
You should change your name to saltvivor.
---
The 3 gen strat is op, i did it with doctor a little over a year ago (long time lmao) and i was in the 3 gen strat for well over 40 mins
---
It happens, everyone blows up gens when they first play survivor, you get used to the skill checks
---
I don't mean this to sound rude but do you know you get a sound prompt before a skill check? Listen out for that and just practise
---
It‚Äôs a kilt goddamnit
---
Distressing is nice when paired with that Trapper perk that increases chance of skillchecks but decreases chance of success zones.
---
Nice Cosplay :)
---
The game right is almost unplayable, its just barely holding together.
---
I‚Äôm still confused as to weather or not he‚Äôd be killer or survivor 
---
Probably killer
---
Is it difficult to rank up i cant remember
---
Bloodpoints aren't related to rank...
---
Depends are you on switch, Ps4, Xbox, or PC?
---
Switch would probably go to Legion or Ghostface
---
Ps4/Xbox would go to Leatherface for BBQ, Clown, or Ghostface
---
PC Leatherface, Hag, Clown, or Ghostface
---
WHY WOULD YOU GO FOR THE RED TOP MILK YOU HEATHEN
---
It‚Äôs not points anymore it‚Äôs emblems
---
Kinda not really
---
Well face camping sure is a tactic, if you‚Äôre that desperate to secure a kill.. don‚Äôt really care about piping.. and don‚Äôt give a damn about bp. The ‚Äúyou can play however you want‚Äù argument I get.. but you can ‚Äúearn money however you want‚Äù in real life including robbing old women. It‚Äôs just a matter of personal perspective and trying.
---
r/rimjob_steve
---
No shaming please.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Bloodpoints don‚Äôt affect your pips in any way, you need to play for Emblem score
---
At the end of the day perks won‚Äôt change much, iron will is good but strider kinda counters it hard. Best thing to do is learn how a spirit plays. E.g think like them, if you were them where would you go, you wanna be unpredicatable, don‚Äôt sprint everywhere unless you vault a safe window like shack or an infinite situation or you can get to a pallet. Some spirits go around pallets so you gotta guess what side.
---
Don‚Äôt have it ):
---
Shit I didn‚Äôt mean to put this here sorry
---
Who r u. Playing
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank
---
It's based in emblems
---
0 points for no emblem
---
1 for bronze 
---
2 for silver 
---
3 for gold
---
4 for iridescent 
---
You need 8 points at 5 and 9 at 4 just to safety pip
---
That‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt pip, you got petty kills. But kills don‚Äôt mean you pip. It‚Äôd be better going for new chases and applying pressure and not one/two hooking
---
To be real just leave them. Or at least thats what I do. If you see that they imediately run for that window and you know you can't get a hit before they vault it just leave it be youll get them off guard somewhere else. If you know that theyre just going to sit at that generator over and over you can come at them from the window itself cutting them off that first window vault hopefully. Don't bring bamboozale though its a waist for something that only occasionally happens.
---
The Jackal and Angry Princess would be the two I‚Äôd want to see the most!
---
Thank u
---
Thanks
---
Or them accusing you of lag switching even though its just their shitty wifi
---
That makes sense and what's piping
---
...no?
---
I laughed, but I know I'm exactly the same
---
Or more likely the only one with one of those cakes left.
---
 No problem, bro! If you have anymore questions I highly recommend going to the Dead by Daylight Wiki!
---
Legion is a joke now.
---
Man, some of y‚Äôall need to leave moms basement. Fucking weirdos.
---
Jump down and say something dangerous
---
Holy fuck
---
Na I‚Äôm pretty knowledgeable on da game just didn‚Äôt know wat the offering was but thanks
---
Gee it's like playing killer gets 5x the BP so everyone is trying to do it. Maybe they need to up survivor BP a bit and make it worth everyone's time.
---
Oh my, now that was certainly something üòÇ
---
Well the thing is on mobile as long as you can get away from the killer you can hide in grass Because grass rendering is glitched to be facing the killer
---
I always thought he sounded like Eric Forman
---
Quentins, assemble!
---
oof
---
Walk up to him, crouch, drop the item, and crouch away.
---
Yo what if u got in a lobby as killer and ur survivor went in ur killer lobby
---
Yeah it's fucking trash and the BP as survivor isn't worth the effort as always, and killer queues are 10-20 minutes long.
---
This would basically streamline it and let them do it immediately rather than the current deranking strat.  It makes it more accessible and convenient for these players is the issue I have.  It's better to learn killers against your own ranks anyways.  Learning Nurse against rank 14's won't really help you accomplish anything.  Also there's always rank reset if you want to play a new killer without the stress.
---
Completing this generator will gain you a special ‚ÄúPolice‚Äù costume for use on all survivors!
---
memes that make of memes
---
You know what I get reminded by that and people saying Killer with a gun? The Killerclown Art from Terrifier, how he just fucking shoots the supposed "last girl" in the head instead of torturing her. Yes we have Clown, yes we might get Pennywise but come on, Art would be such an awesome Killer and he could have two Moris, one regular and one rare one where he just whips out a gun and shoots the survivor in the head
---
I'm practically screaming at the video for the Demo to shred the pallet after the drop
---
Mettle of Man be like
---
A pip is essentially the point system to rank up. You need x amount of pips to go from rank 10 to rank 9 for example (you can check your pip progress by hovering over your rank badge.) DC‚Äôing will give you negative pips and de rank you. You can also ‚Äúblack pip‚Äù which is a 0 pip. The better you do in a match in the separate emblem category‚Äôs the better chance you have of 1-2 piping in a match. Staying near hooks costs you points and you‚Äôre punished for the duration, so it‚Äôs only useful if you REAALY want that kill bad.. as far as doing good goes.. it doesn‚Äôt help.
---
Do you have a reason why other than ‚Äúuhhhh no‚Äù?
---
Ok hear me out: minecraft dlc. Herobrine killer and steve survivor. Lrts make it happen
---
I had finally hit Rank 1 with killer playing Wraith and Billy... happiest man alive rn.
---
It's only good for anti heal builds with the clown perk
---
Porn
---
And what about Thanos?
---
I‚Äôm not defending it. I‚Äôm just saying you‚Äôre being a dick. Who cares what they play, let them be. Or be constructive at the very least. It breaks sub rules.
---
Stop reading from the survivor rulebook
---
The only thing i care about getting fixed right away is these damn hitboxes like for the most part this game is somewhat balanced but these hitboxes are what makes killer a bit more op than survivor because you take it with these hitboxes its nearly impossible to 360 unless you have $500+ wifi router just for your console/pc so really all survivors can do now is pallet loop which is really just mind game but thats not easy to do with a controller because that camera control with a mouse makes a much bigger difference than non-controller players may realize
---
A few days ago I DC‚Äôd for a Feng so she can get hatch since it was us two and we three genned ourselves. After she got out she added me and asked if I wanted to play a few matches more. And so we did and now I‚Äôm in a Discord group with other fellow survivors. 
---
In other words: I made a new friend that allowed me to meet even more friends. I love them all. I really like the group.
---
I just noticed how golden this template is.
---
It's big Franklin's time
---
Distressing is only really good if you're trying to utilize your terror radius with such perks as clouraphobja and unnerving presence, or you're just trying a farming build
---
Is that a dude or...
---
What would everyone think to Resident Evil 7's own Jack Baker as a potential licensed Killer?  
---
I generally think original killers tend to be better designed than licensed killers but when they do a licensed killer justice (Myers and reworked Freddy spring to mind) it really is exquisite.  
---
Jack Baker, the "Father" of Eveline and the patriarch of the Baker family, could be a really fun Killer to explore. Between his signature chainsaw shears, potential for Swamp Man cosmetics, some area of the Baker house as a potential map, and Ethan, Zoe or even Clancy as potential survivor options, I think Jack could be a sweet addition to the cast.
---
I watched a Billy do this on the swamp boat map. On the side between the shack and the big boat is that dock with a ramp in the middle. After he discovered it, he kept ramping off it on purpose throughout the rest of the match lol. I saw him from a distance do it the first time and I watched his head move around looking back at the ramp like, "did that really just happen?"
---
I wouldn't consider this a "typical killer main" post.

Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, Object of Obsession(especially if a  stealth killer), Prove Thyself, Iron will, Spine Chill (particularly if Spirit), Unbreakable, Toolboxes in general, Medkits whether they have an insta heal or not, and flashlights are all things whiny killers complain about.
---
Not to mention general strategies of looping the killer for too long, bodyblocking for protection hits, going for any form of flashlight or pallet save, actually cleansing their Hex totems also makes killers upset as well.
---
I know there are sore losers out there for survivors, but don't pretend it doesn't go both ways.
---
I may get hate but I think corrupt intervention is a better hex: ruin. I know it only lasts two minutes but being honest that‚Äôs longer then most ruins
---
He did this to himself
---
Does the double blood points end tomorrow morning or night??
---
Honestly, that pallet is one of the most unsafe pallets on autohaven. I love it as pig, they have no clue which way you're ambushing from when they are hiding behind the truck.
---
Saw that happen once, friend screamed bloody murder.
---
Oh hell no. I would tunnel that person as much as possible to just fucking get rid of them
---
One buff,
---
dicks in traps.
---
Done
---
Try hitting the skill checks just BEFORE you're meant to. I've found that I've made many more skill checks with this method than trying to hit the button as the marker is inside the area. Try to hit the skill check just before the marker passes into the area.
---
I agree!
---
Yeah clown is rare. Rank 12 + resets and I‚Äôve only seen clown once. My suggestion is: don‚Äôt be risky.
---
finally after sandbagging my teammates, getting in the way, purposefully taking 10 extra hits I didn't need to, and neglecting to do gens the whole match, I finally got my 1 extra Endurance hit from MoM!
---
I play doc quite a bit and how people usually play around me is not hiding around corners or in rooms that my shock can easily cover as it will mean their madness will build up quite fast, you might wanna try that. Otherwise, it's kinda a matter of getting gens done quick enough to avoid him being able to track you with the screams and/or illusions
---
I enjoy drawing and it was a request and for me its just another drawing i never had a basement back at mom and dads üëç‚úå
---
Ah. Yea.... Avoiding it
---
F
---
Nah, I was just talking about the influx of campers and ebony moris. You get a bad lobby with some serious complainers or something? Seems kinda specific.
---
Ruin is useless. Never used it, never will use it. Gimme dat BBQ
---
And when you DO yeet off that hook, that's the best.
---
Ive seen atleast 1 bnp or insta heal every match since double bp started. Its why i hate the events. Longer queues only to a prayer bead spirit or an insta heal
---
they arent even good together tho...
---
Can we stop with the posts like this?  Not everyone has those offerings, it's ridiculous to expect that everyone does.
---
I agree
---
Is the clown the worst killer compared to the others? Is there a reason he‚Äôs so rare?
---
That's what bill gets for screwing around
---
Interestingly something similar happened in a match where i was Demongoron.
---
I was still crap at using him so I lost badly so I opened a gate for the survivors accepting defeat then went to the basement in shame got my failure.
---
For some reason 3 od them didnt leave and got killed because they ran out of time.
---
Why did they not leave?
---
Good question I have no idea why they let themselves die.
---
I love it when SWF who tbag and bodyblock the whole match bitch when I camp the single hook I have with gates open and all the other three trying to bait chases.
---
Oh no he‚Äôs upset whatever shall I do
---
Wait, I do.
---
Ignore him
---
Because I don‚Äôt care
---
underrated post, but a re post of a Myers gets 3k likes.....
---
It‚Äôs when he says ‚Äúdude‚Äù/‚Äúdute‚Äù every two seconds for me
---
Doctor doesn‚Äôt have much anti-loop power, they‚Äôre usually just gonna try and shock you to stop you from vaulting or using the pallets. You can counter that by pushing the loop or when the time comes throw the pallet a bit early. Doctor slows down in treatment mode so they have to be quick on their switches (which is sorta slow to do on console.) Crouching will also prevent your madness from increasing faster. Doc can be a pain to go against but if your teams on the ball putting pressure on the gens it‚Äôs gonna force him to do the same. The more time he‚Äôs stuck in a chase or out of treatment the better. And make sure you split the gens, a lot of Docs try to push the 3 gen tactic so watch for that.
---
holy crap that was incredible. guy didn‚Äôt know what was coming.
---
&gt; Yea but 1) You'll never get better at dealing with X if you never play against X.
---
You can't get better at playing against a mori, it just removes one of your lives - That's it. Nothing to learn there. Same with 1 shots, You learn half the amount you would in a normal huntress game.
---
and tbh nurse/spirit games are entirely in the killers hands for majority. You cannot outplay a spirit who can hear your breathing or a nurse who has mastered her blinks.
---
&gt; 2) You're outight fucking over the other 3 players by handicapping them with 3 vs 1 and 5 gens.
---
They're already handicapped when huntress bought insta down hatchets and a mori. That's basically game over for your average player.
---
I'm not sure the people who DC care about handicapping their team in an already handicapped game. Selfish as it may be, their logic is to just move on to a more fun experience.
---
So many pallets thought... i always play killer and it feels like they have 10x more pallets than they do on any other map
---
When the game really does feel like it is against you.... xD
---
I'd like to see a more normal type killer too and mine would be Hannibal. Less Anthony Hopkins and more Mads Mikkelson Hannibal nice suit and all holding an ornate carving knife. He'd pull out a fork with his Mori and cut a bite out. I feel like he'd be a stalking killer with GF leaning but he'd stalk backwards lowering his terror radius as he stalks eventually to 0. When reaching 0 his red stain would disappear making him dangerous in the endgame.
---
Babe.. how am I an incel
---
Add haunted ground for the ultimate build
---
It makes every pallet possible for the killer to mindgame and catch survivors.  And the goal is to get the initial stun then run to the next pallet.
---
Hell to the yeah.
---
Yeah. When you play as demogorgon, you should just have a black screen
---
So, to make it simpler. He‚Äôs an asswater killer.
---
3% is a fuckin joke
---
It could be like huntress. Before the heart beat starts you hear a faint "staaaaars"
---
thanks for proving my point by saying you report people for one of these tactics.
---
I've run into, seen, and talked to my fair share of players who cry about all this stuff, played plenty of killers who just flat out DC when faced with this stuff.
---
Is there account linking between Switch and console?
---
There's a bit of a power problem for killers.
---
Any killer that isn't Nurse Billy or spirit has little chance to win at high ranks as the others can't pressure the map enough or have little to no mobility or are too slow to use their power.
---
Looking at you Trapper.
---
Protection hits in general are buggy. I got the Protection icon when I'm nowhere near a survivor and it still didn't count towards a stack.
---
Bitch move.
---
Unfortunately yes :(
---
Lmao what
---
PLOT TWIST: _but the motherfucker is a smurfer and wrecks the whole team in 3 minutes_
---
Camping should only net 1 kill anyways
---
HOLY SHIT!
---
I would assume it has some otherworldly sense that we humans cannot comprehend so the devs made it so when we play demo we can see normally.
---
Maybe it's cause I'm on PS4 and there's no type chat functionality in-game but I haven't seen anybody bitching about that luckily. I feel like the only toxic things I run into on PS4 are players who quit.
---
ty ty
---
Stop being greedy bros. I know you are sitting on some gruesome gateaus.
---
I‚Äôve had a bug on PS4 constantly where my camera will sort of jerk and drift, and it doesn‚Äôt happen in any other game so it‚Äôs not my controller.
---
Im always the first person that gets tombstoned, i feel your pain

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/db3wwt/connection_problems_all_weekend/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
&gt;It‚Äôs actually useful for a lot more time bc it could save you from flashlight
---
No, because honestly if your playing killer right there are few opportunities for survivors to use flashlights:
---
- Pallets
---
- During the end of the Survivor Pickup Animation
---
- Windows
---
- Narrow areas while carrying a survivor. 
---
 
---
The game however already has things to counter this without any perks. For pallets if they blinded you (which I never recommend unless you have a plan with the blind as it is dangerous) you can hear sounds and follow the sounds of the survivor, for the pickup animation facing a wall won't allow for flashlight saves or you can fake pick up and immediately turn to the flashlight light survivor and punish them for it, Windows are definitely the most ineffective way of flashing a killer as it's super dangerous and can be punished but sound sound gives the survivors location off, and while carrying a survivor you can moonwalk to a hook to avoid a flashlight.
---
&gt;which would make you lose a minute or two.
---
Flashlight saves make you lose so much more time then a minute. Your talking about an entire chase, and then another chase and then a blind animation and then maybe even perks like decisive strike.
---
&gt;To mess flashlight saves even more, add fire up
---
Don't do this if you ever are actually trying to play the game for your own sake. That's two perk slots wasted for a meh perk(Fire Up) and a terrible perk.
---
Bodyblocking is a BANNABLE OFFENSE. Actually considered cheating. I was simply pointing that out and telling you and other players you should report people who do so.
---
Again, I dont see how it would be a problem if they implemented everything I mentioned. I really doubt low rank survivor lobbies would get bullied much more than they already do. And this gives more incentive to play more variety of killers. And yes pkayjnh rank 14 nurse would help. Getting bullied every game trying to practice her is literally 0 fun. Having a separate rank would 100% fix that.
---
shirtless myers
---
To prevent long chases? Bloodlust is fine as it is.
---
HAHA HAHAHA SO FUNNNNYY
---
Big brain
---
On old Wraith I used to run the no light burn add on with lightborn, won a lot of games off of confused survivors
---
Imagine dcing  to a legion/clown
---
Spine Chill is awesome of those pallet moments. I notice it turns off when I run over the pallet and that tells me she is circling it.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen an opinion this bad in a while
---
You said "ew, a naked drawn woman" If you weren't aware. I'd call that being an incel
---
Patrick Bateman
---
Itll be nice if it muted your breath while healthy or muted your footsteps
---
It's mostly used for meme terror radius builds. You might make survivors nervous more easily, but the Doctor absolutely gets the most use out of the perk.
---
then you dont spend more than 5 minutes scrolling through this subreddit lmao
---
then definitely Dance With Me since it hides scratch marks for a few seconds
---
I've seen it in game on PC and several times on here.
---
I didn‚Äôt think that was possible on PS4
---
hahaha my brother had a guy open the hatch with a key in his face while on the hook its was really unfortunate at the time but hilarious to remember afterwards. Some people just can't read situations.
---
Aight, I understand it now, but Bodyblocking the Killer to get your friend out is super scummy.
---
Brutal strength would cap this off so nicely 
---
Pls bhvr gib 5 perks slots
---
It's just random, all my friends will run DS and I'll be the one to get obsession time and again.
---
I had something similar happen to me this morning that I've never experienced before. My Adrenaline perk activated and I noticed that I was still running fast, even after the duration of the Adrenaline had ended. I thought it might've been lag related as my character model looked laggy but everyone else was fine, I honestly think its just a glitch.
---
Ooh, then maybe it's something else, you didn't really specify, apologies üòµ
---
FROM THE TOP ROPES
---
You mean die by daylight?
---
*badum tiss*
---
Ahhh I hover around rank 7 as a killer so I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve experienced much of this.
---
You play as myers with no perks or addons
---
fair, but it really doesnt matter if 2,3 or 4 are alive tbh, unless they corodinate their moves really well, there really isnt much they can do
---
Right? Your gonna tell me if I‚Äôm at full health, and someone gets unhooked near me and the killer goes for them I can‚Äôt walk in front of them to hinder their progress and take a hit? Bs, and I main killer
---
On PS4 the map runs like a slideshow for killers and theres no hooks on the upper level
---
well....I had a Portal on the hatch as well, so I would see them getting Close to it
---
Or too busy cleansing haunted grounds
---
Use your feet
---
I feel you on that flashlight aim 100%
---
Yea that‚Äôs my bad.
---
https://youtu.be/_Wurk-6OEkE
---
Here‚Äôs a clip of it.
---
What do you play on and what‚Äôs your rank? I had the exact same huntress but no mori
---
the thing is the Demogorgon does that always, cause he always knows uf survivors are near, due to his Portals, and they cant hear him coming
---
Hey, just got the game this week. Where can I find more lore? The wiki doesn't really help.... Being bullied caused the nurse?!
---
Exactly. That's what i do
---
Yeah I've been popping out my tier 3 right behind a survivor and it's been working great.
---
Survivors are more agile but if you go into a custom game and chase a survivor in a straight line you‚Äôll catch them straight away, vaults and pallets mixed with lithe and balanced landing give survivors a temporary little boost to get ahead and layouts of maps/jungle gyms can slow the killer down too, hope this helps
---
Rank 21
---
People are telling you counters that require you to run perks, here‚Äôs some perk less counters:
---
1. If you think she is phasing during a loop run in the direction around the loop that she has been running, then cut back and abandon the loop (most spirits anticipate you to hug the pallet)
---
2. If you hear the phasing noise don‚Äôt immediately abandon a gen (pay attention to your surroundings) the only way you‚Äôll get yanked off a gen is if you are on the most accessible side of it.
---
3. If you do try to loop a phasing spirit pretend to run to the pallet and double back she will most likely strike the area between the pallet.
---
4. Spirit will almost always eventually get you, your goal is to prolong the chase, give the others space to do gens, and give the killer as little information as possible (with most killers the most efficient way to loop is by using one pallet in every quadrant of the map, with spirit the best way to get good gen progress is sometimes to abandon that rule)
---
5. Play as the spirit (understand her power, her weaknesses)
---
Good luck out there in the fog
---
No I‚Äôm on Xbox but like I said I probably just had a bad game(frame rates are on and off for me sometimes)

#The State of Decay Chapter

You know how Bill was meant to be the Steam-exclusive character? This chapter is meant to be the Xbox-exclusive one (except that's lame so it's on all platforms).
---
#New Killer: The Feral
---
Though the origin of it and all other zeds remain a mystery, there is no doubting that the Feral is meant to be the perfect killer. Quick, quiet, and lightning fast, the Feral has no trouble ambushing and mutilating any of the living that it may come cross. It was specifically chosen by the Entity from a world ravaged by the undead to wreak havoc among the survivors within its own realm. Its ability, Ambush, allows it to sneak up on survivors, staying low to the ground to remain hidden, before pouncing survivors. If it successfully pounces, the Feral will trigger a quicktime event between itself and the survivor: both have 5 buttons to press in very quick succession. Whoever pushes them quicker wins the event. If the survivor wins, they kick the Feral off of them and only become injured. If the Feral wins, the survivor will immediately be put into the dying state and the Feral will pick them up. It's like a combination of the Pig's ambush and Demo's lunge.

While on a fishing trip with his best friend, Ed Jones, Marcus Campbell is isolated from society for a few weeks up on Mt. Tanner. What was supposed to be a peaceful getaway, separated from the real life responsibilities and burdens of work, turned into a nightmare. Upon arriving back from their trip, Marcus and Ed had found that the world had gone to hell while they were gone. The dead had began rising after death to consume the flesh of the living. Just trying to survive, Marcus and Ed ended up as unexpected refugees at a small post-apocalyptic base centered around the Church of the Ascension in Spencer's Mill. Very quickly, Marcus would take on the role of the selfless leader of the group, to keep everyone in it alive, and to deal with other groups of survivors. After facing lots of danger in the once quiet Trumbull Valley, Marcus and his group of survivors would escape the valley to form the Network, a large group of survivors hoping to help whoever they can wherever they can. One day on what should have been a normal scavenging trip, however, Marcus and some of his fellow survivors would become under fire from a group of hostile enemies, which of course drew in hordes of the undead. Other Network survivors would arrive too late, to find that all involved in the firefight were either missing, or dead- but Marcus' story wouldn't end there. One moment he had been fending off from bandits and the hungry dead, but the next he found himself completely alone, in a world that resembled a place he had once called his reluctant home, which was covered in a new, and unfamiliar fog. Marcus' perks centre around hardy survivalism and being a selfless leader. With Taunt, you can hide the auras of your fellow survivors when a killer perk/add on would reveal them while revealing yours instead, and draw the obsession mantle from another player for a bonus to your BP gain during chases. With Powerhouse, you can temporarily stun the killer by running into them and exhausting yourself. With Scavenger's Senses, you can see the aura of the killer when they come within range of you for a short time, with a cooldown to it.

#New Map: Spencer's Mill- Church of the Ascension 
---
A semi-urban map like Badham or Lampkin, mixing forestry and rocks with houses and sheds. The centrepiece of this map is the Church of the Ascension, which is where the original group of survivors holed up in in the first State of Decay, which has a wall around it and a guaranteed generator spawn inside it.
---
Been a big fan of State of Decay since the first game. State of Decay 2... not so much, but considering how the characters are all randomly generated in SoD2 anyway, I think it's better to use the premade hero of Marcus Campbell as the survivor. Also you could probably give the Hunter from Left 4 Dead the power of the Feral I gave here and it would make as much sense
---
because I do not like it when someone fucks up the huntress lullaby
---
This legit made my night.
---
Some people don‚Äôt know what the term ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù means (I personally don‚Äôt do this but still)
---
They probably want to farm but since you went straight to do Ruin or do gens really quick, maybe they got the impression you didn't want to farm so they just quit? I mean, if I brought BPS for survivors to destroy me and leave with extra blood points and leave me with nothing, I wouldn't feel too good. Which is why I just never bring offerings anymore. I just go into every game with the assumption that I will most definitely be steamrolled by the opposition.
---
PS4. She had the goat head and blight body cosmetic.
---
There are plenty of dull colors that can be used to replace without a problem. You could use: Dark Purple, Dark Blue, Dark Orange, Gray, and the list goes on. The new colors won't be brighter or more vibrant. Most versions of colorblind get rid of red, and considering the option of making players play without scratchmarks is total bullshit.
---
never level up your discordance
---
You can always get more. You might as well use them and learn how to use them than save them forever.
---
David:  Your lunges are about as strong as a kitten‚Äôs!
---
Pig:  Omae wa mou, pigdierou.
---
David:  U wot mate?!
---
Where exactly would you report something like this?
---
This shit has been happening a lot to me.
---
I play on pc, weird that we got basically the same huntress player
---
Complete waste imo. Even if they thought they weren‚Äôt gonna get a lot of points they still got less and wasted an offering dc‚Äôing. Then again I‚Äôve had a couple survivors today use cakes and kill them selves on hook the second I caught them... one even DC‚Äôd wile I was clearly messing around simply because they missed a flashlight save. There‚Äôs just no pleasing some people.
---
Literally me last game. it was a FARMING huntress and we were all taking hits while grouped up and injured and even while she was carrying a survivor and still only had 2 stacks by end of game.
---
At the right angle yes.
---
Because survivor hitboxes are smaller than killer hitboxes. By looping around objects, killers have to travel a longer distance around the structure to be able to catch up to a survivor. Thats why on thag one video it was said that running around a tree is a great way to stall a dinosaur. While killers can still catch up due to their speed, it takes much longer since they have to travel a longer distance. This is why looping works. Pallet stuns, window vaults, and exhaustion perks make it feel even longer. Keep in mind that killers are normally only 15% faster than survivors, and some killers less than that. That is why killers like huntress with 110% movement speed seem to take the longest.
---
Test your Nat type until it says open. That's the fix
---
Nice, I'll look out for it.
---
The timer is just naruto running
---
Men‚Äôs size 13 Nikes...
---
You do realize Hillbilly was BHVR's Leatherface before they got the rights to the actual character, right?
---
Get hit by a downed survivor or while killer is by a hook, works best for me :/ it‚Äôs so buggy tho
---
Predator kills for sport, thats their entire thing, not just because they‚Äôre in their way
---
Oh. So if you didn't know the timer slows down if a player is hooked or downed so, not a great answer but, I did already know that.
---
Yeah
---
That music stresses me out more than any other killer‚Äôs.  I always lose those chases
---
Jack frost
---
Speaking of Badham, last game I went there were 2 totems in the same half of the basement/boiler area literally in LOS of each other.
---
What a good game
---
Took me a few games to get the timing right, so if I queue up for killer when I have 2 gens left I usually escape or die right when the killer game starts!
---
How long were you drawing this
---
It's just considerably worse for survivors. Sure there are salty killers, however the majority of survivors feel entitled to survive and act like spoiled children If they do not.
---
If I'm not wrong, you have to have used the report function on the post-game screen, then if you have evidence of any sort, you can go to https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new to submit a ticket. Though I think the chances of anything being done are slim, so I'd only go through this whole reporting process if you encounter it extremely often. Otherwise probably best to just play on.
---
Nice
---
Just wait till they fix it I suppose, nothing else I can really tell you to help you find a way to fix it
---
reeeeally? god thats lame. i watched the trailer when it was first announced, and honestly i'm still going to buy and play it... because im just a sucker for RE... but imagine if theyd made all the outbreak survivors playable... like an outbreak reimagining... sure its not an ourbreak remake... but if i could just hear alyssa screaming "IVE BEEN POISONED YOU IDIOT! IVE BEEN POISONED YOU IDIOT" over and over again... i think it would warm my heart.
---
Listening to it gets me hyped
---
This is absolutely hilarious. Also we need a sad cat cosmetic for Pig.
---
Hes the scariest killer to face for me.
---
Rank 1 billy, nurse or spirit? Meh they're all the same.
---
Rank 1 trapper? good luck mind gaming that motherfucker, he'll make you think you're getting away but hes leading you precisely where he wants you to be. He hides traps in the weirdest spots and it works every fucking time.
---
True, but I wouldn't expect much, but then again, the Predator loves being a guest star in DLCs
---
As a survivor I get into a match within a few minutes. Playing as a killer can take 10-15 minutes for me.
---
Ghost face after I break him out of his stalk for the 50th time
---
Well, that takes away from the games. People in horror movies aren't gonna let the killer stab them,  so its understandable why it is against the rules in the game.
---
I'd hold off a bit on once a chapter tho. What I think we saw with the Stranger Things chapter was a bunch of new players going "wow! Steve and Nancy! I get to play as them against the Demogorgon?!?" and then they were getting crushed by more experienced killers who were brought from good ranks to mediocre ranks as though they're the same. I'd say have a rank reset roughly halfway through each chapter so any new players don't get stomped
---
"Who's the new girl?"
---
"That's Hamantha"
---
SWF are exploiting because they're using their eyes? What?
---
I like it‚Äôs infinite, is fun as hell and yet effective
---
See above comment!
---
Fortunately for me, my PS4 killer lobbies have been really quick, probably quicker than usual. My big problem right now is frame rate. It effects most killers, but I've especially noticed it on Demogorgon.
---
How about "the killer is not allowed to reach 10 feet through a window to hit a survivor on the other side."
---
Why are people like this? Like. Why BM? I dont get why people gotta start shit. Just enjoy the game. Holy hell.
---
Nah some people can dish it out but can‚Äôt take it. Don‚Äôt let it bother you. People are weird.
---
My FAVORITE moments is when I go for a suicidal hook save, get hit while getting to the hook 1 stack, rescue them, get downed 2 stack, friend runs off 3 stack. üò≠ I‚Äôll throw my life away again for you Meg &lt;3 I love you you know who you are Ms always getting tunneled I‚Äôll save you
---
This comment is interesting to say the least lmao. I'm running WGLF (Only benefits my bp gain) And Prove Thyself (Also for BP).  So I'm running 2 good perks and 2 bloodpoint perks. How am I playing for rank lmao?
---
Practice tbh, try tool boxes with larger skill check zone add ons and listen for the audio cue, try just hitting good skill checks at first and don‚Äôt worry about the great ones until you feel confident enough - even when doing gens with Ruin, when you hit a skill check on ruin get off the gen for a second or two until the smoke clears then hop back on. Good luck!
---
Why do you want to choose what's "fun" for him? He enjoys the game by ranking up, that's his deal, while you on the other hand, have fun by telling people what to do like an entitled a**hole
---
its happened on console (xb1) multiple times, I've even came out losing a single attachment but keeping my item and other attachment, it's quite unfortunate.
---
‚ÄúOtzdarva would like to know your location.‚Äù
---
I wanted her to hook me. I felt bad because she was new to the game or pig at least.
---
Fastest DC in the west
---
Why
---
They're shorts, you degenerates.
---
Oh god don‚Äôt promote the ability to try and play docked. It‚Äôs a horrid mess. The game is fantastic portable though
---
Ghost face mains rise up
---
I love it so much
---
Your wrong body block is allowed. It‚Äôs only not allowed when taking game hostage
---
Intentionally playing like shit/throwing the gamd
---
Huntress throws axes. You can throw tomahawks in some Call of Duty games. Seems right to me.
---
what is bm? blackmail? sry im new
---
Relatable
---
I think you may have misread that part. The effect  lasts 10, 15, or 20 seconds per tier. The 120 seconds is the cooldown inbetween each time it occurs. If this is still confusing, I'll try to reword it again.
---
It‚Äôs not against the rules though so it‚Äôs fine https://i.redd.it/f79s93mhr1m11.png
---
Omg no
---
Thanks, I appreciate it.
---
Bad manners
---
Yes... u/nwordcountbot
---
I did tonight. Always wanted that perk since I don‚Äôt own Laurie
---
It‚Äôs a bug, dude.
---
Crazy. I‚Äôve never seen anyone do this in my games
---
See *you* play with WGLF and get 100k. *I* play with WGLF and get 1 unhook before the killer 1 hooks me :(
---
U lost kid
---
The devs have confirmed on stream many times it‚Äôs not. When they listed body blocking they mean taking game hostage type of body blocking, otherwise killers like billy or leather would be banned so many times by trapping ppl in corners to knock them down
---
https://i.redd.it/f79s93mhr1m11.png
---
I love it because it beats blendette‚Äôs at least for a killer main.
---
All the more to put in my mouth
---
Are you sure? I'm pretty sure the game breaks every new update.
---
what the hecc
---
I agree it‚Äôs a mess, but I played like 4 hours release day and after about 2 I got used to it, just don‚Äôt go back to pc or Xbox or you will really notice how bad it is lol!
---
it was bug when he get speed boost ( get hit or adrenaline ) but not ended at time and continue for minutes
---
I want to mori you too after this lack of punctuation and grammar.
---
Why did I read this in a loud russian accent??
---
I had that issue as well on switch today, just thought I was losing my mind.
---
It‚Äôs a waste of two perk choices and the shorter the duration the faster it can proc again showing they‚Äôre still working on it 8x2 beats 12x1 as an example.
---
I explain the exact reason why Otzdarva and everyone else who keeps it at rank one and get downvoted for just telling the truth to why it‚Äôs effectively worse even if just by 4 seconds that‚Äôs half the time of the original which you don‚Äôt want.
---
It would make franklins used much more often. Probably would have to make it so it‚Äôs only items left at the hook and ones dropped by the survivor.
---
Why did you get downvoted lmao
---
imagine following company policy... my username on steam is "Screw Company Policy" and i wear the bloody head piece instead, I've gotten some nice feedback on it :)
---
Been a while just a little at a time iv just been putting it off
---
ü•¥ them toes
---
The power has some problems, but I do like his name. I always wondered what they'd call Pennywise if they added him, and the Deadlights actually sounds pretty cool.
---
They enjoy being a cunt. Simple as that. You dont do something unless you want to do it.
---
That wasn‚Äôt a rework, his power was just nerfed in every way and he was given 115 movement speed. Freddy got a rework, legion just got his values changed.
---
This is why I wish it showed people's highest rank when they write about game balance.
---
Not that their opinion isn't valid at their skill level, just that it might be completely unrelated to a discussion about balance at other levels.
---
Edit: I am not saying that high ranks should be ignored and only red ranks opinions matter. I specifically mean balance discussions being *related* to certain skill levels. A rank 20's balance opinions are valuable, but *unrelated* to red ranks in most cases, *and visa versa.*
---
Yeah, thats what I'm doing rn. But it kinda sucks because everyone goes tho those building. But I cant just leave them all alone
---
I‚Äôd rather have literally any other survivor for a hypothetical Silent Hill chapter. Downpour was one of the worst entries in the series and I prefer pretending it didn‚Äôt exist
---
i feel like swapping out huntress Lullaby for thrill of the hunt will pan out before for you; slower clensing time and indications save innocent totem lives.
---
Something like; Ruin, Devour hope, Haunted ground &amp; Thrill of the hunt
---
fuck yes &lt;3
---
Why aren‚Äôt you a survivor in my games! Need more scared survivors. Well as long as you aren‚Äôt playing super immersed.
---
I love this one thing!
---
I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt see what his original comment was, but as someone who does play for rank, I can only imagine it was some fuck shit
---
Im a console nurse.  All the hits that shouldn't work do, and all the perfect swings seem to miss.
---
Who would have thought a new console release would have a lot of new players?
---
My good sir I believe we call that.. Scaroused.
---
The fact that she teabagged at the end
---
Yeah literally meant items put down intentionally by survivor and only in the exit gates themselves. I thought that was clear by my post...
---
ESSENTIAL perk
---
Of course..it instantly makes killers tunnel me why wouldnt i?
---
This happens to me sometimes. It's not the biggest deal but is annoying. It only happens if I level up and then close the game. 
---
If I level up and then play another round, it's never happened so I either save my BPs for next time I'll play or I'll level and then do a match if that makes sense
---
I feel like there are four types of players. I like to rank them as follows:
---
Type 1 : new players, pretty self explanatory. Runs things like self-care with resilience and heals constantly. Barely learning the mechanics of the game. Spends most of game crouching near hook or in a corner of the map. 
---
Type 2: players who are attempting to reach lower ranks but lack the skill level (purple ranks). These players can be a hit or miss, either big brained or no brained. 
---
Type 3: red ranks. Veterans, or players who are working hard to get to rank 1. Most of the time they consist of Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike. 
---
Then there is secret type 4: the players who really don‚Äôt give a shit about ranks at all and may play from time to time but are very well versed in dbd.
---
It‚Äôs reallllllly sketchy when you take a hit for someone. Oddly enough, one of the easiest ways I‚Äôve found to get stacks is when someone is picked up by the killer, just take a hit and you pretty much always get a stack.
---
I always follow company policy it makes killers tunnel me extra hard!
---
I like it, hex maybe?
---
Cock and ball torture hahahahahahaha
---
did you heard about the I N F I N I T E S
---
As a killer I prefer "baiting" when I think they'll go for the save, And walk away a little bit, But face camping is just too much, I draw the line there.
---
Well, if he continuously hounds you, isn't that harassment, which is bannable?
---
Don't talk shit about ma main mate &gt;:( I play him since the begining... he his my trusty killer ;_;
---
Give in
---
No, but it will be dead by daylight
---
Hmmmmm 5 hours on and off?
---
THIS THIS AND THIS!!!! I've escaped twice barely and via hatch. Ive never gotten out through an exit gate yet. 
---
Ive managed to open one to what looked extremely cool, with the doors sliding and the stranger things feel, but then a NOED spirit hit me and hooked me. :(
---
Wouldn't help you anyway since half the time you don't get a chance to move yet.
---
From what I can tell most killers don't touch survivor and vice versa.
---
That some percentage of high ranked players are bad doesn't really make a difference to my point.
---
There is absolutely a difference. I don't bet your average rank 15 player wouldn't be able to "win" consistently at red ranks.
---
I don‚Äôt have that on my level 1 dwight i was using for a daily...
---
Because she's too OP it's ridiculous and boring.
---
At least there's pallets around literally every corner.
---
I understand flashlights but an effective Nurse on console is basically a myth. Lol. Way too much prediction involved due to FPS. But I know some scary ones are out there.
---
If only we could call her(entity\*) that XD
---
Who is the puppet? Is the puppet even the killer?
---
Not a tier list, these are categories
---
Yeah but run balanced landing tho lol
---
I started with the same problem, which is how I ended up maining Feng. She has a perk, Technician, which has up to a 50% chance of not causing a notification when failing a skill check on a generator. That helped me a lot starting out.
---
Constant, it allows you to channel for some reason though.
---
Lol
---
Yeah those are the people that have 69420 brain cells
---
Since they changed the wraith, I've not once been burned out of cloak. It's still possible technically, but it literally never happens. But no, it wouldn't help in this situation as they are not aiming at your eyes, they're aiming at your body
---
I got 69420 once B      )
---
Id say in the stranger things update, if you dont count the new dlc, its 1 step forward 5 steps back. Frames drop heavily, matchmaking was fucked, dedicated servers somehow made hitboxes worse, UI errors are far more abundant and swf is fucked because half the time only 1 person in a swf group will connect to a killer while the rest are stuck in the searching lobby. 
---
The only things the most recent patch has fixed of any significance are ranks and demogorgon buff.
---
It‚Äôs downing and hooking the same survivor over and over again as soon as they get off the hook, making it so they hardly get play the game. Not only is it unfun for the survivor but it‚Äôs an awful strategy for killers, especially one‚Äôs using Barbecue and Chili.
---
I absolutely hate her she's too strong no matter if a noob is playing her or a pro -.-
---
Am sory I wil Spel BeTuR nekcs tIMe
---
I agree! Bloodlust needs removal.
---
Woah!
---
You're right, I CAN hear this meme
---
I know there will be a pennywise someday
---
I used to love doing that lol. Just watch them waste a good four or five seconds of flashlight and then uncloak in their face.... beautiful
---
Except deranking is definitely a thing in this game and while a 15 might be average, green ranks and up are a gamble.
---
Your point implied that the rank would give some insight on to how a player thinks. I'm saying this isn't necessarily the case because people fluctuate ranks all the time for many reasons. Especially with rank reset in this game.
---
Maybe, but I wouldn't want anyone getting banned over a video game you know lol
---
There is a load of unsafe pallets, but the map also has TONS of strong loops based on windows.  Not all of them spawn every time, but enough of them do that you can at least waste a lot of time if you know where you need to run.  The big issue is how nondescript most of the hallways are, which can make it too easy to get turned around as a survivor.
---
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one

When is jaws gonna be a killer.  It gets an aquarium map to swim in, and in all the other maps it just T poses.
---
But actually, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde would be pretty cool
---
She's way too good for how easy she is. Is way harder to master nurse/billy/huntress so if the player is good at them survivors aren't as salty because it takes some sort of skill. Spirit players just use headphones.
---
Agreed, it's annoying when people leave because of someone's rank
---
I got a 4K when everyone didn‚Äôt leave because of a Dwight hooked (which was my 1st hook that game ngl
---
I never said he was bad, he just needs a buff to make him funner to play as

üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è this KILLED ME
---
If you know what your doing plenty of killers can do well at Red Ranks. I play Ghostface mainly at Rank 1 and do very well. It's all about how you juggle and pressure gens. Nurse, Spirit, Billy, and Freddy may be better, but plenty of killers can have a shot if played well.
---
I usually don‚Äôt DC against her but she is god awfully boring to play against. Basically if you don‚Äôt have iron will you‚Äôre fucked (killer main btw)
---
Also losing items.. even when escaping.. they always find a way to break this game..

Hi I'm Bebba big oink

Yeah well now that I think about it maybe he was just trying to make his stream entertaining but I checked his profile just now and he wasn't streaming soo... idk man:/

Oh, it probably is. I‚Äôve played nobody but Ghostface for 2 days, and believe me when I say it‚Äôs pretty good. I prefer open maps since they allow for more maneuverability, but to each their own.
---
You're lucky the survivor didn't have the "finger guns" perk, you would have launched into space.

Im console i do decent against then again i only decent against rank 15‚Äôs and and above

Ha. Alright, I‚Äôll give ya this round.
---
The upper level doesn't have hooks, but the 2 stairs up to it do.  You should always be able to make it to a hook up there unless they bodyblock super hard, at which point you probably got 2-3 hits.
---
Awesome. So just enough time I wont be able to get any more games in...
---
Oh ok, thanks for letting me know. I haven't experienced it yet so I just assumed OP went against a bunch of toxic killers
---
No, but there are clues pointing strongly toward it. Quite a few, to boot.
---
And the amount of hard corners on the map and the positioning of the lockers make lockers actually usable, at least from a killer player's perspective. Locker plays don't feel super predictable like they are on other maps.
---
Possibly the best map for Q&amp;Q + Head On/Inner Strength plays.
---
Or maybe even nemesis could be the killer would be terrifying as shit if you‚Äôre getting chased and hear S T A R S
---
What kind of cake do you guys think the Gruesome Gateau is?
---
Yeah you only tend to get a protection stack if you're hit while unhooking. Sometimes ages away from your team you get protection points but no stack other times can be basically hugging them and it's a coin toss.
---
Pretty damn accurate tbh. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm a 4 but I pretty much only play dbd, and a lot at that.
---
What you need to do is get the stun: don't throw it unless they're within pallet range or if they try to swing.
---
Every single one of his videos is the same "DAE survivors entitled/OP xDDDD" joke
---
It‚Äôs on console too lol
---
Maybe make pages an alternative way to escape? The exit gates get powered when you collect all the pages, but slender can run at 2x speed?
---
Me and my friends went into match, found the killer and starting screwing around with him. He was a demogorgon on red forest and he kept placing portals we kept destroying them and we farmed. It was a fun match
---
Who‚Äôs the one on the far right in ‚Äúnot famous enough to be added?

More obnoxious than effective
---
&gt; Your point implied that the rank would give some insight on to how a player thinks. I'm saying this isn't necessarily the case

OK, so highest rank? I'm not sure what you are arguing. The point is pretty clear barring being pedantic about it.

I don‚Äôt think I Bill

I go Franklin's and legion when I see a bunch of items.

Meanwhile I get told to kill myself by a survivor who got angry because his teammates were swarming me with a survivor on my arm as Freddy. 
---
P.S I don't like slugging but they forced my hand.
---
E r ic
---
yes
---
People seem to forget Predators only hunts prey that is willing to fight back (aka armed with a weapon) or standing in their way. They are also more than willing to kill themselves without a second thought so I doubt the Entity could pursuance them to go against their code of honor. Aliens/Xenomorphs on the other hand just kill anything in sight like the Demogorgon so they could kind of fit.

you cant pip if you dont unhook - i mean i am doing gens if i see them camping but the killer is automatically destroying my chance to pip if he camps - so idk where the punishment lies (except for me :D)

Killer is really only a walk in the park at low ranks. High ranked survivors know how to deal with killers and juggling the survivors becomes much more difficult.
---
Now that's what I call a perk!
---
I will allow someone else to do the edits, I'm a tired man.
---
Ee rr ii cc
---
So if someone like Noob or Tru3 or Otz took a long break and their rank tanked what then? 
---
Or if someone stays in red ranks because they always play with friends better then them?
---
My point is that your point is unnecessary. Valuable input is valuable regardless of rank. Ideas and discussion should stand on it's own merit without appealing to authority.
---
I‚Äôd love to have fun as demogorgon but every game is full of fuck heads who just bully the shit out of me even when I‚Äôm using a bps for them, but then complain when I‚Äôm playing Spirit like fuck off. I don‚Äôt ever use noed and only use Moris for rituals or if I‚Äôm really really mad at a group
---
You legend, thanks ;)
---
Me and another friend were with another friend and we said we all had party streamers we put them on and the other friend brought and escape cake and he said ‚ÄúOh I tHoUgHt iT wAs tHe SaMe‚Äù so we pulled a fast one when a week later he brought bloody party streamers and we brought escape cakes and WGLF üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs really about your point of view. Both you, the killers, and the people who are bads experiences, are both rising. This means that they are getting better, just not to you
---
Yeah, whats fun? Never heard of it.
---
He‚Äôd have the power to see through the corn on the farm maps. No more corn blindness!!
---
ASS. CLENCHED.
---
I sacrificed all four people yesterday as Ghostface and the guy who sent hate mail didn't know how to be mad so he said my cosmetics sucked
---
Its a man no dude
---
Some keys like the skeleton key can open black locks aka. the hatch, and some keys cannot, but there are add on‚Äôs that give it the capability of open black locks. There are also add ons that allow you to see auras of the other survivors, or the killer sometimes too :)
---
Keys are used primarily to unlock the hatch and escape early before the hatch actually opens. You can put add ons on them to see teammates auras or the killers aura but they‚Äôre basically pointless.
---
A great combo I've found for him somewhat recently is Bamboozle(one of the Clown's teachable perks that makes it so you vault windows 15% faster and block the window behind you for 16 seconds). Meyers already has a slightly higher window climb speed than other killers when he's in berzerk mode, and with bamboozle not only completely shuts down window based loops, but often catches survivors off guard as you can hop through a window almost as fast as they can and then one-tap them.
---
Having fun gen Rush
---
What patience? You dropped every pallet in contact lol. Sure you waited a little bit but you were premature as hell. You both played that equally poorly. As soon as you took the M1 instead of camping the pallet you should‚Äôve rotated to the pallet between the cars outside.
---
Does nurse suck on counsel of something?
---
Lots of people think she's too strong, but in all honesty you really just have to play different. I've looped Rank 1 Spirits. it's not impossible like some people like to think, just harder.
---
How is nurse unplayable? It‚Äôs literally no different. It took me like 5 matches to learn how the blink works
---
To be fair I have seen it go the other way as well. 4 SWF and they dump all over the killer who gets less then 5k BPs all game the only thing with that is usually the survs only get around 12k each so yay low pts for everyone!
---
Its not as hard as everyone makes it sound
---
Self-care is reduced healing speed by 50% lol you couldn't be more wrong.
---
Well once you start getting into red ranks the survivors their our way more experienced and typically more often than not you end up escaping, so if I were you I would worry about pipping, yeah sometimes you run into a god tier killer and get recked with 5 gens left but most of the time the games are pretty fun:D
---
Holy shit nice job, would love to hear that in a game
---
I‚Äôd say Freddy talks a shit ton. Also I get a feeling the legion would taunt and run their mouths a lot.
---
Did you just use Jake‚Äôs borrowed time to save Claudette with your borrowed time? Nice dude
---
Thanks for the advice! Honestly take all I can get üòÇ
---
She‚Äôs a little harder it just makes it more chaotic üòÖ
---
Campers still aren‚Äôt rewarded with this suggestion though...if there‚Äôs more than two successful facecamp kills that‚Äôs 100% the survivors being stupid - in that case, they literally fuck up so bad they win the game for you which is fine because the whole point of the game is punishing/being punished for mistakes you or your enemy makes
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say the current system  ‚Äòencourages skillful play and competitive games‚Äô when so much of the pip system is luck based and factors in many things out of your control. For both survivors and killer
---
Reeeee
---
People just don‚Äôt want to learn how to play against her. I think it‚Äôs fun facing spirit except maybe prayer bead spirit. But the mind games are always fun with survivor or killer. Also I‚Äôm rank 2 PS4 before anyone says anything about rank. This is just my opinion though.
---
My point still stands, it's a game. Nobody gives a single shit, and the people that you described are just cunts who didn't receive enough love as kids.
---
Ping is a bitch
---
Learn to curve and zone, that‚Äôs how
---
Its hard for me bc i usually get destroyed but it allows me to practice against them with my blinking lol
---
All I've gotten was freddy splinters please help I have 6
---
Not in this case unfortunately. You have to go through the dying animation first if you are downed when adren procs and there is a delay on top of that, which makes you easy double hit fodder.
---
So if its a game why go out of your way to make it irritating to others? Somethings wrong here
---
[BEGONE THOT!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyrKeThaEJM)
---
The survivor screams
---
No, it‚Äôs a tactic.
---
They change time blinded, not time to blind.
---
I don‚Äôt think you actually love it, you just want to feel in control since you were bullied the whole game lol
---
Bruh imagine a spaceship as a map with alien
---
Dude put this on DBDgonewild. There's probably Christian kids on this forum that don't wanna see this.
---
Ahh. Good to know
---
Its fucking cringy.
---
That is uhhh a baby bill
---
Gen rush them for doing it. Dont net him more kills lmao
---
Honestly new freddy is unfun as hell, old freddy was scary and if played right was actually good. Every new freddy just uses dream pallets and avoids letting you have fun at all costs, also the new oblivious system is just stupid on him.
---
By responding with a mori, you're not only continuing the cycle, you're practically mimicking these people and being a cunt yourself.
---
This and polnareff being carried down the stairs have the same vibe
---
I love you
---
Yeah, some survivors get really salty of that kind of stuff especially 4 man SWFs. I really just wish people could tone it down a bit, both sides have to deal with some annoying stuff. It's just the way it is. Always gonna get smack talked by those swfs anyway though, win or lose. I just hit them with the quick GG and move on.
---
Xbox or PS4?
---
I don't think this is what a PSA is, but I'll allow it lol
---
But it‚Äôs retaliation most people don‚Äôt bring moris if they don‚Äôt feel like someone is going out of their way to make sure to be a toxic ass
---
You want a cookie?
---
That's the risk of running Hex perks if you can't handle the risk don't run the perk.
---
&gt; Well, survivors can use any perk and get away with it.
---
No they cannot, lol. I've been facecamped for hitting the killer with DS, running borrowed and cleansing ruin.
---
Multiple killers have facecamped me for it and asked me if I had fun afterwards to try trigger some angry responce.
---
I people get facecamped for using instameds too but frankly I also find them obnoxious so I don't use them.
---
I wish to make *big brain* plays like him one day.

Kids crushing on video game characters is one thing, the drawings on there are another level.

That‚Äôs all I wrote back and then left the conversation (PS4) and they kept adding me back lol
---
Are you a console nurse? Anyways im currently in the phase of learning my blinks. But ive also put some thought into builds (i know not too important yet until i learn the blinks)
---
But im thinking BBQ since its so amazing on her pluss the BP, whispers to help find people when i dont know where anyone is. 
---
Shadowborn to help see more of the screen when blinking and when fatigued
---
And infectious fright so i can get info of nearby survivors when i down someone. 
---
I played alot yesterday i was rank 4 and dropped all the way to rank 7 but i got some practice blinking and hitting survs, didnt 4k anyone yet tho
---
What‚Äôs the point of this post, people can‚Äôt use insta heals or something? Especially when you‚Äôre playing Ruin on Nurse. Let people do what they want lol
---
I guess you could say it was...
---
***Haunted Grounds?***
---
(i know it's EW3 but still)
---
..
---
I see this way more common with killers. survivors will just be mad if they get hard tunneled or facecamped. Killers will come up with any and every excuse they can to shift blame from just being bad and losing
---
* my ruin got destroyed in the first minute!
---
* toxic t-baggers **made me** tunnel them!
---
* flashlights made me blind for 10 minutes!
---
* OP Meta perks!!
---
* I wasn't playing nurse or spirit!
---
* I didn't have addons!
---
* broken overpowered Decisive strike !!!!
---
* genrushers!
---
* SWF is an exploit !!!! all SWF are seal team six coordinated !!
---
* broken overpowered Decisive strike !!!
---
* that was an infinite loop!!
---
* toxic Nea and blendette !!!
---
* they had a key !!
---
I would love to verse your Nurse, quality ones are in short supply imo. I‚Äôm Rank 6, so every chance to find you at some stage
---
Hey same! Her prestiged body with the newest Egypt looking hat is straight up looks
---
Complains about insta heals. Uses ruin and make your choice on nurse
---
It is leatherface. If youre lucky it‚Äôll be on the shrine of secrets and you can buy it
---
Are you illiterate or did you choose to not read the flair? I‚Äôm not complaining about it.
---
It‚Äôs Leatherface, what do you mean by ‚Äúnot in your platform‚Äù?
---
I mean I can show you all the ebonies that people brought. People are going to play the way they always do
---
Leatherface has it, but once you learn the teachable, all killers can learn it.
---
Hmmm, not sure if I get this :D
---
cock so hard right now not even jokin
---
I find this meme format deeply unsettling
---
That‚Äôs that good shit
---
Its actually kinda nice on bubba to max out deviousness from chainsaw hits pretty quick
---
Look up a video showing the FPS difference. Nothing is impossible obviously. Just not worth the effort especially when Spirit exists.
---
Your right, your right. I also have the argument that this is the only action I can do.
---
There's not a gen in heaven that Dwight can't reach
---
Uh, no silly. It‚Äôs the fact that SWF groups can communicate and coordinate. That screws killers in a number of ways.
---
Read. The. Flair.
---
You‚Äôre not complaining about it yet it‚Äôs circled on the screen?
---
Anyone remember surfing in Counterstrike?
---
Tunneling is a tactic, yet killers get berated for it.
---
The buff killers wanted
---
Also no add-ons.
---
*So...Much...Porn*
---
its a Joke Post dude
---
Most likely Switch. Switch is the only platform that does not have Bubba like console used to not have Bill.
---
Optimal gameplay wouldn't have got this clip. Sometimes I just aim to have fun. Killer is stressful enough already.
---
That‚Äôs the part of the post that‚Äôs the joke. I didn‚Äôt once say ‚ÄúI hate all the insta heals‚Äù. You‚Äôre going out of your way to make assumptions. I used the shit post flair because it‚Äôs a joke. Please, if  your gonna take my post out of context. Don‚Äôt.
---
If a retaliation does nothing good, then what's even the point? A mori will do nothing, but will give the survivors a reason to continue and be rude towards other killers. It's a cycle that continues depending on the killers' response to the situation. If a killer plays fairly, and doesn't respond with toxicity, tensions could easily be eased in-game, and possibly even in the community. And, as I have said before, it's just a game.
---
Oh really? That‚Äôs a shame, bbq is one of the best perks out there
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
I‚Äôd love having James and PH, but I‚Äôd be ok with any protagonist from the original Team Silent games, 3 was my personal favorite (even though it‚Äôs a sin to think any game but 2 was the best)
---
This man has been in [the soda game long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOvv1imQoRw)
---
And you‚Äôre also blindly defending survivors who can be equally if not more toxic what planet do you fucking live in because i cant believe you cant see your own hypocrisy
---
Upvoted for using "penultimate", good word, mate.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm at rank 12 and have gotten a rank 4 and a rank 19 in a few of my matches today.
---
360s isn't really a effective start, it just looks fancy when it does work.
---
And that god awful antialiasing they added.
---
After I hooked a Dwight in Bubba's basement, I stepped around the corner to find the other three Dwights waiting to get chainsawed
---
Me, because I'm a sadist.
---
It's a killer's game.
---
It's not like myc is the most amazing nurse perk. There is a reason most nurse mains run trackingperk.build.
---
If his dream abilities weren‚Äôt powerful, there‚Äôd be no incentive to try and stay awake, and with how many ways there are to wake up, I think it‚Äôs fine
---
At least a gen got done. I was half expecting no gens to complete in that time.
---
depends on Why you cant. A physical disability and if so, what sort?
---
Or just a reaction thing?
---
Sorry i didn't think it was that bad I've seen a lot worse things on reddit
---
Its not about going from one end to the other. Its from one gen to the other. She can hoppity hop between them so fast billy needs a runway
---
there is more to map pressure than just going to 1 side of the map to the other your test is flawed
---
Thanks man
---
Indeed
---
I‚Äôve heard it just isn‚Äôt on switch, killers have acquired all available perks and there was no BBQ to be found
---
Because every 4 man swf sweats harder than a morbidly obese man does crossing the room to get to the fridge
---
I mean still though, you're on a constant timer that puts you to sleep and every time you're hit you go to sleep. 9/10 times when i'm being chased by him i'm asleep. I'd be fine with dream pallets if it wasn't so hard to be awake.
---
Killer main here.  
---
Ghost face was like a gift from the gods to me, I liked Myers, also the pig, but they didn't really do what I wanted from a killer. Ghost face scratched that itch -really- good.  
---
The thing with GF is that you play him completely different from the other killers. I see people like truetalent even playing him completely wrong. He's a stealth killer, and you gotta play around not being seen. Stay crouched, make the survivors paranoid about not knowing where you are at all, and that they can at any moment get exposed and are pretty much insta downed when you creep up behind them and instadown them.  
---
I just came back from a long break, so I'm still trying to find a good build for him, but I feel like anything that slows generator progress is a safe bet on him, as his methods aren't always the quickest.  
---
But for player style, play him almost like if you're a survivor yourself, but against them. You get what I mean?
---
New freddy is strong af. But still pretty fun, survivors might need to learn to play around being awake now
---
Predator could definitely work but I can also agree with the list just because of how predators are generally shown as honor heavy hunters who only attack armed prey, if a baby dweet was in a predator movie he'd just get ignored by predators.
---
So, an sfw group is instantly toxic, is what you're saying. Equipping a mori because there is an sfw group is factual toxicity, because you're just being petty.
---
(And also, please use some grammar, it took me a while to read that properly)
---
I thought the map was a lot worse for killers than survivors (non stealth killers anyway)
---
I think you get assist for each other survivor you encounter for the  first time
---
It's showing DC icon and we don't get points for escape and no XP earned. Not sure if it's the same for the killers.
---
IIRC if 1 of the stairs doesn't have the hook, then it should spawn under the drop down.  Or another hook had spawned behind the wall and the min distance rule kicked in (Possibly being the basement in that case, which does spawn directly below one of those stairways in some games).
---
I tested the map a fair bit with some friends because we both felt like it had some overly well hidden totems.  We were right on that matter.  It has some of the best totem spots in the game for being invisible unless you basically stand on top of the totem for about 1/3rd of it's spots, and another 1/3rd roughly is just fairly well hidden or out of the way spots.  And then there is the hallway spots of fuck you killer.
---
Aww the blood got out of the web and flooded the whole lobby!
---
Ah the good ol CHECK YOUR GRAMMAR BOI if you‚Äôre losing an argument besides yes if you see a group that all instantly spawn in and all have flashlights that literally screams I‚Äôm gonna kill myself after this match sure one or two is fine but all 4 that‚Äôs a fat ass red flag
---
Edit: Typo
---
This post feels, weird, but funny, funnily weird? I‚Äôm not feeling comfortable. Bye.

Figured it out, I was using my

Lungs attack... only works on basic attack m1 :(

Well that‚Äôs because Devour Hope always goes first.
---
Clocks keep you awake for 90 seconds, and are almost always by a gen, meaning, if uninterrupted, you could wake up and get a gen from 0-100 before the next sleep, awake survivors waking you up is extremely efficient the first couple of times, and popping a skill check will also wake you up, using your awake time wisely is the key. Memorize where the real pallets are, and try to avoid chases and Freddy is cake
---
Try searching for and deleting that one file, then try running it. If it fails to run (probably) verify file integrity again?
---
Rank absolutely means something, play a game as Legion or Trapper at Rank 10 and Rank 1, likelihood is you would be lucky to get even 1 Kill in that Rank 1 game. It 100% absolutely means something.
---
TrueTalent - whatever people may think of him I do not fucking care - Said that the ranking in DBD is a lot like League of Legends, you will get "Golds" and "Masters" in the same team/rank, and every game is a roll of the dice to see what you would get. You just have a much higher likelihood to get "Masters" players at Red Ranks compared to say the Rank 8 you currently sit at.
---
I just thought Murphy makes sense because he out of anyone has the best Experience with chases scenes are very similar. One of his perks would revolve around dropping pallets. Pyramid Head would be amazing, his weapon would be the spear and I imagine his power would revolve around the obsession.  
---
SH3 is a good game in it's own right for sure. It's my second favorite no question. 2 is just considered better by most due to the fact that it is so drastically different from 1. 3 while written great is the first time when in the series instead of breaking past conventions, they relied on them.  
---
This review is what I mean and it's the guys favorite in the series. His work is great, check it out.

---
Going across the map every few minutes is just too much of a waste of time, at red ranks survivors need to do gens to win against a killer with a map pressure ability.
---
Christian kids shouldn't be playing dbd lol i hide the post just for you so be happy üò¢

Or he could switch between Charles lee ray and chuck, maybe lockers being replaced with good guy doll boxes

Where in the meme does it say they're using flashlights? Where in the meme does it say that EVERY SINGLE sfw group is toxic? Where does it say that I'm losing an argument, which has no real value to me?
---
If it is that would be great cuz they had the same with regular console for Bills stuff, but haven‚Äôt seen it myself.
---
I'm a noob, what is happening here.
---
Your rank progress. There are 4 circles toward ranking up or down, you can either ‚Äúpip up‚Äù and gain a circle, pip down, no pip, or double pip.
---
Omg I thought I was the only one who cringed every time he says ‚Äúdute‚Äù
---
If theres ruin and haunted grounds it is inevitable
---
Oh, you sweet summer child. That‚Äôs not even close to the worst thing I‚Äôve jerked off to, let alone in the same neighborhood as some of the stuff I‚Äôve nut to.
---
#Ultra Nut
---
He doesn‚Äôt need buffed. At the top ranks he does but he wipes the floor until purple ranks. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to balance a game from rank 1 to rank 20.
---
I want this, but I also want Hannibal as the Nightmare Stag as a cosmetic
---
I‚Äôm a nut for SH content so I‚Äôve already seen that video, and I know SH3 is far from a masterpiece, but damn that game holds a special place in my heart, I really am sad that we‚Äôll likely never see games like the OG silent hills made again.
---
PS. A power that revolves around the obsession would be a pretty sweet gimmick for PH, I just hope BHVR would be able to do some justice for the legacy of the character
---
As a piggu player: Hitting you and slugging you when I run into you is part of the 'ignore the survivor until they all have hats' strategy. Someone has to pick you up and then you have to reset searching that box or go to another one which is even more time you aren't working on a gen.
---
That being said part of the issue is Pig's own addons encourage you to tunnel survivors instead of focusing on other survivors. Like all the addons that add status effects to RBTs. She needs an addon overhaul way more than Nurse does, Nurse doesn't even need addons to kick your ass.
---
They need to add Mr.X and Rebecca.
---
Nurse is so easy to loop and confuse on that map. The strongest killers I've faced at Hawkins have been Demogorgans and Meyers, and surprisingly the best round I've played as killer on that map has been Huntress
---
Yes I love playing with a rank 20 level 1 Claudette :)
---
If you really think his dream pallets, which most people consider to be worse than the snares, are OP, I‚Äôm just going to assume you don‚Äôt bother to remember which pallets you‚Äôve thrown or have any awareness of broken pallets around the map.
---
There‚Äôs certainly some things about freddy that are slightly overtuned, but the pallets aren‚Äôt one of them.
---
Depends on the map. Open maps she has no more map pressure than regular killers. Indoor ones yeah she has more map pressure.
---
Because you see, 70% of their body is water. And Hag‚Äôs thirsty.
---
I‚Äôve only gotten off the hook one single time. I‚Äôm usually SWF so they usually come for me. Good end to your game!
---
Alright, genuinely, I had a chuckle at that one
---
Thank you.
---
As soon as I got a add in that‚Äôs what what happened lol
---
Its got enough long hallways to allow un-breakable stalks mid-chase, as well as places on the map where you can stalk from above/below and through glass/grates.
---
It's also got some extremely long loops if someone has balanced landing and certain generators are impossible to sneak up on. So it's a little give and take.
---
Tunneling is when the killer goes after one survivor to the exclusion of all others.
---
very very situational so I never use it, but I know it is used frequently for people who feel like they get slugged a lot
---
If you think there‚Äôs little to no difference between a rank 10 and a rank 1, you‚Äôve got a long way to go my dude
---
Im rank 11 and I get grey ranks for days
---
It will always be my second favorite. I hope to god with this Renascence of horror games, SH will get it's own too.   
---
A RE2 level remake for SH2/3 would bring me great joy.
---
#Uhduuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuud
---
A gateau
---
Bring Decisive, if you're the obsession killers are more likely to slug, which then Unbreakable comes into play
---
this made me choke I laughed so hard
---
Thanks for that lol ‚úåÔ∏è
---
You're assuming that the first survivor wasn't already unhooked, and that the fourth is gonna be altruistic. You're thinking best case scenario there, and wasting  up to 30 seconds in a chase only to get 5 second stun and possibly losing your target or having them run to a safe location is a momentum killer, especially if you're going against decent survivors.
---
As someone who repeatedly creampied when RE2 remake launched, I could hope for nothing better than SH2/3 getting the same treatment, unfortunately Konami is far more interested in Pachinko machines. Really wish they‚Äôd sell the rights to a developer that cared already
---
It's cool, but why can't I zoom in?
---
This is actually crazy. I never knew that that was possible.
---
Ha that would be cool but I bet jaring for anyone who hasn't seen the show xD
---
Right? I wish they would give it to Capcom or perhaps whoever makes Outlast. I would love to see the Emperor Of Horror return.
---
Michael Myers?
---
Monto‚Äôs Scratched Mirror Myers video this exact thing happened and it was funny as hell.
---
Good for you buddy
---
I feel. I really need to learn using the flashlight but it's frustrating to fukk up so much before I may finally work it out. At least left-turn 360s are running quite smoothly for me lately.
---
The only map that makes me consider DCing. Hell, one of the only things that make me want to DC.
---
I literally made this myself...
---
enduring + spirit fury other 2 perks are up to u
---
I guess spirit fury, enduring and brutal strength if you want get rid of them fast. Maybe run save the best for last for attack cool down. If you pounce your obsession you don‚Äôt lose stacks.
---
Eric Andre approved
---
BIRD UP
---
Any tips / wisdom to share on playing the Plague well?
---
brutal dont work with pounce but stbfl ks good
---
Why can't trapper be like Roadhog? Let him tie a rope around his traps to throw and hook survivors.
---
too easy?
---
It‚Äôs why I main her now
---
Yup sure is lol but like sticking with the theme of every killer being called ‚Äú the (something) ‚Äú I figured ‚Äú The Tyrant ‚Äú fit pretty well
---
You haven't seen my Laurie nodding sadly at your portal yet
---
I feel like the "basic bitch" build would be Enduring and Spirit fury. The other two perks would be up to you I suppose. I'd recommend Pop Goes the Weasle and BBQ for my other two.
---
Survivor mains be so salty in the comments
---
I theorize that it may be something like ''The Fear''
---
I was just referring to breaking pallets  regularly
---
that might be a Test for my determination
---
While I would love the thing, I feel a lot of the effect that movie had was from the ‚Äúwho is the thing‚Äù aspect, which would not work in game because of SWF.
---
Everyone falls for traps at any rank. Traps are satisfying
---
Are you going for adept or just playing in general?
---
I guess I was sorta expecting the collapse to go straight to 0.
---
I never said flashlights aren't toxic, but bringing a mori just because you happen to encounter a 4-man sfw is toxic. It's like you also didn't read anything that I've said about a cycle, and the continuation of toxicity in this god-forbidden community.
---
/facepalm
---
this Jeffree star wannabe ass xD
---
Well looks like we‚Äôve reached a stalemate i guess i see your points but i hope you see mines and understand why some killers give that extra effort against SWF groups because that communication is a life saver compared to 4 randos
---
nah b4 that it used to give BT to both the unhooker and the unhooked thats when it was really BS
---
That's why he's my main &lt;3
---
OK, this one made me laugh.
---
The inverted controls thing means you accidentally hit your touchpad, touchpad inverts controls
---
Any vampire would be a good addition honestly. Dracula, Nosferatu, a Strigoi, or even a vampire monster.
---
if its been less than a minute since the unhook, thats usually not a bad idea anyway because otherwise they might have decisive strike
---
Yeah, it is getting kinda old and fueling a lot of the toxicity in the community lately. Reading the comments on his videos are not good for one's health.
---
A friend just showed this to me as you commented!	I was surprised at first; I haven't heard of someone needing to invert axis on the fly.
---
Thank you for the heads up!
---
He always looks like he's angrily walking to the grocery store, to me.
---
"Gotta get fucking milk, bread, cereal, and of course Phillip didn't tell me that we were out of fucking toilet paper. I gotta do everything around here."
---
I suppose we have reached a stalemate. I'm sorry if I sounded mad or anything, but I really just don't see some of the reasons behind the toxicity towards some sfw groups. Farewell to you, and have good luck in your future trials.
---
Its alright i also wish you luck in other games glad we could solve this
---
Quentin thinks Nancy is his Nancy, Nancy thinks Quentin is Jonathan, new head canon.
---
Don't worry, one time i had a Laurie say she reported me for wallhacking because "there is no possible way you could've known exactly where i was hiding."
---
I was playing Doctor.
---
Excuse me, what the fuck?
---
Which killer is Bubba?
---
Can relate
---
Interesting... thank you for your explanation.
---
I will try when I can, thanks. :D
---
Ok
---
I have tenacity as well but I just can't get any use because I just get instantly picked up
---
W O O F
---
Haha okay thank ya
---
Her chase potential lends to her map pressure. Quickly ending a chase and hooking a survivor grants a shit ton of map pressure
---
Such as?
---
Ok but you're literally describing a ranking system working as intended; camping leatherface is in lobby with 4 new players, they fall for it, leatherface double pips, repeat until the survivors are good enough not to fall for it, camping leatherface plateaus/depips
---
That's reunited. Assist is whenever you're close to an injured/hooked survivor. I think.
---
I‚Äôm right handed so I flipped my controls on PS4 from the default. I find R1 hits better than L1 so I switched my skill check and run buttons. That might help ya a bit.
---
yeah I made a pretty bad typo there lol. Maybe if we ever get Jason we'll get a lake in his map
---
They‚Äôre not ‚Äúcatering‚Äù to it and it is hardly toxic to play with your friends.
---
It should be a hex that spawns When you get 4 tokens
---
She is on console versions, but not on PC.
---
Sure!
---
1. If you're chasing a survivor who isn't fully infected yet, 8/10 times it's a better idea to keep vomiting on them, rather than smacking them before they're broken. In most cases your total chase time will actually be a lot lower if you just focus on trying to get them fully infected, since you're denying them the speed boost on hit when you do land the one shot on them.
---
2. Survivors will usually either never cleanse, or cleanse way too aggressively. We punish people who never cleanse by running Thanatophobia and making their unsafe unhook attempts even more dangerous, and we punish people who cleanse too aggressively by going out of our way to drink from the corrupt fountains.
---
   1. To those who think never cleansing is the correct move, it's really not. The common argument is that it 'Turns Plague into a normal M1 killer', but I think that's a pretty overly simplified view. Yes it means she won't have access to her ranged attack, but it also means that everyone is constantly one shottable, AND she gets visual + audio cues that make it easy to track survivors. If you're afraid of triggering a haunting grounds, you should be afraid of never cleansing vs a Plague.
---
3. Despite the fact that Corrupt and Vile Purge both have the exact same physics, in general you should be using Corrupt purge a bit differently. The goal with Vile Purge is to hit the survivor with as much vomit as we can, thus giving us the max amount of additional infection possible. The goal with Corrupt Purge is to just flat out hit them, as the amount you hit them with won't do any additional damage. Therefore, when using corrupt purge, you should pretty much always be shaking your camera kind of like Adiris is a sprinkler. Otzdarva shows the technique here: [https://youtu.be/0DgJ0ZqCLTY?t=389](https://youtu.be/0DgJ0ZqCLTY?t=389)
---
   1. That technique is occasionally also useful for Vile Purge, namely when trying to hit a survivor from far away who isn't infected at all yet.
---
4. Make the most use of a charged up vomit attack. Even if you're trying to hit a survivor, see if you can also infect some objects nearby while you're at it. This will maximize the infected objects on the map, as you can basically infect things as an afterthought to trying to infect a survivor.
---
5. Lastly, and this is a pretty simple tip; when you've infected a generator, keep an eye on the survivor statuses in the bottom left corner. It will let you know if an uninfected survivor has started repairing the gen. I hope most people already knew that, but just in case &lt;3
---
Ooh, that could be really good! Thank you!!
---
So do gens?
---
The current system definitely encourages skillful play and competitive games.  It's designed to reward killers for playing aggressively and hooking each survivor multiple times.  It's designed to reward those of us that pressure gens instead of camping hooks by rewarding your Lightbringer and Punishing your Hook emblem respectively.  These factors aren't out of your control as killer they're playstyles.
---
Perfect, thank you! I am on the PlayStation 4
---
like i said already, know where the flashlight is coming from, turn 180 degrees and pick them up, the survivor probably wont have time to get to the other side of you
---
he has like 2 of them
---
Lmfao there's a rabbit mask in the cosmetics store
---
Be afraid of the man who brings his fists to a knife fight
---
Not a problem. Best of luck.
---
I love the Idea of the racoon city streets as a m√£o
---
It would be pretty cool
---
He might be a red rank 20
---
In my experience, I find that Unbreakable is literally never useful, except for the very next match after you remove it from your load out.  That is always the one match where having Unbreakable would have saved you and won the game.
---
don't you find it boring to go against the same killer over and over?
---
They should just make a penalty to escaping early on a trap by yourself instead of completely removing it
---
Ya, I did too, did to see any so I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. And out of all my play time this weekend, it‚Äôs only now happened
---
Itll probably end faster if you force the survivors out of the gate though rather than waiting for them to play chicken with the end game collapse timer
---
I went against your advice like a dunce.. got any bleach my friend?
---
Yes they do. It's recent.
---
The hitboxes are fine, you‚Äôre just messing up with your placements
---
I guess killers should rage anytime there's instaheals, purple keys, purple maps, purple flashlights, SWF, Squadettes, hexes found in first 30 seconds, body block brigade, balanced landing, looping, borrowed time, Adrenaline, etc. too then because we wouldn't want the killer to have a bad experience either would we?
---
Hell i guess i should just not even bother with Nurse at all since i'm on ps4 and ps4 nurse is already a handicap to begin with :P
---
You're seriously making excuses for just giving up at the first sign of a challenge.
---
But i'm not gonna keep arguining in circles with you. If you wanna rage quit like a baby and make excuses because you need every match to be in your favor and not be too difficult for you, that's up to you.
---
Actually tho I‚Äôll take the free hit ;)
---
Sometimes, sure. That's why I play 20 ping lobbies and it still happens.
---
So youd dc against a normal clown, legion and doctor which are all one the weakest killers in the game, but youd only dc against a spirit if she has prayer beads? Not even mentioning nurse or anything. Kinda dumb
---
Not Steve‚Äôs gorgeous hair from the show!
---
Mans got some long ass toes.
---
Yeah! Let's add Leon! Another guy shown to fight back with anything from fists to guns! AND HAVE HIM RUN AROUND DOING JACK ALL.
---
This is a lot of extra work for survivors. You'd need to add a third hook state or some way to ensure survivors don't die too quickly with extra steps needed for gens. It might be fine at higher ranks but low rank peeps would definitely suffer.
---
I guess that depends on the killer really. Some killers have utterly useless add-ons, some have add-ons that pretty much break the game
---
My exact thoughts
---
Was just about to get on too. Oh well
---
I guess perks because you don‚Äôt lose them at the end of the trial?
---
Playing against her is a guessing game. You can't really do much to counter her except using Iron Will.
---
Remember dying is **part** of the **process**, you get blood points regardless if you **Died** or **Won**
---
I've downed several survivors doing this. Some people don't expect it.
---
Great use of that horn from The Munsters theme song.
---
So the Nea is a killer meme derives from a couple of things
---
- People think she's so ugly so she has to be a killer as most killers are ugly. This is where most people are coming from. 
---
- There was a glitch a couple of years back that allowed Nea to get killer perks in her blood webs. Not many know this part but it's probably what started the meme.
---
Hope I helped!
---
I would want the xenomorph pennywise and I wouldn‚Äôt mind the creeper
---
You were a rank 1 killer...how is facing rank 14's possibly going to help you?  It's like clubbing baby seals to go back up to that rank from where you were at I don't care if it's a new killer or not.  They are so potato at yellow ranks man they are still learning the game.  You could not use your power and just M1 them and you'd still probably be good.  Playing opponents that beneath your skill level wouldn't teach you a thing except how to smash new players that don't know loops and can barely hit good skillchecks.
---
Now test how long it takes billy to visit every generator on haddonfield compared to nurse.
---
Sadly, I can only 180 as I play with no mouse. Still &gt;:(
---
when you DS but suddenly you can see the killers aura after a gen pops
---
If you go for the save and don‚Äôt have BT, you should take the hit for them, try to get their attention
---
I guess I'm just extremely lucky
---
genuinely curious why the majority of the community says rank doesn't matter and then proceeds to bitch about matchmaking non stop. Is it just another case of people bitching for the sake of bitching?
---
read the post smarty
---
get everyone to 40 first imo, some don‚Äôt even need to get all teachables. get monitor and abuse, ruin, bbq, nurses etc. then choose whoever you like the best
---
It‚Äôs happened to me several times this weekend. Absolutely crazy.
---
No it‚Äôs because I hate going against those killers. I also only dc against a prayer beads spirit since it‚Äôs the little counterplay she has. Also most of the time I‚Äôll only dc against a clown if he has the exhaustion/ether addons. Doc and legion are immediate dc tho
---
its not
---
Havent really played recently. But you are right. DS should've made meg priority for obsession if you dont have an obsession perk. Either that or obsession is now totally random.
---
I mean that will happen to you with any exhaustion perk if you are fixing the last gen so I‚Äôd says it ok together
---
which side is complaining about body blocking? because both killers and survivors can body block in some way lol
---
If they ever give billy UR addons one should allow for something like this.
---
Yeah but when a survivor is in dying state the timer pauses or shows you how much time is actually left I found out
---
Bust it Nanciana
---
Hahaha funny same fucking regurgitated joke ahahahahhahahahah
---
Nothing like Trapper pounding someone anus to the galaxy.
---
Karma is karma my dude
---
Wow, on PS4 too? Is he free?
---
Ya man. Consoles been flooded with Bills ever since they put him on.
---
lmao
---
Get an exhaustion perk instead of bond/spinechill
---
I have ruin and bbq. So I should level nurse and doc first?
---
Ghostface*
---
It‚Äôs not just you. Everyone I know playing SWF this weekend has had issues
---
yup, stbfl is also super underrated
---
Yeah but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using him, he‚Äôs easily the loudest survivor and pretty much a free kill for any killer wearing a headset
---
For real
---
True it generally only works on potatoes.
---
I don't know half of these motherfuckers.
---
There's only one way to have control in this game.  Play killer.
---
I was a survivor main for over a year.  I hated playing killer and thought it was stressful.  
---
Then I finally realized that killer was the way to go if you want to earn BP.  Once I got the hang of killer I found it to be way less stressful.  Sure, the occasional SWF combined with a super safe map can lead to disaster...but then it's back to normal lobbies.
---
Your intentions might not be bad but the end result would be the same.  They wouldn't stand a chance up there.  They're defenseless.  All I ask is if you ever depip to do this be nice up there!  Remember you can like doublepip off a 1k with how weak their emblem requirements are.  And please let's drop the persecuted killer thing at the end there.  You are proposing a go immediately to derank free card to the game for killers and I know for a fact it would be abused.  We see the trolls on this sub daily that would take advantage of a mechanic like that to grief baby players.  I just don't see how it would be healthy for the game.
---
Lmao gen rush
---
Neither of those worked, but a fresh install worked a treat, thanks for the suggestion though :)
---
And the killer can be Pete. He's a prick anyways.
---
Why doc and legion? Theyre so weak, docs power isnt really that useful in chase and legion doesnt have a power at all midchase. Also, hitting docs skillchecks aint hard if thats your problem, you just gotta get used to it. Clowns also one hella weak killer. Yea, you have to drop pallets early and yeah he might give you exhaustion but 1. hes still getting genrushed like shit and 2. how bout you dont rely on your exhaustion perk at once and actually learn to survive without it,it saves you a perkslot, too. I can understand a dc against spirit with prayer beads though. Strongest addon in the entire game with literally no counterplay except for *maybe* gentabbing which however makes you repair slower so its still kinda dumb. I dont dc against those but Im not mad if someone does,its totally understandable.
---
The timer desynced. It's a bug that's been happening since the last patch, the timer gets stuck so survivors don't actually know how much time they have left
---
It messes up about 1/3 of the time on xbox
---
I did it  My 1st couple of games playing as the killer but after that I stopped doing it
---
What
---
I would replace adrenaline or spine chill with an exhaustion perk to help with chases (I recommend Dead Hard)
---
I mean when you're new at it it's understandable, if still a little dickish lol.
---
Don‚Äôt worry their just stranger things fans
---
Oh okay! "Hell in a handbasket"? üòÇ
---
Since I am afraid of a downvote fest, similar to what happened in the DbD forums, I basically lost my mouse plug in for laptop, which I am still looking for. And I am too used to playing without mouse, as I feel more comfortable doing generators without a mouse.
---
Usually, without a mouse, certain killers are more powerful or weaker than they usually are.
---
I find killers like Nurse, Myers, and Ghostface to be the most fun to play against.
---
(Wraith, Bubba, Spirit, Demo, Freddy, Billy, Pig, and more are decent tier fun)
---
I hate facing Huntress, for I can never dodge her hatchets &gt;:( And Hags and Trappers, I HATE going against them in general, as I always get nervous against them (I ironically never step in Trapper traps) and I usually get potato teammates when I face these guys. Only had 2 matches (1 each) that I remember ALMOST surviving (thanks to lucky jukes and hitboxes, plus gen rushing)
---
What usually happens is that doing chases, I can look behind myself only sometimes, so I rely on Spine Chill to figure out the killer's next moves. I use the red stain or pallet situations to know when to 180, which I can either go do a full turn. (I have noticed that I can continually do this, but only if the killer is bad at tracking my pattern) This way, the shorter the turn, the easier it is to dodge the M1 attack. If I go too long with the juke, I always get hit. I also can fake one way then instantly 180 the other way, which saves me a lot.
---
But usually, if the killer backtracks or mindgames, I will fall for it 75% of the time. Infinites and jungle gyms are usually my safe places.
---
I mainly play for epic saves and generator objectives. I am a decent runner, but I suck at basic loops.
---
This is kinda like a hard mode if one looks at that this way. When I played with a mouse one time a month ago, I found dodging Huntress Hatchets and performing Jungle Gym loops to be much easier, but I was too unused to it, so I died that match eventually :/
---
EDIT:
---
Examples of some of my jukes that kind of work:
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/LazySwissOryxSwiftRage](https://clips.twitch.tv/LazySwissOryxSwiftRage) (I was that Jake against a dev :D I died on first hook though, but that last gen was 95% &gt;:( I should have tried to loop that pallet first though)
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pw6lSjzZo0&amp;t=4498s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pw6lSjzZo0&amp;t=4498s) 
---
And from 55:16 to 1:13:40, I was the blue Meg who took advantage of the corn to juke the Huntress a bit, and it directly shows that juke at 1:11:45, though it looks very delayed in the Huntress' part. 
---
My laggy perspective of that match too:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCNvoikXGJ0&amp;t=1031s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCNvoikXGJ0&amp;t=1031s) 
---
And that's how I am surviving and highest rank achieved in 9 months so far is rank 10 :D (Stupid tunnelers, disconnectors, and bad spawn points though &gt;:(
---
This Pennywise/Tony Hawk thing is almost definitely a false flag by BHVR. No different than how they put "The Teacher" in the game code to fuck with data miners a while back. They know the community has sniffed out the past 3 licensed properties (well, Ash THEY fucked up on) and they see how we've been doing it. So, they're using those avenues (posting in the forums about a skateboarding killer + tony hawk tweet, following Stephen King + deleting posts about Pennywise on the forums, etc) as a purposeful distraction while they actually get ready to release a DIFFERENT licensed property.
---
It probably fucks with their legal contracts to have these LICENSED products revealed early; even if they're not the ones revealing them. So they're probably trying to put a stop to these "early reveals" as much as possible.
---
I also have that. Myers is my first 50. Debat7ng weather or not to prestige him or not.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a build for fun, or just to mess with flashlights, if you want to win you wouldn‚Äôt use these perks lol. I personally like fire up (even though it‚Äôs pretty trash) bc you can stack it with brutal strength or bamboozle. If you want a build to play as intended, use the meta perks like ruin, pop, noed, haunted, etc.
---
Technically lightborne might be useful in getting them to keep trying since its 99.9% impossible to actually blind.
---
Demogorgon
---
This and being randomly taken back to the main menu and losing everything for that game has really put a dampener on the weekend. Ya boy just wants bloodpoints.
---
Ye, DS in an anti-tunnel perk, but if you hit a killer that didn't tunnel you with it you're sure to get tunneled into the ground
---
For me it was more like they're just like really old buddies and the entity just dm'd the mind flayer if he could borrow one of his dogs
---
As a ghostface main, this happens way too much
---
yea old fred boi is pretty great now I would even put him at 3rd best killer now! great job Btw
---
U fuqqing made me laugh gg mate
---
There are perhaps some tweaks that need to be made, but all in all this sounds like a cool concept, and anything PH related makes me rock hard so...
---
What platform are you on? I‚Äôm on Xbox and I‚Äôve been dc‚Äôd when I hook people, exit Frenzy as Legion, etc
---
*5 seconds into the game* 
---
#BOOM BOOM BOOM
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
Glad I can help
---
&lt;3
---
That's humanity as a whole tbh, mostly dickheads
---
Damn that sucks, but good on you for helping your dad.  
---
I was lucky enough to chill all day.  It's been a stressful few weeks of work with no reprieve in sight.  I've been leaving for work at 5:45 am and getting home around 8:30-9 pm.  Wake up, drive, work, drive, get home and sit down for 45 minutes, go to sleep...repeat.
---
True. At this point, I‚Äôm convinced that the game is reading my mind and gives me useless shit instead of what I need. I don‚Äôt want Spies from the Shadows, BHVR. Stop it!
---
Bloody good head-on play that was noice!
---
It's an apron
---
&gt;3 green perks
---
Specifically the ultra rare key and the very rare key are able to open the hatch while the  rare key cannot
---
well done
---
What do I think? I think the guy with the skeleton key is probably sad now. Good job though, definitely a good killer now
---
I take the bait &amp; take it as a challenge. If they want to swarm a downed survivor or a hook it's only a matter of time before the snowball effect takes place.
---
Maybe you should stop playing then? Sounds like you aren't having fun
---
That's a good idea, and I agree it's a little weak on its own, but paired with some other game slowing perks (like ruin and than) it becomes a real menace.
---
I feel like if it got buffed it would be too good with the aforementioned perks. So it isn't really an issue of the perk itself being problematic, but similar ones that can really tip it over the edge when used together.
---
If I were to change it, I would reduce the obsession's bonuses just a little overall. Maybe drop them to like 25 or 30%. A small buff, but still a buff. MAYBE make the obsession be affected by it.
---
As for my thoughts on the changes from old dying light: I'm sad to see a unique perk scrapped, but it was a very healthy change. Tunneling is no fun to play against, and it was really the only perk that encouraged it.
---
I now run it in a lot of my builds. I love the way the icon looks and seeing that counter go up is satisfying.
---
It's almost guaranteed after you unhook someone
---
nnnnrnrrrrBWAAAAHHHH
---
Happy Bloodhunt here's 20 ebony mori matches in a row lololol. This event has been.... fun.... Have to make jokes about it I suppose.
---
I'm sorry but IMO do not use bamboozle on Myers. As was already said, you get a vault buff from T3 it is a waste of a perk slot to stack it on top. The T3 buff is plenty fast enough for vaulting, if you really need to catch someone via window pop T3 to seal the deal. But frankly you shouldn't be vaulting with Myers unless you are interrupting a survivor's loop. More importantly blocking windows forces survivors to take routes that are not advantageous to the killer or will just abandon a loop all together heading to the next loop/pallet where your bamboozle is now useless. It's better to mind game the window keeping the survivor as close as possible. 
---
If they think there is no reason to stay at a loop they will leave and find a better loop. Why stay at a loop with a blocked window? Good players will only need to *hear* bamboozle go off, not even see it, and they are gone. You want to end the chase as fast as possible not send the survivor to the next loop.
---
I hit because a video I watched said it is better to get brutality points that way. Not sure how accurate that is but it sounded good at the time.
---
Got a perk idea, 
---
Knows alot about that:
---
If a survivor stops working on a generator when it's under 40/45/50 percent, the next time a survivor works in that generator they will receive a skill check with No warning noise ( as big as new decisive strike) failing this skill check will get rid of 4/6/8 percent of total progress
---
That have most likely already left the game. Brilliant!
---
Ye, I can ways check with a friend. But with trapper a 40 I am still leaning towards him.
---
Ahhh tried to do this when I saw Spine Chill and tried to reveal a Ghostface through a window.
---
I died.
---
Yes, why the fuck are you using ebony motors during 2x bloddpoints? So weird. I just dashboard when i use a BPS/ cake and I see a hidden killer offering, like wtf are you doing man? Why would I let you reap my offering while you just fuck me over with yours? Blows my mind
---
That happens literally every time I reload the game, it is very annoying. Lol
---
I appreciate a good killer. I‚Äôm not a very good survivor, but the point of the game is to either kill or be killed.
---
But you should still have your bloodpoints... There is nothing to reimburse unless it is a different bug. Lol
---
Ping
---
May I ask how?
---
Level meg but play Claudette. Don't use self care Its one of the worst perks in the game.
---
 Thanks for that lol ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Level 20 Survivor excited to play the game vs Rank 1 Survivor who just wants to die.
---
Me
---
Same here though it only happened once. I don‚Äôt believe anyone anymore in the chats.
---
This would make unrelenting the true god perk lol
---
I can't stop laughing at this! it was so unexpected! xD
---
Well it's still good. It really was never a terrible perk.
---
Honestly I want to dc if my ruin gets broken early, if I'm not playing billy, Freddy, or hag that is because I don't use ruin on those killers anyways.
---
&gt;you can moonwalk to a hook to avoid a flashlight
---
You could just look down or up and still see where you're going instead.
---
You... I endorse you

I finally met a nice Bubba in such a long time that didn't camp or tunnel to mori :D 
---
He was actually pretty chill, as all Bubba players that don't camp or tunnel are. \^\^
---
But you're not ignoring. You've replied three times now you clown
---
while I agree it is strong with those perks. the perk becomes decent but ruin as a perk can go down instantly and make dying light below average again. thana is a below average perk on its own with dying though it becomes a decent perk
---
That's to spooky for me
---
It‚Äôs a Claudette soooo....
---
What‚Äôs with all the dc‚Äôs tonight? It‚Äôs literally a blood hunt, even if you scrub out you get more than you normally would.

Billy Hawk's Pro Sawyer 5
---
On a normal keyboard I think they default key for inverting controls is the 'I' key. I'm pretty sure I've unbound mine, since I would never use that function.
---
If they didn't tunnel, they wouldn't get hit by it.
---
Even if you do tunnel and play smart and slug, your fine.
---
Also appreciate the advice üëçüèªüòÅ
---
Oh boy! With all those BNP they can get a single gen done!
---
r/dbdgonewild IS the Holy Water
---
Because survivors have a lot of resources to put between them and the killer to slow the killer down.
---
I have seen this thing a few times, why does the timer act like that sometimes?
---
Oooh! I like that one!
---
Thanks for that lol ‚úå
---
Most of the time DS activates without tunneling. A minute is a long time and survivors running it like to turn into a potato that runs into the killer when it's active. They are asking to get tunneled
---
Yeah that map is a hellhole for survivors. The killer can patrol three gens for the entire game and still get all four survivors. Then again, you could probably do that on any map.
---
Oh wow! Okay - maybe the guide I read was out of date then. Cheers! I was thinking of replacing a perk with light weight for reduced scratch marks when pulling survivors off the hook and running  Or spine chill. So I might try losing that one.
---
The pumpkin knows what's updog
---
What a dick.
---
First post in a while that correctly lined up text with the image

You idiot, he was trying to get the obsession to save the guy hooked but they just left instead. Lol
---
The timer is bugged for survivors. For her it looked like she's got like \~10% of time left to leave. It is a confirmed bug.
---
Prestiging does next to nothing  for rarer addons in my experience. In the case of Claudette you get a very very dark prestige skin that makes hiding on most outdoor maps very easy. you'd need to get to P2 though and that is a LOT of blood webs.
---
I played mostly killer and only recently started playing and leveling up survivors.
---
If you have a build on Claudette that works, there is no harm in sticking with it and leveling up other survivors for their teachables. If you can help it, at least level them up enough to have 3 or 4 perk slots if you want to spread out and play with their perks. 
---
You will probably want one so called exhaustion perk in your build that boosts your movement speed at the start of a chase.
---
If you level up Meg you will get [Sprint Burst](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sprint_Burst) which is not bad, but it activates the second you start running, so you must play around that. I hate it.
---
I think [Balanced Landing](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Balanced_Landing) or [Dead Hard](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_Hard) are the meta exhaustion perks right now, but I could be wrong.
---
Only time I‚Äôd consider a build truly toxic is when it includes a mechanically broken perk and the person knows this and uses it because it‚Äôs exploitable 
---
Example: a while back when wake up was broken and provided a speed bonus to all actions instead of just opening gates
---
You have to be healing with the medkit
---
how do u feel about above changes I suggest?
---
and you can also use it when they are on the ground so you dont need deerstalker
---
Best thing I have seen all year
---
Well time to become broke again!
---
Cheers. Might think about levelling up other characters then, particularly for that dead hard
---
Does Migraine go up to 100%, making skillchecks straight up impossible, or do they at least keep the Great zone intact?
---
This one is a bit tricky. You need to start the healing action first and THEN press the skillcheck button (space by default on PC)
---
So it is not really instant, there is a short (less than 1 second) delay, but that can get you killed.
---
And don't forget the aura you project when you're at full health!
---
A giant talking cat out to murder ? Hell yeah dude
---
Nurse, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, Make Your Choice lol you have absolutely no room to complain ahout survivors using items.
---
Which addon does the Hag equip that causes survivors to scream?
---
I- please tell me you‚Äôre joking ;-;
---
Some people don't need bloodpoints though.
---
Playing legion on Lampkin is a special kind of hell
---
Whoa. I need more coffee. Read your post again, sounds like you are doing it right.
---
Maybe check in your keybindings if you deleted something by accident. If you find nothing, reset to default, try it with the space bar and if that does not work I don't know. \^\^
---
Then I get to purple ranks where one person pallet loops me with a flashlight while their friends gen rush me. I'm only rank 10 right now because it got so frustrating that I quit for awhile. You have to go someone who can stop chases or run perks that help end chases which takes the fun out of the game. I shouldn't have to run the meta if I want a chance of winning.
---
*Big Air +200 Pts!*
---
Wrong sub
---
you have to add "Does not stack" at the bottom for that to be the case
---
i dont play that game but fuck thats a smart sub name
---
r/lostredditors
---
No it isn‚Äôt, It‚Äôs the Kim k sex tape.
---
If I can add to this as a killer. Just cus you burn a party streamer doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm gonna farm with you
---
on PC, open the image in a new tab, hold CTRL and move your mouse wheel up (at least works like that on chrome)
---
If you do 3 gens, unhook one survivor (maybe even heal him) and have a decent enough chase, you will always pip.
---
And in the higher ranks, survivors are way more competent. Or so I was told. 
---
But I agree that Solo survivor can be miserable and if you have a bad game, you have a REALLY BAD game.
---
1. Oh god a sneaky player 
---
2. You and your mates should be far away from each other, now his powers often useless. And in chase hes just a normal m1 killer. I dont know about the addons cause I never use addons but the only thing I found annoying as a surv was that addon that makes your terror radius present on the entire map
---
3. Its not that bad to get in his gas once. I mean,take a hit, now you know his addons and how to play.
---
im hard now
---
No, all progress was lost. Rank, bloodpoints gained (and spent), shard progress from player level rank ups, everything. I‚Äôve been reimbursed before for the same issue. They can track game time from point in time A to point in Time B and figure out that you‚Äôve lost progress. I lost nearly 4 hours of double bloodpoints time
---
Did you make the same post twice and just change one letter in the title??
---
Hey I play on Switch and PS4. BBQ and All of Bubba's and Freddy's perks are in the game. They are currently broken though. For some reason the game won't spawn the perks sometimes in the bloodweb and you might have to wait until they fix it or the game gives up and spawns it for you
---
This is why I love Iron Will.
---
Ussylis has some nice guides on youtube, tru3talent if you can figure out what the fuck he is saying lol fungoose seems very about the being educational life when he can get a match but he has yt uploads farmerjohn for casual content for sure please stay away from ochido unless you want to literally shitpost yourself
---
Wait you can get the offerings on console?
---
Wtf xD i put minecraft on the community, woops xD
---
thanks
---
I thought the current one stays active after the obession dies but you no longer can gain stacks
---
"rOCk oP!"
---
What movie is this?
---
I wish huntress‚Äôs lullaby didn‚Äôt give a notification, I feel it would be much better that way.
---
Huh really? I never notice that
---
Yeah I can pip up but I shouldn't have to carry the game just to be left behind. That's 1000+ bloodpoints down the drain.
---
The editing on this was great.
---
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs throw a little *teeeeee-bag* in there for ‚Äòya!‚Äù
---
Don‚Äôt have it yet
---
lol fair but do be mindful that she still does have a learning curve but she is well worth it. She a blast and strong she #2 on pc and #1 on console for a reason!
---
something you should definitely do is only get A nurses calling 2 on her. It makes her aura read the same as her terror radius so survivors healing  will only be able to hear the TR if the volume is way up for them but it will sill count as in TR so no whoosh noise.
---
For real. Yesterday I had a game where the timer ended with more than half of it remaining. I was in the basement, desperately looking for a key and then BOOM. Nearly gave me a heart attack.
---
maybe they mean survivors blocking other survivors? rather than the killer? in which case i would agree that would constitute griefing
---
It isn't enough to prevent abuse and honestly it isn't a necessary feature.  Just whip out new killers at rank reset.  If you should pip you will, if you shouldn't it won't and you'll be where you think you need to be anyways.
---
A claudette teabagged me after she prematurely dropped a few pallets (including killer shack and an infinite). naturally I returned the favor each time I downed her
---
Poor No0b3 is gonna be so mad...
---
You're right that you can just avoid the flashlight, but the beauty of the perk is that you make survivors waste their time (and flashlight) trying to go for a blind that will never happen.
---
Sure, you *could* just face a wall when picking up a survivor, but with Lightborn that dingus will run out of hiding and fail miserably, wasting his time and likely setting up another chase for you.
---
100% agreed on Fire Up, though. That perk is just so, so bad.
---
It‚Äôs good, in a better spot now I like how it used to be (health-wise) 
---
It‚Äôs a solid perk, mid game where you have around 4+ stacks is where the game slows down pretty good, especially if they haven‚Äôt found your Ruin yet. Along with Pop the game will be crazy slow.
---
nope if obsession dcs or dies u lose the perk
---
Doctor is super annoying but is also one of the easiest killers to loop, literally the only thing that can help him in a chase is using his power to shock you which prevents you from dropping a pallet or vaulting for two seconds. The problem with that is that the doctor moves slower while in treatment mode so if the killer doesn't know how to quick shock he'll just waste time. Additionally you can just throw the pallet a little early to counter his power. The doctor is called the noob stomper because he is insanely good against bad players (no offense) but he is actually one of the worst killers in the game.
---
Excessive toxicity and if all the gens are done and I have someone I‚Äôm not gonna give up the kill to possibly find another guy.
---
old as fuck meme and people still out here getting the fuckin words wrong
---
no my first post got deleted because I didnt add a flair
---
Nurse is god-awful to play on that map. The catwalks make her blinks a nightmare, and line of sight is super easy to break.
---
It's almost as if you don't lose distance when you miss a swing
---
8
---
Yeah sucks, but also context pls. 
---
How many Gens are done? 1 left? None done at all?
---
How well is the killer doing, have you all been hooked multiple times?
---
It's a glitch. Got a message complaining about this but I never left.
---
That is disappointing news. I was holding out hope for the Jeepers Creepers guy. Thanks for the info!
---
Ye
---
Had all 4 survivors die today because I camped trying to secure one kill after the gates were open. They all just stayed trying to flashlight me and save until the collapse. Could‚Äôve just given me the guy I had but I guess they didn‚Äôt like that.
---
Tf it‚Äôs been 3 hours
---
do u think the above changes should be added to it or no?
---
Nope. You'll pip just fine if you play the game as intended. 
---
Stop camping in the basement.
---
infinite confirmed plz fix
---
Unless GF is crouched, as I found out today while he stalked a random on my team.
---
&gt;You're right that you can just avoid the flashlight, but the beauty of the perk is that you make survivors waste their time (and flashlight) trying to go for a blind that will never happen.
---
Your only looking at the reward and not the risk.
---
 The risk is you practically going in with three perks, you MAY waste a survivors time by a FEW seconds, and most of the times you already would've wasted the survivors time by normal flashlight counter strats like wall hugging or you are REPLACING a entire hit you MAY of actually hit if you didn't use light born.
---
 Ultimately the reward if everything works out is the a few seconds of time that already would've been rewarded, and the 100% possibly you lost the change for a hit because you prioritized a perk, over a perk, over a strategy that doesn't require any perks.
---
If u want to, sure. Im just saying calm spirit is basically just nerfing yourself.
---
Remember to not use any add-ons when you‚Äôre still learnging her
---
The rarity of the Med kit doesn‚Äôt matter. You have to press the skill check button before the prompt ever pops up. So as soon as you start to heal yourself or someone else (with a med kit/instant add on)  automatically press the skill check button.
---
I don‚Äôt play by survivor rules
---
Tropic Thunder! 
---
HIGHLY recommend it, one of my all time favorites.
---
so you go up to the window as if you were vaulting it but instead go around the loop the same way the survivor went.For example if at shack surv on outside heading to around to go in you go up to window make them think you are vaulting to the outside pause for a second then just go around the way they are coming to hit them
---
Poor baby demi gorgen
---
So 1 powerful build is toxic? Hahahhahahahah
---
Nurse is so confusing on that map. I blink towards a person and I somehow end up in basement. Blink towards someone running upstairs? I either get teleported to the top and they run back down or the blink goes like 1 meter.
---
They do when you know how to use them üòè
---
Also to add to this, you don‚Äôt want to wait for a skill check prompt. Hit the skill check button immediately after starting the med kit healing process.
---
I feel the same. I think the game has a lot of new players still learning how to and when to do certain things.
---
To me it‚Äôs a goat when he first gets hooked
---
*MAAAAAAAA*
---
I Can't Believe How Much I Laughed At this, Thanks for posting üòÇ
---
For the most part you can just ignore that stuff, just don't knowingly use bugged addons, perks, or items. People usually call any strong or meta builds toxic. If you want to avoid OP stuff, most people at red ranks seem to agree that insta-heals are OP, Nurse's range addons are bugged, and Spirit's prayer beads have no counterplay. Anything aside from that is just people being butthurt.  
---
You can take whatever stance you want on the OP builds, since you are going to have to go up against them regardless. It's not like refusing to take an insta-heal on survivor stops you from going against prayer beads Spirit or vice-versa. Both sides use what's available to them. If you run the best stuff people will call you a tryhard, then again if you take the best you are probably trying your hardest to win. If you take the best stuff and end up playing against casual players running off meta builds, they are going to be unhappy. That's just the way it is. If you want to avoid getting dumpstered by other tryhard players that's the price you pay.  
---
  
---
Personally I play the game for fun. Sometimes I run good stuff, sometimes I take meme builds. Usually I avoid taking the creme of the crop builds because I think it makes the game less interesting. That's just my perspective.
---
Ohh shit. I did watch this movie a long time ago! Seemed familiar. It was funny. Forgot about that movie, may watch it again.
---
same, whenever I play and find someone I can‚Äôt even get my bbq stack because they happen do disconnect when I find them
---
Oh ok. So when spirit vaults the survivors dont see the vault?
---
Did so today. Against a Legion. Two people escaped, one of them being me.
---
I love Ghostface on that map. So many walls and shit which allows you to get some nice stalks and gen grabs. You can also stalk through the glass platform with the gen in the portal room. You simply stand under the gen while survivors work and it and press the stalk button while looking up.
---
I'm not sure how to respond to that.
---
NOT at all...and a total misrepresentation.
---
The "players" in this pic are clearly the dudebros in orange,  bottom right-ish...hoping but waiting for the game to come crashing down on them.
---
The poles, easily mistaken for the player base, represent the 2 coders Mscrote keeps locked in the basement giving this game CPR while he's off cavorting with people who wish he wasnt such a clinger, and attempting to "brand" himself as a successful game designer.
---
Lol.
---
Its transgender woman
---
blah blah blah greedy devs, blah blah blah dedicated servers. for all you know it was a visual bug and the collapse had been going on for the full time. stop screaming ‚Äúdevs bad, devs bad‚Äù for every minor inconvenience that doesn‚Äôt even affect you.
---
Like no joke, if there was a pregame vc, the killer would be pressured af to reveal what they are. The killer shouldn‚Äôt be able to participate but can listen in if wanted
---
RIP
---
üò¨Nobody said they were toxic. It‚Äôs just annoying. You will be hookedüëπ
---
Sadly I doubt we will, because of the Friday the 13th game
---
Look at that chad of a name brand just sitting on the log with pride
---
People don‚Äôt have fun if you make it a quick game. The only one who wasn‚Äôt mad about the quickness of the game was the one who died
---
I love running an ebony most matches. I hardly ever use them, like in about 1 every 7 matches I'll use it to either slow the game down (just a little bit) or to off a toxic survivor. Other than that, I just waste it for the simple option of having it.
---
I think the whole ‚Äút0x1c‚Äù community would probably just worsen with any form of in-lobby chats, lol.
---
so u feel running the perk to slow the game down 1 guy should just get a buff for no reason? also think about people who dc as the obsession u lose a perk because someone gets salty doesn't seem too fair.
---
Second worst killer in the game - still cry about it
---
"Everyone dc'd and the last guy killed themselves on hook"

Yeah. It's super lame. We keep getting connected then kicked. Lol come kill us üòÇ we don't mind. As long as we in the game!
---
Hitboxes are fine. If you mean the latency, you can't expect much for a P2P
---
So its basically a troll build? Good to know.
---
Yet with Xbox there is1!!!11!1 Honestly every time I legitimately accidentally tunnel (follow a random scratch trail) I end up getting hate for it
---
I thought the timer was going to glitch and kill them all, now I'm dissappointed. :/
---
Well I was able to queue in by closing and opening app again. But I get a lot of those bugs as well with I play with my friend. Where one person joins the lobby but not the other and also one person getting disconnected from the party while exiting a game
---
I love the IT idea but holy shit no
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm the survivor that escaped lol. Two people dc‚Äôd. The other person killed themselves on first hook on purpose to leave the match and I ran around and luckily found the hatch.
---
Not gonna lie, if i was working on a gen and turned around after hearing the heartbeat to see Cat in Hat chasing me I'd probably shit myself
---
&gt;I‚Äôm rank 1 buddy
---
Well you clearly are explaining well that at the end of the day rank doesn't equal skill at all. 
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt even use noed lol, but ruin, pop or dying light are necessary as a weak killer like wraith.
---
Your ignorance towards why Pop, Dying Light, and NOED are weak it honestly a statement in itself but I'll go over it anyways:
---
-Pop the WEEEZEELLL is only good if you are a killer with mobility and you have time to break the games pressure, go out od your way and hit a generator also making fast unhook unable to be punished and forcing chase or losing a survivor.
---
 This is all assuming you know what generators are being done and where you need to go and even with a mobile killer the generator doesn't complete before you get there or it's not far away.  For these reasons it's exactly why people only use Freddy really with WEEEZEELLL.
---
-NOED is weak because it forces you to only have three perks 5/6ths of the game (One generator is 1 and the gate is the 6th). If you do poorly during the game and there are enough survivors then honestly say goodbye to NOED because it's going to get popped unless it's near you. Even then however that apply to survivors if they find it immediately. Already with RNG so heavy at the start of the gate powering is a scary thing. Next, there are perks that can counter NOED still that good survivor WILL use, Such as Borrowed Time.
---
Finally if you somehow downed a survivor before exit gates are open and hooked them, you have to rely on the survivors wasting all the time looking for NOED (This is still detrimental to you as they will likely give up at low time and escape) or they coming for an unhook. There is so much RNG to make this perk as unreliable is an understatement.
---
-Dying Light, actually isn't that bad of a perk IF you are a killer that actually can dish out damage like Billy Boy or Nurse, OR if you have a Mori. If not, then this perk is going to be hell to satisfy its activation conditions and then by the time you do activate it assuming you are able to slug a survivor without any perks and they are decent 3/5ths of generators maybe even more will be done limiting your perk usage just like NOED. Although at least there's potential for it to activate before exit gates making it worth while SOMETIMES.
---
In conclusion to this idea to use Wraith with these perks BUT NOED, its completely idiotic. Although I definitely wouldn't even recommend NOED in general for any killers. 
---
&gt;Without them the gens are going to be done in 5 minutes max.
---
With the specific perks you mentioned except Bamboozle I doubt your going far in a wraith game with reliance on perks. 
---
&gt;Unless you snowball which is impossible unless the survivors make a mistake and you have enough pallets down.
---
This game is mistakes for the killer to capitalize on. It's a mistake the survivor let you find them, they whent down, and they got hooked multiple times. Make no mistake about it, unless you are Nurse the survivors play you not the other way around. Snowballing is not impossible, just it becomes more unlikely the least lethal the killer. 
---
&gt;Bamboozle could be considered as a perk that isn‚Äôt meta, but it works well with wraith and the god pallet will be gone in 1 loop unless they take a hit and don‚Äôt drop the pallet.
---
One thing I agree on, Bamboozle is a good Wraith perk. I wouldn't use it on him but it could definitely help Wraith. Great survivors will rarely drop God pallet until the most desperate of situations and its scary looping shack. 
---
&gt;Unless you nurse or spirit, you‚Äôre going to need meta perks like ruin.
---
No argument there. I dare say unless you are Nurse alone you need meta perks.
---
It‚Äôs never happened to me for the full endgame. Only for like an eighth
---
Ghostass*
---
i cant believe exclusives are still a thing in current year. everybody loses with exclusives. the devs get fewer sales, the publisher has to pay extra to the devs to make up for those lost sales, and many potential customers dont get to play the game. like wtf.
---
Imagine not being able to hit skillchecks
---
it's gonna be opinion tbh but I feel spirit doesn't get looped as hard  as billy can be. As a surv iv looped even rank 1 billies for 4+ gens and they were not bad billies just the way loops work. spirit can be looped and outplayed just a lot harder to do so.
---
Edit because im stoopid and thought this was a reply to a discussion on spirit i'm having. the opinion thing still stands  and billy getting looped as well. freddy with snares or pallets gets looped alot less then billy and his teleport gives him almost as much map pressure.
---
Adrenaline is the strongest survivor perk besides for ds so it literally doesn't even matter.
---
I had an idea related to having 2 bodies, being able to switch at will
---
That's one of the reasons I'm reeeeeeaaaaally hoping for a The Thing DLC.
---
Another is for Kurt Russell.
---
I love seeing a survivor brilliantly surviving!!! Well played mate, well played.
---
Now that I think about it, it might only affect survivors. I got a 4K by the endgame, but at least one would‚Äôve left.
---
I like how you guys are getting downvoted. Ruin is a garbage crutch perk. Rank 1 killer here and I never use ruin. Killers here act like it's necessary.
---
I mean, they do need to fix it, but you could literally just leave.
---
Shit, I hope this never happens to me
---
Yep, as a billy main, i can say: only survivors want to kill themselves on this map
---
My thoughts exactly. I dont sweat over kills, i want everyone to have fun. Some people just think they arent winning unless they 4k every game...
---
It is really good on Freddy at least. It might be better than Ruin overall but idk.
---
Let me guess, you think killers are op right?
---
Exactly. üòÇ
---
You dont have to, but dont be surprised when people call you names when you are playing selfishly.
---
Ah, that is for the info. What are some other good perks for spirit?
---
Well youre also one survivor down which is big.
---
Yeah I figured it could be a cool and unique way to have map pressure and paranoia.
---
:(
---
true but they should really just fix the matchmaking system
---
Perks generally help you more than add-ons usually.
---
We finally got to play one
---
K
---
We'll send you a survivor rulebook copy soon
---
Tip: read it as a comic book, you'll laugh your heart out
---
depends how far into the game if say for instance u get obsession 50 second chase at beginning of game and u hook then 3 gens pop. 2 gens are left with 3 people more than likely 2 people are getting out
---
My spirit build is BBQ 3, Surveillance,3, A nurse's calling 2, and 4th is up to u. I usually run make your choice for pressure but have swapped to discordance 1 if i'm feeling cheeky and want to use MDR and PB, otherwise a slowdown perk is good pop goes, dying light, thana, ECT

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/db72xu/how_often_does_this_game_rank_reset/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

You‚Äôll never be Steve if you keep running into your own traps
---
I think it would‚Äôve been better if you got DS yo escape and then hatch
---
&gt;I can‚Äôt reveal you ~~without getting closer~~
---
FTFY
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, Save the Best For Last. I would suggest brutal strength, but since Demo can break pallets quickly with shred I don't see a point in using brutal. For the fourth perk you can bring whatever you want really.
---
Replace thanato with ruin and you have my build
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
Couple percent I believe. It can add up but it would be stronger if the stacks didn't go away when a survivor died
---
How comes we have leatherface and not him
---
95 hours. DBD has quickly broken into my top 20 games playtime wise in under a month. (though I have 15 games with 100+ hours)
---
As a survivor, I have reached rank 12. I have one survivor at level 50, three in the 20s and the rest are all below ten. 
---
I am a rank 16 killer with two killers in the twenties.
---
In the grand scope of maxing out everything (not even to mention prestige) and reaching red ranks, I still have a ton to do.
---
The game will definitely eventually get repetitive, but I feel I will at least hit 300 hours before taking any sort of extended break.
---
I think that game should work like identity V where the objective is insanely fast but the "hook" timer is very short. Identity V is balanced around the killer camping and tunneling and because of that it doesn't feel unfair or "toxic" when you are camped. The survivors win by gen rushing, and the killer wins by punishing altruism.
---
You think escaping with 6k points even on a double BPS event if fun? I play both sides, I dont "whine", I simply understand the struggle of either the killer/surv and I dont sweat just to make sure Im the only one having fun. Its a fucking video game, stop acting like winning by all costs was the only way to go... When 2 people dc'ed in my match and the other survs asked me to farm with them (giving me items, not running away), Im not gonna go full tryhard mode and destroy them. Its not their fault their team is shit, neither its mine. I could kill them, but, unlike you, i want everyone to have fun.
---
Wraith too
---
I mean, running ds is a great way to get better at skillchecks.
---
What was the map?
---
Finally someone who agrees
---
Honestly Baby Steve is like the new Baby Dwight. Steve has become the new Dwight / Ace while Nancy has become the new Nea / Claudette.
---
Well I know what I'm gonna masterbate over tonight
---
Lol how often does ruin stay up for more than 30 seconds? Even so good survivors can still do the gens pretty quick even with ruin.
---
No last year the halloween event was hell. Nobody di gens and everyone just went for the damn flowers
---
Boi im a dwight main and i wouldve blended into the gen with my pizza dwight XD blendettes arent the only stealthy mofos
---
No, I'll tell you what.
---
Don't hook a single survivor, ever after the exit gates are open then I'll leave.
---
Until then I'll help my teammates. Thanks.
---
Unbreakable becomes slightly more useful in red ranks because it is more common for killers to slug in those ranks.
---
that's fair enough
---
yea see edit lol
---
Just imagine shirtless David, Jane, and Dwight actually doing this q
---
Try focusing on just backing while slowly moving the beam up - I find it to be more accurate
---
Yeah I play Billy a lot and can confirm that I have made a comeback at every point in the game because of how easy to it to get a 4k if everyone makes a mistake one after another.
---
Well. It was just an example I am familiar with. ^^
---
Mother-Daughter ring and prayer beads they are add-ons that make it so she moves super fast but no scratch marks and no whoosh noise. they are her strongest add-ons. ruin is a good choice for her 4th perk but once you master her you dont need it anymore.
---
I could but that would make me an asshole for not helping my teammates get out.  
---
Every killer is pushing this agenda that survivors need to open the gates and fuckoff instantly and never help their teammates and it's disgusting.
---
and r/dbdgonegay exists...
---
umm
---
Agreed.
---
I love your answer
---
That moment when he places a trap, and says something like 'this will come in handy later.' *Five minutes later* \*clack\*
---
For real though!! People forget the solo survivor struggles and how rare it is to find a decent team. Plus this event was so mori heavy. I can‚Äôt get mad at survivors coming in strapped and ready
---
Still want my Nazi SS killer
---
fuck it make everyone shirtless who gives a shit everyones tits are out now
---
Usually when I play killer, I try and give each survivor a fair chance. Even, sometimes when I play with toxic people. It takes a lot to piss me off in this game.

If you can mindgame then this map is actually really good for survivors. Killers usually chase me for a long time in that map.
---
I purposely left it in to show how close it was to the beginning of the game (also 1 second of loading screen, 3 seconds of panning... 4 seconds not 20)
---
I‚Äôm not even running great perks, I‚Äôm running surge, bitter murmur, unrelenting, and distressing to maximize the extra bloodpoints. I‚Äôd almost begin to get it if I were running ruin, bbq, nurses calling, or any other meta perk but like I‚Äôm not even good tbh.
---
Maybe you should stop suggesting stupid ideas? Sounds like you don't have any.
---
They didn't want to have to keep coding in different lighting for every new map
---
so u feel it's alright if u lose a perk if someone dcs? what if the same applies to survivor u lose ds if someone dcs?
---
starting with all traps seem's fine, but what about bag add ons and what happens after placement
---
never escaping is a little to much, but lowering the "luck" would be better, not Kobe levels of rng, but less out in 3 tries
---
mori sounds nice
---
lunge stats are all the same IIRC now
---
small game affects hag traps and freddy traps/pallets so having trapper be immune would be bs, slippery meat... who runs it really
---
just make it to where you have to disarm before you sabo and make saboing take a few seconds longer
---
and just make the animation faster for stepping in your trap, if you step in your own trap it means that a survivor got you and dead harded over a trap you placed in a door way, or you forgot where a trap was when you were doing something important (i.e, chasing/hooking)
---
Tenacity, unbreakable, deliverance and pebble
---
because it made the maps real dark and made it hard to see survivors, a blendette with this offering and getting a dark map she might as well been invisible
---
She has some pretty crazy addons that make her feel really strong if you don't know how to play against the mindgames
---
Sigh... I've been getting in a lot of matches like this lately.
---
Alright cool! Thanks for the tips
---
You're welcum.
---
Sooo, 45% of the killers you fear? Even Legion?
---
Damn, your comment is relevant. People think downvote= I don't agree. While I have yet to come across BBQ, I love me my Ruin and respect your love for BBQ.
---
what if only the 1 guy had DS you are out of a perk because someone dcs what if that worked on survivors if someone dcs u lose a random perk ur running
---
I see, and what are some tips about the advantages I have
---
This would make the game even more toxic for everyone involved.
---
because killers were afraid of the dark....joking aside, removing the moon from the game, Entity was Claudette‚Äôs bitch...
---
Moonlight add-ons caused too many issues with the lighting in different maps. They decided to get rid of the offerings instead of fix the issues that they caused.
---
Matchmaking has been broken in a variety of ways since it came out
---
Have you met the dbd community. This system would be abused to hell and back
---
thats a fair response I think ultimatly it will be up to survivors. as you stated billy will punish mistakes harder but if the survivor is very optimal billy will lose 3 gens on that survivor alone if all survivors are that optimal billy in trouble. Freddy has a little bit more control over survs  just because fake pallets can end a chase or snare can force a quick drop or slow vault. but yea billy can for sure snowball better then freddles.
---
Well, for why he's coming... Well, there seems to be a lot of videos about him most likely coming to dead by Daylight, which normally means there's something coming soon. I get the feeling it's gonna be a paragraph as opposed to a full chapter. Pennywise is really the most memorable part of IT, and in terms of locations, apart from the sewers (Which would be a NIGHTMARE), there isn't much to work with. Not to mention the fact that there isn't really a main character in IT. So, yeah. Pennywise, I don't think it's a chapter. Just a fun little paragraph. Also the video that DBD allegedly uploaded to their channel called "The pennywise" which I can't confirm actually happened.
---
Also oh, rip.
---
Try to hit the skillcheck slightly before it reach the white zone, on ps4 there is a little delay when you press the button
---
Yeah I'm trying to figure out ways to balance it out. I am thinking of a system to make sure the claim is true and not be without having to constantly record everything.
---
I play both tyvm. My teammates are not my problem at the end of the game, I already did my part I am not obligated to save them and I don't expect them to save me. In fact, imo, survivors that stay to help that one guy that was hooked after the gates are open are just giving the killer more chances to get hooks just so one survivor doesn't lose out on 5k bp (omg 5k bp! That's like 1/4 of the amount of bloodpoints I get on average in a game! What will I ever do without that 5k bp?!)
---
No prob man Good luck and remember she has a learning curve so give her some time.
---
If you have so many negative comments, maybe you're doing something wrong... I have 3 negativo comments in the whole year, I dont delete any comments.
---
You play with Ps4 Or Pc? Because With Ps4 Try getting Your controller as Close As Possible to your console and try having a smaller screen.
---
(having a smaller screen Reduces Fps Lag)
---
(Controller close to console Reduces the Delay Between Button Press)
---
If used properly I think it could help, but I'm still trying to figure it out. This is a prototype.
---
Well yes but actually no
---
That would be fucking scary
---
MLGA 2.0
---
Well, I don'\[t, but I do get angry getting that G/Damn head trap put on me, and running around the entire map trying to take it off. It ruins the game.
---
if u dont have a moonlight...then there is no lighting assumably....thus no shadows. that makes coding easier....
---
What's that
---
You're getting downvoted for this but it's 100% true. I've only been coming to this sub for like a month or two but I've already seen waaaaay more threads that are ironically making fun of "Nea is a killer" than I've seen actual "Nea is a killer" joke/meme threads.
---
I have never played against a Plague. I'm quite sad about it.
---
&gt;In fact, imo, survivors that stay to help that one guy that was hooked after the gates are open are just giving the killer more chances to get hooks
---
I've had tons of games where we've got out as 4 because of some cool borrowed time last minute saves. Those are often some of the most fun parts of the match.  
---
Regardless literally none of what you said is justification for a bugged end game timer.  
---
Nor is it intended gameplay to just leave instantly - devs made the timer slow down when someone is hooked specifically to encourage that end game altruism.
---
Because it's a glitch
---
Teabag is also a thank you. It's like the many meanings of the word shit.
---
Make Lobbies Great Again. It‚Äôs a mod for PC that allows you to see the pings of everyone in game and block any user who doesn‚Äôt play the way you like / is too good for you etc.
---
&gt;My teammates are not my problem at the end of the game
---
100% killer main talk.
---
Its beacuse the killer left
---
Yeah, now to debate whether to smurf or not
---
Uh.. you okay?
---
Weaponized projectile vomit sounds cool and all till you get downed from a mile away by it
---
Glad you could see the good that might come from this. I just don't know what to do to balance it out right now.
---
This is cute
---
I would be really careful with rumors like that. 
---
Until we have an official statement it's kinda hard to differ between really possible stuff and complete bs. 
---
Personally I still have doubts about Pennywise being released considering that those rumors have been going on since the first chapter of IT.
---
u dont need a feedback for this. u just need to shift tab once u load into the game, check killers profile and check the comments....-rep says a lot....at least those who have their profile open
---
if u ask me...survivor should be also able to see the killers profile before game as well...not his character just name so u know to who u r connected to....
---
Yeah, you have to take everything with a grain of salt. I wanna know if anyone actually got that notification? ü§î
---
And yeah, of course they have! Cause he'd be a really good fit!
---
Make rule set no2 base please.
---
Well maybe but you should nod your head or something else if that‚Äôs what you want to say
---
Tho I don‚Äôt find teabagging that bad personally
---
Survivors using perks is toxic dont you know
---
What are you talking about?  They remember to nerf her in almost every patch.
---
AND THERE'S ME WAITING 40 MINUTES AS KILLER TO FIND A LOBBY. WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS? STOP DC'ING
---
i miss pre silicone lana rhoades
---
How they message u being the killer?
---
Yeah it does as you're claiming that I said that I'm trying to justify it while in reality I'm just saying all survivors need to do to avoid this bug is just leave. It's not like it's hard to tell if the timer feels like it should be shorter than it currently is.
---
This is like... straight out of a movie!!! Why can‚Äôt more plays like these be common in the game!!
---
The different killer abilities and play styles alone can keep you entertained for thousands of hours, easy. Mastered the Clown? Switch to Michael Myers. Or the Demogorgon, etc. They‚Äôre all very unique.
---
And that‚Äôs only half of the game. Survivor takes a whole different skill set. Some are stealthy, rarely getting spotted. Some are cocky, and can loop really well, wasting the killer‚Äôs time.
---
Not to mention the different perk builds add a ton of variation. Although, one thing killers have in common is the need to slow the game down (gen speeds are rough at high ranks). Which is why you see so much of Hex: Ruin. Survivor is more chill, so you can play around with your perks.
---
Bottom line is, until you‚Äôve mastered the different facets of the game, there‚Äôs more to learn. Replayability is one of DBD‚Äôs strong suits, and there‚Äôs constantly more content being added.
---
Well on ps4 profiles are very easy to hide and I don't know what I'm getting into until after the match. I just figured we need something that let's us know how the killer likes to play. Maybe instead of player based feedback, the devs can program in a tracker and let's survivors know how the killer plays. We already have a thing for being close to the hook so maybe they can cook something up.
---
Thank you ^^
---
I would just to start so you can learn and not get dumped on
---
What the actual fuck is your flair
---
It isn‚Äôt at all lol
---
The advantage is that you know where the survivor is and what they are doing while they have no idea where you are nor do they know what you are doing
---
not anymore...
---
That's takes more effort. It's pretty easy to know when it's a thank you or not when you're playing.
---
It changed when they nerfed healing speed in general while also buffing sloppy butcher to make healing even slower
---
I prefer Quinton over Steve lol.
---
Henderson!
---
I can feel that pain too. At least you got SOME time though
---
It pains me to say that the number of traps he can carry plus the actual number of traps on ground in total make this killer a little less powerful, I can only trap 1/3 of the map and if the gens don't spawn close enough I am fucked, but thanks to Otzdarva I can secure 1 or 2k with multiple hooks in an open map
---
Darkest moonlight is still moonlight.  It didn't say removes the moon entirely.
---
No, but it isn't fun to get camped and tunneld every other game. They keep making perks and changing perks to counter camping and tunneling so instead of adding more, they can put a system in that warns the survivors what they are up against. That way they can quit or change their perk builds accordingly.
---
This is an absolutely terrible idea.
---
fps skill checks!!!...once u get down to the timing of ur fps then u will also hit great/hex skill checks....practice
---
They have to fix it. Meanwhile, just leave earlier
---
True, besides not everyone has to be a killer. Rim wasn't a killer originally I'm pretty sure.
---
Who is to the left of Norman Bates?
---
It's happening when you are the last Survivor to die or escape.
---
3.2.0 was meant to come with the dedicated servers, but they were delayed. 
---
What I *think* is happening is this; 
---
With the dedicated servers, every players connection to host server is closed upon the last Survivor escaping or dying, as that is the end of the match. However, because the servers were delayed, the Killer is still acting as the host. So they game is disconnecting all Survivors from the Killer when the last one escapes or dies. This causes the game to bug out a bit; acting as if, from your perspective, the Killer purposely DC'd.
---
It's healthier for the match because the obsession now doesn't get tunneled off hook and mori'd
---
Now it needs some minor adjustments like:
---
-The Obsession Sacrificed/Maybe Mori'd doesn't disable the perk
---
-Slight Number Buff
---
The problem is that often, once you give them a tiny bit of a break, they proceed to finish all gens at lightning speed and escape without you downing a single one of them. The balance of power in matches can swing wildly, giving up what little pressure you have can be very unwise.
---
Then don't cry if you don't have time anymore, simple
---
By this statement you made this post useless for a known issue
---
Do you really believe that is wouldn't be abused?
---
No. I already said in the post I understand that it could be. Still coming up with ways to stop that as I already said in the post.
---
Sweat is typically used to imply the killer was a tryhard. Doesn‚Äôt make much sense in this game since there‚Äôs nothing too ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù you can do
---
Jumpshot
---
Need more of these invader Zim memes
---
I would have personally camped the dude who messaged you!
---
I kind of want to know what happens next... but also I don‚Äôt ü§îüòÇ
---
Here's the patch note. 
---
Removed the possibility for all Moonlight Offerings to spawn in the Bloodweb. The usage of these Offerings could have a lot of impact on the lighting of each map and the developers needed more control over the exact lighting they decide to set in each map in order to ensure a good experience for everyone. The Moonlight Offerings were making this harder to accomplish.
---
This would be sick but would probs take a crazy amount of coding, since I dont think there's nothing in the base code that they could develop from.   
---
Great idea though, hope we get something similar.
---
Fav one by her except the pee part
---
I thought you needed to actually play at the time.
---
Yeah.  I‚Äôm a console player and have 15 on my nurse.  DURING DOUBLE BLOODPOINTS.  I thought I‚Äôd use them and farm. But every killer game I get into (when I eventually get into it). All they want to do is run away from me.  And I ain‚Äôt about to waste all my GG‚Äôs on that.
---
So do you play with a mouse?
---
Damn, poor guy.
---
Literally impossible to get to you
---
And that is occasionally mostly the outcome, I just remind myself it's just a game. I dont understand how some people let this game get the best of them. It's always nice to have other games in rotation to play.
---
i'd love to have the weapon props
---
I‚Äôve played this game ever since it came out on console, so roughly 2 years. Taken the occasional break here and there but I‚Äôve got a ridiculous number of hours on it. Whenever I get bored of it I pick a killer to master, or I hunt for achievements, or I run a meme build. A personal favourite of mine is to run an item hunter build with head on, so I can stockpile good items for when I‚Äôm back to the meta while still having fun. This game has a lot of hours in it as long as you‚Äôre able to deal with frustration and don‚Äôt mind a grind
---
May as well just think of the BPS as a escape cake then.  There‚Äôs no reason NOT to use them right?   Even if it rewards others.  You‚Äôre missing out on rewarding yourself!
---
Calm down yo. Sheesh.
---
I assume the kill was also like that after couple of seconds xD
---
You mean like the constant unnecessary pig nerfs and upcoming nurse nerf? The devs buff and nerf both sides as they see fit, which is sometimes debatable, but to suggest that they are constantly only nerfing one side is ridiculous.
---
Super vague
---
They basically skewed the game in the survivors favour most the time. I have like 10 on my huntress from a while back
---
Perks, all the way. 
---
Iridescent Head 3-Blink Nurse would be a trip, though.
---
So lucky he had no add ons that made boxes harder
---
Wait a second why did you remove your own username?
---
They need to retire all of the luck offerings for survivors. It‚Äôs such a wasted game mechanic. It (rarely) effects item spawns or chances of unhooking yourself and their definitely shouldn‚Äôt be 7 different luck offerings. Let us see more items (or new items!)
---
I do believe u dont get me wrong. I just find hard to believe that their excuse was the lighting coding. if you read carefully the patch note they want ‚Äòto ensure a good experience for everyone‚Äô....it seems the players were urban immersing and the killers were fed up which is understandable
---
I certainly hope we get a proper event. The lack of any real summer event was disappointing to say the least.

I actually like meat plant :3

I don't know about you, but I'd happily trade a perk slot for a Survivor.

You‚Äôre stupid as all hell. I didn‚Äôt say I wasn‚Äôt nice. If I have two dc‚Äôs I‚Äôm not going to be a dick, but I also don‚Äôt care about survivors complaining about tunneling, especially when they‚Äôre loading in with instas and bnps .
---
Borrowed time?
---
Well knowing Ds is a high probability most games the good play would be to slug ma dude, just think of it as a learning experience. Did you get them all in the end?
---
Happened to me yesterday when I was playing ghostface. I will remember you random Meg
---
Man, shame about the dc, I wanted to BATHE in that post game salt.
---
Corrupt intervention is good for that
---
And sometimes players use borrowed time just for securing those additional points... or just unhooking you in front of Killer's terror radius anyway.
---
Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Taking one for the team achievement exists.
---
My name is right there and you can't spell it correctly, nice one monkey
---
No they hadn't just been pulled off the hook.
---
It‚Äôs good but there‚Äôs not a lot of perk synergy happening. Also Nurse‚Äôs Calling is great for Spirit so I‚Äôd get that the next time you see it!
---
Try playing Huntress, survivors vaulting windows is a great opportunity for hatchet throwing.
---
Also, Legion, but that's hard mode right now.
---
I would love to see this from his perspective
---
Is this a cake show-off competition? Cause I know for sure, the host is winning.
---
Camping is toxic because it quite literally prevents the survivor you're camping from playing the game or having any fun. You're doing that knowingly, therefore it's toxic regardless of if it's 'a strategy'. I guess it depends what you view as toxic but as far as I'm concerned anything that you know will stop someone else from having fun but you do it anyway, that's toxic.
---
No survivors = no game just like no killers = no game. This kinda shit energy everyone‚Äôs throwing at each other is why this game isn‚Äôt fun. Fuck this dude lulw
---
Are you sure it was activated
---
She placed down like 3 on both sides of the entranceway to the hook and left. And 40 meters? Damn. Dwight's perk on being able to see survivor's aura goes up to 36 meters. That's pretty OP enough. 
---
And yeah. Nothing is worse than when the heartbeat is gone, you heal your bitch ass up and get jump scared. Then she teleports to you.
---
the hell does that have to do with my comment? The game has issues, are we to ignore and enjoy them when literallt every 3rd game i have to hard quit the game and load back into it because i get loading screen loop? which is reported on the dev forums CONSTANTLY
---
Just had a game where all 4 survivors died at the gate because of that lol sucks cause we where farming and they didn't realise the time was messed up on their side
---
I am a GF main XD
---
I had more, I had 132 when the gruesome gateau event ended
---
Babysitter is garbage
---
This is why I don't trust anyone or coordinate with anyone in the pregame chat. Unless it's me telling them something for their own benefit (like if we're the last two alive and we find the hatch, follow me to it and I'll die so you can escape), I will never talk to them because of crap like this. :/
---
Bring brutal strength + light born on Spirit. She's probably the only Killer that most of the time has a hard time being flashlight-ed at the right spot (into the knees cause she bends) and almost every Survivor I have witnessed still tries to use it on your face.
---
NOED buff looking a tad strong
---
I never understood how camping a survivor was considered toxic. He gives up all gen pressure long enough for the other 3 to do nearly all 5 gens by the time they day. They give up all their own BP and 3 kills just to get one person. If they're dumb enough to do that, let them. It's better than all 3 survivors just tbagging where the killer can see them, giving him absolutely no incentive to leave the hook until the person is dead. I get that being the person on the hook isn't fun, but I get some enjoyment out of watching the killer stand there like an idiot as gens get rushed like crazy.
---
Just my two sense anyway
---
She‚Äôs not so bad once you get a nice Perk Build for her. She‚Äôs definitely a Killer you have to devote quite a bit to her Bloodweb before things start getting interesting. I have an Anti-Pallet Loop build on her that works pretty well. 
---
People underestimate that Blind add-on. If you pair that with Jigsaws Tape and get it on enough people at once, they‚Äôll all just die on the hooks because nobody can see where they are or where the Boxes are. That‚Äôs my favourite build to do.
---
He looks like he has two giant exposed penises
---
A killer's favorite snack, of course!
---
Yeah I could see the speed boost on the right hand side and I'm pretty sure I never heard the survivors break the hex. Unless the speed boost persists for a short while after it breaks.
---
0.1 seconds is barely enough for the human brain to even realize. That‚Äôs quite the minuscule ‚Äònerf‚Äô
---
If I hook a guy with Plague in basement, go upstairs to consume my corruption and notice someone heading towards basement, and I chase them down there and down them, and then the other two survivors funnel in like idiots and I get a quick win, I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs my fault that they were all dumb and got downed in basement. I understand your point about camping but that can go the other way as well because in a situation like that, I get punished because the survivors decided to farm.
---
Weird. I don‚Äôt know why it wouldn‚Äôt work then.
---
I mean we knew that this is the future when they told us that "maps will get more pallets but less save" while reworking badham. Its not cool specially when you have teammates who throw everything down on sight but better get used to it now more like this will probably follow.
---
Congrats!
---
S h I r T l E s S  M y E r S  D a D d Y  T o  C h O k E  M e .
---
My only guess is that it was a bug. Dbd on PS4 is in a terrible state. We have to deal with game breaking bugs almost everyday.
---
2 killers already have this in their base kit.
---
It‚Äôs just buggy in general.
---
Just had that earlier, at least a quarter of the timer left and I‚Äôm on the hook, I get unhooked and my teammate and me immediately die. It just emptied randomly.
---
Good job but good luck in your upcoming matches
---
Super annoying for the killer if you also have balance landing :\^) 2 Infinites if running correctly , yet dumb as fuck if claudette throws everything down on sight.
---
It's quite significant.
---
Because they gained the ability to maintain momentum on top of the 0.1 second buff, that means that they get to *immediately* start moving away from the window.
---
That means that if a survivor does a vault, and the previous patch you would have hit them on the tail end of their vault, you would instead end up missing by 0.4 meters.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm gonna need it. I‚Äôve already seen an increase in difficulty
---
Thanksss!
---
Look another Ochido Karma Bomb keeping him relevant.
---
I run lithe, dance with me and quick and quiet. You vault and run 150% leaving absolutely no marks, making no sound... with lightweight you‚Äôd be near impossible to find if you can break sight.
---
now that's Hot &lt;3
---
Slopper Butcher was changed to include the mangled status effect on patch 2.1.0 which was July 24th, 2018. Before this change the only thing Slopper Butcher did was affect the survivors bleeding frequency
---
Then we disagree. I don't camp, or like being camped.  My first point was that because you don't like something it doesn't make it toxic.  A basement camping leatherface isn't toxic imo. I don't want to be the one he catches and camps, but if that's the way he wants to play, so be it.  I don't want to be pallet stunned and looped as a killer, but it happens, it's not toxic.  It's part of the game, sometimes you win, some times you lose, sometimes you get camped.  As a killer I shouldn't be concerned with your fun level as long as I'm not exploiting or harassing you.  I'm not that killer though. I usually let the last survivor get hatch and I never camp, it's not fun for me. I just don't tell others what they should or shouldn't do to have fun in their game.
---
What I'm I suppose to do when the exit gates are opened ?
---
I see, thank you
---
What an absolute genius post. Just oozing charisma.
---
God dammit.
---
Because you are not the only person who want to play the game as opposed to playing hook simulator over and over again.
---
DS is there to ensure that over-eager killers don't get to ruin other people's game and their future interest in the game.
---
This is what we have been waitin for!
---
-laughs menacingly-
---
How dare you say a sweet transvestite from transexual Transylvania isn't famous enough...
---
Oh that's a very good idea. I'll have to run medkits tho I don't trust other survivors because they keep letting me down
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed this.
---
Do you have older ps4 or a pro? Since I have seen no fps drops with Demogorgon with a pro.
---
Holy shit did you follow me just to downvote everywhere I go and talk shit on my threads
---
This is the kind of toxic that the community could do without
---
Of course he has Adrenaline. Get a good unintentional chainsaw, and get fucked by Adrenaline.
---
I have like the middle of the road on. I got it 2.5 years ago so it is newer but not super new.
---
Really good and fun idea, I would appreciate the hallucinations changed, cause right now they're pretty useless except for locating bad survivors (good survivors trick you using your own illusions).
---
Revenge of the fittest is sweet.
---
It being a Claudette makes it 1,000 times better.
---
Yea but is it a ps4 pro or is it the standard model? Or the slim model? Since pro actually has a significant improvement in some games, dbd for instance.
---
You need to really want to protect the person to gain a protection stack. You need to feeel it, instead of just trying to game the game
---
120,000 BP. Glorious.
---
You can tell it‚Äôs clearly photoshopped because every survivor escaped and the killer isn‚Äôt ranting about stupid survivors
---
And also remove the aura reveal. The aura reveal was made to try to balance old MoM by scaring survivor to not heal and so the killer having more chances to down them again. That didn't work but they kept it even after the huge nerf...
---
possible to have both nowadays
---
Damn this Meme is so relevant to every red rank game ever but SurViVorS AnD tHeIr ToXic CrUtCH PeRks
---
Sucks that you can't do much with malicious category unless survivors essentially LET you interrupt them.
---
You get virtually no credit for smacking a survivor without being in a chase for pursuit.
---
You don't get rewarded for leaving a hook, imo; you are punished for being there, but leaving to go kick gens doesn't help as much as killing all survivors before the last gen pops.
---
Basically, if your other 4 players are potato enough, the odds of depipping are substantially greater than any single person's ability in the game.
---
Also, why do I get punished for a survivor dying on first hook? I should get as much devotion (not necessarily bp) for a one hook kill as I do a two or three hook. It's not like the killer has the option to unhook someone.
---
I definitely disagree with your first two sentences. I feel like "skillful play" is a bit arbitrary, since it depends on so many situations (there is no grandmaster, one-size-fits-all strategy). I mean, you know it when you see it, but there is no way to really reward someone for looping the same jungle gym for a long time or for downing a survivor almost immediately; I wish a killer was rewarded for outmaneuvering a survivor before a chase even starts (jk... Unless??). As for the second sentence, I just have to be pedantic and say rewarding aggressive behavior only works when BOTH swf and killer are aggressive; as stated earlier, the results of a match depend very heavily on the other players.

People sometimes try to crouch past you when you're blind, the correct counter is to use your ears to follow them, but people that haven't learned to do that yet typically just swing to make sure they aren't sneaking past them
---
That or taking a hit for them literally seconds after taking them off the hook and the only ways it works for me. I always run up and take a smack when someone gets picked up
---
Not enough Progress tho.
---
If they showed the ranks to the killer, you‚Äôre always bound to get that person that will keep leaving games if they gets too high of ranks; people would just abuse it to get easier games.
---
Meanwhile Sub 100 Hour Killers still sit in Red Ranks because somebody told them to pick up nurse /spirit crying when they get looped to death on their michi daily because they dont know how to run loops.
---
Well, hit me with a downvote cause I'm getting tired of seeing same joke over and over. Forgive me as I lost the touch of laughing at this one joke.
---
It's not that difficult really, just takes a little practice. Absolutely horrendous when you first start though
---
Good
---
Rather have that then the gen rush we having right now
---
Ps4 pro shouldn‚Äôt be required for this game to run at a solid 60fps, r6siege runs at a solid 60 with no dips at all on the OLD ps4. Poor game optimization.

This test was done on Haddonfield, one of the only two maps with a 100% straight shot right down the middle.
---
Actually succeeding to befriend a Killer?
---
*happy noises*
---
You have time, don't cry for a known issue and be entitled to have an insta fix.
---
Acknowledge that and act accordingly by leaving earlier.
---
I can't make it more clear than this, if you cannot understand, please read it again
---
Then Survivors shouldn't ruin the Killer's experience by doing the gens in such a short amount of time. Oh, but that's totally not their fault that their objective is stupidly easy to do, right?
---
*This is illegal, you know?*
---
Yesterday I got protection points for being in a chase with the killer while someone unhooked across the map. I didn't even get hit.
---
Standard newer model. Idk why this game cant run but r6 siege can run 60 fps at all times with way better graphics. Its inky with him too. What makes him so special compared to someone like spirit or pig who have moving parts too.
---
I miss the old opening cutscene, before it was replaced with the console trailer
---
Yeah, the game keeps putting me against SWF groups consisting of 3 red ranks and one purple who all have DS and Adrenaline. Really messed up.
---
My brain just got damaged looking at this.
---
Yeah facts. I have regular ps4 and play siege. I have never had problems with it and it's a good looking game while this game struggles with nurse and especially demogorgon.
---
Have you gotten every other perk for that Survivor? You'll still have other perks to compete with the chances of it appearing in the Web if you haven't.
---
I think I hit at least 3 million. Maxed demo and bought pig. Almost maxed her too.
---
Edit: forgot Adam got him to 35, put a bunch I to ghost face and meg. I might have gotten more than 3 million.... 
---
... I don't have a life btw.
---
They used to show the ranks and this caused killers to disconnect every single damn time they'd see the ranks of the survivors. They changed it for that reason so it won't help the problem. It'll create more problems.

Yeah I thought about that. I'm still figure stuff out. Just a thought.

*still somehow doesn‚Äôt reveal him*
---
I got reported the other day for using spirit. Apparently  "Spirit is too strong and shouldnt be used until she gets nerfed"
---
I use both. I get chased even if I take the bt hit and they always wait out ds. Or I hit it and they keep chasing me.
---
Yeah true. It's not a nap with a TON of strong loops like say Haddonfield but it has some decent loops and at least a couple that are incredibly strong
---
So, David is the killer now. It's no longer Nea
---
That other comment said quick and quiet, lithe, dance with me. Plus lightweight and I'm pretty sure you will always win chases.
---
*Sad bing bong noises*
---
RIP F13.  There's new competition coming, though.  There's the predator game next year, as well as the resident  evil game.
---
If the game had proper performance optimization there wouldn‚Äôt be a difference in performance between the pro and regular ps4 in FPS.
---
Idk I kind of love it playing survivor. Adds a horror element back into the game for me. Stuck in a confusing claustrophobic tunnel system with a killer.
---
I know everyone doesn‚Äôt feel that way but I think it works really well as opposed to running the same loops over and over 
---
Running in circles for 30 seconds at a time and then moving onto the next one is way less fun than being trapped in a small space where the killer could pop up at any moment
---
It's not done to blind the killer, it's purposely clicking m2 fast to make an annoying sound. Blinding killer to save someone/to buy yourself time at a pallet = not toxic, running after the killer and flashlight clicking = toxic.
---
Yea it's dumb that DS can still punish u without even tunneling I'd say the only thing u can rly do is expected everyone to have DS unless there isn't a obsession.
---
Sometimes it may suck and you may lose map pressure bc of it ofc survivors are going to run unbreakable to counter that so in the end u can't do much
---
Took me like six months to reach rank 1. Good job!
---
All I can think is that Patrick Star pic where the ice cream/donuts are flipped all over him lol
---
Let me introduce to you a tale of happy bing bong noises... A tale of a happy, memey, indious wraith who uses ghost and soot add-ons.
---
(and no you don't camp with it, you jsut use it as a funny mind fuck)
---
Like you even need the damn add-on. I swear something is wrong with revealing him on PS4. I even messaged one I played against and he said ‚Äúyeaaaah it‚Äôs kinda buggy lol‚Äù
---
His mori would be where he pulls his box out after which Thing 1 and Thing 2 drag you into it. All thats left is some purple goo.
---
Feedback system would get abused since ppl already report tunneling, camping, tbaggin, slugging none of these things are bannable plus I've had games where I literally do none of these things yet I get called a camper bc someone is literally looping me around their hooked friend I don't see how it would work
---
Plus killers could abuse this by saying "oh this survivor will always want to get looped and has OoO so play wraith with PWYR boom easy ur faster than anything living like I think the reason we get 0 info besides items is bc of element of surprise like how ppl don't know what killer it is or that maps are random *yes ik offerings are a thing*
---
Agreed. But since the studio isn't actually that big and the game isn't exactly a AAA-game, the less-than-stellar optimization is understandable.
---
Jesus Christ this thread got way bigger than it should have, of course I edited the comment, I just thought blatantly lying about it would be kind of funny, and it was lmao
---
I figured it was an obvious /s but I guess not
---
Anyway, thanks for the laugh
---
How did you all get that scoring? I can do it as killer but not as survivor.
---
Luck definitely needs a revamp
---
I‚Äôve finally found a game which I‚Äôm somewhat decent at. Just need to get good with looping, and I‚Äôll be golden.
---
You mean Thomas Jefferson?
---
Is it a Pro?
---
I‚Äôm the guy, can confirm, it‚Äôs depressing
---
I think its the funnest map in the game. Most survival horrorish feel and I love it. (Only played as survivor so far)
---
Same. Been playing the last few days as a Ghostface named Ghostcake and putting in the 103% BP Offering for people :D I had 44 of them, down to 29 now.
---
You obviously haven't played Identity V.
---
That's true but then you're far away and you leave no scratch marks with lightweight.
---
Lightweight makes scratch marks disappear 3 seconds faster
---
Or my personal favorite:
---
"I don't have to be faster than the killer just faster then this other survivor" BTW I swear if I ever see you in a lobby as a survivor I'm going to be attached to your hip üòÅ
---
I agree survivors are salty as hell. Thinking back I think it should be a dev thing.
---
Yeah and you run 150% for 3 seconds so after you get away your scratch Mark's start to fade.
---
I'm going to be honest I don't think the devs care how ppl play bc in the end most ppl take this game WAAY to seriously even me.
---
It's a nice idea but with this community u can't trust us with anything
---
&gt;How long did it take to get 1 mil?
---
If you play killer with BBQ and a 100% bonus offering (pudding, BPS or gateau) , it takes roughly 10 matches. The real question is, how long does it take to find a match.
---
Cbt*
---
It's all situational ig
---
Give up, apparently.
---
I used my last party streamers tonight on a game where the killer ended up being the sweatiest tryhard legion I've ever encountered.
---
I did not realize it said "lake" at first because I automatically read "lane" by habit.
---
Yes
---
Stop insulting me. You're the one saying you don't play by survivor rules, which basically means you aren't nice, simple as that.
---
I'm not saying killers should just succumb to survivor's made-up rules or forgive them for playing stupidly, I just wish both sides were more understanding. Have fun and let others have fun, you know? 
---
Just because some surv pissed you off with an insta heal last match, doesn't mean you should fuck up someone  else's game too.
---
Try playing survivor for once, maybe.
---
Dad will get the jumper cables out again.
---
Tasty BP
---
Ditto.
---
True
---
All I could hear while watching this, was some good ol benny hill
---
Asymmetrical doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs like DbD. Take battlefield and call of duty for example, they are similar, same teams, genre, objectives, premise, often similar stories, styles, etc.
---
Here, the only similarity is 4v1. It‚Äôs not even horror too (despite being a resident evil game). The person by themself usually doesn‚Äôt even directly interact with the team, only placing traps and stuff remotely. It‚Äôs like 3D tower defense vs 4 people.
---
Lmao I agree. I have been camped and tunneled for the last like 25 games I've played. I've maybe escaped 5 times. I've been tunneled through 5 gens about 10 times and tunneled just as much. It's making me wanna uninstall. I've been playing since console launch.

Face camping is when you stand in very close proximity to a hooked survivor, essentially ‚Äúin their face.‚Äù  People tend to think it‚Äôs personal but in all honesty it‚Äôs a viable tactic in some circumstances.
---
I got my first 4k playing killer. Felt good man.
---
This comment section is even more creepy than Graeme's twitch chat guys calm down
---
At least it still exists unlike my trap that slid into a wall after someone stepped on it. I only had 4 traps to work with then
---
Face camping is literally standing in the survivors face and not moving. It is unfun to play against and just wastes ur time as a killer. The only time it would be acceptable is if the gates are open and u just want that 1 kill.
---
However there is also proxy camping which someone like trapper is kinda forced to do so ya know sometimes u don't have a choice to camp but face camping just no

The fun thing about ghostface is the fun times where you stare at each other and he still doesn‚Äôt get discovered despite you staring at him in the wide open so you just go down
---
That all? I have no clue what the other guy was talking about as I just play this game as a casual for fun and go out of my way to roam the whole map. Thanks for answering though!
---
Also a nemesis skin for him from RE3
---
I‚Äôd kill for this
---
Ill give you a mori. Take it or leave it
---
I'll take it
---
Why ppl call him bubba
---
Definitely ditch self care, it hurts the team overall. It's half speed and even longer with sloppy and thanata. Medkits are much better but also learn looping and don't be afraid to be injured. I dithhed it a long time ago and got much better because of it. Teammates will heal you because at the end of the day it's points and altruism counts a lot towards pipping. Iron will works well with this too. On Kate I run Lithe, Dance with Me, quick and quiet and iron will.
---
Private match?
---
* Screenshots highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
HE'S BACK!
---
When the match starts aim to throw up on any generators you move past, do this throughout the match also. Good way to infect survivors and stop them progressing on gens. Also, when a survivor had the plague they have two states, the first they‚Äôre sick and start coughing and being louder and the second they are broken meaning they‚Äôre down a health state. If another survivor unhooks a broken survivor ( broken due to your vile purge ) then they too will become sick.
---
Assface*
---
This is art.
---
He just wanted the daily
---
Sounds good, doesn‚Äôt work
---
There are perks to deal with camping and tunneling however. Borrowed time is the big one, Breakdown is nice, Kindred, Decisive Strike is another big one
---
There use to be a tunnel-heavy perk for killers, Dying Light but they changed it because they want to steer gameplay away from that.
---
Does farming mean you do unsafe unhooks?  Because I think you lose points for that.
---
Of course - it all always depends on our intentions. I took it for granted that this kind of fl clicking isn't meant to be toxic xD
---
That flashlight aim tho
---
Obviously.  I have never been able to max out my survivor scoring.
---
I‚Äôm not on the offensive, I don‚Äôt need to see other posts, I‚Äôm more than capable of making my own mind up. Maybe we just differ on what we gauge as smooth.
---
God forbid killers to bring a ebony mori to even the odds against a swesty SWF
---
Yea I was
---
Up to this day I still don't understand how that is considered dancing...
---
There's a bug that makes you run at the same speed as killer does. This bug can be triggered if your wiggle  is successful. You start walking/running like you were jumping fps.
---
I don't mind if you're running behind me and clicking flashlight like it's your new favourite toy. You're not doing gens so that's all that matters.
---
I somehow got adept doc feels good man
---
*Currently* she's probably the hardest to spot - she's short with dark skin, dark hair, and dark cosmetics.
---
Note that the problem with being a full Blendette is that, should the killer *actually* catch you, you are unlikely to leave the trial alive.
---
I love peopoe tbagun me when they drop a palet as myers, i keep "looking" at them and they think im mad or something so they keep tbaging, then I break the palet and un the chase... tUrurururururururu.
---
And they dc :p
---
Justified plug pull
---
Why is this getting downvoted? It's no secret that this game is completely unbalanced.
---
I had a game as killer yesterday against a swf group and they all brought flashlights and I'm still not super skilled or anything at rank 16, so I was worried I was going to get bullied hard and have no fun that match. So I come up to them as the are working on a gen and about to start chasing and they all stop, line up, and look at me. I don't swing because I'm curious as to what's about to happen. They all go and drop their flashlights on the ground and line up in front of me for hits single file. After that the game just turned into farming and casual loops which I enjoyed because I got some practice without having to worry about getting to worked up or anything. At the end when all the gens were done I walked over and opened the door for them. 3 of them left and the other started looking for the hatch. I did too. When I found it I just sat there making noise and stuff so he knew where it was. He came over and got hatch. I had never had a game like that before lol.
---
Same, I had one where the bar didn‚Äôt move after like 75% for quite a while and then started moving again. I was waiting on a teammate to leave so I could take the hatch and he finally left last second and I got impales with 50% left on the time. I haven‚Äôt been that jump scared in DBD in a while.
---
He's holding the wrong leg.
---
I didn't say I do dc, but there are very few feelings worse than one of your perks instantly being gone at the start of the game. I say the survivor equivalent is being left on the hook until you reach struggle when no is currently being chased.
---
Gotcha, well go with that next time instead of accusing someone as "lying" and I'm sure you won't come off as.... Well you know. But if anyone else is reading this and is curious, the switch graphics aren't pretty, I'll say that, however at least in handheld mode the game runs very smooth. It actually runs smoother than my PS4 slim in alot of maps ironically. There are some things that are aggravating about the switch version so you know I'm not fanboying here. It resets your rank Everytime you close the game, bubba and Freddy's perks are not currently in the game( they are supposed to be universal but they are not enabled at the moment, I contacted a Dev about and got a response from them and I've already submitted a ticket.) Wait times are better (for me at least) than on other consoles, but sometimes sound will cut out randomly in a match. I've played a good bit and this has only happened twice. So is the port perfect? No. Is it a very good port that has surprised not just me but a bunch of others and runs suprisingly well? Yes.
---
Well yeah, that's not their fault. Blame the devs for that one.
---
It's more fun to rage and troll imo

YOUR FATHER AND YOUR FATHER TONIGHT TONIGHT HAHAHA TOINIGHT TONIGH HAha

Tunneling is just pursuing the goal of the game as killer. Stop complaining about that.
---
Since when is Rocky horror picture show consider "not famous"
---
what are you doing?
---
God I miss Evolve
---
The thing is, if you become good enough at looping, bar Spirit or Nurse, you are guaranteed to get a certain amount of value out of a loop without the killer being able to do anything. Also, Nurse has a very high skill floor; most people just aren't good with her. 
---
You seem to have it backwards. Survivors control the pace of the game; not the killer. Even if someone decides to tunnel you or camp you, there are hard counters to this playstyle like BT or DS, so that even if you do run the killer around well enough and then die, if your teammates are average, the killer will already have lost the game.
---
You can always selfcare yourself 100 times to max out Survival (I actually don't know the exact number. Chose 100 at random)
---
Animation is an animation, it wasn't stopping him from moving in this case.
---
Since Ruin get destroyed so quick,I feel like Thanataphobia was a better perk,with Dying light being reworked it might make into builds.
---
But Thana has really been doing it lately for me (on Legion) more than Ruin.
---
Is it over yet? Can I finally play the game?

one of the funnest custom matches ive had with my friends ever!! the chaos was awesome and I hope that this glitch happens again :3
---
They had to make every map look good on every lighting for every sub-realm
---
When they added Spirit they had to redo it all for her power alone and they were like "fuck it, let's remove it"
---
Now instead of making 15 versions of the same map, they only have to do 3, and they skipped having to remake all the maps additional 4 times
---
What exacly is going on...

Not even the archives can explain this

I was just sharing a clip, I already know it‚Äôs a bug so no need to search for it.
---
Right but Lion was an overpowered operator that took over the meta and fucked up the game, and was nerfed two or three times in quick succession because of it. That's bad design. Mettle of man was an overpowered perk that everyone ran when it was OP, but that was also bad design and it got nerfed. But with the exception of OP perks that get nerfed, the DBD meta doesn't work like that. There is no "must have" perk that defines the game. The closest would be Ruin, which is not OP but just makes up for the fact that this is basically a survivor sided game and gens pop really quick (and I say that as a survivor main).
---
Right now as a survivor you basically have to run an exhaustion perk, but all of them are good except for sprint burst and even that is okay. Then there are a range of other perks you can run that are good, but none of them are compulsory and you'll often have games where you don't use any of them. So that's DS, BT, adrenaline, iron will. You don't have to run any of those, but some combination of them is strong. I'm confident I could get to rank 1 just running dead hard tbh. On the killer side you have to run ruin, but then the best perks really depend on killer and play style. Some perks are great on some killers and useless on others. The closest to the 'meta' on the killer side is enduring / spirit fury which is good but not compulsory.

you leave the nicest bing bong boy alone

This comment right here officer
---
Anyone know what time double bloodpoints ends today?
---
This. It was very true to the source material, right down to Kane Hodder doing motion capture for kill animations (which were based on kills from the movie!), Tom Savini designing a new Jason, a Retro Jason based on his NES game, and bringing back the actor who played Tommy Jarvis.
---
The game was fun too, in that you can fight back against Jason. Sure, a little OP in some ways (baseball bats used to, if not still, always stun on impact), but some people have fought back in the films and those were always entertaining.
---
How is his chase music annoying?
---
I didn't take advantage of 2x bloodpoints &amp; now I'm sad.
---
I think the lore explanation ia that the entity gives strenght to all killers, as the brutal strenght perk reads
---
It's a visual bug m8 :)
---
Saaaaame. Twice in a row, been cucked by the timer üò°
---
this video right here is exactly why i never try to use flashlights. fucking impossible with a joystick.

Dear god

carefully walk back to the chest, put down item, get away, hope for the best.. and nevereverever touch the crouch button xD
---
Because I wanted to share a clip? Why are you so pressed ..... i‚Äôll delete it if it‚Äôs causing you so much harm dude.
---
Nope, clearly it was Scoops Ahoy
---
I laughted so hard
---
Upvote for the adrenaline bitch slap

Oh god, I've got 200 hours and I haven't even gotten rank 10

Insidious
---
1/6 perks so far :), demogoron has basically 3/3 (maths 2/3) perks to be honest
---
What happened to the game?
---
I am at 1600k hours
---
Killer main. The two biggest reasons I play this game are the fact that I can play the monster instead of having to defeat them. And second, I HATE people who rage and start cursing at others over a game, and being able to beat them down with a hammer, having them run in a trap seeing them lose all their hopes and dreams, outplaying them and seeing them Disconnect on the spot is just such justice, sweet justice. I don't play survivor much, but when I do, I don't always care about winning, just want to have fun you know. It's fun to be that 'I'll hold him off. Finish the generator!' guy who sacrifices himself. Or you sacrifice yourself to pop the last gen. Or....sacrificing a team mate for your own benefit :))
---
Also messing around with the different perks is fun
---
 guys, can‚Äôt we just agree Survivor mains AND killer mains can BOTH be terrible?
---
Ahh, you‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt like obsession perks because they are annoying to me so I didn‚Äôt get it.
---
Fuck know I feel bad
---
Haha people expressing that something made them laugh differently than you would is so cringe
---
I feel u
---
Good shit, now the real game starts.
---
It was sarcasm cause he used caps at every word. I wasn't trying to put him down. Sorry
---
That video was basically the sole reason Kim Kardashian was at 1 stage ranked as a top 10 pornstar on pornhub

As a Doctor Main I have to say hehehehe

Lithe
---
Confirmed next survivor with a 10% movement buff..
---
Oh my bad, it‚Äôs okay, I figured you were trying to mock him for using emojis and stuff like a lot of other people on reddit do. Sorry for assuming the worst.
---
Let me tell you how I made them DC, face camping and  bbq and chili
---
This one got me lol
---
Is devour Hope good?
---
I hate Hags and Trappers too. Though I can't complain much, I play Hag more than any other killer.
---
Always happens when in killer , i laughted so hard AHAHAH
---
I don‚Äôt understand why, the killer will also get the benefits of the streamers
---
You could just be bad at doing them. I know I am.
---
I think it's one thing that's nicer to do on controller than K&amp;M.
---
Everyone is as bad as each other the killers are as toxic as survivors. I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs true. THERE IS NO GOOD GUY
---
This has 3.5k
---
No problem :D
---
Are we still talking about the cosmetic or is this some incest shit?
---
Huntress buff
---
O shi

Accurate matchmaking is a myth. Welcome to Dead by Daylight.

Never underestimate salt. It makes people say and do dumb shit.

Im proud

dude IT IS SHAKING! What the hell??
---
it's never not going to be a generator fixing simulator
---
Tunnel them all and make them regret their pitiful existence, just dont do it to nice people, like baby dwight's
---
This guy has an Instagram meme page where he reposts memes off of this sub
---
11 AM ETC.
---
so about 4 and a half hours
---
They mentioned in the patch notes the EGC was bugged, and the timer for Survivors is actually de-synced. So yeah, pretty big bug, but in the meantime, err on the side of caution during the EGC and don't teabag at the exit lol.
---
They just need to make othe r people angry amright?
---
yes, so some People assumed he can shapeshift?
---
I'm sure that usually when when doing this type of dance move, you wouldn't hold the inside leg. Looks odd.
---
cant move with insidious
---
In movie?
---
It doesn‚Äôt always need speed altering events, other times it‚Äôs just screws up more and more as time passes, and can end when it‚Äôs not even half empty
---
&gt;  you haven't exactly given any solid argument 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; "he was in an animation" 
---
Huh?
---
I literally could not get to the last one on time because the pig kept menacing me and just hooked me at the end. Good on them I guess but it sucked for me
---
No just store enthusiasts
---
Ruin get's cleansed way to quickly, I rather use Pop and three other perks. BBQ is part of it most of the time. Idk why people think a perk that's only active for a minute is so helpful, especially with this really bad totem placement in the game. Everyone their own of course but it just doesn't goes into my head why people depend on ruin do much
---
Anything you can do to ruin a single person's fun while not affecting the other three is dickish and thus toxic.
---
I agree 100%. If moris allow you to stop a survivor from moving, while simultaneously still having timers like dying / decisive to count down, Mori spamming with a green Mori is totally valid gameplay.
---
Say a bill who has decisive and unbreakable was just unhooked in the basement you went in and saw him healing in the corner so you downed him. Say you have a green Mori. Bill is going to crawl up to the pallet and have a near guaranteed stun on you if you ever try to grab him. If you Mori him, you can't Mori somebody else. By Mori spamming him in the basement you get to save your Mori, run out his decisive timer, and put him on the hook 60 seconds later. Hell, because hooking  / sacrificing is worth more points than killing somebody, this is even a valid use of moris right now... To waste DS timer and not let the person move. It also even costs you your ability to engage other targets... So it's not even an exploit. 
---
Banning for it would be absolutely retarded, but what you expect from support teams nowadays? They're absolutely trash in almost every case.
---
I like to play TF2 after my homework. The sheer silliness is enough for me to think, ‚ÄúBoy, that was a good day!‚Äù
---
correction: everyone in this community is trash.
---
Honestly just bringing a mori is a very effective tool of psychological warfare.
---
I wonder if he knows this pic is getting around. It would be funny if it was mentioned in his next video.
---
Everything that makes one side playable (Ruin, Dead Hard, could go on) frustrates the fuck out of the other side.
---
To be fair.. you would have died anyway
---
Assass
---
I'm bad but will accidently panic and whip one out occasionally
---
I am the killer main who plays survivor for dailies. I literally call these sessions 'Me vs Dailies.' Last daily, I ended up struggling for 3 hours, almost 4 to complete. Had to survive as a lvl 1 survivor. I ended up killing my whole team to get that daily done. No regrets. 
---
Apart from that, I get anxiety, stressed, nervous, with the survivor skill checks, the terror radius music becoming louder, hanging on the exit lever, looking at suicidal team mates...so stressful
---
As for killer role :) .. heh..hehe..HeheheheheHahahaHAHAAHA. MWUHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!!!! I don't mind the waiting time because I know that the wait is worth it. The chase is all I live for, too bad 90 % of the players, good and 'pro' survivors included, all fall down sooner or later. The rare 10 % have me on my toes all the time, and I love that 10 %, we need more of these REAL pro survivors. I play killer to calm down.
---
BMing. You Tbag? Fine, I'll tunnel you. It's him who'll be calling me out all salty, and I'll be smiling. You click that flashlight constantly wanting me to chase you? You'll die second. And cursing at me, my family, calling me all kinds of bad names, telling me to uninstall and kill myself even in the after game chat?? Well, knowing that I killed such an A-hole makes me feel relieved. In my experience survivors are verbally more agressive than killers, killers would Usually just leave without a word. For some reason toxic survivors need to swear and curse after a lose, or even a win.
---
I used to be a nice killer, you know. Not tunneling, not camping. But I've grown cold towards survivors long ago. If it wasn't for them, I would have still been a nice killer ;) Their repeating toxic behavior in chat turned me into the savage killer I am today and I can't be more grateful, much to their dismay lol
---
Some people are just born as dickheads
---
DBD for u lmao it's a game of extremes
---
More like every survivor with ttv in their name when you hook them
---
This is top quality british humour no swfs here
---
It's even worse as a killer imo, with places like the gen in the portal room, the survivors know you're coming immediately and have tons of time to jump down.
---
That‚Äôs the thing. He had a small terror radius(i think he has M+A but i can‚Äôt remember) and, when he walked away, there was no heartbeat so i went for it. Then, as i was unhooking, he came back, hit the guy literally straight off hook, and then chased and downed me, killing me. I had no clue what to do(playing at somewhat low ranks, only like a 14-13 right now due to time restrictions) so i had no idea how he was gonna play the situation.
---
How so? She was getting out if it didn‚Äôt glitch haha she was one step away and still had a chunk on the timer left
---
It literally says don‚Äôt in the image and you still manage to write doesn‚Äôt in the title.
---
and the ones that use SWF to troll instead of playing properly lol
---
The timer would have been as close to the end even without the glitch. Its just a desync between you and the killer. It doesnt really just jump to the end
---
Bbq?
---
Ahhh I see. At least we wouldn‚Äôt have got excited about her escaping then haha we were gutted when she died
---
Bbq isn't a hex oneüòÇ
---
Got a surv once who ran to the exit and teabagged shortly while not at the border to leave. Shred tought him to not do that. I love Demogordon Ramsey
---
72hrs might not have been the first one but he made it popular and meta
---
Next chapter will not be a licensed killer.
---
It‚Äôs so strange isn‚Äôt it. The only game I can think of where one side can literally kill the other and the only thing the other side can do is run away, and killers are still so desperate to be seen as the victims. I‚Äôm a 50/50 player so I have no horse is this race and I can say the hardcore killer mains of this sub are amongst the most unbearable of any video game community I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
Go into the cosmetics store select a character and if you look at the top corner of the skins page you‚Äôll see a little icon that‚Äôll show you the teachables and then the lorr
---
What?! You never had hex:bbq? You now its fun right?
---
I am very aware, which is why I'm thinking it's a paragraph.
---
Omfg. I am so dumb lol. Thought you really thought bbq is a hexüòÇ
---
I‚Äôve had the same deal. Sit there for 30+ minutes, find a game, get dodged because they decided they don‚Äôt want to flashlight bully the rank 14 wraith, repeat.
---
Same but you are not being camped and everyone is doing gens.
---
In the wise words of Luigi: If it glows, it goes.
---
No problem mate, i would do the same thing
---
"I dont often fall for time wasters, but when I do, I get gen rushed"
---
Last night a whole lot of killers were dc'ing right before the match ended. It was so prevalent I wondered if it was a glitch.
---
Lol, same. I always feel so proud whenever I get a successful dodge, though usually I run into the killer's weapon.
---
Let's just say I am not in the position to buy a mouse easily, then when someone says get your parents too, it's not that either :/
---
The perk you're talking about is a Hex perk, it can be cleansed. The point is to delay the objective, kinda like ruin, but you have to put effort into the delay. Sometimes you may not get to use it at all. 
---
4 pages cleaned removes 4 area The Static could teleport to, I would take that for 20 seconds of having vision reduction and the other effects of the power. Thanks for your feedback though.
---
I did, but lost the plug in thing for laptop, so stuck like this XD
---
There are also perks that are specifically for altruism after the gates are opened
---
Brazil
---
Whether you play fairly or not, someone is gonna claim you did something "wrong" to justify why they lost.
---
I don't think it's fair to call them "buggy", they either flat out don't work or are so poorly designed they trigger from pointless hits: When you sandbag your teammate, and when you take hits while the Killer is carrying someone.   
---
Actual Protection hits, such as bodyblocking the Killer or running from cover to distract for an injured teammate to get away aren't counted, even though these are actually useful. Fix please :(
---
From what i have observed 70 % of european server are russians .
---
60 seconds isn't a long time, if you find somebody who recently got unhooked it is OK to just put them on the ground for a bit.
---
Well this was before most evidence was released...
---
(Also what are you doing here...?)
---
around 10 or 11
---
If you do gens and you get out you deny him points/pip, just like he denied you?
---
AHOY SAILOR
---
Nothing like Behavior fucking over a portion of the market because they can. Then again, customer-focus is not a priority to them. We'd have things like a functioning rank system with actual rank rewards if they did.. since.. you know, we've been asking for that shit since release.
---

He's also sexy as fuck. Me want for Christmas

Then they dont realize that you marked them

It is fixed now
---
I've seen Tru3 use it a lot so yea probably
---
For starters, I always get upset when someone says 
---
&gt;Also, Nurse has a very high skill floor; most people just aren't good with her. 
---
While it is true that nurse has a high skill floor, than doesn't really mean anything. She is hard to start out with because she plays so differently from other killers and almost solely has to rely on her ability, however, she is very easy to learn, you don't need much time on her to dominate any survivor team.
---
&gt;You seem to have it backwards. Survivors control the pace of the game; not the killer. Even if someone decides to tunnel you or camp you, there are hard counters to this playstyle like BT or DS, so that even if you do run the killer around well enough and then die, if your teammates are average, the killer will already have lost the game.
---
Yes, survivors do control the pace of the game, however, we're talking about pips, and survivors have little control over how much pips they get. If you get tunneled all game, you can be a god looper and survive till the end of the match, but you didn't touch any gens, so good luck getting a pip. To pip as a survivor, you need to do gens, get in chases and be altruistic all in the same match, and this just simply isn't always possible. So yes, the survivors are in control of the match, but the killer is in control of the pips
---
The GF that let us farm after an early DC and he hooked us all twice. 
---
I played a Scratched Mirror Myers game and had a lot of fun.
---
How does one oink?
---
Was mentioned in the hotfix that they fixed it and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone posting about it so it‚Äôs probably fixed
---
and now the killer can see your aura !
---
Thrill of the hunt seems like a great one for this build, which I would personally choose too. However I mainly play survivor I do have concerns.
---
You get killers which will have a TOTH along with ruin or something and because most of their build is set up around this - they essentially prioritise guarding totems more than geny's and just hope that the geny progress will be slow enough for it to work.
---
So what I do with my stealth build - usually consisting of at least urban evasion, distortion and spin chill: is just keep the killer busy for long periods of time by messing with them. Touching the totem, skulking off and hiding, rinse repeat. If I find more than one activated totem then I'm laughing. Sneaking back and forth.
---
I mean it usually turns into a fun head to head between the killer and me - as I get all stubborn and am determined to cleanse the totem.
---
It isn't a great strategy for accumulating points - but as long as you have a "competent" team you can waste vast amounts of time without being in a chase.
---
You look at their aura and they are urban evading around the edge of the map.
---
What would the map be?
---
People like you are really weird and cringey. This is weird. If I was that dude I‚Äôd be creeped the fuck out by this post.
---
Copying my comment from another reply just to hear thoughts:

Came looking for this. Mines gone too XB1X. Maybe since last update? Only noticed on the weekend

I‚Äôve heard (source: Dude, trust me) that it can still crash, but very rarely, so it‚Äôs probably safe to run consistently.

That's what I do and it sometimes works. I suck at looping, it's all I got.

run thana and monitor by default on her

He was just Russian gens

that is correct

For future reference I'd suggest using a white font, it's a lot more visible. Good meme though.

Oooooohhh yeahhhhhh

Babusitter+distortion= disappearing after the unhook. Not garbage if you use it right
---
Hex: And I Oop‚Äî
---
I was playing Match against the legion where I looped him for the last 3 or 4 gens, and when the last gen popped I watched a totem become lit and died because the legion really didn't want me getting off of the hook.
---
They already changed last year's offerings so probably something like that, just with generators instead of plants
---
As a red rank killer i get most of the time DC cause i did not want to farm in the Survivor (swf mostly) way. I just want to play normaly, which is the best BP generator.
---
just waiting for like 50% of killer reworks
---
I've had few games where all 5 gens were quickly done with ruin. Most people rather waste 10 minutes searching for ruin, then doing 1 gen each.
---
That's what made old pennywise unsettling, he legit just looked like a pedo in a clown costume. Neither are scary but he's more believable
---
Works just fine.
---
You could play like four matches
---
Lmao, a theiving Steve brought you here?

HUUUHUHHUHHU

AHAAAHAHAHHA

Not a fan of the idea, but I applaud the effort that went into this

It's amazing in the 5% of matches where it doesn't get cleansed before your second token

Her power would be whipping out her dick and shocking people with it. And yes, she does indeed have a dick, it's in the book.

Damn. Will do next time. I just bought the other perk to see what path the entity took.
---
Man I used to love that game.  Me and my friends used to play it constantly.  Was a buggy mess but a very fun party game.  Killers in dbd like to complain about getting bullied but you could literally spend the entire game beating the fucking shit out of Jason and teabag or bust out some ridiculous dance moves on every stun and knockout.  Once you learned the maps and knew how to loop him through the houses and 360 him into easy wrench stuns the game became so unbelievably cheesy.  It got to the point where we got bored even trying to escape.  We would all play to either Kill Jason or beat the shit out of him and attempt to survive the night (last 20 mins) every game.  It was the staleness of the content with the lawsuit effectively ending the game, combined with a terrible and boring perk system and ridiculous amount of bugs and eventual repetitiveness that lead me to DBD.  I never looked back.  This game has so much more depth and replayability.
---
Classic example of the way killers exaggerate.
---
&gt;constant unnecessary pig nerfs
---
They rebuilt her ability slightly for it to work with endgame. Sure this could be seen as a nerf, but it had a reason and no doubt they will be looking to work on this.
---
They fixed a bug that allowed her to be too fast
---
&gt;The devs buff and nerf both sides as they see fit
---
Yep but it is mainly driven by Killer mains complaining. I haven't seen survivor buffs, just perk nerfs and killer buffs - or attempted balancing.
---
It is favoured towards killers. But it makes sense - they need to keep the killer base happy and they are 'on their own' in a game. Survivor perks have to be handled more carefully because they can be applied at x4. You barely see any new survivor perks as good as the 'good established ones' - which makes it frustrating for survivors who want to play in different ways and have more options. Killers perks are usually always useful to hunting and killing in some way.
---
That is fine by me. I just hate to see killer mains constantly complaining here - and acting like survivors complain more...
---
WAH
---
Me too, I was fuming too because the killer was actually cocky...
---
Weak troll 2/10
---
When I play swf, one of my friends is like that too and won't power thru ruin. So what happens is he distracts while the rest of us do gens
---
Isn't wraith's name also Filip?
---
Hitting a survivor while midair should give you crits
---
Director's rapist
---
Intentional and its good
---
Snap out of madness 3 on the edge of his TR, it will stop the bleedout timer.
---
Face camping = Standing still, watching them slowly die on hook.
---
Proxy camping/patrolling = Never leaving heartbeat radius. Not facecamping, but not letting anyone unhook you without dying for it either.
---
Proxy/patrolling still at least allows you to ‚Äòtrade,‚Äô where one person gets hooked in exchange for getting the other one off. Face camping means you‚Äôre not getting off that hook. Period. Your game is over.
---
No you're right, if I saw Pennywise I'd probably just be mildly unsettled by the forehead thing until he actually did something but if I saw a fat dirty balding clown stomping toward me coughing like he'd inhaled all the smoke from a house fire with a keyring full of fingers I would drown in an ocean of my own piss
---
I herd the doctor noises in my head.
---
Healing. Letting the killer hit the gens. Being chased alot. Taking runs unhooking. Not sure if you can max out altruism actually
---
Even better when they say "Oh you didn't kill me enjoy the 2k" like bruh, you were on deathhook and downed, you are dead.
---
Try out Ruin, Haunted Grounds, Huntress Lullaby, and Devour Hope with Mother Daughter Ring and Prayer Beads. Any time you get a notification that theyre on your totem just phase over there like a jet and grab them off the totem. 
---
Monto calls it russian roulette, its quite fun
---
Also try bond. It will let you know where your teamates are so you don't lead the killer to them while in a chase. Also helps with being healed
---
Well ofc its a weak troll its not a troll
---
Most of us know. We're just not going to leave a good killer behind &lt;3
---
Rare are those sights these days
---
I can‚Äòt find more than 3 or 4 gens on this map ever. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
---
What a sec. If tier two lightweight has scratch marks for 1 second. Then lightweight 3 has one second less, which is 0.
---
Oh I get it. You're a Boomer. Gotcha.
---
Twitch chat just got a early Christmas present
---
Good to know it doesn't get better in red ranks. If you're being this much if a bitch (the killers, I mean) why bother playing anyway? A waste of everyone's time.

it‚Äôs cause it just seems so wrong üòÇ
---
Thanks for the in depth tips. Most of that is new to me because I suck with her.
---
The whole DBD community has a severe daddy addiction.
---
Not complainin tho ;)
---
Ooooor killers could switch it up and be different. This is my opinion you don't have to agree with it.
---
Great build. I have a question however, does M&amp;A increase your terror radius more then distressing?
---
I got to give it up for the billy who gave me hatch after he absolutely dominated my team. I was fully expecting bm but he actually let me live. It was such a welcome surprise after all the lameass moris and sweaty killers I encountered this bloodhunt.
---
Shrine
---
Hopefully one day they will get killers like Freddy to speak too like Ash
---
Yeah I always go for the survivor farming their teammates. I don‚Äôt necessarily tunnel them, but I make sure not to go after the survivor who just got farmed.
---
Whenever I pair haunted and ruin, ruin STILL gets broken first 90% of the time. I'm starting to think that there's some closely guarded secret that ruin totems only spawn in certain locations on some maps or something.
---
Should have made üòÇ

I need this dlc

"Please up vote"

No, I don't think I will

because standing in terror of a doctor is really easy? and because thats LITERALLY his power. To cut off survivors options
---
I‚Äôve been playing since launch.  According to Xbox I have 750 hours.
---
I started out as a survivor only main for around a year.  I played it as a stealthy survival game.  My only goal was not to be found and escape.  
---
Year two I started doing killer dailies and playing specific killers when survivor wasn‚Äôt going well.  It was probably a 60/40 survivor/killer split.
---
Now I play mainly (friendly) killer.  I focus on hooking everyone twice and generally let them escape. When I do play survivor I‚Äôm not worried about survival.  I like to go for saves and practice looping.
---
I‚Äôm more concerned about earning BP so I can level the ever increasing roster and P3 my mains.  It‚Äôs pretty difficult to keep up with at this point.
---
I thought this game was hide and seek but it‚Äôs actually freeze tag.
---
Lol when you can't handle an extra blink on nurse so you DC. No wonder why killers DC to make survivors lose pips and items.
---
Otz is the best. Such a sweetheart, even when he‚Äôs murdering.

Couldn't you have just said "yeah this is a known issue, it's been posted before"?

Idk actually, maybe a huge version of the fnaf 3, sister location map, or possibly the junkyard in the books.
---
He doesn't have too much chase potential but he can stall the game very well. He is annoying, but it was like that even before the change. So the doctor can punish survivors from getting greedy and use borrowed time. Also his terror radius should get raised to maximize his effectiveness with the static field, so snapping inside the terror radius could be a good idea. Otherwise you just get down, not only because your teammates did a stupid move but also because you got downed by a doctor. If he was good with mindgames, he deserved the hook.
---
Clown when he cuts a bitch
---
nope
---
I got mori‚Äôd.
---
Ooo I love it! Godamn adorable
---
Dude it‚Äôs not a glitch? Haha I saw this like a hundred times. I definitely thought it was just a bug...
---
I come from the future, and no they aren't. None of Nancy's perks give her boosts for completing generators
---
It all stemmed from the fact that on release of Last Breath chapter the achievement for Adept Nea was bugged, the description said you must "achieve merciless victory" as Nea. And then everyone and their pet pug started calling Nea killer and patting each other's backs.
---
Congrats! I just hit rank 1 on my spirit for the first time ever. She is very strong and very fun.
---
I played against spirit 50 times.
---
Agree to disagree I suppose. Don't really buy the whole "believable" thing, considering IT is a cosmic entity that feeds on fear, I think believable goes right out the window tbh.
---
He did a good elephant impression for wraith
---
You're welcome
---
pretty sure post game chat SCs aren't allowed on the subreddit
---
Hey the demogorgon isn't real either, don't tell anyone.
---
Oh ok I was thinking of a Pig WITHOUT M&amp;A using Whispers. Since tier 2 whispers at 40 will go off before they hear the terror radius, letting her crouch.
---
Good to know that I can use M&amp;A to avoid needing to use level 2, interesting.
---
I think they replaced it with fog.
---
Just know that 100% of the time when the killer camps, if more than 1 person dies that match it was completely the survivors faults.
---
Too many survivors get 4kd by a facecamping leatherface and then blame the leatherface lol he camped to secure 1 kill. You hook dived and GAVE him the other 3.
---
Oh god, the next one is Clown isn't it? I both can't wait for the saga of Dr. Vigo to continue, and am terrified. Hope it will be revealed soon.
---
I always found this pretty dumb. It is like in a car race you do all you can to be at the 2nd place the whole race and try to get first at the end.
---
The goal of the killer is to kill, not to be a gentleman and let the survivors live as long as possible.
---
I have a feeling this post is trying to troll, the fact he's talking about a popular "whiney" topic (Nurse Blinks = OP apparently) and then says to upvote it makes me think he's trying to go "lolololol" or smth dumb like that

thanks, I hate it.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dbb02q/survivors_op_need_nerf/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Im curious but late to the party. What happened?
---
Facecamping is generally accepted to be a killer being physically present at the hook, staring you in the face, for all stages.
---
If Hag dropped some traps and left, it's not really facecamping - it's probably closer to proxy camping, even though it's hard countered by people just crouching through the traps.
---
Had this happen yesterday against a Spirit who didn't get a single down all game, and then got her noed broken by the time the EGC timer started.
---
It's just mainly annoying when survivors teabag after throwing down a pallet.
---
Bonus points if you respected it so they didn't even stun.
---
now thats dbdgonewild material right there
---
Its a pun because Nea ruined it
---
It was a decent game tbh. Only thing I really loved about it was the voice chat but I guess it could've gotten better if they didn't get a lawsuit. I don't think it would've been better than DBD tho
---
Not really my point.

i dont think you know what it means. Back then (we talking around nurse release maybe a bit earlier) every rank 1 survivor spammed 360¬∞s it was literal survivor meta, together with jungle gyms

Any questions Gary ?

She would have to pick up her primary axe and it does instadown but it's massively slow in the air. But since she threw an axe not meant for it you have a small minigame after where you have to try and get the head of the axe back onto the shaft, you can skip this by going to the hardware store from Ghostfaces trailer but then you feel obligated to get Baby Dwight some McDonalds on the way home.
---
And protection hits! Right.

I once played against a Billy who did this all game. It was terrifying.

Yeah 2nd store is Chubby Joes Finger Palace. Great place high quality 4.3 starts on yelp. I had a solid experience there. Then Asda Tesco coop can fuck off, absolute solo queues
---
Looks pretty imbalanced to me. By the time you load into another trial as killer all of those survivors are going to be halfway through a new trial.
---
I hate this generation
---
Are you rank 10-20 by any chance. Because no way this is red rank games, people will thirst the hooks for no and emblem points. Plus BT so it‚Äôs fine.

Which will score if he's just striking everyone while everyone is grouped together and healing

---
The Huntress is voiced by Am√©lie Leguiader.

Meg and Jane do not share a voice actress, but Jane and Laurie do! Her name is Catherine Lecours.
---
Ight I can agree with you on some of these things but you still aren‚Äôt going to change my mind about pop, it has helped me so much, granted you aren‚Äôt going to get a gen far away if someone‚Äôs working on it but if the gen is almost done, taking away that 25% is critical and can even help you win the game if there‚Äôs a three gen strat. It‚Äôs also pretty funny you think I‚Äôm trash even though you‚Äôve never seen me play. Ight then, what do you consider meta perks?
---
‚ÄúSome say they‚Äôve heard rumors about this incident but none of which has been confirmed. Others say this is clearly some incest shit. Until further investigation this case remains unsolved.‚Äù
---
Well it‚Äôs almost end of season reset and you‚Äôre rank 19. There are unlikely gonna be many rank 19 killers out there. So unless you want 2 hour+ queues they put you against a higher rank killer.
---
It's a known issue that's apparently fixed in an upcoming update. The issue is when we'll get the update because Nintendo has slow patch certification.
---
Well if they ever do include emotes in the game, you know twerking will overtake butt dancing at the exit gate

Well it‚Äôs not bad in that it doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs bad because it makes the game for survivors unbearable. I mean getting into a game just to be either camped till death on first hook or tunneled into oblivion is not exactly fun for anyone

I can hear and feel the energy from this picture

Neat! How‚Äôd you find this out?

Hes also huuuge!

I'd be happy if they did something with springtrap/will Afton and left it at that, an of the other characters or themes just couldn't work in dbd.

---
Also since this ended up the last match for me during the event, and the killer asked, and 3 of us made it to chat party with him and Nea didn't... And I actually grinded this entire weekend full of aggressively toxic, chicken shit, rage quitting try-hards (survivors and killers) to make back the million I spent on the Demogorgon and Nancy already... This was just a fun chill way to end the evening and break the monotony. 
---
And we met some cool new people and made new friends.
---
So 1 farming game, and 1 that went this well and was this detailed because Killer wanted to make sure all point scoring events were maxed out for us so it be worth everyone's time is just nice to see.
---
Ugh totally had that feeling before. I just spin in circles and nod my head. It usually works. But remember not to play friendly every game.
---
Lmao bro I bet the pc queues are just as good as switch ones if not better. A survivor queue is often literally 10 seconds on pc, and no more than 30. As for the event (I can only assume you mean the double bloodpoints bloodhunt) it‚Äôs also on pc and in no way makes switch better. All the switch brings to the table is jank controls and an unreliable frame rate.
---
I played Spirit 50 times.

Bruh i was farming with a hag this morning and we all died at 1/3 of the timer, none of us were aware of the bug not even the killer...
---
Yo... üòç
---
Smart, the more new players stay on, the more money the game makes, the longer it sticks around, the more content expansions we get, the more killers you get to play!
---
Really it's the ultimate long con.
---
It's dead by daylight, not ponyville. It's not my job as a killer to make the game "fun" for you, it's my job to beat the ever living shit out of every single one of you in order to prevent you from leaving the trial alive. When 3 gens are done and all 4 of you are alive, I HAVE to tunnel in order to diminish the amount of people alive. Less people alive -&gt; less gen progression -&gt; more chance to succeed.
---
Stop blaming killers for playing efficient, blame yourself for being caught.
---
Hes not bad in *that* way, but objectively speaking he is one of the weakest killers. But tbh hes quite fun, I certainly like playing legion
---
Multi pass!
---
yea I can understand that, I don't play killer but I do see a lot of the killers getting messaged with toxic stuff....
---
its sad really and that's why I don't get angry for losing, I just say gg and wish them good luck in their next games. well anyway I hope that you continue to play because honestly its a fun game.
---
Switched over to Killer from Survivor recently and been playing mostly as Ghostface. I have a lot of fun doing stalkyboi things and chasing survivors. I don't teabag unless survivors decide to be toxic first, and I don't tunnel. If I happen to knock down the person who just got unhooked I leave them alone and let somebody go heal because it fucking sucks spending most of your time accomplishing nothing in a match.
---
People have to remember, this is a game first and foremost. It is meant to be fun for everybody. So people should definitely be putting best foot forward to play it in a way that should make people not want to DC. It's not hard to not be a dick, for both sides.
---
You're not a doctor main if you don't laugh like that IRL if you shock someone.
---
and Billy, of course.
---
Yes I just started to use jeff since no one uses him
---
If you're going to actively try to kill someone on your team that much, after it's been shown I'm willing to smack him back on the hook, I personally don't believe you deserve high points for the bloodhunt, so I'll try my best to minimise them for you :)

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dbbl5g/sensitivity_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Once I was told to get cancer when I "facecamped" as ghost face 
---
I actually was going to a gen, looked behind me and a survivor was coming to help the hooked guy
---
If you do gens that‚Äôs cool I‚Äôm taking about people standing in front of you behind a tree being scared of terror radius even if the killer is in a haze.
---
I think it's mostly about fucking the killer out of their first stack. If they dc early enough then they'll lose significantly less than the 25% they would provide the killer by going on hook. It's a matter of surv BP vs killer BP. It's imbalanced heavily.
---
I'd love Herbert West and Elvira as survivors ngl
---
Great font color choice üëç
---
aj ne seri
---
if it wernt for the jiggly tits kate would be almost nea tier. Have you seen her hair?
---
Except Laurie stabbed Michael with a rack.
---
Depends. Problem is it you make them naturally too powerful then you'll have everyone running the same killer. Whatever buffs they get need to take skill and have a learning curve. That's why you don't see literally everyone playing nurse.
---
It was time for Thomas to leave. He had seen everything.
---
Ranks don‚Äôt matter
---
Dude give them a break. They're used to being tunneled out and camped 90% of games. There's no communication between the two sides during game so there's no way to tell if this one is a decent human or not. In my experience, the answer is not.
---
no
---
How come
---
If it is the sister location map it should be Ennard instead of spingtrap or if it is Springtrap the junkyard from the books
---
&gt;It‚Äôs also pretty funny you think I‚Äôm trash even though you‚Äôve never seen me play.
---
Never called you trash I just don't think you know what you are talking about when you say idiotic things that experienced Green rank killers should know yet alone Red.
---
&gt;Ight I can agree with you on some of these things but you still aren‚Äôt going to change my mind about pop, it has helped me so much, granted you aren‚Äôt going to get a gen far away if someone‚Äôs working on it but if the gen is almost done, taking away that 25% is critical and can even help you win the game if there‚Äôs a three gen strat.
---
Sure, with a specific strat it could be usable. And that strat isn't bad it's just risky but sometimes it's the best option. Sure, immediately making a gen lose progress helps but still there are better perks that don't force to a strat to work and make you go out of your way to do an objective in this case slapping tf out of a gen to work. Four perks that influence the game constantly are significantly better then perks that only can be used under conditions (don't take this out of context). 
---
&gt;Ight then, what do you consider meta perks?
---
Any perk used by the majority of the community, that may or may not be considered playing by the imaginary "How to killer 101" rulebook gaven by survivors and can be used in conjunction with most strategies and perk combos.
---
 A great example is Billy And Barbecue (Barbecue and Chillie), Spirit Furry with Enduring, ect.
---
 Personally for Wraith I would use Spirit Furry + Enduring + Save The Best For Last + Barbecue and Billy. (Insert Any Perk in this last slot for surveillance)
---
Now I'll explain why:
---
-Barbecue And Billy for Extra BP (can't go wrong there) and it allows you to track all survivors. You know if they are close or far and if they are far you know what generators, or how close to totems they are.
---
-Spirit Furry breaks pallets after they are dropped on your head a few times, and as a Wraith im sure you know all to well how pallets counter Wraith and im sure it's the reason why you probably thought NOED was Meta might've knocked a few screws loose.*BING BONG MY OPINION PROBABLY ISN'T WRONG*
---
-Enduring with Spirit Furry is actually toxic because how well it works. Everyone knows how good Enduring is. Do I really need explain it?  For the sake of preservation I still will however.
---
 Enduring allows you to recover very fast from taking a pallet in the head, no matter how many pallets.
---
-Save The Best For Last is my default perk for most killers because how fun it is to see the animation and helpful in multiple situations. Ironically it can help with flashlight saving as you can quickly slug due to the lighting reflexes you have.  For most M1 killers I use this perk as it saves alot of time considering it both ends chases faster and the time for the animation to end.
---
 I also don't normally touch my obsession as they seem to normally be the most toxic survivor anyways and waste to much time in chase or have obsession perks so it has that added benifit of revealing Decisive Strike. I can go on but I'll stop here.
---
Do note I am not taking add-ons into account here I am just looking at Wraith a base stats so you probably could do something really insane considering how most of Wraith's perks stack passive buffs rather then offense.
---
How anti-vaxx mothers see nurses who want to vaccine their child
---
I‚Äôve seen some streamers do that and was wondering if it was worth changing it

And it's why you see everyone playing Spirit, she's  super easy to use compared to how strong she is.
---
i would use rancore as the 4th
---
I can‚Äôt actually remember if Billy makes a noise?
---
Thank you man. But i am playing on pc.
---
The Game as Bubba, ouch, Rip BBQ

Doesnt matter. No point wiggling if you're the last survivor unless you're near hatch or you just want to piss off the killer.
---
YOU GOT THE JOB!
---
he grunts goooodd
---
God isn't that the truth. But tbh when I play her I scare myself more than anything else. I hop out of phase and I'm like OH JESUS A PERSON *desperate flailing*
---
Man I‚Äôd be terrified if I saw that man doing leather faces noises. That‚Äôs super impressive that he did that AND voiced the other ones.

That's like when I'm just walking casually and get a pallet to the face from a mean Claudette I didn't see, I jump everytime.
---
Also if you ever see someone in a corner. Try to
---
Body block them Into it. Easy 1 hit after just spraying them down and they can‚Äôt move. With blood purge. If you know you can hit them do a small charge. Makes your recover faster so you can almost always get a second more long range off before their free sprint burst is even done.
---
Every one of them besides Nurse and Spirit. Every killer should be viable at the highest rank.
---
Thank you :3 i plan to make every killer ^^
---
The Clown, he is a great original character and fun to play, but all he has is chucking slow down bottles.  Maybe molotov cocktails could help him out a bit.  Using his supreme clown althetic abilities, the clown can "hail mary" an explosive bottle across the map at a generator, damaging the generator and injuring/blinding/mangling/exhausting nearby survivors.  Survivors will hear an incoming clown noise, hopefully a clown-horn-honking noise, to warn them of the incoming danger.
---
Ahah exactly xD
---
Bratina!
---
Didn't you hear, they updated the blood webs
---
imo blight is pretty cool and ive been looking forward to it

Well that probably went real well

They genrushed me and trabagged met at the pallets and windows. They knew how to loop so basically i had no chance to get anyone.
---
I sacrificed only my time. All of them were to skilled to catch
---
Lol leave when you can
---
Chillin, killin
---
Idc how it happens I just want Emma Roberts in the game lmao
---
Red Devil would be cool though. Ghostface‚Äôs devil mask with the red tinted robes already made me think of him
---
That happened to me yesterday
---
But i had just rescued a guy from the hook
---
Understandable. It's sad that new players have to endure this.
---
But they all play differently
---
yeah i just got on after season reset and at rank 14 i‚Äôm getting rank 9s and up kinda sus
---
How do i delete someone else's post?
---
Oh
---
well looks like you are playing at the gate with survivors... The Enitiy wouldn't be pleased with that
---
Yeah but when yous tart with only 2 survivors then you start with only 3 gens that youhave to do. If you start with only 3 then you have to do only 4 gens normally.
---
Just hit the stun and leave, act like you‚Äôve done it before. Drop a gg in chat and head to the next game. Amateur hour
---
It happens quite often, really have to learn to shake it off or try playing killer. Playing with friends that are good with flashlights/running the killer can help. 
---
As for perks, borrowed time/decisive strike/adrenaline/exhaustion perk is probably the best setup that helps in an endgame camp/tunnel situation. If you are often left by swf/solos can also try deliverance. Helps to cleanse dulls before last gen to avoid noed. 
---
Especially in higher ranks, killers tend to camp/tunnel because it‚Äôs an easier path for them to win. They still get bp decent regardless so it‚Äôs just something unavoidable unfortunately.
---
I hope we get some masks for survivors
---
They told me it was impossible to hear images. Here's my counter-proof.
---
I feel ya. I try to make the game fun for everyone. I could easily just tunnel the strongest survivor or tbag camp but that's such a douchebag thing to do... I don't want people to quit the game because they think they'll run around for five minutes and have to find a new game.
---
But I also noticed that whenever I'm doing good as survivor (cleanse the totem, loop etc.) I'm getting tunneled or facecamped when I go down.
---

No. We should sacrifice everyone. The entity deserves it at this point.
---
Demogorgon has 1 mediocre perk. Killer perks need to compete with the likes of Hex: Ruin and BBQ, and I really don‚Äôt see me giving up my flex perk slot for Surge over Franklin‚Äôs or STBFL.
---
Nah son, crouch **only.** Only time you can uncrouch is when the game forces you to when hitting a Survivor.
---
Not a fan of NOED, but those are some strong rank 15 words
---
Even better.
---
If they decide to partner with Netflix again The Messengers would be a fun one. One giant chapter which takes up a year giving us 4 killers and 4-7 survivors(since there is 7 messengers).
---
Bbq, surveillance, discordance, ruin with prayer beads and mothers ring.
---
Literally why they do it. If they can fuck you out of more BP by DC'ing than they'd make in that round, then they do so. I am actually in support of this at the moment until they fix survivor BP gains. I won't do it myself usually, but I understand, and consider it a form of strike.
---
I‚Äôve got P1 Ghostface and I‚Äôm halfway to P2. Believe me when I say crouch spamming works. Not in a chase, but when someone‚Äôs starting to spot you from a distance.
---
Oh I believe you, but I can't do that when I'm doing the legendary build that is *Crouch Only Ghostboy.*
---
Yeah, I get that
---
Or, they could fuck you out of your stack and you lose more BP then we'd have gained in that entire match. I get why they are doing it. It's a form of strike. I support it as a form of free speech. I just wish the devs would address the shit survivor BP gains, especially at lower levels where the grind is the point.
---
What a legend
---
What you describe as your experience playing Survivor is why I went to Killer. I'm legitimately not having fun with Survivor most games now. I try to run around and loop and even succeed but then get super hard punished for it by the killer by getting tunneled. I'm even running Dstrike now because I'm so goddamn tired of getting tunneled off hook and punished for playing well. People like to shit on survivors for using "second chance" perks as "crutches" but it's not like the killer didn't hobble me and make the game really hard to even play. I want to run around and have fun doing scavenger hunts for totems and repairing generators and evading killers and feeling an adrenaline rush from it.
---
Nothing kills that faster than a full hard stop to my gameplay experience by getting thrown on a hook and put right back on after someone tries to pull me off.
---
Killer is way more fun.
---
*I‚Äôll take your entire stock*
---
This honest to god left me wheezing
---
Ah, I see. Understandable. Ghostface without crouch = worst killer
---
Which is why I want shirtless Michael. I don't care about the meme. I want daddy to snap my neck and throw me in a ditch.
---
One of the few perks that work really great on him
---
I think Phillip being the killer could be funny too.
---
That looks really cool!
---
This week I got to my lowest survivor rank ever!
---
Reserve face camping for when the survivor is being an unnecessary dick (IE clearly higher ranked but deranked to fuck with you and brought a flashlight to boot). If you face camp, you're very likely to lose the match because the others might do the gens and leave.

---
It‚Äôs cool and all, but it‚Äôs a glass shard for a reason.
---
Should be a knitting needle or untwisted hanger lol
---
No, just the base power, his power interrupt for a brief moment any action of the survivor other than running.
---
That pallet ? Didn't get dropped, you can smack that survivor now.
---
That windows ? Not vaulted either, you can smack him too.
---
That already dropped pallet ? Same.
---
If you time it right, it can help you to end the loop during chases.
---
Sure it take some practice but you can do it, and that doesn't take into account all his very powerful add-ons.

I think we're using the term "voice actor" a little loosely here, folks.

Now all you need is a basement looking room that you can camp

Nope if anyone needs to be in s tier it‚Äôs Jeff
---
I dont exactly remember, he was one of the first killers ive prestiged. I think about a 4-5 days
---
Based off perks?
---
In my opinion, jake should be moved up 2 tiers because Iron Will is a pretty good perk.
---
Thank you very much for the response, I will give those perks and taking more breaks a try!
---
Alright, but what noise does he *normally* make when you hit him with a pallet?

You've just gotta trust me, its about a thousand times better than it was before the change. The issue before was when rank 1-2 expert, paired up with their new rank 20 buddy, and got a rank 18-15ish killer.
---
I think so, his last name points it out. As does mine.
---
Happened to me as well. They were nice enough to let me farm tho.
---
This guy does an amazing Bubba voice
---
Aww thank you q.q :3

I had a Ghostface tell us "I'm not here to give you a fun game" after he camped and tunneled us. I get the mindset of wanting to win, but all you're doing is making the playerbase not want to play with you and you will be dodged.
---
Playing like a dickhead is like pissing in the community water you drink from. Don't be surprised when lobbies get long, you get dodged, and players remember you and return the favor.
---
Its a bug that has been fixed a while ago, i shouldn't have been able to get this offering. I already have Myers and i thought its quite funny to have this offering on a killer ive got P3
---
Dwight being mid tier?
---
*angry dbd community noises*
---
Hol up
---
They fixed the bug months ago but they wont remove the offerings for it. And i hope they'll never, i think its really funny and id like to keep it

I had a game yesterday with 3 bps and I brought a pudding and sadly my game glitched where I couldn‚Äôt move or do anything and had to force close the game and one of the survivors added me and was just like ‚Äú:(‚Äú and I felt so bad.

This sucks because I‚Äôm purple rank but my boyfriend is brown. We kept getting this bug where only I load into lobbies and he stays behind in the group area. Seems like restarting the game might help but not sure.

---
Killer just hobbles around the map pissed off for the rest of the game
---
My reddit username and my steam name are not the same
---
It literally rewards shit killers and please shut the fuck up about rank if it even mattered at this point. Playing solo is horrible and rank reset has no place in this fucking game. I have 1200 hours and last week when I started playing I was matched with players who had like 5-10 hours each. It's just retarded and shouldn't be in DbD. I was yellow rank for the majority of my playtime on survivor because of how awful it is to actually pip and the fact ranking up doesn't even make it any better. I was in the purples before and hit a brick wall since every killer was either a billy or nurse, always running ruin and no one ever got anything done.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with your comments here.
---
Anyone who replies with a "well I'm here to win/you said it's just a game maybe you should lighten up" is just being a cunt. Nobody cares about your fun if you're fucking it up for everyone else.
---
Killers who play like dicks inspire toxicity in others. Anyone can say "well survivors/killers are always toxic anyway" and they would be objectively wrong no matter what defense they offered.
---
People play games for fun. They play DBD for a high adrenaline cat and mouse hide and seek game with a horror themed coat of paint. People don't generally play a game like this to assert some egotistical-masturbation bullshit mentality. That's something a small part of the community has done that's infected a lot of others.
---
Killers who act like shitheads should expect some rough treatment from survivors. And survivors who act like dicks should also expect rough games.
---
To get back to the point, totally agree. And people should really fucking lighten up about the game.
---
BHVR might see a great improvement in the mood of the community if they offered casual, unranked games and competitive ranked games separately. Because right now the pools are mixed and heavily impact all sides in terms of making the game difficult to balance and causing shitstorms between Survs and Killers.
---
Probably not but I hope it will be
---
What happened there? Was it a perk or?
---
Just hope it ain‚Äôt lethal
---
That is fucking rough
---
Why is Nea here?
---
Ah.
---
Definitely weird. I‚Äôm convinced if 2 people bring party streamers your summoning the best non-farming killer available for a game.
---
Im new to the game, what is a gen?
---
A lot of ppl where talking about long queue times and crashes, i had some issues aswell
---
He was in deep wound and didn't mend. He was probably bugged or simply didn't know what to do.
---
Borrowed time causes deep wound for 15 secjdns I think instead of getting downed when getting hit after being unhooked while in the killers terror radius, they didn't mend themselves in time and welp they got downed lmao, I see it as a win
---
you know you want it?
---
I love this
---
I would take lessons on how to squeal like Bubba from him in a heartbeat
---
Give a bonus to stealth plays(like killers doing gen grabs) when one is used and i‚Äôd love them.
---
So if it's based off perks you have dead hard, Iron Will and Head On at second to bottom with Ash and Tapp above them?  
---
How is Jeff second from the top, his perks are mediocre at best.  
---
Meg should be top tier IMO, Quick and Quiet and sprint burst are both fairly good but adrenaline is one of the strongest survivor perks in the game.
---
Stan's perk let's him DC at the start of the game without penalty. He has no other perks.
---
But he was unhooked for like 10 seconds? So if you don‚Äôt mend yourself within 15 seconds, you die?
---
That is indeed correct
---
My guess is Deep Wound activated by Borrowed Time and he/she didn't mend him/herself on time.
---
its a stabby stick now
---
Cause you're a racist? :D Any other lobbies you quit? Black people? Muslims? People with disabilities?
---
I've been playing on EU servers for a couple years and I don't see any difference in behavior between russians and any other nation. Same salt and rage no matter the race. Then again, I'm not watching news and so not getting brainwashed about "bad russians" etc. Maybe you also shouldn't.
---
 I feel like Reanimator would ban a good DLC. Dr. Carl Hill as the killer and Herbert West as Survivor, but I can see a few problems that would come up because of it. Herbert looks a lot like Dwight, What would their Perks be, What would Carl's weapon be, and what would Carl's Power be?
---
*Sad killer noises*
---
Well yes he‚Äôd have to be big and strong to hold me up when he does that
---
White font black border so you can see it over literally everything
---
well personally i think he should come to the game because i think he would have an interesting ability because the clown doesnt really have much to his ability other than slowing survivors down and being a standard m1 killer i think he have more of a game changing ability like spirit or nurse
---
I‚Äôm poor :)
---
i don‚Äôt even know anymore, delete the comment and i‚Äôll follow you
---
Fastening tools don't decrease setting time, it just decreases the chance to escape from a trap and increases the time it takes to struggle, whilst increasing the time it takes to set them up, that's why I put oily coil lower then secondary.
---
is that syringe made for healin or killin
---
Okay totally
---
This is a stereotype of blood hunts. It isn‚Äôt just you.
---
Or you know... he face camped and didn‚Äôt know he was doing it at first.
---
My man has ice cold balls
---
"were tentatively looking at this bug".
---
I don't like that this happens but if you said the same thing about a girl this would be -3 and "yikes"d. 
---
I'd prefer if everyone just called whatever they thought was hot hot and no one got upset.
---
My bad, I thought it decreased the chance to escape, not the time to.
---
Survs are "Allowed" to do what they want, as are killers.
---
Running flashlights or instameds normally gets you facecamped though, I wouldn't class that as being "Respected."
---
Not sure why people are even denying that people will facecamp over flashlight/instamed.
---
Only thing that game did that I liked more is the ability to kill them instantly. There were a lot of kills.
---
Not that it mattered though, since you always got choked out or had your head punched off because someone was a tryhard who wanted to kill everyone as fast as possible and make it not fun.
---
Good times.
---
With monitor and abuse and scratched mirror it is so beautiful lmao. No terror radius..at all..until you can grab. It's so much fun but you do feel kinda dirty sometimes lol. 
---
Or you get Coldwind and it's a challenge but fun nonetheless
---
maybe it goes off of your prior rank?
---
Bubba must've been fun
---
good meme mate
---
If you get facecamped for bringing in an item, that's because the killer is a twat. Not because you brought an item.
---
Thank you :)
---
i want little bongo and legion
---
is this even possible?
---
I never delete...i have no shame.

This is great. Thanks for sharing this.

Thank you so much! These people deserve all the praise in the world and i am so glad they are getting it!

I just want a a miner killer, is that too much to ask?

Remember guys old Meg Thomas was black and the old version of Claudette was white.
---
This is a Survivior tier list and this dude decided to include the Entity as a Survivior. 
---
So yeah I do
---
PWYF?
---
Claudette‚Äôs my nightmare
---
Nah I didn't have it
---
&gt; I find it kinda shitty we have to limit the strategies we use just to get basic respect.
---
This statement goes both ways. I don't even play killer but instameds and using flashlights will get you facecamped and flamed half the time.
---
Not every surv flames you if you camp the hook either.
---
all furries will burn one day. their day of reckoning is nigh.
---
A killers worst nightmare...
---
His bathroom business tool must be flaming rn
---
Myers
---
Silence, humanoid mammal.
---
Love when a killer has to depend on noed, and then it still gets broken quickly
---
Decided to make this after seeing the responses to [my post about Filip Ivanoviƒá and his voice performances.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/db95ik/random_dbd_fact_filip_ivanovi%C4%87/)
---
If any of the voice actors are seeing this, thank you for providing the voices to some of our favorite characters.
---
Idek why Killers do that, as someone who's only played Killer.
---
It's not even an effective way of playing the game: especially not camping, where you're just wasting your time by standing next to a hook instead of stopping gens (unless the gates are already open).  Tunnelling is a little bit different since I find myself inadvertently tunnelling a lot but I don't make a habit of intentionally tunnelling a survivor.
---
Bitch I've never related more to a post In my fucking life.

"Oh I'm just gonna phase this way OH THERE'S A KATE HERE *stupidly 360 misses and just stands there confused as Kate runs*"

---
don't you lump me in with those heretics
---
When Jeff went missing the neighbor who was pet sitting his dog got bored and let the dog become a stray
---
people are still using this dumb excuse to defend the shitty rage mode buff
---
The reason why gens are popping so fast is because you don't have any perks on that slow down the game ie ruin, corrupt intervention, PGTW. You'll probably wanna grab one of you can and having traps on will either get people killed(unlikely) or they'll have to take a while to find the key which will slow them down so yeah that helps, also I think it's called rule book no.2 is a good add on to use for her
---
I mean if people are going to complain about DCs they should really complain about the fact that they ruin the game.
---
Not "Muh double bloodpoint weekend."
---
why does this look super threatening?
---
&gt;Pig‚Äôs RBTs should still activate after the final generator has been completed.
---
They do. You just need to put the traps on their head before the gen pops now.
---
‚ÄúHey are you Filip Ivanoviƒá?‚Äù
---
*throws pallet down*
---
Dang
---
The entity teaches perks to survivors so it counts :)
---
Imagine him in making bubba noises
---
You do not regret showcasing their mating rituals. Why shouldn‚Äôt I?
---
She would have gotten no kills. She only got 1 hit the entire game, after her Noed was broke
---
I can't tell what the second image in "not human, but can work" is
---
If a killer ever facecamps you for any reason that's not endgame, that's not your fault. That's the killer being an asshole. There are strategies that are shitty, and using things the game gave you is not one of them. The only purpose of facecamping is to get back at one player because you don't like how he's playing.
---
Monstrous shrine isn't s tier like i can't believe it
---
[I decided to make a new post showing off the rest of the VAs.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dbcdg2/the_voice_actors_of_dead_by_daylight/)
---
stop it get some help
---
I'm just gonna be the obvious guy. You probably need ruin or some kind of perk to slow the gens down. As you said they're being popped and since pig isn't the most mobile of killers with little map control, you'll need something to help you stall out the game so you can throw down some traps
---
true
---
Only through death can he evolve, as we all did
---
Herbert's Perks would probably be,
---
Re-animator: Instantly heal a survivor one health state when your medkit depletes
---
Look Out (inspired by a scene in the first movie): when a Trap, Totem, or Killer is X meters away, its aura is revealed to you and every survivor within x meters for x seconds
---
Clown perks? No.
---
A Shrine of Secrets archive is on the wiki:
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shrines_of_Secrets_Archive#Past_Shrines_of_Secrets
---
The shrine is random though. Sometimes perks appear again after only a few weeks, others aren't there for months ...
---
Lil prostate check up by the Doctor probably
---
in my experience, the perks you need from the shrine always come out right after you unlock them. example being ds and bbq being in the shrine recently, each coming out right after I leveled up Laurie and leatherface respectively.
---
I'd wait for the reset, if it's not there then buy the clown and level him. I did that last reset because I didn't want to wait a week to see if it'll be there. Or if you bought it now bloodhunt would help you get the teachable quickly.
---
there are all the perks
---
I'm not saying i don't like blight skins. Imo they are the most awesome and loresome skins in the game. I run blight skins on every character who has them
---
I'd say get clown. It's a pretty fun character albeit underwhelming. Bamboozle is also a great perk if you don't have it yet
---
This made me laugh way more than I should've üëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèø
---
That explains why they are all loud
---
he is there and he is in the best Perk
---
Unfortunately even solo sometimes pits you against high rank killers, it's the game tbh, they bring out a new update and it usually brings out a batch of new bugs after patching the last batch.
---
Once upon a time I had two ranks sevens urban evading around the map and a rank 20 Dwight come and save me off the hook, I protect that Dweet with my life for the rest of the game.
---
Clown is like the doctor you need mind games and have to time the bottle throws correctly to use him to his full potential (if you want to unlock him)
---
Or you can just do what im doing and save up to get ruin (I'm too lazy to level up hag)
---
ah ok sorry for the misunderstanding, also how exactly do blight skins work? is it just the default clothes for a character with the entity goo on them or can you put the blight effect on certain clothes? ive never gotten any so im a little confused
---
Total dad . Come through dbd community .
---
Too bad it ends in 6 minutes. Hopefully the next even comes soon!
---
Ruin lmao
---
Good luck lugging all this beef to a hook.
---
If that's what you took from that, fine. I'm out.
---
Sounds like a Croatian name. Is it?
---
now i kinda wanna know who voiced the doctor that made our Jeff happy....asking for a friend :D
---
Why is clown S but not hag lol
---
Oh no.
---
How you voice wraith
---
Got party streamer once in this event killer was huntress with insta down addons lol.
---
The wall had it coming...
---
You got outplayed
---
Probably my uncle... my mom told me he was pretty good with his finger...
---
Overwhelming presence 3
---
Oh most definitely!
---
self-care may be less useful it is still interesting to put it in the best 
---
I preferred not to display all the perks on the presentation image
---
This isn't updated? So they aren't the voice actors of the current ones?
---
This week I learned how to play doctor :D
---
I haven‚Äôt used single bps in this event.
---
Skrrrrrt
---
It does reduce the chance to.
---
Clown's perks are not that good.
---
I just had a game on the swamp as ghost face and was so scared that was me. I use a different headgear though
---
His only bad perk is Coulrophobia.
---
No, Ingrid and Sarah still voice Meg and Claudette.
---
Before DBD released, Meg was black and Claudette was white, instead of the other way around.
---
Wow! I haven't tried it again in awhile so I was wondering. It's just a solo tutorial too, isn't it? You can't do rescues in it.
---
I mean, yeah, people can intuit from merely playing -- but a lot of people aren't focused on that when they start.
---
Ash should be F. Flip-flop is weak even in his situationality and the rest is garbage. My top three most useless survivors are Ace, Ash and Quentin with honourable mentions Kate and Tapp
---
**^(who is joe)**
---
I havnt found single bps playing as killer.
---
Then let them sell on their own store? Surely they could work out something with pop. Or they could put just a few in supply every time they ship.
---
Dat Billy-Bitch is thirsty xD
---
Good luck with that cause it‚Äôs pretty much an one sided fight
---
Funnily enough, if you watch some of the old trailers, a lot of them are actually narrated by Mathieu Cote.
---
This would be cool
---
Thank you. I know it is futile, but I'll feel a little better for having fought it.
---

---
not really cus the presents u get stay lol. itd be more like if u could only enjoy the presents for a weekend and then theyre gone.
---
Yeah so?
---
Steve should have definitly gotten the original voice too. Just him coming into a lobby and saying "ahoy ladies" would have brightened my mood every time
---
That's probably why it looks like a weird amalgamation then
---
*Phasing through a wall* really caught me off guard.
---
In this situation there are 2 kinds of people :
---
"OH, shit, oh shit, oh shit! Ahhhhhh! I'm gonna dieeeee!!!" 
---
And
---
"Man, fuck Noed baby perk for bad killers, this is stupid and I'm going to flame the killer for this."
---
Which one are you?
---
If you fail a skill check the gen explodes and you fucking die
---
Don't worry buddy. Some people with over 2000 hours playtime don't know what gens are
---
Hmm i think mikey and billy ahould go up one. Maybe plague too since hers can be crazy if used right
---
u/vredditshare
---
Harassment
---
4pm is when it ends as it started at 4pm
---
Hoping they do pay him for his voice as well. Y'all saw what happened with claptrap. He's done exceptional work in both his art and voice acting.
---
those are the kind of killers that always complain about gen rush
---
also, i wish i had more randoms like you
---
Besides*
---
Good guess!
---
The game could definitely use a few QoL changes.  
---
Better ranked system for one, current one is pretty.. bad. I'm good enough to play in red ranks, but I don't wanna have to sweat as Nurse/Spirit every game so I stick in high purple.  
---
A lot of perks should just be plain reworked or buffed so the whole game doesn't rely on like the same 5-6 meta perks for both sides.  
---
And several maps could use reworks for better balance and to make them fun on both sides. (Fuck Haddonfield)

Yes but tasks a lot more work if your aren't farming

Right that's the thing everybody is ignoring, that clearing totems is part of the game. If they were permanent perks this would be a whole other discussion.

Unfortunately I didn't pay close attention to the timer movement. I occasionally check how much is left. I'm not saying the timer ended too soon. But there was too much indicator left.

he wanted you bad lmao. sorry to see a tunnel lasting this long. he should know he's wasting time and potential points only chasing you for 5 gens. amazing loops tho, gg.

---
You have to be hooked and unhooked for it to work after healing a complete health state
---
\&gt; How is leaving 3 people to do 2 gens a good strat in your mind. Sure you  might kill that one guy but not before the gens are done if he has some  basic knowledge. 
---
What kind of argument is that? You could say the same about any of the other 3 survivors, so why not stand in the corner after 3 gens are done and go afk? 
---
By taking out a survivor you're slowing the game down, which is your main objective as killer. When 4 survs are alive and you chase one, 3 can do stuff. When 3 are alive and you chase one, only 2 can do stuff. And so on. You get the point. So by taking out survs fast, you increase your chance of winning (I consider winning as "at least 3 survs dead"). What's not to understand about tunneling in this case? When I see two survivors of which one was hooked already, I'm OBVIOUSLY going for the already hooked one.
---
\&gt;  The killer gets the blame because it's a waste of time. They normally  come out with 1 kill. 1 BBQ stack and a depip - What's the point? 
---
How is that a waste of time? Just because I tunnel doesn't mean I only get one kill. I tunnel him down, hook him and continue to look for the other 3.
---
YES, yes
---
You may want to format this because it is currently one GIANT block of text.
---
I bet that exit gate smells like booty and cheese.
---
The thing is, the meter won't always fill up. 
---
It won't activate if the meter isn't filled.
---
This is by far the stupidest hill I've ever seen someone die on. Fighting for this one random, innocuous, and overall meaningless stance won't get you unbanned. And frankly, I think we're all rather fortunate for that.
---
I'd rather play as and against Spirits. Counterable, unlike Nurse. Only exception is Prayer Beads Spirits. Then I don't wanna play against her.
---
let's not forget our beloved Marie Michelle Do (Kate's first voice actress)
---
After you heal you have to be unhooked or unhook yourself. That‚Äôs why the perk works so well with deliverance. Hopes this helped!
---
The only problem is, while a new game mode can attract more players, it will split the player base. The queues are awful right now, if you move, let's say 10%, of the player base to a new mode, both queues would be bad. I don't believe the growth of player base would be big enough to fix this problem.
---
I think they could launch a new mode as an event mode, let's say 1 week or so near the halloween or christmas. Deluxe mode could be available every April's fools date, even replacing the regular mode. As a permanent mode I think new modes would be harmful to the game.
---
btw, they are good ideas and make sense.
---
They probably just have one or two audio files of him grunting that the tune to be different characters
---
Wait wtf notqueen voiced the spirit??
---
I still feel like it's a shame Jim French didn't reprise his role as Bill. He was alive at the time, but he probably was finished with voice acting in general, so I don't blame him.

I have to consider ways in which those two points may or may not still be relevant. You're right, it is only a suggestion, that not only are they not obliged to entertain, but I expect to be shut down outright because it would require a total overhaul of the system - I think. But if someone at either BHVR or Steam at least sees it and responds to it, I guess I've gotten somewhere.
---
'Pure Mindgaming' is entirely dependent on predictions based off of what you're learning about your opponent. Same goes for stealth. You don't have mindgaming, then you don't have a game. You have a walking simulator where you inevitably die.
---
Was my second game with those 3 :D hope they are proud hehe, we had to sacrifice someone else in the end though after 3 successful unhooks :(
---
yep that's exactly what happened in our first game of the evening last night, lets just say the game didn't last a full minute longer xD
---
Yes, that has been pointed out to me by another commenter. I admit that I did not fully understand.
---
I would have given up tbh. that ghostface is crazy to spend that much time on one survivor. gg nice looping.
---
I think ghost face has the stupids
---
After I got destroyed by a counselor working with the Jason, I had had enough :T i guess it can happen in dbd but matches aren't as long to play/setup
---
Thank you for your fully-baked opinion.
---
Refunded 50M BP, I think this thread must have helped, so thanks alot!
---
Not sure whats worse. The fact that you just undressed the killer for 2 minutes straight or that there are 4 gens left. Good loop dude!
---
I would say it is more complex than that, but I have a feeling you don't desire a nuanced conversation.
---
Don't need to. A lot of exit gates are LoS from each other, and there are a ton of killers who have the ability to get around the map fast enough/trap the gates. (Wraith with speed add-ons, Trapper/Hag traps, Demogorgan portals, Freddy Snare).
---
Yep! Glad you got it back. What did you do to make it work?
---
Back before haunted ground and the spirit they used to call it shaman billy but sure.
---
this.  *applauds*
---
That Billy is like: \*I'll fucking do it again, hehe - Goofy\* :P
---
Thanks :)
---
I messaged a mod of the discord with a link to this thread lol
---
:D thanks!
---
&gt; What kind of argument is that? You could say the same about any of the other 3 survivors, so why not stand in the corner after 3 gens are done and go afk?
---
Ye no, you're just going to extremes.
---
By not tunneling one guy you have an injured guy running around looking for heals and the rescuer being chased.
---
1 person on a gen, whos going to get off to heal a team mate, assuming you hook before hes fully healed that's nobody on gens.
---
&gt;When 4 survs are alive and you chase one, 3 can do stuff. When 3 are alive and you chase one, only 2 can do stuff. 
---
It's not about how many can do stuff, it's about the stuff they are doing.
---
&gt;How is that a waste of time? Just because I tunnel doesn't mean I only get one kill. I tunnel him down, hook him and continue to look for the other 3.
---
You don't seem to understand what tunneling is?
---
Tunneling is where you go for the same surv over and over - A long chase is NOT tunneling. Tunneling is when you wait for him to get unhooked (Close to the hook or not) and then immediately run back and start chasing him, ignoring any other survs you may come in contact with on the way.
---
Imagine thinking like this
---
Yeah but they make the game boring .-.
---
Then they DC! It cracks me up every time! If it‚Äôs a bad killer and I‚Äôm with my SWF we always leave one totem and one of us over it waiting for it to start glowing...
---
Hail lord Mathieu
---
You should make a new post vividly explaining what you did with a step by step descriptive list. It might help someone.
---
Please
---
Sounds fun, do it.
---
HA! I hate the spirit she's OP imo but that just makes it great xD
---
This was the worst 2xbp there has ever been, took from 5 to 10 min to get into a game playing solo, if I would go SWF then it was from 10 to 20 min wait time, i did found some good killer and got some good score as well but in general all killer quality that I was put into it was onoy gready mfs no matter if 1 or 2 survs dc they would just be arseholes
---
that's a strong disagree no matter where this list came from but gg wp.
---
She was probably a baby Spirit. Funny bc she was using Anal beads
---
Found the issue but still need the solution.
---
What counts as an offensive action for Play with Your Food? Kicking gens/pallets?
---
Also, let‚Äôs say I hit the obsession she runs off in that burst of speed and I don‚Äôt chase. Do I get the token for the obsession running off post-hit, or does the fact the chase ended with my hit not give me a token?
---
lol when he got that hit a minute and 30 seconds into the chase he was just like "I got her now" *spongebob flash card* two hours later üòÇ
---
You sound like a delightful individual this community needs. Thanks for the contribution.
---
Nice showcase of the differentiation between good and skilled players.
---
Skilled players make nice plays like these, good players are above thinking that you should deal with toxicity by being toxic yourself.
---
when ghostface came out I came back to the game to see how he was played. I thought it would be super scary like a scratched mirror myers on lerys. Nope, just either sat on gens the entire game because the ghostface would be ‚Äúpatroling‚Äù the hook (aka go stealth behind a tree to prevent borrowed time) or I got chased the entire match and then went down to NOED speed boost. Didnt play much at all after that until the next chapter was announced. 
---
Ghostface is one of the cooler killers they released. I really like watching Otz use him effectively by 99ing people, letting them waste time healing and then exposing them and insta downing them. When they make use of that trick he is honestly miles above Myers and a lot scarier to play against.
---
But you know how the playerbase is on console. Immersed claudettes doing nothing, wannabe ‚Äúbully‚Äù groups that get destroyed and rage quit, killers that chase for 4 gens without a single hit and wonder why they need NOED and the .01% that actually plays the game.
---
Please link the video
---
Guess we just gotta take your word for it huh?
---
NOED requires no skill gn
---
He kinda looks like H. Jon Benjamin to me.
---
Perks:
---
A Bloody Accident:
---
If you do an action that would normally change the status icon of the survivor. The change of the status will have a 10/15/20 second delay. Will also work on a gen being finished or a survivor being hooked.
---
(Can be used to make solo survivors confused on their progress)
---
Search And Destroy:
---
While in a chase, if you look at the survivor directly for less than one second you can see the survivor‚Äôs aura for 3/4/5 seconds with a cool down of 30 seconds
---
(Good to know how to out smart the survivor in a loop)
---
S.L.O.W:
---
You gain tokens for hooking each survivor once. Each token gives you 2% faster movement speed outside of a chase. With a max of 2/3/4 tokens.
---
(Helps get around the map faster without making survivors helpless in a chase)
---
First off - try the no stupid questions thread, you‚Äôll get good answers to gameplay questions there. 
---
Myers has a very low terror radius in tiers 1 and 2 (especially when combined with monitor and abuse or the dead rabbit addon) but stalking doesn‚Äôt do anything to affect it.
---
Offensive actions are basically anything that could hurt a Survivor. Basic attacks, using a Chainsaw/Hatchet, etc.
---
You should get a token for the Obsession escaping even after you hit them, but if you had any stacks, you're going to stay at the same amount. Ending a chase by downing the Obsession awards no stacks.
---
That to me is what entirely ruined the game.
---
Once you got caught it was all over and usually it‚Äôs be the same few kills.
---
Instant kills should never be a thing in a game like this, it took ages waiting for a lobby and you could be killed with no real counterplay within 5 minutes then have to wait another 15 to get your XP. Terrible game design and a big reason it‚Äôs playerbase died so fast.
---
Only morons liked the instant kill design choice
---
haha amazing :D
---
Ur just unlucky lol
---
High framerate.
---
I would‚Äôve loved to see him recording bubba
---
Offensive action is a hit. Play with your food always procs at the end of a chase, no matter the reason.
---
I dunno, do you remember Kate's original scream?!
---
That's a lot of grunting
---
Don‚Äôt people need to be 18+ to play this game? If so, wouldn‚Äôt they usually have some form  of income?
---
Pocket knives are pretty good for when jason telekinesis grabs you across 3 tables.
---
Unsupported percentages aside, all your saying is what everyone already knows: Solo Survivor is bs, SWF is the best way to play. Plus, you completely forgot the factor in your scenario that, if you're playing with randos, along with you not knowing where they are most the time to take hits unless you've dedicated a perk slot to it, getting chased the whole game and letting randos do gens isn't viable.
---
Maybe it's time for a general tip for new killers, "You are faster than the survivors, If you follow their steps you will eventually catch up. In this case the killer kept needlessly looping back which reset the chase distance, In the case a pallet is dropped Destroy it Unless you can confirm the down."
---
Probably Monto
---
Take off insidious. 
---
Here‚Äôs why: the husk of the spirit keeps the terror radius. If you lose your terror radius standing still because of insidious, a good survivor will know that your not phase walking. And then the husk will get the terror radius as soon as you start phasing, telling the survivor that you just started phasing
---
Yeah, I'm confused as well.
---
Can't say I do unfortunately (only been playing since February) though I can look it up
---
Entity forbid you speak of the Game Grumps on this subreddit...
---
No I usually get out just fine. I usually see people mindgame the fuck out of themselves and forget how simple this game is. They hurt their own brain.
---
OMFG, I have come to report back and idk why but that is hilarious
---
Which things? I mean I personally think Ash is too high but other than that I agree
---
how dare those mean survivors have the *audacity* to bring a *flashlight* into the game. Better put your big boy pants on and spite them with Franklins.
---
The killer victim mentality in this sub is unbearable.
---
That sounds promising, do you know if the devs have said anything on this issue?
---
i haven't seen anything this painful to watch
---
I learned this strategy after getting DS‚Äôd four times in a game when the SWF were unhooking each other super aggressively
---
To clarify, is this a tier list based on all 3 perks overall?
---
I think the first one should have a shorter cool down, 60 mins is just a bit too long. Also, I think it should read this:
---
Every time someone fails a skill check your auras are shown to each other for 2/3/4 seconds, if you fail a skill check your auras is shown to the killer for 3/2/1 seconds
---
No, it's ranked on how good their perks are overall since Survivors are all the same mechanically. There's not another viable way to rank them buddy.
---
She even makes that roar sharks make before they attack, would be super accurate.
---
What???
---
Sweet okay. And yeah, I was looking st he ‚Äúattack and let them run off‚Äù as either an opening move to get the first token, or force the obsession to go heal while maintaining the same number of stacks. 
---
Although PWYF doesn‚Äôt count geabs (or tombstone use) as offensive moves, so I wonder what other loopholes exist. Like SbfL doesn‚Äôt lose a stack if you use a power on the obsession (at least, it doesn‚Äôt for demo).
---
although i think his power could potencially be too complicated
---
Yeah. It's moreso a meta list than adept list.
---
I wanna hear filip‚Äôs unedited voiceover for trapper. It‚Äôs my life goal to hear the source of the raspy sounding tiger.

are we still in 2018?

The most valid comment on this entire thread
---
It‚Äôs kinda a last resort but it will work 99% of the time.  Just takes time and effort to reformat and reinstall.

No you don't want to know

Oh share the names, red rank killer and I‚Äôd be happy to share any vengeance for you.

Were they the least bit remorseful in post game chat?

I fully expect it to come sooner or later. Same with the cosmetic that‚Äôs on his Babysitter perk.

this is god tier.
---
Gz on the depip, you should've tried being better at survivor PepeLaugh
---
Healthy, hooked, injured, or dying - so long as they're in the trial, they'll activate Whispers.
---
NOED requires a killer to play with 3 perks all game.
---
She stabbed him with a sewing needle and a wire hanger.
---
I have it in Minecraft
---
Why is it a glass shard?
---
The Demogorgan sounds actually came straight from Netflix according to the devs. They gave them all of the SFX from the show that they needed.
---
Lord forbid that the same killer that was a complete dick ever play survivor as a solo queue and someone recognize them. 
---
I used to run into this one dude in particular all the time and he would just face camp you every single match and stay cloaked so borrowed would never activate. Dude decided to play survivor one day and ended up being our random in a 3 man swf. That dude was so fucked. Bond and empathy on just for the fuck boy. Oh you needed that pallet? Poof gone. Oh you need that window vault? Blocked. Oh the killer finally got you, lemme take you off the very second they put you on that hook and take their hands off you. 
---
If you're an assbag of a killer to the same people all the time then don't ever play survivor. You'll never leave the match with more than 1500 points because fuck you that's why.
---
I don‚Äôt know if we got any info about one in the first place. I‚Äôll check other places to see if I can dig anything up.
---
To be fair, I think some people (Me included) use the word 'OP' very loosely. Lower tier killers definitely need buffs (Please God give Bubba some buffs that man is suffering-). Nurse is 'OP' but she requires time and skill, same with Billy and Huntress. (Huntress also requiring a good map.)
---
I would argue Spirit is the only 'OP' killer right now, but that's because she promotes a very low risk, high reward gamestyle with little to no skill required. If you have a good grasp on how to play an M1 killer, understand her power, and own a headset, congrats! You're probably going to dominate your games as Spirit unless their running Iron Will.
---
But that's still not a knife.

I just acquired my own ps4 (been playing dbd on my housemates ps4) if I move my account over to the new ps4 will I lose all my progress/player level etc?

---
Plague‚Äôs Green vomit and a survivor walking into a bear trap should not remove tokens either. The Vomit Comet Plague Build is hilarious if you get it going.
---
That's happens to be but with Ds and getting tunneled
---
Yeah I tried to do it as like, recommended survivors. It's not totally meta since it isn't single perks, but not quite adept either.
---
I‚Äôm kinda surprised by huntress cause of Huntress Lullaby but also Territorial is god tier on Demogorgan but ifk.
---
Yeah true
---
It makes me sad as I typically love facing Spirits except Prayer Beads ones. I've looped and been chased by several Spirits. I have strong Intuition and I typically run Spine Chill so I can locate her position in Phase Walk at certain parts of a loop to drop a pallet on her in Phase Walk.
---
I can tell which add-ons she is using typically and I just know how fast and where she is at often. I've gotten like 4 Spirits to give up chase with me after they realized I wasn't going to vault/run into her husk and the fact that I dropped pallets consecutively on them inside Phase Walk. 
---
Sadly, a lot of games survivors just panic against her, run in straight lines, give her free hits and downs and they think she's the most uncounterable thing in the game and DC. Besides her Prayer Beads add-on, I think she's fine untouched.
---
eww, jesus christ
---
go on
---
Bond works unconditionally.  When after care came out I thought I had finally gotten a replacement for my favorite tried and true teamwork perk, but it's inconsistent.  It relies on both you not getting down nor the people who's auras you can see.  i'd rather have a shorter aura reading range that works all the time no matter what has happened in the game.
---
Distortion does work on more than just bbq but you really shouldn't be getting healed or god forbid self caring within the killer's terror radius anyway .
---
Mentioning how useless sabotage is doesn't make breakdown any more appealing man, nor does saying there are worse perks out there.
---
Roger, at least we can agree on ace
---
I believe that's a good thing though. Now survs know the exact amount of time they have and can do whatever they want for the whole collapse duration. 
---
Yes, saving your teammate is great, but knowing the exact time remaining makes it not a big of a deal, it's just a regular unhook except the killer is probably camping (and of course he's camping, there's really nothing the killer can do at this point, if you hook someone at the endgame you can be 100% sure the whole team is crawling around trying to make a save, and rightfully so, they have more than enough time and they know it). 
---
Now if the survs would have no idea how much time is left they wouldn't be so cocky and would think twice if it's worth it to risk it all or it's better to escape. 
---
Survs would feel actual pressure and the killer would feel less incentive to camp till the very end and just have a kill he deserves. 
---
So overall I think it would make killer gameplay a little less frustrating and survs gameplay a little more scary, it's a win-win situation for everybody! 
---
The other great thing is the exit gate bms would just stop existing because nobody would feel safe to wait at the exit for the killer to come to click-click and teabag him until the last 5 seconds. 
---
The only thing endgame collapse is good right now is preventing taking the game hostage, other than that it's pretty useless.
---
P.S. Imagine a new perk that would make endgame collapse shorter without the survs knowing it! That would be really fun and scary too.
---
No
---
Yeah Beast of Prey is a meme and territorial is only good on killers who are good with basement builds. Huntress Lullaby is ok but isn't that great of a hex. It would be better if it weren't a hex.
---
My favorite is when I get a killer like that as a survivor in one of my killer lobbies. "Buckle up, phucko" is all I think as the match starts. This community is just small enough to where you eventually start encountering the same players, so yeah, don't be a dickbag magoo.

On Xbox, can confirm only seen 2 Demagorgon since week 1 launch
---
They are special cosmetics that have a blight theme, some are just base skins but corrupted by the blight and some look totally different
---
People get so complacent which is why I like the concept. That little speed boost wrecks people's loops and they are surprised when they are downed. And there is an easy counter-play to them. Depending on the killer/location I sometimes skip easy totems if I plan to go by them at end game. Destroyed several NOEDs this way, can help balance the risk of the NOED be in that one super hidden spot.
---
It's not my ping, i get good ping on most of my games and this has still happened to me in every single game of survivor I play, not exaggerating when I say that.
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
your need to delete you're account buddy.... mr. big brain grammar guy
---
Ended up swapping out make your choice for the one that has a totem when all gens r done and makes everyone exposed
---
ah damn that sucks, i want to put blight on my cutsom nea skin
---
Does this game have bot matches? I'm thinking on buying it.
---
Fair. I feel like it would be better as a Devour Hope activation(unhooks instead of hooks) but not a hex.
---
I don‚Äôt wanna be too relent on totems incase they all get cleaned
---
This tier list is awlful lol self care and bamboozle are both top tier while whispers is just average
---
Aftercare only shuts off when you get hooked. Their aura has unlimited range, unlimited duration and only shuts off when they go in lockers. And you can get the auras back, the perk is reusable. Best way I can put it is that it's like the old Empathy but better.
---
Distortion, again, can be used to prevent a bad situation and it can be especially cheeky if you just tap heal and then just run because of the missing scratch marks, you can slip away as if you were never there.
---
I've seen some decent use of Breakdown lately (great on Hawkins), though I wish it also applied to hooks where you removed someone. Like the 2-way street effect of Aftercare.
---
Guess I'm lucky. I always say in chat when I'm bringing them, never had anyone say they were and not bring any. Yet.
---
This tier list clearly doesn't account for who is grooviest.
---
Ooo I like that perk idea. Like for every action of something in the game you gain 1 token and for every token it shortens the end game collapse by x seconds/%. I would definitely run a perk like that. With Blood Warden and NOED it would be a deadly combo
---
Story of my life.
---
oh ok and thank you for telling me about that thread i‚Äôll use that for now on, i‚Äôll delete my comment now as i doubt anyone wants that there , thanks again
---
Very disagree, I love it.
---
Chinese/Korean players are way worse. I dodge a lobby whenever I see these squares of a missing letter.
---
That's a feature not a bug
---
Good survivors dont open the exit gate until needed.  You just 99 them.  Hook save, then open, etc.  Change the timer however you want, doesnt change anything
---
OI JOSUKE
---
I also hate chainsaws. One hit downs are shit, but I don't really mind them if they come from Myers.
---
Second wind is pretty bad imo, too many stipulations for it to activate. Hope isn‚Äôt that bad either.
---
Well, the community manager who is adamant that this can't be discussed banned me from the DbD forums and Steam community, as was expected. I don't know if Steam will respond to me again, we'll see. I have only contacted DbD support once, and of course will do so again. We'll see how long before I finally get shut down completely. I'll probably have to take this to small claims when the time opens up.
---
Right?!?!?! I don't think I've ever seen a killer disappear from the meta the way Demogorgon has.
---
That wasn't really a difficult guess. You might want to see someone about this. You definitely need help.
---
When will we get Mathieu Cote voicing one of the survivors/killers? I‚Äôm looking forward to it if it will ever happen.
---
I bring small game personally all the time cause it  basically guarantees I max out boldness, then prove thyself to max out objective, then we‚Äôre gonna live forever to help me focus on altruism! Max bloodpoints baby! Lol
---
Ahhh shit. I thought I would get another night in. Forgot it would end at reset and not midnight
---
No, but you can play in a private match. I'd pick it up anyway it's fantastic fun despite all the complaining here. You on PC?
---
Instead of paying for voice actors, the sound designer of DBD decided to record the sounds the programers team makes when they add a new killer
---
I have a PC and a PS4. Any major differences on playerbase or recommended platform? It seems fun, but I really wanted to learn the basics before entering a real match.
---
You see the irony? You feeling victimized because I use up that sweet perk slot to logically counter a strategy. It has nothing to do with spite. That is like me telling survivors to put their "big boy" pants on and not bring flashlights. You sound like the victim because there are people out there who aren't spineless when they see flashlights.
---
idk man this list, I just can‚Äôt agree with it at all
---
Oh this is you! I love your vids by the way, especially in your explanation of the add-on percentages!
---
I kinda hate it but it's accurate
---
Where‚Äôs my Wraith and Legion pops! I crave them...
---
I just never play with Aces. No matter what rank or cosmetics

He just had to come upstairs
---
I think this was just a "I hate spirit" rant disguised as something more interesting...As for the Demogorgon, I've faced quite a few this weekend, must be your luck. Although it's very common for newly released killers to drop off the map after a few days. Just wish that was the case for legion mains.

I want this and the bat backpack, damn it!

In game tickets never get addressed, literally ever. You have to create an in game ticket for a record and then contact DbD through their website.
---
Probably the angle I took the pic, it was meant to be intimidating yet somehow small at the same time :D
---
Hopefully they add it for Halloween
---
Old empathy wasn't exactly a "meta" perk either man and I still think distortion is bad, despite that neat example you provided.
---
Jeff has some alright perks, but none of them are worth a slot when there are so many better options.  He especially does not deserve to be in the second to top tier.
---
I just imagined him practicing his Leatherface screech at home.
---
Billy and LF have counter play, Spirit has little to none.
---
While the things I said in chat were abusive, do you really think this is? Does wanting to enforce rules means I need help? Although I now admit I did misunderstand the functionality of the game, so I am having to rethink or abandon at least part of my argument - the strongest part in fact, which is a little upsetting.

Then why read it

Xbox matches were insanely bad over the event. Every killer was incredibly sweaty and I played against 5 Myers with tombstone and infinite tier 3. Likely save those four a regular game because you don‚Äôt nearly as much BP when you‚Äôre not hooking anyone. 
---
I‚Äôm so glad the event is over now. Maybe we can get some regular games as survivor now.
---
honestly a better change would be to make it so gates lose progress over time so they can't just 99% a gate instantly and stay in the match for like another 3+ minutes and then run back to open it in half a second
---
If I'm killer and I see them I've got 70 green moris, 68 ebonis and near 100 of the yellows at the ready on just 1 of my killers. I generally go for the green with insidious and face camp them the same way they do to everyone else. Less than 900 point match for them. Fuckem.

Not a bad idea but I think my ticket was a freak accident and was mishandled twice by the support team, first they thought it was for mobile and then that it was fraudulent.

I mean yea, name one event that has been good for survivors. There has never been an event for survivors that hasn't been ruined by the killer community or the game itself being broken. Most of the time being a combo of those 2
---
It‚Äôs all account based iirc. But if you switch olatforms like from PS4 to PC or Xbox then you would tho.
---
Only reason I play anymore is to get fat fucking BP. 
---
First down means usually means shit points for that match specially against a sweaty killer whos #1 priority is getting a kill before 4 gens pop. 
---
Easier to DC and find better games.
---
Wow, so you say surviving against spirit isn't about skill but about just perks? And at the same time you say the counter play is them mindgaming themselves? There are two sides to a mindgame which you obviously realize. You are just bad at it and because of that find them not fun. You know what though? The game is all about mindgaming and more killers should have mindgame potential like spirit does. Just get better at it, you know how you could? Just play more killer games and you'll learn how to mindgame killers and especially spirits.
---
Sweet we are half way there
---
Shattered Bloodline would be waaaaaaay cooler if Rin became the survivor and her father became the killer lol 
---
(in my opinion)
---
Love the fanart btw &lt;3 Keep it up!
---
I used Za Hando to erase the space between tier 3 Myers and you. Ain‚Äôt that crazy?!
---
The long loops are strong. Just use those instead.
---
the rank difference isn‚Äôt even that bad, ya take the ranks way to serious on this video game which isn‚Äôt that hard.
---
Doing gens you?
---
It certainly could be. This is the trouble with bringing new things into the game though I guess. IMO Freddy's is currently too complicated - but this is just what happens when the fringe of pro players control the balance direction.
---
Not gonna lie literally just that 1 line in the lobby would have done it for me lol.
---
You should try reading other comments in a thread before posting one of your own. Namely the top comment (and its replies) in this thread.  
---
Basically, yes way.
---
More like 15 seconds.
---
Even crazier for not BREAKING THE FUCKING PALLET! Lol
---
Spine Chill is better since it lacks a cooldown, and tells you if the Killer is actually looking in your direction. Premonition just tells you the general direction the Killer is in, and not if they're looking/moving towards you.

Local babysitter uses her mighty rack to fend off masked killer.
---
This one was a blast to work on - definitely the most complicated and time consuming of them so far.

**Next up**: I actually have some pretty solid ideas for The Pig, so maybe her
---
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
To answer some common questions:
---
&gt; "Are you / when are you going to do X killer?"
---
Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including Demogorgan and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen.
---
&gt; "Are you going to do the survivors?"
---
No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight). And no technology exists capable of making colors bright enough to accurately depict like 98% of Min's outfits. 
---
&gt; "Can I use this design for a tattoo?"
---
My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.
---
&gt; What equipment/apps do you use?
---
Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved. 
---
&gt; What else do you work on?
---
Quite a bit - I'm also working on hashing out a [Fallout series](https://i.imgur.com/OjxZuoT.jpg) similar to this one, working on two seperate sets of tarot cards (one based on my [own designs](https://i.imgur.com/kwbBgl2.jpg) and one based on [hiphop / rap artists](https://i.imgur.com/Fky8eva.jpg)), regularly doing pieces based on Ari Aster's films [Hereditary](https://i.imgur.com/bm1gcmO.jpg) and [Midsommar](https://i.imgur.com/Vf5PIhP.jpg), and I'm also a [nightscape photographer](https://www.instagram.com/davecarender/)... so I stay busy. 
---
More of my work can be found on my IG at: [@gopencyprep](https://www.instagram.com/gopencyprep/) give it a follow - especially if you like horror stuff, inktober is coming up.
---
Hard disagree, Whispers is above average and Bamboozle is only useful if you‚Äôre bad at killer and can‚Äôt mind game
---
Your friend is correct. If you are prepared to buy DLC David is the best survivor to start with. Dead Hard is top tier and We're Gonna Live Forever will let you gain more bloodpoints to level up quicker. No Mither can be left in the bin. If you want to use one of the first 4 survivors I'd recommend meg for Adrenaline, Quick &amp; Quiet and Sprint Burst (although any other exhaustion perk is better than sprint burst). Jake for Iron Will is also quite good.
---
Doesn't work with Deliverance. Broken goes away but no heal
---
Spine Chill &gt; Premonition
---
No cool-down and speeds up actions. The 6% bonus has saved me at least once while opening an exit gate.
---
TBH its not that bad, 2k on red ranks using 2 toolboxes one with BNP and a key, while also using level 1 perks and no addons. Oh and on a shit ass map
---
Just means youre a pretty good killer and the more perks and addons you get the better you'll preform just based on fundamentals.
---
My friends accounts on my ps4 so I have every survivor and killer except vomit lady and Jane
---
*when they literally had to nerf Kate's hook scream*
---
http://www.mediafire.com/file/e27son9s1kejj14/pink_and_blue_galaxy_perks.rar/file here you go :)
---
Dont take this the wrong way but your ex has one of the most annoying screams I've ever heard lol
---
Pretty good JOB so far
---
The maps have not been fixed to warrant removal and consider the entity blockers dont work 50% of the time it'll be a looooooong time until bloodlust is removed
---
Look, I saw the post and replied in my own way. You can‚Äôt shame me or judge me for that. It‚Äôs not suddenly an absolute necessity to do research before stating your own thoughts.
---
The 1 hit down has to be charged up, you have plenty of time to run to a window or pallet, Plan well and you can force even the best billys 2 M1 you. 
---
Spirit might now have a insta down but she is so easy to play that she doesnt need one. She is the 2nd best killer and yet she is the easiest to play and learn.
---
have a nice day, jessie!
---
Barely had any time to enjoy this bloodhunt smh
---
You have different people who swear by each. 
---
Spine chill tells you when the killer is looking at You but not the direction. It does make you vault faster which is good. 
---
Premonition tells you the direction, so you can avoid, but it‚Äôs on a cool down. I personally run this.
---
If you want the adept its best to constantly glance around to just look out with OoO, also just hope to go against a bad freddy, sole survivor and object work weird in sleep, while asleep you ALWAYS see freddy and with sole it makes him useless with mindgames
---
It lingers on objects for 35 seconds by default. "Slightly" increased makes it last for 40 seconds and "moderately" increased makes it last for 45 seconds.
---
Imagining him in the booth voicing Bubba when he hits a wall ... HAHAHA
---
Lightborn and Shadowborn better than Bitter Murmur and Play With Your Food??? Some of this is kind of wack.
---
So.. did you escape?
---
So like 2 events in 2016 is the same as 2+ years of ebony moris and OP addons?
---
Was playing kyf with someone new to the game and I played doctor. When I just started shocking them a ton they asked who was laughing and I replied "both" and continued laughing like a maniac
---
Confused Laughter*
---
Walp bill is top so i agree
---
Do u wanna find out
---
These are always so well made üëç
---
Awwwww
---
It doesn‚Äôt really matter who you level up first, just find someone with a good perk you like using. I would recommend Meg, Nea or David as they have really good perks such as Adrenaline, Balanced Landing and Dead Hard.
---
I have an actual ticket open on the support website if that‚Äôs what you mean. 
---
If not - would you be able to point me in the right direction?
---
I require a shrine of meat for bubba
---
Yes, they are. So for this build you don't need any DLC ('coz you already have M&amp;A)
---
Level meg, shes has the most noob friendly perks
---
Cannibal, bbq and chili is the best killer perk in my opinion
---
There‚Äôs no voice chat. You can hide the text end chat.
---
I thought the notification was the trap activated. I wasn't aware the traps cause survivors to scream.
---
Toxic players will be toxic.
---
I just put the perks by color
---
I believe it, i can hear him singing raining blood too
---
Has science gone too far?
---
Noob? :(
---
spirit but just save shards for her
---
I agree with you on this. I replaced ruin with pop and found way more success. Especially when you throw in thanatophobia.

r u a killer main?
---
"Nerf this"
---
I think you missed Inner Strength. I swear I looked at this for five minutes and can‚Äôt find it
---
I don't believe they've ever missed a Halloween event, but we don't really have any info on what it'll be. I think there was a bit of a leak that said that it's just going to be the standard "event hooks/Gens" event like with other events that we've had in the past.
---
Money they can use on important things like brand deals and not improving quality of life.
---
yes it's true but some of its perks need to be combined with others to be effective
---
I‚Äôm good with this one.
---
Yeah last patch
---
The character needs to finished the "getting downed" animation before moving anywhere and same goes for getting up you cannot move a centimeter before these animations are done. You need to wait for both to finished to then move.
---
I started with Claudette because she's easier to hide with (as she's dark), see chases with empathy and keep yourself alive long enough to get out with self-care. But later self-care becomes a trash perk that you shouldn't use. After Claudette I leveled Meg to get adrenaline and then Dwight to get Bond.
---
I doubt it
---
Just got matched with 4 SWF players and idk why this Meg thought she was clever for dropping every pallet on the map and she would teabag me every time she drops one. Gens finished, one killed, one hooked, remaining 2 decides to come teabag me again and I NOED them. I would have kept the hatch open instead of letting the last one bleed to death if they had played nice though.
---
Ok that‚Äôs cool. 
---
Also Dwight has Bond and Prove Thyself, both of which can be very helpful.
---
Survivor rules have nothing to do with being nice. They were made by whiny cunts like you who can‚Äôt stand not beating every killer every game. Now you‚Äôre just triggered as all hell ‚Äútry playing survivor‚Äù lmao you have no clue.
---
Honestly, Demogorgon is really good, but in my opinion Ghost face is a really fun killer to play as
---
thanks!
---
I  didn‚Äôt get half of what I wanted done. The wait times for both survivor and killer was long (PS4).
---
To be fair survivors are still the power roll so yea even with "ebony moris and OP addons"
---
oops I forgot this park I him red color for information and thanks for the intensive research x)
---
I don‚Äôt understand why someone would wear white as Ghostface. It looks good, sure, but it makes him stick out. Same with the red, blue, shiny, and devil outfits.
---
There are much better songs out there.
---
I thought it was up for today as well, darn
---
Quentin knows what's up.
---
I think during the entire event I only ran into one killer who was up for farming shenanigans.
---
Your opinion ain't worth jack shit, IMO.
---
Awwww a fellow Ghosty, peeking round the tree, so cute!
---
Sumussa tavataan!
---
Links not working for me on mobile :(
---
Franklins demise. It breaks the item. As fair as that is.
---
I love it so much, with the exception to how op new Rule Set is. Thats dummy powerful lol
---
What's up with all of the sweaty Myers? &gt;\_&gt;;;
---
Have you done Demongoron yet?
---
Legion imo
---
Spirit.
---
I personally use BBQ, nurse 2\*, surveillance, then 4th is whatever you want, pop goes, ruin, discordance, MYC, ect
---
Nurses 2 because it makes your aura read the same as your TR so when survs are visible the TR is so quiet they cant hear it but you are in TR so no whoosh noise.
---
Then I plan to watch every killer :D
---
Yep! Thanks a lot. Was thinking of it for GF or pig and doing gen grabs.
---
Lololol, you never know man some people love their mains.  
---
There's people who love the spirit or the nurse and unironically refer to them as Rin and Sally.  Super Barf.
---
Fortunately, it‚Äôs possible for someone to make a reddit post AND learn. Crazy.
---
Im on ps4 and i need help!
---
Fixed by now.
---
Beat me to it.
---
It would probably cost them a pretty penny. Steve honestly had a pretty generic voice. While someone like Ash is a bit more iconic, you can tell it's Bruce screaming. But they probably spent a good amount of money to get this chapter considering it's 3 icons from the show.
---
Depends on your rank, and if your playing during peak hours (generally when its dark out wherever you live)
---
Yall have nice banter. You should do a YouTube.
---
I think you mean r/tihi
---
I mean, it's the top comment. Surely that doesn't take too much time or thought. Unless?  
---
&gt;"It's not suddenly an absolute necessity to do research before stating your own thoughts."  
---
Depends on the situation, but you're right to a degree. It's not a *necessity*. It does, however, make you look less dumb, as you'll avoid silly comments like, well, the one you made.
---
For gameplay and perks I'm gonna have to go with my THICC GASSY BOI.  
---
Pop goes the weasel is stupid good and bamboozle can be useful, especially on legion.
---
‚ÄúFirst time huh?‚Äù
---
How dare you camp / and tunnel. Not even fair man
---
Which actions produce a loud noise notification besides blowing a gen? I don't mean which actions are loud, but which ones can alert the killer across the map with a notification bubble?
---
In my experience at the lowest ranks everyone goes straight for the first gen. Middle ranks everyone walks around doing dulls and hiding until they can find the killer, confirm who it is, and then confirm they aren't after them. I don't know what happens in the high ranks. I've never been higher than 11 or 10.
---
How do you do this lol
---
Not yet - it's the one I'm absolutely least excited about doing tbh
---
Nothing wrong with that. We all call Lf Bubba.
---
I‚Äôm down to rank 8 now in killer and the survivors are doing extremely difficult movement to hit like they are running into me and spinning and I keep missing? Idk but it is frustrating. How do you counter this and how on their end are they doing it? I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
I was able to get Nancy to P3 from a fresh start and I'm starting to question if it was worth it
---
Trapper, clown, pig, wraith, doctor, legion in that order.
---
Trapper is screwed in his "set-up" now that the game's speed has increased. Look at older footage to now, the game is just a little bit faster. Giving him some options to make his set up faster or easier would be a boon. Locker traps is a dumb idea tbh but maybe making him carry double his carryable traps on him standard and then once he sets them he is set to his bag limit.
---
Clown needs help, he is so add on dependent that if you dont have the slow down add ons mid to high tier survivors will just outright be unaffected by your bottles. He isnt a huntress where his throwables can injure, so why are his bottles so bad, and yes i know about the exposed add on but thats an add on. Also shirtless clown/ santa clown
---
Pig needs to stop being nerfed and needs to be near ghost face levels of stealth killer. She's a stealth killer that gets her stealth screwed with. Her dash should be an M1 hit, its just an extended lunge, and similar to freddy you should only see the aura of the interactabe boxes AFTER her power becomes active on you ie. When the trap is beeping and ready to blow your head off.
---
Wraith is similar to pig in that he is a stealth killer but a lot of his stealth options are add ons, ghost, the 2 clappers, and the windstorm series are by far the only viable add ons. The rest are just memey and generally not even worth buying off the web unless you need to.
---
Doctor used to be a good mid tier killer, but has since fallen from grace. Make his add ons better and maybe make the brown chess piece default until you start charging. Theres also the fact that madness isnt that bad of a status anymore unless you hit 3 and your static field isnt that great of an anti stealth tool anymore since infectious fright became a thing and you can run it on insta down m1s.
---
Legion needs some asthma help. The 4.5 second stun when you want to cancel your power is so long, you also get slowed, and you cant use shadowborn to increase the vision on it unlike nurse. Also why can 5 blink nurse, a killer that can teleport through terrain and also down with their power have a shorter cool down after 5 blinks than a speedy gang that can only give you a single hit, and yeah their power recharges, but unless the next target is within 16 meters you cant catch them because they will run and you will run out of juice. Oh and button add ons are counter intuitive.
---
yeah but we're not all pretending bubba is our waifu ha ha ha  
---
unless...
---
50 shades of Jane
---
Rancor, Ruin, Haunted Ground and then one of the two perks I mentioned.
---
Legion
---
It was there, it was just followed by a killer DC 30 seconds after start.
---
But I still at least run into Clowns. Even this weekend I faced off against a few of them. Demo though is just completely MIA. It's as though he never existed now.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs over. Killer queues are complete shit during these.
---
I was the killer xD i killed no one
---
thank you! you too &lt;3
---
Touch√©. A match where everyone loses their offerings and add-ons for no good reason, and it happens regularly enough that it‚Äôs frustrating.
---
What, if any, other perks does surge trigger? I have heard surveillance does but wasn't sure about overcharge or pop and hadn't seen anything official. I figured that pop wouldn't since that could be incredibly overpowered in late game but might be fun to use overcharge or surveillance in an end game build
---
weird Iv ran into more demos since his release then I have clowns since his release so IDK lol
---
PS4 tho not sure if that makes a huge dif
---
Throwing down a pallet, vaulting a window or pallet while sprinting, or getting into a locker while holding the run key gives a notification
---
Is this official btw? I could‚Äôve sworn I met Jane‚Äôs VA at PAX east and the lady in the list definitely wasn‚Äôt her.
---
This is what I‚Äôm playing for
---
Oh that GF was mad mad
---
I assume you're talking about the 360 manoeuvre.  
---
The best way to counter it, in my opinion, is to wait until they've done their little dance, tracking them while they're doing it, and hitting them after getting a proper lock on them.  
---
You want to be close to them as well, since lunge attacks are easier to juke with the 360.
---
He is extremely correct, you should let him discover the game for himself. Also, maybe he could find a new team helping strategy if he isn‚Äôt good at the usual things.
---
As far as I'm aware, and based on the wording of all of the Perks, the only one it works with is Surveillance.
---
Thanks. What about sprinting out of the locker?
---
Fast vaulting a window, fast vaulting into/out of a locker, dropping a pallet, failing any skillcheck, cleansing an active totem, unhooking a survivor, leaving a chest before completing the search. Those are the basics. There are some extra ones depending on the killer/perks.
---
Using the chainsaw on a hill and bouncing off of tires or gens.
---
dont think that percentage is actually possible but ok
---
It‚Äôs funny cause I feel like I get the ebony ones more often, ivory is super useful
---
Must be so hard for you to be mindful *and* use Reddit at the same time.
---
I recommend getting rid of Rancor for either Pop Goes The Weasel or Thrilling Tremors.
---
 I think Whispers would be better than BBQ for Spirit but it all depends on wether or not you know how to find survivors. If you‚Äôre **really** good then you won‚Äôt need either BBQ or Whispers to find people.
---
Basically default killers corrupted by the Blight. 
---
I like how metaphorically this looks. The Blight shows their true face - corrupted and twisted by the entity
---
They already nerfed it not too long ago
---
Premonition makes it easier to see where there coming from, but the cooldown makes it not really viable compared to spine chill, which gives you info if the killer is looking+ action speed+ countering spirit mindgames + countering stealth killers without cooldown
---
I had a game last night with a Freddy who dced after getting looped for one minute. 3 minutes into the match, so my group lost 2 party streamers..
---
Suuuuuure
---
It loops back around to where everyone just does the first gen they find.
---
Spine chill is better. It depends on the *killer* looking at *you* and it has no cooldown.
---
Make adrenaline activate after every gen that's complete :D
---
How does he make the wraith stun sound??
---
How do I get the timing right for pallets? I feel like I can never get another loop and have to throw down early
---
like the other guy said just wait. theyll do their whole spin stuff but if u just stay with them youll get the hit when their done. Also wait when a survivor is injured for dead hard.
---
"How can a man so fat run so fast!" -Man Moried to death
---
Croatian or Serbian but I'm leaning towards Serbian because of his last name Ivanoviƒá.
---
Borrowed time and we‚Äôll make it are pretty meta lol
---
FINALLY SOMEONE DID IT
---
wait leaving a chest gives a notification?
---
Because the entity does not allow any weapons that could potentially harm or completely remove killers from the equation. A survivor with a weapon is not one with fear. Survivors improvise and use broken shards of glass and wood found in trials.
---
I think it would be just cool if this was her chase music. Kinda bummed she doesn't have a unique chase music.
---
feel like I wasn‚Äôt rude, just explaining to him what I do in situations like this.
---
KEKW
---
The most exciting and fun games are not particularly linked to "winning". Many times a 4k high BP match can be quite mundane. Other times I finish a game that had my pulse racing and I get -1 pip and shit BP.
---
that‚Äôs fair tbh LMAO
---
Ash literally was put out just to be shot in the knee caps and told to run from the killer while looking badass.
---
BREAK THE FUCKING PALLET
---
^or ^at ^least ^fake ^it
---
BREAK THE DAMN PALLET, MY DUUUUUUDE!
---
Hell no
---
a c t I v a t e   w I n d o w s
---
Yes. Only if you leave before you're finished searching it though. There may be another caveat that I've forgotten.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
So fucking amazing!!!
---
Lol, love it how they are all having a good time then you kill the claudette and they all run in fear
---
I mean the beeping does get more frequent the closer it gets to popping, but adding the theme song to the game would require yet another license, to the music, and I doubt BHVR is going to fork out more money for an existing property.
---
It would be the best crossover in History.
---
I mean...
---
No u
---
I GOT THE JOB!
---
DO DO DO DO DO DO DOO
---
Actually what about Freddy as a killer and you get an arcade map. The Automaton.
---
I really hope this awful matchmaking doesn‚Äôt turn new players away. I‚Äôm only a rank 9 survivor. Got in a match with other rank 7-8s and a rank 20 billy with one perk. 
---
We got 4 generators done before he even hit someone and we all escaped without him getting a hook. At first I was riding the high of such a good game by survivors until I saw his rank and then I just felt bad that we completely steamrolled this player who was probably brand new due to bad matchmaking
---
At least $40
---
Ah, I always thought he was a communist trying to go to SCHPAYCE!
---
I need to know the ludest of the lude, who voices Steve Harrington
---
Honestly it's just practice. There isn't really a magic formula you can follow.
---
The door is on your left
---
Honestly, that's so petty it's ridiculous. I'm not saying that I approve of child rapists (I feel like I have to clearly state that because, you know, Reddit), just that to deny the addition of a great character solely because of something the creator of it did is silly, as are the people who would fuss if the character were added.
---
Hey man you can add me. I‚Äôm not amazing by any means but can hold my own most games as a survivor or killer. My PSN is Slugger_VII
---
No, it isn‚Äôt normal. But you are playing at the very bottom and new killers haven t learned that camping is shooting then selves on the foot.
---
NOED is one of my favorite perks to face in general as well. It really adds another layer of decision for my play at endgame. I can go look for the totem and save that one teammate on the hook but also put myself at huge risk or just leave and accept that I can't get them. Also being on a hook and seeing my team scrambling and somehow saving me from the hook with it active or looking everywhere for it just to fail leads to some cool moments.
---
Happens too often
---
If I bring an iridiscent key, the hatch spawn after first gen? One year playing and still don't know how keys work :(
---
lol stranger yet
---
They prevent tunneling meaning that you tunnel
---
Thats a notification too
---
And what few patches have come out since they changed dev teams have taken forever and just added even more catastrophic bugs. Jason can completely break a car by hitting it with a throwing knife
---
Your* ;)
---
okay, May I ask, how does camping shoot killers in the foot?
---
Well blood hound, predator and technician don‚Äôt need to be paired up to be effective. ( And yes i know you might be thinking ‚ÄúTeChnIcIan Is sUcH a bAd PerK‚Äù it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs really good for stealth and trust me it comes in clutch)
---
what about FNAF? The Automaton would be kinda neat
---
I prefer Spine Chill. I used to run Premonition, but I find I prefer Spine Chill because it has no cooldown, won't go off if the killer is, say, chasing someone else and not even looking your way some distance away like Premonition can, and helps with speed as well.
---
I like being able to know that the killer is facing me and close enough to set off Spine Chill. I think it's a very useful perk.
---
huh... literally who cares about the race of the voice actors LOL
---
Rip to all the poor people waiting for the hatch
---
im kinda glad they changed it lol
---
I played bloody party streamers for times during this event as killer and only one team didn't rush generators
---
He literally rushed for Gate B instead of helping you...
---
everyone does
---
Key's don't affect the hatch spawns at all. You can only use it to open the hatch once it has spawned or been closed to escape. (Unless you put on different addons)
---
The entity saw more potential in Rin.
---
No way it would never work, Bigger Jaws on the other hand...
---
&gt;I had a Ghostface tell us "I'm not here to give you a fun game" after he camped and tunneled us. 
---
Yeah, but it's more fun when the killer tries to make the game fun. The hierarchy:
---
S: Hard fought game of equal skill between survivors and killer, regardless of outcome
---
A: Not quite evenly matched, but the killer tweaks their performance to make it fun for everyone
---
B: Not quite evenly matched, neither side leaves the other completely high and dry, but the end result is skewed heavily in one or the other's favor
---
C: Significant disparity in skill, no mercy from the favored side
---
D: Killer facecamps and NOED
---
F: D-tier with teabagging
---
They are def strong perks. But they are meant to help against killers who only go for single targets. Try to hook somone, then go check the gens to see if you can find another person.
---
You can hear his contagious laugh from this meme alone.
---
I use Monitor &amp; Abuse to become an even stealthier Spirit. It makes spotting survivors at a distance before they spot you even easier.
---
Unrelenting is also a good perk if you're still practicing your phase-hits and want less of a penalty when you miss

Sharp Knife: gain the ability to M1 the killer

I‚Äôd just make it so you take 4 or 5 regular hits to activate it and then it would put you into deep wounds instead of just having the hit ignored

Sorry to hear that that's your experience of this game. The survivors in my region seem to be unable to run the killer at all but are decent at sitting on gens, so it's usually viable for me to take a few hits and run the killer. And yeah, you'd typically need to use a perk to find the chase which is why I run empathy. I understand if you don't use aura perks in your build, run whatever works for you, I'm just sharing what works for me. you're right that those percentages are mostly random, it's just data from my matches combined with a general understanding. The 40% is because I escape through the hatch roughly that much when I'm in that situation, and it's a 50/50 chance (but I knocked off 10% due to killers having more freedom of movement and faster speed). The 25-30% was a conservative estimate since I escape roughly 50% of the time, but that average can't hold true for everyone. I honestly find that solo survivor is less stressful because I don't need to pay attention to what others are doing as well, though increased info is often nice
---
Offer something constructive.
---
Definitely worth it, you can even use both if you want so.  I'd even want dedicated servers to never come  just so I can keep using MLEB.
---
If you want to counter flashlights, you could run lightborn and just ignore them completely. More importantly, LB gets you free hits because survivors don't know you have it. They try to blind you, and oops didn't work. That actually helps you *win*, unlike Franklin's.
---
I mean, you could just look at a fucking wall. Or bluff the pickup and check for the nearby rescuer. But no, that's clearly too difficult for you, better bring a perk.
---
You said yourself you switch from the killer you wanted to play to Legion, specifically because they have Franklins. That, as i previously stated, is pathetic.
---
Damn you took down 2 reds and you‚Äôre in green ranks
---
Just stating facts buddy.
---
For anyone who missed it look at the bottom right.
---
Why must be so limiting in options? It could‚Äôve been both IRL annnd online. 
---
Stay thirsty my friend
---
you apply zero pressure to gens when youre camping a hook, thus  losing the game and survivors will finish the remaining gens.
---
Agreed, I've heard others like "The Pennywise" or "The IT" but it doesn't stick as well as "The Deadlights"... it has a ping to it that makes it sound good.
---
Alright, thank you friend
---
Well you're new arent you?
---
Hot water pipe is inside the wall from half way up. Cool water runs into it to stop it being too hot. Makes sense to me
---
90 + 10 = 100
---
I dont know if this is impressive or just shows the lack of creativity part by the dbd team
---
You arent dkinewhg wrong.
---
They're not focusing on other gens/survivors so while the camped player might die, a good group could easily get 3-4 gens in that time. If he camps again he's basically guaranteeing the last 2 escape. Plus you get points for stopping gens, attacking more survivors, etc.
---
Empathy is extremely underrated. I always run it if I need to do a save daily, and then I remember just how good it is.
---
I wouldn't recommend it, no. The 360 manoeuvre is much more useful in the lower ranks than in the high ranks. In the high ranks, it's all about loops, pallets and windows.  
---
Looping is undoubtedly the strongest defence survivors have against most killers. Some loops are stronger against a certain set of killers, while the same loops might be weaker against another set of killers. You'll learn more about which loops are good against which killers the more you play.
---
Perhaps the exit gates are meant to be difficult when you're alone. (After the killer has already, killed 3 other survivors, AND found the hatch first.  Yall still think you deserve yet another easy way out)

I never said they aren't intentional. I said they shouldn't exist.
---
Alright cool then now shut the fuck up when people run adrenaline, DS, BT, insta heals etc.
---
&gt; Unless hes running DS and most survs do. Then you have to chase for the  same amount of time. If he jumps in a locker you've also kinda fucked  yourself. You either wait outside of 1min or you run off and try to find  the healthy one that you let escape. 
---
Most survs do? Dunno where you play, but I barely see DS, maybe once every 3 games, and I'm currently on rank 2, but I only play like 2 games a day, or I'm just lucky. Since it was nerfed, it's not that dominant anymore. I'm a lot more scared of other perks. 
---
&gt;That's literally what I said, You can camp AND tunnel though. It's not an either/or.
---
When I'm on the other side of the map currently in a chase, I'm not aborting that chase for the unhook, but if I'm currently around without anything better to do because I have no leads on other survs, I'll go back. Idk if that's tunneling to you. To me, it's smart gameplay.
---
That lag was way too smooth, definitely potential lagswitch. He would've been rubberbanding at least a little if he were lagging that bad.
---
I love the details, the perk Monstrous Shrine in grey made me laugh
---
Man, I feel that man. Fucks with me every time to, Goddamn spirit.
---
I love how the only one that escaped was the only one not capped.
---
Ouch that's rough.  Weird that he was a carebear to the rest of the team.  You must have had that type of face you just have to hit repeatedly over and over.
---
Funny enough my worst game experience was against a rank 3 Billy on the new Hawkins map.  He bodyblocked me into a chainsaw catching me on a dull totem of all things near the start of game lol.  He then hard camped the ever loving shit out of me trying to force me into 2nd stage.  I got farmed and downed immediately and left for slug for DS (which I wasn't even running at the time lol) before being rehooked after he downed the potato random.  He didn't use his chainsaw a single time outside of the first bodyblock one.  He played him as mindless as one possibly play a Billy by simply barreling through pallets M1 with Spirit Fury/Enduring.  Weird thing is he was running insta saw.....go figure.
---
Every survivor could escape most of the killers' grasp with a swift elbow to the back of the head
---
Sadly legion, my favorite killer is clown though, I would say at their best legion is better by a medium gap.
---
Someone corrected me earlier. Catherine didn't voice Jane. Besides that, the rest of the list is accurate (a majority of the photos here come from a tweet by BHVR a few years back and some of them are from dev streams).
---
I just hope all these nurses with pink moris, prayer beads spirits and unlimited ew III myerses will realise that the reason they have absurd amount of queue times is that survivors have zero fun with these builds combined with toxic behaviours. Most of them will probably switch to killer after some amount of games like that and for every player who gives up on playing survivor you need FIVE other players willing to play survivor in order for the queue times to stay the same - 1 to replace them and 4 more for their own lobby and then game.
---
My first time in red ranks during blood hunt but god, it was an awful experience from survivors viewpoint, even worse if I wanted to play together with my purple or green rank friends.

Red Paint Brush+Swing Chains Freddy. Drop a snare in front of all your clocks and let Swing Chains work it‚Äôs magic on slowing down the game, the survivors will have a horrible time trying to wake up, and gens will go so incredibly slow it‚Äôs ridiculous. Stack with Ruin, maybe Dying light too if you‚Äôre feeling spicy, and it becomes less of a build and more of a war crime
---
Identity thefts not a joke jim
---
What if you wanted the mori all survivors achivement but the entity said: N O
---
I love how you are giving the killers a list of rules that should should follow because you are butthurt over Franklin's. I never mentioned Legion and don't play as them. What works for some people just works for them. Stop sounding like the very thing you are bitching about it sounds... pathetic.
---
if you want to play like a twat fine but accept your playing like a twat
---
Hah jokes on you, I barely run ruin but run BBQ in every single build; easy choice.
---
Moze!
---
No doubt man.  So yes when the EGC Collapse was added to the game the devs reworked Pigs traps so they wouldn't be broken with the new hatch close mechanic.  Now a trap is only activated if a gen is popped after it's put on.  So if you trap them after all gens are done or if the trap was unactive and they close the hatch triggering the EGC Collapse the trap doesn't activate anymore.  It's basically just a cosmetic at that point.  All dude had to do was leave lol.  Tried messaging him but his messaging was blocked.  This is why you don't block messaging on PS4 lol.
---
Sounds about the same as I play most of the time unless I really need bps. I see little to no issues
---
Don't bash on Feng Min's voice she's bae ;(
---
Hence the "punny" title lol that was the Nea.
---
We couldn't get her to join party so we all agreed with killer she can leave and keep her flashlight since we couldn't get her to cooperate otherwise.
---
Killer couldn't figure what she had maxed our what she needed for survival but figured the 5,000 for escape would help
---
Clown
---
He's baiting you.  Just leave him be.
---
That's largely a hypothetical based on math. Dying on hook takes up to 2 minutes, each Survivor can fix a Generator in just under 1.5 mins. So, in theory, if the Survivor on the hook doesn't attempt escape during phase 1 and struggles all throughout phase 2, and the other 3 Survivors each work on a separate Generator the entire time the Killer is camping, the Killer basically gives up 3 out of the 5 Generators in order to kill one Survivor. And if all 3 remaining Survivors work on the same Generator during that last 30 seconds, they could in theory get 4 Generators done, putting them just 1 away from escaping. So, purely by the numbers, camping should mean the Killer secures 1 kill but all other Survivors escape as a result.
---
That's rarely what happens in practice. A lot of Survivors play really altruistically, and a lot of hooked Survivors get impatient. Realistically, the Survivor on the hook waits maybe 20 seconds, then attempts escape a couple times and goes straight into phase 2. When he sees no one is running to save him, he gives up struggling and dies on hook in maybe 45 seconds.
---
Meanwhile, at least 2 of the other Survivors has been crouching nearby, watching things unfold, hoping the Killer will get bored and leave. Or they get sick of waiting, or just want Bloodpoints, so they decide to rush in and unhook the Survivor right in front of the camping Killer. At best, this results in a hook trade, with the hooked one escaping but the rescuer ending up hooked and camped, and the cycle repeats like musical hooks until everyone's dead. At worst, the Killer pulls off an interrupt grab, has another hook nearby, and is now camping two people on hooks.
---
So, despite the numbers, real world Survivor behavior makes camping pretty effective for Killers more often than not.
---
I think it mentioned this in the patch notes... if I'm correct the EGC timer is out of sync with the actual time. This causes the early death that you speak of.
---
 Any tips for avoiding excruciating executions? I would time myself and think about it. If someone is on a hook and I don't have a perk that will help me or the person on hook, I should leave, if I have borrowed and a med kit of some sort than Ill go in for a save and dip in to save them, if I die, I die. It's a risk worth taking and I quite frankly feel good if the guy makes it out.

Thanks so much

People post vids on here daily.  You're fine.

---
Almost every game as killer Id do a little wiggle and the survivors instantly started working with me to farm. Loved the cooperation

And if you don‚Äôt dc, you can only spectate.

That's some highly scientific statistics right there. Considering how nearly half the player base on EU servers are Russians to start with. :) You're seeing what you want to see, not how it actually is. And then randomly pull stats out of your ass to back your personal feelings up. We both know that 85% figure is made up, cause no one actually did any math, right?
---
I would say that is not typical gameplay. You'll definitely come across it at times, but give it a few more goes 'cause that is NOT what you will experience every game!
---
Any constructive criticism and advice would be greatly appreciated.
---
Discordance currently has 8/10/12. I don‚Äôt see a point in the buff. It‚Äôs best keeping it at 8 second call down so tier 1 discordance. 5 is too short
---
Or you could ignore Syrex and play like a decent human being who wants everyone they are *playing a game with* to have fun. During double-digit ranks, the game is insanely Killer-biased (and I say this as a Killer main), and you will have easy access to multiple strategies and perks that basically guarantee you a win against most survivors (camping, tunneling, NOED, playing Nurse or Hillbilly, etc.). At that point you're not winning through skill, you're letting the game win for you. People who take pleasure in that must be pretty sad excuses for human beings.
---
I just want matches to last longer so I can actually get somewhere as Pig without "slow teh game down a lil bit" perks.
---
Hell, I want to be able to actually stalk and torment survivors instead of "oh god, I NEED to get the hit now and put the hat on before the next 3 gens pop in 2 seconds".
---
Same goes for me as survivor. I want more interesting objectives that contribute to one or many methods of escape. Not just sit and hold M1 and occasionally press spacebar. Give me objectives where I have to go find shit or complete a puzzle or something. Anything, I am getting tired of all the new "objectives" just being "hold M1 for x seconds".
---
Fun Fact: Currently Calm Spirit actually suppresses the hook scream so you'll be fine. I love Steve's screams he should be a singer

I get that most of this posts are a joke, but what do you want, devs can't Just make your q times shorter, it takes People and because you need 4 survs and Just 1 killer the q times are a lot longer. What do yal want bots or a 1v1 Mode?

Breaking a pallet using the space bar takes 2.7s and breaking a pallet with shred takes 2.9s

All they need to do to fix mettle of man is fix protection hits. So many times I'll literally jump in front of the killer while they're chasing someone else and I won't get a protection hit
---
Yeah I always found that funny. Like, they have a knife, but all David or even Jake/Bill/etc have to do is grab a hatchet from the lockers and I'm pretty sure they could overpower the legion/Amanda.

I'm a Pig main, but I'm no expert in building a solid load out with perks (for any killer or survivor).  Right now, I'm using:

- Ruin
---
- Surveillance
---
- Rancor

- Thrill Of The Hunt (I switch this out for NOED if I have weak addons/offerings)
---
What are your thoughts on this load out, and what would you suggest I change?

It has so many great loops though

Yes. These perks are meant to be hard counters to these killers, and spirit when she phases.

Or how good it is. In most competitive games you don't see players deliberately forgoing smart play in favor of a positive experience.

You're not a "dummy" though for playing other versions of the game. Obviously PC has the best performance, but others are fine.

Pallet break 2.7s

Shred pallet break 2s. Although shred is needed to be charged first. It takes 1s to fully charge shred but it can be triggered once the charge is 65% done so 0.65s

So it is indeed faster.

Could use to bait pallet drop and shred instantly for 2s. Or charge shred and use on already dropped pallet for min. 2.65s

Well it depends on what meter stick you use. Some would say that despite its glaring flaws, it's still a successful game that's lasted years and given some players hundreds or even thousands of hours of enjoyment. Hard to call any game badly designed with that kind of success.
---
I argue that the game needs improvement all the time, but just calling the game bad is too reductive to even agree with. People should talk more about the specific issues they have with the game and what could be changed.
---
i just can't believe anyone could go on THIS long, this must be staged
---
why noed on a michael
---
Just yesterday, I popped the last gen and a totem literally next to it, lit up like a Christmas tree. Cleansed it immediately and was right by a door that another survivor was opening (killer was way over the other side of the map).
---
Amazing for us, not so much for the poor Huntress.
---
Pretty much, but don't tell people that. They'll get upset. They don't understand that the bloodhunt bonus is additive, like literally every offering in the game that provides a bonus gain in BP.
---
Or more simply put: the number of survivors +1 gen
---
NOED on myers? Brotha
---
And everyone else is crouched approx. 3 meters away, all waiting to unhook
---
Could it be... "Hex: Gon' Give it to 'Ya"?
---
Not every perk needs to be used in every single trial, look at deliverance, nobody bitches about that. Deliverance rewards you for team play and has the downside of being broken. Why? Because it is saving you from something negative by being very poweful, this is called balance. My suggestion rewards team play while also being balanced. It gives an invincibility which is why it causes exhaustion. Survivor perks need to be balanced around the fact that 4 of them can be used and they need a counter. I know most would rather just have 1 save = free hit, no downside. Thats not good.
---
im not fucking surprised, do you?
---
Well, finding in less than 2 minutes the Killer Hex Totem, which is a perk slot in use, kinda fucks the only thing that can give some start time to find a survivor, and 3 if not 4 survivors with toolboxes and repair speed add-ons, start doing gens in the blink of an eye, is as toxic/fun to the killer as a mori is to a survivor.
---
I don't understand why he didn't just break the pallet.
---
Rookie numbers.
---
Also some variants like the shotgun collar and some head traps from the saw games
---
Kate back then when se was at the PTB

Yeah, I met her at PAX (god I wish I could remember her name, she had green hair at the time).

I also met Emilie Deshcamps cause I was dressed as Susie, they‚Äôre all super sweet and nice.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem to be that great for her

TBH the legion does probably need a buff, but they have to be careful with how they balance them as a killer.
---
It does t work on tier 1 Myers. Everyone else, yes.

Ummmmmmm Steve should be beyond s tier

It's so weird!! I've come across so many uncool ghostfaces, gosh dangit, stop giving perfectly fine killers a bad name! Geez. Hugs to you, my ghostly friend :)

They are similar but that's not the same quote lol.

*suvivor playing at 30 Ping
---
4 or 5 too many and silly. You don't take 4 or 5 hits in a standard match. Most of us take 2 hits per match at most, and that's a wrap.
---
endymion_sleeps complains about the way people play this game a month ago on reddit then gives me shit for saying fuck how people WANT you to play this game - Play it so YOU have fun.
---
Hypocrite bitch
---
Thats BS because your team can pop 4-5 generators while one person is being tunneled. Sure it sucks for that one, but the killer loses too. That's why its not viable. The mistake survivor teams make is FEEDING into a toxic killer, rewarding them. Don't.
---
I don‚Äôt know dude, I never use him, I didn‚Äôt even know /s

If one survivor dc‚Äôs, bad luck for his buddies. No mercy. If 2 dc, I‚Äôm ghostface the survivor.

You could've let her on the ground and close the hatch, and even with Adrenaline, she wouldn't got away.

Do you get less healing points when you heal with +2 stacked autodidact?

I never use Myers, it was just there I guess

Could be wrong I'm pretty sure it's also the blink range

Wholeheartedly agreed. I like playing this game, and a big part of what makes it enjoyable is HELLO! Other people!! Even if we are competing, we're all still playing a game together :) I love when I come across folks with that same mindset! We're all friends in the sweet embrace of the Entity!
---
It's confirmed
---
It‚Äôs has been posted several times likely. Personally I‚Äôm ok with it. It‚Äôs a little hard to search for a particular clip, and posts get lists In the tide overnight. Plus it‚Äôs a fun clip
---
Wasn‚Äôt it someone from BHVR too?
---
In the second movie and game, he‚Äôs had tons of different names
---
Yeah I play both killer and survivor equally and his argument makes 0 sense to me. How would anyone get 3 unhooks if even 2 people used MoM
---
Honestly agreed, survivor is either miserable or just boring most of the time, s o m e t h i n g has to change about survivors gameplay, it‚Äôs boring as shit if things go good- the most fun I have is when the killer memes around or when the game bugs out. There‚Äôs a reason I don‚Äôt play survivor anymore
---
Interestingly, you, too, complained on a different sub about player toxicity... hmm. Also, I called your post how it reads: a bunch of "I" statements against a phantom menace. I didn't say anything about as how you mentioned it - you *read into* it.  Nice end statement, by the way - brings out your true colors.
---
I try not to run after the killer for ds cause I'm not a toxic shit but most of the people I know just use it as anti tunneling
---
Whats nea
---
I forgot to upload it is what, derp.
---
I disagree. He needs to match his trailer. Honestly I'm all for increasing the time in his power drastically, remove the miss penalty, leave Deep Wounds as it is, but remove his terror radius or make it TINY when he's not in frenzy. He's supposed to blend in with the survivors. He sticks out like a sore thumb.
---
But if DS were a true anti-tunnel perk, I wouldn‚Äôt need to let her on the ground. The perk‚Äôs timer should stop if the killer hooks somebody else.
---
That would mean you just die more quickly - letting you move on to the next game while the first is still going.
---
I wonder what he sounds like when he orgasm
---
Pretty underwhelming bloodhunt.
---
I felt like my friend and I were the only ones bringing cakes and streamers, and every killer felt like they were more tryhard sociopath than usual.
---
Though that one Doctor who farmed with us I will carry his memory in my heart always.
---
Sounds like a .. fun person :\

that would make decisive useless and more situational then unbreakable

Leatherface called The Cannibal, Freddy Krueger called The Nightmare, Amanda is Pig.

He's a hard killer to master and not particularly strong, unless you're running impossible skillchecks on a small map.
---
I stand by all my end statements
---
I got ‚Äúbong bong‚Äôd‚Äù in this situation
---
You managed to rank up? With how fucked up the ranking system is, its been very difficult. I keep these rank 5s with their rank 20 friends constantly giving me black pips at best.
---
+1
---
Making them like a stealth killer would be amazing, but they‚Äôd have to reduce their movement speed back to what it was, which means their power would have to down again aaaaaaand they won‚Äôt do that. 
---
Having a very small terror radius by default would be a risky change and I could see survivors complaining a ton, but I‚Äôm not totally sure. I never thought about that.
---
How? If you get tunneled you‚Äôll still get to use it.
---
Ds always makes me tunnel them more than if they didn't have it. It makes me go from hooking a survivor, letting them get hooked and go heal or something to NOPE, YOU'RE DEAD.
---
Eh, I disagree. It can definitely be frustrating when you get hit with DS when you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong (they run into you instead of you going after them, for example) because then it feels like you‚Äôre getting punished for their mistake. But it‚Äôs definitely in a fine spot. As the other guy said, you could‚Äôve just left him on the floor.
---
I always leave last guy on the floor in this situation, and I‚Äôll start a 60 second timer on my phone. If they move, just follow them on the ground and close hatch if they get near it. It *is* an anti tunnel perk, but it has counterplay.
---
if I'm working on last gen and there's a dull totem nearby I'll usually leave it up till after gen pops, especially if I haven't cleansed any totems in that game.
---
"Complex" lol
---
Lol, I knew I saw that name quite a bit while looking on the wiki at the actors.
---
As do all your fellow 14 year-olds.
---
Recently uploaded and he explains his process. It seems way more to chance than something you can actively achieve every game.  https://youtu.be/1Hs8dcTqReU
---
Survivor scoring is kinda broken. The whole system is broken.
---
Lol I like how they just all immediately scattered like birds
---
or we can just leave it how it is cause it's perfectly fine
---
Complex.  If you're still why is her idle the same as when you husk, that seems pretty bullshit.
---
You were dared to get rank 1? On today's episode of fiction stories..
---
i mean....thats fine
---
just dont be mad if people say you play like a cunt.
---
we can all co-exist ~~i also play killer alot, FYI~~
---
but if you do nothing you get no points.
---
I know I could‚Äôve left him on the floor, but the point I‚Äôm trying to make is that DS isn‚Äôt an anti-tunnel perk in all situations. In this situation it was a get out of jail free perk.
---
Rams straight through the pallets
---
Most 14 year olds CAN read though
---
ToXiC gAmEr
---
Oh I think about this all the time. I think its just because people are so scared of the horrible shit people might say to them after the game etc. People would rather just go easy than try and win because no matter what you do someones gonna be pissed and call you awful things. This game just brings out the worst in people, its kind of astounding.
---
Only if you try to mind game pallets.  Just run one loop, drop the pallet and on to the next.   There is another one every couple of feet in that place that a pallet tour is more than enough time to complete all gens.  With a special fuck you to any 110 movement speed killer.
---
Honestly when I saw the trailer I thought they were supposed to be a stealth killer. They really need to be, make their non frenzy state slower and their frenzy state faster but they still need to be as advertised.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
I was getting damn near instant matches at red rank killer last night with the swf change most are in purples/red now
---
Where?
---
She got out of jail free because you didn‚Äôt leave them on the ground lol.
---
Old DS was a get out of jail free. And I agree, that very rarely it can still feel like one (if they‚Äôre crawling to the exit and you have no choice but to eat the DS). This isn‚Äôt one of those times though. You simply misplayed it.
---
Not Richie? Id love to play as Bill Hader
---
Nice job with the save, but what do you mean by Ghotscript?
---
Lol if all you want to do is stand there and stare at pixels go for it but please don't use mental gymnastics to label it as anything else other than what it is.  It isn't "immersive play" man it's called camping.  Do it if you get off on trolls but don't kid yourself about it.  
---
See you say you could give a fuck about my opinion yet you took to Reddit to create this post asking us literally what we think about your approach to the game.  Also it isn't "my rules or rhetoric."  If you were to watch any of the leading killer streamers in the game you'd see my advice checks out.
---
Stop bitching and wait 60 seconds like every one else for god sake. I‚Äôm so sick of you people whining over any perk that finally actually helps a survivor. You‚Äôre RED rank, dude.
---
Is this the same david that ran a wraith around in an OhTofu vid?
---
Do botany, self care and streetwise stack? Consumption wise.
---
Especially when that person is literally calling you to be chased, Simply ignore her/him and head to the nearest gen and if there's any progress look around for a bit.
---
The amount of times this has happened to me standing in the open even amazes me. It's like nobody sees you if you don't move :P
---
2 of you examples are nurse and spirit which are what 2 of the 4ish killers who are actually viable at redranks against good survivors. Sure ebony mori is strong if you can get the downs to begin with hopefully the survivors are not all super optimal at looping! and yea prayer bead spirit is very strong yes but there are ways to counter it. Insta down huntress isint as strong as ppl like to think she can be outplayed as long as you dont get greedy while looping her. as for nurse she could use a slight tone down sure but a optimal team will still win against even a very good nurse. If you ont like being tunneled bring DS. If your team hasnt popped all the gens while you are being chased by a m1 killer  including DS chase then your team wasnt optimal at all. as for event toxicity my point was that it exists on both sides.
---
Spent more time waiting lobbies than playing but aight
---
I went from Level 24 Ghostface to P1 Level 34 Ghostface in 2 days.
---
I'd love to play as Richie but Bill and Bev seem like the main ones
---
That right there is the fucking truth
---
Aka 3 genning
---
That's actually a badass cosmetic idea, a completely blank mask
---
I'm at about 400 hours now. And I still can't play good consistently. My first 50ish hours or so as a survivor, I was the first to get hooked and sacrificed MANY times. But as with everything, the more you play, the better you get. So my answer is yes: that is some part of the gameplay. You'll learn to do better. Takes time. Watch some playthroughs of other high-ranking survivors/killers. Learn from them.
---
Killers ranked, according to Rank 20.

tinkerer and territorial imperative, territorial to know when ppl go to the basement and if you're lucky tinkerer proc and 0 terror radius, or you can use the plague perk when you hit your obsesion he get the TR

I dont see whats so bad about it, and anyway some spawns should be worse than others, they are luck based.
---
Well, don't know your rank, but I move between Red Rank 2-4, they bring the map knowing how to use it, and they indeed use it, I've seen more toxicity from survivors than from killers in this x2 event, one of the "funniest" examples I've encountered is a 4 SWF all with object of obsession, 2 purple flashlights, map and key, on a map with an infinite loop and plenty of pallets, with a T-bag in every single pallet drop and flashlight blind, but yeah, a survivor sees a mori, and DC's because is the "most" toxic thing in this game, sure...
---
im not even going to respond to this, the perfect counter argument is to just read it but have every word "lOok liKe tHIs"
---
Well yeah he has, thats his whole power, shutting down loops.
---
I would definitely fuck with michael for this reason specifically lol
---
huh, that's an interesting take. I actually love post-game salt, but face-camping is boring and it's not worth trying hard enough to get to red-ranks which is truly devoid of fun. Especially now that it takes about 10-20 minutes to get in games as a killer, I want to *play* more than I want to win.
---
I'm pretty sure they based the Dweard cosmetic on him.
---
Original designs oogli
---
Not that impressive because all they do is laugh grunt or scream
---
Honestly I am glad it's over. The first ever bloodhunt (which is like 1.5 year ago) I participated in there were kind survivors, farming killers, and overall just fun.
---
The bloodhunts afterwards have been full of selfish survivors (I blame WGLF), sweaty af killers (tunneling, camping, etc), and just frustration all around.
---
The one game where 3 bps were used, the killer (a doc) just tunneled me into oblivion. Feltrealbadman.
---
Out of all the games, I only had one friendly killer. Though I am not saying a killer shouldn't kill or anything, but I saw more sweat and powerful addons than I normally see. Waaaay more. So glad it's over lol.
---
Anyone has ever used it?
---
Ah, makes sense. Human designs clearly weren‚Äôt BHVR‚Äôs best attribute.
---
What will it be cause I can only find the stuff from the April rework
---
I'm done arguing about who said what because all you're doing is avoiding everything else I'm saying.
---
You say that 5 seconds is to little, I saying that you just don't want more powerful perks in the game. So?
---
Offerings are multiplicative with We're Going To Live Forever though right?
---
Pigs addons doing different things with her traps would be so cool
---
I wouldn't call the game *bad* either. I wouldn't play a bad game for over 800 hours. But it has obvious flaws that shouldn't exist this late into its development.
---
 It's clear that some killers are much better than the others, rendering them nearly useless, same goes for perks - Thanos wouldn't approve. Not to mention the hitboxes and other bugs, even game breaking ones like the no escape exit gates.
---
I had a killer ask to farm. We farmed for a looooong time. I maxed out on essentially all of my points. Then he DCd. I had played my one and only BPS. And my friend played a gateau. Fuck me :)
---
Just had to make sure it was shit for Huntress before I call it shit
---
Agreed!, Maybe there could be different contraptions depending on the trap and the player would need to find the right one
---
Because the game is a game and was balanced as a game. 
---
Giving every killer an instadown would kill the game.
---
If they could raise their hand, the flashlights wouldn‚Äôt have existed
---
Armor would be a bit confusing, but MIGHT work. All items are something one holds in their hand tho
---
No. Not a single BP bonus offering, perk or event in the game is or ever has been multiplicative. They're all additive.
---
Yes the perks are meta because they're good but NOED, BBQ,  and Ruin don't help end chases. The best perk I could think of is Spirit Fury but I don't have Spirit. The meta doesn't really help end chases.
---
The devs didn't reveal any details on what will be the change yet so we'll have to wait.
---
The only thing we know is that we will surely get a rework
---
Legit like no I can't bring myself to play this map when I play as Huntress The game is bad enough
---
That sounds pretty cool tbf and I'd like to see how they'd do the power
---
so he gets his points but I don‚Äôt get mine? Super bullshit
---
Anger
---
I like it, I think I'm all ears is an underrated perk. I run it and it really helps with mind games and knowing where the survivor is going on a loop
---
Figuratively. But yeah, and a third gen can spawn on the left and right sides of that dock if you are unlucky for a nasty 3 gen strat,
---
But suffocation pit is worse. Gens there can spawn even closer! (Although its more rare for it to do so)
---
Probably because looking back on it now, it works out nicely presently. I know you're hoping that he's making a racist insinuation so that you can try to be a SJW.
---
So it can't spawn near a generator, a hook or even pallets... totems need to spawn outside the map? Then you'll be happy?
---
Oh i love post game salt too. Especially since I dont play like an asshole, but i do play to win so people always find something to be mad at even though ive done nothing other than play the game.  Regardless of winning or losing tho, someones gonna give you shit for it, thats the beauty of it i guess.
---
Would not surprise me, but it would sadden me. All the Dweards I meet are total pricks but McLean seems like a nice guy :(
---
Ah, I see you're also the kind of masochist that prestiges everyone at once like me.
---
Wait. You don‚Äôt get yours? Wtf that‚Äôs really weird. I got my points and so did he. I thought you had the same problem. That‚Äôs so stupid man.
---
Should you cleanse againt the Plague ? 
---
She become a m1 killer and if you know how to loop it's alright.
---
However when someone cleanse she can kill us easily.
---
The way I see it is we're gonna get sick anyway, she pukes on everything so why bother giving her another power to down us.
---
damn u should design games man, why has NO ONE ever thought of these GREAT ideas before?
---
They need to add shit on the map you can throw at the killer like a lit oil lantern
---
so what you are saying is the entire map is gens pallets and hooks
---
Depends, what's the extent of the "collaboration"?
---
Me too! I have ideas
---
Definitely especially on maps with a lot of vaults its disgusting
---
OP is clearly baiting, don't even waste your energy.

I know dude, I want that buff so fricking baad. Legion is so fucking fun to play.

I‚Äôm going to bed soon so I have to put my energy somewhere. I also like replying to baits just in case someone is dumb enough to actually think that

I really liked it when I could just hit a survivor enough in sprint and they‚Äôd eventually just bleed out. I miss that
---
I cant wait for the 2021 ptb to let us try out legions upcoming changes.
---
Of course
---
*Darkness noises*
---
Literally happened to me last night. Except one of the survivors tried to wait for me to die so they could take the hatch.
---
1. Every killer would have an insta down
---
2. If he's covering his eyes then he still cannot see
---
3. Nobody wants another mettle of man
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Encountered the same thing in the new Hawkins map yestersay.  One single enclosed room with two gens one on each side.
---
Same can be said for a good portion of the survivor outfits. 
---
I've always thought the pumpkin head on the nurse looked amazing, but makes her standout a ton.
---
This community can be so wut? I'm sorry.... whol-esume?
---
I don't play Wraith often(only for dailies) but when I do I like his jump scare build. Silent bell + suppressed terror radius addons.
---
I was so excited for Legion the day they came out. I instantly bought all of their skins just because they were so damn good.
---
And then, April came with the rework....
---
BHVR mercilessly butchered them
---
I want to meet Sebastien Duval. I'm in Montreal as well. I love impersonating the clown so much. I'd love to be a voice actor on this game.
---
It only breaks it by 10% every hit, and doesn‚Äôt affect the Add-On.
---
Nobody here is saying they‚Äôre OP or brutally annoying. It‚Äôs just a joke dude.
---
It was so much more fun than dbd
---
Stop this rank abuse
---
yet you did bother to reply at all man. but good on you shows that you are 100% surv main and obviously have never been on the other side of it have fun with your ignorance

That is so cool!

Nah. Its not.

I was trying to convince a Dwight to leave last night. The demi was camping the open doors and i was injured. If Dwight has just ran the doors and took a hit, we both would‚Äôve been able to leave. But he sat there and pulled the padge and we both died to the fucked up end game timer.
---
myers needs his stalk juice
---
GF is the hardest of counter to immersed survivors. There have been way too many times a Survivor hiding accidentally stared at me and I was able to pin point their location from those CoD indicators
---
To be fair the devs have put a lot of work into improving totem spawns.  I get that you can always get a terrible one but there are also ridiculous spots they out them in too and they've gotten better at hiding some that seem like they're in the open inside closed off bushes and shit.  There's that one totem on Yahouza Map or whatever it's called by the stone walls where you literally can't even see the totem you just have to roam the thickets until you see a prompt.  
---
Hex Perks are insanely strong so unfortunately it's a high risk high reward type thing.  Just comes with the breaks.
---
And as i said in my post, its excalty like LF or Billy. You can use it in the same way, or, if you time it right, break it faster then the normal break anmation would be, but other times it would be slower and not worth doing.
---
&gt;so what you are saying is the entire map is gens pallets and hooks
---
You will always have one of these 3 covering 90% of maps, specially smaller maps.
---
It's good if you wanna troll or your good at distracting the killer while everyone does the gens
---
no it will be horrible, have you seen the gameplay video? It looks clunky as hell and with how bad RE MP games have been and the lack of support I would expect 0 good things to come from that game.
---
Good job mate. I still need the new ones and the ‚Äúuse killers power a lot of times‚Äù ones for the Huntress, Trapper and Myers
---
It takes 2 seconds if it was charged before.
---
It‚Äôs in Ireland‚Äôs App Store for free, so maybe the uk has it aswell because we‚Äôre usually grouped with the Ik when it comes to severs/games
---
Agreed not every totem spot needs to be good because if all of them was very well hidden then there would be not much of a risk to using a totem perk that is the risk in using them. Although survivors spawning on one is not needed
---
A three minute ruin sounds good. But you are right they go fast,  If ruin/devour doesnt get busted 30 seconds in, you can usually follow the killer and they lead you right to it.
---
the death mask wouldn't really work if you're putting them on while the survivor is downed but i'm 100% for the shotgun collar
---
imagine hearing that thing go off across the map
---
In my opinion OoO isn‚Äôt that great of a perk. If I were you I would just buy DS in the shrine if you really want it.
---
I'm still new to the game, but I don't get this attitude towards trying to "win". I'm a rank 16 killer so maybe its different higher up, but I just play to "win" every game (defining win as trying to sacrifice as many survivors as possible, and increase score enough to rank up). I understand sitting on a hooked survivor isn't a good strategy and not fun, I don't do that. But if I'm legitimately outplaying the survivors why should I not try to get 4k?
---
Bond wont work while in locker, be careful.
---
üòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòî
---
I think that sounds fair.  Just put the hex totem behind the exit gate.  They can cleanse it after they repair all the gens and pop that bad boy open.
---
I just finished a game and one of the survivors I was playing against got scared by it. I now wonder how many people have been scared by it.
---
Great job! Looks fantastic üëçüèª
---
We have the same pair of converse. :o Nice cosplay too.
---
I‚Äôm... not hoping for that. I was genuinely curious. In fact, it would be a cold day in Hell when I associate myself with such a petty group of people. I know you‚Äôre hoping I‚Äôm another predictable SJW so you can make some sort of snarky remark and make yourself seem smart.
---
Yeah I know, I just personally like the perk and couldn‚Äôt think of anything else to run with the build.
---
I'm sure they'll find a way like the saw games did lol
---
All indoor maps are ‚Äúkiller sided‚Äù when you don‚Äôt know how to play on them. They are actually map-wide infinites once you get a hold of them.
---
&gt; Lol your described action of pretending to leave hooks only to turn around and watch from a distance is called proxycamping and to be honest it isn't much different than just facecamping them anyways
---
You must be one of those who think "killer must go to the opposite side of the map, and a stare at a corner for 15 seconds to not be considered camping".
---
There's a ton I don't agree with, tier wise. But regardless I can appreciate the art of them, they look really nice.
---
make an addon wich makes them get stuck in the jigsaw box when they fail a really hard skill check like the Glass box thing from Saw 2 and somebody would have to get them outta there or get downed by the killer lol
---
but thats the "smaller" maps not "every" map
---
No they are talking about the real game on mobile, and it is in beta, that‚Äôs what the their talking about
---
I have seen it shorter nothing to special
---
You're wasting logic here.
---
dude same it made me wonder if they weren‚Äôt allowed make them bloody for licensing. I think they deliberately made the characters  specifically recognizable while prestiged for that reason
---
Pocket watch also slightly decreases the charge speed of the blink. I would recommend not using any add-ons (except the one where you see the landing area of the blink), because when learning nurse the important thing is to know exactly how blinks work and get used to them and I think almost every add-on somehow modifies her blinks. 
---
But I‚Äôm not an expert and you can do what feels best. I myself got much more consistent when I stopped using add-ons
---
Don't know dude, haven't heard of that word before... OP must be alien
---
WIP cosplay guys hope u like
---
Pretty neat... Until someone brings iron maiden
---
You can Pip really easily. It all just depends
---
This is why i love LF, one rev and i destroy that pallet and can proceed to hook and camp üòÅ
---
I dont want powerful perks in the game, I want all perks to be at a good viable level. Discordance is fine how it is, no need for changes. Whole point is you can see the gen longer with higher tier. It's like make your choice, the exposed effect is longer at the higher tier, but if you are a good player you would want it at tier 1 so its a 40 second cool down, then you can get more make your choices of in a game. See what I mean.
---
Mad cause rely on crutch perks
---
True, thankfully not many killers run it.
---
Nope, not assuming this. I play both equally and I understand how to balance something properly.
---
I haven't done it myself, but they said in the devstream that the Deliverance timer gets added to the Second Wind Timer.
---
So if Deliverance breaks you for 60 seconds and Second Wind breaks you for 21 seconds, if you yeeted yourself off the hook you'd be broken for 81 seconds and then heal.
---
It's disheartening to see just how many people don't know how shitty the devs were with the F13 game that goes far beyond the lawsuit, and most people just blame said lawsuit and either Miller or Cunningham for the game's faults.
---
When in reality Gun/IllFonic have got to be some of the worst smaller game companies I've seen in a while in how they treat their community, game, and pull a bunch of underhanded shit to gain a profit or shift blame away from their disaster. Even worse that people are actually still excited for that Predator game coming out
---
Wrong survivor
---
[Here's a list of them.](https://i.redd.it/1cs5vlkkrqp31.png)
---
Do note, however, that there's a mistake; Catherine only voices Laurie, not Jane. Jane's actress is unknown.
---
Okay, so I get chased for 4-5 gens. Let‚Äôs say I haven‚Äôt been able to scout any perks aside from maaaaybe Ruin. Killer is performing poorly in chase, and while I can keep ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù chase, I can‚Äôt actually shake him entirely.  And I can tell from how he‚Äôs playing that he‚Äôs gonna have NOED.
---
So instead of the survivor getting the win they, IMO, earned for running the killer that long, they‚Äôre punished by a perk that, typically, rewards killers that struggle or perform poorly. Why, exactly, in your mind, is that ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù? Typically, most killers that chase for too long end up camping, NOED or no NOED. And typically, without NOED, most killers that are run for 4-5 gens won‚Äôt get a kill, more or less a hook. So why should it reward them for failing their job? Why should they be given a compensation reward for not being able to perform well and apply pressure correctly?
---
At least when it was insta-downs at rank 3 it required people to put an investment into it. I‚Äôd still like to see a token system for it, like QuixoticGreen suggested, but being rewarded for a 4000 BP investment and failing is just unbalanced.
---
Jeff is a killer confirm.
---
Strongly disagree there is decent loop potential on this map for sure
---
In other words, entity bless the entity
---
Damn if only I could get bbq with Ghostface :(
---
Agree
---
People hating the lack of safe pallets shows how much people have gotten used to having 5+ safe pallet loops instead of LOS breakers and other plays.
---
I think for a quick fix they need to make it so she cant see scratch marks, then remove the hit box thing and prayer beads, then she might be balanced
---
People are so used to feeling invincible in this game. Sorry bud, gameplay needed to improve and make actual sense.
---
I love the hoodie! Looks spot on! Did you just paint it?
---
well lets start with perks at rank 1 spine chill or iron will are almost a must simply because so many nurses/ spirits. otherwise she can only be on 1 person at a time if she is attacking some1 you know your fine work on gens if shes not on any1 gen tap sure its slower but she will never grab you off the gen even if she gets you with the first hit just run to a pallet then bam let the looping begin then when she on you thats 3 other people grinding out those gens GGEZ
---
It can make a huge difference. Light colors stand out at a distance way more than dark colors. There‚Äôs a reason why Claudette is super popular to use, she is nicknamed Blendette when people are using specific cosmetic items. Prestige 3 Claudette is very hard to see.
---
Shotgun trap should be if you're too far away from the killer the trap activates
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought of that when I saw We're Gonna Live Forever.
---
Yep! Started with a fresh layers of white fabric paint then mixed up the right gray and went over that :p
---
Nah bro he‚Äôs a ***Unit***
---
Whenever it starts and it's her everyone goes 'ugh.' xD
---
I know some people might consider some placements controvesial, but this is all my opinion, which can of course change.
---
I discovered Obamium.
---
all of these changes i think are good.
---
Trapper to low
---
Ghostface does not like leg day.
---
I got those masks almost immediately. I wish leatherface could be reworked to be viable and not a camper killer. I loved him.
---
More like press E to get hit and exhausted at the same time and have a seizure on the ground.
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure it's Samination
---
Spirit has 1 decent perk
---
What happens in / is the point of the basement? Does the killer know when people are in there or get extra blood points?
---
If you want bloodlust gone then 110% movespeed killers shouldn't be a thing either. Oh, and you know what else would be great? If entity blockers actually fucking worked half the time.
---
Wow I dont think I've ever seen a p3 plague till this moment
---
Solid work, my friend!

if you want I made a version without the colors of tier list

It does a lot! It saved my ass a lot
---
There's actually a bug. The Endgame Timer is not accurate sometimes. I was killed when the timer displayed 20 Seconds at least. This also seems to happen to multiple players as the Nea and my friend who was playing Kate all died because of it.
---
The killer DC's as survivor that I had were all at the map start, not taking any pips, and if it is a DC by the mid or even early stage of the game,you still easily get the black pip.
---
if you still run iron will in 2019 i dont know how to help you, That only "counters" spirits that are not using the blood showing addon, ones that dont run into you, or ones who dont stand still and wait to see where you start walking then begin phasing. 
---
Gen tapping is a counter to every killer, Looping a good spirit is very hard since she is already super easy to play, and a good one knows exactly how to counter every option.
---
Nurse doesnt require a perk to counter, but spirit does. You say pallets counter her but... everyone once again is countered by pallets with very few acceptations.
---
I didn't know Luigi play's DbD.
---
He Won by doing absotutely nothing.
---
Oh no! Survivor doesn‚Äôt feel like the power role on this map! DESIGN FLAW!
---
If you want to use a stealth playstyle exclusively then prestige claudette, personally though I enjoy being able to run around as rave Jake and practise looping
---
Clown's backstory is actually a really entertaining story, easily my favorite.
---
Thank you, i was looking for "the killer was afk btw" thread to make a bad joke there.
---
I don't know why, but I have a feeling that Demogorgon was me. What was the Demo's username?
---
Fascinating to see a few upvotes now, on both the post and comments, after the initial backlash. Controversial Reddit posts can be pretty interesting.
---
If you got permanent ban, it doesn't expire
---
**Predator**: *me after pre nerf enduring, looking at the Laurie i tunneld*
---
This is why the game has turned into a boring game. As the killer, the survivors need to run away and hide not do this shit. I play as a survivor and I've never done this to a killer. Show some sportsmanship man.
---
Username definetely checks out.
---
I liked the amount of kills, but yeah, the instant death make it unfair.
---
An unsafe pallet is like the holocaust. It has no right to exist
---
Hope he does one for Doctor
---
This is bait. Its called a mechanic.
---
What did you get that ban for?
---
Whelp if I don't run the meta trash I don't win. Because I will eventually get caught, and once I'm caught I will be tunneled. This is what happens 80% of the time I'm caught.
---
all i can say is your lucky, i wanted to play a few more survivor matches tonight at rank 4 but even they had 5 min wait times and i couldn't be asked.... and survivor is the one that is always near instant
---
Not that I know of but just don't say in the chat info about the killer or about the program just in case.
---
"Alexa play the teletubbies theme"
---
You're damn right it does
---
Sick of having to because killers have their crutch perks and focus on the one thing they caught rather than going for the 4k, they settle for the 1.
---
darn, I got hacked and banned in like 4-5 games, but this is the only one with a no exception rule that basically just blocks everything as "oh, well, it must be your fault somehow". really sad actually, I wanted to get the stranger things 2 dlc and maybe introduce some friends to it.
---
Everything you said is 100% true! 
---
Yes GhostFace is miles past Myers, he is a good killer I‚Äôve used him several times and have no issues and with him being 100% stealth, he is very lethal.
---
BhVR gives the community a 100% stealth killer for us to use.
---
What does the community do with it?
---
Camp or tunnel and it‚Äôs more camping at the hook than tunneled. If I know it‚Äôs him I don‚Äôt leave the gens anymore, because 99% of DickFace killers are camped next to the hook, hiding behind something. Then if the teammate that‚Äôs hooked is running kindred it just reaffirms what I was thinking all along, CAMPED!!! 
---
With Ghostface they should just have kindred built in while playing against him. But I blame BhVR Interactive for repeatedly telling everyone that camping and tunneling is a non ban able offense and is fine to do from time to time. 
---
So the rest of the  fuckhead scrubs who play on PS4 just abuse the shit out of it!
---
Edit:spelling
---
I wish we had skins for survivors of the killers before they were killers
---
Burning a Map Offering increases the chances to go to the map by 9999 which is basically 100%. If 2 seperate offerings are burned then the chance will become 50:50. The game flipped a coin and chose Ormond. It burns both because they are increasing the chances of either map.
---
just make mettle of man activate after you get off your second hook. give the guy a fighting chance, so incase he is tunneled boom. mom kicks in.
---
Welp. I didnt know it disables from actions. Glad I asked
---
I wanna know who voices kate
---
Why are you obsessed with me? Messaging me, commenting on my posts, fuck off.
---
Right, but tunneling is pretty toxic. I have never tunneled and I do just fine getting 4k‚Äôs. There are many ways to play the game well without taking the skill and fun out of it. 
---
I also don‚Äôt want to make the game unenjoyable for others. If I were to only ever get tunneled right off the bat, I probably wouldn‚Äôt enjoy the game anymore. Why play a game I don‚Äôt enjoy? If everyone thought like that, nobody would play the game and DbD would eventually die. (Dramatic thought process, but kinda how I feel it‚Äôs gonna eventually go)
---
This Bloodhunt was a great time.  Lots of streamers and the default 2x multiplier made even the bad games into decent blood-hauls.  Hopefully we get something special for Halloween!
---
I also like this guy here
---
You lose it because you technically still burnt it even if you didn't get to use it. Its unfair imo but it does make sense.
---
You always lose whatever offering you put up unless there is a dc during loading. It technically just increases the chances of going there which is the sort of catch-all they can use so it still gets burnt/lost
---
New player here. I had a killer knock me down and grab me, and instead of hooking me, they took their time dropping me and picking me back up again over and over for about fifteen seconds. What was the point of this?
---
Also, what is the point of a killer hitting me while I'm already on the hook? Is that just them bragging that they got me?
---
Delete
---
Ghostface is definitely underrated, but he's not as sexy as Michael
---
If you‚Äôre trying to play the unsafe pallet that‚Äôs on you. Use it to stun and actually get to a good loop. Every map doesn‚Äôt have to have super safe pallets.
---
The only reason to prestige is for the bloody clothes. There isn't a guarantee that prestiging will get you 'better' perks, it'll just reset you back to square one.
---
Bet she was a blendette

---
What.
---
What happened with her original scream?
---
He just said he got hacked. What the hell is your problem?
---
Are you disagreeing with me or the tier list? lol
---
Nope, but IRC Jake was inspired by Alex. In fact, according to Alex during one of the dev streams, the Trim Beard Jake head is directly based on Alex's haircut and Alex's Toolbox is named after him.
---
Everytime they pick you up and drop you, your wiggle bar fills up a little bit. After enough times, the Survivor will automatically escape their grasp. They were trying to let you escape.
---
There is zero point to hitting a Survivor on a hook, they are just being an ass.
---
Managed to get 3 survivors and 2 killers to level 40 for their teachables. God bless the blood hunt

Oh, got it. Thanks!
---
You shouldn‚Äôt lose it according to the tips *when you burn an offering you will lose it unless it conflicts with another players offering* (I paraphrased of course I don‚Äôt have that good of memory)
---
When you‚Äôre hooked and the killer is camping you and the whole team trying to unhook you
---
How dare you come on to this public platform and just assume you‚Äôre allowed to express your opinion. Shame on you
---
We likely will; we didn‚Äôt get a proper anniversary or summer event this year because the devs were working on Dedicated Servers, Stranger Things, Party Management and Archives.
---
Sure. That's exactly how it was. OP is clearly innocent.
---
Because it‚Äôs a dick thing to do?? I think most everyone on this post agrees lmfao ,,
---
Honesty should've just stopped at prestige 1. The bloody shirt is the only good one imo.
---
I've noticed with the new matchmaking I keep getting matched with a bunch of rank 7 and 8s who just urban evade around the map. I an rank 16 btw.
---
Noob reference    I love it
---
..I don't think that's how the joke works
---
No, this is just a clip of a bad killer. Don't change directions in a loop, BREAK THE FUCKIN PALLET, and give up and look for someone else when you're getting outplayed for too long.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôve been playing this game for well over a year now.
---
I mean it's not a toxic perk anymore, in fact quite the opposite. Only works on tunnelers and in that case they deserved it.
---
Wha-
---
Well you‚Äôre not supposed to survive every time, even when you play your hardest, get better and play more and you‚Äôll be fine
---
It makes sense in my confused mind
---
I just realised why are some Killers' moris in first person and some in third person
---
There's a second map that's okay for killers? Better complain on Reddit.
---
Man, console has it rough. I bet anything that Ghostface was having issues with framerate + low sensitivity and auto-aim.
---
It was the same on ps4. Glad it‚Äôs over too.
---
I agree it's bull crap. I guess they figure the killer will just sit there and watch you die so it ends it but what if you have deliverance and decisive strike you might be able to get away.
---
I sure hope not. Just don‚Äôt be a dick or cheat and your good lol ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Anyone know how F13 is now days? I got a key for it when I got DBD in a Halloween humble bundle in like 2017 never installed it is it worth even redeeming at this point?
---
Nice! Took me organizing it with people from here to get it done lol
---
Yes actually, the goal is to survive every time :P
---
You should have gotten your points if the killer disconnected. I would report it to behavior. It was an issue on ps4 but I haven‚Äôt encountered it in a while.
---
Exactly! While adding perks like that, don't you think as game designers they would think about that?
---
There's not enough plague mains :(
---
I could probably fit all of the plague mains, myself included, in a small Denny's.
---
I like it. Thanks OP. Every killer should have their own unique stalking/chase music. Two down, but 15 to go.
---
Those I knew, but I remember being told that Alex voiced the doctor too. I was told false information!
---
No, but the point is to beat those odds which are clearly stacked against me and if I can't do that consistently without running the same fucking perks then that's just what it is. I don't get paid BP to die, I get paid to survive. Anything short of that and there's no reason not to DC and head to the next match. I'm in this for the BP, nothing else.
---
At this point they should just add a twerk mechanic when you get a gate open, I wouldn't even be mad
---
It's more fun than dying instantly when you've never been hooked before....
---
Currently I have done that I just wish I didn't have to run DS too.
---
Yeah I'm red ranks and tunneling hasn't been as much an issue so I sometimes bench D strike.  I've been mixing it up lately but my current loadout that I'm loving is Adrenaline, Quick and Quiet, Head On and Small Game.  Doing work in my games currently with this build.
---
Imagine how fun that'd be tho!
---
Trapper just be like "So Claudette what do you do in ur spare time".
---
Claudette goes "oh I just focus on my school work and sometimes hang out with my friends and I NEED A PALLET"
---
I see that fucker
---
Rin is just having an eternal mental breakdown. You can see it in the expressions on her face.
---
If all you care about is BP then play killer. I don‚Äôt know what else to say, you‚Äôre pissed off because you die as a survivor and don‚Äôt get as much points, just play another game dude, i you‚Äôre bored switch to killer.
---
Me cago en dios es un orgullo ver aqui al risitas
---

---
A wraith stood on hatch instead of closing it to bait me :(
---
If you run balanced you can do plenty of loops on hawkings.
---
If you don't - Welp, looks like your running pallet to pallet and using them all.
---
Shadowborn absolute meta ngl
---
So instead of dying instantly you want to waste everyone‚Äôs time as the killer instantly downs you and then waits 60 seconds for your DS to run out. Again, sounds fun!
---
I would assume Pennywise would have a fear mechanic and which he has to induce fear into you to use his abilities like Freddy and his dream world.
---
If I'm not mistaken its 30 seconds without add-ons. I could be wrong.
---
This is why Kindred is an s-tier solo perk btw.
---
Yeah before fixated came out I tried a variety of perks but I really enjoy hide and go mind-game. Just sucks cause I can mind-game really well if I can break LOS but if they have eyes on me I can't loop well enough to escape 99% of the time.
---
I‚Äôd be fine with the unsafe pallets on the map if there were actual safe pallets. I think badham preschool has much better pallet generation. There‚Äôs a lot of unsafe pallets in badham but there‚Äôs also plenty of safe ones.
---
[This video has most of the data on ghost roast‚Äôs power and addons](https://youtu.be/DkDyYBg5oYw)
---
it's not even flashlights I was talking about, just triggering all her traps when she's occupied with someone really resets her map pressure, it's as simple as once she picks someone up, trigger all her traps and she can't do much, like I said I know she's strong but her power has a lot of strong counter play to it, that if it isn't used she's a monster, but if it is, she struggles to keep any pressure up for long stretches of time.
---
I know Clown is trash, but he still does have anti-loop potential, something you can't say about the bottom half of killers aside from Trapper, I would say Doctor too but his anti-loop only works like 10% of the time. He makes dead zones, unsafe pallets, and window loops nearly impossible to not get hit in, just that he is susceptible to genrush and the overall meta of the game right now I agree.
---
What? I never said a weak power, I just said a different power. Aesthetically I like her but I dislike her gameplay.
---
Stop jumping down peoples throats for no reason, That would be cool right?
---
Yeah you make an audible sound even when slow vaulting they prob have really good headphones man not everyone that does some shit like that is hacking
---
I think that's the only one that's a safe pallet. All the other ones are really bad
---
Point made. Saucy business blinding killers, god I love it
---
His spotting mechanic needs to be fixed but he‚Äôs in no way a bad killer.
---
I think spring trap could work well with a purple guy skin
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dbhiph/i_hope_babyface_and_tree_become_dlc/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
People usually don't run ruin with corrupt intervention for this reason. Thanatophobia + Dying Light on certain killers can be good too.
---
Totems are too inconsistent with being either right next to a damn gen or tucked in a corner on the top floor of a building nobody ever goes in.
---
On top of that, you can‚Äôt claim NOED does nothing until end game, because if survivors have to cleanse totems just off the *chance* the killer has it then it‚Äôs making the survivors waste at least 70 seconds(divided between the survivors, hopefully) cleansing them, and that‚Äôs assuming they find all the totems immediately. Alternatively, and what I found happened a lot when cleansing totems, the team would get 4 of the totems... and so NOED definitely spawns in the one spot that nobody can find.
---
NOED solves a problem, but it does so in a way that detracts from the survivor experience. I could see it being more ‚Äúfair‚Äù if it only exposed people who had been hooked/had unhooked, something to the effect of ‚Äúit should require the killer to have accomplished something in the match prior to all 5 gens being completed‚Äù.
---
Also, and this is just a personal complaint, it maybe shouldn‚Äôt activate after closing the hatch when 3 survivors have been killed. That just feels like a big ole fuck you to the last guy alive, who‚Äôs already pretty screwed. Though, maybe the quicker death is more merciful.
---
Yep. I want to waste the killers time, and I want my points. You could also potentially be running unbreakable and dead hard as well. Or breakdown and boil over, flip flop.
---
Point is if you havent been hooked you deserve your chance like everyone else.
---
This guy's stood in a room and did cannibals signature: "HUE HUE HEU HUEE"
---
Whispers for sure on Pig.  Make sure it's Whispers III bc the others cast too wide a net.  Run around normally when Whispers is off, crouch immediately when it turns on.
---
Ruin/Whispers/Surveillance is fine fine (I like Discordance over Surveillance, but Surveillance is fine for tracking).  You can play around with the fourth depending on how you want to play.  I'd probably run BBQ to stack bloodpoints unless you already have everything unlocked.  Nurse's, STBFL, Enduring, Spirit Fury all could work well.
---
sweet sweet justice
---
Nah I'll stick to the side that the decent folk play and just keep at it. I'm not nearly a big enough piece of shit to main killer.
---
This is so true, whenever i play as killer it seems like there is a survivor on every generator shift shaping into trees or tall grass only to be heckled from the shadows   
---
\~ \~"Traash killer"\~ \~  Flash light clicks in the distance and shit.... 
---
But when you play as a survivor, you got Dwight constantly breaking your generator, while you have a Meg running by you with the killer constantly causing you to be consistently focused and hit. Makes you think your team is drooling on their controllers / keyboards.
---
Later on I find out I just suck at the game.
---
Where is ghOLY SHIT
---
"pick up anything around you to stab the killer"
---
\*Finds a giant dagger\*
---
Is there an online depository for OFFICAL Dead By Daylight art/skins/maps/character designs? The  Behaviour Interactive site isn't really providing me with what I need and I'm trying to compile as much official artwork as I can for an upcoming broadcast.
---
Then bait them to the pallet. Is this serious? The killer has to go to you to hit you. So draw him to it, stun him, run away. I'm just saying I have yet to die on that map.
---
&gt; Aesthetically I like her but I dislike her gameplay
---
Right, cause that doesn't mean you want her to be weaker at all. Use all the different phrases you'd like, but we both knew what you meant. You want her with something different and weaker. No "jumping down people's throats" at all, just reading between the lines.
---
The Spirit is perfectly fine as she is, as strong as she is.
---
Then dont? Maybe rely on BT and run a non meta  perk like sprint burst with it
---
What platform are you on? I think I know that Doctor. :D
---
Me and my husband played killer when we could this week to help lighten the mood on the Blood Hunt.
---
Thank you I‚Äôll be trying
---
Ahhh man that's your issue then.  Just practice your looping and it breaks your loadout wide open and gives you a lot of breathing room to have fun and experiment.  Truetalent started getting into looping after being a killer main primarily like 6 months ago.  He posts like 10 new vids to YouTube daily and half of those are him just looping killers.  He takes time midgame to explain exactly how to run different types of tiles.  Could help out.  The game is infinitely more fun once you know you're in solid shape to run a killer for a few gens.
---
Practice with your preferred perks. I always run iron will, lightweight, bond, and prove thyself,  and I dont have huge differences in games. You're probably just more comfortable running the meta stuff.
---
Ok so you just wanna waste time. Got it.
---
That micheal is fabulous
---
We 3 genned ourselves on this map once. It was terrible lol
---
Cancer attacks cancer, what a world.
---
I won't agree with everything, but I do truly appreciate your effort. For that reason, I'll upvote.
---
Can it even be done on keyboard? Cause I'm hyper-shit on controller. Jukes I mean, not loops.
---
That‚Äôs why I made the switch to Corrupt Intervention, works better than Ruin for me and it gives you an idea of where the survivors might be.
---
Are you new mate? Killers are just doing their job. As a killer main I want more people to play survivor so I have more targets, as a survivor you want more killers to que up games. It‚Äôs a circle dude, if you‚Äôre having trouble with bp and Don‚Äôt want to kill them join games and farm, just never go for the final hook or run around and goof with survivors, most survivors will let you farm a decent amount of points if you play friendly.
---
I could but I don‚Äôt wanna be that kind of person
---
Yeah, no even if you post it in the subreddit 4 times
---
Can you not
---
No I run Spine Chill, Iron Will, Calm Spirit, and Fixated when I can but if I don't at least put on DS then if I ever do get caught I'm done for. 4 out of 5 times I get caught I'm either going to die on first hook or tunneled out regardless. The answer is apparently to get better at jukes and loops but I suppose that'll come in time.
---
Get tf out of here no one cares about your stream no matter how much you spam it
---
Well played üòÇ
---
bbq chili is 10000x easier to get than 4 stacks of WGLF. easily. and just more consistent bp. If I all red emblem killer I get 100-130k. As a survivor with wglf its like 60-80k.
---
Magic by daylight
---
Three hooks wasn't enough? Now you want four?
---
Me to, hopefully they don‚Äôt ditch that because of the bs dedicated server problem that we won‚Äôt see till next year at the rate they are going! This time last year we were already finding spooky flashlights and lunch boxes, but nothing yet....
---
8 times dude. Get outta here. No one wants to watch it.
---
Omg man you broke his soul
---
I think your best bet would be making your own. Ghostface‚Äôs costume is pretty complex. I‚Äôm currently working out how everything works for a cosplay eventually. You‚Äôd be surprised how many parts the overall cowl is made up of, and I‚Äôve only recently figured out somewhat how it works after months of plotting.
---
I run no mither every game on ace lol
---
That excuse is the same excuse I've heard come from the mouth of every hacker that's been busted and doesn't want to admit it
---
I do that with a Legion Susie. I just wouldn't want to sit in killer queue for 15 minutes a pop because they refuse to fix survivor BP. What really needs to happen is that they need to fix BP payout so killers don't have the vast upperhand regardless of effort put in. One of your main perks not only gives you BP for doing the main part of your job but also shows you an aura of where to go. Unhooks are one tiny part of what survivors gotta do and even then it has to be shared amongst 4 people who usually use it to farm.
---
There's a gross imbalance between survivor and killer BP right now and it's causing your queues to choke and us to constantly DC.
---
I got one too as scoops ahoy Steve by a hag
---
Why did you post it 11 times
---
LOL SORRY I LAGGED OUT
---
I love seeing people with genuine skill without being a cocky asshole about it.

Might not have seen it pop up in new and thought it failed to post
---
Usually Serbian last names end with iƒá. There are ofc Croatians whose last names end like that too but they're mostly Serbs that were forcefully converted to Catholicism and thus now count as Croats
---
This is trapper‚Äôs T3
---
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna live forever‚Äù gives you more points for hook rescues, use that perk then *do your job*
---
[**Source**](http://leatherface.beststuffshop.website)
---
But that wastes survivors time and a good Hag can still punish survivors who trigger her traps by slugging or by running perks like Knock Out or Agitation, so you don't know when she picks someone up or how fast she can hook that person, unless you are in a SWF team. She indeed has counter play, but that doesn't make her weaker than Billy, not when Billy can be looped for a pretty long time on many, many maps.
---
Yeah but if you make Bloodlust 3 chase then break it even once and do it back to bloodlust 3 game is almost over by then vs 80% of killers.
---
hahaha
---
How do I not suck?  I follow some basic tips and tricks, fundamentals.  All survivors evade me easily.  All killers get me save for really terrible ones so I also can't be an effective survivor like what I see.
---
Removed we ask you to be apart of the community before advertising your twitch thank you
---
I misunderstood your comment, I thought you were saying bamboozle and self care are top tier, but instead you‚Äôre actually saying, this tier list is garbage because they have bamboozle and self care as top tier.
---
I'm blind I don't see him .-.
---
What is this clip from?
---
It happens. You cant win em all. But if you're having fun, I like to think of it as a win. Sometimes I'll get tunneled out, but if I can last long enough that my team can get most of the gens done, I played my part in the end. Plus dying on Hook first isnt always a killer issue. Your team could be potato and not save you or just squat instead of doing gen. It's why I run kindred a lot too.
---
If he needed a rework, I'd get it.
---
Thing is, he doesn't.
---
All he really *needs* is number tweaks. 
---
* Up the duration of his cloud.
---
* Up his slow potency
---
* Up his slow duration
---
* Give him another bottle at base
---
* Lower his base reload time
---
* Make him move faster while reloading
---
His base systems could use looking at, sure, but it isn't *super* necessary.
---
* Let him attack immediately after cancelling a reload.
---
* Upgrade his direct hit flinch to make it work more like Doctor.
---
* Auto-reload a bottle every so often.
---
* Have his gas cover areas evenly, instead of spouting several "streams of gas" (throw a bottle at something really high up, like a tree, and you'll see what I mean).
---
* Make him force medium vaults at pallets too.
---
* Add a % vault slow.
---
Are you saying you don't hear the sound when you climb through?
---
You cannot bait the killer into the corner pallets, they just wont run there since it's a longer route with a pallet in it.. and if you try to bait a lunge it's basically 50/50 on giving them a free hit.
---
Whispers is uncounterable while Bamboozle shuts down Jungle Gyms and Killer Shack loop? 
---
Bamboozle has other uses than "baby killer can't mind game at loop"
---
And I'm assuming all of them are employees of BHVR?
---
No, like you weren't hooked at all the entire match, but when it gets you to be the last survivor, you should be able to go through the process like everyone else.
---
I've played against Monochrome Shroud GF fairly often and it doesn't make a ton of difference unless you're on Crotus Penn
---
This posted like 6 times
---
Is there a benefit to flashlighting the killer at window vaults and pallet breaks? I feel like the advantage you get from the blind isn't as good as just immediately getting a head start (if at a pallet) or setting up a mindgame (if at a window).
---
Will there be a halloween event this year?
---
Eh, with bbq and 100% offering i can easily get 180k bloodpoints in one game as killer, while as surv i get 50k-80k
---
I did something similar with a few characters.  It‚Äôs really a waste to prestige anyone at this point unless you really want their bloody face.  I don‚Äôt even use bloody items because of all the new cosmetics.
---
I‚Äôve P3‚Äôd my favorites and the rest will stay at p0 50 forever.  There are just too many perks to unlock on too many characters at this point.  I‚Äôd really like to see them address bloodpoints.  We either need another general BP buff or we need more frequent events.  
---
On a side note...I knew I was going to grind my lvl 50 ghost face this event because I had 25 100/103% offerings.  I decided to invest some BP to get my BBQ above tier 1...1,200,000 bloodpoints later and it‚Äôs still tier 1.
---
Kindred is just a 5th perk for everyone to have bond for 2 minutes while you die :P. Least that's my experience. I really am fighting getting a SWF group together because I feel like that kills the main point of the game, but it's pointing at the solution the longer I play.
---
If your friends think that GF is superior to MM, they haven't played Myers. Myers is more superior because you can't stop him from stalking and when he hits tier 3 you can 1 shot everyone and if you miss your power won't deplete in order to wait a minute to stalk again.
---
Bleg
---
Imma have to say Ghostface just bc his stealth is so good. But that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
Your not reading between any lines, you're ignorant.
---
Spirit is not fun to play when you have poor hearing, forgive me for wishing she had a different power so I could play her I guess?
---
I'm not disputing power because that's nothing to do with my comment like I said - You are trying very hard to debate something with me that I have no intention of discussing. It's stupid asf.
---
Also, Bubba can at least punish survivors mistakes, altruism and be really deadly in the basement, while Clown literally has nothing, no map pressure, no punish, no stall, no stealth, just a very lackluster chase power. Don't get me wrong, Bubba is still trash, every killer from Doctor and below is really bad, especially without add-ons, but I feel like Bubba can do more than Clown.
---
There typically is, and there have been some leaks about it already. So probably yes.
---
You're right man. Literally nothing survivors can do on this map. Guess its just an automatic 4k for every killer every time.
---
Typically it isn't worth it, no.
---
I sucked at the beginning. It just takes practice. This is the type of game where practice and time-played really affects your gameplay. For me, my trick is to think like the other group. For example, I tried survivor right off the bat. Kept dying, because I didn‚Äôt understand how killers worked exactly. So I played some killer matches, learned what a killer sees, and how I need to respond to survivors, so then I went back to play as a survivor, and was pretty good because I knew what the killer was thinking and seeing now, and because of my experience as a killer, knew how they‚Äôd respond. Then did the same thing for survivor to killer.
---
my steam account got hacked and I got banned on 3-4 games, but they all had customer support that helped me out, EAC does not
---
IMO Michael is much better for a number of reasons. He's perfect for stalking survivors, has his own (Halloween themed) music and map and is balanced quite well.
---
He was added to the game early on, so he doesn't suffer from the nerf/buff bullshit that most newer killers have since release.
---
Ghostface Halloween Mask killer is basically Michael Myers light. But easier to use.
---
Filip's vocal range is truly phenomenal lol, he can go from a deep voiced man to a literal elephant
---
It's 30 seconds, but it should the same as The Spirit's phrase cooldown - 20 seconds. In fact the Spirit's phasing is even deadlier than Night Shroud, so it's ridiculous that Night Shroud is 10 seconds more. Both should be 20 seconds. Every second as killer is precious.
---
Talk about clutch lmao
---
Thank you!
---
I got my Ghostface to P3 50. And nothing else. I didn't get Pop like I should've been doing.
---
Honestly the best way to get better at the game is just by playing it. Experience/Practice will help you more than just about anything else.
---
why the hell would I risk an account with nearly 7 legacy skins, chuckles mask, street wise meg, science fair claud, and so much more? If I would hack I would buy another accout and do it there
---
‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm new, can you teach me how to play?
---
Ever ran in circles and hold one button down while occasionally pressing another? That‚Äôs all you do‚Äù
---
Damn that‚Äôs good
---
Nice strawman.
---
We are discussing unsafe pallets, there are plenty of loops if you have balanced landing.
---
Totally
---
I had 7 legacy skins and nearly every single exclusive (chuckles mask and the like). If I were to hack it would be ANYWHERE but on this account
---
It's muscle memory
---
Freddy and Jeff are voiced by the same guy and now I can't unhear how similar they sound.
---
Why I stick with bond usually,  but i like to mix it up. My point is you shouldn't feel restricted.  There are other ways to get away from a tunnel , or just not end up in that situation to start by using other perks. I used to pull the old lightweight iron will and urban fake out by acting like I ran through/left scratch marks then urban up against a wall to throw the killers focus off. You should explore the other perks more because there are people out there running others and doing fine.
---
Knitting needle. Sewing needles are incredibly small.
---
&gt; forgive me for wishing she had a different power so I could play her I guess?
---
You're forgiven then. Glad we both agree that she is fine as is.
---
Semantics
---
i've heard of people rebuying the game just to get banned again, is this still something that happens? I'd hate to lose everything I had, but if its an only option maybe later down the line I'd conseder it
---
Feng has so many noises between falling and getting hit it must‚Äôve sounded like porn when they were recording her sounds
---
kinda looks like a guard from far cry 3 lol
---
It says I have no history even though I played Dbd the ehole day.
---
Agreed on both points, but you have to admit there‚Äôs a power imbalance when it comes a swf team vs killer. It‚Äôs mainly how do you balance around survivors who actively communicate vs survivors who can‚Äôt communicate at all?
---
Thus guy got downvoted for asking a question, good job Reddit :D
---
alright, most people followed those two instructions. oh wait, do you remeber when people were dropping glitched flashlights to get other people banned? (this isnt what happened to me, I was hacked. but saying it's always the users fault isnt true.)
---
edit: or when they made useing a legion addon a bannable offence? imgaine playing legion then just being banned without even knowing what you did
---
"I can not see any god.
---
Other than me"
---
The timer will ring a bell twice, then you have around 20 seconds to leave. I always base it off of that
---
30 seconds without add-ons, 16 seconds with the green and yellow recovery add-ons
---
I've tried multiple times to reach out to EAC because my account was hacked. I told them to check the ip's, playing location, if I was playing with anyone I reccently added, ect ect. it's hard to try to prove your innocence when the ONLY thing you get is "bans are not appealable. get fucked on kid."
---
I wouldn't agree about perfectly fine, she is a little too strong. I'd say freddy is as close as you can get to perfectly fine.
---
Yeah I always make sure I go across the map when I finish a gen
---
Fuuuuck. I was hoping it was like OW and they‚Äôd take it down on the first of October. Feelsbadman. :(
---
What stops you from doing it now? Buy an account and buy DLC.
---
The last day of bloodhunt I grinded 7 levels or more and my friend joined and started readying up and unreadying and it crashed my game and I lost all the progress I made that day..feels bad man
---
Can you fucking read, you illiterate? The guy got hacked.
---
Ah ok.
---
Hmmm. I don't know - it would just lead to camping and slugging of the kobe-er. The killer will slug you, then go close the hatch not wishing to risk a DS. You'd end up waiting out the timer and dying to the entity more often than not. I guess the question to ask yourself is if changing the mechanic worth this type of scenario happening to you more often than a kobe/dash for the hatch escape?
---
If you asked me a few months ago I would‚Äôve agreed, but the more people improve with him and use him in different ways the better GF seems.
---
Without going in to detail I‚Äôd say Myers has a much better snowball potential while being easier to avoid/loop (assuming he‚Äôs a regular Myers), while GF gets more consistent returns and a wider utility at the cost of a lot of momentum. He can sort of accomplish the same thing by stalking multiple survivors at once, but a GF is more likely to expose before chasing, as not to be broken out of shroud before marking the surv. The process of stalking-&gt;exposing-&gt;chasing requires more time, is more methodical, and is incredibly versatile, at the cost of the 99%-&gt;stalk when a hit is guaranteed that Michael can do, which works better against large clumps of survivors.
---
Overall their powers are both pretty distinct from each other. Comparing them so closely feels like trying to compare hag and trapper, as if they‚Äôre identical because they both use some sort of trap.
---
Honestly would it be broken if you could see a shimmer of spirit like Wraith has? As it stands her mindgame potential is just ‚Äúguess if she‚Äôs using her power‚Äù and it kinda sucks.
---
Yeah, when queue times are bad I play mario golf on my DS between games so I don‚Äôt lose my mind while waiting.
---
Yeah I thought of that somewhat but didn't really know how to I think that the locking of percentage would help a little but other than reducing time or number of gens I dont really see how and that will make high rank go faster too
---
There‚Äôs no way they can link the new account and the banned account. So no, you‚Äôre good.
---
Jojo and dbd? I like the crossover
---
Not a strawman just done with this conversation.
---
It just requires practice
---
Found a dude that got tired of F13 lol
---
Doing gens,you?
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to her because she can‚Äôt see you at all except for scratch marks and blood
---
thank you :)
---
3
---
Actual meta is haddonfield offering balanced landing and then everything else, but close enough.
---
Nice job! Similar to my experience getting it with randoms I ended up friending. It took us a few tried because we couldnt find the hatch on occasion or 1 person would get killed.
---
When it come to actually playing him seriously, I'll redirect you to those 2 videos, the first one is a short introduction while the other one is an in depth guide on how to play him, both by the same guy on top of that.
---
Quick presentation:https://youtu.be/sh3hZL93FTM
---
Guide:https://youtu.be/FI5L1Pvfs3Y
---
Bubba because you can‚Äôt get him with shards *and* his 3 perks are pretty good. You don‚Äôt know the power of BBQ &amp; Chili until you have it. Legion‚Äôs pretty bad but has decent perks, Clown is alright and also has decent perks, and Demo has terrible perks but can be somewhat enjoyable. It you‚Äôre looking for fun, go with Clown or Demo. Perks, Bubba or Legion.
---
You know what else isn‚Äôt fair? Having to guess if she‚Äôs vaulting a window or just mindgaming because the devs decided she just stands still for that
---
Hatch grab wouldn't have made a difference here, since you couldn't grab downed survivors
---
That would be a lot of extra work and or information to learn as long as they were similar in design then maybe
---
Yeah true but I see what he means, she was staring at him before he even vaulted.
---
Videos available publicly along with lots of streamers online prove otherwise ü§ó
---
My expectations were subverted
---
Yeah that‚Äôs also confusing
---
Quite literally is a strawman, If you're done why bother commenting in the first place?
---
You're literally giving me notifications for a conversation you don't wish to have anymore...??
---
Oh yummy. Wonderful use of the sketchy feeling of the pen for the media; makes me imagine this could've been a shaky sketch of this terrifying new monster from a horrified survivor (potentially by Vigo?). Love it!
---
I **hate** when this happens.
---
great chase. btw at the end, if you can tell the killer is just trying to bloodlust you, by just going back and forth and not actually looping, try walking as much as possible. If chase ends he loses bloodlust *very* quickly
---
Nope. The bloodpoint offerings and perks are only based off the amount of blood points you earned at base at the end of the match.
---
Freddy is pretty damn amazing. I've been playing him a lot more recently and he's like justtttt below the Spirit now. I'm thinking he's either on par with Billy, or slightly better or slightly worse than him. They really knocked it out of the park with his rework. God I hope they do as good of a job when they give Legion his new power in the coming months. And then starting next year if they can get on a roll with other non-viable killers and do as good of a job with them as they did with Freddy - this game would be in so much better of a shape.
---
But as for my bae The Spirit - I don't want a string of her precious little hair touched. Every killer should be like her or near her level.
---
It sucks cause spirit is fun to play but going against her is just hell
---
NO ONE TELL HIM
---
Same. I was only one using 100% bloodpoint offerings. And killers were def camping a lot.
---
I seriously don't understand the need to FARM especially when you have bloodhunt... But seriously, not everyone finds it enjoyable to sit in the same lobby with 4 other people and max out points... Stop blaming people for not wanting to join in on the "fun" of farming.
---
That would make a more if your found first then you die while most of your team escapes kind of similar to what we have now but this just sounds sped up
---
Thank you very much! I‚Äôm still piecing together the story. Vigo is the guy who explores the mist right?
---
Maybe if her husk had a shimmering effect when she‚Äôs vaulting or phase waking
---
Ignoring the poor choice of words for the title as that was just a quote from post game when i pointed out the sketch from the match, my point was that she was constantly showing demonstrations of knowledge she shouldnt of had E.G staring at me through walls
---
You‚Äôre wrong, it requires learning how the survivor/killer plays to know how to react.  Then with that knowledge you make a move based on knowledge of how to play unsafe pallets.  This requires skill.
---
I mean I'm a console player so I only play controller but all the streamers I watched that taught me how to loop are PC so you can loop, juke etc... with mouse and keyboard.
---
I'm pissed I can't watch this on loop
---
This is probably the only map where I would consider Deja Vu or detective's hunch useful perks.
---
My only explanation I can think of is that she caught a glimpse of you before you hid behind the wall.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dbhx3v/whats_the_player_level_cap/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Could you explain a bit more about Technician. It what situations do you use it?
---
Yeah the time to complete a gen with no influences and 1 survivor is 80 seconds which means good survivors can get gens done in 60 or so seconds even then the killer would need to use it on the gen which might cause it to pop in the tine it takes him to get to it
---
What are the lions supposed to represent?
---
I just moved into my uni halls and the internet doesn‚Äôt work. The IT of my uni also don‚Äôt have anything to do with the network so...
---
she's babylonian, I wanted a connection to that
---
Wooden spoon counters the negative of the pocket watch! Thanks for the talks bro! Hope u got many a bloodpoint during the event! I just wished it lasted longer lol
---
Am I glad Stefan voices by guy
---
That sucks cause it would make survivors more active and kind of kill the stealth vibe as a survivor can just sit on a gen for 80 seconds and get it done
---
I want to hear him make the elephant noise when Wraith gets stunned
---
That's literally not true.
---
Ya know i sucked at the beginning and i still suck, but ya really wanna know how to get better. Its three words killers hate....survive. with. Friends! xD
---
To be fair. They can see you getting hooked before you can see them on the hook. So I often like to believe my failure to escape has caused their disorganization. It's a thin hope but better than none at all.
---
Sometimes on hook I‚Äôll think there‚Äôs an injured, female survivor walking up for the unhook just to realize it‚Äôs Scoop boy‚Äôs groans of pain
---
I recently started playing killer and played mostly killer during the event. My queue times were at most 3 or 4 minutes. I started rank 17 and ended up 7. Is 3-4 mins generally considered long? The amount of blood points I got from killer easily justified the 3-4 minute wait vs instant queue for survivor. Most survivor games I played, at rank 8 were complete trash this weekend.
---
Those pig memes are starting to feel like a circlejerk
---
You think stealth still exist with all the aura reading and notification bubble perks?
---
I would really hate to lose nearly 7 diffrence legacy skins, and as well pax exclusives from when the game still had its first bloodweb, in addetion to all the dlc I already bought. It just feels like a slap to the face to support the game since the start, be hacked and banned, and have literally no customer support whatsoever to try and help. and I thought runescape's customer support was a meme
---
You care about your account so much, that it took you only two years to create Reddit account and six months more to ask about the chance of getting it back. Believable.
---
Sorry that was a bad wording more so the sit in a corner whole one person runs the killer around and let's people know what he's doing
---
That men is a legend
---
Because I really enjoy playing killer. Survivor? Not so much.
---
Yeah, but GF can be in his power until he attacks or is revealed, which is usually a much longer duration than the phase walk (even with add-ons).
---
By Japanese law and the Ju-On franchise, Rin is to become a sad soul/bitch we feel remorse/resentment for.
---
Unfortunate they really aren‚Äôt extending it considering getting kicked out of lobbies so many times and que timers being so bad.
---
I don‚Äôt know why the devs can‚Äôt have these atleast a week instead of just 3-4 days. 1 week gives atleast more players a bit of time to have a chance.
---
alright thanks. maybe once the saltyness of losing pax exclusives and legacy skins wears off I might get it again. I'm just pissed at how much of a fucking joke their support is.
---
I went against what would be a great matchup if I wasn‚Äôt there (my rank 12 and then 16 and 27 for the else. Good game on my end, but I learned at the exit gate tbagging, that your aim has to be on point to work
---
What teachables do you have unlocked?
---
I remember during my noob games of DBD I remember a game against a wraith with tier 3 ruin and BBQ with franklins and tinkerer with the bone clapper I messaged him ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and he only said back ‚Äúlol salty much?‚Äù
---
Was the opposite for me... I think in all the matches I had this weekend, I only had two games were a single survivor brought in Bloody Party Streamers and meanwhile I was trying to use up my 50 celebration cakes on Myers. :(
---
The 360 is something you do when you're caught between tiles, in the hope that the brief period of confusion will allow you to reach *any* tile and continue your loop.
---
If you're not great at running tiles then the 360 is unlikely to help you, because in that situation you're going to take the hits at the tiles rather than between them.
---
It is a useful skill, but bear in mind that killers are heavily incentivised to punish survivors according to their threat level - if you're consistently pulling off the 360 then you can expect the basement or facecamping. Master the skill, but be wary of the consequences.
---
Way too relatable
---
Trapper mains unite!
---
Not true? It‚Äôs happened countless times to me. I‚Äôll give an example based on a true story.
---
Lets say I hook survivor A and begin to walk away. Survivor B unhooks survivor A, and Survivor A‚Äôs DS timer starts. I down and hook survivor B extremely quickly, and survivor A is self caring in a corner besides the hook. I down survivor A and pick them up, and get DS‚Äôd.
---
In this situation, did I tunnel them? No. I got punished for their own mistake.
---
Some don‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs good. I just think on end, 3 out of 4 camp with him
---
Explain the stranger things leak then they are doing this to promote/hype up the next chapter
---
yeah it is a super fun clip, I agree! I was just wondering if I was going crazy seeing this posted before or not haha
---
Hahah, I enjoy playing ghostface more dw.
---
But he's not as sexy
---
If you are at a decent rank just keep sucking until your low enough rank to do it lol. Also pro tip- use the game map offering
---
I think jeff might be even harder to lift than david
---
This and the increased probability they don't just all go somebody else will save them. That or I don't know them, too risky.
---
Current designs aren't very good either.
---
Have any of the devs commented on these being used in game?
---
u/titletoimagebot
---
Very good comeback. I like it.
---
Ok keep it to ya self
---
Clown. Better perks, better power, a million times more sexually appealing (no homo, though)... the list goes on.
---
You get points. 500 a blind. 
---
If you get good at it, you can slide behind them while they‚Äôre still blind and mice that way. A blinded killer typically moves forwards to hot so you blind, snuggle to their side, and go the way they came.
---
Just know Myers is overrated
---
Agreed. Every other map on the game should be re-worked to have as many plenty of unsafe pallets as Demo's map.
---
The only safe pallet on every map IMO should be the killer's shack and maybe another one or two more per map. 2-3 safe pallets ones max per map.
---
Real talk: whens kizuna ai joining as a survivor?
---
Its literally a 60 second perk at max rank. Don't pick them up for like 10 seconds and you're fine. The perk is far from unfair.
---
Sprint burst and resilience work well on blendette.  I like to use distortion, urban evasion, resilience and Sprint burst for full Claudette immersion.
---
Oh man I really like this one. What made you decide to incorporate lions in this?
---
https://youtu.be/FQRW0RM4V0k
---
What makes me a good demogorgon?
---
Whatever, she was annoying.
---
She doesn't need a rework tho 
---
Last patch was a bug fix but yeah she could use some qol changes but pig mains are becoming the annoying overly vocal group like the "better nerf Irelia" in league of legends, clown, wraith, Bubba and trapper need way more attention than the pig stuff.
---
Wtf is her terror radius, was she running monitor? She was on you in 5 seconds and the heartbeat didnt come sooner
---
Making doc a stealth killer is stupid and gimmicky no offense
---
They actually didn‚Äôt, he confirmed this on stream
---
Maps arent conflicting, its increasing the chances of those maps to be chosen and then choosing it after the increase has been applied. Conflicting ones are the shrouds that separate or join survivors
---
I would get downvoted to oblivion if I told you what the Trapper would really say to the Claudette. Spoiler alert: It's not as much fun as you think.
---
I still don't have it all together myself yet, but I believe he was before Benedict Baker, I think? I remember him more from the Hallowed Blight entries he wrote.
---
Jesus, the guy deleted every post. There‚Äôs really no need to grudge about him accidentally posting a clip multiple times lol
---
Now the Youngest survivors and Nancy and Steve right?
---
Don't use hex if you don't want it destroyed.
---
Pig needs a rework. Poor piggy can hardly keep up.
---
yes, totally farming.  the comments in here.. SMH
---
Haha, thats funny. You accidentally had ace in F tier instead of S
---
He would say "HERE COMES THE TRAPPER! YOU BETTER WATCH OUT FOR HIS TRAPS!"
---
Why the hell is whispers  at the bottom of the middle rank
---
Funny, it isn't hex ruin!
---
Na ps4?
---
I'd personally be glad you don't have it x)
---
Definitely refreshing to run into a killer helping out every now and then. Keep in mind, some people when a killer is doing this will usually just gen rush then leave ASAP. It's your move to continue to help out that's cool and all, but if someone isn't trying to play along / and or just gen rush and leave. Why not give them what they came for? Death on a hook. help the others out why not. It's still your playground as the killer, don't let anyone disrespect you my D00d
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand the hate for NOED. 
---
You play with 3 perks for 95% of the game
---
It can be cleansed
---
Survivors have strong perks as well, how in the hell is a killer supposed to catch two guys with adrenaline and dead hard? 
---
Leaving apart those salty survs that flame you after a 4K for the noed even tho the gems were non completed, absolute masterminds.
---
Could have just been me then which honestly sucks. I‚Äôm on Xbox so.
---
Ik just the way it looked like he was spamming for attention like other ppl do all is forgiven lol
---
You left scratch marks next to the window, you can even see them with fixated.
---
A killer that has yet to be released and survivors hook her instead of a pallet stun and each time she hooked she has a higher chance of Urban Evading around a map where she doesnt do anything but watch gens get done
---
Wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a hack, trapper seems just as surprised as you are.
---
New perk: the entity just drops you onto the killer
---
It doesn't conflict with the other offering though. It just increases the chance of getting that map so when two people use two different map offerings it makes it so there is a 1 in 2 chance of getting that map over the other.
---
Why?
---
No, it just lights up
---
No. But it will color a progress bar you‚Äôre working on.
---
And as soon as that happens I would stand up and two traps would be triggered, proceding me to get hooked, tunneled and then moried
---
In my experience since I always run enduring on most killers pallet stuns are a non issue.
---
About to study this
---
It actually is, lol. It stopped everybody from bitching about the game being held hostage, what more do you want? To change what it was designed to exactly do?
---
Changing the timer so survivors can feel "more pressure" is unnecessary, we get enough pressure as it is and we do gauge our time and decide if we should go for a save or not, etc.
---
Making it so no one can see the timer would make us less altruistic and just leave immediately. There's no point in staying if we lose track of time or we don't know when the endgame timer will end, and this will increase in killers slugging just to secure kills
---
Have an upvote
---
I would have performed a good'ol break action on that shit way earlier than expected.
---
i swear, it's so hilarious when killers swing after you escape through the hatch
---
She was probably phasing.
---
The chase could have ended infinitely sooner if he broke the pallet and didnt double back for no reason
---
Its annoying as fuck. Had a bunch of farming games ruined by this
---
f
---
Just the Meme I was looking for.
---
He's right between the bush and the wooden post.
---
But I love my Cake too much. I do prefer Balanced over deadhard but I get more use out of dh
---
happened multiple times right after that clip watch again from minute 23
---
This.. this is spot on.
---
Wrong flair, shitpost implies this masterpiece of an image is low-effort
---
That probably wasn't me but I used the Doc to farm points and also make sure the survivors got points.  Strictly Catch and Release System of mine lol. I got enough points to prestige my Doctor. Even got Thank You messages on my xbox, I was so happy!!
---
Sameeee
---
Practice and time in-game are the best things that will get you good :) ALSO! If you aren't having fun, do something else! Sometimes taking a break and then coming back fresh can be helpful. Remember to enjoy the game in addition to being good at it! Happy hunting, friend.
---
And what about her boring, if not bad, if not broken addons?
---
When the entity says "fuck this shit they need to die"
---
Except camping is a strategy, not a very good one but its a strategy, and it's not bannable. Screwing over your fellow survivor is bannable, and you're the real shitbag in this story.
---
ha, thank you. But its shitpost/meme so you know
---
Even so, he could have stopped doubleing back and broke the pallet
---
the legacy skins and exclusives mean a LOT to me, or else I would've bought the game anew already. it's a huge thing that not many people have anymore, a proof of playing before all the new blood web updates. losing them is the main thing holding me back from just rebuying the game.
---
He‚Äôs having a bad day man just leave him alone for a little bit.
---
What is player level cap
---
Honestly if this thing was flying at me id still terrified as hell
---
How big will the roots be like 1 meter or 10 meters etc
---
 it's not only funny but accurate as well
---
Did I ever say it was hard? It's still a good perk, not top tier. Don't assume what I'm saying. 
---
And Whispers is uncounterable which is why the person put it so high. It's a learning/crutch perk more than anything because it's basically a free sonar. Nobody runs it unless they really need it.
---
Nah, she was annoying.

better than [https://imgur.com/mdLQ5Bx](https://imgur.com/mdLQ5Bx)

I wont go over them all, but i can tell you ab some. My personal fav is myers. I love him being pretty much undetectable in tier one to being able to evolve to an unstoppable one hit machine. I also love billy and trapper bc of map control. Wraiths on the weaker side, as is the clown. I would say clowns better than wraith tho. Huntress and hag are also rlly good for map control, but im not as good with them. Everyone else imo is kinda meh, although this is just off the top of my head. I may have forgotten ab some good ones

Strong yes
---
DS to battle tunnelers
---
Maggie as Julie fight me
---
If a killer is regularly getting d striked post rework it is definitely on them and their playstyle.  The only D strikes I eat at this point are intentional ones to switch obsessions for my STBFl stacks.
---
Missed the whole damn thing studying for a big exam.
---
Finally now I can dead hard as killer
---
Does anyone know when the next one is?
---
Hahahaaa
---
What the actual fuck am I reading? You're literally specced to go 4 v 1 and succeed 90% of the time. No, killers are not weaker than survivors. Jesus fucking christ it's so heavily weighed to the killer side it's boring to play, and impossible to play against.
---
Hell ya my dude
---
Hag is nowhere near A tier in my opinion
---
True, she wouldn't have been. However, she was indeed very much annoying.
---
Alright makes sense. I play a fair ammount of trapper and I guess I never thought about what you have to do to see the traps
---
An unsafe pallet is still a useful resource.  You have to get the stun to gain ground out of it.  If you don‚Äôt get the stun, that means the killer has ‚Äòwon‚Äô that interaction and should be rewarded with a mind gameable hit.  If the survivor gets the stun, they ‚Äòwon‚Äô the interaction.  Fair and counterplay for both sides, just like we always asked for.
---
I love Huntress it is fun when you get a balanced map for her the small tricks and predictions u can do just makes me feel cooler like a Billy chainsaw curve around a corner
---
Rank 20 would have plague at the top of the list.
---
Username checks out.
---
No. No killer is weak, some take more skill than others, and it's all a matter of survivor skill vs killer skill. Don't listen to any idiot that tells you that survivor is stronger. Killer is easier to play and gets more BP. That's why everyone prefers to play it instead of survivor and why the killer queues are garbage. The only people who will tell you different are brain-dead killer mains who can't cut it as survivor and just want to bitch their game is too hard.   
---
TLDR; Killer is easier and pays more. That's why everyone wants to play it.
---
Ghosty looks like the Ripper from Identity V
---
I couldn't even find games during this bloodhunt. Constant errors and with my swf one person would always get kicked out of a lobby when we finally joined one. Played maybe 3 games total. Disappointing to say the least.
---
I finished my last match 1 minute after bloodhunt ended so I didn't get bonus bloodpoints ;(

Have you suffered a recent head trauma to cause this type of stupidity? Most people develop as they grow up. You seem to be taking 5 steps back behind everyone else.
---
That was informative and awesome. I really enjoy the larger maps. I wish they'd give us 3-5 tiered indoor maps too, or maybe a large building on a large map? I don't know. Seems fun.
---
Have you ever played good survivors? Maybe you‚Äôre right if you‚Äôre playing with a top tier nurse/spirit build, but most killers have a hard time against people who can actually play the game well.
---
Koichi pose
---
Because the skill tree is kinda boring and not very creative. You use BP to get more BP cause I heard you like BP in your BP. Then you take that BP and try to get one of the perks you want but it's not going to come soon so here's an item made of BP so you can get BP :P
---
I agree, last survivor deserves to attempt a kobe and then struggle on the hook. If they dont have deliverance they probably wont kobe anyways ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
So the player level has no limit
---
And then she tenta report your *ss to oblivion

[Here she is saying "fuck you" several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2oCV2sM_ig).

Dwight as Ned Flanders
---
You get points by cleansing totems, reuniting with teammates, working on a gen, so probably found a totem or two XD I do hate it when they do that and you lose your items/offerings because of it
---
No. Its a guessing game. You can try to predict whats going to happen, but in the end, its a guessing game.
---
Spies is honestly pretty nice... only on the right maps, though.
---
It's great on Hawkins, Badham, and Leery's.
---
Just buy them?
---
You sure showed that toxic rank 17 !
---
"hey look guys i 4kd against a rank 17 with iri heads and ebony mori im so good"
---
What are you talking about.? They have to swing at you to injure you.  If you think they swing drop the pallet.  If you think they will respect, take another lap.  That‚Äôs the mind game.  That‚Äôs the interaction for BOTH sides.  This isn‚Äôt a 1 sided game.  The survivor holds all the cards, because the killer is forced to swing.  Maybe you are just making mistakes.
---
That is adorable

---
even crazier he had so much bloodlust he could have just walked 1 way
---
Ultra rare add-on: Cupcake-inator
---
No it was just me being desperate for the pallet, also I hoped the Killer would miss the swing because hes paying attention to that. It kinda worked. Good killers would have predicted the Dead Hard.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with noed? It‚Äôs the same as someone using adrenaline lol
---
Kinda wish they would have extended this one since it was buggy as hell and I couldn't connect half the time
---
Michael because I find him really simple and effective to play, also because it's Michael and that chase music is awesome
---
Nope, I float between yellow and green ranks and I can say with utmost certainty so does the bulk of the player base. Here in these ranks and even in purple, I've noticed killers definitely have and keep the upper hand.
---
meh, I had an absolute horrendous time. Saw maybe 2 BPS the whole time. Killers not extended matches and 4k'ing within a few minutes. I mean, I get they're just playing the game. But they'd only benefit themselves if they extended it just a little bit
---
the time he was running around that he had so much bloodlust..
---
Tf
---
Susie Legion because I like the fact that she runs really fast, sees survivors through walls, vaults pallets really fast and causes bleeding.
---
I will try that next time. I know he wanted to do that, so I slammed the pallet onto his head so he loses bloodlust. Didn't completely work sadly because I was stuck at the loop for a slight milisecond.
---
Wraith has the voice of an angel, a really talented singer
---
On Nurse? Yeah.
---
On anybody else it doesn't provide any real benefit other than "I feel like I'm ZOOMING"
---
Legion. I love everything about them up from design to backstory, and playstyle. It's fast paced and fun, I don't get upset if I don't kill everyone because no matter what my chase and brutality are normally maxed
---
Hillbilly, you can patrol the gens fast as hell and have a 1 hit down capability. My other favorite to play is plague Because you make the survivors choose between being a 1 hit down all game or giving me super Saiyan vomit.
---
The last Gen was finished. But he wanted to bait him to the Gen first before finishing it.
---
MEBAETE

We need the ass crossbow from scary movie

Plague isnt very good at all, Id just get Clown for his perks. Bamboozle and Pop are good
---
the entity putting together those foam shapes from public school math classes: this would make a good sub-realm
---
to be fair most of these characters sounds are just grunts.
---
They still got their points, it for some reason just glitched on my screen saying that they didn't get any
---
Glad to hear that! üòä
---
''Wanna switch'' ''Okay!''
---
Nah, I don't need an increase of unsafe pallets to destroy SWFs. But I know this - there are very few maps that anyone can say is neutral or killer sided. I also know that a safe pallet is about the least skillful game play mechanic there is. So anything that creates more skill in the game, and any map that gives both sides a chance is much appreciated.
---
Ok thank you
---
I like everything except the gamer shoes (Even if they are pretty freakin epic)
---
I just got out of a match with a farming killer right as steam went down and when it finally came back up.... my points didn't save lmao. And I had used a gateau.....
---
I do
---
F.
---
Also, you should‚Äôve taken the picture upside down p.
---
thats the point of ruin really. its there to force the survivors to stop stacking gens and find the ruin totem to buy the killer more time.
---
Feels bad for using insta down hatchets and an eboni
---
Good one
---
Idk man, ya think bamboozle is needed to shut down jungle gyms and Shack, when you could easily shut both of them down by not being a bad killer and out mindgaming them lol.
---
Thanks man.
---
Premonition is just worse spine chill I agree but spine chill has more upsides
---
Leave the piggy and nerf the spirit .-. also give piggy a black robe
---
Leatherface inspired Billy‚Äôs creation, Billy‚Äôs just the prodigal son who performs better than his dad at his own job.
---
PC players are probably going to hate me but I would suggest PS4. That's what I play on and just started about a month ago. Everywhere I read about this game I hear about toxic players and campers and other horrible stuff but never seem to got that on PS4. Then when I ask what platform they play on they all say PC. So at least in my own personal experience the player base seems to be less toxic on PS4, unless PC players just exaggerate.
---
This is pretty good except Second Wind is secretly poop - it can‚Äôt even work with Deliverance.
---
lol as if, the term Reddit Killer exists for a reason
---
Yet again I never said it was needed. Bamboozle can sometimes be faster than mindgaming and some good survivors don't fall for it.
---
F13 was a good game doomed by bad development. Even with the low quality balancing on behaviors end, it‚Äôs still playable. F13, was unbalanced. The counselors had way to many ways to get out with EASE. And should Jason be tailing them, just hit him with the weapons that are everywhere, or shoot him. 
---
It did so much right, but the wrongs were too much, so it struggled.
---
At least adrenaline awards you for winning instead of noed
---
3 pillar man's awaken
---
Hi, I just started the game yesterday, and I've played like 3 matches, all as Dwight. I've watched a lot of YouTube videos before starting, so I know a little bit already, but I'd like to ask some questions.
---
1. As a rank 20 should i be getting atched with rank 16s, 15s, and sometimes even lower? I feel like I'd be dead weight, especially since my Dwight is only level 5 and I'm using level 1 bond and lightweight.
---
2. What are tiles? I hear the word but i dont know what it means.
---
3. Are loops just places you can run around with the killer a few times to waste time before dropping a pallet? Or are they set map locations I should remember
---
4. When is it safe to unhook someone, and then heal them?
---
5. How do I time pallet drops properly?
---
6. Can I get some times on landing skill checks more consistently? I haven't run into ruin yet but i feel like I'd get destroyed by it. And I just fail them often too.
---
7. Are there any general traps that new players fall into that i should avoid? Wether it be mentality or gameplay wise.
---
8. What are commonly run killer perks and how do I deal with them?
---
Sorry for unloading a whole lot of questions, but even if only 1 or 2 questions can be answered it would be a huge help! Thanks in advance.
---
We need a sub dedicated to Michael Myers memes. They‚Äôre the fucking best
---
Anytime I manage to loop like this I'll go down and then see a survivor come out of a locker and/or someone crouch walking on the other end of the map
---
I don't want Spirit nerfed, just Piggy buffed.
---
This response to your question is exactly what I'm talking about in my previous response I just wrote to you. I've never once had anybody teabag me or say gg ez after a bad performance as killer on PS4.
---
‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm not a real doctor, I just play one on tv‚Äù
---
dead hard tier 40
---
Getting stunned doesn‚Äôt make them lose bloodlust actually! Only when breaking the pallet, losing chase, a successful attack, or using certain abilities.
---
Sadly yes
---
üò≥
---
Until totem placement is fixed I'd rather not have more totem perks
---
Nah, all those streamers? That's when you play super try hard yourself. The gloves come off! Generator rushing and humping pseudo infinite windows!
---
You can get some really nasty setups on the Suffocation Pit.
---
I mean Freddy's laugh sounds pretty bad ass but compared to the Doctor.....The doctor has the most bad ass laugh I've ever heard
---
to be fair, it sounds like they gave Bruce Campbell a handy to get his injured noises.
---
I played nothing but killer games one morning due to the game giving me nothing but killer dailies. I only farmed a single game due to 2 out of the 4 survivors disconnected when they got downed. So I was getting my points without them via farming lol.
---
But I also like the the sound the wraith makes getting a pallet dropped on him for some reason.
---
It may or may not have relation with the fact that my killer is rank 5 and my surv is rank 15 because I rarely play it
---
And clown?
---
I run kindred so everyone can see that they're all letting me down
---
I'd be pissed if i was him
---
This is why you run through all the traps vault a window 5 times and teabag the hag as you pallet slam her into oblivion.
---
All while your teammate dies on the hook because everyone else is still crouching.
---
Kudos to him. David has one of the most believable screams in the game imo. And the way that it pierces through the entire map? Beautiful
---
*moris instead*
---
I haven't but I play on PS4.  I also have a hard time finding survivors as a fellow survivor or as a killer.
---
UwU
---
ETUUUU!! ETUUUUU!!
---
1. Matchmaking is fucked but generally 20-15 get matched together since theyre the "unranked" tier of the rank list and are within the same skill level. You cant derank from normal gameplay below 15, only rank reset can. 
---
2. Tiles are the combinations of structures (T-Walls, L-Walls, etc) around the map. Check the glossary in the sidebar for definitions on those structures.
---
3. Yeah your first definition is about right. Its just somewhere that can waste time between a pallet within a tile. There are named loops like "Cowtree loop" and "Shack Loop" for specific structures as well.
---
4. Its safe to unhook and heal when the killer is in a chase or not near. If youre feeling risky and you have We'll Make It, you can heal the unhooked insanely fast. I wouldnt bother healing on the hook unless you have We'll Make It regardless.
---
5. Theres no definitive way to time it since youre not surviving against someone with an automated way of going through a pallet. Some killers you'll want to drop it early, some you'll want to play around it until you cant. I'd watch a video like OhTofu's on pallets.
---
6. Listen for the noise that indicates a skillcheck and dont bother trying to hit the great if youre not comfortable with it. Hit it like right as its touching just inside the right tip of the bar
---
7. I'll edit this one in later if nobody responds to it
---
8. the "meta" build is Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, and Spirit's Fury. 
---
Ruin, just work through it unless you happen to come across the totem.
---
BBQ, if youre within a certain radius to the hook (40 m?) it wont affect you, but if youre outside that radius, your aura is revealed when a survivor is hooked. Hide in a locker or run a perk like distortion if you can, if not then walk one direction for 4 seconds and then turn around and walk the other way. 
---
Enduring, they get reduced pallet stuns, nothing you can do about it really, I guess you could drop the pallet early if you wanted. Just start your loop earlier than you would if they didnt have the perk
---
Spirit's Fury, when they break 2 pallets, the third one breaks over their head if you hit them with it. Loop pallets as much as possible and try not to drop it ASAP. When you think they have it, toss down the pallets early so they cant use the Spirit Fury + Enduring combo and get a free hit on you
---
On the PS4, being the killer is the fastest way to get a match.
---
I remember playing the game after the new patch, which was before the Bloodhunt event and que for killer was still long. So I don't think the event was the reason.
---
She honestly would have made more sense lore wise to be put in the game but she sadly died too soon and became a meme.
---
Also watch the golden globes Barb is still alive rap if you haven't already.
---
Wraith has an interesting story. I always wondered why The Entity chose him and why his appearance is the way it is.
---
About as fun as running in circles all game
---
Spooky girl gets no sympathy
---
And how are we suppose to believe you without any proof?
---
there are offerings that increase luck, what does that do?
---
Exactly  like he really thought this was something to be proud of
---
Is it worth the buy in your opinion? It seems extremely repetitive and shallow gameplay features
---
a man of many talents
---
It affects your chances of unhooking yourself and untrapping yourself from bear traps
---
please go outside bro
---
What is the point in lieing
---
So you bullied some killer that obviously has way less hours than you. Noice.
---
I did it by making a deal with survivor to kill em all then farm with him and kill him.... just to clarify, i am not the one who texted first, he asked to farm, so i told him what was gonna happen, we made a deal. Am i clean? God have mercy on me for cheating.... but dude really wtf what if i was doing it for real and last escaped from hatch? Happened once won‚Äôt let it again
---
Even when you're phasing?
---
How is it a good tracking perk out of phase? I just follow scratch marks and usually ignore the blood.
---
I remember when I first played ghost face... Good times
---
Don‚Äôt worry, just some salty player being an ass.
---
I personally play nurse just because I find her fun to play once you've mastered her, and if l were to lose a game it wouldn't because there was nothing I could do but that I should've played better, encourages me to improve
---
Limiting last ditch to only be used when you are on your last hook or keeping it as is with one use and a three minute broken effect would likely make it more user friendly and prevent it from being forgotten like MoM.
---
Then again this would probably cause an outrage of some sort in the killer community due to its chaotic nature and BM opportunities.
---
def considered it - in fact I did a version of them puking, but it didn't quite work
---
How many times can I stack dying light and how much does it stack up to in percentage?
---
Sorry, yes, phasing was what I was mostly talking about
---
Yeah she clearly sees the scratch marks at the window.
---
It makes them bleed more so the blood is easier to follow, the blood is more accurate tracking than the scratches as is. Plus it also slows down their healing speeds quite a bit. They'll be wasting more time healing
---
Perhaps
---
I don't get it? you tripped over? are you that embarassed that you'd make things up?
---
So sloppy is kinda useless since it doesn't help while phasing?
---
Sorry, for who ever wants the build it‚Äôs 
---
Infectious fright 
---
Bbq and chili 
---
Make your choice 
---
Hex:Ruin AND OR Nurses calling
---
I go back and forth with Ruin and Nurses cuz if I see them running too boxes or they join at the same time implying a four stack I use Ruin other than that nurses is amazing
---
I just prefer Robin
---
Oh wow I missed a blood hunt and am late to the stranger things party...... I need to get back on the horse.
---
I joined server is empty :(
---
And when I said tracking I was also talking about using your ears to track injured survivors while phasing
---
Edit: autocorrect mistake
---
I‚Äôm legit killer rank 19 and survivor rank 15 but I get bad red ranks at survivor while I get good rank 1s at killer
---
All these comments so damn toxic, keep up the good survivor culling!
---
If I wanted to replace sloppy, what perk would you recommend for spirit?
---
why does this game favor the killer and why TF is their aim assist on Xbox?? PC kids got it nice but the xbox version blows. fix matchmaking.
---
I‚Äôd say move Clown to C, his ability atleast helps force pallet drops early, not much but helps later on in the game to make areas not safe.
---
Freddy should be A, can slow down the game and still have very good map pressure with teleporting to gens.
---
Hag and Plag down one tier, Hag can be good but is slower MS. Plag is just M1 killer if they never cleanse, but is strong when they do (it depends on the survivors she against)
---
Huntress move up one tier. Solid killer, heavily map reliant unlike most killers but can be deadly when played correctly
---
B tops.
---
Yea I wasn't sure about it! Thanks for clarification. Next time I try to walk instead :)
---
You can see the remains of totems if they're cleansed. The reason it was a VERY long match was because I scoured the entire thing looking for even 1 hint of a totem. Absolutely nothing showed.
---
Unless he has video evidence of you actively working with the survivor you gave the hatch to, which he doesn't because you say you weren't working with him, just being nice, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. I have gotten many many threats of ban from salty entitled survivers but nothing has ever happened because I have never used cheats or anything worth banning over. Don't worry about it, he's just a salty ass.
---
It wasn't really a game. So I atleast black pip. He gets the full Entity Displeased for that shit
---
Honestly it's been very buggy and inconsistent so I've dropped it. I've had a game where I heal someone with someone else's help and gotten 50% of the meter. Dumb but makes sense I guess. Then later we both heal another person together and...now it's 75% filled...what?
---
One time I healed someone full and only got to 99%. And no he didn't heal himself.
---
Hate that a lot of game devs focus on weekends only for events.
---
Should be a week long affair.
---
"me want for christmas" is objectification unfortunately babes
---
I really wish they would have extended it or have another soon. The lobbies on ps4 were ABSOLUTE TRASH. I would ready up, connect to a lobby, bounce back to the ready up screen, get into a lobby, the countdown timer is broken and not counting down, survivor ranks go from babby to redranks, killer leaves the lobby, bounce back to ready screen, wait for 15 mins, get into a lobby, wait for another 20 mins, finally get into a match, 2 survivors dc as soon as they get downed in the first 2 minutes of the match, killer moris me and blendette gets the hatch. Let's not forget how my endgame timer is broken and all the salt I keep getting for not going back and saving someone when I don't even know how much time I have left to begin with.
---
As a newer huntress I get the frustration with this map, honestly I've been just trying to learn the map better. With any map there's gonna be places where hatchets aren't gonna be as useful. I find just learning the map/what places I can throw vs just trying to cut them off &amp; get a regular hit off on them helps. Map still is one of my least favorites as a killer but it makes matches less embarrassing.

feng min? they all look the same anyways

What makes sloppy better than blood hound?
---
There are MANY boosted players as a result of double BP lol
---
Oboy you bet I'm buying this advice. LOL
---
I  took off the audio because I was shocked, swearing and laughing a lot. This game is nuts 
---
Felt really bad because these randoms were really good xD
---
Would ruin be better do you think? Instead of sloppy in this build?
---
Whenever I assume the killer may have NOED, I usually go on the totem hunt while my teammates do gens, because you know totems give the most bloodpoints besides escaping. That way I get a lot of points while avoiding noed
---
No one else is joining :(((
---
At least they got one done. Wouldn't have surprised me if they didn't finish any
---
But if you do leave a husk behind, also give players an option to reconnect. I‚Äôve had my connection drop during matches one or two times before and it‚Äôs infuriating, especially when you‚Äôre having fun.
---
Yeah, I do...
---
If it happened multiple times and you were the only one backed out in your swf, I would assume its an issue with you and not the killer since you're the common factor. Probably an issue between the new update and your computer/connection.
---
It probably is timing
---
press e to magically phase through hits just like dark souls
---
Remember when they said they weren‚Äôt having a summer event so they could make the game more stable? Good times.
---
That would be awesome but I doubt it
---
Fuck spirit fuck everything spirit stands for
---
New Nurse weapon, BHVR please.
---
I wish it could make a Nyah sound.
---
So if my pc blows up mid match i cant have a opinion
---
Honestly whoever did Laurie did a really good job bc no shade to JLC but she also screams like a banshee, so Laurie is pretty accurate
---
It could have ended even sooner if he knew how to fake double backs.
---
That and playing killer is the cooler way any way
---
oh yeah that is , and i will not normilie sexism here . But bare in mind that objectifying men is not something that this world sees often . So thats why you dont see reacts on that . It is not right , but not at the same level as women objectification , because of the sociaty .
---
I didn't see them say anything about OP and it's pretty hard to deny that it's unfair when healthy survivors get hit for the first time in the match, get camped on hook and the other survivors can't find the last totem in time because they cleansed the 4 most visible totems which caused the best hidden totem to become lit.
---
When I started out as killer, I used NOED all the time, later learned about to controversy surrounding the perk and I tried playing without it, thats when I realised how big of a crutch this perk is. I didn't have to learn to become better because at the end, I got a free movement speed bonus and insta down.
---
Before you do that please let us have Jason Voorhees
---
I played a game a while back where my friend and I died then a feng found out they could land on the conveyer looking things. She stood there until her friend showed up and they were both on them teabagging and pointing until the ghostface found them and marked them. Then he moried the feng and the meg got hatch.
---
If you really like Plague's power then I'd go for her, because it's pretty quirky and it's not to everyone's taste. Infectious Fright is also pretty handy if you have instadowns or otherwise benefit from snowballing survivors. T3 Corrupt Intervention is nice if you're morally opposed to Ruin - if you have a good tracking perk then you've basically got 2 minutes to kill one survivor and cripple the rest. Dark Devotion is extremely niche and I wouldn't recommend running it unless you're really confident about how it fits into your build.
---
Clown for perks... Pop Goes the Weasel is probably the best "guaranteed" regression perk - so long as you can get hooks, you're good to go. Pairing it with Ruin will buy you an awful lot of time (pairing it with Corrupt Intervention can potentially save you when the 3 blocked gens turn out to be miles apart). For my money both Bamboozle and Coulrophobia are niche perks - they're only going to be strong on certain killers running certain loadouts. If you fall into that category, go for it.
---
If you haven't already, watch some high level Plague play and see what it does for you. However, if you don't have Ruin then I'm going to strongly suggest snagging Clown for Pop Goes the Weasel - slowdown and regression perks are vital when you get out of Yellow ranks, and it's hard to have fun when your game ends in minutes because you have nothing to stall survivors with.
---
I've yet to meet a toxic Feng Min player, which surprised me, since the character herself is an esports player. So you think it'd be most lore-friendly if all the sweaty tryhards played her
---
I think it was based off of season 1 ST
---
yeah I get that, just a shame its all the other little unimportant things people jump on you about and not things that might be making dudes uncomfortable
---
I don't think a comparison between the two is apt - apart from the weapon and add-ons (great job again by BHVR), they play completely different. 
---
HB is much more mobile and offers more open map pressure (making him generally better), but Bubba has better controlled zoning and can be much more oppressive in a smaller area.
---
Unfortunately, half of  Bubba's add-ons either do literally nothing all (at best) or penalize you for using them with no upside  (at worse). The bumbling by BHVR with Bubba would almost be impressive, if it weren't so pathetic.
---
Same tbh
---
They are. They do it because it brings a sense of familiarity to the people who are playing. I love playing Myers because I love Halloween. Plus there are more normal killers/survivors than licensed ones. So we're probably getting a non-licenced chapter. So calm the titties down.
---
Nah she's Chinese and they'd look different nothing alike
---
My thoughts exactly. Everything would be fine in the world if he had escaped im sure.
---
A survivor who has a flashlight, knows how to loop, and doesn't t-bag/flashlight click at every jump?
---
You're a man of culture, I see.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm stupid but how do you use head on? I still haven‚Äôt been able to use it right, I just come out of the locker slowly like normal. Wtf am I doing wrong
---
So weird dude cause on xbox it's like 30 seconds for killer matches and like between 1 and 3 min for surv. Probably only because it's on gamepass.

Yeah, it's still possible, but I feel like when going against survivors who know how to do extremely high speed 360s, one frame they will be in front of you in the center of the screen and the next frame they will literally be fucking gone out of your POV, its fucking ridiculous. There is nothing a killer can do when a survivors slips out of view within a single frame, they have no idea which way they went.

He kept saying he was recording or something but tbh im not worried about being banned at all im mostly just wondering where this all comes from. Ive NEVER had this hostility before when I gave the hatch.

I think it wouldn‚Äôt be a perk, but the power
---
And to clarify it effects everyone but the obsession?
---
There must be an objectively best spirit build though.
---
Rank 16ish haven't played for a couple of weeks being too busy with work. Most people that game were 15+ including the angry one.
---
Nice Slender Man Mask.
---
You've already got a good answer, I'll just pad it out with some thoughts of my own:
---
**1:** Yes you should, and no you're not dead weight. As a survivor there's a 25% chance the killer is chasing you (at least at game start...). If they're not chasing you, you're doing gens, and doing gens is the main thing for you to be doing.
---
**6:** You learn by bitter experience. There are a number of skillcheck simulators out there, any one of them should be sufficent (the better ones allow you to factor in things like Ruin).
---
**7:** Not knowing their scoring events, not knowing how to loop, not knowing how to use pallets, and not knowing how best to spend Bloodpoints. We have a sticky thread with a big pile of guides for new players - personally I recommend Otzdarva and the various pallet, looping, and tile guides by OhTofu. While not covered by any guide, a common trap is for new players to rush right into killer with no perks and no insight on the survivor mind. Spending time as survivor is the fastest and strongest way to improve your killer, bar none. In turn, spending time as killer will give you a better appreciation for how to run your survivor. Don't get stuck playing the one role - diversify and get the benefits of both.
---
**8:** Ruin is the first and most notorious - you counter it by getting better or by cleansing the totem and hoping that it wasn't Haunted Ground. Barbecue &amp; Chilli is a notorious tracking perk, you swerve it by being in a locker (and hoping that the killer doesn't have Iron Maiden) or by being no more than 40m from the hook as your friend is going on it. Other than that, you can expect perks to combat pallets (so learn how to pallet) and potentially No One Escapes Death (countered by either not dicking around once the last generator is done, or by cleansing all the unlit totems in advance).
---
The most important thing about starting out - don't get tilted. The second most important thing is to find friends - it's fun to play together, and you've a slightly better chance of surviving the trial. There's a weekly thread here for hooking up with people, and the nicer streamers often have an equally nice Discord where you can also hook up with people that have a shared interest. Good luck, and have fun.
---
I thought BHs being toxic was just a bad meme, but it's fucking true.
---
This was like my 4th BH and now I can confirm that it's true.
---
Throwing a pallet down that early lmao
---
It would of been worth it.
---
\*in Jojo sounds \*  
---
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes...
---
I had two nice doctors.
---
Woah that‚Äôs actually really cool! I wish I could tell you who/where to send this to because I‚Äôd really like to see this be official
---
Because at this point we only get double BP 4 times a fucking YEAR. If that. 
---
I get the whole "play how you want" argument, I really do. However, when you deliberately CHOOSE to spend a ridiculous rare 2 day event out of a whole year playing 4 minute Nurse stomp fests and then sitting in queue for 40 minutes, when you stand to gain MASSIVELY from just cooperating with your opponents for 48 measly goddamn hours instead, you are objectively suffering from a mental disorder and should get help.
---
Yeah I knew I just meant I would use it on her thanks though üëçüèª
---
Yeah I try my best to not call someone for lag switch
---
The first guy to use NOED be like
---
Of course. Glad to help. I would totally use this perk more often if it didn't kill me quickly and I have to rely on randoms to save me
---
Well start somewhere, at least then we can have a discussion. Otherwise it's just a back and forth of it's good no it's not.
---
How you know dbd is slowly driving me crazy XD
---
wow that's aggressive
---
specifically targeting one person on the enemy team is a thing that can be done in literally any pvp team game my dude, it's not bannable in any of those other games either, and the dbd community is possibly the only community that whines about it
---
&gt;u use bloodpoints to get more bloodpoints
---
Although boring, its how investment works.
---
So not the point, but whatever. Getting tired of all these excuses Survivor mains have.
---
Also - their need to get you to chase them will make them less scared of you and they may make very risky moves, giving you a free hit to start the chase.
---
Yeah def can be upsetting
---
Honestly lately I really feel like ditching Ruin. Most of the games the thing just either gets found within the first minutes (totem placement next to a gen is big brain time), or the survivors know how to get around it. 
---
I would try to run PGTW or Corrupt Intervention instead. Both give you guaranteed value as opposed to Ruin.
---
Are you one of those Claudettes that hide in corners? Can confirm, am Russian, would not rescue you.
---
That‚Äôs the scariest thing I can imagine
---
In some ways, it's more reliable. It can require an accompanying information perk for maximum efficiency, but I like it a lot. I'd say those 3 killers definitely benefit most from it, since they have mobility and quick down potential.
---
so this is why he's not in the switch version...
---
What platforn?
---
1. Your not supposed to, unless in a group with a friend who has a higher rank, sometimes if you can't find a match then it will pair you with higher ranks
---
2. Tiles are places on the map that will always spawn in that location, in certain areas you'll find walls in certain shapes and formations, those are areas can consist of three different structures, a T-wall and L-wall, a jungle gym, and some other structure i forgot the name of. The T-wall and L-Wall structure is pretty self explanatory, it consists of a wall in the shape of a T and wall in the shape of an L, both are parallel to each other and consist of two vaults. There is a chance however that two t-walls will spawn. A jungle gym is a structure with a bunch of walls that are short in length and one long wall. The jungle gyms have a pallet and vault, the vault being located on the long wall. It's mandatory if want to loop the killer to understand how to properly loop these tiles and others. 
---
3. Looping is basically running the killer around a tile or pallet in a sort of repeating manner, in a loop. Its always something to remember when looping around pallets or tiles, and how to properly loop around them to waste time. During loops always understand the location of the killer and how they try and mindgame you. When a killer mindgames you they basically try and tricl you into doing something so they get a hit or down. Doubling back is a very common way for killers to mindgame survivors, its when a killer backs up and points their red stain to a certain area but is gling the opposite way.
---
4. It depends on the killer. Certain killers have abilities that can make unhooking people difficult, for example, the Hag has traps that activate when survivors are walking or running near them, causing a jumpscare where a clone of her jumps up and screams at you, she also has the ability to teleport to traps that are activated when within a certain range crouch walking past them won't activate the traps. These traps make unhooking very difficult since crouch walking is slow and allows for easy time for the Hag to catch survivors after being unhooked or going for an unhook. Research the different killers and keep in mind what the killers power is and how to deal with them when unhooking a survivor or being unhooked. Otherwise, a good time to unhook is when the killer is in a chase not near the hooked survivor or when the killer walks away far enough that you can't hear their terror radius. Perks like  borrowed time help with unhooking near, giving the unhooked survivor the ability to tank through 1 hit when unhooked in the terror radius of the killer. 
---
5. Pallets can be very tricky for beginners. A good way to know when through down a pallet is to understand how far the killer is from you, the speed that their going, the killers power, and have a decent understanding of a the lunge distance of the killer. Killers can do whats called "respecting" a pallet, which is when a killer stops when they think a pallet is going to be thrown down to avoid a stun. Additionally, notice how the killer plays, when or when not they go for hits and hoe they loop around certain pallets and tiles. As you get better, it will get easier to analyze a killers playstyle and how they loop
---
6. Theirs no specific timing for skillchecks, my only tip is to repair generators more often and get used to hitting good skillchecls before trying to hit great ones.
---
7. Survivors can fall for mindgames which is when a killer tries to trick you into doing something to get a hit or down, as i explained in a previous question
---
8. The most common perks are Hex:Ruin, Barbeque and Chili, Hex: Dveour Hope, Hex: Haunted Grounds, and Hex: No One Escapes Death. A ton of killers like to run Hex perks which cause a negative affect towards survivors and are assigned to "totems" which look like three skulls held up by bones, you'll if its a hex when it has a lit fire underneath it. To get rid of the totem you have to go up to it and press the button it says to and hold it until the bar is full. Ruin regressess a generator by a certain percentage based on the level of ruin when a good skillcheck is hit, great skillchecks are unaffected by the regress but count as a good skillcheck. BBQ and Chili is a perk that reveals the aura of survivors outside of a certain distance when hooking a survivor. Haunted Grounds creates two hex totems that, when one is cleansed, make survivors oneshot for a certain period of time. No One Escapes Death makes every survivor one shot when all generators are completed as long as their totems for it to be assigned to. Devour Hope grants tokens when survivors unhook each other. When three tokens are achieved, survivors become one shot and after four they can be killed when they get downed
---
3+3+3+2, for a total of 11 stacks, or 33% at T3.
---
Note that the 11 is largely academic - to reach it you'd have to rotate your Obsession between all 4 survivors. Assuming your Obsession never changes, the max is 9 stacks - or 27% at T3.
---
Yeah, the game was free with PlayStation plus like last November or something. Didn‚Äôt help much
---
I main killer.
---
r/emojipolice
---
Thank you so much ! I learned recently how to make limbs of photos move so thats how I got that. Ive tried sending this along with some other samples to DBD and Behavior. But obviously it's just gonna look like spam :(
---
Idk ruin, pop, corrupt, and bbq is pretty unbeatable but subbing out ruin wouldn‚Äôt hurt that bad
---
No. I like well-known killers and survivors. And it¬¥s far from lazy, they still need to create an interesting power, perks and add-ons.
---
How is a killer like Michael lazy? Evil Within and his add-ons are probably the most creative thing in this game.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dbk11x/question_do_the_perks_fixated_and_urban_evasion/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
No the dlc is season 3. Because they dont want kids to die and Steve and Nancy were both still under age in season 1 and 2
---
After we got the Trapper face reveal... I realized the Trapper is totally based off of him physically. They have very similar faces minus the beard.
---
You can just use both but if you are in a rank above 15 i would use ruin since most survivors at that rank dont land great skillchecks but if you‚Äôre below that from my experience ruin can get combated easily and gets found easy so it honestly depends on your skill level and not just high mobility killers or not
---
I am hoping they'll just overhaul the graphics entirely for next gen consoles. Imagine if DBD actually looked polished. Thats a long shot though.
---
Yes, but it's a trivial increase. Second, not everything is better as rarity improves - for example, certain killers have particularly disappointing high level add-ons compared to their more common ones.
---
If they say so then they must be right
---
Not sure what rank you're in, but I'm sure there are a lot of people who are just scared and immersed tbh. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of selfish, dumb people in the game. But there are a lot of immersed people that play to just survive. If they don't think they can safely get you while also surviving, they won't, they'll just leave.
---
Almost makes me forget the last time she 4k‚Äôd me and my friends in 3 minutes
---
Yes you did tunnel. You're not allowed to hit people as soon as they got unhooked unless there is BT. kek
---
Nah, you are fine. He is a sore loser.
---
So I had a rough game trying out a new build with the pig. They were just absolutely stomping me. When the gates were opened I got a couple of them down and injured, and there was a lot of brave teabagging to get my attention and get everyone off the hooks and out the doors. 
---
But they decided to fuck around at the exits for some reason. One injured guy ran off to the other exit because he knew I saw him, and he didn't make it in time. The other perfectly healthy guy started running towards the exits at the end of the timer and I started blocking him. 
---
They both got skewered, and then they accused me of "exploiting" the timer because of the slight desync. I was reported.
---
Gotta love this community
---
It's not tunneling but it's a dick move.
---
What exactly was he supposed to do?  Stand still?  I mean, he even clearly messed up a couple times and the ghost face *still didn't hit him*.
---
Survivors are Never Wrong.
---
I personally down the person who is unhooking, if they are full go then yes they get the unhook but it will be a trade
---
I just love DBD ! Im a horror nut and really enjoy making this kind of work. I will do that for sure. I just want to specialize in this specifically. DBD isn't the biggest game in the world so thought if I could replicate some of the graphics they use (based this off the pig chapter) they might take something of mine on for free.
---
The amount of people I ran into that just did the Choke or Head Punch on everybody was ridiculous. The kills barely required any space to do unlike kills such as the Body Slam so once you're grabbed you're dead just a quickly. Like, it's not even a strategy. They were literally just cheap ways to get quick kills.
---
Thank you for your time :)
---
Ha you make me laugh i didn‚Äôt even participate
---
No you could use make your choice or just use haunted ground or a ruin if you want to use hexes
---
Yes 100% does not work at all
---
The iridescent head doesn't help with being able to actually hit. You can have an instadown but still miss every shot.
---
Mindbreaker
---
No and it's not lazy at all.
---
We wanted it nerfed not destroyed
---
You‚Äôve definitely got some great potential! Definitely start building up your resume and if you get an opportunity elsewhere take it, I really hope it works out for you!
---
The amount i farmed in this Bloodhunt was not even close to what i wanted to be satisfied. Played mostly Survivor with a few good matches, a lot of moris, i don't think there was ever more than 2 BPS, and as killer lots of delays and i am bored to play only killer many times straight.
---
Today there though was a kinda fun moment. I managed to play a couple hours before event ended and gathered around 500k. In my last game i was Legion and there were still around 15 minutes to go. I got kinda fast the 2 kills, but i had 1 gen left and no hooks(i think) to the other 2. When i saw i only have 5, then 4, then 3 minutes, and saw via Discordance that they both working on a gen, i just stood by the Exit to open it fast when they finished and chased them out.
---
Mission accomplished, we made it in time for the last Bloodhunt with the exact picture in this post. 1' remaining xD
---
Isn't devour hope better than haunted grounds though?
---
I also agree, but Nancy has more to do with the upside down and the overall story as where Robin came later and just got introduced to it. Still would've rather had her tbh though.
---
I just leave if I get that map as killet. It's endless pallet hell.
---
I want Myers to actually do that when he Tiers up
---
Hard disagree chief. There's nothing lazy about having to come up with perks and abilities that aren't broken, let alone the entire process of licensing as a whole with modeling and mapping.  Licensed DLC is great
---
Devour hope is completely nullified when broken haunted grounds still allows you to down people
---
As a killer main, this is why the most advanced tip I can give any aspiring killer is **BREAK THE FUCKING PALLET**
---
"Bro do an enduring 2 pallet stun lol"
---
I don‚Äôt get why you getting hooked means your the sole survivor
---
That's weird
---
not until community sees that the game has stopped being survivor-sides for a long time already
---
Petition to make dead hard a roll
---
my man‚Äôs had bloodlust 12
---
Clearly you didnt face a 4man mom ds team
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and tunneling isn‚Äôt toxic. It‚Äôs a valid strategy to get weaker players out of the game early. Or it can cost you the game as you can get looped and gens get done. 
---
It‚Äôs certainly not fun for the player who can‚Äôt loop, but it‚Äôs definitely not toxic. That word has been misused so much it‚Äôs practically meaningless now.
---
Bill is to loved, even the killer wants him saved
---
I‚Äôve faced a 4 man Adrenaline, DS, Self-care and MoM team all flashlights and got a 3k. I know my shit gamer
---
But haunted grounds is completely nullified if it ISNT broken.
---
Jendenise: mY uI mOd iS pRiVaTe
---
As a killer main... yes get it. I play Laurie ( sometimes) and it is top tier!
---
I don‚Äôt think it should be brought back but rather changed the old MoM let you basically take an extra hit while not putting any effort into charging it up. You certainly could try and get those hits in but you didn‚Äôt need to. I think the only change they need to do is to either replace or add safe hook rescues to help activate the perk.
---
Chinese don't even look alike to each other, they are different ethnic groups
---
Can u do ghostface
---
That actually makes a lot of sense
---
My theory is vast majority of people playing survive with friends, even if it is not all 4 being friends, just having 2 survivors able to communicate and coordinate makes a huge difference.
---
When I play killer it is very noticeable. Even if you play with 4 good survivors that are not friends they are noticeably less coordinated.  
---
When you play survivor of course you run into less chance of playing with survive with friends and the game is way challenging.
---
Spirit is just a ghost girl that has an infinite period
---
It spawns two trapped hexes and if you apply pressure to the totem containing haunted its personally better i prefer it over devour
---
I break palettes immediately. And after three loops, I ignore the survivor and go after another.
---
Thank you for that answer :)
---
Maybe something like that but it didn't seem EQ specific, more like overall aggressive compression that only brought the volume down of the specific scream after hooking, as well as the pallet breaking sound. I didn't clip it and they don't have vods enabled, but maybe I'll keep an eye on the stream and get a clip next time. Wasn't sure if that is even bannable but I guess it would be worth a try, definitely a bit of an unfair advantage
---
Exactly. The amount of times I‚Äôve seen Jasons spamming the stupid head punch kill is embarrassing. You shouldnt be able to just do the same fast kill 7 times. Its game breaking cause why do any other kill when this one is the fastest?
---
Press E to sneeze so hard the killer says bless you instead of hitting you.
---
Who has better perks, Steve or Nancy?
---
So i was playing a random doctor game. (Sorry it‚Äôs a photo btw.) and it did that glitch to where there were multiple killers. Me, the Doctor, and somebody else. The Spirit. There were three survivors and two disconnected. The Spirit Moried the last one. I disconnect from the match and....now I‚Äôm Micheal Myers. Confused? I am too.
---
Wait, they nerfed Thrilling Tremors?
---
i suck at chases, if i go for you, we both die.  it‚Äôs not always worth it
---
People never seem to cleanse my totems until they activate when I play spirit, even if they see them.
---
I think they always assume it's haunted grounds.
---
MoM was too dang strong. They need to fix it so ALL protection hits count, same for WGLF.
---
I'll take the downvotes. I'll never regret helping out my fellow "Sucks at where's Waldo" brothers.
---
I tried not running ruin on ghost face and 3 gens were done before I could make a sweep
---
I don‚Äôt know what happened, but during 2xbp queue times were so horrible like never before. Now I can find lobby as a killer in 30 seconds. Thanks BHVR, just on time.
---
Imagine bloodlusting that hard and still getting looped. Brain dead ghost face
---
Ahh yes, a spine grinding car worker... Let's make him tall, bing bong, and have perks that aren't even relevant to his lore
---
Facing 4 mom again? No thank you
---
Inner Strength is probably the best perk of the DLC and fixated is useful for beginners and possibly mind gaming, so I'd say Nancy. but it depends on your playstyle for the most part.
---
Fuck those immersed Claudettes
---
Oh no it was not i was just mistaken, sorry! Most perks with a cooldown are 60 seconds at lowest rank and 40 seconds at level 3...but thrilling tremors is 100/80/60 seconds...when I looked at the perk I thought that the cooldown just didn't get lower per a level....yikes that's rough...
---
Yup. I got 3 flashlights and a haddonfield offering against my level 1 myers. People seemed hell bent on stopping anyone from having fun this weekend. Meanwhile if i notice a match is going really bad for the survivors I'll stop playing seriously and let them know I'm farming. Sucks that almost no one seemed to do that.
---
Survivor was playing great for sure. I also see this as a killer and all I can think is. The killer messed up. Should have forced the pallet down faster. Should have broken it right away. If survivor makes it to another loop. Leave survivor and hunt for others. He stuck that out way too long. 
---
Again survivor played great.
---
The best thing to do in a situation should  never be considered toxic
---
I like running devour because of the times it does work out. I feel comfortable in my abilities to play well if its cleansed but when it survives its makes for fun games. But no I wouldnt recommend using it if you dont feel completely comfortable losing it 80% of the time.
---
I laughed before I even clicked the link because I knew what it would be. I was right watched the whole thing again and laughed so hard.
---
I'm new, how often do these events happen?
---
What do you think about Second Wind? I keep hearing is a bad perk but i don't understand why
---
I get solo survivor matches fast, probably a minute or less, and yesterday during bloodhunt I was getting games as killer in about 5 minutes. I kept track and it was around 5 minutes exactly for every match.
---
SWF lobbies are terrible though.
---
I think if there are actually 30 minute lobbies it might be something on your end, or a bug that affects a small number of players.
---
We need more Jeffs, so we can 4 man swf Jeff only.
---
you can literally use the memeless mode and stop being a negative nancy
---
Correct
---
Not everyone likes to play a game like you do, endlessly looping, flashing and bodyblocking the killer. It¬¥s annoying as fuck and I never do it as a survivor because I know how frustrating it is to the killer.
---
So yeah, I would probably let you die. You play the game like you want, if people want to play immersed and don¬¥t have the same idea of fun like you, they can do that too. 
---
You want similar-minded people, run a SWF. Randoms don¬¥t owe you anything.
---
All it there is is meme spam. I'd have to scroll past 10 posts to find something that isn't cancer.
---
If you like memes so much make your own sub for them.
---
It has been possible to transfer from PS3 to PS4, and cross saves between PS3/PS4/Vita are a thing, so the technology will likely exist for PS4 to PS5.
---
Now how bad will BHVR mess it up and cause people to lose data is the real question.
---
I really hope they do
---
Ive seen swf groups have a player instantly dc mid chase as their friend sits on the hatch in order to escape my spirit. They laugh, but I laugh as well lol
---
That's when he runs prayer beads and mither-daughter ring. Idk if the build would be the best without those add ons.
---
I was actually thinking about that. Sort of like if you had traps he placed on interactive items like lockers or generators. When the traps went off what would happen is his fear would go up a tier after a specific amount of trap triggers. I also thought of some kind of dash ability like when Pennywise is in Bill‚Äôs basement in the first movie
---
No wonder the groans sound similar
---
Hitboxes for the most part are fine. This is a ping issue. Learn the difference.
---
Aren‚Äôt you the guy who complained about memes last week?
---
This is the official sub. Memes have no place here.
---
The hatch spawn system is both a blessing and a curse how it currently is - and I‚Äôm saying this as a survivor main that plays both sides pretty evenly (I just like being chased more than chasing). I‚Äôve had teammates not even try to rescue because ‚ÄúWell hatch spawns if you die, so...‚Äù but I‚Äôve also been in situations where I did whatever gens *did* get done while my team was doing god knows what, only to be able to get out thanks to the new system. Yeah, I‚Äôve lost 4Ks to the new hatch system, but it feels better overall than the old system.
---
As far as the Adrenaline argument, I saw that coming a mile away. A survivor‚Äôs goal is to survive - getting those 5 gens done is part of their goal. If a survivor lasts that long, they‚Äôve typically earned it. While there are the rare cases of ‚ÄúDoing gens, you?‚Äù that exist and *do not* earn the health state + movement speed that it provides mid-chase, there have been plenty of situations where it has 100% been earned by the person using it. Personally, I think the speed boost is a bigger deal than the health state - sometimes that speed boost gives you just enough distance to make it to another loop/pallet/window where you can create enough distance between you and the killer to keep yourself up just a little longer. Is Adrenaline strong on a good survivor? Yeah, I‚Äôm not gonna tell you it isn‚Äôt. But again, part of Adrenaline‚Äôs condition is meeting a portion of the survival requirement - living to see 5 gens completed.
---
I do try to look at these things not only as a player, but as a game dev. I‚Äôm currently going to school for 3D modeling/animation, but one of my courses that I‚Äôm required to take is game design. We‚Äôre actually going over mechanic balancing this week and discussed mechanics last week. I understand that in an asymmetrical game it‚Äôs going to be hard to balance everything and please everyone, but I think it‚Äôs healthy to look at things that we consider a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù in the community as mechanics (NOED, Adrenaline, DS, etc) and try to come up with an alternative idea instead. This way it‚Äôs not just ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this‚Äù and it becomes ‚ÄúI believe this is unfair because x and I believe y would be a good change because z.‚Äù
---
As a survivor I kept having survivors insta dc when they got caught and the queue times seemed like the longest I have ever dealt with
---
Why? Obviously people like memes here, otherwise they wouldn¬¥t be upvoted constantly.
---
What do you want to discuss about this game? There isn¬¥t enough variation to talk seriously all the time, or do you want this to be a place for video highlights? 
---
Go make you serious DBD sub, you are the minority here.
---
Snuffed out because you'd see this along with a hidden killer offering every time
---
After battle pass, please daddy needs his grind.
---
Actually you know what maybe fix match making first.
---
All the people defending this shit, fuck that. I always try to save someone at the end if they‚Äôre not being camped. If I don‚Äôt have bt I‚Äôm probably going to leave you but you should always try to help your teammates. Being immersed doesn‚Äôt mean you just hide the whole game and don‚Äôt do shit it means you play more stealthy and focus on evading the killer. If you‚Äôre immersed you should still help your team and that‚Äôs that
---
I don't think ruin is a must. It definitely increases the chances of you getting the upper hand if it lasts, but I pretty much only run it with trapper so I have trap time. Other than that I believe you can be pretty successful without it. There isn't really a perk I hate just more perks that are useless.
---
For me I dont really have a perk to hate, however I fucking love Infectious Fright. Monitor and Abuse plus Infectious Fright is Distuging, increadbly no one runs Calm Spirit so this combination is even more broken.
---
Yeah, most those people play fortnite too. But that doesn't mean it's good.
---
Yeah what a fun counterplay wait by a locker for a minute
---
140 shouldnt feel this bad
---
IIRC they're looking at a Nurse add-on rework. But they haven't given specific timeframes.
---
Congratulations if you're fine with that then that's your prerogative most people aren't.
---
Just because you feel like it's fine to deal with doesn't mean that everybody is going to feel the same way there's a reason it got changed only because it's incredibly in balanced against the vast majority of the killer roster
---
I don't think you could probably buff that perk without reworking it first.
---
Either the conditions are too easy to obtain and makes it completely annoying for any killer who can't countering or the conditions are not worth it and it makes it very self-destructive for the survivors.
---
The Perk is basically a mini Legion situation you can't really buff or nerf without inconveniencing the other party it's going to have to get a rework
---
You have to get the ‚Äúmerciless killer‚Äù as your results! Essentially you have to double pip
---
It's exactly what it is. Brave of you to say this though lol
---
It's called balance.
---
That‚Äôs what I keep hearing; a big reason I decided to buy him actually
---
Pretty much yeah there's not much room for running different perks
---
How old are you? 
---
Grow up.
---
oh shit, thanks man. guess i‚Äôve been thinking of the adept trophies all wrong haha.
---
I played like 4 games during the event :D DBD gets so toxic during these events it's unreal. I don't care about BM but i *do* want bloodpoints so i just waited for the event to be over.
---
Hopefully we actually get stuff to confirm this with the Archives
---
they also buried Legacy Servers behind several menus and made a bunch of terrible balance changes to reduce the overall quality of the game
---
That looks fuckin rad dude
---
I was attempting to agree with a "yeah, I also would have like too have seen 'insert character here'. My bad totally, probably could have phrased it better.  I think I'm still floored they even managed the collaboration and some slight blood hunt fatigue slipping in.
---
At what checkpoint in your brain do you think 140 is at all good?
---
I had the time but most of it was queue times
---
ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
---
Thank god someone agrees.
---
I‚Äôd hate to be on a team with these other people
---
Huntress definitely puts me on edge with that lullaby
---
Don‚Äôt worry it used to be like that back in the days but they changed it when plague released? (don‚Äôt quote me on that)
---
Your completely fine man I get it no need to apologize!
---
You might wanna tell the mods that then because there are no rules saying memes aren't allowed. In fact, there is even a "shitpost/meme" flair.
---
A hour is exaggerating. I played some killer matches too and at most I had to wait was 10 minutes.
---
Nonetheless it's a dick move. Even when the killer had several options to go for someone else who was injured. Only one gen was done and ruin was still up too lol.
---
ahh alright. thanks again man
---
Yea an hour was a bit much but for me on xbox I had to wait at least 20 minutes a time
---
damn. well cant wait for deticated servers !
---
Demo in the distance sounds scary af it makes me feel antsy to see demogorgon. Also a tier 1 Myers is scary.
---
Iron grasp makes it so survivors struggling takes longer and has less effect on the killers directions
---
Claudettes final form
---
I destroyed the blood points to use the bloodpoints
---
I had 8 minute waits just to get into a lobby by myself. Took longer for 4 survivors. (PS4)
---
If that was an actual Spirit player, they‚Äôd all be dead the moment Jeff began to say the first word.
---
Use 100 sensitivity. I have no problem tracking my target or mind gaming. Or maybe you just need practice.
---
Leave Nancy outta this!! )':
---
Man how do you dodge those attacks? I never succeed in that.
---
Lmfao.
---
Exactly I try to avoid Demo at all costs
---
I had anxiety because of the EGC timer desync
---
Wait,the blood hunt had started before?WTF I DIDN‚ÄôT EVEN KNOW!
---
The irony isn't missed by me.
