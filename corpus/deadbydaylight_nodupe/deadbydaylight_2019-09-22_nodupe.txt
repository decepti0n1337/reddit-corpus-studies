Hooks repawn 3 minutes after being sabotoged. If someone dies on it, then it is gone forever unless the killer has hangman's trick.
---
---
---
It would be unfair to the survivors if they didn't also get a choice, I myself hate playing in all the indoor maps (especially Lerys &amp; the new underground lab) but it would never work to give everyone opportunities to veto maps
---
Yeah unfortunately I'm right there too and I can say with certainty that the higher I go the more tryhard players become and I'm just trying to have fun.
---
Cause you didn't specify which of her perks, so I saw an opportunity and took it
---
I'd say David or Jake
---
poor legion lmao
---
An important thing to remember is that each survivor has a different level of looping skill. It‚Äôs usually worth your time to just give up on a chase to go after someone who‚Äôs going to throw down every pallet instantly. Then after you catch them, the good looper has no pallets left to play and no options to get away
---
They tbag at the gate because they're cocky cause they won.
---
Bruhhhhhh
---
Killer: "How about the Morigue?"
---
You get points, and cockiness, especially if you play in a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù way
---
This is just my experience. Yesterday I went up against a bunch of rank 20s as well as people in the green, purple, and red ranks (matchmaking lmao). If I were to keep count, the higher level ranks definitely camped and tunneled more. Thankfully, I don't take that kinda stuff too seriously since it's all counterable. Glad to know you don't do that kinda stuff tho. Have a lovely day
---
you forgot Nea ):
---
I'm not changing your mind because I agree
---
Ok I‚Äôm just gonna go this is an old post now
---
In the end, you're looking to actually play the game so that's completely reasonable
---
Finally, a fellow intellectual
---
Nea x huntress. Just saying.
---
He sounds like the twinkiest twink moaning away at 12 inches of rough lovin'.
---
This or they're letting the killer get another hit for some free bloodpoints.
---
Bubba's gotta salt that meat somehow.
---
Survivor: What are you doing.
---

---
Legion: *leaping over pallet* MY BEST OKAY?!
---
Sneakiest entity.
---
true, some survivors were kind enough to do this. I felt very happy and wholesome :)
---
I don‚Äôt believe that a red rank killer would be camping, unless they got mugged off and teabagged. I doubt it and not believing your questionable statement .
---
Yeah Hag looks fun, but don't wanna risk losing the points I'm saving
---
heck yes
---
No homo
---
Tunneling is going for one survivor repeatedly after they're unhooked until you kill them. It's generally considered unsportsmanlike because that survivor's game gets ruined and he's just like cannonfodder for the team. Plus, in higher ranks there are lots of "anti-tunnel" perks that counter that strategy so you get hard punished for trying it.
---
This would become an absolute item for me. You'd get to get revenge on the obnoxious ass causing your team the match and establish a new level of dominance on killer by doing it yourself xD
---
Okay then. Have a nice day. :)
---
BHVR KEKW
---
That's not tunneling though, you're saying if other game actions occur you will leave to check those out. Tunnelling is like if you chose one survivor to follow and just would ignore other things going on around you, like gens or other survivors you run into during the chase, because you're only interested in the one survivor. Like when I run right up to the killer to get their interest off the player they've been chasing for 3 gens and they just completely ignore me, that's tunelling
---
Oh. Ok
---
My twitching seemed to work in my favor, too. I didn't avoid crows but I did avoid a Kar98 shot to the head lol
---
I like the crows and basement perk changes a lot. Although Whispers change I love, I do not think it needs a buff. That noed nerf really kind of kills it though.
---
I mean we all know this is a meme but insidious does kinda remove both of those things lmao. Survivors come to you and there‚Äôs no need to chase because they come to you
---
Well the thing is once one person cleanses we might as well all do so. Because if not we get one shotted from a distance and that‚Äôs never fun.
---
Clown is better anti-juke than Bubba...
---
Edit: a word.
---
Tunnelling is when a killer is just going after one survivor.  And for your question about tips watch streamers and how they play. But also learn loops so you know how to run them and play against them. Don‚Äôt drop pallets straight away. Use meta perks.
---
And if they run that add on where they see the aura of everyone who pukes its GG lol
---
You switched out insidious for knockout to take this pic, didn't you? Your secret is safe with me.
---
Oh my god finally someone else like plag
---
Help huntress I'm scared
---
Platform: PS4
---
Issue: game crash
---
Circumstances: Whenever I run dying light there seems to be a chance that whenever I hook a non obsession survivor the game will just crash right after hooking.
---
Maybe they have their profile on private because people like you always leave trash comments on their profile?
---
How would you even know they hacked it when their profile is on private?! That doesn't make any sense.
---
I feel like r/CursedCursedComments plays into this...
---
Personally I would replace NOED with Sloppy Butcher,but to each their own
---
Thanks
---
I guess World's #1 Mom is fair when she's the only mom in the world.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was about to say , they already have a metal version but it‚Äôs still pretty cool
---
How is Plague underrated?  She needs a nerf if anything, Corrupt Purge is bullshit.
---
IRON WILL is broken af
---
My meg won't stop making noise...
---
PC
---
If you close your eyes you can almost imagine that she's lifting weights.
---
I cant even describe like how perfect this image to represent that situation
---
[removed]
---
Adrenaline requires you to actively complete your objectives in order to use it. NOED enables a killer to be trash all game, get 0 hooks, hell they can just stand there and do nothing, but as soon as that NOED pops it's an instadown and a camp for a free and entirely undeserved kill. It's stupid.
---
Tanatphobia, ruin,dying light it brutal on her.
---
Also the add on that let's you see survivor's auras when they puke is amazing.
---
Healing someone is inevitable. Healing someone for a full health state isn't.
---
Second Wind is trash.
---
I love shaggy, but the killer is basically half freddy, with only the projection
---
Lmao if someone unhooks in front of me what should i do, commit to another 2 gen long chase or get another bbq?
---
I have no clue if this is true or not, but I think the reagents (increase or decrease the fog) do this too if there‚Äôs a clear reagent and a faint reagent
---
I agree with that. I'm just saying that it's cheating and scummy.
---
I think her only weakness is that she's constantly having to deal with something and there's no downtime to check generators. She's the killer I play when I get bored of Ghostface and it's pretty rough to try and keep map pressure, especially when nobody is cleansing
---
If they have TTV in their name, it's because they aren't recognizable yet. Most people wouldn't see No0b3, HybridPanda, or Otzdarva and think "oh gee wonder who that is", and those that aren't quite as popular, such as Farmer John and Demi, either prefer their anonymity to prevent harassment when trying to make content, or they're Demi, and they thrive off of the blissfully unaware. That being said, a lot of people who do have TTV in their name aren't that popular, which *also* means they don't subscribe to the primary Twitch method of getting famous, i.e. being a raging douchenozzle or arrogant Ninja wannabe, and are, as u/LtHoneybun mentioned, generally nicer or more forgiving players who are just themselves.
---
Seeing scratches isn't the problem. Seeing the difference between scratches here and scratches there is the issue. The higher contrast the scratches are, the easier it is to tell how they're fading and the easier it is to tell which way the survivor went.
---
Unfortunately, people feel better when there‚Äôs someone else to blame, and the fact that online gaming is mostly anonymous, they‚Äôre much more brave with being complete dicks. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Steve and Huntress can both be our mom this is 2019 man
---
¬®\*misses first hit and stuns itself\*
---
Is it wrong that I love Legion just for their music? Plus they've been amazing for me so far. Low level shit.
---
(They, her, his, hers, who knows? Gender neutral)
---
Feng has a perk called technician that is useful for new players learning to do gens. 
---
The survivors that tea bag are usually just bragging, you normally wouldn‚Äôt see it as much in your ranks since the survivors are typically a lot more scared when they start out but matchmaking is messed up right now. 
---
The best thing you can do is watch people play. I learned a lot from people like monto and otzdarva for playing killer efficiently and I watched a lot of people play survivor to understand how looping works and what safe pallets look like. Just takes practice. 
---
Good luck out there!
---
She is but she has a high skill ceiling so most people don't play her all that well.
---
I think it's fine until people start asserting it as headcanon. The Pig being some cute girl going "oink" is cool and all until people try and make her sympathetic and always let Pig players kill them or something...Amanda is a drug addict and a remorseless, fanatical killer, not a cutesy "oinker". Don't even get started on Myers.
---
I mean -10 is big in comparison to -1000, so sure, it's big
---
I‚Äôm not a douche or Ninja wannabe, I‚Äôm recognizable, and I‚Äôve never put TTV in my name. You‚Äôre making a huge generalization that all popular twitch streamers who never used TTV are douches. That‚Äôs shitty.
---
Iri wouldn't be nearly so sweaty and terrible if the hitboxes weren't more finicky than a non-Borderlands Gearbox game's controls.

---
Legion is definitely top 3 mori with Hag And Huntress ahead, just my opinion of course
---
I saw this in a other thread but the Devs should consider a music menu in the wait lobby so I can cycle through Halloween, Stranger things, and Legions unique lobby music even when I am not playing that chapters killer.
---
The survivors were complaining about the amount of grease they have in their hands which makes hook escapes ridiculously unfair
---
Ive yet to get to be a survivor against Freddy. Ive played against the Huntress, Darkness, Ghosr Face, Leather Face, the Clown, and all the basic killers. No Freddy. :(
---
Oh you‚Äôre right.
---
So many bugs since then update.
---
Joining a match with friends. We end up in different lobbies.
---
We end up having to reset the game because 
---
a) We get stuck on connecting
---
b) Ww get stuck on a loading screen going into a match or leaving a match.
---
One out of two matches will have Unknown error and we have to invite each other all over again.
---
Players who join the lobby or leave the  lobby don‚Äôt show as doing so.
---
Prompts don‚Äôt appear for healing and stuff.
---
We have a problem of some sort in most of our matches. It takes long enough trying to find a game without these problems.
---
Frustrated is an understatement.
---
trapper with decent clothes? impossible
---
Almost no loops?  Have you seen what balanced landing does on that map?
---
Fully sick survivors are broken and exhausted.
---
I love it.  Though i doubt Hannah Barbara would eant shaggy sacrificed constantly
---
Huntresses I agree is also really nice, it‚Äôs simple yet just stunning, but the Hag‚Äôs is only decent to me. nothing wrong with it, just not to my taste
---
This will make her top tier for sure, probably just above Myers.
---
Omg did you recently go against Otz demogorgon on auto haven wreckers?
---
Slow the game down
---
Em
---
Mine was a killer one too! It always gets rolled again to a killer one which sucks when I luck out to get anything survivor
---
I‚Äôm not defending anyone, just pointing out that you called out someone for something that you can‚Äôt do yourself, kid.
---
there is an obvious and definable difference between running in a circle, and manuevering a 360.  the key inputs are far more demanding, and the result is certainly not this. 
---
pulling off a 360 requires rotating your camera opposite of your characters model, and when done right, produces a genuine 360.
---
even if I did care about noob3, this is not a 360 and shouldnt be classified as such.
---
it almost definitely is, but he‚Äôs gotta have a reason to scream at us that‚Äôs a lot more dramatic than a thwack
---
I meant to put Stake our, and urban evasion can be used to quickly move around the map without scratch marks and if you accidentally fail a skill check you can rotate to a different area near by so that when the killer checks around the generator your stake out can activate a get a token. 
---
I do agree that 2 perks slots to counter the chance of a perk is awful.
---
Killers with "Easy" difficulty are almost always easier to learn. I'd main one of them until you learn about movement and other important killer skills
---
Are you wearing the scoops outfit? Its cursed take it off do the achievement then put it back on.
---
To be fair this post will be removed because it doesn't fit this subreddit. I agree with the legoyoda bit, however.
---
I do find myself running in that criss cross pattern or whatever you want to call it in other games
---
Attach cooldown
---
Survivors earn Adrenaline by living to the end, With NOED however a killer can literally stand in the corner of the map, face to the wall for 5 gens and still get the effect
---
 TL;DR Adrenaline you earn, NOED you're just given
---
idk pig is pretty scary from my expirence
---
Successful attack cooldown
---
Sometimes they're the only one you see.
---
I'm sure she is. Especially when you round the corner and suddenly "REEEEEEEEEE-"
---
Scoops = Death. I had a |Demogorgon trick me with unhooks to finish his Devour Hope and I got the sloppiest kiss ü§£
---
&gt; people like you always leave trash comments on their profile
---
I don't do that.
---
&gt; How would you even know they hacked it when their profile is on private
---
I don't. BHVR does. Better safe than sorry, if they hacked legacy, they probably did something else as well.
---
Red rank PC killer here...I tried playing killer on a PS4 and I couldn‚Äôt hit anything. Also easier for survivor to 180. Nothing exciting to see here. Noob3 is known for 360s but he just plays so much and understands all the tiles so well, he‚Äôs just a very good survivor.
---
your character stays at level 50, but more bloodwebs generate.
---
Yet you complain if you get tunneled and camped to stop it from going off.
---
To be fair, you could do just fine on survivor with zero perks lmao. But I get what you mean, assuming you are playing to win. Although BBQ is run solely for the BP, the secondary effect is nice but I would not run it wwithout the BP effect
---
I'm just picturing that framed like a horror movie. Get that spooky musical sting as the Killer suddenly notices you.
---
Steve Carell voice: Oh my god he's TUNNELLING!
---
Probably. I would love to see a reaction vid!
---
How is clown best dlc?
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Run Scoob could be balanced to work like a regular exhaustion perk. It would be on par with Sprint Burst, with a comparably balanced drawback.
---
Switcheroo would be funnier, more appropriate, and more balanced if it had a cooldown, but only teleported you to another locker within 8/10/12 meters.
---
Hex:KC should definitely work the opposite way, being boosted by uncleansed totems. Anything that incentivizes survivors to cleanse totems is a good thing. That's what NOED tries (and kinda sorta fails) to do.
---
Because everyone should be angry at someone constantly or you're playing the game wrong.
---

Curtain Call Chapter was the best one because we got a hot piece of ass AND Kate Denson.
---
Someone being nice to Billy? Apparently my notes are unusual. I've only gotten toxic players anytime I've lost with Billy.
---
Even without the BP effect BBQ is still really strong, 4 seconds seeing survivor auras 40m+ away enables you to get the next chase started almost instantly
---
It‚Äôs a hard one
---
This use to happen a lot before all the changes to pallet mechanics. 
---
Dumping a pallet on a killer and double sliding was like a big fuck you.
---
Yeah no doubt, but I would rather have enduring or something. I have been waiting for this Double BP Hunt for a while now.
---
Goddamn this is the worst for me.  As a survivor main, I keep getting put in matches with rank 20s (it's either 20s or red ranks, sometimes both)..and since ruin was in the shrine a couple weeks ago, every fucking killer is using it.  
---
So what happens?  Nobody does gens.  They all put themselves in struggle phase on the first hook.  Since they're potatoes, even if they attempt an unhook, they'll somehow die in the process.  
---
And I *know for a fact* I'm the only one who is even thinking about doing gens.  So fuck it, right?  I can either lobby dodge repeatedly or fucking go for altruism points, do some totems, and hope for a hatch.  
---
I've had so many games in the last few days that are doomed from the start, that it feels pointless even trying.
---
They have to be aware, considering their likenesses are being used.
---
Same energy
---
just get better at hitting great skill checks? or learn the totem spawns for maps and just go totem hunting. ruin is what it is, been in the game for years at this point and it's a necessary evil tbh
---
So now you no longer have to manually put survivors to sleep, it either happens automatically after a set amount of time or after you hit a survivor, survivors can wake themselves up in the same ways they could before, you have the power to teleport to any uncompleted generator and the cool down of this power is faster the more survivors are asleep, survivors can only interact with the dream pallets or dream snares if they are asleep, dream snares slow survivors down for a second and make them scream, giving away their position, and dream pallets are similar to the doctors fake pallets but the survivor won't know they're fake till they try to use it.
---
If you ask me it shouldn't even be a perk, but rather just the regular way it is. I mastered hitting ruin skill checks b4 I even hit red ranks. And I've seen many others say the same thing. I get that it would be rough on lower rank survivors but most of em can't hit a normal skill check till at least green ranks anyway. The game needs to start balancing towards the people who actually know how to play it instead of some shitty rank 10 who bought the game yesterday. Maybe if ruin was just a passive most killers would stop sweating their balls off because the match wouldn't be over instantly because they wanted to commit to a chase that wasn't ridiculously fast.
---
Never watched stranger things but if the characters look like the actors then they most likely would know since they'd have to okay their likeness being in the game, and they'd probably get paid for it too.
---
Basically everything. Not even joking
---
Is it the power or parts of the power you don‚Äôt understand?
---
There is so much you could gain from having never typed that
---
Well If you think about it clown is the best dlc, at least by perks. Pgtw is meta, bambozzle is very good for infinites, and clorophobia is trash. So 2 very good perks and 1 trash, while all other has all trash perks or 2/3 trash perks, except mb spirit.
---
Ruin/BBQ/Enduring/Spirit Fury. Seriously meta build lmao especially on Billy.
---
Gotta wave them over.
---
Yeah basically the power but if you could explain how the perks work too that would help
---
trapper is decent, leatherface is pretty simple, and possibly even clown
---
Ooofffff
---
He isn't very good with pressure though. I'd recommend billy.
---
It's a pretty big deviation when they're ALL 20. The high is important, but so is the average.
---
When people t-bag and say stuff like gg ez or trash baby killer/survivor it‚Äôs usually to compensate for their extremely below average sized penis
---
There are some times when you just have to take a step back and say, " what the actual fuck were they doing for the last 2 minutes?" The answer? Usually running or hiding for not one single reason.
---
Yes. Omg yes
---
I agree. Legion's mori actually has the survivor try to fight back, which makes it already a lot cooler then "Imma drag you about 2 feet then wack ya"
---
People can be super toxic. I recommend watching some Otz videos for a good sense of gameplay, and holding on to your better addons and offerings until you feel you can get your mileage out of them. People on forums tend to forget it's a very hard grind early on, so try to find your favorite Killer and get them online with a good loadout for some reliable BP income.
---
She gave you a free escape and you still bitch about it. That's why i play nurse and spirit and slug all the time.
---
What about killers using the same meta builds every game? Why not cry about that as well?
---
It's actually a wave. 20s are chill, getting more toxic up to green, then tapering to a low at purple before red is 50% sweaty and 50% chill.
---
Then maybe they could have it alternate each following day between a random killer challenge and a random survivor challenge? 
---
I just want survivor challenges to actually show up more frequently. Cause right now they don't.
---
Yes
---
No you wouldn't, last time queues took long but were balanced everybody complained about wait times, so your statement is objectively wrong with proof right in this subreddit.
---
Given how you'd need an actor's likeness to use it in a game, without a doubt they know.
---
Ayeeee we share a cake day my dude
---
Your internet speed has nothing to do with your latency to a server/client.

The signal won't/ can't travel faster no matter how much bandwith you have.
---
Ping is only reliant on distance to server/client.
---
So whoever says you need to upgrade your connection is just an ignorant fool.
---
Yeah, that's a good policy. I don't have time to be toxic, anyway, even though there are some people who probably should be camped. Gotta get that moral victory.
---
your style is lovely, hope i'll see more content from you!
---
Well if you really enjoy Insidious good for you, me on the other hand I'll chase down other Survivors to apply pressure. Good day to you :)
---
F**k you mate

It doesn't work on killers that have stealth abilities. Or phasing spirit I'm pretty sure.

Wait does that mean it‚Äôs my Reddit birthday

Adam for Deliverance

sadly, there aren't many survivors that their teachables are worth buying

Player retention immediately halves.
---
What‚Äôs the best killer to main? I‚Äôm having trouble choosing :(
---
I‚Äôd recommend wraith, he‚Äôs incredibly simple and the lack of heart beat when invisible is incredibly powerful at the low ranks.
---
I liked, put ruin, tanathophobia and dying light on top of that and you get the most annoying killer in the neighborhood
---
A day how?
---
I just begun too
---
Read in the tone of Thatcher.
---
Sounds like you could have got an easy down from the dude who sat and teabagged. Also seems like it was really early in the match. Some people just play how they play man try not to take it to heart.
---
Michael Myers' new mori, in which he just runs you over with a car.

I disagree,  I think in general it's a great perk choice for myers, ghost face,  trapper, wraith and leatherface as well. 
---
It's probably my favorite on ghost face actually.  It's hilarious to put someone into exposed then you chase after them at 130% speed
---
You dc'd for a wiggle free turned tbag? Such a damn crybaby. Killer main btw.
---
Sounds like a recipe for farming.
---
It‚Äôs all preference and what perks you want, but tbh the best survivor perks are on free survivors,  Which include Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Dead hard, and Borrowed time.   Whoever you want to play the most is who you should buy.  Adam definitely has fun perks like Deliverance and the pebble.

Sup
---
And then he also has infectious fright
---
The first matchmaking post I wont remove since it's a clever meme, nice

Legions one of if not the most hated killer so, expect toxicity.  SWF also like to tbag Cause they think it‚Äôs funny or something, so just ignore them.  Most people aren‚Äôt toxic like that
---
How about the fa and t that I'm a rank 1 survivor getting rank 20 killers on PS4 still.
---
I'm a PC player. I just can check their steam profiles (hours in game, achievements  etc). Most of good survivors have their steam profiles open.
---
Bro love just trying their best for legionü§£
---
I mean, UE only makes you walking speed. If you want to move quickly and not leave scratch marks, Fixated is better now.
---
Using daily rituals, bloodpoint offerings, playing Killer with BBQ. It‚Äôs really not that hard. If you play well as Killer you can get around 50k to 60k bloodpoints per match. You only need around 1.4 million bloodpoints to get a character to level 50.
---
No it is not. Same thing could be said about freddy teleporting back to a gen near a hooked survivor.
---
This made me ugly laugh.
---
Speed is an issue. I always have trouble catching survivors so probably that.
---
Ruin, yes, BBQ, no. The points are nice, but if I want to run something else that's off-meta, I'll 9/10 times drop BBQ and have probably the same level of success. Then again, I can go 40 bloodwebs without seeing either and have a bunch of useless perks (Took me 20 ranks to get Ruin on Huntress, while my Demogorgon got BBQ at Rank 1 and Enduring at Rank 20. ONLY KILLER I HAVE ENDURING ON THAT ISN'T BILLY OR NURSE. FUCKING. NURSE. IS THIS A JOKE, YOU SPINDLY FUCK?)
---
No, screw plague
---
lol no.
---
Many hours played=/=high skill level
---
Also bodyblocking etc. is Not "unfair".
---
Tze only Problem is the currently broken matchmaking
---
fun extra: he kept saying i had a small dick after calling me that lol,love the creativity. and thanks for explaining !
---
The huntress lullaby one honestly yes that one change were it doesn't tell the survivor it exist I just amazing 
---
Edit: Like how all the huntress perks are on here
---
Yeah I started playing Meyers last night and he‚Äôs really tough early on with no perks or add ons or anything. Guess I need to just stick with him though. 
---
Whispers rank 3 shows up after level 30?
---
Or a careless survivor triggering a hag tap
---
Spirit should be S. Because you know, S(pirit)
---
Maybe if you‚Äôre bad.
---
Same lol who likes short shorts
---
oh man this actually made sense to me haha, thanks !
---
Doesn't Freddy have a disgusting Iridescent add-on that prevents people from waking up from failed skillchecks?
---
How is mental deviation related to sexuality?
---
I'd buy Leatherface and practice with him. His base speed is pretty good, and if you charge up his chainsaw, he actually gets a boost in speed until the end of it. His chainsaw can also break through pallets like butter.
---
I'd scoop his ass anyday ;)
---
So In order to get reachable perks, do I have to level the bought survivor to level 30 for it to be available or can I just level up the character that I want and then they‚Äôll start appearing?
---
Reasons survivors linger at the exit gate:
---
* (Main reason) to ensure that everyone is ready to get out at the same time. You want to stick around in case you have to unhook someone or bodyblock for them as they run for the gate
---
* To let the killer get some free hit points on you
---
Reasons survivors tbag at the exit gate:
---
* Celebrating with the other survivors, assuming the killer is not nearby
---
* To BM the killer / be toxic that you won, assuming the killer is nearby / watching
---
So staying at the exit gate and tbagging at the exit gate are two different reasons. I *highly* recommend as survivor you don't leave until you're confident that the others can get out or otherwise if the killer pushes you out
---
except its really dumb to urban evasion around when the Killer isnt near and also, just use prove Thyself or Hit greates
---
Np. I'm not at all shocked by that. Naturally his next move after crying camper is to say you have a small dick lol
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty terrible rn
---
Plagues got 3 really good perks. Infectious fright is amazing,  corrupt intervention is really good on the slower killers like trapper hag and ghostface, and dark devotion is an absolute bitch with strong chase killers like nurse billy plague and clown
---
3xceot selfcare is useless lol
---
Nah. Reveal the Killer's aura for 4 seconds if he's WITHIN 32/36/40 meters. Flip that shit.
---
Oh yes. Gimme that salt.
---
No but you dced to get back at the survivors for being toxic.Two wrongs doesn't make a right
---
We need to make tier lost based on hit animations, basing it of of thier swing and cooldown animation, my #1 would be the pig, i just love the smooth slice and then showing it retract and go back for the cooldown
---
That‚Äôs a good point!
---
If you buy them, use them. Use it as an opportunity to learn your new characters. Suck it up.
---
Doesn't work with killers in stealth mode
---
I.E. it's main purpose
---
Doesn't work against stealth killers
---
Sorry fam theres no S(pirit) tier only S(usie). Shes D tier because shes d e a d
---
I suggest u play a simple M1 killer,  someone that doesn't require much precision like a hag,  she uses M1 to injure and down survivors, just use your trap near generators or put it beside hooked survivor. Another good reason to play hag is because she has a perk called "hex:Ruin" which slows the game down,  you can also put your trap at the totem so that you'll get notified when a survivor is gonna break it. The reason I didn't suggest trapper is because you have to go around the map and collect your trap,  but had can just draw them on the ground.  Even though I gave a little explanation of the hag,  I suggest you watch some videos about her like briky orkid's killer case file /fungoose educational videos on hag/noob 3 toxic killer series (hag). You can even use twitch to watch live streams about dbd, it is good to do that because u can ask a question right then and there if u want to know something,  I'd suggest you watch fungoose (yes he also has a twitch),  or even alexisplaying(no caps),  wildwes, Angel.
---
That would be hilarious i'm not against the idea even if Mcote is likely just joking around.
---
Question to add to his question. Is there a max devotion level?
---
Nah shelter woods sucks
---
Ok I actually laughed at that. I‚Äôd  give gold if I wasn‚Äôt poor
---
Most of them I bought so I could get their teachable perks, not because I have any desire to play them. Unfortunately that‚Äôs the pay to win style of the game. I totally get having rituals for characters whose blood webs you have started. But a level 1 with no blood web started should not be clouding up my rituals.
---
Pretty much not 100% accurate
---
They might add a traditional or ritual skin for Claudette
---
Some of the rituals are so easy to do, like get chased by the killer with a certain survivor and chase a survivor with a certain killer. Maybe learn to play with other killers and survivors.No one is forcing you to do the rituals.Either you do them or you delete them and get another one.
---
Omg same I had so much fun with those perks! i also use small game to synergize with inner strength &amp; head on
---
It took quite a bit to grind this out, but I've finally hit P3 on Steve. Now to grind even more to get my perks back!
---
I have a trans friend and honestly it‚Äôs non trans people that care the most about this stuff.
---
Came late to the party but I‚Äôll say it anyway
---
Hope &gt; Self-Care
---
He‚Äôs got the edgy teen persona, and his power pre patch was the most hated by far and it‚Äôs  stuck with him.  His power is still seen as annoying by a lot of survivors, when he‚Äôs not even close to the most annoying now.  I think they were just toxic to be toxic, you were right to DC
---
F in the chat for all the poor peeps in the world.
---
My favourite has to be the new 80‚Äôs vibe that plays with Demogorgon.
---
Hey, I got a question when it comes to hoodies and them being on the head, do you have a trick of any kind? I've tried to draw the legion gang and always mess up with hoodies
---
I always thought that only Doctor could use that perk. The more you know.
---
Oh look... more toxicity. How darling of you. Lol
---
I would suggest you watch more content about dbd first. Trsut me,  watching these content helped me so much. I can suggest some if u want,  just message me.
---
I got a game with 3 red rank survivors and a green rank.                         
---
I‚Äôm rank 15..
---
(Edit: Baed Spolleing)
---
Alternate NOED tweaks:
---
* It works like a regular Hex perk, being tied to a single totem, but that totem only lights up when it triggers.
---
* The speed boost is instead a 1% speed boost per remaining dull totem.
---
* The Exposed effect only lasts 60 seconds, but the speed boost remains.
---
* After it triggers, all survivors can see the totem's location for 10 seconds.
---
Indirect tweaks:
---
* Whenever a dull totem is cleansed, all survivors receive a notification, similar to the hex-cleansing notification.
---
* A survivor perk that, whenever you cleanse a totem, the aura of the totem furthest away from you is revealed to all survivors for 15 seconds. Also increases cleansing speed.
---
NOED's true purpose is to incentivize survivors to cleanse totems, to make the game more interesting for them, and slow the game down for the killer. But, because it's all-or-nothing, a lot of people don't bother. Most of these ideas try to address that.
---
Lithe, self care, borrowed time, decisive strike
---
You‚Äôre sleeping on Rin
---
It really is.
---
Patience and staying still does wonders :)
---
Teachables my guy are you new to the game
---
Nea main probs upset that shes bottom of list. Not my fault fam, she barely qualifies as a girl being the entity and all.
---
you're really out here arguing over what someone calls a 360...? they juked the killer by spinning, its close enough
---
I hope not shes rather pointy and sharp.
---
I agree!! I get the same 3 or 4 every time. I would love some variety.
---
People can absolutely play how they want to play. Just be accepting of the consequences. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è They aren't required to be nice. That's fine. But I'm also not required to sit there and take it. I can just go find another match to play.
---
#1 for me has to be either Freddy or Trapper.
---
No, it just never really crossed my mind I suppose.
---
PS4 is literally unplayable /s
---
Rank 1 both sides ps4 pleb here
---
You're the first person I've seen on this sub to post that they have P3 Steve, all the other posts I saw were either Nancy's or Demogorgons so congrats? I don't know how to feel about Steves prestige I mean it's pretty simple(like all the prestiges but more so) besides the blood atleast looking a little darkish? It just seems eh with Ashes it  had chunkier blood while Steves more liquidly
---
Yeah but the one guy was literally letting you hit them. You seem to be a bit over-sensitive here.
---
Myers is definitely more Sp00p than Ghostface 0/10 false advertisement
---
I wonder why you separate mind and sexuality. Sexual desires are in your mind, whether those fit the norm or not, thus deviating.
---
I know it has a bad reputation but so far people have been nice. Probably it gets problematic in higher ranks. So be it, no game is perfect.
---
Same here.
---
Left behind is a William Bill Overbeck teachable, you can let other survivor learn that perk by leveling William.  Next time you don't have to ask people and wait for answers,  they have a Wikipedia of their own.  Just search dbd Wikipedia and go to their official one, you'll find a lot of useful info there
---
Play nurse
---
Funny thing is that I've been encountering a lot of prestiged Nancy's in my game but I've never seen a prestiged Steve besides myself. Guess everyone's focused on her for her perks.
---
No.
---
People complain about DBD not being scary but are trying to get rid of the truly horrifying stuff like this, smh
---
/s
---
That's gonna be some nice chilly
---
This is faith.
---
The propherchy is fulfilled.
---
BRING IT BACK!!!
---
GF should be best tebagger
---
I suggest you either deal with it, keep looping until you can bait them to pull it down, but don't get stunned, you need to back off from the pallet once u made them think they have to drop it. Once they drop the pallet you need to see if the pallet is worth mind gaming or not,  if it is, don't break it, if it isn't, break it. That or you can just play ranged survivor like huntress or plague or even clown if u know your stuff
---
Oh I absolutely get the hate pre patch but now? He's not as bad. Lol I wouldn't say that I was even right to d/c. We were both wrong in the situation. I just don't like how toxic some survivors can be. I usually just play my matches and move on.
---
Yea basically, ive only seen a few Steves and only 1 Prestiged 1 Steve besides that it's just Nancy mania and for the demogorgon I haven't even seen him yet but I've only seen bloody versions from screenshots, guess the demogorgon isn't everyone's cup of tea(for me he is though got him P2 and the prestige weapon blend in seamlessly with the body)
---
Trying to beat stressing myself out in the game is my main focus right now. My heart starts pounding whenever that cat perk lights up. This was a huge proof of how being calm is the way to go.
---
Once you see it ...
---
Again... I never said it was right. Lol I'm trying go figure out how in my post you got that I felt I was right. I even said that I know it's not the best thing to do.
---
Nah it's more so a meme from what I've seen, like oh it's a scoops ahoy why not Mori him for shit n giggles
---
I suggest u level up David aswell for the bloodpints,  but after that u would suggest Adam Francis, he has a perk called deliverance,  you can go to dbd official Wikipedia to learn more about the perk
---
Also when the killers leave you lose your offering
---
Normally I'm so tired of matchmaking posts... But yes, this one is ridiculous. Haha. Not even close. üòÇ
---
DCing definitely isn't worse. They're equal. They're both shitty things to do. Lol
---
Killer weak, Survivor strong. pls nerf.
---
I think SB and UE are nice, agree on the others
---
plague is my fav, she is definitely underrated
---
Added you!
---
I'm sorry sir but that is not a *feel*, that was a *penetration*
---
Cue the toxic ass "lol noob" message
---
Every time I play Legion my lobbies look like this and I get like 1 maybe 2 kills, then the survivors have to be toxic as fuck and message me.
---
Seriously. You dc because of a tbag....grow tf up.
---
I know what will be a good counter argument!  Buzzwords!
---
Thank you.
---
You should show Tony Hawk answering back, because he does.
---
Cool down
---
Actually no. It was on the new map, he went to high ground, and landed on top of some boxes to teabag. By the time I would've given chase he would've had ample time to jump off the boxes and get away. There was no free hit to be had. Let's not make assumptions here.
---
I found this out an embarrassingly short time ago, tbh...so I was one of the n00bz suiciding myself on traps.
---
Ruin and BBQ are very easily countered, though. Not really comparable.
---
No it's nea x entity
---
He actually replied https://twitter.com/tonyhawk/status/1175219399583649792?s=21
---
Holy crap, I never thought I'd meet another one of my kind.. this is awesome
---
Nah i just dont understand how people think that playing with your friends is unfun. Pretty stupid if you ask me. If SWF wasnt in the game, the game would be dead. A solo survivor is the worst experience in this game.
---
üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ Riiiiigggghhhhtttt but the people being toxic and teabagging don't have to grow up? Again hypocrisy.
---
DELET THIS
---
Personally I'd switch LF and Freddy.
---
I actually love both of these perks. I don‚Äôt run them often because I‚Äôm stuck in my ways but if I‚Äôm having a horrible night with ruin I‚Äôll throw stake out on and I do a  ‚Äúfake out build‚Äù with iron will, urban and diversion and it works a lot after pallet stubs/DS/just randomly.  They‚Äôre just FUN to use if you‚Äôre not looking to be sweaty/using meta perks. 
---
That‚Äôs why I play with Head On a lot. I just like to do new things
---
Legions c teir?
---
I know that feeling is the best! There were once a leatherface that camped me with insidious and I had kindred on,  the other survivor gen rushed and got out. The killer then asks (after the game),  "why didn't u save him u heartless peoples", I then told him to look at my perks, after a Few second he left and said nothing üòÇ
---
Lol as if you put that info in your original post. I guarantee those survivors have already forgotten about the match and here you are an hour later still bitching about it. That one dude is right you really are a fucking crybaby.
---
Are there any dates the devs release a BH event or are they all random (I assume near halloween is one, but could be wrong)? I've had to miss out on the last 3 BHs because of my work schedule or family emergency.
---
I play exclusively solo killer and survivor and enjoy both.  It‚Äôs far worse to get hanged up on in what should be the role exerting pressure, and not the other way around.  I have much less fun going against SWF than I do as a solo survivor.
---
That 625 doesn't really matter though.
---
If the survivor DCed then it was most likely because he was losing, so the killer still lost more BP than the quitter bonus.
---
If the killer quits then everyone gets 5k BP doesn't it?
---
If you think someone hitting crouch a couple times is as bad as ending the and robbing everyone in it of points/pips they earned/could‚Äôve earned, you really need to question whether multiplayer gaming is for you
---
He's a killer and the chase music is Superman by Goldfinger.
---
Wtf? Dwight should be S.
---
I‚Äôm the red one,  rank 18 killer had the four survivors combined to be rank 17.
---
Myers and doctor is nice and cute on the inside, I like them.
---
.....they are just tbagging. Nothing toxic about it. The messages afterwards were. The dc was.
---
I still dont see why you wouldnt want to play with friends. Its just a chill time. DBD is only competitive if you make it.
---
DCing as killer is the ultimate F-U. If you wanted to respond to toxic behavior, you could‚Äôve proxy camped them for easy downs or something. Seems like an overreaction to me.
---
Lmao how am I whining? People are writing to me and I'm responding? Am I suppose to not respond in a discussion. What fuck are you smoking? Idk how responding to people and opening discussion counts as whining. Fuck outta here. Lol
---
Theres a tutorial that u can play?!
---
Please just let me hit you before you go through ;-;
---
if the survivor can see over the top, just follow them until it gets dropped. if they can‚Äôt see you, try some mind games. you can learn these from some streamers and youtubers like truetalent and otzdarva. they‚Äôre real good teachers for that stuff
---
They're not exhausted are they??
---
I see a lot of survs that still can dh after fully broken
---
I‚Äôve been running into similar issues post-update. I found restarting my PS4 did the trick for a decent enough time.
---
It's a hard-knock life for us.
---
Currently no.
---
Unless there is an add on for that :/
---
Why is trapper up there when he just slaps em a few times
---
Oh god. Protect the sweetest babies.
---
I feel you OP, it's the same weirdoes that always ship random characters in shows.  Can't they just watch porn like a normal person?
---
Because it‚Äôs ostensibly a horror game.  I want it to feel tense and scary if I‚Äôm a survivor.  Having only nonverbal communication aids in that.  Everything is fun with friends, but if I want to just shit around with buds there are tons more games far better suited to it that even have voice coms built in.  I‚Äôm fine with SWF but it should be built in to KYF only.  Play with your friends with that, but in proper lobbies I shouldn‚Äôt have to be an unwilling participant in someone else‚Äôs bro time.
---
You got me there.
---
rip julie
---
I just fucking gagged
---
Iiiiii'm saaailing awaaaaay
---
I was going to add pants but I didn't. I'm not good enough to add a penis so I just put CENSORED. If someone is good enough at drawing penises to make a new version that has a penis that would be the best
---
Gotcha! Ty for the info I thought it was all locked out and I‚Äôm ready before I find a lobby so didn‚Äôt know
---
You can listen to the music you want and then switch to the killer your playing at the last second
---
All of them were on the same gen and I hit 3 of them and she t-bagged me at a pallet so toxicity?
---
Hag is so underrated
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Can do
---
Also I meant if not is at the start sorry
---
Had a game against the legion earlier and me and a Dwight finished banging that bitch out (the gen) while we had are deep wound meters ticking away and meg was looping in between us at the killer shack and the small boat on the swamp, it was intense but we got it and all escaped!
---
Thank god, I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
"I‚Äôm not gonna hurt ya, I‚Äôm just going to bash your fucking brains in"
---
Or it explodes 3 times as the killer approach‚Äôs and all 3 of us are trying to peel off it!
---
Proxy camping is basically an effort to bait an unhook so you can immediately go after (tunnel) the unhooked survivor. You patrol the area, but really all you are doing is watching the hook the whole time.
---
They haven‚Äôt implemented to the stealth killers, right now it only works on demogorgon coming out of portals and Freddy in the dream world
---
Ps4 for life my dude
---
Must be a xbox1 player lol
---
Spirit is the only one viable for the 4k on red ranks on console. I love to play Huntress and Hag but it's so fucking hard because of gen rush.
---
when michael has max pwyf, noed and tier 3 bloodlust.
---
You‚Äôd hope so, but you‚Äôd be wrong
---
Obviously. They would also be getting paid. That‚Äôs why the DLC is more expensive, there are more mouths to feed so to speak.
---
It actually is. At least for most of the builds.
---
But the hellish build is following:
---
Add on to not wake up on skill checks
---
Add on to suffer higher penalty while missing skill-check
---
Dream snares (to place next to totems and use notify option)
---
Hex:Ruin, Hex:Lullaby, Make your Choice, Pop goes the weasel
---
Enjoy hell on earth. Do not use TP for map pressure much, only for MYC and protecting totems at all costs. They will do no gens....
---
That's what people used to say about Hag, but in present-day now, who says it? So no, it's not camping, no need to fear.
---
Lol it has to be, he is the #1 most played killer on Xbox! The devs dropped all that info in are Laps just before spring this year...
---
I hate this ranking system. It punishes you for not playing the game religiously. I‚Äôve been a Rank 1 Meyers, there is no reason to drop me down to Rank 16 because I took some time off. Makes it not fun to jump back into when you know it‚Äôs just gonna be a slaughter because you‚Äôre not in your proper skill rank.
---
whats the significance of the transgender part
---
We're Gonna Live Forever, Borrowed Time, Prove Thyself, and a 4th perk of your choice, I like Iron Will, Balanced Landing, Bond, Poised, and Alert.
---
It is a BP farming build though, not a survival build :P
---
I really hope the community is nice to this post
---
This reminds me of a dream I had one time where I was playing as the new DbD killer, who was called the Driver. His power was that he had a van and would just run you the fuck over. Instead of carrying you to the hooks, he'd just pile you into the back (multiple survivors at a time) and you couldn't wiggle out.
---
I still lost on Coldwind tho
---
Not Sprint Burst. Lithe, Balanced or Dead Hard are all way above SB.
---
It‚Äôs not my post
---
Hmmm doesn‚Äôt mention no discrimination bc of rank or skill level ü§îü§î lol I‚Äôm kidding srry
---
i have been playing this game since it came out, there was never a killer strike lmao
---
OMG! HER FACE LMAO! THIS IS WHY I MAIN KATE
---
HAG IS EW?? ;-; she's a cutie pie.
---
I'm not a killer main, this is just an alternative mechanic to hooking. Survivors can be saved by allies just like a hook, and if you get rescued before 80 seconds (an entire hook stage equivalent) then besides being exposed and slowed, you're better off than you would be hooked.   
---
Anyone who gets left in a freezer for 8 minutes is being abandoned by their team and would have died on a hook anyway.   
---
I'm not sure if you just didn't read the part about the victim being savable or what, but being frozen is arguably preferable to being hooked if a member of your team gets to you soon enough.
---
When your mom is coming up the stairs to beat your ass for a bad grade but she falls and fucking dies
---
It isn't tunneling, and I'll tell you why. 
---
First, it gives information. If the unhooked player has borrowed time, it is important to know this from a strategy standpoint.
---
Second, hitting that player either results in the player being downed or borrowed time being triggered. Either scenario results in lost time for at least one, possibly two or more survivors. Either the one player must mend from borrowed time and then heal as well, or the downed player must recover and/or be recovered by a teammate. 
---
What unhooking right in front of the killer is, in reality, is selfishness on the part of the unhooker in not performing a safer unhook. Whether this is because they are farming unhook points with WGTLF, or if they simply lack the skill, there's only two excuses to push for an unhook right in front of the killer - to prevent a transition to second phase (still risky) or to prevent a struggling survivor from the final death moment (meaning any delay results in death).
---
The problem is, survivors have been conditioned by a rather toxic atmosphere to believe that it is the killers fault that they have to make an unsafe rescue. This mindset has resulted in survivors not developing better tactics, and instead simply blaming the killer and often chastising them post game with the silly term "tunneler".
---
The only time this term should be used is if the killer willfully ignores all other gameplay aspects in order to down and kill a single survivor - appropriately living up to the source of the name, "tunnel vision".
---
She has one of the lowest skill ceilings, as her power isn't that complex. And because she is so short with high mobility, there are some filthy combos you can pull off.
---
Tasty
---
lol just love the survivor mains downvoting but not posting. ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
---
Chill dud i was joking I was hoping people could tell I knew he was being sarcastic
---
How would you fix them?
---
I understand and think they‚Äôre advantageous. But you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to run those perks all the time.
---
Yeah, length playing =/= play time.  Been playing since launch but barely have 1000 hours. I've gotten flamed for being a hacked legacy more than a few times cuz I'm still trash at the game.
---
But couldn‚Äôt all relatively experienced survival methods be considered tough on people who don‚Äôt know how to play killer very well? That‚Äôs sort of what separates experienced players from inexperienced ones, and yeah, playing with people on a much higher level can really suck (especially if they‚Äôre being d-bags about it) but I‚Äôm not sure that constitutes ‚Äúbullying‚Äù.  Same as meta-perks: they can make it borderline unfair if you‚Äôre playing against someone who is new or not very good - but that‚Äôs any game. 
---
And this is coming from a killer-main. I‚Äôd definitely rather be blinded for a few seconds than infinitely looped around a bad spot on the map.
---
The game right now is kinda crap... I'm rank 3 survivor at the moment and I'm getting matched with grey ranks killers. I had a game yesterday against a rank 20 Nurse that wasn't blinking at all and thought she could get us by simply walking. I had to kill myself on endgame collapse because I felt really bad.
---
Also had another game against a rank 18 Demogorgon that was clearly a Stranger Things fan and was just starting to play dbd. He wasn't placing portals and shredding and he swung at every pallet. 
---
BHVR need to do something about this because new players are coming massively with this chapter and by matching them against experienced playing, they simply don't want to play the game anymore.
---
Insidious would be pretty bad with this. Once someone is in the freezer, Bubba's TR is locked to 16 meters, Insidious or no Insidious.
---
"respected" this guy is funny.
---
For real fam? She straight up looks like https://i.imgtc.ws/Nh55bgn.png
---
I've gotten flamed a few times over being a hacked legacy, mostly in post-game chat. I guess it's because I still play like trash after 3 years and only 1000 hours.
---
Achievement checks are the way to go if you suspect someone of being a hacker.
---
It was an unintended bonus of making you faster while shredding. They nerfed that in legion as well
---
I guess I didn‚Äôt assume that this would trump insidious
---
Which is a misnomer. The survivors should be more introspective and realize that they are the ones creating the scenario by farming a teammate who has no control over whether they are rescued safely or not. If survivors instead learned to bait a chase so a survivor could be successfully and safely unhooked, this would elevate the game as a whole and result in less toxicity between the two sides.
---
"Once upon a toxic" is a YouTube series of doing adepts. Noob3 if you're curious.
---
Considering how the subreddit violently disagrees with people who go against headcanon, there is a sort of forcing on that part.
---
"Boosted" instantly dc'd, resulting in "Omega" and "Aaron" leaving. I'm not shaming these guys for leaving, but my problem is with myself losing a pip.
---
How come when two of my teammates leave, and 1 lets themselves die on first hook, am I not even given a safety pip? Why am I instantly punished by ranking down, because of my team leaving?
---
There should be a system in place where if half my team dc's, I should be given a safety pip. It's stupid how I have to suffer cause 1 person didn't want to face a ghost face, so now I'm screwed.
---
Because usually people will sit and self care instead of getting saves and that leads to people getting to struggle first hook and snowballing the game cause you'd rather sloppy self care instead of just going for the save. Just bring a medkit.
---
oh my god who gives a fuck. there isn't an official dead by daylight terminology book. its not that big of a deal if someone calls something thats similar to a 360 a 360. theres zero reason for arguing it
---
You lose 2 pips if you DC as a killer.  You also lose your offering and addons.  So what exactly are you talking about again?
---
If you wana see a more pro lvl check Tru3. Oh boy...
---
I miss when I first got the game. When it felt like you were really hiding and trying to escape from an actual unstoppable killer. God that was great
---
You need to heal a full health state of other survivor; be hooked; be unhooked or unhooking yourself and then the perk activates.
---
The first one is by a survivor main asking for ridiculous demands, I think you may have misread that one
---
We need dead by daylight cart race
---
Ehh dont care about him, i prefer otz, hybrid and monto for wholesome content.
---
And Monto does adept series too, without being toxic
---
tbh seems fucked either way. The biggest part that sucks about losing a survivor isn't the loss of alturism, it's losing a teammate that would otherwise buy time, even if that time was just them being taken to a hook to die. You get a gold benevolence emblem just for safely unhooking and healing a single teammate, it's by far the easiest emblem to earn,one more safe unhook or two more heals and it's an iridescent.. What really hurts is the time lost for powering gens, the higher likely hood to be the next one in chase hurting your unbroken, as well as obviously making escaping much less likely since you realistically won't have time to power all the gens if someone quits early.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Like if somebody DCS I probably still get an iridescent benevolence emblem. It's the other emblems that I'll stuggle to earn.
---
right back at you ;) they never said they were 360ing specifically. they were comparing themselves to him because they did a juke in general (one that noob3 also does)
---
But why would you waste a mori on them? Those things are a.) Expensive, and b.) Best used while farming for DCs on Nurse.
---
Feels bad man but I don't think this is the right place for those posts. You have a thread for that.
---
Understandable. I was just explaining that he wasn't calling you toxic.
---
I typically like where I‚Äôm at, no real interest in moving up and not enough skill if I wanted to. With this wonky match making I‚Äôve been getting paired with red ranks and it seems like the level of salt doesn‚Äôt offset the skill difference. 
---
Red ranks complaining about bad teammates when they‚Äôve got brown rank teammates... Sorry I haven‚Äôt dedicated my life to DBD and you‚Äôre only leaving the trial with 17k BP, my man, I hope you find someway to make it through the rest of your day!
---
Yes, everybody knows that the matchmaking right now is broken, even the devs, no need to make a thread about it
---
I love it. Not as much as Catharsis Hag, but I love it.

Down one person, hook them, and then steamroll with instant teleports from across the map.
---
I love when people say [OC]. Literally text, over an image with a shitty cropped face.
---
You are asking alot of this incredibly toxic community sadly
---
Got a rank 20 ace in my lobby who had the no exit glitch, they didn't know how to handle it (running off the match and looking for hatch) and died. Really makes people want to keep playing this shit, huh?
---
People who get offended by tbagging aren't mature enough to understand that it is just pixels moving up and down in a video game
---
Completely forgot you can check achievements to see if someone hacked or not, I don't get why people think legacy= skill also sure it may be a rare cosmetic that you got for playing the game early but I mean people take breaks, play for fun and don't care or are just simply bad
---
Ill hold back. Just for you.
---
Because they are?
---
Laurie should be higher
---
Fuck huntress. Kill everyone else.
---
Actually it‚Äôs not when you think about it. The goal for a killer is to stop the survivors from doing gens. If you keep going after the same person over and over then that leaves 3 people unbothered doing gens. If you go after the healthy survivor instead of the injured that means someone has to heal the injured and you‚Äôre chasing a person. So because you went after the healthy one 3 people are occupied doing something rather than gens shill if you went after the tunneled you would only occupy one.
---
It's not about what it is. It's about what it's supposed to mean.
---
no dude this game isn't about having fun. iM tHe KiLLeR bRo iM SuPPosED to KiLL idIot
---
I have a dildo shaped like the trappers pain flail.
---
he's right, fuck spirit
---
Playe trahps. Trahps make pple sloe.
---
It's the intent behind those pixels tho. If your activity making fun of your teammates, that's a sick move. Also for those who make fun of killers. We're all just trying to enjoy the game but sometimes the community makes us wonder why we even play. It's an immensely fun game but God the community sucks
---
I'm not sure skill checks count toward the progress.
---
That!...is a good point.
---
You be ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
So me and my friend was casually playing dbd but when we went to exit the gate the game didn't allow him to leave. He could run through the exit and roam freely bugging out of the map without the escape screen.
---
I know, I‚Äôm rank 10 and keep getting rank 2 survivors
---
They haven't a single clue. We must keep it this way. The Demogorgon did make a tweet that made him seem like he knows, but I don't think they do.
---
Finally an offering worth using
---
Would survivors still get shitty BP or lose pips because they didn‚Äôt escape? It‚Äôs already annoying to be the gen jockey and get shit-all for your efforts because you ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt do some of everything.‚Äù 
---
If I have to run around the map the entire game looking for hidden parts I‚Äôm going to be really irritated.
---
Use huntress &gt;:)
---
Yeah, people‚Äôs tolerances for that type of stuff ranges. I just don‚Äôt think people using their experience or ‚Äúskills‚Äù they‚Äôve developed by playing, qualifies as bullying. 
---
Like the teabagging/waving/taunting thing - yeah, I‚Äôm going to do that to bait a killer so that my teammates can heal or do gens. I‚Äôm going to pallet stun and loop them (if possible) for that same reason. I‚Äôm going to body block the killer to give my team mate time to wiggle free or get through the exit gates. Those are aspects of the game and when they happened to me, I‚Äôd be frustrated, but only because they‚Äôre winning - not because it‚Äôs unfair or humiliating to me. Killers can avoid/ignore a majority of that stuff. 
---
Everyone‚Äôs different, though. It‚Äôs cool to get annoyed with it. But if it‚Äôs helping them survive, don‚Äôt take it so personal. It‚Äôs a game, after all.
---
pallets dont get destroyed by sliding over them, only killers can break them
---
well I just got 2 downvotes
---
But if the killer doesn‚Äôt break the pallet and it‚Äôs buying the other survivors time to do gens/unhook/heal, why would it be toxic?
---
EDIT: Listen, I‚Äôm a killer-main. So I get the frustration when it comes to playing against either A) red ranks, or B) cunts. But taunting is legit in a game like this. When I play survivor, you can bet I‚Äôll be taunting the killer into a loop if I can. You can bet I‚Äôll try to get him into a chase to buy my team mates time. And when I‚Äôm back to Billy, you can bet I‚Äôll proxy camp a player who was rubbing in his ability in my face a little too much. It‚Äôs just a game.
---
I honestly feel that demo is one of the most balanced characters in the game.
---
I farted.
---
Typical logic of a bad survivor.
---
What a bunch of babies, if you get triggered by jumping pixels you deserve it all
---
Mine is Shape‚Äôs tier 3 stabby stab, so satisfying.

This is micheal escaping the entities realm to track down that one legacy claud who tbagged him milennia ago

Leatherface‚Äôs is the literal noise of his chainsaw.

Up until the Clown everyone had the same theme; Michael played a bit of the Halloween theme but that was it
---
Thanks! I was so confused
---
Seems you might have been victim of a little progress lost
---
This would be very cool. As a killer main I can agree this would be a high tier killer.
---
lol this ghostface is a frickin cutie. that spinny happy tbag!!! he was so excited :,)
---
Cooldown between hits.

Can‚Äôt spirit go faster than billy with add9ns?

---
This showed up on my home page but I'm not in this community??
---
I'm still gonna hit that Bill every time, otherwise the Claudette is gonna get points for a safe rescue.  If you don't like being put on the hook after you get farmed, take it out on the cro magnons that are farming you.  That being said, I'm also gonna tunnel the shit out of the Claudette after I get the Bill back on the hook, because she deserves it.
---
I respect MCote with my life
---
I know how it feels man. When I decimate people or stay slightly close to a hooked survivor when BBQ reveals no one. everyone comments on my profile the same stuff every time. Because thats what makes people sleep well at night.
---
Poor lad? She was being absolute cunt as usual. Don't feel bad.
---
that's my hope. I wanted it to be super powerful but with the echo-location to balance it out. High learning curve for high reward.
---
So im tunneling for always running into the unhooked one by accident?
---
Am I the only one who hates the prestige weapons? The thick blood/organ lines just look silly to me
---
This is the kind of game you get on any platform
---
I thought this was only on console sorry
---
That we do
---
That‚Äôs pretty hilarious
---
Or you know get a new controller that works properly instead of asking the developers to remake the game for you because you are too cheap to buy a new controller.
---
Yo
---
But does survivor dress like Buddy Holly?
---
The map has more debris than an abandoned house in Detroit.
---
You‚Äôre going to get a WIDE range of opinions on this one, lol. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you the ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù way to play. As long as you aren‚Äôt being a straight up dique - do you. 
---
That said, I main Billy, and I‚Äôll do either depending on the game. If I know I‚Äôm playing a group where all 3 survivors are coming to save this mf, I might stick around a little. If I know they‚Äôre further away (BBQ and Chili), then I fly over there. If I don‚Äôt know where tf anyone is, I try to be less-campy and continue hunting. But don‚Äôt let anyone tell you to never proxy camp - if the survivors are going to run like chickens without their heads around the hook, then slay them all.
---
Modern day Sir Lancelot
---
Teabagging and making another player mad isn't trying to help fucking survive at all! It's literally just making the killers angrier just because they're not as skilled as you. What part about that helps you at all besides pleases your sadistic nature?
---
The plague really is underrated
---
Please tell me he let you leave lmao.
---
He looks tasty okay
---
Legion on all platforms and switch is getting DBD soon and then a mobile version as well.
---
ok off topic, but that nea hair is literally the ugliest thing in the whole entire game
---
I haven't had any crashes when not playing dying light, but have has crashes on legion and Myers while running it
---
It's every platform. (Sorry for the hurtful comments!)
---
Generally you want to hook and leave to stop the rest from doing gens. This game isn't meant to have everyone die on first hook. If you stick around the hooked person, good players will pick up on that and run back to gens and do them since you aren't going to stop them (especially if they're playing with friends). Don't be scared of letting people get unhooked if it means you are stopping them from doing their objective.
---
That being said, if you have suspicions that someone is around, you may of course scout the area to see if you can catch someone out. Just be aware you lose points for staying close to a hooked person when no one else is around
---
I did use a first-aid kit...  Maybe that's why?
---
It's just awful when you play your heart out against a killer and are having a really great game only for the killer to dc. I don't care how salty I might get, I don't dc as killer cause then I just wasted everyone's time including my own.
---
This is me except I'm glad because it's the only decent way to get bp
---
I can see freddy, but why trapper, his is kinda bland, swing then wipe it off
---
what
---
How is that being entitled? I'm using tbagging to play with the killers emotions so that I can try to escape easier.
---
Dude Faze txes was in your lobby I never new faze had a dbd team that‚Äôs like so Epic Gucci
---
How do you people remember things like this
---
Dwight is perfectly accurate.
---
What would DS do?
---
You don't want to argue your point because you don't like it when people think differently than you do. People are allowed to have their own opinions. If you don't like that, you should find (or even create) a subreddit with people with the same exact opinions as you and ban people who don't agree. Either that or find friends who agree with you.
---
Julie would have some Evanescence.
---
Suzie I feel would have something like Rabbit Junk or some kind of tech metal

Joey would have like....Ffdp probs

Frank would have Ice nine kills. He seems like that kind of dude

I'm not too sure how I feel about multiple killers that you can switch back and forth through. Although, it wouldn't be a bad idea for Springtrap/Purple Guy to be the killer by himself since he's the only one of the Fnaf crew who was truly messed up in the head and purposely murdered people. I have a bit of an idea for how his power can be like to hopefully keep it true to the licensed character.
---
Here's the idea: This power is going to be a few things, I'll list them below so that I don't cram everything together.
---
**Ability 1**: Jumpscare/pounce: Springtrap can activate stealth mode thus giving him 0 terror radius until he deactivates it (meaning he chooses to go out of it) or when he pounces. When Springtrap pounces and he connects with a survivor, he and the survivor will struggle with each other and in order for the survivor to get Springtrap off of them, they will be given a skillcheck (the size of the Decisive Strike skillcheck) that will appear on a random part of the screen and if they succeed the skillcheck they will break free and Springtrap will be stunned for 3 seconds. However, if the survivor misses the skillcheck, then that survivor will be instantly put into the dying state.
---
So if you think about it, this will work kind of like the doors in Fnaf where you have to press a button to close the doors and keep the animatronics away, only now in DBD, you have to succeed a skillcheck in order to keep the animatronics away.
---
As a bonus to this first ability, when Springtrap pounces, he will make the noise that Purple Guy made when he tore apart the animatronics in Fnaf 3 after you completed each night.
---
**Ability 2**: Security Cameras: Springtrap is given 5 security cameras that he can place in high or low areas. Once a camera is placed down, Springtrap is now given a new ability that let's him see through each of the cameras that he placed down for 4 seconds and possibly catch the survivors on camera and know their location. Survivors are able to indicate when you're looking through a camera because a light coming from the camera will shine down on the area that's under surveillance for 4 seconds. Survivors can also disable your cameras and the disable process takes about as long as it takes to cleanse a totem. Springtrap is able to replace security cameras that have been disabled.
---
So this one should be obvious, in every Fnaf game you're given security cameras to look through to catch the animatronics on camera to be aware of your own safety, but this time in DBD, the killer is given security cameras to look through and catch the survivors to hunt them down.
---
**Ability 3**: Animatronic Head: Springtrap is given 4 animatronic heads. Springtrap is able to place these animatronic heads on downed survivors. When this head is on a survivor, their walking and running speed is considerably slower until it is removed from them. In order to remove the animatronic head from their head they are given 5 attempts to take it off and one of those 5 attempts will get you out of it, but the attempt that gets you out is completely random.
---
Again, as most of us know, when you die in each Fnaf game you are forcefully stuffed into an animatronic suit, this kind of works like that because when you go into the dying state you have the head put on you, only it doesn't kill you it just makes it very difficult to run away from Springtrap.
---
**Bonus Ideas -**
---
**Killer Weapon**: A fire ax. (Since Springtrap/Purple Guy most likely died in the fire that burned down the location in Fnaf 3, it would be fitting for him. Plus it's probably what he used to kill the 5 kids and stuff them into the animatronic suits.
---
**New Survivor**: Not really sure on this one since the security guards in Fnaf 1 and 2 got fired, the security guard in Fnaf 3 ended up jobless because his workplace burned down, and the kid you played as in Fnaf 4 and the technician you played as in Fnaf Sister Location both died, plus nobody's faces are ever revealed. But I guess I'll stick to the original guy from Fnaf 1 as the survivor, Mike Schmitt.
---
**New Map**: Imma go a bit out there on this one and combine all the locations from each game as one big map. Since every location you play on in the Fnaf series is small, just one wouldn't work and things like the generators and hooks couldn't be placed in good areas. So all the maps combined could expand both the horror and the props such as generators, hooks, chests, totems, etc.
---
But yea, here you go, I have just given you a lot LOT more than just a killer concept. I hope it looks good :)
---
Let's get an f in the chat for wraith. Somebody had to be f tier man.
---
It would look great if the penis was uncensored
---
Not sure if this was my group of friends but we did do the exact same thing, we named it "Map Roulette" and we pretty much used it as an excuse to get rid of our offerings we didn't want.
---
I was just saying something completely ignorant like you did.  Im not asking they change the entire game I‚Äôm asking they add something similar to dead zones to the game. This isn‚Äôt a problem for my controller since other games aren‚Äôt as sensitive when it comes to moving around. Also a lot of other games have dead zones. This is not specific to me on top of that, I‚Äôm sure many others have issues with dbd‚Äôs strict movement system. If you think that that the game shouldn‚Äôt add features that improve the experience for players then I feel sorry for you.
---
Lol imagine playing him on Larry's
---
But why him? :( F
---
It's not that at all. I just thought that what I was saying made sense. It didn't and I accepted that. That's all.
---
Top of best boi list and top of A tier for best girls
---
Dunno the entity works in mysterious ways
---
Because you're being rude to players because they're not as good as you. Instead of just keeping to your objective you actively make them feel crappy by bullying them into making the game easier for you. Playing mind games is one thing. Being an asshole is complete other. Let the noobs learn without being a dick to them.
---
2019 and worrying about ranks
---
Everything you‚Äôre saying is super situational. First of all you‚Äôre assuming everyone is SWF. Second of all you‚Äôre assuming you‚Äôll always spawn right on top of a survivor. Third of all you‚Äôre assuming everyone goes down within thirty seconds of a chase. Fourth of all you‚Äôre assuming the survivors are farming. Fifth of all you‚Äôre assuming you have a mori. Sixth of all you‚Äôre assuming they will 3 gen themselves. Also Legion and Plague are killers that barely get used and if you try to say otherwise then you‚Äôre being ignorant.
---
Platform: All
---
Hair model are messed up for all survivors and killers. 
---
Some can be quite bad like Jake's beard only showing on half of his face and his hair covering half his face. 
---
On others, it looks like they have uneven cut on the front or back. A good example is Spirit's new hair. 
---
Characters with longer hair often lose their hair when carried by killers or on the hook.
---
Hey guys my controller is clearly broken, please change the game so i dont have to buy a new one thanks bye. Thats what you sound like and you should feel stupid.
---
Username checks out
---
[Reminds me of this classic, when Marth's depip squad (all rank 1) depipped a rank 19 killer to rank 20.](https://www.twitch.tv/marth/clip/FunnyPrettySoybeanRalpherZ)
---
‚Äútrying their best‚Äù lmaoo
---
I fought a Rank 20 Nurse yesterday who went the whole Trial without injuring a single one of us.
---
It felt bad. We have them props for not D/Cing and shared some tips/tricks.
---
When I'm in the comments and theres no story
---
F
---
Its barely broken and its only apparent in dbd. Its not my problem, its a problem with the game. Not sure whats so hard to understand about that.
---
That's not it at all. I thought that what I said was right, it wasn't, and I accepted it. Btw, accepting it did kind of reduce stress. Somehow.
---
This. I cant even play survivor anymore without it with all that grunting and crying. Iron will is top tier.
---
The killer is decently fun, but he's pretty fiddly. Portals only give detection when they've been used and can be closed, so they're a bit finnickey to balance between stealthily using them and using them accurately.
---
His shred ability is a solid gap closer, and works well on loops with long sides, however it is a straight-line attack and that comes with issues of accuracy and ease to dodge.
---
He's probably low high tier, or high mid tier. He has map control/movement through portals, but they can be dismantled quickly, leaving you to run long distances if you don't have another nearby, and once you reach the maximum you cannot place another until one is destroyed. His pounce is decent in a chase but nowhere near as strong as something like Billy or Huntress' abilities which don't get punished as hard and have better control.
---
&gt; Barely broken and its not my problem
---
Im sure the devs will change the whole game and work for hours just so you can use your broken controller instead of your cheap ass buying a new controller. Good luck buddy.
---
Putting Best DLC for clown because Kates the best part mmhmm
---
He‚Äôs gotta finish typing a salty story that nobody in this sub even wants to read.
---
We get it. The Survivors were mean. Report/Block them and keep playing.
---
I didn't make the meme. I just thought the second part of it was funny.
---
Oof
---
I don't know who TF this Kate person is. I bought this shit for dat clown.
---
Me after double bloodpoint weekend
---
I'm not good at knowing if something is sarcastic/a joke or not. I try to pay attention but I am fucking stupid.
---
Yeah, I got hate for being a ‚Äúcamper‚Äù for some reason.
---
If you hate the game and developers so much, why are you even playing?
---
They have done SO much in the past 6 months for Game Health/Playerbase Health. We didn‚Äôt use to have Support Tickets, all we had was a useless in-game  ‚Äúreport‚Äù that did nothing.
---
Just because BHVR isn‚Äôt banning these people **right away** to make you feel better, doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt do anything.
---
I‚Äôm willing to bet money you came here and posted this story immediately, and didn‚Äôt even file a Support Ticket on their website.
---
You can run whispers to find them and if you think that they go to lockers then you can try to use iron maiden. That's the only way i can think of to counter that.
---
Daddy david is a top tho
---
I've genuinely never encountered a bug, besides annoying lag
---
Probably not, its like a 5% regression if you miss it, if anything they will fix this bug and thats about it, its decent in some builds, especially on doc if they have you in tier 2, then the skillcheck can be anywhere on the screen so it could be extra difficult to hit.
---
Be grateful hes in A tier
---
Me neither. In fact, I didn't know if you saying "calm down" was sarcastic or not. I didn't say anything about it because I didn't wanna look dumber than I must already look right now-
---
shining. shining... shining? THE SHINING DLC!?
---
Dude lmao how old are you? ‚ÄúIM THE BIGGER MAN, IM NOT GONNA RESPOND, I WIN‚Äù
---
Okay. Have fun getting your post deleted and acting like a smug child. Keep being salty over one game.
---
Jesus fuck. I've been meaning to get him to P1 after using all my offerings.
---
Will admit Steve's Prestige actually looks really good.
---
Frank would love some oldschool A7X; Buried Alive, Nightmare, Scream, Hail to the King, Sidewinder, Natural Born Killer, ect
---
10 meters really is not big in this game, it would make big structures a nightmare to play against, plus the sprint would already not be too strong in such places unless it has a very fast startup
---
The demogorgon is one kinky freak
---
It's awful that BHVR still allows these BS to happen.
---
We're going to lose these new players as fast as we got them. Way to make their first time unpleasant.
---
My 3 mains all on top, aw yeah
---
Nancy
---
‚ÄúProxy camping‚Äù - what people say when the killer stays in the vicinity of a hook. Not as annoying as face camping, but you‚Äôll definitely rile some feathers. 
---
Just have to take it by game. Some survivors won‚Äôt give a shit about their team or will see you staying close by and bust out gens. In that case, staying by a hook is detrimental and it‚Äôd be more ideal to go hunt them down (thus taking more people out of the gen-doing process). Other times they‚Äôll rush the hooked person and give themselves up, you‚Äôd be crazy to leave for the sake of sportsmanship. It is what it is, play however you want. 
---
Does playing a face/proxy camper get annoying? Yeah it does, which is why some survivors will get super annoyed and they‚Äôll flame you. But if that‚Äôs how they want to play, then just gen-rush them or frustrate them in the litany of other ways there are to frustrate a killer. No harm, no foul.
---
It emotionally mind games players who think that tbagging is toxic. A player who doesn't believe it's toxic will not  get mad and will play like normally. A player who does believe it's toxic will get mad and try to kill the tbagger no matter what.
---
He‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs trash at nurse, so everyone should get on and take advantage of him, lol.
---
Yeah I should have been running whispers. I actually took it off two matches before hand to try out devour hope. Regretting that so much now.
---
I can't tell if this is a threat or not... :s
---
You must be new
---
so you ran around a killer around for 11 min and only got 3k points? ok bucko
---
Want me to send the video to the game?
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
Looks over at a hiding claudette not knowing she is visible on one side
---
yes
---
It‚Äôs 100% about keeping an eye out for the distorted aura. He‚Äôll still sneak up on you every now and again anyway, but after that he‚Äôs just like any other killer. Get him in a chase, he‚Äôs nothing special.
---
I forgot to write it (I plan it all in Google docs first), but the sprint takes half a second to charge base
---
Okay give me a minute
---
More respected than reddit user royce16.
---
And the numbers could all be changed if this was real in a PTB. The hardest part is not being able to test things
---
Nobody is dumb unless they think they are smarter than everyone else in the world.
---
was this on xbox?
---
A Claudette
---
One thing that barely gets said enough. If your team DCs and you want out, just walk up to the killer and prime your butthole. The killer, on the other hand, has to play the remainder of the game irrelevant of DCs. The amount of times I'm stuck with some awful 2/3 man matches after the first DC, where it's fun for neither side and I'm not interested in spending the next 15 minutes farming.
---
I tend to find people become a lot more immersed once the first DC drops. It only goes downhill from there.
---
This issue is one that ain't gonna get fixed even with dedicated servers.
---
it‚Äôs a new patch so like bugs will happen. just play for fun or play killer
---
Uhhh, I have never lost a pip when the killer leaves before.
---
Deliverance still seems to randomly fail. Sometimes 1 unhook attempt will fail and the next will get you free, sometimes all attempts fail and you go to struggle phase.
---
So because it's the unhooker's fault, the killer should be punished by either getting looped or getting blamed for "tunneling"? Seems legit.
---
Dude! I really hope we get tony as a survivor! That would be fucking sweet
---
I play as spirit and I think the ONLY nerf she needs, is that she basically goes deaf during her phase. Can't hear survivors working on gens, healing or breathing. Sooooo many times I've gotten free hits on survivors because they're too loud. Besides, she'd still be playable with that single change. She can still see some scratchmarks, still see grass shuffle, she'd be fine like this.
---
one bug every 20-30? lucky!
---
Just don't get hit 4head smh my head
---
A camping Leatherface
---
He should be SS shirtless with the black hat
---
I love the Iron Will and Resilience combo, bring in both and drop self care.
---
I like how he was just like
---
"Nya hah! Hah hah! haha-  
---
.....fair enough"
---
300 hours
---
and that's how i met your mother.
---
Except Amanda is an adult and Chucky is a knee high doll.... more believable the Amanda is given strength. Even with a lot of strength Chucky still can't reach. Maybe the entity can provide him with a step ladder though.
---
Take it easy, Masturbation Man
---
I have this problem where my character gets suck on objects while in a chase or stops running all together
---
It is open source, but it's under an open source "copy left" license, meaning if DBD uses the content that either the DLC or DBD would also need to be open source and use the same license.
---
There are ways around it, but none that are realistic
---
I'd be so up for that NGL. That hotel would be the best map, hedgemaze included ;)
---
As a survivor who often got camped and tunnelled, I really don't get Killer x Survivor pairing. Even if it's just for fun or headcanon, it's such a turn off to me.
---
I've had my share of abusive relationships in RL though so those likely affect how I see this kind of unbalanced pairing.
---
Did you even read my post?
---
I've spotted No0b3's perk set, great Easter egg!
---
Always facecamp and tunnel
---
Game is sorely lacking objectives.
---
Bandaid solution.
---
YES üëèüèªYESüëèüèªYESSüëèüèª
---
Lucky you. I experience a game without a bug maybe once every 20-30 games!
---
There is a norm in sexual desires which goes for procreation (as all living beings), obviously known as "straight". If someone's desires go out of that way, it means that those are deviating from the norm. And as such desires are in your mind, thus mental deviation. Nothing complicated.
---
I mean that being gay isnt "normal" or "great" and shouldn't be encouraged/praised. I will be exaggerating now, but you wont say "its great to be necrophile" or something. I wonder why exactly of all strong deviations gay is so uhhh encouraged (?), and if there's a need for this stuff outside obvious respect and fair treatment.
---
Its kinda hard for me to form my message in English, I hope you'll understand my point.

lol that scream at the end

That moment when people get wet for a fuckin blue corpse
---
Nea IS the entity
---
SO TRUE
---
if you have consistently bad internet you just don‚Äôt start lobbies as killer at all
---
As a legion main you are wrong, huntress is a 12000% killer
---
Yup!
---
did this happen yesterday
---
It might‚Äôve actually no
---
I dont have consistently bad internet. It has just been bad for the past like two days, idk why
---
Well he's not really a teen to be fair, he's old enough to be a respected journalist so he's probably at least 25 to 30. Still I doubt he'd couple up with some weird floating bunch of body parts

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d7m9tu/quit_teabagging_and_taunting_the_killer_when/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

"Looping is an exploit"

Don't forget Devour Hope's haste after hooking a survivor!

"Don't get caught? Gee, why didn't I think of that?"

*WAKE ME UP*

Ngl hes kinda ugly
---
I'm not sure why you're being so nasty about this post but it is crappy and extremely toxic for them to do this. If he had d/ced then everyone would be calling him a jerk for d/cing. If YOU don't care about him posting it then cool, move along. But you're acting like this is a personal attack the way you're bashing this guys post.
---
I know this is a stretch, but is it installed on the same drive as your OS? I typically install my games on another internal drive including this one. But after a few patches ago, my game started running like shit and I moved it over to my internal drive and it runs perfectly again. 
---
Also, if you getting 90fps then you've applied those tweaks, have to tried rolling them back to see if you at least get 60fps?
---
Does the penis also open up like his other head?
---
Hates and feared by ~~baby~~ survs
---
Yes, just good stuff all around if you‚Äôre a fan of the game.
---
Then we would have the moonwalking bloodhound legion back. As a legion main I would hate to see that come back.
---
Ruin is literally a coin toss, that's the nature of the perk and it's not like that's unknown
---
It's fine. I lashed out at people for a long time before I realized what it was I needed to fix. I'm not offended. Tired? Yeah. But that's from a whole bunch of shit. This is just the cherry on the sundae that ended up with me having a ptsd episode and busting open my eyebrow.
---
pretty demoralizing to have it gone so fast and then gens start popping left and right
---
don‚Äôt tell anyone i said this, but i cry a little when i‚Äôm forced to go to the game.
---
Multi-Form is kinda op if you ask me, Relentless is kinda just bad, if by kills you mean moris, since speeding them up isn't really useful and they would look really weird sped up. Armor is actually alright if you mean it protects shit like ruin or other hexes, but not really worth it. Not trying to shit on your ideas, I think they're actually pretty cool and unique, just giving my opinion on them realistically. The killer idea itself it's pretty cool too.
---
The people who work on the chapters have nothing to do with game fixes, those are 2 different teams. So it wouldn't change anything.
---
The OS is not installed on the same drive as my game, just checked it.
---
My game is, just like I said before, stuck at a constant 10-15 FPS even with the settings brought down as much as possibile.
---
I rolled back to the settings I had before and It's making it worse.
---
Alright, he deserves the hatch.
---
Wow, what a piece of shit. There‚Äôs a lot of toxicity in this game, OP. I think it‚Äôs funny how this clown thinks that just because he has a high rank that he‚Äôs top dog.
---
Okay but how often are you matched with people your ranks???
---
A Susie main
---
Even outside of the hellscape of mashups on r/smashbrosultimate, the mashups still come
---
Wait who is that? Am I supposed to know him?
---
No
---
&gt;not bad for a kid from small town, Indiana
---
"We obviously won't add kids to dbd"  -devs
---
Haha
---
Nice concept and there is a cult following we can absorb with this
---
He was quoting a line the dumb head  of the mental hospital said to Loomis
---
Sorry, I've just seen the movie over twenty times
---
I fucking hate hag and you made it worse
---
Pretty often. I am at rank 3 as a survivor and get matched with red rank killers but yeah sometimes there is a purple rank survivor.
---
Hey thanks fo the telling me and thanks for the combos :)
---
Especially playing demogorgon, Devs need to fix ASAP
---
Sure, why don‚Äôt you screenshot the next lobby you get into, even better record you loading into a non swf lobby
---
Where did you see that? I don't think you can see who leaves because of that.
---
Interesting
---
Meanwhile all the red rank players are depipping bc every game is a rank 20 killer and we can‚Äôt do nearly enough to pip in a game
---
"maybe someone 'round here has been giving him lessons"
---
Some people would really kill themselves for hatch huh
---
Nice
---
Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt expect this behavior from what I‚Äôd consider a more casual game. But I was wrong.
---
What do you mean by top speed?
---
Okay I guess. It's 7:55 am where I am so you'll have to wait a bit.
---
It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll wake up when it‚Äôs night for you so you got like all day, which should be a problem if you were gonna play anyway
---
pretty sure
---
that's more than adequate internet speed to play killer without issues
---
sometimes net issues happen, it's not due to your speeds though
---
Wouldnt have happened with Bubba!
---
I would increase the charge speed and the reduce the stun to three seconds
---
Frank can hook me any day.. cutest killer ever
---
Thats y u play a chainsaw boi so u can facecamp 1 guy in games like that
---
Dude I would give my left nut for Ruin to last 5 minutes every game.  Jesus, just having it last 3 minutes is a rarity nowadays.  There's not enough spawn points and survivors have a lot of them memorized.  Plus 4 people can cover a huge chunk of the map.  IMO totems shouldn't make noise either - not like they're too hard to find anyways.
---
Those pants need more blood
---
Thanks a ton!
---
I fucking doubt it
---
You should play Demogorgon - you can actually defend your totem if it doesn't explode in the first 20 seconds.  So what I mean is you can defend your totem half the time.
---
Was tony in a horror movie or game? Or are they just asking because it‚Äôs tony fucking hawk
---
I got downvoted once for saying that Amanda had a boyfriend in the movies because a thread of people were going on about how she had to be a lesbian because of the boots she wears or something lol
---
Crying in the corner
---
There‚Äôs no rules you‚Äôre supposed to follow just play the game as you like. He could just let you go if he wanted too. Neither of you were required to act in a particular way.
---
There are some, stranger things, going on here
---
Not sure, but he sounds like a bit off an arse
---
I want her as a Killer with Sue Snell or Tommy as survivor.... Heck how about Chris as survivor so we have an evil survivor for the first time.
---
I like Neas with Flashlights as killer.  They waste a massive amount of time trying to get flashlight saves (which are pretty trivial to avoid 99% of the time) and they are easy to spot.  Nancy on the other hand starts with busted AF Inner Strength.  
---
Nancy is the worst.  No mercy for Nancies.
---
I'm a killer main, and I gotta say, we should give leaving bonus to survivors. And increase the one for killers as it is not the same as the amount of bp the survivor could have generated
---
Why in the world did they remove this? It was such a nice QoL change and they remove it? Smh.
---
I have a Saint Bernard, and they are the height of a refrigerator when they stand with 2 legs. I think hooking can be possible,
---
I don‚Äôt know if this guy knows what three genning is. It‚Äôs usually something a killer does when they purposely try and make the last three gens in one side of the map. So this guy is probably an idiot.
---
She killed innocent people including a teacher who is nice to her
---
Why the hell he hit you instead of picking the Laurie up is beyond me
---
Yeah I don't like how much noise he makes by default.  I get him being all stompy but does he have to make so many little noises all the time?  
---
The new map is the same way - it's SO DAMN NOISY.  Every 2 feet there's some door or whatever making a shitload of noise.  You'd think they'd play their own game and realize how much of a problem it is when you can't hear shit but oh well.
---
As yes, the dumb ass killer main who thinks every survivor has to follow his rules because he's the killer. This ass is why we killer mains look bad sometimes
---
..
---
Best fan-made perks I have seen tbh
---
Nice! I too got a perfect game when I got my Adept Demogorgon.
---
Hey there's three of us now!
---
Get fios, 500 up and 500 down peasant
---
You will be executed for your treatment of best boi Demogorgon, he doesn't deserve to be put in the same tier as a horrifyingly scarred monster and a well-dressed dream demon
---
The entity promised her with a New book of Misery Chastain for every survivor she kills.
---
And the blendette who spent 20 mins in a bush is a pussy
---
Seeing as she isnt an emaciated corpse, a fucked up cannibal, or riddled with disease I think shes in a good spot.
---
I thought it was legit than I read the description and I was like yummy
---
They chose to ignore them over time because of people constantly reporting people for the pettiest, minuscule things, or for things that didn‚Äôt count as reportable, like Camping/Tunneling/etc.
---
In BHVRs words, ‚Äúwe found that Players enjoy games that they win.‚Äù So because of all the salty Survivors/Killers angry over a bad match, it‚Äôs hard to keep tabs on legit reports.
---
The Support Ticket exists online off their website because most people mad over something petty like this usually won‚Äôt take the effort to make the report, whereas people reporting Hackers/Exploiters will take the time, because they will most likely always end in a ban and removal of the offending player.
---
Toxicity happens in every game. Just because you can‚Äôt point fingers and tell on mommy to remove them from the game right away doesn‚Äôt mean BHVR does a bad job. It sucks and it‚Äôs super annoying, but literally all you need to do is block them, report them if necessary, and move on.
---
Making salty ‚ÄúGUESS WHAT HAPPENED TODAY GUYS‚Äù posts doesn‚Äôt do anything. All these people are doing is venting into the open void of this SubReddit. We aren‚Äôt therapists and we don‚Äôt care.
---
learning a killers worst map can help you get better at that killer tho
---
I mean at least with the killer d/c we still get the points we earned now before we got nothing but like 200 points, I joined a game and the killer immediately d/c and I got 5000 blood points, they are finally doing God‚Äôs work in that department
---
Legion, post-nerf, is largely considered booty. Him, Plague, Clown, and Doctor are all relatively rare in my experience. 
---
Nurse too, but it‚Äôs not because she‚Äôs low tier. She‚Äôs just hard to use, but savage when used correctly.
---
Agreed
---
I see plague, clown and doctor all the time. And yeah I've heard Nurse is a mixed bag but performs best on PC due to mouse controls.
---
but it's also an option for points
---
Ya my comment was pretty accurate huh? But people like u are the reason this game gets bad cosmetics nonstop xP just sayin
---
Well then.
---
Toxicity happens in literally every single game.
---
Does it suck? Yes. Is it annoying? Hell yes.
---
Does venting emptily on Reddit like we‚Äôre supposed to care about another dime-a-dozen ‚ÄúToxic Survivor/Killer‚Äù story help anything? No. We aren‚Äôt therapists. Block/Report the offending players, and move on.
---
If you sort by New on this SubReddit, you will see a thread like this literally almost every half hour. Venting to a bunch of strangers like we‚Äôre supposed to be your Therapist doesn‚Äôt help anyone except the tilted OP. I bet you money the OP doesn‚Äôt even care about this anymore now that he got it out of his system.
---
Is someone being toxic? Block/Report them. Move on. It‚Äôs just a fucking video game, if it‚Äôs making you this upset, stop playing for a while.
---
You forgot the /s
---
How dare you put doggos any where other than SS tier, all doggos are the bestest of bois
---
Truly all the motivation she would need!
---
Mine is doing terrible freezes and lagging. Never had this before. Almost can't play.
---
I wish there was a replay feature so I can see what the fuck these people are doing while I get chased for 5 minutes, when I get downed I‚Äôll usually see at least 2 teammates dicking around
---
Oh, yeah? Are you on PC? 
---
I play on PS4 - don‚Äôt get too many of those. I‚Äôd say majority are Myers, Trapper, Hag, and Ghostface. I also player Hillbilly most of the time, so it could be that. But yeah, Legion has been nerfed so that‚Äôs probably why. He‚Äôs also not that fun to use IYAM.
---
First off, u have to not suck.  Second off, you have to RESPECT SPINECHILL. If u dont respect it, u might as well not have it. 
---
You use common sense to know where killer is coming from, retreat to border wall for example.
---
You dont need alert, you dont need bond/empathy, you dont need dark sense.  Do the fucking gen.  If it flashes hes chasing. If its solid for 1 sec , walk away.
---
Well.. if you got three gened, it‚Äôs you own fault :) just think more about the map, and try to make sure the center gens get done, and you don‚Äôt end up with three close together.
---
He just played fine, seems you all did too, beside what gens you decided to work on, and what ones you finished.
---
and if the killer forced you into having these three gens left, he played really well, and you fell right In the trap
---
Personally, I say "fuck your rules" and don't care about em.
---
Me: what?
---
Im literally shaking and crying rn
---
Nah I'm on ps4 but I keep hearing horror stories of PC nurse. My pc is too stupid for gaming lol
---
Ah yes this gives me inner peace
---
I'm getting freezes too. It's unplayable at this point.
---
Hoping to find a fix soon
---
She could have been going to let you crawl out, I do this as killer alot
---
This just started in the last few days.
---
I think it was his impatience that caused him to keep messing up
---
He's just bad. I play him to farm BP or when I'm just messing around and don't want to go for ranks. When I'm just playing to have fun he's actually fun to use and I can ignore all the annoying things about using him because those 4 man stab streaks are so satisfying, but if I ever try to actually win with him I just get bullied because he's so bad.
---
Mobile suck, I have two shit ass memes gold
---
Thats why.
---
IT needs to be a full heal no speeding up stuff
---
stop using bbq and ruin then
---
You know it's bad when the killer is the one being bullied
---
Type of Bug: In-Game
---
Every time I‚Äôve been playing Demogorgon there‚Äôs been a lot of frame rate issues where suddenly it‚Äôll skip a bunch of frames.
---
Gimme da T I T Y
---
Inner Strength is not as good as you think it is. Just bringing a medkit allows you to heal yourself much faster than finding a totem, doing that totem, then going to a locker and waiting in it for 8 seconds. That whole process is easily over 40 seconds and takes a perk slot, while medkits do not. You might as well just bring Self Care if you want to waste a perk slot, but a good medkit can heal yourself in less than 14 seconds and 2-3 times.
---
Second Wind, while not easy to pull off, I agree, has a very strong affect of healing you while you do other things essentially saving you and/or whoever heals you 16 seconds. While IS is essentially just another way to heal yourself, SW actually saves you time and allows you to rush generators without the downside of being injured. 
---
The only time IS can be strong is when you have DS, but only if they actually wait for you there. The killer should suspect DS the second you sprint into a locker, and that should make them just leave you entirely, so the IS wasnt even needed. And if they do pull you out like a rank 20 would, you use DS and get away and IS still didn't do anything.
---
Did you just post cringe bro? With an unironic "xD" bro?
---
Gotcha, gotcha. 
---
Well be on the lookout. Usually playing Nurse (especially outside of high ranks) means you‚Äôre in for an easier game...but they‚Äôre out there. I‚Äôm a decent survivor and I got absolutely mauled by a Nurse a handful of times.
---
Yeah that seems about right
---
i was a rank 11 and i played freddy with dream pallets against probably a swf with 2 red ranks, 3 object of obsessions *which completely obliterates freddy now because of the change he had recently btw* and they all had super good medkits and could heal really quickly and bodyblock constantly and also got lucky and got thompson's house
---
somehow i got three of them, the last one got lucky and found the hatch as i was chasing him. however i'll just think of this as karma because the previous killer match i went against rank 20s and they died :c
---
I can't wait for demogorgon
---
My name on PSN is the same here. Feel free to send a friend request and we can play some matches here and there!
---
Bayonancy vs Entity, the battle of the ccenture
---
Restart the game
---
This is why we don‚Äôt get any new players. C‚Äômon guys.... can‚Äôt we all be nice to eachoth- (sees full p3 squadette) (equips ebony Mori with malicious intent)
---
I‚Äôm still going to do it
---
Inner Strength needs to be nerfed is what you're meant to say. Totems should be cleansed and looked for everything game in case the killer has a burning totem or the chance of NoeD.
---
You can make plays with Inner Strength, DS and Head On from you being unhooked. Inner Strength is really strong and should be nerfed, the last thing we need is more buffs to survivors when every killer except Nurse and Spirit can stand a *chance* against all the perks and BS survivors can bring.
---
No, Second Wind is fine, Inner Strength needs a nerf, there's a difference.
---
Most decent survivors have memorised the spawns on Gideon though. Only a matter of time before survivors catch on to the spawns at Hawkins too. I‚Äôm currently running the meme build (DS, Inner Strength, Head On, Small Game) which is inadvertently helping me learn those spawns.
---
This is happening a lot though. I'm watching YouTube while playing and I looked down and I was 18 minutes into the video I started while in the lobby.
---
Free Bobby
---
I really hope so! :D
---
Not long ago had a game like that against a demogorgon. We smashed through the gens, Ruin stayed up all game. Ruins more effective at buying you time if survivors go looking for that totem and you cop a half decent spawn like on reworked Springwood
---
New Killer: Lindsey Nagle, Sexual Predator
---
You're disgusting! You're disgusting, vile, worthless human being! ^(updoots)
---
Sounds like a problem on your end tbh.
---
At it's core it's still a 4 survivors vs 1 killer game. The question is how well will it play. Square isn't an indie developer with limited resources. This could be a lot of fun or it could be shit. I registered for the alpha and hopefully I'll get picked to see first hand how it plays. 
---
I wasn't talking about Overseer, I was talking about Gold Express. That is a 4v1 game. It looks interesting, but it's not out yet. I guess Ochido got invited to a special preview or something. I have it in my wishlist.  
---
Regardless, I want these other games to come out as DBD is the only game in town and as long as they are, there isn't any real urgency to improve the game.
---
Everytime she kills a survivor, Entity gives her a book of Misery Chastain.
---
Than it's on you. Because that is not normal.
---
Oh boi you're lucky you don't play Killer, especially at high ranks. Every Killer can be pretty consistent at being bullied except for Nurse and Spirit, and yes that's not a joke.
---
If you are going to hide the whole match and make 1% progress on the gens every 5 minutes so you don‚Äôt get found, making the game last longer and be less fun for everyone, 
---
who is the toxic one?
---
Written on page 109 in the screenplay part 300, the Shape is meant to cry though.
---
This is a new thing. The whole game started acting crappy in the last few days.
---
600 hours into the game and never had a single issue
---
This is not how you make new players stay BHV...
---
I hate her because 7/10 times, its a spirit. I want some diversity
---
Record for about 10 minutes. Make sure you are going from gen to gen and showing that they aren't even trying to progress the game. 
---
Use the leave game option, report them using the scoreboard screen and send the footage to support.
---
They will get suspended or at the very least, flagged.
---
Yea , series but I ain't English native so I thought that serial could have work too ( btw , u can't be dumb just cuz u ask questions , that's a normal thing to do after all )
---
Edit : I'm on phone so please fuck off guys ;)
---
It's propaganda from killers to stop survivors from obliterating NOED and stocking up on on-demand 10 second heals while hiding out of plain sight.
---
Well yeah but I mean I primarily find at least one totem before getting hit. Therefore I have options for once I am hurt: get healed by someone else, use a med-kit, or use IS. So I think it is very good there. And then yeah of course plays you can potentially make with it also make it better. I don‚Äôt know I just feel like I use Inner Strength a lot and almost never get to use Second Wind.
---
What does nirnal mean, normal? Sorry for being dumb
---
Meh highly doubt it, she slugged me and was pretty much taking the piss the whole match
---
This is literally the 6th comment you've made to someone about "hypocrisy", is it your new favorite word? Did you just learn it today? You literally use it every sentence you type. 
---
Go learn a new argument handle dude. All it seems you do on your profile is argue with people for fun, so I really don't care about a single word you have to say to me.
---
Where is clown?
---
I second this. I also wouldn't mind being able to adjust the chase music as well (the heartbeat would stay one volume, but just turning up or down the actual chase music itself might be nice).
---
I just play at 18/100 volume. It would be nice though.
---
Yep that seems familiar, even more fun when its a pre-made with the cancer perk special on at least 3 of em
---
I just can't wait for the Archives to find out some lore, and so I can actually create an argument with a shipper over whether Jake and Huntress are banging or not lmao
---
r/woooosh
---
Better ?
---
I feel ya, I'm also at rank 18 but that's Just because of rank reset and not playing for months. Meaning I'll absolutely destroy rank 20 players so I don't want to go too hard vs them but on the other hand I'm facing high rank survivors and think what if I were actually a rank 18 killer.
---
MM hasn't been this bad for a long time.
---
Yup. Especially when there‚Äôs an unhook right in front of me. I won‚Äôt go as far as to hook the recently saved survivor, but you can bet i‚Äôm gonna slug him while i chase the rescuer.
---
Very nice figure, very nice fire 10/10
---
Second Wind health state requirement stacks.  Healing one guy for 20%, one guy for 70% and another for 10% still activates the perk.  You just have to 'heal survivors for the equivalent of one health state', you don't have to full heal one person without a medkit in one go like a lot of people seem to think.  Also, if you are injured you should let them heal you first because if you heal them and activate the perk and then they heal you to full, the perk deactivates.  A lot of people miss that caveat in the description.
---
As far as it being situational, it is yes.  That said, having any perk in the game that is good in any situation is of course going to negate the value of all other perks.  Every perk should have a situational application because if there are perks that are just straight up useful at any time and any situation, they are gonna be picked every time by most players.
---
Oh yes, forcing a bleed out, is a bad thing to do, but if he as he said, kept looping him the entire match, and that was his only down. The suriviers seems a bit like an ass too.. Looping, infinatly is bad for that game, and ruins the killers experience, expecially if a survivier only, ever, runs to the infinates they know.. So, if the bleed was warrented we don't know.
---
Thank you!
---
You're using the sub wrong dude lol
---
Now, this is epic.
---
I have been getting these mistakes for four months now. Atm it's not that bad since matchmaking is busted and you still get iridescent shards. But it sucks.
---
Inner Strength is definitely harder to trigger but for a more beneficial reward. It just requires you to play altruistically while also not getting chased first. Going for saves with We'll Make It allow SW to get activated pretty easily. Then you don't even need healing options, you'll just heal passively doing whatever else.
---
Even with four rank 1 players you can be matched against a rank 20 this is madness.
---
there should be leaving penalties like in csgo (30mins,2hours,24hours,7days) or something similar imo
---
*Inner Strength
---
What?
---
Oh so you were THAT pressed about what I said that you decided to go look at my comments from earlier today. üòÇ I'm flattered, honestly. I'm sure you didn't go through all of my posts just the ones from today that suit your needs. Judging by the downvotes you're getting on this thread buddy nobody cares about what YOU have to say. Take your own advice, dude. If you don't like something someone said or did just move on.
---
Thank you thank you! \^\^7
---
Nope, I always take perks. I just slowly p3 my killers till they have bbq3/ruin3 and Evan wanted all of my bloodpoints, Greedy rich boy. He has a lot of addons and perks now, so can‚Äôt complain on that departament :)
---
Yeah I guess but I don‚Äôt know I kind of feel like killers are already at the point where certain perks negate the value of almost all other perks (BBQ, Ruin, a few other select perks) üòÖ
---
Anti COCKWISE
---
Ok but where‚Äôs bubba
---
Number 1 Reason why i dont use dead hard anymore. There is just always that 1 second delay. You press E get hit anyway but you know it shouldve activated. You shake your head on the ground knowing that shit shouldve worked. But it didnt. Fucking dead hard.
---
The Simpsons predicted it
---
Very sick! I like it :)
---
Inner Strength works up to 5 times, soft counters NOED and other hexes, allows you to heal while being completely hidden and makes you invisible to Nurse's Calling, BBQ and other aura reading while you do.  I think you're understating the value.
---
Ooh right!
---
I was thinking of how Michael and the demogorgon have their own chase music and got confused because I couldn't remember legion having a different chase music, but right the main menu music changes too
---
Holy shit you brought me back so many memories. I had forgotten hail to the king was a thing.
---
Thx a lot!
---
I use this multiple.times a game.on average, totems are easy to find, find one and youve found them all if you're used to judging the distances between them.
---
Looks like my poopoo hole
---
What about those who constatly use No ED and Hex and rage quit when their totems are destroyed ?
---
That farm tho
---
Devs said they wont add ancient survivors since it eill look wrong for them to fix gens
---
Just wait until a legacy Nancy or Steve join
---
Clown‚Äôs award is for the most thicc
---
It is annoying
---
Still, this meme is gold.
---
I have the game for a few weeks now. I play both killer and survivor. Around rank 15 for both.
---
I am more scared when playing killer than when playing survivor. Not really the good vibe for a horror game.
---
I would love it if they did a QOL update in the future and made more audio options available, because generators and screams are far too loud in comparison to everything else. I know that it's supposed to serve as audio cues, but when the game highlights someone that's on the hook for you...it defeats the purpose of the scream
---
Recently got into ffdp so i can totally get behind joey now
---
Who are your best and most enjoyable to play killers? What is your playstyle on survivor? It‚Äôs important to find a balance between bp perks and overall survivability, as well as still keeping the game enjoyable.
---
Ehh there are no servers
---
It was a joke
---
I can't fucking unsee that now that you've taught me that
---
Oh god that‚Äôs cursed where‚Äôs the hair gone
---
Last patch; beyond level 40, you receive 3 perks, at 50+ you get 4 perks, both circumstances allow you to collect 2 from the web.
---
Hard to get out means you should be able to get out at some point but right now it seems like you may never get out which kinda sucks.
---
The new Bloodweb changes
---
With the aura-puke add-on, either they cleanse and die or they don't cleanse and you know their fucking gps co ordinates 90% of the match. Actually A their killer.
---
What do you mean don't play the game as intended? SWF is part of the game, genius. Sounds to me you're a baby killer who gets looped. Don't blame survivors for trying to survive, or wanting to play a video game with their friends. Just get good.
---
Conversely, I'd love to see a futuristic chapter. Maybe an android/cyborg killer? No reason the entity can't pull from the future
---
I find it useful because I do totems regardless. I'll still let others heal me if I can though, because bp/ranks.
---
As killer I actually found someone because of it, I completely lost them but then a couple of seconds later they were healed (and were Nancy) so I checked a nearby locker and there she was.
---
IRC those are supposed to be veins.
---
that hurt to see
---
Seems like one of the only good ways to utilize Wraith, so yeah. Kill whoever makes sense. I think the best play is to uncloak right as they've committed for the unhook, hit them then follow up for rehook, then start going for map pressure and follow-ups.
---
I started playing DBD in halloween 2017. The menu music gives me chills and so much nostalgia when I lidten to the halloween theme. ;)

Pretty sure this is everyone's experience when playing against nurse xD

happy cake day!

Nah nah nah that ain‚Äôt got shit on getting gen grabbed by the boogeymen

He just vibing

car myer funny

He‚Äôs going in the order that the killers were released, it seems

SC [spine chill] gives you an early warning and is a hard counter to some killers. Ghost Face, Pig, Spirit, and Wraith are just some of the killers that struggle against SC because they rely on surprising the survivors. SC is on but you don't hear heart beat? Look out for Ghost Face!
---
I think the problem you're running into is that you're over relying on the perk to do all the work for you. When it comes to being a survivor, staying alert at all times is key. When you go on a gen, you have to do a mental sweep of your area and understand two big things; 1) Where can I go if the killer comes my way? 2) Where can the killer come from?
---
IF you're inside the killer shack, for example, there's 3 ways the killer can come from. The placement of the killer shack, however, is usually in one of the corners of the map. This means that one of the doors is not a way the killer would go through, which means the other door and window are where you should keep a lookout. Hence, if SC goes on, then you know the killer is coming from that direction. This is something that takes time and practice.
---
I should add in that SC has been the biggest impact a perk has had for me. It's a perk that I always use no matter the build
---
5/5
---
I'm but she stunned me then t-bagged
---
Pig.   
---
If it is hands on, the only real thing she has is a knife. She is also 5'4 in canon. Compared to beasts like Trapper or Bubba, that's nothing.   
---
The only other possible option that makes sense is ghostface. 4 legion, no matter how badass you wanna think you are, is too much for most people. That's 4 people, all faster than normal, with knives coming at you. Fuck that.   
---
Ghostface? He murdered families at a time, and he was capable of doing it by himself.   
---
Amanda needed a team. A dysfunctional team, but a team. Amanda can't do even half the damage someone like Ghostface could in a 1v1. She is smaller, she is weaker, she has less attack power.  
---
TL:DR - Bacon bits is weak (still cute tho)
---
\+1
---
This is sort of why I wish AFK Crows were looked at, if Survivors aren't going to try at all to touch gens/totems/etc. and just stealth around the entire map for an absurd amount of time then they should definitely at least get a permanent 1 AFK Crow until they actually touch anything objective wise for a good amount of time.
---
1) the killer gives you free reveal points.
---
2) he respects your unhook.
---
Good guy killer, underappreciated. He was just dancing.
---
This is a you thing my guy. Probably the razer crap lmao
---
But just think about this, nobody has posted this the last few days and it happens to people who play with YOU. It is on your end, it's not the games fault.
---
You really don't watch Twitch or Youtube do you?
---
May i ask what the full comment says? Cuz i really wanna know lol
---
There is but one solution, BE the tryhard spirit
---
Matchmaking is messed up right now, I‚Äôve had survivor teammates be like 20, 10, 15, 1 in a single game
---
It is, cause it's fine, and you compared it to Inner Strength, not me.
---
Looks like it finally stopped being funny for the peasants. For me, a cultured intellectual, it stopped being funny WEEKS ago! /s
---
The best change they've made in years, thats why üòÅüëç
---
Worlds okayeat killer killed me XD
---
Still i killed a whole hroup pf survivors with ehr like they were nothing
---
AND FUCK YES THE HUNTRESS IS #1 MOM
---
Idk why but i want her as my mom
---
She could sing me to sleep
---
Thank you finally someone who understands
---
Secretly I have spine chill... Stalk me now boi
---
Rank 14, I got 3 rank 2s, and the last guy was rank 10 rip
---
Not people who play with me. It's people I know who play this game at different times than me. I'm not talking about people in my direct lobby. For a year and a half its been fine but last week there was an update and now I'm having problems as are all the people I know who play this game. No other game I play has these issues.
---
Revenge for the past 3 years of survivors doing it to killers.
---
[You thought it's a beer belly, it's a penis pouch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh7uKh4Jz_g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=91)

Maybe it's a joke because women normally can differentiate colours better?
---
now that would be a cause for concern!
---
Wait why are your upvotes and stuff pink?
---
I know dude , no need to wooosh here
---
Yeah, for killers this is a plaything simulator. When you see that map offering from a survivor and you know they're SWF. You might as well be gearing up for the next game. lol
---
They'd farm the fuck outa you
---
I love all the assumptions going on. 
---
No, i don't write shit on peoples' profiles nor will i ever let them know i'm reporting them. Why would i? I just want a cheater free environment and so far 1 out of 20 of the reported legacies turned out to be legit.
---
New killer: "evil kid from paranoia agent - the Shredder"

Survivors are meant to hide from the killer.

Me too but I don‚Äôt have that stuff, it looks really cool

No, giving the details of why it doesn‚Äôt work is a better way to go about it. It‚Äôs constructive feedback which always brings about improvement instead of just putting someone down.

Hag "most okayest" killer? How about "biggest jumpsc- HOW THE FUCK DID I RUN INTO ONE OF YOUR TRAPS AGAIN"-killer?

Best dlc should go for the demogorgon

Is it dead? Probably^^

can‚Äôt wait until the next chapter update when this glitch still isn‚Äôt fixed but they add even more ‚Äúlogging‚Äù :)

Uh....Huntress isnt anyone's mom, if anything it should say best daughter right?
---
Yeah they do that to me alot *messages me* : why did you tunnel me? *Me that just downed and hooked them and now wanting to have fun*: Because I hate you
---
What if after he downed a survivor instead of bringing him to a hook is power was that the entity comes up like it does during the end game timer.  You could still have phases. I think it would make him really good not having to waste time hooking survivors. Once they go down instant hooked. He essentially could just be a basic m1 killer but because his small size making looping and mind gaming harder plus the momentum he would get from instant hooks.
---
\^\^7
---
lmao only now i noticed it
---
Every time I see these posts I have to calm myself down. Because this sub whining like spoiled kids is what got Legion nerfed into the dirt in the first place
---
To be fair Michael is a pure evil and doesn't care about the entity (that's why he's the only killer that can kill survivors without mori)
---
Or maybe just slug, it keeps pressure and it let's that pressure snowball quickly since you get into another chase immediately. I'm just trying to point out how much of an asshole killers can be by forcibly removing a survivor out of the game because of their asshole teammates.
---
Besides, even if Inner Strength was overpowered, which it definitely is not, it is not even close, survivors have had practically all of their best perks nerfed at some time least once (DS, Mettle of Man, Borrowed Time, etc.) whereas killers have literally never had their best perks like Ruin or BBQ touched. It‚Äôs okay for survivors to have good perks. Not everything needs to be nerfed to being completely unusable (looking at you Mettle of Man).
---
There was an attempt
---
Right. It's all jokes now that the whiney fucks got their way and They got nerfed to shit lol
---
People never want balance or a challenge just for it to be just hard enough to not always win without trying.
---
Stranger Things intensifies
---
And the killer even brought party streamers...
---
That was cruel and also you had loads of time and didn't need to use the pallet XD
---
Lol if you're trying to justify mettle of man being fine as it was you have issues.
---
The Myers buff I didn't know I needed.
---
Trapper is already on the weaker side as far as killers go. His traps definitely don't need nerfing.
---
I hate when this happens
---
I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm just using it as an example of a good survivor perk being nerfed. For the love of God could you stop being toxic for 2 seconds so we can have an actual discussion?
---
Well yeah, not many people have grinded enough to get the teachable, especially since they'd hand to divert points from **KING STEVE**.
---
Nah probably not, I play huntress mainly
---
You wouldn't take No Mither all game against any 115% Killer when you have to repair generators and can get caught at them easily due to being one-shot, there aren't always safe loops near enough to a generator to reach without the speed boost, and at best there might be one pallet that you have to almost immediately use unless you're 100% big brain pro.
---
Being broken makes generators more of a death trap than waiting out corrupt purge, I usually subscribe to the idea of toughing out the early game (first two generators, maybe three if it's going very well) and then cleansing for the harder generators.
---
When Plague can patrol a tighter loop (particularly if she ran Corrupt Intervention or aimed for a 3-gen) and you're dealing with a (more than likely, but even if not) Thanatophobia 4-stack and/or (usually and) PGTW you can't really let her snowball off everyone being broken.
---
Wait out the Corrupt Purge like you'd wait out a Michael, use the fountains near the completed generators, be willing to sacrifice one person (games where I purge halfway through generally still have a death) or to be the one who gets screwed in order for the other three to get out.
---
Save generators near taller walls, Plague has to generally conventionally M1 rather than slow herself by charging Corrupt Purge, certain maps (like Autohaven) suck balls on her as a result.
---
Stealth is amazing against Plague, they're relying on everything you touch being infected, the green fumes, the coughing and vomiting to find you. You can't hide, you'll die, each generator will effectively be a dead zone and as she gets PGTW rolling over and over you won't get out easily without cleansing.
---
Besides the tendency for Plague to run an Apple means not cleansing is going to have her Corrupt Purge anyway.
---
Yeah i could &amp; should have worded my OP better, 'twas late and didn't feel like writing a wall of text. I'll leave it up anyway, i made an edit on it. Don't care about the downvotes, reddit mob mentality gotta do what it does best :P
---
But yeah, i do actually check the profiles as best as i can before reporting for the sake of the employees dealing with em. And so far, 19/20 is not that bad track record :)
---
Purple ranks and like nobody is using it dude. And no, I am not ‚Äútaking it as toxic.‚Äù You‚Äôre just being toxic. And my argument was that nerfing perks into complete uselessness is stupid, and I used Mettle of Man as an example. I never said that it was okay, I am just say that nerfing perks to uselessness is stupid, especially if the perk isn‚Äôt overpowered like Inner Strength. Did Mettle of Man need a nerf? Yes. But they took it too far. Does Inner Strength need a nerf? No. But if people whine enough it will get one and then it‚Äôll be useless. Now, if you‚Äôre done being a toxic baby, go whine on some other thread, I am sick of dealing with you.
---
I‚Äôm just imagining ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve Got Company‚Äù by Jerry Goldsmith
---
Totally, and it should work like League of Legends so that timer is based on when you try to queue next, not the time of DC so you're not just like, I'll play something else on here and get back on dbd later. (Sure you still could but youd have to tie up some ram and stuff to keep the game open or not being able to play another game if you're on console)
---

---
Haven't encountered any fps problems at all and I'm like 30 matches in with Demogorgon.
---
awh hell yeah, hooked me a survivor! proceeds to shuffle away..
---
i think i need this for every killer
---
player and gen auras and scratch marks are pretty much invisible for most forms of colour blindness. makes playing killer a lot harder than it should be
---
Your god damn right clown dlc is the best.
---
Never had an issue with that, I thought dbd was capped at 60fps though? I know you can remove the cap but people have said it drops a crap ton of frames sometimes
---
The latter which is good enough for me
---
I'd love to say the demogorgon but fuck that I like The Shape more
---
Shonen Bat would make me lose my mind.
---
Well there's KYF... or do you mean with bots?
---
That is bs instantly hooked no because then you can't flashlight save or use DS or wiggle out and a basic m1 killer has 115% movement speed so he would dominate top spot in an instant. So really I don't see this ever working because size is a major factor they need to be able to be bigger than the pallet model
---
Me: Downs and hooks a survivor and walks off
---
Survivor: Gets unhooked 15 meters away, runs and leaves scratch marks and blood
---
Me: Runs back, sees scratch marks and blood, downs them again
---
Survivor:

Only if killer dashboards, then the survivors lose there items, offerings, they get 0 blood points and -2 pips. If the killer leaves normally then the survivors get an escape.
---
As a survivor, i didnt use spine chill. And i always fuckup when face him
---
I swear, when you're a Rank 15-14 Killer matchmaking is the worst. You play against Survivors who are Rank 8-6 and trust me, they're the most toxic pieces of shit I've ever played against. I get like two of them most of the time and then I get insulted in the chat after the game ends. Fun times, lol.
---
That's the thing they don't stack you can only use it once then you have to replenish it you can't break like 2 totems and use it twice you have to do it one by one which makes it worse than it is you might as well bring a medkit or find someone to heal you it'll be much faster
---
Yeah, McCote and Gabe had beef over it and they're currently discussing the best way to resolve the issue, thus far they come to conclusion an MMA 12 rounds would be a suitable and unbiased way to resolve it.
---
I am taking about the luck based chance on these thing like unhooking yourself or trapper traps. If trapper is weaker then its other abilities should be buffed insteas of making escaping trap mechanic broke. Like I said earlier that it should implement something like pseudo-random distribution(PRD) used in dota 2.  Its not even nerfing. Here an example: sucess in freeing yourself from trap is 25%. So with PRD first attemp should have success chance of 8.5%. Now thats already create a big difference in freeing yourself in first attemp. Second attemp will have  17% which is also low as compare to 25%. And third will have 25.5% which will be same as what happening right now. So freeing yourself at first attemp will be low. With this mechanism, even if you are unlucky at all attemp, you will be able to free yourself at 14th attemp. I dont think it is nerfing and also it reduces the chance of freeing yourself at first attemp.

Sometimes i wait out the possible ds and only after that carry and hook. It's nothing personal.

The thing is that, if you don't focus as killer you're gonna loose, meanwhile playing survivor is a piece of candy, no wonder why most streamers are survivor mains

After about half a year of playing the game I had to explain my friend that he could find survivors by looking at the scratch marks. He just wandered around the map hoping to find someone...
---
Thats such a dirty tactic
---
007? James Bond is that you?
---
Oh boy, I think we might end up badly here.
---
But here it goes.
---
First I'll state that below there will be no hatred or dislike towards gay. Idc what will anyone here think of me, but that here is to prevent any potential "are you a homophobe?" Because this term seems to be way too broad now.
---
Starting with how "homo is normal". Well I cant agree with that. Yes there is sex outside of procreation ofc, however the ultimate goal of existance of a living being as part of a species is to procreate to keep the species going. Therefore in this kind of sense being attracted to same sex is not "normal". It is acceptable in human society (somewhere less acceptable), but isnt "normal", and this subtle difference is what matters.
---
&gt;Being queer is not a mental ilness and we know that for a long time
---
Not quite. You (as collective West) just accepted those non-normal kinds of behaviour as normal because of its just very convenient to say "hey yall bang whoever you want its normal". It of course encourages people to be themselves but in the end its just a blissful lie to yourself.
---
&gt;I have the world and the future with me
---
Definitely not the whole world and talking about future is a bold claim tbh when your position damages not only the country of yours but also the species as a whole in a long run.
---
&gt;Its general TRUTH
---
As I said, its a convenient self-deception. Though I cant help but notice the colonial mentality of "if someone doesnt agree with my progressive views, he's dumb". Is it a new iteration of Kipling's "white man's burden"? You present flat earth as example but round earth has massive proof to back it up while the whole "normality" of queer has quite a shaky foundation.
---
It's 30 mons with unbalanced matchmaking AND unbalance powerroles.
---
No mither is you purposefuly hurting yourself, a hard mode per say. Its only for challenging yourself
---
Could do steam age or something from early years of machines
---
made with mematic
---
Also take protective hits with WGLF, which can be if the killer is carrying someone or you get hit instead of the injured survivor
---
If you're on PC and have a Nvidia GPU, download the Nvidia Experience and enable the colorblind option there
---
Is it just 8, 007 or is there some flavour text?
---
I do.
---
I also play a lot
---
and what do I see? people running inner strength
---
and never getting it to work, cuz I always go around the map at the start and do 3 or 4 totems before the first gen pops and the rest quickly after it.
---
This is just amazing, so much thought gone into it I like it
---
What are scratch marks?
---
Watch someone say it's actually toxic even tho it's a strategy
---
So what you're saying is you purposely hinder the power and the potential of the perk and that is a justification for not nerfing it? That's a toxic playstyle that imo.
---
David shouldn't even be ranked because he's just that hot.
---
I'm about to mori these whole comedians career
---
This is so true
---
Ohhh. Have the devs said anything about it?
---
When I teabag it ain't to be toxic. I see it more of a way to say hello, goodbye and thanks
---
Omg I do the same.
---
not that ik of sadly
---
Well maybe of you got better at looping the killer, you wouldn't be tunneled off hook would you?
---
its a glitch you are getting no survival points because of it. if the killer leaves scoreboard before you load to it that is what happens
---
Unless he changed what he typed, it's not really that toxic. You could argue that he's being a bit of a jerk. It also doesn't help just repeatedly calling him toxic when, if at worst, they were being mildly inflammatory. There is some truth to what they was said though.
---
Unless killer is running Discordance.
---
I'm aware that it may have been offensive but I am bringing out everything wrong because I want you to understand why it wouldn't work and how the mechanics of the game is. Sorry if I gave the impression of an asshole who doesn't have anything better to do.
---
Excuse you, Steve is actually an adulted kid.
---
It‚Äôs really fun bullying low rank killers thanks to the shit match making system but I feel bad too
---
Ye but I get accused of it
---
God damn it. I guess that means I can't grab them out of lockers or I'm a tunneling pos who has to uninstall the game now.
---
"they got more *********** than they got the likes of me... im a black scottish cyclops"
---
Don't put one in the basement rather above it so when the guy gets unhooked you still can get at least 1 hit try it out trust me it's alot easier
---
We'll make it.....
---
Bruh he consistently cursed me out, called me garbage and called my opinions worthless just because of rank, and kept getting worse and worse when I consistently expressed a desire to keep it civil. I‚Äôm not talking about the points he made, I am talking about the way he made them. He is the absolute perfect example of toxic.
---
If he were to start healing her it would truly be 200 iq since you can‚Äôt pick up when someone is healing. Then he would literally have to hit you and then the slug would use the cooldown animation to escape
---
Quitter bonus should be in the Malice category, not Brutality. Also, there should be a Quitter bonus for survivors too, as they are te ones who get fucked up the most in this situation, and it should go for the Survival category.
---
I don't see that anywhere in his posts about your rank or him cursing you out
---
do you give a fuck?
---
That Demogorgon slander tho
---
Lol. flashbacks to Archeage and leaving your computer on overnight so you can get out of jail.
---
‚ÄúTrying their best‚Äù I‚Äôm dead
---
Dude did you read the thread at all? I‚Äôm not talking about his opinions at all. It is perfectly ok to have differing opinions. It‚Äôs the way he phrased those opinions as clear attacks towards me, my skill, my intelligence, etc that isn‚Äôt okay. Maybe reread the thread and try to not miss the clear evidence of his toxicity staring you in the face.
---
Wow can you please make a completely icon Pack? That just looks amazing
---
Oh yeah i love when they just cant live without leaving them on for 5 seconds
---
fok'n no mither
---
Firstly, how did you manage to get blocked from the gate by a killer and cornered? Just run around them, risk it. Secondly, if she couldn't apply the broken status with her vomit, what would be the point of her power? You have time once she vomits kn you to get away before the broken status appears, unless you literally just stood there and let her vomit on you
---
inflammatory, yes. "toxic?" subjective. 
---
You're still witchhunting, which is against the rules
---
I'm a trapper main
---
Fuck the spirit
---
I don't assume every legacy is hacked but after hearing a decent-sized streamer mention they got away with it for years until they got greedy does make me skeptical.
---
My thoughts:
---
The first perk is very situation and there is no reason to use it.
---
The second one is ok
---
The third one is OP because you can camp the third gen
---
I like what you did to the power, HOWEVER, he still doesn't any type of map pressure and the power doesnt help him in chases. Right now he looks like a worse Ghostface.
---
Well then the mods will ban this post. As long as before it gets banned some attention is drawn to this man‚Äôs completely unacceptable behavior I am fine with it.
---
I do bones regardless. Especially if there is no ruin. There's a reason why and it's usually noed.
---
Oh yeah humiliation fetishes, that's what it is as well then.
---
First game in as demogorgon I got a 4 stack of p3 Claudettes with flashlights and spine chill who brought a yamaoka offering. I face camped them really hard. Everytime someone tried to grab him I'd pluck them off and slug them so they couldn't be unhooked. If you're going to go out if your way to ruin my fun, I'm going to go out of my way to ruin your game. üñï
---
What if I have the perk play with your food
---
You can buy the demo with auric cells for much cheaper if you only want the demogorgon.
---
I feel you. I just don't want to bother until they fix it, at this point.
---
Oh no sorry it sounds like that. it‚Äôs a noob3 series
---
They said that they‚Äôre working to achieve a solid 60fps for all consoles but it will take a while, however this was said a while ago so nothing on the recent bursts of lag unfortunately.
---
Honestly ban me from the subreddit entirely honestly, finally make it so that I literally have zero way of coming back to this toxic cesspool of a subreddit anymore üòÇ
---
Tunneling is nothing to do with the time the chase lasts. It's when you repeatedly chase the same person and ignore everything else around you.
---
Meg just got off hook and your running her down despite david bodyblocking you? Still not going to hit him and going to try to go around him... That's tunneling.
---
If they didn't run you would see them anyway since you insta returned to the hook lol
---
That's why you're kinda forced to run if the killer is returning to every unhook.
---
I suggest you actually read what i wrote.
---
Is that one of the opening levels of Half Life 2 but humans were replaced with M&amp;Ms?
---
Hate when killers clearly dont belong in a certain rank bring out their best kits to stomp newer survivors. But now as im looking at it she got a 1k with an ebony and iridescent hatchets maybe she do belong there
---
What does Tony Hawk have to do with horror? There‚Äôs too many other cool IPs they could add.
---
I like the amount of downvotes I got. Heathens reject truth. Give them no quarter. Kill them all, and let God sort them out.
---
I‚Äôm always excited when I get ping like that
---
I was talking about the remake
---
Hiding is them just doing their objective which is surviving. Isn't this the same argument killers use to justify camping and tunneling?
---
He charged it before coming around the corner,  but if u mean that his shred  is to fast in general then , maybe a little bit
---
Nah if you don't play a lil you won't pip,  sad killers get punished if they do too well but understandable
---
I'm downvoted because people simply can't handle how the game actually is. They play for one side and will bat for them at every given moment, whereas being on the side of true balance, you get shit on a lot. A lot of the time you can tell if they're a low rank or if they're a high rank at one side (Killed or Survivor).
---
For example, a guy who I won't name, said that in his steam profile he has played 95% survivor on his 1800hours played. That means that at maximum he has played survivor 1,710 hours on survivor and 90 hours on Killer. At the end of the game after getting a 4k he called me a baby killer for using Sloppy Butcher on The Legion as it is OP on The Legion and The Legion needs to be nerfed because they are too strong. This was at the middle of Purple Ranks. Yet if you look at how the game actually is, Legion is one of the weaker killers and needs buffs, but DW because that high IQ Purple Rank player I faced believes that Legion needs to be nerfed and is OP with Sloppy Butcher XD. You can clearly see which side this guy bats for, it's awful.
---
I don't.
---
I'd rather a fair game then a broken mess anyday. It leads to trash arguments like these that go no where. you're going to lie about any experiences you have on either side regardless just to stroke your fragile ego.
---
5 minute ban, add 5 minutes each time after in the same day.
---
Unpopular opinion but we need more people of color and tony hawk doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with horror
---
I love how no one is talking about the dying light crashes yet.
---
I like it but I'm highly skeptical of the blindness.

---
How did the huntress not win the game?
---
no, what I'm saying is that I'm doing what I was always doing to get rid of possible noed when there's little pressure and I won't change my playstyle, cuz some people might run a perk that might make them cleanse one of the totems
---
I have no time for that in the late-game after people have taken what they needed and inner strength users won't cleanse the second totem while they have their perk ready, so I just do my job
---
and this perk STILL has 5 possible uses distributed among 4 survivors
---
&gt; I literally have never heard of anyone complain about borrowed time or decisive. 
---
Lol, DS is **always** complained about. It's like the NOED of survs, everyone always complains about it, despite the fact it's actually useless against a good killer.
---
&gt;Where you survivor mains are hearing these complaints I'll never know.
---
Not a surv main as I play both around the same but reddit and afterlobby generally.
---
People don't seem to like Borrowed, DS, Adrenaline, Noed and Ruin. I'm fine with all as I've played both sides and understand their existence.
---
-----
---
Gen rush is not a thing though, Killers don't have a hook rush. You don't wait till 1 generators is done before you hook a second person, I've had games were we only got 1 gen done before everyone got third hooked.
---
Bugs, crashes, and maybe if your lucky some funky switch glitches.
---
You have your opinion , I respect it . But we seem to live in 2 different worlds . And you also seem to be the "i am not a homophobe but..." kind of person . Which is okay , you do you . I would like to say sorry if i offended you in any way . I would love to keep this convo going but i dont think it will end somewhere . So , have a good one . Love is in the air .
---
Calling it now: Tony Hawk will be the Legion rework, FF replaced by a skateboard.
---
&gt; People say I‚Äôm tunneling when they make stupid choices like saving someone the second I hook them
---
The person doing the saving likely is just trying to hook farm his team. He knows you are going to kill his team mate he just doesn't care.
---
First you are giving free rescue bloodpoints to the farmer so he‚Äôll keep doing it, second farming teammates usually ends up in a loss for the survivors so you should always go for the weak if you want to win and punish the farmer. It may sounds bad but the survivor you are hooking will die soon and get a new lobby in a few minutes with (hopefully) better teammates.
---
here for the loona
---
Yeah probably smart. NGL of any gaming community I have ever been a part of, for any amount of time, DBD is absolutely by far the worst. And I partook in some pretty terrible communities (Smash Bros., Overwatch, Fortnite, etc.) at this point it would probably be good for my mental health to never come back to any community boards for this game.
---
Ah ty I'm pairing it with nurses calling which hopefully works out well
---
Ty
---
Every map with long, low loops is just straight up trash. You literally can't mindgame as killer, you just have to run with them untill they drop the pallet, you kick it and they get to the next loop or jungle gym. I wish they would take a look at temple, auto haven and Ironworks, just complete unfun maps that quite literally don't need any skill besides knowing not to run into the killer when he moonwalks WHICH YOU CAN SEE
---
For 3 times, then go to one of the 3 nearby pallets :)
---
Seriously? Perhaps I try again then? I just tested my internet, it's at best 1.57 mpbs (download) and 0.29 (upload).
---
I see people saying that you‚Äôll get matched up with higher ranks when you‚Äôve been waiting a while. Except I got a lobby in like 10 seconds, and the lowest rank survivor in it was 8. I think I had just hit rank 14 before that match. I don‚Äôt get it.
---
Almost like wraith himself is trash
---
Then don't play him if you hate it
---
viable?
---
This happened to me on my first 3 games, completely killed my desire to play the game.
---
They might‚Äôve gone in perkless and itemless. I‚Äôve seen people do that before just to mess around.
---
Was I really a bitch tho for leaving? I felt something was odd af and left, in post game screen, surprise, I, a rank 20 killer, played against a rank 2 survivor and 3 rank 7-10.
---
They better not be pulling a Friday the 13th and get into some legal issues
---
The day I got the Demogorgan I think I accidentally stopped the shred to early and just performed a fucking basic attack when they were several meters away. If it‚Äôs possible for someone to let it go early, then it‚Äôs probably not too fast.
---
*XDDDDDDDDDD*
---
The fucking snipsnap is too true. I main Freddy pretty much just because he is satisfying to play
---
I‚Äôm a rank 11 killer rn and went against a swf of all rank 2s, all purple flashlights, no kills, one hook, entity displeased
---
feels bad man
---
yeah but isnt the charge time 1 second? in the clip hes defo not waiting 1 second before attacking so idk whats going on xd
---
'cause it's easier to get who he is talking about.
---
Not like there was 1000 trans OW streamer
---
It's been severely fucked since the update so lord knows what it going on, maybe it's the remnants of the PTB not having a ranking system that have made their way through or their testing another matchmaker.
---
you can enter a game in KYW alone ?
---
You don't get it, I love playing my zappy boi, it's indoor maps that I hate.
---
**LOL EZ BABY KILLER**
---
He was only toxic because the game itself threw him under the bus. If the commenter chooses to stop being nice to a different set of people because one new player was upset, he needs to check himself. It's the equivalent of using a pink mori on solo baby Dwight's because a claud-squad looped you for 5 gens.
---
As a trapper, it makes me happy, but as a lucky person it makes me scared
---
Wait but there was a steve and it was weetched shop i think
---
&gt;Or you actually git gud and find them or if you need it use Whispers. Survivors are so easy to find.
---
They are easy to find when you know they are near objectives, which narrows an entire map down to a reduced area or you catch them trying to leave that area. 
---
When their only goal is to hide using anywhere on the map, it is almost impossible to find them without Whispers. You can scout the entire map, go past them circling around a rock right next to you and still miss them because you have first person view against third.
---
Ultimately, when either side (killer or survivor) is not trying to progress the game just for the sake of dragging the game for as long as they possible can, it is considered holding the game hostage past the 10 minute mark.
---
Rip daddy david
---
When your obsession plays really cocky, t-bags you and spams his flashlight. "Yeah boy, you are the best, let me just uhhh- *Third stack pops* - thank you"
---
Thank you
---
I had no idea DBD was a puzzle game. TIL.
---
Basement hooks can't be sabotaged
---
Even if they circle you just have to know how a survivor is thinking like avoid dead areas incase they‚Äôre found meaning just check good loops, lockers, and generators.
---
But why did they make it shorter, it was so good at ending loops and specially the shack loop without it being broken
---
You forgot the 2. Rank 12*
---
I'm consistently a rank 1. Killer is easy
---
My point is that even if you play perfectly (15 second chases) the survivors can still dominate you. That‚Äôs just a fact at red ranks. As an M1 killer you have to rely on weak links and survivor mistakes which is lame.
---
Seriously, the twitter have said it‚Äôs bugged, there has been 1000 of posts about it. We‚Äôve all been through it so stop posting over saturated content, it‚Äôs boring.
---
Nice build for the Memes, although I shudder at the thought of a building without Ruin, if you're doing it for the Memes cannot complain one bit :)
---
Damn I know that feel
---
I was playing Plag for a daily (1 perk slot too) and i got 2 survs sacrificed *This was green ranks btw*
---
And i started patrolling the last 5 gens left
---
Again
---
And again
---
For like 20 minutes
---
I play on console so i couldnt make a chat or send messages exactly so i just stood in a corner for 10 minutes and waited for SOMETHING to be done
---
Nothing happens so I start corner checking everywhere, luckily I found the last 2 survs and got my sweet sweet daily and 4k
---
Pusshrooms
---
Adopt a Demodog today!
---
Woah holy crap, were you a Meyers?
---
This would be pretty cool except, like what others have said, it's blind. Too me it's too similar to the demogorgan as well in terms of looks and movement, and sound
---
My playstyle is "get rid of NOED as soon as possible, so we don't have to worry about it later and I can do the gens as quickly as possible"
---
I don't change it, because I see not getting noeded more important than someone getting a heal off once, especially because healthstates are useless and the only heal in the game one should need is Adrenaline.
---
If people running Inner Strength could guarantee me not getting NOEDed, I would've changed my playstyle, but as it doesn't, it's a "sucks to be them" situation. I see my job as more important, so I will do it.
---
That‚Äôs the thing though, gen speed is balanced for people that don‚Äôt know where gens are, fail skill checks regularly, and run away and hide from gens if they hear the terror radius slightly. So gens takes years for them. But at red ranks ruin has no affect gens go insanely fucking fast. If you don‚Äôt get that early bit of momentum then the game is over. I would be happy if they increased gen time so that each rank has a specific gen time, but there‚Äôs problems because mixed ranks and whatever.
---
Good shout, though hotfixes tend to release whenever.
---
On the release day there were like 20 posts about how bad demogorgon feels on console.
---
Nah- Lil Slugger.
---
Mythbusters: Is Freddy‚Äôs neck bigger than his lunge?
---
This. This IS beauty
---
The clicker isnt too close to the demogorgon when it comes down to it, but it would technically be closer than any other killer we have just because the rest are human. And yeah, the blindness was the main reason I dont think it would be a good killer. But it's still fun to design
---
I'm not doxing myself to prove a point to someone who thinks Rank 1 is hard to reach.
---
git gud
---
That‚Äôs tough.
---
And still he's abnormaly small compared to the absolute units that we have, hell Dwight could just kick him in the face and run...he's only a murderer in his movies because he strikes from behind or is chasing a Child...
---
Try play plague and you‚Äôll see how rough it is, you should label this shitpost as it‚Äôs just you relieving your salt
---
That's how he lunges, his neck ensures the majority of his weight is in the front.
---
No matter if I'm survivor or killer. J hate playing that map.
---
He doesn't know PepeLaugh
---
Enduring
---
I'm a Hag main... i love spirit... and Plague oh and Piggy... they are my ladies.
---
Hehehe.. poke the tiddy
---
Do you know the specific timing out of interest ?
---
Have you taken a look at the Adept achievements? It looks like NOBODY is doing Steve's at all.
---
Adept Nancy is sitting at, at the time of this post, 0.10% completion rate.
---
Adept Steve is sitting at 0.01% which is enormously low, even for a character that just came out.
---
Doxing, it‚Äôs steam 4head. But here come the excuses.
---
I mean, it is 100% the killer‚Äôs fault. They‚Äôre a killer. ^/s
---
Fear the Y posing Micheal, FEAR IT!
---
This.
---
I had a match as Demogorgon, yesterday, on Temple of Purgation. 
---
Found a Laurie very quickly, but she got to a strong jungle gym, that was right next to shack. After a couple of loops she dropped the pallet and I baited her to vault into me. However, she Dead Hard'ed through me and reset the loop. 
---
Downed her about 2 mins into the game (I know, far too long) and lost FOUR GENS for the pleasure...
---
*crickets*
---
This sounds like it could only be a mechanical issue. Make sure everything is connected correctly
---
I believe both equally destroy pallets fast as the other as with enduring you don't have a stun basically meaning you can break the pallet instantly while with brutal strength you break the pallet faster but still eat the stun. You'd need to do some testing but I believe they are both as fast or one is just a little bit slower then the other.
---
You're just bad. 
---
Gen Pressure, forcing group engagements to unhook and keeping everyone injured is what wins games. On top of that we have the advantage of lag which means we hit through pallets and windows. And then there's NOED and Ruin.
---
If there are teammates bodyblocking that they're avoiding, who's doing these 3-4 gens?
---
Unfortunately, the devs will never do Killers based on actual religions.
---
It‚Äôs actually Nurse and Wraith. And yes, this is in fact canon.
---
I kinda wish there was a way to practice Killers you‚Äôre not familiar with... I tried Nurse once and HOLY SHIT. I couldn‚Äôt blink properly to save myself üòÇ bar just hoping you pick it up quick mid ranked match you can‚Äôt really get the ‚Äúdo I like this Killer or not?‚Äù
---
In term of toxicity, a killer is pretty limited because he's alone against a full team of port actually just as toxic (or more) than him.
---
Killers can be toxic without certain behaviours or the use of a certain combo of perks (whichh can take a lot of time to get them all) on a certain killer and all of this only work if played in a certain way.
---
But as we can see it here, survivors can be just as toxic if they want just by being passive like this...
---
Just realise the difference, to be toxic, a killer have to try extremely hard and take a lot of effort while a survivor can just not do anything...
---
‚ÄúI am the Entity‚Äù
---
No one remembers Cecil, but you have a point.
---
I had a Killer like this yesterday. My buddy thought that Trapper would let him go but I told him "Don't be a fool. He is a Trapper with Noed and was super sweaty all game. Of course he is just playing with you." My buddy tried to open the Exit Gate for a second on The Game map, then he decided to give him his Toolbox. Trapper M1 the Pallet near the exit where he gave him his Toolbox. Time was running out so my buddy decided to finish the exit gate and get his Toolbox again. Before he could finish opening the exit The Trapper downed him and hooked him. In the endgame chat he was the saltiest person alive for 5min straigth even though me and my buddy usually never teabag and definitly didn't in that game. This Trapper was very lucky he got 2 red ranked survivors and 2 rank 18ish survivors. Btw one of the Rank 18 Survivors flamed us aswell because in his eyes we didn't carry hard enough. I still love this game &lt;3 but sometimes we don't get along eachother. We just talk it out!
---
Counterrebuttal: ass.
---
How isn‚Äôt it true? 
---
People said the same shit about Jason in F13th and he was literally being treated like a Tbag pi√±ata in every match.
---
I have discovered that perks like bond, empathy, aftercare work better and have more applications ingame.
---
10/10 till you burnt it :( RIP HAG, you were like a father to me.
---
Susie is overated and you cannot change my mind
---
That's just your imaginary rule :) Just get better at finding things
---
i mean, better than lightweight atleast imo.
---
When you get obliterated as killer, it's hard to imagine the survivors as just some people playing to have fun. It feels like 4 people who truly are only there to make your life miserable. It doesn't help with this horrible matchmaking, making the game itself feel rigged from the start.
---
For all we know, the killer could've thought the survivor was being sarcastic.
---
Well, since i use both dead hard and iron will beeing injuried usually doesn't have a big change, specially when the killer has noed and im already Injuried, i've been thinking about changing lightweight for either second wind or (that perk that heals you when in a locker that i forgot the name)
---
You can‚Äôt have multiple online steam games running at once. Just close cs before you play.
---
You seem like the toxic one. Stop whining and crying we don‚Äôt care. I hope I get you in a game and after I looped you for god knows how long then I‚Äôll rub these smelly crusty balls all over your exit gate
---
Honestly I also feel enduring is slightly faster but I don't know for sure.
---
I play within the red ranks, sometimes with below rank 15 killers for achievements. It's not difficult to apply pressure to the survivors and prevent gens. Not only that but you need to sometimes let certain gens pop so you have a tighter more controlled patrol route. It all comes down to strategy. Just chasing a survivor and downing them isn't going to save the game. You sometimes need to injure multiple survivors, stop chases early and make sure gens are constantly regressing.
---
Ive faced him many times. Each time results in his hillbilly getting ran by me 5 gens and then him face camping me and messaging me after about how im a scrub and he beat me. Then he puts a bunch of ‚Äúüëãüèªüëãüèªüëãüèª‚Äù lol. Dude is trash af the game and pathetic.
---
Idk, i kind like lightweight, i usually want to focus on gens so the faster i lose him/her the better
---
I was rank 17 and got matched against a 4man swf group of rank 2 twitch streamers.
---
Didn't get cornered, tried to save my teammate who was downed, so she instead chases me. I was dodging her vomit and she basically passed me, Gate was 99%, and she just stood infront of the panel and i couldnt open it lol. Just seems strange, she has an attack that can get you one shot overtime, but she still has collision.

You are kuckt that Claudette represents THE DARK force.
---
Personally, Solidarity is working really well for me over SC.
---
She blocked the exit panel, 99% the gate, couldn't open it. Didn't actually got cornered, that was more of an example. She was just spraying me with vomit so i ran away, but at that point it was obviously to late.
---
Aah ok cheers üëç
---
Why would there be? They are putting so much into dedicated servers that they are not doing anything for balance, except reduce pallets on every map.
---
The gen speeds are fine, you just need to play Spirit or Nurse at red ranks.
---
Something fun, but can be dangerous to do is to go hide in a locker that the killer just checked!
---
I've played plague plenty. Kind of salty, kind of still find it a strange mechanic. Imagine if wraith would have no collision, even after hits, thats how it kinda seems like to me.
---
Killer main, here, I understand that. Ironically it was playing survivor the other day that taught me this though. After a killer hooked me and I died, I felt really angry. Then, I realized they're just playing like anyone else. That's how survivors are too, many times. Self control should give people the ability to think rationally about the outcome of a match, and prevent them from telling someone else to kill themselves. If they weren't toxic, and they played like any other group trying to survive, you can be angry at the system or at yourself, but a reply that criminalizes other players is completely unnecessary.
---
I've hit rank 1 killer in 6 different seasons and I've played just as much survivor, I'm rank 2 right now. 
---
Killer is the easy mode. It's a pisstake. I play killer while watching TV because I don't have to give it 100% of my concentration.
---
Nah, I get omega blink Nurses or tunneling Clowns :)
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Dam. I didn‚Äôt really ever think about it that way about colour blindness and gaming. That must truely suck üòï
---
You're missing a few more M&amp;Ms because it's always a SWF too.
---
&gt;I'm doodoo at the game so that means everyone is doodoo.
---
I meant the gate panel, i 99'd it, didn't get cornered, was just an example. I never said she shouldn't apply the broken effect, just once she hits you collision should leave, just like with every other killer in the game.
---
Happened with me on PS4, I messaged and was like "hey bud you did so good! I have some tips and tricks for you if you'll have them! 
---
1.Turn off messaging it is way too easy for people to be meanies
---
2-6 Bing Bong Boi tips"
---
Felt so bad for the tank 20 wraith :(
---
Really sucks when my 4man swf brings bps and I get 4 stacks of wglf and the killer DC's and none of us get bloodpoints :)
---
Yes but that‚Äôs punishing the one who DCed, the survivors shouldn‚Äôt be punished.
---
Jokes on you I have a downvote from someone, probably you!
---
Oh , hello hello
---
Recently I got survivors hating me for "bad internet", they were laughing I probably live in Africa etc(I don;t), but I was really dissapointed with the racism...
---
Just ignore them, by chasing them you are literally doing exactly what they want
---
You : calls survivors sensitive
---
Also You : is sensitive
---
This man dispenses the S C O O P S
---
Compared to him
---
You are nothing
---
This is one of the few times I‚Äôd like an indicator of when I‚Äôll actually Shred and when I‚Äôll M1 like a fool.
---
It sucks fir both sides , in sime areas there are too much pallets + the balance landing room and in other areas there are too much hooks
---
I mean, if I get angry, which I do a lot because I have issues and I'm bad, I just leave as killer and do something else. DbD isn't worth getting angry over anymore. No game is for me.
---
Hooks come back after sometime. Playing solo with this strategy is harder. If playing with some friends, you all should 99% the hooks and then start completing the sabotage of hooks close to downed survivors.
---
Agreed. Glad to hear it!
---
Then survivors cry when everyones forced to play Nurse/spirit/billy.
---
Found myself playing survivor a lot more these days cause killers just getting tiring, still baffles me how theres an ego with red rank survivors.
---
Well... I.. Wanted to say that.. Have my upvote then
---
But slrsly there are times you just look at something and be like
---
N word what te fuck?
---
This is very nice. Last night I was going for Adept David(I got all my survivor adepts that I could yesterday) on the game. The clown downed me and luckily there was an injured Meg right there so he chased her. I picked myself up with no mither and got out through the hatch. I was so excited because I wasn't expecting to get it done so soon.
---
&gt;That's just your imaginary rule :) Just get better at finding things
---
DBD moderators said so but have it your way.
---
Clown dlc best dlc? What are you smoking? Because i want some
---
Man I know you‚Äôre just trolling cause I decided to go through some of your posts and saw copious amounts of salty posts+deleted posts. Adorable.
---
Exacly what i thought that you thought that killer mais thought when using noed
---
*exit teabagging intensifies*
---
Dont forget, survivors lose all their points and items they brought when the killer dcs,  atleast on ps4
---
Frustrated but I still have an open mind on the subject
---
Lol yeah sure mate
---
*WHAT DO WE DO WITH A DRUNKEN SAYLOR*
---
   E  E R L A Y I N D A M O U R N I N
---
So this is what its like when worlds collide.
---
I don‚Äôt really find that play style fun, the goal is for both sides to be enjoyable imo
---
I like empathy cause you can tell where the killer is during a chase
---
It's a nice perk. 
---
Situations come up where a self heal without requirements is great. Works best when you play stealthy and outside the hot areas.
---
You seem like a piece of trash. Also, how you gonna do that when I‚Äôm not the killer? Learn to read.
---
Redditshare, someone made a link above
---
But demogorgon is best girl (yes it‚Äôs a she)
---
as much as i like martians i agree playing with them isn't super fun
---
dedicated servers will come eventuallyTM, whatever that means
---
why not make a xenomorph or predator?
---
I‚Äôm always doing this, especially when looking for the last survivor in the match if they are downed. I don‚Äôt know how content creators like monto and ohtofu can hear people so well!
---
Sad bastard. It's not hard to reach Rank 1 at all. It's even easier now than it used to be since they changed the killer pip system.
---
Ah, hank you  ^^ Oh, you will
---
That is what this post is saying
---
nah don't feel stupid I literally never press that button
---
Multi and save the best for last. Highly concerning. Armour would be a really good perk for keeping ruin up for a minimum of 30 seconds and to counter the new Nancy meta.
---
It's not the worst perk you could use. I personally get better use out of bond and iron will though. And these two perks don't equal self care, they give you the benefit of self care along with others.
---
Bond can help get you healed, but help you win. Example, noticing when your teammates are trying to rush one almost done gen while the killer keeps smacking them and guarding it. I have seen those teammates slink off and self heal after each smack. Meanwhile I know its safe to start another gen while they rinse and repeat.
---
The thing with self heal is it takes time off gens. With bond I can just find someone on a gen , finish it hurt and then get a heal. And if we are interrupted I'm confident I'll get away because of iron will.
---
They are adjusting the pallets to make it more like the Freddy map rework where it‚Äôs more mind games and less infinite loops

People say this but I'm a rank 5 killer right now and every scoops steve I face is a damn pro. Like on average much better than the other red ranks I'm facing.
---
So playing a game with my friends means I‚Äôm playing the game wrong? Nice logic buddy better luck next time
---
If we had it your way then the game would literally die. A lot of people find survivor quite unplayable without friends already, and it certainly doesnt help to split into 2 different modes.
---
Honestly legion should just be able to down you with feral frenzy again after he gets stunned
---
Killers do get a bonus to the sac emblem for a survivor DC, equivalent to killing them.
---
It is, I'm sort of dissapointed that I've played the game enough times to recognize that.
---
Oh why?? :D
---
lmao he did hear something he looked at the stairs but the wraith Bell came in handy
---
He has an addon that lets him break pallets when he bangs into them with ‚ÄúShred‚Äù they are going to make it a base ability so he won‚Äôt need an addon for it.
---
&gt;DBD... moderators?
---
Community moderators, people that handle the support.
---
So it‚Äôs random even if you don‚Äôt get it?
---
Yeah I feel like every gen but a small % would be good and promote aggressive play which would make killers with less map pressure more viable.  Like trapper could apply pressure outside his trapped area by downing people.  Even though that seems strong it's better than ruin where you just make it hard for gen progression just for clicking on the perk. 
---
Ruin will always work no matter how good your doing and if you get it in a good spot it's horrible for survivors especially with haunted.  Pop I feel is strong but fair it gives the killer control over the gens to a certain extent and plays into end game really well.  Like I'm not an expert but I tend to play lower tier killers for the fun so ruin is essential as soon as I get to mid ranks.
---
This very horrendous matchmaking right now is actually making it difficult to remotely enjoy the game when you see the postgame results. I do love Dead By Daylight but I really do hope a fix comes extremely soon.
---
Just try again
---
You mean PainReliever?
---
That seems like a nice QoL change that they might be able to work towards after dedicated servers, I only say after cause it maybmake it easier to do on them, I'm not a developer in any way.
---
Oh my god, probably an unpopular opinion here, but i don't care: It's FICTION. F I C T I O N. Nothing is real, this game is about an alien godlike thing grabbing innocent and brutal people from the real world... but you get butthurt over ships? C'mon! I don't support every fanart (there is some really disgusting shit), but leave people their imagination. No one would ever date a killer in the real world anyway (well, there probably are some, but I'm sure the majority of people creating these ships wouldn't).
---
Yoshikage Kira, Reimi survivor
---
Well the way they have the lobbies set up now, I think it should be something they can make. Maybe it‚Äôs just a feature they haven‚Äôt thought about or people didn‚Äôt really suggest. 
---
It‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt live without but a nice feature :)
---
They‚Äôre coming they just got pushed back I think
---
spirit is biggest fucking bitch
---
100 is better than mine. I have to deal with 250ms everyday
---
*No head?* :(
---
Body blocking (not take the game hostage) is a tactic Killers can use to get their power of nore effectively.
---
Secondly vile purge doesn't injure hence why it doesn't remove collision however corrupt purge injures and removes the hit collision.
---
Lastly from reading this it seems this came from a snap of the moment rash reaction to an unfortunate experience rather than a well thought out suggestion which is dumb.
---
Repost
---
Obvious problem: Huntress, Clown, Plague. Lemme just power walk really close to you without initiating a chase friend. This perk helps with chases so much. There's more to life then M1ing.
---
Man, I just wanted to make a meme with that. Thanks  for pre-stealing my idea :c
---
The Halloween pack is the best the game has to offer IMO. The killer is solid and is one most players struggle with as he's such a genuine threat no matter the skill level, The perks for survivors are also great. Decisive Strike is a common pick for survivors and for good reason it's super handy to have and I have seen it save many people in seemingly unwinnable situations, object of obsession is also good as it pretty much means ur gonna get chased more and that gives ur teammates time to do gens or open gates. I dont remember the third perk for survivor so idk if it's all that great.
---
I mean, that's kinda their job. And this kind of stalling isn't the worst, what's really bad is doctors and hags just trying to keep people from playing the game
---
yes, when you see a tier 3 perk take it even if you dont want it to take it out of the pool. Never skip perks its a waste of bp
---
You are right, maybe make structures visible every half second for a half second fade time?
---
Weekly thread is not not there.
---
Thanks bro, I‚Äôll do that
---
I mean before, the game would never end the moment the killer decided to camp on the hatch, but atl i could have gone and start doing the rest of the gens to confuse him/her. There was an appeal to that neverending mind games.
---
Now its death only.
---
Yeah, he did it too. Then there's Aaronplaystv as well. He went in with a whole squad. https://youtu.be/NvJD9Id8xx0
---
The best bit of advice would be to open the exit gate until just before the bar fills to the 'e' in escape so the lights don't come on. Then wait for killer to do rounds again / use power to finish the rest of gate. Usually works unless you're against hill billy or spirit and don't also wait to time finishing with their power not just their patrol. Camping an exit gate and just committing immediately upon activation when last teammate dies instead of looking for hatch is a viable option as well. Then you could always hope for a key in a chest somewhere, but that's so unlikely I wouldn't ever bank on it.
---
Hey I mean it's better then a hatch stand off in my opinion
---
I feel that on a spiritual level man, satellite internet pepega
---
Ps4
---
1- new music is only playing in the main menu, it‚Äôs not playing in lobbies.
---
2- after game ends, tali count loading take forever, I have to close app.
---
3- Unable to cancel game search, lag.
---
no problem, good luck üëã
---
That‚Äôs not necessarily the issue though. The issue is that playing a game where you‚Äôre dominating the survivors in every chase but the gens are popping too quickly. Either gen speed needs to be slowed at red ranks or map design needs heavily modified.
---
As good as pop is, it doesn't have an effect until you've caught someone, which is the crucial time where many gens go off. Same with Surge, even if you proc it on gens early, it's unlikely to hinder more than one.
---
Nothing will ever replace ruin until there's something that gives significant stalling from the get go, (Corrupt Intervention is a horrible example of this though) and even then there has to be a reason to choose it INSTEAD of Ruin rather than AS WELL AS it.
---
I‚Äôve had some situations where survs open an exit gate because I‚Äôm playing some kinda M1 killer with no helpful ability at endgame. Its possible.

If you hover over the survivors names in the lobby you can check the ping they are getting.
---
If you see them with red ping, dodge and check another group. It could just be survivor sided lag and not you but if everyone has red ping against you then you will know it's your connection.
---
Wot M8? I see Ghost Face and Wraith down there in F.. Not Possible
---
But you realize the killer doesn‚Äôt know you exist
---
Yea but I mean he's talking about extremely close gates not two that are pretty far apart.
---
The power is great now! I would love to play this
---
Being rank 20 and getting circles run around you is rough. 
---
Please keep being nice, it's appreciated.
---
Oh god I am having an orgasm as we speak
---
Sprinting away won't matter if I'm a Huntress with good aim.  I'm legit getting a bonus to walking around with hatchets drawn.
---
Is it that common to find a key ? Besides how many chests i can search and rub back to the hactch before timer runs out ?
---
Pop goes the weasel is a god tier perk for demo
---
Other good perks on him are: hex ruin(obviously hex is good on everything), enduring/brutal strength for better chases, make your choice because you can return to hooks very fast to smack the rescuer, and finally that perk that makes gens that are furthest away from you blocked at the start of the game so have time to place portals and turn them into survivor sensors
---
?
---
*heavy sigh*
---
Well i wish i was ok with that too :)
---
Not if you start sprinting. If you're still getting hit then it's just the huntress having good aim. Sprinting in front of a killer initiates a chase and would disable the perk
---
&gt; -time to fully mend yourself is considerably increased
---
double mend legion is bad enough. having a 20 second mend is just annoying
---
If you think original Carrie is a little bad, Novel Carrie destroyed a whole city and was smiling while doing it.

Hang on i know that pfp, I had a friend get harassed by that person on discord bc my friend (and many others) said that spirit fury was a good perk but not unbalanced.
---
This man disagreed so much he sent msgs to him for like an hour without them ever responding. The worst part is we KNEW he had done this before.
---
But in the remake she is good
---
I feel like you're missing the whole "throw the hatchet from afar" thing. I don't need to get close as a ranged killer.
---
I think the ones you‚Äôre talking about are the prestige icons you get for raising a character to level 50 then resetting to level 1.
---
It is not much of a chance when the killer can travel between the gates in like 10 secs :)
---
It depends on luck now, i guess. And im not known for my luck :)
---
I guess that‚Äôs true I was just tryna get me and my friend out the Laurie was a random and It was kinda last minute thinking so I did the first thing that came to mind
---
Used to be able to invite players who were appearing offline too. Damn
---
I think it's prestige, I was confused about it too
---
If the running animation isn‚Äôt a run up and then he skateboards I‚Äôll never play again (Ik it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll be added)
---
I would‚Äôve probably moved but I‚Äôve never had a killer try that and succeeded.
---
but then again you could have packet loss while ping remains good
---
You dont, but if they're hitting you cross map the speed boost wont matter anyways. By the time the speed boost would matter, you can still initiate chase.
---
When I was looking into it, I read it might because you're "altering game files". But then I always see youtubers and streamers that have different icons.

However I do agree we should be focusing on horror icons. Not pop culture skateboard icons lol
---
Thank you :)
---
Door was at 99, i was the only player left, my teammate was downed on the floor. I could have tried to loop her somewhere else, would've done that if i there is a killer in the game that can hit you while bodyblocking a exit panel. Should've just went for the panel straight away instead of trying to dodge it, but the play itself was the right one.
---
Meg‚Äôs goin to be a Meg
---
I just don't think Ruin is fun for either side.  I think a lot of perks are bad mechanically.  Dying light is fucking horrible it promotes tunnelling.  Pop got a buff which is nice but unless they nerf ruin and buff surge and Pop it's not gonna be taken off as essential.  Pop could be good if it blocked the generator for a short time aswell which is strong but still plays into the killer playing around controlling which gens are able to get done.  
---
I know it's a pipe dream but I just prefer being more aggressive as a killer it's more fun for me and perks that reward that seem fairer also as both surge and Pop reward killers for downing survivors.  
---
It's just since playing the clown more I've realised how game changing pop and Surge could be.  Ruin is just a big fuck you to survivors and forces them to find it and if they're good at skill checks it's pointless but pop and Surge are a lot more interactive with the game.  
---
Like I'm only level 60 but I hate the whole "This is the meta" part of this game as I find the fun in finding wacky combos for killers. I straight up refuse to play nurse, Billy or spirit they seem mechanically boring to me (apart from spirit) and one dimensional.
---
Yeah as a killer it‚Äôs great I was just offering a counterpoint to the map being survivor sided. There‚Äôs a lot of space for them to spread out though.
---
Jesus, what's that one commenter's damage?? Imagine caring that much about someone else's decisions on a game. Wild.

Mostly survivor main. In my early days ive decided it is less frustrating to die on the hook compared to being tbagged, blinded, humiliated and moqued :)

Also it wasn‚Äôt intentional at all I had no clue she was behind me

Not even. They're more of a gimp from hell. Nothing special about em

Quit being the kid playing tag who is it who doesn‚Äôt want to be it so they whine
---
I mean... It's just like, clothes
---
Facts I‚Äôve been playing mostly survivor recently to restore the life force that playing killer drained from me lmfao
---
That in my town is called infinity, no matter, it is a waste of time and does not require skill. Devs call it strong loop.
---
i understand, i play an even mix of survivor and killer and i can‚Äôt stand it when your getting a ton of bloodpoints from a game or have a good iten/offering and the killer just disconnects.
---
I don‚Äôt agree, I think this would just make it unfun for the survivors, personally I think if anyone should change for swf it‚Äôs the killer. Maybe a buff but noting should change to the swf
---
I seem to also get it all the time.
---
But if it is a rank 20 killer against rank 1 survivors, then I don't blame the killer for dcing.
---
Also you wont be banned for having dif icons. No one has ever been banned (with proof) from icon changes. Go wild brother
---
Man, everyone hates swf. Yes sometimes they are crap but you would suprised with how many lobbies you encounter that are swf that are just wanting to enjoy a game. There should be no punishment for them trying to have fun with their friends. The only acceptable thing would be to give the killer double bloodpoints for the game. The swf shouldnt be punished at all.
---
welcome! But ignore the jacked up matchmaking, hopefully it will be fixed soon.
---
Fingers crossed.
---
I love you all
---
You can call it whatever in your town but that is not an infinite. If you argue balance then at least use the correct terms. Also very few things in dbd take skill and that shouldn't be the requirement for anything. Otherwise we'd all run perkless and addonless builds.
---
Made me laugh. Have upvote
---
No poiny in watching this video after reading the title. Nice work.
---
Dead by Skrrt
---
That kinda makes it even funnier
---
Dwight‚Äôs gonna locker
---
Finish the generators before that happens üòÅ
---
If a killer dcs you keep your offerings and items. Sometimes it glitches and you lose shit though
---
Damn i forgot a letter. I mean you just didn't read my post correctly, so i corrected you, and told you why i think social skills online are important, cause you'll look like a dick otherwise, i just wanted some friendly discussion, thats all. But have a nice day.
---
They've acknowledged it and are working on a hotfix
---
Or on PlayStation
---
Do u know how fast she is exactly with mother daughter ring and yama amulet
---
Was thinking the same thing
---
Was the only one alive. She could just stay between me and the door while vomiting, only thing i could've done was just run away and die somewhere else.
---
People don‚Äôt play swf to try hard the fuck out of games. Most of the time they just wanna have fun. Plus all the perks you mentioned hardly get used by solo queue anyway. SWF doesn‚Äôt need a balance, quit trying to ruin the fun
---
I agree but i meant camper as best power for camping, at least facecamping
---
Is there an add-on that reduces the charge time?
---
Go back to tumblr.
---
Honestly Nancy levels are a good sub for Claude with how strong inner strength is. Much faster speed for same heals. I will say the BP on BBQ is a good bonus since I really use it for the aura abilities. WGLF is annoying though sometimes since it‚Äôs hard to always be the one going for unhooks just to get some bonus BP. Good luck with the grind though homie, you seem to have your strat figured out
---
Then you don't watch it
---
Dang. I have it on PC but mostly just for the PTBs. So I didn't realize it was that bad. 
---
I wish there was more positivity.
---
I don‚Äôt see a problem
---
Double bloodpoints for what. Like a group of solo queues at high rank can be equally as good. They know if someone‚Äôs getting chased etc. It‚Äôs not that hard to know.
---
I've had my fair share of negativity. Got one not that long ago telling me to kill myself over a bug they got.
---
But I don't get positive messages unless I message first. So I'm going to try and change that. Even if only a little bit.
---
No need for that attitude. You know what i mean with:
---
&gt; if they cheat one thing, they might also cheat something else
---
what do you mean : perform Kills 100% faster ?
---
We'll make it is great in swf but solo it sucks as people just run away.
---
Well if Joel used DS on the clicker it would probably die like in the game
---
Nope, but i know it aint map wide, and has a cooldown
---
I absolutely love "we'll make it" and it's came in clutch several times. My current build since I'm farming blood points is lithe, prove thy self, we'll make it and we're gonna live forever. I don't have borrowed time on my Feng yet but I'll switch out prove thy self for it once I do finally get it
---

---
Something tells me you are onto something üòÄ
---
It‚Äôs you again! I swear we spoke last time, I‚Äôll read them all now and reasses
---
I'd say that would be hard for survivors as well, a time bomb heal is absurd against solo people and good against swf's. How about mend having a rush of skillchecks? Deep wound timer goes down by some amount if you miss, but it's shorter to mend maybe. Like, 5 or 6 skillchecks in a 8-10 second mend that results in a down if you miss 3-4 of them.
---
Social skills as in.... being a keyboard warrior and calling them a ‚Äúdouchbag‚Äù.  Don‚Äôt think you know what social skills are if you‚Äôre calling people names on the internet.
---
Pains me how you never look back
---
Rank reset?
---
First killable killer. Only a Joel with DS can do it
---
Perform a mori at double speed. The game refers to moris as killing
---
I usually do lol
---
You too man. If you're on PC and run into ewokBOOSTEDnuttz that's me. I try to spread positivity even when the match is shit. Also 9/10 times if you see me in usually streaming.
---
Nurse calling , bbq &amp; chili , I‚Äôm all ears and pop goes the weasel
---
Insidious is useless unless you want to be a camper . Bitter murmur is pretty good but bbq is a lot better. Deerstalker is not necessary unless you want to slug all the time and rancor is a decent perk if you can‚Äôt end the game before late game
---
I may be Rank 15, but across the shitty matchmaking
---
I will protect Baby Dweet's across the nation.
---
They say SWF, but I have no friends.
---
When I'm survivor, the killers fun will end.
---
Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't.
---
Good bot.
---
There are times when hiding in a locker is a good idea, but it's a bit of a gamble in a situation like this. Also bear in mind that certain killers, such as the huntress, will go into lockers even if they don't suspect someone is hiding there, so you'll need to extra careful around them.
---
What part of it is convincing? I could just as easily say that you have to compete against other survivors running inner strength. It‚Äôs common to have a teammate or two running it that use up all the totems. Getting a full healing state isn‚Äôt particularly limited, the only actual limit is the number of times you get hooked, which typically you can expect 1-2 times against higher rank players.
---
What the Trapping Fuck?!
---
Im confused, what is the issue here?
---
So SWF=bully?
---
The hero we need but don‚Äôt deserve
---
Oh, right, I forgot about that perk. My problem with it requiring someone is if you are not taking bond you might not find anyone at all. But it absolutely fits his theme and power, that's for sure.
---
What if, when you are deep wounded and out of legion's TR, you can see other survivors auras? That would let you get to them reliably while also letting legion catch multiple people more.
---
Edit: or maybe only not DW'd survivors can see the wounded one, making it a deadly ability if you wound 4 people at one go since no one can see each other
---
So the best perks are locked behind certain killers that you need to buy and level up, or you can take your chances and wait for them on the Shrine to buy with shards. 
---
Just a few perks I like and the killers they are associated with:
---
The Cannibal: BBQ &amp; Chili
---
The Hag: Hex: Ruin and Hex: Devour Hope
---
The Nurse: A Nurse‚Äôs Calling
---
The Hillbilly: Enduring
---
The Clown: Pop Goes the Weasel 
---
Those are just a few of my favorites, but there are many more you can unlock. I recommend this website (https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/killer/) for a good list.
---
Enduring is inarguably one of the best and borderline required perks in the game, though if you just plan to play Spirit it's not really something you'd use.
---
BBQ, Sloppy, Ruin and Nurse's/Whispers/Knockout is disgustingly strong Spirit, MYC also works and Corrupt Intervention isn't bad either.
---
All I think is that the killer should be able to know whether they are a SWF or not. And can dodge the lobby if they don‚Äôt want to play against them. Like yes they can check but some have priv profiles and so on. Like a UI that shows they are SWF.
---
Very nice, how can I support this more?
---
We aren't going to just stop. I find most games are good games regardless of what happens. If a survivor DC's or loses connection and the killer decides to meme around with the rest instead of killing, it's a good game. If someone messes up and ends up getting hooked/sacrificed, at least they tried. It was a good game. If the killer snowballs early game and we all get sacrificed, hey, you won. It was a good game.
---
It's a good game if you don't take it seriously. It's hard to have a conversation on PS4 cause you can't just reply if you get into another match. You have to wait a good 10/15 mins if the killer doesn't snowball or even closer to 20 mins if they can keep survivors off gens. If I had the time, I would definitely have a conversation about the match. But the least a can say is good game to show I had fun.
---
Okay one last time, if you don't want to have a civil discussion, than why comment in the first place ? By namecalling, being rude or sarcastic you start off on the wrong foot, instantly killing the discussion. You started the conversation with a sarcastic remark, which made you seem like a douchebag. If you want to be a douchebag thats fine with me, but since i don't know you, i thought i'd give you some friendly advise, since i couldn't tell wether you just lack social skills, or you're just a dick.
---
I‚Äôd rather not ask The Doctor anything, I hate that guy. 
---
I‚Äôd also like to point out, the new DS, much like the new BT, can be used as many times as it‚Äôs activation condition is met. 
---
I agree, We‚Äôll Make It is a very good perk, but I wouldn‚Äôt usually recommend trying to use it in the basement.
---
xd?
---
So you bought the twitch mask as soon as you started playing
---
Holding on to what I am
---
They feel threatened, the real trick is to say it while t-posing. They will never use it
---
Got hit so hard your game glitched
---
Wait thats actually better than my idea...
---
you can search all of them if you know where they are
---
I don't know the exact change, but I'll guess around 10%
---
What map did you get
---
Nothing really, me just trying to have a discussion about a unfortunate situation that seems like bs to me.
---
Genuinely made me smile :)
---
Maybe the killer will shed some LIGHT on the subject?
---
It‚Äôs mostly random, but there is usually one around the anniversary (June) and one around Christmas. Then they typically do Halloween and Lunar New Year events that net you extra blood points by adding temporary objectives.
---
Your too good for us we don‚Äôt deserve you
---
Happening to me to, do you know if there is any fix?
---
I think not
---
Poor baby bing bong
---
I fixed it
---
I once found a dude saying his main account got banned for icons, went to look at his main and it literally said there it was for hardware scripts. 
---
Anyone who claims to have been banned for perk icons is lying. By technicality you COULD get banned, but EAC doesn't scan/can't detect changes in PNGs or the icon folder and the devs don't give a fuck.
---
\&gt;"Teabagging can be used for tactical reasons too!"
---
\&gt;\*teabags at the exit, when it will have no effect on the killer's behavior, because you know they can't do anything to you\*
---
Legion maxes out pretty much every category easily
---
Ya that could be it.
---
My working theory was that he pounced out of the hospital in the center and some how landed on that rock.
---
I mean, what was the plague doing? They were blocking the exit gate?
---
Wasnt until a friend pointed them out did I know what they meant by scratch marks. I am indeed colorblind
---

---
When you max out play with your food

I want the shape as a killer

Yeah man like I can't play killer bc I barely can see scratch marks! Ruin skill checks are also nearly impossible

Worthy escapade. Good luck OP I hope they put some time into this!

My thoughts exactly ! How would he pick anyone up even especially throw them on a hook?

But then you look back and theres a teabagging ghostface
---
Nea's gotta jump from high
---
I have a legion rework would you like to hear it?
---
Doctor is my BP farming machine. Legion is okay too I guess.
---
I also like Freddy with BBQ, you can just teleport to the generators survivors are working on after you hook someone for shitton of BP.
---
Legion and it's not even close, doctor is only good for farming deviousness
---
Who else straightened their back/neck after this?
---
then why did you teabag? xD
---
I usually respond with positivity and most of the time it‚Äôll change their mood and make them feel better 
---
One time I even got a dude to apologize
---
True. I wish we just had fully functional chase mechanics, but sadly, we dont
---
What do you mean by custom terror radius? I only have played as demo, not against it yet.
---
You absolutely cannot D Strike a killer more than once per match.
---
You double the speed of the animation
---
I had problems with it in another game a while ago. Turned out it was time to clean my pc, everything getting too hot
---
Well yeah, but it wastes time, which is what mending really does. That‚Äôs 20 seconds of them not on a gen or healing or being productive.
---
I did a big juke, it's instinct, i sure as hell didn't feel bad while doing it.
---
Sure
---
Honestly astounds me that this was an issue in the first place, and that it‚Äôs taking this long for it to get resolved!
---
Oh, didn't know that build existed. And wow. Bummer.
---
Michael murders you with a blue shell on the Rainbow Road map.
---
Get off reddit man, I‚Äôm wasting too much of your time. CBA to read that but you say douchebag too many times but at least you remembered the e. Learn something new everyday
---
Why isnt the image upside down?
---
I'd be fine with more BP for playing against SWF, that's all I want. Because playing against 4 man SWF is usually extremely unfun and the games end really fast.
---
Hey, you hopefully learned some social skills, i learned how to spell a word. Have a nice day brother.
---
A lot of the killers have their messages set to private particularly the ones that facecamp with gens up in red and purple ranks.  They enjoy being able to play as skilless and toxic as possible while not hearing about any of it lol.
---
I have switched to survivor main but this is satisfying to watch because I don't get the whole point of teabagging
---
Upvote for visibility (no pun intended)
---
I'm happy because I once Dying Light gets fixed I'll run it over Ruin and not have to stress about survivors finding and breaking my totem ever again!
---
Freddy‚Äôs pretty good
---
Ace's yeet off hooks
---
That could work for the not Dw survivors,the vice versa would only lead to the usage of Hex:The third seal being used often.
---
I usually try if I know what the problem was. Like with the bug. The person had a medkit. They should have realized they had a bug. But instead they took it out on me. Which, I'm usually cool with. Sometimes you need to let it out. But I don't ever condone any sort of threat or violence.
---
My partner and I try our best to talk things out, but sometimes the other person doesn't want to listen. Especially if they happen to be a kid.
---
There are only 3 ping options: 60, 400 or 1000.
---
sounds to me like SWF is the only playable mode for survivors
---
As of right now I know of no fix. I'm sorry.
---
The only one not mentioned so far here is Monitor and Abuse. The lower terror radius combined with smart movement means you will often catch survivors out of position much easier.
---
Surveillance can be a great perk as well
---
As a fellow member of the colorblind community I support this message
---
Not if they literally disconnect from their network, at least I don‚Äôt think so, but I guess survivors can do the same now that I think about it...
---
Feng's gonna fast vault
---
Alot of bugs came with the dlc
---
*‚Äúnah not crisp enough yet‚Äú*
---
Yes as you rank up this perk almost counts as a 5th killer perk.  Everytime I play killer I hope Self Care is in my lobby.  With how aggressively I play to pressure gens it is quite nice being able to hit a player once and knowing I just took them out of the game for a minute while they waste 15 seconds finding a spot and another 40 seconds healing themselves.  If you're self caring you ain't repairing gens.  That's why killers enjoy the perk and teamates hate it.  As you rank up Self Care will flat out cost your team games at times.  I've seen it time after time.
---
lol, sometimes me and my swf buddies do this. we call it "map roulette" :D
---
Yeah but is she faster than his chainsaw while using it I know he is faster overall but I dunno
---
I'm so glad to see the large influx of pro colorblind setting posts on this sub. It must be so frustrating to play a game and never be at your full potential because devs decided to make everything important red.
---
Me when I see spirit.

The rapture has begun

***I AM THE LORD YOU PEASANT SURVIVORS***
---
Rank 14 Level 34 Legion here. Got matched with rank 8s last match and a 2 purples and a rank 3 Shadow Claudette before it. I'm actually learning and managed to win thanks to endgame collapse and and a dc but it's fucked up.
---
i always message the rank 20 killers with a gg wp
---
Me and all my red rank friends went up against several rank 20s, I felt really bad for them and ended up letting the Endgame kill me. I didn't make it to Rank 1 to bully babies ;(
---
Well actually survivors have the advantage its proved by oztrada
---
The best reworks with his power involve changing the rewards for using his power. I always thought the best rewards would be stackable with how many chain hits you get; first hit is mend, 2nd is mend+30second broken post mend, 3rd and 4th are instadowns.
---
This makes them more dangerous if they use their power well without rewarding tunneling
---
What racism?
---
Should‚Äôve put ‚Äúfunny‚Äù but you do you

XD Thanks for the laugh this morning.
---
That I think would just punish swf. They wouldn't be able to find a lobby and would therefore cause them to not play the game. I personally only play survivor as swf or a daily, and have quite a bit of friends that only play swf. I only play killer when solo. Without that they would not play the game and I'm certain there are plenty of others in the same boat. Especially on console swf is a very big part of the community. And if they ruined that by allowing killers to dodge lobbies, or by giving them the option to not get swf it would be detrimental to the game. There are an abundance of people who play together that are not "toxic" it's just the select few who are toxic that get exposed and gives swf a very bad name.

dwight: no my child, keep your head down. you must not stare directly at it

Serial is usually used these days for something that is a direct continuation episode to episode, where each one picks up directly after the other. Something like 24, where every episode is the same day.
---
Or, more commonly, to describe old theatrical serials from the 30s/40s
---
Ah. I don't pay attention to emblems (they give insultingly little XP, anyway) so I hadn't noticed.
---
I also just don't get many D/Cs with my Common addons.
---
My daily reply to a daily shitpost about color blindness:
---
Fix the matchmaking and disconnects that you made so horrible this patch while you‚Äôre at it
---
I actually had a match last night like that. I was the spirit and both gates were 6 seconds apart from each other. I felt bad for the guy. He ended up dcing which I don't understand because he lost everything
---
Thx you like it
---
Oh i didnt see it when choosing the flair
---
I've let every obsession go when I play Micheal. Since we're technically on teams.
---
Books are really fun to read and destroyinh them only reminds me of Hitler...
---
Armour is a bit op. Hexes are supposed to have a strong effects but survivors are able to get rid of them. You need to protect them to make them stay. This perk basically allow hexes to last whole game even if you don't care about them.
---
First one's just hilarious, the other one is accurate
---
Oh okay
---
Real reason why I play killer tbh
---
It can be that you dc'd but you don't know bcoz the game says the host but the match is not over, it happens too much in this dlc
---
I have absolutely zero idea what‚Äôs going on
---
I legitimately looped this guy at a pallet for 3 gens with ruin worth of time because he was so dedicated to only using his chainsaw, finally he decided to M1 and got me away after that time
---
It was one of those tiny loops in the hallway on the new map
---
Hahaha, I do that
---
Yeah, but I'm not talking about balancing the match, just giving people their due compensation after it. If you had things like Survivors' genspeed getting faster on teammate D/C, SWFs would abuse that constantly and probably bully randoms to ragequit.
---
NO NOT THIS SUB TO
---
Not just Nea fam
---
The ultimate [REDACTED]
---
yea that would look stupid
---
 Does anyone else see Meg in Rachel Mcadams .. just a little ? .. no ?
---
The Hawk. Kills with a skateboard. Performs sick ollies over pallets &amp; windows.
---
why do your icons look different??? also i love those types, chances are they are all a group
---
Who doesn't
---
I'm decent with spirit and a pretty good ghost face.
---
Doom and death engravings tho
---
The only reason the loop lasted that long is because he was only willing to use his chainsaw, it was the world's smallest unsafe loop and finally after literally ages he decided to M1
---
It was literally those tiny ass loops in the hallway on the new map
---
How is it my fault he didn't just use M1 for 3 minutes
---
Not when it's done for long stretches of time with the goal of not progressing the game.  If all the survivors doing is hiding and not touching a gen period they aren't playing to progress the game to any sort of end.  They are holding the game hostage if it's done too long and is reportable.  They do it with the intention of causing a killer to DC which is a violation so no they aren't meant to only hide from the killer.
---
I just bring Commons every game so I can't lose anything of value.
---
Besides my smile and my optimism.
---
It would, but who cares
---
The example subtext really cracked me up
---
I mean, I guess he was a kid at one point right
---
Lol hes just salty he lost his flashlight probably
---
It's a resource pack, like the ones for minecraft
---
C A L C U L A T E D
---
How? It allows one hex perk at random to be given a second shot. You cleanse it, it appears elsewhere. Then it's done if you cleanse it again.
---
So you're saying I'm supposed to DC?
---
I only started teabagging after being apart of this sub as a way thanking players for unhooking me or healing me. Otherwise I don't bother, not trying antagonize anyone mainly because I know I'm nowhere near any good.
---
How the fuck does git gud come into play when the opponent is literally not playing the game.  They are intentionally not doing objectives or anything that would lead to progression or the games conclusion.  They do it to hold the game hostage and you on here defending it just makes you look like a fucking idiot.
---
I think he gives a fuck
---
&gt;granted i cant tell if its there 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
If only they would INCREASE THE IN-GAME CAP.
---
And make WGLF DO anything in-game so you're not a cretin for running it by default.
---
Opposite for me. They always seem to run when I try to heal them
---
Why it look like you dated the killer? Also, dating the legion would be wonderful, imagine the posible gang bang that they all could do
---
He knows he just doesn't care.
---
Not really relevant though, is it
---
I mean, you should heal when the killer is close and you're going for the unhook, but you don't need to be healed up for doing gens nor for saving when the killer is chasing someone else
---
Self Care makes you used to being healed up so much, that some people would rather spend 40 seconds healing up instead of finishing the last gen WHEN THEY HAVE ADRENALINE. You're better off not running Self Care and getting used to being injured
---
That would certainly be appreciated by a lot of people
---
then play them, make sure you run the m1 killer build with enduring spirit fury with no and ruin.
---
And if you play ghost face, always try to get a grab or a mark because otherwise you aren‚Äôt really making the most of your power. Spirit when phase walking just look for moving grass to spot people or test for collision by actually bumping into them
---
They‚Äôre playing the game you‚Äôre just not finding them before they do gens. They do them inevitably because four people won‚Äôt waste their time for one person you‚Äôre not that special. They are playing mind games with you to annoy you and make you rage quit and you‚Äôre playing right into their game. I love doing shit like this myself but as the killer. Like making people play into the basement for example.
---
You‚Äôre clearly hurt by such a simple mind game in a video game maybe you should find a better game to play as you clearly can‚Äôt handle a little trick to make you give up.
---
I mean I really felt like we bonded. It was a date.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
In Identity V, the "gens" are blue.
---
I thought DbD should emulate that before I knew the game was basically unplayable for a ton of people.
---
We already have a skateboarding killer
---

---
Literally saved by the bell
---
I always love how they hate your clutch perks and meta perks and yet run only clutch and meta perks themselves.
---
Then enjoy, try to date another time I guess
---
One can hope, if not I'm not buying the Switch port
---
That's not an imaginary rule that's a real one from the games devs lol!  You aren't allowed to only hide with no intention of progressing the game or touching an objective.  15 mins of that on record is an easy ban.  Holding games hostage isn't allowed.  Look it up legend.
---
Please don't make my queue times twice as long.
---
I‚Äôm gonna date every Legion I see. This one person really changed my ways and turned fear into bliss. Wowee
---
This matters why?
---
Trying to have fun?
---
Get out.
---
she‚Äôs on there, just REALLY hard to spot
---
Piggy the GOAT
---
Don't let them get under your skin, you can get banned for what you said if they decide to report you
---
Fuck you too
---
Yeah, I find playing killer the most efficient way of getting more bloodpoints, you will also need BBQ and chili :)  
---
there is a double bloodpoint event going on next week starting thursday so I would suggest saving all your bloody party streamers and survivor pudding from leveling up and use it on the event :D
---
Survivors takes no skill ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èjust saying
---
People seem to forget that once a killer main complained the game was too frustrating and the devs told him to play something else
---
I hope you know not hooking people is a tactic to kill everyone Doctor isn‚Äôt being a dick. It is confirmed you cannot be banned for slugging. There‚Äôs a reason your decisive has a cooldown and there‚Äôs a reason he wants four downs over a hook that gets saved while he goes for the others. It‚Äôs for the better of him time wise but you also don‚Äôt lose one of your three hooks and can get revived fast if you heal yourself 99% so I don‚Äôt know why a low tier killer bothers you even at his most toxic he‚Äôs still simple to counter.
---
Mods and admins are becoming more like ‚Äòdictators‚Äô every day across Reddit. Honestly there‚Äôs too many rules here because of investments in the company
---
I think I see what you mean. Self care isn't necessary with adrenaline since both heal you up.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
I've seen some people say urban evasion is too situational to be worth it, would you disagree with that?
---
Grinds over pallets and ollies through windows
---
Bots would be great, but one person said that if bot games existed, 75% of the playerbase would vanish into them, and honestly I think it's true and BHVR knows it.
---
Forget trying to make PvP more appealing, just deny anyone the freedom to practice. Punish the KYF with no income, too.
---
Teabagging and doing the moonwalk are my go-tos
---
and stating his name wasnt enough?
---
I really don't care what you have to say if u are that condescending. Bye :)
---
Yea I did know there was an event, I'm planning on making a legion build to farm it which is partly why I'm trying to level killers now
---
5 gens are left, if they haven't completed one then the hatch won't spawn. Basically gens left plus survivors should equal 5 or less at any time for the hatch to spawn.
---
Nancy‚Äôs gonna totem
---
I'm happy I haven't run into too much hate as a new player.
---
Wild, bitches!  YEE-HAW!
---
Fair point
---
Pretending I'm a Superman!
---
It‚Äôs fun if you playing solo survivor with OoO because then with 3 people dead you can see the killer and he can‚Äôt see you. It was fun when the hatch stand offs were a thing because I would bang out the gens while they camped the hatch and then make my escape.
---
Really ?? I'd have thought Freddie or demi would be better ?
---
Lol I was playing as meg but yes you were in my game XD

There's a streamer (the name is escaping me) that was ## rank, devotion 7. That's the highest I've seen to date.
---
I've loved the big name survivors they've included lately, but honestly Tony Hawk outta nowhere would actually make me consider playing survivor more
---
Hatch spawning and opening at 5 gens is a way for the killer to force the game to end, not necessarily a free escape for survivors even though it can work that way. 
---
Would you rather have a survivor holding the game hostage because he can't possibly repair 2 gens while you patrol it so he just hides?
---
Probably not, but making red marks green would do nothing for people with red-green colorblindness and would make things worse for people with blue-yellow colorblindness (these are by far the most common forms of colorblindness), so what would be the point?
---
Basically all the maps are at least a little survivor sided. Hawkin's Lab has a shitton of good pallets and some long loops. I haven't tried played Billy/Cannibal on it yet, but I'd probably think about DCing. 
---
Demogorgon's pretty good though, obviously. It is a little funny to me that all the clutter and tight corners and pallets/loops that are close to each other kind of make Shred on Hawkin's Lab difficult, but at least it's not chainsaw bad.
---
&gt;Hatch spawning and opening at 5 gens is a way for the killer to force the game to end
---
Id disagree, considering the killer can open the gates

I think a fuck gives him

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d7slx7/is_there_a_list_of_all_the_bugs_in_the_current/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Your probably right
---
&gt;Id disagree, considering the killer can open the gates
---
You can only open the gates once all gens have been done.
---
You just have to close it now they removed the hatch grab as a small concession to survivors since the new hatch favors the killers heavily.
---
wow, you made all of his perks and add ons references to bands and songs. that's really impressive.
---
#N O
---
I like the new welcome home, I think you did a good job wording don't stop me now and it seems good now, I think now that you changed wasted time to be able to free up the generators it's better but I think the explosion should be less percent, 20/30/40. Wonderful work on the add-ons, I like the queen reference, and honestly this is tremendously well thought out and mega props.
---
&gt;the killer isn't just gonna let you go.
---
But I'm supposed to let him kill me?
---
Didn't notice that it had been removed. Never even think about it. Not often if they all die quickly does one get the hatch.
---
I'm rank 6 and keep getting three rank 20 - 14s I'm thinking it must be a bug or something it's been shocking since the last update. Then when I play killer I'm matched against rank 1 - 4s or a complete set of 20s.
---
i just dump all my points into killer and loot with ace in the hole/plunderers instinct
---
Right is probably me
---
Welp that's what I've learned what tunneling is. Apparently the killer goes after you after you've been unhooked even when there's someone else right there.
---
To add to this, as a red green color blind I can not for the life of me track survivors with the red stain on the ground/ walls.
---
I am only able to play survivor without getting so frustrated by tracking invisible bullshit.
---
Concur I do
---
BBQ essentially xD I think we have here a killer who plays only the 4 brother's.
---
Brother 1 ruin 
---
Brother 2 BBQ
---
Brother 3 enduring
---
Brother 4 spirit fury
---
The easiest and no brainer build available for killer. Just press W and run into pallets.
---
 
---
Where telling us that a perk that give you information is basically essentially, when you still have discordance/thrilling tremors which are both god tier.
---
Even ruin is dispensable, you only need to play differently, - tunnel vision + pressure on every survivor(fuck huges chases/1 pallet drop and change target/know when to rotate and when to slug)
---
cringe no kek
---
K it is two parts but first Instead of buying cosmetics to look like a different member cosmetics well be slightly altered to fit the body type and personality of all the members. When chosing perks or skins they will and be lined up and any cosmetic changes affect all of them. A example julies skin and mask will appear on all of them but a different body shape no hair and no skirt but frank would have brass knuckles and tears on his version while joes he would have a hockey stick and shoulder pads from hockey, and susie would have a braclet on a necklace and a single braid sticking out. Slight changes. Also the bracelet, brass knuckles,hockey stick, and susies wrench will be added to all of there skins along with what I mentioned and julie will always have a skirt and hair sticking out. Also like leather face killing dweet claudete meg and jake 150 will get you a skin set called‚Äù party animals‚Äùwith each character looking drastically different then another but they‚Äôll all be in normal close and no legion mask or hoodies instead. Before i go on one of legions abilities allows them to loose red stain and raduis and take off if they have it on them there mask. If you want to hear more please tell me because there are going to be dractic changes and if you like were Im heading Ill continue
---
&gt; the map has so many unsafe pallets that you can just mindlessly bloodlust
---
Due to the amount of pallets, even if all of them were unsafe you wouldn't be able to "mindlessly bloodlust" anyway because pallet stun breaks bloodlust. And like I said, obviously a lot of them are safe pallets so...
---
jesus.
---
your a lucky man.
---
Yea but it takes so less effort to p3 one char so it could mean everything or nothing
---
I just think that maybe Gorgon needs some kinda Insta Down addon that allows him to apply more pressure to Survivors or something or penalize Survivors for Cleansing Portals which in return makes them less encouraged to do so thus giving Gorgon more map pressure.
---
Inner strength
---
im confused because when i played demogorgon trying to use the shred too early just made me do a normal m1 hit
---
You only lose bloodlust if you kick or get stunned by the pallet though? And fair enough but when me and my friends get that map as killer it‚Äôs a easy win for us lol. Then again I usually always win in the game map as killer as well
---
nope just recovery time from a missed lunge
---
I would like to here More
---
Well see a bunch of instadown add-ons shouldn't even exist in the first place I mean look at how broken iridescent huntress is or pinky finger clown, instadowns aren't fun, for penalities they already have it which is wasting time not doing generators and showing your location to him. The demogorgons perfectly fine he doesn't need instadowns or anything.
---
Yeah happens to me when I‚Äôm in per game lobby, restart your game and it might improve
---
I believe the term is called "butt dancing"
---
Reminds me of otzdarva's video, where he used monstrous shrine and survivor still kobed in front of his face
---
I was doing the gen in the furnace room in Springwood and the killer had ruin. I think that's about as close as a non colourblind person can come to getting it, because I couldn't see that bar for shit.
---
Dbd comes out on switch in 2 days!
---
NO
---
It's the current version as far as I'm aware. Stranger Things and all. Dedicated servers are still being rolled out IIRC, i.e. the process has been started but isn't taking place in 100% of matchmaking, might be different for the Switch though, haven't heard.
---
The biggest difference between buying the Switch version and the current version on Steam is that the Switch version "includes 9 killers and 10 survivors to choose from and 3 cosmetic packs." (From the store page)
---
Not 100% on which killers are included but my guess is that it'll be all the non-licensed DLC chapters.
---
So Changing the killer color from red to yellow would allow color blind people to see hooks and stuff better?
---
I‚Äôm not upset, I just want to know why
---
Ahem
---
Paging /u/not_queen_bhvr
---
Paging /u/Peanits
---
I swear they change it with every update idfk why lol
---
Paging /u/Mclean_bhvr
---
You've already lost twice up to this point by not repairing the generators and finding the hatch first.. Unless you find a key or manage to open the door before the killer gets there, you've lost.
---
Far too reasonable and pro-consumer. Why would BHVR do that when they know people will treat them like gods for selling them gameplay as dlc and overpricing skins?
---
Paging /u/Mcote_bhvr
---
Well. This answer works well enough for me. Thanks.
---
Paging /u/DeviusQC
---
Myers + complex. Really deadly if you play it right :)
---
Played with Myers on that map WITHOUT perks/Add-ons. Can confirm he's a beast, especially on the part where the bridge is broken. You can get from tier 1 to tier 3 easily, because they can't really hide anywhere.
---
Adam's gonna kobe unless they get hooked first
---
But I‚Äôm just saying hi to other survivors
---
Who are all these people you're talking about? 
---
I solo queue and mostly play survivor and it's fine. I can understand getting frustrated with the mechanics and the severely unbalanced perks, items and add-ons (that exist on both sides) but at the end of the day your points gain and progression are largely in your hands. Sometimes you get hooked first and tunneled into oblivion and that's always unfortunate but that's the killer literally doing what the game has tasked them with doing and you're always at risk of that happening when you join a game. 
---
You shouldn't play the game expecting either side to "go easy" or play by an imaginary ruleset that prevents them from being "scummy." Expect them to try-hard and use every advantage available to them and adjust your playstyle accordingly. (ie; expect BBQ, ruin, nurses calling, devour hope and NOED, adrenaline, dead hard, Deliverance, borrowed time, insta heals, clicky flashlights, and at this point every survivor team to have comms, etc.)  After all, don't you go into most matches with the intention of trying to win? Unless you're trying to meme, of course. 
---
There is a vastly misunderstood conception about this game, and that is the illusion that "the other side" isn't balanced. The reality is that this game, overall, isn't balanced... But that's a whole other conversation.
---
The intention behind the design of the game, is for everyone to feel as if they are on their own. That is the most balanced way to play the game. Even still, I can understand wanting to play with your friends for the fun of it, but due to the competitive nature of the game (it literally has a ranking system that is unavoidable in a public space.) it gives a severely unfair advantage to the survivors using comms... I think that it's fine to queue with your friends, but there should be a handicap applied to the survivors points gain and the killer should gain the difference of that handicap plus a set bonus depending on how many are in the swf group. The killer should also be aware at the start of the match that they are against an swf group and which members of the team are queued together. They shouldn't be allowed to dodge the match, but will at least be aware of what they are up against and know that they will at least get a bonus in points. Any survivor not queued with the group should gain points as normal.
---
Oh jeez that could be me, how embarrasing.
---
Clipping through the exit gates is a known bug /:
---
Lavender would work better for people with Protanomaly and Deuteranomaly because some realms have a yellow tint but yellow would work better than red unless you have tritanomaly, yes.
---
No its fucked, the dev's are robbing us for money without fixing priority issues first.
---
The dev(Matheiu Cote) actually told him "maybe you're tired of it try survivor or maybe even try another game like civilization 5 for a bit" people  always misinterpret what Matheiu said he wasn't saying "oh go play another game go away" or something like that he was just trying to help and maybe say he's playing killer too much and tired of it he should switch and try other stuff maybe
---
Well no at least try, either way your dead
---
It‚Äôs literally a game, don‚Äôt get so worked up over it man.
---
I agree with you like Billy and bubba has the power for instant down because it takes skill to land most of the time. Ghostface and Myers have to stalk you to get you exposed tho Myers can expose all Ghostface only does one at a time. Thoes make Sence for their powers. I play demogorgon and he doesn't need instant downs to me he seems fine think would like maybe a lesser cooldown on his traversing the upside down to apply better gen pressure from across the map
---
Unfortunately those first two perks kinda encourage tunneling (the second one less so). Cool idea for a killer tho
---
Not specifically the terror radius just the chase music, but only when they activate their power. Fun fact though, Demogorgon has 2 different tracks, 1 when you're playing as Demo and a different one when you're being chased by a Demo.
---
I fucking hate Andy
---
I think it's across all platforms because it happens on PC too. It's so frustrating to go through a long wait time just to have a survivor disconnect during the long ass load screen.
---
Hag is a pretty good killer if you understand how to use her traps but spirit and others are much more powerful
---
Wow, this for real?
---
I have no idea how they‚Äôd implement him but imagine if they did.
---
He‚Äôll 360 flip to 5050 your face
---
It does help but it's more of a band-aid than an actual solution. The problem with NVidia Game Filters is it's just that- a full-game filter. You can't specify which specific shades, colors and objects you want filtered, it just applies over everything.
---
Which means the sky turns purple and grass turns yellow, which kinda ruins the aesthetic of the game if that's something you care about.
---
And on top of that, there's no such feature for console players, so they're SOL.
---
PC.
---
Urban is a good perk, but it has bad reputation, because many people crouch around too much when they have it.
---
as long as you don't crouch around when the killer is on the other side of the map, you're fine with it
---
Sorry man, I‚Äôm on PS4. Good luck though
---
Do the generator in the tiny room upstairs completely and survive. That's one.
---
Jerk
---
Jajaja Le Epic kek
---
Lol
---
I'm probably gonna sound like one of those whiney bitches, but Shred really needs to have some form of a counter.
---
Sure you can turn a corner, but what's gonna do when the demo gets a speed boost across the map to hunt for you?
---
Pretty broken atm.
---
This is wrong information/outdated
---
Bruh
---
*Game crash sound effect*
---
I know people frown upon but if I use noed can I one shot while in feral frenzy, and what are tokens and how do I get them? I see this perk saying survivors cleansing speed is reduced by 6%, what is cleansing?
---
I mean, that's about all clickers are able to do in the Last of Us. It's just based around LOU gameplay
---
We shouldn't have to do that there should be a setting in game for it because of how big the game is
---
i was here for the memes but you genuinely won me over. Why hasn't BHVR made colorblind settings? It seems like such an easy fix.
---
If someone disconnects and hatch spawns where there body is, it won't actually materialize even though you can hear it
---
I know it‚Äôs just we‚Äôve seen this with billy, bubba, and now Demo, I don‚Äôt disagree they‚Äôre fairly 1 dimensional mobs but you know, the rest is cool
---
take my upvote good sir
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had that happen before but this wasn‚Äôt it, after I had downed the last survivor the hatch spawned
---
I know! There shouldn't be hosting system as and there should be a greater punishment for DCers but what can you do?
---
Practically all of the windows and pallets can be lunged around tf they mean lmao. Upstairs in that map has like n o mind games
---
Yes that is a loadout alright
---
Honestly Hex needs a percentile chance of having a normal skill check, rather than fail 99 times in a row, just to see the killer awaiting you to look up.
---
If a huntress is Rank 1 I doubt they need Iri Heads
---
Nancy became a trapper with Johnathon at the finale of the 1st season.
---
what dat mouth do
---
I play swf all the time and I don't try hard I just go to have fun no one really tryhards in this game except killers I've seen more killers DC than survivors because the killer couldn't get a kill
---
Thanks most people don‚Äôt like this idea but back to the skin and then ability. 
---
Ok so for the head its susie wearing make up and hear braided for a party,Julie wearing a beanie with some makeup on but not much(remember it says shes susies Shy friend), joe with his hair normal but some stubble and Im assuming you know this but joes the only black member of the group everyone else is white so when thinking of these skins remember this, anyways Frank has his sides shaved with hair on top( he sort of looks like 8 bit ryans hair) he has a scar on his eye a broken nose and wearing glasses. For body susie is wearing a dress and skinny jeans to attract attention, julies wearing jeans with a short sleeved shirt covered in oil grease and paint form creating and fixing stuff fir susies party, joe is wearing a hockey uniform from his game his jersey has number 2 on it, frank is wearing ripped jeans and a bloody muscle shits with rips a glove on his left hand bruised knuckle on his right with brass knuckles and tattoos on his right. As for weapons frank has a shard of glass, joe a sharp blade from his hockey shoes, susie a beer bottle opener, and julie a wrench. 
---
There abilities are legions mask, YES I said abilities, let me explain, you randomly start as one of the four every time you land 4 hits you automatically change to another member each member has a different power except for the shared power to click ghost faces crouch button,loose there terror radius and red stain take of there mask if they have one and stab a survivor dealing deep wound exiting this mode and being alerted of the closest survivor without deep wound. The other half is all of there personal abilities I know all but susies so if you can help me with susies that would be great. =D
---
The exposed effect that comes with noed does not work on feral frenzy.  There are some perks that use a token system, for example, barbecue and chili is a leatherface perk, each time you hook a survivor you see all other survivors auras, and when you hook each survivor, you gain a token that gives you a bonus to all scoring categories. And cleansing is regarding totems, five totems spawn on each map. If you use a hex perk such as ruin, the totem will be lit and when the totem is cleansed the perk will deactivate and can no longer be used.
---
his flair answers it all.
---
moment killer is led on a chase in a busted zone and the otherwise quickly relieve pressure on them (picked up if slugged, unhooked) they work on gens and smash em out
---
Maybe later if you're on. I could use the training with looping and such so it would be helpful for us both.
---
Someone has to escape to tell the tale. :)
---
Never happens for me
---
I wish we could do more with them. LOU is my favourite game, so I wish the infected were more varied
---
Only happens a lot at low ranks
---
Yeah your shitty explanation of what the hatch does doesn‚Äôt really change that i think its a bad mechanic.
---
Guys, he doesn't have eyes...ü§£
---
&gt; If you really are a good killer you wouldn't be looped for so long, you should be able to get a hit at almost every pallet. 
---
And if you are a good survivor, you wouldn't be downed so quickly and be able to loop longer.
---
&gt;  All I'm trying to say is that this is a game, and that sometimes being a decent person is better thay ruining someones game.  
---
1. You're literally calling someone toxic because of another person's fault, do you really think decency is something you should talk about?
---
2. So you would want to ruin your own game just so you don't ruin another person's game? 
---
&gt; players are tasked with making that purpose fun and somewhat time consuming 
---
Yeah, sometimes a 4K means fun for the hunter, so why would one sacrifice their own happiness for others?
---
&gt; no one likes a game that ends in five minutes because the objective was handed to them 
---
Well I think most people like games when they win so duration is only a small factor of that. That being said, if survivors do die within five minutes then yeah, it's understandable that they would be extremely pissed.  I think the duration of a game matters more only when you are losing so yeah.
---
Tbh, I slightly agree with what you are saying but it's just that your argument is just no offence, really bad.
---
Well they are working on the dedicated servers so a few more months through fall then we will have them hopefully. But the reason DC's aren't punished so much is because they don't have the server info weather the person lost connection or purposely DC which once dedicated servers come then the punishments will be more harsh rather than losing 2 pips
---
Sure...
---
I guess I'm just confused since it's the only perk in the game that does something like that.
---
I started following some really nice streamers!
---
It‚Äôs not okay.
---
Not even, I respect killers
---
I just had a game where I was ranked with a rank 3 and two yellow ranks. I‚Äôm rank 8 atm (4 is my highest). Of course the yellow ranks were terrible, they were probably new, but the rank 3 was also garbage. No offense to any of them but I‚Äôm the only one who could loop the Billy for the gens to get done. I had the gate open and I was going to try to be altruistic even though I could‚Äôve just left but I died, and he got a charity 4k. If gens hadn‚Äôt been done he‚Äôd have gotten the charity 4K because my teammates are bad and that‚Äôs bullshit to me. Hatch is fine as it is.
---
Most maps are killer sided.
---
Im redgreen deficient and  run bloodhound in all builds. The shimmer really helps!
---
Got hit so hard your screen broke
---
Smh
---
Not based on the map design.
---
Neither of these things are responsible for the matchmaking being bugged out right now lmao
---
Mindbreaker\*
---
This is why I hate playing killer, scratch marks are crucial in a chase and I can never see them.
---
Playing against Ruin is a little harder too, but if I can put the skill check wheel in front of something like a tree to increase contrast, it helps a lot
---
Yeah all my teammates have been dumbasses, even the low ranks
---
Where did i say that? :) the killer didn't behave nicely at the end..but then...anyway, its not like, he gained anything from slugging you, take out your phone, and deal with it... No point in overreacting to it.
---
I hate to break it to you, but new players coming to the game are the reason we get the community we have. Be welcoming, be a good sport and if you realise they‚Äôre new, hell, help them to learn the game. 
---
The more this community grows, the better it becomes! More popular DLC like stranger things and our fave game gets the recognition it deserves!
---
Jeff is gonna Breakdown
---
Thanks mate found it
---
This was pretty entertaining :)
---
No disrespect, but I don't understand how this actually interferes with colorblind players. Red/orange tends to clash with most if not all map color schemes, so even if they can't make out the actual color, I would assume that it would be visible enough to tell that something is there? Maybe it's just the way OP described it. If any colorblind players would like to explain to me in greater detail what exactly causes issues for you (and how other games tend to handle colorblind mode to fix issues like this) I would be greatly appreciative. I don't doubt that it causes issues, I'm just currently failing to see it in a way that makes sense to me.
---
Look at the skill involved in those mindgames
---
Classic trapper. Getting gen rushed while he's picking up his traps :(
---
Relatable
---
the dlc itself is great, the patch is a dumpster on fire.
---
I totally feel this
---
Bruh, not only do you play SWBFII but you play DBD too. Perfect.
---
Balanced Landing exists, either way I despise that map on either side
---
I am color blind myself and advocate for this - I have it due to myopia side effects. I think they have an assumption that people will use it somehow to their advantage who aren't color blind or need to use it - happens in games like PUBG etc. where people change colors for better visibility - Just a thought
---
Bro, this 100%
---
I didn't get salty but most of the time, me, at Rank 20 will get matched with people at Rank 10 or below (9/8/7/etc). It's heavy.
---
smart, I'm on console and don't know how to view the connection strength other than the red, yellow, green meter in game lobby.
---
Literally me! F
---
Binge watched it 4 days before ptb
---
Forgot to mention, just had a game where I couldn't self heal, wiggle or see the progress bars on healing others/gens. Oh and games crashing
---
It does encourage tunneling because that's the fastest way to eliminate a survivor and start gaining benefits from the perk. It's not as bad no, but it's still not in the direction the devs want to take perks from now on
---
I only look at the survivors if I'm thinking of putting Franklin's on. Otherwise I'm just thankful to get a lobby
---
Thats not the point. [OC] should be reserved for an actual picture they produce. Such as a drawing or photo they've taken. This isn't [OC].
---
Why do they delete the post for that? Not that I know of, but the bugs I know off hand are the matchmaking system, dying light making you crash after getting a certain number of stacks (varies but usually between 5-7), a lot of healing glitches but that‚Äôs been here, and the only other one I could think of is I have heard complaints of BBQ and WGLF not giving the bonus bloodpoints. Haven‚Äôt had that one personally, but my friends have and it‚Äôs weird.
---
Increases chances in unhooking yourself and better loot in chests
---
That's why I died inside when I heard the rework idea. Protection hits are buggy as fuck and are a hassle to get. The perk died hard the second it got changed, whose to say it even works now? I would have preferred any other change but this one. Now its just another dead perk in the pile.
---
Hook escapes and getting out of bear traps... it's stupidly pointless imo
---
Look at spirit. I think death wouldn't have stopped them from being in the game.
---
And I was joking about nea being the entity/killer
---
Doing is concur you
---
Joke's on you, I only start lagswitching  with 3 gens left
---
I think that's the point of the circle.
---
Op*
---
She bodyblocked while attacking, which makes every other killer in the game lose collision. The gate was 99% so i needed a quick tap, and i was fully healed, so i would've escaped. Just an unfortunate play, since i had no idea she would still have collision even when vomiting. Had i known i would've escaped, but anyway, thats about it.
---
Yeah, hard to have fun things in games like this without having a million exploits that everyone abuses
---
Pretty much. Unless you have 4 people stacking vigos jar of salty lips and everyone running up the ante.
---
You don‚Äôt control a map against rank 1 survivors, you can find infinite proof of that watching the best killers on twitch
---
at least the game has a bunch of safe pallets. Hawkins feels like the game before they changed how pallets were on it.
---
Hopefully Moss is replaced by a cool and fun addon.
---
I had a killer leave because we cleansed Huntress Lullaby lmfao
---
But she most likely could have hit you twice anyway.
---
There is no winning at that point if the killer is moderately ok at the game. Your team failed to finish the gens, you failed to locate the hatch, you‚Äôre out of second chances unless the killer neglects to patrol the gates
---
Yes I play it daily, both killer and survivor. Maybe when I‚Äôm survivor I don‚Äôt get full stacks but as killer I don‚Äôt have trouble going against the odd insta heal or 2.
---
Yeah, Freddy is OP
---
Yh broke ppl rise up üòî
---
I like the sneaky billy in the bottom right :3
---
which just absolutely sucks
---
I have preset settings for my monitor when playing killer.
---
The only map I have real trouble discerning aura's, regardless of settings, is that one winter map. I can never find my totem if too far away.
---
Ah, wait, I think I understand it more clearly now. I didn't look as closely at the top-right chart as I should have that indicates that red and brown both show up as more or less the same color. It makes a lot more sense now that I've re-read it. My original train of thought was that even though certain colors don't show up the way they should for a normal eye, they would still clash with a differently colored background. Disregard my original post.
---
This has been happing since even before the ghostface chapter, it‚Äôs not because of this patch.
---
Downvote for repost. Entity displeased.
---
10/10 will be tree huggers, basement dwellers, sabotaging hooks instead of helping with gens and will for sure escape without saving you in the end game.
---
I wouldn't joke about cheating on a official subreddit
---
Wraith really makes you feel like batman - 10/10 IGN
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand, you can‚Äôt get achievements from kill your friends. So you can make 4 man of survivors but it‚Äôs random killer unless you try snipe each other.  Trust me I‚Äôve got 1.5k hours on pc Ik how the achievements work.
---
\^ devs, when?
---
removing books :DDD
---
ThisüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It means someone just finished cleansing at a fountain.
---
I need more of this
---
Monto?
---
‚ÄúWhat makes me a good Demogorgon? If I was a bad Demogorgon, I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here in red ranks discussing it with you now, would I?‚Äù
---
Billy, try get spirit fury from Spirit and use that with enduring. It‚Äôll help you with loops. Billy is a lot better than doc imo. Against good survivors you‚Äôll stand a better chance with billy so I‚Äôd focus on him if I were you.
---
People saying Freddy is op is how he became the worst killer in the game. He's fine as is.
---
Jake mains. Monto is everything thats pure in the game community. The only Jake main that isnt selfish up the ass
---
Ok, thanks
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d7tpqe/anyone_other_console_players_or_any_players_at/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Distressing - unnerving presence - overcharge is a nice combo for Doc against low to mid tier survivors.
---
Yh ik it‚Äôs annoying af and game changing but I think we have to deal with it. Been that way for 3 years
---
I think it should stun the killer for 5 seconds and not cause exhaustion but instead a normal 60 second cooldown.
---
BBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIi
---
I had a Jake main risk his life for me once. Just once tho.
---
You mean so you cant see for a few seconds if the killer is walking in your direction and saw you? üòÇ Yes fml. Please get rid of it.
---
I'd argue that Shelter Woods is the only killer sided map in the game.
---
No, hes not joking. These are coming in the next patch.
---
High-visibility red used for scratches shows up without any trouble for me. It's the color used for work vests exactly because it's easy to see on any background. Sounds like you either need a new monitor or you haven't done the calibrations properly. Since the new engine rework especially scratches aren't hard to see on any part of any map.
---
Sadly I do not but I recently wrote two posts venting about the broken game and some glitches and they both got removed saying something like we won't fix it here so the auto not is silly I think
---
Oh yeah
---
No... it does not affect chest loot
---
No way he becomes stronger than spirit.
---
99% of the time actual lagswitching and not just "bad internet"
---
Doesn‚Äôt it? I really thought it did
---
Just because it's been that way for 3 years doesn't mean it should never change
---
U sure bout that?
---
Yea, some of the rules are fucking stupid not just for this sub but for a lot of others too
---
Right? Its so inconsistent lol
---
I'm blind what's it say?
---
thats a nice combo. How about Bloody head and pants then scoops ahoy shirt?
---
No I‚Äôve tried it. Got bored with it.
---
im impressed less by the escape and more by the fact that youre the only person ive ever seen wear that jake set
---
I can imagine it. It's called Gideon Meat Packing Plant.
---
My point exactly...both BBQ and WGLF Bloodpoint bonus criteria are healthy for the game to promote less tunneling, camping and more teamwork. They really should be active by default. BBQ is fine as an aura perk,maybe tweak the range a bit and it's still at worst A-Tier.
---
Something like this for Steam would be pretty nice too. Since steam gives info about peoples matches for games like Underlords, Dota, CSGO etc etc.
---
The snow map forget the name of it, but when I play as the killer there I can‚Äôt see the gems or hooks don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm color blind or not but the seems to be the only map I can‚Äôt see them very well or at all on but the darker maps I have no problems.
---
Paging u/Punisher_Bubba
---
I saw them on Lerys on a dark wall when i was new and i thought the game was breaking.
---
Nor did we downvoting you ! Jesus , can we get more positive vibes in this community. It‚Äôs people like you that make it not so fun , smh
---
Was looking for a SWF match. Was gonna let the killer get all the points he could by knocking people down, using their unique abilities, hooking them twice.
---
you need to rot
---
Thanks! I'll try to save up to get those and another question what's better no one escape death or hollowed grounds?
---
Only thing I hate is how freaking long it takes on laptop now before I get a match omg. Even longer than on the ps4. I bought it for my laptop cause I heard matches go super fast. Which was so true. UNTIL stranger things came. üòí
---
Oh yeah I always just look for totem because otherwise I'd just be fucking up every generator
---
How can you tell it's a wifi gamer?
---
All my survivors are level 44, and all my killers are at least level 20. I try to keep them all equal.
---
Don't you mean Resilience? Premonition just helps you avoiding the Killer.
---
OMFG my last few games all killers gave me lag asf. Makes the game play so annoying.
---
He‚Äôs like a puppy who managed to climb on the couch but can‚Äôt get down, wtf (c" ‡≤§,_‡≤§)    ~~This is oddly cute thinking about this in that way..~~
---
God I wish.
---
See I think the issue is SWF has such an advantage that it feels like bullying, when really its more like you arent used to such good coordination that it feels like youre being trolled at points
---
This game is pretty balanced I dont understand people like this. The only thing I could see someone complaining about something is a good swf.
---
The other day I had 3 Jakes in my team 2 of which were prestiged. One baby Jake let go of the hook after struggling on purpose. Neither of other two did anything other than hide in lockers and hug trees and farm me at the end. I had to do 3 generators from scratch and got ran around for a good 3.5-4 mins while they were hiding. How do I know? I had Bond and they were around me but didn‚Äôt attempt anything. At the end, even though I died second, I had the highest points being 22k while they got 10k and 9k and died 
---
One of the 2 remaining Jakes before he died was saboing hooks instead of doing 2 gens and leaving. Level 10-12 survivors are the new level 20
---
yeah I like that for farming
---
Idk man. Before I got ruin on Huntress a gen would pop on the other side of the map before I get there on the bigger maps
---
I wish you could replace audio files in the game that would be beautiful
---
I love it lol
---
Well for finding totems , in the new map specifically bc they have some sneaky little corners and nooks
---
Both and neither üëç
---
They kinda stepped close to that with the plauge as she is a priestesses
---
If you're looking for farming BP, hallowed gives you the BP bonus in one category. NOED extends the end game for extra chances of hits and hooks while survivors are running around looking for that totem. This'll give you points in two categories (sorry if I'm mistaken)
---
Were you running dying light?
---
Peril
---
Even then you get 48 plus the standard 4 percent chance of self unhooking... 4 very rare offerings and a tier 3 perk on all survivors and all you get is a 52% chance of unhooking yourself or getting out of bear traps if you're going against trapper. Powerful yes but let's be honest here it's not meta by any means.
---
Gen speed and loops that can‚Äôt be mindgamed are pretty ridiculous.
---
Honestly? In current state, I feel like game is decently balanced. Some killers need to be made better, and some perks should be changed, but its very close to perfect
---
Ah ok
---
Milk my friend milk, u pbbly one hooked at least 2 of them.
---
I didn‚Äôt mean it was good, I meant it was fun to use. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Poor Legion only gets a participation trophy
---
I feel like you should make the survivors have to enter lockers to do something, because nobody really gets in lockers.
---
He charged the shred around the corner.
---
You thought this was it, didn't you?
---
Tried that, its downloading 2 files I guess and has an hour left. Lets hope that fixes it
---
Sorry to ruin the meme, but it isn‚Äôt a book.
---
Ski Resort is the worst for this. Auras are really hard to see against the colour of the map. Finding your hex totems is almost impossible.
---
I‚Äôve heard they plan on never adding colorblind settings due to it somehow giving colorblind people an advantage. Don‚Äôt quote me but I believe this was said during a live stream. Don‚Äôt really remember but I recall that being said when asked about this topic.
---
Same here. I have so much trouble looking for scratch marks and I just cannot play killer. Visually unplayable.
---
Wonder why you didn't give them the Funny prompt
---
Thank you I‚Äôll fix that.
---
*5% faster*
---
AHHHHHHHHHH
---
Obligatory daily cry baby post now back to your regular salty program
---
His chase music is the BEST. What are you talking about lmao? Respect the opinion tho.
---
Went against her last night. She was a monster.
---
That's great to hear, this game can be nasty sometimes
---
i thought if this idea also a locker killer makes alot of sense, i however dont have your Photoshop skills, yours looks much better then mine the powers themselves are very similar to mine but my perks are very different
---
 i think 2nd perk is very strong though denying a pallet stun is huge and urs as no CD, your last perk is very cool i like the problem is most hex totems are destroyed early on, also its huge RNG cause the surv could just end up not doing the only two gens that are corrupted, making the hex worthless
---
heres my take on it if you want too see it posted it last year, i also added a survivor for too
---

---
Any and all ragequitters should get banned after 3 times in a month. Fuck them. I've never played a game that has so many disconnects before. Issue needs to be solved because as of now survivors are just dcing whenever something doesn't go their way and it sucks for everyone. Can't speak for killer dcs as I only play killer and dont dc, but I agree that survs shouldn't depip for that.
---
Lmao new third seal buff
---
the duality of man
---
I respectfully disagree with literally everything you just said. Chase music is the best in the game, his character model and animation are amazing. Dedicated servers are still being tweaked so that people like you won't complain when they are released, and for the most part the game isn't buggy for me ( PS4). Please, take your grievances somewhere else.
---
I disagree. Representation is important to society and media as a whole. But there's already a lot of it in this game so I don't see the point in complaining about the lack of it either.
---
*Haunted Grounds
---
You have to report teaming in game otherwise it‚Äôs pointless.
---
You‚Äôre probably right. Still, people with a legitimate need for colourblind settings shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer because of the few that would exploit it. I can‚Äôt say I fully understand how colourblindness works but I find scratch marks pretty easy to see in the colour that they are - I don‚Äôt imagine the ability to make them blue or green or whatever would give me that much of an advantage.
---
On the bright side  you have a badass screenshot now tho
---
thats literally the point of it
---
I'm not really good with perk names ^^"
---
Oh yes because getting cucked by a WELL KNOWN ALMOST YEAR OLD BUG is getting ‚Äúoutplayed‚Äù by someone who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have gotten kill credit.
---
Yea I was actually, I rly hope that isn‚Äôt the issue
---
Duno, if i were colorblind those would be the first thing I'd spent my check on. Just me though
---
https://i.imgur.com/uhGr0wX.png
---
dw, just annoyed me that the other guy didnt mention the real name
---
It is, it‚Äôs bugged rn, killer‚Äôs game crashes as soon as you get a certain amount of stacks on dying light. It pisses me off too man, I wanna do so many builds w it, but I can‚Äôt bc of the stupid bug.
---
Bloodpoints May be everything, but this is pretty funny.
---
Meg, stop touching that nipple.
---
It‚Äôs an awesome perk for M1 killers in general. One thing is that his shred doesn‚Äôt affect stacks, so you can use shred to hit the obsession without losing any stacks.
---
Up the Ante increases luck by teammates alive so if everyone‚Äôs running it and everyone‚Äôs alive, your luck is increased by 36%. 
---
This means that in that situation without other luck offerings there‚Äôs a 78,4% chance of cobeing out of the hook with three tries
---
Did you buy on steam or console? The console editions come with the Huntress DLC for free- just need to download it.
---
I thought body blocking was reportable?
---
It works really well with devour hope at the start of the game, as your shred won't be affected by either, which means at the start you hit people normally until you get 3 tokens of devour and how ever many tokens of STBFL and then you shred to hide your devour until 5 stacks, STBFL will only be used for the first half of the game and maybe the very end in this case though.
---
The shape has many playstyles, but some of the best perks on him could be:
---
Monitor and abuse (makes his terror radius 0 at tier one and 8 at tier 2)
---
Bamboozle / fire up / brutal strength ( makes him a murder machine at tier 3, vaulting windows and breaking pallets insanely fast)
---
Infectious Fright (great to try and chain instadowns while in tier 3, combos with monitor and abuse)
---
Meta perks like ruin, bbq, enduring / spirit fury also work fine.
---
For his jumpscare build you'll want play with your food and no one escapes death.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with legion, he‚Äôs dog shit.
---
Strangest things
---
It's always like that. Who don't play as much would cry for anything, it's hilarious
---
Devs keep nerfing and buffing stuff that won't help the game mechanics at all. Fucking up with survivors vault because the map level design are shitty or nerfing the hell out of certain perks or giving perks to fix other issues. Obvious example
---
Gens are a problem? There you go ruin thanatophobia yadayada
---
Loops are a problem? Spirit fury, bamboozle yada yada
---
Can't cleanse totems? Inner strength, small game yadayada
---
Your team mates suck? Deliverance, insta heals yadayada
---
They sell you the fix that should happen in game. Fixing shitty map design, adding objectives. Giving less safe pallets and more mind gameable ones, buffing shitty killers and revert dumb changes to hold survivors strengths. But still, those people you showed will always exist, blinded by their own bias
---
Well, good thing I'm getting the dlc soon
---
Not even close.
---
Myers is way more op than him.
---
I want a fucking huge eyeball killer NOW. And his Mori is him starring at the survivors until they die because they feel uncomfortable being starred at
---
Only if you body block allies or survivors as killer to keep the game hostage. OP is a surv blocking the killer so the other surv may escape.
---
A Mean Girls meme?!? Ah, I see you are a man of culture.
---
Ikr matchmakings dogshit
---
They've been asked time and time again for the last three years and they've still done nothing about it
---
Did i think it was a snipe? Well from what I saw it didn‚Äôt look like a snipe to me he was just getting outplayed at unsafe loops. But allegedly he had some info on their profiles so i guess it was.
---
I do use it on demo for the ability to shred the obsession and then just build stacks and I'm usually at 8 by the 2~3 gen. In a game I just got out of I had 8 by the first gen. the buff is super noticable and helps end chases but I'm just not sure if anything else could go in for it.
---
I would actually love this. Maybe even a spectate mode.
---
American dad is the best
---
Iron will, Urban evasion, Lightweight, and Spine chill are my go to for extreme immersion. Spine chill and urban make it so you probably won't even be seen and if you do iron will and lightweight are amazing for losing the killer.
---
You should calibrate your monitor if you have enough issues with scratches you think a different color would be any easier to discern than the current bright high-visibility red with all its bloom and saturation. They've never been easier to distinguish. 
---
https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-calibrate-your-monitor/
---
Well there was this dildo company called bad dragon that had a cross promotional thing with Stranger things called stranger dongs and the demogorgon dildo makes it look like it can open so yeah it probably does open up
---
Wait,so if I crouch In front of the hook it‚Äôs perfectly fine?
---
Bunny Feng vs The Hag irl
---
Clown also loves the new map. Unsafe loops for days.
---
Corrupt Intervention helps a lot with this. As well as that one perk that slows down the game just a little bit. Can't remember its name, though. Heck: Ruben?
---
I do good?
---
2 sides to every story. XD
---
I suggest playing the game for a while and getting to know the different killers and perks that you prefer. Theres no such thing as a perfect character with all 3 amazing perks and everyone has different play styles, so learn their basic abilities and get an understanding of their teachables before buying anything you won't be using in the future. Bonus tip if you're really new: If you just want one perk from a DLC killer you don't want to buy, wait for it to pop up in the shrine of secrets.
---
This is so often too. Someone spawns on ruin gen rushed tbagged then the pip down
---
Take it as learning experience until they fix matchmaking. At least ranks don't have rewards, so they don't matter. Just focus on getting points and getting better.
---
I love it when i get some survivors that say i was hacking because they couldnt move since i was blocking them while i was phasing
---
That‚Äôs true, worth it
---
Maybe instead of gens left, it could show how long the match has been going.  
---
Also of course things like "Searching for a game", "In lobby" and "In post-game lobby" would be good.
---
And it looks like the game is giving you the finger as an extra bonus.
---
For NVIDIA users: Use NVIDIA Freestyle
---
I'd love to see where all the "Hell yeah a new Indoor map!"-people went after it's release.
---
Seriously screw this map, it looks dope but playing it is next level space aids.
---
The skate off of the century, Hawk vs Krueger!
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a part of the game
---
I feel attacked.
---
The last update broke matchmaking. It‚Äôs been on like half the threads on reddit for days and days.
---
Yeah well it sucks
---
He said respected video game developer so won't be DBD sadly
---
It was very general and hard for me to choose. When it comes to the best perks, they are only a tiny bit overpowered, but there are so many very weak perks that I want to be changed so I‚Äôm not versing the exact same thing every game.
---
Basically the killer was a basement camping bubba. One of the worst builds to go against. His entire plan is to get people in the basement and use his perks to remain practically invisible. Then when someone comes for the save he will insta down them and the cycle will repeat until everybody is dead. It‚Äôs not fun to play against
---
yikes, need to talk?
---
Gonna slow these down to weekly or bi-weekly (partly because I'm running out of shitposts) but I appreciate the support from (mostly) everyone so far!
---
The hatch appears when a certainamount of gens is done with a certain ampunt of survivors are left, but only opens when 1 is left. If you see it and its closed, you can use a key to open it, a key does not afect when the hatch appears
---
I‚Äôd love to run something more fun or interesting but it‚Äôs basically a must use perk at lower ranks.
---
It's like using Billy's saw while looping.  You need to be smart about it, and you'll have to properly mindgame to use correctly.  It's not really meant for tighter loops anyway, but rather when the survivor is out in the open.  
---
  
---
I think it's fine as is.  The buff is definitely going to help though
---
4 survivors = Spawns after 5 gens
---
3 survivors = Spawns after 4 gens
---
2 survivors = Spawns after 3 gens
---
Well don‚Äôt play ghost face for one.
---
Me too it was awesome now, meh
---
Thanks :)
---
You can use shards to buy the non-licensed killers but you need to pay for the licensed ones
---
Looks like a couple people who haven't gotten good yet.
---
Shouldve left when you had the chance
---
I have normal vision and I find scratch marks a bitch to see on maps like Ormond or when you're Freddy. I feel like [Godot](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Godot) because scratch marks on white surfaces are nearly impossible to see.
---
Bruh you used an emoji that‚Äôs like illegal or something im calling the emoji police can‚Äôt wait to get my Karma
---
Talking shit about the company because they're not immediately rolling it out isn't very nice. Chances are it's something on the board but low on the priority list, you should be able to play without being handicapped, but frankly you need to work on your choosy beggar mentality. It won't get you anywhere except upset at yourself.
---
f off urban is a good perk
---
Looking at if from how it will affect the gameplay, it is not a good change. Considering the demogorgon is pretty mid tier, it is not a good idea to nerf him.
---
Ok mr big brain who should I play to pummel these red rank t baggers
---
If you start survivor you need the best perk in the game, decisive strike. It comes with the Halloween dlc.
---
For killer, get that leatherface BBQ and chili.
---
Most every other meta perk can be obtained with characters that are already in the game (dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed time) or can be bought with shards (Hag for ruin)
---
I just chase people I flank alot if that helps also I walk away from hooks right after I hook them.
---
Lol. Nah I'm actually fine about it, I just think it's laughable that they find this shit acceptable tbh. I realised when I said my little speech I went on a rant, whoops
---
Look in the background, I tried to leave but it was a glitch
---

---
New DLC confirmed?
---
How do I get ruin?
---
I swear if you guys had diversion that just wouldve been funny if he acted like he was gonna lunge and you all just started throwing rocks at him and pointing at him
---
Yeah, i will make better survey in a week or few days from feedback gathered from this one, honestly did not expected so much answers, i expected three maybe four people, so i made it more general and honestly did not put as much work into it as i should. Hopefully the next one will be better, thank you for feedback, and i include something on the lines in version 2.0.
---
On my tier list on PS4, it's Spirit, Freddie, Billy and then Demogorgon. I'd imagine he'd be number 5 for me if I played on PC.
---
thats not nice fujin zubSAD
---
Thank you I want to learn to chase the survivors and manage to sacrifice them without any cheap tricks or spawn camping practice makes perfection as they say
---
peepoSad
---
You level up the hag to either level 30 or 35, can't remember off the top of my head. But then you'll be able to unlock the ruin teachable and it will then be able to appear on Michael's bloodweb
---
I‚Äôve got terrible internet and get accused of lagswitching all the time.
---
Its like they don‚Äôt see me occasionally running into a wall
---
I mainly use distressing because I need bloodpoints is their a alternative?
---
The number of gens done has to be greater than the survivors remaining for it to appear.
---
I absolutely hate the grass on it. It's back soil with black grass and black sky. My in shadows it's impossible to see anything on my monitor.
---
widepeepoHappy
---
Ruin slows the gens right?
---
Actual image of trying to use Ghostface's power in ranked
---
I could understand if their was 2 gens left and they had selfcare and wanted u to gen rush but if theirs still more than 3 gens left for crying out loud let the man/girl heal you

If you notice, it's the exterior pallets that aren't safe, and when you start moving to the middle more, you'll see there are much safer loops. Hawkins Lab punishes the creeping along the outside of the map approach.
---
The hatch will spawn when number of survivors alive plus number of gens left to complete equals 4  or if you‚Äôre the last survivor. The hatch does not spawn instantly if a key is brought in.
---
I don't get it.
---
Didn't they put the .25 seconds on the cooldown?
---
Just don't play the game 4Head
---
I got to rank I think 10 or 11 with Billy without ruin. It can be done you just need to really keep the pressure up. Sometimes you‚Äôre going to get gen rushed but that‚Äôs just part of the game. I have Ruin now and it sometimes gets found right away and I get shut out and lose without a single kill and maybe only a couple one time hooks. You can‚Äôt win them all. People have all the totem spots memorized and good survivors can work through it. Ruin is a crapshoot. 
---
It‚Äôs also easy enough to just save your blood points to get. I farmed them with Billy then leveled Nurse and Hag to 45 without actually playing them.
---
Also right now matchmaking is broken. Like worse than before. It‚Äôs matching people of wildly different ranks and it is hard for new players. Unfortunately all we can do is just wait for the hotfix to come out. They‚Äôre aware of the problem. On the flip side some survivors are getting straight murdered by experienced killers too. :(  Just be patient and keep at it. It sucks to lose but it will not last forever. Just keep working on some basic killer skills like learning the maps and what loops survivors will try and keep you on forever, how to keep up map pressure with generator patrols, learning survivor escape shenanigans etc. Every game will teach you stuff and you will get better. Watch some YouTube guides on specific killers or general killer strategy. 
---
Good luck in the fog!

Only true skater boiz listen to Goldfinger - Superman on loop.

You will never get 5 uses of it. Even if nobody else is using it, AT LEAST one other person will do totems for the points at least, if not finding a hex. You can still do totems with Second Wind and will heal while wasting less time overall. Using Inner Strength does not mean that NOED won't proc unless you're keeping track of all totems somehow, which usually requires 4 man SWF. You also don't get picked up by nurses while Second Wind is healing you and if you are afraid of BBQ lockers are still there for you (in which you would still be healing from SW). My main stance isnt that Inner Strength is a useless perk, Second Wind is just much better if you don't go down first every game.
---
Adams gonna pebble
---
Not ghost face he‚Äôs pretty rubbish, if your new to killer try Hillbilly he‚Äôs easy to play as or Myers.
---
Its an improvment for DBD, if the mods delete my comment or this post, they are literally shouldnt be allowed near any position with power !
---
Who gives a crap if I'm chasing a black guy or a white guy? It doesn't matter in a game about murdering people for gods sake
---
Usually with gens, hitting a normal skill check will just allow you to continue the gen normally, and a great skill check will progress the gen by 5%. With ruin, a normal skill check will reduce the progress by 5%, and a great skill check will just allow them to continue. Hope this helps :)
---
lmao pee wee's big adventure is the best
---
Mate, mate. It's called critising, and after I paid for the game, I'm pretty sure I'm entitled to an opinion. I'm not colorblind, and it's not like I'm asking for much other than a game that isn't broken nearly every big patch, and I think that should be allowed to expect considering, you know, because I paid for the game.
---
PS, Qol updates aren't really a huge ask, in most scenarios.
---
This can be faked so easily
---
I'm not colour blind, but I have friends who are. This needs more awareness.
---
I play on max settings and it goes through?
---
Huh? I assure you this isn‚Äôt fake.
---
Thank you so much I am such a noob
---
Plot twist: the chased survivor is already injured
---
Everyone starts somewhere, if you have anymore questions I'll be happy to answer them.
---
I've had a survivor (I met the same guy twice and he did it both times mid-mori. Second time I ran into him I wanted to Mori as punishment for quitting the first time) yank his cord or DDOS himself or something to DC. They keep their item and BP. On the Killer's end it looks like they lagged out and there's no DC sound.
---
Halloween reference?  Laurie and Steve are both baby sitters, I could see it
---
Demo can transcend with this perk. This perk works the best on him, more than any other killer.  His shred attack doesn‚Äôt make you gain, or lose, a token. Therefore, you can shred your obsession and not lose any tokens. He‚Äôs the only killer where you can naturally kill your obsession and still have 8 tokens left for the whole match.
---
Its race baiting and being a fucking asshole.
---
But really people like this are just attempting to impress the world with how "fair" and "cultured" they are by making some PC fuss out of everything. 
---
You're right to an extend. But 90% of peeps complaining are total knobs trying to elevate themselves but ultimately they just sabotage themselves and societies evolution.
---
what did it say?
---
Nice one bill
---
That‚Äôs the point of it. I think it should stay. It also reveals auras of stuff in the circle like generators So it‚Äôs sided for both.
---
oh ok thanks
---
if a survivor cant manage to get 1 of 7 gens on the whole map at all, why should they even have chance for escaping? most maps are massive, plus most of the killers do have the whole terror radius thing so you dont even need to see them to know they are coming
---
This is usually how it is after I lose horribly and they realize I was rank 20. They usually feel really bad after haha.
---
Spawns after repairing*
---
What‚Äôs this, 2018?
---
This is a fantastic post! I had a similar issue in ESO and can luckily change colors in the UI. DBD needs this too.
---
I've also been waiting too long for games it's so bad rn üòî
---
But there‚Äôs 4 of them so bloodwarden isn‚Äôt active as there weren‚Äôt any sacrifices.
---
by ‚Äúoverall better stealth mechanics‚Äù do you mean ‚Äúif the survivors have spinechill/premonition/OoO it‚Äôs game over‚Äù?
---
because those perks don‚Äôt work against tier 1 myers but they completely fuck over ghostface. ghostface is poor design. plus ghostface might get a few instadowns here and there but other than that he‚Äôs just an m1 killer in chase.
---
Honestly i love this dlc! you may have a different opinion then the rest of us, and thats ok &lt;3 (people shouldnt be downvoted for expressing harmless opinions) 
---
The demogorgon is a killer i love playing as and against, the perks are kinda meh and the same goes with the map
---
But the survivors are amazing! the perks are great and feel really nice to play with
---
Overall this DLC is the best they have released in more then a year, I truly think this is the first good DLC in ages
---
Every game should have these options from launch date. Accessibility is important, especially if sudios want more people to play their games. Different ways to play games isn't something that should be forgotten.
---
DC should go to Sacrifice since there's no way to fill it besides hooking. I get it a guy ragequitting is sort of "Devious" but that category is mostly used for power usage. Brutality (Where it currently goes) is gained from hitting, kicking gens and pallets, etc. 
---
Should be swapped to Sacrifice since a guy DCing means you miss out on the points for hooking and sacrificing him.
---
I'm seeing more and more groups that are not in a swf just rush gens like crazy. If a game lasts more than 5 minutes, I'm actually suprised. Gen speed needs to be adressed somehow if the game ever wants to be balanced.
---
Ruin is basically a coin toss in whether it spawns like a lighthouse in plain goddamn sight or not and having a mandatory perk is not good at all.
---
I wonder if you can make an accessibility claim against these guys since they are based in Canada. I know in Ontario this shit wouldn't stand.
---
Well yeah, thought that was a little obvious
---
Most. Balanced. Game. Ever.
---
I usually play games with the UI in tritanopia mode even tho I have normal color vision. I'd greatly appreciate colorblind settings.
---
They probably don‚Äôt want non color blind people turning the option on. They are very specific with how people play their game. I agree though it would be nice if they added it.
---
I really feel the 2x faster speed. You literally get perks 2x faster which means it cuts the grind in half. Much easier.
---
Yeah I edited it earlier but it didn't save rip
---
I hate these damn hitboxes for the most part it seems somewhat balanced with a few different things on both sides needing tweeked but no matter what they need to fix the hitboxes i thought dedicated servers would do such but im still getting bs atks where im like 4 metwrs behind the killer and still get hit now thats a bit easy to deal with for most the guys but that plus freddys bs lunge just makes it nearly impossible to loop unless you have a pallet and/or he hits the wall
---
you‚Äôre missing the point. i want to have fun not have it easy.
---
"must've been the wind"
---
Don't listen to that guy. Urban is good to have for stealth and is good counterplay against a few killers abilities.
---
I don't think bad = cancer but ok
---
Right, in some cases the gen is way more important. Then you both should 99 the gen together, heal, then pop it. Too many times people want to pop it then heal.
---
Myers is trash
---
Steam
---
What about nodding at people and spinning around while crouching... the dance of friendship
---
This though. I'm a super baby killer, and I get bullied more often than not when playing games haha. People usually apologize after for being mean and give me tips. I really enjoy the end of a game, even if I only managed to do one swing and not even a hook haha. I have mad respect for killers.
---
Blood Warden activates on hook, not sacrifice. 
---
Hook one of swf, swf performs body block shenanigans to unhook friend, runs to gate together to find it blood wardened.
---
Wtf kind of program does that lmao
---
It looks like the entity flipped you off, both literally and figuratively.
---
Ya that‚Äôs what I meant on hook
---
Lisa:  You found me beautiful, once.
---
Ash:  Honey, you got REAL ugly.
---
Hey bhvr, hire this guy to adjust the colors.
---
I thought I was going to die. That respawn was super lucky.
---
That's because the killer is host - There is no way for them to determine if it is the killers shit internet or their connection to the killer.
---
Esp if the pre-lobby is green ping and you get in and start warping around.
---
i run every exhaustion perk even harder
---
Hey, op, those circles perfectly represent what we see in game. Spot on!
---
You paid for the game, you got the game. You did not pay for specific development. If you think your fifty dollars buys you a right to sit in the developers room despite just being a consumer you have a rough life ahead of you .
---
You can get some hella range from height, just shredding off the hill like doubles the range.
---
The kind of teammates I don't get on red ranks.
---
Tell that to BHVR about Pig
---
It means the game isn't really fun.
---
&gt; Qol updates aren't really a huge ask
---
When there's several bugs every patch as you say, then it would be a huge ask.
---
Also every sleeping person speeds up tp cooldown by 15%
---
I agree, but Carnage kinda seems like a slightly better pick IMO
---
Man, you're an idiot. You literally didn't read my reply, so there's no point in even trying to reason with you.
---
And sometimes it is. No one goes into the game looking to lose, but someone will. That‚Äôs how life works. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
---
Actually I don't. But ok.
---
X-treme immersion build. 
---
Iron Will; Urban Evasion; Lightweight; Fixated; Quick and Quiet; Dance With Me
---
Aye let‚Äôs be friends forever, eh?
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not too bad if you just really enjoy the game. It‚Äôs grindy sure, but I enjoy the grind and that‚Äôs all that matters
---
Why can't we just play the game already! I'm deutan and I cant fucking play killer for scratchmarks or survivor because ruin skill checks are the same thing.
---
Nice the only way to find ya will be with a Myers myers lol
---
You can literally scratch marks with ease on anything except snow 
---
If you run on ultra then the scratch marks are invisible under grass. This isn't intentional, but it's really fucking funny you think it is lol
---
Shredding from a higher location does extend the range, so much so that I really have no clue how to utilize it yet. You can't really tell how far away you are going to land, and only once have I gotten anywhere near the survivor.
---
Shaggy‚Äôs perks have some great callbacks to the Scooby Doo movies &amp; tv shows
---
I think it's the one that can't be changed cuz of some bug and that's why killers have to play with 3 perk slots
---
Genuinely thought this was the same guy putting different posts within a months time gap at first üòÇ
---
Distressing is not a good perk for Myers because you don't want him to have a bigger Terror Radius. Do you only have the base perks or you have some teachable from other killers? If you don't, try something like Whispers, Sloppy Butcher, Bitter Murmur and Dying Light (Myers perk).
---
Perfectly balanced game.
---
I dunno. If it's on top it's more likely to be broken before they go for the save. I still manage to catch one of them with the basement one though.
---
Re
---
I mean have you seen the settings for this game? Four all-encompassing options for graphics and audio sliders are just "general" and "menu music".
---
I pretty much drop my headphones for the menu. Sound effects are too loud but if I lower them it affects in-game. Just why.
---
my fecking heart
---
What does sloppy butcher do ik it makes them bleed but is that only to find survivors? Or does it slowly kill them?
---
They gave her blue skin because she is a corpse
---
****28 STAB WOUNDS****

Spine chill saved this one guy repeatedly when I was using portals to sneak up on him as Demogorgon. He was the only one who I didn't grab off a generator and I couldn't figure out how he kept knowing I was coming. Turned out he was running Spine Chill and didn't get hooked once because of it. Perks are circumstantial, while there may be a meta build that many consider best, some perks can be really powerful if the situation plays in the perk's favor.
---
It‚Äôs super common on PS4 for some reason
---
I had two change on me yesterday, one to get two sacrifices as Doctor and another to get 4 shocks as Doctor. I *hate* playing doctor but I managed to get the dailies done in one game then I get to the end and see "hit four survivors with hatchets using the huntress" and "as Jake be chased for 180 seconds" in my rituals with both doctor ones just being gone.
---
Sloppy Butcher makes it harder for survivors to heal. They spent a lot more time doing that.
---
How is this shit still in the game Christ.
---
Beats me man
---
Qol updates aren't bug fixes. I was referring to colorblind mode.
---
I mean, there are a lot of pallets within a short range of each other, and some really stupid loop spots. Safe, not entirely. Stupid, yes.
---
If you're good &amp; have healthy eyes, you should already be able to track the scratch marks without needing to change the color. I never lose chase due to scratch marks and I don't even have my brightness that high.
---
If you're not able to hold a chase, then that's on you. Color blind people shouldn't be punished for your lack of skill because you plan to use it while not being color blind.
---
Why tho?
---
I'm pretty sure a 7yo American girl wouldn't hunt wolves for fun
---
Not even lol. I‚Äôm a Myers main and if I‚Äôm tier 3 and blood warden activated for the full minute, that‚Äôs a 4 man
---
Congrats! You got BHVRed!
---
Oh yeah. You do great. I actually just watched this episode the other day
---
This real? I checked his twitter and couldn't find anything.
---
You guys are a minority and they don‚Äôt care about you guys. 
---
Just go play civ. /s
---
I don't wait to tbag, I only do it if the killer is right there as I escape.
---
Tony is a survivor, Bam is the killer, map is ‚ÄúAmerican Wasteland‚Äù
---
It's under his "Tweets and Replies" section. Idk how Twitter works but its there.
---
Ah, I can't view that since I don't have a Twitter account.
---
I have a question. As someone who is not color blind, if the color blind filter is on, would the scratch marks change color somehow? Would it be more of an advantage for non-coloblind killers? Would it put survivors at a disadvantage?
---
Damn this is nice.
---
I'd wait for the elephant one (the contest winner) to be added and get that.
---
that brings back fond memories of gears of war 1
---
Does it really matter? It's just pixels moving up and down. No need to say that someone tbagged if it doesn't matter at all.
---
Well when I main killer after a successful attack I point the camera down to try to watch them as they go, above the weapon on my screen. Maybe that could help? After the animation just straighten out.
---
Shreddy Krueger when???
---
I think there‚Äôs some killers ( especially recently) they‚Äôve nailed, with only a few bugs or add ons that need changing. Freddy and Demogorgon are both viable to play as and face, not being OP or even too strong but strong enough to be perfectly fair. Ghostface is pretty fair, other than revealing being a bit bugged on both ends, he‚Äôs actually fairly well balanced. And the plague is also a solid killer, with a slight stat buff (idk) she‚Äôd be perfect for both ends.     
---
        
---
The main issue is the older killers (nurse, hillbilly) + spirit being too strong, or some relatively new killers (eg legion, clown)  + wraith being too weak. Obviously their balancing has improved over the last 6 months or so. Other than ruin being mandatory there‚Äôs no clear OP perks atm (debate all u want on NOED) , and I wouldn‚Äôt even call ruin op, so clearly a lot either need stat buffing or reworked. And if they design a good way to stop ruin being mandatory for most killers without over nerfing survivors the game would almost be perfect. They‚Äôre definitely on the up recently.
---
As a non-colorblind person, changing the color of the auras wouldn't do much for me. The color settings they have are bright enough that changing the color wouldn't add any more advantage to me than I already have. I think they should def have a colorblind mode; I don't think it'll help that many non-colorblinds.
---
I need to know what this is.
---
I was just making a point, I haven't seen anyone, not one person using it after the change, so who could say if it even works? Theres no reason to think it doesn't tho, I bet it does. Just a tip, don't buy DLC's specifically for the perks, they get changed, nerfed/buffed occasionally. I main Ash cuz I love the series and Bruce Campbell, not for his perks, they are absolute ass.
---
I've gotten all my killers bbq 3 but I've never gotten it that early lol. Grats man! This would make it a tough choice to prestige.
---
I‚Äôll upvote these every time I see them even though I‚Äôm not color blind
---
Take my up-vote and continue these posts! Players shouldn't be discriminated against because of medical/hereditary issues!
---
I use some decently expensive gaming headphones and it helps out so much
---
You get two different free killers on pc than ps4,how would that work?
---
People would still want to fuck her lmao
---
See, this is why I asked. I didn't even know about this and now I am absolutely chomping at the bit to get it. Thanks friend!!
---
god I hope the trunk flaps around
---
When Stranger Things gets strangerer

---
Gonna piggy off this but my friend whos red colorblind found a solution. If you‚Äôre on windows you can go into settings and search for Ease of Access. There are color filters that you can use to make it easier.
---
Ah I see
---
Wait the top comment literally has a link to a post from a dev about 43% wr lol.
---
That sounds painful-
---
Turning 20 into 15 seconds doesnt sound like too much but think of all the times you were the last survivor and you were so close to getting the exit gates open and you realise the usefulness of it
---
Do you have any ideas for susie i was thinking stealth and a plague like system like maybe alcohol or makeup any ideas?
---
Is that what the melody is?
---
God! Looking for those scratch marks really sucks.
---
On xbox all the dbd reviews say this game is a shitty version of the friday the 13th game and on the friday the 13th game reviews they say that's a shitty version of dbd
---
The fact that you're getting downvotes is scary. I think it's a balanced game for sure, but if 4 perfect survivors play one perfect killer, I think the survivors would win by a small margin.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the devs don‚Äôt really care about this game at all
---
I had another option that I mentioned elsewhere, which is that if you don't complete a generator within x minutes, then the endgame timer starts until a generator is completed. The x minutes scales down the longer it takes for them to do a generator. So first time, let's say 6 minutes. If they hit that timer and complete a gen to make the timer go away, next time it takes 5 minutes for the timer to arrive. Then 4 minutes. Then 3 minutes.
---
Wait
---
It's so bad. Constant crashes. I infinite loading screens. Swf is buggy.
---
And how would you evaluate the job that's been done so far?
---
You pay for those killers in the special edition of the game. If you were to switch from PC to console without owning Hag and Doc, you won‚Äôt have them on console.
---
On the one hand, that would be cool. On the other, it would be tough to take seriously
---
Does anyone think that getting hit by a chainsaw should lead to instant death I think it would be a good nod to reality.
---
Pretty good job so far!
---
Ayup. Clown's current cosmetic selection actually pisses me off. The DEFAULT OUTFIT RECOLORS (Which is something practically every killer/survivor has for a small amount of shards) are only available for cells (And at a cheaper price so it's obvious it's supposed to be the cheapest ones, yet can't be bought with shards) and his overall selection is rather pathetic.
---
Just makes me cranky some killers/survivors have tons of cosmetics and Clown arguably has the least out of all non-licensed killers.
---
Could easily be a survivor.
---
Yeah I was patrolling gens and my roommate did the same but checked some lockers. We checked the corners a couple times but didn't see. My assumption is that they were staying close to me and following me the entire time but staying out of my fov.
---
Yes, it's from the original Halloween movie.
---
I play on XB1
---
Games CAN be fun even if you lose. In fact, they should be.
---
That's rare in DbD.
---
But if you spend blood points on something you don't have,how does that work
---
This is kind of an anti-meme
---
Clown just breaks my heart in every regard, store included. I want to love him so much, but I just can't get behind him. Love getting his dailys, but never stick to playing him for too long. Oh well. Maybe this elephant thing is just what the doctor (not that one) ordered.
---
Any idea when those contest winners will be coming out or just whenever?
---
You can install Nvidia Experience and use its Game filter feature. You won't get banned for using it and it has a colorblind option which is very effective.
---
*Nea's gonna kill*
---
Idea for the mori:Boogie shoves you into locker while blocking it with his back.
---
Survivor tries to force it open but fails.
---
Survivor slowly pours out of the locker in the form of blood.
---
Boogie wipes his hands and moves away from the locker.
---
If this was a persona 5 killler or something its be perfect
---
poor baby demogorgon
---
such cute
---
She has blue skin because she is fucking dead you dip.
---
I think you mean the bus that ran over her
---
I think after getting hooked you should have to run around the map to look for a tetanus shot before you bleed out.
---
Edited it to make more sense.
---
Also makes it insanely powerful against remember me if the killer has it
---
"Stop, he's already dead"
---
Of course only after you find a certified nurse who is able to administer the shot. I hope the survivors have good insurance good health care isn't cheap.
---
It's okay. I'm use to rejection.
---
I recently started playing Nurse on console.  I got a message from a survivor saying that they had a lot of fun and got scared a few times.   
---
It just warmed my heart.
---
Took me around 90 levels on my p3 huntress. :(
---
Headphones man, I use my PS Gold on pc and it works perfectly and they are wireless. For $100 it is a good deal.
---
What about dc
---
God, the nerve of some people
---
Multi form too strong. Just turn around and chase lol
---
why is this such a big issue now? like I'm pretty sure there's things you can do to avoid this
---
For me, seeing the hooks on Ormond is so difficult. The snow and the red just don't work for me
---
I would really suggest Plague if you don't have her already. Brought me back to playing killer and using the vomit is so fun and rewarding :)
---
If a nurse is doing exceptional at low ranks they shouldn't be at low ranks in the first place. Plus the people at super low ranks shouldn't have teachables unlocked unless they are purposefully deranking, or havent played in ages. And not everything in the game can be balanced towards new players.
---
Ruin skill checks are *supposed* to be that way tho
---
Yeah and no. I main Adam but im gping to buy the dlc characters to get those new perks. Isnt that logical?
---
Yeah for sure. The devs cant even update the game anymore because of some legal issues so friday the 13th is completely dead
---
I find this happens if I get new rituals from anywhere but on the main home screen as well as if I don't let the game get an autosave in
---
That second part is annoying now that they decreased autosave frequency a few updates ago
---
Oooooh boy it‚Äôs comin‚Äô.
---
Proof it works 
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/0d3Rbi4](https://imgur.com/a/0d3Rbi4)
---
Also hag for hex ruin.
---
I think giving ghostface the ability to crouch was the best thing ever. He even teabags better than survivors. It's like
---
Toxic Nea: "who are you"
---
Average Ghostface: "I'm you, but stronger"
---
It wouldn't be too strong if the devs could just fix their damn chase mechanics
---
i think its really cool that you designed this but holy cow would bloated be overpowered
---
You're elite.
---
The portals are doors and the hit makes him do the iconic scream,and it plays the theme of monsters inc. All we need for it is a size enhance and rights.
---
I know, right? So many assholes
---
I see so this event will not be so much of a clown fiesta.
---
where did u get the original format??
---
false. ive depipped on killer dc on countless occasions
---
Don't know how I forgot about ruin lmao
---
Same, I despise those survivors who look out for themselves and teabag at every window/ pallet
---
The problem is they don‚Äôt test console because they literally can‚Äôt. They only know and fix PC problems. Console has many limitations for them to fix and test things.
---
Game needs an option in the Pause Menu to Surrender like how Identity V has to prevent this, 35min sounds horrible.
---
You said "running at once" not playing at the same time.... Two different things.
---
Tag yourself I'm Legion
---
Yeah DC'ing is also a true testament to survivor skill
---
Thank you for being the only person to realize that but I disagree that there‚Äôs a lot of it in the game. I guess games will always be 75% white/pale skin stones
---
Balanced landing for the stun reduction.
---
ive seen it happen, de ranked due to pip loss, been told by dev's its a bug and they were looking into it. been happening for years. personal experience been playing since beta... :shrug:
---
I love it a surv. So many ways to loop, and so many safe places to heal (the rooms with those upstairs bits)
---
not that they play on console, they are trash and you can't tell me otherwise, this clip proves it, i 1v1'd my friend who is a real diamond on rainbow six on ps4 (i'm a mid gold on r6) and he used his controller and i used keyboard and mouse and he killed me once.... also this entire reddit proves my point
---
Either way it doesn't really matter because tbagging has no effect on the game if the killer doesn't consider tbagging to be a form of BMing.
---
That's completely on the player and what they want out the game.   If you play to mess around sure it can, but if you want to be competitive you will rarely have fun while losing.
---
Its a joke
---
Ok fine, running at once.
---
Man I really hope they had no issue of getting daddy Myers in there!!
---
But with that said I‚Äôm definitely making the switch to the switch. I think it‚Äôs gonna be fun building up a community there
---
With size enhancements and some modifiers it won't have to be
---
A convenient one
---
The answer is simple. It's the same reason infinite loading screens are back, there's still no dedicated servers and MM is fucked.
---
BHVR does NOT care about their game, their players or anything regarding its quality. BHVR cares about profit, profit, profit and you guessed it, profit. The only reason they're still putting work into actual DLC is because A. probably sells a tad better than auric cells and B. people would drop the game if they stopped adding new content. While yeah, I bet more people are paying for DLC than auric cells, auric cells and those often horrendous and completely nonsensical cosmetics are easy money. Pretty much everyone I know has spent money on auric cells, some more some less. If you had the choice between making 1 shitty outfit and sell it for $10 and developing a whole new DLC chapter and sell that for less, which would you choose? As a business man, not player.
---
I bet you identify with at least one of the characters but I identify with none. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúrace baiting‚Äù. Representation matters and I think it‚Äôs fair to want more people of color when it‚Äôs 75% characters with pale skin stones. It makes me sad people got so angry at my one sentence comment. To them, I should just be happy with the one token black girl(and I‚Äôm not even black). Ps. I‚Äôm on console

That game will be memoriable

Please just give Steve voice lines like Ash.. He's got such good quotes.
---
Take updoot for goodest boi
---
Ah spine chill, it can be a god send. It's a great perk IMO
---
red green colorblind, that circle is barely visible on the right.
---
Representation matters. Personally it matters to me from someone who used to hate themselves because all they saw was one type of woman in the media. I understand where you are coming from though
---
Wouldn't it be better to hit him and pretend like he juked you** only to wander close by like a movie killer?
---
Could do it twice a year, Halloween and April Fools would be the best two dates imo.
---
I wouldn't like same mories.
---
I did this a few weeks ago. I was Feng against a doctor with NOED at the Estate. I was looking for the totem but couldn't find it. I just said yolo and left out the other door. I was on last hook
---
I'm always like "I'm going to kill everybody and destroy them" going into a game and then I see a baby survivor and I'm like "AWWWW ITS SO CUTE"
---
Did you gain A ton of levels in the end?
---
12 year old spotted
---
I think after you fall off you always spawn next to the hatch because it‚Äôs happened to me twice and I got hatch escape both times
---
*Scully you‚Äôre not gonna believe this*
---
Is this a suggestion or it's going to happen? I didn't quite understand...
---
Right, I get that... Its bull to have to sacrifice 2 perks because you can't see otherwise. I was just curious if the increase in tint helps or if it still doesn't register.
---
Unless she's running that rare add on that let's her see wounded auras.
---
I wish
---
Probably through the archive, mid chapter
---
Or do what I did last year and earn the event currency. Still regret getting that Wraith skin and not the Billy one.
---
Absolutely, I was just curious more if that increase of tint helps. I like both perks but I don't use them often. It would be bull if all your builds had to include those two, leaving you with two open slots
---
I see that you main piggy, how about her crouch? Cant she teabag you too? Never played her so i have no idea
---
Ok then, so half of us are trash?
---
I have deuteranamoly. I can‚Äôt recall having much difficulty playing actually. Most games I change the color blind settings but had not even thought about it until I saw these posts. I play killer about as much as survivor and do well. For reference I failed, I think, 17 out of 20 slides on the dot test.
---
Edit: actually I have Deuteranopia, which is the more difficult form.
---
You really dont gotta be a dick about it dude
---
It‚Äôs never been this bad for both sides- and I don‚Äôt think the influx of new players is to blame.

Why not

Okay?

So yes, you can run multiple steam games at once.

Lmao!

CONTROLLER VS KEYBOARD IS UNFAIR
---
Bold of you to assume Tony Hawk isn't a killer
---
Console player here:
---
The only killer that is absolutely not fun to play against is Spirit. I think it is hot garbage for your ability to counterplay to be basically random.
---
Billy is strong. I don't see a lot of Nurses.
---
Honestly, I love the jumpscare killers the best. Michael/GF/Pig are fun to play against. I laugh every time I miss seeing a trap and get caught by the Trapper.
---
Killer wise, I would like to see Spirit brought down and have the other killers get some buffs.
---
I just wish matchmaking would be fixed, and I anxiously wait for working dedicated servers. It won't fix every problem and it'll even introduce some problems of its own, but the problems it will fix will feel good.
---
I think we've done a pretty good job so far
---
When tf did people start using Stranger Things player as an insult? Also, how is sick being used as an insult?

I bought the Santa outfit for my Clown last Christmas. His range is disappointingly limited though.

I said in my post, "I d/ced. I know, not cool to do." Perhaps you can't read. I very clearly acknowledged that it's not a good thing to do. Like why is argument even still happening?

---
This is a cannibals wet dream
---
Just you saying "it disintegrates" already shows how little you actually know on the topic.
---
Under rated comment
---
Yeah kind of sad. New players don't know any better. Because if the matchmaking I've been getting some games with low ranked survivors and killers, and once the rank 20 killers figure out who's the easiest to kill, they will just tunnel and camp them to death.
---
Through the gate?
---
...isn't that kinda the point?
---
Adam is black. Next dumb comment please?
---
Also I'm a white Male and play Feng, Claudette,  Jake and Michael.

Ah yes, an encounter between two supreme gentlemen.

And don't forget that amazing matchmaking rn. When rank 20, 11 and 3 play together. It's a mess. I'm getting sick &gt;&gt;
---
I stopped playing for a while and... I just came back so I'm pretty bad lol. Potato. And I get all ranks 1 - 3... so it's obviously not good for me. I just want to have fun... but yeah. It's pretty hard like that.
---
[Yup](https://youtu.be/5bUuptcEcWY)

She can but the teabag is slow, still gets the point across on downed survivors
---
I literally just looked it up ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è . Jesus Christ give me the patience and save me from people who like to belittle others !
---
Personally, i faced any lag switchers. Just very laggy killers and survivors. So it seems like there is problem with the game connection to other people.
---
I'd say demogorgon because of how fun everthing it has is but excluding him I'd say Freddy; weird how much the rework made a really good tv charcter a great game one too.
---
Dont bring an item
---
I know there are two black men, but again I‚Äôm not black or a man. I do not identify with them. I‚Äôm glad they are in the game at all but I think most of us like playing the gender we are or the race we are. Edit because you edited: Oh it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre white with how angry you are to be talking about race.  I did say ‚Äúmost‚Äù of us.

Exactly, but before remember me was powerful against the last survivor especially and wake up was something you put on because your a masochist who wants to waste a perk slot

why can‚Äôt i?

When 4 achievement whore survivors end up in the same lobby.
---
Sorry I just saw it on steam and thought it was funny. Didnt even see the other post :)
---
Just focus on one at a time, make each character you want 50, and youll slowly get what you want. 
---
As for the builds, just your three teachables and spine chill. thats what i did
---
Someone joked about using a lag switch and then said they're not joking.

That‚Äôs cringe bro

&gt;If I were a bad Demogorgon, I wouldn't be shitting here in the tall grass, discussing it with ya, now would I?!

FTFY ‚ô•
---
No. But then, if you'd used the search funtion, you'd know that...
---
If you get 5 stacks it will crash
---
Fuck, that is kinda better.
---
As far as i know on my experience, the most of the time you "fall" in the same cell where hatch is. At least hapoend 3 of 4 times to me, the one time i always "fall" behind the exit gate walls.
---
Smoke me
---
So after playing for a little bit longer, I've come up with some slightly more balanced perks.
---
I've Covered Wars. Upon entering a chase, if healthy: Receive a 10/7.5/5% speed reduction and suffer from the Exhausted status effect. If injured: gain a 5/7.5/10% speed boost and become undetectable for 15/20/25 seconds
---
Resourcefulness. When in the killer's terror radius, you open chests 50/75/100% faster and guarantees a very rare item within the first three chests you open. This does not stack with Pharmacy
---
Environmental Advantage: When you are the killers obsession, you gain the ability to use hatchets from lockers. These hatchets stun the killer for 1/1.5/2 seconds
---
I feel these are slightly more balanced, though Ennvironmental Advantage seems op to me, let me know
---
That's a good attitude towards it and if it's got a bunch of players maybe more effort gets put into more content.
---
Me wanting more poc in a game isn‚Äôt stupid or toxic lol and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very mature to react like an animal because you don‚Äôt like a comment from someone else. I never said this post was about race or tried to make it about race. I commented a desire of mine for more diversity and it made you angry because why dare I want more diversity in your game for only you to enjoy? You could‚Äôve just passed my comment but instead it made you full of rage which is concerning
---
Just 1 tho
---
doing gens, you?
---
Its 1 perk tho
---
Because becasue its only a very small portion of the playerbase that is colorblind. Im sure that they are working on it but it just isnt high on the list of priorities. The roadmap this year is packed with lots of new content that has also been asked for for a very long time. And even if they arent working on it right now that doesnt mean that they dont care about the game/players.
---
I remember some Trapper faked lag and I fell for it, thus fucking dying
---
Generally confused
---
First three suggestions are alright. Everything else is ???? So Ghost face can mark every survivor on the map by just staring at an AFK Meg? That sound awful. And no chase music would make PWYW hell to use on him.
---
Also the 'you don't lose stalk progress for hitting a survivor' would be 100% broken as shit. The best way to use Stalk is to Stalk survivors until they are 99% and then pop it right when you're on them just like Myers. Also stalking injured survivors to 99% so you can just insta down them later when they run off to heal. This means you can stalk a survivor to 99, down them normally, and then insta kill them later when they get unhooked. Wouldn't be fun.
---
"the rain sounds like claudette"

Huntress is free on PC too, Doc and Hag are the ones we get free that they don't.
---
Well it depends on your approach. As a stealthy main, you can apprehend survivors easier. Like I‚Äôve jump scared someone who quick vaulted and didn‚Äôt know I was there with ghost face and his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all ears‚Äù. For stealth I suggest Myers or Ghosty boi
---
If you want them to be distracted, try using plague or pig. With pig, you have to get rid of your new hat before you can leave. However, with plague, it‚Äôs really more about hearing survivors. 
---
However, it really depends on your approach.  I‚Äôm a stealth main, but I am daring so, if you do buy a killer, go for the dlc and not just the killer. It saves money and you get survivor as well because of the perks which are always good
---
Yeah, Red is the color that travels the farthest, so this idea that blue or green would make it unfair is ridiculous.
---
They already did it for events and such too, there is no reason other than they don‚Äôt care.
---
I think you need go double pip, surviving is not enough

This sub has a stickied post that links to the video you want: "best starting perks for every Killer."
---
Hi! I‚Äôm colorblind (protean) and I change the hue on my television to make the red turn blue. It helps with scratch marks and auras, but now I can‚Äôt tell if my perks are activated or not, since the hue change flips blue to red. The issue isn‚Äôt entirely the ‚Äúcolor‚Äù they use, but the density and/or intensity of the auras. If the reds they use were brighter, we could see it. Now, a colorblind mode would be excellent for everyone, especially on pc, but proper integration would be a priority. It needs to be tested on people who are colorblind first and foremost. Example: borderlands 2 had a colorblind mode for deuters and protans, yet even with the settings, the blues and purples, the yellows and greens, and the pink and grays were still too blended to notice any difference. I still had a really hard time discerning between cash on the ground, and a green grenade mod. Intensity is key. Bright red, deep orange, yellow, blue, dark purple, dark green, and hot pink are the easiest to see visually for someone colorblind.
---
Cursed as always, I love it

Oh I understood, I just wanted to show that in no way did I even have remotely a toxic build. It was Bitter Murmur 1 as well.

The game itself says the entity feasts on hope, and torture, not death. And then when you‚Äôre sacrificed, you still live. Just a bit of your soul is chipped away
---
That skin looks really good
---
Imagine if they added killers as survivors before they became killers, that would be sick.
---
I would say its more about the journey and not the destination. You hook everyone once... you didn't really do that much.
---
I hope there's another story to go with it
---
Dc'ing survivors just as annoying 4 a killer main:you queue for a match for an absolute eternity, only to find the survivors disconnect.
---
hey man I appreciate the awareness these posts bring, especially this one that demonstrates the issue, but it's also nice you aren't just milking this for karma, so gg and keep on being a great human being :)
---
The three strongest Killers for teachable perks are Bubba, Myers, and Piggy. Clown and Spirit are also good buys, but a bit more challenging to pick up for a new player.
---
 But it is so unfriendly towards new players. we got SOOOOO much grinding to do just to get some basic perks
---
1. No, that's not even *close* to what it is. If you stalk somebody who is already marked, you build progress towards *that survivor's* next mark. 
---
2. I explicitly said it doesn't *actually* stop chases from occurring, it just makes him silent. It doesn't even make it  hard to tell, you get the "Survivor Found" BP event. 
---
3. Myers doesn't lose stalk progress when he M1's. Ghostface shouldn't either,  especially with all the downsides his stalking has compared to Myers. 
---
4. You realize the situation you describe literally happens on live right now? It's called "being injured", and it's the way every survivor is after being unhooked.
---
So do you have head on or are you just admiring these lockers lol
---
Exactly this happened to me today :(
---
Okay, so they are being jerks then.
---
Or flat out broke
---
The funny thing is that you only get matched with your opposite. Rank 20 Killers are where all of your Red rank would-be opponents are currently.

Not to be confused with the demongorgon, the demonpupper attract survivors with his cuteness, for then strike

Power    
---
Attraction
---
While survivor are in your terror radious, look at that survivor, press the power button to attract him, attracting survivor won't allow them to look back, survivors will get closer and closer slowly until the power gage run out
---
Anytime you attract more than 1 survivor, gain 1 token for eaxh extra survivor in the attraction range, 3 tokens will be spent for increasing the speed at wich survivor get closer to you up to 5 times faster
---

You like being petted, but not too much, survivors too close to you will be attacked without damaging them,  while your attack animation is on, but you didn't hit no one, the mend status effect will be apllied to them

While carrying a survivor, you will push away other survivors trying to block your path

Each 60 seconds you are able to screaming (or borking) a high pitched sound wave, in your terror radious, stunning the survivors from anything they are doing for 1 second, do not work in a chase

Halloween, Leatherface &amp; Shattered Bloodline are all good picks
---
Otzdarva has perk recommendations and the like on his channel. If you want to experiment for yourself, a good option is to level every character to 10, then try their Adept achievements. See what perks you have the most fun using, then prioritize those teachables.
---
Lol today I waved at a ghostface standing behind a tree to help me with a gen. Lets just say big mistake.
---
I‚Äôd suggest just slugging and not tunnelling or camping to minimise disconnects but also reduce the amount of opportunities for hatch escapes.
---
Yeah, if it's dial up then don't play killer. What gets me is the survivors who willingly go into a red ping game. And then complain about it. Like really?
---
True
---
Except DbD is HARD to mess around in. You'll get a chat full of people yelling at you. If you're Survivor, you didn't try hard enough and compromised the team. If you're Killer, your lack of addons, weird/bad perks, and refusal to kill the team baby mean nothing, you're bad at the game and that's grounds to insult you.
---
It's very "no fun allowed" unless you're particularly selfish or get matched with some decent people.
---
Sometimes you just get outplayed :/
---
Wow. I usually don‚Äôt find meme funny but this is! I mean I didn‚Äôt laugh but it touched my brain in a tickling way. Keep memeing
---
&gt; Anyone who thinks the game is the strongest killer map just isn't good at Dead by Daylight.
---
I agree, but what's sad is I've only faced maybe like 3 dozen survivors that know The Game. That's part of why it's so low on the escape rate graph. The other part is that its size/visibility make Nurse/Hag/Huntress/Doctor busted on it.
---
you are what is so annoying with reddit
---
Oh don't worry, the most """toxic""" build I ever done is Doctor with Overcharge, Ruin ad something something for the two others...

Please don't crucify me on the main street I got plans for next week.

Everytime a Freddy hits a lunge on Springwood, someone in another trial gets hit on Haddonfield.

They are, but they get inside your head. And then you argue with them for a good 10 minutes. Which is a pain in ass to deal with. But the fastest way i have found, to shut them down is just ask for proof.
---
Hawkins still has like, an average of what, 7 or 8 safe pallets? That is on top of the like 20 other pallets, and not counting the BL drops and windows.

Everybody is posting like unsafe pallets count for nothing.

Yes you do unless you get it from the shrine of secrets

You say that, but I've never had it. Survivors on my team had had it though.
---
Nancy has to go; her people need her.
---
It definitely is. My friend is rank 8 and I'm rank 10 survivor. We played what turned out to be a baby Trapper. I felt so bad afterwards for kiting and pallet stunning the guy like four times after I found out.
---
I'm consulting this for some loose ideas: https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/
---
So far: 
---
-This is Not Happening should be added to No Mither's benefits, or merged with Resilience. Perhaps even all three.
---
-No One Left Behind would merge well with Hope.
---
-Slippery Meat and Small Game would be somewhat overkill to merge, but could make a strong learner crutch against Trap Killers.
---
-Deja Vu and Dark Sense make a great combo.
---
But they were still able to port it to the Switch
---
If you already have BBQ, try to level Myers and Amanda ASAP. Their teachables provude a strong base for learning any other Killer. Nurse's perks are strong too, but she's one of the hardest Killers to learn and her perks are often on the Shrine.
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
me like this
---
Ok I appreciate the feed back
---
I ran a doctor during end game made it to the exit like 3 seconds before death but i ran right through it and died and i was like wtf

DCing to get out of the dreamstate
---
u are so high skilled

So many bb‚Äôs playing right now. I have been neglecting survivor since rank reset. Call me Captain Save a Noob.

Didn‚Äôt loose bp but I got an extra daily which I though was weird.
---
Played 3 games in rank 7 today to see how much i get bullied. All matches were 4mans, his ability to slow down a game is incredible, just take Thanatophobia, Sloppy, Ruin, CoulroPhobia and his mend addons and survivors wont heal anymore those matches were fun... but still.... Buff legion, i want them stronkkk
---
Maybe that's you being the common thread and not each and every killer having bad internet.
---
Poor Freddy
---
Legacy is a type of cosmetic, in the pic it‚Äôs the trousers! It was a reward for players that prestiged back in 2016 before a certain point when they changed the bloodwebs because it was too much of a grind
---
Oh absolutely. No showing the DBD community
---
&gt;Except it's not, because BBQ &amp; Chili has an effect ON TOP OF its BP awards. WGLF is functionally an empty perk slot until after the game.
---
People keep forgetting that a side-effect of WGLF is incentivizing people to actually go be altruistic towards their teammates instead of just sitting on gens or hiding in a corner, just like BBQ+C incentivizes the killer to go after another survivor instead of just staying and camping.
---
Doing you, gens?
---
Because most players don't get mad when they get tbagged. I tbag as both killer and survivor and in rare instances players will get pissed and camp me or call me an asshole in post game chat. That rarely happens. When it does happen I just laugh it off because the person is being immature. 
---
Anyways, unlike what you think, I don't really give a fuck about what you think of me. I ain't got a problem of you think of me as an ass just because I tbag. I could care less because it don't matter at all about if I tbag or not.
---
I hate the perk because it's like a roulette for everyone: will it get destroyed within a minute being useless for me? Will it last all game? Will my team find it? Will my team ignore and do gens? Will my team be fuckass useless by not doing gens but also not finding it?
---
Pls delete it and just find a way to make games last just a tiny bit longer
---
I only recently experienced it.  The killer was waiting at the gate and I just didn't know what the fuck to do.  I didn't get lucky like OP did, I ended up getting killed by the endgame collapse.  I could tell something was off when I went through the exit gate and a tree was in the way.
---
What was the grind like?
---
Ah so scratches being closer together still wouldn't do enough. It's just all black, eh? Damn...
---
I'm hyped for that but wait mobile version excuse me what? How did I miss that and how are they planing on doing that?
---
I see no entity up here.

#OTHER THAN ME

I would run windstorm and then the other add on that let‚Äôs you kick pallets super fast. Helps a lot with killing loops.
---
I will farm blood points on my favored killer to pour in to the characters whose perks I want. It‚Äôs how I got some good ones like Hex Ruin and Nurse‚Äôs calling. Takes some time but double BP weekend is coming up.
---
Make your choice, save the best for last
---
FUS RO DA
---
No problem.
---
He is talking about the chase music when you play as killer.
---
Thank you so much :D. I will remember this :)
---
To be exact, you have to charge it to 65%. You cant do it literally right after right clicking. But 65% of 1 second is literally .65 seconds so it's still very fast.
---
I main killer, and I have been getting nothing but survivor rituals. Every game I've gone for a ritual, I've asked my teammates for unhooks, door unlocks, etc. They've all been very obliging. 
---
Much love to the everyone on the SWF side. I promise you that when I long-range hatchet you, I'll feel that much more guilty for it.
---
I straight up CAN'T see blood on the ground unless I use bloodhound. I was talking to a friend the other day and he was confused by that, he told me he can see it fine. I wish there was settings like this so I could at least sort of see the blood on maps with a green floor like the red forest
---
Xbox?
---
i fucking love how many gays play this game lmao
---
What Video of him is that? You got the name or a link?
---
It‚Äôs a problem on Xbox, happens when I solo queue
---
Where is little claudette? How does all this archive stuff work? I'm kind of new lol
---
That would actually be pretty unnerving to see in game, ngl
---
I went to the config in AppData and changed the internal resolution quality
---
And that's why more companies should follow Activision's example and put proper support in their games. CoD changes all vital elements (minimap, name tags, aura) to be easily readable.
---
Blame the incompetent devs, not the PLAYERS. BLAME the game, not the PLAYER , but being a cunt in chat is you, that's definitely YOU!
---
Sure.
---
Beautiful work as always. Could do the Doctor human form maybe later?
---
I am actually crying
---
.... welp the more y'know
---
Congrats. You described a situation with a 1 shot killer.
---
no one wants to spend 3 years mending just to get hit again. I can deal with base mend of 12~ seconds, but increasing that, then running Sloppy with Thanat? you are just asking for dcs.
---
That poor poor sharp hand Joe
---
Why would I want to run multiple games at the same time? I can only play one at a time.
---
There are also cases of NOED and Bubba. I don‚Äôt know who pissed in your cereal but you can definitely secure more than 1 kill
---
Technically speaking as far as my game files are concerned it is ‚Äúturned off‚Äù, but it really only applys during a full lunge not for slashes.
---
Just no why do people find huntress attractive
---
Didn't think it would take that much effort to fix the resolution
---
Kid proceeded to brag about how he and his friend just finished ‚Äúrunning a train on me‚Äù in the game. Probably safe to assume they were playing as a team lol
---
Prob.
---
Fam.
---
While the facial animations for F13 are godawful, I don't think the static faces an most DbD characters are any better in comparison. Just look at poor Nancy who's stuck always making a serious face or Meg who looks like a Neanderthal. If I'm not wrong the only characters with actual unique facerigs in DbD are the unmasked Killers that have come out since Clown's release, and wow are they pretty damn amazing.
---
I feel like that would make it stronger. It‚Äôs fairly easy to hook at least 3 people in a match, meaning about 3 different people are permanently exposed. There is zero counterplay. Sure, the killer has to work for it, but still, they get it by simply playing the game. This ‚Äúrework‚Äù would only really need it for campers and killers who are very very new to the game.
---
This is how it feels to play dbd in general, not just survivor
---
Thanks for educating me a little bit this afternoon
---
Nope PC
---
Dead Adam jumpscares her
---
I also play console- ps4, but rarely play survivor cuz none of my mates plate the game :( . Anyway I hear a lot that spirit is just bs to counterplay, cuz there is none. In my comment I was referring to how good the killers are to face and play as, not enjoyability. However the games relatively balanced atm, there‚Äôs just some bs that needs work
---
It got worse 13 1  1 and 11

Nvidia experience you can save the gameplay. Pretty sure you can do same on consoles
---
Nice dude!

Hold up I thought the subreddit didn't allow names in images?
---
I would highly recommend sticking to licensed DLCs (Halloween Chapter, Saw Chapter, Leatherface Chapter, and so on), as the unlicensed DLC characters can all be bought with ingame currency (it takes quite a while, but it's definitely doable).
---
With this in mind, if you play killer at all, I highly recommend Leatherface. He comes with three powerful perks (one of which, BBQ and Chili, is perhaps the most useful perk in the game), and he's a fun killer to start with, even if he isn't very powerful down the line. Alternatively, Freddy Kreuger is one of the most fun killers to play as, but his perks aren't as useful
---
If you're more of a survivor player, there's honestly not \*too\* much difference. Laurie Strode (from Halloween) has a nice perk Decisive Strike, and Detective Tapp (from Saw) has Stakeout which I enjoy as well as a very dark default cosmetic, but none of them would really be must-haves like Nancy Wheeler, whom you already have

---
A Trapper I got against had this happen while he was placing traps so he just decided to farm
---
If Remember Me wasn‚Äôt already a thing, they could have easily given NOED a slower exit gate opening time based on the number of times survivors have been hooked.
---
The game is shittly optimised, but I have 1070 ti and it‚Äôs beautiful. You could verify integrity of game files ( might not do shit but takes seconds). Update your game drivers, do a GPU benchmark test to see if that can identify the problems.
---
I'm currently experiencing A LOT of moments I cannot pull down the pallet. I see the interaction is available. I try to time it right and it's about 4 - 7 days that I just cannot pull it down in time but receive a ridiculous lunge hit... I blame the ping, even though I avoid any match above 100 ms latency.
---
That hit you lmao
---
Probably because he was body blocking the exit for everyone.

I mean u brought an ultra rare and still lost

Got a match as Ghostface today where I was able to put some really juicy tricks off like "assassinating" from high ground, gengrabs, all that kind of stuff. It really felt good being able to play a stealth killer with a high amount of jumpscare factor. And most importantly, in postgame chat I was actually praised for playing that well stealthwise. That really put a smile on my face.
---
This would be great. I would be so mad tho when I watch the Claudette in the corner the whole game
---
But it's more than simply playing the game for killer, it's playing the game reasonably well.  Is it particularly difficult to hook all 4 survivors during a match?  No.  It's probably about as easy as popping all 5 gens, which is the condition for Adrenaline.  But I don't think survivors get Adrenaline by just "playing the game," they get Adrenaline by playing the game reasonably well and completing their objectives.  I think this version of NOED mirrors that aspect of Adrenaline.
---
And I disagree about the zero counterplay.  Just because the counterplay isn't as simple as "oh cool, I turned off his ability by destroying this totem," doesn't mean there is zero counterplay.  The counterplay is to play immersed if you're exposed, use the information provided by the HUD like I described, and make plays accordingly.  If you're not exposed, then you know you need to be working on a door or bodyblocking for a teammate or making the hook save.  I think survivors in this game are too used to the idea of "counterplay" being "I literally negate your ability if I do this" instead of what it should be, which is situational awareness and not playing like an idiot.
---
Head on the best thing to ever happen to this game
---
Been out since release, it didn‚Äôt start of as a hex it was the same as is now but oh can‚Äôt destroy it, but they even shortened cool downs on swings with it, then they added a 120 second timer, then it was a hex, then it‚Äôs now without the swing cool down. It won‚Äôt get changed, just slight indirect nerfs, such as inner strength, gives the incentive for survivors to break totems for the free heal.
---
Why would you not want to save your teammate if you have a perfect opportunity
---
Disgusted.
---
Honestly though, could someone actually exploit it for an advantage? If scratch marks/auras were not meant to be known information to the player, then they wouldn't appear.  If they appear, everyone should be able to see them.
---
Don't really think NOED needs a rework considering that it already has a fairly easy and obvious counter.
---
I feel a sudden urge to be crushed.
---
I never claimed the game was balanced around red rank. Although I agree all games should be balanced around the highest rank.
---
What I did claim is the game is not heavily survivor sided if at all. Even if you want to throw out all data because it doesnt support your argument you ignored the post from the game developer specifically saying rank 1 survival rate is around 43% not the ridiculous 80 or 60 percent.
---
And then yesterday I was getting really mad because I was getting bullied as demogorgon and wasn‚Äôt getting bbq, finally after like 2 mil bloodpoints and I spent 4K iridescent shards on killer perks I already have in shrine I finally get bbq level 1
---
I would love if they did a Dart skin. They didn‚Äôt give DEMOGORGON a bonus cosmetic from purchasing it of steam. Only Steve and Nancy, which they got tears in a top which isn‚Äôt great. They had so much potential to create and use great cosmetics from the show
---
In the friends menu you can go to ‚Äúrecently met‚Äù and see it there I believe
---
I like how Overwatch allows players to choose an enemy color, so instead of red, it can be changed to yellow, green, blues, pink .etc.
---
That could be a thing of they categorize auras. survivor Auras - Yellow, Killer Aura - Pink, Chest Auras - Pink. Or they can setup Aura colors per perk.
---
They‚Äôre working on the dedicated servers!
---
That *should* fix the matchmaking issues
---
By level do you mean rank.
---
I mean you think its a reason to be toxic? I just bought the doctor and there is literally no reason to be. If you are a rank 1killer its fine for you. I dont care i just want to have fun. What is the point of your comment? Are you that toxic Meg?
---
Hilarious
---
\&gt;survivors play so terribly they all die in 1 hook
---
\&gt;killer gets punished
---
Makes sense.
---
And i get that, people with McDonalds wifi shouldn't be killer. And the survivor que times are awful. But the people i am talking about are those who act like the wifi police
---
Hold the button you use the turn on the controller, go to Dead by Daylight on the left side and go to "Playing With" I think. Then you just find the one that isn't a survivor you're playing with. Took me wayyyy too long to figure this out initially lol. Freaked me out at first.
---
Oh look another "me hate spirit" meme
---
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
---
Boy got some legs
---
How are survivors OP if they have a 43% survival rate at rank 1? What do you consider a win from a killer? 2 kills as long as you pip is what im saying. So if 2 survivors escape you can still win as killer.
---
Imagine working on a generator then outta no where a giant testicle looking monster flys at you at 100 miles per hour and downs you
---
And thats why your altruism score is always bronze
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right. I never knew this is possible!
---
Shitposts is more like memes and thinks of the like, this falls under Oversaturated Content which is endgame chat, and scoreboards, salty messages and threats to quit the game
---
You are cancer means, the doctor needs to get it. Not you. Then he would prob say, get cancer. :)
---
i cant believe people still get upset over a dumbass comment like that, Yes the killer should be *temp* banned but like the killer obi wanted this reaction from the survivors.
---
Yeah it was months before I ran into it then I think I came on here to figure it out LOL
---
sounds really broken tbh

---
He could also see the aura of a sleeping player if they got too far from him, No players could see him while awake so it was a matter of luck wether you ran into him or away once he started to cast his sleeping aoe. I believe the sound was also omnidirectional so you literally couldn't tell.
---
Tyde did the exact same thing back when me mained Smite. Built up a pretty good following off of Duel and then quit it and lost everything.
---
knowing behavior this won't be fixed till they -slightly- mention it in the year 5 road map or some shit

Why would you want an add-on for the worst map. It's so goddamn big it's not even fun to play on (as killer and survivor)

That‚Äôs a hit.

Wait I'm confused. What happened?
---
Matchmaking and game loading is extra broken right now post patch.
---
The whole dead hard bug still being a thing is pretty annoying. You can tell when it happens too since you jitter on the ground nonstop and cant move.
---
The only killers who really use NOED vs other much better perks are ones who mostly have vanilla perks and it is a better option than some others that are complete garbage.
---
You can feel the sadness in this video
---
Dead by Escape
---
What‚Äôs an archive? I‚Äôm probs really dumb
---
Self-Heal bug
---
Great concept op tho
---
I knew the Yeti was lackluster when I designed him, your criticism is absolutely correct.
---
Rage!: I intended for this to only start once the stun is over, and Unbreakable and/or Spirit Fury would help make it powerful. Considering NOED gives a haste bonus of 5%, I thought it was enough.
---
Pummel Them!: You're right, I totally forgot about adding upgrades. Your suggestion suits me.
---
The Terrible Snowman: You know what, I don't like his power either. How about this instead: When pressing M2, the beast charges up a roar for 1 second, before growling which can be heard across the map. Survivors within his terror radius will obtain a stack of "Fear". (Similar to the Doctor) At Fear level 1, whenever inside the beast's terror radius, the screen darkens and survivors become blinded. At Fear level 2, whenever inside the beast's terror radius, all effects of Fear level 1 are applied, while also causing survivors to scream when they reach Fear level 2. At Fear level 3, survivors will scream again, have all effects of Fear level 1 and added to that is that survivors will find it more difficult to turn their vision away from the killer while inside its terror radius. The survivor will need to continue rotating the camera away from the killer to look in front of them as it will automatically try to center itself on the killer. (Similar to the hag's traps that controls your screen.) When downing a survivor in Fear level 3, all survivors will gain a small increase in their Fear progression.
---
Secondary effect: By pressing Ctrl the Beast will go on all fours and gain a building increase in movement speed up to an extra 15%. (Slower than the hillbilly but slightly easier to control) The Beast cannot end this charge in an attack, but he can end it in a roar.
---
I thought the genrush perk was uninspired and was a cheap way to not really think of a good third one, you make another excellent point.
---
I thought of something else. How about: The money's good enough: When unhooking another survivor, gain a haste bonus of 150% your normal speed for 3 seconds. Taking a hit for another survivor within 7/8/10 seconds of unhooking a survivor negates the damage completely. If you take a hit for another survivor in that time you become exhausted for 60/50/40 seconds. (I felt this may be on par with Borrowed Time)
---
I liked the idea of a secondary objective. I didn't like people getting their vial and walking into killer to suicide. I don't think that would happen with a permanent objective or one with a cap so the experiment was flawed.
---
How can I loop this?! Amazing!

I agree I had about 5 games this weekend 1 right after the next where they were all ranked 4 to 8 ima level 15. One group was so toxic when I got them again I just played toxic as hell. Face camped then slugged them all as they came to rescue each other. Hate playing this way but was very satisfying and still got massive salt in comments after.
---
Really enjoyed it just to trash them but not the spirit of the game
---
Don‚Äôt care
---
Why is everyone now milking this for karma?
---
Well this is new. Never seen this oversaturate the DBD sub.
---
The only things I cant hear is breathing and hex totems unless Im literally on top of the surv/totem. But footsteps, grass, etc is fine.
---
Ill be honest hes not as op as i thought he was when i first foundout, but i wouldnt say hes underpowered
---
Not bitch and cry. Maybe learn how to play before you say it‚Äôs a shitty game
---
I honestly think Spirit would be okay if they tuned her a bit and changed her add-ons that make her broken. Hillbilly is strong but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs broken like Nurse, I still don‚Äôt understand why they made a killer that basically completely ignores the core mechanics of playing against killers
---
Ironically enough, i was the only one to escape through the gate.

---
Damn u ok?
---
I did like the lanterns. Maybe not as much on killer (hitting the post felt weird).
---
You should, more bps for more stuff.
---
Fun concept. But you've got too much movement speed build in. There would be no running from this MFer after the first down. 
---
Maybe balance it and give him a speed debuff when around fully powered generators?

Yeah, I try to angle it right. It's easier depending on killer. Trapper is horizontal across the screen, so you can look over it. I'll see what I can do.

Ive started doing this now that i got WGLF off david.
---
I would argue you‚Äôre entirely wrong, most good builds on lower tier killers are about time conservation and intel, so you can expend a few moments to ambush, but not necessarily at an unsuspecting survivor, crouching and ambushing during a loop can make it much tighter on the surv because of the speed and distance she can travel, you‚Äôre either playing her wrong or don‚Äôt play many high rank pigs, ambush can be a nightmare to play against with its range and accuracy

I asked him to be sacrificed for the cause since he bodyblockedand he accepted once he finished his daily.
---
I‚Äôm just thinking about the one person Gen in the room by itself, can Myers just body block the exit and stalk someone fully without them being able to do anything?
---
whatd he say
---
No I mean when you see the save use the port first if you haven't used the portal they can't see it I just like top better but if you like bottom can't argue with that
---
&gt; just don't give up on the game
---
Haha, I ain't giving up on it (I bought it on release), I just simply play it very sporadically. Every few months, ususally when it's on sale/free.
---
I love spooking complete newcomers to the game; chasing them overdramatically, missing clean shots, not noticing the dwight that just hid in a locker in plain sight, etc. Giving people a scare is far more fun for both of us than trap-camping your first hook.
---
On the other hand, I completely dislike high-level play, because it is more about minmaxing perks etc. than actually having fun.

What about the host connection problems? Is this also a recent bug?
---
Trapper should be able to carry all of his traps at base like Hag, Freddy and Demogorgon with his portals. Only carrying one trap at base is a joke. Think Bloody Coil at base is a bit too strong but maybe make the add on lower in rarity and more commonly found. I like the idea of the proximity visual on survivors. Give survivors the oblivious effect maybe while disarming them.
---
Considering the games record and how often stuff like this happens I highly doubt its faked. Besides, there is nothing to gain from faking something like this.
---
^^^^Morimebunnymommy
---
but is it a safe pallet?
---
I respectfully disagree, it don't think it will see that much use once a killer realises that a survivor is carrying Strongarm. The killer will prioritise breaking pallets and perhaps Brutal Strength will see meta gameplay to counter Strongarm becoming meta. I'd be surprised if it saw more than 3 uses in one match, which, granted, is quite similar to how often other survivor perks see use. Poised for example can be triggered a maximum of 5 times a game. DS can be used once. DS is still meta due to its powerful game-changing effect, but Strongarm can be a real bully if the killer decides to not prioritise pallets which is when the effect of the perk becomes a real problem. But other than that, pressing space-bar counters this perk, so it's not crazy strong, especially when you consider that it causes exhausted and perks like Lithe and Balanced landing won't trigger for a while.
---
It's the free to play weekend for dbd, It happened last time
---
Survivors get oblivious when they sleep now, no addons.
---
Could you post a www.speedtest.net screenshot
---
It's okay to lose. It's not okay to be tunneled harder than a bull going after a matador and not being able to jack shit besides mash space and die for minimal bp and a depip
---
Give Trapper a bag base kit.  His biggest weakness is always having to use an addon to increase his ability to carry traps.  Bloody Coil should stay an addon the effect is too strong.  Bag for sure and maybe lower percentage to free self from trap.
---
HAHA completely accurate! Friendly t-bags with fellow survivors are my favorite!
---
Safe loop.
---
Adrenaline is different than NOED. It‚Äôs over in like 5 seconds and half the time it‚Äôs not anything more than a sprint burst. It‚Äôs a powerful situational perk but useless when you‚Äôre not in a chase. Whenever NOED pops, you can insta down anyone and get a speed boost till your totem is destroyed. And one good thing about NOED is it forces survivors to slow down the game since they have to cleanse totems. With your change no one would ever cleanse dull totems and look for them ending games much faster, which every killer main would burn you at the stake for.
---
Its a real life god palet

---
Why not? It‚Äôs part of the game. Your team should gen rush and let you die. One man loses but three win. Then move on to the next. I got facecamped by a Billy last night then moved on and got a 4E against a ghost face. If tunneling is an issue, run DS and Iton Will and stealth out after the DS.

That's how it used to be, 0/1 kill was Entity displeased, 2 was Ruthless, 3 was Brutal and 4 was merciless. They changed it so that merciless only gets activated on double pip.
---
This is only a problem with the end tags, but BHVR should definetly fix it
---
Yes.
---
All of his traps seems a bit much to me. Making his strongest bag add on part of his base kit sounds better I think
---
They're erased. Happy now?
---
I'm just kidding, don't hurt me.
---
DrongoJuice: I just randomly came from that other thread where you were arguing with that guy and saw you comment again... you seem like you're still upset and lashing out at random people now because that other person riled you up. Stahp pls, there's really no need to be that mean over nothing :P
---
What happened to Tyde?
---
A lot of these players are new and have no clue what they are doing.
---
nice
---
Pitter patter
---
New devour hope buff, survivors can't see shit lmao
---
I can confirm this. He gets into that pose whenever he gets in a Chase and stays in the pose for a few seconds after losing said chase.
---
As someone who‚Äôs extremely colourblind I agree.
---
Mild Protan here, the shitty part about being colorblind is not knowing what the actual color is supposed to look like because I can‚Äôt just look through someone else‚Äôs eyes. I can say I‚Äôve had more trouble with this as survivor, as a simple mistake can cost you the game. Whereas killer I can just play on.
---
What made Freddy so bad was most players misplaying his old kit and losing games playing him as a mindless tunnel machine like old Legion.  For those of us that adapted their playstyle around his kit they were quite deadly with him.  While I'm okay with the rework I actually greatly preferred the old kit.
---
You had loads of information at all times from the aura reading and could really use it to juggle targets and create tons of pressure.  You could allow them to get away from you after the first hit or dream transition and than mindgame the shit out of them by cutting them off with odd pathing and playing him as a Spoopy Jump Scare killer.  Survivors being asleep actually meant something with the dramatic action speed penalty.  
---
He got a bad rap but if you played to his strengths he could be quite devastating and some of us were extremely consistent with him.
---
Losing blood literally
---
Which is why their recent ones have worked so well! Which are you referring to in ur last comment?
---
Yeah, like just stop being colorblind LOOOOOOOOL
---
Funny, I deranked from rank 1 to rank 18 as killer and I was expecting to bully baby survivors. I didn't, I'm stuck playing with red ranks and DS every 5 seconds.
---
Is it too strong? Think of other killer‚Äôs powers. Is it any nastier than fake pallets, vile purge, or feral frenzy? I don‚Äôt think so.
---
I dunno about at base. Maybe that‚Äôs what purple bag could do while yellow bag does what purple bag does now. 
---
Oblivious while disarming wouldn‚Äôt do much. Takes so little time to disarm those.
---
lmao look out long haired kate is gunna fuck you up
---
I wish ü§§
---
Base bloddy coil for trapper sounds op in my opinion. Make is traps take as long to disarm as a totem or 10 second (somewhere in that range). give him all his traps on him like hag. make his bag addons give him additional traps.
---
Wraith buff sounds ok tbh
---
Hits should add madness but not a full state maybe like a quarter to half a state. the range addons need some downside otherwise the green plus yellow snipe would be too op
---
Could you actually make it to 4 hooks from that spot? I believe if you're unlucky the nearest hook from that spot is a while away

Ok, but like, do you have a slow upload speed to share?
---
My issue with them is that every game I play typically ends with 2 or more disconnects.
---
there's glasses that exist to help with this, there's also mods online to help. maybe research before you comment?
---
Summon the color blind filter!!!!
---
* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, ‚Ä¶).
---
There are a lot of DC's happening since the update on both sides, survivors being kicked on hooks and I had one killer game that kicked me when I was running up to the open exit door. So some of them are from the game. However, the killers that DC and you gain no points, lose your item and offering are closing the app.
---
Yes it came with The Stranger Things patch. 
---
You wont see the extra perks until level 40 though.
---
For Trapper all I desire is 2 traps by default and the ability to reset them without having to pick them up. That way when you're carrying your limit you don't have to awkwardly set one down to reset another.
---
No I don‚Äôt play with slow speeds, since killer is the host of any given lobby, someone how has less that ideal internet speeds really shouldn‚Äôt be playing killer, it fucks over everyone else
---
Well David was free on console but Tapp and Laurie? No, you need to pay for them. Maps on the other hand are free for everyone and is thrown into the game with the updates. Unless you mean that you can play with players using those characters? Basically, characters are locked until purchase, but you can see and play with others using them because they are installed into the game via update. Maps are always free.
---
I‚Äôd say his biggest weakness is the ability of survivors to disable a trap with very minor penalty, especially at distance. The bag add ons could be changed as I said in another comment. Purple bag makes him start with all of them, yellow does what purple currently does, and gray could do what yellow currently does.
---
There are like no safe pallets on that map, love playing killer on it.
---
It's probably just not a priority for them, they're aware of the demand for colorblind modes, but it's honestly a small % of people and I imagine they have it on their "to-do" list but it's not a top priority, it's somewhere on the end of the list if I had to guess and I imagine; to them allocating these resources somewhere else is more efficient.
---
If ya'll want them to hurry up, spam them (everywhere) for a week or so about it and they'll have to react. Obviously this does not ensure that you'll get it faster.
---
It's a part of the game in that they didn't bother to do anything to stop it outside a very few perks. And if it's 'part of the game' windows shouldn't need entity blockers, we should have more pallets again, etc.
---
Sitting on a hook and doing nothing/getting nothing is, not, fun.
---
And using those perks to protect yourself usually ends up with the killer just going even harder after you. It will just never be fun, there's no ifs ands or buts.

Cropped a few things because I don't know if anything on that page is personal information, but I there you go. It makes me sad. :(
---
Don't forget the random 30 FPS drops for no reason on settings anywhere higher than Low after ST patch. Or the VFX effects causing insanely huge framerate drops for months.
---
I see I see.
---
Thanks.
---
Can't freddy see survivor auras when they are asleep?
---
I miss Evolve.
---
All I gotta say is that aged kinda poorly
---
I don‚Äôt see why he should be the only trap based killer
---
In the game that has to find his traps. Also not having his traps laying on the ground disarmed at the start of the game will help him keep some element of surprise. Not going to know it‚Äôs him until you either see him or step in/disarm a trap.
---
Ok so instead of adding colorblind settings, bhvr should just tell colorblind people to spend a few hundred bucks each on a pair of glasses to play their game? And yes, mod an always online game that has anticheat, very smart
---
To be fair almost every pallet on that map is unsafe like that lol
---
And that children is why you stat away from lockers
---
What about base bloody coil sounds OP? What kind of stuff would happen in trapper games that would be total BS? Remember, injured survivors could disarm without penalty. 
---
Half state would be alright. Point is to increase how often survivors have to deal w t3 madness. Remember that doc has no movement abilities so limiting the rate at which survivors complete objectives is probably the main avenue to fix his weaknesses.
---
Why is yellow snipe plus green OP? You‚Äôre not dodging it if you‚Äôre on a gen even with the increased charge time.
---
Right then: It probably has something to do with hosting, because I can play every other Online game just fine. I've heard others were able to play fine though despite their speeds, which is why I'm investigating this again. Thanks though.
---
Yup that's why you gotta learn not to stick with them lol
---
Could be the software you are using to record, unless you experience the same thing without running it.
---
Could also be a bug, several people have complained about worse frame rates since the last patch.
---
You could try stuff like disabling shadows in your graphic card settings if possible, that should free up some processing power.
---
Survivors and killers both have disadvantages and advantages in the game. The circle affects both parties.  For survivors, the circle appears after the killer hooks the survivor and it makes it difficult to see the killer. For killers, the circle appears after completing the gen and it makes it difficult to see survivors. 
---
Disclaimer: This may or may not be the purpose of it but it's a logical reason.
---
I know that's how it used to be, so they need to fix it!
---
Hol up. How'd you get over 80k bps from one match?
---
He should be this way because he‚Äôs the only trap based killer who‚Äôs traps directly cause damage
---
I get the reasoning behind that statement, but that's a really really bad answer to that question haha
---
Welcome to video garmes
---
No thats my uaername
---
Please don't play killer with bad internet. It ruins the game for everyone else.
---
Oh yeah. I miss the old days of seeing a survivor unhooking someone in front of me and me being forced to watch that. He was so strong, like 7 seconds to hit someone, that is so op.
---
No. Just stop. Old Freddy was worse than Nurse without blinks.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be loud, just a little sound of rain would make the map much more dynamic and unique.
---
How? I honestly think it was a great response to an asshole pushing away new players.
---
Ah OK yeah you can get Hawkins ID card add-on it's really rare though and I've only found it once
---
cool
---
I used to feel a similar way to you, but having the perspective of following the game updates for almost 2 years, they've improved a LOT since I started playing and implemented several of the most requested updates by the community, even if it took a while sometimes. They completely changed my opinion of them over time. 
---
The game is going through a rough patch right now because dedicated servers are so new, but it should be fixed soon.
---
Overbuffing is a bit too broad a statement. Buffing the momentum from a trapped person would be... something. Bloody coil doesn‚Äôt increase the momentum he gains from a trapped survivor. It slows the progression of a game and the interaction survivors have w traps outside of a chase.
---
But then again, god forbid trapper stop being a killer many survivors see as an easy escape
---
You had to look at a survivor for 7 seconds without being able to hit them, making unhooks super easy unless you were very close to the hook. And he had 0 chase power. 
---
He was probably worse than a Nurse without blinks.
---
But there is a distinction between ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù (hook kill) and a ‚Äúkill by hand‚Äù (Mori, DH, Rancor). If Adept triggered upon sacrificing all 4 survivors, I think that‚Äôd work, right? 
---
It definitely needs to change.
---
Or you could just leave the lobby.
---
Hex: Devour Dong 2: Conquering the Demi-Organ
---
This is what I thought was going to happen
---
I dunno, I still think bloody cool being base is just ever so slightly too strong
---
The first part aged absolutely horrible considering most people are getting matched up against new players currently as matchmaking is fucked
---
Windows didnt used to have blockers and survivors could infinately loop a killer at double windows. A true infinite that never ended.
---
It sounds like you dont enjoy this game. Tunneling, although frustrating, is a killer tactic. The better question is why are your teamates pulling you off the hook before the killer has found someone else?
---
Thats like saying they shouldnt get adept survivor because they used a key and found the hatch.  
---
Adept survivor is obscenely easy tbh.  Id be fine if they were both +1 pips though
---
how does he fake lag? Jump really fast when your not looking?
---
Mmh, I‚Äôm not too sure i experience FPS drops in the loading at he start just after the cut scene. But nothing after that.
---
He just stood at the pallet. Thought he was lagging to break it
---
That‚Äôs is relatively slow, but you should be able to play.
---
changing my tv settings really helped me consistently hit skill checks‚Äî its over for you, ruin
---
Perfectly balanced...
---
Sometimes its worth it lol
---
Just remove the body blocking from her
---
Apply directly to the forehead!
---
I‚Äôm so confused??? Pls explain
---
Why? It doesn‚Äôt really change what other add ons trappers would run, like my wraith idea does. It‚Äôs certainly not too strong as an add on. Is it any stronger than survivors having to mend vs legion? Or the tough choice between staying a 1 shot that makes a lot of noise and giving Plague corruption?
---
ORA ORA!
---
rather have low than high ranks.  Im a rank 9 killer rn, yet I keep getting reds in matchmaking.  Every single one that escaped was a giant douchebag in post game chat.  
---
As long as your not a prick idc what rank you are, keep doing what youre doing
---
It would be cool, but Im worried about that being added because of other games I have played where rain is absolutely deafening.
---
HALLOWED BLIGHT IS COMING BAAAAACK
---
I feel better every time a survivor says it was scary to play against my demogorgon
---
Yea I never said that. More diversity doesn‚Äôt = include every race, sexual orientation, disability known to man lol &amp; this is Reddit, not English class but nice try. All you know how to do is type out mindless insults and then when you run out of them you come at sentence structure which is pretty funny. Thanks for the laugh
---
I love Otz
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted...
---
yeah you‚Äôve got to give it to him. i would have been gone
---
Leather face for sure
---
I'm not 100% sure how fixing bugs prevents them from paying for dedicated servers. I'm all ears though.
---
I do agree that pallets are a bit too abundant on the new map.
---
Of course 1 trap isn‚Äôt enough, that‚Äôs my I said make bag add on base kit
---
Which is why when things start to snowball in my favour, I‚Äôll hook twice and just leave them on the ground to be picked up for another chase.
---
Gotta start somewhere. I play Meg as well but my reflexes are lightning fast.(I used to play goalie for my school's hockey team) Usually what gets me caught is the fact I'm awful at looping or winning chases in general
---
Wouldn't the perfect killer be playing nurse? Don't see how 4 perfect survivors can stop that.
---
I guess you‚Äôre right, but if I had to choose between bloody coil being base, or just making his bag add on base, I‚Äôd take the bag add on
---
So, with all the money they've made, what stopping them from hiring a 3rd party QA team to test console? Oh, it's the same thing that's preventing them from paying for dedicated servers. They've made more money than they ever thought possible with this game, but they refuse to reinvest any of it back into the game to make the experience what was advertised. Same problem F13 had.
---
I don‚Äôt want random poc added to the game for the sole purpose of more diversity which is why I think it‚Äôs dumb to add tony hawk when he has nothing to do with horror. I just want an increased effort in looking for more opportunities to add poc which is hard because the further you go back in time, the less poc are represented in media.
---
Btw imo, they added Jane in an attempt for more diversity. She is Latina and thick/fat/curvy(whatever you want to call her) and she‚Äôs a fictional character. So she would be what you called pointless and I agree but they had to make her up because how many fat Latina women do you see in horror movies or the media in general?

yup me too, i've only escaped a chase like..2/3 times maybe lmao? hoping to get better, i just started playing this game 2 days ago and i'm in love.
---
I want this
---
What do you mean a power that can slow down the game, remove pallets, allow cross-map teleportation, and all but nullifies borrowed time is OP? Things can only be OP if they were also OP in the past. Since Freddy used to ~~require a brain to use~~ be shit it‚Äôs okay that he gets all this as part of his kit now.
---
Umm I do too lol and it does work because of t bagging survivors and SWF groups
---
I think the devs kinda wanted to troll achievement hunters with this map making the achievement gen not only extremely unsafe, but also only accessible by 1 survivor, and also make it so you're capable of being body blocked in there.
---
Not entirely sure, I guess the game still relies on killer as host. I thought dedicated servers would stop that, unless they still don‚Äôt have them.
---
Nope. That was removed when the rework was implemented.
---
Behaviour doesnt play their own game. we all know matchmaking is an inside joke.
---
You must enjoy losing.

I Happy Feet, the penguins were able to befriend the sea lions so they can befriend the bears too! If not, we just melt the ice caps and get rid of the bears.
---
I've been playing just under two weeks and yeah, it's amazing. I only play survivor though. Maybe if they add Pennywise that'll change.
---
If I lose a lot how am I in high ranks?
---
Optional crossplay would be amazing. Or even default it to crossplay and have a toggle to turn it off. After playing the Modern Warfare beta which has crossplay and is way more advantageous for pc players I would like all these other games to have it too.
---
You evaded death
---
LF for BBQ because bps plus aura reading, Hag because devour can be fun and ruin is nice, Spirit because shes almost as good as nurse and significantly easier to learn.
---
Also dont listen to people that say "buy licensed because you can grind for shards". Its not worth it when you can use those shards to buy perks from shop or buy cosmetics from shop.
---
I have 35 on Demogorgon
---
Yeah they still don't have them: Their new goal is Fall 2019. But I was able to play on PTB for my first three glorious matches : I didn't even care that I didn't get a single kill and was teabagged each one, it was awesome. Thanks for your help: 0.29 must be too slow to host.
---
Did I say you lost alot?
---
Done. Interesting questions!
---
At the very least Spirit can be mind gamed with walking or scratch mark jukes and she at least has to be aware of pallets and vaults. If they add some small amount of delay before she can attack similar to wraith (lets be honest she‚Äôs basically wraith on steroids) I think she‚Äôd be fine.
---
Fair enough
---
No joke, I was considering what it would be like to have Tony Hawk as a survivor. All I came up with is that he could have a perk called "The 900" that would allow him to jump through a window during chase more times before the entity blocked it.
---
Damn I was joking holy shit
---
THIS is the stuff I'm really excited for. Chapters are great, but the Rift and Archives are gonna be sick. Hope it turns out as good as I'm hoping!
---
Aw man there's going to be some *SICK* GIF content on r/dbdgonewild in the next few days because of this!
---
If you say I enjoy losing it insinuates that I do it often. Also most games Blood Warden doesn‚Äôt come into effect because I kill everyone before end game, but for the few games I don‚Äôt it‚Äôs a good f you to the last guy t bagging at exit gate
---
Running into a wall as killer with a little lag, that's fine. When it's lag free until a chase starts or game starts to lean towards survivors? Nah lag switching all day.
---
I was joking, sorry if I wasn't clear enough
