you cannot buy him with shards

Exsqueeze you, Nurse with pocketwatch and bookmark is my favorite build. Nearly vanilla Nurse is best Nurse.
---
Hag, nurse and sometimes freddy
---
they have a list of bannable offenses on their site. thankfully it only has to do with hacking-related stuff. different ppl have different ways of enjoying the game, so you just have to shrug it off when u meet someone who does something unlikeable
---
Huh. I could've swore you could. I remember being confused about it
---
A few hours every week adds up to about 10-15 hrs ,if even that. that's the amount that people that play this game regularly can get in a few days
---
I see a beautiful spot for bubba right next to basement time 
---

---
Also that is really good
---
Yeah you can tell by the roadmap itself that they are not only working on dlc killers and survivors but also on balancing the game and fixing big problems like tunneling and shit like that
---
I call it the christmas tree. Its the best feeling ever
---
just a heads up they are going to start punishing DCS when dedicated servers come out and they should come out when the stranger things DLC comes out
---
Umm isn't this a 50 cent song and not Drake's.....
---
No, you can‚Äôt. Licensed killers you need to buy, thus, why the splinters exist.
---
I was playing as Micheal on a Cold Wind farm map, got to tier two and chased someone into the killer shack, where I popped tier 3, I downed her and heard a chest in the basement, the other 3 were in the basement. 2 minute game where all died in the basement. :P
---
I would do it myself but I suck at drawing but, can anyone draw Trapper with the Demogorgon as if it was his pet? I had in mind this since the trailer, Trapper just finds the Demogorgon and puts a leash on him and he's all like "I found this puppy, I will take care of him and name it puppers" or something like that
---
Being honest, I just 100% thought of Samination trapper in this idea
---
Also please more art of the Demogorgon in Dbd, this is just great

All the licensed ones have, up till now. Originally ALL the DLC killers had one but they stopped doing it for their OC ones. GF is licensed though, so it's odd.
---
You look like a bad hag.
---
i do think rituals that u recently got (recieved/switched to another) are brown while after you exit and go back to rituals they grey
---
You look boring.
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I‚Äôll definitely try to add him in. Thx bro
---
I may be wrong but I don‚Äôt think you can derank back to 19.
---
several maps have plenty of generators near the basement, that and there are 2 perks to aid you in carrying someone further.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nobody is saying basement camping is op, it's just not fun for anyone in the match.
---
What planet do you live on? You‚Äôre so wrong ü§£ get out of here man
---
Non stop circle jerking when a toxic survivor gets their comeuppance, the same happens to a killer playing with his food and we get comments like this.
---
Sucks to have that happen as killer. Poor dude almost had the kill
---
Okay, you must not be a very high rank lmao
---
Play Deathgarden, they don't have the time to buttdance even if you're bad cause you always about to clap their ass
---
why.
---
can we make a locker queen cover together?
---
Big whoop.
---
what in the hell. that is pretty damn creepy lol
---
Ah El Generico. May he rest in peace
---
The next Cool Killers Club meeting is going to be quite something.
---
Do you even know what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about? You must still be a rank 20. Please leave.
---
yup. they both sure are black....
---
Or make his blind girlfriend a survivor but she is ya know, blind.
---
its butchering, so no
---
I‚Äôd easily pick some of these perks over ‚Äúmeta‚Äù perks. They‚Äôre boring. It gets repetitive only bringing the strongest perks and nothing else.
---
If you‚Äôre playing to win then keep picking the meta perks, but if you‚Äôre playing a video game to have fun (shocker!) then pick whatever u want.
---
How does cleansing dulls help your game if there isn't noed? You spend time to prevent nothing.
---
ya only cells im afraid
---
Imagine still calling DS crutch in 2019
---
Ah feck
---
That you are racist?
---
They hated JARAXXUS_EREDAR_LORD because he told them the truth

Not even death is an escape.
---
Oh for sure, but how often is it just chance that you're the first one to be found a 2nd time unless they chase ya down from the hook?
---
Haven't played Killer in like 3 months, but I played a lot of Nurse and Trapper. Full builds, but Rank 20 because of how long I haven't played and how long it takes to pip.
---
Yeah, because it's totally like I forgot how to play Killer in 3 months and need to be versing the poor baby dweets.
---
yeah tis is big brain time.
---
How else do you play this game for hours without getting frustrated and go play something else?
---
omg skodkdpslsl
---
I'm saving iridescents to buy a new killer because I'm getting tired of the actual ones a bit, tho I'm a main survivor which I find it more amusing
---
The License killers have them, Black Splinter, Bone Splinter, Smoking Splinter and Glass Splinter. The rest jumpy can buy with shards.
---
BBQ in shrine.
---
Blood hunt next month.
---
Oh yeah. Its all coming together
---
Sure! Maybe behind freddy‚Äôs finger knives or somethin. Thx for the suggestion!
---
What would they name the splinter anyways?
---
This is every killer tbh
---
just spam the x button to start the game as soon as possible the fan will calm down. it is normal because for some unknown reason the startup on dbd has no fps cap and since it is just smoke and shit you can see the issue
---
Personally I find survivor less fun. Especially solo, but on the other hand playing killer makes me really anxious
---
You‚Äôre right. Shame on people for shouting out their favorite streamer on a cool technique they do.
---
Maybe I'm thinking about him being the first liscenced killer to have cosmetics
---
Background. Just played a wraith game and pretty easily took care of a SWF. Basically hook one and let bbq tell me where they were rinse and repeat. Post game I get this. Note I hate doing the gg ezy and get good stuff but I was honestly mad at that random fuck you
---
Oh my fuckin god, she fuckin dead.
---
Not necessarily. Since it's better to not have connections to the real one.
---
Wraith for me, cant stand him. Literally cant eacape from him cause he walks so Damn fast, no matter how many loops. He still catches you.
---
I'm not going to follow the same tired script of every NOED debate on this sub. Nobody will change their mind and it'll just be a big waste of time.
---
"Mmm, bait! Don't mind if I do..." - r/deadbydaylight
---
A good leatherface player scares me (mk)
---
Oh my god seriously? I just had the same exact problem in the boiler room area when they were up against the wall. That map is problematic
---
Yeah. I hate playing killer cause it's not really my thing. Plus I often get destroyed by good survivors. I pay no attention to the 4K, and i mainly feel satisfied hooking all survivors one time  as my goal. I also learn a lot by just practicing on good survivors even if they give me a hard time. I kinda hate how some survivors are too easy. So if someone gives me a good chase, I'll be glad if I can catch them. 
---
I don't take the killer side too seriously, since I'm mainly a survivor farming BP'S. If I play to anxious , I get destroyed. Each time a survivor taunts you. It's a mind game. Once they get u irritated you'll start making more mistakes being anxious to win. 
---
That's usually where the game goes downhill for me. As their taunts have tested my patience, and I'm now making a ton of mistakes while getting a bit upset. 
---
I haven't really had much of those games where playing killer makes me angry. As I'm more aware that the survivors are taunting me, to play with my feelings. I know better, and just enjoy myself, not letting it get to me. Overall I'm just more composed to think clearly, and maybe, maybe get lucky or outplay them.
---
I understand from most games that playing with anger only facilitates more mistakes. Stay composed, and have fun. You'll learn from those games, and with experience you'll naturally get good at the game.
---
I wanna see a futuristic killer something that uses super advanced tech to hunt survivors or a Medieval Knight
---
yea that's the thing, I always play survivor with a friend, if he's not online, I play killer but I'm not as good as survivor and whe I reach rank 9 or plus I get fistfucked by those bloody Clauds
---
They said something about them coming out on the nurse rework in September but no guarantees cause I heard about it on a stream
---
Literally just played one, got tunneled by pig, and immediately got off
---
I have only known of people to be banned for doing the bloodweb exploit and one was my best friend. I have also had people tell me they did it and were never banned not to mention countless people who claim to DC but suffer no ban.
---
Perks that are designed to deal with an in-game issue rarely work. The way they increased the amount of bp received from cleaning a dull totem does help, but Inner Strength is only gonna temporarily help.
---
Eventually most people will stop running it every game and Noed will be just fine then
---
Yeah true.  Back when gen rushing existed, they actually we're OP
---
The background matches his shirt?
---
Actually i played before it was toxic and trash (not a flex just stating thats how I know)
---
Wish I could tell ya but I honestly have no clue
---
well if you're stacking gen slows you should swap BBQ for PGTW
---
Scuba Diver with a harpoon gun
---
I think the instadown would still be fine if it was from a long enough range. Would feel less cheap than waiting until breathing down your neck before aim + release
---
Damn, that must have sucked for that ghostface lol
---
Sombra is best girl
---
Just boof the whole blunt
---
You don't even need to play the game to understand that a second that passes while doing one thing is a second that isn't used on something else.
---
They‚Äôre a bunch of trolls and griefers. They both played as David, most notably with his No Mither perk. What they would do is bring the killer towards the other survivor and me, then once we were injured they would heal us until there was a skill check and THEN deliberately fail it so the killer would find us. They would run, then once we were dying they would go to heal us and then fail the check again until the killer game. They repeated this process OVER and OVER. They would also rescue us off the hook only to do those steps. They completely ruined the game and the killer obviously had no idea what was going on. They just kept running around, looping him until he lost interest and would go after whoever the other just ‚Äúfailed‚Äù the skill check on. It probably won‚Äôt be likely that others will but if you see this post and are in a lobby with these two, I STRONGLY suggest that you leave.
---
You should be ashamed
---
I see no details
---
Happy birthday
---
Every ace I‚Äôve played against was toxic af, every ace I‚Äôve played with was toxic. Switch him with Adam Francis and this list is accurate
---
When I read "SHY GUY", I thought you were talking about the little guy in Mario, I'm sure there is something creepy behind that mask
---
Rule 3, man. You can't call people out by name. Feel free to black out their names though and post your story.
---
You can run, you can't hide, but your not having the time of your life. See that killer, watch that scene, digging the Locker Queen.
---
Killing night and the lights are low. Looking out for the generators to goo. Where they play that right match, getting in the zoone.. You come in to look for a David King. Any killer could be that fright. Everyone is young and probably gonna diee! With a big ol' trap and some clown crap. Your in the mood for a hooking. Now time to see who's looking.
---
YOU ARE THE LOCKER QUEEN, YOUNG AND SWEATY ONLY RANK SEVENTEEEEEN, OH YEAH! LOCKER QUEEN FEEL THE HIT FROM THE TRAPPERS MACHETE. YOU CAN RUN YOU CAN'T HIDE, GOING TO DIE BEFORE YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE! SEE THAT KILLER, WATCH THAT SCENE, DIGGING THE LOCKER QUEEN!
---
Your a obsession, time for the entity's ascension. Leave them trapped and you'll be gone. Looking out for another, saving will do. Your in the mood for a hooking. Now time to see who's looking.
---
I SPENT 30 MINUTES WRITING THIS WOOOH!
---
I think certain maps are perfect the way they are right now. But mostly the farm maps need work. 
---
But I never said spawns werent bad. But even if they are, if all 5 totems get destroyed early game while you run Corrupt, I don‚Äôt think you can really complain.
---
I have not played as him yet, but I play against him all the time and the line chainsaw hits are so rare‚Äù seems like a completely different game to me. 
---
EVERYTIME I play against a Bubba and he revs his chainsaw, I ALWAYS get hit. Doesn‚Äôt matter if I am looping him around things or trying to get him to hit something, I always go down.
---
Any tips on how to avoid it since it‚Äôs supposed to be rare?
---
inb4 ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù
---
too fast lol
---
*cries in Demogorgan*
---
What kind of next level of dumbassery logic is this? There is a massive difference between game being hard to get into because of it's difficulty and because of how bad and toxic it's community is.
---
Still better than having a staring Contest for 5 hours
---
the dc one I am not surprised since the current system they can not even track really who dc or if the game crashed that is why they need to dc half of there games to be punished but once dedicated servers come they will know fully who did it and why. as for cheating and exploits, I seen ppl banned for doing things like taking game hostage lag switch and etc. a lot of ppl would simply love to brag they never been caught but who knows if all that is trie and if it is the luck will run out sooner or later. guess it just depends on who you ask and etc on the experiences they see
---
It's a thing lesbians do
---
Sure it would be fine but it would also be useless on huntresses worst maps this Change could make huntress better in situations she really needs it
---
I‚Äôm not in the mood for this
---
I honestly think second wind is worthless, it has to many conditions, and gives you the broken status. If you get tunneled after you get off hook it's just never will give you a heal. If you weren't broken, or if you didn't need to heal first, it might be useful? But I honestly just think it's gonna be mediocre.
---
Babysitter on the other hand sounds like it will worth with BT instead of replace it. It'll probably be the best survivor perk on this dlc imo.
---
Mr Tickle was Freddy the whole time?!
---
What is p3
---
Play against my Bubba apparently, though I deleted today because I'm sick of being trolled by top 5 ranks SWF down to my lowly rank 16.
---
Other Bubbas know how to play better than me. I'd suggest hugging cover, if they bump into it it forces a tantrum and should give you time to escape.
---
They shy guy could be another mobility killer, like hillbilly, but have more maneuverability, and Can do multiple attack‚Äôs during its short duration period.
---
Still no details
---
Okay big brain lol
---
They just don't spawn splinters for killers you own.
---
His Mori could be making you eat a Whopper
---
What does the tantrum do? Is that when he starts squealing like a pig?
---
So that nobody can illegally steal his meme
---
*When they t-bag you at the gate, but you just popped Blood Warden and you saved stalk at 99%.*
---
It‚Äôs just cringe and will bring a ton of bad scummy players into the community and it will DEFINITELY turn into more ‚Äútoxic‚Äù ochido fanboys
---
Can't you change the psn username once without having to pay?
---
Platform: PC
---
Type: Ingame
---
Issue: I finished the Mori quest for Wraith: "kill one survivor by hand using Wraith". I finally completed this after a LOT of farming but the ritual don't count as completed.
---
Steps to reproduce: It would take a very long time and a lot of farming to reproduce (don't have anymore mori offerings) so I just rerolled the ritual.
---
Ah yes, the slightly charred taste of disappointment.
---
Yeah, basically if you bump into something other than a survivor during a chainsaw run he makes the squealing sound and swings his saw all over. Killer loses control for a minute but the saw is still dangerous.
---
bruh
---
Like a 2 hit kill, also when not in his power he cannot attack, and he slows down considerably
---
Me: I will use a meme build today and have fun (brings sabo build and takes DS off)
---
Legion: hee hee ho ho tunnel off hook time fun and fair hee hee
---
The majority of the Ash players are asshats and they were so toxic to me for some reason. Especially when MoM was initially broken af. üòÇ BM every pallet, flashlight clicking and dick in the chat even when I go out of my way to give them the hatch.
---
It's called a joke, you know, something fake that you're supposed to laugh at... something that is not meant to be directed towards anyone.
---
oh, for sure. But those guys kinda weed themselves out by focusing on really good runners. hahah, tunnel those guys at your own peril.
---
They do.
---
Thats false, u hot a pig ome.back then and i had the pig already
---
maybe I looked at the wrong thing but this killer won't attack unless you look at him. won't that make it hard? unless you take out that part in his lore
---
Oh shit, I didn't know Miguel was a Johnny Test fan.
---
^(I didn't even know those existed.)
---
Well done! I myself recently started playing as the huntress, hit all my throws with iridescent head on a match, didn't miss a single one. Boy did those survivors hold m1 fast kek.
---
If they make it lit before maybe people would actually do it but it‚Äôs almost impossible to do bones by themselves
---
Sometimes but not for every game
---
God I love otz
---
2 things.   
---
Iron Maiden hard counters Inner Strength since they have to get in and out of a locker.   
---
and  
---
If survs spend injured time looking for totems, it still slows down the game since they aren't on gens.
---
a knight would be cool tool.
---
Ahoy! Very nice.
---
I dunno, I got the email and responded. The RSVP was marked urgent.
---
Well, with the new perk, totems will be gone in no-time
---
Oh
---
Sure. I'd be a Nishiki main all day.
---
Offering: PTSD
---
Past survival attempts have "enlightened" you to the selfish and cruel nature of those you considered allies. They're probably infected too, you can't let it spread again.
---
Begin the next match as the Killer equipped with a fully-automatic assault rifle and fire-axe. All generators are gone and the match only ends when you die of old age or the police arrive.
---
*"I knew this day was comin'. They wouldn't listen."*
---
Three is my limit too. Its fun for a bit, but I just get tired of the inevitability of failure. Youre not supposed to kill everyone every game, but it feels like you do when youre playing
---
Having 4 people with the perk is going to be a pain in the ass
---
r/cringetopia
---
TE AGARRO PELA CABE√áA E TE JOOJ
---
What?
---
My name says everything wrong about this post
---
You have to buy the full chapter in order to get them to disappear. They also used to be bugged and would appear even when you owned the chapter before 2.0.0.
---
Far from the worst. Id argue shes mid tier tbh
---
I assume they mean get more points than the killer?
---
Then she looks down and gg
---
You shoudbtl be on the internet if you cant take jokes.
---
That looks more like a survivor.
---
If the killer plays very poorly then that isn't entirely uncommon
---
Survivor mains crying over this one
---
He escaped so there must be some method to his madness
---
I can totally imagine say, the Trapper, running into the Doctor in the fog, and trying to fight him, and the Entity having to break it up. I would pay to that.
---
The Shy Guy: The Shy Guy is a Rampage killer. Shy guy can use his power Rampage to traverse across the map with easy maneuverability.Shy guy is a 2 hit kill on all survivors,but only when using rampage. Rampage has a short cool-down of three second before he can continue his 10 second rampage. Once rampage has been used Shy Guy will go into an emotional state where he‚Äôll start crying, and babbling incoherently, During this time you can use his power or stalk survivors. You do not need to look at survivors to activate power,but his duration lasts longer if the survivor is looking at him.
---
You literally asked if you should use your shards on the spirit or the pig. So I‚Äôm pointing out you need to buy the pig with money
---
Why killer can't have overpowered perk? Like imagine a perk that makes you not play against SWF, or something that make survivors not loop you, that would be really cool
---
Someone prematurely jumping in hatch and escaping despite the team as a whole doing kinda sub par (keys) is much more annoying than instaheals, and more like an ebony mori for the surv
---
Source?
---
For a second I thought the first panel was a reaction to Monto's outro music.
---
^(Probably should have been.)
---
If we actually used 100% of our brain, we would bring a White Ward with a green add-on-less key instead.
---
I imagined the same thing, except the survivors had sex in the locker instead
---
You‚Äôre not even having a discussion, you‚Äôre just sounding like a fool saying it wastes time to cleanse totems. Keep saying it and crying about NOED.
---
Sensing a few assumptions were made in the making of this comment.
---
They definitely calmed down after the MoM nerf.
---
did you win?
---
Ranged instadowns are in no way shape or form balanced. 
---
They're similar to Nurse blinks, ur locked at 1 hatchet for a reason and add ons should not help with that. Just like how you should not be able to get extra blinks.
---
You know some toxic rank 1 people are gonna smurf to scare all the new people away
---
r/madlads
---
We are brothers in arms!
---
Yea, happens to me sometimes, like this one billy who wouldn‚Äôt m1 me so I ran around a couple cans and boxes for almost a minute straight. Probably the most toxic I‚Äôve ever felt.
---
I love you for saying this, finally i see someone else talking about this. I feel like Im not supposef to talk on mamy posts cuz its all killer mains complaining about survivors. When i say a single thing i get downvoted :(
---
I really wish I had Jeff because I‚Äôd play the shit out of him (he‚Äôs my favourite survivor) but i play meg for the perks even though I‚Äôm not toxic
---
Or escape from a trap
---
Imagine you teabag the president then get fucking sniped the next day
---
Just dodge the hatchets lol. If you cannot dodge a hatchet, then that‚Äôs your fault. 
---
Nurse is a different story because she ignores most game mechanics. She probably won‚Äôt be able to have five blinks or omega blink after her changes.
---
^
---
Ah, okay! Thank you!
---
As "im the big guy here" as David looks he's the least toxic in my opinion, never seen a David be an asshole in the end of the game, same goes for bill
---
I was the last survivor today and the Trapper made a fucking waypoint with his traps for me to the hatch but i was too dumb and new to get it. Then after hitting 3 beartraps he downs me and carries me to the exit, which i escape and run back into the level. Finally he downs me again, and lets me escape after bringing me back to the exit.
---
I wish I could give players like that actual fricking money and will be uploading the vid later probs.
---
Billy has built in Pressure. Maybe Haunted grounds can help survivors get of gens when exposed?
---
Nom nom. Netflix and chilli.
---
Tbh I can never tell when I‚Äôm tunneling
---
Yeah, it actually seem pretty cruel to me. I mean, when it's a religious reason I will respect your beliefs ... but I would never do that to my own kid. Circumcision is not really common in Canada nowadays.
---
I personally think Inner Strength can become part of the meta. 
---
Cleanse a totem at the start of the match and then when you get saved off a hook you can get an 8 second heal from a locker. That immediately frees up the teammate to continue working on a gen, not to mention it takes half the time of a teammate heal so you can continue with gens sooner too. 
---
Or if you manage to escape a chase there‚Äôs no need to waste 32 seconds self-caring or running around the map to find a teammate to heal you. 
---
The perk helps to get Noed out of the game whilst also being time productive and a hard counter to Nurses Calling too.
---
I am getting downvotes for that? Seriously? Yes, i never seen or heard of this guy streaming.
---
What was he supposed to do? Let him escape and loose rank?
---
You Are The Most Luckiest Person
---
Ain't racist if it's the truth. Because she really is so black it's hard to see her
---
Generally matches my experiences, except I‚Äôve seen maybe 2 toxic Fengs in my life, and almost every David I see is so toxic you‚Äôd think he was trying to be the next AngryPug.
---
BBQ doesn‚Äôt work if they are in lockers and isn‚Äôt OP but NOED is a crutch perk
---
Low key sounds like legion LOL
---
"insta hit if thrown from at least 24m" would be interesting i agree
---
I play survivor, sorry that my correct assessment triggered you though.
---
Do not continue this thread it will be removed for unrelated content l
---
Odd bulb is useless now
---
I know this but as I said I use it well before where I have already taken my finger off the key and I still get hit. I also get stuck gittering in place on the floor after it happens. I know I cut it kinda close using dh but I know when I use it too early or too late.
---
It's not really about whether or not it's good. It's just *a* strategy. I really don't get why people want all this intervention to stop killers from doing what they're supposed to do: kill. You may not like the method by which they do it, but that's wholly irrelevant. 
---
Sure, being the one chased after just getting off the hook sucks, but get over it. You'll either learn to be better in chases and survive longer, or you'll throw a temper tantrum until mommy and daddy give you your way.
---
I said that time taken on things is not spent on other things. You responded with "you must be low rank lol". The conversation ended with you. Please read what you comment.
---
Lol imagine someone actually thinking iri hatchets are balanced,...unreal. I recognize this guy from the dbd forums, probably the most killer biased poster I‚Äôve ever seen. Just nonsense.
---
Well you said the name comes from her making it when she was little so it didn't sound like it would've been changed. And you're quite right, I should never have presumed which platform sir plays on. I beg of you to forgive my impertinence.
---
Yup love looping the killer for 5gens and getting a tasty de pip
---
Either let him escape, or pick him up straight away. Not let him crawl halfway into the gate before picking him up.
---
I got 31,800 bp as survivor which is literally nuts because it‚Äôs straight up impossible to get survival points
---
*\*laughs in looping the killer for 4 gens\**
---
And here, I present to everyone: *probably* a tunneller and camper.
---
I don't really use noed that often, I rather use perks that makes me not enter the endgame
---
I didn‚Äôt imply it wasn‚Äôt a circle jerk. I dont even know where the hell you‚Äôre getting that from.  All im saying is his chat is a massive circle jerk as well. That is it.
---
Face camping is the one tactic that is truly toxic
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs other people
---
I finally started watching it cause of the dlc and I'm loving it
---
You shouldn't hear if prayer beads are on because it says "Removes the phasing sound" last time I checked
---
what a dumbbutt
---
Ah, A Fellow Nea! I've Just Accepted Rank 12
---
He was probably playing around DS, I think there is nothing else that you can do about it, than waiting
---
I used to get really really salty in this game until I started playing Quickplay in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate regularly.
---
I now play Dead by Daylight to take a break from my salt and frustration. It‚Äôs quite relaxing now.
---
Ok so spending points for non conventional perks and listening to others opinions makes you a sheep. 
---
lel
---
Between hitbox sizes and latency, ranged instadowns are not balanced in any context.
---
What is jooj I know the other part is I grab you by the head
---
Just do the totems, noed won't spawn then
---
a wise man once said, "take my meme take my soul" and this unit clearly wants to keep his soul
---
if they don't M1 that's their own fault
---
I agree, make it more of a skill shot and it will feel more fair.
---
As a Hag main, it's okay. It's more fun to play Hag rather than play against and I'm okay with that.
---
Thank you for letting me know!
---
Since I Know This Is Fortnite From The Threads, Delet This Fortnerd &gt;:(
---
You can get kills before the gens are done with NOED. It's not am uncommon scenario to have 2 dead and 2 alive when the last Gen is powered. The killer didn't do too bad in that game. I never get hit with NOED when I play solo survivor, but some people don't want to change how they play.
---
What is ANoES 3?
---
*Found the toxic **killer** that reminds us of the whole circus lol*
---
Do you think my version is as unnecessary as yours is?
---
no they won't take your report seriously because they broke 0 rules. You are a reason they don't take real reports seriously since you waste their time.
---
also its better to use it to get to pallets or windows slightly quicker to garuntee you get to the pallet/window
---
I mean it could have eyes in the back of its mouth and it's just obscured so it keeps the illusion it's a eyeless beast? But seriously it's a game it doesn't matter alot.
---
The devs have said that they stay in their own realms (aka their maps, for the killers that have maps), but I like to imagine that stuff [like this](https://youtu.be/H6OlwQFvZQc) happens between trials.
---
The Bee
---
I AM SPEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDD
---
oink
---
That's a fucking yoink lata bitch moment
---
Can‚Äôt on console
---
That‚Äôs not the add-on‚Äôs fault.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs true lmao. It‚Äôs a game about time management. If you‚Äôre not shit at the game and you‚Äôre coordinating with your teammates, you can EASILY finish all gens AND cleanse all the totems. It‚Äôs not that complicated. Get better I guess.
---
The survivor is Nicki Minaq and her per is called Big Booty. It activates when a killer stares at it after 5 seconds and stuns them for 5 seconds.
---
Look at all of those reasons. The only one that is justified is #3. The rest just reeks laziness or sociopathic behaviour. Even #3 is already bordering on eye for an eye disturbing level. 
---
But basically they are just either lazy to make the effort to earn their kill or they made up nebulous reason to tunnel. 
---
A lot posts have been made about survivors entitlement. But these pretty much spells out killers entitlement. They get angry when someone touch their totem, a device clearly meant to be destroyed. They panic that they are bad at chases and punish one defenceless player. It's pretty much impossible to disappear when you're bleeding post unhook and the killer return to the hook.
---
Pretty pathetic tbh.
---
The hookers üòé
---
it matter to me?! Really how can I chase a thick Jane when I don‚Äôt have eyes?
---
Honestly, i hate all second chance/turn the game around perks. If it was up to me the game would be way less perk reliant
---
I thought you had to be injured first?
---
I know this also, but it also gives you invincibility frames. Sometimes you need it.
---
I think he was mid tier in mkx
---
Last night i hit the ping cap at 1100 ms. Everyone was frozen but me and i tried working on a gen and got stuck on it until the killer lagged out
---
You reported and unreportable thing, so no I imagine they won‚Äôt take it seriously.
---
Told you, and stick it through the second season it's a little worse, the characters make up for it, and season 3 is great!
---
lolnpewdie pienisnsosoosososo funy
---
And you keep the spirit up? You amaze me
---
So I was playing with a couple friends last night (we are currently green to yellow rank because we haven‚Äôt been playing as consistently, but we‚Äôve all been rank 1 before) and we are just trashing this Billy. Like...it‚Äôs bad. The only good thing I can say is that we made it quick, no teabagging or extending the game. I think he hit my friend once and that‚Äôs it. So my friends and I are all congratulating each other and laughing about how bad this guy is, and then I get to the summary. 
---
It was a rank 20, 1 perk Billy. I felt terrible. Earlier in the night we‚Äôd been facing truly competent killers around our rank so it honestly didn‚Äôt occur to me we‚Äôd face a rank 20 when the lowest rank we had was 15. 
---
Sorry little Billy, you deserved better.
---
95% of survivors taunt the killer every chance they get out of spite ROFL discredited
---
That explains it
---
Easy just ask the entity for googly eyes
---
I hate this, as well as i hate the other ends of it.
---
Saw people focus only on girls, to show them they shouldnt play videogames
---
Saw girls taking advantage of it... but on another level. To the point where she used people to get free stuff (this one i saw on LoL)
---
Saw people "defending" a girl that didnt know how to play, from someone that was really trying to help her get the hang of the game (this was on TF2 (i miss that game a little))
---
Same as before, but the girl tought she was the best player and used her "protectors" to prove her point (also TF2)
---
I've even tried myself to see what is to be a girl playing a game, and man, this experience made me feel so bad
---
I just hope this ends and someday people are treated as normal people inside some games
---
That they have more melanin in their skin than some other people? Idk..
---
Maybe you should.
---
What about any killer besides the ones you listed? They just go fuck themselves?
---
One of the only posts that has made me laugh
---
Love the digital look to boop. Cute picture
---
I Can Agree With All Of This, But If You Don't Like Toxic Players Who Run Around The Killer, You Won't Like Me, See Ya On The PS4 Bud!
---
Its not trolling
---
I enjoy playing as leatherface and, well, BBQ &amp; Chili is amazing.
---
LOL, wrong term but literally dude was blocking my body. The offense is trolling. Mad grit? Shouldnt cost me a perk to deal with toxicity.  With or without it. Its unrealistic to me as a killer. Still an act of a coward.
---
Same i see no point in keeping them if im just gonna prestige eventually.
---
I can‚Äôt remember where exactly but I saw on the forums that a Dev said it won‚Äôt proc those perks, such as PGTW/Overcharge/Surveillance, as it‚Äôs an ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù which is caused and the Killer isn‚Äôt physically kicking the gen.
---
Plague spirit and doctor are all annoying asf
---
Yes. Nurse's Calling is very good even without Sloppy, and Stridor can be a good alternative for Spirit and Nurse herself
---
Don‚Äôt like 84% of vegans go back to eating meat? And studies have shown them to be healthier? Like the vegan chick who tried to climb a mountain to prove vegans we‚Äôre just as strong and healthy, but she died because she wasn‚Äôt strong or healthy.
---
He is wise beyond his years
---
The bar moves so slowly that i think it would be hard for the killer to notice when there you know... Busy looking for or chasing survivors
---
Met some friends that just faked being males out of fear and to play a game normally
---
Probably you dont see them as much as they're most likely hiding
---
Talon would *totally* take advantage of Ojomo's shitty situation to use his powers
---
Ik I was just hoping he was going to cuz it felt like bullying but thinking back he could‚Äôve ended it way earlier.
---
Is stridor good enough to replace whispers?
---
You know there is some killers that prevent toxicity.
---
Legion will hit survivors, vault pallets, fast vault windows, and if you have add ons you can hit that tbager again to give them a effect like blindness or something. He‚Äôs honestly amazing if you don‚Äôt want to get looped or tbaged.
---
Nurse..  well do I really have to explain? Nurse is S teir for a reason
---
Clown will hinder them preventing a chase.
---
With spirit you can stand still and they think you went into phase and walk towards you to try t confuse you but in reality you never phased and they walk to you.
---
These killers counter toxic people
---
Lol it's all survivors responding rn but sooner or later I'll get a killer.
---
I've got the achievement for this but I don't remember doing it lol.
---
I am Vigo's jar of salty lips
---
with their lungs
---
Toxic jackass gets memed.
---
I killer main Mike. I just don‚Äôt agree with you, because you‚Äôre wrong.
---
It also means that we shouldn‚Äôt nerf the add-on. We should fix the hitboxes and latency the best we can before deciding whether to nerf something or not. 
---
Nurse breaks just about every game mechanic though. Of course stealth being stronger wouldn‚Äôt make Omegablink balanced. She just use it at loops. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs supposed to be getting looked at next.
---
Dumb people can really mess it up for everyone against myers. Was just playing a match, nonstop LVL 3 Myers...
---
Isnt hag a wendigo? A person that became a canibal monster
---
Killer I can do 2. Survivor I can keep going on and on.
---
How do the killers even see? Now that you guys mention it, most should be blind. The only one we are sure that can see is doc. Because...you know...real shit?
---
100% 
---
It‚Äôs the outfit he‚Äôs wearing in his Babysitter perk.
---
Behavior's thinking of the short term gains (I.E. this is a cash grab) instead of long term. Probably because they're secretly working on DbD 2 or their next microtransaction scheme is my guess.
---
Well, hag akready fills the role for wendigo, but people want one anyway, so why not a banshee as well?
---
Well the definitely have a reason if it‚Äôs a teir 1 mike on the other side of the wall.
---
Then the game would end up like Friday the 13th
---
Bet.
---
Legit, bubba was adapted better in MKX imo.
---
that‚Äôs his favorite
---
Rules are there are no rules.
---
A Nightmare on Elm Street 3.
---
Ash isn't going to be in the game, now its the joker.
---
TeamFortress or Titanfall?
---
Even with religion I can't really respect it. Circumcision should always be the choice of the person it's attached to, not the parents or anyone else.
---
*backwater swamp boat gen intensifies*
---
Because this is literally just how you counter Decisive Strike
---
"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Socialism necessarily requires the abolition of private ownership of capital. Canada is by all means capitalist.
---
To clear up this wasn‚Äôt something the devs said but it was a YouTubed named HybridPanda going over the new blood web system and how fast you can get all the perks on killer side
---
Body blocking isn‚Äôt bannable for hooks. They mean body blocking people in corners or to sandbag
---
Now listen here, *smartasses get killed, we always see to that*
---
Why would the entity be scared of its own dog?
---
Why are you such a dick? To what end?
---
toolboxes do the most damage on that first gen so fraklins really isnt doing much other than maybe poofing nearly empty boxes which is trolly but largely insignificant
---
if you want to really stop genrush bring a red mori so you can killrush
---
What would they be afraid of? Lmao have you seen them interact with the community? A lot of times they act exactly the same as the community acts.
---
Exactly 0 rules. U can play as killer or surv you want. If u get triggered by butt dance / flashlight click or camping / tunneling than u have to take a break.
---
A great way to celebrate a happy Dear Leader Day!
---
Some people are autistic and literally have no capacity to understand humor, especially sarcasm.
---
I think the hag would be a way more fun killer if they had less traps, and forced the killer to strategize more instead of surrounding hooks with 20 traps and putting them all over the map
---
Power wise sure. But he acted way more malicious in MKX than he actually is unlike in DBD where he‚Äôs normal simple Bubba.
---
SmOkE bUd eVeRyDaY
---
so the only possible reason for an add-on rework is because they think that they're broken, huh?
---
Yeah, no. No add-ons or perks she can 4k consistently if you play her well, that's why any good Nurse players will tell people who want to learn Nurse not to use add-ons, because she doesn't need them. I've spoken to some people who claim that they feel bad playing Nurse so they only play it with single blink or to climb ranks quicker.
---
Nurse is literally a relic of the past for this game. As they do with just about all new DLC, they try to resolve ongoing issues with new perks and a new killer. Back in the day Nurse was created to deal with the issue of infinites that were on I believe literally every map where the only other killer that you'd see played was Trapper and usually people sabotaged his traps anyways. She was literally made to be able to blink through the walls and windows of an infinite to end it, something no other killers could do. Since then, vaulting got many changes, blood lust was added, windows got given limits, different perks were created, etc. Nurse was a lot less problematic back in the day because she was new and didn't have people very skilled with her and she was the only counter to all the super broken survivor stuff. Now that most of the issues that Nurse was made to resolve have been actually fixed, she does not deserve to remain so blatantly broken compared to any other killers.
---
They're afraid of pissing off the community. Particularly the survivor side.
---
Ayyy 9/9 brothers
---
Is this pc, console, or both?
---
I imagine anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen Kevin is very confused right now
---
A patch wont fix that, so you not know how patches work??? Its the game loading up, so it will cause that, theres nothing wrong with your PlayStation or the game.
---
Well the meme was pretty incorrect. It said he calls out stream snipers a lot more than he does
---
However... the fact that it was *clearly* just poking fun, had the title "i like tru3 btw", and yet he still responded like this... iffy
---
Which is never what I argued to begin with. Ignoring that you are assuming the survivors are in a SWF, which makes it much easier and less time consuming, the point is that it still takes time. If you're a higher ranking player, like your  attitude implies, you would know perfectly well that every second not spent on a Gen is a second more for the Killer to get a victory. You would also know that not everyone runs NOED, meaning that cleansing totems for the purposes of getting rid of NOED is outright a gamble. You would *also* know that Haunted Grounds is a thing, meaning that the team could be hurting itself even more on a gamble.
---
But of course, you didn't say any of that. Instead, you said "you must be low rank lol". When I tried to return us to the point at hand, that time off gens is still time off gens no matter what and that its basic logic, you completely ignored it. You're still ignoring it, even.
---
All you've done is be a dick and say "git gud" in a condescending manner. I can't see where you expected this conversation to go. What was your end game? Did you have one? Or were you just trying to have a laugh?
---
Sucks but informative. Thanks. I still maintain that it will pair well with Pop Goes the Weasel. Kick the gen, chase the guy, down him, Surge kicks in at the next gen he was near.
---
That ending actually made my jaw drop! Great clip.
---
I was carrying a survior to basement and they must've knew I'd be taking the survior there cause  another survior was crouching using his flashlight as I was trying to hook. Its narrow and I cant walk through survivors. I just thought it was cheap. Not trolling just was salty post match. 
---
Well I dont want anyone to be banned so I deleted the post for the miscommunication on my end.
---
I love getting these types of hits
---
I don‚Äôt know. It seems like they‚Äôve been pandering a lot to the killer side, based purely on what they‚Äôve been doing with survivor perks. I think the devs are just either very out of touch with the community and ignorant or they‚Äôre just letting it all slide because punishing the community for being dicks would be hypocritical because they‚Äôre also dicks lol
---
Y‚Äôall saying there‚Äôs only one hatch but there‚Äôs a add on where you can get a total of 3 and 99% of the time they‚Äôre runnin it
---
Nah mate it was fun seasons 1-6
---
Do you feel the same way about piercing a baby's ears? I'm genuinely curious because there is an argument to be had about that too.
---
Maybe its because ruin and stuff are more common higher up and they didnt know yet and were being cautious? Dont know but I dropped it just because it stopped being effective. I still use it once in a while but my 4th perk slot is open pretty much and im always switching up the perk in it.
---
Yee yee my dude üëå
---
I mean, it‚Äôs pretty funny to see you get so worked up with this when it literally doesn‚Äôt matter lmao you‚Äôll keep playing how you play and I‚Äôll keep playing how I play but you keep popping off and giving me good memes because you‚Äôre taking it so seriously ü§°
---
I love your art style! And welcome to Reddit of course. ^^
---
 Every flashlighter ive faced is a huge 4head. If you let them, they loop you. Lead them to a corner without any loops then turn around and smack them. They run away to self care under a pallet for half a minute and come back to do it again. 
---
 Sucks to have 4 that know what theyre doing though.
---
&gt;that's why any good Nurse players will tell people
---
&gt;I've spoken to some people
---
I'm going to trust the devs.
---
It's a broken achievement, I got it by only having 2 in the basement at a time
---
Just hear me out! Taking time to really think about what you're eating is connected to whether or not you're living a happy life. That's why I think it's really important. So there are animals that're carnivores, right? You know, like lions, cats, and vultures. You won't find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant. Why is that? Because it's too smelly to eat! It's disgusting! Listen up, guys! Cats are too disgusting to eat. Are we on the same page so far? On the other hand, have you heard of a fish called "sweetfish"? Sweetfish don't eat bugs. They only eat algae. They're vegetarian. Ususally, fish guts are too bitter to eat, but Sweetfish guts taste delicious. It's beacuse they're not carnivores. So with that logic in mind, all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals! Cows, pigs, and chickens! The better their feed, the better they taste! Which leads us to this conclusion... Humans would taste bad because they eat meat! How do you like the opinion I came up with?
---
According to Mista vegans would taste good
---
Quiet it‚Äôs  having a snack
---
Dont hack the game or abuse exploits
---
Dont harass other players because you lost/won, like going in private just to offend people and being racist/homophobic (thats more human decency than a rule)
---
I think thats all
---
Other than that, you're clear to do whatever you want on any side you take.
---
[removed]
---
Respect man. Really, your response moved my view on this going forward and I appreciate you.
---
THAT'S
---
A lot of those killers are at least part time m1 killers. 
---
Myers is like the definition of m1. With him monitor and abuse is pretty good. His perks play with your food and save the best for last are also quite useful. Ruin helps with his general lack of map pressure and enduring/spirit fury/tremendous strength are good for countering pallets since you will be eating a fair share of them.
---
Leatherface has to play like an m1 killer a lot of the time as well because his ability isn‚Äôt great. Play with your food can help him a bit with applying map pressure.
---
Spirit can probably get away with using strider and pop goes the weasel as she is both mobile and lethal. Though you can always use a more traditional ruin build.
---
Sloppy butcher is a good general perk you can use to fill in any perk build if you don‚Äôt have many teachables. It‚Äôs especially good on legion. 
---
Speaking of legion with him and his power I like to inflict deep wounds on as many people as possible and with the last person who is in reasonable reach hit them, stay in frenzy, chase them until their speed boost runs out, then exit frenzy and continue chase. It helps a lot in making it so you don‚Äôt lose too much distance like you would if you immediately leave frenzy.  Also spirit fury works with his iredescent button which is hilarious. Spirit fury in general is good on legion because some survivors will waste a pallet after getting hit with frenzy stun you out of frenzy, and then get downed.
---
Aside from that I suggest watching some streamers or their YouTube. Tru3 Monto and Otz taught me a lot about hiding my red stain, mind gaming, moonwalking, abusing unsafe pallets, and how to predict survivors and prioritize goals.
---
Is that the 1.5 or 2x bloodpoints?
---
Yeah, there it is. "Lol look at you getting angry". So, you really didn't have anything? You admit you're just commenting to troll people? C'mon, admit you didn't even read what I said.
---
Ash is still in the game they just switched him out with Joker. There‚Äôs gonna be a second pack. 
---
This is all according to the leaks on /r/mortalkombatleaks which have been spot on so far
---
No need to get hostile. Canada's tax funded education and healthcare programs are not socialist. Socialism refers to economic and political philosophies based on social ownership of capital. Canada is a capitalist democracy.
---
I still sometimes give up a hit because I automatically assume I'm going to get vacuum slapped.
---
Report them, its bannable. Likely wont work but worth a shot
---
Plastic maybe, like a shard of his mask.
---
I see you sneaking nea in the back
---
That is the most vegan thing I've ever heard
---
Yeah, I imagine them mainly in isolation but able to interact with each other if they want.
---
Sorry
---
I have been you and it sucks when you play a really tough game and you feel hella deflated, but I want to promote positivity in that. We can‚Äôt win them all.
---
No point in dragging one another down, just a case of showing perspectives: life is shit and rough to us. This game is a huge outlet for me and I guarantee it‚Äôs your down time too. 
---
Good luck with the next, friend! Proud of you and grateful you took the other perspective on board üíú
---
Anyone know who this girl is? I was friends with someone who looked just like her. Poor lass died when a drunk fuck hit her.
---
I love the drawing style üòç
---
If someone dies on the hook down there it permanently counts them, it seems.
---
Agreed, it's less of a big deal since the hole can heal shut. It feels like a needle going through your skin. It hurts, but it's not unbearable.
---
My step-daughter is 7 years old and wanted them pierced. It wasn't done when she was a baby so it could be her choice. She went and they did one... she then freaked out and didn't want to keep going.
---
Now she's only got one ear pierced and there doesn't seem to be any plans to go for the other.
---
It's kind of funny.
---
F! Love fan content!
---
exit gate: *doesn‚Äôt work*
---
Hatch: fine I‚Äôll do it myself
---
Dude I literally said just now how you can get more benefit than just facecamping even if the gates are open. Facecamping means you're preventing the unhooks, but you're actually interested in them trying so you could at least hook them instead. Or if you're really lucky even get more hooks at once.
---
Ok no camping is an easy rule
---
Same with T-bag, these disrespect the players. However no flashlight???? The hecc it‚Äôs an item that can be useful as all hecc like come on. About tunneling, I may not know what that is so I can‚Äôt say anything there.
---
Doctor doesn‚Äôt care his face is just constantly like that
---
Is friends with killer:| Steve, Nancy
---
So uhh get bbq on billy and main him for the most part as he is one of the stronger killers, slugging people is a fairly viable option to slow the game down whispers 3 is good on him as well for finding survivors other then that the only other means to slow the game down are bandaid fix perks unfortunately
---
I love bubba, such a goof. He's actually really fun when you get good with him, it just takes suffering through several speed limiter matches first.
---
And survivors aren't reacting the same to proxy camping as to facecamping because it really isn't the same. You aren't just staring at another player's avatar watching them to die.
---
I can hear this image
---
That one that heals over time promotes tunneling (because if killer doesn't, you'll heal for free).
---
Another one, that heals you in lockers, will force more killers to actually take DS hits from lockers. And killer is less likely to switch, because if they will, you'll hide in a locker and heal for free. 
---
And all new killer perks are revolved around survivors working on gens, what's actually lame, because only the lame trio of top killers  can reliably benefit from this kind of perks.
---
I hope for some changes that will shake up weak killers, because so far nothing good for them's there.
---
Never! I shall keep running No Mither, Self Care, Deja Vu, and Open Handed as well as bring a purple medkit with an insta heal! Muwhahaha I am god!
---
*You like jazz?*
---
Reporter and dance Nancy

Ohhh it's time for a barbecue!!!

Could you link the video for me please? I tried his channel but don't know which one discuss that subject.
---
Its Kate.
---
https://youtu.be/TtsfoU0Eo8Q
---
The easiest rule I‚Äôd love is: if you‚Äôre a killer and you‚Äôve won by closing the hatch and downing me as the last survivor, don‚Äôt just stare at me and dance around until the timer runs out -_-
---
Upside-down creatures have an aversion to heat, and the entity doesn't like light. Presumably its sensory organs are in the petals, so maybe it's the heat from the light burning it.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
I would say self care
---
Only cause i noticed people downvoting the ones that said self care so I wanted to see if they would read all this and still downvote it
---
no bra nurse when?
---
Yes because we need survivors to get nerfed more? DS is already 60s how much more is this perk going to get butchered to please killers? Its perfectly fine as it is.
---
You're not only have to DOWN someone, you have to down someone with a BASIC attack. So basically perk for nurse and a spirit, since only them can catch you fast enough with just basic attacks.
---
2x
---
Well, i dont think hes supposed to be handsome...
---
Ive played Silent Hill 3. Ive fought some bigger dicks in my time.
---
Like NOED.
---
So then which one is the 1.5?
---
My specs are   
---
Intel 9600k  
---
GTX 1080
---
16GB DDR4 3200mz
---
windows 10 64 bit
---
You're kidding right...
---
did she really? when did this happen?
---
I think 1.5 is only when they do events with no double bp like the hallowed blight or the lunar new year event where you need to do the event hooks and gens to get the 1.5
---
So we don't need "shitty ass new players"?   
---
I think we don't need him instead.  
---
Joking around but seriously, why can't we just be nice to new Players...
---
?
---
I was once playing with some friends and we were all intentionally bringing shitty items and addons. I used a white ward for a dull key with nothing else. That‚Äôs just how I roll.
---
I like to think that in a different timeline I can run around Coal Tower as Ronald McDonald and see Wendy self caring in a corner while being chased by the King.
---
"If the pizza isn't to the customer in 30 minutes, it's free... *and we still got 5 gennies to go.*"
---
No. 
---
Can you imagine 4 survivors with an insta stun item in a single game? 
---
It's like none of the people downvoting me play killer.
---
Rip
---
What are you talking about? The perks are completely fine lmao.
---
Thanks. For anyone else interested, Hybrid talks about the bloodweb changes at 03:00.
---
Her name is Maya Hawke
---
First time seeing a Holocaust meme
---
It targets anyone but it finds kids to be more better
---
Lmao imagine caring about barb.
---
This comment was made by Alexie deserved better gang
---
It‚Äôs the same for me. Green ranks is where most of the sweat is at. Red and purple have their share of sweaty Survivors, but it‚Äôs not as bad green ranks.
---
Put the doctor and billy down too.
---
Nobody knows. It‚Äôll be a Tuesday though.
---
This is the most likely situation.  They wanted to just give away shit to other survivors before they prestige and it is eaten by the entity completely unused.
---
PTB is probably this Tuesday meaning the full release is in about 2-3 weeks
---
But the person never said the bat stuns, they said it slows.
---
Also if you're going to make an item 1/1000 which is 1% then it's literally pointless to put the item in the game in the first place.
---
Hey, that's a cool drawing!
---
Do you have any proof this is your work?
---
Maybe direct us to more of this cool artwork!
---
I think the fur trim jacket and ponytail one will def be a skin, as it is in one of her perks. Her other, up in the air.
---
I'm about to run Saboteur &amp; Breakdown to permanently end the hook horrors.

If the credits are anything to go by, that statement is laughably wrong. You clearly ignorant of how their workforce is actually divided. If you're basing these assertions on the fact that we mostly see cosmetic releases, then... Yeah, no shit, it's easier and faster to make a shirt than it is to introduce something that potentially impacts balance in your multiplayer experience. If you're studying game design, you should know this. Your bitching about cosmetic prices isn't even relevant. For one, like I said, that's how they fund continued development, since that directly puts money into the pocket of Behavior Interactive's 500 employees. For two, whether or not the cosmetics are bad or the pricing is wrong is subjective, people will pay for what they like. Considering how often I see players with purchased cosmetics (oh most of which can be bought with free shards anyway), you're in the minority here.
---
Dumb lmao
---
Not really, quite literally the opposite. He suspected DS so he waited until the very last second to pick her up, hoping that the timer would have run out by then. It's the very definition of trying hard lol.
---
It‚Äôll be good with huntress‚Äô lullaby for the extra 6% regression though.
---
it would be based off of fear.

#[**BWENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN**](/intensifies)
---
The perks they revealed are strong, especially in the survivors side since give the opportunity to heal in less than 20s most of the time.
---
Even so I find dumb the suggestions to tweak or buff them before anybody even tried them..
---
For example the killer perk that blows gens, without trying I can't judge it if it's trash tier or decent since I have no idea if it works with PGTW or not. You don't have to look them as a single perk but in combination of other perks to judge them.
---
6 perks in the survivors side will be released and already 3 of them are even too strong to me while just 1 killer perk MIGHT be good depending on synergies. Still, we need to try them before judging them, it can turn out that my thoughts would be wrong in game, without counting that THE NUMBERS CAN HAVE CHANGES as they stated many times before and after showing them
---
they can bitch about Freddy all they want but I'm gonna assume at least 2 of them had adren or DS
---
They did indeed.

My name deadass is Joey and I am confuse as of this is me or not

Like Adams arent always the first ones hooked. I swear though Everytime there's a Adam I find them first
---
Why so angry at people who don't share your opinion about a single perk? Lol Play how you want. You do you, man.
---
Kate denson is always what the community wants
---
This is what I'm saying. Its pathetic how many people are jumping on the hate bandwagon. I dont if its cus they need to feel better about themselves or they just like bringing people down. 
---
Theres so many posts on this sub about stopping toxicity but the comments on that post just goes to show how much bullshit people speak. And again, its pathetic.
---
Survivors tend to like the mindset of "I can take stupid overpowered shit and that's okay but when it happens to me, it's not okay. Not okay at all and I'm gonna flame you." I feel like Monto said it best "This is fun when I play it but when it happens to me it's not fun at all, fuck that". Except the difference is he brushes it off, other people will launch personal attacks at you. Though Freddy isn't even that strong if you know how to play against him, so they were just babies.
---
But at the same time, @DeadByBHVR is fucking joking right?
---
You always get matched with Rank 20s, I haven't escaped it yet and I've already hit Rank 5 again after the last reset.
---
I don't know if Ranks 1 to 4 get matched with Rank 20s, but Rank 5s certainly do, pretty consistently even, there's usually a rank 15 to 20 every other game at best, and half the time there's two or three.
---
It‚Äôs just how a lot of players in pretty much every game are unfortunately :/

The difference is also that behind dark souls and other offline games, there's an AI programmed to react to certain situations with set actions. They will never stray from that and this way you can learn and become skilled. With games like DBD you have to rely on (let's call it) the kindness of strangers to play fair and square and thus becoming better step by step. No killer will play the same style because there's a human being behind the screen. ü§∑

Why do you care?
---
Something out of reality like that has no gender, at least humans can't even get close to comprehend. So either way is fine, why call it him? I can suggest different reasons. Why not call it she? Same thing.
---
I don't get it why this post even exist. Who cares? That kind of thing doesn't live in our society/solar system/plane of existence anyway

please tell me how anyone was trying to BuLlY him
---
I know, I've been around for quite some time now, this one just hit me in a really weird way and I needed to vent a little.
---
Maybe he came in with a rare item and used it all or dropped it and picked that up. Would he exit the game with both?

Yeah, even with the obnoxious shirtless, red pants cosmetic that's up there with the bright wig/facemask Nea's, David's aren't usually all that bad.

---
Genitals and genders are different you know?
---
You cannot compare DnD to anything else outside DnD especially for something that isn't human. I can create a story where something that look kinda manly in our society be a she in her society and plane of existence.
---
As you said the entity has no gender, like Gorgon but idk why the hell would you care and say it does without explaining why it does and the entity don't..
---
I wonder.. do you think sex and gender are the same thing? Because by your replies you look so confused about it
---
It's very character dependent. I'd say on hearing-reliant killers like Spirit, Nurse, and Ghostface, Stridor can definitely compete with whispers but on everyone else whispers is better

Doctor isn't too bad unless they're the hostage docs. he just stops all stealth play so you just have to nonstop run around the whole map and force him to pressure gens.

My friend and I used a rainbow map and key. The one time we coordinate to such a degree.
---
We get matched with a rank 4 hag using Franklin's demise and ebony mori.

*never again*
---
People who like to tunnel would for sure notice a pause. These killers make it a point to break chase and go back to the hook.
---
Toxic nea main

How can I drop an item without picking a new one up?
---
Easy, he's sticking it in his throat and slightly regurgitating a half decomposed head to "look" into the telescope.

BOOM. FIXED.

Holding R will let you drop your item.

wait did you watermark a picture that you dont own cuz you put text on it?

It's funny cause I've never even played fortnite, I just got a video sent to me by my friend about fortnite ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Genuine enjoyment?
---
Thanks!
---
I can vouch for this.  I got hooked in basement and was wondering why my teammates weren‚Äôt coming for me but it was because the killer was just chilling in the shack lol. I wasn‚Äôt hearing a heartbeat though.
---
Also guys, stop with the fortnite bad.
---
It's not when you have a full party and don't have to deal with the rando's and community which is like 95% of the problem.
---
Made with mematic premium
---
in that case, killers should have the same concept.
---
Luck is underwhelming because, honestly, having full control over shit like that (ESPECIALLY the RBT) is stupidly powerful.
---
You go a full luck team? I guess pig is literally worthless, trapper to at that rate, maybe it instantly reveals ghostface too?
---
If they wanted to do this, they'd need to do the same with killer, since it directly fucking destroys killers.
---
They can degrade or increase their own luck, get better spawns, more/less/better totems, have a random chance of 1-shotting (the equivalent of wrecking pigs bear traps), etc.
---
This is a horrible idea, if im totally honest.
---
Luck needs more, but not this, not even close to this
---
I edited the beginning so it makes more sense
---
Survivors
---
Killer's strongest perks are used to cover up huge weaknesses like for M1 killers enduring and SF due to their nature. Or others who have a good chase potential like huntress run perks who helps find people
---
In the other hand if you play survivor without perks you are fine since you don't have many weakness mechanics wise. You still have plenty of opportunities to evade the killer even without any of them, but thanks of those you can have, one extra hit with DH, extra health state with adrenaline, extra information with any aura perk, extra gen speed with prove thyself etc
---
If you take away from a M1 killer essential perk combos you make him trash, if you take away all perks away from a survivor it won't change much. They just won't get downed with 2 hits but 3, that's it.
---
I've got my first one a week ago with the pig. I hooked one down there, ran up and snuck up on a new somehow, pretty funny tbh, but after I brought the nea down I noticed scratch marks so I hooked nea and then opened a locker and got a wild Feng. After that the last nea basically gave herself too me lmao. I recorded it I might post it later
---
You aren't exactly useful to the team unless you know exactly what you should be doing
---
Devs keep saying they want to have Luck affect more things. I think prior to Hag's release Luck actually effected how often you get skill checks. 
---
Devs have said they want luck to effect chests. 
---
Luck doesn't affect RBT's. It's flat out assigned to a certain box and not an actual "Chance per box". Devs have said this several times and I don't think they have any reason to lie about it.
---
I was confused lmao I thought Joey was referring to Joey from the Legion.
---
And they escaped too lol
---
I'm always the one in a 15 minute chase with the killer while everyone gen rushes
---
Same, I thought this was Engrish.
---
It's simple. they can't accept a loss and so they make themselves look even worse by disconnecting
---
Awesome! I'ma check it out! Sorry your other comment got deleted btw, forgot links cant be posted.
---
They escaped=It worked
---
Yeah, I bought the spirit and she‚Äôs a load of fun, plus she‚Äôs really OP when I get a good game
---
YOU CAN DO THAT?! :o
---
I 100% assumed it'd be like those wondrous trucks and the like.
---
Wouldn't you do the same?
---
Cool, but against a smart killer there will be no 15 minute chases, either they leave because they are wasting their time or they end up downing you quickly
---
Is it though? Just seemed like nostalgia bait to me and honestly not that interesting
---
Unfortunately, there's Hopper too
---
Title is lowkey upvote bait.
---
her best by far is nurse's calling, i use it on all 16 killers
---
lol why are we blaming players for toxicity when ita BHVRs dam fault their game allows it in the first place
---
derankers? increase punishments or reward staying high rank
---
unfair matchmaking? fix the fucking system its been said a thousand times 
---
tbh im hoping new player retention is absolute dogshit for ST fans cause itll hurt the bottom line and forcr BHVR to evaluate quality of life instead of just pushing out more uninspired licensed garbage
---
As an Ash main, I'm never toxic and all my kin are chill af.  
---
It's like Evil Dead fan's know to have a groovy time.
---
I saw that was in that game and thought it was to silly. Doesn't belong here.
---
no mither is the worst perk. when does the killer just down u and leave u there?
---
Im guessing maybe coz a new chapter is coming out so people just get their ranks and perks up so they can have just fun and experiment when the new killer comes out without having to worry about bloodpoints or rank since they stock up. And to stock up they use the most effective way
---
you need a tldr version of that
---
If you lose to someone face camping and tunneling I'm pretty sure the killer isn't the one playing like trash...
---
r/totallyrealsub
---
When they leave I hunt them down and when they down me 9 times out of 10 they go after someone else so I just res myself with no mither
---
Yeah nurse calling is nice but i have a spot left for one of those three so which one do i choose?
---
Its more Please don‚Äôt  scroll past i want this to be added to dbd because I think legion needs a few changes but i will admit i could see that

There's a difference between vegan and whole food plant based. WFPB still occasionally eat meat, but it's rare and in smaller quantities, usually used to accentuate a meal, not serve as the primary protein.
---
In the last 3 months, I've had one thin patty burger at a local party, and a bite of steak at the same party.  A bit of cheese on occasion, but very rarely. No milk (almond milk), no sour cream, no mayo (veganaise). We make our own sour cream substitute with pureed cashews, water, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, and salt. Tastes pretty darn good.
---
Using a vegan chick who died attempting to climb **MOUNT EVEREST** as an example, when numerous people who aren't vegan and aren't female die every year (19 have died this year so far, over 300 have died since 1922), isn't exactly a good example.
---
Nah, those dudes are always chillin under some trees or underneath my balcony.
---
Instead of being a whiny ***** and DC take it as an opportunity to learn more about chases. People like you who DC for such foolish reason are the real problem, not the fact you get chased.
---
Someone has to be first being chased, if that's you even better, you'll get good at it and when you're decent you give a huge chance for your team to finish generators and a big amount of BP earned..
---
Kids these days DC for anything.. I guess if you play a fighting game if the opponent hits you first you dc as well? If you die in a shooter first you dc there too? It's the same logic, flawed
---
The game is designed around chases and time management, learn it instead of crying about it
---
I mean that's like....your opinion man
---
PFFFFFFT
---
I‚Äôd say less than a month 2-3 weeks at most
---
Nah, Ash would just think they are demons who look like movie monsters and act accordingly.  
---
Don't think he would question it past 2 seconds tbh.
---
Not really. The teachables don't imply a need to know each other. The teachables could be imparted with nothing else through the bloodweb. I don't think they learn them through interaction and discussion, rather they consciously or unconsciously inherit and adopt those skills through the bloodweb like a gene pool. The bloodweb connects all of their skills to each other, but it would be hard to argue that becausee of this the killers are aware of one another. I mean, if just receiving new skills means they become aware of other killers then why don't addons and their base perks give them the same awareness? They are learning those from the bloodweb too.

What's referred to as a toxic Claudette
---
Thanks my internet was funky today and people assumed I was lag switching.
---
Ive only been playing survivor lately, cuz im teaching my buddy the game. we get really fast queues, always less than a min. but when I switch to killer after he gets off, I wait for like 5mins for a match...
---
You kind of missed the entire point here.
---
Kinda cringe, but, if we're being honest, it's not an awful idea. FNaF is a big series that has games still being released, so there is a lot of ideas to pull from. Obvisouly the map could be any of the pizzarias (or other locations) found in the games. The obvisous choice for a killer would be Freddy Fazbear, but Springtrap could also be interesting. Most of the killers that could be pulled from FNaF could just be dubbed "The Animatronic." If Freddy was a killer, his ability could cause generators to regress over time if not being worked on, since in the original game he only appears when power runs out. I'd imagine he'd be very weak against flashlights, since they played a big role in his games. His mori could be the song that plays during his jumpscare followed by him stuffing the surviver in a animatronic suit, crushing them in the process.
---
"Why not call it she" because its not a girl. In the show its not a girl? It was a QUESTION. I asked why do ppl call it a girl i literally only see ppl in dbd call it a girl. The person said that a gorgon is a girl n they are probably confusing it with the demogorgon which is comepletely different. In stranger things they say he or it. They dont say she so i was confused to why ppl were saying she somuch.
---
I‚ÄôM FAST AF BOYYY
---
I like ps4 community more imo you don‚Äôt see just nurse every game Freddy is fun to play against and you get a variety of killers too

yeah but its just one measly daily, and 30k points is like nothing. just replace it. i keep replacing them until i get a hunting one or especially  a mori. but i havent gotten one of those in weeks! really pretty crazy. as if they removed them. but its just my bad luck recently

Saving blood points is common so you can use them on PTB. Saving shards is smart to get non-licensed characters you really want or need.
---

It's something you can deal with, but the fact that there's a daily that you basically have to reroll is kinda dumb.

You are playing against noob killers if they let you just keep looping and harassing them while generators get done. I will either slug you or just ignore you til I‚Äôve killed everyone else. Then I will punish you later. What you‚Äôre describing won‚Äôt work against a killer with two brain cells to rub together.

Meh, I'm done talking with someone so clearly trolling on a throwaway account. You're right, your opinion on how something tastes to you can't be wrong. But your statement that something doesn't taste good, when you haven't even tried it, can be and is wrong. Unless you've been secretly raiding my fridge at night. üò≥
---
Thats fair enough then, i just dont think it should effect anything that directly fucks over the killer, remember, its needs to be considered that you can have over 24% luck with 4 survivors, 4 add ons and 1 perk on each. Thats an enormous increase.
---
I agree it needs to do something else, because its kinda just useless, but i'd recommend it had more unique effects. Random chance to do XYZ
---
Rule 599: The wraith must always use ‚ÄúThe Beast‚Äù Soot if going invisible.

Idk how it works exactly but it interupts the survivors connection to you, so you can walk upto them while theyre stuck in place due to lag and when they re-connect youre right behind them. Its mostly for chases.
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
I can hear the REEEEing from that second image. Also is the joke that the demogorgon has a flower type face or what?
---
If someone is spending their whole game being chased/being unhooked than most likely you're tunneling them and they're having a very bad time. A good way to prevent yourself from doing so is just to slug them after 2nd hook and hopefully their team helps them recover.

Fun fact theres no such thing as geni rushing while being chased for 15 minutes . As a experienced player  who's knows every loop in every map the longest I've ever been chased was was about 5 minutes realistically.  And that's enough to do 3 maybe 4 generator's if the rest of the survivors know. But 15 minutes ? I believe the killer was either not taking you seriously or was just farming you
---
Even a slow.
---
That's like, Half of the killers for me
---
Yeah I wish they'd just change the intro of the game to something new, we've been dealing with the same Trapper intro for 3 freaking years, come on Behavior please!

Those are hookswords.

People that slug like that are just as toxic as people who tbag at the gates and he deserved that

TOXIC AVENGER (Melvin Ferd)
---
Perk 1: CLEANUP DUTY
---
When crouching you have the ability to erase bloodstains left by yourself or other players. After cleaning up 9/6/3 pools you leave no scratch marks when running for 12 seconds.
---
"Cleanup on aisle six!" - Melvin Ferd
---
Perk 2: Tromatized
---
When you are damaged by a killer's LUNGE attack, you will be given a skill check the next time the killer attempts to carry you in the next 4/8/10 seconds. Passing this check will cause the first hook the killer takes you to to become damaged for 5/10/15 seconds.
---
"Iv'e broken a few hoops in my day..." - Melvin Ferd
---
Perk 3: With a Face Like This
---
When you are within 3/5/8 meters of the killer and they look in your direction all of their aura reading abilites will give off false alarms for 6 seconds and continue until they break sight of you. This has a cooldown of 60 seconds.
---
"Don't let this handsome face fool you!" - Melvin Ferd

If you have almost every teachable unlocked, you can buy 150k BP per perk on Shrine. PTB goes live on the refresh day for Shrine which means you can buy 8 perks within hours instead of having to wait 7 days. Obviously this doesn't matter if you haven't the shrine's perks unlocked yet. This week's shrine I don't own *Wake Up* but all the others will net me extra 550k BP on top of 100k+ from dailies completed but unclaimed.
---
Still a thing out of reality and genderless.
---
You can read my points again if you didn't understand that
---
You can call it whatever since it's A not human B conform to our society norms
---
Is it an offering?
---
They were eating regular food until 3 months ago, so you're wrong. We all know you haven't successfully reproduced, so you don't get to talk about child abuse unless you're talking about your childhood. Have a nice life, you're blocked.
---
That brutality he has with the hammer was seriously some of the gristliest shit I've seen in a game. MK or otherwise.
---
I'd say the biggest new killer perk is Legion's Discordance. It makes a loud noise notification and highlights gens while more than one survivor work on them.
---
Well if you didn't like it you could've just ignored it
---
*Kabal
---
Thanks Thanos Hatch
---
The effort we put into original content
---
You shouldn't need an ultra rare for a daily. 
---
You shouldn't need to force suboptimal play to make a daily happen.
---
I DO like him and his content actually, that's the problem, the fact that him and his audience likes to basically disown anyone who doesn't 100% line up with his ideology does draw more hate.
---
You're already telling me to live my own life and go watch someone else and using standard buzzword phrases like "that ain't it chief" along with winky faces to prove a point.
---
I'm just pointing out the possible reason towards the hate he gets. The semi-recent storm of snipers he's been getting is disgusting I agree, but you gotta see that the way he handles it obviously is a big part in causing more to come, anyone with knowledge of internet trolls and who has been on the internet for more than a few days should realize that right? It does get even worse when he lumps everyone under that same umbrella and that's where you get people who just hate him because he already assumes stuff about them.
---
Oh, i see
---
Well, sadly camt do much other tham wishing you better luck with your team for your next trials
---
Maybe you can find people to make a SWF with you
---
Death is not an escape. Living is not an escape. There just ain't no escape.
---
Except for Bill, he managed to escape, glad he got snatched by the Entity again
---
I can't prestige before I play a character &gt;:(
---
The joke is basically that he used a very rare offering to protect his item and brought the most basic shitty item with him.
---
Like putting an insurance on a standart run off the mill pen.
---
Is that all you do is make claims, make assumptions about people who call you out, and then block them? That‚Äôs depressing. You call yourself a conservative? Pathetic.
---
I'd swap PWYF to STBFL, from a lore perspective. He saves the most scared, the tastiest fear, for dessert.
---
I agree heavily for me it‚Äôs flip flop that‚Äôs underrated
---
Is your plan to sit there camping their medkit while people do gens? The perk can be fun but don't tell me it's a good perk lol. It's far worse than like half of killer perks
---
Yeah, that's true, but PWYF has a spider icon so I figured it was more fitting for Pennywise
---
My play style is a solo style, i also don't like to speak to other people.
---
killers hitbox? as in pallet drops?
---
Don't you mean "aroused" ?
---
Apparently you will cry when you get looped by a survivor. Why don‚Äôt you ask the survivors to stand still and let you down them?
---
Are you sure you have a brain to understand how hitbox works?
---
Well if you get paired with SWFs that don't do any generators it's easy. Be useless and don't do generators because then they can't leave if the generators ain't done (they can if they find hatch but you get it)
---
Yes lol, being downvoted for suggesting the game should be more challenging.
---
BUGS POST 3.1.3 - PS4
---
‚Ä¢ *VISUAL*: The Nightmare's left hand is considered as part of The Nightmare's weapon. This is very noticeable when you selecting the Bloody Gardener cosmetic as his left hand remains unbloody, but when you select the Bloody Clawed Glove cosmetic, then his left hand becomes bloody.
---
‚Ä¢ *VISUAL*: When The Legion is Pallet Stunned right when activating Feral Frenzy, the Feral Frenzy UI SFX remains until Feral Frenzy is activated again.
---
‚Ä¢ *AUDIO*; When a Survivor, Pallet Stuns The Hillbilly while he's revving his Chainsaw, the Chainsaw SFX loops infinitely until The Hillbilly revs his Chainsaw again.
---
‚Ä¢ *VISUAL*; When a Survivor with Prove Thyself disconnects, the Prove Thyself perk icon appears in all Survivors UI's until the Trial ends.
---
‚Ä¢ *VISUAL &amp; AUDIO*; The Killer Instinct VFX and the heartbeat SFX triggered by Feral Frenzy tends to be very unreliable after inflicting a Deep Wound upon at least two Survivors.
---
‚Ä¢ *VISUAL*; If you are hooked for the first time while infected by Vile Purge, the black smoke UI VFX glitches layers between the Vile Purge infection UI VFX. This is a common issue and will happen whenever you're sick put into the first phase of sacrifice.
---
‚Ä¢ *AUDIO*; Whenever you're Exposed from Evil Within III, the Exposed SFX is auditably louder and doesn't mesh well with the Evil Within III SFX.
---
‚Ä¢ *MENU*; The "NO DAILY RITUALS" message that appears after you've completed all you're current Daily Rituals doesn't always appear. I'm not sure why this message doesn't always appear but this is very common.
---
‚Ä¢ *MENU*; The featured Survivor and Killer tends to be Micheal Myers and Laurie Strode when they should be the current latest characters (Ashley J. Williams and Ghost Face). I believe this might occur when you own all DLC's but otherwise I'm not sure. Either way this is very common.
---
‚Ä¢ *MENU*; When viewing a Killers loadout in the scoreboard, while a trail is still in progress, and the Killer's loadout is hidden, The text saying that the Killer's loadout is hidden is missing.
---
‚Ä¢*MENU*; The backing that's behind all the currency counters in the menus is slightly off.
---
‚Ä¢ *AUDIO*; When equipped in the lobby, The Pig's Twisted Trefoil Blade cosmetic makes the power tool SFX when tapping the "READY" and "UNREADY" interactions, and when equipting add-ons, perks, or offerings.
---
‚Ä¢ *AUDIO*; When equipped in the lobby, The Pig's, The Saw cosmetic doesn't play a reciprocating saw SFX at all.
---
‚Ä¢ *VISUAL*; The Pig's Twisted Trefoil Blade and The Saw cosmetics on occasion, appear to disappear after preforming attacks during a trial. What exactly triggers this is seemingly random since it only sometimes happen after preforming an attack, being pallet stunned, Decisive Strike stunned, after picking up a Survivor, etc.
---
‚Ä¢ *VISUAL*; If you change any cosmetics piece on The Huntress, during her "Hunting Hatchet throw" idol lobby animation, the hatchet disappears from her hand until thrown.
---
‚Ä¢ *MENU*; The "MATCH CANCELLED" message text isn't written uppercase like other messages.
---
‚Ä¢ *MENU*; The scoreboard still uses the outdated system of rounding your Rank, meaning, if you're Rank 2 and 4 Pips, I'll show you as Rank 1. This also brings with it a bug that causes you to appear as Rank 2 in the scoreboard, even when you're Rank 1.
---
‚Ä¢ *GAMEPLAY*; When the basement spawns inside of Gas Heaven autobody shop, the roof above the basement enterence is slightly too low and the Killer's head will bump into it causing them to either stop or get stuck in place momentarily.
---
‚Ä¢ *AUDIO*; When a Survivor disconnects while you're carrying them, the "carrying Survivor" music continues to play until another music is triggered.
---
‚Ä¢ *AUDIO*; The "Found Survivor In Locker" stinger is missing from the Killer's FoV.
---
How you worded it made it seem like only the last sentence was sarcasm
---
Thanks.
---
Thing is, that‚Äôs very fitting for Ash‚Äôs character. And yeah, it was mainly MoM that made the Ash players cocky asshats- I should know, I am one of them. I wasn‚Äôt an asshat, but I could for sure be cocky a lot of the time because of MoM.
---
Bloodhound is pretty useful Because now that fixated exists survivors can just try to walk away with how fast they are and survivors already do that with urban evasion plus stratch marks aren't always the best and fixated again can make it so survivors make scratch marks confusing.
---
Oh my god..jus woosh...wooosh to the max. Im not disagreeing with the fact that u can call it whatever u want i was for the third time ASKING A QUESTION. i said "WHY do ppl in this SPECIFIC COMMUNITY call it a she." If ppl from the stranger things community did it i wouldnt ask. I thought maybe there was a specific a reason to why. Since in the SHOW its a "it" or "he" like if Groot from Marvel. Its a it but ppl call groot a man because of the creators. So if out of nowhere ppl in a specific group started calling groot a she asking why isnt crazy seeing the demogorgon has been labled as he n it for YEARS. If someone called you a MAN for YEARS and then a group of ppl called u a she wouldnt u be like oh why are u calling me a girl? For the love of god thats the main POINT AND TOPIC the topic isnt "what do u think the gender is" the topic is "why in this SPECIFIC COMMUNITY is there alot of ppl who call it a she" but please do go on making it something its 100% not and continue the gender debate every1 loves debating about genders im a toaster with a unicorn horn thats what my gender is
---
I still have had it around 900,000 points since last week, so hopefully am good fingers crossed.
---
Jesus man. No need to be an asshole.
---
Yea hope it helps teach them they can't just sit back and force a solo to do everything and except to escape. Good luck
---
OMEGALUL
---
Kabals the next killer
---
You could say the same thing about Freddy, but the Entity was able to affect his abilities anyway.
---
hitbox  
---
works  
---
LULW
---
maybe the game can sense that they need a coach to guide them down the true path
---
It‚Äôs very fitting for Ash and his character- cocky, and sometimes idiotic, but never really cruel (though I‚Äôm sure there are conflicting examples from the show for that last one). But yeah, this is why I run We‚Äôll Make It- I‚Äôm willing to save someone else and let them get out instead of me. It‚Äôs like you said- Evil Dead fans know how Ash would really act (or, at least, how Ash at the end of Season 3 would act).
---
For survivor the classic adrenaline, dead hard, ds, self care
---
SWF groups aren't always bad for killers. I've had this happen before as well. It's very fristrating and sucks when you depip. 
---
Matchmaking needs to be separated into Solos/Duos/Quads. Solo play would be so much better for solo players and killers. There is no way to properly balance a game when players that can communicate are grouped with ones that aren't. 
---
It's no different in any other game. 
---
Apex, Fortnite, PUBG, BO4 - Blackout. If you go in with a teammate or two and get a random ... they will always end up being eliminated before everyone else or you won't go for the save over your friend. The difference, you know that going in. 
---
This game would improve ten fold.
---
Why would you post this here though
---
As an Adam main, I can say that we're tunneled for this exact reason. I hardly ever last a match as Adam. But when I switch to Nea or Meg, I'm slugged if tunneled off the hook instead of being put back on.
---
I may have Deliverance, but I have a heart. Pls killers
---
I don't post to reddit often so I lowkey botted out.
---
I dont think this fits with the theme of the game that well. Hes a really strong being and that might be hard to translate to ingame mechanics. We did get freddy though, so who knows
---
i dont mind this meme but can you please stop with the "an interesting title" literally just take 10 seconds to think about it.
---
Better to save the toolbox for the end when you have less time to get a gen done.
---
Where is this coming from?
---
If you read some of the posts you'll figure out why.
---
Most of the time entitled to stuff they are not entitled to, expect to win using the same strategy and so on
---
Even the killer side has the same problem but as far I'm aware, in a way lesser capacity
---
He does not want to admit his mistake
---
they all live in a big brother house and go into a special room to complain about each other to the entity
---
Noed is trash on a lot of killers, but i agree
---
Thanks I got a few I need to unlock still for everyone to use.
---
I was pissed when it showed up after I put a shit ton into him recently. Gonna go for Franklin's Demise so its not a complete waste of my time
---
Nuxia mains RISE UP
---
scoops ahoy time
---
This sounds pretty bad ngl
---
Yup
---
Yeah, but STBFL also has multiple survivors in a group on it, which is even more fitting.
---
Plus the waste of time..by the time they finish one gen doing that I finished 2 of them even missing skillchecks
---
It‚Äôs also good on Myers just because he can use the time it takes to find and break it to tier up, or better yet, no one finds it and he just tiers up with 3 or 4 gens not done.
---
You don't need it, just makes lean marking much quicker. I've done it without it plenty of times too, but if you're having difficulties, that addon would make it easier for you.

I started saving bloodpoints so I could upgrade Nancy and get her teachables for Steve ASAP but when I ended up with about 500,000 I ended up just upgrading David and getting the dead hard teachable instead
---
You can level them back to 50 and that's it. The bloodweb will still refresh each time you clear it. Do so with also get you an achievement or trophy depending on your platform.

Can we just acknowledge how badass Freddy looks when standing still in the gate?

Wait, so If you‚Äôre at 1,000,000 bloodpoints already you can pass the limit by buying perks you‚Äôve already unlocked?
---
Mentioning plague but not legion?
---
Temple of Purgation has no offering either. Fml
---
You only have 10 traps, thats not an insane amount. Theres a lot of strategy that goes into her as long as you take the time to really learn her
---
It gave me a good laugh, so why not
---
Is this a Yakuza reference?
---
I spent 4 days before reset leveling him. Got him level 33, checked shrine and saw it was in the shrine. Wasted my damn time.
---
me: having to grab an iri head on huntress to get my bbq
---
Ok, I smirked at that one...
---
I think what you listed are truly the only "rules" there are as far as just trying to promote a non-toxic game/community. Although I'd say it should be no **face**camping, not no camping
---
It‚Äôs not and hopefully that will be fixed when dedicated servers are live.
---
you cant say getting hit through windows after running and getting hit through pallets isnt annoying
---
no pleas
---
Ohhh, got it
---
Yeah I have been spending 100k points on Kate to get her teachables on Claudette so I can stay around 900k mark but still get to 1mill again
---
Isn't urban evasion a top teir perk that completely counters her?
---
Never heard of vegan SAWYER chilli, no.
---
Least fun for me is probably Plague. Nurse is annoying since you have to forget everything you know. 
---
But most annoying and least fun aren't the same thing to me. Doctor is annoying with a ton of effects happening all the time, but it can still be fun. 
---
I also find Freddy rework to be kind of boring. There isn't anything wrong with him, it's just kind of dull to me a lot of the time.
---
&gt;have him not be able to step in his own trap he‚Äôs a pretty balanced killer
---
This would be too strong and wouldn't make any sense. 
---
In my opinion some QOL changes trapper could use is having 2 traps by default and being able to re-arm his traps without picking them up.
---
Then use it anyway. You can still get new bloodwebs you know.
---
I mean I don‚Äôt think it would be too strong he‚Äôs not phasing through Walls and he‚Äôs still getting looped easily it just gives him more pressure to put on survivors I feel
---
Urban Evasion isnt really top tier unless you're going for a stealth build
---
flashlights and insta-heals are bad but remember kids noed is "just a perk"!
---
Eh, she is not particularly difficult to see. I've lost more Neas than I have Claudettes.
---
I only will accept if it is Shirtless Myers
---
I've finally saw the boys and I just now understand the context of this image also yea indeed Freddy and wraith are the "invisible cunts"
---
Slugging was literally his only option. Nothing toxic about it.
---
Lmao legion main. Gtfo
---
that's 100% bullshit and I don't think you've ever had any experience against ds from that comment
---
:'(
---
PS4
---
Type: Pregame connection
---
Unable to join matches as survivor, no issues as killer.
---
Today when I try to play it hangs for a long time on searching for match, usually giving up. occasionally it will instead say there is a problem with my nat type and to check my connection. This does not make sense though as NOTHING has changed with my router or Nat or connection since the other day when the game was working just fine.
---
300 IQ plays. Seriously curious on why that trapper placed traps on both areas of the stairs.
---
Do you know how far a survivor can run in 5 seconds? Picking him up was an autoloss for Freddy.
---
Babysitter is suicide if they‚Äôre using MYC.
---
Tunneling can be an excellent strat. I've gone from rank 20 huntress to rank 14 and whenever someone unhooks and I'm near I always go for the one unhooked. If they are killed it's way less likely everyone else will finish a gen.
---
A perk that literally helps you every game against every killer multiple times a game. It also doesn't require you to change your play style at all.
---
A perk that helps you survive, and also helps your teammates survive because they see you get off the gen and realize the killer may be coming. 
---
Imo it's the best survivor perk in the game.
---
Eh for me it has to be Claudettes because she's just so black and her clothes are also black making her even harder to see.
---
"Just let me DS you and escape for free lulw"
---
Do people actually purposely derank to bully other players with lower skill? Why?
---
To show off that's it but honestly it's not worth it just show the killer your survivor skills or as the killer Visa versa presteging isnt rewarding enough
---
as a nea main I get this
---
No one is as excited as me to see some Professor Membrane meme template in this sub.
---
Nice this is really cool
---
He just fuckin yeets his chainsaw.
---
tbh I think Surveilance is a better combo.
---
If we got Elm Street 3 cosmetics, then we could see the souls stuck in his chest without his sweater
---
They don‚Äôt often do sales, at least not on ps4/console. We had one recently so I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll have another one too soon
---
Would watch/10
---
I‚Äôd rather face a nurse than a spirit tbh
---
And don't forget, when a survivor is hit instead of losing blood they lose cookies
---
I cannot believe I‚Äôm looming at two of my favorite games crossover!!!
---
The whole concept of killers gimping themselves with their own power is pretty outdated.
---
1 1/4 chance to completely negate half of a killers power isnt really worthless.
---
Luck not stacking would make sense, but that wasnt the only suggestion that was made, and i addressed my issues.
---
Buffing luck is fine, but if it went so far as to increase escapes, increase RBT take-offs, better spawns, etc, it'd be exceptionally bad for the killers, considering you could just stack luck.
---
My issue wasnt with just the RBT, my issue was survivors having the ability to directly fuck over a killers whole power.
---
I'm going to hug him and pet him and squeeze him and call him George!

Slugging someone to hit someone else and have 2-3 people not doing gens is an enormous amount of pressure

Immediately picking everyone up and getting DS'd to have no one down at any point is how you lose really fast

Don't hate the player, hate the game
---
(One of these is already a feature, btw)
---
See, neither of those really meet the standards for a pink addon, for me.
---
Hope is pretty underrated.
---
Blood Nea, not every post has to be constructive. This came out of a conversation where I was mocking my survivor main friend when he complained about NoED. He was laughing his ass off and told me I should post it. My SURVIVOR MAIN friend thought this was funny. I tagged it as a shit post to lessen people being offended but I knew there would be people taking it personal.
---
That's crazy. I never really get higher than purple ranks (only have gotten to red ranks once). I get "bullied"/ loose just about as many games as I win, especially if I play killers I suck with like Huntress or Nurse. Instead of purposely deranking after a bad match, I play the killer I'm best at the next match. And of course and use the most OP build I can put together and even a mori if I'm irritated enough. 
---
You can't really get better if you don't go against  someone who's going to give you a challenge.
---
No
---
Bloodhound is solid
---
r/me_irl
---
Omg. What if... when all 4 hooks are occupied, the whole thing rotates like a carousel. That would be fucking awesome!
---
Here's a concept buddy.
---
Dribbling
---
Evil Dade for the killer.
---
I swear to god every fucking time I see more than two items I bring Franklins, and every time I think "I should bring Franklin's" but don't I'm going up against asshats with instaheals and Brand New Parts.
---
Like hmmmmm I wonder why Killers always bring Franklin's or dodge when Survivors bring multiple medkits and toolboxes.
---
For every trap at a hook, that's 1 less trap at a more key point on the map. Only low rank hags put multiple traps at hooks.
---
Most likely cause they would wanna focus on making original killers like plague and then focus on icons like those later
---
Spirit she‚Äôs fun to play and very good
---
I can understand slugging to kill other people.
---
But a player doesn't need to slug the way he did, unless he doesn't know how to dribble, which is one of the easier things to do in the game, so I doubt he didn't know how to dribble.
---
That's magic right there
---
Are you trolling, haven't played in a while, or just really dumb? Dribbling hasn't been a thing since they reworked DS. The skill check is during the pick up animation now. You can see that in the video so I'll assume trolling.
---
This is funny as hell but u don‚Äôt swing the saw though
---
Ahoy fucker, prepare to get flashed and t bagged
---
I've been dealing with the sweat all day, I decided to play Ghostface and just fuck around with the Survivors, most fun I've had all day they were super chill &amp; hilarious
---
As a hag main, I like to throw traps in corners to force the camera flick. If they remove it, they need to remove her weakness to flashlights to compensate. She's completely countered by flashlights
---
He thinks you're hacking basicall
---
Fair, i always expect Franklin's when i see we all have toolboxes lol
---
but fuck bubba anyways
---
Have the sub is whiny 14 year olds that get upset when things don‚Äôt go their way, that‚Äôs the same reason ‚Äúthe rule book‚Äù exists at all, kids wanna have shit their way, and get sad when people are honest with them
---
Yeah, wraith boi got a 4k in endgame.
---
The spot she got downed created the perfect angle for the Claudette to escape
---
Sure.
---
Legion is basically a werewolf like killer or the one that in my eyes when I think of how a werewolf killer would play out it‚Äôs them.
---
Thanks!!
---
This. If it actually silenced the generators I'd run it way more often
---
Who Hurt you
---
For me Myers cause of scratch mirror. I like spookin them bois and Billy cause I can drift that boy around the map
---
Read any post about noed (at least 2 a day, sadly) and find your answers
---
Judging by that trapper‚Äôs cosmetics he could be a newer player as they probably those look the best for no store trapper as such doesn‚Äôt really understand trap placement. However it could also be they unpredictable trapper playstyle where you place traps in the weirdest places possible and somehow it works
---
Def will haha :DD you make a solid point üòå
---
I ask myself that for the past 9 hours
---
I've got 25k bloodpoints every game. I've literally has 12/13 4ks like I'm not even joking.
---
Ash is gonna be there, during the first reveal trailer there was a chainsaw noise and Bruce Campbell leaked it on his twitter, they switched Ash out for Alien in the first pack though.
---
It's still a very good perk on a handful of Killers. Huntress is the obvious mention, but Killers like Doctor (who's power is countered by Lockers), the Chainsaw Killers (who you can jump into a locker to dodge their chainsaw), Spirit and Nurse (jump into a locker after they phase / blink to dodge their attack), and ironically enough Legion (survivor jumps in a locker to dodge FF hit, then comes out and can be instadowned) can all use the perk very well. It's also good in combination with Barbeque since it can counter people hiding in lockers to dodge the aura reveal. And in general the perk can get you some really cheeky kills on big brain Survivors: I ran it for a bit on my Huntress and it got me a lot of cheeky kills. And indeed like people are saying: it'll be really good against people trying to use Inner Strength.
---
Honestly if you're concerned about having A+ tier meta perks excluding BBQ and Ruin you're better off not unlocking any Killer's teachables. A lot of the default Killer perks (most notably Sloppy Butcher, Whispers, and ye ol' NOED) are far stronger than the teachables. But to quote u/nolageek
---
&gt;"any perk I don't use is shit"
---
&gt;We get it.
---
It's obvious that you're a slave to the meta who doesn't understand the concept of wanting to unlock all the perks for completion's sake or try out alternative builds for fun. Not everything has to be S tier. Not everyone has to play Billy, Spirit, or Nurse with Barbeque, Ruin, Haunted Grounds, and NOED.

*annoying Chinese noises*

Dude who pissed in your drink? Jeeze r/leagueoflegends and r/Overwatch are calling, and they want their babyRage back.
---
Umm?? YES???? I would honestly love to see that
---
It's sad to see how bad tunneling has gotten. I'll run borrowed and get them off hook and take a hit and the killer still goes for the other one I dont understand it
---
Lol cheers, your carrot right?
---
Did you read their post?
---
But its ruining the game for everyone. I'll message the killer afterwards and ask them why and all they say is either ez win or that I'm salty because I messaged them. I just want to know how it's fun to stand beside someone and not do anything.
---
Not gonna lie I only main nea because balanced land and stuff

I have been in matchmaking search for the past 45 minutes FUCK YOUR SHIT GAME
---
PLATFORM- PS4
---
So I'm allowed to face camp at basement if I only stay their and no where else right? I let them get every gen and i stay in basement so I'm legally allowed to facecamp?
---
I was referring to the moment of tension between the players when noed activates. Like for the killer, you don‚Äôt have anything to do to get it to work so the power is fully dependent on the survivors doing totems. And survivors can sometimes feel like they get dicked on cause the one totem didn‚Äôt get cleansed. It‚Äôs not like a perk in ire need of updating or changing, but it could be just more entertaining.
---
Imagine being ‚Äòthat guy‚Äô tbh
---
I only just finished all three seasons yesterday because DBD sparked my interest in it, what's so bad about the fanbase? I think the show was amazing too.
---
Im planning on getting all 3 of the new characters and I only have 300,000 bloodpoints
---
Why do people hate stranger things?
---
Yep. Basically that's how bubba works. I just go back to my corner and mow down whoever is stupid enough to come for a save. I've gotten multiple 4ks doing basement Bubba because they try to swarm the hook against the only killer that can down multiple survivors
---
&gt;How the fuck does anyone get every character up to level 50 already at the very least?? I have one survivor prestige and like six killer prestiges?? with 700 hours in the game??
---
If you play killer with BBQ and nothing else (such as 100% BP offering), it takes roughly 5 hours of play time to get to 1m. 
---
This would be 2 characters level 50 every 15 hours of playtime, roughly.
---
I live to bring myself and others suffering.
---
Mainly myself though.
---
You need to shards, a credit card, or auric cells to get content in the store. Are you talking about Prestiging the new characters?
---
*made with mematic*
---
It's a great way for shards too
---
Why is that?
---
Oh my name
---
It is, when people flame me for it all i tell them is "should've stayed outta my basement. You had a free win, instead you got killed "
---
what link?
---
Well even in red ranks I get potato survivors who have less than 100 hours on my team. Matchmaking would be much better if it were based on play time.
---
I love this, this is a big amazing
---
Of course there is. You can take longer to go down, and you can be satisfied in knowing the rest of your teammates are going completely unharmed and unopposed while they complete generators. You may die, but the killer is coming with you. Altruism may be a category fueled by tanking hits, unhooking, and healing, but the word itself goes much deeper than that.
---
Survivors already have multitudinous ways of prolonging chases if you aren't complete ass at the game. If you can't run a jungle gym properly, it's not the killer's fault, you just suck.
---
Regardless, that's just how it is sometimes. You should never expect someone to play in a way that's going to afford you multiple chances. That's not how the adversarial relationship in this game works. 
---
"Oh I'll just give you another chance to live. That's only fair."
---
Right... How many survivors say:
---
"Oh I'll just give you another chance to hit me. That's only fair."
---
No. Survivors will endlessly loop and stick multiple people on a gen while you're being looped, ending the game as quickly as possible, yet when confronted, the response is always "lul bruh what do you expect me to do that's literally my job". *Oh gee, it's almost as if killing is literally the job of the killer to do. Man, I wonder why I never realized that before.* If killers can't dictate to survivors this cockamamie set of honor rules, then survivors can go fuck themselves with the rules they try imposing.
---
what the fuckity fuck
---
Have you heard about the perks coming in the Stranger things DLC?
---
Eh I mean it's literally a waste because if the killer is smart he could just leave you alone forcing you out of the locker and there's only a limited amount of totems and DS is only a one time use also. It more so seems like a waste just to do something once maybe every 10ish games because truth be told head on is ass
---
Bruh no I'm scared of trapper like ik he's one of the weaker killers but uhhh getting caught in a trap is just so trash like basically insta down cuz I walk somewhere I'm always so paranoid against trapper every pallet I'm suspicious every window every nook and cranny I get cautious. Please trapper go easy on me
---
NoED bad. Adrenaline bad. Stranger things good. Ooga booga
---
*This is what I was thinking noises*
---
To be fair, by your explanation you tunneled him after his first hook, which is scum (and against good survivors isn‚Äôt a smart strategy. Against good survivors the healthy survivor would just get back on a gen. If you go for the healthy survivor, the injured survivor will heal instead of working on objectives, wasting time).
---
Otherwise yes he‚Äôs dumb and you wasted a lot of time
---
My hours are currently around the 2300 mark. (although a bunch of that is me sitting on the menu watching Hybrid Panda/Monto videos or falling asleep and accidentally leaving the game on)
---
I tend to grind the \*\*Heck\*\* outta Double BP events.
---
It's even worse on mobile.One time when I stepped on the trap, I got jumped so hard and completely lost track of where I was going.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem toxic/rapey enough
---
&gt; but if you're expecting like a true quadrupedal werewolf monster
---
I don't think anyone who has ever asked for a werewolf killer is asking for a big four legged wolf. When people think of a "werewolf" they tend to think of the humanoid ones who, at most, might do a sort of all fours sprint with their arms, but that isn't really being quadrupedal.
---
thank you!
---
Yea
---
thank you so much!
---
I love dbd, and i also love vine
---
I'm with you OP, werewolves are fuckin' rad and I hope we get one eventually.
---
I've been playing this game for a year and a half. At first it was no big deal. But it got so consistent, one after the other. You're damned if you win, damned if you lose. You're always a camper or a tunneler, you're always a trash killer, all your perks are trash and all their perks are sent by god itself. kys, uninstall, so on and so forth. Day in and day out. Kinda chips away at you 'til you're raw.
---
Maybe I do need a break. But I've always believed that this community did have a problem with abusing each other. It's like politics if you're maining either survivor or a killer - Everything they do is bad and wrong, and you're in the right and just. Trying to think of other games with similar situations.
---
Yea gonna just say that neither of you are coming off fantastic here.
---
This makes me cringe so bad. Makes me cringe but not as mich then looking at furries in baby diapers or fat dudes in furry onesies in person(will never forget that moment)
---
Second for sure. First one you can always go back and get your medkit
---
Actually she runs the same speed as you
---
She just walks slower than you run
---
Yeah? And infectious fright also works the second you down a person
---
Actually I agree yeah swap it out, I‚Äôm using self care until the new Nancy Dre perk gets released

---
Like others have said, because they can't admit they did wrong and because they have the strong belief in the "killer's handbook" about what killers are and aren't allowed to do.
---
Example, the other day I had a coldwind map as huntress, I'd hooked almost everyone but a Blendette. I repeatedly and pointedly ignored a Nea on death hook to draw the Blendette out by slugging the Nea.
---
Finally, I had the Blendette, downed them... And they DC'd. I gave Nea the hatch (I used them as bait, I'm nice) and game ended. In post-game the Blendette said that that should teach me to not slug and that I don't deserve my BBQ stack or to win the game.
---
Like... They spent 10-20 minutes in a match, then DC and lose all those BP for no reason other than me slugging a Nea. I also pipped from the match (which I don't want) - so ultimately I only got 75% extra bloodpoints, a pip, and a 2k and she got... Nothing.
---
There's just... A lot of survivors that take the competitive aspect of a party game too seriously.
---
The link doesn‚Äôt work
---
Hold on minute
---
Man up bro
---
Prove Thyself is actually trash though. At most it saves 4/5/6 seconds with 2/3/4 survivors on a gen.
---
Hold on
---
Invader Zim! (Also ST) but... Invader Zim!
---
I‚Äôm stealing lmao
---
Okay, looking back I have twelve prestiges counting both killer and survivor. But still damn, the grind in this game is tough.
---
I'm gonna be at a fuckin comic Con that entire time I'm upset
---
That‚Äôs the fun part about headcannon. It doesn‚Äôt need logic and continuity cause it‚Äôs all in my head to make up, lol.
---
Exactly but am I allowed to run noed it's like remake he had a basement people who entered died and never got out
---
Fixated only makes their walking faster if they're Healthy.
---
Good thing there's talk of lessening the grind with the new chapter too. :D

---
I‚Äôd say first one. Second one sucks but at least they might break dull totems and prevent NOED
---
As a hag main, it‚Äôs always satisfying to get downs like this :D
---
Thank you for your insight. I'll take this suggestion to heart and do better in the future.
---
Its there now
---
Go ahead lmao ‚ù§
---
Its there
---
That's what I'm saying. Either adapt with your character or just give the fuck up and play nurse because as broken as anything on the survivor side may be the best survivors stand no chance against the best nurse.
---
Hell, that‚Äôs what I did with my Nurse. Wanted to make sure she was in working order before I took her out for a spin- and man was it worth it
---
We are here to serve.
---
You act like running a good killer is easy. Try surviving for more than 1 gen against a nurse, spirit etc. You act like survivors can just choose to survive if they want to and if they go down their just bad. The 'rules' as you say are just unspoken 'good manners.' A good player wouldn't need to tunnel or camp as they apply pressure through their skill at getting downs. In the end it comes down to having good manners and not sacrificing multiple peoples enjoyment at the game to get a 4k. Its just called empathy dude, would you enjoy being tunneled?
---
Playing against the hag for the first time is the best experience ever, you just are just walking around casually and suddenly a phantasm scares the heck out of you. Then you think that they are fake when suddenly... the hag teleports and smacks you
---
Imagine tunneling rank 20s.
---
I believe you mean the Campers?
---
Yeah, I've seen the bloodweb changes they've been talking about. Also the bloodhunt coming up on September 5th!

It's not just this community. It's pretty shitty in all multiplayer games. Especially FPS. I've been called racial, homophobic and religious slurs since I started playing these game and it still happens. You damned if you do and damned if you don't. 
---
So I say, F them if they can't take a joke and F them if they can. I'm not going to let someone who I will probably never play against again ruin my day ‚Ä¶ and if I do, then there is a GOD!
---
I've been playing for over 2 years across three platforms. When one platform gets bad, I switch and then when it just gets frustrating I take a break for a week or so. It really does help.
---
Not if the rest of the team has been doing gens and has the first 3 done before the survivor on hook dies, camping/tunneling is a shit strategy and only shit survivors die to it.
---
You shoulda picked it up and ran in a locker so the killer couldn‚Äôt hit you.

That honestly makes me disappointed but I mean Freddy does have the z block making survivors bleed even when no injured so technically it still works against fixated?
---
i‚Äôve actually done this before. i‚Äôll change my mind about a using a key but forget to change my offering
---
Ruin is good on literally _every_ Killer. It creates a secondary objective -- find the Hex Totem, or else suffer the consequences of slower generators. And what good does having a secondary objective/slowing generators do? It allows the Killer to build pressure. Every Killer needs to exert pressure on the Survivor team in order to stop them from completing their objective. Some are better at exerting pressure than others, like Hillbilly vs. Clown, but no matter how powerful a Killer is, more time to start pressuring the Survivors is valuable.
---
Well Make it is pretty underrated. Bond Maybe 
---
Self Care is pretty overrated
---
The reason why this happens so often for freddy is because during the swing animation, they stretch his claws out forward.
---
 He doesn't have a weapon and only uses his arm, and he's not a very big guy, so they did it to make his lunge range on par with the other killers.
---
As a result, his claws move farther out from the actual collision of the model, allowing him some of these cheeky hits.
---
Wait were dose ghost face go
---
And do the plague and huntress or the clown and nurse fight since they are in the same realm
---
Idk I think it‚Äôs I good feature every online game should have just leave early before people start talking shit who cares, don‚Äôt be such a snowflake
---
Super bait
---
Feels straight out of a movie or something.
---
The fuck you cant.
---
I'd say even after that is the even better tracking perk, Plague's Infectious Fright. It's insane for snowballing pressure with Killers that can down quickly like Hillbilly or Nurse.
---
Me: "Everyone's really horrible to each other and abusing the chat regularly."
---
You: "haha you're oversensitive"
---
^(yeah sure man I'm just a baby)
---
It reminds me of Kotal Kahn
---
I do, it helps in case the chainsaw takes too long.
---
Then that's just a rare situation where the survivor had the upper hand.  If that Freddy had blood pools instead of pallets that survivor would have died.
---
enjoy your 50k karma. This sub gets fuckin super horny for this shit.
---
Not without messaging each individual person. Sometimes you can‚Äôt message them without adding them cause of their settings.
---
Yup tunneling is honestly not bad it only makes sense as a killer to get to 3 v 1 as soon as possible. However this is easily punishable by people gen-rushing or DS. Camping, though, is so dumb and a result of poor game design. It does not make sense for a killer to be able to just wait for someone to farm and then get an auto-kill, that requires no skill or effort and keeps the survivor from playing the game. BT should have been built in-to survivors to counter this, but bad killers will cry if they do it now.
---
can we have roadhog as a killer
---
For Legion: I would say perks like Discordance or Surveilance are pretty good, since it give you information. I always try to use addons that extend the power or Irridescent button. 
---
For Freddy: BBQ is amazing on new Freddy. Always place dream snares at choke points(kinda like traps for Trapper). If you use Dream Pallets, be smart with the placement.
---
Definitely get Corrupt Intervention, buys a lot of time for killers
---
As a former fan of Drag Race and a new fan to JoJo nothing sees my skin crawl like all the forced references to them all over Reddit
---
As a killer and as a survie I can just walk around and soundwhore for the hatch.
---
Doctor can by fun you p3 claudette
---
Cannot get into any lobbies as a survivor or start a game as killer. Just stays on "searching for a match". Platform: PS4.
---
I agree. Nearly every Killer daily is just something that would happen from playing that Killer like Nurse's Blink hit or Legion's Frenzy.
---
Kotal Kahn is basically if Outworld had Aztecs there.
---
I got bitched out for going after a Meg after she got unhooked. It was right behind me so I turned and saw a Meg running away not hurt so I assumed that was the one that did the save(game had 3 bloody Megs). Downed them, hooked them, they let themself go just to BM me endgame saying I tunneled. 
---
It was literally an instaheal they brought themself. Bruh you literally caused your own demise.
---
I've literally only played as a killer 15 times
---
Appreciate the jojo shit in r/deadbydaylight so much
---
I hate those kind of ppl
---
Most of the time tunneling comes from a survivor looking to farm you and will do it right in front of the killer. I used to get mad when they downed me until I realized he took away his safe hook points. Some survivors are just assholes.
---
Imagine getting so triggered that you say duck instead of fuck.
---
Show us
---
Survivors like you are why I don't hook on 1st catch anymore lol. I be getting bad
---
Handyman and Medic too.
---
Imagine getting so triggered that you say duck instead of fuck, such a small brain mistake lol
---
Nice
---
That‚Äôs reportable for holding the game hostage.
---
r/Oinkers
---
It's literally the same as everyone else's. You're just experiencing selection bias
---
So every killer is what you guys mean. I only said the spirit because all you can do is take it up the ass, or hope they're bad. Legion and doc arent really that bad.
---
Aight that's my build rn
---
That only makes it better
---
So can every other killer because they pretty much all have the same lunge
---
Make the game not suck
---
Anyone who posts non jojo template memes are enemies of passione and have no dignity
---
Not sure if there's an official answer but I think they could have their own separate areas that the entity creates for them
---
Do you truly read what I wrote and believe I am 100% meaning (in a literal sense) what was typed? 
---
I‚Äôm just curious, I thought it was pretty clearly a joke.
---
What‚Äôs with the cringe-talk?
---
Now I just picture ghostface wandering around realms pissing people off
---
I was in this trial, where's my credit bitch??
---
I never hear anyone talk about Bond.
---
These are the same people that bitch about getting hit through pallets. Like just because you hit space doesn't mean you are now completely invincible. The pallet actually has to fall to cancel the Killer's attack and stun them. If it hasn't hit them yet then they are going to hit you if their hitbox connects with your hurtbox.
---
Some of these will be from the survivor PoV because i wasn't recording at the time:  
---
So [Here](https://www.twitch.tv/rebmaa/clip/AntediluvianArbitraryTubersPhilosoraptor?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) is a truck shot - if you slow it down you can see the hatchet actually morph through the top of the truck allowing hits like that to happen.  
---
You can also do it at pallets like [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/AmericanSassyOpossumKappaClaus) \- Notice how it goes through the top of the pallet and because he is working on the gen the hitbox is a bit wonky.  
---
[This](https://clips.twitch.tv/CourteousWittyDaikonDancingBanana) one isn't AS severe but the only reason i hit that was because theres a certain angle you can take and instead of actually hitting a random hitbox from the object it will ignore the very tip of it and again allow for some pretty hectic shots.
---
I mean... we all knew this was how it was gonna end
---
"Am I wrong? No, it's the devs who are wrong."
---
his teammates activated the trap as they saved him, allowing me to hit him before he had a chance to even get away (aka I hit him the moment he got off, the healthy guy will escape sure, but he‚Äôs down 2 hooks as a result meaning I will have less survivors... and then the raptor scenario began with them not doing anything but try to reach him and baiting me.)
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt care too much about rank or points I can spend, I just play how I want because it‚Äôs fun (a main reason most should have anyway, no offense to anyone who plays for competitive reasons. I respect other‚Äôs reasons for playing)
---
And yeah I‚Äôm gonna punish him for bad teammates. What am I supposed to do, let him get away? That‚Äôs a survivor honor rule... I don‚Äôt follow those unless I want to, it isn‚Äôt a reportable offense to tunnel anyway (same with camping and bodyblocking).
---
Example being a bad team goes down fast, no gens done, one guy left and they stop struggling on my back or the hatch is nearby, I‚Äôll bring them to the hatch or I message them to do gens until they find the hatch or the gates are powered and I let them escape.
---
Another example 
---
Got off the hook yourself and I‚Äôm nearby because you did it prematurely? Back up ya go!
---
You had a 40m conversation with him because you entertained him for 40m. You didn't have to do that.
---
Full Auto Jacqui = Claudette
---
Cigarette man is the only thing that can kill the killers. That cigarette falls out of his mouth and he becomes a black whole and consumes everything. Including the Entity.
---
Hook someone look around for a few seconds to see where an aura is and go to that spot. 
---
If you don‚Äôt see anyone they are either in a closet or close by.
---
Dead hard easy choice.
---
Huntress is so easy to hide from tf?  Just crouch around the pallet loop and she can't hit you.
---
Ah yes it's time for the annual posting of this meme
---
Tbh I had enough of people constantly insulting me for just playing hag with traps effectively and running into teams that wouldn‚Äôt stop trying to rescue the moment someone is hooked and bait me today is all.
---
You don‚Äôt know if there is devour hope untill it‚Äôs too late.
---
Thats what happens when you just use a random offering or its to scare the killer lol
---
Then she just catches up to you and M1s you
---
You also can't explain about losing if you run corrupt intervention
---
Not only is Dead Hard a better perk, but getting it maxed out removes it from the perk pool, meaning that you have a high chance of getting more of the perks that you actually want.
---
On mobile? I'm sorry what the absolute fuck
---
More so because his stance is hunched back
---
So are you suggesting that they change the background and description to a simple "pick another killer if you want to win"?
---
Did you at any point believe that you'd be able to play a band of killers at the same time based on the description?
---
This post just sounds like a butthurt rant.
---
literally exactly the same
---
She is hella slow during wind up and ypu can sprint when she stops.  I don't get it.  Maybe I just face garbage huntresses
---
He escaped, so the strategy clearly worked.
---
Its a grey toolbox you uncultured swine
---
IT'S BASEMENT TIME! BTW nice drawing skills.
---
Because it can be toxic.  This is only speculation one way or the other.  I'm my personal experience only a Freddy has done this to me, and he does it anytime I'm the last.
---
Run bond, make them participate.
---
Have you heard of a joke?
---
Rusty shackles gives so many grabs off gens and totems it is unreal.
---
Give it a week or two, you'll quickly learn that Survivors call everything the killer does toxic. I'd take none of it to heart if i were you.
---
Why is this coment section using 101% of theyre brain?
---
Im not great at looping killers to begin with, I usually play stealthy and do gens unless I feel like using a big dick build so most of my points come from survival and objective
---
Reporting doesn‚Äôt do anything. This happens to me 3 out of 4 matches with ghost face (with him t bagging) and fairly often if I somehow managed to loop the killer long enough. I always report if they rage quit or if they do the whole letting the collapse kill me (since it counts as sacrifice)
---
Yeah I know I get plenty of unfair feeling hits as killer
---
By the amount of downvotes you‚Äôre getting, you should realize the majority (if not all) disagree with you, ALONG with the developers. They‚Äôve come up with these new perks to combat killers like you. The game is tilted in the killer‚Äôs favor, whether you admit it or not (which you should, consider you‚Äôve admitted to abusing the so-called ‚Äòstrategies‚Äô of tunneling &amp; camping), if the killer chooses to tunnel or camp. Borrowed Time can sometimes save the survivors from the inevitable loss against tunnelers &amp; campers, but a lot of the time it has proven to be nearly ineffective against such killers (like you, apparently).
---
In my own personal experience, getting 3 kills or 4 kills is MUCH more satisfying if I DO NOT camp or tunnel, plus the added bonus of an actually decent amount of bloodpoints at the end. Why is that? Because I actually played the game the way that it was designed to be played. (You can‚Äôt argue with that, since the developers have literally just announced several perks to combat tunneling and camping killers like you.) In the end, I actually feel like I accomplished something, and that I can actually outplay survivors, not just get 4 free kills one after the other. I actually feel good at the game.
---
No, you‚Äôre not there to entertain me or the other survivors, and no, I‚Äôm not there to entertain you. If you don‚Äôt like the perks they‚Äôre releasing to combat YOUR toxic tactics, then YOU can stop playing. YOU‚ÄôRE the reason they‚Äôre being released anyway: to make the game fun for EVERYONE.
---
Good luck when this DLC comes out, dude. Just hope you get noobs every time, because I can‚Äôt imagine a killer like you doing so well after this unless you change your tactics.
---
As we should. 
---
Karmic justice is oh so sweet.
---
You‚Äôre allowed if you ask me! they‚Äôre the cat, you‚Äôre the curiosity. You gamble on that cat getting curious. If they don‚Äôt, oh well. That hurts you but not them and you aren‚Äôt playing cheap... now if they fall for curiosity well... it‚Äôs certainly their fault! They chose to go down stairs and if their team is altruistic it‚Äôs their choice to risk their hair!
---
You forget about Tier 3 Michael he has the lunge to end all lunges
---
Odd bulb is a waste of an add on so that‚Äôs on you
---
It‚Äôs not even that getting hit through stuff is annoying, it‚Äôs that the animations don‚Äôt match up. Like when you get hit through a pallet when you‚Äôre injured, you start to fall to the ground like you would if you were downed, then your character stands back up, drops the pallet and then falls again. It‚Äôs just absurd, same as through the window. Sure, if bhvr say you can hit through them then you can hit through them, but his arm was nowhere near her. That‚Äôs the frustrating part, there‚Äôs no consistency at all, sometimes they will hit, sometimes they won‚Äôt but it never looks like it should
---
Meh, it would be dumber to see him ignore his own traps. Besides, a good trapper doesn‚Äôt step in his own trap and it doesn‚Äôt cost him any time. I do think he needs to carry at least 2 traps by default and be able to rearm traps without placing another one down though
---
How convincing.
---
You're allowed to do anything you want. If you want to camp people camp the shit out of them, it just isn't going to make you a better player. Just make sure you turn off the post game chat.
---
But in the video he's clearly playing around DS. It's dumb as hell to call what he's doing toxic.
---
Ime surprised it wasnot clown
---
As a killer main I see where you‚Äôre coming from but I guess we have different viewpoints... maybe because of your low play time(assuming, due to your personal best rank and the way you describe perks), but to me just getting a 4k isn‚Äôt fun. The fun part of the game is chasing and outplaying others, not just instantly downing people because they have stupid teammates that were forced onto them. It‚Äôs the same reason I dont run NOED, because I get zero satisfaction from knowing that I wasn‚Äôt able to kill people all game, but was able to get a kill or two at the end from a perk that arguably is not balanced. 
---
Similarly to how tunneling isn‚Äôt a bannable offense, neither is running green and red addons which you thought was worth mentioning in your post. With parallel logic, I included tunneling in my reply. Of course it‚Äôs not bannable, and I never suggested it was, all I suggested is that it‚Äôs a scummy way to play.
---
Your last example really makes no sense. Somebody jumping off the hook while you‚Äôre nearby is of their own control and should be punished. In my opinion(and most others), being farmed by a teammate shouldn‚Äôt be punished by killers because it‚Äôs out of the person on the hooks control. By focusing the person from the hook you basically give his toxic teammate exactly what they want, and in turn encourages them to continue the toxic behavior. 
---
But ultimately you can do whatever you want, I just wouldn‚Äôt go running around Reddit acting like this guy was so in the wrong when you weren‚Äôt any better yourself.
---
name checks out
---
Yeah that happened
---
Not for me, but it's nice for people who have phones.
---
One question: what's your point? I literally don't get why you told me all that. How is how your game went and what you talked about in post-game relevant to the community at all?
---
There should be an option to turn chat on or off whenever you want and it stays that way until you change it yourself. (I‚Äôm on Xbox so I got the easy way out)
---
Ummm , Steve's gonna be 1080 auric ceels I think
---
To be real here I doubt anyone really cares and you basically played yourself by engaging in a 40 minute long convo just to swap salt with some guy...
---
Just move on
---
Why would he?
---
I'm a console player so I can't say anything about nurse but Hag and Billy are the most unfun imo
---
The movie came first, and also you never would know what the pig actually looked like if you only played DBD
---
I've never seen it before, and had a good laugh.
---
He‚Äôs playing Legion. Did you expect them to play fair?
---
You won't buy the Scoops ahoy skin ?
---
You might wanna spend some, we have a double bp event coming before they come out anyhow
---
I have seen waaayyyyy too many ppl on PS4 who have random messages set to off so that they don't recieve messages.
---
Probably because of toxicity.
---
when they cleanse all the totems and your noed doesn‚Äôt trigger
---
A lot of rumors are hinting at this dlc being more expensive overall
---
I keep grudges dude
---
Bad grudges
---
Really bad grudges
---
We‚Äôre talking ‚Äúfantasizing about ripping the flesh from their feet and making them stomp on hot coal for an entire day‚Äù grudges that last years.
---
There are a few animations on youtube, but only a spare few.
---
No but i do want it badly
---
ET next killer
---
Dude same. Add me. Varsity kaox. Just shoot me a message we can play.
---
Currently rank 12 survivor and rank 11 killer. 
---
I find playing killer way easier. Hard to rank up fast with derp teammates. Feels like solo q in league
---
Even just seperate characters?
---
This is a reminder why you should just said "gg ez" and that's it after post game chat. Thanks bro
---
Usually it‚Äôs the people with the smallest brains that pull the ‚Äòit‚Äôs just your opinion‚Äô meme. It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôre too stupid to really address the claim at hand. Sorry that you‚Äôre triggered by truth, but facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings.
---
Most likely spirit she can travel fast and hear the hatch and if survivors are opening the gate
---
Its about 20 seconds into [this video](https://youtu.be/iGqZ4yqkpB8).
---
You've probably never played killer. Or at least have never made it to rank 1 or even red ranks
---
This deserves to be higher
---
Well I'm glad to be of service to ya.
---
Kaballin
---
k well spend less time on dead by daylight and more time in therapy
---
Seems more like you got unlucky and he got laggy but its hard to tell
---
he didn‚Äôt lag at all that game and had green ping it was sus asl. also i was sitting there for a while so he had time
---
Well I never doubted it demogorgan is pretty humanoid we might see more in the future but I think they will stick to their humanoid rule
---
Who knows how sensitive the demogorgon's sensory organs are? It can smell blood in another dimension, that's gotta be pretty dam sensitive.
---
Tunneling, to me at least, is when you only go after one survivor for, like, minutes at a time. Survivors who bitch about being tunneled because you chased them for .5 microseconds are just babies.
---
I legit started playing last week. Was so happy to see BBQ and chili. I was just about to buy bubba. 
---
It took so long to grind out ruin so im happy to save a lot of time lol
---
As of rn i would wait it out. Bloodwebs are getting a change v soon. Stick to focusing on getting bloodwebs to any characters u like to level 39 and wait it out bc the new blood webs allow u to get 2 of 3 perks now if done correct. 
---
As me, id take off one perk of blood tracking so prolly bloodhound and replace it with enduring once u get it and keep spirit fury. Pallets are a much bigger problem then followinf survivors while phasing
---
Any doc that tries to stop gen progression. People call it "hostage" doc because they can't bust out gens in 4-5 minutes so they get mad they have to play longer
---
how about everyone get a fair chance. kid on the hook has none
---
Just as an FYI it ain't camping if we know you're right there. I've had people bitch at me for "camping" when I could literally see them 5ft from the hooked survivor. Like, no Claudette, I'm not just going to let you unhook someone that easy.
---
I‚Äôve gotten this glitch a nea thought I was hacking I was so confused why I was running faster then the killer the killer believed me though which was nice
---
Yeah, there was a popular post about it yesterday. It's probably to do with rights and this being the biggest chapter to date.
---
Well for rank 15 ish is it okay not to have endurance? They kinda don‚Äôt loop really. Also Idk what character to level up l, but I think I will go for hag
---
Didn't look like the last two dudes got out....
---
They did . I just escaped before them .
---
Yes.
---
Whats wrong with this?  3 new players forgot to equip their rank 1 starting perk?
---
Looks pretty typical.  Congrats on your escape?
---
Cursed
---
Everyone gangsta till you get krushing blowed
---
I mean yeah. U do u bro. That sounds like a plan but its best to wait before the bloodweb update yk? Itll be easier to get all the perks u want
---
I'm not saying it was ever canonically in the actual lore, but I thought maybe their internal, non-published ideas for the lore were the driving force behind that.
---
What will people be spending on? Other than saving for Stranger Things obviously! 
---
I'll be getting everyone to 39 in advance of blooded rework!
---
If you're gonna be a Hillbilly main, you wont need that thrill eventually. You'll just grow a "Billy Sense" as i call it.
---
Welcome to the internet man, if you don‚Äôt salty people in chat leave early, if you won‚Äôt leave early don‚Äôt play. Easy
---
I played a match earlier where a Kate was able to keep doing this, every time I got close enough for a hit she would get a random speed boost
---
BHVR should nerf Australia , it's too OP .
---
Then yeah, that makes sense.
---
I don't often get much into the logistics of the game, just learn the perks, and use em.
---
I appreciate you informing me though, now I know for the future. Thank you.
---
I agree people are a little too sensitive, just because people don‚Äôt like that you did well or siding doesn‚Äôt mean you gotta make a reddit post about it, now op just gave trolls more power lmao
---
This is bullshit as no one knows what Dwight's face looks when Myers gets Tier 3 because we can't see inside a locker  ‚Ä¶ gg
---
Oh no, I meant the two rank 12s and the rest are 20.
---
Of course. Nor is it camping when the gates are open.
---
Been playing ever since dbd came out on ps4, main both killer and survivor. Being scummy works on both sides, made it to rank 2 multiple times. You can win without being scummy, and you‚Äôre fully allowed to play how you want. I just want everyone to have a genuine friendly game
---
Bing bong meets boop
---
Spirit‚Äôs fun to verse
---
For $24 that mask better be real metal.
---
I'll be saving my BPs for Stranger Things and getting everyone to 39 if possible in preparation for the blooded rework!
---
What will you be doing?
---
ITT: Spirit Plague Leafherface Hag Doctor Nurse are all unfun to play against. Let‚Äôs just go back to three killers, huh guys? üôÑ
---
What the fuck
---
I guess Wraith doesn't know you can close the hatch lol
---
He was a whole baby killer during the entire game
---
And for solo play it makes it near impossible to make sure all totems are clensed. A counter would be great
---
The thing is, my internet (don't really know why) was mostly going down while in a chase
---
Probably on Tuesday... Or the Tuesday after
---
Can someone provide a link to the official announcement? The wiki isn't official. Not saying its not accurate, I just want to see where they are getting this from other than the wiki.
---
I can tell that you're green ranks and deserve to be there since any decent red rank player would know that not true.
---
Some day between now and the official release.
---
Yeah, i confirm what bloody billie said. You can't ever pass the 1 million bloodpoints limit. Many players save shards and dailies to get some more bloodpoints. When you complete a daily for example, until you click on it you don't get the daily bloodpoints, in this way you can decide which is the best moment to get them. Plus that "refund" over 1 million bloodpoints where they give you back bloodpoints basing upon your playing time in case your profile got corrupted and you lose everything doesn't happen anymore, since when they moved every player profiles on their servers. Like this they can backup every data and always provide a consistent version of your profile, before no one was backuping their data or worring about it (of course, it's not something that a game user should worry about).
---
It's practically impossible on solo, even more if your team doesn't do gens forcing you to.
---
SOMEONE GETS IT! *here's some karma*
---
or the tuesday after tuesday....
---
Imagine making fun of someone who actually does have a brain injury. No brain mistake lol.
---
The fact of the matter is you‚Äôre the one triggered about a video game update.
---
Perfect. 10/10
---
People say Dead Hard and it's true that it's a very good perk, but the difference of rank 2 to 3 isnt really much. If you wanted distortion, I hope you got it.
---
*They'd better fucking not*
---
WTF BB
---
Sounds like you're one of those killers who go from a 0k to 2k cus of noed
---
That‚Äôs the best video I‚Äôve ever seen lmao
---
That's mostly their end when in the chase, because it's a peer to peer system right now. Once dedicated servers are up and running the players with bad connections will be found out much easier.
---
I do not think anyone cares that much to be honest lol
---
Speaking of tunneling and camping, I‚Äôm not gonna apologize for ‚Äútunneling‚Äù when I can visibly see you get unhooked and it‚Äôs an easy down and I‚Äôm not gonna apologize for ‚Äúcamping‚Äù when I know there someone near the hook that I don‚Äôt want to give a free save to
---
You literally chose a real person who has drugged men to steal from them as a ‚Äúclear winner‚Äù over a fictional character...... I think you need to be concerned over other things rather than ‚Äúboobs‚Äù and video games in  general.
---
For the health of the game, please consider adding a permanent toggle. It can still default to being on, but I am *very* concerned about how big of an impact this is having on player retention.
---
The current UI button for hiding the chat is not obvious enough, I find many people do not recognize what it is or does without having it pointed out to them after they see help dealing with the harassment. Additionally, by the time the end game screen loads in, the messages are already there and the damage is done. Hiding it manually is simply too slow for people that want to avoid it.
---
The current method people are using to hide it automatically is, of course, also not acceptable. It must be an in-game option, preferably one that is mentioned in the tutorial somewhere or pointed out to new players somehow.
---
Please, at least look into collecting data on how it is affecting player retention. This is my favorite game, ever, and I do not want to see it die a slow death because it's too abrasive to retain any players.
---
Hag is actually pretty good, but most importantly she's really fun to plan. If you enjoy her there's nothing wrong with sticking with her.
---
This guy would get schooled by red ranks
---
Oh. Well, thanks for the information
---
Your brain injury shows. I‚Äôm not triggered at all; I‚Äôm calm and collected, but unfortunately your damaged brain makes you unable to see that. I‚Äôll sit here and still be correct as you sit there with your broken brain and rot.
---
There have been a few posts about it so far. Most people on here were already playing on PC or console already though and don't care to play the mobile version when they already play and have progress on the real one, so not very many people are posting about it.
---
the joke I tried to make was funnier in my head....
---
Like Skyrim
---
Youer the best drawerer I ever had seen I want u too drawe me plaese
---
Nurse is my favorite to go against. The mind games with LoS are really fun, somilar with spirit's phase. The killers who fuck up normal looping are so much more fun to go against imo
---
I've seen the fortnight demogorgon on this subreddit many times but this is the first time I've noticed that this thing has not skipped leg day. This chapter is going to be horrifying.
---
When that bug was still a thing.
---
Yeah, i am always so mad, seeing all 3 survivors crouching around the hook the entire time i'm being camped, doing nothing.
---
Insidious camp the hatch, then close it when the survivor shows up.
---
Have you seen this guy's post history? When it comes to this sub, it seems he's just a troll. I don't know why he's still around; maybe the mods haven't caught on to him yet.
---
Yeah that's a pretty good setup too because youd get a ton of really good add-ons for other items
---
really xD
---
What perks?
---
Spirit is one of the funnest to go against, mind gaming her phasing is fun, seeing her get all confused and shit, there's so much more to her than the basic m1 loop chases
---
Wow I was so expecting legion to get knocked down but ok
---
Stabby oinks
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cv5nv2/intro_to_dead_by_daylight/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
A fisherman killer like the I know what you did last summer killer with a raincoat and hook
---
How does one acquire this device
---
It's because you can only get it on specific app stores and it also doesn't work.
---
Trifling gnomes...
---
It's actually my favourite Nightmare movie. It has so many iconic kills and moments and it basically established Freddy's character.
---
Make your choice, Barbecue and chili(get it on the shrine right now), overcharge, Hex:ruin
---
You understand the plight, all these other killers don't know what it's like to try and get a 4k with only one shoe on. I wore my prettiest red dress for those survivors and all they do is run and disassemble my bone babies.
---
I have a set of these.
---
It's Wish, so it will probably be made of tinfoil...
---
Most likely you were not matched with Franklin's Hag, but killer reacted to your items in lobby. If I see particularly sketchy item combination in lobby, I will often try and fit Franklin's into my loadout.
---
It really do be like that.
---
You just described how most high rank games go. You don't want to Gen-Rush a Killer? Then don't, because it's honestly out fo most Killers hands.
---
Wait, so you get to keep whatever was in your hand when you die?
---
That's because of the secret passive of deliverance. It increases your chance to be found first by 90%. Ah sorry, no percent. I mean tremendously
---
Then why can't we just have the Meg/Quentin/Ash mains to protect baby Steve/Nancy after all ?
---
Because FortNite
---
I ship it. Just cuz i like Sombra‚Äôs kit and wanna main her and I used to main Wraith
---
Considering the babysitter perk I'd bet pretty high. \^u\^
---
Welp fuck forthight
---
Sneak King needs to be able to crouch. I vote Amanda, as you could re-skin the RBTs to be delicious whoppers, and the key boxes as comfortable booths in which to sit down and eat your whopper. But sometimes you find something sticky on the table, or some gum under it, and you have to move to a different booth.
---
Nice.
---
Squiggle my wiggle
---
Calm down, man. He was joking too.
---
rework was a complete success for BHVR. hes no longer a problem for survivors, and he wasnt interesting enough previously/out long enough for a significant enough amount of killers to be butthurt about not being able to play him anymore. I wouldn't expect a legion rework for another 2 years minimum. Yeah he sucks now, but hes barely less relevant than plague or bubba so.
---
Let the Fans Decide [http://www.strawpoll.me/18535331](http://www.strawpoll.me/18535331)
---
You just have to level her up until you see the perk
---
I wouldn't say I main hag, but I play her just as much as other killers. Depending on how the demigorgon turns out that might change. Her, nurse, spirit, and maybe huntress, are the only killers that play completely differently.
---
It'll show up in the bloodweb at random.
---
If you need to equip head on, decisive, and inner strength just to do this, that‚Äôs 3 of 4 slots. So they can only choose one of the meta perks like adrenaline, borrowed time, self-care, etc. I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs a problem. People complain constantly about survivors using the same over powered meta perks, but will also complain about this potential usage of perks of which you can likely only use at most twice a match....so pick your battles.
---
Well, that's the thing, I do not seek adding blood or a glowing effect on my clothes is worth losing my collection of perks and hoards of items and offerings. Especially those that I almost or absolutely never use.
---
It is now able to spawn in the other survivors bloodwebs. If you keep leveling her up, you will see it eventually. You get random perks at every level, so it might take a while.
---
‚ÄúiTs LiTeRaLly ThE sAMe aS EvERyoNE ELse‚ÄôS‚Äù 
---
Bitch? Have you seen spirit Lunge???
---
Legion sucks now
---
Unlocking the teachable just puts the perk in other character's blood web pool. You still have to unlock it on other characters.
---
$24 for a cheap snack? No thanks.
---
Yeah, him and Freddy are both pedos, Dwight just plays innocent. It's the perfect cover to get close to kids.
---
This perk, two more people, this is Borrowed Time 3, two more people, it would have given me two, or at least one, one more
---
oh ok.
---
Thx for the fast replies!
---
Blocking IPs with a 3rd party tool because of in-game actions is almost certainly ban-able. If it isn't, it should be.
---
Blocked
---
it doesnt touches ingame files neither steam...thus not bannable...so pls calm down :)
---
Damn it now I have to make an actual household and do thsi fuck
---
When I play strong or fun killers I can play until my hands start hurting but playing lower-tier M1 killers feels like Entity sucking hope out of me
---
Nah, the only counterplay to her is guessing. You see her stand still? Guess whats she's gonna do. She make your move and you either get hit or you dont. And once you do get hit, you're dead.
---
Because he almost doesn't admit he fucks up?
---
You're playing a meh killer that only has 2 perks on, and you are most likely going against a SWF with a red rank. I doubt it was really on you.
---
Oh, yeah, that‚Äôs probably true. But I thought you were saying it‚Äôs bannable to use 3rd party software period, hence my response. 
---
I play on console anyway so I don‚Äôt have access to MLGA and only know what I hear on streams.
---
You can literally hook someone, down someone else, hook them, find the first person and still get hit with DS. It is most certainly not just a anti tunnel perk. And off topic but btw, tunneling is obviously a strat. Do you want me to give up an easy chase to hook each of you three times? That‚Äôs 12 hooks. Twenty hits, minimum.
---
I probably could‚Äôve played that game better
---
Spirit is really close to A tier, Plag's mori is supposed to be serious, but its really over the top. If she had corrupt puke, or [if she kissed a survivor just to puke in him](/s), that would easily be S-tier
---
He's level 46, I think the title was /s
---
Dang imange you went to go get it and it's a bubba chest protecter
---
Forgive me lord, for what im about to do.
---
Cwoke me with youw biwg BIWG fwashwight daddy\~ UwU 
---
:C
---
Yea we can tell
---
lowkey nurse looks hot
---
Presenting the new killer: **THE MOONMAN**
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I remember his yesterday stream where he fucked up and said ‚ÄúFuck, i fucked that up‚Äù. Hmm, questionable.
---
&gt;He's level 46, I think the title was /s
---
I really agree
---
lol
---
Most of the times he doesn't say anything. Anyways, gg
---
That's a different story. The actual lunge is the same, however, when Rin comes out of the ability, she gets a short speed boost, like wraith.
---
No dignity.
---
Amanda is already a good enough furry for this game.
---
Two's a crowd.
---
Holy shit that would be such a terrible change
---
Because people were always "YOU ARE A RPG DM. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS", "THEY ARE D&amp;D PLAYERS, YOU NEED TO WATCH BECAUSE OF IT."
---
I watched the first seasson on the weekend it was realesed, so, before the hype, and I thought it was an okay show that would soon be lost through the netflix catalog. And Monday all my friends were only talking about it and how it was a masterpiece. I was like "Yeah...I saw...It was okay...". And people went nuts because of it. They said that I couldn't be a geek if I had not enjoyed the that show praises so much old schooled geek symbols. So my "okay" turned to "dislike" just like that.
---
Ikr literally the same and after a bad match i keep telling myself that i don't care that i lost but i sometimes really do and i wanna fucking die after that.
---
We already suffer a constant debuff, "Heatstroke", do we really need another nerf? The british did it already.
---
This is me when I spawn next a gen and all the other survivors, but immediately sprint to the basement.
---
This soothes me. Please continue de-rasterizing things. Thank you.
---
I could start saving if BBQ would fucking show up already on my Freddy
---
Sombra from Overwatch. She can go invisible too and she can teleport.
---
He could have gained that level from mainly playing survivor. 
---
The title and the photo don't imply sarcasm.
---
Fuck Overwatch
---
So if she was essentially Poison Ivy from Batman she would be A Tier.
---
Inb4 Head On and with the new chapter, Inner Strenght
---
And here I am giving my tests while having 2000 BP in my account
---
She did the prayer and Entity answered. Now Adiris walks in the Fog, sacrificing anyone on her path to please the new God.
---
Can confirm
---
Even better because you're new and rank 17 - 18 and took out two rank 9 as well. Good job! :)
---
Looks like they have far longer than 1 second remaining for ds.
---
WULONGJUBALAYA YEEYEEBAIYEET TAIDON DISHU
---
The only thing this game needs is a xenomorph. *mike drop* I‚Äôm out.
---
It's just frustrating when trying to get a quick game in with mate, while wife is showering. Can only get one game in with loading and matching time, on the PS4
---
Second one is almost DC worthy. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been the first one found because I was the only one working on a generator. Then, when you get hooked and see all three teammates running around like mad staring at the ground?
---
Oh boy, might as well KYS on hook ‚Äòcause nothing‚Äôs gonna get done that round.
---
Finally a good DLC.
---
Great and well thought out criticism
---
Thanks
---
That's why I got the teachable. They'll never suspect 'ol Feng.
---
Surge is now the best anti-gen perk for people who don't like Ruin. It won't do too much slowing but it'll save so much time for you.
---
#  Time has been erased, return to cycle!
---
"Not if thr rest of the team" Yes, its about the team not the individual. I've died plenty of times to save others that were being camped because my teammates were cowards.
---
They missed a big opportunity to call mind breaker mind flayer
---
That's nice, but having scrolled through this thread, not a lot of those comments seem to be on here - just a lot of people stating what killers they find unfun to go against. Upon a second cursory glance, actually, (and by cursory glance I mean CTRL + F 'remove') really no one on this thread is talking about that, so you're pulling arguments out of your ass in order to defend yourself and it's not really working.
---
I‚Äôm talking about the fucking sub, bruh.
---
*MAN WITH A PLAN*
---
I mean, yeah. Ghostface' mori is inspired by a mortal kombat fatality, but it doesn't make it worse

---
People are saying that Steve is Quentin‚Äôs long lost brother and vice versa for Meg and Nancy, but why?
---
You‚Äôre in MY swamp now, bitch
---
considering the game is currently pair to pair, probably not a good idea unless you want survivors to leave your games instantly.
---
In little glass rooms, like in Cabin in the Woods?
---
Bootiful
---
I'm well aware of what you meant. Your initial comment seemed to suggest people **in this thread** were calling for the removal of certain killers because they're unfun. My first comment called you out on it because it's not true, and you know it's not true. I made one reference to the sub as a whole, which was 'we have more than two people in this sub', but every comment so far has been about the thread. Saying 'I meant the whole sub fucking obviously when I said I've seen countless comments asking for killers to be removed despite the fact that we've been talking about this thread specifically the entire time, so you're wrong' doesn't change the fact that you pulled the initial comment out of your ass lmfao
---
There‚Äôs dozens of us, I tell ya.
---
Ah another green hair nea 
---
Another nea of culture
---
I‚Äôll teach my kids self control over their emotions and teach them the only person that has control over their emotions is themselves, I‚Äôm sorry you have to play the victim instead of being proactive about it, and instead of promoting the game you are hurting the playerbase driving potential consumers away which is bad for business and no one at BVHR will thank you for it or nod at you.
---
Instead be the change you want to see instead of being petty.
---
What does that mean?
---
No it's not toxic. I assume you were worried about the survivor having DS, so you left him on the ground and went after the unhooker.
---
That's just playing the game, and if anything it's the unhookers fault. 
---
Think about it if you hadn't downed the survivor the unhooker would have gotten a safe hook rescue and possibly a stack of WGLF. Thus he would have been rewarded for playing stupid like this.
---
Deadass, I don't care about the rest of the sub. My issue is that you decided to boil all of these OPINIONS down to 'I guess we should remove all killers but three, then' and then you tried to use the whole sub as a defense when your first comment said ITT. I don't see any comments like that in this thread.
---
Hee hee
---
Thank you :) try my best to play as fair as possible so everyone can gain blood points and we all have fun still. Was very surprised seeing the rank 9's though.
---
Um, no, my first comment didn‚Äôt suggest that at all. I said people are complaining about a lot of killers. Then I sarcastically said we should go back to the three killers. Please show me where I said anyone else said they should be removed.
---
Cool story
---
No, the end screen shows what was brought into the match. So the guy used a white ward on a brown toolbox.
---
An update can fix that, Rocket league had the same problem and they fixed that.
---
We need spirit ngl
---
No it‚Äôs not. This game isn‚Äôt about 100% skill you doofus. Not like there are OP killers, not like killers are faster than survivors and you get tunneled and camped, nah uh, you‚Äôre dead? You‚Äôre automatically worse than the killer. Not like they have perks that show them where you are everytime you fucking touch something.
---
Fuck off and try not using this stupid meme to spit out ‚Äúfacts‚Äù when they are in reality, bullshit.
---
**flicks down legion
---
Perfect fucking game
---
Everyone is a cunt. Get over it.
---
Spirit should be easy to make. Just gotta send good ol‚Äô Rebecca to the closet and -uh oh! The door disappeared!
---
oh god I wish Plag kissed someone and puked inside them
---
Go for it üôèüëè
---
You do know it‚Äôs supposed to be funny, right?
---
You came into a thread talking about unfun killers knowing that people would be giving their opinion and then shat on them for giving their opinion and complaining about different killers, lmfao. 
---
My point still stands, lmfao, you falsely conflated people complaining and giving their opinion to wanting the killers removed. Don't come into a thread that you know is gonna be opinion-based and then go 'I guess we should go back to three killers b/c y'all wanna complain about the rest' when people give their opinions.
---
Maybe it's the caps lock that triggered the mods?
---
I‚Äôve lost multiple game and haddonfield offerings today. Man I just want to make sure all my landings are balanced and I cop killers who yeet outta there.
---
Lmfao, I didn‚Äôt, lmfao. But, lmfao, lets just agree, lmfao, to disagree, lmfao.
---
Yes it‚Äôs toxic , to make it fun for you and the survivors go for the guy that went for the save, trust man you will have more fun as a killer, will get more blood points, and overall will become as a great killer.:)
---
Cute. Thanks for giving up! &lt;3
---
\*laughs in Dr Lawrence Gordon Pig\*
---
No Nea and the other characters that you can buy are still Buged. I didnt get their teachable perks to pop up.
---
I haven't seen that message either..
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm definitely giving up an argument when you‚Äôre saying the same thing six times in a row. Why argue with stupid?
---
I will say, one of the good things about running Deliverance (for me, personally) is that it's helped me become more altruistic. I usually just stick to gens so it's a good way for me to get better at helping my teammates.
---
Only down side is I always manage to activate it after my first hook. ( :
---
Joker = Alien confirmed.
---
I was wondering the same thing. Have a nice night. &lt;3
---
Fuck off already &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I also had a game against a streamer and his swf that called me a tunneler. I was wraith and I had the ultra add on that tells me when gens are being worked on by their auras. Start of the game I go to the only gen being worked on. I get there and all for survivors are there. Injure one, injure and down another. Hook her (nea) go back to kick the generator. Realized no other gens are being worked on. Look around to see if the survivors stayed and sure enough they all were. I injured a Claudette only for her to run at the hooked nea and go down. This basically continued all game between all the survivors. Not doing any gens. And hovering around the hook, unhooking in front of me. Going down. Repeat. I never once hooked the same person twice in a row. Still got called a tunneled and camper
---
And then the Doctor burns a ‚ÄòThe Game‚Äô offering :^)
---
Nifty.
---
followed by "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP?"
---
Thank you :)
---
I mean, yeah, he is a joke to me - that's why I bought BBQ + Chili in the Shrine instead of just buying his DLC and leveling him.
---
Not when it‚Äôs used by someone who likes to win... and not when I shift it into... **MAXIMUM OVADWIVU!**
---
both sides are toxic as fuck
---
Blood warden, noed and remember me are all great choices. Fire up is a little weak so might be worth replacing it with something, but still valid. You don't wanna use rancor since it's playstyle conflicts with rancor- with RM, you wanna be hitting the obsession as much as possible before the endgame for the stacks. The idea of rancor is to save you time before endgame by avoiding chasing your obsession, since you can just instadown and mori them at the end. Guy above me is right, you need a killer who can quickly get between the two exit gates like spirit.
---
Do whatever you want.
---
He's honestly a joke to the whole community sadly.
---
After how horrible swf queues were when this game first launched I'm never to bothered by the times nowadays lol.
---
I mean, a large majority of the rant could be fair, but the example case is kind of ridiculous. A lot of killers drop survivors on hatch for any amount of reasons. Whether it be they thought they looped well, or the fact that they felt bad for 4king your team, or any other random reason. Free hatches happen every few games, assuming the killer attempted to let her escape because she was female is fairly presumptuous and as for the waiting 99% of survivors will take free hatch when offered so he was likely just confused why she wasn't taking it and didn't really know how to respond.
---
I doubt most survivors play at least equally killer. I personally play 50/50, though I have moments when I play one side more. But I guess those who play survivor and started despising going against certain killers, they tend to play same killers to get it off their system. 
---
So it's a vicious circle yes. Goes the same with toxicity. You're toxic, you'll get toxicity in return.
---
That's on your team mates playing like shit, not on the killer for using a certain strategy, face it, you lost not because the killer was playing "unfair" but because you got paired with idiots who would rather complain in post game chat than actually complete the objective.
---
Not your stomach thats for sure, even The Plague isnt that biohazardous.
---
Ah, thanks. I haven't played that game since launch, and haven't kept up with the new characters.
---
i actually had my first discord profile pic as Wraith and my desktop wallapaper Sombra's sign since i bought my laptop, 2 years ago

Probably the one where he gets chased for 20 minutes?
---
Hate that shit when I'm hooked. Like bitch, fuck off outa here so the killer can get out of my face. Or when they start looping right in front of me or way too close in general. Just lead the goddamn killer away and let someone else unhook me.
---
Put that Michael down. Right now.
---
sounds familiar
---
White wards will apply their effect to the item you brought in, unless they're destroyed due to use or dropped, in which case the effect will apply itself to any item you pick up in the trial. You could bring a brown toolbox with a WW and leave with a commodious if you lucked out or brought perks for luck/someone burned a luck offering.
---
YOU REALLY LOVE THSES INVISIBLE CHARACTERS!
---
So a more successful DBD?
---
I main GF too, but it's really hard at rank 5 :(
---
He lacks the map pressure and I have to make compromises on perks, as in get at least a surveying perk, ruin cause you get gen rushed like there's no tomorrow, and an anti-loop one. I get like 1-2 kills tops with really good survivors or hook them all twice and then they all escape.
---
You lose it, unless they give it back to you before you escape.
---
meg's face actually looks decent here. probably cause shes making a different expression for once lol
---
i have 70 hours ( most played ) in OW for sombra but my wraith play got worse since Pig and GF came in the game because they were better than him ( the rework chnaged things but he still have my steam profile pic) i also don't change my profile pic that frequently so he might stay until after college idk (:
---
Fair enough
---
The white ward will protect against the loss of your item and any add-ons when you die - with the caveat being that you need to have it in-hand, as you said. I've seen people run it thinking they'd be fine if they encountered, say, a killer with Franklin's, because they had a WW but didn't realize the effect doesn't apply unless you have the item in-hand.
---
Haddonfield has atleast 2 infinites with balanced in each house you can enter, the top floor windows have the potential to break the chase and therefore removing bloodlust making it even harder to catch survivors on. It has the basement house with the stairs not blocked off like on badham,  2 safe pallets and a really strong window. unless your playing hag, nurse or trapper its virtually impossible to win against a good set of survivors. The game map has about 15 safe pallets (with 0 mindgame potential) on the first floor with a couple on the top floor. Its insanely survivor sided. A doc on the game can make the game last a lot longer but in the end a good team will beat him
---
If a luck or chest offering was burned (survivors' coin offerings, Vigo's jar, black salt statuette) or specific perks were brought (Ace in the Hole, Plunderer's Instinct, etc.) then they could've been looting for rare items in chests. White wards don't just protect items you bring in, they'll protect items you bring out. I've done that once and left with a commodious.
---
Delicious
---
Billy
---
He was playing around ds. Every survivor uses it again .
---
I am rank 1 killer and survivor and I have more than 1000 hours on this game. I know that if you play killer noed is shit, but i also know that sometimes it gives you free kills, and that sucks. It is a perk for players with no skill who wants almost a free kill. And the problem is that every killer could use it, even spirits or nurses (i found many using it), so it's ridiculous. I'm not saying they should remove it, but at least give an advice to survs that the killer has noed, like totems becoming black when only 1 gen is left, or something like that. So that the survs have the choice to lose time looking for totems, or to just finish the last gen.
---
Events are always on every platform.
---
as i said, no since there is a killer perk that counters it.
---
That‚Äôs literally how the game works my man. Perks counter perks.
---
What did u expect one side is tea bagging flashlighting wasting your time and the other is hooking you and your friends with barely fair powers and a way to defend urselfs its a natural reaction especially if they are playing a lotta games in a row
---
Somebody once told me not even hell's gonna want me

I have the sharpest tools in my shed

Nancy was looking kind of dumb with her fingers and her thumb

In the shape of an L on her forehead.

And the kids start crying and they don't stop crying

Slice up bitches and they hit the ground dying
---
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
---
You lust for death and your glove gets sharp
---
So much to do, so much to slay
---
So what's wrong with killing the children?
---
You'll never know if you don't go
---
You'll never shine if you don't burn
---
Love playing as hag but all the games against her are so long and drawn out if I don‚Äôt have a flashlight
---
when you decide to remove a survivor from the game as fast as possible by focusing specifically on him you're tunneling. 
---
In every pvp game this term means the same.
---
In Dbd, since it's asymmetrical and survivor isn't as fast as the killer or can't fight back, it's quite frustrating.
---
This is one of those üóø moments
---
Nots not how the human mind works. You don‚Äôt mentally stay a kid if your mom dies. No kid goes out and kills a platoon of soldiers with a axe or steals kids to be their new mother.
---
I love playing against spirit now, used to hate it but feels good out juking them. Except when they‚Äôre running prayer beads/ the bloodhound addon then you feel helpless
---
Bloodhunt coming Sep. 5-9

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cv6lh0/has_this_bug_ever_happened_to_anyone/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Spoilers bitch
---
the definition of camping does not change just because the gates are open. 
---
And the game still removes your chaser points if you do that as killer.
---
Why does it always have to be during the fucking weekend when i woke? Can‚Äôt they let it last for a full week??
---
I‚Äôm fast as fuck boyyyyy!!!
---
same for survivor that allows the killer to tunnel. If a teamate was already hooked twice you need to protect him even if it means ended hooked at his place 'cause the game become way harder  once it's 3v1.
---
The jungle book.
---
Well sure, but they probably do to encourage variety so it will never be
---
Yup. Was a female doctor. Based off a real killer so they had to make some changes so families of victims were not further traumatized by the media whenever this game is brought up.
---
They're talking about the bloody prestige cosmetic and to get it they've reset their characters to get it
---
Like Trapper or Clown, you want to use your power to shut off loops. Put them where you think you‚Äôll be looped at or you can even use them in a chase.
---
BurgerKing Myers is in tears right now
---
i brought Jane to P3 recently (don't know why‚Ä¶). Had to spend millions to get all the perks again. I'm not even using her P3 outfit. i think i get better items in her bloodwebs but i'm not even sure of that.
---
Try to figure out how capable the single survivors are. For example: if you have a survivor who's really good at looping and uses pallets efficiently, try to first use the not so good survivors to get rid of pallets. 
---
If the survivors apply too much pressure force them to focus on rescues and try to snowball from that.
---
Sometimes survivors happen upon these things. We don't get the 'pick up' prompt, if you're capable of recalling. We can't always tell when someone legit can't pick us up. Yes, some survivors will pick up on it and abuse it, but most of us are just trying to get away - either for hatch, or for a teammate to heal us. Try playing a few seconds of survivor before posting stupid shit next time, yeah?
---
Trap chests, trap windows, put a trap near corner of the map if it is also near a gen.
---
I wonder if it's a coincidence that the "older" aged survivors are less likely to be toxic.
---
Yes
---
I need to remember this about corners.
---
Oh... you‚Äòre Right
---
Thabks
---
I did it multiple times and never got banned
---
Fuck, man, I hate when that happens. I'm sorry. Even as a survivor main, I'll say that a lot of survivors need to nut up. If it's a mori, look on the bright side - you'll be in a new game soon. But alas, they tend to forget that splinters and the shroud of separation exist.
---
Yes, its tunneling. If someone dive bombs the hook why would you risk a Borrowed Time. Just hit the unhooker as he's unhooking and then hit him again before he gets anywhere.
---
By the way, just because its tunneling doesnt mean its a dumb thing to do. Tunneling os occasionally the smart choice. Its still tunneling.
---
Wrong
---
Doesn't need to be in the basement honestly just on top of the stairs would be great too
---
What‚Äôs her name?
---
RNG
---
Those killers who see the BPS, leftover gateus, escape cakes, envelopes, etc. and decide to farm - I see you, and I love you. 
---
Those killers who play normally despite the offerings and try to maximize their own BP gain - I see you, and I understand.
---
Those killers who, for whatever reason, see BP offerings and go feral - who hurt you?
---
Based on my experience last double BP when a killer went off the shits and facecamped all of us to death because, in his words, 'I hate when survivors bring BP offerings b/c they assume the killer is gonna farm'.
---
Oh ok that actually makes sense,it's just that some people generally have no idea that this game is out on mobile so I was a little confused.
---
That would mean, it is not cheesy but the same as with other killers. Standing before a open window is never a good idea, when the killer is on the other side since the killer could aim and hit you.
---
No one talking about Nea in the back row?
---
Well not really nurse will always do better than pig or bubba
---
I had no idea that it is available in my country.
---
lol noob.. you never ascended to super prestiged mode ??!!
---
I belive you mean the try hards
---
/s at the end indicates sarcasm.
---
Yup that's what I'm refuring too.
---
I don't mind going against hag. I don't like going against legion or spirit.
---
That's a nice coincidence Because Legion is by far the best BP grinder in the game.
---
What a monsterüò±
---
I LOLed so hard at this one... Gotta love monto.
---
i once had a kate pop a gen in my face right after i hit her so i facecamped her and tbagged the entire time lol, i ended up slugging the entire team and i just teabagged and waited till they bled out, i even messaged them and told them i was gonna let them bleed out
---
We've found the surv main, everyone!
---
Excuse you? Lisa first on the chopping block? Outrageous!
---
Not gonna lie that‚Äôs some pretty strong hotel wifi he has
---
Adrenaline is available to survivors in addition to insta heals and cannot be cleansed. NOED is useful when survivors are teabagging at open exit gates.
---
If you make a survivor lay on the ground for 3 minutes for the sole purpose of BM, it is holding the game hostage, for 3 minutes. That‚Äôs the definition of it. Making the other team stay in a decided match by force.
---
same imo dbd is meant to be played solo its not fun when u know everything that is going on
---
I don't mind if you post him with credit. I don't think they'd go for it.
---
Yeah, I think a sound based killer is really cool, and there's ton of precedence in the horror genre for it.
---
\[Awooing Starts\]
---
I can hear this meme in its entirety
---
Balanced landing and dead hard are better. You can waste lithe if you are in a jungle gym and you don't want to leave the place
---
There's a 4th sign. Watermarking memes.
---
They hated u/jayden20705 because he spoke the truth.
---
I'm a survivor main and a killer has to do whatever it takes to get kills in endgame. You expect them to go brain dead and let us unhook somebody easily?
---
Yeah and give him a ninja outfit and ice powers!
---
It‚Äôs considered hostage when the game is in a state where it doesn‚Äôt evolve. It does in this matter. Dick move? Yes. Reportable? No.
---
lol me and my friends always joke about the fact that david could manhandle most of the female killers with ease in a real life scenario
---
What a clown...
---
I don't know about all Russians, but I'm from belarus and not toxic. I cant do anything about this shity Russian community just because I live near Russia?
---
Can't even buy the shrine out. You aint ready for shit.
---
Why they will instantly leave my lobby?
---
I feel like Quentin should be brought down since i have never come across a toxic Quentin but have come across toxic aces
---
I can only speculate that the person brought a Brand new part and thought he would keep it even if used thanks to the Ward.
---
? everyone disco when you bring that so...
---
What's this from?
---
Yeah it feels good to juke any one not just spirit tho
---
Hey, you know what?
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far.
---
TIL calling someone trash sarcastically is a bannable offense. Because the /S clearly meant that I didn‚Äôt mean what I was writing.
---
Possibly. Had the ban reason been ‚ÄòCaps spam‚Äô - then I would have accepted it.

Damn thats a lot of downvotes

Can you tell me why permonition is better than spine chill?
---
I can‚Äôt do that because they all rush one then two until I‚Äôm chasing them all down one path to the exit
---
Do you need to get a tier 1 perk to unlock this same perk at tier 2 and 3 on the bloodweb ?
---
Great perks? Ahahahahah good one
---
Meg mains at Rank 20 when they hear the killer for 0.01 seconds
---
I don't know why whenever i see Nancy's model i think of Laurie's DbD model.
---
Removed - Uncivil
---
Nah he should close the trap and put it on their head then open it /s
---
bruh they are lacking plenty of killers dont get ur panties in a bundle
---
I see 3 times lisa sherwood in this picture
---
Speaking oh which. Frankenstein's monster would be a pretty good killer. And have dr. Frankenstein as the survivor
---
Who is EAC btw
---
To be honest, the gen jockey is the really altrustic one. I mean, we need to power those 5 gens and open the gates, but if everyone is running around the killer with flashlights or leaving their gens to get that sweet unhook points, there's no way we escape the trial.
---
So, yeah, we need more people like you, who are willing to repair for the greater good.
---
I mean, getting picked up by a bubba is basically "omae wa mou, shindeiru"
---
I think that you missread my comment. I think that most people believe Spine Chill to be better than Premonition. I also believe that Spine Chill is better than Premonition. That is not a controversial opinion.
---
Celebrities is not one thing I am concerned about for sure - that's the first time I see that person, so I can only judge by appearances. The comment wasn't meant to be taken too seriously either, but oh lol.
---
EAC stands for easy anti cheat, which is the anti cheat that bhvr use on dbd
---
Oh noes, let us all congregate to the meeting point of The Spirit then.
---
i think that's physically impossible but would be totally incredible, a whole new way of bullying the killer
---
Billy,Wraith and Trapper should all be in D tier since their morie's are basically the same.
---
Dayum didn't mean to hurt your feelings üòÖ. But no I'm not sensitive. And I never called Tru3 sensitive did I?üòò
---
oh right, thanks for clearing up
---
I think it needs a buff to get tokens back like whenever you get a hook save or a gen is completed. It‚Äôs so useless rn with only 3 tokens.
---
They are use for different things in different places. Sometimes Balanced Landing will save you where Dead Hard couldn't and vice versa. I actually think that both perks are very close to each other in terms strength, but if I had to place one higher than the other I'd choose BL.
---
This. This is too fucking true. I‚Äôve seen new killer mains asking if they are toxic for doing a thing and get downvoted into oblivion.  And if you try to defend them, you get downvoted with them. I hate to see that.
---
I run Bond, Small Game, D-Strike and Borrowed Time.
---
Downvote appriciated. Live life a bit less seriously ü§ô
---
These are really good perks, and a really good killer. The grammar nazi in me wants to point out errors but I mostly ignore it and replace errors with the words I think you mean.
---
It's a really good chapter overall, I like reading fan-made chapters to try and imagine the gameplay, The Android's perks sound like they're really useful for protecting generators and can only get more powerful with less generators to track, while Mia's perks promote an altruistic playstyle.
---
The killer was just a idiot lol
---
Yes, It definitely works outside of rank 21 as well! :)
---
Does it actively extend chases, speed up gen progress, counter tunnelling, etc?
---
I'm not saying it's a *bad* perk, just not a strong one.
---
Coming back to the game after seeing all the hype for the Stranger things characters, then seeing lvl 20s get mad because you camp because you suck. I also sure as hell don‚Äôt wanna pay to get Freddy Kruger :(
---
Stalking from the Campfire
---
SWF?
---
There is no ONE "movie Ghostface", there are 7.
---
^(MADE WITH MEMATIC)
---
It is well worth it unless you've already bought cosmetics for camouflage or for noticability. Having blood all over your character makes them a lot harder to see than default. And like the other guy said there's the higher chances.
---
I hate playing against hag with randoms. People are just stupid, holy shit
---
Yeah there's been news out about it now (source is Netflix UK and Ireland's Twitter)
---
You hear her footsteps. Still, they are quiet and you only hear them once sue's roght next to you... So you can barely do anything.
---
Her ability is the worst to play against and prayer beads makes it even worse. Prayer beads should reduce the distance of her phasing sound, not get rid of it completely - having no phase sound makes her OP.
---

Sombra best girl &lt;3

There's a mobile version??
---
This.
---
That's a bro setup. Just don't spend too much time crouching around hooks or gens won't be done and you'll be an anti-bro
---
Tbh I actually have pretty good game against hags cause they keep you on ur toes more usually
---
I save my good items for swf. I use the brown shit with randos
---
No.
---
ohh no. *opens task manager* it looks like my game crashed while loading. *right clicks DeadByDaylight.exe* it looks like I have to manually close my game via task manager and just restart.  What a shame.
---
Pog
---
This is so accurate, that it is scary
---
Whenever I see this happen to someone I'm chasing I give them a bit of space because it happens to me sometimes and it's dumb.
---
'cause she needs it !! ...wait
---
Funny because that EXACT same situation happened to me today(escaped just in time as well).
---
They should definitely refund you your bps. I lost around 400k and submitted a ticket within like a day or so I got my refunded bps.
---
I‚Äôve seen so many people being like ‚Äúwe got ghost face which means we should get Sidney Prescott soon!‚Äù like no, no that‚Äôs not how any of this works
---
Yeah, I got myself a genuine Fantastic Faces mask from Ebay (since I‚Äôm not from America, and my city‚Äôs only costume store usually brings cheap knockoff masks, with Trick or Treat Studios mask being surprisingly the only company they bring genuine products from) and the quality of the mask is astounding. I used to own Ghostface masks years ago that clearly weren‚Äôt official and the difference in materials and the whole feel of the mask are so obvious. That‚Äôs why I wanted to purchase an official Ghostface costume bundle from Fun World, but seeing how they only distribute to retailers, I guess I‚Äôm gonna have to find some deal online. Thanks anyway!
---
How else do you think they get so much meat?
---
They know where that shit comes from.
---
Wish we could get the bloodweb rework before the event. Hotfix BHVR?
---
Yeah no shit you can't tell someone in the cosmetics department to work on bug fixing it's called don't hire so many people for that department in the first place. It wouldn't be a problem if they had decent optimisation but when the opening credits become like the sims 3 and are unskippable for a short period of time simply because it lags your whole computer out from a *single video* then you have a problem. Lots of people know their optimisation is shit and other games are optimised far better with more things to optimise than DbD does. Stop being a white Knight protecting the devs and open your eyes to see that the game could and should be far better with the team that they have working on it. Yeah they need to make money off cosmetics but they charge far too much for a single outfit. I don't care if I'm 'in the minority', it's called a cash grab. They make money off the whales in the community and continuously bring out more and more to snag off people. Take a look at other games that make a shit ton of money off cosmetics and you'll see the correlation. $10 for one outfit is too much when you have so many cosmetics available and also make money off DLCs, plus the game itself. It's not like DbD is a cheap game in the first place, especially considering you have to pay for over half the characters.
---
One of the reasons of many I switched to console. My pc couldn‚Äôt handle dbd that well but I still got some good games in. Almost all of them were full of toxic survivors. And even if I switched to console, angry survivors still message me.
---
All running self care. Easy 4k I assume? üòã
---
You replied to his comment so it isn't very obvious that you mean it in general. Btw I must admit he is kind of right and you are acting like a child who is butthurt because someone criticizes his friend. Please don't do that
---
Play as you want boi, nobody gets toxic before enduring toxicity from the other end.
---
I've come across gamer girls while playing Dead by Daylight
---
Man, woman, 30 or 12, you're all gonna die eventually.
---
I do admittedly have a soft spot for the females because I don't encounter many, but I mostly just try to make the game an enjoyable experience for all involved and I don't treat the girls much different from the guys, because they are people too and I treat everyone how I wanna be treated.
---
This one guy messaged me insults because I outplayed him and I messaged back "aight b, whatever makes you happy my guy"
---
You‚Äôre definitely not wrong, it‚Äôs a shame people are really competitive

I guess DBD embraces [sexual healing](https://youtu.be/rjlSiASsUIs)

But I got a double pip, the world needs to know!

There are only two reasons I t-bag as Ghostface.

1. "Hey, farm?"

2. "Yeah that's what you get for t-bagging at the pallet you toxic mf don't you ever come at me again with that *B U L L*"

All I get is Billy...

Shit gets old.
---
Can you picture Clown explaining Coulrophobia to the Hag
---
Come to think of it there's a lot of implications involving the portals. I think placing them on high ground spots (assuming they can fit) is going to be a popular thing to do. Now imagine huntress with this ability...
---
"Why are you booing me? I'm right"
---
Perfectly balanced
---
No self respecting killer would care if the last guy escapes through the hatch, the hatch is the reward system for shitty survivors that usually did so little the rest of the team snuffed it!
---
I do appreciate the Freddy hate though, it shows you have trouble playing against him and I like that!
---
I'm killer main but whenever I play survivor I do exactly what you say, just take killer's attention because I know that's exactly what distracts me as killer. Like what's so hard on understanding that? Do suvivors think the game is only gen rush/unhook simulator?
---
This happened to someone in my game once but it didn‚Äôt even let us spectate them anymore and the killer wasn‚Äôt even in the game anymore so when the timer ran out finally on the survivors side it just said they escaped
---
Wait, ChocoTaco, as in the streamer? ü§î Sorry if you‚Äôre not, your username caught my eye.
---
But hey, I went from maiming Kate to playing a ton of Nea cause I got tunneled all the time. Might as well adopt the bright clothing if I‚Äôm gonna get tunneled anyways.
---
You're super valid, I can understand tbagging people if they're toxic but when there's no reason to?? I just don't get it
---
I empathize with survivors when I play the killer, in my first public match ever I came across a baby Meg who didn't even run away (she would walk but not run) until she got hit, the other three survivors in the match kept avoiding me so much to my own dismay I ended up sacrificing the Meg first, I didn't want to kill her but the other three were basically nonexistent until they realized nobody was doing generators anymore.
---
The noeds
---
Like ghost face, the new killer is a combination of two killers, hag and pig, nothing original
---
I believe a lot of people t-bag as Ghostface because they were other killers who have had a long history of getting t-bagged and not being able to BM back in the same manner.
---
61 seconds I'll never get back
---
&gt;no gen patrolling
---
I love this one the most. 1 gen is remaining and all of them are close to each other. What should I do? Go to the other side of the map so suvivors can get it done?
---
I tested it in a ranked match, unfortunately.
---
Nice vine referente √±.
---
so it sounds like a similar issue unless you dont have low amount of perks left to buy
---
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt kill us, someone died. You have to let us go now.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWhat? WHY!?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúBecause it says so right here in the survivors guide for killers.‚Äù
---
Amazing
---
They do
---
I would imagine since you're not holding an item when you die
---
and there the average 'tard with which you can't discuss using facts and logic...
---
The crybabies
---
As if you need to camp to win in the majority of games.
---
Seems like a fun build to run but not op at ALL
---
Where is my piggy!??
---
That is a white man....I don‚Äôt see jake park at all.
---
I always give a fuck about Sam, heretic. My meme is my argument, and it doesn‚Äôt take a smart person to read between those lines and see my point, hell, doesn‚Äôt even take a high school dropout. Wonder where that leaves you?
---
It‚Äôs a bit too weak in my opinion, maybe give it a bloodpoint bonus in every category
---
Can I repost this next month?
---
It just happened to a guy in my game yesterday. The killer noticed and carried him to hatch.
---
That's the problem. If you're being physically stopped by a wall and I'm outside of arms reach, physics says you wouldn't be able hit me. Idc if the lunge would have, your model wouldn't.
---
Whoa settle down bro.
---
Please give me a link. please, I must see this
---
Oh sorry, bruh. Idk what came over me.
---
I‚Äôll play him every once and a while but I main clown and trapper.
---
Everyone was so happy when they were bragging how all the ickle twelvies would be brought in by Stranger Things, but now they're here it's gonna be scary.
---
Yea its pretty stupid
---
Survivors are always going to be pissy like that. Just move on!
---
Actually, we are not talking about reality, you know? You did realize that DbD is just a game with its own rules? Your common sense helps nothing in a game.
---
Moreover, I suggested that people could get a false impression while being chased to a window as they do not have objective means to measure distances.
---
The fact you're being downvoted is baffling.
---
r/redditdownloader
---
There's an annoying exploit right now where groups of players are put into queue based on whoever hosted the SWF. So, the games just imagined that they are all rank 13 and put them with you!
---
AHOY SPONGE DWIGHT ME BOY, I'M TRYING TO GET THIS PERSON OFF THE HOOK BUT I'M DUMMY THICC AND THE SPIRIT PULLS ME OFF BECAUSE OF THE CLAP OF MY ASS CHEEKS
---
I need a bigger version of that Freddy xD
---
...how?
---
Love this art style! Keep up the gorgeous work!
---
Hi Mr Strawman.

Thank you!

Me toooo!!!

^also ^made ^to ^be ^dark ^mode ^friendly
---
You right, and I agree
---
Lmao, didn't hate on Freddy. Just saying it was ironic a guy named Freddy Main is calling survivors that find hatch Sissy's when I had a Freddy DC cause I found hatch.
---
unironically me
---
i'm so fucking trash at survivor
---
The community is nowhere near as bad as this one lol
---
damn, my comment was a joke
---
every time i get a Hillbilly daily to chainsaw survivors i know its gonna take me a few games
---
I hate that bug
---
I'm trying to figure out how two statements equals a rant.
---
Hag with make your choice is pretty good too
---
Um. If my arm is around 2 foot long. And I'm close to 6 feet tall. Realistically their "distance" wouldn't go even 1 meter out from the window.
---
The problem is that their hitbox is registering as still in the window while their model isn't.
---
I have this exact problem as killer and pallets. If I recorded ever time ive been pallet stunned and not even in the area for it my storage would be full. I even have a post on here of me getting stunned by a pallet I clearly walked away from.
---
It's all about hitbox lag, and it fucks survivors over more than anything.
---
I did it luckily when I didnt even know that trophy existed
---
You're not just toxic, you're stupid
---
No harm done, my man. Just take it easy, yeah?
---
Still not a great concept.
---
Half of my games, i hook someone, and 8 pictoseconds later a Dwight comes flying out of the bushes to unhook them, in full sight.  
---
Obviously i turn around and maul them - am i supposed to purposely hit the non injured person? Why? Am i supposed to just pretend i didn't see it? Why?  
---
I've never had a survivor go to me, damn dude thats a rough game you had there - here, hook me for free
---
Congrats!
---
Really? I thought it was non directional full map coverage
---
Ash will be in the second pack.
---
Made it a little better
---

I am sure people get it with no captions 
---
I hope
---
If you don't want to be taken seriously, don't make statements about strategies and gameplay, people naturally like to actually discuss those things
---
Given the tendency for coordinated survivors to not heal immediately, the speed generators are completed, and that your Broken status will wear off in time for you to benefit from Adrenaline.
---
Deliverance makes the Killer lose a lot of momentum since it doesn't require another survivor present, Killers can't afford to lose momentum.
---
And that breaking a chase with Adam means he's in your Terror Radius getting potential progress towards his pebble as well as not losing his chance to use Deliverance?
---
I won't tunnel Adam after the first hook, but if he and another survivor are in the same tile set and it only takes an extra second or two to hit him first... It'd be like saying "don't enter a locker against BBQ&amp;C" or "don't 99% the gates against Blood Warden".
---
But you will see survivors do both those things all the time, would you stop doing those things even if you knew the Killer had Bloodwarden/BBQ because they have a heart?
---
I hope too
---
It's non-directional but it's still around him.
---
The major difference between it and the terror radius is that you can't tell if Freddy is 32m away, or right on top of you.
---
There‚Äôs this awkward staring before the chase begins, like ¬´¬†who‚Äôs gonna make the first move?¬†¬ª
---
Because they have human facial features, which means they look similar, so it‚Äôs a funny joke /s
---
I genuinely don‚Äôt see a resemblance except for they‚Äôre white and have faces but who knows honestly
---
He's not even like Hag
---
The funniest thing is that the game tells you to gen patrol in the tutorial.
---
Yeah, you're right lol
---
oh but you can bet your ass i'll be running Adrenaline/Borrowed Time/Decisive Strike/Dead Hard or maybe go really spicy and throw in Balanced Landing  
---
I'll be using a Haddonfield offering of course, and bringing my trusty healthkit with insta-heal add-on and my friends in discord will carry flashlights to blind you if you pick any of us up.  
---
Oh one of us has OoO aswell lmao, hope you aren't playing Trapper or Ghostface
---
Oh well hello xD
---
I know they look similar but eh, I guess it can work.
---
Not sure why your being downvoted because this is what being tunneled is. While the highest votes reply is about getting max hooks....
---
Ah. Now, that might be enough to make me consider this.
---
Yeah dude, we know, since before it even released
---
thanks mate
---
Idk Nancy has a super square face, thin lips, squinty eyes, and a sharper nose. meg doesn‚Äôt share any of those features. the only thing similar is megs ingame model is always mad as hell and Nancy has a weird expression.
---
Indeed, they should try to make hitbox registration and animation as much conclusive as possible to keep frustration low.
---
Although, if it is intended then they should make obvious for all that Freddy stretches his arms to keep him on par with other killers; it would not be inconclusive since Freddy walks in a dreamworld where he can alter his shape.
---
But this seems to be that kind of issue that will be lying on the backseat for some time.
---
I don‚Äôt mind the pictures. What‚Äôs annoying to me are people that upload 5-10 minute videos for a specific play. Like dude, I‚Äôm not gonna watch your entire trial. It‚Äôs so easy to clip videos, you‚Äôre just being lazy.
---
at one point you leave that behind and ascend to become an Ash Main
---
The higher chance is pretty much negligible. Leveling after 50 is really fine too, and I would prioritize leveling other killers anyway because of the perks
---
was the disclaimer not good enough to show that I'm meming around?
---
So would I just keep doing the level 50 bloodweb as I need more addons/hunt for perks?
---
daaamn, those graphics looking crisp
---
For me it's the plag and the slag (legion)
---
Thank you
---
It‚Äôs always been this way. It‚Äôs not a bug.
---
Like I understand that you didn‚Äôt know or hell even cared that you tunneled them but you have to be able to see it from their perspective and understand why they were mad.
---
It‚Äôs this this type of ignorant bliss that makes this game so toxic. As a survivor I feel so bad when my group bully‚Äôs a killer but we aren‚Äôt toxic about it. We use flashlights to get saves and we are good at looping but because we do these things without teabagging we are tunneled so hard and get shit talked at the end of the game. 
---
And as a killer I feel bad when I feel like I have to take out a certain person before someone else. I just feel like survivor/killer mains just forget or just don‚Äôt care about the other side having fun. If we could just take a step back and think as rational human beings then I feel like this game would be a whole lot of fun for everyone.
---
r/woooosh
---
There was easily between 5-10 seconds left on DS there, he couldn‚Äôt have done anything
---
This is incorrect. You don't lose points if a Survivor is in close proximity to the hook.
---
I think it's alright to go after an injured survivor after a healthy one.
---
But tunneling is never giving that survivor a chance, ever, to escape or do anything or have more than 15 seconds peace. If they get healed up while you're coming back they still haven't gotten to do anything other than "crouch simulator" for those 15 seconds outside of a chase and it's pretty aggravating if you're not a good looper/not near pallets (and really even if you are, it can be).
---
The problem lies in that if you're in the area and find both survivors, the healthy one needs to run interference so that the killer has a reason not to hit the injured one.
---
That said chasing a survivor for minutes at a time isn't tunneling - the building loops can let the entire team run you for minutes at a time each, sometimes long chases are all there is in a game, and if you drop that chase the next survivor will just Balanced Landing loop Ormond or a Haddonfield House or use the Cowshed windows to loop you for another two-three minutes.
---
good work, i love it
---
&lt;3
---
*Both broke it together
---
They don‚Äôt play the same...right. 
---
Well, how about looks then? 
---
Demogorgon is more beast than humanoid
---
Hag is more human than beast (tough she acts like a beast)
---
They both use their claws as their weapons. 
---
Hag licks the blood off her claw-hand when she hits a survivor, demogorgon only roars.
---
If hit with a pallet. Hag makes a gurgle sound. Almost like a growl.
---
I would guess the demogorgon would just roar.
---
Still. Looks similar to me.
---
I play both equally, but you can't deny that some spirit things are a bit interesting. Her fading while not phasing, but her window climb, or rather lack off, has to be the most annoying thing ever.
---
I‚Äôd focus on Levelling other Killers to 50 first. Then after the Stranger Things update there will be 4 perks available after the Level 50 Bloodweb which will make it easier to get what you want.
---
This. This is great. Eat my upvote
---
If you want to go for it I am happy to help. Done it numerous times.
---
LPT: play killer and let other people do it for you
---
As an Ace main I can relate very much to this. I always think of any stories Ace might have in his head while in a trial. :D
---
It objectively is a strategy. Bad one maybe, but he is 100% correct to say it is a strategy.
---
How is wraith not the worst, he just hits them like 4 times then it's over
---
Then dont be a toxic cunt
---
How did you get medic?
---
You just said yourself what your intent was. Why are you even asking?
---
Yes for the most part the killers strength speed and ability‚Äôs come from the entity with the exception of some of the licensed ones like Myers ,Freddy and the Demogorgon
---
You joke but a lot of high tier killer players, like huntress or spirit, get completely thrown off when people hide earlier than normal. If they actually do the gens then they become really effective
---
I've found myself doing this more often as I climb the ranks as killer. It seems like the strategy is always the same when you get a hook at end game with 3 or 4 remaining, 99 an exit gate, or both, hook rush from 2 directions behind cover and bait out a swing from the killer if possible, borrowed time, body block and if the hooked survivor had ds they take any protection hits needed. If they don't make any mistakes, it's really tough to get a sacrifice at that point.
---
yes. But the radius is kind of small so you need to have a at least one survivor that try to save and you need to have him close to you.
---
Nope
---
I mean, ye...if its the first game of the Killer he might not know what those notifications mean.
---
Sureüëç
---
Very much looking forward to it now, thanks :X
---
funny, did laugh
---
Harassment? Please. You sound ridiculous.
---
why is everyone hating on my favourite survivor
---
healing 100 survivors
---
mmmmm delicious vectors
---
Thanks, thats alot more helpful than "just reveal him"
---
You seems to spawn right next to the hatch when you jump in because of the glitch
---
I would go plague if you just want another viable killer to actually play, but go clown if you just want to be able to get pop rather than wait for it to come up in the shrine of secrets, don't get legion, just wait for discordance in the shrine
---
why ? 2000 Shards = 150K BP. If you do 10 survivors games in the normal games you get that or even more anyway.
---
For perks I'd say the clown. I like the plague but she doesn't have great perks, legion is just shit tbh. If I were you I'd go for clown just for pop goes the weasel
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Just continue to play the game and don‚Äôt worry about it
---
It‚Äôs the only one I need left for platinum and I 100% should have it by now
---
Then wait 60 seconds to pick em up
---
What‚Äôs popping
---
I consider myself a gen rusher but I use balanced landing and urban evasion to prevent chases. I'm fairly new to the game and I main survivor.
---
I‚Äôve ran into a spirit and a plague, both with the intentions of finding and killing everyone. I haven‚Äôt ran into a camper yet.
---
Chucky
---
Legit had a game yesterday where I was a called a cheater for using spirit.
---
I had to stop being this Adam because of how hard I‚Äôd get focused because I love deliverance. I‚Äôve started switching into Looper Adam and no one really expects that from an Adam. Between me and my regular friends who main Nea, Claudette or Kate, killer‚Äôs gens to come for me first thinking I‚Äôm the one with Deliverance when in reality, at least two other people have it and I‚Äôm the one with DS/Iron Will and the one planning on being the distraction. 
---
But as an Adam main I love this meme. Well done.
---
If you have iOS change your region to Denmark and put 3900 for the zip code
---
Huntress been playing some Siege it seems
---
But we can‚Äôt use perks like adrenaline or carry insta heals or toolboxes
---
Dweet main here, I am indeed 50/50 to be toxic and trash talk you.
---
Luck offerings don‚Äôt actually affect chest drops. I think it was probably someone just bringing the highest color add on or knowing what it did.
---
I wish you could see other players doing this in the lobby.
---
Some people are lagging tho, i dont think its my internet, my internet is good
---
I‚Äôm one of those people who liked the idea of a 2v8 type game mode a lot but this solves all the issues. It‚Äôs a KYF game so it doesn‚Äôt need to be balanced at all since there is no rank. I would also vote that it allows any number of killers.
---
it is unfair since consoles cant go on the ptb, also no with the shards because that doesn‚Äôt let us test out the new perks and stuff, i think that the killers and survivors should each start at  level 10 so we can try out their perks (3 perk slots at level 10 so then their three personal perks can be equipped).
---
Victor Frankenstein deadlifts David King and yeets him onto a hook. I love it.
---
They waste more of their own time than survivors time, though. Even if you use the ability on healthy survivors, you still will have to deal with the stun, which only benefits the survivor. The mend timer isn‚Äôt long enough to justify the waste of your own time applying it. I think you‚Äôre being a bit overly optimistic of their power, and it doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôve played legion consistently as you‚Äôve ranked up every season. I‚Äôve played a lot of legion, even post rework, at purple to red ranks, and legion is not good. The ability isn‚Äôt worth using, especially since the speed in frenzy is slower (and actually chaining hits prolongs a chase a lot and doesn‚Äôt even offer valuable tracking ability), and since legions base movement speed is faster, you have more incentive to NOT use the power versus actually using it. There‚Äôs also no incentive for the player to even play as legion: why pick legion when they‚Äôre so bad, when you really don‚Äôt get as many bloodpoints as legion as you do other killers, and most importantly, when you can just pick a better killer? I guess if you like being miserable and made fun of, legion is the best choice.
---
I find the only time I facecamp is when gates are open. At that point why would I leave and risk the person getting unhooked? It makes sense to just sit there and make sure I get the kill.
---
Take it a step further and let KYF be completely customizable:
---
* number of survivors
---
* number of killers
---
* number of hooks
---
* number of items or types of items found
---
* number of gens
---
Etc
---
yea thats a good idea as well tbh probs better
---
Freddy, Alien, or Miner
---
I just feel like Franklin‚Äôs is usually a wasted perk slot.  There are so many other perks that could get more use out of them than Franklin‚Äôs almost every game.
---
Probably because you said one word and didn‚Äôt back it up with any proof whatsoever
---
BHRV is lurking this thread
---
Please enlighten me. How does one do this?
---
Everyone has a responsibility to make sure their internet isn't ass, especially when you're the host of the lobby. Not to mention it could be a bannable offense if it does look similar to a lag switch  and enough people report it
---
shit that's fucked up. Is BHVR doing anything to fix it?
---
The only time I really get frustrated and mention tunneling to myself is when I‚Äôve already been downed and hooked after a good chase and the killer instantly goes back to chasing me after they watch another survivor unhook me.  When they down me and pick me up and get hit with decisive and STILL go for me then it‚Äôs super annoying.  Like I get it I play killer too, but man sometimes things are just out of your control in this game.
---
They aren‚Äôt the same dev team So you cant realy Say that tho
---
Yeah he should have just gone after the survivors that went out of the map instead of being a toxic tunneler, i am disappointed in him
---
Oh no
---
Bubba was so op in mkx while I was just a takeda main.
---
What's your up/down speed? Is your network shared? (parents, roommate, neighbors, etc). Are you in an non-common region of the world? 
---
Note: your upload speed matters a lot when hosting games
---
Yea but game maps are thousands of times smaller than your country
---
I did a speed test and I get almost 100 mbps download and 20 mbps upload, that should be fine to play, I can play every other multiplayer game fine
---
no i dont understand help ;-; is the joke me not understanding cos thats funny but i kinda feel like im missing something ;-;
---
Wow you must be fun at parties. Dickface..
---
Fantastic job!
---
Not wrong for trying to help your team. When playing killer though, I don't pay attention to survivor gestures. If someone were selling someone else out, I shouldn't take advantage of that in the interest of fairness. That and as you indicated, it could just be a juke. So vs me, it would just be a waste, for other killers it might work.
---
"Burger" King.
---
Maybe they should do double daily rituals. Each one has two options to complete, one for killers or one for survivors and you only need to do one of them to get it.
---
This, if you use Bill for unbreakable or Laura for decisive it's too obvious.
---
"Do they use their power?" "YES" *flips down Legion and Billy*
---
Not to my knowledge I just want my platinum tho
---
It‚Äôs only worth it if you want the cosmetics imho, I‚Äôd just start leveling the next killer you want perks from.
---
Can‚Äôt believe we get a permanent debuff for existing, being born is so RNG, man. We should ban it from tournament
---
Yeah those speeds are more than fine. Are you using WiFi or are you wired up?
---
If you want an actual test and happen to have friends who play DBD, maybe get in a KYF lobby and have your friends tell you if it's actually bad or not
---
I miss the days that flashlights were the biggest complaint then it was DS. Now flashlights are useless. This reddit is a circle jerk that once the thing everyone complains about is gone they switch to the next thing and treat it like game breaking, but never once complained about it before.
---
Some killer was yelling at someone last night for bringing in self care. Like loading in solo you cant solely rely on teammates. Then when a survivor complains about NOED it just turns into DO TOTEMS. I cannot wait until inner strength comes out and all these killers that rely on NOED to get any kills slide back to rank 20.
---
Give thrilling tremors a try with Freddy. It‚Äôs really good with his gen teleport ability.
---
That would be the joke.
---
What sucks about Burger King is that, around here at least, their burgers aren't even good. Bastards cook a buttload of meat to last them when they're not even busy. Old as shit.
---
I don't mean to misinterpret your post or be unfair in my assessment of your intentions, but it just sounds to me like you're not really worried about Legion's description being inaccurate, you just wanted to complain because you're bad at Legion.
---
soon everyone can ascend higher to being a Steve main
---
I play both too. spirit is just broken and half of the community aware of that. it is just unfun and unfair most of the times for the other side.
---
welp. I got wooooshed while wooooshing.
---
You got me
---
I'm wired and I don't have any friends that play dbd but I'll try to get someone to help
---
You‚Äôre art is amazing! Is there a DA or tumblr I can follow you on?
---
thats becoming the Ultimate Lifeform
---
Miner? As in from "My Bloody Valentine"?
---
I've had lots of questionable matches while duoing where the killers and our other teammates were around rank 15 while both of us were sub 10, one of us usually being somewhere around rank 7-8.
---
Matchmaking seems to be weird at 10+. Really wish they'd just get rid of/reduce rank reset further ASAP. Makes playing a real bore unless you grind out your rank as soon as it hits.
---
You can. I'll smack it out of your hands, though.
---
Click down on your player and move your mouse side to side in the lobby. On console, hold the confirm button [x on ps4, a on xbox] and move the right stick side to side.
---
Correct
---
ashes just dc
---
Hell yeah. Same
---
But all survivors toxic and people who press control on me need ban
---
Incorrect, simply jump into a locker before your guaranteed death and like magic, you still have it!
---
I would rather Ronald McDonald be a killer but whatever floats your boat (only kinda /s)
---
I‚Äôd have some Twin Peaks characters. Maybe Laura Palmer as a survivor &amp; Evil Black Lodge Dale Cooper or Bob as the killer.
---
Marvelous
---
Bill mains be like:
---
Wtf is face camping
---
Not even Inner Strength?
---
Take it a step further; make KYF lobbies where you can find games to chill in and just have fun goofing around
---
In my experience Bills are generally baby survivors who are really trying their best. I always feel bad killing them :(
---
Should try running spine chill. Good perk all around and it completely negates the spirit mind games. Also makes her add on that makes her silent when invisible useless.
---
If this and that. No argument is bulletproof on this subreddit. We can go on about it all day long and never come to a conclusion.
---
You sure you're not just bad?
---
I hope that gargantuan pole up your ass is custom fitted for all the use it apparently sees
---
Are you calling Noob3 toxic?
---
While I agree that a killer should never be so op/annoying that you need to run a specific perk to counter them, spine chill is a straight up good perk to run in general.
---
Thrilling tremors show which gens they are working after picking up someone
---
Yeah, because that helps when trying to decide if you should drop a pallet or not? Run?  Walk?   
---
Spirit has no counterplay and this subreddit knows it.
---
Legion sucks, asnif any of you see him a lot nowadays.
---
cause the connection (ping) will be very high, which causes a lot of delay. no one wants high delay in online games
---
Ye. MKX Butcher Bubba is reboot Bubba while DBD Bubba is original Killer Outfit Bubba. Though, given his lore and where that is in the film, DBD's Bubba should be wearing his "Sunday Best" AKA "The Pretty Lady" outfit
---
Alexa play obama soup noodles
---
Slightly decent work as of now.
---
Bullshit. I never play Adam.
---
Nurses shouldn't be playing mind games at all. Other than indoor maps where she's forced to. On all the outdoor maps they should be blinking first to gain vision, blinking again to get the hit. If you try to guess where they are behind the wall, it's really the only way a survivor can gain enough distance to avoid being hit on second blink.
---
Survivor queues are generally longer than killer queues on console. The one exception is whenever a new killer is released, so expect shorter survivor queues whenever the Stranger Things chapter is released. It'll be interesting to see if two survivors being released changes that.
---
Zone Me Now

Are you two high? Killer Leatherface had some of the best meterburn combos in MKX with the berserker stance where Butcher Leatherface had some of the best mixups. Bubba is only low tier in DBD in MKX he's a king lol

It's like a faster self care, but limited. So sorry not sorry but I'm gon stick with self care

This is amazing, great job dude.

I do enjoy playing legion, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to lie about how good they are because they‚Äôre not. A majority of this community, it seems, plays to win, and legion is not a character that you can do that by playing according to the standards of the game (most killers get value from using their ability in a way that assists them in winning the match, ie: getting a lot of kills; legions ability does not do this). You‚Äôre allowed to like playing legion, but over-embellishing how good they are is misleading to new players (since we are going to be getting plenty of new players) who deserve to know what they‚Äôre purchasing before they purchase it (especially since the games description of legion isn‚Äôt even accurate). Nurse, spirit, and billy are good but they don‚Äôt get you the most value out of points (especially billy, since his chases don‚Äôt last very long). It depends on what you‚Äôre going for when you play, be it points, kills, or just fun, but in a community where fun isn‚Äôt allowed (unless you‚Äôre trolling the killer and escaping or slaughtering survivors and getting a 4K), there aren‚Äôt many killers you can play and have genuine fun, and legion is one of them. Their ability was more fun to use before because it was faster, but it‚Äôs hard now to get much value out of them if you want bloodpoints or kills, that‚Äôs my point. Play them for fun, but don‚Äôt lie to people about how good they are, since in most peoples hands, they‚Äôre not going to be good at all because of how stupid you have to change your playstyle to actually do well as them.
---
I can hear this.
---
When you have to run a specific perk to hopefully have a chance against 2 moderately competent survivors in your lobby, that's when you know something is wrong.
---
I'm talking about Ruin BTW
---
I consistently get 4Ks as Spirit, sorry to break it to you that you've been playing on ez mode if she's all you play
---
Thank you very much!
---
Am I the only one that gets happy when I see like 2 or 3 flashlights in a match?  Like I am prepared to look away and at least I know where \*one\* or maybe even two other survivors will be when I down someone.  It's like a chain reaction of suck for them.
---
Some groups intentionally have the highest rank host, it's pretty lame and totally avoidable by just using the rank average of the group. There are lots of smurfs too.
---
Chucky. 
---
I liked the reboot not being a possessed doll and more of a obssessive AI that controls technology.
---
Would want something like that in DbD, more of a fragile killer that has a map presence by controlling gadgets, to kill, but i think this wouldnt fit in the game the way it is right now
---
So maybe the original, but i think its impossible anyway
---
That's sums up basically every Freddy game. Teleports to your generator PGTWs hecks off to somewhere else finds someone,hooks them repeat.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get it man, you‚Äôre never safe from salty people.
---
If you kill them all as a killer - you suck and need to learn how to play.
---
If you survive as a survivor - you suck and you need to learn how to play.
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury ftw
---
"Oh boy, sure can't wait to play some killer!"
---
**Gets genrushed and looped till daylight** 
---
"Guess I'll play survivor then."
---
**Gets facecamped and tunneled to death**
---
FFFFFF-
---
Maybe
---
These aren't mutually exclusive issues
---
No, I like that they promote playing both sides and offer random rewards for doing so. It's important to promote improving your game and reducing this "us vs them" mentality in the community.
---
This is gold.
---
Never thought about that. Thank you.
---
Everybody gangsta until the bush starts trash-talking you.
---
They already said they'd never do flying killers :(
---
It'd be op af anyways
---
This game shouldn't even have killers to be honest. Other survivors do all the work for them anyways.
---
''Shit maps? Awesome!"
---
''Bringing offerings that make everything fucking hard to see? Awesome." 
---
''Yes, please Urban around and work on generators while half the team is hooked. Awesome."
---
The game has literally descended into ''This is now an asymmetrical game where the survivors slowly destroy one another from the inside. The killer is just as perplexed as you are."
---
You can only apply this when you play against a perkless/addonless spirit aswell. Spirit is strong, but stop complaining about a Killer when theres a better one. Spirit relies on audio, there was a time where audio for footsteps were broken and no1 was playing Spirit, because it was literally impossible.
---
No now you must smack perks too
---
You can escape easily against spirit with 0 perks, you sure you're not just bad?
---
If tru really is a baby I might stop watching him lol
---
Also why the spoiler tag?
---
"This subreddit" is not an accurate representation for the community.
---
I'm crying
---
AWAKEN, MY STEVES!
---
*Synthwave remix of the pillar man's theme plays*
---
That map is legit the strongest map for survivors. I would be thanking them
---
*tips fedora* ‚ÄúNothing personal kid‚Äù
---
Yea, you that guy.
---
I always struggle any time before 6PM (UK time). Survivor takes nearly 10 minutes and Killer almost 15. On an evening my Killer lobbies are instant and Survivor anywhere up to 5 minutes.
---
I came to post this, this is kind of a big deal while playing Hag...
---
Cleanse totem 16 secs, look for a locker, wait 8 secs on the locker ... No thanks, will be faster use self care.
---
lol sure did :P
---
Deja vu is not even that bad but that broken key...
---
What‚Äôs noed?
---
They are much brighter the fresher they are. Try to see if one end of the trail is brighter than the other, and go toward the brighter end.
---
I'm not going to have a build just to counter spirit but thanks anyways.
---
This *is it chief*
---
I get that point of view, I do. Theres not much that one person can do. But the moments where I've been treated right on this game are the ones that encourage me to be fair and decent, and bit by bit, kindness begets kindness.  I'll never be able to FIX it. But, if we try together, we can make it just a little bit better for everyone. Plus its not that hard to be cool
---
Scratch marks that last shorter mean the survivor is in the healthy state. Scratch marks that last longer means the survivor is injured. Dying survivors leave no scratch marks.
---
i started as a baby claudette... same got tunneled almost every game, farmed happily by team mates and face camped.  
---
But nea brings out the inner toxicity   
---
(ds, deliverance, dead hard, adrenaline)   
---
salt in every perk. i love it    
---
my main goal was to survive but now its to make the killer salty as possible   
---
***i don't talk post-game i just do what i gotta do and scram***

Dang. I would have flipped. GG op
---
I love facecamping Neas with my Bubba
---
Honestly the perks aren't op, they are balanced in my opinion
---
Who's the character tho
---
Literally someone's response to a guy complaining about spirit was "just run spine chill"
---
Bravo six, always dark
---
lol at the people downvoting that comment
---
If you mean all characters and stuff, never
---
Have you ever played against survivors with balanced landing on haddonfield
---
I gives you information. The most valuable thing in this game
---
I‚Äôve had the dish of Aids thank you, I‚Äôll pass on seconds
---
Nurse can be fun because she's so scary and you can get pretty good at dodging her, though you will probably still die.
---
Bikini Bill when
---
depends entirely on the killer. For most killers, this map is pretty killer sided, especially in the case of nurse, who can flip up and down through the floor.
---
It was a joke
---
Right? I really love some of the stances some killers have.
---
They said something about not wanting to make another skeletal rig for a less humanoid character but I'm pretty sure they just couldn't do it until now
---
While we are here, tunneling is not only a legitimate strategy, it‚Äôs an effective one. The idea that I am toxic for going after the person who is injured and close to death is as ridiculous as calling someone toxic in Rocket League for utilizing bumps or demos. 
---
I understand that it feels bad for the tunneled survivor and it‚Äôs frustrating for teams as a whole, but then again, I don‚Äôt play the game for other people to have fun, though I am always happy to go out of my way to do so, calling me toxic when I decide not to is ridiculous. 
---
____
---
I often let the 4th player escape, or duos escape if their teammates quit on them. But I‚Äôm not going hamstring myself just because it feels bad to get killed.
---
After long enough, they become the monsters you always told them they were
---
Yeah ensuring the kill once the gate is open is sound strategy. Gates open? Sorry guy, tents going up. Your first hook? Double sucks for you guy, sorry.
---
Oh sorry. What was the point?
---
Ya but they'll be my monsters
---
Laurie.
---
It is a strategy, an effective strategy in a lot of situations but we frown upon it because it's fucking annoying, Leave me alone CANNIBAL
---
If I could have anyone, it‚Äôd have to be Jason Voorhees and Tommy Jarvis. But that‚Äôs probably never gonna happen lol Sam and Dean Winchester would be my next ideal survivors, maybe grown-up Andy and Chucky as a duo. I‚Äôd also love Pinhead and Harry Warden from my bloody Valentine as killers
---
Oh i thought that was Michael
---
Read the thread, anyways have a good day.
---
At least spirit doesn‚Äôt break the game.
---
‚Äústanding still at pallets is crutch and you‚Äôre garbage‚Äù
---
You're right, I just based this from a chat my cousin sent me.
---
Oh damn. 
---
So that means any uncleansed totem could activate this at gate power?
---
Sorry for asking what seems like a dumb question(still kind of new to the game).
---
Also is this a perk all killers get?
---
Which survivors do you have unlocked?
---
He should have hands down the most violent mori in the game, something simply horrific!
---
Is that how people get legacy in 2019, I knew it! That's how those really fast people had legacy!
---
damn why you gotta do him like that
---
It's not an IZ episode, it's from the new Netflix IZ movie Enter the Florpus.
---
All but,ash,Jeff,kate,tapp,and quentin
---
I have 1.2k hours on this game and I mainly play killer. I still did not know there was a difference between injured and healthy scratch marks lol
---
I would say poor girl, but it almost looks like she limited herself on purpose.  ü§î
---
Come join me, I switched sides. I‚Äôm now a memey pig main, it‚Äôs a lot less frustrating
---
How bad teammates are dude, obviously. Lol.
---
I remember them saying that old killers might be difficult but new ones will usually sync in a stream or the last AMA but can't seem to find it now so maybe my memory is failing me
---
I play both~ I play dbd while farming dungeons lol
---
Template without text pl0x
---
Damn I‚Äôm just blind
---
I can only be camped first thing in the match so many times before I *have* to let the kill know what theyre doing makes them a massive piece of shit.
---
Part of its usefulness is probably just getting on survivors nerves and peace of mind having a counter for powerful items. There are definitely better perks in most cases.
---
You can stop posting, seriously (considering this is your second post  within 60 minutes) . You don't have to post every single scoreboard where you have some weird matchmaking. 
---
If you look at this sub, there is at least 100 posts about matchmaking just in the last 30 days.
---
I didn't say it was a bug. I said it was an exploit.
---
BHVR is fixing it.
---
There‚Äôs no reason to argue with ignorance.

Also the ‚Äúsmall brain‚Äù comebacks make you seem like you‚Äôre about 7 years old.

And there‚Äôs no reason to argue with a 7-year-old either.
---
Have a good one!

I come from a land down under
---
Filthy Killer main
---
Would that technically make her a stepmilf?
---
Mindgames are usually 50/50. You don't know if Huntress gonna throw a hatchet on a pallet or just wildly swing, so it's 50/50. When Bubba is hiding his red light at loops, sometimes you have to guess where he is, 50/50.
---
I find it hard to believe it wasn‚Äôt programmed to work this way, since it has worked this way since Day 1.
---
Go into treatment, your charge counts as a m1, so you get the grab the frame they touch the hanging one
---
If its about the game he just had as Spirit, someone was accusing him of tunneling. Which i can say he wasnt. Reason the hate for him gets traction is because of people who post this kinda crap. At the end game chat they were talking mess about his game tactics and they were acting stupid. Ppl need to grow up n just play the freakn game. U win u lose. Move on.
---
survs toxic toxic survs but somebody talks about toxic killers?
---
Usually when I tell people how to play the game it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not utilising themselves in game 100%, and not getting as many points as they could potentially get. People think you are supposed to kill everyone as fast as you can. That‚Äôs not how the game works lol that is not beneficial for anyone including the killer.
---
You're completely right. I mainly play survivor, but when I play killer I will definitely tunnel if you're injured and the other person is not. It would be stupid not to, it's not like I want to handicap myself.
---
I play Nea - with the same hair cosmetic as the image above - and I defend the killer in chat when they get attacked unreasonably.
---
I'm switching to Kate in September though for her leaked biker outfit. I just have to finish getting the perks I want on her.
---
Plants deserve love too.
---
I didn't say it was a bug.
---
thats the point
---
Ok so joke explained guys, there is 3 guys and 1 female which means there is going to be some sort of sexual activity between the 4.
---
When l survivors say "git gud" it's okay when killers say "git gud" its "worthless" you're trash
---
Joey and susie could still be played without cosmetics I mentioned a change i had to the way cosmetics work on them but I do respect your opinion
---
There's a huge difference between nice and kind suggestions and red rank *screaming*. Good on you for being helpful to killers :)
---
You're doing the lord's work son. Had too many salty survivors this weekend. I just played to win. I'm sorry if that meant you didn't escape.
---
I literally uninstalled DBD because I hated playing against survivors so much and the only reason I got into DBD was because I love games that let you play as a creature that hunts down other players.
---
Message the mods through mod mail with proof on a steam screenshot and they should give you one!
---
Truth
---
Just... no. Balanced landing isn‚Äôt even something people complain about except on haddonfield, so maybe we should be changing the map, not the perk. Also BL would be equally as strong without the sprint burst on that map because you can still make it back to the windows.
---
I personally dont mind playing against hag or trapper.
---
Thomas the dank engine as the killer, obviously
---
We're all just farming bp for the Stranger Things chapter dropping ;)
---
Oh sweet baby Jesus, these are amazing, especially for doodles! Can we expect to see more from you? That'd be awesome.
---
ghostface detection still borked af
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate, but buying his raining blood skin gives an advantage because the streamers on his arms are gone and you can actually hide. Good map knowledge is also necessary, so you can know where the best spots are to sneak up on survivors and not be revealed so you can actually get the mark and a down. It‚Äôs not impossible, it just takes practice.
---
Ghostface is dogshit. If you want a good killer who can one shot, try Myers or Billy
---
Yes, as long as you can power through ruin for 1 gen relatively quickly.
---
I had 1 at the top of the stairs, 1 at the bottom, and 1 on that corner bit where people always put bear traps. Then 1 outside the window. When I realized they were all camping the shack and I couldn't leave without them unhooking I just gave up and used all my traps.
---
Out of those survivors, are there any that you've already leveled up?
---
Would you like to know why people keep telling you to go to the Wiki? Because it does have the information you seek, you simply didn't look for it well enough.
---
The Trivia section of the "Realms" article states quite clearly that one square tile covers an area of 8 by 8 metres. 8 metres is exactly the length of one segment of the walls that surround all Maps.
---
Searching for "tiles" in the Wiki's search bar would also have linked you to that information, it's really not difficult to find.
---
As for your question: even on the smallest Map, a completely maxed Terror Radius will at best cover about a quarter to a third of the Map's surface area. If you stand smack in the middle of The Game, the outer rooms will not have a Terror Radius.
---
You are obviously killer sided only. Which no one take your ideas about balancing this game seriously üòí. I don‚Äôt know which your rank at insta heals is yes unfair but just as many other things in the game that still doesn‚Äôt mean survivors are op and broken. As for the spirit it is really easy to buy a headset to her every signal sound many elite and good players also proved that spirit is broken she needs a nerf.
---
That's a bug. But yes it is possible
---
Everybody knows Jeff is the MVP
---
Maybe they‚Äôre just burning offerings?
---
Ok so spirit is one of my mains and I'm sorry, this just isn't true. If you see her stand still, stay away from walls, she will hug them to feel for you, same goes for pallets, pallets are not safe on spirit. 
---
You need to go somewhere that's both further away, and some somewhere she'll easily expect. I expect people to go to safe loops, or quick hiding spots, there are a lot of quick hoding spots to go to, so if i don't choose the right one out of like 10,then I'm basically fucked that chase. I do this to spirits all the time, she definitely has counter play, just not the same counter play as other killers.
---
my favorite reason to play this game is when you throw a pebble and watch the killer walk over to it, search around for a sec, then stare off into the abyss wondering wth happened here and then continue on with their day and then look back JUST to make sure then actually goes on with their day, I love the pebble build
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.

Laurie is level 2 lol
---
Oh I knew for 100% that I was going to be downvoted I just wanted to try and shed some light on something that maybe people don‚Äôt think about and I‚Äôm happy that someone else seems to think the same.
---
And like you said about the huntress if I can see that they aren‚Äôt downing anyone or just really struggling I will slow the game down a bit because just blowing through game isn‚Äôt going to help them learn but the biggest thing that I hate about this game is when I try to give actual criticism and help them out in chat and they take it the wrong way because that is just what everyone expects and it doesn‚Äôt them when the others survivors say ‚Äúoof‚Äù or something along those lines when I try to help.
---
I love this game but man the community really doesn‚Äôt help me continue to enjoy it sometimes.
---
But I do want to add I have ran into killers/survivors and had wholesome conversations about the game and what we could have done better. But that is very small percentage compared to the prior.
---
Looked at your profile, your drawings are amazing, u shuld keep posting moreee
---
I used to run into a lot of Docs to the point I always ran Calm spirit, now I realize he's doable without CS but so much easier, same with spine chill and Ghostface
---
Most played is I think what you meant. I played 5 survivor games last night and 4/5 had noed and got at least two people because of it. If you cant get people all game you dont really deserve 2 kills at the end.
---
Every killer in this game takes some measure of skill.
---
Claudette or jake
---
Umm. I hate to tell you this, but deja vu is widely considered the worst survivor perk in the game.
---
I had posted (got deleted by mod) survivors complain that I don't use chainsaw as Billy.
---
I'm like you complaining that i m1 too much??
---
I love you
---
Yeah that's true, i normally don't get smug or condescending advice, it's usually just people accusing me of cheating, calling me slurs, or saying I was camping/tunneling despite having all fresh hooks and not even patrolling hooked survivors
---
I said not that bad bc it has some use. I didnt say its good. Some perks are useless
---
Yes actually you should ALWAYS hit the non-injured person lol. The unhooked person could have DS, or dead hard, or the unhooker could have borrowed time, or it could be all 3 and itll take you the rest of your life to actually get them back on a hook. 
---
Plus that injured guy has like a 50/50 chance of wasting 32 seconds healing in a corner not being productive while you chase the unhooker.
---
I do get that, I'm newer to the game and have only been playing for about 3 months so I've only experienced a small amount of toxic gameplay compared to people playing for years. I just wish people wouldn't spread toxicity so much because it pushes people away especially newer players
---
Rank one with pig! Can confirm
---
Play Meg still, because you have a build for her. Use the blood points you get from playing meg, and level either Jake or David. Jake for iron will and calm spirit. David for dead hard and we're gonna live for ever.
---
:D
---
I love you too, fellow pig
---
Should do ace and go item hunting/gifting for a while to farm some bp
---
What's PGTW?
---
All it does is highlight 3 gens. Literally any other perk has more use, especially since you can find gens simply by looking up.
---
I got to rank 6 survivors for the first time this week and maybe rank 5 later in the week. I've had alot of time off so have been able to put in the effort :)
---
Also followed you on twitch and will try to watch you sometimes!

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cv9w1a/fox_the_exit_gate_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I had the best game an hour ago!  
---
The match started off pretty bad, playing against a P3 Nurse and me getting hooked twice (because of my own dumb actions). I eventually escaped and started doing gens, popped one with ruin by myself and then found the hex totem, so I cleansed it.  
---
At some point in the match one survivor died and the remaining two were hooked, so I saved the Meg and then snuck past the killer to unhook the Claudette. Unfortunately the killer came right back, so I took a hit for her and after a short chase (I'm not very good at looping yet) I got downed and then hooked, dying.  
---
I espectated the rest of the match and the Meg was able to pop the last gen and open the gates while the Claudette looped the killer, but instead of escaping she stayed to save her teammate. Both of them survived.
---
Currently if you want to run Deliverance it may be more beneficial to run Borrowed Time to get that sweet sweet safe unhook. Also I think I read somewhere that everyone will be exhausted if any gens being worked on is &lt; 50% for the current update of the Demogorgon perk. If that's true Dead Hard may be dead. In that case run DS to protect you after you Deliverance yourself
---
You can tell by the comments who the killer mains are that do this
---
Exact same thing happened to me, I guess us megs are just lucky. Also how did you get such good quality 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cdms34/couldnt_wiggle_heal_myself_or_recover_during_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Here is in my opinion the things a killer can do that makes it less fun:
---
* Camping. Keep in mind going after an unsafe unhook is not camping. Camping is when you refuse to leave the hook's proximity even after finding a survivor.
---
* Using a Mori
---
* Using Spirit or Nurse
---
That's about it. Keep in mind i don't curse at people using Nurse, i just think its not fun to play against.
---
Also i think slugging is fine. I'm never unhappy when a killer won't hook me lol
---
Tunneling but no camping is most often when one survivor of the team is really bad and keeps getting found over and over.
---
I had this one game where a dude watched his friend die because he thought I was camping them, I was in stealth mode as ghostface looking for him.
---
End of game match chat, I asked ‚Äúwhy did you let your friend die?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúBecause you were camping‚Äù (but with a lot more swears)
---
In reality I was looking for the hatch lol.
---
Oh that‚Äôs good, thanks! I‚Äôve never submitted a ticket before, how do I do that?
---
Me to my swf: just do gens and let me die, they get 1 kill it literally doesn‚Äôt matter
---
Is that a motherfucking   
---
   
---
#SMASH BROS REFERENCE?
---
Bill just pulls a shotgun and crowns the killer.
---
You know it
---
I am a survior main but completely agree
---
Just as pallet looping etc.
---
Well if we're talking playstyles it has to be a killer that doesn't tunnel or slug only and tries to mindgame, try their best and do unique plays. I'm personally fine with camping because I don't blame them when survivors rush hook 24/7 and I don't really care for camping it's just logical to do. I'm more so worried about how many BP I get then surviving so im more fine with alot more stuff then people that want to win as killers should be able to play how they want as how survivors should be able to play how they want
---
also ban hero
---
The meme says that the phrase "facecamping is a strategy" is a monstrous statement. So yeah, someone kind of did say otherwise.
---
I‚Äôm not a survivor main, but I enjoy playing a killer that doesn‚Äôt use lame builds. IMHO, stuff like gen grab spirit, iri huntress, NOED, moris aren‚Äôt fun to play against. It‚Äôs also why I don‚Äôt use that stuff on my killers (except for dailies) because I know they aren‚Äôt fun. Also, killers with potato internet and I die to lag is extremely irritating.
---
I‚Äôm not killer side only I‚Äôm sorry if I made it seem that way I play both but probably a little bit more of survivor. And if used correctly an double state insta heal ( the syringe) when used on a downed person by a teammate completely negates the whole chase you had to down a person so it can be very unfair at times, especially if there is multiple of them.
---
Just don‚Äôt get crit at 35 mid screen dude
---
There was [one time](https://youtu.be/ypzdicv-7dI?t=148) where I saved my friend with a flashlight at the end of the match by blinding Myers just as he hit Evil Within 3, and at the end of the game the killer was super nice and complimented me on running out and wrecking his shit up (his words). 
---
He always stuck out to me, and I try to be more like him when I play killer.
---
assuming every new player that comes into the game is toxic is more toxic.
---
just don't get magic bursted off-stage 20head
---
No. What a terrible idea.Balanced Landing is fine the way it is
---
Haddonfield is like my room, i know IT but still lose things
---
I agree with you but tbh i can't blame the Killer. The issue is the idiot at BHVR that decided to design the iri huntress addon and decided to leave it in game even thought everyone agrees its dumb.
---
Actually makes sense
---
Any other survivor is not Steve. Which makes them invalid.
---
This is perfect! You turned my all-time favorite meme format into a dbd meme. 10/10.
---
Just don‚Äôt gimped offstage because his up b has 55 active frames and instant ledge grab, you obviously just don‚Äôt know the matchup
---
Trappy boi pins a survivor to the ground with his cleaver, grabs survivor's neck and does the thing.
---
*wack*
---
billy is C imo
---
You just replied to yourself.
---
So you can use it on extreme situations such as being held hostage or bugged in the game, not because the match isn't going the way you want it to be. 
---
It is not that hard to understand this but troll people want to pretend the button is there to use it at will.
---
whether or not you think she should have a longer lunge as part of her Haunting has nothing to do with her basic attack lunge being the same as everyone else's which is what everyone is discussing
---
I couldn't agree more üëç
---
They‚Äôre adding punishments for people who constantly disconnect and leave. You need the option to leave the game in case you need to go do something IRL
---
i can feel the disappointment in that feng
---
If after 1400 hours you leave a match because your wife is pregnant and is about to give birth.... use that leave button
---
The issue is people with 0 respect for others that leaves games because of silly reasons like "The killer is a nurse" or "my diner is ready". Can't decide which of the two reasons is the most silly.
---
Yea I guess
---
yes.
---
Still that sucks

You don't always see bad ping with these players. Lobby shows fine ping but then their internet connection falls to pieces everytime a chase starts randomly and the insane spikes start happening.  And yes if you literally admit your internet is trash and choose to host games based off said connection it is your fault.  Lack of consideration to subject 4 players to your unstable connection that you know isn't up to the task of supporting host.
---
Why do Nea mains get hate again? Don't understand.
---
&gt; You spend hours EVERY fucking day on Reddit
---
lol this is a weird thing to say since I wasn't on yesterday almost at all
---
but okay (literally, by the way, you use reddit more than I do so omegalul)
---
tell yourself whatever you gave to and desperately ignore the rock hard proof I gave you
---
worthless cumstain
---
I am REALLY toxic believe me just having me is too much already
---
The fact is, for the most part, a Huntress has to follow a set of rules. Hitboxes are wacky cause they gotta be, but you can still win chases against her. If you get downed by a huntress because you threw the pallet while she was winding up, you lost the mind game and get the smacks. Spirit's 'mind games' aren't really based on similar paths to every other killer and aren't even mind games at all. Is she phasing or standing still? Who knows, you certainly don't, and survival at that point is a coinflip. You can hear huntress start to wind up in the loop if you know what to listen for, and you can extend a chase by not dropping a pallet because she'll walk slow enough that you can break LOS by the time she gets around.
---
neat
---
if you're gonna whine, whine on topic
---
I agree with almost everything you said (except the chase thing because maybe it's a bit toxic but I have no incentive to leave.  If they unhook the person I won't go after them but I'm also not gonna run across the map)
---
Only thing I disagreed with is Spirit or Nurse.  I don't find it fun but I also realize they're just playing what they like (and sometimes not even that!).  It's when they camp or tunnel as those that I really hate it because they already have a huge advantage and just abuse it even more
---
Miner? I hardly know her
---
I dont get the spirit hate, just run spine chill when she tries to mindgame, also fixated will probably be good against spirit
---
Good luck with them ever nerfing any of the top tier survivor perks. It took them 3 years to finally nerf DS. And from the day they announced that they were nerfing DS it took them 8 months to achieve that. Any kind of nerf to Dead Hard or Sprint Burst or Borrowed Time would either never happen or it would take them 2-3 years minimum to do.
---
I download the game clip to my computer via the Xbox companion app
---
No it wouldn't. This Is dbd not 3rd grade
---
Exactly. You explained it very well!
---
Or they just sat through 10 minutes of queue and loading to play a game and then didn't really get to play the game.
---
&gt; You need the option to leave the game in case you need to go do something IRL
---
I'd argue it depends on what that something is. If you end up leaving half your games for the most silly reasons that's not ok
---
Then what happened at the end
---
this hurts me personally
---
Ok, anf i escape against spirits and juke them all the time, i fight purple and red rank spirits, she's not broken, she's just strong. There's a reason higher ranked people often like playing against spirit, it's very possible, and it's a better challenge
---
BDSM Dewitt when?
---
Of course you're trash, you broke at least like 5 of the survivor's rules for the killer.
---
excuse me bat should have spikes on it absolutely ruined im quitting the game now
---
God, the day the pig came out I bought her, and haven't mained another killer since.
---
He‚Äôs just a whiny YouTuber who influences playerbase with clickbait like any other YouTuber would
---
I‚Äôve never met a single high rank survivor that likes playing against spirit, and if you can juke a spirit, she is just playing bad. There‚Äôs so many mind games you can play with spirit, and unless you Know for a fact you‚Äôll face a spirit, there‚Äôs no way you can bring specific perk counters
---
It's just a hat man... grow up
---
good job, looks good
---
Human***oid***
---
Its the one strategy that benifits no one
---
Thank you so much! I've had some trouble drawing since I've had zero inspiration since last year, but I had a blast drawing this.
---
And of course it's a bubba
---
Plus since Scott is making a movie and new game technically would make sense for it to happen
---
In my honest opinion a fun game whether it be survivor or killer side is 
---
-no purple/red items/add-ons for either side.
---
-no Mori cause there's no fun in ending the game in 10 seconds (unless ur punishing a toxic player)
---
-any killer is fun in my honest opinion
---
-no camping/tunneling/slugging cause it's not only unfun for survivors it's also bad strategies for the killer as well especially if you care about BPs
---
-no annoying perks that instantly turn the tide like NoED, honestly if I'm killer and I don't get any kills, I don't deserve them in the end therefore NoED is giving me kills I don't rightfully deserve just as if I'm a survivor and I'm letting everyone else do gens and I'm just hiding I don't deserve to survive the match.
---
-other than those key elements I find a good match where killer/survivors keeps me on my toes and the killer/myself gets anywhere from 2-4 kills but hooks everyone at least twice is fun.
---
They never said that. They said"humanoid" which demogorgon is. And it wasn't for lore reasons, it was for development reasons
---
Happy bubba noises
---
Two flashlights, two decisive strikes, two borrowed time, and an insta-heal medkit. This was a SWF looking to roflstomp a weak killer/player.
---
for killers: angela from sleepaway camp II, kayako from ju:on, sadako from ringu, sadakaya (their fusion from sadako vs. kayako) or obvious ones like pinhead or candyman
---
for survivors brenda and cindy from scary movie
---
We have a flower and DEMOGORGEN is shaped like a human but isnt and why cant we have a robot their shaped like a human and some creepy animatronics can really shake up the game and expand to different killers
---
Ah ok then my bad
---
He might want it for the bloodpoints
---
It looks has arms and legs stands on two legs sometimes so its humanoid and robots are humanoid too
---
I know, but when every match os the same the game gets old quick, but yeah he's not the hardesy to go up against... Just annoying.
---
I don‚Äôt tunnel people. I just go for whatever survivor I think I have the best chance at getting. If it‚Äôs the same person over and over then so be it. Except tea baggers. I‚Äôll tunnel and camp them. It‚Äôs fun.
---
All of Claud‚Äôs perks are decent. 
---
Nea also has BL and UE. 
---
Level ace and Quentin last.
---
One at the center of the platform before hitting the basement, one in the top corner before going downstairs and one between the pallet and the window. That‚Äôs all you need.
---
also given that i can choose anything, nancy from the elm street movies since we got robbed of that
---
I AM THE SENATE!
---
There is none. All tru3 does is whine and bitch if a survivor even tries to escape.
---
Well they broke that stupid rule aliens can be really scary and we're gonna get bored of human killers by saying why cant we just kill him or her and so a alien can put alot of fear in the game like a xenomorph
---
Right, running in circles around objects is so skill based. Survivors take so much skill compared to any killer.
---
Oh I actually hadn't heard that, nice!
---
I decided to dedicate to p3ing my feng min. Ik to don‚Äôt this night not be a big deal but feng has been my main for over a year and I‚Äôm really excited to start grinding for it :) then after feng I‚Äôm gonna go for Nancy and possibly Steve bc they are amazing!!!
---
I used to watch him. Now I can‚Äôt stand him, which is very sad considering he‚Äôs good, but god his attitude and entitlement.
---
Well you can look up true talent, he's a much better survivor than both of us and he's even more on the "spirit is totally not broken" train, he also enjoys going against her, my perma rank 1 friend is the same. People who DC or just say she's broken and do the same stuff against her aren't going to get any better. I implore you to play her for a while and see how people lose you, you may need to get to higher ranks, but it really isn't hard to juke a spirit. Good spirits are scary, yes, but they still have plenty counter play
---
Dont we have flairs like ‚Äúmeg‚Äù and dwight, i have seen someone in steam saying it. I also prestiged my meg on 3rd august 2016

Yeah but fnaf should not be added at all it will make  the community more toxic even more than it already is

Youll get it eventually. Only takes me around ten minutes to get the timing right usually
---
lmao
---
oh no basic items and meta perks??? what bullies! OMG!
---
anyone who tries at all is a 4 man bully SWF pls leave daddy alone
---
My first public match as Killer (I had played several times before in KYF) I played Doctor and was walking around doing my thing, first survivor I came across was a Meg that didn't seem to know what they was doing, kept walking and looking in my direction until I hit them, didn't even have Sprint Burst, they seemed really slow to notice me and so I, for the most part, left them alone, only injuring them to back her off the gens because they realized my shocks weren't killing them.
---
I wanted to give them hatch because I felt terrible that going up against a Doctor may very well be the first game they've gone into, but the other three survivors stopped showing up when they three-genned themselves, so I ended up killing them and then the other three one by one.
---
Post-match I messaged the Meg and told them I wanted to give them hatch but I couldn't find anyone else, they thanked me for trying at least.
---
&gt; Only thing I disagreed with is Spirit or Nurse. I don't find it fun
---
Your question was what "What makes a fun Killer?"
---
I agree they are allowed to play whatever killer they want, but for me facing those 2 is not fun.
---
hmu with those "I CALLED FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDYS AT 3 AM AND THE ANSWERED (NO CLICKBAIT)" videos as well as all that juicy anamatronic furry porn and tell me this deserves to be in the game
---
Having a weeping angel type killer would be cool but Freddy is a bear, not humanoid at all, and yes I know about the bloody Demogorgon
---
A few hours but know that I didn't do the animation itself, it's ported from Fortnite, plz don't be mad üëÄ
---
Um, no? Have you ever looked at the playercount? It's far from dead, and this new DLC will boost the playerbase by a lot.
---
Steve got his scoops outfit.....nuff said, ahoy for ya boy
---
It‚Äôs only unbalanced if they run Balanced Landing. But yeah if they burn it then that usually means they are. Even worse is when they ALL have balanced, might as well DC.
---
Teabagging a myers is litteraly the worst thing you can possibly do against one
---
The incredibly aggressive and bold behaviour against the killer is what he's referring to. That's what it means to bully a killer, when everyone's just up in the killers face trying to get his attention  and stuff like that.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even call that tunneling. My definition of tunneling is going after one specific person past other logical choices. My friend gets tunneled all the time....I‚Äôve had killers literally pass me up while i was injured to go after my buddy who is at full health, didn‚Äôt break a totem, didn‚Äôt BM, etc...
---
Basically..it‚Äôs tunneling when you go after someone when easier prey is within your grasp. Sure...it‚Äôs not against any rules...by why would you pass someone who is injured or in front of your face for a harder target?....To tunnel because you‚Äôre salty for some reason.
---
A good Michael is terrifying I feel, even if he's a bit simple.
---
I tried looking online and couldn't find it and that's  good, Thanks
---
Yeah plus its a wasted item and to get a flashlight save you have to stop doing gens
---
That's what they all say...
---
Honestly I would want those rip off Chucky cheese animatronics but wouldn't it feel clunky playing as them considering they are literally robots wouldn't William afton(purple guy) be a better fit since he well killed children then robots looking for revenge?
---
I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt play Hag more. She‚Äôs so strong when you aren‚Äôt putting 5+ traps around one hooked guy and running at them like a potato. Like, this was how I became a Hag main, just played her over and over and fell in love with her. Hag has that satisfaction of Gotcha that only her, Freddy with Pallets and Trapper can give you. Just watching someone run like a maniac to a pallet only for you to rotate behind them and watch them throw the pallet, vault over it and just get grabbed while you stand there. 
---
Sadly I know people who are still learning Hag or only playing her for Ruin will miss those subtle moments.
---
It's always the insidious Bubba's
---
Maybe for awhile but I can see it get super frustrating quickly
---
Really hope the demogorgon's terror radius is something like this "[https://youtu.be/vqffY-6OVKc?t=149](https://youtu.be/vqffY-6OVKc?t=149)"
---
Yes, Surge and Surveillance should work together, any generators not immediately being worked on should pop up white, while the ones being worked on will either be yellow or red, depending on how they decide to work that.
---
Whats exactly a toxic killer? I mean, that survivor is clearly trying to get you mad by t bagging and flashlight clicking, sometimes even gestures but a killer cant do any of that. Also, tunneling is a decent strategy if you want to get someone out of the match as fast as possible so you will have only three survivors and of course, gen rushing as a survivor is also a good strategy. The only thing I can think about a killer being toxic is facecamping, and while I agree that its a shitty thing that isnt fun for anyone survivors can still take advantage of this and just repair generators
---
Playing aggressively is bullying? That's new. When people do this it just makes it easier to kill them because they're usually incredibly altruistic and don't focus on gens.
---
saw a dude with the purple toolbox that doesn't unlock sabotage but with two parts added for sabotage speed
---
I‚Äôm not talking about mindlessly running in front of the killer though.  Most of the time if the killer is close to the hook when a survivor is pulled off it‚Äôs more beneficial to hit the unhooker because it causes pressure to more survivors and then it‚Äôs usually just as easy to go after the new survivor as the previously unhooked one.  Also let‚Äôs not kid ourselves, DS is a 5 second stun sure, but depending on the killer and how determined they are, 5 seconds does NOT mean you‚Äôre safe.  Especially if there are no pallets around or you‚Äôre against a hillbilly/nurse/spirit etc.
---
Personally as a mainly survivor player I find a fun killer to be someone who doesnt camp or tunnel, and can make good plays. It's honestly a little boring to take killers on 3 or 4 gen walks, and I find it fun to be looping and then they make an outplay and get a hit off on me because I can respect that they're good.
---
That‚Äôs wayyy to many power ‚Äúplus that‚Äôs not how zenomorphs work lol‚Äù
---
Even so default Susie and Joey are both cosmetics and people have bought them, it would also suck to have to buy 4 sets of cosmetics for one killer
---
Well the bloodhunt is happening soon so I'd say on Laurie as you'll have more then enough for the new dlc because of it
---
I see it in like 10% of my games
---
I play spirit because she's spooky and cool, and survivors can literally die mad about it :)
---
plus his traps are way easier to fuck with
---
I dislike how Hag's messes with the camera a lot and how cartoony it looks (pulling organs out of nowhere).
---
Top-tier should be Doctor/Spirit/Ghostface/Freddy/Pig/Legion
---
Nurse and Clown are probably A-Tier, Nurse's choking isn't that interesting and Clown's is just vaguely gross, Plague can go here too since hers is actually shocking.
---
Why would anyone nerf a perk that's only good if a maximum of two people are running it?
---
Hag also has limited movement speed, drawbacks and has to setup traps to counter pallets, loops, etc.
---
Spirit and Nurse just press M2 and phase around the map at high speed.
---
My survivor path is a true small brain-galaxy brain development, I'd say: Claudette to Laurie to Ash.
---
What rank? On console?
---
Well make a spin off alien I guess but would be cool for a xenomorph maybe climbing over windows climbing on walls and leaping off and screeching the like demegorgen is already strong enough
---
I agree that removing the chat entirely is **not** the solution.  People are simply untrained in being civil, and removing the chat is not going to fix that.  Also, I enjoy being able to give feedback or simply thank specific survivors or, hell, even the killer, for awesome stunts pulled.  Additionally, I notice that, when I act normal, other people are more inclined to be normal too.
---
A toggle in settings might not be bad, I guess?  If you really want it?  Our main problem is people being dicks and that has nothing to do with the game.
---
Glen from Nightmare on Elm Street. Nancy would be good too.
---
Sidney from Scream. 
---
Columbus or Texas. From ZombieLand 
---
Sally Hardesty from Texas Chainsaw Massacre
---
Sam and Dean Winchester.....
---
Again rank 1 and ps4
---
Start with meg, she has some of the best perks, namely adrenaline and sprint burst, run thst with spine chill and you have a pretty meta build.
---
Hex: Ruin.
---
Though it will only slow your game down just a little bit.
---
In all seriousness, it depends.
---
If you're going for literal slowing down, Dying Light or Thanatophobia might work, if you're going for metaphorical, Overcharge or Huntress' Lullaby can work pretty well with a perk like Unnerving Presence, if you're running any Hex short of Haunted Ground, don't head to your totem right away.
---
Level up David to get we‚Äôre gonna live forever, the extra bloodpoints make your life easier. After that  I would suggest bill to get borrowed time to make getting we‚Äôre gonna live forever stacks easier. After that you can go after any survivor you want, borrowed time and we‚Äôre gonna live forever just makes your life much easier.
---
That's someone's first time running a key... I remember thinking a broken key would work for hatches too, at least I didn't waste any add-ons though.
---
The only problem is when playing solo it makes it hard to get all 5 totems by yourself. You have to hope you have a good team every match
---
Oh ps4 maybe. Things sound really wack on console.
---
It really isn't though because he used the wrong word.  There's no chasing involved.  Here's how it plays out.  Unhooked approaches hook, you hit them, they unhook during blood wipe animation, you recover and hit the unhooked a 2nd time before they could even take 2 steps away from the hook.  Works everytime and  hard counters Borrowed Time.  A hooked survivor is a hooked survivor.  Too many players fall into the trap of assuming they need the guy that was just on there again.
---
i mean its more that legion is just bad
---
Sharing a blunt with his nasty dirty fat fuck ass? I'll pass on that
---
&gt;just run spine chill when she tries to mindgame
---
Mkay let me just change my loadout mid-game real quick..
---
No, that's a different 1v4 game. :P
---
Seriously. Netease mad a 1v4 Tom and Jerry game. It's... Actually pretty fun and cool, it's 2d with different mechanics and all beyond the basics of "4 (Mice) try to do objectives without getting caught and trapped on something."
---
You just wasted a key?
---
U shouldnt say that...
---
Whats ur rank?
---
STOP IT YOUR HURTING MY FEELINGS
---
oh you mean the mortal sin of pot/substance abuse, i thought u meant cigarettes
---
Rank 1 pc
---
[Tssdkak noises]
---
Lol, i guess i did good on him then.
---
One thing you can do vs Huntress to remova a lot of the counterplay is dropping the pallet early
---
My school started like a while ago lmao
---
This isn‚Äôt a bad idea but what the actual hell would he do, exactly? The animatronics don‚Äôt actually have any powers, they‚Äôre just robots.
---
And u dont see deja vu in thise gen rush games never. Okay then
---
Fine you win :(
---
Fuck's he gonna do? Bite my head?
---
Incorrect. Plenty of science out there backing this up, too. The China Study by Dr. Campbell being one of the best sources, as it is a mass population study. Those who didn't eat meat or dairy were the ones with no heart disease and no cancer.
---
So I'm new too, but I always do heavy research on ANY game with perma-progression.  
---
David King is THE FIRST you should level up to get his perk WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER since it can DOUBLE your earned bloodpoints at rank 3 if you use it right and is the first teachable he learns at lv 30 so not that bad.
---
Claudette is a close second as she has a teachable perk that allows you to heal yourself! Definitely a must in a lot of builds but takes longer to get than David's perk which is why i level him up first. 
---
But since you got David now, his perk will show up on Claudettes web and once you learn it you can get those bonus BP's with her now while working on getting her to 30/35/40 for her perks.
---
Once you have those two abilities try to find an ability that causes EXHAUSTION but gives you a speed boost or evasion and slap em on litearly any character you want.
---
I am currently leveling up David to 30 with Claudette at 15 and the char I want their perks to go on (Ash) I'm keeping at 15 until I'm able to have both teachables show up.
---
GLHF!
---
Spirit has a cool down on her power unlike most killers, and she's already 110% movement speed
---
People's version of fair in this game typically involves being able to bully a killer, and if you can't easily Malia killer with a two-person Survivor team and that killer must be broken
---
Someone This Thread line was unironically talking about Bubba as if he was even remotely balanced saying that there is mind games with him. If you ever get hit with a Bubba's chainsaw you probably are in green ranks lmao
---
Epic lol
---
Me like Noob Stompers
---
I was playing with a friend with the chest perk so we found it ingame
---
We have double BP coming at the first weekend of September so expect a lot of farming.
---
CAMPING: Camping is when a killer is still somewhere on the map after hooking a survivor
---
Nope. Literally never seen it used at rank 1 in my 950 hours of playtime. Rank 1 killer also btw. People mainly use exhaustion perks, iron will, spine chill, d strike, deliverance, and borrowed time.
---
Maybe it's for Balanced Landing? Or the loud aesthetics are supposed to be edgy or annoying?
---
Shh. Don't give them ideas.
---
Appreciated!! Amanda needs more love
---
Thank you so much!
---
A good build for a beginner would be
---
Quick and quiet 
---
Adrenaline 
---
Iron will or borrowed time
---
Dead hard
---
No, but if you are thinking to go to pc so you can cheat there... then yes, you can cheat on xbox, plz do it there
---
I used to explicitly avoid tunnelling, but then I realized it's much easier to hit the Survivor you see than hunt for a new one.
---
I usually do one in the middle of the upper staicase
---
Appreciated, thank you! üêñ
---
I‚Äôve always had it described to me as going for the person who is injured in spite of easier, uninjured prey. It sounds like there‚Äôs no agreed upon definition. What you described sounds like it‚Äôs so specific of a scenario I can‚Äôt imagine that it can occur without some inciting incident. Idk. I think the word Toxic has become so bandied around that it has lost all meaning tbh. 
---
___
---
But I probably just have been described Tunneling incorrectly and I would definitely call what you described as BM.
---
Spirit: *teleports behind u*
---
For me it's not about how ridiculously strong they are or the fact that against a really strong Spirit player there is very little counterplay I'm at peace with both of those things.  What I find disgusting about this killer is how many players choose her and proceed to tunnel survivors off hook into the ground with her.  At least on PS4 the vast majority of Spirits phase back to every hook immediately to rehook the same survivor.  Happens constantly and there is extremely little they can do about the situation.  Decisive but that's it.  They're dead otherwise.  Just a very crutched out approach to playing a top 2 killer in the game and they do it through red ranks.
---
GO FOR IT!!
---
Just run distortion with it
---
Playing five games in a row against prayer beads spirits is tiring, you know? You wanna have fun playing the game? Well so do survivors. And let me tell you, PB Spirit is the exact opposite of fun to play against.
---
üêΩ
---
she *can* counter iron will, doesnt mean most spirits *will*. Stridor is absolutely garbage, almost no one is going to run that perk to counter Iron Will.
---
Are any of the game characters toxic? They‚Äôre just assets, and as much as people may prefer one over another with the way the blood webs work they‚Äôre all pretty much the same. All the ‚Äúneas are toxic‚Äù ‚Äúclaudettes are immersed‚Äù is just people finding a target for their salt. I‚Äôve had plenty shitty ash players on my team before.
---
That is bs tbh
---
Thank you kind stranger ‚ù§Ô∏èüêΩ
---
What‚Äôs bs?
---
how many times do i gotta say this, it is a strategy, just not a good one
---
amy issue with this is i thought i did it twice and then took 2 more games to get another one and i checked at the end for it to say 0/3....its hard enough to get a normal exposed considering its so easy to break him out with the 3rd person fov or just run spine chill to always know when he's looking at you
---
üêñüî™
---
Did you ever play against mirror myers on that map?
---
Well, i played as mirror myers like 100 times, and that is the second best map for that...
---
You only walk faster when not injured
---
Fixation, Inner Strength, Detective's Hunch, Spine Chill
---
How the fuck do you say qwq
---
&gt;Spirit has no counterplay. 
---
With a mix of unpredictability and Iron Will, you can siphon off a lot of Spirit‚Äôs advantages. It won‚Äôt reduce her to being a 110 M1 killer but to say she has 0 counterplay is a very weak argument. She‚Äôs just strong and that‚Äôs perfectly fine.
---
I doubt as a new player adrenaline will have the same benefit as some of the good players that make it to the end. That's a perk slot OP may only use 1 in 5 games as a new player. Maybe 1 in 10 if his team is bad as well.
---
what they listenin to
---
Deja vu thing
---
Sad thing is how close that is to being true. Not in DbD, but Identity V is RIFE with facecamps because it never got rid of infinites.

It really isn‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt really have a huge selection of perks when you only go against nurses and spirits 90% of the time.

That is the only time I choose to do it. Toxic survivors get a toxic play from me lol

This would be the only DLC I actually consider buying, tbh.

They didn't break any rules "humans only" was never a rule
---
I watched this game on his stream, the group was honestly just very good. There wasn‚Äôt any bullying going on. Probably just a clickbait for yt
---
Yes it is but that doesnt make mirror myers good. He‚Äôs easily loopable once you find him. His advantage is catching people off guard.

Hammer is a valid option!

There are way more threads just from searching "facecamp why" but I am too lazy to grab all of them. Maybe in the next thread asking this I might do it.
---
Gen rushing is the counter. If all 3 other survivors realize this, they can basically get all the gens done once the camped survivor dies.
---
You gotta look at it as time they are wasting, and not get upset. If some idiot decides to t-bag at every pallet that‚Äôs time they‚Äôre wasting not running away from me.
---
Nice! The dark around the eyes is a good touch that doesn‚Äôt always get done.
---
I dunno man I just work here.
---
A mummy would be so cool
---
Yeh, and that is why a mirror myers (that is not stupid) wont chase someone. Just never do that
---
&gt; Unhooker approaches hook, you hit them, they unhook during blood wipe animation, you recover and hit the unhooker a 2nd time before they could even take 2 steps away from the hook. Works everytime  
---
Unless you're actually not camping and you're going toward the hook, being too far away from it to hit the unhooker earlier
---
Well deserved upvote
---
heres the basic start. look for a character your want to use for the looks it does not matter who since they are all just skins in the end. once your know who your going to want to use, you need to level up two or three other survivors to lvl40 to get their teachable perks the survivors are meg, cladette, and the last one is whoevers perks you would like to use. start with cladette since she has self care which will help you get good at skill checks and heal without a medkit and use her until you get the other 2 lvl40. after the 3 are lvl 40 get the survivor you want to play to lvl50 and make sure you get self care, sprint burst, adrenaline, and the other perks you wanted from you 3rd choice. with this you got a basic start with some good perks that wont take you to long to get on the character you want to play. 
---
some good 3rd choices are laurie for DS to help you against campers and tunnelers, david for dead hard a really good chase perk, and  dwight for leader and bound if your trying to know and work with other survivors. there are others but like i said the choice is yours.
---
there is a lot of grinding in this game and your going to be frustrated at first but once you get good perks the game becomes easier since perks are what this game is balanced around along with the killers. this should take you a day or two to get done. keep in mind that after you get into rank 10-15 you will face better killers but will also get teamed with better survivors meaning you dont have to worry about your team not knowing what they are doing.
---
You can't dribble DS anymore.
---
Well still if it is true its dumb and let's see what other monsters we can get in the game
---
The fact that he doesn't do the dance anytime he lands a chainsaw hit or when revving if standing still tells me he's not authentic in DbD, either.
---
Real fans remember 2.
---
This has nothing to do with DBD but you should've seen how fast I could type on the PS3 with it's controller back in the day
---
i wish you could do this for killers too üòî
---
It depends. Sometimes a survivor pissed them off, sometimes they just want the game to end if it‚Äôs gone on too long. But if it‚Äôs not that then they‚Äôre just annoying and don‚Äôt really know how to play the game
---
how dare survivors play an active, engaging, exciting style.
---
going for flashlight saves? fucking toxic dood
---
I prefer a good billy. Billy can be looped but a skilled billy can make those awesome sharp turns and down you. Basically the majority of loops feel like both sides have a fair chance. Nurse removes all chances of looping and Spirit for the most part does too, especially if they use the very broken prayer beads.
---
My tip? Just don't tunnel. Not only is it bad for you to focus on one survivor, as the others can easily do gens in the meantime, it also ruins the game for that specific player. Sure, sometimes they're dumb and run into your arms after getting unhooked, but I recommend you target all survs equally, which also gives you (and the others) tons of BP! 
---
Another small thing is to try not to stay close to hooked survivors (unless you are certain that someone is nearby) if you want to rank up, as it gives you a serious penalty for the sacrifice category
---
Oh poor killer can't do gesture all he can do is END YOUR LIFE üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Dead hard on nurse
---
Jeff/Feng are the best.  I love their perks and they have good fashion.  Jeff is my main dude though.  I don‚Äôt care that he‚Äôs a loud guy, he‚Äôs the best.
---
If we ignore the joke, maybe it‚Äôll go away one day.

"Please God."

Good joke.

But if you'll allow me to be pedantic for just 2 seconds, I'd wager that in the entity's realm normal chili would actually be vegan from an ethical standpoint. It's not like there are an abundant supply animals (or people in Sawyer's case) there to kill for it. It's just premade chili synthesized from nothing identical to animal or human flesh. Nothing inherently non-vegan about that.
---
Unpopular opinion, Sprint Burst is the best exhaustion perk. Merely for the fact that it allows you to use it on demand (even whilst running if you play around the Exhaustion cooldown). You always get to run to a safe loop, regardless of what area you're in, whereas with any other exhaustion perk you'll take a hit or get downed depending on the killer.
---
I couldn't quite believe it! He pretty much sealed both of their fates
---
I feel that. But when you do well, it‚Äôs so satisfying.
---
Well, the Claudette one is because she has the most cosmetics that make her blend in and become really hard to see.
---
You're right. Going from an unhook into Borrowed Time, escaping with Decisive, and getting instant healed is perfectly fine and balanced. What was I thinking?
---
Why tho?
---
(laughs in premonition and spine chill)
---
The physics on Meg's new cosmetic is amazing for this
---
Swing Chains is the best add-on imo. Then the ones that slow down progression in the dreamworld are pretty helpful as well (Outdoor Rope and Jump Rope) as the add-ons that reduce the cooldown of your teleport as more survivors enter the dreamworld (Nancy's Sketch and Nancy's Masterpiece).
---
Dream pallets addons are great as well but it depends if you want to sacrifice an addon slot for it or not.
---
&gt; Like the vegan chick who tried to climb a mountain to prove vegans were just as strong and healthy, but she died because she wasn‚Äôt strong or healthy.
---
You don't genuinely believe this to be relevant to the conversation right, considering plenty of non-vegans died en route before her. For your sake I hope not.
---
&gt;That too but I doubt he was able to expose every surv, I'm sure a bit of it was lost due to chases lasting way too long considering the length of the match, unless everyone just hid
---
Even if chases lasts longer than a minute (would be the lowest scoring you can get), you can compensate it by landing a lot of M1s and easily get Iridescent Chaser.
---
Yamaoka can burn in hell. Both survivor and killer.
---
once you've escaped on every existing way all you do is trying to find new ways, specially when killer is a camper or a troll. Trolls get trolled
---
At least you get useful perks.
---
yeah survivors should not have any good perks that synthesize well for strong plays 
---
what was i thinking
---
Didn't mean it to be! I'm sorry
---
oh wow! haha
---
Haddonfield for both sides as it's just if you don't have balanced landing your screwed if you're in a building but if you do it's too easy and killer it's obvious why. Rotten fields also as it's just too big as a map 
---
,If they made it smaller I would enjoy the map more.
---
whats worse, a baby dwight failing a skill check and then hiding in a closet? Or a baby meg failing a skill check and running off, revealing the generator even more with scratch marks
---
Dream Warriors was peak Elm St. It established the final set of rules from which everything started crumbling. Everyone has LIMITED control of their own dream worlds in the form of dream powers, Freddy feeds on fear but can empower himself with the souls of those he kills despite being possible to physically combat, networking dreams is possible, but a rare talent, and while the ending got dumb with Super-Skeleton and everything after, it's neat that the only Dream Warriors he could defeat were the ones who had fears he could play on.
---
ah yes i forgot
---
Not OP but [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/1HcVkw9.jpg) for you.
---
Possibly less because of other aura-reading perks.
---
Most likely this Tuesday
---
How does it feel to be wrong?
---
I'm not saying it's toxic, no one is. And they weren't all trying to take the agro off the injured teammate. They were looking to try and bully him because it looks to me they thought they were better than him.
---
This is why TF2 maps can't be added to DbD
---
It's fair and balanced
---
If windows acted as an absolute wall against lunges, the game would be unplayable at lower, even mid ranks for Killers. Windows would basically be infinites again. Vaulting speed would have to drop.
---
Yea, with rank reset I'm getting higher level survivors in my matches. I have a basic build of BBQ, I'm All Ears, Thrilling Tremors, and Iron Maiden, I don't have any other killer DLCs so my perks are kind of limited. Despite not having the most meta perks I still was able to win most of my matches, but as a rank 16 with survivors at a much higher skill level due to the reset, I'm constantly getting looped and my ability broken. The survivors actually clump up on me so that they are so close by when I down one, the rest are constantly on me making it incredibly difficult to stalk them (as you have to be out of their sight first). At that points he's completely m1 with nothing to help when having literally every pallet on the map thrown down on him. I'm not going to leave my main but it's kind of sad to think that as I progress I'll be forced to buy the rest of the DLC to get the meta perks I need to even stand a chance. I wasn't there when they first released GF but I agree that they buffed him well. At this point however, they need to reduce his ability cool down and fix the garbage perks we got. Thrlling and Ears aren't too bad but Furtive Chase is literally pointless. I've seen several posts asking for Devs to explain why it was even added with no one ever responding. The most use you can get with it is by using it as a synergy perk. I can improve my skills with GF and he's definitely a high tier killer with his ability, but he needs to be changed because the incredibly long cool down limits mind games and your effectiveness as a killer, essentially making you a generic m1 and eating pallets for every meal of the day.
---
100% agreed. Not the most unbalanced map, but for sure the least fun map whether I‚Äôm playing survivor or killer.
---
worst thing about it is that it was thrill of the hunt...............
---
Every streamer I've seen cover it has said it's going to be meta, and I can see why, it's a double speed heal without wasting someone else's time, up to 5 uses in a match, easy trigger, undetectable, and uncounterable most of the time. Sloppy butcher and healing speed debuffs don't apply, and it's an easy combo with DS, quick and quiet, or head on.
---
Also, unbreakable and deliverance are only good if one or two people run it, but they're still great at reducing killer pressure. I'd even go so far as to say this is useful even if an entire team runs it, because you can hold on to the activation and it provides such a strong benefit. It can save minutes in survivor efficiency if everyone just uses it once.
---
It depends on what rank your at the beginning rank is the easiest to fake doubling back it gets harder as the ranks go by but try to mind game people as hard as you can and get a hit in the or one hit them if there marked
---
"Outstanding Move"
---
It's a everyday thing when you're a Legion main :(
---
Nah I‚Äôd like to chill with the doctor
---
Now find the hatch.
---
I wouldn't want to because he has a track record of being a very unstable individual capable of kidnapping and torture. So yeah, I'll pass
---
Meh, i don't want them to remove killer's red addons, none of them and i speak from survivor's side.
---
I can't see that meme without thinking in the "¬øquieres pene'" one
---
Kinda true, if I see 2 people at the start of a game and 1 is Adam, I‚Äôll go for Adam every time because he‚Äôll usually be running deliverance.
---
But imagine if Hag and Freddy got a tiny lunge.
---
They should just animate Freddy's arm stretching to match his hitbox, honestly.
---
More of these coming?
---
As a Survivor I don't like meat plant and as a Killer I don't like the Yamaoka Estate because it's every Claudette's wet dream. I love Lery's Memorial no matter what role I'm playing.
---
What makes a great experience for me are Killer characters who are really unique (in perks), creative (in cosmetics) and Killer players who are engaged and unpredictable.
---
I especially appreciate Killers with perks that make sense together and tell a story (e.g. Iron Grasp on a brute, or a Hexes on a magical fantasy Killer), because it means actually solving a unique set of circumstances and getting to play out a truly unique horror story, win or lose.
---
A Killer player being "engaged"  is subjective, but to me it's them having situational awareness and playing real mindgames with you. They don't have tunnel vision, they're good at splitting up groups, and when they see you, it feels like they are really playing WITH you. It feels "personal" but in a fun, exciting way, because they show confidence that they will be able to thrill and scare you.
---
Also, using their special ability! There's nothing worse than going against a player who is too afraid to use their special ability. The best Killers have amassed such practice with their ability that playing against them is formidable (like Huntresses with clean aim), so practice and take risks!
---
No need to be a dick about it
---
yeah downvote me its not like im new to the game or anything
---
Why would anyone run babysitter over borrowed time?
---
There is an entire game being made, Scott is making a multiplayer horror game that probaly functions like DBD
---
You should play against me. I'm terrible but I love the feeling of suddenly appearing and scaring the living daylights out of people when I can manage it. I've had several people escape me. It's fun though.
---
wtf! lmao
---
I‚Äôll try that
---
First of all, there's no need to be an ass about it and throw insults. And no, they were all just hanging around him. Did you see how just about the entire match went on in one area? That's because tru3 didnt have a reason to leave, why? Because they all hung around like right next to him. And just because I agree it was bullying does not mean I think it is toxic. Do not pull words out of my mouth.
---
I get that
---
Must be a new Doctor addon
---
Except spine chill has more uses than you'd think. You can talk shit all day about spine chill users but it's actually a good perk
---
said no one ever
---
For pig Play with your Food is amazing. You can dash attack the obsession and not lose stacks

Hey which one did you choose?

Im jealous cauz in my country its not released ;-;
---
How about you try not to be a toxic asshole who throws insults at anyone who disagrees with you? Thanks. And no, I don't agree it's toxic. But I do agree it's bullying. So next time let's not assume I'm an extension of tru3 and recognize I may not agree on everything with him.
---
Just "verify cache" in steam to undo it.
---
Allow me to introduce myself
---
How do I do that
---
They are all in the tutorial page
---
what?
---
Agreed. And flashlight saves are ALWAYS a killer's fault. If you're not aware of your surroundings and can't position yourself well, is it survivors' fault?
---
Not worth it. You'll exhaust yourself grinding. Plus there's plenty of teachables you should be going for instead. Regardless if you use that character. Once you get every perk you'll ever need. Maybe, maybe then you should prestige if you spend countless hours playing this game to make it even worth it. The bloody cosmetics are cool, but that's an obsessive grind if anything. Don't set yourself up. 
---
If u do prestige, at least have 1Mill BP'S to minimize the grind. Not worth it....
---
demo are always free. It's not a gift. In addition we play PTB mainly to have a clean release with most bugs removed.
---
Having to play games without winning any BP isn't encouraging.

You can probably skip step 1 (restarting the computer), I've never had to do that.
---
He could become an extra survivor
---
Wait til you get to part 5...you'll never reach the truth
---
Everytime I get that loadout I'll just face a corner til gens are powered and then open a door once powered. The survivors will get really shitty points, then they will come back and complain that if I was gonna be nice I could have farmed. My only response is that when you have a group with BL and burn a Haddonfield offering, I just assume you don't want to have any actual interaction regarding chases.
---
The Pig is what got me into the game in the first place
---
Wait is there some sort of meme where Ash players are seen as really good? Because all the Ashs I've played with have died first and can't loop at all. Also, I agree. I've mained Claudette since release because she's the first one I got all the perks with and I just stuck with her, but I'm the exact opposite of immersed. I'm always the one who loops the killer and keeps them busy while others do Gens. Of course, it's gonna be goodbye Claudette and hello Scoops Ahoy Steve when the new chapter comes out.
---
I‚Äôm on part 4 rn but am really excited for part 5
---
Exactly
---
since your going to lose the majority of games as a new player you might as well use SC since people dont usually heal you and the perk helps you get better at skill checks.
---
Based on what pretty much everyone has said I'm not going to prestige, and focus on getting other killers to 40 before the bloodweb changes.
---
*should
---
In one of the dev streams, they said they were brightening up her darker outfits.
---
I hear people say things like that but I hate indoor maps. (Lery's/The Game) I can't find any pallets on the maps and so I usually die right away. I don't think I have ever burned a Lery's or Gideon offering
---
Acid blood is like spirit fury on roids lol
---
I wonder if  there‚Äôll be any snotty comments saying ShEs FrOm JiGsAw
---
 \- I think that  Furtive Chase was added to swap obssesions. It works well with dark devotion, thus when someone saves your previous obssession of the hook, you hit the rescuer who has just become a new obbsession, and he runs away carring 32m terror raduis with him ( thanks to dark devotion).
---
 Other than that it's a useless perk.
---
\- You forgot to mention how ridicilous it is to let hooked and downed survivors reveal the ghostface.. Like.. They're out of the game, they don't do anything. They got a free time on their hands, so the only enterteinment for them is to try to reveal you. 
---
 It is ridicilous that i have to hide from downed/hooked survs in order to keep my ability active.
---
\- "I'm all ears" is very strong when used by Nurse. It's the reason of such a huge cooldown.
---
\- "Thrilling Tremors" could be a good perk, if it wasn't for a cooldown (It shouldn't be in the first place).
---
 Long story short - GF is very weak.  
---
And i don't understand why this discussion is the first one since June. Like.. I check reddit or steam disscusions to see people complaining about GF, but no one asks for a buff. It looks like everybode just quited playing him.
---
Niceee
---
Spirits worst map is Lery's, ridiculous amount of safe windows, which is her biggest weakness. Other than that you prdtty much got it right.
---
Uhh can someone explain this king thing to me just got back into playing
---
Ok mixed genrusher
---
Like one of his french girls?
---
Change ur Apple id County
---
You have to accept that some ppl play like that; get out of higher ranks and it won‚Äôt happen as much. But I kind of agree with the other comment; coming to Reddit and making posts about it doesn‚Äôt do anything except attract the assholes of the community
---
Yeah I played like 30 games yesterday and like a good 20 were spirit mostly with PB, leave, then wait until someone was unhooked and tunneled the hooked survivor. God it was annoying and just made me stop for the day since all my games were boring/the same and no one was getting points including the killer and matches were short. 
---
But it got me excited to play against a red ranked nurse for once when I finally got a new killer
---
It‚Äôs definitely hard to get used to but the maps tend to be very consistent as far as window and pallet placements go. Just takes a little memorization while the other maps are open and procedural so despite inconsistency everything is still pretty easy to find. Gideon has two god pallets by basement and usually has a pallet at the top if every stair case and the freezer room has a consistent window that‚Äôs very strong if used properly, just for examples sake. I hope it works out for you, I don‚Äôt love gideon but lery‚Äôs is my personal favorite :)
---
Somebody is salty and butthurt downvoting all my shit lol
---
Not sure what people are talking about here, the matchmaking works off the party leader, so just have your friend host the SWF and you'll face killers that are at his level. Just try not to bully the noob killer too much.
---
He can't take a loss. Or think of chasing a survivor that doesn't have balanced landing. Close minded....
---
Judging by how the match played out I gambled knowing they might have borrowed time and won regardless. The way they played in response to my instant re-hooking was beneficial to me.
---
This just proves how useless Frenzy really is. I love Legion but his power is useless.
---
I did think about this and I though for other killers perhaps a row of entity spikes would appear where and when the survivor grabs the pallet but I wasn't really sure how to make this fit Alien.
---
My reply every time is "Lol gg ez."
---
Don't expect stupid folks to use their brains.
---
Swamp is hands down my least favorite.
---
Hey! Be nice to doc, he's fun. Very slow and his ability buys the survivors time. But yes fun!
---
Got lucky with an afk survivor. Would've been longer without the ruler add-on on top of the prolonged looping that would come with it.
---
then its spirt fury
---
I don‚Äôt follow honor rules dude.
---
Also I don‚Äôt care about blood points.
---
Which countries is it released in
---
Ok seriously though I want doctor to have that in his ability maybe make it regress the generator by 5%?
---
Cough ruin cough
---
I kind of love this format
---
It didn't seem like we would get Nancy to be chosen over Hopper but I sure am very glad it happened.
---
Is that an rtx 2070? If it is I have that exact same card!
---
Look At an tutorial on yt named ‚Äúhow to Download dbd mobile‚Äù
---
isn't toxic, it's the only way a good Nurse will miss their hit/lunge if they know how to blink properly.
---
A rank 13 but with maxed out level for Neah and Claudette. Nice
---
Its utterly useless. It's a trap add on now. I'm fine with troll/crap add ons but normally they give BP boost to categories.
---
I think it's a fair add on, compare it with moris
---
The chances of multiple survivors, if not all 4, having balanced landing when Ormund/Haddonfield is offered is very, *very* slim.
---
I can take a loss when there's skill involved. Those maps require very little skill on the survivor side of things, especially when balanced landing is involved. They'd have to fuck up majorly to lose on those maps or I'd have to be playing spirit/nurse.
---
Holy shit. When I wreck rank 1 swf with spirit just bc shes good and I know how to play her. 
---
"YOU CAMPED AND TUNNELED ALL GAME"
---
Me watching my recording trying to find where I camped or tunneled: -_-
---
I saw a vid on here from that Otz guy and he mentioned people could run it with Decisive and Head On so you‚Äôll either heal up from IS or get away regardless.
---
For it to be spirit furt the pallet would have to break, not injure the survivor.
---
Yeah they made Doctor like Freddy, instead of teleporting he sends a copy to break the gen!
---
Someone told me hag traps were meant for gens and I'm not supposed to use them on hooks and was pissed when he died because his friends weren't sly with the unhooks. Said I play hag wrong.
---
I liked hopper. I'm up for it.
---
This is wrong, matchmaking goes off of the party lead's rank, not the average. That's why the matchmaking system is such ass
---
Putrid oak, survivor pudding, stuff like that. Nothing secret.
---
Not sure if trolling.
---
You basically answered your own question, if you think about it for a moment: There are much more killers than survivors. So the survivors always instantly find a game because killers are already waiting, but the killers need to wait until it's their turn to get some survivors into their lobby.
---
Makes sense, no?
---
This is showcasing an add-on, not the base power
---
It‚Äôs been leaked
---
It was also posted on r/leaksbydaylight where someone found it in the game files. Also some people have seen it on steam as well but I can't find it on there.
---
Love seeing this
---
My waifu senses are tingling.
---
Not since the original leaks that said he was KP1 in march.
---
It clearly wasnt meant seriously, come on guys
---
I use them to counter loops. Go through that pallet, fucboi. And they do, and I teleport behind them.
---
As a survivor, Badham. So many unsafe pallets!
---
As a Bubba player in MKX, I can relate pretty hard to this meme.
---
I like a Killer that manages to actually scare me. Which, in my case, isn't that hard since I suck at this game and therefore, almost always see any Killer as a threat I can't properly fight against that WILL smack my ass down once they decide I'm their next prey.
---
This can lead me into having some unpopular opinions, like actually liking it when the Killer brings a mori, or when they have NOED.
---
Also, some people might see it as a dick move if, as a Killer, you act like you're going to let a Survivor live only to deny them and kill them anyway. Like dropping the last Survivor near the Hatch, only to close it front of them and/or executing them here. But I personally find it thematically fitting.
---
Same as NOED. Nothing more Slasher-themed than suddenly getting brutally slaughtered when you thought you were about to get away alive.
---
Yeah, I'm not really playing Survivor expecting to get out alive. As it should be when playing a Slasher-themed game.
---
Close! It‚Äôs a 2080 and I love it!
---
Yeah that would've been good
---
uNcIvIl my ass
---
Good point man. That's understandable. Take the loss instead. Experience is knowledge.
---
How exactly are you determing what's "too many". There's 8 people in character art. Which seems reasonable to me considering the size of the rest of the team. In any case, with games like dead by daylight, it's actually good to have a decent sized art team to ensure content creation that can be implemented easily so the entire team as a whole can continue being paid. I do like how you're switching your argument to optimization now though. My laptop with a 1050 runs the game at a pretty consistent 45 fps and the credits don't actually lag at all, so I'm guessing you're running the game on something worse. Lag should be expected at that point. My rig with a 1060 and an i5-6300 ran the game on high at perfect 60. But I will give you that it could be optimized more. Which, according to dev updates and my continued experiences with the game, they are making progress on that front. As far as correlations go, most live service games don't let you unlock (most) cosmetics or characters for free like dbd does, which certainly doesn't sound like a "cash grab" to me. And again, how do you know how much money the devs make off of DBD? Dlcs and the game itself are likely most often bought on sale from vendors that take a cut in the first place, not including the cut given to any IP holders from third party characters. And once a player has bought it, they have it forever, meaning that money... Actually nevermind, that comment about business classes? Yeah, I was serious. Finally, read back those last eight sentences of yours and let me know who looks like they're on a crusade here mr. "I don't have points I just repeat myself". I'm pointing out how someone is ignorant, pretentious, and cynical. And cynicism does not make you intelligent buddy boy. Good luck with your game design schooling.

The devs added the stun duration to stop infinites. BL reduced stun duration on every fall undoes that design.
---
And no its extremely strong on a number of maps for that reason. You‚Äôll learn this when you come to understand the game more noobie.
---
Yeah.. pretty much every game I've ever played as killer lol
---
It‚Äôs a bug
---
The pig is originally from the saw franchise, saying ‚Äúfrom dead by daylight‚Äù is false
---
Well deserved upvote nonetheless
---
Then he says that he reported me
---
So the spirit needs to be able to be mindlessly looped for your fun. Because that‚Äôs sooo fun for the killer.
---
I'm a simple man.I see survivor,I hit.

Survivor- gideon's meat packing
---
Killer- FUCKING CORN!
---
Very altruistic saved each survivor  I felt so bad to kill her
---
And it's a bad add on. Good survivors just do gens and loop for years.
---
If there was a 100% safe move to counter spirit, she'd be a garbage killer
---
Burger King Myers intensifies

If they give her s better outfit üò´
---
Only true millennials will get this double-quadruple post-post modern humor my guy
---
They should. Theres tons of killers who ate actually nice n most likely wouldnt even do half the the things they do in the game. Like the plague would be more concerned about beating the doctors ass vs the survivors.... So it still can work if hes a nice guy
---
As trapper HAHAHAHAHAH have fun getting up a down the stairs
---
Sorry i didnt know about that subreddit btw how to post multiple photos in one post. Im on phone btw
---
Just out of curiosity, is this a console app? Or is there a secret dbd messaging app I don't know about?
---
So play Nurse then
---
I always thought she was the best designed killer-making predictions on both sides to win. In fact, I only recently saw a wave of SpIriT oP

Thanks! I can't draw realistic stuff at all, but I love a comic-y style with thick black lines
---
I'm only rank 16 I got the game on PS4 a few weeks ago and I think I'm actually decent.
---
I agree. I really hate him for this reason. If hes staring at me now I‚Äôve learned to just run and break LOS rather than piss about trying to reveal him, but at this point I‚Äôm ignoring the entire reveal mechanic just because it‚Äôs broken. He feels so half-baked.
---
It's cool dude, just pointing you in the right direction
---
Also, I'm kinda new to Reddit myself but I don't think you can? I think you would have to merge them both into one larger image.
---
Not tru man. I‚Äôm an Adam main and I‚Äôm always the last to die (if I do) since I consistently get paired up with locker Dwight‚Äôs and hiding Claudette‚Äôs
---
Its a bug, the escape event didnt  trigger when you ran past the thresshold, its not super common but theres no fix except die or escape the hatch
---
That‚Äôs not true. Small game exists, and now the new perk makes it even easier.
---
Am still annoyed they changed his entire kit but left out his aesthetic as his new power is kinda contrasting with his looks. I get the part where he sees through the survivor perspective but nah
---
Myers just stands there.
---
*staring at it*
---
I think proxy camping and aggresive tunneling is just being toxic. Tunneling only happens if the survivor is a dumbass or the killer is proxycamping.
---
Same
---
Quit sucking tru3 your defending some stranger on the internet lol
---
Will do but I definitely want the BP gains from bbq :P
---
Seems like getting to play the new killer for free is the reward
---
 You know who gets exited for him, who keeps telling that GF is balanced killer? Survivors, that's who. They got a toy on their hands, to play with. Devs gave survivors a tool to mess with killer - revealing mechanic. 
---
 That's why no one disscusses all these issues:
---
\- Killer players don't play GF, knowing that he is an absolute crap. 
---
\- Survivors have no problem playing against him, so they don't complain.
---
I love his mori because it‚Äôs so buggy makes me laugh every time
---
This game can be really frustrating a lot of the time but I recently had a survivor game with randoms that was the most fun I‚Äôve had in this game in a while. We went against a hag and the teamwork was on point. Only two of us made it out alive but it was so satisfying to get through that game. It was fun and all of us (killer included) got a lot of points, which is what the game should be about, second to providing some fun and entertainment.
---
Me: "This game is super toxic"
---
You: "stop playing victim you petty fuck"
---
ok man yeah you're right I'm clearly in the wrong here
---
I'm a pretty mediocre survivor main (I'm not great, but I do okay) and I have to say I have the least fun against a Wraith that uses a ton of perks that just make it more difficult to beat an already difficult killer. When any killer "stacks the deck" to the point that you can't do ANYthing... gens are cursed, so it takes forever &amp; they camp so you can't unhook team mates or they use an aura reading perk and just find everyone quickly and down everyone within a few minutes or just generally create a build that makes all the objectives impossible. I don't mind a challenging killer, it can be a lot of fun to play against a good killer that isn't relying on a build that just makes it impossible but it takes all the fun out of the game when it just feels useless to try anything. 
---
Everyone haters a camper... but I find it the least fun when a killer finds me first, tunnels AND face-camps. Staying in the area of a hooked player or going between 2 hooked players makes sense and it's not going to take all the fun out of a game, (it can ADD to the fun factor because it becomes more challenging to save friends) but if you find someone right away and then don't even give them a chance to play because you're face-camping, that's the least fun experience a survivor can have.
---
Also, what I refer to as bi-polar killers. The ones that will watch you do a gen or heal a team mate then down you then leave you there or let you wiggle free or let you go, then watch you do a gen then down &amp; hook you. It's confusing and not fun... I think survivor mains all secretly hope for a "nice" killer that isn't really playing or will let a final person go free after all their effort but going back and forth from nice to brutal is so frustrating.
---
Does bt work with wglf
---
How do you expect me to last for 30 seconds? I mean, killers like the clown or the doctor, who don't have much mare preassure, have anti-looping tools. Wraith, for exemple, who has greater map preassure, doesn't have anti-looping tools. Then we have nurse, who has map preassure and anti-looping tools, and that's why everybody agrees that a good nurse is the best killer in the game. And finally we have the spirit, who has great map preassure plus godlike anti-looping tools, and she doesn't require half the skill the nurse does.
---
We can argue all day, but I believe everyone that played for a while and faced many spirits will agree that she's broken and really unfun to play against.
---
PS4 yes
---
Lmao, forget to change accounts?
---
Well thanks for the tips, I'll give it a shot

You can toggle off post game chat though? You wont have to worry about it ever again

All of Legion is garbage. His power is brainless and Useless for the most part. His add ons are all trash. He needs a total rework.

Inb4 people accuse you of animal abuse

*cough* legion *cough*

They probably meant a killer that only crawls. Because this is almost a mirror of pigs m2
---
lmao when I saw the tag
---
Out of all your games, how many times has chat been abused when compared to being used to complement the killer on a game well played?
---
Well, no. I play a lot and I think she‚Äôs fun to verse. Do you play her? If not, you should. You know what she‚Äôs thinking and how she plays.
---
How about ‚ÄúFreddy‚Äôs bitches‚Äù
---
Everyone should use perks to make the game last longer, DS on survivor, hex ruin on killer. The longer a game lasts and the more minigames you do like clearing totems, hooking multiple survivors and hitting one and letting them heal while you chase someone else gives you more blood points. There's no reason not to.
---
I really don't think ldatherface's mori is that cool. I also think doctor is an easy A tier cause the laughing in the background makes him look sadistic, also hillbilly's is as good as the other original 2 killers (wraith and trapper), just a chainsaw to the back is pretty bland, nor above huntress (which I like because they get stuck to her axe)
---
You'd be surprised, people will do literally anything to assert moral high ground
---
Yea most of my PC is white I want to paint some of the black stuff like the radiator. I love it but I think I went a bit overboard as I pretty much play DBD, rocket league and now Minecraft haha.
---
Yeah. u just wanted to be mean to the killer sadly
---
I do ok with him at rank 8. I use all ears, bbq, ruin, and pop goes the weasel. Idk how you play but I don't rely on marking for all my hits. Usually I'll just hit someone if I know I can do that but don't have time to mark if that makes sense. Sometimes I just use stealth mid chase to mindgame/throw them off as they turn corners etc
---
Aced it mate
---
I still based it off of Dead by Daylight in the character shop. The main pose you see her with in DBD.  It‚Äôs funny cause someone posted a comment like 20 minutes ago stating how they were surprised no one ‚Äúcorrected me like I didn‚Äôt already know what it was originally from‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm sad they got rid of it lmao
---
The red graphic that appears when you stab someone with feral frenzy and the other survivours are revealed by it or when someone reveals Ghost Face the same red graphic is used to show where the survivor is. This red thing is killer instinct. Sorry if this makes no sense, I'm bad at explaining but I'll try my best to help
---
It's treason, then.
---
I heard from someone that the rituals it gives you tend to favor the side you play less to encourage you to play that side, not sure if it is true but if it is then we are both out of luck
---
no it's a demo. Demo are free by definition
---
did u read the comment? He was camping every time so he got what he was giving
---
And eats you with ketchup splattering the ground and walls all around you
---
Holy shit I remember people getting so mad about "camping" when literally 2-3 of them were sitting by the hook waiting for me to leave. If you play like that why would I leave lol you're letting me win.
---
I'd people are going to get mad over a game, they need to keep it to themselves. It's fine to get frustrated, but it's not ok to make it a scene.
---
You have awesome skins my dude! I can tell you work really hard on them :) if it‚Äôs any consolation I only own two ‚Äúfan made‚Äù skins, yours and the one I have on :)
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs to keep people from p3ing their unlocks on the first day of release with someone that pregrinded 80 mil BPs with knowledge of a future release.
---
But ya, I think the 1 mil cap is a little outdated. It‚Äôs really not that much honestly. IMHO cap should be 5-10 mil.
---
Ohhh damn that sucks if true.
---
Ah i see.  I should try that next time I'm against nurse.  Thanks.
---
I've never had a burger king chicken nugget bag that didn't at least have one bone. It's yikes
---
One reason is because people used to hack themselves billions and billions of bloodpoints so the devs made the bloodpoint cap to prevent cheating
---
That's funny, don't know what you play on but on the PS4 (at least on Sunday nights when I play) it will be a 15-20 minute wait to play as a survivor. But it only takes 1-2 minutes to find one as a killer
---
im bubbles3214 on xbox. casual and testing, kyf/swf, 3 peeps. mic required, don't need discord. I will be on at about 3:30 pm in eastern us (near new York)

This is why the perk won't stop NOED. People like that guy who don't want to replace any of the same perks they've run for a year even if it helps the team. They would rather run a garbage perk like self care.
---
Daddy.

\*cough\* and die hard left 4 dead fans \*cough\*
---
lol yeah I‚Äôm not trying to bust your balls bro. But it‚Äôs revealed in a later movie that Amanda was the pig that kidnapped the two people from the first saw movie and in that same movie we see John Cramer use the hidden blade to slash detective tapp‚Äôs throat. And since Amanda is his apprentice she probably had a blade as her weapon in case things went south kidnapping a victim.
---
I haven't played in forever so idk how hag works but I played nurse (I think?). I would run away just far enough to teleport back right onto the hook. Of course I'm gonna do that if you're gonna be so predictable. People complain so hard if you use their predictable behavior against them.
---
&gt;I want to get enough bloodpoints to p3 the demogorgon when it comes to dbd, but bloodpoints are capped at 1mil, which is only enough to get him to lvl40, so why does the bloodpoints cap exist?
---
According to one of the devs, it was implemented to easily single out people that cheated bloopoints or make their lives harder if they want to keep under the radar (by cheating in 1 mil at a time).
---
yeah as much as I hate to say it, you're right that there are definitely some people out there like that.
---
[here is my kitty](https://i.imgur.com/oNHHwxt.jpg), she's sitting right next to me right meow
---
why does it feel like the edit is of lower quality each time
---
I disagree tbh. I've had survivors at rank 8 cry at me that he's still too hard to reveal in grass etc. Also I like playing him as someone who plays almost exclusively killer. He has a really weird playstyle though. I understand why people think he sucks.
---
I need to play this game again I think. Do I need to buy a DLC to use this killer?
---
Nice!
---
Ew.  No. 
---
There's a reason we use Meghead as an insult, after all.
---
When you nut and he keeps suckin.
---
Did they change nurse? People told me I was bad and she takes no skill back when I won with her lol.
---
What do they say, "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"
---
Or in this case "a shit by any other name would still smell"
---
I don't really care what you want to call it or what dictionaries you want to use: either way it takes no skill
---
this actualy happened when I was playing spirit today. god its so relateable
---
I know they introduced the cap because of hacking but it‚Äôs long overdue that they increase it. It should be around 3 million just so you can get a good start when new Chapters come out. I mean this one has 3 characters and to get them all to just Level 50 you‚Äôd need around 4.5 Million BP.
---
I recently got to purple ranks and do this now when I have to for this reason. They can escape so I try to ensure a sacrifice. They are all altruistic and try to save then call me a facecamper and trash. I don't think being low rank is worth this level of toxicity.
---
Who ever said anything about a "100% safe move"
---
I do
---
Exactly so you can't P3 50 a character on the day they're released.
---
This isnt COD its DBD two completely different games...thats not even close to the same thing. Facecamping should just be banned you literally cannot unhook someone or r guven the option to is fomeone facecamps. Its basically body blocking. Proxy camping isnt as bad but ppl who proxy camp do it to tunnel the person who was hooked. Theres literally no other reason to proxy camp unless its to aggresively tunnel. If u see a survivor and u hooked them 15 seconds ago cuz theyre running around leaving scratch marks thats not tunneling.
---
take my internet points that's cool, never knew any of those were a thing
---
Either way the rank will still be so high it‚Äôs unfair
---
it's because this sub is a huge circle jerk and they can't think for themselves.
---
It's a really good map for survivors! Easy to hide around, almost every pallet loop is strong, really high number of pallets, bad map for billy, huntress, a lot of balanced landing spots.
---
Wow! That‚Äôs great! Good job!
---
He‚Äôs very informative.
---
I didn‚Äôt say anything about gens or genrushing. I don‚Äôt appreciate straw man arguments.
---
Sure it was. We know because of dbd that she knows how to use it and that she wore it with the outfit so it stands to reason that she had it on, even if we don‚Äôt see it.
---
Why do you think i said second best map?
---
Oof, I apologise for my rude assumtion
---
Probably. It was fun to use because you could play some fun mind games. The people who got mad were usually the ones who didn't bother adjusting their play at all. I didn't even use it just to camp hooks, lots of opportunities to let people think you've left an area.
---
The Shrine
---
To be fair, I'm not saying the perk **is** overpowered, and no one can truly know balance, but you can just see by the numbers for healing that this will definitely be a game-changing perk.
---
I've had randoms body block me when I'm injured at the gates all the time, because it's the right thing to do to save your team, but they rarely body block me when the killer is carrying me.
---
Damn imagine if Nea didn‚Äôt have chola eyebrows 1 like = 1 prayer
---
Oof, don't think I'll have enough of that, can I still buy it then I guess?
---
Thanks I was looking for who made this üôåüèª

My doctor is a level 41 bbq didnt show up once. Crying myself to sleep

*grabs popcorn*
---
I‚Äôm just telling you what I read when I looked it up on Saw‚Äôs wiki page.  I‚Äôm done arguing over something that doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Also for killer play watch Otzavarda. He is a god a killer. And will give you a good laugh when he plays survivor.
---
Every Wednesday at 3 PM UTC.
---
Next Collection should be just Nea, Hag is in a separate one.
---
Looking good!
---
I‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs no reason to say she didn‚Äôt have it on.
---
The interesting part about this isn't that it counters noed, it's that it enables you to heal faster than a dedicated healing perk while also cleansing a totem, choosing when your pocket heal deploys, evading heal detection, and evading heal slowdown perks.
---
Hell yeah. Gonna make this my horror hole &gt;:)
---
I know this is dumb to ask but did you get the teachable from the shrine or bubba already?
---
Yeah, but that doesn't really mean anything. If it works 60 percent of the time on Lery's and works 20 percent on Gideon it's still bad. Just because it works 0 percent on any other map doesn't make it good.
---
Lol I did this on my phone so it‚Äôs not really the same style as yours, you should do this same one with different survivors and killers then we could mix and match
---
Throw Claudette into the mix as well
---
What the point of playing against bots?
---
Thats a yeehaw hillbilly

I hated Lery's at first, but now I really enjoy it. The constant room switching can work really well for survivors if used properly.
---
But yeah Gideon sucks every time. One time we got Gideon versus the Plague. No one dc'd but everyone did a suicide on their first hook.
---
dio in dbd
---
Nobody uses self-care, only solo survivors that have no choice, most people play swf and just heal each other in no time.
---
I was considering doing one with the killer/survivor roles changed, but I might try that!

Killer-Hospital

Very nice!
---
Because the only goal in the game is to get to rank one, right? *rolls eyes
---
Don't worry, I understand that you are confusion. Very confusion.
---
Playerbases change. When a new killer comes out, everyone wants to play that killer, nobody plays survivor. And vice versa. :)
---
Ohh I like that too like survivors post game telling survivors they‚Äôre garbage: me just doing 2 gens and running out when the gate is powered
---
Did i say it is good in any other map?
---
No, i didn't, watch a red rank myers main play mirror myers with a good build, even 4 rank 1 survivors can't do anything against him (before you say anything, again, i mean this for larys and the game)
---
Wow, this is really good! Keep it up
---
No it was a joke why tf people so sensitive
---
I beat mothafuckas with other mothafuckas
---
Yes and no. But mostly it is unfair add on
---
What's stopping them from hacking 1 million bloodpoints, then spending it, only to hack 1 million again afterwards?
---
I'm just using self-care as an example for numbers, it's still more efficient than being healed by someone else at default speed. A normal heal takes 16 seconds, and requires 2 people to find each other safely and not do anything else for that time, which is equivalent to the 32 seconds for self-care or more depending on finding time. Regardless of being **able** to heal each other in swf, just like deliverance, there's something to be said for not having to stop working on a gen to heal/rescue someone, and with up to 5 activations, you can literally save minutes in overall efficiency if this perk is maximized or even used once by each person.
---
He was probably new asshole
---
Yo give me some.
---
All credit goes to wingedwolf94 on YT. Just saw this today as a recommended and had to share it.
---
lol that disconnect icon at the end.
---
But... but shouldn't it say 'stupid Claudette' or 'stupid survivor'?
---
Still really good
---
Delete this right nowq
---
I'm rank 4 so he wasn't new asshole, why u speak without knowing?
---
Not right now, BHVR will have to negotiate with the Halloween franchise to do that.
---
Well in order to have context for others and myself, reply to that comment.
---
Technically, but they have to get consent from the IP holders so probably not any time soon
---
If you look at the banners for the cosmetics Nea and Hag are only shown in the same banner, so it's both of them.
---
What the fuck just happened
---
Can we all agree at least deliverance is balanced. I would also say unbreakable isn‚Äôt that bad either.
---
u seen mad. let me guess cause you are mad
---
&gt;One reason is because people used to hack themselves billions and billions of bloodpoints so the devs made the bloodpoint cap to prevent cheating
---
Not necessarily to prevent it because cheaters could insert any amount even with the cap but when the insertion was made, it would be easily noticeable through their database and they didn't have to waste time checking if it was grinded for or not.
---
You can still pay with money for any dlc. But licensed killers and suvivors cant be bought with in game currency
---
ur a noob for trolling him
---
In part, yes, but you also have movies and shows like IT, Chernobyl, Summer of 84, Black Mirror Bandersnatch, When they see us, the Goldbergs, Bummblebee, Mandy, and Ready Player One (basically set in 80‚Äôs nostalgia). 
---
We are at the time where those making the movies are too nostalgic about their childhood and we are getting a view of the 80‚Äôs like ‚ÄúBig Bang Theory‚Äù shows a view of nerd culture.
---
Remember, any good survivor perks are broken.
---
As soon as those Friday the 13th servers shut down you best believe our boi is coming to the party.
---
I get ashamed when I do fail it every once in a blue moon, But then I turn back around to help fix it
---
Steve‚Äôs scoops ahoy outfit already confirmed
---
The key to beating spirits is respecting your healthy state. Red rank survs are so used to being injured and being willing to take a hit because killer overall is a joke. Who cares if you're injured when theres 30 pallets on a map? Spirit punishes that mentality. 
---
If you don't get cocky and you get to safety before taking that first hit, she's much easier to deal with. She essentially becomes a 110 killer with limited tracking ability. The guessing games you talk about become much easier to think about too when you're not one shot. 
---
I used to think she was stupidly OP until I started maining her. I found survivors who were able to deal with her better than others and learned from them.
---
Unfortunate. But at least you have doc's teachables now? Im sure you'll get bbq soon.
---
You can see he knew u were coming because he has Spine Chill
---
Tru3 doesn't know what fun means, he gets hurt by the smallest insult
---
Problem is, you're forced to go for the save. If the killer face camps the first person he downs, and you just do gens and all walk out you have a decent chance of depiping and are guaranteed to not get above a black pip.
---
Can someone draw spirit as a furry?
---
You might need to work on the font usage, other than that it‚Äôs good.
---
Noob3
---
&gt;Can we all agree at least deliverance is balanced. I would also say unbreakable isn‚Äôt that bad either.
---
Deliverance user here. Its balanced to some extent. The balanced aspect of this perk is not always being able to get it active before your first hook and it stops there. 
---
The effect granted by this perk is extremely strong (don't think it needs changing) because it negates so much pressure from the killer.
---
When you are hooked, a second survivor needs to stop repairing their generator and travel all the way to where you are hooked to perform a save. Meanwhile the killer is mostly likely chasing a 3rd survivor which in practice leaves just 1 survivor progressing generators. Depending on how fast the killer can catch that 2nd survivor, the match will escalate in his favor. 
---
When you unhook yourself, all the other 3 survivors will continue doing whatever they are doing, most likely progressing the generators. Even if the killer doesn't come back because he doesn't want to tunnel, it also means YOU can immediately go work on a generator because you can't self-heal during 60s anyway. 
---
Deliverance can also be game changing if there are multiple survivors downed / hooked, just like Unbreakable. 
---
Deliverance + Decisive Strike once gates are opened (if you manage to not get hooked until then), means a free escape even if the killer is prox camping.
---
Not a wall. But if my character model is on the other side of the window and already taking steps and o get hit, that's bullshit.
---
personally for me it‚Äôs azarov‚Äôs but blood lodge is a close second from autohaven
---
you stay on one side of the map for too long and 3 gens pop at the same time from the other side
---
&gt;"Camping killer learn to play GG EZ killer"
---
Doctor and Clown being anti loop killers is kinda a meme. I haven't versed a Clown in red ranks for months and I play a lot. Because Clown doesn't actually stop loops.
---
Doctor only stops unsafe loops. You realistically need at least his yellow shock range add on for him to not be dog shit and that increases his charge time enough that a good surv will just keep running the loop.
---
Id use both they got sum of my fave Perks
---
I neeEEEEEEED IT
---
I'm rank 15-16 right now and they knew what farming was since that's what they specifically called it. Some people you just can't please I suppose.
---
Stop please too real :(
---
Well, it's easy to answer any question about ignorance or toxicity in this game: If they don't blame the other team being "unfair" somehow, they have to accept that they were outplayed and that they could have done better.
---
Trapper is the only one of those who actually counters loops at red rank. And to use Trapper's power, you need to lose multiple gens just to set it up. So fun!
---
you can play your favourite killer that's ok but if you tunnel or camp is wrong
---
Exactly!
---
Bro you know he's gonna be nerfed into the ground after ptb
---
I fucking hate survivors who whine about someone playing a a killer tans unfun to play against like shut the fuck up and let us play the killer we want you don‚Äôt control what killers we play and how we play them why do survivors act like killers need follow their strict rules
---
This is idiotic advice. Its absolutely worth it to get 2nd hook or the kill on a survivor over potentially stopping a gen completion.
---
Where's Head On?
---
I usually run a Red Paint Brush and Swing Chains combo as they're forced to go to an alarm clock to wake up or find a teammate that already has, slowing down gen progress. Your perk build is also pretty crucial. I like to run Ruin, BBQ, Pop and the fourth varies between Discordance and Make Your Choice depending on if they have toolboxes or are an SWF.
---
Wheres ghostface?

Kono Jein da!
---
I dont see why you have to drag Claudette mains into this.
---
"Do they keep teabagging the entire match just to slam that phat ass on the ground?"
---
"No."
---
\*Puts down Jane\*
---
I suck as Spirit. I admit it
---
Whenever I play Meyers, people seem to think that when I'm carrying someone T3 dosen't work, I've gotten a  million downs from people bodyblocking tier 3 Myers.
---
Can't teabag when I'm on a hook and can't move for more than 10 feet
---
I would say David‚Äôs and Claudette‚Äôs more than Nea‚Äôs in my experience. 
---
But then Nea is my only P3 survivor so maybe I‚Äôm biased. I definitely don‚Äôt do that shit though.
---
So you like having a power that has more drawbacks than almost all Killers powers combined?
---
I'd remove Mori dailies tbh. Swap them with something like "Down X survivors with Y killer."
---
I think it's either a shy or teary OwO/UwU which is mean to be blushy
---
I'm...
---
Definitely know what I'm doing. Hasn't been a month since release I haven't been rank 1.  If you're dealing with competent survivors the only way you're one shotting people on that map is if you 99 your stalk and pop it on their backs. Otherwise you're chasing them to a fuckton of pallets
---
I'll concede that Ghostface has a lot better potential on that map because of his mindgames so you may be right there. But I don't often pull that map with RNG so I have limited games with him so far. 
---
And Doc is honestly just annoying on that map. He's still just an m1 killer at the end of the day tho. Good survs laugh at Doc
---
Or, just ignore it and kill them by playing normally?
---
Correct, which is why this post is labeled as a rant. I've had killers one to many times get crushed due to bad matchmaking and they blame me for playing well. It just makes me feel bad sometimes, I hate bullying new players.
---
If it's not on Tuesday im suing
---
Imagine playing Billy **WITH RUIN** and complaining about whatever the survivor's are using.
---
This is what i assume they're going to do when they put it in after stranger things
---
Playing against a bas nurse/spirit is hella fun, you can loop the same place without pallets. Hag is just... Ya know
---
It's a really flawed ranking system. Right now I'm a rank 8 Survivor and I was on the verge of reaching rank 7 until someone disconnected right as a match began and that somehow caused me to derank which is incredibly stupid. Why should I derank because someone disconnected during the loading screen? Rank is supposed to represent your skill level. Another issue is the resets each month that throw everyone back. If someone's rank represents them well why throw them back a whole bunch? That just means some Killers will end up going against Survivors that are too hard for them to deal with. The whole thing's ridiculous. I consistently find myself near rank 10 as a Survivor and a few times now have managed to get to ranks 8, very nearly 7 yet resets cause me to end up in matches with players not as experienced in some regards, which can lead to awkward matches and that deranks me even more and then I end up going against baby Killers in some instances and then I feel bad for them because it's so imbalanced if they're newer players and I'm used to dealing with Killers in ranks 7 - 12.
---
Amongst these issues is how you rank is hurt by your teammates actions, which is terrible. What your teammates do and don't do, and whether or not the Killer is tunnelling and/or camping you, should not impact your rank. It just takes some unhelpful teammates, or even teammates trying to pass the Killer on to you while you're trying to be stealthy, and some tunnelling to set you back. Being unhooked in front of the Killer can hurt you rank and, again, it doesn't bloody reflect you as a player. What's odd is that technically helps the rank of someone making bad choices while hurting you. 
---
The ranking system needs an overhaul where it pays attention to your routine habits such as how successfully altruistic you are in general, how often your stealth saves your ass, and stuff like that. I wish it recognised when you've been screwed over. Making deranking as easy as a disconnect from you or someone else allows high ranked players to bully weaker player because with the rank reset and the flawed system they know how get themselves up again baby Killers.
---
Yeah, sorry about that lol
---
Except Legion's current state WAS the rework. Remember how long Freddy was broken after his initial rework? Legion is now going to have to wait equally as long.
---
Dead By Daylight as a game will more likely die before Legion gets a rework.
---
Have you seen David shirtless?
---
I also am a noob that knows about scratch-marks and walking so that had something to do with it :).
---
I have 1mk + 2 times a 30k challenge + 60k challenge and 2k shards to a extra 150k. I can feel your fellings

Those red lines are on every single prestige weapon  and they can't be removed at all
---
He ain‚Äôt cheap lol
---
No, but it‚Äôs good policy in public forums to respond to the proper post. And I have a bunch of replies to shift through and when I see CoD mentioned and look at the parent comment and don‚Äôt see a single mention of CoD, I don‚Äôt feel like shifting through the past two hours of comments to get context to what I was saying. I said that nearly an hour ago, not 2 seconds ago, my eidetic memory just isn‚Äôt what it used to be I guess. 
---
It was an analogy to provide other examples that I think are pertinent. You telling me that this game isn‚Äôt CoD is irrelevant. You understand that people use comparisons in order to make their opinion more clear, yes?
---
Idk why you‚Äôre being down voted Legion is by far one of the least fun killers to go against tbh
---
Yea, I‚Äôm just mainly talking about around the 00:19 mark, repairing gens is super loud
---
what
---
Basically
---
I was playing a game last night and it was a SWF group and they had one person who constantly tried to bait me into looping with him. After a couple of loops I figured out quick that this guy would likely keep me in chase nearly all game so I just bailed and went to kill his friends on generators.
---
Ended up with the 3k cause his friends were not as good. Got a big juicy PS4 message telling me how to play, and that I should have just chased him indefinitely lol
---
Thank you, I shall now bother my friend into playing this
---
Here is a guide made by one of the better killers in DBD, ScottJund: [How to Run All Generic Tiles as Killer - Dead by Daylight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ)
---
You can't prevent looping but, what you can do is chase survivors in a smart way instead of just holding W. 
---
First of all, try to get the pallet down ASAP. Don't pause every time the survivor approaches the pallet (afraid of being stunned) or change directions completely just to avoid going near the pallet. If the loop has high walls, change directions to shorten the gap even faster while also hiding your redlight. Once the pallet is down, don't mindlessly break it, force the survivor to the side that will either push him to a deadzone (an area where you previously broke other pallets) or he will have to run past you, reducing the distance gained.
---
Make tight turns, use Enduring/sf, don‚Äôt respect pallets, make them drop pallet on the worse side for them.
---
Oh yeaaah. How did I forget about Ana, lol.
---
The angels from Doctor who.
---
Hahahaha lmfao! Thats some funny shit and so true!
---
Why? Because you get tired of being wanting to play a new killer and have an interesting match only to find out if you dont run good perks you might as well just have no perks at all. 
---
Oh and then you get tbag flashlight spammed by people 5 ranks above you.
---
Welcome to killer where if you make a mistake it's your fault. But when survivors make mistakes it's also your fault.
---
Most of us just want to have fun
---
I've had it as Myers myself, it's hilarious
---
I'm prob gonna buy the whole chapter so I'll build and play her too
---
Oddly specific.
---
The chestbuster thing I thought would be fine because it is only after you have been downed after you were in the struggle phase, which is usually when you will die anyway unlike a mori which is after first hook.
---
The map I meant the Nostromo in the space around LV-426, that is my fault for not making that clear.
---
As for the drone with eggs, ik the queen must lay eggs but I wanted this to be in the power so I though perhaps I could bend the rules a little. Who knows, maybe the queen is in the basement laying eggs lol
---
Ohhh thats strange but ok
---
Its a shit comparison.
---
look like he groovin'
---
Thanks for you‚Äôre help man! I‚Äôve been in contact and I‚Äôm on my way to being compensated :)
---
Oh man. I forgot this was in the rule book. Thou shall not use Ruin with Billy. Good catch bro
---
Lowkey looks like he's laughing or something.
---
Spooky.
---
Yea I don't really care for em
---
Oooh true.
---
no perks, 500% speed and attack is just running survivors ov
---
Also yea its been a hour go now but when u made that comment it was no where near an hour after u posted it.
---
I think I read this, but I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm more of a survivor main and when I hide in a locker and my blood last for awhile when I‚Äôm injured. I think it take 10 seconds for blood to disappear.
---
I just said why.
---
this is what happens when hax collide
---
Oh ok. Kinda had it in my memory that somne yters didnt have it. Maybe thats not the case :D But i rly think they would look better without them. They look too artificial
---
Yes overcharge is such a useful perk in my opinion, so im happy to have it
---
Meanwhile, there is no feedback for when she vaults a window and can easily find survivors while in the spirit realm by just bumping into them. Zero interaction and completely one-sided.  Definitely fair /s
---
My version of fair in this game is for there to be interactions between the survivor and killer and with Nurse and Spirit, there is pretty much nothing when they have remotely decent addons and a certain degree of experience. Once you reach a certain point with Nurse and Spirit, the game becomes a cake walk.
---
But yeah, keep paying attention to the babies in green and yellow ranks who complain about bubba while people in purple and red generally say "yeah, Nurse and Spirit are a little unbalanced."
---
Could you explain the joke?
---
&gt;Oh man. I forgot this was in the rule book. Thou shall not use Ruin with Billy. Good catch bro
---
Didn't say you couldn't use it. Just like survivors can and also use whatever they want.
---
I didn‚Äôt he was being toxic and t bagging and pointing at me when he dropped pallets
---
Groovy.
---
ahh this is a meta joke right? everything keeps getting worse. so are memes. so you created the worst meme you could imagine and posted it here. outstanding move
---
To be exact it was 12 minutes. I just looked.
---
I will get right on that!
---
All of them definitely have veins on their weapons but who knows the demogorgon could be the exception this chapter and in my opinion the veins are literally the only difference between some weapons like Ghostfaces or Leatherfaces, because those 2 definitely look the same besides those veins.
---
Prestige not worth it
---
More trolls and a lot more DC's
---
I am dewdlepies on all of my social media and art sites ( I need to post on DA more but I'm definitely active on Twitter and Tumblr)
---
Thank you! I appreciate it!
---
u shouldn‚Äôt be posting this here at all...he gets more undeserving views unfortunately
---
Yea I know. That‚Äôs what kind of aggravating with BHVR. They release some broken shit, then nerf it the ground instead of balancing it.
---
IMHO when he's not frenzied he should move more like a survivor and have no terror radius. They really did put the screw on him and make him an SWF who found a knife.
---
It  might be a few days, but there will be more!

A-fuckin'-MEN, my fellow killer friend!
---
My build relies on Mettle of Man and other perks to either take hits or distract because my playstyle is "protect the better players at all cost". Self Care is great as I can always take a hit, runaway and heal and do it again.
---
Yep, he's great. He even made an Overwatch DbD Workshop mode that's insanely fun and a great break from the real game.
---
Damnit, now you got me thinking about 2fort in DBD.
---
When i‚Äôve been queueing for 10 minutes and I just want to play...
---
I do too! I have thought of doing a comic about it just for comic practice and funsies

I'm usually laughing because I did something dumb in the chase. I feel chill when I play Ace
---
Pig from Saw, you mean?
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
That is exactly what I was going for!
---
Thank you! :D
---
Use leatherface. Very easy killer to use if u have good perks on him, doesn‚Äôt require much skill.
---
Me deciding if I had fun getting bullied but making a lot of BP
---
I don‚Äôt see why it couldn‚Äôt be
---
You either live long enough to become the villain or die a hero.
---
So if they can use whatever they want, why say anything? Who cares if they want to use Ruin with the top 3, I don‚Äôt blame them. Have you seen how fast gens go against a good group of survivors? Not everyone playing this game is Zubat tier bro.
---
Thats not as bad as the totem spawn on the upper balcony inside the Temple of Purgation. Explains all the games I've had on that map where we couldn't find that last totem with ruin on it
---
ü§Æ
---
Oh no another ochiDO fan in this reddit no pls
---
I like you. As a killer main I 100% agree with all of this. I think many players as they get better get far too into the meta and because of that forget that survivors are weaker than killers. The meta, in my opinion, shows that in actuality a good SWF team will almost always beat an equally skilled killer with teamwork and perks alone so the killer needs some perks that reinforce their place in the game.  
---
That's why I think the 'rules' like, "I'm last alive, let me leave,"  or "Someone DC'd, give us free gens," are just absolute garbage. If I feel the desire to spare someone, it's because I want to, I'm not obligated to.   
---
I think if everyone isolated themselves from the meta and approached it more like an RPG, everyone would have more fun as the killers get to take things slow and be creepy and fun and the survivors get a hoot out of legitimately trying to escape a psychotic monster.
---
Why not be able to p3 a character when they get launched?
---
Well xenomorphs without a queen actually do have drones that produce queen eggs but nothing else is really known about the process so the front laying eggs still works
---
Is scratching a mirror also bad luck?
---
Aka Jesus Jeff.

Doesn‚Äôt make sense NOED doesn‚Äôt care about health states. So why would a healing perk impact it? 0/10 meme
---
No I don't. But just from a glance most people would see that and assume you are being a jerk at least \*a little bit\* and even I only learned what /s meant like a few months ago so maybe someone at Steam HR didnt get the memo either.
---
It's the all caps that make it look worse than it is.
---
I'd argue Rancor is the best. It's almost a free kill
---
I think it's the other way around
---
Because you need to cleanse totems for inner strength to activate
---
gotta do what it takes, man
---
If you don't like a 50/50 chance then what do you want? Lol
---
Dwight: Hey Meg whats that on the grou-- *BOOM*  AW GAWD MY EAAAARS
---
So i guess using a perk that guarantees a miss, against the killer with the biggest punish hit in their face for missing a hit isn't toxic.
---
1. They said he wanted tips on not being toxic, not what's the most sweaty strategy we can think of
---
2. They're a new player. Have you been to low ranks? Nobody does gens there. "Stopping gen completion" is a non-factor when everyone is crouching behind a tree 24/7
---
I refer to nea as toxic because for some reason flashlight clickers and teabaggers like her and her bright cosmetics.
---
That's true, i respect that
---
The way teachable perks work also hurts new players. The meta setups require maxing out multiple dlc characters, and it's kind of crap. If you want to play Spirit as a new killer, have fun having 0 worthwhile perks. 
---
I understand that they need the money, but there's definitely a pay2win aspect to playing killer.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just simple stereotypes because most of the people that play those characters live up to the title
---
Isn't the point of mind games to make the opponent not sure what you're going to do next? Not knowing whether the spirit is phasing or not seems awfully similar to not knowing whether a killer is going to swing through a pallet or whether a survivor is going to drop a pallet. It's just that in the spirit's case there are more than two possible outcomes.
---
he poopin
---
I'd have to say no as I currently have yet to see a scoring system that works competitively in a tournament like setting for DBD.  The game has horrific game design when it comes to scoring systems for competitive play.  I'm reminded of the old TydeTyme hosted tournaments.  There was one where both teams had to play Leatherface and the one teams killer played amazing.  No camping fucked the opponents up with an impressive 3K.  The other sides LF facecamped his first survivor to death.  Ran NOED and facecamped a 2nd survivor to death end game with it.  The team got throughly outplayed hard.  The campers team won because even though the other killer far outperformed him the fact that he facecamped denied 100% of Altruism points to the opponents and their team actually won as a result.  This would be an absolute shitshow in competitive play.
---
Take your upvote cause that was beautiful
---
Nah this version is from Dead Dy Daylight. You knew that silly goose.
---
Because this game is a grinding game/they want people to grind as they learn the character like everyone else, some people had hacked their accounts to give them millions if not billions of BP, and not to mention the obvious balance issues all of that brings. It's quite obvious, really.
---
It *was* the Claudette that was still talking/laughing.
---
Oh lol gotcha now it makes sense
---
Ash mains can‚Äôt have big brains not possible mrs kick in the door
---
It's just Toxie isnt evil by any means so having him as a killer rubs me the wrong way.
---
Wish endgame showed totem placement on an aerial map...
---
This game is super pay to win tbh. I wanna say it's as bad as Planetside 2.
---
Looks like I gotta use balanced landing now
---
Well you should learn to play the killers before you go ahead and buy them. Check out some tutorials/guides on youtube. They are really helpful
---
Any tips on how to use make your choice effectively?
---
I understand that but if he believes we as survivors are being toxic to the Entity's environment then it would be fair game in his eyes to cleanse us from the realm.
---

It isn't our fault that survivors choose the wrong times to unhook someone.
---
UwU
---
Not really a rule? More that, the better your killer is, the less you need it and the more you can use that extra slot for other things. I've stopped running ruin or pop pretty much at all on Freddy
---
Why are people so sad
---
Yes thats another bad one too. All the ones on the top level are bad. Theres a spot on the other cornfield map as well in the house that no one can find.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt care if I don‚Äôt make progress if I stab them again bring that back (oh and the if you miss you can hit again
---
Be gf and tbag them
---
dude's got real hands like uncle jack's fake hands
---
&gt;So if they can use whatever they want, why say anything? Who cares if they want to use Ruin with the top 3, I don‚Äôt blame them
---
Its hypocritical of that Billy to call survivors out while also using strong shit. 
---
&gt; Have you seen how fast gens go against a good group of survivors? Not everyone playing this game is Zubat tier bro.
---
I rarely see these so called "good group" of survivors. They are as rare as zubat tier of Billy or maybe you are just inexperienced. Even when I do face a good group of survivors, it usually happens after I faced 50 "bad group" of survivors so I just take the L because they were obviously better than me and is not a perk that will change that. Even then, you can still use chase perks such as Enduring + SFury + Bamboozle to shorten the gap and reduce the loop value of structures instead of relying on gen slowing perks when you can apply constant pressure by bodying them.
---
Right?
---
I always get salt for not chasing survivors who purposely run me around forever. Yeah I can't catch you in a reasonable amount of time so I'm not going to bother. It's called strategy.
---
Looks like we have a tbagging survivor here which just got one shotted by Myers becausr of him stalking while u tbagged
---
Yeah but the addon is considered one of the best addons for Frenzy and it made Frenzy great but it got nerfed. Even with this addon Frenzy is a gimmicky bad power.
---
And that's what killer is all about. Play how you want. Survivors are in YOUR lobby, not you in theirs.
---
This sub is mostly survivor mains. Change my mind.

It sounds like you camp/tunnel too much.
---
She has an incredibly steep learning curve, as a warning. I‚Äôm trying to learn her right now and she‚Äôs pretty fun
---
The game would need to be refined considerably more before it could be even close to ready. Still a fair number of bugs that crop up, they need to have separate queues for solo, duo and quad, the pip ranking system needs serious overhaul, especially if they want to use it for judging the skill of players. They'd honestly need to create a new system for esports play scoring.

#NEA AND THE PUSSY CATS
---
Very well thought out and some good points brought up here! Thank you!
---
Whats so wrong with having a bloody outfit on the first day release? Youre grinding those millions of bloodpoints beforehand, so why not let people do that, and for the hacking, its pretty obvious that if someone gains 1000000 bloodpoints in the span of a few minutes they are hacking,they could just program something to catch pe doing that.
---
Not weak at all, have u ever used him? Run a charge time add on and u have insta chainsaw. I do agree that looping against leatherface is easy depending on how good of a survivor ur going against and if leatherface respects pallets.. but nonetheless don‚Äôt speak on a killer u don‚Äôt use cause he‚Äôs OP if yk how to use him, rlly just like any killer in the game and u can‚Äôt argue that
---
Very true! Thank you!
---
You can‚Äôt nobody is always happy you will always get toxic that‚Äôs just video games in general can‚Äôt really do anything about that
---
1700hr Killer, more than happy to volunteer as an either on-comms or off-comms killer to play in casual PC KYF. Shoot me a DM if you need professional malice that you can trust.
---
You can't. You can play like the biggest saint on the planet and do your best to follow all the stupid imaginary rules and people will still wish death on your whole family for killing them.
---
If you have balanced landing its really not that bad
---
The issue is you‚Äôre oversimplifying what the survivors need to do making it sound incredibly easy. You can do the same with any killer
---
Sounds like my kind of thing.
---
I'm more of a "jump in and get my hands dirty" kind of guy but thanks for the suggestion.
---
Get this person to hot immediately he is the ace in the hole we needed
---
Yea I‚Äôm a nooby and he helped me alot
---
Fair enough. Glad to have a civilized discussion about perks without people flaming.
---
that was the case some weeks ago with an issue with sounds. i'm afraid it's not at all a mindame anymore now.
---
this is understandable if they got a key and is going for hatch
---
Take these rules and throw em in the trash homie. There‚Äôs mechanics in place like getting less blood points for tunneling/camping and stuff. Jut play how you wanna play. You want more BP just don‚Äôt do those. You wanna be a rood dood and get your kill then do what it takes. Everyone plays different. Its a game of adaptation and reads man sometimes luck. Do whatever you wanna do. This game is based on the odds of slasher horror, the movies are balanced the killer doesn‚Äôt let someone get away without a reason. Do you boo boo
---
Dont play by others rules.
---
But you could still try to improve the chances of giving people a better experience with the game by playing nice, right?
---
Sure, but aren't they using the adult Demogorgon in the game and not the "dog" one? I'm a bit behind on Stranger Things (only now starting Season 3), but my research shows the adult Demogorgon stands on 2 legs and has human-like intelligence, whereas the mindless attack "dog" is a younger (teenage) version. It would make sense as those dog things would never carry or hook anyone. lol.
---
Oh boy is your info outdated. No, this add-on is absolutely pointless after the rework. You're not supposed to use it like he does in the video, but even when used "correctly," it literally does nothing whatsoever.
---
That's why you take sloppy butcher and instadown perks
---
But I could try it, because there will eventually be some people who appreciate it.

Wait what? He was complaining about a long game? I don't get it. Was he being looped a lot or something?
---
You literally live on a lonely island if you don't think Leatherface is weak at all.  It is a general consensus that he is among the absolute weakest killers in game if not the weakest at this point.  His chainsaw is dogshit in chases.  It only works in the wide open.  Any pallet or window nearby turns him into a straight M1 killer.  Yes I have played Leatherface numerous times over the years he's one of my numerous P3 killers.  There is nothing OP about him aside from his ability to facecamp.  I have to ask what rank are you playing him at because I find it hard to believe another experienced red rank killer would have this opinion of him.  He's a noob stomper but gets bullied as you rank up.
---
Definitely Claudette too
---
That‚Äôs like, your opinion man.
---
Spoken like a brain-damaged 7-year-old.
---
You got me bro. Guess you‚Äôre just a God at this game.

Nea‚Äôs would be a good choice because of Balanced Landing. It‚Äôs a pretty popular exhaustion perk at the moment and proves to be very helpful.

Good survivors turn Billy into an M1 killer.  It's absurd to throw shade at Billy players for running Ruin.
---
Hah, what a Freudian slip
---
He isn't even toxic in his videos. Him making fun of bad play is like putting a Benny Hill soundtrack in the background and cartoon noises. It's very light-hearted and non-toxic outside the occasional "Cunt", which he swaps with "Cutie" at will.
---
Don't listen to survivor rules. Don't facecamp, but otherwise, you do you. Just play the killer and don't get frustrated if you don't 4k. I generally say something positive in postgame chat no matter how the game went and just don't let any of the toxic players get to me.
---
That neas jaw. Jesus christ

So true lol.

&gt; Good survivors turn Billy into an M1 killer
---
Agreed. Thankfully for us, survivors THAT good aren't common and they also depend on map RNG. 
---
&gt;It's absurd to throw shade at Billy players for running Ruin.
---
Billy has insane map pressure so you can be nonstop chasing and downing people plus the 1-shot capability. You can use ruin, you just don't need it.
---
Planning on using it on nurse as well.
---
She can get to a hook scary fast
---
But if you're dead he only has to deal with 3 ppl, 2 of them can do gens and he has a by far easier time, so I see it as a legit strat, even if it sucks for the person on the other end. But you still have your exhaustion perk after a 5 second head start, so you can make it to a pallet 95% of the time, if they're all used up you have to blame your team for doing so. A nurse wouldn't really tunnel though, nurse just does nurse things, and billy is a normal m1 killer when it comes to looping with no pallets around
---
Don‚Äôt be a dick. It‚Äôs really that simple. Don‚Äôt DC, don‚Äôt spam Mori, don‚Äôt tea bag, say GG, don‚Äôt face camp someone because they made you mad or the hell of it. You don‚Äôt even have to be friendly, just don‚Äôt be a dick. 
---
Like others said, you can play as ‚Äúfair‚Äù as you want, you‚Äôre still gonna trigger someone. You‚Äôre a solid player in my book if you play with a lick of sportsmanship.
---
Three Dwight huh*winks suggestively*
---
I don‚Äôt have anything like noed and still get 4k‚Äôs, and for the doctor, if u can do that then u might as well look for the other survivors and hook them, the more hooks u get the more points u get, the higher ranks u get to, so if they save him u can just go back and kill them, now give another valid reason why facecamping would be a good strat, because it‚Äôs obviously not

I don‚Äôt care how much this map caters to survivors balance wise, it is the least fun map to play on by a mile personally
---
Just try to play killer how you‚Äôd like a killer to play against you. People will complain but as long as you give them a chance and beat them by being the better player that‚Äôs as much as you can do.
---
"it was a dark and gloomy night in Coldwind farm. Meg ran for her life in an attempt to escape the evil known as The Leatherface. The killer was catching up! The thrill of the hunt and Meg's FAT ass made his flacid penis... very erect"
---
Are you purple? It looks like you're the one complaining to me? Am I reading this wrong
---
(sometimes when survivors are raging at you in the post game chat it's because you're a toxic asshole who doesn't make the game fun for anyone but yourself~)
---
DbD community in a nutshell
---
She IS the Spine Chill
---
i‚Äôm pretty sure its a bug and it just says you depipped, when you really get a safety pip
---
For killer, survivor pudding and BBQ and chili at least that‚Äôs what I do. For survivor, escape cake and bp perks pretty easy.
---
Yeah, you are right, but fun part is i have got stuck into the middle of the pallet, like at the old, fun times on PC)
---
I tunnel and give no fucks
---
She was opening the gate, you interrupted her, trash killer
---
This is the same tired BS you'll always hear.
---
Somehow survivors are the super leet skill role, and killers are easy mode
---
Delusional idiots lol
---
Is she vaulting? Is she using her power? Maybe she‚Äôs standing still.
---
What amazing skill!
---
Killer is purple, OP is orange.
---
Please don‚Äôt post that assholes content here....
---
Apparently it was to stop people cheating for blood points. Even though it doesn't actually stop people.
---
I honestly see no good reason to keep it. There are people that say that it'd mean people maxing out characters immediately, like it's a bad thing, but how does that matter anyway?
---
Only know for killer but bbq and chilli survivor pudding is my usual for farming blood points
---
Seems like you got outplayed.
---
I get it I just don‚Äôt find it entertaining or even funny.
---
YUP I was just testing builds with my friend to try and get this to work. Even with the purple paper addon it still takes 5 hits. What kind of shit is this?
---
OHHHH okay thank you :) I assumed the killer had posted this
---
**Stranger Boofs**
---
I don't run noed myself except on my rare end game builds, but trust me when I say this, do bones. 
---
When survivors do bones, noed becomes useless. If survivors always do this, noed is always useless. Killers won't run a useless perk. If people want killers to stop using noed, they have the power to make it useless themselves.
---
I have had many games as survivor where I've gone around cleansing a few totems making noed not activate. Plus it's about 2000-5000 bloodpoints depending on how many you cleanse, and that's not including post game bonuses.
---
Don't worry I hate him too. But that Chonkface tho
---
He's pretty hot if you ask me
---
What a god! McLean is the best.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if he had an add-on that allows him to just eat everyone :P
---
Your gonna want to play doctor or legion for lots of points, i say legion since i assume your new? Other than bbq and chilli there is no quick and easy way of farming bloodpoints, you just play
---
DbD vs Overwatch: Which community is more toxic?

Was this post just an excuse to pepper in that "stumped" pun?

Your chapter was good

Good enough that some of the ideas were ACTUALLY implemented

Keep up the good work man your fan chapters are some of the best
---
Its spelt Laurie!
---
Yeah screw ForkRight
---
People are stupid for that.  Big difference between a Nurse who can actually blink and one that struggles.  Also, though it really depends on the addons.  3+ blinks even struggle nurses should be able to down rather easily.
---
No nurse or spirit, no more, that‚Äôs fun, I particularly like going against billy
---
Don't you mean shrek when?
---
Killer complains about toolboxes even though he has fanklins
---
Survivor: (laughs in pallet)
---
Or candyman?
---
Ok i know that its low quality shitpost, but this is just bad
---
To be fair bubba is the only killer in the game that has a reward for just kills.
---
Ah yes, because those two perks are totally anti-tunnel tools. Except they're not. They're perks that allow survivors to play totally brain dead and ballsy because the killer is literally powerless against them.
---
It's "Laurie", but the effort is worth 1.000.000 upvotes
---
No and I‚Äôll tell you why. Since you lack the means of communication with the opposing team, trying to be nice equates to you being a newb or an idiot. People don‚Äôt go into trials with the assumption the opposing player is gonna be nice, so it‚Äôs not a clear message
---
Try to give a random survivor the hatch and see how often they struggle away because they are clueless
---
Eeesh sorry I use a perk,
---
P3 legion main: (Laughs I‚Äôm sloppy butcher and Ebony Mori)
---
They were just assembling the pieces of the puzzle, no malicious intent here
---
Y‚Äôall realize that this isn‚Äôt gonna change a thing people are still gonna need to cleanse totems and they won‚Äôt
---
Did you ever play Left 4 Dead 2? Weird question I know but I promise it's related. In L4D2 one of the playable characters, Ellis, is fond of telling stories about his "buddy Keith" and such stories include 
---
"My buddy Keith tried camping out on top of a building once. He was shooting crows, but the police were too busy teargassin' him to ask what he was doin' up there. He screamed for an entire year every single time he opened his eyes! Oh, man! At first, it was funny; then it just got sad, but then it got funny again! Oh, man!"
---
And
---
"I ever tell you about the time my buddy Keith drowned in the¬†Tunnel of Love? You wouldn't think it could happen 'cause the water's so shallow, but that's how it gets you, man.¬†Overconfidence.¬†Keith was with his lady at the time, and he was yellin' for her to save him, but she didn't want to get wet."
---
I bring this up because I feel like Ace would be the type of guy to tell stories if a similar calibre but rather than bring about "my buddy keith" it would be about himself can you dig it
---
Something wrong? I just see a nea looking at a open chest
---
Oh ok. thanks. I understand now
---
there was a "bug" with survivors sounds some weeks ago. 
---
That was a period where Spirit was actually a mindgaming killer since you had a fair chance to lose her during chases.
---
Weirdly‚Ä¶ there wasn't much Spirit playing at this time.
---
boo you do boo
---
Like Leigon is literaly just an Evil Survivor and Dart is... well Dart.
---
I don't see how we couldnt get a fricking Xenomorph or Purge character one day.
---
Inner strength is expected to become meta, and thus people will be hunting the totems more than ever.
---
It's not "toxic", it's a basic strategy of the game. The killer kills. It's not toxic if the killer does not adhere to some stupid rules imposed by the survivors.
---
it was not intentional at first but i had to keep it in
---
It‚Äôs like a solid 7(slugging) even when I gen rush I feel a little bit bad
---
You can play with the timer and make the killer waste time on you. As in force the killer to tunnel you. DS is as amazing as ever in either case, punishes a tunnel, or let's you go for risky plays to buy more time for gens. There were so many times i see a downed survivor and think "well I hope they have DS".
---
Specifcaly a sped up version of 2:20-2:52 with added bassline and synths during a chase.
---
They're removing noed and totems?
---
Im thinking it probably won't be because of the blood and gore. When I first showed the game to my friend, he felt sick when he first saw a survivor get hooked. So the game is probably not for everyone to enjoy.
---
There's nothing else to do in this game, but playing with meme build and ranking up...
---
You have cursed this land and yourself with scratched mirror bad luck
---
Do you wanna share a bath with me tonight?
---
None of that was said, none of us t-bagged, none of us had items. We were just having fun too. Did you miss the part where we apologized to the killer?
---
Just spam M1 in treatment
---
camgaming more like camping haha
---
I'm just an entity main *shrugs*
---
What was he thinking lmao
---
just wait at a reasonable distance from the hook to let the killer lose his chaser emblem points while he's camping.
---
yeah, killer trying to win the game is obviously the most sweaty strategy we can think of.
---
It is hard to use this perk correctly
---
Pig from Sesame Street, you mean?
---
I‚Äôm not new I‚Äôm just asking wanting to how some other people get bloodpoints and try their ways.
---
'cause you don't win anything from securing just this kill.
---
There's only one crutch perk for killers left in the game and it rhymes with Oh Pun Escapes Meth.  If you ain't running that than survivors can fuck off with their complaining on what perks you're running.  Ruin is only an issue for bad survivors anyways.  All they have to do is practice their skillchecks.
---
You're on the precipice. Once you start to find *that* funny, you're there.
---
Yea of course, Prayer Beads + Mothers Ring or smth like that is really hard to counter (unless you use Spine Chill the best perk in the game) And Omega Blink Nurse has literally no downsides and is OP.
---
That is... that is fantastic!
---
i would say also completely your dailies get you a good amount of blood points. the hassle there is actually getting good ones that aren‚Äôt asking you to mori survivors. otherwise, if i want to get more bloodpoints i play killer. they seems to get more bloodpoints in general than survivors.
---
Have you played high ranks as a killer? Spending all your time on one person is how 3 gens get done completely uncontested. Lol
---
That's a guessing game, not a mindgame. A mindgame is a skill that makes the other person guess based off of what the player has done previously or other players do. A guessing game is a no skill guess based on nothing except you can hear the survivors movement moans and footsteps and see corn/grass move in phasing. Her counter is to run a perk which is fucking ridiculous. It's not a mindgame if the other player can't guess what they will do.
---
Then that‚Äôs goes for adrenaline as well
---
If you shine it in their eyes it blinds them, but depending on the light/add ons you have it could give the killer time to look up or away so they dont get blinded. If you are going for flashlight saves they have to be done with the animation of picking them up before it will work. So the timing is pretty hard to get down. Same for pallet stuns.

Not much people knows about the Doc toxic potential as a camper.

I posted a thread about it looong ago in reddit to try to get this remove.

Or if killer decides to camp you, it's also very possible, that you used/did something noone likes, like BNP, insta heal, abusing some windows, tbagging every time after dropping every goddamn pallet like you're rank 21, thinking you're so smart, etc.

cause half the survivors to disconnect the instant they hit someone

I don't think deliverance nor unbreakable are THAT meta

I apologize for my actions

I love this

Honestly I've had more luck with flashlight hit boxes if I aim for their mouth not their eyes exactly. It seems to focus the light into the blind

been slowly leveling ms.pig, got some cool addons and i've really been enjoying her ability to crouch and remove her terror radius

Switch that knife to 2 meters long sword and everything will be 100% accurate.

Again, how is that toxic
---
Sure bud whatever makes you sleep at night
---
It‚Äôs not toxic it‚Äôs just really agitating
---
Moonwalking made him absolutely inescapable, plus if he missed it didn't deplete his power, and had quick recovery. He also had an add-on combo that made him hell to play against.
---
That doesn't mean they are removing totems. And noed is still gonna be strong
---
And his heartbeat is replaced with his theme
---
I'm literally dying after seeing that DC icon :P
---
So what you're saying is that it's.. ***a gamble***?
---
Lets see who's really under the mask
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt play the game for other people to have fun
---
that's a dangerous process of thinking‚Ä¶
---
What if now every one was playing swf with external comm and insta heals + borrowed + DS and map offerings + Hazy reagents ?
---
 Just you know‚Ä¶ 'cause every one decided that we have to go all out to win and too bad for the killer experience.
---
They could attack spam with little cooldown, they were faster and could vault faster, when they hit someone the survivor had to mend, if they hit the same survivor again the timer would go down a chunk (which you could down people with). They also had an exploit where survivors timer would go while they would chase them.
---
Overall, they were really unenjoyable to play against. You couldn‚Äôt outplay cause there was no punishment for legion. However, the current legion is just unenjoyable to play cause of all the drawbacks.
---
Why do you think it's toxic? Everyone else is showing some points but you're not giving me much.
---
Every on e except lerys. Goddamn lerys
---
Not what I said. I said at low ranks that's just unnecessary. Playing killer at low ranks is literally the easiest thing you can do in this game.
---
/r/4PanelCringe

even just a half-assed version where the screen simply flickers with decreased brightness a few times. just not where it gives anyone seizures

I love it I‚Äôm making a DBD map in Fortnite rn hahaha love it

Could have four animatronics on the map at one and have it so they walk around mabey revel whoever's they see then have it so you controlled one at a time and can teleport to any one of the other 3 as the power.  Hell could have a puppet box spawn in a open part of the map that if not interacted with  every 2 or 4 minutes everyone gets an exposed effect till someone doesm
---
Is it just me or should iron maiden be buffed considering 2 of the meta perks (assuming inner strength becomes meta) involves lockers? Decisive is the other btw.
---
It's not *just* the bloody outfit. That's merely the cosmetic. Each time you prestige up, you get a slightly increased chance to get rarer and rarer items in your bloodweb, at the cost of getting more common stuff less often. Having someone dump tons and tons of BP into a character to get them P3 50'd on the first day would be horribly unbalanced, not to mention unfair to everyone else. There's a reason there's a cap.
---
I cant even play this on android:/
---
I'm confused on the first survivor perk, could you please explain
---
Yeah, it isn't. Nurse is one of my most played killers. Recently I've started to actually manage to get my head around the blink. Had a guy use Dead Hard against me, missed my hit. Didn't really bother me considering I got him 5 seconds later after the fatigue ended.
---
It depends. Tbag here and there? Gonna ignore that. Tbag after literally any pallet, vault and flashlight clicking every given opportunity? You want that attention and you will get that attention.
---
TBH I'd be fine with it if they made it happen less often, but let the killer know when it happens. As it is, the killer literally has no idea when it's happening, and some players don't even know it happens!
---
It's just LUCK when you get screwed over by it as survivor.
---
Funny I was just told to kill myself over a match and I really didn't care about. Aren't survivors fantastic.
---
I think it‚Äôs fine as is they got to leave the locker at some point.
---
It's still annoying though
---
Ps4
---
Pebble was a creative idea, I wish they could‚Äôve made it better
---
I just think the exposed effect should last a lot longer
---
That‚Äôs fair it‚Äôs not a bad idea
---
Oh. Then I got it wrong, sorry. :D
---
Less stereotype more statistics.
---
Claudette is almost invisible in tall grass so that's why people playing stealthy main her often. There are enough other chairs to fit everyone's taste to have an overabundance of immersed players on Claudette
---
School is starting soon which sucks but at least we get a double bp event soon. Hyped for that.
---
I don't understand what alot of you expect from the guy, like does he have to admit every time he makes a mistake? He's confident and that really shouldn't be held against him.
---
Well cus he'd vault it near-instantly.
---
I have. But have **YOU** played perkless bubba in red ranks? Have **YOU** played without a ruin on Trapper? I don't think so. It's still better to have only 3 survivors repairing gens instead of 4. It's a huge difference. 3 gens will get done that quickly anyway, no matter if you camp or not.
---
I didn't say that camping is a legit strat giving you 4k each game on every killer, against 5 man SWF with insta heals and BNPs. I just said, that you don't know how many times your game gets way more intense whilst camping than it would if you weren't camping at all :P Everyone going for the save, BT, grabs, hits, survivors doing absolutely nothing. Ofc smarter survivors will just do all 5 gens and escape, but not every survivor is the smarter one :P
---
Uhm. Spirit?
---
For me Ace is actually (and sadly) on rank 2 for most tbaggers who play as that char. (However nobody is even close to threatening Meg at no. 1)
---
True but the robots still kill for revenge like the spirit. But could have spring trap the animatronic purple guy got trapped in.
---
I didn‚Äôt see it on sale
---
I know that, i am familiar with IT a lot, but i was laughing so hard, when this happened.
---
That was just funny and familiar as hell.
---
Imagine 8-bit DbD.
---
I‚Äôve used 3 different ones lol
---
Talking Trash In endgame chat, sandbagging on purpose, tbaging on a hooked person and not unhooking, etc.
---
I just want to know how you think slugging is toxic
---
So, normally, when you M1 as killer when a survivor is trying to get an unhook, you grab them.
---
However, survivors can counter this by, when they see you approaching or think you're going to swing or w/e, stopping the hook animation and standing there. The M1 becomes a normal attack, and they have enough time during the blood wipe to get an actual unhook.
---
Doctor avoids this in Treatment because his M1, while still able to grab, *cannot* whiff into a basic swing - meaning that if the survivor cancels the unhook animation, Doctor can cancel his charge likewise, and they're back to square one.
---
Basically, you can never mind game Doctor into whiffing a grab into a basic swing and cannot trap him in the blood wipe animation, so if he's camping, he's extremely difficult to get around. The only way to get around it is having two people dive the hook and have the first get grabbed and the second get the unhook. But then now he just hooks the first person, and he also gets a free hit too because grabbing someone successfully puts him in Punishment.
---
Wow why do you judge the nea mains, I just am good at the game not toxic (then again some killers think pallet looping I'd toxic and I get face camped anyway) üòï
---
Only rule is don‚Äôt camp a hooked survivor if you‚Äôre just bad at the game. Other than that you do you.
---
But they have DS so whatever.
---
not hard to be fair.
---
Do they hide inside a locker?
---
I have no idea why, but this style reminds me of the MAD cartoons and comics. But this is still an amazing drawing!
---
If my game crashes there's a 95% chance it's during the loading screen. Really rarely does it crash during or after a match, so it could just be that. If you have 5 people loading in that's a potential 5 people whose game could crash.
---
Inner Strength, DS, and Head-On.
---
I like to call this build
---
"Coming out of the closet."
---
Well akshually use your brain, removing survivors closer to elimination is always more efficient than targeting ones further than it, this really isn't that complicated.
---
Yeah, I just disabled the option on my PS4 of allowing ppl to message me if they weren‚Äôt my friend lol
---
PS4 - juicycherub. I‚Äôm a purple rank survivor main and always down to do swf or kyf. Also just saying this now. If you see me online, invite me and I don‚Äôt join that means I‚Äôm already in a full party üòÖ.
---
I love Franklins on the doctor when he already has rank 3 distressing a purple Order add-on for even bigger TR radius. Doctor's can't be toxic enough, I'm in need of more malpractice sues!
---
(Laughs in Texan)
---
üëÄ?!!
---
I don‚Äôt t-bag ;-;
---
This Trapper looks like the Crapper.
---
Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks for the new info.
---
What rank?
---
That didnt worked for some reason
---
Hackers. if a player have BP over the cap they could ban the person cause they knew he was hacking
---
On the bright side, since then I've never had a game quite as frustrating.
---
Rank 10 playing with my sister who's rank 18
---
Thus either means we'll get it after 1 week of testing, and it will release hopefully on the day of the Bloodhunt or a bit earlier, or we won't be getting the PTB for a few weeks which is pretty unlikely, because we can't have the PTB overlap with the Bloodhunt.
---
\*sniffs\*  
---
I smell hook camping is going to intensify!
---
Sorry you don‚Äôt understand common logic? Just because you disagree on your opinion doesn‚Äôt make it wrong.
---
Don't do stupid comparaison like that.
---
Removing someone from the game has nothing to do with doing the objective 'cause the killer isn't interrupting you. 
---
Try to stay objective. 
---
The killer can patrol your gen, interrupt you, pop it etc. Doing gens isn't tryharding as survivor it's just the only think the game actually ask you to do : repair gen, escape. 
---
Tryharding as survivor is playing swf with external communication while bringing really strong stuff like insta heal and a key.
---
It's a vicious cycle. Survs get destroyed by Nurse or Spirit with bullshit addons, get frustrated, let their frustration out on weaker killers. Wweaker killer players get mad about BM and bullshit perks, play Spirit or Nurse with bullshit addons and let their frustraion out on survs, which is easiest when survs are not running the most bullshit items/perks. The cycle continues.    
---
"Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game" comes to mind.
---
Ah yes, I saw that and upvoted! I like your style! Keep posting, maybe work it out some more because it's actually really good
---
I wish it was more common. The game in its simplest form boils down to killer vs. survivor, but it's easy to forget that doesn't mean the community has to be the same way.
---
How do u do that???????
---
You need to gambe it to: notway,denmark,sweeden or finland And you will need an valid phone number adress And Postal code
---
Nah id probably drink with wraith or doctor tho
---
Thank u, I‚Äôm thinking on doing nea next
---
Overused is probably quick and quiet. Just doesn't seem like that great of a perk.
---
Underused would be lightweight. It makes such a big difference, and I expect it's popularity to rise once fixated comes out and people can see the difference.
---
Go for it! :)
---
This is because there are remote computers that are required to make a connection between the killer and the survivors. I'm going to simplify things a little bit, so the description below isn't exactly what happens, but it's similar.
---
Lets just use a nice round number and say there are 100 computers that are connecting killers and survivors. For simplicity's sake, we'll say that each computer can only connect one group at a time, so there's really no point in allowing more than 100 lobbies to exist at any given time.
---
When a killer goes to start a game, the game checks to see if there are any open computers to connect them to other players. If 100 people are already waiting for games, then the killer will not get a lobby right away. They'll be standing in line to get in to a lobby.
---
In the end, it doesn't really increase the amount of time it takes to find a game, because you'll only get a game when there are survivors available. You just don't have a lobby open because there are so many other killers waiting ahead of you for a game.
---
It's not toxic at all, it's just frustrating how quickly gens can get done when all survivors are optimal. It is even quicker when it is a 4-man SWF. We also are in a no heal meta at the moment, which means that survivors will stay injured to repair gens, as adrenaline will give them the heal. 
---
At red ranks, I can only keep up the pressure with billy at the moment. I don't play Nurse or Spirit.
---
It's a Bug, and it didn't Actually Complete the gen saldy ;-;
---
If games are meant to be enjoyed maybe dont play spirit
---
I would‚Äôve rather seen Hopper instead of Steve if I‚Äôm being 100% honest.
---
**bold**Not scientifically possible!
---
Devs literally said she is a stealth killer. She has no terrorradius when in phasewalk and you can remove the phasesound too. Even with phasesound you dont know where she is, you just know she is somewhere. Which is in fact the case when playing against any stealth killer :)
---
The Clown
---
This does seem like the survivor perk out of the 6 that people will most likely complain about. The complaints I already saw about it is if you pair this with DS and Head On, and have the scenario of jumping into a locker after getting unhooked, where the killer has no way to do anything to you without you coming out on top.
---
And to that I say good, you're using 3 perks all with an activation requirement and they all happen to work in sync with one another.
---
The worst I can see them doing to this perk is making it timed, like "60 seconds after cleansing a totem if you hop in a locker you will heal after 8 seconds" which will probably kill the perk like they always do to survivor perks.

This perk is the right kind of strong with the right kind of requirements to activate and the right amount of limited use, I just hope it isn't touched at all.
---
r/uncroppedmisfortune
---
does he actually say that?
---
Holy shit lol
---
What do you have against people that suck on others‚Äô mutilated fingers man?
---
An underrated perk that I, myself, don't use often, but can help is Technician. I have had multiple times, especially on corn maps where the killer is patrolling gens in the corn and I am doing one of those gens with Technician and since they don't hear the gen, they just leave it. I did that twice to the same LF in one match on the Thompson House map. He didnt know I was on the gen, because he was just trying to listen for the sound and he turned around and left without noticing me on it. Rank 6 at the time btw.
---
An overrated perk I feel would be Spirit Fury. I know, I know, the perk can come through half of the time, but if you hit a killer with Spirit Fury/Enduring and you have a window nearby, then it doesn't matter, becuase you still won't get the hit and you will have wasted the perk. On top of that, the combo waists 2 perk slots that could be used for other, way better things.
---
You pretty much described it perfectly. I don't mind Nurses too much since I had to suffer for the Adept Nurse trophy on PS4 and I'm sure she is better on PC haha. The killer I've had more trouble with is Billy over Spirit or Nurse but then again he's also pretty good. I do find cutie survivors and I usually let them get hatch or something but that's so rare man. It's gotten to the point where I bought Spirit and said fuck it.
---
Imagine taking time out of your day to delay a game instead of just winning because you want to have the last laugh in a video game. We aren't just killer mains, I love to see toxic face camping killers get head on juked and both the survivor and the hooked escape. But if you're gonna tbag at the exit gates and waste my time bc you'd rather slap your control key, then I'm gonna feel the satisfaction of 100 satisfaction complications on YouTube if you get dumpstered like this
---
Kinda weird seeing an HD Bruce Campbell figurine ngl. That being said that cable management by OP tho, üëå
---
Dear christ yes
---
I'm at my most comfortable when I'm on gens, tbh. I need to get better at looping, though. I feel like all of the time I've spent doing gens has resulted in me not being very good in chases. 
---
I've never heard someone refer it quite that way and I won't lie, it's a bit refreshing. People usually don't think quite so positively about gen jockeys.
---
Before I get flamed, this is just a concept I made for fun because I figured with all the licensed DLC coming out, Scream Queens would make a perfect addition to the game. The perks are in no way meant to be serious or balanced (I‚Äôm not a dev) but I tried my best.
---
Nb4 it's a broken key but you pick it anyways because they all share the same model.

---
Nerf made him absolutely useless, Devs instead of reworking him just nerfed everything, every stat, every add-on, they just added him 5% movement speed. Nothing more. 
---
Before the nerf you could hit a survivor in frenzy, hit them again, get stunned, wait for your frenzy to regenarate a little bit (you could use your frenzy at any given moment, it didn't have to be fully "recharged"), hit a survivor, get stunned, wait for frenzy, hit a survivor in frenzy last time and down them. 4 hits in frenzy to down a survivor. With a purple add-on it was 3 hits. You could always just M1 without using the frenzy, like nowadays, after the nerf. There was no counterplay for survivors, as legion could vault pallets and vaults way quicker, no midngaming was needed. 
---
Now the deep wound status effect is stopped whilst you're in killer's Terror Radius. Before the nerf it was stopped only whilst survivor was in a chase. So killers could exploit that, look at different directions, look at the ground, look behind (unfamous moonwalking strat) and survivor would go down eventually. 
---
Legion was bad, even worse than Freddy before the rework, you needed 4 swings in your frenzy to down someone! Game as a killer is all about time efficiency, so Legion was just **bad**. Really bad. But the thing was, that everyone complained not about Legion being too OP (at least the reasonable people), but about the fact, that there was no counter to Legion (you really couldn't do anything, because Legion was faster, was vaulting faster and could swing multiple times without stopping his Frenzy), so people were DCing **A LOT** when they saw a legion, they wanted a **rework,** but we got a nerf. Heavy nerf.
---
I know right, like even just rereading his messages today, still gives me the chills....The thing about this story is that it only happened 3 months ago....So he could still be out for blood.
---
Bubba getting eaten? Ironic.
---
Someone found out that in the game bindings file there's a place for emote 3 and emote 4. Probably also voice chat.
---
Def not fun
---
Banned, because you've been spamming this
---
Even though it's a worthwhile goal to play in good faith and host a great experience, remember you ultimately can't please everyone (and you are, after all, playing the antagonist). However, I would say learn to read your survivors: it's good for your general strategy anyway, and you'll also get a sense of what THEIR playstyle is so you can match it, whether it's racing to compete against a technical player, or playing up the mood and tension with a more role-playing player. Or, hell, even just batting around a newbie for a little while, whether you decide to pick them off or let them loose to find them later 
---
I would say rather than focus on what will piss others off, think about what YOU would want in a DbD experience and try to provide that: pick out your favorite Killer that represents the kind of horror that scares you, and play them up to thrill and scare
---
Pre-nerf Legion was Thanos.
---
100% this. Especially against Trappers and Hags. At least with Trappers and Hags I can understand 'checking on them', because you have the option to trap it, but I literally don't get the point with any other killer. I suppose the argument could be 'I wanted to see the spot it's in' but you're increasing the chance it gets found sooner, so?...
---
no i have not

Watched this scene like 10 minutes ago
---
Adorable comic and I love it! I know that my main is in the upper half (Huntress), but I just honestly love her. I love the fact that she's a slower killer, her hum is really soothing, and she's just really fun. I'll never be an Umbra level, but she's still my favorite
---
No worries! Hag is coming!
---
Did you overclock?
---
Hello to you too
---
Eh I'd rather have him wear a undamaged version of the spring Bonnie outfit then having him just be springtrap also have purple skin to so he can look extra freaky
---
They probably don‚Äôt care about the random teamate only if the swf escapes. I‚Äôm guessing in their heads it was like this ‚ÄúGonna unhook‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take hits ‚ÄúOh well killers here bye‚Äù
---
Do not be ashamed. We all were baby killers at one point
---
Not sure? I don‚Äôt know what that means to be honest
---
Are you brain damaged? At rank 1 everyone has lvl 50 characters, what unfair advantages does me also level up the new character to lvl 50 bring? Should I just use a lvl 1 character until i grind enough bloodpoints with it to get it to lvl 50?
---
Cha cha real smooth
---
I do too lol. I could be doing my job as a kilelr by killing people or as a survivor by running the killer around for a while, and they give me death threats after the game is over with, no matter if they win or not.
---
I was indeed lucky that I had friends with me, otherwise he would've still been terrorising me with all 3 of his accounts going against me.
---
And it got taken down once.
---
Just a quick comment, Addy ignores exhaustion.
---
You didn't know that? That's a survivor rule number 537475 in the Hag section.
---
Good idea, but if it gets nerfed people will probably cry ‚ÄúNerf No Ed too!‚Äù
---
i know. it was dumb, i was just making a pun
---
David‚Äôs are a peaceful species. You know not what you say.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is playing killer makes you bitter. You get BMed every other match, called trash when you win or lose.
---
He is coming from that place of bitterness. You've just got to let him know you aren't like that. If he doesn't want advice giving it to him will just make him even more upset
---
now you know how the devs feel.
---
I'd happily trade a nerf/getting rid of adrenaline if it meant the same for NOED.
---
I‚Äòm just like that. As a surv main, I know that it‚Äòs disgusting bring tunneled, so I don‚Äòt tunnel (except people who teabag at pallets)
---
its because this shitty game isnt balanced at all which causes frustration and fuels the toxic bitter hatred between survs and killers
---
instead of people writing out a dissertation on toxic behavior they should instead redirect that energy towards BHVR which continues to do nothing about it all
---
Thanks for the google definition smartass.

I watch tru3 daily. I've learned alot from him.

Again, monsters were never against the rules, the rule was always "humanoids". Plus, this is the thousandth thread today about a xenomorph. In addition, predator just got a new assymetrical game, it's unlikely they are going to toss the rights to a xenomorph to another similar game
---
The cap is 1 million, so 1:1
---
Typical response and can't see how toxic this community is, why do you think borrowed time is meta now huh???
---
Kinda hoping we get a Steve cosmetic dressed as Hopper with a stache.
---
Why? It's completely useless, so just don't use it.
---
One thing i find super helpful is trying to put myself in the killers shoes.
---
Today i was in a game on azarovs and i was running to a pallet in the bus and in my head i said "shes obviously seeing that my scratch marks are nearing towards this pallet so shes probably going to try and meet me there.
---
As soon as i made it to the pallet i used my dead hard, threw the pallet down, and stunned her mid phase. When you get to higher ranks its crucial to try and use some advanced thinking.
---
chestbusrster
---
Ruin seems pointless to run, imo. Ik it's a good perk, but it gets destroyed so quickly, it seems like a waste of a perk slot.
---
So using a perk is toxic now? Plus if they are nurse, they're already the best killer in the game

Im not saying I camp... fyi... it doesn't make any sense.

I'm a killer main... I know the feeling. But I don't act bitter because someone was toxic to me. If people are acting nice to me than I act nice back, I don't call them stupid and yell at them.
---
Uuuuuhhhhh, how did I do this every time? As you can see, I have big brain.

Dang, I should‚Äôve made a joke about that

No problem! Amazon is probably your best bet then. If you search Fun World Ghostface you should find their official Amazon store. Where do you live, just curiosly?

Stop it. Bad.

Shoo.
---
Place traps randomly as you patrol the map, the survivors will take similar paths
---
Nothing just a month before he sent me messages with his main account the typical trash, p ... , noob and then I blocked him, this time I knew he was the killer and i decided to play immersive, and evade him, he was so desperate looking for me, while he was looking for me I repair 3 gens, and other player and me escape, he was so angry because he couldn't find me and use the moriü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Oh absolutely. My highest playtime is on the Wraith(who isn't exactly good). I also play Pig, Trapper and Ghostface but I steer clear of playing Billy and other really good killers besides maybe Ghostface. Recently though in the purple and red ranks, SWF and survivors in general just don't care about my fun so why should I care about theirs?

Are consoles hackable? I feel this only applies to PC. I could be wrong, but I don't see why consoles would be a problem.

I mean even if ruin gets destroyed in one minute, if you can get a hook or 2 out of it, you've already put the momentum in your favor.
---
I already am decent with spirit. I need to practice some more, since I haven't played her in a while, but I've already been good with her. I'm not new to the game, either.

You can still get really good with nurse on console and why wouldnt Billy be good?
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. He's only level 4 and i have prestiged nearly every other killer
---
"dunno, just running around killing everrybody"
---
Honestly I think all killer abilities are annoying as a survivor, but they are all still fun to play
---
So the rest of your team finished the gens and guaranteed an escape, right? Because that's what competent people do
---
That was one of his biggest problems, being a bad killer meant nothing while playing him. Every single killer is punished for missing a swing ( which they should be) and you want him to be the only one that doesn't?
---
Kitty should have dropped the pallet on you
---
So?
---
I always have the outlook that if I get at least 1 hook before Ruin gets destroyed then it did its job. Ruin is a very good perk for slowing the game
---
And the clown also has to refill his bottles and get slowed down by doing so, Potentially losing the chase. Freddy can just place them around and doesnt even get slowed and has 8 of them. While i love clown im kinda a freddy main now but my idea for a clown buff was to give him haste bottles, it would make him a bit more interesting. Lets say that he has 4 more bottles that he can switch to in his base kit which give him and the survivors in it the haste effect. He could catch up to suvivors more easily and can also switch to slow down bottles.
---
I need the nurse cosmetic already.
---
Been playing the game for about a month now on ps4 and got to red ranks in survivor and purple ranks with killer.  Just started playing killer a bit more and using ruin to slow down progression of gens is hit and miss with totem spawns.
---
Ideally as killer you need to down someone and hook at least one or two people before the first gen is done as then they will get off gens to rescue which can create a cycle of hooking and rescuing that automatically makes the game take longer.  If you cannot create this cycle it becomes difficult to maintain control/pressure on the outcome.
---
You probably already know this stuff and it is definitely harder to perform than talk about let me know if there is any area other than being gen rushed that is bothering you.
---
Its gen tunneling and camping, totally toxic and unfair and ruins the fun for the killer because it assists in survivor success. #stopgentunneling

"One time, the Army bombed my buddy Keith. He went camping and didn't bother to read the signs, and I guess they were just testing bombs that day. All sorts of stuff, too, not just regular bombs. Like biological nerve-gas bombs, shrapnel bombs, these bombs that break up in the air into, like, a hundred smaller bombs..."
---
Well that escalated quickly
---
He's right though. We literally already have repeat names. 2 davids for starters
---
The.
---
DS was already looked into, they nerfed the hell out of it. Don't chase the person that just came of the hook it is an easy counter.

So basically you facecamp and ring the bell

"Don't run noed"  
---
Actual comment I got from folk running adrenaline and self care
---
I would recomend spirit bc its just one of the best killers. After that i would say clown bc of his perks.

The hero we need, but do not deserve
---
That was intense...
---
"YoU dIdN't PlAy HoW i WaNtEd YoU tO pLaY,

---
I'd get Freddy, Spirit, and Michael Myers. Their parks aren't all that great but they're some of the more fun killers to play as.
---
Spirit
---
Freddy
---
Michael Myers
---
Ghost Face
---
Legion
---
Plague
---
Clown
---
Pig
---
That's the order I'd suggest buying them in. Not based on perks but how fun the killer is to play.
---
Pig is the only one I don't like to play as at all.
---
Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero
---
You're not wrong, but isn't he called Detective Tapp in-game?
---
Bruh
---
I just hope u were humming the lullaby the entire time u were at the con :P
---
He or she?
---
I've been foiled
---
Wraith is actually really good but when u get to red ranks everyone just gen rush.
---
Here we see a baby survivor
---
Doesn't matter, still two Davids, and they didn't release that far apart either
---
&gt; that‚Äôs what ~~competent people~~ people who have played the game for more than 10 hours do 
---
New players struggle to even find gens, let alone complete them all in two minutes.
---
Is she single tho
---
This whole argument is kind of explaining why I just don't care and play the game my way. If I only kill two people, or die right inside the exit gate by a mori, so be it. I'm gonna play the game with the dumb or strong or niche or downright silly build if I feel like I want to. 
---
And I hope others I play with get at least a little chuckle out of the shenanagins that ensue
---
Nobody said shit about not using level 50 characters. You're completely missing the point, or you're playing super thick, one of the two.
---
And I've been rank 1 before. What was your point about bringing up rank, again?
---
Bullshit.
---
This is what I expected when I watched the Once Upon A Toxic Misty video
---
I usually use perks that help him end the chase faster since he's mostly an M1 killer with a slight incovenience (his power).
---
Perks being, Brutal Strengh, Bamboozle, Nurses Calling and Sloppy
---
You can change nurses and sloopy for something else if you want.
---
Or you can use the typical not giving a fuck about your plets build and go Brutal, Enduring, Spirit Fury and i think Ruin or something

Play the game how you want to play. If you wanna camp, tunnel, t-bag, flash light click, then do it. Do what makes you happy, regardless of what players think of you.

Honestly seems kinda op to me. You can tunnel one guy and you get a rewarded for it. There should be a way to get rid of facehuggers.

No, they didn't put in 2010 Nancy because they knew not a lot of people liked her. Hence, they went with Quentin.

Let's see, pre nerf decisive strike,  that was toxic from day one of it's release, a lot of survivors think noed is toxic, and most nurse mains hate dead hard for obvious reasons nurse related reasons.

Jesus, how old is this gif

I think Wraith is fantastic. My favorite killer to play as.
---
Me too, but the biggest hope is that nothing gets nerfed.

Who?

Nah, they already got trapper,, he's basically the dbd equivalent of Jason... if Jason would step anywhere near the game it would probably be a Trapper Cosmetic Easter Egg
---
Wow nothing gets past you
---
well, if there's a player that can escape every time as nancy, then that would be accurate, she's a badass.
---
Thank you, im satisfied with that

I honestly wasn't sure because I'm not familiar with either franchise.
---
It was. The whole time I was waiting for the other survivor to open gate. I was chased the whole time, could've opened it sooner.

It was late at night I was tired and wanted to show how bad and stupid I am before I go to bed

If a survivor murdered a Killer, then they themselves would replace the murdered Killer as a servant of the entity. It would be an endless loop.
---
Summer ends on September 21. They have said they're still on track to meet that deadline.

I had the same problem, the start is incredibly slow.. But at episode 6 shit hits the fan and gets really interesting

The number of meta perks (on both sides) isn't likely to change. All a 5th slot would do is increase the grind for new players.

I highly doubt it by the way the f13 devs were treated by the license holders
---
My vote is the first option. Nancy might get better cosmetics in the future and the perks for both her and the demigorgon will definitely be worth the buy.
---
I‚Äôm still new so maybe as I play more these ‚Äúrules‚Äù will make more sense, but honestly they all seem like BS. Like even face camping for example, if the killer does it then sure it kills that one survivor, but it gives the other 3 essentially an easy 3 gens. The killer gets one kill and that‚Äôs about it.
---
Imagine taking this seriously. Lmao fuck you
---
I main David too, but I‚Äôve come across a few who thought they were hot shit (until they died ofc)
---
If you look at the road map you would see it will come out when chapter 13 hits
---
No it's not, cause not matter what, if you play for fun or to win the result is always the same: dieing or being looped or escaping or killing. No matter what so nobody actually fucking cares.
---
Thats actuallt a pretty cool idea tbh. I would just switch like bt for calm spirit maybe?
---
You dropped this "/s"
---
lmao.
---
Watch it end up  being a Doctor.
---
Sorry i didnt think you really needed it
---
As a new player I‚Äôm rather sure killers just notice straight away or something.
---
Crouch go to generator, start working on it passing skill checks and here we go, killer is on me and will proceed to hunt me down all game. 
---
At this point I end up keeping it on me as long as possible so others can leave alive but man... survived a match only so far
---
Amulet and Prater beads are by far her best combo. As for perks it depends on how you play and what teachables you have
---
He could knock all of em out
---
I'm a Meg main because I have good perks on her and don't feel like leveling up any other survivors
---
&gt;Otzavarda
---
Ruin, haunted grounds, make your choice, discordance. Prayer beads and Movement speed add on
---
And then they ds you
---
Always lurking, internet stranger. :D
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury + Acid Blood is literally a free down on a healthy survivor for successfully stunning you with a pallet. Seems broken right there.
---
Enhanced senses and Hive Mind seem cool though.
---
That's evil. I love it
---
Imagine thinking unbreakable is unbalanced
---
I say we get David and Jeff to hold the legion down while Laurie shanks Legion with the stake of wood, we kill them one by one.
---
That's one less perk slot for her to have to counter your counter so it evens out
---
Damn the stolen posts are real
---
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE MORE
---
Spirit + Lag is an unstoppable force.
---
There's just not enough time to close the chases if you're going for 12 hooks if survivors are any good at looping and juking
---
You get Iridescent Shards from leveling up your Player Level
---
In the store if you have a Survivor/Killer locked you can click on them and then unlock them with 9000 Iridescent Shards (or 500 Auric Cells if you would rather just get the Survivor/Killer but spending cash on the DLC is cheaper to get both Survivor &amp; Killer)
---
Original Characters may be obtained via Iridescent Shards
---
Licensed Characters cannot be obtained via Iridescent Shards
---
The fact that they escape and you lose the whole game because of it...lol. And it‚Äôs not the real reason you lost anyway, just the scapegoat in your head
---
removed uncivil
---
If you can think of a nerf to noed that is comparable to the loud noise notification for Adrenaline I suggested, I would love to hear it
---
I mean, there's a difference between complaining and pointing out flaws in balance. Synergy is good, gaining too optimal an advantage off of it is not.
---
At full usage, this perk frees up 60 seconds all by itself for survivors (if you consider time used times the number of people participating, heals normally take 16 seconds x 2 people, or 32 seconds and one person with self care, and this item has 5 uses and requires 20 seconds to use, 12 for cleansing and 8 for healing, giving a 12 second margin of advantage 5 times, or 60 seconds), which is the same as DS give or take. Obviously it's not going to be as consistent as DS, but that's still especially strong given the synergies it has.
---
To be clear, I'm not saying the perk is or isn't overpowered because the perk isn't out. However, it's clearly going to be game-changing, and plenty of high-level players agree.
---
David and Jeff could easily snap Legion's neck like it was nothin' tbh.
---
This. Survivors who should be strong are weakened in this game, meanwhile homicidal maniacs can get stopped by... a piece of fucking wood. Especially Freddy, who is a literal god in his series, yet was the laughably *weakest* killer by far for over a year and a half.
---
Okay
---
Yes they're using the adult demogorgon but who's stopping trapper to put a leash and call it his pet lol.
---
In my head it looks just funny.
---
Asymmetrical horror game built on the concept of imbalance. People asking for game to be ‚Äúproperly balanced‚Äù. You don‚Äôt need to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù to enjoy the product. I‚Äôve lasted a long time and I‚Äôm trash.
---
It's not lag though, it's supposed to happen and it's annoying
---
Hag (Ruin)
---
Spirit (Spirit Fury)
---
Clown (bamboozle/PGTW)
---
Pig (Make your choice, survellience)
---
Legion (discordance)
---
Doc (ma)
---
MM (STBFL)
---
Rest as you choose since most other perks are meh
---
You can see their perks on mobile ?
---
No one gives a. About that. It's the fucking glitchy thing that happens when she walks
---
Once as I was searching the basement chest wraith came down to the basement and I just pointed at him to leave me be, and it worked haha he nodded and went back upstairs
---
A triumphant return, have some updoots good sir!
---
I was thinking specifically of the instance of staying in the game to save a teammate not knowing they‚Äôre on death hook; frankly when I think about how to improve the game I don‚Äôt even consider below rank 15, cause it‚Äôs usually a different game entirely . It would improve red rank game s
---
no....
---
Ya, instead of just seeing the other Survivors join in, it's more like Rainbow Six where you just see what Survivor they're playing and their loadout.
---
if you're..."enjoying" dead by daylight, you're not playing it right
---
Cool
---
"Show me your moves"!
---
‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù
---
I agree bleach should be baseline.
---
Lmaoo true like wtf were you doing all this time? I‚Äôm coming for you because you should be fully recovered by now
---
Getting revealed feels far worse than being disrespected. It feels like Entity laughing at you for being a loser.
---
If you have an honor code to live by then go for it. Are rules seriously being explained for an asymmetrical game from someone who plays characters I most likely won't be playing against?
---
I agree, console should also be able to type in the pre-game lobby.
---
Not to chat or anything, just for things like: I have auto-didact, let me heal! Stuff like that.
---
Self care is overused. Stop running self care
---
i agree that would be cool. but make it so if you get hurt like freddy goes threw it you get nothing
---
Hag, I would just go to a theme park and live on the rides. She wouldn't be tall enough to go on them so it's EZ mode.
---
Nah, not with the current perk system. If you have a perk allowance like say 5 points, and the best of the best take 2 points
---
Yes I know but when you‚Äôre in a laggy game, it‚Äôs even worse. It‚Äôs like she disappears for 3 seconds straight.
---
True, though if they really ever did all that I would hope they'd make an achievement that's just named "Chad is a dick" (reference to the FT13 Achievement) but in this case you'd get it when you leave through the exit gate while the other three survivors are downed/hooked
---
I love this idea...
---
Me: doing a gen minding my own business 
---
Spirits: I‚Äôm gonna do what we call a pro gamer move
---
Anytime my dude.
---
That could work, maybe it would give more points if you disarm the traps outside of a chase?
---
Yeah, but you can‚Äôt stay healthy forever. The solution to the problem can‚Äôt be ‚Äújust don‚Äôt get hit lol‚Äù since that doesn‚Äôt work
---
Same here, big-ass red stain would just throw me off and bait me into wasting pallets
---
Exactly! Or maybe you don‚Äôt get points in general if you are in a chase?
---
Yes I agree with this
---
I'd go against nurse, she's just breathtaking
---
Too pretty to die is how old DS should have been and I like it (strong with counterplay). Foresight looks useless, I rely on the red stain when I use Dead Hard and that perk would hinder me
---
Nurse, so i can die already
---
"Are they a useless and annoying fat bitch?"
---
*Puts down Jane*
---
FTFY
---
Oh well uhh... that's also a way you could see it...
---
What a racist killer.
---
Friend and I picked it up over the weekend as it's on Game Pass, escaped down the hatch for the first time last night which was cool
---
I'll try again soon, then! Thank you.
---
If I do that it takes me out the frenzy just change that literally all I want also NOED rewards for playing bad old MoM rewards for playing bad old DS rewards you for playing bad rancor punished for a outdated perk
---
You're breathtaking mind-keeper!!
---
Y'all are really underestimating how much damage a knife can do.
---
Even a single stab can put you into shock. At that point, game over. Oh, and if they hit an artery, you're double fucked.
---
Aye, a lot of the more badass survivors would easily deck Legion in a fistfight, but a knife is a pretty strong equaliser.
---
The Stranger Things chapter.
---
perfect response lol
---
At first I thought he had to pee but now I see the Marilyn Monroe
---
I play red ranks every month and killers tunneling is still a huge problem up there.  I have to run decisive every game on PS4 to punish all the babykillers who tunnel their way to red ranks.
---
Well, there isn't a problem so I'm not really looking for a solution. I'm just giving you a small level of counterplay to even her out a bit. Survivor is still the power role, you just have to play her a bit differently to maintain that level of power. 
---
Of course you'll eventually get injured, but as long as your teammates are doing what they're supposed to be doing it doesn't matter. It's not a 1v1 game.
---
Take my upvote
---
bryccllns95 on ps4, my bf and I play fairly regularly on either side so we aren't amazing but we definitely try to make sure our teammates stay alive if we cant
---
Yeah because getting stunned for 5 seconds against a swf with no ruin doesn‚Äôt cost you your game. You clearly don‚Äôt know how powerful it is.
---
Doubt
---
I send only positive messages to people.  I've seen some great plays, and have been saved by some players far greater than I. However...  I don't know if they're receiving the messages because I've blocked non-friend PMs on PSN.  ü§î
---
Big brain comment
---
Point out when I said there was no problem with any killer because I don't remember doing that at all.
---
save money for stranger things dlc
---
a one time conditional heal at the beggining of the match and like a two minute heal at the end trying to find a totem (protip: theres none left)
---
the perk is garbage for real play. just memey on the same level as pharmacy
---
Flat out if you're a survivor who complains about ruin you're an infant and haven't learned how to play survivor yet.  Skill checks aren't hard at all.  If you can't hit them yet practice them instead of casting salt at killers over Ruin.  You don't belong anywhere near red ranks until you can work through Ruin.
---
Wow, he must've had quite a bad day
---
noed, m.m. and infinite tier 3. alright.
---
Explain the purpose of the build? I'm dumb
---
R u single
---
A good perk is nurse‚Äôs calling
---
Why would you run No Mither Empathy instead of just Bond? Because it's a bigger radius?
---
BBQ is in the shrine. Grind as much as you can until Tuesday to get it
---
The Pig she's a tiny woman with a wrist blade there is a reason no one uses a wrist blade irl it doesn't work very well I like my odds
---
i'm envisioning an Inner Strength, Head On, Decisive Strike, Quick And Quiet build. inb4 Puppers runs it. :P although he'll probably switch DS for Balanced Landing knowing him.
---
Nah
---
Just so you know, the police are on the way. You ~~monster~~ killer.
---
bt for when someone gets hooked. No Mither for when you sabo all the hooks and you need to pick yourself up. Empathy for knowing where the others are from across the map. Sabo to sabo all the hooks
---
What about a second account? Im new to the game
---
Thank you! I have that one equipped currently
---
That's a really great feature. I remember wanting that back in the early days of the game and now, with the insane amount of Perks we have, it'd be quite useful.
---
They don't play normally, I don't play normally.
---
Just seen it, I assume this is rare to find. Thank you man
---
Saboteur is useless with the changes to toolbox sabo consumption.  Just throw on a great toolbox with charge and sabo addons and you're good to go to sabo about as much as you need.
---
it was a myers
---
:(
---
Also in the store there is the shrine of secrets, if u have enough shards I recommend u get barbecue and chili
---
Awesome, I only have 940 at the moment so I hope this is achievable
---
Ooooh we've got ourselfs a badass over here. But I most certaintly agree, if you boop that snoot hard enough she will probably die instantly. That's how that works right?
---
I mean, pre nerf ds was strong but it's not even in the game anymore so why complain about it? Not sure how I feel about noed to be honest. I think it's fine on weaker killers but I can understand the frustration from having the killer never catch you and then the nurse/spirit ends up having noed. But I think complaining about dead hard is weird since they can only use it once in each chase, and if you're a nurse, chases shouldn't be long anyways if you're experienced
---
If u grind u could get to 2000 before it goes out of the shrine
---
U need 2000, if u can get that before Tuesday u could get the perk
---
I just got banned on Xbox live for shit like this lol. They reported me
---
It's obvious the second shelf is Bill's
---
Why do I feel  this guy acts like an anime character in person? great reply though hahaha
---
Why do you need validation from others? Just do what you want...
---
Use perks that fit the killer. 
---
*equips Insidious*
---
I mean have you seen those street fight videos where a small chick slaps a huge guy he snaps and in an instant she's on the floor any sufficiently sized guy could do that to the Pig the only advantage she has is the wrist blade but a wrist blade sucks compared to a normal knife you ever tried using an implement attached to your wrist it's not very convenient.
---
Pretty sure he can easily beat pig as well
---
DS is annoying, sure. But if getting DA‚Äôd cost you the match, that means you already made a metric function of mistakes beforehand
---
New player question, but why is Legion considered so bad? From what my friends have said, they‚Äôre still pretty viable.
---
Of course there will be studies out there that say going vegan is good. There‚Äôs also far more that say it‚Äôs bad. And there‚Äôs a ton of famous vegans that have gone back to eating meat because they say it was making them too weak, and they feel much better after going back to meat. One day you‚Äôll see that you were an idiot.
---
Those pops look lit.
---
No they don‚Äôt. And if they do, they‚Äôre not worth a damn.
---
Issue is, idk how would you fix the reloading thing
---
Let‚Äôs hope so :D
---
I have altered the deal, pray I don't alter it further.
---
He sounds like the kid playing minecraft in his room
---
No thanks
---
I can hear this picture
---
Humm
---
If it was an actual trial, with the killers having their powers for real instead for game balance
---
We all would be fucked with almost all of them
---
Experienced psychos enhanced by a entity that surround us vs normal human beings
---
You had to know how to heal some wounds by yourself, how to repair the gens, have stamina to run a lot, etc.
---
Btw, terror radius wouldnt be a thing
---
-
---
If that was the case, probably trapper. Or myers/ghost face maybe
---
The one with a less powerfull hability IRL hat we could avoid with ease if we have attention being trapper, and myers/ghost face is just a guy with a knife that knows how to stalk
---
You could say legion, since its easier to fight them... But lets not forget the entity would have enhanced them, and its not balanced for games, so having a teenager, that can hit you faster than the others and chase you however they want, while you are already with deep wounds, would just drain yourself until you die in a chase
---
Huntress:  can shot you from afar with her hatchets
---
Clown:   toxic gas that'll make hard to breath, making it harder to escape him
---
Billy and bubba:   chainsaws, need more?
---
Freddy:  demon that will play with you thinking you have any salvation, but its just a illusion. And waking up will not help you
---
Plague:   illnes that'll make you vomit your organs
---
Wraith:   probably could hit you while invisible if he was real, so you would have to survive something that you cant see
---
Doctor:    shock teraphy. What is the charge you'd get from his skill? If it affects your brain to the point you see illusions, a good charge that will probably kill you if repeatedly applied
---
Hag:    she can teleport to wherever you are if gou trigger her traps, and she would have no limit on how many she can place since its not a fisical trap
---
Pig:    another stalker, but with head traps that youd have to sacrifice your arms to complete a puzzle you cant see, to have a CHANCE of getting the right key to remove the trap, that prevents you from escaping and surviving another day
---
Demogorgon:   a being from another dimension that will make you crap your pants by just being infront of you, and having any wound would just make it harder for you
---
Lets not forget, perks are just a game mechanic, so having X perk wouldnt help actually help you in a IRL scenario. 
---
Unless the entity give survivor powers that are the perks, and i just forgot because its been ages since i read anything about the lore.
---
A trial in real life, no one would actually survive, would try my luck with either trapper, myers and ghostface
---
But if it was a trial, with the game rules and mechanics, Wraith
---
damn that was painful to watch
---
When this happened to me I just restarted the game &amp; that fixed it
---
Tell the developers that. That's why adept killer is so much harder than Adept Survivor. 9 hooks minimum for merciless killer
---
Killers like Huntress who have garbage perks and need ruin to slow the game down are hopeless against good survivors. Same with Killers like Freddy or Trapper who are M1 killers. 9 hooks is a bit ridiculous. You get punished if you kill them to quickly as well. You can get 9 hooks but if they die in under 7 minutes you still lose rank progress because the match was unfun for the survivors.
---
Meanwhile Adept Survivor you could do nothing for your team at all and just Escape at the end with next to no points and get the achievement.
---
Considering that's the last survivor left, not sure how it's camping butttt this is how I imagine survivors that Tea-Bag every chance they get
---
That‚Äôs all leather face mains lol. Always wondered what was going on on their side when chainsawing camping their first hook.
---
Are you afraid of a real man, are you afraid of Fat Rambo?
---
This would make sense, because if you put it in perspective it isn't like you would give a survivor points for running in a bear trap during a chase. I've been wondering why it doesn't count as "disarming"
---
Incorrect.
---
Oh sure! More doodles for the sub
---
Another super toxic thing they should patch is the way adren works when you're being carried. If the gates are powered while you're being carried, the killer could drop you, causing the stalled heal to trigger. However the killer isn't stunned or delayed at all and can guarantee the hit on you, denying your adren heal after an unhook. Super niche situation but toxic AF.
---
It‚Äôs not always bad, I‚Äôve met some really amazing people who synergized really well with me. Sadly that chance is lower than unhooking yourself first try
---
But he is Fat Rambo.
---
I got this exact message from a rank 7 Ash:
---
"How are you so bad but you play so good? Because you're spirit"
---
ü§î
---
D:
---
I recommend spine chill with urban evasion for lower ranks, let‚Äôs you know they are coming before the terror radius and with urban evasion you can sneak away, it‚Äôs how I survived low ranks
---
They're called pallets :V
---
None of the numbers you said are that big of a deal. How often is a single person going to get 5 uses out of this perk? If someone else is cleansing totems whether they have the perk or not, they are making your Inner Strength less useful, not to mention if someone is actively looking for a totem to get the perk off, they are more likely wasting just as much, if not more time to heal themselves this way if they spend the aforementioned more than 12 seconds even looking for a totem.
---
My guess is that the perk is meant to be used passively, as in you happen to break a totem you come across and now have a really fast self heal banked for later, if you're trying to hunt for the totem just to use Inner Strength and can't find 1 quickly you're becoming just as bad as that Blendette who Urban's into the corner of the map to self-care against Sloppy butcher.
---
A perk being game-changing, i.e. meaning it will actually not be shit or only best in a meme build is a good thing in my opinion. It encourages diverse gameplay, rewards the user in some way for good plays with it and doesn't outright mean the other side loses just because you ran it.
---
We‚Äôll just have to agree to disagree, since I have a problem with a killer having no counterplay other than ‚Äújust don‚Äôt get hit‚Äù. That‚Äôs not really counterplay, just wishful thinking
---
What do you mean?
---
of course he‚Äôs a leatherface
---
Were you against a doctor as well?
---
You don't repost your posts. You get called out for shitty karma farming like that.
---
Used to increase sabotage efficiency.  Now that's base.
---
Still worth running in the build in case of Franklin's.
---
Hey! I really appreciate this detailed and thought out reply.
---
Luckily my wraith is at level 23 so I hope to see Shadowborne there soon. That sounds like a really nice perk to be honest.
---
I have nurses calling, and as you mentioned bbq is in the shrine so I need another 1000 shards.. fingers crossed lol
---
A lot of the perks you say to stay away from are from killers that I don‚Äôt have, so that should make life easier :)
---
That‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve heard of that add on but it sounds great, I guess it‚Äôs probably hard to come by.
---
I appreciate the name drops on streamers, I watch twitch a fair bit and that should give me an upper hand for sure!
---
And lastly, I‚Äôm level 5 on survivor at the minute lol. Wasn‚Äôt my strong point so I stuck to killers.
---
Again, thank you so much for your time. You are very helpful :)
---
If you spot another survivor just as you've hooked someone, go for that person. As a killer you have the upper-hand and can easily down a person that's trying to unhook, rather than waiting for him to unhook to down the person that was just on hook. That's such a cheap kill imo I don't know how anyone playing would feel good about that. But like I said this is a result of poor game design, it should not be allowed for survivors to farm or for killers to take advantage of it.
---
As a person who runs a chest looting build and is an item hoarder, I've been caught doing this a few times. The worst is the bout three times when I was downed and hooked and then facecamped. Like... whatcha hope to achieve there, buddy? Y'caught me looking for a shiny in the basement. Now we get to sit here and stare awkwardly at each other while bout three gens get done, if not more.
---
Wow... I didn't expect anyone to go this in depth. I can agree with almost everthing you say, I would like to hear your opinion about facing the Nurse though since I didn't see you say anything about that crazy lady.
---
What happens when you go to the shrine page?
---
Not trying to be that guy but imma be that guy. The game is not a killer sided map. It's only upside is the small map but most the pallets are safe, has stupid balanced landing spots everywhere and it's just not fun to navigate.
---
why not?
---
Parks and Rec reference?
---
SWF has no real counterplay either though tbf. That's the only reason Spirit is so prominent these days I feel
---
i got him. you should get nancy and steve too!
---
Entity can supply him a trap, just like it supplies The Pig with RBT's.
---
Any more?
---
  
---
They were never related
---
IIRC one of his rule is to tunnel people who use DS, so that pretty much says it all.
---
I mean, Nancy was badass from Season 1. Steve didn‚Äôt grow until the last episode of Season 2.
---
If anything he should go, and not Nancy.
---
I thought about that too! Some woodlands with the signature cabin in the middle with tons of secrets and little nods to the series would‚Äôve been amazing
---
cause Ash isnt a full chapter
---
imo his strongest points are his tracking, Preasure and his Red add ons
---
mfw they aren't even Adam
---
That's unfortunate, the killer Shack makes the most sense with his Character
---
Pretty to die would have to be based on wiggle meter. Because going down at a pallet would essentially give you a free stun on the killer. So if it were say based on the amount of wiggle progression. 
---
70/50/30% of your wiggle bar would allow it to pop. 
---
If you dont add that then you can just go down next to a pallet and vacuum the killer into a free stun over and over wasting even more time than just a normal pallet stun
---
Even though it‚Äôs unhealthy, I just hint the totem down and get a ton of totem BP and kill NoEd
---
I'm glad you liked it 
---
Tbh, i tought this would just be lost in the coments
---
And yeah, since the killers are just themselves, ranks wouldnt mean nothing
---
The legion but Susie specifically since she seems to be the most chill lore wise and would hopefully try and help since she never wanted to kill in the first place.
---
Hopefully one day
---
I love you Jason
---
Is Spirit good? Like, her power just seems so useless. Charge time where you have to stay still and can't see Survivors while in it. Am I just missing something?
---
His character makes the most sense with the killer shack and basement, I would've really love to see some more content along with his character
---
It's not one time, it can be any time during the match and stored until you're injured, and dull totems are almost never that hard to find. Check the feedback from any prominent streamer and they'll think otherwise.
---
Yee
---
My idea for this would be. Sabo, Boil Over, flip flop, and Tenacity/unbreakable. I call it the slippery meat build
---
Legion and Myers
---
Type of Bug: in-game
---
Description: Bamboozle sometimes does not prevent a survivor from vaulting the window that's supposed to be blocked-off by Bamboozle. I noticed this when I vaulted windows in Feral Frenzy as Legion with Bamboozle, and survivors would vault through the same window that I did. This issue could therefore be exclusive to Feral Frenzy-vaults, or have something to do with how little time there was between me vaulting the window and them after me.
---
I suspect that Bamboozle takes some time to block the window, but since Legion vaults windows a lot faster than other killers, this gives survivors a time window to vault back before Bamboozle is fully up.
---
As a killer main I disagree, I routinely stomp SWF. every once in a while I go against a group where they‚Äôre simply better than me, I can accept that since it‚Äôs a matter of skill rather than broken mechanics. Spirit isn‚Äôt good because her power makes her stronger, merely because it gives survivors no information to go off of. It becomes a guessing game, and if you guess wrong you get smacked. People also seem to forget that even if the survivor guesses correctly they still have no information to go off of so they‚Äôre likely going to get smacked in a matter of seconds anyway.
---
Pretty much because Empathy is always active if your whole team runs No Mither and the range is like 4 times larger than Bond.
---
Well first off, you don't have to wait until you're injured, so that situation would never happen, and second, smart teammates will let their team heal them and use the perk for later. The last scenario you mention is what makes it so good.
---
Cus nobody plays fuckin killer. Most main survivor and only play that because it's both easier and more fun.
---
Ghostface because every other killer is really super natural but ghost face just stalks and one shots.
---
Lol I played on a drawing tablet and tbh I'm amazed it worked
---
I don't blame y'all, if something like that happened I'd lose my shit.
---
*Big L for those SWF*
---
She can see scratch marks and hear injured survivors for tracking and gets a major speed boost while invis. She‚Äôs currently the second best killer in the game, albeit takes some practice to learn properly.
---
Oh wow that's a smart way to cheat your way through the trail :P love the idea.
---
Myers did nothing wrong
---
Doubtful. Too many killers love forcing survivors to do the crawl, mainly to be douches.
---
Thank god though. That plot line was trash.
---
Dude, it‚Äôs OK to not have a brain. It‚Äôs not OK to flaunt it on Reddit.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here to find out...
---
I... I don't know how to react to this
---
So its confirmed to have charges? Or ur just guessing? And you need to be injured... to be healed... and letting ur team heal you means it's a wasted perk slot.
---
Ash wasn‚Äôt this planned-out thing. The devs were working on the Pig‚Äôs cosmetics with Lionsgate, and since Lionsgate own Starz, BHVR basically just went ‚Äòwhile we‚Äôre at it, can we, like, do shit with Ash?‚Äô. Hence why he just came out by himself.
---
Now, an Ash map woulda been cool. An obvious choice is the Cabin, sure, but Pablo‚Äôs Uncle‚Äôs farm from Season One coulda been really cool to see as well. Maybe there‚Äôs a gen in Ash‚Äôs trailer van that you can get into and work one, maybe once the gates are powered all the voodoo totems on spikes light up. I dunno, cool shit like that.
---
Honestly, hooking someone and going insidious to use them as bait so I can use Leatherface‚Äôs special to try to down both is thrilling. The wait is super exciting. I‚Äôm not giving that up. It‚Äôs fun.
---
She is clearly better than all other killers except for nurse except billy. Because of these 3 killers, the devs balanced the gen repair speed around these 3. So when you play a different killer of a lower tier against a SWF red rank team, you don't really stand a chance unless your ruin is very well hidden.
---
1 survivor running Kindred and the other 3 being smart and efficient? God, I wish.
---
Your time will come where you come up against a rank 8+ player playing with low rank friends so you play up against them
---
nah, spirit is supposed to be the second best in the game, great patrolling, and with good ears (wear a headset) you can find people and mind game em. She's super strong
---
Why is he so strongly associated with the basement? I‚Äôm new to the game.

It‚Äôs all about preference. If you‚Äôre a good killer he‚Äôs easier to use. If m1 is your style he‚Äôs right on point for you. You don‚Äôt have the kind of map pressure the nurse will get but legion is pretty simple mechanic wise and straight forward.
---
Ok my reason for hating spirit has to be because she(in my opinion) is just unfair to go against as it's a guessing game of if she's in her phase or standing still. if you don't have spine chill, I can't count how many times I've gotten downed by a spirit just because she stood still forcing me to either run away from that area because I don't wanna risk a hit or her standing still and me vaulting a pallet getting downed, it literally isn't mindgames also it's just standing still it's just guessing not who outwits each other or who runs spine chill. It aggravates me seeing spirits say that spirits mindgames are hard to do when you literally can just sit still see what they do, if they run away phase and hit them, if they vault over that pallet hit them and boom got a hook.
---
You access the shrine from the store page, not the match prep page.
---
Yeah but why you always have to burn perk slots just because you play solo? swf players doesn't need self-care, kindred, bond, etc.  
---
They should reduce the gap between solo and sfw players, make kindred baseline for solo players for example.
---
Maybe will since doing a totem will make you store a free heal
---
But we have yet to see before assuming it anyway
---
I'm fine with no collision, as long as it also extends to windows and pallets.
---
Gosh I wil you were joking. Thank you very much
---
That is such a beautiful idea that I actually teared up lmao
---
so why putting rank in the game if we're not going to stick with it. It's like in cs:go : if you friend is way higher rank than you, you can't play comp together..
---
Aren't all spirit players weebs though regardless of outfit?
---
Many people feel that Spirit can‚Äôt be countered effectively. Because spirit‚Äôs whole power is to remove any information the survivor could use while only removing some of the information she could use it becomes a guessing game. I‚Äôll give an example from both sides, survivor: you drop a pallet and she freezes on the other side of it. You can slow vault the pallet and hope she‚Äôs phasing, but if she‚Äôs faking it then you just got grabbed. You can run away, but then you have to hope you make it to another pallet and just repeat the process. You can walk away but if she‚Äôs only pretending to phase then she‚Äôll just wait until she knows for sure where you are, or she‚Äôll follow breathing/grass movements. If you stay at the pallet then she‚Äôll just phase around it and hit you. Killer: a survivor drops a pallet. You just stand there until you know exactly what they‚Äôre doing, phase, guaranteed hit unless you mess up or they get really lucky. Spirit is viewed as a very unfun killer because she removes anything a survivor can use to outsmart her.
---
Once again, this is someone being a shitty team mate and is in no way the killers fault, if they don't want to take one for the team to basically guarantee a win they suck at survivor.
---
and let's be honest they were just toxic
---
You can pocket one totem worth of healing at a time, that's confirmed. The perk activates when you cleanse a totem and the heal takes place only if you hide in a locker for 8 seconds while injured, and then the perk deactivates. The perk description is perfectly clear about that, you can check u/Otzdarva's post for a screenshot of the effect.
---
Letting your team heal you is only a waste of a perk slot if you don't get hit again for the rest of the game. You're not going to be in a position to be healed by teammates every time you're injured if you're playing well and wasting the killer's time, so in most games, getting healed by teammates when effective and then using your locker heal when it's important can be a very smart play.
---
That's all it does now is extend broken hooks by 30 seconds.  You no longer need it to sabo efficiently because of the changes to how sabo charges are consumed base.  Commodious with Wire Spool and sabo addon and you're good to go.  If this build is all about 99%'ing hooks for sabo saves I would replace Saboteur with Resilience and Borrowed with Breakdown.
---
What's the counterplay to SWF? I'm winning more than I lose to them but that's mainly due to their altruism but when they are communicating properly, unless you can outplay individuals, you're kinda screwed. Especially with hatch.
---
Its possible theyr doing a joke, since theres people on the comunity who actually think its toxic
---
Oh hell no that would make spirit even more of a problem
---
Like I said, never going to happen largely because there's a loud minority of people like YOU that insist everything is fine. Meanwhile, you cry and cry and cry about Nurse, NOED, Mori's and etc.
---
I do but it's more like 2+ toolboxes = ivory
---
Say your dad‚Äôs getting arrested whilst you‚Äôre playing. You want to see what‚Äôs going on, right? You want to know what he‚Äôs done. So then the magical ‚Äòleave match‚Äô button comes into play. However, if you keep on doing this- even if your dad keeps on being arrested- you look like a little bitch who‚Äôs ruining the game for other people. So then the penalties roll in. 
---
Kind of the abridged version.
---
I laughed so hard
---
I appreciate you lending your perspective but this doesn‚Äôt relate very strongly to spirit herself. This is more about gen speeds and Swf. I would love to read a comment that is more specifically about spirit though
---
Oh my fuck hes so cute
---
I agree with you so I don‚Äôt really have anything to add to this discussion. I‚Äôm hoping some spirit players join the discussion soon so we can get their opinions too
---
Fake. No teammates play like that. They would blindly rush in to farm a 1000 points even though they can very clearly see a basement bubba....
---
They are simple but it's enough but watchin someone pulling down pallets, quick vaulting when killers not around, not recovering or wiggling and the like
---
Please tell me this is a joke.
---
Depends if it‚Äôs 2 Alex‚Äôs toolboxes or 2 other kinds. If a team is running 2 Alex‚Äôs toolboxes then gens are gonna go so fast 1 gen will be the speed of 1 slow mori lol
---
You can probably make it yourself fairly easily tbf. Just buy a copy of Who The Fuck? or whatever it's called and print out little pictures to glue over the existing characters.
---
Hes laughing at the dc's cuz they're absolute fucking jokes
---
Lmaoo I love when survs bust out their impromptu players handbook to explain to me all their "rules" I broke.
---
I agree, Adrenaline is fine as it is. This change I'm suggesting is barely even a nerf, by the time the killer gets to the area you screamed in, you'll be long gone with the haste, and if the killer is already chasing you the noise notification won't matter at all.
---
I always thought this change would've been comical, especially since the change to Calm Spirit, I didn't think of it as a huge nerf to the perk
---
Originally Deep Wounds status effect would only stop if you were in a chase. The killer turning around and following blood pools instead of you, would cause you to fall to the ground. If you stopped to mend, they catch you. If you wait at a pallet, the instant you stop mending, because you're not in a chase, you fall to the ground.
---
Legion could smack you, leave his power, and moonwalk to victory.
---
Otherwise he could hit you with his power, and hitting you again would drain your mend timer by a little. Without add-ons, it took 4 hits to down someone with his power, which could be used a lot more often, and didn't automatically turn off if he missed. With Add-ons it was 3 hits, which is a lot stronger than it sounds because of the vaulting pallets and Windows thing where you really can't escape him, and 3 hits is just 2 uses of his power (1 hit to put them in deep wounds state which recharges the power instantly, another which will drain their timer and put you out if your power, then go into your power again and smack them 1 more time for them to go down).
---
Then there were 2 broken add-ons that would stack infinitely. When he hit you, it Would increase the amount of time it takes for you to mend, and it would add more time every time he hit you. So he could run around, hit everyone, and not hook anyone until everyone had to mend for 5+ minutes just to leave deep wounds state.
---
Now if he swings at you and misses, he loses his power. They increased his base movement speed. Legion is still easy to play, but he's not nearly as bad as he was. He can get the first hit easily, but he has to leave his power and chase you to actually down you.
---
HAL from 2001. Idk how it would work
---
Alex toolboxes are saving boxes lmao, you should be talking about the other purple toolboxes
---
How else do you suppose he gets a 4% movement speed increase to get those annoying survivors? Play with your food? Ha!
---
For that juicy 4%
---
This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúwhy do people complain‚Äù post, though I appreciate your input
---
I play both sides equally.  Survivors had two perks every bit as broken as NOED in Decisive and MoM and both were reworked to become completely fair (one from being balanced and the other from being nerfed out of the game).   There isn't a single survivor perk at this point in need of nerfing.  Survivors lost damn near every broken mechanic they had over the past year of updates when the devs finally started listening to killers.  I would tell you to simply develop your killer game if you still feel outclassed at this point by survivors.  That's a personal problem not a balance problem.
---
Plus they just came out with the game on the Switch.
---
Um is this r/dbdgonewild material or nah
---
Exactly. I want people that specifically play that killer to give their counter arguments or opinions so we can discuss it then just agree
---
The Claudette should be playing Jane.
---
I imagine Dwight would be like the baby in the latest Halloween...
---
Myers stares at it. The audience holds their breath. Myers moves on and we all breathe again. Baby Dweet is safe.
---
I think I am I can‚Äôt remember which is which because I don‚Äôt have a lot of items (except on my item hoarder jake lol)
---
You mean "STEVE" ?
---
You might as well ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the counterplay to survivors?‚Äù Since it‚Äôs the same thing. Just pay attention and learn their weaknesses. You don‚Äôt need to play much differently against solo vs Swf, it‚Äôs just as easy to be crushed by good solo players as it is to be crushed by good Swf.
---
Survivors use strong perk builds and OP items like Instaheals and Keys yet when a killer uses a good add-on, its a whole issue üòÇ
---
There‚Äôs no such a things as PC rules, console rules or rules at all. Just play the game the way you want.
---
His power is not much more than a free first hit which is pretty bad compared with an ability that can down.
---
&gt;  would tell you to simply develop your killer game if you still feel outclassed at this point by survivors. That's a personal problem not a balance problem.
---
See, this is the problem. You people live in an echo chamber and cannot and will not listen to logic. You can't "outplay" people using mics and meta-perks in conjuction. There's no "outplaying" instant heal except, maybe, if you're running Billy and can shut down a guy running over and instant healing a downed survivor. 
---
So, you think the killer can "outplay" if someone has Balanced Landing on Haddonfield? You honestly believe that. 
---
You're just feeding into the problem.
---
I smell some salt
---
It definitely should. It should also deactivate whenever the Survivor interacts with something or becomes healthy.
---
Yeah having good headphones is such an impressive skill.
---
Killer Name: Space Marine
---
Killer Power: a fucking bolter
---
Oh God that would be terrifying. I want it
---
Eh, up to you. I find that I tend to get beaten by non Swf more often since they aren‚Äôt as predictable. Against a Swf you can pretty much know where 2-3 are at any given time and that leads to some serious snowballing, the only time Swf beats me is when the individual players are all good enough that I‚Äôd likely have lost even if they weren‚Äôt in comms.
---
I dont see a problem with any of those perks
---
You move really quickly in her power. Using headphones makes it easy to find survivors (unless they have iron will, but even then strong spirit players can hear the footsteps/breathing of survivors). 
---
The power is also really strong at most downed pallets. It turns the loop into a guessing game that's heavily in your favor. Just stand at the downed pallet, you can phase to them going left or right, where the survivor can slow vault to escape you. You can counter the slow vault strategy by fake using your power and standing still, which baits a slow vault, you then give a hit.
---
I had a daily that would give 90K blood points for trying to hit survivors right after you blink as Nurse. I play on console so this was infuriating and after getting messaged by toxic survivors I just gave up and deleted the daily. What was my next daily? Mori a survivor as nurse. I sighed loudly and quit the game.
---
There's an old saying: if you mess with the bull you will get horns. 
---
I can't feel bad for ya if you instigate the killer in the first place.
---
&gt;many times has chat been abused when compared to being used to complement the killer on a game well played?
---
For the games that I've played, I would estimate less than 10% is abuse (or an attempt to).  Probably less, but I don't have hard numbers.  And that includes abuse from killer and survivor both.  As I said, if I start the conversation and I'm obviously not a dick or clearly had a fun match and want to thank people for it, other people generally follow suit.
---
It just feels kinda lame when part of her "mind game" is standing still at a loop. Then you have her passive phasing that by random luck can mess you up while looping to give her an easy hit and it leads me to think that maybe shes a little too strong for how easy she is to pick up and use. 
---
To be a good billy or nurse takes time and a decent amount of grinding through games where you get beat by a good group of survivors. With spirit I don't feel like that same level of commitment is needed to start beating up on good survivors.
---
I don't think she needs to be nerfed because its not like shes unbeatable (though I wouldn't complain if prayer beads wasn't a thing anymore), but I just don't have the same level of respect when a spirit steam rolls a game vs a billy or nurse doing it.
---
She is really enjoyable to play as though lol.
---
That moment when survivors can wear headphones
---
Or when their skillset is literally running in tight circles or...holding a button down
---
Such skill. Such mastery. Such grace.
---
I'm a Nea main and don't t-bag except to say thank you to survivors... do I get a cookie?
---
Its just animated badly.
---
So I‚Äôm tunneling if I down the rescuer, find the unhooked Survivor nearby because they suck at hiding, down them, and then go back to the rescuer and hook them? It can‚Äôt be me outplaying you guys, right? 
---
This might be too much for you to handle, but DS isn‚Äôt supposed to be a get out of jail free card.
---
Learn how to loop. Make a note of all windows and pallets and make a beeline to a pallet or window any time you see the killer. Always heal at a pallet. Plenty of YouTube videos on how to not get hooked.
---
Yeah, I can agree with that. It really does seem like she just doesn‚Äôt provide enough information. Hoping some people start defending spirit soon though, I‚Äôd like to hear the other side of this too
---
I mean they're perks to help survivors against proxy campers and tunnelers, which they're powerless to stop (without those perks) if the killer chooses to go down that path...
---
I love the perk for punishing face campers. When everybody can see the camping they just get the generators done. I hold as long as I can and its an easy win for the team (I don't mind dieing for a good cause!)
---
Bubba's power, for most intents and purposes, is just a weaker version of Billy's. The only place it shines is dealing with multiple survivors in a tight area, which throwing bodies at a hook is one of the few ways to effectively deal with a camping killer. Long story short, it basically means that Bubba is at his best when camping, and there's no better place to camp than the basement.
---
I can't wait
---
he looks like such a happy trappy  
---
keep us updated pliz
---
Not a fan of the first or third ones. The second one is ok but I kinda prefer what we already have.
---
I personally love that second one, it stays true to the character, and sounds fun to play with. However, I don't really have an opinion on the third, and I really don't see the first one working at all, since the devs themselves said they're not planning on doing anything like that soon.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture.
---
My group had the pleasure of playing against/with (can't recall which) HEX: Devour Ass in Overwatch.
---
With a good pair of headphones, she becomes almost nurse tier, IMO. You can't see the survivors, but you don't really need to, once you get the hang of tracking them based off of scratch marks and sound. She's faster when using her power too, so she also has good mobility. That, and most survivors below red ranks don't know how to counter her.
---
The funny thing is, I said this EXACT comment would show up somewhere else.
---
Killers would bitch that survivors are too strong because they can't be hit through windows. Well get ready for it. Hopefully dedicated servers stops hitbox lag completely.
---
This is from the webtoon safely endangered
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cvgccy/the_truth_revealed_documentary_exposing_what_is/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I mean I would defend her if we're talking about nerfing her. The only kind of nerf I would be ok with her getting is one that lets her be just as strong as she is now, but makes it so she requires a bit more skill to play as. 
---
I have no idea what that nerf would be, but I definitely don't want to see her turned into a mid tier type of killer.
---
I could feel the mini heart attack you had.
---
I'm thinking it was Predaxx
---
Or I could easily be a Huntress who thinks it is a waste of 1 of the 2. The belt is a given and so are the survivors throwing pallets. We are very much on the same page.
