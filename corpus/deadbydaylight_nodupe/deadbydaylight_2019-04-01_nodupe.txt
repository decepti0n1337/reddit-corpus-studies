Honestly Coulrophobia is really bad.  Any survivor with a brain is not going to heal in your TR.  And if they are potato enough to do it, then you probably don't need Coulrophobia.

My favorite survivors are the one's when we have 1 gen left and it's 50% done and are furiously teabagging me to heal them.  The gen pops and they have adrenaline.  Extra IQ points in this scenario if it's against a legion.
---
As a fellow artist, I'm just glad to see when SOME PEOPLE credit it, though I've found the credit for some people....

My issue with ruin is that I hate going against it 10 games in a row. I want something different.
---
It's absolute trash... I average at least 19K - 20K per round, been stuck on Rank 8 for a good 5 hours.... 5 fucking hours... besides the fact that when the killer D/C's you lose a pip, it's been unbearable trying to rank up in this new ranking system.
---
Ash Williams or no, if this shit doesn't get fixed I'm not buying that DLC... what's the fucking point of even having a rank system in your game if you literally make it impossible to play the game the way you want to?
---
The way I see it is, you're forced to basically get 5K in each category now in order to get even a single pip... which is insane considering it would mean you have to survive every single round among doing really risky shit and sitting on at least two full gens... between 4 people... yeah not happening.
---
These guys are fucked in the face if they think this is a good counter to the abysmally easy ranking system we had before.
---
Is it too much to ask that 20K = 1 pip and surviving = the other pip... That way if you don't meet the criteria of one category at least you get a mercy pip for surviving the fucking round, bare minimum.
---
At least this way someone could go all out, have their fun, do all the risky things like rescuing / healing / body blocking and even if they die they can still get a single pip...
---
It's not that hard of a thing to do... 2 pips tied to score alone is fucking mental when the criteria is already too high to even get a single pip.
---
Good name üòÅ
---
It seems like a lot of work to widen all the basement stairs.  What about just removing collision from killers if they've been afk for a certain amount of time?  Not sure how much coding that would require.
---
There's an important distinction here. Were you just slugged during the match or was the killer actively trying to win through slugging, I.e downing everyone before hooking? Because the latter is shitty and the former is just part of the game.

This new pipping system has me not playing these days. I hope they revert it like they did matchmaking.

Fun fact you don't even have to hitbthe chicken great skill checks, just stop for a second when you mess up.

Also with how frequently I have to deal with ruin I just make stake out a permanent perk in anybof my builds.

Maybe the other log is for the killer since it's a different size from the others.

You have to get merciless killer and or a double pip to get the achievement. I know Monto was having trouble getting it as well.

I‚Äôm honestly surprised by all the people saying tunneling is the best option, yet they‚Äôre right. Don‚Äôt constantly camp the hooks but if you run into the injured survivor you have no reason to target anyone else, unless someone bodyblocks (Exception to this is if said injured person is on last hook). 
---
It‚Äôs up to the survivors to protect their vulnerable comrade, by bodyblocking, distracting and confusing the killer with their scratchmarks. I‚Äôve seen excellent survivor plays like this and honestly if every survivor was this clever tunneling wouldn‚Äôt be an issue except for people that camp the hook. 
---
If you‚Äôre really worried about tunneling, just run Make Your Choice to make targetting the other person an even better option (Since the unhooked needs to waste time healing) and discourages camping 
---
At the end of the day play how you want to play. Your job as a killer is to get survivors. Play smart but mercilessly and you‚Äôre doing great. Go out of your way to harm your own objective and try to ruin a survivor‚Äôs experience (Looking at you, Leatherface who stares into Claudette‚Äôs eyes with your chainsaw revved at the hook when there‚Äôs so many gens still up) and you‚Äôre being a pretty toxic A-hole 
---
No one tactic or playstyle is toxic if it‚Äôs actually the best decision to make. Except moonwalking with Legion perhaps, though the devs have said it‚Äôs fine
---
This is a long comment so if you have to take something from this, remember you‚Äôre a KILLER and kill effectively, but don‚Äôt be needlessly mean unless you have a reason to be angry
---
I run prove thyself, so the speed from that with me + 1 person on the gen outweighs ruin. Doesn't matter if you can't hit greats, just go for goods so it doesn't explode and I got the greats down. It's fine. Get the totem if you see it but it's a total waste to go looking for it.
---
I ran stake out for a while, it was awesome. It really was. My friends I play with laughed at me for it but at least I can hit my skill checks shrug.
---
This is cute and all but where are my boyos and gals Legion?
---
The game has been making me dc almost every game i play so that i wouldn't be fair 
---
Oh my God a killer without *honour*

When were killers supposed to be polite, must‚Äôve missed that in the patch notes. Bet these are the same people who teabag after they do anything they think is clever but then call foul play whenever the killer BMs

This is why I don't run end game builds. It never fails, the moment I run one everyone dies before I even get to use it.

It may have not been coordinated, but more that the killer felt sorry for his whole team leaving. I find myself letting the last one go a lot recently because everyone D/Cs the moment they lose a chase/get hooked.

Survivors can run a bit faster than him, but pallets and windows hardly affect him. Something like that.

Damn right. As a killer your job is to kill. To kill as many survivors as fast as possible. It is fun killing them, gaining points, experience, and rank. And there's nothing wrong with getting enjoyment out of it.
---
Don't ever let survivors shame you into doing what you're suppose to do. You're not their to be the 5th member of the survivor squad or to be their friend. Kill them all. I try to 4k every damn game, and I don't care who doesn't like it. It's why I hate that stupid hatch so much since it handicaps me from doing what I should always strive to do, just because the Devs want to placate the last survivor's feelings by giving them the advantage.

If you‚Äôre playing on console it‚Äôs because nurse is harder to play there than on PC, and hillbilly is really good. The popularity is a result of the tier list and core issues the game has right now. All I can offer is my condolences, the chainsaw PTSD should be gone in a few months...
---
Wasn‚Äôt expecting Nia and choked on my drink
---
We‚Äôve tried the perk as soon as it was discovered on ps4 and it‚Äôs a pretty gimmicky perk to be honest! It only work once per match! As soon as you fully heal your aura is shown to the killer at all times unless you‚Äôre close to them. That‚Äôs a pretty high price for a perk that only work once! Unless our perk was bugged and you can use it multiple times .

So many people complain about tunneling when your teammates aren‚Äôt careful with unhooks like this. It‚Äôs a little scummy to defend the hook for no reason, but if the killer is presented with a healthy or injured survivor why would he target the healthy one? Exactly why I love Make Your Choice, it rewards you for doing what you‚Äôre meant to do as a killer instead of being worried about the survivors actually saving teammates

That said, if I literally see you hiding near the hook you bet I‚Äôm going to ‚Äòwalk away‚Äô and then turn around shortly after

I feel you bud. I was playing with a friend who doesn‚Äôt play dbd much and we didn‚Äôt get camped but the killer DC‚Äôd 3 times in a row after waiting a long time to join a lobby. Now they think it‚Äôs like this all the time 
---
He probably just had really bad net. Happened to me a few times as survivor. That said, I've had killers teleport on me too, which is always a reason for concern. 
---
The most memorable time, the killer had downed me from like 10ft away, left me to chase someone else. I crawled halfway across the map, and somehow they picked me up (they were no where near me), and we were teleported to a hook directly. 
---
It happened when I got pulled off the hook. I think it was a combination of lag as it bugged out
---
Thanks for the meme template 
---
Wait, what do you mean by that? You can clearly see Clau-
---
Oh.
---
Well I don't agree entirely as I often try to hook people twice before using the Mori on them. Can't say I always do but I won't use it 'as soon as I can'. I try to get some hooks first. Personally I see it more as a chance to use a 'Fatality'. 
---
Killing someone as soon as you can with a Mori says, "I'm a shit killer desperate for an unfair advantage".
---
Nobody DC‚Äôd. They completed 4 gens and then I killed 3 of them. The last one started circling me instead of looking for the hatch of completing a gen bc he wanted to farm. So I killed him too.
---
Are you sure they knew the killer? It's incredibly hard to get into the match with someone you know like that-- trust me, I've tried. 
---
It could have just been two survivors being assholes, and the killer went with it.

---
You mean terrifying? I've never actually been downed by a killer like that on accident (a couple times on purpose though to save someone from death hook), but seeing Trapper chuggin at you with someone on his shoulder is scary as hell
---
Well, at least they did a pretty good job on that daily so far.
---
What? If survivor queue times are longer that means there are too many survivors. 
---
Yeah terrifying is probably a better word, it certainly catches them off guard

Then I'd say you're totally in the clear, yeah. What a wild man.

There are 4 survivors a game and 1 killer therefore there needs to be 4 times as many people playing survivor than killer at any point in time.

Sure, but add in the survivor suffers from the exposed affect after they're unhooked the 2nd time. 
---
I kinda like the way it is right now, I went up against some scumbag whose gamertag was Clan Master and some numbers along with a gamer pic that had a strong resemblance to white hoods. Tunneled and Mori'd within 30 seconds. It was an ebony Mori, so kind of a waste because I played right the rest of the match. Everyone else got 3 hooks.
---
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU ANYMORE!
---
I agree. 
---
Yeah, dude is floating away
---
Why was this downvoted?
---
But not too much. Otherwise you're gonna fall victim to faceplanting a wall or you're easily mindgamed. He's still an excellent chaser who feels very fast while moving and can run you down altogether too easily. 
---
I would like to understand what "tunneling" means first...
---
The video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtEVGS9Qv6Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtEVGS9Qv6Y) implies "tunneling" as "killer focus on one single survivor for the majority of the game, even if the killer can get other survivor with relative ease".
---
But based this post, these days "tunneling" means "whenever the killer focus on recently unhooked injured survivor".
---
What does "tunneling" mean, really? Is it really just something made up by the survivor, does it really have a standard? (Also, while anyone care to reply, I would like to understand if toolbox is required for gen rush - because I thought gen rushing is just get gens done really quickly.)

Found a killer match instantly, impossible to load in as survivor
---
I played survivor for a couple of hours last night and played against a good variety of killers: Legion, Billy, Plague, Doctor, Huntress and Freddy.
---
When I play as killer I rotate every five levels so that they prestige around the same time and I play each of them equally.
---
I know that isn't how most people play, but I would get bored playing as the same killer for too long and I dont consider someone a good killer just because they can get kills with one or two characters/builds.
---
Well you can rest assured they're all flocking around me, lol. It's really bad. 
---
This has happened to me so many times it‚Äôs not even funny, damn trees out to get me. But you‚Äôre right a trapper who comes prepared gets the power to end a chase without hitting you, which is powerful and adds a new playstyle/aspect to the game when you play as or against him
---
More like lerys
---
"BITCH"
---
Maybe for a good reason?
---
You mean basically every match?
---
Awww. I love cats, I have 3. I‚Äôm sorry you lost yours. 
---
calm your tits buddy, all I'm saying is that those characters are dressed just like normal people, therefore really seeing them get cosplayed doesn't exactly bring them as much attention and likability as someone cosplaying the trapper.
---
stop taking everything to heart and being an emotional fuck, I never had any negative intentions, I was simply stating what's true.
---
He's just trying to keep David from catching a cold, ok? :^)
---
Ooh ooh we need that sfm guy to make this in sfm
---
He's the only killer that really excels on maps that a lot of other killers greatly struggle on. He's the only killer that really has maps that favor him outright rather than lean towards him. To counterweigh this He struggles heavily on maps that lack camouflage around corners or have wide open spaces where Survivors can easily break Line of Sight. As such, basically all of Coldwind Farm sucks outright--except for Rancid Abattoir--while (in my opinion) his best maps are Haddonfield, Pale Rose, and Gideon. 
---
Sadly, he's fundamentally snubbed Chaser points because his greatest assets are in cutting chases short without landing hits and hook defense. I only sometimes score above silver on Chaser anymore, even when I kick ass. 
---
[Correct](https://youtu.be/q4feCJ__GwI?t=48)
---
sure, but I suppose seeing outrageous characters is still much better. you could easily misjudge this person here for no cosplay at pax irl unless you see her by the DBD booth lol, that was my point. I never said her cosplay was shit, it was great, it's just that usually clean survivor outfits like this one from feng doesn't give the hint that she's cosplaying her as compared to a dwight with a rugged shirt and messy tie and glasses for example, because people would instantly know that this is a survivor.

Exactly why trapper is usually said to be the most balanced killer. Distinct strengths and weaknesses. Always love trapping that spot next to the drop onto the dead pig in Gideon. Many of the herding spots are so obvious yet when played right they have no choice but to go there and hope you haven‚Äôt trapped yet
---
I don‚Äôt play trapper so much so you likely know more, but he‚Äôs unarguably very satisfying to use when he works
---
Dual healing and repairing gens together.
---
WOW SURVIVORS OP
---
lol Indeed.
---
There are no killers like Legion. There's only Legion.
---
Ok that is way too powerful. Yes an Ebony Mori cuts a game in half but it doesn‚Äôt throw away pallets or windows. The only way I could see this is taking out x amount of gens in the match.
---
Oh my god I bet that's why scratchmarks have been getting worse lately, BHVR isn't just fucking things up they're trying to make predator useful
---
Go to the official forums. They're still whining about it. 
---
No, many perks work together to create a build that aides/allows a certain play style. A crutch perk like Predator just wastes a slot by simplifying a game mechanic.

Good Legions know how great his power is at slowing down the game (Much to the hate of survivors) and how it literally makes it inefficient to go for one person since it take so many feral hits to down someone
---
The genre is called stalk and slash for a reason :)
---
So try that. Stalk for a bit then move up closer, stalking as you go, if you are close enough to hit them then go for it.
---
Another tip is to get your EW 99% then just as your close enough to hit them go onto full Evil Within.
---
&amp; if a surv dies they should be able to come back as another surv, but with a gun, so long long as they complete a menial task
---
I didn't delete shit you fucktard. I don't give a fuck about a 'banhammer' lmao KILL YOUR SELF.
---
Really? I distinctly remember brown hair but only a texture. Almost like Huntress.
---
Dude this is so mild, like who cares?
---
Lmao I'd this your version of trying to tattle on me ? I care so much you fucktard
---
Doing a generator with one or more people.

Pig and Myers are OP?
---
Also happy cake day!

I also noticed how you didn't respond when I pointed out your lie.
---
You all had Medkits too... lol
---
Umm, hes not on console buddy, all of his perks are neutral to survivors on console. And he's free for everybody on PC, the only platform he is on
---
Yeap. That's majoritively what my games have been recently. Instead of just eating it and getting extra chase/found/injure points, killers wait it out. As a killer I prefer eating it so it's done with and going about my day. 
---
Two people healing one person, multiple people on a gen and I believe meeting up with another survivor provides a certain amount. 
---
Just saying buddy. Half the players aren't able to get him. I checked my perks and his aren't just there. Gotta grind for them. 
---
My lie? Which one is that one exactly? I would have recalled I'm just sucking up waaay too much oxygen to comprehend such a statement. Oh, woe is me.
---
Is your game bugged? Cuz I've never heard of that before
---
Wait people still play legion 
---
Oml four survivors taking turns DH‚Äôing into the killer with vigil. 
---
That wouldn‚Äôt fully work would it? We have the solo characters which ruin it sadly 
---
Lmao probably. It's already bugged to hell and back more than most players for what ever reason. None of his perk are available to me though 
---
I like their design, too bad that their gameplay turn out to be cancer though.
---
The game is very fun if you play killer with the developers vision, which is to say that you act like a spooky movie monster and kinda play with your prey, instead of just thirsting for a kill by facecamping or tunneling people to shit. Also doing funny gimmick perk/add-on builds that kinda make you play the game in different ways like body-blocker Hag
---
I don't play a lot of survivor but from what little experience I do have it'd be cool to have some more clear teamwork information (I'm a solo player) and some different, perhaps even map-specific objectives to complete.
---
no, then again i think wraith would do all three
---
This is why I really love Make Your Choice, it removes any temptation to use unfun tactics for the survivor side and rewards me for not going out of my way to be a d***. Then you get games where the wraith decides to hardcore camp despite you having a DC in the first minute, then a second, as if the game is still a contest at that point
---
I‚Äôll usually kill one person then farm with the other and let them go, but with the new emblem system it‚Äôs harder and harder to rank up with my piggy in particular so being merciful is often the difference between getting a safety pip and a pip 
---
Like I can't even get into the main game screen type of bugged. 
---
I kinda feel you spiritually. This game is impossible to enjoy as survivor now. Round after round of strong killer buffs. Every killer released since Freddy has had some sort of obnoxious mechanic (just some more than others), meanwhile nothing as been done about the toxicity on EITHER side by BHVR, they've taken away a lot of survivors defenses, etc, etc.
---
This game is something I love truly. When I bought it? I was completely in love and enamored. I've been there since virtually the beginning on console. CONSOLE (where the frame rates are atrocious and I swear the toxicity level is TWICE as bad as PC).
---
I've paid for auric cells and more and just....
---
The game is a mess right now. It's honestly the most annoying and worst state I've EVER seen it in.
---
Yea, they would have to fix all those shitty bugs first.
---
Oh shit, I had no clue lol 
---
That, my friend, is a meme. I've heard of gate lever defense Myers, where he stood there with Insidious the whole game and pulled the Survivor off once he'd gotten the lever to 90% and giving him a Mori with Rancor. 
---
Spies from the shadows OP.
---
Lmao fair enough, most people don‚Äôt seem to notice, myself included.
---
I dont get how people dont realize that a facecamper means an almost free escape for everyone else. If you know theyre hard camping, just leave and do gens
---
I got what I wanted out of you anyways. Tried having a lovely little chat with you but you didn't respond. So, here we are. Next time, don't be such a worthless douchebag.

This does bring a smile to my face

This is one of the best Legion cosplays I've ever seen. It's like Susie actually walked into PAX. Great job üëç

Well a lot of the DCs are forced by a bug. I play with 2 friends so we are a group of three and in a lot of games one of us gets DCd for no reason at all, usually after being hooked or hit. The other day we were playing with a legion and had 1 gen left, all for of us alive and out of no where my two friends and the random all dcd one after another and I was left there with legion ü§≠ (I got hatch thankfully) but I just KNOW he was like ‚Äúthey only DC because I‚Äôm legion!‚Äù When none of the DCs were intentional. At least for my two friends, I‚Äôm not sure about the random.
---
Nope, Legion with Nurse's is useless cause nobody ever heals
---
Lmao I didn't respond. You fucktard
---
It should be hard, but this is too hard, ya dig?
---
If this ever happens to me I'm gonna stand under a hook to hide from the killer
---
MoM is a powerful perk. It deserves a strong downside to balance it out, especially since there's pretty much no counterplay on the killer's side.
---
Any perks that messes up the corn, even for a second, is going to be at the top of my personal tier list. I despise the coldwind maps with a passion, so needlessly horrible for anyone but Hillbilly and Trapper 
---
One of kyles perks could be called veteran and what it does is anytime you get unhooked, the next gen you do will go 15%/20%/25% faster for 30 seconds
---
Thank you!
---
Kindred - Helps your potato teammates know when to go for the unhook and counters camping killers. Unless they go for the unhook anyway. Which they always do

I took your advice to heart and did my research.Its from dat_boi_Myers on insta. You can‚Äôt even say its from your insta because if you can put watermarks you would‚Äôve put on of your reddit name and your insta name.Its obviously from another person stop digging yourself a hole you dense bitch.

---
You already know this guy went Frank‚Äôs mixtape on them
---
Bill, Leatherface, and now Ash, also there is only 3 killers for the 4 base survivors 
---
&gt;please stop the smoking splinters BHVR, I'm ready to buy Freddy now
---
This is exactly what I'm suffering right now. I bought Cannibal and Myers because they are ok to play as and got gifted Pig because I would never buy such a boring and weak killer. Freddy is the only one left and I never intend to buy him. The amount of Ebony Moris or pink add-ons his splinter prevented is quite high. 
---
Leatherface, William overbeck, and the new survivor coming in a few days.
---
I couldnt fit it that way the gun was so small (its plastic) it wouldn't fit unless it hooked into it
---
Lmao smol huntreeesss
---
They probably haven't played Legion or really know how the power works eith that perk
---
Ooo this is sweet! I‚Äôd love this on Jeff. 
---
David also needs a King cosmetic. Just saying. 
---
Big reason why I havent played in a bit and gradually losing interest. 
---
If they also fix skeleton key, I would totally be fine with just having killers finish off survivors with a mori simply for the badass factor
---
Extremely useful video, kudos to whoever is making these.
---
I pretty much play Doc 99% of the time as Killer. If I start getting bored I‚Äôll switch over to Survivor 
---
Nah, living seems fun. Especially when your tiny little balls start scrounging up because of me. So I'll stay a little longer. Plus, I welcome death. I have no God, no faith, no afterlife to look forward to and I'm fine with dying. Are you?
---
It‚Äôs kinda a team effort tho. You should be healing your teammates. I get that he body blocked you, but you refusing to heal people simply because you don‚Äôt want to, is kind of a cunty thing to do. 
---
10 out of 10 would oink.
---
thanks
---
How do people get the camera out for the overhead views?
---
Oh definitely on doc level 
---
since 2016
---
Well that‚Äôs the thing. How can we change something without understanding it first? BHVR isn‚Äôt enforcing stricter code of conduct rules. That means the community needs to monitor itself. If we want this behavior changed, the only way is to change our ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù attitude by thinking of the opponent as another fellow player who is role playing as an adversary. Be cognitive that there is another human on the other side. Commend other players, provide constructive criticism, and most importantly, do not initiate or retaliate verbal assault. On Playstation, I report hostile players to Sony and have them banned for bad behavior.
---
&gt;yea it does, or they change it?!
---
Can't speak for consoles but on PC if you hit LEAVE GAME and restart DBD, your pips are back which means you don't lose pips for DCing.

I just tested it btw.

Fast-paced gameplay, I can somewhat kinda resist the monotony of pallet looping, and they look cool.

Try not saying shitty things if you don't want shitty things said to you.
---
Lol I haven‚Äôt tried that yet! But when I get home and am eating dinner, I camp my hex ruin totem and only smack them when they touch it, it‚Äôs hilarious on the length that some people are willing to go to get that totem. First offense is a smack, the second offense I Down you, the third I hook you, now after that if you keep coming back it‚Äôs a capital crime and the penalty is death. But I normally let them live, and normally they are the last one in the game and I will drop them at the hatch or exit gate and have had them crawling back to the totem. One guy messaged me the other day and said he wanted that totem and that I was being rude lol! 
---
Cool
---
AThe funny part is you're too fucking stupid to realize that what I said and how I said it implies it is more than just Legions.
---
But here's what happened, all you idiots can't think outside yourself can you? lol
---
I try not to be toxic if it doesn‚Äôt affect my gameplay since Legion is effectively a survivor with a knife. And sprint burst on demand. And a terror radius
---
Dwight main detected
---
Broken? Nah, if you were to pick it up right now it works fine from a technical standpoint, and you can buy the entire first set for $40, making it cost about the same as your standard AAA title.
---
Mind, the playerbase dips below 100 concurrent players, so I don't recommend doing so.
---
The problem is that the game is incredibly poorly balanced, though it is better then when it first launched. Take Green for instance; for 7 mana, you can get a 7/7 that heals your tower for 7. Alternatively, for 8 mana, you can get a 14/14 with Siege 6, which means it still deals 6 damage even if you block it. Because of how ridiculously big the late game threats are (For 9 mana you can play a 3/11 that fully restores your mana every time you cast a spell), it feels like it completely invalidates earlier stages of the game.
---
Another major problem with the game is just what type of cards the game gave us right off the bat. In Magic; The Gathering for instance a typical set will have maybe two board wipes at the 3-5 mana range so as to let control decks reset the board. **Artifact decided to give Blue four board wipes standard, two Heroes board wipes as their hero card, and then a couple of "enchantments" that deal damage to everything on the board as well".** You'll make a board, a blue hero will suicide into it every. single. turn.
---
Also, there are three lanes to play in (You have to win two of them or one of them twice), and two 2/4 creeps that spawn in automatically into random lanes. You can't control where they spawn. When they spawn, they go into empty spots in the lane and you can't control which spot they go into. Add to that that there are Arrows that randomly tell the creep where to attack and you have no control over what is going on with them. Then you realize that initial hero deployments suffer from the same thing; decks can win or lose entirely dependent on if their Hero lines up against an enemy Hero and snowballs the game from there.
---
Now, it should be noted that high end players have 80-90% winrates in Artifact, where as in Hearthstone they only have 60-70% winrates. Artifact rewards actual player skill well, it's just got a ton of feel bad RNG and quite a bit of other issues that drove casual audiences away.
---
Leatherface hmm. By any chance were you camping?

No, you did pretty well. You teammates were just bad.

No played fair I needed a daily. And they were nothing but shitheads to me the whole time. I got my daily done bc all I needed was one more chainsaw down.

It's alright, I used to have a lot of fucking cats, but a while back we were down to 3, and the one I was really attached to, Jude, ran off before we moved due to flooding. We were moving to a new house, like newly built new, so we had to get them declawed, and somebody had the smart idea to put 3 cats that didn't particularly like eachother in the first place, had just spent days in a sort of clinic, and had their front claws removed all into one carrier crate. They started fighting, and as my dad was trying to bring them inside, the slammed into the side of the crate, knocking it out of his hand, busting it open, and 3 piss soaked cats run off in different direction. We got back the one I think might actually be a mutt breed of a Fennec Fox and Kira, but Jude fucking bolted off and didn't come back.
---
Yeah, it does. They don't call it a chapter though because it's just one part instead of three. I'm sure you could suggest other terms.
---
i don‚Äôt whine about anything, i can leave if there‚Äôs no hope for me. less points for the killer &amp; i run ace in the hole lol

I had an afk killer one time where we ran in front of him to get chase points. No one tbagged while he was afk. He came back after gates were open then called us toxic in the post game chat... Face palm... 
---
Quentin or adam. But I play tapp so that takes care of him. As far as killer, its probably Freddy aand spirit. 
---
Yeah. As the woman whose name I can't remember because I haven't seen Archer in a long ass time said, "Piss reeking ocelot."
---
Suuuuure. The game is all about bloodpoint and ha soothing to do with killing as many survivors as possible. That‚Äôs why killer neeeeeeeeeever camp hooks and neeeeeeever ‚Äúsecure‚Äù kills and neeeeeeever tunnel to wipe the survivors out ASAP. 
---
Oh no, wait, that‚Äôs happens in almost every game. 
---
You‚Äôre trying wait to hard to sell ebony mori as a downside, and you‚Äôre never going to convince survivor mains of it, mostly because it‚Äôs a big fat lie. 
---
my favorite part of this is billy looking at the air in obvious amazement at the end
---

What do you mean so many hits?

You hit someone twice, hold S for one second, then follow the blood for 15 seconds. Easy down
---
Gross 
---
I THOUGHT I WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND
---
Well yeah, doesn‚Äôt change the fact that there are only 3.
---
Then that isn‚Äôt tunneling, that‚Äôs just moonwalking. Tunneling would be chasing the same guy repeatedly until finally downing them with no counterplay. Moonwalking is something else entirely but is also scummy. Devs say it‚Äôs fine though so :/
---

---
F for all doctor mains. 
---
Well leatherface is one of the worst killers in the game...
---
Regardless if hes the worst or the best just because someone's playing them doesnt mean you have to ruin their day. Doing that wasnt bad but accusing me of holding it hostage is what really pissed me off.
---
Mending isn‚Äôt healing and yet when adrenaline goes off with deep wound al it does is remove deep wound instead of healing a health state... kinda dumb. 
---
Honestly I used to agree, but then I started playing For Honor, and I realized the DbD community could be so much worse
---
Every single match in For Honor for me is an absolute salt-fest, while I only occasionally get actual toxic douchebags on DbD. And I know they're two completely different games and genres, but the DbD community seems like a Mormon playground in comparison to other communities like For Honor, LoL, etc.
---
Doctor plays nothing like the legion and gets pallet looped just like any other standard killer.
---
Let's put it this way.  I can stop a gen rush because I multitask like a motherfucker and pressure gens relentlessly but on the other side if I was to hard tunnel a survivor off hook there is nothing they can do to counter that shit.  While I identify as a killer main I play a lot of survivor too so I can empathize with their side of the game and I know what it feels like to be hard tunneled off hook and it's a really shitty unfun experience.  At this point in the games balance I can play extremely fair and still routinely 3k or better even against a sweat squad swf.  I main the weakest killers no noed and fuck that booty up most games.  I don't mind working harder for my wins if it means both sides can enjoy a fun competitive game.  Post game I'm far more likely to receive a gg then salt and I like that.  The game is in a very healthy place for killer right now.  There's no need to sweat that hard and ruin their opportunity at a fair game.
---
I play both survivor and killer equally but I think removing ebony would be unfun and unnecessary 
---
sarcasm? 
---
Even with camping (As the OP mentioned he wasn‚Äôt) the whole thing is the definition of toxic. You‚Äôre obviously suggesting a reason they got mad and undoubtedly do not take their side but it‚Äôs clear how utterly terrible this community is, where slight things trigger people so they go out of their way to ruin the experience of the other side 
---
There are only 3 base survivors silly
---
Yes... I know. But they can't message you.
---
If you ruin someone's gaming experience, why should they not do the same to you? 
---
Rogue or rouge?
---
Tapp and probably Hag (Xbox)  also don't see many Adams or Jeff's anymore
---
It's worth it though
---
r/screenshotsarehard
---
The problem is people are D/Cing regardless on situation. They're doing it because they got hit first, or the killer found them, or someone else got downed. 
---
The reason doesn't matter, the problem is people are D/Cing every single game.
---
Once I hook a survivor I continue with my objective which is to stop survivors from escaping. That means stopping them from doing generators. You can't stop survivors from doing generators if you linger near a hooked survivor hoping for another easy hook by tunnelling them.
---
Camping and tunnelling may be an easy way to get success in this game sometimes but it is cheap, spoils the game for others, encourages disconnecting and toxicity, and more importantly it is not fun and you will not get good this way. Have fun and challenge yourself to get good. 
---
Sometimes it makes sense to return to the hook if I hear or see a rescue attempt and I'm close enough. Sometimes it happens in my face. If so, out of the two survivors I may very well down the person who has just been unhooked, sometimes it would be stupid not to, but if I do I will leave them on the floor and chase the other. I will not hook them. 
---
Understand this is not just about giving them a fair game though. I am getting something from it. They can't do anything lying down. Like bait, they will draw at least one other survivor away from their objective who you may well turn to target also. As long as you are stopping survivors from doing gens it doesn't hurt to injure them all before you get another hook.
---
Have you lost your fucking mind?
---
Except it's a big map and everyone runs once they see you, meaning you have no way of hitting more than 1 person.
---
Oops I meant rogue, now I‚Äôm picturing monochrome red colored teenagers running around lol
---
I only do it when I‚Äôm expecting a new survivor so I can get their level 40 then max out my nea again.  I would not recommend just hitting 1m bloodpoints to do it because it takes a long time to spend those points at once
---
Lol üòÜ
---
Lol. "Good Legion"
---
Are you talking about the build where you defend the basement chest with insidious, or the build where you try to get survivors in the basement to camp them?
---
Because neither of those seem like fun for either side
---
I worked it over with the guy and apologized. I was just about to get red of the comment, you fucking crack fiend 
---
We can be twinning! It's adorable cuz Feng and keeps you warm, what's not to love!
---
Yes 
---
I think a good fix for moris is you can only mori someone who got hooked twice 
---
It sucks to be hooked, then camped. But camping is a way to kill a survivor, a method of doing your objective. I prefer running MYC but especially for someone like Leatherface it can be the right call
---
Holding the game hostage does nothing to benefit you at all, apart from having the satisfaction that the killer is rightfully angry at not being able to just leave. 
---
You can justify anything as ‚Äòruining someone‚Äôs gaming experience‚Äô. Actually killing a survivor. Interrupting a heal. Patrolling one particular generator as it‚Äôs almost done. Losing isn‚Äôt fun, but each side‚Äôs job is to made the other side lose
---
That doesn‚Äôt make it okay to them to hide around and force him to DC to actually leave 
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm really close to not playing this game. Getting points can be a grind. And when the game crashes it‚Äôs ok, I mean it can happen. But when it crashes so frequently I feel cheated on. That game would probably brought me 60-80k (BBQ+Survivor Pudding)

TBH I have trouble memeing around as killer. I try to just be a funny meme man doing meme things but the survivors still g e n r u s h and act very impolite.
---
As survivor, however, I've had great success with memeing around. Head On is the ultimate perk for this. Change your win condition to stunning the killer with lockers as much as possible. If you have friends, compete with them.
---
Can we discuss that incognito window notification 0w0
---
Here is something other killer mains definitely don't want to hear and certainly will probably bite back on me for.  Gen rushing is 90% the killers fault.  90% of the games I play where a killer is gen rushed it's because they over-committed to chases with multiple survivors up they had no business being in and did nothing to pressure survivors off the gens.  If you chase a survivor for 2 minutes what the fuck do you expect the other survivors that you haven't so much as acknowledged to be doing during that time lol?  If you only commit to chases where you know you can down the survivor quickly and efficiently you can slow the game down considerably when it comes to popping all the gens.  If you're in a situation where you're up against a strong survivor at a strong part of the map, force whatever pallet you're at down, break it then abandon chase to pressure the gens.  If you do this routinely over time they lose their defenses nearing the endgame when you have a gen or two up and that's assuming you even make it that far if you're up against multiple juke gods.  Typically at least 1 or 2 players are on the weaker side.  I pay no mind to the first couple gens.  The game slows down considerably when it comes to the final couple gens that you've strategically smashed their surrounding defenses around.  I aim to finish every game with at least 1 gen up or more and this strategy works far more often than it doesn't in accomplishing this.  Killers need to take a long hard look in the mirror and take ownership for their killer play contributing to a gen rush.
---
Yeah, the state of PS4 DBD atm honestly makes me sad. I agree they should have left the matchmaking on because at least the game was actually playable and not just a waiting simulator :/
---
"Had a Michael Mori me then DC on everyone with 1 gen to go but didn‚Äôt hook anyone else yet!" Pretty sure we were playing together hahaha, 3 hours ago from the time I comment?
---
I haven‚Äôt downvoted anything, and the simple fact you‚Äôre calling me ‚Äògay and stupid‚Äô for alleged downvotes confirms the type of person you are. Downvotes are for expressing your opinion a comment or post, not for showing how you feel about a person. If you‚Äôre so sensitive about downvotes don‚Äôt comment at all, so nobody disagrees with you
---
And yes it‚Äôs fine. Camping is a playstyle. Holding the game hostage to force the killer to DC is the type of thing wrong with this community
---
You wouldn‚Äôt loop with nurse, or run in the open as pig. Leatherface is a killer with no mobility but an AoE instadown. A defensive killer. Blame the developers for the design of the character if you‚Äôre that angry about it, don‚Äôt just bully somebody out of bloodpoints and pips because you‚Äôre angry. Nothing about that is fine at all
---
I seriously agree with this so much,  even tho you'll seen be attacked by killer mains. I play as BOTH,  but started as a full survivor main. I sucked as killer,  now that I'm good,  I fully enjoy it. But i think starting as a survivor main helped me,  i don't camp people,  will tunnel if they've had time to get away and I find them again,  and if someone hook farms someone I'm going for them not the person just getting off the hook because it's "easy." Everyone is mad about the DC rate but doesn't want to admit to the toxic things that have brought them on,  and then their are shit cans who just DC on a first hit or for NO absolute reason.

Ok. Guess I don't see the humor in standing still, but go each his own.
---
I agree.
---
I saw the Ash Williams announcement. I'm a huge Evil Dead fan. But I don't give a shit because the game is currently uninstalled and will remain that way unless the pip system is improved.
---
No desire to play if I am punished for playing a perfectly fine game. I mean survivors can outsmart the killer and escape without being hooked, oh sorry they all de-pip. Likewise killer can outsmart survivors and down them before 1 gen is done, also de-pip. The system is idiotic and flawed and doesn't reward skill.
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue with surveillance lol. The mighty bloodweb giveth, and it taketh away

Once both exit gates are opened, there should be a timer for survivors to leave, like 2 minutes. If they haven't left by then, their auras should be permanently shown to the killer. 
---
I don't mind pushing people out as much as others do but it annoys me when you check both exit gates, can't find anyone and they won't leave as well. 
---
Lana, Pam, Cheryl, Malory
---
speaking for myself &amp; myself only since we‚Äôre talking about MY logic, i don‚Äôt whine at all when i get camped. being someone whose been rank 1 as both survivor and killer at the same time i‚Äôve done my fair share of both sides of the toxic life. so when i get camped &amp; have no hope of surviving, i leave. when i get tunneled &amp; still survive i t bag. why? cause it‚Äôs the circle of life. killers will camp and tunnel meanwhile survivors will t bag at exits &amp; do their own form of trolling as well. the logic i put forth is cause and effect. toxic killers get toxic responses in return and vise versa
---
Wait, is that what moonwalking means? I thought it involved Legion walking backwards for some reason.
---
That's the thing they teabagged on house roof and blinded me I went up there I chased em to gate and then left to destroy everything when I came back and was on my phone alas there they are again.
---
I always secretly wished that they would release a killer that could disguise itself as one of the survivors in the trial, would def keep them on their feet. 
---
Well the perk deactivate when the killer put you into the dying state üò¨
---
:/
---
"We have been hoodwinked, bamboozled, lead a stray, run a muck and flat out deceived"
---
If you purposely go after a particular survivor to hook them again straight after they have been unhooked you are tunnelling. 
---
You would probably be blatantly camping or not straying too far from the hooked survivor. Some hide it better than others but it always ends the same. They are back at the hook just in time to immediately down the just unhooked survivor again or close enough for the chase music to commence they'll go straight for them. 
---
For the idiots out there, if you got unhooked with no killer in sight, traverse around the map and manage to get yourself found and hooked by the killer again before they found anyone else, you were not tunnelled. You are simply either shit at the game or just shit out of luck.
---
There is no such thing as gen rush. It literally makes no sense when doing gens is the sole objective of all survivors. A toolbox will get a gen done a little faster.
---
Too late bud. Survivors are gonna feel the full extent of my legitimate camping strategy, thanks to guys like you. 
---
All I read was camping is fine and I should defend my hooks
---
If you‚Äôre not looking at the survivor it doesn‚Äôt trigger a chase, and the mend timer goes down when not in a chase. Imagine a legion following your trail really close to you but with their back turned ready for you to eventually stop to mend
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be a thing but the devs said it‚Äôs fine so we won‚Äôt be seeing any fixes in the near future. It‚Äôs a pity because Legion is supposed to excel in pressuring multiple people, but most people use this trick to guarantee a down ignoring loops and windows. Tunneling is also common on Legion, just chasing the guy and hitting them over and over since you can vault and move quick to make sure they don‚Äôt get away but it takes a long time 
---
It's fine to have a reason, and maybe do it every now and then, but people shouldn't be doing it every single match. It's hard to actually play the game right now because whoever is losing D/Cs.
---
&gt;That's the thing they teabagged on house roof and blinded me I went up there I chased em to gate and then left to destroy everything when I came back and was on my phone alas there they are again.
---
Its your fault then, should've pushed them all the way out... Instead you came here to cry like a baby. 
---
If people boycott the game and make them lose even more money than they will have to remove him. There's already petitions I've been spreading with hundreds whove signed.
---
There was the one with the shopping cart, though I can't find it anymore.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand. Camping IS fine. There‚Äôs counterplay and specific perks even to fight against it. There‚Äôs nothing the killer can do when you just hide for half an hour because you don‚Äôt like them
---
Doctor should drool with that shit and do damage /s
---
I'll definitely go for the unhooker in that situation if the trap triggered is near the hook at all. If it's not, then I consider the unhooked player to have had a chance to play and they fucked up again.
---
A Legion with dying light would make me kms
---
Not really cry just kinda irritated as I said if you read my earlier comment. Only thing that pissed me off was how I'm the one holding it hostage when theres an exit gate open right in front of you which I chased you to to begin with yet you wasted ten minutes of your time instead of leaving.
---
You have the chainsaw bud. Do something about it. The power is in your hands. It's their fault if they get killed for not leaving.
---
The Trapper nendoroid is real though.
---
Okay
---
solo survivor is rough :/ games like you described are the worst.
---
Me too and some pussy always DC‚Äôs at the start :‚Äô(
---
If people can get to the best ranks in league of legends using a trackpad. You can play dbd with any mouse.
---
Tunneling is the survivor's fault; no unsafe rescues, no weak players to immediately target in the vacinity. We can do this all day, just dodge the point and rant about the core gameplay loop. Like I said from the beginning, it doesn't matter that you empathize more with survivor gameplay and their ibkeg, let's just try and be self-aware about it and the double standards were encouraging. 
---
It‚Äôs for the meme, theagitatedapricot
---
"Not sure where I found this or who the artist is" then don't post it :/  Thank you for your efforts Heavens!
---
Is it 2 days already? I've just spent 1mil on Myers 
---
:0
---
And then you drop all of the marbles so you can run faster as your teammates yell at you bc you had almost won
---
Guilty üòî
---
This is so damn adorable.
---
If the killer is using Enduring, DS is basically useless. Jt stuns the killer for like 0.5 seconds
---
And youre just panicking and running for your life through the little town
---
Then why are you still searching through the reddit lmao.
---
And then a damn fence or tree gets in your way
---
i want a spirit one so bad üò≠
---
Yes!
---
There is no such thing as tunneling. It literally makes no sense when killing survivors is the sole objective of the killer. 
---
Why use Adam when you can use Ash
---
I hate it sometimes like half of the time when killers dc I lose a pip or if I get moried like 
---
#HMM
---
Yea I'm not able to play solo survivor because of it
---
That poor Jeff knew it was coming 
---
&gt;It doesn't matter what people say. It matters what you do. If you tunnel your being a prick
---
You're being a bit entitled tbh, there's no difference between getting gen rushed out ifs match in five minutes or tunneled out it. 
---
Nope, wraith is pretty lowtier while pig is mid tier. The biggest issue with the stealth killers is that just stealth isnt enough. When you get some more experience, youll begin to notice crouching pigs, cloaked wraiths and even the direction of freddys lullaby more often, the only killer that is usually considered op is the nurse, or legion with the franks mixtape addon. 
---
There's few times where I think a killer is being intentionally toxic. (Since it's their job to kill us, after all.) This is one of those times.
---
Say it with me, kids. Vikings did not have horned helmets.  
---
This is more so a Dragonborn outfit.
---
I have to admit that I've done this when there's a 3 man swf.  
---
I don't usually just focus the solo person from the start - besides I forget their names as soon as the map loads, I just know there's a 3 man swf but I forget who their solo is.   
---
That being said, I play like usual, but if it's a well coordinated swf and it's usually easy to either pick their weaker player and that's usually the solo, So I just say fuck it, I'm already tilted and end up going for their solo. Not proud of it, hopefully I'll learn how to handle swf with time but in the meantime I need some bp.
---
The whole 'Wraith only tunnels' isn't really prevalent on the PC. So when it happens, it sucks a whole lot. I feel sorry for survivors on console if this is what they have to deal with. 
---
You certainly know how to become Public Enemy No. 1, I don't know if that's a byproduct of your insufferable need to act edgy. 
---
"Yeah man, I'm insane- everyone knows that! It's not legion, though!" The cringe readings are off the fucking *charts.*But then again, with public backlash like this, there was never any hope anyway. Look at all those downvotes! Let me add one for ya bubba. 
---
And oh lawd they comin
---
yes !!
---
A very rare occasion. 
---
*Bonjour!*
---
Happy cake day, by the way!

new killer perk
---
You are a disgusting person. You punished the 1 person who stayed in the game. You are the reason people think all killers are toxic
---
Yeah because people have a sheep mentality on this shitty site. It's pretty clear that the general consensus is that legion players are assholes irl and that legion is a shitty killer, yet I get attacked for saying I hate legion. Dumbass neckbeards
---
Playing solo is so tough, I often have this happen. Had a wraith tunnel and camp me all game yesterday and that was the first I booted up, like you.
---
Really puts you off. I feel for you, man.
---
Yup same, especially when the killer dc and the bar showed you did enough not to lose a pip, but you still lose it.
---
I forgot to turn on the passive recorder like shadowplay but i sure gotta remember about it next time
---
Still good that i have such a monitor that actually with phone its not that bad as i have seen
---
Moris aren't supposed to be useful.
---
This was not a well coordinated group at all. The only competent one was the flashlighter. :( If I suspect SWF I keep pressure on them all, personally. Especially if I don't know if anyone is solo, but I also go out of my way to make my games fun, even if it costs me a kill or two. 
---
I just don't like ruining the game for one person in particular, and I especially don't like it happening to me.
---
Yes camping sucks, you'll hear no argument from me there partly because I agree and partly because nobody was talking about it.
---
Whatever your personal definition of tunneling is, the fact that the killer is consistently shamed for targeting the weakest link/unhooked survivor and capitalizing on their opposition's bad plays is hypocritical, especially in the face of the fact that everyone is fine with survivors rushing *their* opponent out of the match. If your argument is some form of *'well sure its in your best interest to rush the objective, but what about your opponent's fun?'* then it isn't really much of an argument at all, why can't each side just try their best to win and not take it personally when the other player does as well? 
---
damn! thanks!
---
It does. It's not a very good start, for sure. Sorry it happened to you too. :(
---
Bro I've had so many DCs, afk survivors, trashcans that don't save anyone... Im just gonna camp survivors with LF the rest of the week.
---
If im not having fun, nobody is.
---
But nobody is soliciting you for advice on how to play, we're talking generally about the ethics of rushing the objective. 
---
Ur name is literally toxic feng
---
Awh seriously?? Thats  a missed opportunity fuck
---
Definitely underrated. It's good for the beginning game too so you don't waste time searching at Gens/Areas that aren't populated. Worthless on The Game or Lery's though honestly, you can hear birds/footsteps pretty well on those maps already so I feel like it's pointless.
---
Your Pc sounds like it's gonna explode, you should check up on it and ask if it's still in a good relationship with Dead By Daylight.
---
High Risk/High Reward. Either it saves your ass, or you get grabbed from it randomly on Healthy and brought to a hook.
---
You gotta step up your game, you gotta put them in the basement then wait outside watching the entrance with Insidious. Other then will you become a godlike Basement Camper Leatherface
---
I‚Äôm don‚Äôt think so because none of the other survivors took too much interest in me like they‚Äôd seen Jesus or something. It just went like a normal game 
---
Damn cuz then when killer rolled around just get under a hook and they‚Äôd prolly just ignoring (at lower ranks of course)
---
I don't know... Personally, I don't see a problem with moris in their current state. Maybe I need to be mori'd several games in a row to change my mind, but for now they're ok in my book.
---
Once you spin your camera more, and get more general map knowledge/awareness of common paths you will get caught by them less.
---
They're scary as hell when you're new, but some of the more easily looped killers so they're far from OP.
---
I was thinking about its meme potential during upload but i couldnt do anything as it is straight from my phone 
---
It wouldn‚Äôt have worked against this killer, but I had a good time boosting around and repairing generators with my mind
---
Do you know any other of these ‚Äûgate myers‚Äù and ‚Äûspirit totems‚Äù? Sound funny but dont know how far imagination about stupid tactical there are
---
Hell yea I'm just a baby camper today. My super legit camping strategies can only improve from here
---
Hex: No one Escapes OKURR 
---
Not worth it! 
---
It was never alive
---
I play whatever I need for daily or what I'm working on achievements wise. My Legion confuses a lot of survivors.
---
1. Make trash music
---
2. trademark adlibs
---
3. make trash music
---
You're fine, and thanks. &lt;3
---
OOF. Well, it all makes sense now. I've seen him be a butt in some threads, but I hadn't seen that yet. Telling people to kill themselves is really scummy. 
---
SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE KILLERS IN THE BACK 
---
Btw,  I did NOT DC,  had no intentions of it because I had a good amount of chase points. Obviously you can see the little 3 in the corner, so no the gates weren't open,  sorry to rob your favorite line. No I was NOT toxic,  I didn't t bag or anything. My friend decided to come to try to get me off the hook,  she snatches her,  hooks her, and comes back to beat the shit out of me. Guess she's SUPER proud of her face camping. Totes fun to ruin the game for other people,  then bitch about dcs. The one person actually didn't have a reason to dc btw,  they got downed and bounced. Lol. 
---
Legion addon exploits and now Bubba facecamps I sincerely don't want to see you EVER bitch about baby killers again because you've become one.  I don't care if you are doing it "ironically" or not, you're still subjecting survivors to that cancer you hypocrite.
---
&gt;also I think it's a slow vault if you force them to run the other way
---
Lol nah brother this is an infinite. Who has time to run tiles correctly anyway.
---
Yes he does. He also comes with a shotgun, pocket knife, and first aid spray
---
Tip: Use the perk that gives you an extra first aid spray when you pick one up. For Jarvis you can drop it and pick it back up and it'll give you two for one slot.
---
The only place she can be is QT town. QT's only.
---
Your C response is perfect,  because obviously that's the point of survivors dc'ing against killers who camp for NO absolute reason. Then they come cry to reddit about how people need to be punished,  well how about punishing the person ruining the game for survivors by not allowing us to get any points? Just "ruining" the game. I love the playing killer,  and I do love to punish survivor's who taunt me,  but if I decide to face camp am I going to be mad because they DC? Hell no, I expect it. Lol. Some killers feel so entitled to a 4k because that's their "job" to kill survivors,  but that doesn't mean every match you're going too. Just because someone out plays you doesn't give you the right to camp them. It's annoying. I don't care to die,  I don't care to be camped when the gates are powered,  I except my loss and move on. But with THREE gens left it's insane to camp someone. 
---
I obviously figured you didn't read the other comment which is why I told you too, I didn't feel like retyping it. 
---
Agree to disagree,  but if you bitch about dc'ing but ruin that game for survivors,  YOU are the problem. 
---
so is wrongfully banning half of your player base. your point?
---
Holy shit the downvotes in this thread are sad when you actually put more nuance and effort into this discussion than 90% of threads in this sub.
---
I can't speak to the rest of your points, but even as a Survivor mostly these days I can see how problematic this perk could be for the M1 killers. I just don't get why it punishes the worse killers more. I'll reserve judgment until it's out but I can already hear the killer cries of anguish from 4-stacks running this. Their reprieve from the horror DS brought was shortlived, it seems.
---
i will swallow you if you keep making nea is a killer jokes
---
Are those the characters? The one I'm thinking about is Archer's mom, I think.
---
LMAO WHAT
---
What do you mean? That's not at all in your line of sight. It's hidden behind a box and everything. smh
---
 \^/s
---
Mettle of Man does seem somewhat scary, can't blame poor Evan.
---
I can't get mad at anyone that plays Legion (I even try really hard not to get mad at the person for using Frank's Mixtape...). I just remember that BHVR are the ones that allow it to continue/the ones that designed the killer
---
How often does DLC go on sale? I just recently bought all the licensed dlc from last week‚Äôs sale. 
---
I was just surprised... I also don't think that warrants wanting him dead but ok
---
You wild lol what rank if I can ask? Because any time I watch really strong survivors play against Doc, he just gets looped for DAYS. No real catchup mechanic, since even though shocking disables pallet throw, you can just keep running since Doctor gets slowed to use his power
---
Voice chat between survivors is a huge advantage that SWF gets that is honestly better than any single perk survivors can use, yet it's just free.
---
Welcome to people who think just because there is a swf in the group, it's okay to tunnel anyone, especially the one guy that is not in that group and doesn't even speak the same fucking language.
---
After 20 Mins of waiting I got an all 20 player lobby.(except for me, the 12) Nurse‚Äôs connection had me teleporting, Teammate down at gate stage, go for him bc fully healthy, not hooked, and borrowed time. Grab him, get hit. He‚Äôs off, get downed. Nurse hooks me and then camps me while my scared teammates just watch me, all healthy.
---
At that moment I realized, fucking forget about other players and just leave.
---
Who's your other favorites? That's why I fell in love with Billy at first, I loved how fast you can play once you really get the chainsaw power down
---
By ragequitting you essentially threw the game. If you went after someone else you could have still won Mr ebony mori 
---
I just loved how People complained so hard about how Survivors were dodging lobby's of good killers using MLGA, even though killers do it 24/7
---
Did you forget the /s?
---
Lol its not accurate my team use teamspeak.
---
And we dont teabag
---
It may seem that way at first.  But once you get a little experience, these are some of the weaker killers in the game.
---
I mean i can see plagues power 
---
discord
---
I'm able to use dr. effectively at rank 12, I've probably gotten higher rank with him too but I don't remember
---
I thought it was going to be a cross over between life is strange and dbd which  would be cool. 
---
Didn't think it was necessary. Thanks for the downvote though brother may I have some more
---
Awwwww, look at the little spirit and Adam, they look so happy. Nea, however, looks disgusted.
---
Considering how it was a 4-man swf, there was no way I was getting out. Shame about the mori tho
---
Darn
---
Did you just make a drop the soap joke I regards to a female prison
---
I didn't downvote you, but go off, I guess.
---
I think the obvious solution is to make the Fog so thick that you can't see Survivors even if you're right on top of them.
---
That way you can't be scared by how creepy they look.
---
Bro. I literally just sat through almost 15 minutes of slugging. It was garbage and wasted my time. 
---
Why am I being punished for another survivor's actions? Just hook me and be done with it.
---
Secondly. You just said if the other survivor would come out and heal the other person... 
---
I'm like really? So they should come out because you want them to, because you feel entitled to kill them, otherwise someone like has to have my night wasted crawling around on the ground four or five times. Yay. 
---
I see no lies
---
No, she didn't want to slip, get ur head out of the gutter /s
---
I actually own it. Got that game years ago at a flea market, but never played more than an hour of it. Need to dig that out and give it a proper try.
---
Thanks for the reminder.
---
Hell yea bro facecamping is fine. 
---
Is it only on this tile?
---
just saying . other ppl i wouldn't stop it from happening but i would never do it myself since they'd be doing us a favor but again. i wouldn't and i know players who have been banned for no reason infact my friend was banned for hacking when he didn't cheat and streamed the game all the time so if you choose to ignore ur community's pleas for help u best expect a attack of some sort.
---
pff, some players are already waiting 30 min for a lobby only for the Host to DCs when you find one
---
Literally half of the games someone disconnects.
---
No matter the build of the killer.
---
Does it get worse if people use OP addons? Yes.
---
Especially if they are "very balanced" like Iri head, 5 blink Nurse or Frank's mixtape.
---
Still yesterday I had 2 of my teammates DC against a Wraith without Ruin while there were 2 gens left because he proxy camped the basement. So it's not true people disconnect ony because the killer has a meta build.
---
Malory is his mother. Pam is the fat white lady, Cheryl is the brunette and Lana is the hot ex
---
This all the time. Lockers aren‚Äôt safe jukes anymore. Even billy saws through it sometimes. 
---
Ah, alright, thank you.
---
Blood warden 
---
Tbh it's an exploit. I wouldn't blame if someone DCd.
---
No problem. I love Archer
---
Ngl this made me laugh
---
I think it's because those are rounded values and that your not exactly at 100
---
this is why i love and always run dead hard 
---
I know a troll post when I see one
---
I really wish every list like this had a "Stares" section and the only killer to ever be in there is Myers. I don't know why but the idea of Michael Myere angrily staring at a stuck bag of chips in a vending machine gets a good chuckle out of me.
---
Baby killer du du du du
---
Its clearly not the same as cheating. 
---
That does not make it any better to use those exploits, but hey killer abused the r-exploit for almost a year...
---
Are you-
---
...
---
Oh right, it's April Fools.
---
/u/Zombiehuggerr
---
Fuck that trash bitch. I'd rather play with 1,000 new players than one waste of a load like that.
---
You're 100% right. 
---
Unfortunately some of us are newer killers and I personally still don't know how to deal with a well coordinated swf. I have a hard time applying pressure especially because in my experience, there's at least 1 of them that's either a rank 5 and below  - I'm rank 12-13 atm - and/or deranked (very easy to tell). Sometimes all of them are. There's a lot of mechanics, tricks and knowledge they have that I don't, on top of that, they're in comms.
---
That said, if they weren't coordinated, I would've 100% gone for the swf and not for the solo. I do get a kick out of beating a swf whenever I can.
---
I play a lot of solo survivor and I've been in the same situation a lot of times too, so I know how it feels.
---
I don't get why using non-meta perks is fun? Like people "ooh, I'm going to use NOED and Play With your Food and Remember Me and Fire Up and then occasionally move around and vault windows incrementally faster with no other benefit heheheh how fun" and then they get their asses kicked by people who are actually making smart choices, and then they act all surprised and hurt by it.
---
I hate april fools...
---
Actually decent survivors: yes.
---
‚Äúhundreds whove signed‚Äú
---
Well thats almost 1% of the playerbase. Impressive
---
Nahhh you shoyld‚Äôve done it while jeff is spinning in the air, Idk how to do it myself because im stupid
---
You literally could just have paged me at a better time. 
---
Not even exaggerating. I am sitting here chewing at my nails with SFM open for 5 minutes while I think about which one next. 
---
Dwight has ascended.
---
I can sympathise if you ran freddy to him. You couldnt have known but i just did a match where i was discovered 3 times because they led Billy to me. 
---
I play PS4 and tend to main killer, but I've found that pipping has become atrocious to attempt. I think the main problem is that it got unrealistically difficult to pip as killer so even killers are playing survivor like I am now. I'm killer rank 10 now bc I don't tend to play a lot (bc of the matchmaking changes), but I've had games where I 3 or 4 man and either black pip or single pip despite playing as optimally as I can. I even had a game where I de-pipped despite killing 3 people and the last one got hatch bc I caught them so fast and they barely did any gens. It makes it so playing really well actually punishes you so I just kinda stopped. 
---

K
---
Lol imagine taking a video game this seriously
---
60% of 16 seconds is not 1.7 seconds.
---
It doesn't work on most loops
---
And then happily get the rest of the team deaded
---
Nah, add some sorta insta down on top of her blinks as an addon and make her only one blink but it auto aims on a target and she blinks on top of them. Maybe then the game will be balanced.
---
Especially since reverse image search is a thing.
---
Same here, though I've been getting a flurry of friend request with nasty messages attached to them :/
---
Don't forget annoy the fuck out of everyone 
---
Literally anything interesting? Uploading a clip of yourself using dead hard and jumping in the hatch is the equivalent of me uploading a clip where I use sprint burst to go unhook a teammate. There is nothing special or interesting about doing that.
---
Normally the only killers that are super toxic on PS4 are Doctors, Pigs and Leatherfaces
---
that's why i love Spine Chill, it's an amazing perk (a better version of Premonition) + those killer are exactly how Dead Hard works on killers. those stealth killers will get you only once, then it won't work for the rest of the game. 
---
preach
---
It can just depends on the survivor
---
Yea I don‚Äôt downvote people for making arguments, it‚Äôs also not the first time I got accused for it too
---
Not with this killer because he is decent and he would notice the notification above my name isn‚Äôt hooked
---
System?
---
Don‚Äôt forget dedicated servers
---
I feel like killers that are purposely afking to either derank or just didn‚Äôt mean to play ALWAYS run noed. And usually they only smack people that poke them at the end haha. It‚Äôs great because it makes the survivors panic for a couple seconds 
---
I want the hillbilly :3
---
Thanks I hate it

I always found that game mode better when you had enough friends to not have yoshis. The yoshis were kinda bs and prevented you from hiding.
---
Glad someone linked it.
---
Can you please get sounds of David King, he sounds like Scooby Doo lmao
---
Hahahhaha get it super original commenting???!?!?!??!11//!?
---
Man, we love that game so much we made our own rule set to spice it up.
---
Is the survivor a fucking degenerate moron?
---
Yes: it works
---
No: it doesn't
---
haHAA
---
That assuming its "farming for karma" and not just someone who wanted to share a cool pic they found.
---
How about turning gens into a vending machine
---
I tried playing 2 man swf yesterday. Between infinite load screens, lobby dodging, high ping lobbys and long matchmaking times we had 1 game in 40 minutes, and it wasn't even that great of a game. Then we got iri head and ebony mori Huntress an I couldn't be bothered. Say what you want but after 40 mins of having the game freeze, being kicked from lobbys, and waiting in a fucking queue I can not be bothered with that. Lobby dodging is really starting to piss me off when the matchmaking is taking so long. 1 person has a toolbox? DODGE! 1 perdon has a flashlight? DODGE! But killer has an ebony? Oh that's perfectly fine don't do dare dodge yourselves survviors or you're being reported! Not to mention I've notice a reccurring thing where when you're put in a lobby with people who might be decent (you check their profile and its 1000 hours played) the killer will always dodge. But when you get a lobby with a 89 hours claudette that lobby is always accepted and your team gets dismantled rather easily. I get why people do it but I really think this picking and choosing of lobbys is becoming a real issue 
---
Then I tried solo survivor. Faster matchmaking times, just as much infinite load screen, high ping and lobby dodging. Killers on offer were....Billy, billy, billy, billy billy. Billy ALWAYS with Ruin, rest of the perks were some combination of Enduring, spirit fury, bamboozld, bbq, noed. That's it. That's all the variety you get.
---
So I figured I'd try killer before I turn it off. I pick Spirit. I always use Nurses on her. So I figured I'd bring sloppy. Decided ya know what I'll take the mother+daughter ring and fathers glasses. That should be a good combo. I dont normally bring red items but I need some fun after the shit I've been through. Load game, hit dwight, phase walk.....oh....fathers glasses are bugged right now. They don't show blood. In fact blood didn't seem to be showing at all. This combined with the fact that its really hard to hear survivors right now because they fucked up the audio AGAIN, after the 6 weeks of fucked up audio we had after the legion update and its like these devs just can't do anything right.
---
So I quit that because whats the fucking point in playing when my add ons dont work and start a nee game with regular yellow add ons. I throw on Stridor to counter the broken audio but Stridor now sounds like what regular grunts used to sound like before they fucked the audio.
---
Anyway I get a 4 man swf abusing borrowed time. I hook them and their friends instantly unhook them for the BT effect. All 4 were doing it. They could tell everytime im phasing too because of that stupid aduio bug they still havent fixed yet.
---
Anyway eventually they disconnect. Pissed because i didnt leave the hook area I think but its fucking hard when they literally run in for the unhook before I've even had the chance to take 2 steps away from the hook.
---
Its absolutely sucked the fun out of the game for me. Survivor is either sat waiting in lobbies for swf, going against 100 Billys solo, and killer is just toxic tbagging swf or killers who are fucked by hugs until at least the mid-chapter patch.
---
The game died with the Legion update and everyone knows it.
---
Do save 3 Daily's so you can save more than 1 million bp for the new survivor.
---
It's a survivor perk that is not garbage, of course it will be complained about.
---
It will keep going and going till they start complaining about pebble c:
---
The problem is figured out already, it's just annoying to keep solving it.
---
Maybe it can be a one time use
---
I like the idea of knocking the pallet yourself while being carried though. Like old decisive but only if they‚Äôre foolish/brave enough to walk through the pallet.
---
Thank
---
You
---
Very
---
Much
---
Except the Nintendo switch but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pass us soon enough haha.
---
I don't agree with people DC'ing for no reason,  but if a killer is literally ruining and taking all fun out of the game what do you expect? 
---
This is not a post about shitty dcs reasons,  it's at killers who know damn well why someone left. It's no fun to hang on a hook,  watching a killer stare at you. 
---
He went afk after gates were opened actually, not like he was doing it whole game 
---
I said the same thing and got downvoted. I also told them to go main pig for a week and tell me you don't agree after that. If you have a rbt on at the end of the game you can just wait for everyone to leave then use hatch. 
---
Ah. I still think it‚Äôs goofy when they do that haha
---
Imagine the 4 of the legion trying to get a single bag, lmo.
---
Just toxic, why would it be bannable? And honestly I don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôd consider it all that toxic sometimes, just a douchey move.
---
He didn‚Äôt say he played legion because of looping he said he played legion because of **fast pace gameplay**
---
It doesn't matter how crazy it is as long as you enjoy doing so. And you did a wonderful job. And as someone else mentioned, you look so much like Emma Watson. If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you should totally cosplay as Hermione some day. Either way very awesome job as Feng.
---
I have legit been sitting here with 3 people for 10 minutes. Then they leave and more join???
---
True.
---
Pipping is now frustrating and tracking is broken...
---
KaibalosesagainstYugi.gif
---
I also like to meme a bit on killer if the survivors have been really solid that match. I like to down a player and pretend to take them to a hook only to walk to the hatch or exit gates haha.
---
She was popular. Which is why everyone imagines her blonde. Tbh I like her both as long as her hair is in a messy bun I think it fits her.

Small brain: Insidious camp hook

Galaxy brain: Insidious camp random spots on the map
---
The red circle means besides destroying his flashlights, you also cut her arm?
---
My latest matches were pretty balanced ! Im around rank 8 and all the players in that game were too. Pretty nice when you got use to unbalanced
---
Just curious cause it technically makes the killer have to hit you 5 times before you actually go down to dying state with the 3rd hit not counting for anything since that tech was used
---
I love legions concept and the characters and work put into them I just HATEEEE with a passion playing against them it‚Äôs so unfun for me and it makes me get angry lol
---
Same goofiness as gate myers or basement chest bubba :p
---
The killer could've changed the direction of the loop. The survivor would have to perfectly fast vault the other way is gonna be difficult to do.
---
Yeah like how can someone genuinely say that isn‚Äôt cheating? It‚Äôs a blatant glitch in the game and abusing glitches is quite clearly cheating lmfao
---
It's not an exploit, the game just works that way so not bannable.
---
It's fucking annoying though.
---
Masked stabby guy is bad and I dislike him greatly, updoot the comment cause we all dislike them too. 
---
Least seen: Wraith and Claudette. ;)
---
Ok, sorry. Clown and Claudette.
---
Nah I get that, but the devs haven‚Äôt said its bannable so it isn‚Äôt I guess?
---
Everyone talking about killers that are good on this map but no one mentioning nurse. I hate this map as survivor but honestly, this map is fun on nurse. She can blink through the floor in case you didn't know (not going to assume everyone knows, friendly tip for newbies that don't!)
---
Like I wouldn't wear a unicorn Huntress mask all the time
---
Also my and my friends favorite map! everyone else we play with hate it :) I was really hoping the temple would be a map with 2 floors ;( I know it is but it's very smoll.
---
I mean, if the daily is gonna be broke, why can‚Äôt I get it?? 
---
Why. Freddy will either kill you all or none of you. 
---
If you use it at the perfect time it‚Äôs basically a reset button, they have to hit you 4 times.
---
I mean it only just hit April 1st in Canada where the HQ is, they might still do something, who knows. 
---
Maybe that it could have an effect where fully healing another survivor allows that survivor to gain 10/15/20% increased healing speed to you for 10 seconds.
---
While the entity blocker is broke ur playing that tile so badly, you dont need entity blocker to stop this loop
---
1. Make the survivor run the other way so they cant fast vault
---
2. Stop trying to puke at that loop ur losing so much distance
---
3. Mind game even a little and you cut the loop down
---
Definitely not intended I‚Äôd imagine but the way the game works it‚Äôs possible. I mean if it was a bannable exploit they‚Äôd fix it immediately... right? But this is dbd I guess
---
On ps4 Huntress and jake 
---
Amen
---
Do Walter White next. 
---
I too do this as ~~a killer main i know it helps most killers~~ it gives survs that use balanced landing an advantage
---
You're probably like 0.2% off. It sucks but hey the line has to be drawn somewhere.
---
What 2 exhaustion perks? And this build sounds really powerful... if you make it to the end game. But then again you could also use during the game at the cost of using ds.
---
I said avoid hits.
---
Honestly
---
Yeah. TBH, I‚Äôm stuck on rank 13 now. I‚Äôll 2 pip one game... then sandbagged or the list above. I‚Äôll get to 12, then pushed back to 14. Now there‚Äôs just a mess of red ranks playing new killers and nobody is gaining. Just a hot mess of safety pips. 
---
That smile tho üòÅ
---
r/brokebackDBD
---
Put yourself in his place. He didn‚Äôt see you not teabagging and stuff, he was afk. He got back and saw survivors messing around near him. I‚Äôd probably be like that too
---
Wtf is that Myers-ass lookin Jeff skin?
---
I would honestly love a patch where they focus on perk balance, bug fixes, and then for new content add a couple more generic perks for killer and survivor. No new killer, survivor, or map to worry about so they can focus on bugs and perk balance. Theres still a lot of borderline useless perks.
---
I think its a computer monitor but I can't tell, it might be a TV.
---
1: He's a crybaby because he's complaining about an situation he caused, instead of just downing them.
---
2: Don't see how you think I'm the loser, since I don't spend all day talking and/or complaining about a video game.
---
They tell us that a new version of the game can be tested with the new survivor. But behold, it isn't a new build, it's an really early version of the game. That would be a good joke, and be nostalgic asf
---
Understandable, if I see a Corpse Paint Jeff I run away. 
---
They creep me out too much for me to want to get too close.
---
^((Did I mention that I play the Killer?))
---
Their HQ is in canada...
---
I've had killers nod their head at me and smack me on the hook, said gg ez, then claimed it's my fault for being toxic and looping them. Did they just expect me to run to every pallet on the map and throw it down for them? Killer mains are so hypocritical. 
---
Legion is the least scary killer by a long shot. He/ she looks like some scummy little chav hoodie off the streets who has been stealing hubcaps. Just makes me want to punch him in the nose rather than run. He is also tiny. There is 0 scary about him. When scrolling through the killers I feel such shame - it is like he ruins the set.
---
&gt;I try and avoid using perks like Sloppy Butcher, Franklin's Demise and even Ruin, because I understand that facing Legion is not fun for some people. No Frank's Mixtape or Cold Dirt either because I know how cheap that is.
---
Unfortunately this doesn't justify the problems. The devs cannot  leave it down to the killers choice to whether or not to be 'nice'. This is part of the reason legion is no fun to play against. He just wanders around following you in obvious non-scary way. It is being toyed with without any way to stop it. To have fun you have to feel like you have a chance. The attitude of your last paragraph perfectly describes why people have an issue.. You are choosing to drop parts of the killer just to 'go easy' on the survivors. This is not fun.
---
the helmet is a bit too much, especially since its historically inaccurate. 
---
experience tranquility
---
It's contagious. I won't complain on my one but if someone else brings it up i do. Just like toxicity. It happened so much to me I realized i started doing it back and then to peoplewho werent being toxic at all. Its crazy had one bad seed ruins the Apple.

Cats love to see humans in pain.
---
I have fun. Unless they run decreased skill check add ons. Then I just die. Freddy is a beast under certain likes. I tell you what. That doctor guy is a good dc. He isn't fun.
---
Are those actually Roux separators used by surgeons? Lmao
---
That's kind of dickish. Before the patch, I'd allow flashlight saves instead of dropping as that made flashlights useless. I figured if I didn't check thoroughly enough or they outplayed me and got the save, they deserved it. Luckily now that's been patched and you can't drop to avoid flashlights anymore. 
---
Well, it *is* an exploit, so technically yes.  
---
On the other hand, though, it's not a widely known thing, and it's pretty difficult to pull off consistently, so I'd say it's not really a problem that's plaguing the community, meaning the developers probably don't care that much about it.
---
Yeh. He dispenses pain.
---
I had two games in a row yesterday where this happened.. Saved both clips, it's unreal
---
\*barfs all over this edlritch automata for good measure\*
---
Which is funny bc some jackass always D/Cs at the beginning  of the match. Its like, did you enjoy waiting 20 minutes for a game only to quit? Man up you wussy motherduckers!
---
Dunno the name but still it is from the beginning
---
Was this on PS4? I sent this exact message after a game with this build ahaha
---
it should be at least 5 tbh 
---
No, solo survivors don't have time to heal because they have to do gens injured since their fucking teammates are urban evading around the map at fucking red ranks
---
Tunneling sucks, but simply expecting killers not to do it isn't the solution, so you as the tunneled survivor also need to try punishing it:
---
Try to hide a little, it's hard to do when injured without IW, but it can work, resulting in the killer having to chase someone else.
---
Also try to always be in safe places, where once the killer does find you, you can immediately loop him.
---
I would also recommend running the new DS, it's not all that effective in unsafe areas, but right next to either a window, pallet, open hatch or open gate it can do wonders.
---
Just a month? Why not wish him a lifetime of camping. Its only fair. Leather face seems slow. He sucks compared to billy. 
---
That's just a wallpaper piece made by this dude who makes wallpapers. If you just search up a perk or icon from DBD on Google you'll likely find some of his work.
---
The salty survivor endgame chats have finally stopped we dont need killer ones
---
I‚Äôm guessing we get another solo killer sometime in the future to balance out Ash and then I guess one can double up survivors?
---
proof that not only survivors are toxic scumbags and 100% that person who only got 1,7k got downed the moment someone unhooked him/her and moried right away
---
her expression makes her seem ugly, she‚Äôs constantly frowning which also gives her forehead wrinkles. if she just stopped looking so angry she‚Äôd be cute.
---
I want a space map. Idc where but give me a alien in space as killer and map
---
Step 1: Sit in the spirits terror radius
---
Step 2: Since you are in her terror radius you get grabbed
---
Step 3: DC because she grabbed you and blame your mistake on an add-on that the killer doesn't even run
---
Step 4:???
---
Step 5: Profit

Oh... They're not actually bloody.

Like boycotting one dev to fix the game would change anything...

Do you mean that fictional characters who are supposed to be killers  *killed* someone? Woah. shockedpikachu.jpeg
---
Why isnt Nea a baby?
---
Literally none of those are historically accurate.
---
Sucks to suck man. Like yeah, its crappy to get tunneled, but I fail to see the point why everyone feels the need to post when they get tunneled, or facecamped. Oh well. Its in the game. Suck it up and move on. Tunneling is a killer tactic thats useful and nessecery in circimstances. SWF is shitty to deal with as killer. Should I post every time I get flashlighted? Everytime someone gets hatch? Its just a pointless post.
---
You're the type of wraith main i'd expect to hear the bell come from everytime I unhook a survivor lol. "Someone's trying to unhook? Not in my house! A survivor's trying to play the game? No sir, not here. Trying to do literally anything beside spam struggle? Are you crazy? I NEED my kill." 
---
Luv u ;)
---
read other comment.

You act like this post is taking away from upvotes that another post could have. Chill the fuck out, there's plenty to go around.

I didn't care to upvote it either because you aren't wrong but lighten the fuck up. Why bother making a post bitching when you could be productive and contribute something to a thread with purpose. Same logic, right? Answer is: Because you fucking felt like it. Same with the people that upvoted this.
---
Completely justifiable reason.
---
This escalated quickly 
---
I don't know why people complain about hitboxes when it's a latency issue. 
---
It's not my fault if references are incorrect, I didn't study history. Look at it from a cool cosmetic perspective considering I said it could be a halloween costume for him. Halloween costumes are rarely accurate anyways because they're just for fun
---
What about it?
---
it's kind of interesting how i BARELY ever see The Hag, i see her so little that i barely know how to counterplay her, i only know the basics of that
---
Meg should be in her own tier btw.
---
I‚Äôm actually the type of wraith main to actually use the mobility from my power to patrol gens instead of standing near a hook, because camping at high ranks loses you the game
---
Lawsuit: Claim another survivor‚Äôs perk as your own. Every time that survivor tries to use their own perk, their obtained Bloodpoints revert to zero.
---
‚ÄúOkurrrrr‚Äù - Cardi B
---
Disagree with Hag, Huntress and Spirit places.
---
I never said camping was fun for anyone, but holding the game hostage because you don‚Äôt like how someone plays is worse than the scummiest killer you can find. It wasn‚Äôt a discussion on whether camping was nice, or fair, or effective
---
If you think that holding the game hostage is okay for either side to do, then there‚Äôs little I can do to convince you otherwise. You‚Äôve taken this way out of proportion 
---
Thanks, this is much better feedback. It was never about it having to be positive, just the way you deliver it. The original comment just sounded so rude and made my hours of work feel like it was just a waste. Nice one, very interesting notes at the end there.
---
This is what's so funny (sad) about so many perks in this game: they could literally be twice as good as they are now, and would still not be particularly strong perks.
---
:)
---
"Baby killer ez"
---
(That sentece hurt me more than you'd think)
---
getting a lot of killers doing it as well on ps4 even after they killed someone
---
Hey :(
---
I only wish that the killers would have been paired with their respective survivor
---
Btw for the original survivors who don't have official pairs, I'd make these pairs:
---
Jake and Trapper
---
Claudette and Wraith (both invisible)
---
Meg and Hillbilly (both fast)
---
Survivor either Quenting or Adam. For Killer, it was Clown for a long time, but I seem them kind of a lot lately, while I see few Nurses.
---
Yeah, I think it is funny they choose these low values for perks like this but come out with mettle of man tomorrow which sounds really busted.
---
that‚Äôs the build for the special players that can‚Äôt get kills normally
---
Yup killers are just as toxic just as frequently as survivors are. 9/10 games killers shake their head at me when I'm hooked just because I looped them and didn't play like a Noob dropping every pallet in sight immediately. 
---
Usually this would be such a reportable offence in my eyes I would beg the entity to resummon you so I can sacrifice you a second time
---
..If a teammate is deliberately ruining your experience, you bet I‚Äôll work with you to kill them. Probably farm with you a little too, especially if the other three are dead. Sandbaggers ruin the game for everyone, they can‚Äôt act shocked when everyone teams up on them
---
That said I do have a sense of humour so if the last survivor is amusing I‚Äôll let them free either way 
---
No idea how a game like this can be out for so long but have repeated DCs unpunished. If I‚Äôm the killer I‚Äôll absolutely play around with the last guy when there‚Äôs an early DC but not all killers are as merciful
---
Oh I have used it and it's great, but I feel like there's more useful perks out there that I'd rather use.
---
F***ing gold üòÇ
---
Ive never gotten the syringe, what does it do?
---
So stoked for Ash tomorrow! 
---
Repeated dc is frm dev side.. I played both killer/survivor game and am getting dc everygame.
---
respect for the person who wasn't a pussy and DC just because you played Legion
---
those who target?
---
Rank 20 Trappers be like
---
I get a suprising amount with the doctor on rank 5
---
They need to add you first to message you, right? :o
---
I am on PC. Cause do that, and I will do your bidding
---
I heard a lot of bad things about the discord but would try. Just pretty awkward with new people I suppose lol
---
It's not because it is moonwalking that it is no longer tunneling
---
Absolutely beautiful
---
That kind of behaviour is shit but never DC or kill yourself on hook, never. If you had DC'd or suicided here she would have killed the other survivors faster. Staying in the game forces her to waste time being stupid while everybody else gen rushes and leaves. Facecamping is annoying for who ever gets hooked but it is extremely counterable by people just accepting that the hooked person IS going to die so it's better to make sure others don't too and give the killer a depip for camping with nobody nearby.
---
You could say he was just clowning around.
---
You know it b
---
Who needs a mate when us Legion players have Susie? 
---
Moonwalking is an unfair game mechanic that ends a chase sooner than it should do. Tunneling is repeatedly going after one guy even when he isn‚Äôt the best option. Downing Meg in 20 seconds isn‚Äôt tunneling, chasing Claudette for ages just to eventually down her (When there‚Äôs gens popping left and right but you don‚Äôt care) is. Interaction with the survivor is part of the game you can‚Äôt expect the killer to end chases immediately they wouldn‚Äôt down anyone would they?

I honestly don't blame them if it happens. Like 'fuck this team then'. I understand them. And if you don't want them to dc, go after the farmer instead
---
gamer moment
---
In the first frame Jeff looks like a fucking killer lmao
---
Xbox matchmaking is perfectly fine. It's just ps4 with the problem.
---
Yuy you also play Clown, nice :)
---
And yes I would just go as far from the gates as possible and then they 'feel the need' to come check my whereabouts and then I kill them and enjoy their salt.
---
Top tip : Don't swear on PSN messages. PSN's reporting system can ban accounts if a message with swearing is reported. Context doesn't seem to matter.
---
Two things. Is it a dick move to tunnel the survivor. Yes.
---
Is it a bad thing to do as killer? Not really. It gets rid of that survivor faster, and if he's an easy catch, why not? Or if that survivor is the only threat, killing him first would be for the best.
---
You're there to....kill. Not to be friends with survivors
---
A piece of bloody cosmetic (three in total, so three times you can prestige) THAT IS ALL
---
I am not saying MOM will be necessarily OP but tbh I personally think it will be obnoxious if all 4 survivors are running it.
---
In any case, I was just using MoM as an example. It has a real powerful effect and the devs probably know that yet they release perks with shitty values like solidarity.
---
Unfortunately not. I play on xbox since I dont currently have a PC. 
---
You get to use one in the first part of the chase. Once you get hooked your exhaustion resets so you can use it again once you use deliverence. The point of the build is to make a super long chase that‚Äôll easily last for all 5 gens if you‚Äôre skilled. You just have to make sure you get deliverence activated first.
---
Late game doesn‚Äôt matter because your supposed to get chased so your team can do gens.
---
I'm no claudette, but I wait cause I want to be sure that the killer won't down you again right after
---
I love it.
---
Pretty good idea but the killer perks seem kinda broken
---
That's because it's a health state
---
Monstrous shrine op
---
I understand all of that but BT should not be there.
---
filthy blade op üò°üò°
---
In reality, hex gets taken down before you get tier 3 DH :/ feels good the one game in 20 where it reaches tier 5
---
Oh my God my huntress is in pain 
---
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP HER
---
i believe those are random server disconnects. my internet didnt even go out and the game lags like one surv dcs and one just stands still then i get kicked out of the game
---
I agree with you, make more changes let us test them and give feedback.
---
My P0 Michael had never seen one single tombstone and now he's P1 lv50 but he's only got 3 tuft of hair and 2 tombstones and I still can't get back my M&amp;A and BBQ ;-;

Buy the item immediately above the one you bought in the hopes that it knocks it down.

If it works, cool. If it doesn't... I mean sun chips aren't THAT bad.

As a Legion/Survivor main I can confirm that this image is true.

I am, in fact, a snake. üêç

Hello fellow snek! üêç

Tfw more intelligent than the rest of the killers
---
I hate tru3ta1ent, but i need to admit he made a really good video on how to make the ranking system perfect
---
Anything to make Survivor more lucrative, please. 
---
Wow this nurse cosmetic is really nice, how much did it cost?
---
Literally every Julie I go against.

What does sandbagging Nea mean?

as a doctor main i do this daily before i fire up dbd

---
The barbecue pit kit? That's my exact current build lol
---
also, in my opinion, Head On and DS stun shouldn't be affected by Enduring. Solidarity should be buffed to 90%/95%100% (this perk is amazing, it's fun to use it but 50% it's not enough, that way survivors will be more altruistic and cooperative) and a little buff to Dance With Me, instead of 3s, it should've 5 and why can't Premonition be like Spine Chill? instead of having that massive CD, it should activate every time you look in the killer's direction.
---
anyway, your ideas for buffing those perks are amazing, i'll definitely use Detective's Hunch if that was in game.
---
Survivor 1: "Check it out, immersed Claudette."
---
Survivor 2: "Is she doing anything except Urban Evading around the perimeter?"
---
Killer: "Wait, I see her. I'll hit her with a stick. That'll rile her up and earn me some postgame salt."
---
what is your suggestion of how the system supposed to distinguish when disconnect was intentional? if you kill the game in task manager, that's technically as if your game crashed or internet went down.
---
So you left mid game and cannot play for 30min.
---
You're looking for problems everywhere :)
---
What are all the perks in the top pic?
---
so if your game crashed or internet went down you are still getting punished? hardly fair, man
---
Why bother feeding the troll? He's just seeking attention :)
---
‚ÄúUm ding ding? Yeah there‚Äôs these things called gens, I‚Äôll point you in the right direction for ya‚Äù 
---
Exactly why I often run whispers. And bring my Claudette stick. These are always the types who can‚Äôt loop, though I will say the bloody coldwind farm maps are the worst unless you‚Äôre trapper or hillybilly 
---
Yup just like when wraiths used that sloppy butcher bug that was not banable and that was way worse and could cause games to crash 
---
Well we cannot please everyone. I think it is more fair that the person who lost their internet can't play then that the guy fucking 4 people over can play.
---
STBFL for trapper is actually really great. Just keep smacking.
---
*Mirror Myers and Doctor mains want to know your location*
---
So the killer completed his objective and you‚Äôre mad about it?
---
Killers don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre game is ruined because they‚Äôre not playing for you to have fun.
---
I think it is better that people who lose internet can't play for 30min than people that fuck over 4 people can play.
---
i really don't think the same.
---
your suggestion is stupid 
---
 The **hardest** choices require the strongest will. 
---
she purposely throw off the game for survivors (like rush vaulting or throwing down pallets so the killer can know where survivors are) and usually teamming up with the killer, helping her/him to get the other survivors. 
---
Would be better if you summarized the results
---
Exactly this. Make it for repeated DCs in a period of time because DBD is extremely buggy and sometimes you just don‚Äôt load in
---
Idk who is down voting you but you are right adding a 30min wait time would be sorta dumb right now since this game has so many problems with crashes and lagging out it‚Äôs not even funny 
---
your reply is reatrded. in that case.
---
you're insane. so a person who's game crashed because it's so poorly optimized must be punished for 30 minutes vs 4 people who get punished for less than 10. lovely. fuck you
---
stupid
---
See you are trying to improve the idea I can talk with you. the other is an angry complainer.
---
it's funny, 'cause i'm already waiting 30 mins to find a lobby
---
I was not 'dragging it out' I clearly addressed your point how you feel because he is only 2 or so years older its ok. 
---
Frankly I think your ignoring me. My main point is your defending him like you know for a fact he hasn't done anything because you have done some research and what you found the girls have been 17. However I have seen others say they have done the same research and found he messaged 14 or 15 year olds. So point is your as bad as everyone else saying he definitely is as none of you know hence why I think you should just drop the whole pedo thing, he has done enough shitty things you can focus on. 
---
I don't care if you don't like it you have to go off what the law says and if he was 17 or 18 and he did message someone under the legal age of consent he is a pedo. I agree though this conversation has run its course. 
---
you're delusional
---
I mean sure fix the problems first tha do this change, but the change itself isn't bad.
---
the op is downvoting me, naturally. they're delusional
---
I'd rather have spiritfury and enduring tbh. Rendering 1/3 of pallets unsafe is preeeeeeetty good
---
Ok sure, give me about 30 minutes and I'll edit this comment with the link.
---
As I said to another person in these comments: You should help improve the idea, you just complain about it as if it was 100% useless and didn't offer any help to a commen problem.
---
Don‚Äôt know how anyone could bring themselves to be anything but polite to a Piggy üòâ
---
No mither should be baseline tbh.
---
You cannot give feedback seems like you are the worst one here.
---
Head On and DS should be reduced by Enduring, but Enduring should reduce them less than it reduces pallet stuns.
---
That'd be fine for Solidarity.
---
DWM is solid. 2 more seconds wouldn't break it, but I don't think it needs a buff.
---
Premonition working like that would be kinda dumb, since you'd have constant tabs on where the killer is if he's anywhere near you. Spine Chill gets to be constant because it doesn't tell you where they are, only whether they're facing you.
---
I respect you more and more. OINK
---
you didn't make a good suggestion because if there was a solution, it would be applied 100% but there's none.
---
*Teabags slowly in response* 
---
Places a RBT on your head as response.
---
I think most people agree with you - their aesthetic is inherently cool and interesting, shame that their gameplay isn't.
---
but i love indoor maps, i especially love larry's treatment theatre 
---
You could make a religion out of this.
---
you can't get to a safe spot when the killer is literally right there.
---
as for why someone would unhook with the killer right there, you realize that happens really fucking often, right? but when the killer is camping or tunneling, you have to at least give it a try. so you're forced to unhook within LOS since... the killers tunneling/camping
---
We know
---
Bring it on (From all the experience and fights you've gotten yourself into, you know how to punch. If wounded, you can punch the killer and stun him for 2/3/5 seconds) "I lost it all one day, were in alot of bar fights, now im stuck in this god forsaken place. Im done with this shit. Bring it on."
---
Im rank 8 and only had about 3 nurses the past week. 
---
So its confirmed for tomorrow then ?
---
save the best for last is legitimately one of the most underrated perks in this game ): it's soooooo good on clown i will STAND on this grave
---
if yr afk and the survivors are goofin around while you‚Äôre still in match, it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous to call those survivors toxic. 
---
Oh, well it pretty much means that the post or comment was sarcastic. Sometimes its needed and other times it ruins the whole comment 
---
It is known.
---
I believe so, I read in some article with an interview that stated April 2nd 
---
Welcome the the family 
---
Well most murders look normal that‚Äôs what there good at
---
I had this annoying SFW group with a tea bagging, flash light wielding Jake. Long story short, I'm Myers with about half T2 when they finished the gens, no one dead.
---
I pretend to go afk and sure enough they come out to poke me, and soon as Jake appears I T3 off them and drop him like a sack of potatoes.
---
Only kill I got, but man it was funny.
---
Is there a new killer coming with this?
---
I like treatment, but HATE the game.
---
I like indoor maps
---
Ah. I see. Thanks. 
---
NTA. They have to convince you that you are wrong, otherwise you will just be apologizing while you think you are right.
---
Calls to someone for help, then eats them.
---
As far as I'm aware, no. Like Cannibal, stand-alone but survivor this time.
---
No I don‚Äôt, and I didn‚Äôt even know this was a meme or anything, then the last few months I‚Äôve been reading about people watching their totems. It‚Äôs just something I did when I started playing the game to kill off a match while I ate and give some people a pass, but I‚Äôm on PS4 and it‚Äôs always Myers between 6-7pm est. 
---
Welcome to dbd. A massive salt fest. 
---
Actually the average player will get rekt by a good doctor . You're just straight up wrong lmao
---
Na because then people would have to avoid playing the game altogether to avoid that broken legion piece of shit. Which is fair enough, but I quite like how much of a statement the community has made to the devs on this one.
---
People disconnect because it is not worth 30 mins of their life humouring a legion who is 'going easy on you'.
---
It's not so much that it isn't good - it's just situational i.e. basement lf 
---
was a bug
---
I love lerys, there are lots of good loops
---
It was all in good fun, I'm sure but this is a bannable offense lol.
---
As a Myers main, I breathe Lerys like I do air. Burnt three Shattered Glasses offerings in a row once. 
---
Save The Best For Last on Spirit with a Mother Daughter Ring and reduced charge time add-on. Hnggggggh
---
A bit controversal, but Legion is actually a bit hard to play. If a Legion is good, you are fucked, but if they are bad it's easy. You just loop them. And even if they just keep frenzy stabbing you, it takes a lot of time for them to kill you (Unless they have Frank's Mixtape).
---
It will be as good as the survivor running it. Most survivors that run DH are just.. bad. Very predictable and easy to bait. So 4 swings in theory but not when it‚Äôs actually happening in game. MoM is just gonna be a crutch for newer/bad survivors. 
---
You‚Äôre also gonna start seeing a lot more exhaustion add ons being used. So..
---
Ah but you see, that is Abbachio from Jojo
---
The only thing I like more in F13 is the character models.  That game is utter trash though and the devs should be ashamed of the state it‚Äôs in.
---
It's my absolute favorite map! It's the best map for horror feelings! Horror comes from the unknown, and when you can't see the killer comming you are more anxious!
---
And the killer has a bit more work to do to actually.find the well hidden survivors
---
Best map in my opinion.
---
I want more ways to interact with the killer and skillfully survivor against them. Stealth is unreliable and pallet looping shouldn‚Äôt be the only way. They need to make stealth more reliable and make crouching sizes consistent for survivors along with adding more hiding places and limbs of sight breakers in maps. Bloodpoints for stealth as well, please. More than the measly 50 bold points
---
I was a survivor, white haired Meg that TRIED helping the person that got mori'd, but I suck
---
Yes you are correct
---
Just wait till all survivors are running mettle of man... Dead By Billy v2.0 coming again
---
Dead by Daylight‚Äôs 3rd Paragrsph, which has been awhile.
---
I remember there being an Army Of Darkness tower defense game where you played as Ash, I had it on my phone a while back but idk if it‚Äôs official
---
Not to discredit in any way, but this kind of looks like it was just placed over a really average "distressed anime girl" template 
---
Anyone who still plays that game must have a  necrophilia fetish or something considering it's dead and all. 
---
Suck it up and get better man.
---
We‚Äôve all been there with 4 man escapes, very rare anyone even gets hatch in my games now. 
---
The messages are great! 
---
Legion has two identity, legion main too.
---
You must let the salt fuel you. Only by accepting the toxicity can you truly ascend. In no time you'll be on the sub saying things like "As a killer main" or "noed is for baby killers".
---
Believe it or not it's better than what it used to be.
---
Them to make Coldwind jungle gyms not fucking transparent
---
Oh wait I'm giving them too much credit it's only been 2+ years of 0 counterplay bullshit that could be fixed by literally replacing like 4 assets with solid fucking wood.
---
But on a less salty note I'd like to finally seem them nerf Nurse's range add-ons and Billy's instasaw, and maybe a nerf to Balanced Landing to make it bearable in some maps like Haddonfield.
---
All i really want is a Freddy rework. I'm pretty happy with the current state of the game overall.
---
What do you mean we're not friendly?! Get cancer.
---
(JK)
---
Another thing is i dont think the killer should get to the statues to get his power back i think it would be better with a cooldown like spirit or legion or else he would suffer from the same flaws as trapper
---
Reverse image search landed me on the artist's Twitter page in a few minutes. Though it's understandable as they didn't sign their work and this piece has been reposted _a lot_ without credit. The original post was on page 3 of the reverse image search results... 
---
lets all be friends to burn this map
---
thank u i thought furries were taking over dbd üòî
---
It's annoying/boring to see the Nurse all the time, but I get why it happens. If people have the choice between a bazooka and a squirt gun, they'll usually take the former.
---
Was this a public match or KYF?
---
I think most survivors like treatment center. It‚Äôs very survivor sided. Some setups can be disgusting there.
---
F13 is just a party game you fuck around in lol 
---
Same. Killer on Lery‚Äôs is slightly a pain in the ass. Other than that, I love the inside maps. 
---
My eyes 
---
Worse? Overwatch's community is probably the most toxic gaming community I have ever played/seen. Everything spiralled down hill straight after season 4 ended. It just continued to get worse and worse. DBD may have a toxic community but you cannot say this player-base is much worse. Several Youtubers who've played the game even agree for how bad the community can be to each other and over the years they've lost a lot of players because of it.
---
What‚Äôs gonna stop it tho? People are gonna be toxic regardless of the devs acknowledging that people can be dicks, unfortunately. 
---
Well afaik, it's supposed to be PS4-PC-Xbox
---
I think .... The teeth is what is freaking me out most about this.... 
---
If you hate camping to the point that you‚Äôre willing to unnecessarily waste both you and the killer‚Äôs time, learn the counters. Borrowed time, spine chill, kindred etc. If you feel entitled to have your killers play a certain way that‚Äôs not a killer issue. At higher ranks people don‚Äôt do it because it guarantees a survivor win
---
The survivors you were facing should have been especially careful unhooking against a cannibal since most people just play him like that. They played into your hands, good survivors would just do the objectives or try to lead you away for someone else to unhook. 
---
Ultimately camping sucks but it‚Äôs not abusing game mechanics, or going out of your way to just to ruin someone‚Äôs experience (Usually). Waiting half an hour to hide after the gates just to bully the killer out of points and pips is
---
I like two floored maps and inside maps.
---
From what I see, the right only talks about the Killers, they faced, not total #of Deaths, total # of Dcs, Total # of escapes, etc
---
Really love detectives hunch
---
This must be for PC?? I play on X Box and seeing a Nurse is maybe a 1/50 experience or lower
---
I feel like I'm one of the few that isn't horribly bugged by Legions.... I guess I haven't gotten any real scumbag ones
---
Damn, I never see that many Clowns.
---
I'm not a Legion main, but my chances of mating aren't the greatest either :/
---
Here's the part you're not getting: we don't control the other survivors! Duh, unhooking in front of killer is bad. You think we're controlling a 2nd person and unhooking ourselves? it's another player. I get that you think you're being educational, but it ain't working.
---
I‚Äôll take your ad hominem as your white flag of defeat. 
---
I really like Legion as a concept for sure. They have an interesting story and design. They also cover a couple bases for "similar licensed" killers, like Ghostface, The Strangers, etc. My personal favorite Legion member is Joey because his design is the best and his knife is dope. 
---
However as its been said at nauseam, its annoying to play against. Im a survivor main and I'll never disconnect because of the killer or anything like that. But wow Legion really tests your patience. With a slight rework of abilities they would be really great and fun. 
---
There was no punishment for taking the game hostage back in the day, for example. Heck, Mathieu even made fun of killers who complained with the classic "git gud" when they mentioned the true infinites.
---
That's how little the developers have cared to fight the toxicity back then. 
---
Imagin how cool a Giant temple with an underground catacoomb would be, but instead of gidion doors, it would trapdoors and secret passag ways opening.
---
Mad Grit Freddy. Iron Grasp, Agitation, Mad Grit, STBFL. Class Photo and Green Dress. Sleep multiples. Down someone and slug if nobody else is asleep. Then pick them up and use Mad Grit to hit the dream state survivors. Super memey with Freddy because they can wake up by the time you carry someone over to them. 
---
Had me in the first half not gonna lie
---
Really? That‚Äôs surprising. Generally when I get treatment center my team does very good.
---
I auto leave the match before it starts if that offering gets burnt
---
Lovely looking orange skills, gotta love having those!
---
No, Coldwind Farm is generally terrible for Trapper. Too wide open. But I wonder... does said "Claudette stick" have Franklin's on it? 
---
...Perhaps 
---
Thanks, edgy legion teen. You've saved me.
---
No
---
It is completely broken.  A big reason is that it is almost impossible to tell where the Killer is because the terror radium is often super loud even if they are on a different floor from you
---
Defend that bitch! Lay the traps! 
---
I wanted to give Pallets another use honestly, and for the survivor to have a chance if the killer traverses through a pallet heavy area. And it'd also make the killer obsessed with the survivor, now that you mention that. As it should look like decisive but for pallets
---
As much as I, too, would like to have the hound mask, it probably won't come back. 
---
You‚Äôre everywhere üòØ
---
I love 'em both. If you want a shitty map, look no further than Rotten Fields. 
---
Sheeeeit
---
You're right but it's not as simple as an easy extra loop all the time, I recommend watching rank 1 doctors play cuz some people on YouTube are actually insane and you wouldn't expect how good they are at mind gaming.
---
(Gets stunned, still laughs) 
---
Really? No Tenacity? 
---
Big oofs 
---
Ahhh fellow big brain trapper mains
---
Yeah.  I don't have issues with that map but many do.  it is 100x more fair than The Game.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/qbMgxin
---
It has nothing to do with how strong they are. The rest of this build already has an ability to track, there's no need to layer that with more on one character when they could do plenty of other things with it
---
I thought Friday the 13th was the coolest game ever until I got Dead by Daylight. There's no going back 
---
But you have to deal with it anyway. You already didnt enjoy the match just die onhook then and gets points.
---
With the short tennis skirt?
---
If they do anything to BL they also need to bring map changes along so it's viable on all of them, rather than have it be godly on a select few maps, dead in 2 and ok at the rest.
---
**julie
---
You could wait until 2030 for the next year of the dog. Maybe then we'll get the hound mask again.

what comes after multiverse because you're way better than the multiverse
---
Nurse is mostly about practice. She's one of the harder killers to pick up, but you can get good with her and even master her pretty fast.  
---
Most importantly, learn your blink range and don't use add-ons until you know you've got a good estimation of your blink distance. Learn how to predict survivors and, at times, you can look down slightly to shorten your blink distance(even though the time it takes to blink will be exactly the same) so you can avoid getting juked by people running towards you.  
---
Just practice, get the range down, and you'll be good to go.
---
i mustve only come across good legion's then because they wreck us every time. all they seem to do is activate that frenzy and spam attacks so even if you can dodge one youll get hit by either the second or third. if they cant hit you in frenzy they continue following me wait for it to recharge then activate it again. ive only been able to escape legion twice and that was when other survivors body blocked the hook right at the end, and when i took the hatch.
---
Don't worry Freddy rework is coming right after legion rework and infinite loading screen fix. By the way does anyone remember when ds was supposed to be changed at first?
---
Can't believe this almost got me...
---
God I feel this pain all too well
---
Lol people don't know about this so they think we're just pussies I guess.
---
The best april's fools by far.
---
You know these guys .. it could be possible lul
---
All I want is a game that doesn't crash on loading screens. 
---
Perks I'd recommend:  
---
BBQ, A Nurse's Calling, Shadowborn(you either always use it or you never do), Whispers.  
---
Whispers is one of the best tracking perks in the game and is incredibly useful for high mobility killers like Nurse. I use it on nurse all the time.  
---
You don't need Ruin because you have both map control and a great ability during chases, so that clears up a perk slot.
---
The other survivors also have to be good. If they do gens, you can loop a legion for around 40-60 seconds if you are good. If a legion doesn't try to chase you, and instead gets more hits, he's probably pretty good... 
---
Why is wraith dabbing? Otherwise very good drawing &lt;3
---
Distressing with Insidious phisically hurts me
---
Probably the gayest meta build in dbd
---
Inanna didn‚Äôt  quite make sense, at least to me, due to Inanna being of youth and beauty, and her worshipping a sea-goat. 
---
However, when I recalled how she came across a statue adorned in beautiful jewels, like the statue of inanna would have on her, as well as being kept in a closed off area. She kinda took on the jewels and ideals that inanna carried, as well as being known for her beauty.
---
That being said, maybe she believes she became a god? 
---
However, I want her to still be the kind generous woman she was before.
---
What is scary though, is that she was changed due to the entity. The entity is more powerful than I thought. 
---
Did you find it?
---
Still learning how the body would look when performing X action lol. But thank you! 
---
Sleeved Biker has a mad hate boner for DBD and constantly spits out false bs acting like it‚Äôs true and will proceed to insult literally anyone who disagrees with his opinions
---
It does suck having ruin destroyed seconds into a match...
---
Not saying to camp your face off because of it
---
But, yeah lol
---
Don't let the toxic people get to you. There's still a lot of nice players out there, more than Reddit makes it seem 
---
After pallet changes I don‚Äôt think the Game is that good for killer imo. Pretty sure as of right now it spawns with the most pallets out of any map and most of them are very safe. As long as your team actually does gens instead of crouching around, it doesn‚Äôt suck for survivor.
---
Most killer should love Lery‚Äôs. Small map, gens are in the most confusing place ever, Balanced Landing only works on one area in the dead center, if you have Bamboozle you‚Äôre basically a god, there‚Äôs like 3 pallets on the whole map it feels like, Jumpscare Micheal, also the tight corners and pathing make Spirit Mindgames and Legion chases all the more exciting. 
---
Huntress hates this map afaik and Billy isn‚Äôt fond of the indoors too. 
---
Is there a source that I can steal this from?
---
I did that once to someone who kept showing the killer where we all where and then tried to take the game hostage by switching lockers in some room, didn't even try to do a gen or go for hatch then when she was found she tbagged after a palette drop. The killer thanked me and used a mori on her and told me 'that was for you' :)
---
To answer your question...when the game first came out, he didn't, but in an update they did indeed max all of his stats. :P
---
The level of cringe is strong with this one :/ 
---
I actually think the treatment theater is fun as a survivor. The maps I hate for killer are Haddonfield and anything with corn.
---
thats probably it. Ive spent way more hours on killer and have just started playing survivor so the difference in quality is very noticeable haha. When im killer I get the cosmetic neas and fengs with flashlights and a psychic knowledge of pallets, but when i play survivor the other survivors will still be cleansing dull totems while ive been hooked after looping the killer for 10 minutes. 
---
no he doesnt cause gen rush isnt a thing
---
survivors have 1 objective and getting pissed that they do it as quickly as possible is not a legit criticism 
---
Yes. Instead of you using the feedback to improve a perk/offering, you only bother arguing against it. There‚Äôs no point fighting that. 
---
It‚Äôd be a different story if most would agree with the idea, but I have yet to see those comments.
---
Pros of Amanda (The Pig)
---
- She has both normal killer chasing potential plus a stealth potential which can be used to get a free hit on survivors &amp; also to mind game around certain loops
---
- Her small height makes her much better for mind gaming loops as she is harder to track.
---
- The bear traps are amazing for stalling the game. If you are lucky you can really slow a game down with them especially if you combine slugging tactics with it or use them smartly. 
---
- The traps are good for allowing you to use other builds as they are good for wasting time. This combined with her crouch allows the pig to be one of the most versatile killers in dbd.
---
- She has that cute squeak when she gets stunned which makes being stunned more pleasant.
---
Her perks are quite good. Surveillance &amp; Make your choice being the best for punishing altruism &amp; good for tracking. Hangman trick is not very good unless devs buff sabotage.
---
- Most of her lower level add-ons are quite good with making her crouch ability stronger &amp; providing an extra trap.
---
Cons;
---
- Crouching reduces your movement speed significantly which can be harmful if not used properly
---
- Her power does not help end chases faster
---
- RNG on the traps meaning there usefulness varies.
---
- Ultra rare add-ons are not all that great with the only exception being rule no 2.
---
Shape 
---
Pros;
---
- Great stealth capabilities without sacrificing speed
---
- Ability to instantly down survivors with his power gives him amazing chase potential &amp; can allow for mass snowballing
---
- Has buffed stats for chasing. Low terror radius allows you to get closer to survivors &amp; an increased vault speed can help during a chase.
---
- Tier 3 is amazing for ending chases due to its extended lunge &amp; increase vault speed.
---
- Survivors may feel on edge with you during a chase so can be tempted to make mistakes or drop pallets early
---
- You really begin to feel like a killer with Myers as the ability to insta down survivors gives you a rush when you pull it off
---
- Overall has very strong add-ons. Amazing ultra-rare add-ons that alone can guarantee a win in a game.
---
- Standard killer otherwise with no power to slow the game down
---
- Getting out of tier 1 requires you to stalk people which can take some time.
---
- His perks are generally not great with the only good perk mainly being Save the best for last. Other 2 perks are not particularly strong &amp; have niche uses.
---
- Being tall hinders Myers ability for mind gaming against other survivors. Can be quite easy to see. 
---
- His heavy breathing can give him away for stealth. 
---
I would suggest Spirit. She is really fun to play as and her perks are cute. You can combine Enduring+Spirit Fury and Ruin+HG. The first combo could help a lot with trapper, doctor and billy and HG can help you down several people and stop gens from popping too fast. Also rancor can give you a free kill at the end of the game even if game was bad. 
---
I do a countdown starting at 10 from start of match or while Im running toward it. I swear they spawn in mid cleanse animation.
---
I would legit dc from existance if I saw you.
---
Agreed, I only play as killer or survive with friends to avoid toxicity. Ruins the game otherwise. 
---
Agreed! Probably the worse community I‚Äôve ever been apart of. 
---
I‚Äôve witnessed a 24 year old dude literally screaming at a 15 year old girl for playing junkrat on attack. 
---
Side note I‚Äôve only had 2 toxic experiences in DBD other than that people are cool for the most part.  
---
I do play on Xbox though so I‚Äôm sure most people are to lazy to send a message lol ! 
---
You‚Äôre gonna want Pig. HOWEVER, MM is much more fun and way stronger. His add ons are super fun and has so many different styles to play. The one downside is he strongly relies on other teachable perks from other DLC killers. You‚Äôre really gonna want MA and/or spirit fury plus Ruin to get maximum value out of him.
---
Pig is just another ‚Äúmeh‚Äù killer and it‚Äôs not such a big deal to not have those perks except for Ruin.
---
Objective is get out alive. Maaaybe get your team out aswell. Genrushers ignore people on hooks for gens regardless if there is camping. Dont cleanse dull totems but will still bitch about noed. Dont chest search since they bring in stuff to help gens. And get out asap. 
---
Actual gen rushers can end the match in under 8mins regardless of pressure. And marth88 proved they can do it with no perks or items.. so adding those to the mix and yes. They are real. 
---
But not every genrush is an actual genrush. It just gets used so much that it cheapens the meaning.
---
Better than another post complaining about lagon bed
---
I love black metal Jeff and they're so rare, I see one and I run towards him! Sadly this has never happened to me when I use him (but I do the little tbag thing as soon as I see other survivors) so might try to stop and see if they run.
---
Console has nothing fam :)
---
Can someone explain what the actual issue is with pewdiepie not having the most subs? 
---
It's because you never expect it.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôve been slightly confused about that as well 
---
What were they? I want to try them out, my friends and I love that game too
---
Why give them free satisfaction and reward for playing like garbage?
---
This is something killer mains seem to be mentally unable to understand. Nobody wants to play against a killer using garbage tactics because it‚Äôs NOT A FUN GAME. Screw that mess. DC and find a new game. Killer still gets a DC bonus and you can move on to a more fun game. But they don‚Äôt get the satisfaction of playing with you and ‚Äòfeeling superior‚Äô just because they know the ez (and very over rewarded in terms of BP‚Äôs) method of camping, tunneling, and slugging. 
---
Nope. Not doing that. 
---
Can you explain this logic to me? Is there a limit to how much Myers can stalk a single survivor in the whole match/during a single chase? 
---
I would give my left nut for a creepy hospital basement (ala more than a few Silent Hill games).
---
it's basically just a meme
---
But with the amount of time people invest into this it clearly is more than just a meme to some people. 
---
It is however a game flaw when it is almost impossible for lesser killers to be everywhere at once. No matter what you do, whether chase or patrolling, someone somewhere is on a gen and you cant stop it. 
---
What do you mean with more control?
---
honestly i'd buy spirit before either of those two, primarily to get spirit fury. SF + enduring should be considered meta for every single m1 killer, due to how powerful your potential for double hits becomes.
---
pig is a typical m1 killer, with a shitty power revolving around RNG. yes, it can slow the game down at times, but it isn't something that you can consistently rely on. it doesn't help with chases (spirit, or even clown), and she can't really snowball too well either (myers).
---
if you're dead set on either pig or myers, choose myers. he takes a lot of gamesense to utilize correctly though. knowing when to slug, when to pop EW3, and how to run tiles optimally are key to playing him. 
---
tl;dr buy spirit for optimal ROI, otherwise myers
---
Really glad I dodged a bullet and unsubbed when I was younger. 
---
The Game is my favorite map
---
If I see a Jigsaw Piece Offering I make it a priority. 
---
This is also quite an r/beetlejuicing moment
---
Some people don't want T series to have the most subs because it's a big corporation but for most people it's not that serious 
---
That's a bad argument. If anyone is bad, it's easy to loop them. This goes for a bad Legion and a bad Nurse as well as any bad Killer.
---
The issue with Legion is that stopping a chase within 35 seconds is easy unless you are braindead due to the bleed-out timer and addons.
---
yea but moonwalking is easy so almost everyone is good
---
Peekaboo myers is probably the scariest thing Ive ran into.. on Lery's Treatment too.
---
You‚Äôre transforming into a Claudette. Accept the change and be one with the plant.
---
Pewdiepie has been making videos for 9 years now, uploading every day and putting a lot of effort to get where he is. Meanwhile, a company who even pirated their first uploads, used bots and autosubscriptions, got closer and closer to his sub count. 
---
It's a meme, yes, because all in all Felix is still the number one solo creator with no company behind him, but it was a very fun thing to follow, people just joining in and doing some "sub to pewdiepie" stuff, MrBeast spending way too much money because why not, and it showed that a lot of creators on Youtube still care about being a community.
---
There's literally no issue with this, and unless people are meme-ing they will tell you the same, but it was just a fun thing to see and be part of.
---
Someone did a decent sized survey that said Spirit was the most widely mained killer, although the 35-39 age set was heavily Doctor.  Not sure how reliable that one is, either, but probably more than this :p
---
Yep, your evader points are actually double if the killer stops chasing you. So it's unfavorable to be focused the whole game because it awards the opposite lul.
---
&gt;What‚Äôs the most difficult element of the game?
---
There isn't one imo. If you think evading the killer is hard, consider this... All you have to do is let go of SHIFT for a few seconds and the chase will end. As a survivor you can win chases mid chase. 
---
so every reddit killer in their true form.
---
Lobbies full of Ash... can't wait. Gonna grind up my bloodpoints today
---
Sometimes you face-camp to make sure you get a kill. By this logic, its fine for a killer to DC as soon as someone uses the shack because "it ruins my fun". Not playing to make sure you have fun. If sitting in the basement and insidious camping you is hilarious and fun to me, too bad for you, oh well. Stick it out for the sake of your team so they don't have it happen too, move on to the next match. 
---
Are you saying dead by daylight is in any way shape or fork close to a competitive esport? Because you'd be hard pressed to convince me with how it is and has been. 
---
Can confirm I have done this and felt like a terrible person but it was worth it for the 1K
---
outplayed

;)
---
&gt;was just a fun thing to see and be a part of.
---
It‚Äôs still going on. It‚Äôs first to 100 million, after that it ends. PewDiePie is currently in the lead. 
---
YES PLEASE HNNNNG
---
I agree with you, when we talk about the old Pewdiepie. But now he is a very down-to-earth guy, and one of the most relatable online personalities in my opinion.
---
Were the games you left out more fair/fun?  Because 22 out of 27 games you had a negative experience, either being camped, tunneled, or had DCs in your match.  
---
Only after you wait 7 seconds
---
How about you lose some weight there, twiggy
---
I don‚Äôt like the people he associates with, nor do I like him all that much. Have a good one though, man.
---
You cursed creatures 
---
If I were you, I'd switch out Unbreakable for Tenacity. Often when I get downed at a window, I am able to crawl away before the killer gets to me and I have gotten up that way. I mean, if you were going to get up with unbreakable, you were also most likely going to get up with No Mither. Tenacity has the potential to create more scenarios where you can get up
---
Wait he got the lead again? 
---
IT AIN'T OVER BOYS.

They already had coins back then, shed be well aware of that concept. Hell, they even had written customer complaints.

About what I expected to be honest. Less Hillbillys than I come across. I'm going to do one of these as well since I'm the same rank as you it shall be interesting to compare.
---
I love that perk on every m1 killer

Lmao Nea

Right yeah, makes sense. Well, that's awkward.
---
Oof that one is pretty dirty but you can see it if you're running around the tower at the right angle.

I love em but the people that abuse we can aka agree deserve to be mori‚Äôd by nea

No but its a game where it feels like its worth the effort unlike f13

I like you can fight back but the devs cant do shit without copyrights breathing down their necks
---
Then they're sad people and should be ignored 
---
Don't swing at a survivor unless you are sure you will get the hit. You have a longer stun time if you blink and swing.
---
Try the plaid flannel add on, shows you exactly where you are blinking to.
---
Just watch this, youll do fine

What's the far right?

For adrenaline and borrowed time I just needed fillers so I used two perks that I see regularly on survivor

I'm not sure what I just watched.

But somehow, I'm offended.

Swap Myers with Bubba

Or you ultra safe (safe the best for last)

F13 character can do more than dbd character fight open door build car

She had someone guiding her around. I actually asked the same!

we were a few to post about that already
---
Let's be real here, Coal tower has awful totem spawns, they're never hidden EVER.
---
Totems either spawn in that predictable spot, in the open, at one of the L wall T walls in a corner people walk by, or in the actual coal tower behind the boxes but still in plain sight.
---
Aftercare would be far too strong if it didn't have the hooking drawback. There's a reason Bond only goes up to a certain distance.

Better come with quips voiced by Bruce Campbell or im gonna riot.

No.

Ffs, give me the damn Freddy buff already.

Treatment is okay but The game is fucking terrible
---
Not sure if I should be upset that there was only one Legion or that there was so much camping and tunneling.
---
She's already in the game though??  
---
See: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Kenneth_%22Jeffrey_Hawk%22_Chase

I don't know who my enemy is.  Noob survivors or tunneling/camping fucks. 
---
Jumpscare myers, ninja wraith, doctor, any killer with tinkerer, any killer with distressing and monitor &amp; abuse.
---
I watched his vid about Ash Williams in DBD... damn... dude is so Biased... always comparing DBD with F13... welp F13 is literally dead... they can't get new content anymore, the game is done, Biker should get over it.
---
I think, he's just an old angry man... if he hates something, he hates it with passion, if he loves something, he'll drag everything else into the dirt, that isn't the thing he loves.
---
In his case: F13 vs every other horror survival game. F13&gt;everthing else.
---
The anime source? Jojos bizzare adventure part 5
---
It‚Äôs great with Shirtless Myers when your running scratch mirror! 
---
It‚Äôs a staple in my Freddy build, i love it so much. 
---
Legion bad.
---
Thicc memes good

\*^screams ^in ^agonising ^forced ^uncloak\*

---
Stopped using Rancor and started using Bitter Murmur just because Obsessions are trash nowaday
---
Sure is.
---
It's also really great on Nurse.
---
There are plenty of bad apples but also alot of good. Being killer can be worse. They will throw crap at you but Ive had games where one salty survivor will go at me and the rest of the survivors defend me even after I killed them. Appreciate the good ones team with them, they are out there.
---
The DBD community is so well know for being toxic that the upcoming Trapper skin comes with a gas mask to protect him from the toxicity.
---
lMaO lEgIoN bAd HaHa Im *ORIGINAL* and **FUNNY!** LAUGH, motherfucker, LAUGH!

I‚Äôm pretty sure Dwight was no fighter.

I love indoor maps. Wraith, myers, piggy and doctor do great there.

Just tell folks in the pre-game lobby that you're running a chest build. 9/10 times I've had people leave the chests so that they have a chance of getting better stuff.
---
No YoU sToLe mY iDeA
---
I created a second steam account just to play with my friends who where new back then. Just enable family share on your PC and you can play DBD on that second account for free and you'll have a "new" DBD account that starts at 0. the game license is the same as on your main account though, so if you get banned on that secondary account your main account will be banned as well\^\^
---
April fool's is such a cringe date...
---
It's a real shame too, I was real hyped for the game. F13 was one of my favorite classic horror films growing up, and the game was such a let down :(
---
What? Have you played all of the walking dead games? Clem is more of a fighter then any of dbd's survivors.
---
yes yes yes yes yes
---
Distressing, monitor and abuse, calm add ons, game map offering
---
I absolutely love Clementine and she is my favorite game character to date. That being said, it would make me sad to have her in the game because that would mean she is separated from AJ and has to spend eternity getting hurt and killed :(
---
Instant boing in my pants. 
---
I'll be frank, getting blinded isn't fun and it always pisses me off a little. That being said, rev face camping over a game mechanic is just dumb. What makes this so much worse is that the Hillbilly has a unique perk that makes blinds much harder to achieve that he starts with when you play him. 
---
He saw you had a flashlight and chose to not bring Lightborn, more of a problem on his end than anything on yours OP.
---
Kinda like it with the exception of locking up generators. Isn't this kinda what Corrupt Intervention is trying to achieve? 
---
I've had it spawn there in quite a few matches so I always check there when I load into this map
---
Dude I had someone mid hooksave dc. The other 2 no where near me. Im like... NOW THEIR INTERNET DIES! Not like 2secs later. Rip
---
The meme is not being used correctly reeeeeee
---
r/lizardpeople
---
The guy is so full of shit. He talks about how people are closed minded and how you have to earn your wins, then turns around and says if you disagree you're part of the participation trophy generation and that killers should have all of their power so it "truly" represents them. Yeah I kinda don't feel like getting moried off the bat by a teleporting Freddy when I'm in the dream world. He is so closed minded it hurts to watch. Also F13 is better than DBD? Lmao that game died so badly not even being free for a month saved it! 
---
Pranked. :(
---
\*when you're openign a locker to get some more hatchets to ctatch survivors but there's already a survivor hiding in said closet\*
---
Been a bit out of the loop but getting back into dbd, why all the legion hate? I see things that say they suck but also that people dc when they see them. Why is that?
---
Would've been if there was sad music edited in and not just a bland gameplay recording.
---
Just let people pip again and itl be fine. Survivors just cant get into red ranks
---
So you have a video of this game? Or at least the moment? Cause all im seeing here is a still of you having the killer in your face, and a whole *damn lot* more salt text in this thread than such an incident deserves. I mean shit the title alone is the saltiest thing currently on this sub within the first 5 pages from frontpage. Yes i get how fucking annoying it is, but what the hell, if hes actually just doing this to piss of survivors congrats. Just struggle as long as you can, you increase your final payout by a bit, and if your team has 3 braincells in between them theyll go gens in the time, and the griefer wont have that much of a pleasant time afterwards. And once you are dead just leave and search another game. 
---
As far as judging this picture goes, for all i know you could have looped that guy for 4 gens at this point or bm'ed them for the entire game so far. 
---
Oh goddamn it meg
---
Oh , thanks for showing where it can spawn :)
---
Will make sure to check there.
---
Fuck. Lery‚Äôs and the Game are actually two of my favourites, and I really like indoor maps and wish we could get some more of them. Then again I do main Myers so that kinda explains a couple of things.
---
The most redik one I had was when I was running empathy and I was watching this Claudette across the map who was crouching around going in and out of lockers. WHILE i was being chased. I watched her do this during my long chase and another survivor was near her on a gen but she just kept hiding. I got hooked. The whole team left me till I was almost dead on my first hook.
---
So When I got rescued and chased. I led him to the Claudette, who guess what was still in that locker! For 4mins of the game she was doing this.
---
You know how it is in their shoes gameplay wise. 
---
That comment hurts my soul
---
I think I just jizzed reading that.
---

I get it, legion bad. But seriously? We're going so low that we're insulting the player now. We should be yelling at the fucking devs for not addressing the issue yet (And since we know it'll be 2 years until they do)
---
Dammit that's the second time I've fallen for a game prank. First it was with the Mortal Kombat 11 release date and then this. Well played.
---
Agitation would help that second build lol. If you wanna be a basement camper. 
---
What happens when a pallet gets dropped on your face.
---
Oh They're teabags lol I thought they were tombstones or something 
---
Atleast i can admit unlike you
---
Id be able to run killer through 5 gens..... IF MY TEAM DID GENS! 
---
It does suck when I have no issue running from the killer and looping them. But then I touch a gen and 3 of them go down across the map. Like wtf. Guuuueeesss Ill get hatch
---
Of course they are. Survivors dont have any special attraction to shitty people. There is still a difference though, which makes survivor toxicity the more common one. First, you always have 4 to them. So if you have shitty people equally spread across both sides, your chance to get a shitty one in your room is still four times higher with the survivor side. Two, the killer has to be there for the entire game. If you are a dickhead and 4k'ed them and now want to belittle them in chat, good chance that at best youll only catch the last guy in the first place. Meanwhile, the killer is guaranteed in the endgame chat. Best they can do is to instantly spam on the leave button, and then miss out on any chance at conversation, also the decent one. Third, basic group dynamic. Just look up how group dynamics and agressive behaviour/bullying works if you care, this one is way too much to bother writing here.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really make a difference dude.
---
Okay, but like Save the Best for Last is actually good though.
---
I mean, if survivors aren't going to take the effort to use the ingame methods to punish camping then this is a bit of a "No shit sherlock" moment.
---
If 2-3 gens were popped everytime a killer fully face camped it wouldn't be as prevalent as we see in the game. 
---
Instead we get the equivalent of that one kid who played Mortal Kombat by spamming a single move, and instead of learning to dodge or block it, you just keep eating to the face all the while demanding that they stop doing that move.
---
As long as it works more often than it fails, camping will never stop. And since a survivor d/cing only makes camping stronger and seem more appealing, it's just feeding into the problem
---
What would you suggest to fix their ability?
---
who the fuck are you i wanna be friends with you
---
Great list! I like most of your suggestions, and I really like some of them.
---
I looove your proposed Detective's Hunch changes. I'd love the extra info it gives, without making it all-knowing (activates on survivor unhook-could be DH or MYC, for example). Side effect of buffing SWF squads even more - one person runs it and relays the info to the rest. But it'd be worth it, IMO.
---
WGLF fucking haunts me with its existence - I don't want to run a perk that does literally nothing, but I don't like missing out on BPs either. I think your idea is perfect, and would actually give it a unique flair, and make it an alternative to Borrowed Time - your mates run away, you stay behind to protect them, as a David King should. But I come to think, maybe another perk should get its BP bonus instead?
---
Give it to No Mither...and make it a 50-100% on all categories from the start. Make the weakest perk in the game be a conscious choice for a bigger challenge, and greater rewards! 
---
But there are things in your post that I disagree with:  
---
-any scratchmark suggestions: seeing scratchmarks is a killer-only thing, survivors don't get to have it.  
---
-No One Left Behind: with BT, it sounds really cancerous. Imagine an SWF stack that all runs those. Also, how does Endurance work if you're healthy?  
---
-Balanced Landing: don't think it needs any buffs, really.  
---
That about sums it up - rest of your points I have no issues with, and support wholeheartedly. Now I want to stay in this thread and keep believing that the devs will implement any of this.
---
Thats a risky meme to post
---
Why should someone be forced to waste their time doing something completely unfun? Isn't that the point of video games. I'm not saying, oh we should get to farm every match. But we shouldn't get face camped for absolutely nothing,  or at the beggining of a match. 
---
Everyone is like oh what happened to deserve this? Um, let's see I ran from her,  threw a pallet at her,  popped 1 and a half of the gens done,  saved 3 team mates and still got camped. I guess I got face camped for not being a immersed noob. Lol. 
---
I know you want me to say oh yeah I t bagged at every pallet and they camped me,  but NO that is not what happened at all. 
---
I'm aloud to rant just as much as everyone else,  and it's annoying to people say "yeah I camped and slugged him every time his team mate farmed him, so I should get points if he dcs for standing in his face RUINING the game for him." 
---
That's fine to not care about my fun,  and obviously I did take my L because I'm not dcing when I've done everything up until this point. 
---
My post is more about the toxic killers who just face camp one person all game,  for what? 
---
I don't go in a match like hmmm,  I wonder how I can make this super unfun for the killer? Obviously my job is to attempt to escape,  and honestly I could give a shit less if I do. I actually enjoy a good match,  I don't even care to be tunneled because 98% of the time I'm giving a good ass chase. I just wanna be able to do something besides hang on a hook in match. 
---
Basically if you think camping is okay,  move along and don't bitch when 4 people DC in your face,  take you "L" and move on. 
---
Idk, I like legion both as surv and playing, it compleetly change how you chase and get chased, ALMOST every other killer has the same way of chasing. 
---
If you don't know the artist don't post it. Consciously or not - you posted it knowing you would get internet points for it. Your getting rewarded for the creators hard work. Thank god its credited for you so the artist can get the credit.
---
Just seeing the title got my heart racing &amp; my palms sweaty. This is something I would expect to see unironically in the dbd steam forums.
---
I‚Äôm rank 4-5 and games are impossible to find, and I usually only play at night (feels dead at night on Xbox.) Half the time I queue with a rank 10 just to find games. 
---
Might you perchance have some insight on how to play Plague in the Meat Plant? Unless survs troll I can't do anything on it.
---
Although I agree there should be another reduce to the blood web or grind in general I don't know if this would be the way to do it. Although I'd have no problem if the devs chose to do it. 
---
Yeah I'm not saying they're without their faults, but they will help the op learn the game from both perspectives. 
---
100% was. Lol. 
---
I'm totally a human! And everyone is my friend unless proven otherwise!
---
cursed image
---
Just google it.
---
Then why are they all crying all over reddit for the chase points,  hook points,  and sacrifice points that they lost? I play killer as well,  and you do get a quitter bonus. 
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.

I hate it as a survivor because I always think my team is hiding in lockers.

How dare you speak about Michael that way!
---
We'll make it so that you get 10 points for 100% struggle and I get 1000 points for 100% struggle.
---
I actually don't mind playing Lery's as a Huntress, the tightness of the map helps compensate for low movement speed and there's a lot of windows for survs to get animation locked in. 
---
There needs to be another way to remove the handcuffs. Otherwise I like the concept.
---
Legion gud killr

Hard to see the last one but they have the downed status.

---
i hate this day so much
---
Almost every time is that moment for me. The worst was when I had a daily to just escape but im like nah the whole teams still here ill go help save. They left me. My sacrifice was in vaaaaaain!.
---
However I had the best one that was kinda a first. The billy had a tough time all game and the most trouble catching me. He commited time to me allowing alot of gens to get done. But he had no issue downing the rest. Well gens got done he hooked a survivor I saved eairler then facecamped. I saw him revving the chainsaw and waited, he decided to chainsaw the hooked survivor so I ran in and he yanked me off(which was my plan) my plan was for the other survivors got the save while I wiggled off his shoulder(he stayed near hooked survivor hitting people. They didnt save!
---
 So after I wiggled off I used the stun time to hook save then blocked the hit to allow the unhooked guy to run to the nearby exit. 
---
It was a bitter sweet moment as they were at the gate and looked back at me. Post game chat was all "You should have saved yourself!" And being called a hero and mvp. 
---
Be the hero.. die like a legend. Get your full stacks of wglf
---
1 person is left. One of our team mates dc'd her first hook,  and she camped the other person as well that's dead. My other team mate attempted to save me,  instead of hatch camping,  and got pulled off.
---
I shouldn't be forced to die my first hook,  because a killer wants to be a dick. It's annoying. That's the whole points,  everyone keeps assuming I'm a constant DC person,  when I'm actually not. Lol. I'm just shining some light on situations that make people want too.
---
I did later! This was the only shot I had that was the full cosplay available to me. 
---
Amanda or Spirit. Both are best girls
---
Not their fault. They are in a massive lawsuit and can't do anything. They have some stuff ready that is just sitting there because they can't add anything.

My bother introduced me to F13 one day and I kinda liked it, but I always felt something was missing.
---
Until DBD went free on PS Store for PS+ and I downloaded just to see how it was. And man, instantly loved it.
---
My brother still plays F13 and he didn‚Äôt like DBD, he said it‚Äôs to complex haha. But that‚Äôs the thing, F13 is too simple. It‚Äôs always the same, find the pieces, fix the vehicle or telephone and escape. Doesn‚Äôt change much. 
---
What I love in DBD is that. You get into a match without knowing what is the killer, they are all unique and have very different counters. And there‚Äôs cases where it‚Äôs Myers, but is it Mirror Myers? Does he have Tuft of hair or Judith‚Äôs? The same killer mechanics changes so much depending on the add-ons and I freaking love that aspect
---
I love Clem but I don‚Äôt want her in dbd lore wise it would mean she was taken by the entity to be tortured and killed endlessly, it would  mean Aj lost her and who knows how the poor boy would take it, but above all else she is a fighter and she would fight back in the entity‚Äôs realm.
---
- also she had a hard life she deserves to be happy 
---
Shockingly I've never had problems with toxicity in this game 
---
Lol 
---
So,  if you don't enjoy face camping you should quit playing? Lmfao. That's a GREAT logic. I guess all the killers bitching who got ds nerfed or wanna make gens take longer or hate swf groups should just "quit then huh? 
---
Guess if you don't like that people DC don't play,  when there is a in game leave match mechanic. 
---
And I love it! 
---
Definitely don‚Äôt play Legion but go off I guess. 
---
This is some beautiful April fools material. 
---
I hope.
---
I would buy this DLC 10 times 
---
Im gonna uninstall. :)
---
Myers is a sociopathic murderer with no qualms about using whatever means he can to murder people.
---
Now i want to see baby nurse and baby pig
---
i have 0 idea what that word means 
---
Lol salty killer
---
Yes fucking please.
---
Yes brooooo this needs to happen atleast I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this
---
1. It doesn't make him bad by itself, but coupled with the fact every killer is better is just makes it worse. And stall doesn't really help when they invalidate your power so easily. 
---
8.2 a good spirit is guaranteed either a hit, a pallet drop, or putting the survivor in a bad position. She is the hardest character to use in the game but one of the most rewarding. Any time a pallet drops is good for any killer, not just freddy. She has better stall then freddy because she can get quick hooks. She does not need deadzones to do well, just mindgames.
---
1. Fair enough
---
??? I've done it and seen it happen against me. Its easier then you think. No idea who Jen or Zubat is so no comment on that. Weaknesses do not make killers bad, you are right, but Freddy's strengths do not make up for his weaknesses, that's why he is bad.
---
Well you are right about that. They have more. 
---
I was the survivor (the last one) and the killer was a normal plague, without OP or annoying perks  
---
I think he's just saying that a lot of the fun in DBD can be trying to win, and compete against other players.
---
F13 is just a big hot box of nonsense where the rules don't matter and nothing makes sense. You put it on when you're drunk and want to watch a teen throw himself through a closed window for no reason.

Her special perk would be:
---
Why Lee and not me?!
---
If a survivor gets morried infront of your eyes u get healed by one health state and get a sprint burst for 3s. Only works once.
---
:P
---
Clearly a mistake that they have never thought to correct.

Lee would fit better lore wise I feel. Clem leaves, he's expecting to die and become a walker, then next thing he know he's leaned up against a locker like Bill had been.

You can get exactly that in f13. And it's a lot more fun than you guys are making it out to be. It's as fun as you make it. If you're ultra competitive you know that dbd isn't that at all. It's not balanced, stable or even tested well. At least Friday the thirteenth didn't put on a facade of something it wasn't through its community. 
---
Thanks I love it
---
If you think about it, it's possibly less about getting actual lines from Bruce and more about his involvement creating a buzz. Legitimising it. You pay Bruce to voice a few grunts and screams, get him to do a publicity video and to tweet about the game, and a lot of Ash v Evil Dead fans are brought in, even if the voicework itself is kind of a 'joke'.
---
Yesterday I unhooked with BT a David that were being camped and he dead harded the first hit making the timer run out and he got downed the next hit. 
---
Don‚Äôt you dare crush my dreams. Don‚Äôt you do it.
---
You got my vote!
---
Not really no. While a Friday the 13th DLC/Chapter could be cool, it's already its own game. And even if they DID have a Tommy Jarvis DLC, he wouldn't be armed with a shotgun, unique perks yes, but a shotgun would be OP, everyone would use it as a perk or play him. 
---
That's actually smart, I'll give that a go.
---
Not bad
---
People hate legion mostly because they remove the skill component from both sides. Survivors cant live despite how well they do, and a bad legion player will down someone in about the same amount of time as a good legion.
---
It's not really about how good or bad he is; nurse, Billy, spirit etc are all way better. He's just not designed well mechanically. He ignores all game mechanics and just downs you.
---
that what you said to me also aplies to you :)
---
This post hurts me. Fuck that map, fuck the flashlight 
---
I don't remember. But that's what I heard awhile back
---
I added this same smile to this pic ages ago, I was wondering if this was a cropped version of my image also. 
---
100% Legion, his power is to make survivors DC within 30 seconds, worth it
---
rookie's luck is basically Slippery meat but worse
---
Sadly yup, only real difference is one was ridiculously easy to pull off the other was pretty well pixel perfect, or frame perfect? Idk which. 
---
Promise me a copy then if this is ever released 
---
Legion apparently is op on console. It's really good on PC too, but even more so on console. Plague right now feels really underwhelming. Plus legions perks are beneficial for Huntress if you're looking at it from a teachable perk perspective too.
---
I hate any map with corn unless I am playing the Pig because sneaking up on generators from the corn is hilarious fun. 
---
I‚Äôm aware but nearly every release has had the most issues caused via the addition of the killer. 
---
Ya so if you honestly compare them since the wraiths never got banned it would be pretty dumb if devs banned ppl for doing this since it does take some skill to do and rare as fuck
---
The saddest part about this is that it‚Äôs not really wrong. That‚Äôs disgusting. 
---
I think that there should be 2 layers of shrine. Like after you buy one another one pops up. I'm stacked for irridecent shards, but don't wanna spend it on crappy shrine perks when they're always the garbage ones. 
---
I went against a Legion with double blade add ons. I  put used a stopwatch the mend timer. It takes 2 minutes to mend yourself. Why devs? 
---
lol wat?
---
I got f13 way before dbd, but I still think dbd is a better game. However there were many things I really enjoyed in f13, for example, the fact that you could talk to every other player, including Jason. It was really fun most of the time and you got to fuck around and laugh with other people. It's a shame that's it's dead now.
---
Sold take my money.
---
no. With the bonus from my perks + offering it can gives me +40K BP in one game. That's an average
---
Add a toaster and a bathtub and your set 
---
I‚Äôve seen that happen and while funny it‚Äôs definitely not okay for the game
---
Not everyone got the time :\
---
M&amp;A is especially good with Red Paint Brush. It also has a secondary benefit of reading auras further than 16m instead of 24m. A good perk.
---
Discordance is great to start sleeping people quickly. Another good perk.
---
BBQ has BP gains. The aura reading can be nice for finding people to sleep, but optimumly you'd have the survivors asleep. It's stayed in my builds cause of BP.
---
Ruim can help stall, but is kinda tricky to keep.
---
Good perks are: 
---
Huntress Lulaby so they regress gens more after failed skill checks, or waking up due to failed skill checks. It is a hex perk however.
---
Overcharge actually isn't bad. Not fantastic, but survivors will willingly regress the gens to wake up. Combined with Huntress Lulaby that's an 11% gen regression on failed OC skill checks.
---
PGTW isn't bad on Freddy. Heck, a gen regression Freddy is a totally viable build. Hook someone, and kick a gen. That gen will regress at least 36% if PGTW is used with OC and Huntress Lulaby. A gimmick build that would need double Blocks, but it is surprisingly effective.
---
MYC and DH are also good choices. You don't camp with the worst camper in the game. Plus if the rescuer is asleep, you track them and down them. DH can be great, but is a hex perk.
---
Knockout / The Third Seal is also good for slugging, as Freddy has a reverse Deerstalker / 24 meter Whispers naturally. Warning as being healed from dying does wake them up. Third Seal is a hex perk, though.
---
Sloppy Butcher is never a bad choice. Is also slows the survivors down even more while healing in the dream world. 
---
Haunted Grounds makes a gimmicky build with TOTH. They attempt to cleanse a totem, and you go over there. You let them, and sleep them. Haunted Grounds? BOOM. 1 hit down.
---
TOTH isn't that bad on it's own in my opinion. It tells you when a survivor is cleansing a totem, so you can go sleep them. 
---
Endgame perks like Blood Warden, Remember Me, Rancor, and NOED also work. STBFL is also a good one, as they don't expect you to have it I find.
---
Honestly any build can work with Freddy.
---
Oh man, I always go running back! Then if and when I die, I always vow to never try to save anyone again. But I always do. HAH. Gotta be the hero.  
---
Looks like she DCed at the end. Dunno if it's what caused it or vice versa. 
---
I really like it, I'm planning a build with Flip Flop, Boil Over, Tenacity, and Unbreakable when Ash comes out. It's gonna be pretty radical.
---
I basically said it's strong, not OP. However it gets old seeing it every single game.
---
If i was in denial I'd have a different opinion by. now since I've played since beta. There's no denying swf is strong, but it's not as big of a gap from solo as people are claiming. 
---
an unexpected response, but a welcome one
---
That's going to be very strong, if you record the results or anything please let me see! c:
---
Spirit does require some knowledge of how to play properly, but I can‚Äôt see her being much harder than PC. Also good to have for spirit fury. She can be extremely fun to play once you learn her because of the jump scares and map coverage but takes a lot of patience to learn. Out of the killers mentioned I feel she has the most useful teachables in the long run .    
---
    
---
Legion is fun to play but doesn‚Äôt have much for mind gaming tactics, so you‚Äôre reliant I feel on awareness and brute force. Can be tricky to use also against seasoned players who know how she operates, aside from that alright to use and one of my more favourite killer models. Teachables I feel Discordance is the most useful long term, however Mad and Iron are good for builds.    
---
Plague is quite strong and as of right now a higher tier killer. Teachables don‚Äôt offer much for endgame but Corrupt and Infectious are useful to get momentum rolling at the start. All around one of the better choices for a mid level player, however she can still be countered by good players and teamwork. Regardless an easy killer to pick up and get the hang of.    
---
Clown I got purely for bamboozle. Teachables are hit and miss besides that I personally feel so not crucial. Another good killer for entry level killers for being able to counter pallet play, but that is short lived against solid teamwork and seasoned players. Not my first choice out of the mentioned obviously but a fun killer to have and play regardless. Plus he can wiggle dance.    
---
It comes down to your play style (serious tactics vs being able to fool around), how you‚Äôre most comfortable playing, and which choice you feel is has the most to offer in the long run. All still great additions in their own regard IMO.
---
Well ranks are messed up. A lot of formally red tier killers will now appear around those ranks just because of how many hours you need to put in to get to red rank now.
---
So its gonna be a Billyfest.
---
you were trying to cross the border right?  walked right into that imperial ambush, same as us, and that horse thief over there. 
---
I like playing stealth killers, so I love indoor maps
---
Sometimes your lucky if you get that 
---
Dead by Spaghetti sauce with guacamole 
---
Taking nea from the survivor roster and putting her in the killer roster
---
I somehow think its the devs way of making matches last longer, which isnt exactly fun in most cases.  Should allow more than one forced play style.  If i want to be super altruistic, thats fine...if i want to do gens and escape, I should not be penalized for doing the main objective for survivors.  At this rate, might as well just remove gens/exits and make it a damn death match. 
---
So you like Julie then?
---
With a spider leg growing from her back
---
Could you at least make the text on the white clothes black? 
---
Dedicated servers and console optimization.
---
I actually alternate between wraith, pig and legion more recently, while learning nurse too
---
When I want a laid back, fun game I always go my favourite bing bong boi though, and actually use his movement speed instead of defending hooks
---
Make the arms more spider-y but other than that it looks cool. Maybe have a diamond custom cut to look like the shroud of union
---
If you're using distressing and monitor together, you're doing it *wrong*. 
---
Or when they Tbag you, but you have an infinite tombstone and they call you a campper and what not after the game
---
i think the purple are ranks are the best one in my opinion, i can actually manage to have fun playing both killer and survivor without anyone being salty or toxic (i mean, in most of my games, idk about other players)
---
Doesn't matter where i am i still get matched with the Martians
---
I thought this game was a loading simulator. I mean I bought the game just to wait at the loading screen.
---
Happens. I messed up there
---
My brother did the same thing! And it got me into the game too. Now I‚Äôm obsessed with this awful addictive game;_; 
---
Also I‚Äôve played f13, it‚Äôs actually fun but It‚Äôs not nearly as good as dbd. 
---
Looks like sarcasm to me.
---
You bring up an interesting point, which is what I think their intention was as well. On the killer side it‚Äôs BS as well, especially if you use late game killers who can‚Äôt defend gens as well as say hillbilly 
---
Half the time now its because someone else is running d strike
---
I had a match yesterday where I was the obsession, and I wasn't running any obsession perks. I was paranoid the whole game. After a while I assumed they had Save the Best for Last, but they weren't really ignoring me any more than anyone else, so I thought maybe they weren't super worried about getting stacks. I got to the end of the match and they weren't running any obsession perks either. Weird glitch I guess. 
---
I‚Äôd love that, very fitting of a Horror Game too. The indoor maps are scary enough and adding a sort of haunted theme would be crazy 
---
It‚Äôs definitely a sleeper op perk it‚Äôs so annoying when I pick up a survivor running it. 
---
Who the hell is sleeved_biker?
---
Leatherface probably a must for bbq and chili teachable 
---
You can thank jackass ‚ÄúFog whisperers‚Äù for this system. No game should let streamers have such a strong influence unless it‚Äôs a last ditch effort. Especially in a game where a majority play one side, due to it being a game that‚Äôs cohesive to talking to your audience while playing. 
---
Sure, there were some pretty underwhelming rank one survivors. It happens in every game. However, is it more enjoyable to be paired with perennial rank 16s when you used to be rank 1, and the killer is a rank 6?  Even with the old ranks, at least you know while your teammates wouldn‚Äôt be necessarily the best, they‚Äôd still be competent. A lot less one hooks and d/c‚Äôs back then.  
---
Really if everyone was in voice chat it became a pseudo roleplay game that made me laugh my ass off.  Being Chad in a building along with a girl who I "promised to protect from Jason", Jason came up and started to smash windows all around me.  Needless to say, I did the most chad thing I could do and offered her up in exchange for my life since she was hiding in a closet or under a bed and I wasn't.  Hearing her go "You mother fucker!" As I jumped out of a closed window and Jason just went into the house for her while I ran off was probably the most Chad thing I could do.
---
And then I met up with another fellow Chad where we commented on how the other chad's hair was "slightly worse then mine, but still nice", and then fixed the boat and rode off into the sunset together.
---
I have a lot of hilarious memories of the game but as a game dbd is better, f13 can be a hilarious game if nobody is actually trying to take it seriously.
---
And please for the love of God, increase the BP cap. 
---
I'd like to see BP cap increases every time your devotion goes up.
---
A survivor was using an obsession perk then
---
that was solved they're just using it as an excuse
---
Legion doc bubba
---
*Elephant noise*
---
This except I'm usually the one getting hooked 
---
Doc is free and I already have buba, so im gonna probably get legion plus I personally find him too op and never won against him, any tips on how to counter him as a survivor XD
---
It's a spite thing. 
---
Oh wow you're right. Two people dc'd so it may have been one of them. It's pretty rare that the obsession goes to a random, even though it's possible, so I didn't think of it.
---
An unfortunate rite of passage.
---
I'm afraid of the Trapper. This montage leveled my anxiety to a whole new level.
---
Love running the killer around for 3-4 gens and getting face camped unhooked ds him then sailing off into the sunset 10/10 would do again (I have to cause black pip)
---
This is so sad
---
Doesnt matter dont do that shit and i play both killer and survivor
---
I looked it up and it says they are still settling things. Making sure everyone gets the share.
---
Awwww, don't be afraid, I always "hug" survivors after they get trapped ;)
---
I spent over half a year playing F13. Felt like a waste of time as the game gradually got worse and worse with each update.
---
While you can still have fun with the game, people are out of their mind if they say the game is in any way good, or even better than DBD.
---
The game is garbage with a hint of semen atm
---
They couldn‚Äôt add new content to the game during the lawsuit, but they absolutely could have fixed how glitched the game was, or work on fixing all the exploits and cheating.  They haven‚Äôt done that.  But they did release an ultimate edition of the game to make more money, so there‚Äôs that.  It‚Äôs just scummy.
---
And here I am, playing MM at rank 15 with 1to3 DC per game
---
Do killers just poop on the floor and the entity magics it away 
---
As a killer main I find this highly disturbing and disgusting. Please dont do this ever...
---
So glad I finally made the switch to PC. It's been night and day when it comes to matchmaking. 
---
Essentially, time from time you have to drop a chase in order to apply some map pressure as every killer
---
~~Chao~~ *Killer Garden* spinoff game confirmed.
---
The one match I had a totem there it was never found. Such a good spot. There needs to be more totem spawns like that on all maps. 
---
hey if you ever want to SWF or just talk about game mechanics you're unsure about, you can DM me for my discord and ill be happy to play or talk about the game with you :)!
---
you don't have to be dead for the entity to get you
---
Yeah, it doesn't happen often haha and I always feel like they hate my for taking their obsession icon when it does happen lol
---
I agree. F13 was a lot of fun for fucking around 
---
Oh boy. 
---
Did anyone notice he is forcing his voice to sound more 'scary' or something?
---
Here he uses his normal voice: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDf8L8eEf7Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDf8L8eEf7Q) 
---
And here he forces his voice:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30fDbximeig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30fDbximeig) 
---
Also is he saying DBD destroyed horror characters like Freddy, Myers and Bubba...
---
Yep, when I saw that totem I first thought it's bugged but then I saw a small path at the side that led to the Hex.
---
I‚Äôm out this bitch 
---
STBFL and Distressing are good on specific killers
---
This pleases me greatly.
---
I want to know why I can't break the pallets before the survivors pull them down. Kind of makes my killer look like an idiot after he stubs his toe on the 5th one and still doesn't have the brains to destroy them beforehand. 
---
Well hes a narc, so you cant expect too much from the guy...
---
I think purple/green ranks are right in the middle of tryhards and noobs. 
---
I just want them to fix the weird obsession thing with DS. Ever since the change in all my games with someone having DS, it guarantees them NOT being the obsession and placing it on someone else who doesn't even have an obsession perk.
---
Who would be the killer?
---
BP grind is a grind no matter when you do it. So what if I what to save up, or if I'd rather chip away at it over time. It's the same time spent regardless. I see no harm in 200k increases for each devotion level.
---
I like the saw map

You tell me that I think only my opinion matters. 
---
Then you give me yours. Really seems like a bit of a waste.
---
Nice try though. 
---
I don't even have doctor.
---
she‚Äôs missing a leg tho 
---
Wait can you explain more please? That sounds pretty interesting 
---
Holly fuck I can‚Äôt unhear it

It has been confirmed he will actually have voice lines, one way or another.it *has* also been confirmed he will say Groovy. Watched dev stream.
---
That guy's a dumbfuck idiot. He's the definition of a poser. Pretends to be this hard ass, and calls people "little bitch" but I gaurantee you he's a punk.
---
He‚Äôs an asshole

I always scare my friends with Quentin. We need that terror radius asap! They really do jump at Quentin though lol
---
*when you tell your friend not to unhook you because leatherface is facecamping but they do it anyway and get downed"
---
ATOADASO! I FUCKING ATOADASO
---
your average should be around 23/24k if you want to consistantly hit r1 since that means you get full score on almost anything.. if you want to be ranked among the rank 1s you have to almost double pip on average 
---
Whoever downvoted you is an uncultured swine.

Never underestimate an angry Noodle! üêç
---
Bitch all you want. BHVR is awesome 
---
OKEY SO AFTER A SECOND THOUGHT, I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BRING CLEMENTINE TO THIS BRUTAL TOXIC WORLD. 
---
I believe that no one would ever hurt her. NO ONE.
---
So as a result, she would escape every game.
---
Peace
---
And then we see a mass decrease in survivors üòÇ
---
How did it go?
---
Np üôÇ See you in the fog fellow Ps4 gamer!
---
Virtual Cabin was very fun. I remember trying to solve everything with my friends. It was really enjoyable. I dont even think Gun/illfonic even made it either which makes the game even more hilariously sad.
---
Seeing the F13 devs be smug on twitter is just rage fuel. What a waste of potential
---
It does sound scary. 
---
Distressing with Monitor and Abuse and Dead Rabbit add on Myers is fun.
---
the game is my favorite map. please bite me.
---
I use Agitation with Iron Grasp and Mad Grit altogether. Whenever someone uses Boil Over, I just turn left or right while walking to a hook and i get there in no time. Most generally they stop struggling when they realize I use it to my advantage
---
Get out..... NOW
---
It was probably fuckin Cory and Jacob! 
---
Fuckin dumb dumbs.
---
Omg I remember Deathgarden lmao. Did that even make it to official release?
---
That's pretty funny. I had one game where one person was playing as Lachappa and he basically became a god to everyone else. Every survivors only goal became to make sure he gets out alive, the rest didn't matter. I don't remember any specific details of what we said, but it was a hilarious round.
---
I love dbd, but I kinda miss the funny fucking around in f13. I tried playing it again a few weeks ago, but no one was talking. Even when I tried to start a conversation, I got no reply. It's a shame, had a lot of fun moments in f13
---
The 1 player puzzle glitch thing was really good
---
Haha, mate you need to swallow your pride on this subject, you're talking to someone who works on PCs all day. Man you really can't accept the fact you're wrong huh? I mean I get it, I don't like being wrong either, but this, I'd rate you around 4th most stubborn person I've had a discussion with online.
---
Tell you what, if you want some proof, why don't you look up 'DBD crashes when game starts' or something to that effect, if you knew a lickety split about PCs you'd know that a PC crashing in a specific game in a very specific area of it is not the PCs fault.

Solo survivor teammates starter pack
---
- sprint burst
---
- urban evasion
---
- self cares in a corner
---
- throws down shack pallet instantly
---
- refuses to do anything other than heal when injured
---
- lasts 3-5 seconds in a chase but manages to throw down 4 pallets in that time.
---
If you force quit your program, its as if you had not played the game at all. You loose your offering , but keep your items and do not depip. This will look like a disconnect to the rest of the players. 
---
The guy above you literally said that there was something wrong with people who play legion. It‚Äôs not funny it‚Äôs just distasteful. 
---
This meme hurts
---
Virtual Cabin was cool and they did great with it. Credit where it is due, my friend and I had fun with that.
---
I don't think so. It died extremely fast.
---
I am very aroused
---
I always liked the variety that F13 offered. Different types of survival, interesting ways of fighting back, maps with a little more personality and of course the ability to potentially even kill Jason.... But that game died a terrible death. I still play it occasionally but ONLY if I'm playing with a group of friends. It has too much of a "let's all just fuck around" vibe to it otherwise.
---
DBD offers consistent updates and maintenance (as far as I've seen so far) and now with Ash's arrival.... I think it's fair to say which is the groovier game!
---
Ppl disliking this are pussies, he‚Äôs absolutely right. Do you want them to give you everything all at once so you can be burnt out in a week or two?? Come on now, the game needs some type of progression.
---
Just loop a killer that moves much more faster than you, vaults windows fast, can vault over pallets, no cooldown for missing an attack, insane long lunge range that puts you on a timer where you will eventually go down if they want you to! 
---
My bad, thought u had replied to me.
---
god yes this is required my queen !!!
---
not my feelings AKKDKD
---
Why rework such a high skilled killer whom's power is fun and balanced on both sides? üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
---
An April fools joke on an April fools joke. Well done.
---
Use clapper. Bing bong behind wall gen is worked on. Come around corner and it don't matter care she out. 
---
Short blinks are your friend
---
One time I suggested something similar and got downvoted to shit lol. Maybe I didn't word it right.
---
Yea they're adding Mettle of Man so he takes four hits to kill somebody instead of three in exchange for a non dream state wall hack after/if they manage to get away and heal. In other words Freddy is getting even worse. You're welcome. 
---
I hear this title. It's.... Disturbing
---
Happy mic day
---
The Legion is only a 110% speed killer. Like I said, you can't avoid a down, but you can delay it. If your teamates are doing their job, and the Legion is targeting you, you should have a chance. If the Legion is good and targets multiple players, then there is almost nothing you can do. But let me just say, not all Legions are good. Some of them, you can make them mindgame themselves pretty hard. 
---
Sounds like a terrible perk, I almost never see people get morried
---
April fools we actually made the game better....suprise!
---
The Curse of Thorn is actually getting Coldwind all the time as Michael and never getting any Lerys offerings in your bloodweb.  
---
I love doing this to my friend
---
...Good Legions tunnel because splitting the pressure takes too long and buys you almost no time at all. What are you even talking about?
---
Even doctor with distressing?
---
Yeah, it is fairly boring.  It just doesn‚Äôt have that fast intensity of most DBD matches.
---
Not gonna lie, I've considered this several times. Might just wait for a discount to get it
---
You're gonna get downvoted, but i completely agree. The issue with constant DC'ing is that its the only recourse survivors have to escape a bullshit situation.
---
Its a waste of time getting camped on hook, getting tunneled immediately after, getting slugged so a greedy killer can deny hatch and 4k, not to mention playing against the same killer and broken add ons over and over. 
---
Its bullshit that survivors are expected to sit on hook for 2 min because toxic killer cant be bothered to actually play the game. 
---
You cant FORCE people to play against unfun b.s. 
---
I was loopin a Legion for around about 60 seconds, and we had already complete 2 gens, and this bought us time enough to get 2 more gens. Because he only tunneled me, all my other guys were able to complete gens. The point og legion is to injure everyone, but since he didn't, 3 of us made it out. 
---
Is this real or just a clever post to pull off a pun?
---
*spits water*
---
Well, I am heavily biased because both Spirit and Plague are my personal choices for Killers from both a power standpoint as well as a visual and artistic one. But, yes, both do have that proper satisfying feeling when you do well with them and you understand their power, Spirit just takes more effort to reach that stage.
---
trapper or wraith = bank
---
Black box is god if you are trying to get obsession at the beginning of the game for dying light or my favorite remember me.
---
I play end game F reddy so I basically o have no perks till the end of the game and sometimes I don't get their
---
I use 
---
NOED-All survivors get the exposed status effect after the last generator is completed
---
Remember me- gain a token every time the obsession is hit and each token adds 5 seconds into the opening of the exit gate with a maximum of 30 seconds.
---
Blood warden- if a survivor is hooked after the exit gate is opened, the exit gate is blocked off for a maximum of 60 seconds
---
The last perk is usually random,any suggestions.
---
It still baffles me that people have to be so elitist about a fucking game. I have less anger when I play F13 but DbD is more challenging as you can't even fight back. People need to stop bashing people for enjoying different things. It's like the Pineapple on Pizza discussion, let people like what they like. Ignore their side if you find it so annoying. Jesus fuck, what is this, pre-school?
---
I think camping is as viable strategy as looping. I'm not the one getting triggered by camping in 2019. 
---
Switching the camera angles on both sides, survivors are now in first person, while killers are in third person view.
---
Thats really not how it works. Im saying that Facecamping makes sense in some cases, and that in those cases, its not fair to whine about it. In other cases, if its "no reason" Thats a subjective matter. It sucks but its literally just 3 minutes of your time, then your on to the next game, and you get the knowledge the killer doesn't get to pip or anything. Its a selfish thing to DC, and face camping is boring and unfun to play against, but so was old DS and SWF P3 Claudettes with purple flashlights and insta heals. I don't go DCing every time it happens, I stick it out and play it. 
---
yeah, you can move without a killer spotting you from halfway across a map (unless you're duckwalking)
---
What I've noticed is that if the bar get stuck at zero, it's your game failing to connect, 10% it's a survivor failing and around 70%-80% it's the killer failing. May not be 100% accurate, but it's what I've been observing for the past couple of weeks.
---
She has her own game already though, wouldn't it make more sense to use someone from the show?
---
And one match is meh. Killers DC when they get salty mostly, but when a killer DC's they're hurting no one but themselves. Survivors who DC from getting downed are just fucking over their team completely. Face camping sucks, but at the end of the day its like, 3 minutes, then you're going to another game. its just a matter of selfishness mostly. If you hate facecamping that much, why encourage it? DCing just makes them go "Oh cool, I just one hooked a survivor and they died instantly, ill go do it more" Plus the arguement of "he coulda farmed" No, thats not how that works either. Cause he doesn't owe you anything. If everyone but you DC's instantly, I don't owe you farming. I don't owe you mercy. Sucks, oh well. 
---
I don‚Äôt care about getting downvoted. It‚Äôs a hard truth. Killer mains only get butthurt about DC‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a loss of potential BP‚Äôs, or because it won‚Äôt count towards their achievements. If it weren‚Äôt for those factors, they wouldn‚Äôt care about DC‚Äôs. I‚Äôve even known killers who love making people rage quit. Or choose one person and slug THEM the entire game while letting everyone else go. They care more about feeling god-like because the killer IS invincible, rather than playing a game where they have to follow any sort of rules. 
---
It‚Äôs why killers hate SWF so much. They don‚Äôt want an actual game of 1v4. They was 4 small 1v1 games where they have no threat to losing because they have more power. Killers use SWF as an excuse to beg for killer buffs, not giving a shit that it completely destroys solo players. So they play like a shit monster and  get people to DC. 
---
As someone who plays survivor and killer this always scares me shitless
---
Either Minnie or Carver
---
Don't forget 
---
*Not unhooking others even if the obsession is being chased
---
*When they do actually work on a gen they miss a skill check
---
*They love to feed Michael his Evil Within
---
*Claudette in brown clothes or P3
---
The behave thing is good.
---
Or billy, nurse, huntress, freddy, pig, or legion. :D
---
i don't want to be R1. But if i play seriously i think i belong to rank 5-3. 
---
&gt; you have to almost double pip on average
---
you only can do that bad playing badly = getting carried by your teamates while taking advantage of them.
---
If you play as a solo survivor trying to help your teamates to survive, which is the peak performance, like the hardcore mode compare to swf for exemple, you won't double pip with this new sysem.
---
Yep, knew they would come. But people hate tunneling, hate camping, because its unfun. They expect the killer to farm when they lose a memeber early. Its just not how it works. Whatever works to make you win, you should be doing. If you hold yourself back by a petty fear of "tunneling" you're simply playing less effectively then someone whos willing to do that if it works out more.
---
Don‚Äôt look for people to play with in discord for any game, it‚Äôs a bad bad idea. If you can learn in solo you‚Äôll get good pretty quickly. Swf is easy mode.
---
I would look to see but do I want to give him views?
---
Sadly it‚Äôs real.. Bhvr tweeted it out 
---

---

---

---
Being salty for being camped is 100% justified, I personally run MYC, B&amp;C, perks that generally reward you for not being a dick. Holding the game hostage is the most toxic thing, and is what the original argument was about. Not whether camping was okay, but if forcing the killer to DC because you don‚Äôt like their playstyle is fine 
---
It was confirmed by McClean that he has actual voice lines in some capacity.
---
One broke the rules by disconnecting. The other player poorly by camping, but broke no rules.
---
See why one is worse than the other?
---
Ah yes, don't try to defend hooks when the game is over. Unless you have monitor or a power that suppresses terror radius, you can't even patrol. It's disgustingly overpowered with open exit gates.
---
When I was frustrated by noed, I ran small game. Against borrowed time, I need Make Your Choice. Meaning I need to buy dlc or hope it gets on the bloodweb sometime this year. And even then, you can only have MYC on one person at a time. 
---
not sure what your data shows anything as that‚Äôs a extremely small sample size. you could very well just been queued into the same killer..? or say if you only play during 5 am from russia where there‚Äôs only one dedicated clown main around your rank playing killer. on a daily basis i face more LF than clown + nurse combined. i have over 1k hours if that means anything. 
---
I'm not "triggered" if you read the post it's about the killers crying for extra points when someone dcs because of their toxic behavior. 
---
\*sighs\*
---
  
---
\*unzipz pants\*
---
Why in the hell? I would pay to face those legends
---
If you need to patrol/camp to ever secure a kill, maybe you should take a good look at yourself
---
U sure or is it just their version of an April fool's joke. Game companies have a habit of doing that. Like Final Fantasy for example, they made a video each yr for two yrs announcing an app and now a new "speaker" but both were pranks.
---
Eh,  if they have a leave match button what do you expect? I feel like not allowing someone off the hook is taking the game hostage for that player,  so yeah. But to each their own.
---
How is that a problem?
---
You know the map better walking backwards than I do forwards..
---
cropped because i cannot do shit with a phone, also i posted this because there were 2 posts about a teammate feeding myers.
---
The design decisions of the Devs dont help either. Bandaiding changes with perks is poor design.
---
Take the new DS for example: I think its a good middleground as the previous version was clearly abusable, but why the fuck do i have to use one of my 4 perk slots just to defend against a tunneling killer?
---
Borrowed Time feels almost as mandatoy as Ruin sometimes. 
---
Killers have Lightborn, but flashlights still get nerfed into the ground?
---
Its not enough to reduce the pallet numbers... Better give em Spirit Fury too. 
---
God forbid survivors have anything. SWF gets discord.. So they better throw the entire game balance away to compensate. SMH
---
This has been the only game where I regularly receive hate mail for winning. And I‚Äôm not even that good. 
---
I NEVER once said he should farm,  I personally don't like farming. I have more fun actually playing the game. In the post comment,  I also said I didn't DC. I had no intentions of it either,  everyone just keeps assuming I dc. I'm just giving a explanation the the 100 posts of people bitching about survivors dcing all the time, I don't get mad that my team mate who is stuck on the hook dcs. If they do it for no reason then yes I do blame them, but I don't wanna hang on the hook a entire match either and half of these team mates I would be "fucking over" don't even know I'm being camped because they are to busy on the gen or crouch walking on the opposite side of the map. So sorry, I'm not always concerned about my pos team mates lol.

I got both for free on PSN. Did you know Jason can be pallet looped by Counselors without an actual pallet? He can also be bullied more harshly than DBD killers. Though he does have super OP tracking skills
---
Please, never add a "rank ladder" to DBD, some killers and survivors already sweat too much over a casual game. 
---
Nurse has needed a buff since day one and we get this?
---
But with Ash coming out next Chapter with no killer, I don‚Äôt think they can, not at least for awhile 
---
During chases you get 218371298471982472819 meters of terror radius though,combine that with michael's dead rabbit,and your radius covers the whole map pretty much
---
Theres no good reason. Its dumb. If anything you run m&amp;a and nurses calling so they think u cant see them. Distressing on nurse is trash
---
Pretty sure it has the lowest escape rate for survivors 
---
For everyone just tuning in to MY post,  I did NOT dc,  I played the match out. 
---
Oh Boi, no thank you :D
---
Are we supposed to see something? I can hear a thunder crack though. üòè
---
That's because you're braver than me, pal!
---
There's one by the gen next to the tower itself that survivors never seem to see, even though it is LITERALLY HOOK CAMERA DISTANCE FROM BEING SPOTTED. It's so odd.
---
For huntress it's good because your radius goes to 20m to something like 24m? It doesn't really affect anything since your humming can be heard from miles away anyways
---
I expected the other arm to read something different once I read the middle part
---
I can see it now

After the death of his Som, wife and hope Kenny was a man with no soul, no different from the husks that roam the earth

To be fair. The huntress is the entity's "anime girl" and everyone loves her.
---
Killer: THE INFECTION
---
zombie, who‚Äôs left click is a bite. 
---
It‚Äôs ability revolves around the living dead, who lay almost still around the map. When awakened by survivors walking or sprinting nearby, they show the aura of the survivors as long as they are seen. 
---
The killer can switch between these, leaving the old zombie as another sentinel. The zombies will attempt to follow survivors, albeit slower than them, and will continue to roam a small 10 meter radius around where they lost the survivor.
---
if they catch the survivor, they will hold them in place until the survivor fills their wiggle bar and escapes.
---
Add ons can increase the amount of zombies, but default zombies on the map is 10.
---
just made up for fun in about 5 minutes, but how does it sound?

When does it stop? You give yourself a pass as long as you're not having fun, but how many situations can you guys justify disconnecting to yourselves? At some point the killer meta is just going to be killers/loadouts on your pre-approved list so they can actually get a match. And what about the teammates that don't get their jimmies rustled every time they get a tough matchup? SOL I guess?

---
I think they look better than DBD‚Äôs dirty mongoloids.
---
&gt;his is something killer mains seem to be mentally unable to understand. Nobody wants to play against a killer using garbage tactics because it‚Äôs NOT A FUN GAME. Screw that mess. 
---
Imagine if killers started disconnecting from matches in progress because you brought a syringe or you keep running in circles around a shack. 
---
I mean, you could. Tunneling killers usually at least soft camp. If you're near the hook and smack someone going for a save, you should be able to down them right after they unhook and you don't risk Endurance triggering on the unhooked person. Tunneling is also less points overall and less pressure on rest of the survivors, instead of 1 injured and 1 hooked person you just have 1 hooked person now. Plus, it sucks to be on the other end of getting tunneled instead of going against a killer that actually outplays you. Even so, if a killer successfully tunnels and removes 1 survivor asap, it's pretty much game over.
---
Tunneling is easy and lowers the skill cap for killers massively. And it's not just bad killers who tunnel, good killers do it too. Unlike tunneling however, only good killers can win a match consistently by overpowering the survivors, I've seen killers who ignore every unhooked person and still end up with a 4k. Nobody likes losing and being told how to play, but do you really have fun going for the safe option every game instead of striving to improve as a killer?
---
same.
---
Calling it now, Mettle of Man is going to become the new pre nerf DS.

UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

i knew all u nea mains were furries üòîüòîüòî

I'm not saying that it's working properly,  it's just that it's not really a problem currently because it doesn't really affect the perk anymore if you are or aren't the obsession 
---
people are allowed to complain about things that are entirely unenjoyable. and ain't nobody using ds anymore I can tell you that
---
I might be alone on this but that is not the worst for me if they run tier 3 lightweight they almost leave no scratchmarks

Alright, and your entitled to that opinion, same as im entitled to say its selfish and jerkish to just DC because your team is taking too long getting you, or that they can't get you.

Hey, Vsauce Michael here, what is 'the game' and how do we make it 'scary'.
---
I once made a post explaining how DbD would actually port pretty flawlessly into a mario kart racing game. 
---
Meg has speed but bad control. 
---
Huntress can launch hatchets. 
---
Hillbilly can do crazy speed boosts but has no control during them and longer crash times. 
---
Doc can do a shock and reverse the controls of others around him temporarily. 
---
Pig can do a dash attack to crash cars (think mushroom boost but can slam you like a star if hit) 
---
Freddy can either 'put you to sleep' and disable your controls temporarily (or until you hit something and wake up) or be invisible to dodge shit. 
---
Quentin can take one more hit since he has a 'health pack' 
---
Etc etc etc 
---
Idk if anyone has pointed this out (I‚Äôm too lazy to read all the comments), but I really appreciate your Feng.
---
This is like every survivor had a baby. 
---
Gosh, this is gorgeous. The simplistic shading, the near perfect bloodstains. I don't know, I really like the style.  
---
Be proud of yourself, OP. You did a fab job.
---
Learn 2 give them the hatch
---
That quote should be chanted by the characters on the stairs of the Disney castle to end all of their shows tbh
---
The mask is just a mask, it doesn't effect their head, body, voice, or gender; only the outfit/body cosmetics do.
---
Lol! Not my favorite combo. 
---
Prefaces opinion with "Unpopular opinion:" as a defense mechanism against expected criticism. 
---
except being the obsession has a slew of other possibilities. Killers have several Obsession perks that encourage basically killing or targeting you first or putting you at some sort of disadvantage, and if someone can equip their own DS and pseudo guarantee they AREN'T the obsession that is unfair considering what the perk says.
---
Call it "Dad by Daylight"
---
Lithe is theoretical meta, every exhaustion perk ( except Head On ) can be considered meta in my opinion. I start to see more survivors running Lithe than Balance Landing at rank 1. 
---
Looks awesome &lt;3
---
Bond, empathy, turn the volume down, yeah
---
Yea I was thinking about this. Would be pretty cool. Each survivor would be specializing in a specific role.
---
*Entity Displeased*
---
Thanks a lot &lt;3 
---
Beautiful :D
---
So you're saying now that they've removed broken parts of the game like palette vacuums, brand new part, decisive, insta-blinds, etc, you can't win anymore? They removed those because survivor was no skill to use literally any of those and now you actually have to try to win.
---
Also I get into games immediately all the time I have no idea what you're talking about 
---
It's only good for a while until everyone knows about the spot. Given the spot always there, I always check. After a bit, it will be like the totems in the killer shack.
---
Really? I love them and so do some of my friends. They are fun maps. 
---
I also strongly agree or disagree with you.
---
If you're not playing Susie then yes, you're bad. 
---
Imagine getting *that* mad at someone interpreting something wrong. 
---
I have been seeing new spawns that are a bit harder to find recently. I've also seen new ones that are so out in the open, you couldn't miss them if you tried which is why I only run totems with a totem build.
---
I mean everyone's affected now 
---
"That isn't what I meant when I said we should get into better shape, Frank." -Julie, probably
---
It all depends on the user. I‚Äôm excellent at juking and running a killer so iron will is a wasted slot for me. My friend is great at stealth but bad at running so iron will works great for her. I actually run both but you really can‚Äôt go wrong with either perk. 
---
WHILE they get gens done. Plus hope is ass anyways. I hope you are just listing perks and not saying that's the build he should run
---
Where's your holiday cheer, friend? What happened?
---
Sometimes my mouse doesn‚Äôt respond at all in game (it‚Äôs a Razer), to fix I unplug and replug the usb cord in and it works fine again. Dunno if it‚Äôs my mouse or DBD though. 
---
&gt; Your objective isn't to kill outright, killers are meant to play with their food. That's why the sacrificial hooks exist, remember? To drain hope from the survivors?
---
No I'm pretty sure it's to kill survivors, you don't tend to rank up by whacking everyone and letting them go. There's incentives built in now to handicap yourself and extend a match for a more rewarding experience for your opponent, but it'll take more than those mental gymnastics about toying with them to argue any other purpose for the killer. 
---
&gt;You earn both more bloodpoints and more emblem points going for a different target. Hell, there's even an emblem score event for hooking 4 unique survivors.
---
Hooking 4 unique survivors doesn't exclude targeting the freshly-unhooked player and capitalizing on a bad save. You're dodging the point I'm making though, that there's this moral obligation on the killer's side to not rush the objective out of making a fun match for their opponent, while no expectation on the other side. 
---
&gt; I'm willing to bet you're the type who also believes Hex: Ruin is absolutely mandatory to even have a fighting chance.
---
Is this where we start questioning each other's skill level to undermine the points we're making? I'm gonna pass if you don't mind. 
---
Unlucky I suppose? Or maybe I‚Äôm hyper lucky. All I know is that I can tell when they‚Äôre running stridor, cause I can‚Äôt hide for shit lol, otherwise the groans of pain aren‚Äôt that bad on Feng (whom I play the most). It could also be that I tend to hide by gens that are being worked on, or other loud things to mask my own noises, but even when I don‚Äôt I still manage to hide fairly well.
---
Man I think one of the hardest I've laughed at a video game was when me and a buddy both went speedo Chad and trolled a really bad Jason all game. She would hit him from behind, we would dance emote on his body, dodge attacks and hit him again, rinse repeat. We almost all got away, sadly me and Tommy Jarvis both died that game but it was worth it to get everyone else away. Selfless Distraction Chad was probably my favorite role to play.
---
Don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs a crutch when you and/or your team have to actually accomplish something before using it. 
---
At least they don't put them on the outside of the killer shack anymore. At least they tried /s
---
As others have said, I'd like Lee instead largely because of how the series ended.
---
I'm sure with a bit of thinking you could get some pretty good perks out of it as well that fit with the lore. 
---
Spirit on pair with Billy and Hag on par with Huntress tbh.
---
Another victim falls prey to lies and clickbait and lashes out. I believe  this is the part where you make a comment on the relevance of my username and/or ask who hurt me. 
---
Because everyone knows, you have to enjoy this pablum, there's simply no other option. If you don't then you're defective as a human being.
---
Their poop is the soil
---
It's stupid to try to loop palettes? The palette vacuum was when the survivor teleports to the complete other side of the palette before they were even there. 
---
Also name some killer buffs they did 
---
I think you're a bit of an exception to the rule, I don't tend to see many survivors handicap themselves on the killer's account. 
---
Arvo.
---
If you want to commit sudoku use bond, holy shit it made me hate playing this game
---
Hell yes. The only problem being that if I played killer and saw her, I couldn't bring myself to harm a hair on her head
---
I do. 
---
Wanna fuck?

Lol

Woah there pal. Thats kinda triggering to a lot of people. Should probably take it down now tbh
---
I would be perfectly fine with a counter to head on (if they would actually buff it...) But a counter to an anti-tunnelling perk is a horrible idea. Especially an anti-tunnelling perk that isn't good enough yet. Enduring is that counter. 
---
You're so mad. I would be too if I was trash enough to die to a rank 18 
---
I used the word "entitlement" because that's how you're acting. I read this post twice and it seems like a rant, there's not really anything for me to address. I'm just saying that I think it's a bit of a bitch move to whine about a killer or loadout you don't like and DC from a match and sandbag your teammates. I don't see what's so controversial about that. Killers DC too, just at nowhere near the rates that entitled survivors like yourself do. I don't know if I agree with OP that there should be a 30 minute wait penalty on joining another lobby, but it's a growing problem and it needs a better solution. 
---
Except I got downvotes for saying I'd beat someone up irl if I knew they played legion. This sub is gay and has a sheep mentality if they see one downvote you get 200 more
---
I genuinely cannot tell if this is serious or an April fools prank 
---
The entity do not only feed of hope but strong feelings ; )

Source: Dev Stream on lore
---
I play Freddy with the entire map at once.  I don't spend time chasing but instead try to pressure as many survivors as possible.
---
My "chase" typically involves getting one hit off and letting them run away from my terror radius, then coming back in later to follow up once they think they're safe (survivors outside your radius are outlined in the dreamworld)
---
My favorite trick is to use a wounded, sleeping survivor as bait. I'll follow at a distance and wait till their aura shows an animation like they're being healed or woken.  Then I come in and sleep/attack the survivor they just led me to.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs the April fools prank
---
Killers literally CANNOT D/C at the same rate as survivors, because for every single game there are 4 times the amount of survivors. 
---
Duh. 
---
I never said shit about it being okay to sandbag your teammates, so you‚Äôre making shit up there. 
---
If I don‚Äôt want to play on the killers terms, I don‚Äôt have to. End of story. Don‚Äôt want survivors DC‚Äôing? Don‚Äôt using toxic gameplay. Simple and ez. I‚Äôve plays many many killer games where I don‚Äôt camp, don‚Äôt tunnel, don‚Äôt slug, and still come out on top. 
---
Kindred, Borrowed Time, Spine Chill (To an extent). Camping is scummy and stupid but there is 100% some counterplay 
---
Holding the game hostage involves more than just ‚Äòforcing them out‚Äô. Stealth is good when the gens are up since there are objectives to do that they‚Äôll eventually need to go to. But hiding for the sake of making the match drag on means there‚Äôs little for the killer to do. Unless you have something like whispers, they can keep hidden since they could be in any corner, in any bush, possibly four of them scattered
---
You don‚Äôt ‚Äòspawn in and die‚Äô since there‚Äôs still the finding and chase element of the game there. Against a camping killer often your first hook will be your last, and the killer‚Äôs only hook too given how long it takes. This and tunnelling shouldn‚Äôt be things in the game but to take up your own vigilante justice in literally forcing them to DC is absolutely toxic. 
---
You‚Äôre blaming them for a design flaw in the game. Equally, a killer shouldn‚Äôt trap a survivor in a basement for something like safe pallet looping. It‚Äôs a mechanic unfair and unfun for the other side but it‚Äôs a part of the game and a legitimate tactic. The killer would have no right to keep you trapped somewhere until you DCed and gave up all your points and two pips
---
Yeah, fair enough. I don't think most people like that regurgitated shit, but if they do and they're having fun, I'll live for one day.
---
 Hopefully you find something genuinely funny today, I usually find a gem or two somewhere online. ~
---
About time 
---
Would be cool though, for a Dead by Daylight Season 2/Second act/Night. alike League/Smite updates  
---
If not, Bring on the Sequel &lt;3
---
even loyal streamers are burnt out by the game
---
I do well with Myers there, better than coldwind honestly
---
Those players are also in the solo q.
---
Haha exactly. Honestly one of the reasons i do this is to MAKE the survivor stop wiggling lol all that nea had to do was stop wiggling and she could've rested easy on the hook lmao
---
Not really, exhaustion perks like Sprint Burst are pretty braindead. And anyway, shouldn't we be judging perks off the best players?
---
I've never come across a killer that didn't ever slug, so if wasting 3 perks means I'll stop being left on the ground for 5 minutes at a time, it'll be worth it in that regard. Will switch out boil over for something else though, since I always forget it affects movement, not actual wiggle speed.
---
If this was real it would literally kill the game. Like the game is already dying because of the changes to the ranking system. This would literally be the nail in the coffen.
---
\*immediately checks forums\*
---
Did 2.5 gens solo, 3rd booked by a camping Leatherface after the first two DC‚Äôd, only at rank 14 and I depipped back to 15
---
Yeah, i remember when that shit happened. but it still exists in some ways.
---
but it's not stupid to loop them, as i stated i looped a freddy for several minutes as they had no clue that i was able to do this for longer, but FUCkInG HiTboXeS! anyways, they got the gen done and got the gates  open.
---
true the buffs, but every killer is just so overpowered now, at least a buff to survivors of some sort? like a 1%+ speed to something. it's unfair that the killers are always getting four man's. i can get a four man easily like spreading butter on toast. (not really but you get the point.)
---
I think after the next gen consoles launch, a sequel is a definite possibility. I know the devs want to support this game for years to come, but I still think a sequel could definitely work with updated graphics and better optimization. If we don‚Äôt get a sequel, then I hope progress from PS4/XB1 will carry over to next gen consoles. 
---
Post what you want. This reddit is for Dead by Daylight. :) It's your choice to click on what posts your interested in, so if it doesn't interest you, it's as simple as not clicking on it. 
---
You're saying there has never been a single game you've played where you haven't been slugged for longer than 10 seconds at a time?
---
Does this mean the generators are gay? Corrupt Intervention is NSFW in that case 
---
If I had a dime for every time someone said this game is about to die, I‚Äôd have enough to own BHVR. 
---
 April fools. You can tell they went way overboard to make it obvious its a joke. Also inaccurate because female killers have 110% MS with nurse going from her current 95% to the 100% does not put her there. Also as fake and obvious as this is, I don't think its cute. You're a development team. You should stay professional and not make stupid jokes on a stupid holiday. 
---
I just learnt something new, thankyou!
---
Borrowed time doesn't always help. I've still been tunneled with Borrowed Time. 
---
HAHAHA
---
You mad you can see it from 1 direction instead of all directions? Seriously?? Entitled. 
---
It‚Äôs obviously April fools but the totem change doesn‚Äôt seem like something they haven‚Äôt considered üòÇ
---
Yeah, I think some of them just try to be more sneaky, it seems. OF course, it doesn't always work out. 
---

I was surprised we didnt get that with The Spirit's release. her backstory pretty clearly implies and old, large, multi-story manor. instead, we got a large zen garden with a multi-room hut.
---
Outraged bias comment in response to this post! Statement disregarding your views 5000%! Sub par insult in an attempt to put salt in the wounds! Irrelevant remark about your mom!
---
I never understood the appeal for F13. The way the characters move has always looked so clunky 
---
&gt;perks like Hex:Devour Hope, will force survivors to hook rush

***We're gonna live forever intensifies***

Yes, and if I had any self respect and cared whether or not people thought I was a shameless upvote whore I‚Äôd delete it at once!

Just to point out, this isn't real, and was created by me, not_queen did not write this and this post is purely used as an april fools joke created by me
---
Thank you I really appreciate it!! :D
---
Thanks
---
Helps a lot. Gets you closer to the turnability that PC has. I highly recommend you turn sensitivity all the way up for killer and survivor. Easier to 360 and not get 360'd when you are the killer
---
"NOED is for trash killers!" - Meg with 3 adrenalines in her party and 3 borrowed time, 3 dead hard, multiple self care and DS.
---
Stridor
---
Nah. I'm not going to be presumptuous and attack you but I will say that as a killer without stridor I find people from the grunts A LOT. Like all the time bro. I don't know what you're talking about or who your playing. But when you have iron will you can fake a lot of things. Example: 
---
Was on lerys memorial. Killer hit me, i boosted away in a hall past a medical bed covered by a tent. I ran to a window but didnt go in, then urban evasioned backwards behind a pillar. Essentially faking my path. Killer took the bait and lost me forever. If I didn't have iron will he would have heard me behind the pillar right away and the whole thing would never have worked. I will say that iron will is good in certain builds meant to Houdini the killer.
---
honestly, adrenaline is far more bullshit than DS ever was. especially since it gets even MORE powerful if you' have the hook through your chest. just lazy really.
---
Spirit is not map dependent. For me, Haddonfield is her only bad map. Again, if survivors knows where your traps are, that's it, they have control over them and you can do shit about that. They can destroy your traps with flashlights, Sprint Burst away over them, force you to chase a another survivor, so you can't get a early kill. Btw, even Leatherface punish altruism hard, you will say about him that is good ? Hag also suffers in corn maps and big maps ( Red Forest ) and she gets gen rushed in early game. And Spirit power isn't reliant on survivors and btw, duration add-ons are really shit, good Spirits use charge time + speed.
---
&gt;Excuse me? i'm not angry, just saying that your argument is just plain and stupid. put more effort into it, you probably dont know how to juke at all, basing on how bad you're acting.
---
Like I said kid, I have videos of my godlike skills , while you on the other hand... Die to rank 18s
---
&gt; calling others trash breaks rule one of this subreddit, jesus. learn how to act and think before you go onto a rant, A RANT, and call the person trash.
---
Lmao you're the only one ranting.
---
&gt; most of you are probably killer mains to go this balls deep into my already salty post. 
---
Like I said I have a YouTube, and all my videos are survivor gameplay , please continue assuming though.
---
&gt;rank 18's are just a rank, they probably are just rank reset's but i wouldn't count as so much as my fucking  dick on it.
---
No you're just trash. I'll make a new account right now and get to rank 18 ... I'll upload videos of me demolishing them and prove you wrong.
---
Me being a skilled survivor .. I would never die to a noob.
---
I addressed every point you attempted to make. 
---
Why would you flair it as BHVR Official if it is an april fools joke?
---
No worries, all votes are appreciated.
---
Tunneling and soft camping is a valid strategy.
---
As a survivor you can:
---
A) Let the killer camp and do the gens.
---
B) Rescue mission! Unhooking in the right time so the unhooked player can get some distance AND stall the killer by blocking him. If there are two rescuers the big Campy shouldn't have much chances. 
---
Ive said this before and got downvoted, but Ill say it again.
---
After putting many, many hours into both games, I feel like Friday is the better game (at least for me). I still very much enjoy DBD and play from time to time, but it just gets too boring. DBD is too linear for me. Repair generator, leave. As killer you chase around pallets and hook people. Friday has its flaws too - you cant always play as Jason and the game is also not releasing any new content, which is a huge bummer. However, it does have dedicated servers and the game has many ways to escape - either through time, boat, car, the cops, or even killing Jason. And when you play as Jason there are more techniques and strategies to taking down a counselor - grabbing, slashing, projectiles. That and you have to play around the counselors having different items to delay the game to allow others to escape and them having knifes so they can escape your grab. Each game feels different while DBD is repetitive. DBD is interesting as their perk system is more in depth and offers more unique perks to survivors and killers, while Jason's perks are set to each Jason, and his powers are the same for everyone. However, once I started getting into the high ranks of DBD, I found myself really only using one or two killers and using the same perks every time as they were just the best way to win. Not to mention when you have everything unlocked character choice is irrelevant (other than the model). I still love DBD but I find myself playing Friday instead almost every time. I just have more fun playing as Jason or a Counselor in Friday than I do playing as Killer or Survivor in DBD as there are just more things to do in Friday. 
---
This message says new system was removed but is back online again , this time taking into account the geolocation of players to try and result in a lower ping . Though if dedicated servers become a thing a and not just hot air, it'll change again. 
---
Oh no, I wasn't very clear. I'm the killer. ;)
---
I use Whispers, Monitor and Abuse, Bamboozle, and Ruin. Whispers is essential IMO for finding the first survivor and getting out of EW1 as quickly as possible, but sometimes I'll swap it for Nurse's Calling since his stealth makes it really easy to catch a survivor with their pants down, especially if you're using a Dead Rabbit addon. Using EW is a good looping deterrent but it doesn't work if you're banking your 99%, or the survivor is crafty. I take Bamboozle instead of Brutal to both shut down looping and make myself pretty hard to get away from in EW3, you vault windows as fast as a survivor with that combo. 
---
Bill had a very intense sexual relationship with Trapper.
---
Also I have a question, what do you mean lvl 50 OG? Do you think player level 50 is good? I'm player lvl 50 too by the way... Only I'm also devotion 6.
---
Distressing on Spirit also works pretty well.
---
Right now until I can upgrade Leatherface, I'm using:
---
Whispers, Devour Hope, Spirit Fury, and Distressing. 
---
Can you link to any thread saying to Nerf Sloppy Butcher? Those perks still remain basically untouched. BBQ was even buffed recently
---
So I have to run a perk to make the game even remotely playable? Screw that.
---
Plus, I have to hit the Survivors first and it's hard-countered by Iron Will.
---
There are no rules on this sub. Check my post history I get real raunchy with it. 
---
Eh, it used to only work if you were dying or otherwise moving around. I think the addition to also work while carried or hooked is a great change, even though it has costed me a few kills. 
---
That‚Äôs the case with a lot of perks though. A lot of perks are crutch perks.
---
Bit late on this but browsing brought me.  
---
 Deliverance counter is you get broken. That's fucking brutal and a half.  
---
DS is now hot trash. Borrowed time is easy to get around. Like basic bitch easy.  
---
I agree on insta heals but they are rare perks so ehhhhhhhhhh.
---
This is coming from a rank 5 huntress main.  
---
Number 1's secondary effect sounds like it would be a pretty good buff for vigil.
---
Yeah I agree, I'm just laughing at these posters below me unironically arguing that it's ok for one side to rush their objective but not the other. Special Olympics of mental gymnastics down there,  lol
---
You can just swing your movement stick around corners you want to juke around or just roll it in an even circle if there's any hope that a 360 will work. It's all about calm clean pacing on thise sticks, like how you shouldn't go crazy when you're struggling on the killer's shoulder or the hook
---
Adrenaline 
---
Funny thing is that the guy in the wheelchair is (Dwight Hartman from Scary movie 2). May a "Dwight cosmetic"?  
---
Hanson would make a good killer. Or maybe a Billy cosmetic
---
Jacket from Hotline Miami 
---
Go back into invisibility as Bing Bong to assert dominance. 
---
I‚Äôve seen people calling him an idiot often. Can you tell me why?
---
Rare footage of the all-powerful Dwight using his powers to heal his far less powerful teammates. 
---
The devs make a big deal out of claiming that all the characters are at least 21 years old (even high schoolers Laurie and Quentin) so they would probably have to age her up if they put her in the game. Would love it though.
---
Don‚Äôt use lightweight, there‚Äôs a video basically showing it‚Äôs useless.
---
What are the buffs that they gave to killer?
---
Id welcome these changes. That would be great. 3 hits is good no hex totems is good. Id get fucked over as killer a lot more but id survivor killers more. I wish the change was real and not on april 1st. 
---
That got me. Thought it was legit for a sec. GG.
---
I messaged my SWF in a panic and now I'm big stupid
---
Except even worse because DS didn't let a full survive with friends team teabag you from across the map even though you've given up.
---
I don't even wanna think about a potential combo with Self Care and Sole Survivor.
---
THE GAY COMMUNITY? 
---
I went there to the discord on the lfg channel and basically was ignored multiple times asking for xbox games. They are mostly ps4. I will play with you but i usually am only on late at like 10 pm cst. I found another person the plays regularly around that time sso if the time was good for you we may could put together a 3 man swf team. 
---
I have fun against legion
---
i wanna see the guy from party hard also not a video game killer but pinhead and jeepers creepers are on my top list but i doubt we will ever see jeepers cuz well ya know
---
I am so tired of April Fools. Can it be tomorrow already. Send help. 
---
Rico from just cause
---
And also on the topic of greedy bloodpoint hunters, add a 100% bloodpoint bonus to no Mither. I'd run it every game if that was the case. As it is now, I'd rather run Deja Vu.
---
Bold of you to assume the phantom isn't a typo moron
---
MY GERMS!
---
It‚Äôs so bad that my friends and I are taking a long hiatus from the game.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
I lile them all but Distortion. I think the current version is a cool and unique perk. For me it is very useful besides countering BBQ.
---
It could be a new perk though.
---
*....wtf is the benefit from that?*
---
More like an entity displeased killer that will stop at nothing to please its god
---
He'll use his Strawng hand.
---
I don‚Äôt know, as I said, perhaps I‚Äôm beyond lucky, although luck can only take me so far. This has inspired me to do a test of my own, and play a handful of games with and without iron will and see if there‚Äôs any noticeable difference to be sure.
---
That was really well done
---
I main Freddy and usually play Save the Best for Last. 
---
People usually respect the hell out of the anti-tunneling build and it *actually* works amazing on him. 
---
There's a difference in "Legion is bad" and "I'm going to fucking murder you for playing Legion."
---
Once a door is powered, and more then 2 people are alive, you have to accept that if someone isn't death hook, you'll probably lose them.

If I put myself in his shoes, I would not give myself the right to call them toxic. I'm afk. They can do what they want to get points. In fact, if I came back and they were still there, I would just point farm. It's my fault for being gone.
---
Put yourself in their shoes. They got stuck in a shit game and won't get any beno points because no one will get injured. Not their fault. They are just trying to get points any way they can. 
---
‚ÄúI like em big, I like em chunky‚Äù

April fools?
---
I wonder if it takes skill to be this much of a oik. 
---
Try a squad of green haired neas
---
Same here and I wish we had more. I definitely want some kind of high school map (was disappointed Badham was another neighborhood), an old mansion, lots of possibilities.
---
Yes. I have had this bug for years. I finally stopped reporting it in the big forums. 
---
Question to you; does it seem to not respond for 1.5 seconds after an attempted m2?
---
Like after uncloaking, chainsawing, purging...
---
Thanks so much for your tips 
---
It‚Äôs such a shame, it‚Äôs all I play nowadays and they‚Äôve just completely buggered it. I understand them trying out new matchmaking methods, however it was clear from day 1 of the update it was broken, why have they not reverted it back! They must be haemorrhaging players left right and centre!
---
Well aren't you just a peach?
---
That laugh...     
---
Makes me weak in the knees every time üòç
---
.... Pennywise and The Clown are absolutely nothing alike....

None of those are dangerous anymore though except adrenaline. Self care sucks, ds really sucks, dead hard has counters, and borrowed time means stop tunneling. Swf also only has a limit cause if they all suck then they‚Äôre still going to die. You are complaining about things that aren‚Äôt really a huge problem.
---
Ah yeah, I remember when the nurse got released. I just played SWF with friends. And if I would play alone I played killer.
---
We all thought nurse is just trash, since her blinks are just so random. And since we were about rank 18 we didnt learn the truth. Oh and we all were shit at killer too, so when we all tried her out it just proved our point.
---
The wraith tho... he was just fucking OP I mean come on... HE IS INVISIBLE. You just had no chance to see him. 
---
You seem reasonable and we can both agree that camping is such a boring and scummy tactic. Holding the game hostage is too far but I understand wanting payback when you can‚Äôt exactly hook the killer yourself, but I disagree on camping being inherently toxic. Often it‚Äôs the right tactical choice
---
Especially for a Leatherface (As in the original context the OP of the post was a Leatherface) where camping is almost encouraged with his power (But strangely enough not his perks), it‚Äôs too far. Thank you for being polite in your response though, I just wish there was more to discourage killers from camping in the first place. The less bright ones don‚Äôt realise keeping one person hooked isn‚Äôt worth it if his teammates are sensible
---
The day anything to do with FNAF enters this game, is the day I‚Äôll quit.
---
you......i like you
---
Fuck this is so stupid and I love it!
---
Hey Vsauce Michael here
---
This is pretty scary 
---
Why? the game isn't bad. the community has really calmed and become really chill so i see no reason to judge based on bias. 
---
It would be nice if you could actually see the screen
---
Actually he's several peaches.
---
He actually kills like five people in the original movie, most of the deaths happen in the later half (upcoming part), he was originally played by Tim Curry, and he was in a movie a lot of us grew up on.
---
Also, you're being incredibly shortsighted if you think Pennywise is "just a clown" as opposed to what he actually is.
---
sorry
---
I remember some people suggesting his classroom photo becomes baseline. If only they tried to use this addon in an optimal way, then they would realize how devastating it can be.
---
Pretty good guide btw, good to get someone up to speed with the killer.
---
Cutleries nailed it. Shading, coloring, the style, it is all very great
---
My go too for her is BBQ, Ruin, Whispers, and pretty much any fourth perk you want. Good options being Make Your Choice, Enduring, Sloppy Butcher, but personally I use Iron Grasp because I hate the wiggle effect on Killer's with a burning passion.
---
Great now I want a clip of Wraith getting stunned but playing an actual elephant noise instead
---
Vigil doesn't need to be a personal Exhaustion reduction perk.They should work on making it a team perk.
---
Oh the game hasnt been a flop, it is a strange state of purgatory
---
Thank you for giving me actual criticism!  Also in what way is it op? i want to know so i can update this and as  for the model its probably just the fact that i chose a fan model because i wanted a full body shot of baby and the official model is a bit more fitting.
---
F
---
Dad is that you?
---
Restraint is definitely his best add-on, outside of Iridescent King. Assuming you get everyone to Tier 2 it's like bringing a free Whispers to the match. 
---
So many times will you find someone crouching behind terrain because a clone was looking right at them. 
---
I was replying to your comment for not making any sense as you used phrasing‚Äôs that didn‚Äôt belong in the slightest. I wasn‚Äôt the initial commenter.
---
If we‚Äôre getting a Chucky chapter, I really don‚Äôt want it to be based on the remake. The original series is still ongoing with an upcoming TV series so I‚Äôd hope they go for OG Chucky.
---
Surveillance is a must with it's new buff. Otherwise a build I use not often is my "don't need to see you to know you are there build" predator stridor sloppy butcher and bloodhound, add father's glasses and a hairpin and boom.
---
1 and 3 are interesting,  2 can be a slight hindrance to non SWF teams and maybe overkill on SWF.
---
Abbachio seems like the type of guy who would main nurse and make survivors drink his piss!
---
Whats the reference?
---
In what are these things over powered? let me know so i can fix it!
---
I like playing this way as well, see how long it takes for people to notice me.
---
yes but i won't DC 
---
Try a squad of p3 Claudette‚Äôs with flashlights. I play those for the memes.
---
I seem to be the only person who liked your joke, have an upvote!
---
NP
---
Dbd is a better game overall but f13 is a better horror game,
---
How does self care sucks though ? It is only a waste of time if the killer is legion or has sloppy butcher
---
WOW. SERIOUSLY?
---
My friend had a bug where their mouse escaped into explorer for a long time. Not even REINSTALLING the operating system fixed that.
---
I haven't checked the m2 actions. I'm missing 50-70% of all my hits tho. It's like playing on nightmare difficulty.
---
Well, Legion and not because "hE BaD", but because the latter can actually be  somewhat countered still by heading to any loop, thus making her puke and smack combo less effective, also you can make it hard for her to hit you with puke by taking sharp turns during loops (if they have high walls obviously.)
---
The only one that would actually be impossible.
---
Flair checks out
---
At one point survivors could get moris via a glitch.. god I wish I could choke my teammates
---
Oh, a Survivor is running Calm Spirit?
---
*laughs in Restraint*
---
Oh yes
---
Perks used to be tinted like that
---
When the innocent looking Survivors in bright clothing all suddenly swap to Claudette/Nea/Feng with Flashlights and P3 clothing.
---
Its a sign, isnt it?
---
r/tf2
---
At least from my perspective you were the initial commenter and as stated before the words i used make sense within context of response time
---
I‚Äôm too lazy to get into the power right now but as for the perks, the first one is just a bad idea all together, rewarding the killer for not being able to catch the survivor before bloodlust activates by practically giving them a free hit is completely unreasonable.
---
The second perk is punishing survivors for doing their objective. Of course this wouldn‚Äôt be the first perk that did this but it would be the heaviest we‚Äôve seen when considering the punishment.
---
A very interesting art style. Really good job.
---
Regardless of if they try to be sneaky, even if I can tell they're all getting chased and smacked, it always happens on the opposite end of the map from me.
---
I use BBQ, she‚Äôs great for it, not just bloodpoints. Surveillance is a must. First thing I taught. It‚Äôs great for keeping pressure on gens! Hardly ever lose a game because of it.  Ruin because obviously. And my 4th is usually franklins or Thanatophobia!   I REALLY want to get monitor and abuse though! Perfect for sneaking up on people. 
---
A fun build is devour, Ruin and thrill paired with prayer beads and yakuoke amulet. Give that a try!    
---
I suggest not using stridor because once you get used to hearing breathing and grunts of pain another perk will be of better use. Plus it makes survivors seem closer than they are.  Bloodhound wouldn‚Äôt be so bad though! 
---
I think the brightness could be increased a bit but it's still great. I love how many memes fit Clown.
---
Is the gif even necessary? This bug gets shown here like 20 times a day lol
---
I like it 
---
ya, i have that happen a lot when i got for an M1 where it just doesn't swing, so i start panic pressing M1 and it eventually swings (i usually miss these because of my frantic mouse movements). 
---
additionally, i have noticed that after an M2 action, it locks out the M1 for 1-2 seconds
---
this works with Leatherface surprisingly well
---
lmao so is there any fix. This appeared out of nowhere. I was about to buy a new mouse when I realized Windows works normally.
---
/r/im14andthisisfunny 
---
family guy is bad...sorry I just had to say it. the jokes are really shit and I see no comedy in this show...

---
To me it only works with huntress nurse and doctor. How Leatherface?
---
You essentially get revealed if you do anything except for walk even at a small distance that is too much if you got rid of vaulting and running revealing you I think it could be managed. I also wasn‚Äôt speaking about this specific model I was saying in general. FNAF‚Äôs art style and aesthetic is much different than that of DBD and I just don‚Äôt know how well that shift would work. Also maybe baby isn‚Äôt the best choice of animatronics we already have a clown and I think someone like Springtrap who is an actual serial killer might have been a better choice.
---
Clown Daddy is ready for the nipple clamps.
---
i have switched my mouse from Logitech to razor and i still have the same problems. i just learned to deal with it
---
I love him too, it's great to see a few more people with that skin lately. When I was (unintentionally) startling others it was more around the chapter drop and people weren't used to the skin, the first few times I loaded into swfs they were like "what on EARTH IS THAT?" and joked I hacked to play as killer. It happens a lot less now that most people know it exists. :(
---
You find games waaaaay quicker on F13 at least

Not to this extent.

Are toolboxes condoms in this metaphor?

I didn‚Äôt notice that but I see it! Lol!

This happened to me and I freaked out. Have you had the ‚Äúwiggle‚Äù glitch happen to you as well?
---
Thank you! :D
---
YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE, FOOL!
---
They were probably deranking since DCing doesn't derank anymore
---
Iron Will. Some games you won't make it to end game, so Adrenaline will be useless. And even if Adrenaline does pop, that's it. It does absolutely nothing before or after that. Iron Will is consistently good throughout the match, if you ever get injured.
---
That does work but 99% of the time if they get out too early they will be hit by the chainsaw. If they wait any longer they can be grabbed. That period of time where they can get out with only taking a hit is so small that any normal person wouldn‚Äôt be able to time it that perfectly. Not even ZubatLEL could do that.
---
Reading is hard.

Killers are deaf right now. No-one's playing Killer.

Fuuuuuuuuuck now I wanna see the Clown with a minigun.
---
this list is outdated and youre just flat out wrong on a lot of stuff, especially your exhaustion order. dead hard being the worst. lmao
---
Literally unplayable 
---
I agree completely and I feel as though you and I are 2 sides of the same coin. Those are more or less the same rules I go by, and I've hit rank 3 with killer before in the game using that exact mindset. I agree that is EXACTLY what should be done with how the game currently is to get the best game possible. The problem I have is simply, well, how the game currently is. Let me explain. 
---
My current issue with matchs and matchmaking isn't my playstyle, because I tend to do all of those things to varying degrees of success. In fact, my whole tactic with Wraith, my current main, is solely hit-and-run based that I mix with a lot of mind games to make survivors question who I am and am not chasing ("the ghost" and bone clapper for mindgames, with sloppy, nurses, bloodhound for switching from one injured survivor to the next, and ruin just to counter genrushing). My issue is that the killers goal in this game is, and I quote directly from the game goals section, "find and catch Survivors in order to hang them on sacrificial hooks to be consumed by the entity." Nothing else. This begs the question; Why is it, when I do EXACTLY that as quickly and efficiently as possible, am I now punished when I didn't used to be? 
---
The way I see it, either they need to focus more on the killer being rewarded for completing the end goal that is instilled directly in the games core mechanics, or emphasise that killing the survivors is not your goal/only goal, because realistically, it isn't. It isn't even close. You can do better by farming out players to high hell and then letting them ALL escape than you ever could actively running survivors into the ground and forcing a 4 man. 
---
How I see it, the killer role is deceptive and looks very straightforward, because frankly it should be. It just isn't right now because of how the game has evolved. That's not inherently bad either. I just wish that the game devs would pick one of the two options, not force killers to attempt to achieve both. 
---
Now for my personal opinion on how this could be fixed: Make killing a survivor more difficult BUT increase the rewards for doing so. Instead of emphasising a 4-man like the game seems to do, allow the killers to be rewarded for completing the goal the game has set up, but also make it so you can't mindlessly achieve this goal. Switching the standard for kills from 4 to 3 or 2, but increasing the survivors survivability as well as game complexity, is how I think the game would be benefited most. Understanding palette placement, game efficiency, counter plays, and mindganes should be CRUCIAL to game play, both as survivor AND killer. This means that completing PART of the end goal (killing 2-3 survivors) would net you an ALMOST garunteed single pip (that would be well deserved due to changes on survivability), but killing all 4 would be grounds for an almost garunteed two pip. That way, the core mechanic of "sacrifice survivors" is reinforced instead of punished, while hopefully increasing the games skill cap. 
---
I'll go ahead and directly apologise to the thread owner as this HAS gotten slightly off topic because brain be like that sometimes, I don't mean to hijak, I'm just a long winded person. 
---
You ! Help me satisfy my hunger ! Uh I mean :bubba noises:
---
I'm uninstalling as we speak
---
Lore-Wise it would make sense if it was Lee or one of the cliff-hanger characters
---
The entity then sends every killer after her
---
I love indoor maps and wish they would add more. The outdoor maps (which is literally every map except Lerys and The Game) get too repetitive sometimes.
---
Are you dumb? It's NOT supposed to be believable wtff üòÇüòÇ
---
I want rewards, but pass on the rank-locked cosmetics. Just a large sum of bloodpoints or shards, scaled by rank, would honestly be fine.
---
&gt; For me, Haddonfield is her only bad map. 
---
That, big maps and maps with lots of windows (e.g lerys) hurt her a lot
---
&gt;  Again, if survivors knows where your traps are, that's it, they have control over them and you can do shit about that
---
Its almost impossible to see the traps, the only way a survivor will know where it is is by seeing the Hag place it. The only thing they can do, flashlights aside, is avoid them, which is hard with up to 10 traps around the map, much of them placed in common pathways/crossroads.
---
&gt; They can destroy your traps with flashlights, Sprint Burst away over them, force you to chase a another survivor, so you can't get a early kill.
---
Flashlights are an item, and an uncommon one at that plus you can only flashlight traps that you know are there. Sprint Burst does do something I agree, but that cucks Spirit as well. 
---
&gt; Btw, even Leatherface punish altruism hard, you will say about him that is good ?
---
Lf needs to stay at the hook to punish the altruism, the Hag can be over 50 metres away doing her own thing and still be able to punish hook rescues
---
&gt;  Hag also suffers in corn maps and big maps ( Red Forest ) and she gets gen rushed in early game.
---
Thats fair, but it doesnt actually affect her much. Hag is one of the least map dependent killers in the game. She is more prone to genrush than other killers that is true though, but most of the time shes makes up for it with great chase potential and map pressure.
---
&gt; And Spirit power isn't reliant on survivors and btw, duration add-ons are really shit, good Spirits use charge time + speed.
---
While the Hags power is sort of reliant on survivors, if the Hag is smart and places traps well the survivors will ALWAYS run into them. U right about spirit addons though, charge time is godly for mindgames.
---

Screen shot on ps4 is real easy to do.
---
Yeah I've been trying Spirit recently, it's really hard to hear survivors. Something has definitely changed since this update. Thos coming after sounds were fucked throughout December to January mid chapter patch.
---
Its shit like this why I'm playing less and less these days. Tried using Trapper for my daily earlier, survivors still running through traps perfectly. Getting into games with only 2 survivors in. Nothing works at all.
---
I don‚Äôt have a usb

I'd hate watch it, just like I hate watched OUaT

Feels bad bud 
---
As a bing bong boi main, can confirm 
---
I might eventually, but don‚Äôt want it to be just for screenshots
---
This or they just waste all the good pallets instantly at 5 gens so you just want the killer to down the bitch asap.
---
Okay I added you. And I'll try and be as regularly as I can. 
---
The original meme is actually quite dark though.
---
The exposition about off-screen deaths doesn't really make him more creepy IMO, it was backstory so you're aware that he's not just a local phenomenon. I don't think there's a big relationship between on-screen death and added creepiness, I'm fact most of the time less is more in horror films, but the clown aesthetic and the children-protagonists put a ceiling on how much I could both empathize with the fear of heroes and horror of the villain. 
---
Legit? $8
---
So edgy coming from someone with 420 in their name. I bet your super popular.
---
Then I don't know what to tell you.
---
I'll go after the person who unhooked them instead. Chances are, they're being hook-farmed or SWF. If they're being a particularly douchy team of SWF then camp/tunnel away.
---
Sometimes the survivor that was recently unhooked will look at me, I'll shake my head, and run after their teammate for the rest of the match for shits and giggles.
---
Says "iceman". Also, learn how to spell. It's you're, not your. And I just randomly chose a weird name, cuz I didnt wanna go through all the time just to make a name, I want to be on Reddit, not Name Making Simulator
---
Now give her the ol' Quentin treatment. Just smear wrinkles all over the place and make her unrecognizable.
---
honestly if there still 2+ gens to do and only down to the last 2 survivors its almost better to just give up and let them get hatch
---
Claudette's become so invisible that she can now freely enter the spirit realm.

---
This is actually the most hyped I've been for a licensed DLC since Nightmare on Elm Street.
---
Can you imagine? Spend 5 years running from various murderers, dying, stepping in traps, being stabbed, impaled, chopped, cut, fixing generators, escaping only to do it again, going crazy... then just being whisked away to a normal society. How would one cope? I'd imagine it'd be the same way when Africans escaped the Rwanda genocide and came to America with all this dope shit.

To be fair. Eliminating all dull totems prevents NOED from popping after gens are completed. 
---
Yea I think M&amp;A is a must have over noed.

---
Sometimes I like to use shroud offerings as killer just to spoop the survivors. 
---
Thank you, I was thinking of running stridor actually. Just had a few games with surveillance, it works great!  
---
I don't like to work on gens with other players much anymore because of this but I HATE to work with another if ruin is still up. I'd rather just walk off and start a new gen since I know that person will miss every skill check while I'm hitting the hex ones.
---
If I turn up the brightness on my monitor I can see her most of the time. It's always funny when someone plays her in dark clothes and crouches in the middle of nowhere like I can't see them.

Thank you! I hate the sound she makes when she's stunned haha

Thanks, Discordance &amp; surveillance seem really strong for her

Take a medkit or let someone else heal you and you get another perk for free

There was absolutely no need to reboot the series while the original is still ongoing and the creator/original actors are involved, now they even have Hamill voicing Chucky to bring people to watch :/. Anyway I'm all for a Dourif Chucky in game (either Brad or Fiona)!
---
Ruin and devour hope combo: hold my beer
---
toxic Neas need some love too ! 
---
Yeah scratchmarks are broken on this map too. Some textures (like the broken machinery (?) that leads into the building) just don't seem to render scratchmarks at all, or at least very unreliably.
---
So you think you are lucky. I got Myers DLC specially because of DS. They both put it on shrine and nerfed it till it smells like shit. 
---
it's already an aura perk.
---
I run ruin, discordance, surveillance, and nurses/bbq, it‚Äôs a really strong setup nd good for slowing gens down
---
Nightmare dlc was amazing for like a week before the nerf lol
---
God forbid you learn to git gud before you put on your crutch perks.

I appreciate your honesty.

The exposition about off-screen deaths doesn't really make him more creepy IMO, it was backstory so you're aware that he's not just a local phenomenon and the children are up against some serous shit. I don't think there's a big relationship between on-screen death and added creepiness, In fact most of the time less is more in horror films, but the clown aesthetic and the children-protagonists put a ceiling on how much I could empathize with the fear of heroes, and the horror of the villain. It didn't work as a 'scary movie' to me, it was more like a well-polished Stranger Things feature. Not boring to watch, but not something that's going to keep you up at night. 
---
I find it funny how the devs nerfed DS two weeks ago, then two weeks later introduce a perk that would've been broken with old DS (Flip Flop), and a perk that's essentially the old DS replacement, depending on how it plays out (MoM). 
---

---
He could do gens... you have never actually played the game have you?
---
Damn ma is it that serious 
---
Yes. 
---
Sometimes it's nice though because you can SB to a Twall and if you have to mind game your uncloak. Or what I do is find map windows or something. If I'm near shack I just keep looping window while waiting for you to find the right time to uncloak. It's why I use bamboozle on Wraith as windows while cloaked are his weakness.
---
It will be 83%
---
I'm highly offended, not gonna lie
---
If you are not the killer there is a glitch now when the killer hooks you you still see from the killers view until unhooked.
---
They have found my reddit account! Evacuate immediately!
---
Keep it up, fam! ;)
---
Thank you for the quick reply. That is good to hear.
---
Those killers aren't gunna shit themselves... themselves.... nah that doesn't work nevermind
---
We have one hook to live. For most survivors no time at all. We are not like most survivors. We are swf. We have the resources, the will!
---
Moldy and Polished are both really good if your running chase Doc.
---
Unironically I wonder what the Clown tastes when they lick the survivor's fingers. Must not be pleasant considering its just a mix between generator oil, blood &amp; dirt with some added flavouring of pallet wood.
---
Not exactly the most pleasant of tastes. 
---
I got excited for a second.
---
They are not scary, they are just fuckin' annoying, my mans ;D.
---
I think Order is his best. You already dont have a hard time tracking with Doc and order will get you free hits.
---
I
---
I retract my statement, I forgot about Bill
---
omg yas! my name for a bit was "Clowns boyfriend" ugh, chunky men are the best. ill take that dad bod. 
---
That spot is great. Have you seen the other spot on the other side? Trash compared to this.
---
my point is to allow people to create thematic but viable build. Vigil + Marathon Runner + Sprint burst could be nice.
---
I'm interested to see if they bring a big patch out with the new DLC. Maybe we might get something big like a Legion rework or a ranking fix.

strangely me and my bf prefer this matchmaking. we find both survivor and killers games in less than 30 seconds, solo as well as swf. 
---
I would prefer not. I‚Äôm already triggered by ppl who self care in front of me for the small amount in survival they get right now, not to mention the time waste of self care, and me glaring at them thinking about how I hope they can unhook themselves from then on. 
---
Not sure if you're replacing Dwight with Bill or Trapper.
---
Vigil + Marathon + Lithe + dance with me would be amazing. if marathon existed.

I love the game and hate treatment

Yeah, I'd like this even without the cosmetics. I just love exclusives I think hahaha

It really is. Imagine your buddy is on his first hook and your stuck 10 meters from him while some random is crouched by the hatch. Good times!

Imagine thinking doc is worse than legion, let alone one with frank's

Oh wow who knew they let cancerous tumors in

Damn kinda liked the removing totems part but whatever
---
Well yeah, it eat guys.

me w my spirit

yea 'cause for it would allow you in specific situations to run for 8s without marks
---
i run bbq, ruin, enduring, spirit's fury. i swap spirit's for monitor and abuse when using dead rabbit add-on or bamboozle when i am tired of getting looped. 
---
Eh I guess. It might just be TF2's cartoony artstyle that makes it easier to make out shapes but I think you could've upped the brightness by 20 or 30.

The corn maps would not be ready for this build

I literally said the same thing in my head, went to comment and read it. Take a useless internet point.
---
Less than $3 for BBQ shrine nerds 
---
Nah, toolboxes are Viagra.
---
the point of *No you* would be to allow survivor to escape when they are hidden ear the gen they were on and the killer kick it before searching for the survivors. 
---
The killer can decide to not kick generators anymore once he knows someone is using the perk. Anyway kicking every gens you  come across is not always the good strat 'cause it does not impact much the progress imo.
---
Stridor does literally nothing about footstep audio, my friend. Just because there's a perk that can help with a different aspect of tracking doesn't mean that footsteps should be silent, especially when there's no indication that this is an intended change.

Seriously, how is this not a thing yet?! :(
---
Hey vsauce it Micheal here!
---
You know you cant get away from me!
---
A Survivor afraid of me, the Killer?
---
Maybe you're right, but I doubt it.
---
Bbq, ruin, sloppy, and nurses. You cant stay injured against a spirit, and forcing a long time to heal gives you a big advantage.
---
If only they made like Freddy an S tier killer for April fools or something that would have definitely been a surprise.
---
Balanced landing and dead hard...are you new?
---
I‚Äôm just trying to be empathetic dude. In the heat of the moment I can totally understand them coming back and being like, ‚Äúshit my game started‚Äù and then being upset enough to type out a rash comment about them being toxic
---
To be fair, we won't make it to end game if you don't do any god damn generators
---
Devour hope quickly removes the 3 hit thing though. 
---
Glad to see someone who can speak like an adult. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm really mind blown by that....haha
---
I also love your play style and LOVE playing against that type of killer. I do basically similar ‚Äúgimmicks‚Äù depending on the Killer aim using. For instance with Huntress, I try to play true to her Lore. I usually save one female survivor for last and either Mori her (to keep her with me always and to give a nod to the fact that The Huntress can never seem to keep her ‚Äúchildren‚Äù alive and always inevitably kills them somehow.) or let her escape. As a Meg main, I specifically like to show mercy to Meg players.

If I play The Pig, And there‚Äôs a Tapp. HE MUST DIE. Unless some bs happens to him obviously or he turns out to be a god and then it‚Äôs just a matter of giving him some damn Respect because Christ some of these Tapp players make me wonder....(I get bullied by Tapp a lot) 
---
If Im Michael I obviously will harass but not kill Laurie‚Äôs. (Although otherwise I usually will kill Laurie first lol) 
---
I do agree that the Devs are maybe going in the wrong direction here. It is harder. The majority of my problems come from bugs. Plain and simple. Perks not working, powers not working, lag, me getting insane hits on survivors, me missing stupidly easy hits on survivors, etc. I think was meant to help survivors more thank Killers. Honestly it is so much easier to get points playing killer than it is Survivor. And now this forces survivors to participate more and be more flexible vs playing safe and immersed the whole time. Killers are feeling the harsher effects, but I don‚Äôt think that will last forever. It‚Äôs a matter of adapting from us and also finding the right balance from the Devs. Who really need to start making some better decisions because they are killing this game. 
---
I do think they will tweek it a bit soon. I believe the primary goal was to start preventing people who don‚Äôt deserve to be High Rank from getting there so easily now. The Ranking system is there for balance at the very least. And since matchmaking is so broken right now, it‚Äôs also the only thing really keeping the game from imploding. While I may be getting weird match ups, everyone does seem to be about the same skill level and therefore on a more even play field, so it‚Äôs hard to complain for me. 
---
HUGE win for inclusivity!
---
Ate dinner, came back and another 35 minutes later still in queue. Something must be wrong...
---
Honestly, dead hard, mettle of man when Ash drops tomorrow, adrenaline and maybe decisive so if you get caught your friends can bum rush the hook and he'll likely tunnel you and you get a free stun on him

that bug sucks =(

Well, I mean it can‚Äôt never spawn there. But yah that happens sometimes. That‚Äôs why I prefer to run better perks like ones that make chases easier. I run enduring and I know others do to, however a lot of people that run it are still stupid and respect pallets.

LOL Frenesi, no habia visto el juego en espa√±ol.

Awww, c'mon, what's wrong with Legion??

If you can't see how the power and perks are broken you must be incredibly killer sided, exposing a survivor AND increasing your movement speed just because they're near you is just dumb and not only are they exposed and your faster but you know exactly where they are
---
The first perk, taking away the survivors only defense is just stupid I don't have to say anything else
---
The second perk, punishing survivors for completing a generator is ridiculous and the amount of speed they lose is wayyyy to much 
---
The third perk, kicking a generator happens multiple times throughout a game meaning that there essentially is no more stealth and the killer would know where people are at all times
---
The first perk is like having a survivor perk that makes it so when a killer hooks a survivor they can't hit
---
You wanna Dwight cranberry

Right?

Probably around noonish EST that's when the new chapters usually get released.
