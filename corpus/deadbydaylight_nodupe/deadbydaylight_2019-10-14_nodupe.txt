OK, just wondering
---
---
---
You really should continue making comics if you want to because this is amazing. Your art style looks great and I'd love to see more of you on this sub reddit.
---
And then the bubba quit and never came back
---
It was over for you regardless they brought in deja vu
---
Niche use of Deliverance giving you an apparent 3 minute period to unhook yourself whenever you feel like it.
---
Looks like a photo, good job for her
---
gotta go love dbd
---
It's how it hooked me. I've since bought all the dlc on PS4 and the base game on PC and Switch. I'm straight addicted.
---
This is awesome! 
---

---
What's your DAW? I can hear so many instruments that my pro tools would explode!
---
Why am I suddenly turned on
---
 Here!
---
Looks cool.
---
Yeah, that's true, she's definitely one of the better killers for anti tunneling, so maybe that's a hole in my argument, but I nonetheless see a lot of idiots that not only play as her, but also run Make Your Choice, who still choose to camp and tunnel. Me personally, I don't really put much thought into any of my perks or add ons, I just slap stuff on and go, I could probably at least 3K with her naked at this point.
---
As far as whether I try hard and kill everyone or just goof off jump scaring people but letting them all live (assuming they help themselves live), it mostly depends on the first five minutes of the match, I just match my skill with the survivors I'm dealing with. I don't know why I'm like that on Amanda specifically, she's the only killer I do that on for some reason. Well, maybe Ghostface as well, but I don't have nearly as many hours on him.

Try me bitch
---
If it was OG freddy sure but 2011 remake freddy would 100% cry
---
Oh I completely misread. Lmao
---
I double you kiddo eat it
---
So you're complaining about "toxicity" and then responded to me insulting me and saying "if you had more than two braincells"? You're being professionally offended at this point, just pathetic. Think about the teabags as you cry yourself to sleep about it.
---
Look at my karma v yours
---
Go back to Overwatch, kid. This game is too violent for you.
---
Fuck you old dude I'll be weak if I wanna
---
Lol man's will hste for literally no reason
---
just gotta go love dbd
---
Honestly though, why are moris in the game..??? Having an ability which means after 1 hook ur dead isn‚Äôt fun or balanced. It doesn‚Äôt even really pip you, it‚Äôs just an offering people use to piss people off or do daily‚Äôs.
---
You should
---
*bubba cackling in the distance*
---
Crying in the club right now
---
In an ideal reset, it allows pairing of expirenced survivors with nonexperienced survivors, to show them the ropes a little better. Or to see a killer who might know a higher rank trick, so you can plan and adapt as you rank up. Ideally.
---
This is proven pointless with discords and video tutorials and sfw's who show tricks lower ranked friends.
---
It also allows for people who don't play as often to fall behind, when new strats or perks are created. So they can relearn the ways of the fog without try hard high ranks.... Ideally.
---
However this could be done with a passive timer. Not playing = a slow rank bleed sort of thing.
---
This is missing an "I lived" titlecard when it fades to black
---
Spirit takes skill
---
Wait really? So it only doesn't apply to pig? That's super weird.
---
Sure but you also become dead weight to your team because you can't do anything for an entire 4 minutes and nobody can unhook you so you can help make progress on gens/gates unless you run Deliverance to guarantee you unhook yourself. 
---
Which also means if you're found first you're very likely just dead because 4%.
---
If you ever make more adorable comics I will gladly read them all!
---
I am so glad you get information about stuff like We'll make it and Borrowed time now. This happens only when people don't know what the perk does.
---
First.. It‚Äôs still Sunday for me so chill the fuck out. Second.. when I say ‚ÄúI never understood the hate‚Äù that‚Äôs a personal opinion it doesn‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any possible reason or any of the reasons why it‚Äôs a hated map.‚Äù I‚Äôm literally implying that me.. personally.. didn‚Äôt align with the consensus of most of the hate. This genuinely hurts to say but god damn don‚Äôt be so fucking robotic. Third.. you ACTUALLY waited till the next day in your time zone to fucking try and ram your opinion down my throat again?! Whatever the hell has gone wrong in your life/your day that you thought this was necessary and felt the need to continue this.. fix it.. because it damn well isn‚Äôt healthy.
---
how you missed the opportunity to make the top hat a tru3talent hat is beyond me
---
Enduring
---
Yeah, its a recurring meme that Behavior thinks pig is the most OP killer and every other killer is balanced
---
I would like to point out that a game shouldn't be balanced around the best of the best, professional top-tier players. It's more likely with them that they've learned to game the problems and don't want them fixed, but the ultimate point of a non competitive multiplayer game shouldn't be the min-maxing and perfect time management.
---
I was one of those people
---
Lmao that happens way more often than the person actually does it properly.
---
This has me WHEEZING
---
Suzie needs freaking I swear to god, she sounds like she's about to have a heart attack at the campfire
---
Often i get tunneled while using it, so i would add a BP boost, Exhaustion recover, and immunity 2 thana
---
?
---
Grats killer keep up the good work for the entity. Oh and a quick explain match making = shyte
---
YEAHHH BUDDY
---
Just watched it last night two and forgot how ridiculous it is
---
You can escape but meanwhile say farewell to your fucking legs
---
And you had party streamers...
---
Nuuuuuuuuuu
---
He is a tier down
---
Don't worry. It took me like 6 months before I figured it out.
---
Same with Plague and Wraith
---
I‚Äôm so glad someone else noticed.
---
thats when you get chased by killer and you run while looking back.
---
I just shared this to everyone I know. That shivering scared Meg hiding behind the wall - haven't we all been her at one time? üò≠
---
Send photo
---
you guys don‚Äôt remember the Chapter: *Vommy Mommy*?
---
She just looking behind her so she knows when to use dead hard
---
One of the best games I got from plus!
---
What
---
Honestly I'm glad a stealth killer is actually quiet
---
I would love color blind mode too, because at night I turn down the blue on monitor and it's so bloody hard to see, well, blood.
---
Also, I'm working on a web site and will be putting in a colorblind theme for users.
---
when you see the ruin totem while in a chase
---
Some guy I played with today had the killer chase him and then pointed to the locker I was in, I have no idea why, he just got downed and I got away
---
Lol
---
The rest of his fans (including me) are embarrassed by them...
---
Real talk, who actually cares
---
**We'll**
---
**Be**
---
**Right**
---
**Back**
---
‚ÄúThis is an optimal panini build‚Äù
---
This stuff is hilarious XD I love these memes as they are funny and for a good cause
---
Billy working on joining the Ministry of Silly Walks, I see.
---
It's funny. With a lot of killers Behaviour could easily make them top tier by just making certain add-ons base ability. For example:
---
Make Flask of Bleach and Pinky Finger add-ons base for Clown. Done. Now he's fine.
---
At least they tried.
---
Our favorite athlete! She looks so cool. What is your favorite Killer to go against so far?
---
MAN you have to make more these are sick. Would love to see a Ghostface/PIG one
---
I mean they have the kill your friends option for a reason
---
Nah man if you facecamp it's cause you trash you deserve those tbags
---
&gt;But yeah let's jump to never having any progression because of characters not having perks attached to them
---
What is Truetalent most afraid of?  Prayer beads Spirit, omega blink Nurse, or shirts with sleeves?
---
Following that, she finally turns to me, but given that the survivors' body can actually obscure the killer's body, preventing the reveal phase, it took her 3 seconds to realize Ghost Face is starin' her down
---
I love Unbreakable plays. Sure, you don‚Äôt always get a pick up out of it but even the increased recovery is huge, especially in SWF. Nicely done. (:
---
I guess this is what happens when you‚Äôre the the number 1 most viewed DBD content creator. You get a small portion of your fanbase that turn into gatekeepers.
---
what if you Tbagg a Ghost face, he gets you and Tbaggs back until you bleed out.
---
Looks awesome
---
I want this one in the game so bad. Lol.
---
Amen, dude. Lol.
---
Well I mean you're Freddy so that makes sense
---
And as an experienced killer you should try to teach the baby survivors a few basics after asserting your friendliness or in post chat lobby
---
1) Love the art. It looks great and has a nice mood to it. 
---
2) I love and respect that you just totally own being a Meghead.
---
You feel great when you both get out
---
Feel okay when you or they die but you tried hard
---
just upset that you or the random got killed through something dumb
---
I hate how being toxic and gatekeeping is the norm in the community
---
Not really, if all survivors simply wait around immersed the killer literally gets nothing out of corrupt. Unless they're trapper. Nothing gets done, sure, but nothing is getting done for the killer either, unless they're specifically a killer that needs to set up.
---
On spirit it is
---
*i need an adult*
---
this is so gay
---
Yikes it smells like survivor in here
---
I say if you really want a perk at a lower tier then don't upgrade the perk. It would be a waste of bloodpoints if you wanted it at tier 1 and you bought tier 2 &amp; 3
---
Meanwhile I get told to kill myself when I play Freddy lol
---
I know, frank is thikk
---
The survivor thought they could know if you were a husk or not by using a flashlight, they saw they werent blinding you, so they thought you were a husk, but alas, you were looking down, you countered a counter, despite what reddits
---
 says, I still say its skill to think of a smart tactic like that.
---
I litteraly got the game a week before it came out on ps plus for $20 and then my friends were like ‚Äúyo it‚Äôs out for free now‚Äù and I cannot tell you how internally raged I was. At least I got Huntress and David for free though
---
I have all the killers and used one of these for fun. I was just wraith (where I got the splinter without perks). So fun
---
Wow
---
Probably because your homosexual
---
Im a fan and im sad about this. The top guy had a genuine interest and the bottom guy shut him down. Gatekeepers arent real fans, they just want to distupt anyones fun
---
No but its something about *H I M*
---
Anytime I‚Äôm playing Survivor and being chased, and a fellow teammate (usually an immersed Claudette) throws a pallet I am running to use. Legitimately the worst. 
---
I am not ashamed to say that if you do that to me and later get hooked, I‚Äôll happily click along on a gen while staring at your dumb hooked self. üòÇ
---
I hope you continue to make more comics, this is so cute and delightfully refreshing to see in a sub that consists mainly of shitposts :)
---
Watch Fungoose games as Plague he's a plague main and is super intelligent currently he's on a 105 win streak (4ks) with her on twitch it's crazy. (Not 105 wins in a row I mean 105 without losing as her) he plays other killers too
---
To be continued
---
Nice, definitely not the hundredth time I‚Äôve seen!
---
Why do you even play this game if you hate it that much.
---
the pig! one of my matches, I was doing a generator, looked behind me, and there she was, body blocking me so she could easily kill me. it was probably really gratifying for the player, and it scared me to death!
---
Dont be so toxic, this was a smart mindgame.
---
This happened in red ranks....
---
I‚Äôm gonna disagree with you there chief. If we balance for the mid tier players, we end up with shit like omega blink Nurse. A perfectly fine thing to see in mid level play, where no ones optimal and players don‚Äôt really know how to maximize the effectiveness of the tools at their disposal, but an absolute nightmare to deal with at the highest tier of play where everyone knows exactly what their doing after thousands of hours of experience and it basically becomes a win button
---
This but a comic please
---
Predator would be proud of wraith
---
Dude you're so fucking talented, I genuinely believe you should be in charge for music for Dead By Daylight, I loved the Spirit one and this one is just as good. Can't wait for more of these!
---
I'm seeing hotdogs...reese's...doritos...a kinder....egg.........I just....

I have no reason to stay around the hook. Especially if I'm playing Hillbilly or Spirit.
---
Freddy would laugh at the shouter.
---
Yeah it's ridiculous the amount of detail and ambient sounds that everything has in the game with a good headset. It's awesome on certain maps especially the ambient sounds on yomokoas estate, for example. The bamboo sticks when they move in the distance sound like wind chimes for example. As a survivor, I can hear stealth killers breathing before they're near me, I can hear them wind up their attacks sooner and make them miss hits easier without having to look back as often and as a killer it makes having stridor in my loadout useless since I can already hear exactly where everyone is at within my TR.
---
A good headset is definitely worth saving for in the long run for any game.
---
Wait what is this? I‚Äôm slowly getting back into dbd.
---
Why you talking to yourself brah?
---
I agree...thanks
---
1) thank you so much!!! that means a lot
---
2) i wear my badge of honor (shame) with pride!
---
I've only ever done this once as an experiment right when new Dying Light came out in order to keep the obsession busy. I felt pretty dirty after ngl.
---
100% true. 
---
Little unknown fact about Scoops‚Äô base kit. Messaging the killer that you have free ice cream for them moderately increases the chance of mercy.
---
Console or pc?
---
I didn't know if they stuck around after the DC so I was hoping to get some answers.
---
This was before the endgame collapse change I risked my life to save a Nea who was on hook.
---
After all the generators had finished I had a reverse bear trap on by the way
---
Both the open exit gate and hatch relatively close to the hook and both me and the Nea where it was.
---
However my last two boxes were all the way on the other side of the map and I had about 40 seconds left if even that. So I saved Nea assuming that she would immediately leave so I can get hatch.
---
Nope she proceeds to butt dance the pig near the exit gate until I die and then sprint bursts to the hatch.
---
Just to add insult to injury I had saved her with seconds left before she had actually died so if I had just let her ass die I could have just gotten hatch.
---
I forgot the cardinal rule of Horror Screw Billy,  Billy is dead don't go back for them.
---
Right here
---
Shit like that is exactly why I‚Äôve been levelling him up. I used to do that with Pig but it‚Äôs just not the same.. I‚Äôm missing out lol
---
I think it is because Hillbilly does his mori from a little bit behind the survivor. So although you had just escaped, he was still able to get the prompt to mori you for a split because his mori starts from behind the survivor.
---
I feel like demogorgon should be below the rest in his own section titled ‚ÄúPerhaps‚Äù
---
Same
---
I know it's not helpful, but some people are just dicks. Try not to let it get to you.
---
Can I use this perk in a compilation of fan made ideas? Credits would of course go to you
---
The one thing that truely is an  exact copy of legion from in the game is the broken rulerüòÇ
---
Demogorgon is pig confirmed
---
They're mad until they realize the killers a content creator
---
What in God's name is on your profile?
---
Awwww üò≠ so freakin adorable
---
Since when did people start hating on Self-Care? I thought it used to be like, THE perk to run
---
Not talking about baby Dweets.
---
Most actual Dwight mains I encountered tend to be complete assholes
---
This might be my favourite dbd montage ever.
---
0:52 imagining Freddy saying "come on" as he misses had me laughing my ass off.
---
If its clear that somebody is new then I'll try but if they repeatedly miss my very obvious ''come with me'' sign language then there's nothing to do but leave them for dead
---
They're adding a new menu with more lore and collectibles (I think) as well as a cosmetics-only battlepass type system with challenges that provide you with bp. Theres a free side to it as well but not as many cosmetics.
---
3 second chances and a mute button?
---
Sorry you‚Äôre having a bad day today man lmao it‚Äôll be okay.
---
For perks: hag and leatherface
---
For having fun: Michael Myers, Ghostface, Legion
---
For winning: Spirit, Huntress
---
Nah, Id get more points from people killing themselves on,HOOK VS DCing.  As Survivor, both are still gonna be annoying but someone DCing has caused me far more than someone killing themselves on Hook has...
---
Had a game against a Wraith. It comes down to me and a Claudette, with one gen left to go. The Claudette had already been hooked once, so when I saw her getting chased I figured I‚Äôd take a hit for her since I always looking out for my teammates. I body block for her and lead the Wraith away thinking she‚Äôd use the time to do the last gen and open an exit. Time goes by and nothing happens, then Wraith eventually downs me and I see Claudette just sitting on the hatch. (I‚Äôd passed it while being chased and took note of it‚Äôs location just in case.) The Wraith hooks me like ten feet away while Claudette hides in a locker,  and then the Claudette lets me get one hooked so she could get the hatch. 
---
Had another game once where I got hooked in the basement, and no one came to get me so I started struggling. The killer eventually brought a second survivor down there, and soon as they left one of our other teammates immediately ran down and unhooked them. They then proceeded to heal them right in front me, letting me die.
---
It was free in August when I turned 21. I‚Äôll never forget
---
I guess you have never seen me then &lt;3
---
Identity V does this and it's pretty fun
---
Thanks for the knowledge
---
Im hoping theyll be setup to were the killer can choose his perks, he automatically recieves his 3 unique perks if isnt setup, or if the killer is setup he gets the perks on his setup, but out of all of these id prefer to choose the perks, but for fairness i feel like the 3 unique perks would sound right for the offering
---
Right here my friend
---
What in the cinnamon toast fuck
---
I love this, if you make more please share them &lt;3
---
There are 130+ perks in Dead By Daylight at this point.
---
It is well past time the shrine increased in size. At least double imo. 4 survivor and 4 killer each week.
---
*impossible*
---
Go ahead dude. Long as i get credit idk who uses it.
---
Very Cool! We were all once noobs
---
Just a question. Do you still get a token if someone Kobe's or deliverance?
---
I mean you could report that to xbox too. If they get enough reports they will get looked into at least
---
Poor, Feng. Hopefully she gets it back!
---
Casual game that still has a competitive system.
---
Which is it? Because it seems like their idea of shoehorning a competitive system into a casual game is backfiring
---
I'll never take Ashy Slashy off my Ash!  He helps us all,out üòà
---
First match after rank reset two people had No Mither
---
To answer, no you can't. Bigger question is why would you wanna teleport to a CI gen?
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of survivors who can‚Äôt play against spirit, DC
---
Autodidact literally means "self taught"
---
I mean technally it is
---
Since the last patch. Just another bug that's come up. They'll probably fix it soon.
---
Hey OP, I really love this idea, and I've been compiling fan ideas lately. I wanted to get your permission to use it, with credit given to you
---
The comic is very good, I'd love to see more of your work if possible.
---
Any of crypt tvs monsters would be cool
---
Happy cake day and thank you!
---
It's free?! That explains why everyone in my Discord channel is Playstation, while I am the sole PC player... D:
---
We were all new once, be kind to others, people!
---
Great comic btw, so cute and well made!
---
Been playing as ghostface and wanted 1 spirit game before I went to bed and that happens. Really annoying considering queue times and the fact I don‚Äôt get much time to play the game atm
---
It's Rank Reset...you already pointed that out, people troll &amp; fuck around more on Rank Reset, usually it's better to let a dsy go,by and avoid the chaos that Rank Reset ALWAYS has brought
---
REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It was only free for a month last year, not permanently free on the store
---
That mask looks wonderful and omg that hair! So beatiful. Great work!
---
Would I be able to use these perks in a fan made ideas compendium, with credits going to you
---
People don‚Äôt want to face misses no counters (not including iron will).
---
She WAS the object of obsession
---
I try to help newbies, but in the end after I save them, they abandon my ass...
---
And tbh... I did the same thing
---
Oh shoot that‚Äôs cool
---
this is fucking adorable. thank you so much for making this. i love you
---
Kek
---
This isn't a PS4 specific thing.... PC is FULL of these type of players
---
just sounds like No Mither v2 tbh
---
What have you got already if anything?
---
They were never gonna scrap it
---
It did 6 Shrines ago!
---
We need to get charlie to play Dead by Daylight
---
I guess not. In any case, its strictly cosmetic so it's not that big a deal. And you make back all the auric cells you pay to get it if you finish
---
Get Leatherface for bbq and chili perk, 2x blood points per game and nice aura vision. Hag is also recommended for ruin or clown for pop goes to weasel these perks slow the game down. After that you can buy whoever you like the most.
---
i would say that you should get Clown or Michael if you don't want freddy
---
No, as it‚Äôs practically unenforceable
---
Had a match like this where a Claudette DCed, leaving an Ash, and a baby Jake + David. I let them farm, as in 50% of my killer games, someone DCs or suicides, which I spare them by double hooking them letting them go. The Ash became AFK too, so we hook farmed him twice, then I slugged him for the other two to heal. 
---
The Jake and David were rank 20s, and they kept on blowing up the gens, which was really cute. Sadly, Ash never came back after his AFK, so I put him next to hatch, but I had to close it as the End Game Collapse Timer concluded.
---
So if all of you guys are here why are my fucking queue times so long?
---
Foody: You eat a snack and move 50% slower for 5/4/3 seconds after which you heal to full health, causes exhaustion for 90/70/50 seconds.  
---
Prepared for a Picnic: create a small area where other survivors can heal over 12/10/8 seconds.  Disappears after 2 health states has been used.  Can be used once per match.  
---
Recipe for Disaster: While a survivor is hooked, you gain 10/15/20% speed for healing, gen repair, altruistic actions, and vaulting speed.  Lasts until survivor is unhooked or minimum 20 seconds.
---
It's much healthier for the game now though because one Survivor doesn't have the Killer up their ass with a Mori.
---
Now it just needs some number buffs and small adjustments.
---
That's called being a complete and utter dick tbh, how much of a horrible player are you where you need to gain the advantage of sniping the stream. It's not just bad conduct but means you're a shit player
---
This would be a good lore-plot in Dead By Daylight, like a survivor could be scared, but found the courage to help others like this :D
---
I never thought that the entity had a gender but, the entity has never showed any signs of creating life. So I think it's a dude.
---
I feel you, I hate facing plague, and it‚Äôs the only time I actually want to dc (I never do tho)
---
Thanks
---
Oink
---
I'm not sure that name checks out
---
Leather face and Meg would be cool as well
---
Devour hope instead of make your choice. With pig‚Äôs intrinsic game slowing devour can very easily get 5 stacks with a build like that
---
Sometimes people do it too early and I still hit them. It's not really a good perk to begin with, though. Most good killers know how to counter it, and it typically only adds 5-20 seconds to a chase.
---
you know that it is kinda stupid, bc you can get it out of the shrine if you are patieant and have luck (bbq pop goes and so on)
---
 Gen were done so quickly Killers wouldn't usually have to rely on slow down builds so often
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm an Ash main
---
I made a edit
---
I think it's adorable that you are reaching this much lol. A mildly sarcastic criticism of your favorite game in the whole wide world is apparently all it takes to trigger you, eh?
---
Not to mention practically unprovable.
---
I feel like the anger is warranted, dcing should have a harsher penalty
---
that is kinde the killer where most people disconnect
---
Never give up. Either they do it or a better game will come along eventually!
---
Yeah but survivor isn‚Äôt all about winning chases, wasting killers time while gens are being done is the aim for me. She‚Äôs only 110 too so prelonging that first hit as long as possible is pretty good counter in my books, you can easily play scratch mark mind games before you get hit. I actually quite enjoy playing against spirits, hillbilly‚Äôs too
---
It is bannable, but it cant be proven, so it may as well not be
---
The devs did host an official tournament and it was a glorious train wreck
---
With Michelle Pfeiffer as Meg, Stephen Root as Ace, Roy Orbison as Jake, and Shub Nigguarth, the Black Goat of the Woods, as Nea.
---
I barely ever see that happen in my games as her and against her. She's the strongest killer rn with decent perks too. Imo she's the best bang for your buck.
---
NGL those perks kinda big gay
---
EVERYONE WINS
---
As an Australian. I give you permission to say cunt
---
When that happens I just drop the survivor repeatedly until they struggle out because that‚Äôs bs
---
I use it because you can't always rely on people.
---
Could I use some of these perks in a fan made idea compilation? I would credit you as well
---
Ok I‚Äôm fine with that.
---
Ultra Rare Nea addon
---
Not that rank matters really but I feel there should be a safety net for killer/survivor for people who Dc so you guarantee safety pip
---
Love the comic, so adorable.
---
yeah r you on Xbox?
---
You'd love Old Freddy. I used to slow the game down to the point survivors would start quitting. 50% slow from being asleep, an extra 25% from Swing Chains, another 25% from Dying Light, as well as Thanataphobia and Ruin.
---
Sometimes killers have got to slow the game down just a lotta bit. 
---
If Thanatophobia bothers you so much then cleanse!
---
I know, I was just messing with ya :P
---
Dwight kinda reminds me of that cursed baby dwight that was on the sub a few weeks back.
---
I love the idea that the all-powerful Entity freaks the fuck out if you throw rocks at it.
---
no problem ^^
---
...explain what you mean when you say ‚Äúnever having any progression on characters because they don‚Äôt have perks attached to them‚Äù
---
That's how I got hooked on DBD. It was free on PS plus and I was getting tired of COD zombies lol. Now I've completely shifted to PC ever since my boyfriend built me a gaming PC. I am ADDICTED.
---
Literally the first time I fought wraith I freaked out then I started playing killer more and I was like ‚Äúdamn... he sucks‚Äù lol
---
And here‚Äôs me suspended from psn for a week because I called a camping bubba a lil bitch. I swear Sony don‚Äôt check when the reports go in they just start suspending/banning people
---
You say that this sub is ‚Äúkiller good survivor bad‚Äù yet look at the comments of this post. People are losing their shit over somebody playing spirit. Are they‚Äôre sensitive killers on this sub? Yes, but saying that the sub consists of only killer mains is just ignorant.
---
I love this. Thank you.
---
I usually tend to dip the moment the exit gates are poweted because i pretty much suck at saving people and theres usually a noed, but whenever i see a baby (insert literally any survivor here) my heart melts and i just have to help them, good thing that im a meg main and i always have me sprint burst ready, saved me so many times after saving babies lol
---
I‚Äôd agree with you if it was a bad meme, but the picture is hilarious
---
He asked who to buy. So i recommended killers with most viable perks. It's his decision if he gets them or not. He still can wait till it appears in shrine, but according to what i know bbq appeared only 3-4 times and if he decides to play and doesn't have bbq he will lose much more time farming bp.
---
No don't make it easier to rank up. I just play casually and somehow I get to high ranks. it just gets less fun and more toxic
---
The pig I assume
---
He's talking rank emblems not boldness
---
I have exactly the same model on my head right now :P. I don't play Spirit though, too easy.
---
I literally sacrificed myself today to save a new player.  I'm pretty new myself but it sucked to see a new new player getting camped and tunneled. Took one for the team and everyone escaped other than me.
---
Looks like Quentin's little brother
---
It's a snowball perk it's practically useless if you're not snowballing and can be very devastating if you are.
---
Also on killers who can either have natural slow down (Freddy) or something that could keep the obsession busy (Piggy/Legion) it's also really good
---
He do be mid-low tier but I love me boy nontheless
---
**Inconspicuous:**
---
You have a knack for blending in with the crowd, after failing a skillcheck, block scratchmarks and bloodtrails within a 5/10/20meter range of the failed action for 5/6/7 seconds
---
*"Oop--"*
---
**Aware:**
---
You tend to keep track of your footing, you enter lockers and slow vault windows 10/20/30% faster and *slightly* reduce the noises made by doing so.
---
*"It's the little things you need to look out for, one wrong step and you could be in a world of trouble"*
---
**Lash Out:**
---
You've had enough, after getting hit 5/4/3 times **Lash Out** activates. Landing a successful pallet stun will *break* the pallet and in turn increase the stun time by 2/3/4 seconds.
---
*"I'm sick of this shit!"*
---
"ThE EnTiTy cAn tOrTuRe pEoPlE To kIlL!"
---
I'd honestly just say the Entity is generally walled off from reality and has to take whatever it can get. The murder was just what decided Killer instead of Survivor.
---
But that's already putting more effort into the lore than BHVR does.
---
Ah yes, because I slept before your reply, I must have waited until the next day to reply myself.
---
Couldn't possibly be that your reply was past 12am my time now could it, I couldn't have possibly been in bed sleeping already and only able to reply once I woke.
---
I'm robotic because I don't allow emotion in analysis and explanation, the second you do it becomes personal and thus invalid, you must remain objective when talking about things like balance and fairness.
---
The only way the game will grow healthily is if we criticise what is wrong with it and suggest ways in which to improve that.
---
Green pointy hat broom riding poison apple witch?
---
Yes!
---
I don't blame you.
---
This is cute as hell. Glad you two made it out.
---
You seem very enthusiastic, thanks for permission
---
I am an adult.
---
40 or 35
---
Wait, something's only a girl if it creates life?
---
I'm going to have a few questions for my "girl"friend...
---
Of course! That would be awesome to see! Thank you much for finding inspiration in it!
---
Dedicated servers make it extremely buggy because of lag :/ happens w/o servers sometimes
---
Aww this comic is super cute! I do hope you make more if you want to! :D
---
Your welcome :)
---
The Hag pretty much covers that already, but if well done why not?
---
Yup lol but designed the way BHVR wants to design it
---
The fact that ruin is a useless perk when survivors hit great skillchecks makes it NOT the best killer perk in the game. I play both sides and hitting greats is not that hard as long as you‚Äôve played the game a lot.
---
So how is the entire population of r/incels not on the Killer roster?
---
SURPRISE SIDNEY!

I find plague to be very fun, high tier but not dc levels like spirit or nurse, corrupt intervention is a fun alternative to ruin, and the plague herself is just really cool to play

Please do so I may devour their hope.

When the exit gates are open it makes sense for a killer to camp, but there is never a reason to face camp at all. There were plenty of times the killer could've and should've gone for the others at that point, definitely deserving of a tbag.
---
&gt; First and probably last time I'm making a comic lmao 
---
That's definitely a shame. You're good.
---
I appreciate the compliment.
---
That would be pretty cool actually. I'd like to see someone come up with a killer loudout for her
---
I have a big document of fan made ideas and I'm always looking for new opportunities to add more. I eventually plan on sending it to the devs to see if maybe they can be put in the game
---
Detroit! Become criminal
---
Added to list
---
One hook and a dream
---
As a plague main, When I have the black incense I preffer they don't cleanse. That thing with PWYF works really well.
---
Groovy
---
Oh yes! Weapon could be from New Nightmare!
---
That's some awesome work dude. I remember your Spirit music and it was unreal. I also saw the DBD team comment on your YouTube video, praising it and asking to share it. Hopefully they take it to the next level and just hire your ass so we can get this shit in game.
---
I thought Joe's was short for Joseph. Hmm
---
for it to be bannable they have to be streaming themselves watching your stream and admitting to it lmao, not enforceable stop making your name twitch.tv/name
---
Absolutely agree, please do ( ^œâ^ )
---
Yes I actually did escape
---
It's not just spirit, I was playing Wraith yesterday and I had this exact thing happen in 3 of the games. I gave hatch to last player too, it's not their fault and it's a shitty situation for them.
---
xbox game pass did the same thing. free things are great
---
Spirit
---
That was actually really scary looking. I kinda love it
---
Spirit or Fredster, they are a lot of fun.
---
we learn out of our faults, and next time i hope, you will listen to the guy who has more upvotes ;) (or me)+
---
From a killer side, Doctor is a bloodpoint machine, but anyone else who's power is their only good thing. Legion for the stabs, Plague for the Vommy, Billy for chainsaw sprinting, etc. From a survivor standpoint, especially if you want that perfect escape, Plague and Legion specifically, since you get 100 survival points from cleansing (I know that much cause I play her all the time, and did farm quite a bit during the bloodhunt, so survivors told me they got that much for cleansing). Not sure how many you get for mending.
---
Why is she a problem on Xbox? This isn‚Äôt nearly too bad on PS4 what about PC is this a problem there as well?
---
They decreased the audio of that by alot
---
Ghostface then buy spirit for iridescent shards later
---
Where ghost face in a of this???
---
If you like stealth killers I recommend ghost face pretty fun to play as
---
Before EGC, a Claudette ran to the corner of the map where I couldn't hook her cause all the hooks were too far away, she decided to instead of trying to find the hatch (literally next to a hook that I was trying to get to) she decided to bleed out. Then messages me about how much of a noob I was, but rages heavily when I tell her where the hatch was and how she could've just left instead of wasting both of our time
---
How about when you‚Äôre hit it gives you exhaustion for 60 seconds and you take a deep wound then it doesn‚Äôt trigger if you‚Äôre exhausted
---
Freddy! Spirit is good too but alot of people instantly DC when they see a spirit!
---
Honestly I think it was just a chain reaction. I hook one guy and he gets upset that he was hooked first then dc's then the others just don't want to play with one person gone within the first 2 minutes.

---
nope, but Xbox players are the most toxic ones, that disconnect very easily
---
Spirit is fine, if you have prayer beads expect at least one DC.
---
OK, that's nice to know
---
Spirit can be kind of annoying, ngl. That's from a pc and Xbox player. I know people that say they get DC's like they're playing pre-rework Legion
---
Do not spend AC on Freddy, you will still get smoking splinters in bloodwebs. Buy him directly
---
I don't like razors but they're more affordable at the cost of less customizable sound options. I bought up until I settled on my a40's that's in the picture that I took. I absolutely love them and they're wired so I don't have added weight from batteries and a constant feed of sound without sound loss over bluetooth. If you have the money to spare for them you should get them.
---
New Nightmare is my favorite Freddy look it'd be so hype, hopefully with the negotiations for the rights on Switch they can get some new stuff!
---
Mmm, daddy myers üëÖ
---
I had it happen a bit ago as well.
---
Yeah I totally understand it, don‚Äôt blame the DC‚Äôs after the first really. Really hard to come back from a 3v1 early Dc. The game in my clip the 3 were all in a premade too with 1 object rip
---
this is on Xbox, thats why i said him to get Meyers or clown
---
Ahh... I love helping these new scared cuties escape...  
---
I'm usually the one who sacrifices to save others because i'm pretty confident i have enough emblems for safety pip and i don't mind dying tbh.
---
Always. Protect. The. Baby. Megs.
---
Surprisingly the only ones that look entirely normal are Meg, Claudette and Ace.
---
Wait Xbox is the most toxic? I thought that PC was.
---
nope. use your most high levelled character with a 4 purple perk meta build and bully everyone you play against to prove how much better you are at the game than them /s
---
Yeah, I had it too, it sucks
---
Fantastic! üòãüòâ but really, you're not alone. So many people have been posting about this. I am personally not sure how they prioritize it. But since you're not host with ded's live the lag doesn't favor you anymore.
---
I love this so much! Please consider making more comics in the future &lt;3
---
nope, Xbox is a bit more toxic
---
Yes, this is a new feature added with servers. It has been happening consistently. If you are standing on the hatch before it opens, you can just jump uncontested. If the killer hits you, you escape. If he tries to close it, you escape.
---
Yeah at high rank, MYC is at best a slowdown perk to make one survivor chill for 40 seconds or so before going back on gens.
---
I don't play her as much anymore if I'm being honest (mainly a trapper main now). But I don't get why your insulting OP for missing a few lunges and getting lucky with the pallet grab.
---
Otz theory crafts all the time and comes up with new and unique builds. He's not the best sure but it's very naive to say his plays are average. Time does equal skill IF you put in the effort to get better, there are also those who play just as much but don't improve. But that doesn't mean time played doesn't equate to getting better.
---
Ima get myers
---
Honestly, all of those are good options, I personally really like the plague, and ghostface can be fun if played correctly. Spirit is one of the best killers in the game right now if you play her right, Freddy is neat, legion is fun if not competetive. Pig is fun as well. It really come down to wether you want fun or competitive as well as how much you like playing stealth killers. Tldr: plague is my personal favorite but all of them are good choices
---
Look on the bright side you Technically Won.
---
But it's like a good dirty yes?
---
This is cute as fuck
---
This is obi just a bug with that one game, calm down
---
I bought it the month before it was freeüòîüòî
---
As someone who only plays both of these games. Dbd is 10000x more toxic
---
I have the same idea actually. I have a compiled a document of my ideas as well to send to the devs
---
DBD easily.
---
Ghostface is really fun if you like stealth, I still have a hard time utilizing his stalk, but I like sneaking up on people.
---
Games pass gang represent, naw but my little brother got it on ps+ forever ago
---
Mann I hate that. Like your gettin chased by the killer an you jus see a lil dwight hiding in the corner behind a tree an his lil head peeking out.
---
I would save for a new killer
---
you r doing fine, just get far away of the gen except you see someone
---
Honestly, ice noticed Dead by Daylight isnt as toxic as people claim. Not saying there isnt toxicity, because there definetly is, but it isnt as bad as everyone claims. Here's my reasoning 
---
- Being Toxic can be accidental. I've T-Bagged at my fellow survivors in greeting without noticing the killer right away, which appears toxic but isnt actually 
---
- Being toxic has been associated to things that arent toxic, such as using certain perks, items, add ons, or even just pallet looping a killer 
---
- Many mainstream youtubers and streamers play toxically, play what people claim is toxic, or claim to be toxic themselves. 
---
- Not as many people actually fit these in general. Toxic players stand out, making them seem more abundant then they actually are
---
One of the reasons I hate that map.
---
Mainly two things:
---
 I usually try to evade going for the 3 gen strat, I've only played like that a couple of times and all of them ended up becoming really tedious patience game.
---
 If I go against extremely toxic players, I tend to stop playing the match. I don't DC, I simply go AFK and drink/eat something.
---
I know I shouldn't really do that but I just love how insane the post-game chat gets.
---
Oh, I play Xbox and don't get that many angry messages, guess I'm lucky.
---
&gt;Think of what a new player feels 
---
don‚Äôt see how that parts relevant but ok 
---
id guess it‚Äôll be fixed soon since it could affect the sale of the skin
---
Ayoooo
---
If Ruin's still up after I destroyed a team ill usually bring the last guy and let him break it while I find the hatch for him. If it's a close game though and I'm trying to rank up I'll just hook them though. Honestly, I like giving the last guy hatch and would do it every game, but as long as a hatch escape means an automatic black pip at red ranks then my hands are kind of tied.
---
Easily DBD. I‚Äôve had my life threatened more times than I can count playing this game, the worst I ever get from Siege is the occasional salty Hackusation
---
welp, some people disconnect on Meyers too, but just very few
---
I got him
---
Please make more
---
this is so wholesome and cute, i love it
---
welp, have fun
---
You can wait at the gate and heal to make the killer waste time forcing you out and/or farm for extra points. But don't just sit there teabagging like an asshole it just lets the world know you aren't comfortable with your penis size
---
thats cool for you
---
I'll post the results
---
Haha, that's generous. But it's technically not a glitch. You gotta wait for the animation to finish. For flashlight saves as well.
---
I found a l perk lvl 20 David hiding in a locker so I hid in the locker next to him.  A minute later we escaped together while another player was being hard camped.  (I was injured and the David didn‚Äôt know how to heal me).
---
DBD easily. It‚Äôs harder to stop it in daylight, where Ubisoft has added features to deal with toxicity. You can‚Äôt really punish tea baggers and flashlight clickers unfortunately
---
From the perspective of a survivor main I'd say ghostface, I feel like we've already lost if we're up against a ghostface lol üòÜ
---
They'll likely fix it once the event actually starts.
---
I get so much nostalgia for the Christmas theme since I first started playing in December 2017. It was also visually so cool. Hopefully the touch up the Winter Solstice this year since the 2018 one looked pretty bad because of the engine update.
---
Yeah, she's definitely a hard killer to go against. I recommend using Spine Chill if you have it. It's really good against spirit because you can tell if she's looking at you or not while she's phasing, prevents mind games and pallet grabs.
---
Do we wanna combine them?
---
I swear Devour will either completely carry your game or be straight up useless. I've only had like 3-4 games ever where I only get one with the exposed before they break it, and I tried to force Devour into a ton of builds when I was starting out
---
oh wow, the scale of the weapon has an error and will never ever be fixed...feeling so betrayed and disrespected :'(
---
padded jaws with the stone that downs them if they escape is just the best
---
recently got back into the game first game back a guy camped a new player felt so bad second game the killer left bc he was camping and got gen rushed and 3rd game back was against an admittedly good hag and 4th was against a good huntress feels good to be back
---
Karma
---
Depends on the killer. Nurse's you see in first person when you mori someone. Spirit on the other hand, both the killer and survivor see the same 3rd person animation.
---
Back in my day it was Bill from L4D
---
Yeah mori's of any kind usually mean you can only black pip at best
---
Why did I do this?
---
This has happened to me every time I have refreshed my dailies for the past few weeks. Wasn't happening to anyone else I knew though so not sure what's going on here.

Hag is better and has hex ruin
---
Exactly. Kids these days...
---
one of my bestest friends i met because of this game they were new and played killer i made a stupid mistake and messaged them and we became friends and the 2 best DBD players in our group of friends lol (ngl they have helped me through depressing times and i've helped them and idk what i would do without them)
---
Hag's a girl. It's not hate she just wants a piece of the S C O O P S
---
I'm not insulting them! I'm just giving them constructive criticism.
---
equality for all gamers!
---
LOOOL
---
I really dont find hag fun to play at all lmao worst killer in fun factor
---
Ghostface is fun if you just don't use his power, something like [truetalent build](https://youtu.be/a6GgTR8N1LI) is actually hella fun to play since marking takes so long.
---
Clown is fun honestly
---
Adrenaline
---
You're a madlad and a half if you go bodyblock for your teammates when everybody is Exposed. Especially when there's a fair to good chance they get out for free with DS even if they go down
---
I feel this
---
Did slug myers before monto smh
---
Since you can't buy licensed killers with iridescent gems, that leaves Hag, Clown, Legion, Plague and Spirit as your options.
---
Hag for hex ruin
---
Spirit is arguably the best killer of the game after nurse rework.
---
Legion grants lots of points but needs a rework.
---
Plague has a unique playstile and imo is very fun to play.
---
Difficult to make a case for Clown right now, but I like him.
---
after the game, the points are added
---
Then go play another game and stop buying cosmetics...Because the devs dont know about this and they are not going to fix it, totally....
---
She won't miss the wig and mask
---
By far my favorite perk on GF. No one ever truly expects it and when it goes off, BAM! Everyone is running trying to stop me üòàüòàüòà
---
I spot an NA pig main Pepega
---
I just think it‚Äôs funny how serious and angry you are at this
---
Hard to be kind when you see a ton of retarded shit low ranks do.
---
Saying you would teabag them for missing isn't constructive criticism. It's just you being a dick.
---
so no worries
---
Shut up looser
---
Uh not sure what to make of your username...
---
I didn't see any other posts talking about it (I'm not on here very much) so I figured I should make a post of my own to see what's up. Glad it's getting talked about though so maybe the devs can address it.
---
They say it's only if their is answers though!
---
Dbd, rainbow six can have some salty people but I get told to kill myself when I'm a killer or survivor every other game.

---
Offering: Blendette Locks
---
Effect: Call upon the Entititty to hide yourself from Survivors. For the duration of the match, you are completely invisible
---
This, sometimes your only option against swf is to gen protect and try to get them all into the injured state. Eventually you'll catch them trying to heal and it's easier than trying to commit to a chase.
---
ü§°
---
üò≥
---
there's probably still a new way to hack this and make it possible.
---
either way, extremely f*cked up
---
We could totally do that. I have 3 put down so far with an idea on a 4th. I think if the devs get enough OG concepts, they would have a lot more to go off of rather than all these licensed killers and survivors.
---
I love that I can go into siege knowing that at least one aspect of my life will be insulted.
---
Yeah, my doc is like 35 pages long, dm me your Google account/email and I'll share it with you
---
I was the last survivor. Huntress was chasing me but not throwing hatchets. I look back to find she's not actually chasing me and kinda gesturing for me to follow. I do, and assume she's being nice and leading me to the hatch. She gets to the hatch, waits for me to see it, and then shuts it so NOED procs and I go down in one hit. Wasn't mad, just disappointed
---
What about his homosexual?
---
Legion because I'm biased.
---
Did you misspell ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù on purpose or are you just a walking punchline?
---
Oh I already went against old freddy, at least his slowdowns could be stopped somewhat. With this its just permanent slowness and literally makes the match four times as long.
---
Just wanted to say I have no idea what happened. I just dropped the pallet and then suddenly gained a speed boost for the rest of the match. I'd think it could've been a glitch with a perk like Sprint Burst but I wasn't even running it so who knows
---
Here's a really fun (kind of meme-y) build that you can work up to: Deliverance, Decisive Strike, Head On, whatever you want for the 4th perk.
---
You activate your Deliverance by unhooking a survivor safely. Once it's activated, you find the killer and get chased til you go down. Wait until right when he turns his back and unhook yourself, then immediately jump in the closest locker (don't use Quick and Quiet, you want the killer to know you got in the locker). Once you're in the locker, you're effectively safe. If the killer is dumb enough to grab you out of it, it triggers your Decisive Strike and you stun him. THEN, you immediately hop into the locker, wait 3 seconds, then pop out, stunning him AGAIN with Head On. If you have one, drop a firecracker to blind him and then run like hell because you definitely pissed him off and now he wants you dead.
---
If you're Billy, Nurse, or Spirit, 20-40 second chases are feasable.
---
If you're anybody else, and you get a chase that short, it's because the survivor is awful, no exceptions.
---
Dr is the best for farming BP.
---
Legion is good too but thwir are games where the survivors basically don't let you use your power.
---
i am i wraith main
---
no prob \^\^
---
Did I stutter?
---
The Entity has no use for weaves
---
It's just the prayer beads that need tweaking. Like you can hear her if shes within 10 feet at least when phasing.
---
Bring I‚Äôm all ears, ez win
---
i disagree in terms of good survivors i can still down in 20 to 40 sec
---
Could we have a Baron Samedi inspired Witchdoctor?
---
Please.
---
If R6 is the most toxic community you know you haven't played league of legends my guy
---
Baby Megs &gt; Baby Dwights. Baby Dwights will still try to sit on gens bringing Leader + Prove Thyself + a toolbox to try to get out of there quick. The baby Meg is just trying to survive and you know she's terrified the whole time.
---
Save the best for last and play with your food really help him.
---
drop the ab tutorial sis
---
This meme is being used wrong, isn't it? Not calling you out OP ive seen a lot of people use this, but the joke in the movie is that he says "there's no easter bunny, there's no tooth fairy, and there's no Queen of England!" when the queen of england definitely exists and he's just a dumbass. Shouldn't the last thing be something that actually does exist? "There's no easter bunny, there's no tooth fairy, and there's no Michael Myers in Dead by Daylight!"
---
I have a hamster that looks just like dwight
---
At least they got rid of having to vault a window 11 times before it finally let you through
---
Calm down. It's literally an intended feature.
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Dead by Daylight. The horror is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the content will go over a typical player‚Äôs head. There's also The Entity‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the lore, to realise that they're not just scary- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Dead by Daylight  truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in Meyer‚Äôs existential catchphrase "... Hhhhh... Hhhhhhh...," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Behavior Interactive‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their  screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ
---
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Shirtless David tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
---
Yeah I kinda misinterpreted ‚Äúfun‚Äù into ‚Äúbetter‚Äù lol ghost face is definitely a blast to play. Plague is kinda meh to play as well though
---
Yeah there's definitely those "damn I didn't make that" vaults and then there's the "WHAT THE FUCK THERE'S NO WAY THAT HIT" vaults. Every now and again you get blessed with a "how tf did I make that????" or the killer getting cucked by autoaim so it all balances out (sort of).
---
It says Open Exit Gate. AND escape.
---
That's what I thought. Who uses reeee unironically
---
I believe its because in those languages neutral gender doesnt exist. Feminine gender is used instead of neutral
---
"Escape and survive ONE time with Laurie Strode."

Good thing I waited all that time to get it. The money I saved on it I used to buy the DLC

if gens werent done so quick slowdown builds would be literally molasses.
---
I don't read comic but ill definitely read yours!!
---
You must be a gen
---
Because i wanna blow you up and then leave
---
Movie sucks
---
Nah, I think hes seeing The Legion cause fatal wounds with only a god damn butter knife
---
You‚Äôre one of the very lucky few, I mean I play an absolute ton and so do my friends but it‚Äôs constant. I might start screen shotting post game chat and make collage after blacking out the names.
---
The teachable versions are not random and come at 30, 35, and level 40 in a set order.
---
If you don‚Äôt learn it now it will appear in each blood web until you do. You won‚Äôt delay BBQ by doing so.
---
He's really really strong, he's the best m1 killer by far if you don't try to stalk, use his cooldown regen addons and just play to keep people injured with free hits, not to mention the occasional gen grab. I swear the only reason rank 1 isn't just filled with GFs is that they all are such freaking memers that they don't rank up past rank 5.

Probably to just move on to the next game. Stupid because the eight seconds they saved cost them the BPs they earned.

difference?

You are a LIFE-SAVER, ABSOLUTE LEGEND. I scoured threads for twenty minutes and couldn't find a thing. Thanks so much
---
what does that mean?
---
No problem lol
---
Sure, send me a link when you made it. Feel free to check out my profile for other ideas I've made.
---
Yeah everyone runs toxic meme builds like Bubba's Basement during reset. Honestly I usually just wait a couple days before hopping back in so I don't have to go against 5 bodyblocker hags and prayer bead spirit's in a row.
---
Leader doesn't work on gens anymore.
---
Alright, thanks man
---
Promotion and that Ace perk that increases luck.
---
No problem.
---
I had a game where the first guy when I downed decided to dc and then the next one gave up on hook and the last two was a toxic meg (gotta love those) that annoyed me cause I was huntress and jake that wasn‚Äôt doing too well but later the Meg was able to loop me for a bit but I eventually got them cause they were trying to flashlight me and I got them right before the blind and then I found the last Jake trying to hide in the tall grass so when I downed him I took him to the gen near him and let him do it and then downed him again and carried him to the next gen and when he got the first gate open I took him to the second gate and then he opened that and then I took him to the hatch and he escaped.
---
We became friends after that

**Ultra Rare Addon**

**Tremendously increases amount of salty survivor tears consumed at the end of a trial**
---
Nah it really didn't work that well so bad dirty. Just made me feel like as much of an asshole as when I would run old Dying Light and have to tunnel somebody's balls off to get it to work
---
If they're getting downed by a Wraith in 20-40 seconds, they're not good survivors.
---
An exhaustion sprint buys them 10 seconds *by itself*, and while I can't calculate the exact amount of time the on-hit sprint gives (I don't have killer movement speed during recovery, or killer recovery duration), it's *at least* 6.66 seconds.
---
A survivor going down in 20 seconds means they're a moron who doesn't know what a pallet is.
---
40 seconds means they only forced you to break a single pallet before they went down (doing so buys you 19.33 seconds), which is a *pretty pitiful showing*.
---
Haven't seen it :/
---
Dbd memes like this always hit me in the feels and I don‚Äôt know why
---
Yep! Not fun otherwise. No man left behind.

# WHY DO ALL THESE TIER LISTS NEGLECT MY BOY
---
She will notice, it's Hex: Ruined!
---
Hex: No One Escapes Chores
---
Quick cleanse it!
---
Got that map yesterday when I finally decided to use up my Iri heads against an SFW
---
If you weren't angry then I would have a problem.
---
How can their hit box connect with me when they're clearly stuck on the opposite side of the pallet after it lands on the ground? That would make sense if they made it all the way through and ended up stunned on the side I was standing on.
---
Still you get the point
---
My most played ps plus game
---
I played my first game as wraith. Got looped and teabagged and taunted in the post game chat. I play nurse now...
---
Usually requires opening exit gate.
---
I was playing with 2 of my friends and we all took no mither and the ghostface let us go because of it.
---
This is really cute 
---
I love it
---
&gt;My Chinese New Year Huntress mask (the wolf) is missing. What happened?
---
Happened to me as well. Just open a support ticket and they should give it back. Took them about 36 hours to reply my ticket.
---
Two times I‚Äòve felt bad for unintentionally tunneling or dominating and then went easy on the survivors only to have 2/3 survivors t-bag me at the gate, escape, then message me EZ. It‚Äôs taught me to not give a fuck and just play mercilessly unless there‚Äôs only one person left.
---
killer game rank: Cthulu Displeased
---
The Hag is very fun to play and has decent perks, good map control/mobility I guess? You can get places fast. Before I got the Plague I ran her.
---
The Plague can pressure/slow the game down to put it into your favor. Punish altruism etc.  
---
Hands down the Plague is fun af. (Don‚Äôt have spirit so I can‚Äôt comment there)
---
The worst. The dc'ing is so out of hand.
---
Dude me too
---
I noticed this as well. Without paying to unlock the tier, you'd have to grind ridiculous amount of hours as challenges only give you sad amount of fragments.
---
She?
---
Guys im pretty sure he is being sarcastic and ironic i guess yall really need a /s to detect sarcasm.
---
If it's on Xbox, you need to have EVERYONE in the lobby add the host.
---
While the idea of the US President as a Survivor itself is a joke, let me know what you think of the perks lol.
---
Well in the ptb the rift has this guy facing away from us in a chair I think it‚Äôs the entity or Benedict baker
---
Well, it's not that hard. Before you throw down the pallet, their weapon connects with you. Which means you go into the injured state. Then after you throw down the pallet, they get pushed to the other side.
---
huntress is mommy and spirit is baby
---
I‚Äôve played it sense it came out for free
---
Amanda and child ghost face
---
Yea......pretty much
---
I see Claudette is looking as young as ever. All that toxicity mustve rejuvenated her skin
---
Quick study: Your ability to quickly adapt to a new problem pushes you further. For every 20% of a generator you complete you gain a 2% bonus to generator repair speed. Maximum of 20% bonus speed. "How do I.........Oh.......I understand now"
---
Process of elimination: Your ability to quickly find the worst answer to any situation allows you to find the correct ones. After cleansing a totem you see the auras of the two totems closest to you. "There's clearly only one logical solution"
---
Third perk here: I ran out of ideas okay.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the first one?
---
Best skin nice cosplay
---
Trapper is the mommy
---
How can you see?
---
i think the 2nd one has potential
---
The killer literally gets teleported to a locker, it's more of a joke than an actual idea tbh
---
If being hit through pallets was intended, there wouldn't be a stun applied to the killer for being in the collision area during a pallet drop. That stun is intended, this is why every killer has multiple voice lines for being put into the stun state. They had to pay their voice over people to do that. They implemented enduring to reduce it. They added spirit fury to mitigate its drawbacks.
---
Trying to pretend that killers getting free hits after the pallet has been thrown down is anything other than a bug is disingenuous at best. As a survivor you are supposed to stun the killer with the pallet. That's why it removes blood lust. Taking a hit and stunning the killer HELPS them (if they have enduring), which is obviously not intended behavior.
---
Vaulting hit boxes are also likely not working as intended, but it's definitely more of a gray area, as windows are intended to have a small cone of outside striking range.
---
Anna, Amanda.
---
Doctor is the uncle
---
Ok myer‚Äôs moist mistress xD
---
Its so fun tbh, but I love Plague in general.
---
OH MY GOSH WHAT A NIGHTMARE
---
Removed for unrelated to dead by daylight
---
I finally just found a match so idk what‚Äôs actually going on
---
All of these are balanced, the media is fake news
---
[Here is the build.](https://youtu.be/a6GgTR8N1LI) Basically the way True plays is using Night Shroud to have 0 terror radius and no red stain to injure everyone and slow the game down a lot. He never uses the stalk. This playstyle is quite strong if used correctly.
---
I unironically love this. It would be equally cool to be chased and to chase with this. Very well done.
---
You where the one whinging and crying here not me, over a streamer too how sad aha. Just because he's a trapper mains doesn't mean he had no knowledge of anything else how small sighted can you be? "Duhhh he said he main trapper idiot so he know nothing else" lmao
---
same. thats what makes the game even more fun. i‚Äôm honestly one of those players that would risk it all for one person even though i know i‚Äôd die trying to save them. a teammate once called me a ‚Äúboosted rank 2 pussy‚Äù because i didn‚Äôt save him off the hook when i clearly tried and the killer had a bunch of traps surrounded. made me pretty sad cause i know i‚Äôm a good teammate and if i would have tried, the killer would have gotten the both of us with his traps
---
Kind of a shame.  The pallet saves at any point during pickup were fine.  Its what you get for picking up at a pallet.
---
The flashlight saves were what was brutal.  Everyone went crazy with them and you could never pick someone up unless they were against a wall.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Today I‚Äôm playing dead by daylight, let‚Äôs do this shit
---
Why is bubba not in the pig category
---
This is so cute
---
This is actually a good tier list imo lol
---
Plague is mommy
---
Vommy mommy
---
what the fuck you made her look beautiful, i thought the edit looked good without hair but when you put that hair on it it looked so much better, bhvr needs to add a hair like that (to claudette or another dark skinned woman)
---
*well hello there*
---
Tysm!! &lt;3
---
Whoa, he's trying so hard to be tough but I just want to hug him.
---
I get it from time to time for no reason.  Just something that happens
---
You obviously fell and broke your ankles
---
Pacman used to be fried as fuck
---
That's not even what I was saying, but close. 
---
I'm saying people need thicker skins.
---
I'd have to go with DbD, but I haven't played siege since it's 2nd year so maybe it's gotten a whole lot worse.
---
The Entity doesn't want anymore self-hating basement dwellers. Leatherface will do better than any of them ever will.
---
From my personal experience BHVR won‚Äôt do jack when it comes to enforcing anything against console players
---
the killer not knowing  why everybody left but the game hasn‚Äôt ended
---
No. It means I am watching a movie and cannot be bothered reading your block of text. Like I said, killer hit you, you threw down the pallet, the pallet stunned the killer. Not that fucking hard to understand mate.
---
Mama Jane here to save the day
---
4/5 times, I feel dumb as fuck.
---
"Good job Freelancer, coulda got out &amp; not been hooked by *THE GOHHDDAMHHN PLAGUE* of a killers... but NOOOOOO, you had to be a goody-2-shoes!"
---
I then fastpitch my controller into my book case, kick my work shoes, give the TV the one finger salute.
---
... but that 1/5?  I strut my apartment like a *MOTHA-FUCKIN' CHAMP*!  I high-5 myself, shake my booty, tap myself on my bald head like a *gud boi*.
---
Then proceed to the next round.
---
N u m b e r s
---
If you‚Äôre looking for spirit sympathy on this sub then I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôve come to the wrong place.
---
Yes and I just submitted it
---
So wholesome ü•∞
---
Awesome, you‚Äôre on the path to greatness
---
In situations like this, I will even literally trade my life if someone can get out instead of me.
---
I‚Äôm having this same problem. Idk the cause. I also noticed an issue with obsession where even if I escape I‚Äôm marked as dead. Might be related. And no opening the gate isn‚Äôt involved with the challenge you listed even though others suggested it. That‚Äôs a different challenge that exclusively requires opening a gate
---
It runs decently, some maps don‚Äôt run as well as others but always more than playable.
---
you do have to be within a certain range (without addons) to teleport to your trap
---
with it without legion
---
Uhh what? Lol no matter someone's enjoyment is less than someone else's cause they're losing that's how it is.
---
Oh but I'll just take off all my perks and shit that make the game actually long enough to kill everyone just so everyone else could have fun instead
---
course you can, appreciate you askin mate
---
I‚Äôm also biased for Legion
---
Whats your IQ level?  
---
no one said remove your perks but don't run bullshit sets \[same for survivors\] that make the game completely unfun for the other players.
---
You said "I guess all human progress should never have been made because people complained about it." 
---
I resounded sarcastically saying "yeah let's jump to no progression from not having perks attached to characters" or whatever the quote is
---
The black shadow artifact at the start of the gif makes it harder to enjoy it :(
---
Still gut tho
---
Yeah pretty sure he was joking/being sarcastic. Not everyone can spot it.
---
ayyyyyyy free gang rise up
---
It makes you more competent than someone who's not even good enough to reach high ranks. So you're completely wrong.
---
Hello!
---
Wholesome.
---
May I ask what your IQ level is instead since I never claimed anyone told me to remove perks? I only said that since you expect me to play in a way that pleases others even though I got a game to have fun myself and removing the perks so survivors have an easier job is the way to go about
---
he‚Äôs clearly not judging by these comments
---
If by nightmare you mean wet dream then yes
---
Match Result:
---
Escaped?
---
Next time wait until you have a million blood points and then you can get into the high 30‚Äôs when you prestige. A level 50 doctor should be able to get that pretty quick. The doctor is my normal killer also. &lt;thumbs up shock noises&gt;
---
Nice. Plus, it makes them have to spend more time looking for the hex
---
When I heard the spirit one I thought, "Alright.  They need to pay this guy and use this in game."
---
This is awesome stuff, man.  I seriously hope they're smart enough to hire you.
---
&gt;Build that wall: pallet cant be broken for 20/30/40 seconds
---
But it can be climb in 10
---
demogorgon is the family dog
---
I‚Äôd rather see how the archives play out with adding lore to the game. This is a pretty unique game and I‚Äôve been a fan with how they‚Äôve added things to it so far. Just for shits and giggles though would you mind expanding on what fortnite did today that would translate over to dbd?
---
This gif is cinematic as fuck
---
My last match with this build I had a 5 gen lol.  They were all oddly close to each other.  I hooked them all twice and then basically just stood between all the gens and watched them fail skill checks for 5 minutes.  The survivors messaged me afterwards saying they were sweating bullets and had a blast.
---
Bless you
---
That would be awesome. I‚Äôd love to wear a ghostface mask on my meg.
---
I dont think live events really fit this game, but i def think it would be amazing to see some sort of large hint towards the next chapter growing before its release, kinda like how people thought the slashes on the picture of the lady on badham was going 2 be the next killer (ended up being the spirit)
---
too bad their is no end game chat in console or to be specific ps4
---
Glad since I posted this it's gone from 30% upvote and 1 point, to 72% upvote and 8 points. :)
---
ikr im really thinking about messaging one of the devs on reddit about this idea
---
One day we'll be able to outrun Nurse by walking
---
I would love this. And killers could wear survivor flesh masks
---
oh shit sorry haha
---
So .. leatherface?
---
They‚Äôre not pointless on PS4 yet. The update isn‚Äôt out. Like, if they just want to waste them all, why not pick one or the other every match until you‚Äôre out?
---
Seems fair
---
Well if it isn‚Äôt the invisible cunt LOL XDDDDD
---
I hate this about DBD you legit can't rank up if you do too well... Win every chase instantly, get nothing. Never have a survivor hooked and do all the yens and leave? Get nothing
---
Vommy Mommy is pleased.
---
What is the point of kindness? It gets you nothing.
---
It‚Äôs just to burn through em, I guess they didn‚Äôt care for them after they heard about the update
---
Yes. I would absolutely love wearing a Claudette face mask on my claudette.
---
I can definetly see survivors wearing their killer counter part mask 
---
Dwight  - Trapper
---
Jeff - Legion
---
Jake/Dave (dunno which one is) / Huntress
---
Feng Min / Doctor (Not a mask but what he wears)
---
Kate  - Clown (maybe some clown make up)
---
Etc
---
Lol I said this in a past post and nobody cared lol
---
I guess. I posted this as a joke anyway. :)
---
Performing the sacrifice ritual can get points though, summoning the entity and hooking all progress this because of that, whereas nothing you do as a survivor helps you survive, just gets you closer to surviving
---
Discussion post never gets acknowledged tbh
---
As someone who never played this game.... None of the made sense to me.
---
99'd both exit gates*
---
So Friday the 13th perk system? No thank you.
---
I've seen all fortnite's events and definetly loved them (and the game) but I don't think dbd is the type of game that would have live events. Don't get me wrong though I love the lore of the game and especially want more (especially for legion who didn't get alot and are 4 people which I would love to see their relation expanded) but I don't think dbd is the game for live events
---
This has to be the best thing I've ever seen.
---
You make a post about Donald Trump then tell people not to "spout political BS" in the comments... Like bro, he's the president. This post is already political. Also the fact that his perks are all kind of positive of him shows your leanings. Build That Wall? When? Because he has had 3 years and he hasn't built a single piece of his wall, they've just reinforced previous sections of the border wall. He would make a terrible survivor because he's obese and he has "bone spurs" so he'd just be zipping around the map on his golf cart the whole game and refuse to do gens.
---
Manage to escape a killer 10 ranks below you after a massacre? Nothing.
---
I honestly dont care for Spirit, I'm bad with playing as her, and against Spirit, I can do well, and even if I don't, I dont care too much in the end because I'm a killer main, but comparing hiding a red stain at a jungle gym to phasing is pretty dumb, because a survivor has some time to react to it, even if they guess wrong, whereas, if the spirit guesses correctly, they have no time to react and have to take the hit. They're both clearly different.
---
Eh assuming you werent trying to rank up you couldve just dce'd
---
One day, we won't need it in the game anymore
---
Let's hope.
---
The problem with bloodlust is that it's an easy workaround. They were shit at designing maps. There were infinites. How do we fix infinites? We could design good maps, but we could also add bloodlust.
---
On the newer maps with pallets designed to be playable, bloodlust makes it so you will eventually get them anyway, ruining the carefully crafted design
---
The game is the most fun when the survivor drops the pallet and the killer doesn't have to kick it straight away. bloodlust really breaks it
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dhlkmz/weird_dbd_healing_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I legit just rage quit (after the match, didn‚Äôt DC because that‚Äôs a dick move haha) the game after a fucking awful night playing. I started as survivor and did absolutely terribly. 6 matches no escapes or really even close. I am a new player and rank 18 after the reset (got up to 16 yesterday). I kept getting matched with rank 15 or better killers but rank 16-20 survivors. So I switched to killer and it was the worst night I have ever had. I finished 5 matches and I was done. I love the game but a) I really fucking suck at it and b) other players constantly calling you out on your suckage gets old. You should be grateful you‚Äôre a rank 8 survivor who just got matched up with a rank 18 barely 30 hour new player...easy blood points for you. Is it really necessary to call me garbage because of it? -end rant- I am taking a few days to play a game that doesn‚Äôt raise my blood pressure. Lmao.
---
What‚Äôs the original art for this. Looks cool
---
Missed opportunity to just make Bill a skeleton
---
Oh, well, so to hear that. I thought it was pretty funny
---
I'd be interested in a system where perks had a value and you had a certain amount of points to spend on perks.  IE you could run a couple meta perks or run several bad perks.  There are probably reasons why this wouldn't work or would convolute the game.  People complain that the game is too repetitive/straight forward, but I think that's part of what makes it so successful.
---
I think they should add more side objectives around the map that reward BP but don't affect gameplay (besides slowing it down for the killer).  Adding other objectives that could win the game for survivors would likely lead to a broken game.  Red rank survivors would be urban evading around finding all the pieces and winning every game.
---
Excuse me sir, that is *BUBBA‚ÄôS* basement
---
I got matched with a rank 18 scoops ahoy boi tonight who kept effing up all his skill checks, bless him. Best part was at the start of the game when he missed his first one and tried to hide BEHIND ME as the killer approached us. We made it out only by the grace of the entity.
---
This would be great. Literally can't think of any downsides considering people either DC or suicide on hook anyway.
---
The only thing I can think of is counting pips or points and having each team have a killer and 4 survs a match would be 2 games one as killer one as surv and who ever has the most moves on
---
I mean I could've but I dislike dcing. I don't like playing a game out till the end just to call it quits and get nothing out of it.
---
No. As a killer main I cannot allow myself to get jumpscared by a baby Dwight.
---
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got one.
---
As survivor? I've found it reasonably easy to accomplish as killer. But as survivor it's unheard of.
---
Should change the value of a perk to its usefulness, not its tier. Perks like Ruin have the bulk of its usefulness at level 1. It would be much better to assign a value to each type of perk regardless of level. Your current idea would shaft the P3 characters that have those perks at T3 already as there is no prestiging after 3 so while a newer player could run some awesome builds the point restriction would stop more advanced players from having a chance to.
---
Lump all exhaustion perks together for a point value, all altruistic etc. Going off of tiers would be problematic.
---
Im fresh out of bad jokes, sorry
---
Enough to make a grown man cry
---
I was rank 8 ish in a game (this was pre the ranks being shown in lobby) and 2 of the other survivors were making some - questionable - plays. I ended up getting farmed and sandbagged a few times by these people. End of game (we didnt make it out)  i was gonna give them a bit of heat, but looking at the scoreboard: rank 20, rank 19, one perk each. I held fire.
---
 It wasnt their fault. I remember my first few games being terrified, crawling everywhere. 
---
I threw them a gg smiley face. They confessed it was indeed their first times playing and gg'd back. 
---
The real troll was the matchmaking system. Those poor fools never stood a chance.
---
not the best killer but decent one
---
by far the most annoying killer to play against
---
These days, well, dbd isnt what it used to be, so o guess its seige
---
A give up feature could be alright.  It shouldn't be available the moment you go down or people would just rage quit/derank too often.  Maybe once you hit the half way bleed out mark you can give up, same as the hook.
---
Adorable I love that, you should do Hillbilly and everyone else too
---
I play spirit similarly. Except I accidentally find survivors doing they're juking thing and get lucky hits more often than not. Spirit guides me to victory. I'm not driving just cruising.
---
I'm not a good spirit  player myself (console and without headphones since I heard those help) but after landing the first hit you should always use your ability if you have it to chase them(following scratch marks and their grunts) 
---
For loops I tend to mind game either go invisible near the pallet and hit them most of times but also occasionally stay still as they think I'm a decoy and run right at me.
---
Using the power can also help by surprising people at gens if there's one near (whispers will help if there's someone near or not)  it seems to work for rank 10 survivors but I'm sure better survivors won't be caught off easily without prayer beads
---
Other obvious uses of power is patrolling exit gates and finding the hatch easier 
---
Again I'm not the best spirit player (avarage - below avarage) but I hope this will help!
---
It had nothing to do with pallets.
---
It was made because window loops on some maps were OR STILL ARE terribly broken
---
It's still needed on some maps like **Suffocation Pit** or **Ironworks of Misery**
---
on the new Badham it totally breaks the design of the map tho. The map's premise was that it has a lot of playable pallets. The game is the most fun when pallets don't need to be kicked down immediately and there are some mind-games once they are down.
---
Bloodlust on pallets has always been an issue, but it can't be removed until all the strong window loops get fixed
---
sadly, it seems like it's here to stay for another year, two, or even forever
---
I'm cuious how you feel about the gen teleporting. It seems to me like too many killers are getting the power to teleport now. There's hag and Freddy, now the Demogorgon. Nurse can basically teleport but I pass that one cause it's sorta different. But the other 3 feel basically the same, if not in design, but effect.
---
Fantastic! üñ§
---
I totally agree and was thinking the same thing. Halfway would be perfect!
---
What, you don't want to be left on the floor doing absolutely nothing for 4 minutes so the killer can get a 4k? /s
---
I just DC in that scenario because I'd rather get into another game then waste the time.
---
This sub is really bad about downvoting everything idk what‚Äôs up in the bug report thread a bunch of bug reports were downvoted for no reason
---
If this applies to games other than DbD, it's not an issue with the game, and people in other subs would be much better suited to help. Based on the lack of responses thus far, I'd assume it's not an issue based on the game itself.
---
The perk ideas are actually pretty good, however i cant agree with adding him into the game, force me to be a killer main ü§™
---
But cool perk concept üíï
---
I really feel like they need to completly revamp the blood point scoring system and have points = rank
---
Hearthstone is an e-sport and has so many luck factors in it. Nor is it the only game where that's true. Luck and e-sports are not mutually exclusive.
---
DBD's biggest problem being an esport isn't the luck part, it's the balance issues between maps, killers, and not being designed around SWF.
---
it's here to separate those who just started playing/play rarely from those who play 8 hours a day and to kinda sometimes make matches a tiny bit more balanced
---
Dont worry you'll be "allowed" to play her when she gets nerfed after nurse
---
Add a hand holding perk... Or would that be too lewd?
---
It was also a joke. Remember the days when you could talk mad shit on an m rated game and have people laugh with you. Miss those days
---
Clowns perks alone make it worth it. Bamboozle and pop
---
This is gold
---
As someone else mentioned there are add-ons you can use the increase the distance you can teleport to them from. I advise trying to always go for them in the bloodweb.
---
What youre looking at my friend is a pretty good job
---
It wasnt my first offense. I've never been banned before
---
Doesn't matter what you feel you deserved, snowflake. You agreed to their TOS when you installed the game, and you breached it by suggesting someone should die. These are your consequences. Your feelings on the matter are irrelevant.
---
Yep had the same here, so frustrating and I feel so bad for my team thinking that I just dc
---
4000hr player but ok lol
---
I myself prefer to think of the Entity as genderless. I mean I never really associated a gender with It. But either way I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter lol
---
ive had that happen before. best perk in the game at level 1. i was like.. good start!
---
Evolve was decent. Think their servers are off but it had offline ai matches last I checked. Can't get the platinum anymore but still decent if you can get it for like $10.
---
Papyrus
---
Yeah, thats a bit rude really. No need to trash on new players. 
---
Usually as a killer you can tell if your survivors are playing like they're new i.e "hiding" pretty much out in the open, not looping, can't land a skillcheck to save themselves. If I get 3 hooks before a gen is popped I dial it right down - miss a few swings, not see them with their head poking above the cover, "lose them" in the forest / jungle gym. I chase the healthy one who made a super crap hook save. Maybe I explore the other side of the map a moment while 2 people are on hooks. Really, just not punishing those early years mistakes.
---
Nothing kills the mood quicker than getting wiped, and certainly if the killer is a prick afterwards.

---
You call me a snowflake when you're telling me that I shouldn't say "bad things" on an m rated game. Fuck outta my thread pussy
---
And if you have a killer that isn't the greatest, you don't have to mock them by teabagging and pointing at them, thank you!
---
I've often wanted leatherface skins of all the survivors. Would be amazing
---
M&amp;K?
---
After reading your post, and comments. I'm sure that guy has a thing for reporting. Normally if some one said that to me, I wouldn't take it seriously. Be very careful, people are extremely sensitive in today's world. I think it's shitty, and dangerous, but I avoid toxicity myself. Not that I'm sensitive or anything.
---
Nice edit snowflake
---
Lemme just edit that my bad, mouse and keyboard
---
I disagree, i just watched it and its aomewhat disturbing and well shot, I'd give it a 6/10 which is good for a horror as most are low budget trash, and no yhe other guy is right nothing is explained but that doesnt mean it doesnt make sense, watch it, you will decide very early if you want to keep watching.
---
Its not one of those movies where youre waiting for a build up that never happens, something is constantly happening so you aren't wasting your time.
---
You're the most level headed one in my comment section. Thank you sir, for not being a pussy. And you get an upvote from me
---
I wouldn't mind a Jeff mask 
---
Aka leatherface with beard
---
U ok?
---
OP, do more comics. Definitely enjoyed this.
---
The chat system inside a game is not a public place. Freedom of speech does not apply. Whatever company owns the product can dictate how it is used however they want. You agreed to their terms when you bought the game. Don't get butthurt with your nostalgia goggles just because they enforced their own rules. Besides, how thick do you have to be to tell a streamer of all people, with many dozens of viewers, these things? You were asking for it. Now run along and play a different game, we won't miss you.
---
I have another glove if you're in need...
---
I think Frank is pretty evil. I mean doesn‚Äôt the dude legitimately like killing?? The others are just sheep which I‚Äôm not saying is any better. It‚Äôs pretty pathetic actually, but I guess The Entity settled for the sheep to get Frank.
---
I was thinking the same thing. The killer could see you, and you just jumped out and flashlight saved. Killed my ears when he screamed
---
The game awards you. Like the  "Good/great skill check" message with points under it, you see a "Killer Blind" message.
---
No one in your comments is being a pussy. If anything that's you, unable to accept the consequences of your own actions. You remind me of drivers who speed and then whine that a hidden camera fined them. Acting like it's everyone's fault but their own.
---
You still haven't given me your steam name. Cant wait to find your pussy ass and do terrible terrible things to you..... in game ;)
---
People don't like that sort of nuance here.
---
Yet I agree, it's very much what you choose to see, because both sides are represented
---
Ghostface for having fun, Spirit for winning, and Freddy for a new view of the game.
---
Thanks. I decided the word snowflake was unnecessary. You've already been owned enough by the ban hammer.
---
hahahha
---
Why u so obsessed with me. Go play dbd since you like sucking the dev dick so much
---
Behaviour needs to hire this man
---
This is incredible üôåüèª
---
Man that's so depressing. I remember how excited I was when I first saw previews for that game years ago. Looked like it was going to be one of the coolest games ever. Fortunately I can say that dbd has lived up to what I thought that was going to be.
---
The climax at that 50 second mark is sooo effective and terrifying. You did it again! I pray that BHVR takes how much everyone loves this seriously. Implementing your work would be such a massive improvement to the gameplay experience! I don‚Äôt play killer a whole lot, but when I do, it‚Äôs usually hag so I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what you do with her particularly :3
---
Dont use your screams in the early game, a good killer can find survivors early without it. Use the treatment mode when you have downtime and you can find survivors. Also, practice the timing for the shock, I personally prefer the common shock range addon because its just long enough to work on almost every loop while not taking to long to shock. After a survivor is shocked, they scream and cant vault or drop pallets for 2 seconds. After you shock during a chase, instantly switch to the weapon to move faster. Finally, if you have the choice between a shock and a hit, take the hit, survivors tend to find something to use if you give them extra time, and shocking when you dont need to gives the survivors extra time in the chase. Only shock when you cant prevent a pallet drop or a vault. 
---
For perks, i use BBQ, save the best for last, corrupt intervention, and either ruin or pop goes the weasel (pop at high ranks, ruin at low. High rank survivors dont care about ruin, they either hit the skill checks, find the totem easily, or gen-tap.)
---
Doctor is one if the best killers to keep a 3 gen strat. Corrupt usually shows you a good 3 gen strat for the mid/late game. If you get a three gen, don't let survivors take you away from it.
---
I've played doctor at rank 1 for a couple of months now and this is my play-style, seems to work for me. Hope this helps!
---
It does, but I don‚Äôt believe many people would want to use a perk slot for something like that.
---
Rank 1 before reset. Idk, timings are so fucked up that when I shock them, switch to punishment and swing, they already get rid of debuff and make me eat pallets. Not to mention that "window block" doesn't work in 9/10 cases and they just jump lol. Electrode addons are a fucking nightmare bc of how long it takes to charge the shock.
---
Just sick of seeing fools who think it's alright to tell someone to kill themselves, and then whining when they are inevitably banned for their own crummy behaviour. And then proceed to use the excuse "I miss the good old days when I could tell someone to commit suicide without consequences!". If you truly think that, then you're beyond help.
---
Do you do this every time someone criticizes the game in a sarcastic way? Must get exhausting.
---
Not the exact same, but just as global. It is just so bloody cool.
---
Yeah you're right man. I'm beyond help. But I cant say the same for you! Gender reassignment surgery is still very possible! Pussy
---
Maybe where you live lol. Definitely not where I live. Halloween is always a party night regardless of the day of the week.
---
You are showing an immense lack of understanding of how the game works. The killer swings, you drop the pallet. If you drop it early enough, it will infact cancel the attack, but too late, and the hit will register, then the stun will happen, and the killer will be shoved back. You've been given this answer a couple times already, it is not a bug, this is intended.
---
Both can be pretty good in the right hands. This is especially true with Ghostface.
---
You're so classy, thank you.
---
Neat idea but I think it would be a little too crazy
---
Anytime dad. Now can you please hop tf out my thread. The men are talking
---
So did you come on here looking for actual help or to just talk shit when people respond? You must be a class act
---
I feel like it depends on context though, like he has no idea who this guy is. He clearly doesn‚Äôt ACTUALLY want him to kill himself. Is it distasteful? Sure. Is it funny? That‚Äôs subjective. But to be perma banned for something that most likely wouldn‚Äôt have been reported if he weren‚Äôt a streamer might be a bit much. It isn‚Äôt cool to tell people to kill themselves &amp; we should change our rhetoric as a society but,,, at the end of the day it‚Äôs just a stupid game.
---
I've only talked shit to one person responding on every single comment anyone has made.

Corrupt is better tho
---
Shut up Meg.
---
I was a kate near an exit gate with the daily to open it, but a meg was already opening it, I began motioning for her to come with me nodding and all that, and she came off and let me do it! That was a nice experience.
---
i encountered a bubba who killed everyone except me for some reason. i didn't do anything to warrent this but im still glad i saw him dance to the whirr of his chainsaw as i opened the exit gate
---
I remember early on when I was new to killer and got so frustrated with this one guy who kept on juking me to the point all 5 gens popped that I face camped him near the end. I apologised in chat afterwards for my actions and he with the rest of survivors instead of trash talking me (which I deserved), they actually gave me tips on how to play and counter some loops, etc. It was an eye opening moment for me and I still remember them. We just have to remember that there are people on the other side of that screen.
---
Imagine using coulraphobia tho
---
Quinten mask is too scary pls nerf
---
how so? It would simply give him map pressure, not anymore chase potential. He still needs to uncloak, giving survivors time to react. This would literally not change the way a survivor reacts to a uncloaking Wraith but give him some much needed map pressure.
---
You dont need to feel bad. Just people acting in manners like this is something that personally annoys me a lot. Its fine if you like it.
---
you can play mouse and keyboard on consoles?
---
I blame him in the regard that he refuses to admit how much progress the devs have made over the last year of updates nerfing survivors so that playing killer feels more balanced and fun again.  He is way too hard on the game and is on public record saying that it is purely a party game and not competitive at all.  As someone that has pulled off great plays as both killer and survivor this is an absurd statement.  I dare anyone to watch an Otzdarva video and tell me that there isn't strategy involved in making these plays.  It kills me too because Tyde was my favorite streamer when I started 3 years ago and was the first to teach me how to play better killer games before I graduated to True and Otz.
---
Freddy, use shards for legion.
---
For people who aren't good playing on PC. It's the same with Fortnite
---
That's understandable. Everyone has pet-peeves!
---
He pips quite a bit when he plays Survivor. Not like it's hard to do or anything, but that's what's considered "good" in this game.
---
Can you record some of your games, especially when not everything goes according to plan. Or can you advise good doc players so I can watch and learn
---
Legion,lmao you don't even have to stab people in frenzy just use it, wait it out. Ez frenzied points
---
seriously, who gave julie permission to be that thicc
---
Not if the second after you hook them you see scratch marks around.
---
Surround sound maybe?
---
''I personally don't like this game, and haven't played it''
---
Pardon?
---
Corrupt works wonders on:
---
Trapper, Hag, Freddy, Demo - makes preparation time easier
---
Myers, Ghost Face - Easier to find targets to stalk
---
Doctor, Wraith, Clown - gives them pressure at the start of the game (I personally don't like it on Doc tho, as I don't want them all to scream at once at the start of the match)
---
Legion - His power is all about finding injuring multiple survivors who are close together
---
Plague - easier to spread her infection
---
This is a good idea
---
Sooo... did it count as an escape?
---
Wish we could like, customize which survivors sit there. I'd pick Feng, Laurie, Ash, and Steve!
---
innocence has to end one day
---
Why is everyone talking about the teacher now? They've been in the game files for well over a year at minimum. There's even another killer that would've had the power to destroy different parts of the environment
---
Proof is in the other 2 DC's. That or he didn't have enough time
---
can you do the entire Legion?
---
Wait there's rules?
---
See my other post, you won't believe the totem spot
---
I would love that
---
So no one else is gonna say it? We *NEED* this as a skin
---
I'm getting the WWII Germany vibes from it
---
Bullying and belittling? What the fuck? You replied to ME, not the other way around. Don't start shit if you can't handle the consequences. And stop using age as some sort of weak ass excuse. You're 21? Then you're an adult. You're not a child. And you don't get to say whatever you want and then hide behind your age unless you're under the age of 12. Grow the fuck up. Seriously, what a pathetic response lmao. Just wow.
---
Huntress is David King, so shirtless bunny daddy
---
Donnie needed a rework after launch so here's his fixed version:
---
**Make America Great Again: **
---
Everytime you cleanse a Totem you gain 10,000 bloodpoints in exchange for regressing all current gen progress on all uncompleted gens back to zero.
---
*"I do the biggest, best gens. We're talking Mega Gens. You've never seen gens like these. No one does gens better than me." - The Donald*
---
--
---
**Trickle Down Economics:**
---
Everytime you look at the Killer, you reveal the aura of another survivor to the Killer in your stead and are given a token. Anytime that survivor is in a chase and reveals your location to the Killer, the token is consumed and that survivor loses one health state while you gain one.
---
*"The Democrats are why you went down! The Democrats want to take away your Decisive! They want to open all the exits at the start! They want free unhooks!" - Trump*
---
----
---
**Fake News:**
---
For every uncompleted gen, you receive a token. Whenever you are hit by the Killer, consume a token to transfer the hit to another Survivor furthest from you on the map.
---
*"The fake news media keeps asking Donald Trump if he took easy hits from a Killer. That's fake news. Trump looped that Killer, that's why he survived. He's the bestest best Survivor. No one loops like Trump. All the Killers say Trump is the best. They see Trump and they get scared." - Trump*
---
Concuss - The fear of being harmed causes sudden bursts of adrenaline at the most important times. The Killer is stunned by pallets for 15%/20%/25% longer and is blinded for the duration of the stun. Using this perk causes the Exhausted status effect for 60 seconds. The perk cannot be activated while Exhausted.
---
 ‚ÄúThey want us dead, that‚Äôs a given, but I will at least give them a hell of a run for their money. Come at me!‚Äù
---
Serendipity - Your knack for finding others fills you filth confidence and vigor. Each time you reunite with a different survivor, gain a token up to a maximum of 1/2/3 tokens. With each token, gain a 10%/15%/20% increase to all action speeds. 
---
‚ÄúHey, I was hoping I‚Äôd run into you!‚Äù
---
Clairvoyance - Constant trial and error has taught you a few things on predicting your enemies. Fast vaulting within the Killer‚Äôs terror radius reveals the Killer‚Äôs aura for 5 seconds. This perk has a cool down of 60/45/30 seconds. 
---
‚ÄúSee, the trick to prediction is in the movement. Watch their feet carefully.‚Äù
---
For the PlayStation console, I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything specific for Ubisoft and their games but for the console there are certain things you can‚Äôt do because they give an unfair advantage
---
Glad to see I‚Äôm not the only one
---
Dead meme
---
You picked the wrong house fool
---
Spirit is one of my favorite killers to vrs because she still scares me! I'm sorry they decided to weenie out and waste everyone's time.
---
You and I are kindred souls bless your kindness.
---
You too. I mean, you made a post about Donald Trump.
---
No.
---
r/jerma985
---
That stuff has been in the files since before the Nurse was released back in 2016.
---
There is last year:the nightmare but it‚Äôs shut and doesn‚Äôt feel fun to play at all
---
Does Death Garden have any players at the moment?  Does it count as ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù?
---
The whole map and the game were consumed by the blackhole. There's only "exit game" button and black screen now. A cool way to start a new chapter of a game's life
---
Do you want the bloody axe now or later?
---
That's fair, some dont like how loud dbd is sometimes
---
I thought you didn't want political BS in the comments? Oh wait, it's okay if it's pro-Trump and anti-Hilary.
---
My midground with swf if you are not going to bring toolboxes or a key then I‚Äôll play nice
---
You don't even understand what the email scandal was, this is pathetic.
---
I have same error in ps4 when swf
---
Ngl I‚Äôm really liking these fake survivor builds lately
---
Reminds me of this  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ao3nb0/i\_love\_rank\_reset\_mumma\_claudette\_and\_i\_were\_so/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ao3nb0/i_love_rank_reset_mumma_claudette_and_i_were_so/)
---
I'll always remember a game after a rank reset where the killer clearly knew what he was doing. I wanna say it was huntress. Anyway I was by an open exit with the girl I was partied with and the two noobs on our team were both hooked. 
---
I just had this rush of confidence and said "I can get them, leave." and as I ran back in I felt that dread of "Fuck why am I doing this" but I got to the first survivor and unhooked him. Almost immediately the killer was on me but I managed to juke him out and unhook the second survivor. All four of us managed to get out
---
r/whoosh
---
How are these made?
---
Does the term ‚Äúshitpost‚Äù come to mind?
---
No, it's just apart of her "character" just like how I put mostly wall shit in trumps.
---
Those videos fill me with joy, not all community is toxic and competitive we sometimes forget we play to have a good time.Id love to find pure souls like that dwight and protect them.
---
BUMP
---
XBOX USER BTW
---
Lol thats my own footage, we always look after newbies.
---
Nope, The Underground Complex as Huntress
---
If this story is actually real, it's the most wholesome story i've heard about dbd!!!
---
Pretty sure OP was talking about fortnite not dbd
---
I bought it at launch, sold it, then got it again thanks to PSN+. This time, I enjoyed the game so much that I bought 4 characters (Ash, Amanda, Freddy, and Steve) and Ash's Finale skin, with an intent to buy Steve's next skin.
---
It may have been free, but they sure got my money.
---
Wait so people can‚Äôt play the game while this is going on?
---
since they nerfed healing speed from 12s to 16s (24s to 32s on self-care) and made sloppy affect it as well, 16s to 20s (32s to 40s on self-care)
---
Rip Bernie
---
No they love being toxic clicky clicky cunts.
---
Of course no one did. Just downvotes. The hypocrisy and entitlement of killer mains is astounding. Teabagging is toxic but head shaking isn't. Flashlight clicking is toxic but hitting someone on the hook isn't. Refusing to exit is toxic but leaving the last survivor on the ground to die to EGC isnt. Lol.
---
This is one reason why i can't stand community ideas
---
Wait, if you have never played the game, what are you doing here? :v
---
I always thought devs said stream sniping isn't bannable. Can you post a link to prove your claim?
---
Double Dip might be able to work, but I doubt that the others could. If there was a perk that could respawn pallets, we‚Äôd never hear the end of it.
---
Worth stating that demo and Freddy can somewhat handle these maps without 3 genning if you are good enough. That still is only a fraction of killers though
---
Kinda late, but you kinda missed my point. A penalty on dcing only causes people to suicide on hook. Meaning the issue still remains.
---
Well it would only work once obviously
---
It's the only reason I even remotely believe in things like fate. One decsion to play a game being dodged a few times to finally get into a game. Find a fl in a chest and get hella lucky. So many things have changed in my life from that moment and the friendships that blossomed from are so important to me.
---
Ahh good point. He might have thought you were giving him the totem then hatch lol
---
Trump would probably be the new Scoops Ahoy Steve lmao
---
Thank god theres people like you out there in the fog &lt;3
---
No. Just a regular match
---
Yep same goes with the ''funny'' posts.
---
Do you guys not know how splinters work? I‚Äôve been seeing these posts for a while now and I don‚Äôt know if people are genuinely confused or are messing with me
---
it reduces the normal self-care heal from 32s to 24s and the Sloppy Butchered one from 40s to 30s
---
better, but not as good as it could've been
---
I won't.  No worries. But with so many recycled memes, I'm surprised I've never seen something's that's so relatable. So I suggested for someone to make it as an idea. Just some thoughts u know. No expectations whatsoever. 
---
Just felt stupid right now with friends wondering why it was taking so long, when everyone is looking at their phones, and no one is ready.
---
It‚Äôs still a lifesaver for my stupid ass
---
Unfortunately that's unavoidable, due to the nature and style of the game. I can't think of anything the dev's could do to prevent it. I do appreciate that they've taken steps to reward the players that stay though, In the form of blood points for both killers and survivors.
---
I just ignore them and try my best, luckily theres not a lot of dcs in most of the games unless its a killer with op addons or playing "unfair".
---
...Shelter Woods isn't that big? I think it's one of the more killer friendly maps.
---
I genuinely give up at this point, is there any point trying
---
Please repost this image some more
---
Only the first one, the rest are randomized.
---
But that is the render of the skin
---
i main both killlers, and as a freddy it's real hard, while as a demo, it's pretty easy. And i think it is better like that, the Survs need maps where they can outrun the killer better etc. the map of the doc, is a map wich is very good for the killers
---
Fake News had me dying lolol
---
I like to run Ruin/Tremors/BBQ/Flex
---
Ruin and BBQ are kind of necessary on Leatherface, just because you don't have the map awareness and pressure necessary to remain relevant without them. If you get good, or want to experiment, feel free to take them off and try something new, but those two are always a good place to start.
---
Thrilling Tremors is a Ghostface Perk, so you may not find it for a while, but a nice alternative is Corrupt Intervention. It's a Plague perk that blocks off the generators furthest from you at the start of the trial. Blocked gens means less travel time for you, saving you a minute or two at the beginning of the trial.
---
For Flex Perks, I would say that just about everything works. Personally, I like to run either Spirit Fury, Sloppy Butcher or Franklin's Demise, but it's totally up to you. If you're feeling fancy, you might want to use a second Hex perk, like Devour Hope. That gives survivors a 50 percent chance of finding that Hex instead of Ruin, which can be awesome if Ruin is hidden well enough. Better still, your hex might stay up after Ruin is destroyed, which lets you play around it. Devour Hope is nice because, if it stays up long enough, you can hide its ability until you have 5 stacks, and just start killing people off out of nowhere.
---
If you wanna learn more, Interact has great videos on Youtube for new killers, called Entity Education. Go check their video on Leatherface out!
---
Or just play Sweet Home Alabama or any generic country song
---
I played as a Dwight in default skin and wanted to see what a killer would do to me. An Irridescent huntress killed me, a Bubba facecamped with chainsaw revved, but then a nice Ghostface realized I was new then played around with me, tried to guide me to doing generators, and downed me to carry me to the exit when I kept running around during the collapse. I'm NOT a good survivor (Rank 18) but I do know the game way better than that, made me happy people would do that for a genuine new player... 1 out of 3 times!
---
its been a year now and I don't know how you can tell..
---
Yeah because every 13th of the month everybody has their rank reset
---
Smaller maps are really annoying for survivors, Honestly as killer and survivor i prefer bigger maps, I main huntress and billy and have a blast on Rotten fields
---
She is in the small, elite club of 'not spanx'. Sadly pantsless meyers is not in this club.
---
I play Killer more, but the few times I play Survivor I'll have a 5 second inner arguement on of I leave or go save them, Complete with me constantly 180ing every time I "Decide".
---
i really hope you are joking when you say you want him in the game
---
Ghost face all the way
---
I personally find it much better to use none. You open up 2 perk slots for yourself.
---
Self-Care is the perk I recommend everyone to avoid. It teaches you bad habits of always needing to stay healthy.
---
bring a brown med-kit with you, run adrenaline and I'm sure you don't need more heals than that.
---
If the killer hit you and left you, they WANT you to heal yourself to waste time and if you were unhooked, you have someone near to heal you up
---
but your playstyle is yours. no more interference from me
---
I didn‚Äôt know, thanks
---
Playstation Plus isn't free though
---
I think it's just because they keep tunnelling only the female Survivors.
---
It seems so, idk.
---
No it did work if you look at the killer name it‚Äôs the offerings killer so when you get off tha menu you‚Äôll have that killer available
---
How dare you make fun of Willy Wonka
---
Imagine being a PC elitist in 2019
---
I‚Äôm on PS but I‚Äôve been playing since the game launch on console, had it pre-ordered
---
I'm not making fun dude just noticed some similarities
---
G
---
Demo' s in a category all by himself, all his stomping and gurgling
---
Small maps are really easy for survivors lol. They always have the strongest loops and extremely high pallet density. I've looped killers all game on small maps
---
It feels like I get tunneled more in my striped pajama outfit on Dwight, but honestly it could just be selective bias.
---
It really does for the most part...
---
Legion doesn't deserve to be in quiet, he is pro breather.
---
Nancy is known to get stuck a lot
---
And to think a 32 year old man is typing this to me... hilarious. Keep it up!
---
By discussions.. do you mean in your class?
---
I generally hate all the indoor maps. This one, the hospital, the stranger things one
---
Claudette playing with the killer (Freddy) till I dc‚Äôd. She threw pallets on me, blew up gens, pointed me out, and sandbagged me. Not very fun.
---
You‚Äôre welcome, can‚Äôt wait for it tbh
---
Just busting your chops
---
It's a secret add-on that allows you to be invisible when standing in any corner, btw i'm not sure if that's just a 'piece'
---
Didn‚Äôt.. didn‚Äôt you already post this..
---
It takes too long to get a million
---
They are trying to rebalance all the perks so tiers 1 2 and 3 work the same and only have slight number increases (what they did with, for example, Devour Hope, Ruin, BBQ, Noed)
---
Discordance needs a rework. Make all tiers work for the same time and add a secondary effect that can scale.
---
Yea but I wanted it on my main account sorry
---
I wish my rank didn't reset these low rank players are absolute fucking trash. Gen tapping through ruin or spend their time looking for a totem or picking up items in the basement against Leatherface etc. Absolutely fucking trash people
---
I get notifications easier
---
Well they're both dead so i'm not so sure about who'd win. Nurse is a corpse and Spirit is a spirit.
---
Since when is he number one
---
Don't play to please them. Just have fun and you'll get better with experience. Try to play both sides and figure out how the survivor would think in that scenario and mind game them.
---
As long as people that literally message you ‚Äúez‚Äù privately exists basement leatherfsce is gonna be my favorite. I played the both survivor and the killer side can say that toxic survivors are annoying even on your side.
---
or perks should never be better on tier 1 than 3
---
But you see, YOU were the toxic one for going out of your way to message them shit like this
---
Death is not Death
---
Fuckable
---
Well, can he??
---
OP, you're the only one being toxic here.
---
I feel like I‚Äôve seen this, hmmmm
---
Obligatory "Killers are the Real victims" comment. No. It's not the characters, it's the fucking players. Just because some is toxic as Survivor, doesn't mean the all are. And vise versa. It's an online game, people are gonna be dicks. All you can do is grow some thick skin and ignore it.
---
Dang that looks good
---
*i must...* **c o n s u m e**
---
Doesn‚Äôt make sense, what were you before reset. Reset takes you from rank 1 back to 10 and so on, all the way up to like 16 to 18. You probably just didn‚Äôt get reset but yo-yo didn‚Äôt give info about previous ranks
---
In their announcement post on the dbd website, they said the Rift should be completable within roughly 70 hours with a dayly playtime of one hour (if you're doing all the challenges). That being said, it can't be too difficult to complete the Rift if you're a dedicated player.
---
We don‚Äôt need a whole new start.
---
The little to no chance you mean
---
That joking part is literally me lmao
---
Fucking got'em
---
Didn't they make it so that you actually have to aim the flashlight in the killers face though
---
Even so, death is not an escape
---
I'm currently at work. Not much going on.
---
And then there's me that get a p3 nurse who says "gg ez" at the end of the game
---
Ah man I felt this. Been trying for adept ace since the rank reset. Had multiple times where I 99 the exit gates, my injured team mate gets forced out and I‚Äôm left to save the guy basement hook. The 3rd time I wasn‚Äôt successful I took a break for the day. I‚Äôm not going to leave team mates behind and I‚Äôm not doing too hot so tomorrow‚Äôs the day.
---
Where exactly did I say that I didn't like those maps? Nowhere, you absolute fucking clown
---
Goddam. This is embarrassing. 
---
Imagine having an ego this fragile. Sad.
---
Just be calm spirited and ask him out already. If you don't take these opportunities they will fly out of your reach.
---
Every time a killer post a video people shit on you cause you made a mistake or god forbid you were too close to the hook while all 4 survivors were near you.  It's fucking pathetic really. And I thought Division dark zone pvp was toxic... lol
---
Ever since ochido and his fans took the game by storm with the wave of pure toxicity, the only people who suffered at first were the killers. People started getting more and more toxic, and soon enough, a lot of killers were getting sick of it. Now it's not just new players who face camp. Let's be logical. Why would killers at higher ranks, who most likely know face camping is a bad idea, go out of their way to do it? Why else would so many people play broken builds, or go out of their way to play a way that isn't fun? You could make the generic "you're just a killer main who's playing victim" But I play both survivor AND killer, and I don't get nearly as much toxicity as I do playing survivor, than I do killer. Know how many games away from my main it took for me to get this kind of reaction? Literally 1. First game. That's sad. We can't chill, or try less for one game without this kind of behavior. Toxicity for killers is overwhelming. I don't care about not getting at kills, but when you're going out of your way to message with the intention of being rude, and literally everyone backs you up by telling the person you were just being rude to that "lol get good, or grow some skin lmao" It honestly shows just how one minded survivors are, and proves my point.
---
All that for "ez"? Lol
---
Says the furry
---
Well there is an indicator that Freddy is teleporting (tho one addon makes every gen spew blood) and the cooldown is pretty long, I tried teleporting with tinkerer but I was late about 80% of the time.
---
Freddy has decent map pressure now but I hardly even use his teleportation. So it's totally counterable. Let's put it this way, you might teleport to the other side of the map for nothing and have to walk about half the map's length before you can teleport again. So it's medium risk - medium reward kinda thing.
---
Love the dream pallets. Climbing through yellow and green ranks, it's so amusing when survivors wait to drop the pallet on you and boom, fake.
---
Thank you for the tip!
---
as someone who frequently links that sub, this one is used correctly
---
This sounds great!
---
Ya but Demogorgonzolas face is a bit weird. You gotta remember he can move his head more than other killers. The hit box is slightly lower than what you‚Äôd normally expect.
---
It‚Äôs dedicated servers it‚Äôs obviously gonna be buggy.
---
Playing Killer whilst Colorblind is just DbD on Pro-Difficulty... or said otherwise: Just l2p 4Head /s
---
Every 13th the ranks get reset to a certain rank depending on your rank. The rank reset was today so coming back you should go from rank 8 to rank 13. But if you are worried about going against a good team I'd wait to play since rank 1s are rank 10 now.
---
You didn't say anything good about them from a killers perspective? That's what this post was about correct?
---
And that means that I don't like them?  I said big maps are boring from both perspectives. Learn to read
---
Says the slut
---
touch√©
---
I have indeed been turned into a clown, a buffoon, my previous statement has been deleted
---
Ace Kobe Ace Kobe ACE KOBE.
---
I said it wasn't... I never said you did... that was the whole point of the post...
---
Man do I have news for you
---
I detect lies
---
Must be a glitch. Even rank 1s go to rank 10.
---
Yes. Because how else is the toxicity going to die down if it isn't punished? The devs don't do anything about it, and survivors get to band together and spread this "hey it's ok to be rude to others". I mean here we have another survivor, praising them for this behavior, and scolding the person they were aiming their toxicity towards. The amount of praise, defense, and support these kinds of people get honestly proves my point.
---
Only if it comes with a Hank Hill or Dale outfit.
---
Ah yes, that does make sense.
---
That's somehow a sad ending to an otherwise great story. If you don't mind, what happened between you and your girlfriend?
---
From what I know from many people, Nurse is not overpowered but not really bad on console either
---
You also said the pale rose was enjoyable now so...
---
I can't tell if your comment is positive or negative tbh
---
Wha
---
They‚Äôve been there since nurse
---
jane is thiccer
---
Lord forgive me for what I bout to do
---
At least on my end it‚Äôs still there
---
Imagine defending someone for that kind of behavior. Half the people on this sub are ochido fans. You in his discord? You like asking underage girls for nudes too? You act like him, support the kind of behavior he made popular, might as well take up his habits.
---
Stealthy play style is okay till you get caught then you gotta loop, no point practicing to hide.
---
&gt;Because how else is the toxicity going to die down if it isn't punished?
---
How was he toxic?
---
&gt;The devs don't do anything about it
---
Because the majority of it is just people like you crying all the time.
---
Grow up. You messaged his repeatedly, why? Shit happens, get over it. Wanting to ban people? Ffs.
---
Most of the difficulty ratings are misleading. Huntress is one of the hardest to master up there with nurse, but apparently she is only intermediate. Billy easy? Chainsaw turning is so floaty that it's rank it at least intermediate. Spirit is not hard, only a bit less straightforward. Trapper is mindgames incarnate, winning and losing on reads, which is apparently easy, according to the devs. Etc. etc.
---
Sometimes i wonder how much they play their own game.
---
Well there a very few ways to design a balanced, and fun map.
---
So you want a new emblem ‚ÄúNot being Bold‚Äù
---
I don't see anything childish about informing someone why toxicity spreads, and how they're only adding to the problem.
---
The one time I did this to save a teammate on a hook (I was on second state and the killer had a mori) I got downed and the Nea managed to teabag me during the mori animation but still ended up getting mori'd herself. Only around 22 meters from the exit gate. But yes if they actually did something productive, No if they sad in the corner of the map all game.
---
Oh I meant as in it held no value anymore, I wasn't going 2 actually delete it
---
One again, you are reading into shit that wasn't there. Pale Rose is much more fun to play on NOW than it was when it was over 200 sqF. That doesn't mean I fucking love the map. That doesn't even mean that I like it. It's loops are safe a d boring. However, it is leagues better than it once was. It's palatable now. I never said I enjoyed it. Nothing you have said in the last ten minutes has been anything other than assumptions. Please turn your brain on
---
really just gives some extra mobility and makes it easier to hit a survivor if they 360
---
Well now I feel stupid lmao
---
I don‚Äôt even care about the blindness part, I just want this because it‚Äôs great
---
I try to help the other survivors as best as possible unless they sell my ass to the killer then I'm just like ight you dead
---
Dw I will delete it so you feel big brained instead
---
With all the issues dedicated servers are bringing I doubt dc will be a top priority, also why are you so upset about me leaving a match that I have no interest in playing?
---
imo, it would already be an improvement if they changed it from 8/10/12 to 12/10/8 to make it trigger more often. Objectively, the perk currently works best in tier 1
---
Don‚Äôt do that, this outcome is funnier
---
Well i was asking which one is the said toxic one
---
It's 2 late... I used the post to delete the post
---
Thanks to that I discovered a good online game ty

Amanda and would give birth to GF, GF not as good as Claudette though so they would be related as cousins maybe? mm?

You should make a meme out of this for easy upvotes

Maybe as an add on (and a high one) but not straight up in his base kit.
---
*when you‚Äôre being chased by the Killer but Jane walks by lookin* **STOOPID thicc**
---
:(
---
You‚Äôre so entitled fucking hell, if you have no interest in playing a game that is 50-50 to go your way or not then don‚Äôt start the game. You genuinely ruin the whole match for the other 3 survivors and the killer. You‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with the game
---
I'm sorry bud :(
---
These are great. Im glad you‚Äôre back

2 times bloodpoint or 3 times bloodpoint ? I'm not sure anymore...

---
Ayyyy
---
It‚Äôs ok pal
---
Its positive lol, thats why I put the /s
---
I‚Äôve been messaging every killer GG even if they didn‚Äôt play so great. I don‚Äôt want them to get discouraged and abandon killer.
---
Maybe they are used to playing on PC, but their PC is old/broken and it's cheaper to buy a console for them
---
Mouse and Keyboard adapters are terrible anyway. They still have the same limitations controller has, as they are just input emulators. Translating mouse movement to controller is hard and doesn't really work.
---
remember that there are people who play on PC with a controller.
---
I personally can't even hold the controller. My hands start to hurt after 5 minutes and I can never get it to listen to me. The only console I enjoyed playing was PSP, where I played Patapon.
---
I stated to play killer recently. Flashlights are so rough lol. I‚Äôll hear that clicking in my nightmares...
---
oh, gotchu mb
---
Lerys and Hawkins are awesome for me as Demo, I tend to do poorly on the Game for some reason tho
---
I play both aswell. But literally saying "It's you Survivors, not us" ironically shows that you are one minded. Yes you see more toxicity with Survivors but that's because... DUH, there's FOUR of them each match to where there's only one killer. But if a Survivor is toxic, it's just putting themselves at risk of being murdered. And imo If there's a toxic killer its way worse than a Nea Teabagging and flashlight spamming. If you're getting tunneled and facecamped, that killer is literally keeping you from playing your game. A Flashlight spamming Meg cannot physically keep a killer from playing the game (unless the killer is being stupid and just goes after her the entire time.)
---
About how the syringe has been buffed. It puts you in the endurance state or whatever. This allows you to take a normal hit for once but it allows you to tank a chainsaw, one shot hatchets, exposed.
---
Yea, but some people think tier 3 is better cuz "bigger numbers" and we wouldn't want to confuse them. Even BHVR seems confused by it.
---
BHVR tries to rebalance perks so tiers 1 2 and 3 are as useful with minor number changes (look what they did to BBQ, Devour Hope, Noed, Spine Chill etc.) so a rework like this would make sense. Keep the effect the same, add something simpler that could scale
---
Dedicated servers have been a lot worse with it not working.
---
This sounds more like a power imo.
---
Sup.
---
i'd grind until you have a decent amount of bp again (like 500k), then go prestige ~
---
Can add 5 minutes to a chase lmao, a killer can‚Äôt stop you getting to a pallet if you know how to use it. It‚Äôs not always for just dodging 1 hit
---
You must be a meat hook, because the penetration is real.
---
Dude, you have too much free time
---
I too, am currently dating someone I met through Dead by Daylight. 
---
He has 2k+ hours and I have like a few hundred. He saved my ass in SWF, when we added each other we spoke on discord and he pulled me into a KYF and taught me so much by being the killer and explaining pallets and everything to me. We do a lot of SWF with a small group of friends, really makes the game so much fun.
---
He lives in a different country, and I've flown across and met him twice so far üíñ Hoping he can come visit me before 2020.
---
I would never have guessed that, thank you very much.
---
Why DC when there is still a chance?
---
Why DC at all? DC is cancer (on both sides of the game btw).   
---
And honestly, nothing to do? I always do something when I‚Äôm slugged, you know heal yourself for 99% and start crawling to look for the hatch. 
---
If the killer finds and hooks the last one you can still escape, if you bleed out, the other survivor knows where the hatch is (if you find it and start twirling like a crazy person).
---
Ash cannot match the big dick energy that is Steve
---
If they put twitch.tv in their name they‚Äôre asking for it
---
You're mostly right here, but one correction: When you begin your attack with the saw you are briefly slower than the survivor, but as the attack continues his speed ramps up and he actually gains just a SLIGHT overall boost to his distance-over-time before being slowed down again at the end of the animation, once again bringing your overall distance-over-time back down to below what it would have been without the ability.  
---
So you'll see the gap between yourself and your prey get slightly larger on ability activation, then it'll stabilize, then you'll gain a bit of what feels like a "lunge" (which is where you'll usually get the hit if you're going to get it) where the gap will close, and if you missed then they run a decent distance from you while you have a short recovery animation.
---
I see way less toxicity and way more gg wp. I love this positivity. Even more since I play mainly killer.
---
That's when you pull them off a gen and drag them to a totem kicking and screaming. Tough love? Maybe. But take him out for some chest loot afterwards and he'll be happy as a clam

God speed u/John-Rob
---
It means you will be seeing less nurses and more prayer bead spirits. I want to die.
---
As multiple have already stated, you start your pallet smackdown animation and the killer connects his swing. 
---
You don‚Äôt go down mid animation so you throw the pallet, stun the killer who gets pushed back by the pallet and then you fall on the ground. 
---
Not a bug or a glitch.
---
Imagine this thing coming alive and crawling away.

It only goes up to plague unfortunately

You mean when you square up within kissing distance of him for 15 seconds and still don't break him out.

Nah this is too far. The game puts him at a bad angle with him leaning a bit that‚Äôs why. Delete this

Seems more accurate

A lot of states age of consent is 16.

I love using Devour hope, but my God, it's starting to make my blood boil. We all know how hard it is to keep a hex up and running, but my luck is just terrible. I keep getting garbage hex locations, and even though I run it with hex:ruin, 9/10 times, D-Hope is popped first (I honestly WANT ruin to be popped first).
---
 But once in a blue moon when I actually manage to get 3 or 5 stacks, it makes it worth it.
---
I don't really mind teabagging at pallets with flashlights. It's a genuine strategy. You're enticing the killer to break the pallet in front of you. It's when someone takes their time to message you with the intent of being rude that makes me think they're toxic. I've never gotten a message as survivor from the killer after he gets a 4k. Even when I'm with my friends, who each have names resembling my own. Sometimes I even get legitimate props for a play. I only get these messages as killer from survivors. I get that not EVERY survivor is toxic, but when I post this kind of content, and the majority of people who see it, defend this behavior and call me toxic for not just laying down and taking it, or telling me to grow up and get thicker skin, that shows that the point I'm making honestly isn't far from the truth. Scroll down and show me one person who disagrees with my statement of "survivors are the problem" While also saying they disagree with how these people behaved in the situation. You can't even try to show the community that doing this causes more killers to play gross, or face camp without everyone jumping you, saying "you're just a killer playing victim" Which honestly hurts, because that's the kind of mindset that splits the community. You're either a "toxic survivor main who's always complaining" Or you're a "killer playing victim". If we all just sat down, and said that "yeah, this kind of behavior is unacceptable, and we should strive to not do this kind of thing" Then everyone would have so much more fun with while playing. New players might have a better chance of sticking around.
---
Nice play, although spirit requires a single skill: have ears. Simple as that.
---
Just some casual beastiality. Nothing wrong here.
---
Why do I feel like the idea of multiple killers came from either my Steam Pictures or CowsIAm who probably also got it from my screenshots.
---
Can't wait for the invisible perk for survivors.
---
I cried seeing this cute comic

The lore isn‚Äôt active in the PTB, probably so they can‚Äôt spoil it for everyone else

---
It is toxic, and I'll tell you why. It's not about how long the message is, it's about the intent of it. Racial slurs are hated because the context of the word has hateful intent, so even if they're just words, it's still wrong to use them with aggressive intent. I didn't post this because I'm triggered. I posted it because I knew exactly what kind of responses I'd get, and I knew each response would prove my point even more. I'm not about to claim something like "every survivor is toxic" With just 2 messages. Instead I'll put up a lamp, and let the moths draw to it, making them prove my point of their own efforts.
---
Thanks!
---
They actually don‚Äôt have ages at all because they aren‚Äôt real :/
---
I‚Äôve been having a lot of players attached to my hip in games. They are all probably new but I don‚Äôt mind :) I started running prove thyself because of it too haha
---
The survivors took it
---
Come on. You surely could think of a better opening line then just copying what I said.
---
No I dont watch ochido or know much about him. 
---
What I do know is the birth of this behaviour since the days of cs 1.6, halo. Some fucking streamer didnt start "toxic" behaviour. It's been around since games started.
---
Stop throwing your toys out the pram. This thread is just everyone disagreeing with you. Your an entitled child who thinks your behaviour should be rewarded cause you play fair. Fuck you. 
---
No one gives a shit about how you play. 
---
Everyone who's played games has been told gg ez or got some bullshit message. Most people just move on with their lives and take no notice. But nah not you. You and your pathetically fragile ego wont allow it. Grow up you sad sad fucker.
---
Id take the Hag because survivors dont let you use your full power at higher ranks
---
Maybeeee
---
What do you think about a 1, 2, 3% increased speed when walking toward the highlighted gens (only outside the chase)?
---
Id start over with the mask, making a mold out of clay or finding a base mask that's close enough to what I want it to look like and then layer paper mache or epoxy. You want the eye holes to be tiny, it's kinda hard to see through but that's how it appears in-game. Instead of hand painting it I'd use a brush, just take your time and be careful to replicate the details you want. Remember that with this mask the grin is very thin, like the cuticle of your finger or a mostly eclipsed moon. The right side looks less like an exact handprint, and more like five streaks running down the right side of the mask into a solid color.
---
"You must have never played a killer match."
---
Lol!  Bro I hit rank 1 as killer before the Wraith Cube came out.  I'm a 50/50 player that plays both sides through red rank every month.  Not selfishly holding my opponents games hostage for minutes at a time so I can prevent them from having a single chance at beating me to the egc hatch doesn't mean I'm a biased survivor main it just makes me not a dick.  Play both sides man.  That scenario is 100% selfish from their perspective.  If you know exactly where the remaining survivor is because you saw them as you downed me them sure slug me but the ones that tryhard that shit by default with zero clue where the last survivor are are just dicks man.  
---
Slugging is absolutely holding the game hostage it just isn't the reportable version listen under the report option.  That clearly refers to say bodyblocking a survivor into a corner and such to where they have to DC I get that.  But technically slugging a survivor is still holding their game hostage it just happenes to be a game legal version of it since their game will eventually end 4 minutes from now when they bleed out.  Their game is still effectively over and they themselves have no control or power to end the game short of dc'ing if they don't want to be forced to play the amazing ground crawl simulator game for several minutes.  I'm sorry but your mindset is incredibly entitled.  Play both sides and practice objectivity it feels very shitty to be slugged.  I'm sure this isn't news to you.  It's why I don't do it in my killer games.  I hook the third.  Find and close my hatch 75% of the time and collect my 4k that way.
---
I'm a totally useless not doing gens cannot loop killer rank 1 Ace
---
Still P3

Please stop talking sense in this subreddit. The meta brained idiots who refuse to think for themselves will down vote you to Oblivion
---
I hate when this happens
---
Can I still get annoyed outside the game? I always try to guide newer players in a game, but I still get a bit annoyed when they don't do gens, and I can't help them because I am being chased
---
How you gonna counter sprint burst and Urban evasion, huh?
---
Lol questioning my rank man.  Sad dude.  Come on don't be that guy.  I got 3k hours in and I started off as a killer main before becoming a 50/50 player about a year ago.  I'm glad I am too because it allows me to see both sides of this unlike you.
---
"Those guys are actually playing the game"
---
Exactly!  The killer is still playing their game the slugged survivor is not.  Their game is over, they lost, only the killer hasn't deemed fit to agree to end it officially.  They are using them as a floor prop while they continue playing their game to prevent counterplay for the EGC hatch.  If I have to explain to you yet again why this is viewed as entitled dickish behavior from the opponents side I'm afraid you'll never get it or at least you have no interest to.  
---
Same response to the game hostage thing.  Their game is over.  They lost.  You refuse to defeat them.  If they want to play a game their only option other than waiting for you to grace them with a hook is to dc.  You are holding their game hostage it's just within the rules of the game.  You really come off as tone deaf and biased on this one.  Play...both...sides...man...mains on either side are clueless when it comes to viewing anything in this game objectively.
---
It's every game, why don't you go scare some children or climb in bed with Quentin?
---
I'm literally not the only person who cries about it. Other large figures have been quoted as saying that kind of behavior entices more toxicity. Otz was one, Truetalent was another. These are just a few, yet they are also highly influential pillars of the community. Truetalent even went out of his way to say that the devs are basically toxic survivor's bitches, because they do nothing about it. I'm sure if the devs actually started caring about the situation, people like you would get the memo. Also, funnily enough, you're saying "get over it and move on" As if I didn't post this, to let gullible toxic survivors prove my point for me? It's like a tycoon game. I can move on all I want because you're all making the argument for me. And miss me with that school yard bully "more people disagree so they're obviously right" shit, you ignorant mongoloid. As if I'm going to agree with a bunch of people who are literally proving my point for me, by being even more toxic than the people in the photo.
---
This sounds actually kinda fun
---
This looks so good and precise!
---
look I love this format but I don't think this is how you're supposed to use it

Imagine being a good player who utilizes the perks they have instead of being so restricted to meta builds

Sae Kurosawa from Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly. Nothing scared me in a video game than Fatal Frame II, and I‚Äôd love some nostalgic terror.

Yeah there‚Äôs two mindsets I am fine with in dc scenarios. Either go easy and/or farm, or just murder them quick so everyone gets to the next game faster.

Bruh I was meming. Instakill Myers isn't a serious build, and like the other person said, I was rank 11 in the first place. Chill.

just the matchmaking in general lol

I‚Äôm the sad one for questioning your rank? (Only based on your ‚Äúknowledge of the game‚Äù about holding the game hostage) yet you downvote because someone is not agreeing with you ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 
---
I‚Äôm done trying to argue with you if officials rules about game hostage doesn‚Äôt apply to you. 
---
I play this game 60/40 (survivor/killer) and don‚Äôt mind if they slug me in that scenario because it‚Äôs a tactic and I actually still got away in that scenario before.

Finding the hatch/ getting healed and finish the gens or the other survivor healed you and then got hooked so you‚Äôre the one running around now. 
---
But sure, buddy, you‚Äôre rank 1 and dc when you get slugged because there is nothing else you can do. Everyone knows once you get downed you can‚Äôt get up anymore. AMIRIGT. üôÑ
---
What's pathetic is ignorantly and arrogantly falsifying your own statement by being just as toxic. How the majority of the people commenting are being just as toxic. It's like I knew exactly the kind of responses I'd be getting, but decided to follow through with posting this because I knew that a lot of people would unknowingly prove my point. It's not hard to see what I was doing. I've yet to see anyone disagree with my statement about how all survivors are the problem, but also disagree with their behavior in the same message. I know not every survivor is toxic, but it hurts to know that when the majority of survivors are people like you who praise toxicity, and scold anyone who even remotely retaliates.
---
I agree that facing the 3rd spirit in a row is boring, for example... but not ALL game are trash.
---
Sometimes things will go on your favor, sometimes you'll have to deal with thing you don't like or find fair.
---
I faced a Iri Huntress 2 days ago, the last time I faced one before this game, I don't remember it... and I play most of the time on purple/red rank.
---
The game is much more balanced than before, not only 3years ago, but even 1 year... but clearly this game will never perfectly balance, like EVERYONE want, 'cause everyone want a different balance, fair or not. This is a problem for every online "pvp/competitive" game, PVP in wow... balance between character in OW, I don't play LoL, but that's the same for Smite and so on.
---
An online pvp game, where at least 2 players are facing each other, will never be balance perfectly, it's impossible since they don't have the same power. (I'm not speaking about FPS). Even more when new content and new power/perks... are release often, it's an everyday job at balance, and always restarting from scratch.
---
Once again, I agree, sometimes I want to DC too when my teammates sandbagged me, the killer is always the same, or tunnel, or I face a good team of survivors and i'm bullied... But I don't do it, I'll wait the end of the game. Take a breath, eat something, change game, or start a new dbd game :)
---
&gt;but it hurts to know that when the majority of survivors are people like you who praise toxicity
---
1) Majority? False.
---
2) People like me? False.
---
3) Praise toxicity? False.
---
omg xD
---
Well Rin didn‚Äôt kill her dad so her body pile is literaly 0. If we look for ‚Äöharmless‚Äô killer she and plauge are first in line.
---
Why am I laughing so hard.
---
Well deserved!
---
I'm sorry to hear that :/ I got so much over my time in the game. I know how you feel :/
---
Have the devs ever stated their official pages aside from Frank?
---
Fascinating observation, it's almost like that's the joke.
---
Interesting concept. It'll let you learn as each killer, but also the system now demands you play as a killer you can handle.
---
Clearly you havent seen him play.
---
It was a great deal
---
Man, honestly, as someone who used to really enjoy your streams, I can‚Äôt recommend enough that you take a break and look at yourself critically. Over the past few months you‚Äôve only gotten more and more defensive, bad spirited and victim-y. Just because you‚Äôre getting downvoted or people are stating things about you they think are bad, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre unfairly targeted. I think you should take them seriously and look at yourself fairly and realize that just because someone disagrees with you it doesn‚Äôt make them illogical or toxic. 
---
Every streamer deals with trolls and snipers, you just make yourself more and more of a target by acting the way you do. Lighten up and lose your ego, dude.
---
Its gotta be within reason though. Some people can shred teams as a base m1 killer, which all killers can pretty much be.
---
Quite the "optimal"pronunciation.
---
BT crutch lmfao.
---
The one on the far right is Kate and the one inbetween her and Ash is Ace I think
---
10,000?
---
You can plug a mouse and keyboard straight into the ps4 and it will work BUT most games won‚Äôt let you use it as a means of controlling anything. There are very few m&amp;k ps4 games like warframe and ffxiv
---
I personally don't know where but mostly everything I checked and people I've asked says they're 16 and 17
---
Been happening way to much ever since the stranger things content came out. It was never near as bad as this before then. I find it very hard to believe that in almost every match since then that the killer has that bad of a connection. Even when their connection is below 100ms ping this shit still happens.
---
I love how these tierlist never include ghostface and demo
---
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gonna have to learn some day. Might as well widen their asshole ‚Äú. (Rank 2 killer)
---
GOD we need danny devito as a survivor or killer
---
I watched an interview where they said its something they're interested in implementing. As to when, who knows
---
"The Trash Man"
---
The first flashlight save feels so amazing to pull off. I remember doing it with a yellow flashlight I found during the match. Tbh, even the consequential flashlight saves feel pretty amazing.
---
r u challenging me
---
That's what I always hear, it never says anywhere officially
---
babies not hitting skillchecks is always oddly adorable, thank you for being kind to them!
---
Your just making excuses for your own toxicity. 'You do this bad thing which makes me do a bad thing' bullshit. Grow the fuck up. Also thinking your taking any sort of high road with your 'if I weren't to blur thier names they're get the temp bans they deserve.' Get over yourself
---
Same happened to me and a couple of friends. We feel your pain.
---
Don't get me wrong  I don't mind helping new guys out when it comes to the game, but when they're oblivious to everything and don't bother helping out in anyway it's kinda hard.   But it doesn't mean I still want to help out of course :)
---
Fuck spirit.
---
This is so cute holy shit.
---
As a killer main, I'm still killing both of you.
---
Im a console player alongside my 3 friends and I guess we arent as informed of community memes. I had no idea what baby anything meant till I read this reddit alot or even what swf and ptb stand for.
---
I guess console players are unaware about these things we play alot more casually.
---
I did reach red ranks casually and the low ranks who facecamp are the pricks of console I get them too they are actually quite common
---
Cry more about DCs
---
On PS4? There aren't any.
---
On PC, all of DBD's other competitors are dead.
---
Lmao. It would honestly take just one. One person to say that they disagree that me saying every survivor is toxic is wrong, but that they also disagree with this behavior in the same sentence. One person to find common ground with. Hell, if the first person to comment said that, I would've taken this down immediately. Didn't happen, has yet to happen. Although, I do know deep down that not every survivor is toxic. Funny thing is, that does'nt matter when the majority of them are. A majority so high that I've not once gotten someone to disagree and find common ground with. No, instead I've got a mass of people, doing their hardest to prove my point by being as aggressive as possible. This behavior makes killers want to be toxic, and face camp, so they don't have to put up with that sort of cancer. Or it makes them want to play 5 blink nurse and prayer bead spirit because they're afraid that if they don't get that 4k, they're getting a fat "ez". Let me ask you this, if a majority of the United States said that we should cleanse the gene pool by killing off all off everyone who have the chance of producing a child who was disabled in any way, would that make them right? Because there are more people backing it up? Your little argument that sheep should be enough to convince me my statement is wrong is fucking stupid. You're ignorant for trying to push it.
---
Still crouching after being guided out of the locker, that's the cutest thing I've seen in a while :')
---
Deathgarden isn't on PS4.
---
bhvr's given us some nice surprises before, here's hoping your work inspires the next one to be unique chase themes for all killers
---
Replying to an 8 day old comment? Really?
---
It was entirely too innocent.
---
do u expect me to see it super soon? why so salty lol who tf cares how old it is. i‚Äôm busy alright??
---
Gee wizz  wouldn't it be fun to read OP's post, ratjer than just the title?
---
Got it ps+ and I freaking love it. Still playing it on a regular basis because of how fun it is
---
Shhhhh the people who defend pedophilia or any attraction to anyone under the age of 18 are going to come out of the woodwork and harass you into thinking it's ok to be attracted to or think about fucking minors. Obviously if you are a minor yourself then it's whatever. Get your rocks off all you want. But there are a lot of grown ass adults in their early 20's that still think this shit is acceptable. Age of consent doesn't mean much either. The parents can still press charges since their kids are not legally an adult yet. Age of consent isn't a free pass to fuck minors or even want to fuck minors. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/caMm6N8.jpg
---
Yet you're claiming me the toxic one for going at this as mature as possible? I didn't once insult their race, or sent them threats. They messaged first with rude intent to ruin my day. And I'm the toxic one? 
---
Either way, sheep will be sheep. I'm not going to pay attention to someone who doesn't pay enough attention, to the point where they eagerly send hate against a post that I made because that's what I want them to do, since it shows that what I'm saying is true. I hope I said that simple enough for you. ‚ù§
---
Yes I'm so salty that you replied 8 days later..
---
you‚Äôre salty enough to find every little thing to nit pick at
---
Rank reset shouldn't be a thing and unless there's no other options, newer players should be matched with other players below a certain playtime threshold.
---
I reinstalled DbD a few weeks ago, twice, and 80% of my matches on both killer and survivor had new players in them. Nothing is more frustrating than having new players on your team or having to play against them. This community will always defend BHVR for their actions and because of that these issues will never get fixed. Just enjoy your rank reset for no reason each month and grind back up to your usual rank while getting destroyed by smurfs and having to deal with newbies who can barely hit a skillcheck.
---
Lol okay
---
&gt;Be Rank 1 Killer
---
&gt;Have a bad few games
---
&gt;Switch to your rank 20 killer
---
&gt;Bully the hell out of the lobby.
---
I feel like there could possibly be some issues.
---
Alert is very solid I run it myself, not every build has to be meta just use what you enjoy or feel comfortable with. (:
---
Your mistake is thinking that most people will give him special treatment just because the internet said so.
---
Many Dwights are also toxic scums.  So count your luck if they are treated like everyone else because many killers would like to tunnel and camp him instead.
---
You're going to make SFM porn, arent' you?
---
Try youtubing it, chances are there are some files there.
---
When do survivors ever get praised for toxicity? This sub is all about shitting on swfs and survs who say "gg ez" in post game chat
---
Nurse is kinda good on console considering they are like unicorns so really no one knows a decent way to fight them but yeah the FPS and controller is a problem
---
you're nearly double their age don't be gross.
---
I'm having a lot of fun with rank reset this month! It's nice to take a break from brutal red rank matches and see some different killers, different playstyles and not get my ass kicked into oblivion. Never thought I'd be so happy to safety pip.
---
Definitely! Damn I'm still that person when I'm against a really good killer tbh
---
The only meme I don't mind seeing constantly, the face and text makes me laugh
---
I don't miss the inhuman noises I made when being scared tho
---
Take my upvote lol.
---
I used the Myers to destroy the Myers
---
Seems fair &amp; balanced to me. Smile
---
I usually only see people dc when they're being camped, tunneled, farmed or the killer is being a dick- And it makes sense because you play the game to have fun, why would you keep playing when you aren't having fun...?
---
You'd quickly pip and be out of rank 20 queue but yeah this might be an issue
---
I'm glad we can get common ground. I know that not all survivors are toxic, and some killers are toxic without cause, but it's hard not to say survivors who ruin the game for killers trying to have fun isn't a big reason why many killers feel like they need to play a certain way, so they don't have to put up with it. That behavior is splitting this community apart into hardcore killers, and hardcore survivors. I play both survivor and killer, even though I rarely get toxicity from killers via messaging, I know it happens. The main point of this post was to use just 2 people to let these kinds of people willingly make their presence know so they can prove my point that survivors who do this are the main problem, and sure enough, it worked. You're the first person who wasn't overly aggressive, and disagreed with the behavior. Everyone else has been scolding me and defending them, saying I was the toxic one, not them, even though they messaged me, and I was being as mature as I could be about the situation without backing down and playing second fiddle.
---
Yeah Id love that but I dont think they wanna pay for a licence from a child molester .-.
---
Uhh where is Dwight?
---
I love hawkins(stranger things map) as killer. Even as billy. There are so many unsafe pallets that become obstacles for survivors if you dont break them.
---
I think its more so because all of your replies are condescending
---
Tried, can't find it anywhere.
---
Wait um WHAT!?
---
Yup, I play survivor 99% of the time. A while ago I wanted to try killer and it surprised me how mean others could be, kinda broke my heart at the time. I got better and got a lot more respect and understanding for killers, though I def prefer playing survivor most of the time.
---
Well Rank Reset just happened, people want to pip and get back to their proper Ranks, so yeah, you aren't helping with that very much and I guess they'd rather spoil your fun and double depip than bother trying. 
---
I wouldn't DC though, I still want all my BP after looping the Killer to filth for being so audacious.
---
Wig
---
If anything stating the edit message is what makes you less arrogant since you admit there were flaws and changed them for the better.
---
I stopped seeing the point in prestiging after they started putting out really cool cosmetics.
---
Its on xbox gamepass
---
That's technically the truth in the Entity's realm
---
Slenderman. Vendigos. They are not exactly from games but they still have games about them
---
*laughs in killer*
---
It's been glitching out and taking items even when you escape. Its really annoying.
---
They were selling you out in the hope they could get away themselves, luckily killers don't always take kindly to that :')
---
i'm deaf so welcome to the club
---
But nobody cares. It's arrogant to assume people - anyone - cares about fixing a tiny mistake in your post. It's like an attempt at a humble brag: "Oh, fixed a TINY grammar mistake in my amazing post. Seriously, other than that it was amazing, which is why I fixed the tweak. I assume hundreds have people have read it. I'm kind of a big deal'.
---
EDIT: fixed minor typo. Hopefully I can still get my Nobel prize.
---
A tyrant or Mr X from Resident evil would be good
---
Thats annoying I usually have loads cos I play a lot so that must suck.
---
As a Killer main, I would find this hilarious, except it happened to me.
---
Therefore I'm sad :C
---
Spirits a hard killer to go against but a lot of the people complaining are doing so because they can 1v1 most killers. This is a 1v4 game, yet most killers can lose the match if a strong survivor 1v1s them. This should a be a simple solution, just dont aggro and youll be fine right? But what happens when you face 4 strong survivors, ruins gone, and they have plenty of pallets? Now you have to figure out if you want to tunnel one person and get a good hook location to change momentum, or go to another survivor and hope they fuck up unlike the one you were just after. Does this make Spirit okay? No. But it's what we're gonna get until killers are actually suitable for chases.
---
Ok smartass, instead of being a cunt come up with a valid reply.
---
If you think Iron Will only counters the spirit then you are using it wrong.
---
also dumb fuck I already did, watch the video
---
Yes
---
I only had to change like ten words mate this is the thanks I get for defending your shit meme lmao
---
When I see a lobby with 2 or more flashlight I bring lightborn with franklins
---
Haha neither do my parents sleeping in the next room
---
dedicated servers time
---
this killer is annoying af! he has one scream that gets played every time he successfully hits someone and a donkey noises when he breaks pallets or damages a gen or gets stunned, Also his chase music is loud and distorted.
---
Pig is actually quite loud for some unknown reason.  
---
And I think Spirit is the loudest.
---
Would the license allow them to buy the musics for the game? It's so good it really deserves to be in there
---
Paying Sony for online that used to be free on PS3 ? And joking about being "cool" ? :D Seriously XD!?
---
No, I made this account because this is the first subreddit I've been on where I actually wanted to comment on posts and I didn't know what else to call myself. Also, all I did was give the guy some advice against versing Spirit why are you shitting on me?
---
Yesssss
---
I'm so sorry that happened to you! Currently the matchmaking is a bit of a mess, only worsened by the rank reset. I think it's indeed best to take a few days off, so to speak.   
---
What helped me when I started out was to just watch some videos. One of my favourites was noob3, more memeing than educational, but I still picked a few things up from that.
---
You really don't want to rank up, at least at lower ranks you get players who may not be as good but finish the game to their ability, red ranks have people DC on first down when they get mind gamed or   the killer waited for their dead hard and hit them.
---
The fact that he hid behind you is both hilarious and adorable, I'm glad you both got out!
---
Cry me a river
---
Find a duo man , play with someone else , this way you'll have a way easier time ranking up
---
There is no point in trying to fix nea..
---
Yes no shit, it says nothing about a regressing gen
---
I ranked down to yellow and get paired with yellow and under and was faced with these same problems tonight. Green - purple I feel like is a pretty safe rank to be at. :( I honestly just want to have fun on the game again.
---
"Waaah im too good for yall none of you deserve someone as good ss me waaahh"
---
Well thats because red ranks are currently yellow-purple cause of the reset yesterday. Midmonth ranks 15-8 is the best place to be.
---
That's true. I've never played with a full team before so maybe that would help out a lot. Thx :)
---
It‚Äôs kinda hard to tolerate the migraines I get from their galaxy brain plays sometimes, but they are cute
---
Let them fight.
---
Yes. At the start of each trialy each trap is linked to one specific box. However, it is possible that multiple traps are linked to the same box - vice versa that there are boxes that dont contain keys to any of the traps.
---
Bro that's amazing! glad you all got out \^\^
---
If I recall correctly, a box can contain more than one key which is linked to a RBT
---
I got messages like this as well and when I posted about it I also got downvoted by survivor mains that deny toxicity being a problem. Survivors can be toxic as much as they want but as soon as the killer does anything about it they‚Äôre the bad guy. The same survivors that message you GG EZ will start crying in your messages if you kill them next time you find them.
---
To be honest I feel no sympathy for swines who use Commodious Boxes, and much less with those addons.
---
Also idk if it's intentional but then again killers lose their addons every game unless they use a black ward soooo
---
are those 4 ranks REALLY gonna change the quality of your matches
---
DC's can be so discouraging, especially as a new player. Bless you for showing mercy on that little Jake! &lt;3
---
White noise is actually very good, the graphics, the concept, the map design, everything just feels nice
---
Too bad games dead
---
Same to surv coz finding a new game is better than just sitting there
---
Nice! you're now their new parent, enjoy your kids!
---
As your soul escaped you left behind your body
---
I find it best to prestige in alternating pairs
---
Ideally with two characters you want to prestige,  you burn all your fun addons and offerings on say huntress to save up 1 mill bps,  hit the button and level her up to 34-42 with your saved up bps.  
---
Then swap over to the other killer you want to prestige lets say trapper, burn all his fun addons and offerings as you finish leveling up huntress to 50 and saving up your next 1 million bps.   Then you can hit the prestige button on trapper, level him up to 34-42, and swap back to playing huntress.
---
You can flip flop between two killers and sooner then you expect both are prestige 3, and you had a ton of fun.
---
Not us I'm afraid, we're all Dwights!
---
"I didn't once insult their race, or sent them threats"
---
Do you want a medal for being moderately less of an ass than you decided to be?
---
You know that people say "EZ" as bait, right? And you bit pretty hard.
---
This actually happened with the Evan (Trapper), when the Entity first grabbed him and told him to kill he refused because the only person he killed for was his father. The charred skin and hooks/spikes in his back are the result of the Entity's torture.
---
I'm sorry that's happening to you :/  
---
I'm a lucky one in that regard, mine are surprisingly varied, so there's hope!
---
Why is the Hag not going for Nancy who's closer to her? Why are you running ahead of Nancy when you have DS? Why are the two full hp teammates just sitting at the exit gate not going for save/taking a hit? 
---
I'm so confused :/
---
Hahaha that sucks must be a bug
---
I'm super interested in your scientific purposes, pls keep updating me about your science research.
---
This has been the last few weeks. Even playing Killer, if survivors are really, really good, the majority I‚Äôve seen will teabag at the littlest thing, even the last one if I‚Äôve got a 3k. I normally get 4K with Hag, maybe 4/5 times, and if I win, I‚Äôll get called all of the names except my own. üòÇüòÖüò≠
---
Spirit: Literally killed no one, came home to her dad and got murdered
---
Entity:
---
Hag was tunneling me because I had scoops ahoy, Nancy was my friend, they also had ds, and the other 2 were scared because of noed
---
Pressing 1 and 2 is my thing
---
She‚Äôs also nicknamed the Bubonic Babe
---
So sad
---
Don't even worry about ranking up. It gets harder to get into a lobby in the higher ranks. Rage quitting occurs far more from both survivors and killers alike. And it gets boring as survivor. Pretty much every game is nurse and hillbilly running hex ruin and bbq &amp; chilli. Boring and repetitive. At least at lower ranks there's more variety.
---
Ah, well i should've paid more attention, didn't notice the Exposed status effect :P
---
I had a survivor that did this and all he could think to do was crouch and pray, just shook my head and hit the wall next to him so he got the message that I was giving him a head start
---
Yeah you have a point lmao
---
Look-see would be fun
---
"You can't sit with us!!"
---
Yeah you get banned for using a different mouse than others in a video game.
---
That wouldn't work I get your idea but your game knowledge of loops doesn't change bc of the killer *not counting nurse* so if you know how to mind game successfully *not by standing still as a spirit* you're gonna be 100x better than a rank 20-15 that just started
---
Without, if possible
---
Where do you think, playing dead by daylight boi
---
No i mean like I go from 1400 dpi to 2100 dpi
---
I mean like I didn‚Äôt know about mori‚Äôs and stuff until I saw it being discussed on here or practically anything about killers in general. Most killers I‚Äôve encountered don‚Äôt have any of them in their loadout so it was a new experience lol
---
I feel like map pressure is his one strong trait, why buff that
---
So you just ignore majority of the claudettes then?
---
i usually don't like cute comics, but this is actually amazing.
---
Why wouldn't it be allowed?
---
dont be a dick hes thinking about like the spin bot hacks.
---
thats fine, just dont listen to any of those "A is OP" "B is crutch" "C is against the rules" BS in here :)
---
Idk. Just because I could click a button and do a ez 360 and it wouldn't be really fair for the killer
---
When ace is in the same tier as that stupid bitch claudette
---
Removing unfun builds seems like a good start
---
That's so cute mate. You should consider doing more of those if you enjoyed it ! ;D
---
Because they think they might not win
---
You just need to allow dbd in the firewall
---
Riperoni in pepperoni
---
Dbd has previously worked last week when all the ports were open
---
well now that I have you here, idk what OP means in terms of this game. I think I understand it‚Äôs not good but I see it used a lot
---
 It just means you have to use 1 blink tactically..
---
This is adorable, No you cannot get banned in pretty much any game for changing your mouse sensitivity.
---
overpowered
---
I'm not used to do that kind of vibe, that's was a premiere to me. There's an other one I did a year ago on the channel, it's called "an empire beyong the sandstorm" if that may interest you !
---
Man, that sounds terrible, especially for the wait times killer have, only to have everyone DC on them. Smh
---
Okay. Thanks :3. I've always been paranoid about bans in this game since it's my only paid game and it's my favorite.
---
Dont be toxic to the babies. We were a baby once too
---
Thank you so much mate ! That was a lot of research and information digging about mesopotamia and Sumerian civilization ! Glad you enjoyed &lt;3
---
Gotcha! That makes sense, thank you!
---
So cool to see you Plague mains enjoying it &lt;3
---
That is what i call     F U N
---
That would be a missed opportunity to not working on this subject !
---
Eh for the rule 18+ rule I feel it really only applies to Survivors really as killing kids or teens is pretty bad but if a teenager kills it doesn't really have stigma against or anything meaning it'd be fine.
---
some powers are a little hard to understand at first, like legion's or demogorgen's killer instincts. Most other killers are pretty straight forward with their abilities though. I'd definitely recommend watching a couple of youtube videos about their powers though :) that will certainly make your life a whole lot easier.
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Yes it would be ! That's what Im planning to do ! Glad you enjoyed Kat &lt;3
---
Yeah purple and reds get set back to 12
---
Haha yeah that could be really funny and add some atmosphere to the game I think
---
I am talking about things in general, it doesn't matter if BHVR fucks up and then REFUSES to fix the issue for literally half a year like we've seen with infinite loading screens earlier this year. People will either excuse BHVR saying "makein da games iz hard" or they'll just continue to buy the fucking DLCs and cosmetics from the store.
---
&lt;3
---
It's so much fun to just completely change objective in these kind of situations. Did you succeed?
---
I'm not even new and this game leaves a shit taste in almost every game so i have to play killer instead most of the time
---
Oceana servers theres this guy called rapture, hes friggen amazing as nurse on xbox. I dodge his lobby every time now because hes so good. Nurse isnt bad on console, just alot harder to master than pc. We are both red ranks.
---
Oh wow Tiffa thank you o much for those lovely words &lt;3
---
When you fail the vibe check
---
Im really glad you felt it, it was a huge challenge to create it !
---
Is there a sub for unintentional refferences
---
No one but sweaty swfs play like that
---
Dude everyone is downvoting OP and his reasonable replies to your dumb fucking comments telling him to man up. I get that he may seem a little worked up but toxicty is a big problem on this game, and OP tried to make light of it, and it looks like youre mad at him for even responding. And OP is trying to express a major which everyone is replying the same garbage and getting their dumb coment shitalking OP upvoted. What the actual fuck is this subreddit anymore?!
---
Thx for the discordance proc
---
I'm pretty certain they are still free?
---
It's a crutch perk
---
Awesome
---
This makes people to disconnect when they realise it's the spirit they are facing. Imo needs more rework than nurse.
---
DAMN! I swear the fan art just gets better and better on this sub, we have some talented artists here for sure.
---
Id change the speed at which you can switch between shock therapy and punishment and probably make it around half the time to switch.
---

This fanart makes me want to hug spirit instead of crouch and avoid her üò≠üíï
---
I'll take it means I get to enjoy some babies
---
So you like your women decapitated and naked? Weird kink
---
It's fine I was laughing my ass off as the final survivor in my nurse game was just staring at me and her DCd friends. I gave her hatch and she wanted to say sorry on their behalf
---
Ah yes my new steam pfp.
---
Lol this guy just went on a crusade methinks he Dost protest too much
---
Yo someone should make a joke out of this
---
is there that big of a difference between the two things happening? like.. 3.5k points right? less from other points you might get between the unhook and their escape (such as protection).
---
Where is freddy?
---
A problem I have most of the time is when I see an opportunity to shock someone it goes like this:
---
The survivor goes toward the window, I get in range to be able to shock, I charge my shock, the shock trigger but its not instant it take like 0.5 second to get to the survivor, the survivor get shocked but the interupt isnt instant it also take around 0.3 seconds to stop the survivor from using the window or the pallet.
---
If the shock was intant after charging it that would be a bit more reliable.
---
I feel like a rework would be nice. Something like injecting downed players to give them some sort of debuff.
---
Movement Speed in **Treatment Mode** \- 110% -&gt; 112%
---
Make it so shock's shape looks like [that](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/615871048172306443/633257429810937856/unknown.png) to make it easier to use when survivor's close (make **Interview Tape** also work slightly behind him)
---
Increase the range of his shock 
---
Base: \~8.7m -&gt; 10m
---
**Mouldy Electrode**: 11m -&gt; 13m (from 25% to 30%, 2m more)
---
**Polished Electrode**: 13m -&gt; 14m (from 50% to 40%, 1m more)
---
**High Stimulus Electrode**: 15m -&gt; 15m (from 75% to 50%, no change)
---
all of the add-ons above:  Increases the charge time by **20%**. no matter which one is used
---
Doc also has only one ultra-rare. I have no idea what to put there tho
---
Not sure how it works on console so enlighten me
---
Very true
---
He probably goes in the doesn‚Äôt eat anything.
---
This is cute af, MOAR
---
Fookin Boris m8
---
Micheal actually eats dogs. Other times he eats whatever is given at the asylum or something.
---
Just know you turn survivors toxic by facecamping. It goes both ways.
---
Oh yes that is a nice flair
---
All of them.
---
this is fake. 
---
lower ranks are less likely to go for altruism. 
---
just watch one of montos bubba's basement videos and you'll see that high ranks are the ones who think they are the shit and go for altruism
---
I don't seem to have this problem, but I'm exclusively playing with headphones
---
*Urban evasions away*
---
I‚Äôm not just talking about those slugged that DC but also those that get find the first 15 seconds, those that get hooked to fast, oh no iri huntress, no hooks after 5gens, got flashlight‚Äôd when I was carrying a survivor and 50 other BS reasons why anyone DCs. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind getting my ass handed to me, I don‚Äôt have any ego anyway so who cares but cheating so the killers have a lower chance of getting a 4K.  
---
And yes, DCing is cheating because it IS punishable by a ban and was not in design of the game.
---
I am a P3 Level 50 spirit main and every since I P3'd I havent gotten a single Prayer Beads.
---
David trying to get the Dead hard
---
100% agree. Just prayer Beads and she's good.

Kind of want this as a skin in game now, with the glowing sword and maybe minus the singular horn

#CLAP DEM CHEEKS
---
Don't worry. I knew this was going to happen. You can scroll through indivual replies I've made where I specifically say the point was to draw out a bunch of toxic kiddies by only using 2 messages. us killers are always playing victims, but when you reply negatively to toxicity, you're villified by the entire sub. It's not my fault that most people here are sheep survivor mains who fell for my bait, and proved my point by being more toxic than the people in the messages. This sub is extremely one sided. Mainly to the survivors, but they have the audacity to act like it's only killer mains who whine and complain about swf. All we are to them are a bunch of losers who act like the victim, so I decided to switch it up and show them how fucking gullible they are.
---
They immediately save him before second state Entity appears.
---
Didn't happen to me and it was not an act of kindness but, last night a spirit dropped my friend at the gate and let him open and as she swung for ym friend he dead harded out of there. And generally I burn out super fast on the game but right now playing GF is keeping me in the game on the daily
---
At what % did you set the ingame volume if I may ask? And you have probably enabled the headphone setting in the option, correct?
---
The middle of your camera has to be on his face from my own experience.
---
Also this guy is very immersive. Ha :) (saved him though so it's a good thing.)
---
Thank you that's certainly useful!
---
No I haven't used any of those tools. I just have a friend that is colorblind so I got interested at the time about solutions doctors suggested to slightly improve his condition and so on.
---
Also learnt there was many kind of colorblindness at the time too.
---
Since I love this game I want to make everyone enjoy it that's why I advocate for colorblind people and who has problems with their hands for example. That are unable to press the same button repeatedly, brought it up on the official forum before getting banned for telling a person to ignore certain people harassing him.
---
Wish they consider these changes that won't affect anybody but make everything more enjoyable for who struggles even to see what's in the screen. I will save your comment, will be very useful for next interactions
---
I rarely face camp unless they go beyond cancer. Messaging me in game type of shit. I will say I blame most face camps on survivors who bully killers and make them think that they have to face camp to avoid this type of treatment.
---
Same!
---
I'd honestly prefer they start buffing the killers who aren't played as much instead of nerfing the ones who do get played a lot.
---
The entity still tortures them, but I get what you mean
---
‚ÄúLegit‚Äù legit?
---
Any chance you have images? I'm certain a fair bit of people would find them interesting. Might even be worth making an entire thread. Maybe not the DbD sub, but on another sub such as games or gaming. Even the mildly interesting sub could find it so.
---
I‚Äôd say Pig
---
In a couple movies, yeah.
---
keyboard + mouse
---
It‚Äôs funny when I play killer on the rare occasion I make sure I don‚Äôt face camp but tunnelling nah bro you deaddd some survivors literally want you to hold their had for the game instead of chasing and killing is mad
---
That's really good. I would love to see a drawing of the Nurse.
---
heck yeah I got it free and dont regret it
---
As a killer, I only use that mori when I have a daily to do so. And I usually wait until near endgame and even then, I'll use it on people that would have died if I hooked them anyway, mostly because, yes, it's as crappy as using a key to exit the hatch in the middle of a game. As a survivor, I understand that it sucks but it doesn't occur frequently and a new match is only minutes away.
---
Gojifan793 I have only played rando matches so far.
---
Consoles do get Bill now though :)
---
Also mindbreaker so op guys nerf killer guys
---
Oh. My. God. Shut the hell up! It‚Äôs just ‚ÄúEz gg‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúGG lol I fucked yo mama‚Äù 
---
This isn‚Äôt report-worthy. It‚Äôs only report worthy if they‚Äôre basically just swearing and insulting you. You‚Äôre basically just fragile. And it‚Äôs all because ‚ÄúEz gg‚Äù
---
This is so cute &lt;33 \^,..,\^
---
You‚Äôre one to talk. Prayer beads spirit
---
You‚Äôre one of those aren‚Äôt you
---
Go for it.  You miss 100% of the window lunges you don't take.
---
Absolutely. Anyone can win with Spirit. A rank 1 spirit is the equivalent of a rank 18 killer.
---
Dude fucking yes. I actually want that as a skin. I will real shit go full blown wallet warrior and spent $30 on this.
---
And yet swf get a free pass, despite murdering the game balance.
---
But I don't see so good
---
Pig would probably win a fashion show amongst the killers
---
Let‚Äôs group up when you‚Äôre able. And I just added you.

Teat the game impersonally and not worry about points, pips, or what anyone else is doing. Even as a "nice" killer, I will still experience "jerk" behavior from time to time. Same goes when playing survivor. But there are also fun times. Live for the good encounters/matches and forget the rest.
---
Aren‚Äôt the people who paid the cool ones since they‚Äôre actually supporting the game by paying a small fee?

Found the rank 10 trash

Yeah, I remember as well. Ques weren‚Äôt so bad, now they‚Äôre just awful. Sometimes I just really don‚Äôt want to play because of being in lobby for so long. Plus the bugs really do not help.

I can't tell if the hair looks good or not :/  as long as it has decent physics... let's hope

This is just so heartwarming :D
---
Almost all of us are broke to get the characters, it sucks for all of us my friend.

honestly us killers should know the ranks of the survivors before getting in game
---
*obligatory ‚Äúmy killer is better than yours‚Äù*
---
Nah, man:  [this](https://youtu.be/ZnHmskwqCCQ) is the ultimate chase music for all killers.
---
It's definitely the best comic in here!
---
All three are overpowered as shit.
---
Hmm that's weird, for me it's quite the opposite, killer lobbies are almost instant while survivor ones take 5-15min.
---
Thanks!!! I love you all!!!
---
This is the first tier list on this sub that I've ever upvoted.
---
People with standard eyesight are unlikely to appreciate the severity of the problem until they're shown images or footage.
---
For best results you'd need a popular streamer and a method of real time colour conversion. Mind you, popular streamers have recorded gameplay of them using controllers and we're still no closer to controller sensitivity being close to a match for the mouse.
---
I have some games where I go out of my way to not go by the hook someone just got unhooked at, to be nice. I go away from the hook to check a gen and unhooked survivor is running there basically in to me. I am now a tunneler in postgame.
---
You just dropped it late
---
When you drop the pallet you stand still while the swing keep going forward, so stun or not you'll get hit
---
It's intended, a stun doesn't mean you have iFrames, just you stunned the killer. That's it
---
my suggestions to buffing the perk would be 1st the obsession is effected by the debuff so that means gen speed and healing so every stack takes away 3% to the obsessions 33% healing buff. 2nd thing is when obsession dies u dont lose ur stacks this prevents people from dcing to make u lose ur perk. 3rd thing is make it where u get stacks from hooking the obsession too. with these 3 buffs combined the perk would be really close to being how good it used to.
---
Nice
---
If was a killer idea would've been more accurate
---
Video credit goes to Mr-Merciless on youtube, i made the meme, the original footage is his.
---
Imagine a stand user as killer
---
Damn this killer is like rank -1
---
Is spireh fancy?
---
So hatch stand offs were fine? Giving the last survivor more power than the killer at the end of the game..
---
Your feet, hand them over
---
Why you dont play killer?
---
Always gotta be ready in scenarios like that when it's down to the last gen
---
Nearly peak gen inefficiency.
---
Yea I‚Äôm pretty sure he can. I think it‚Äôs if he gets close enough it when your vaulting something. It‚Äôs happened to me too and I was super confused but it‚Äôs a thing that he can do
---
remember me is a wasted perk tbh it adds 16 seconds to the gates which is literally nothing
---
Unfortunately, no :(
---
Head is the part of the body model, so it changes with the body (obviously). If developers will make a possibility to not wear the mask for some killers - that would be great, I think. Just for now we can only enjoy maskless renders
---
I run head on lol
---
Tombstone Myers states you can immediately kill anyone healthy injured or down via mori
---
damn thats fucked
---
it's an add on
---
Tombstone Myers
---
2 of his addons allow Myers to instantly mori you in tier 3. He cannot lunge and to mori you you must not be performing an action or be in a locker.
---
pinky fingers a bit broken to be his base kit
---
I actually really like bitter murmer on her, Nothing like across the map hatchets :D
---
This comic makes me reconsider how harsh I am to survivors. I see them all as SWiF but maybe some are like this in my games... mhm.
---
The Wendigo from Until Dawn or someone from Outlast like Chris Walker or the Wallrider
---
So you got looped by a single player for 5 gens?

I have no idea what ya'll are saying but it's hilarious that it sounds like you guys are freaking out just like we did lmao

Then sometimes im a sweaty tryhard and murder everyone, c'est la vie!
---
I mean there is a thing and survivors are stronger than killers RN. Seems like a git gud issue OP.
---
idk. Searched the quote on Google and got sent to a cut-down video of it. Popped it into a GIF maker, added some subs and \*boom\*.
---
new GIF.
---
I get so many error messages as well. Takes me until about the 3rd lobby to actually get a survivor game.
---
It seriously shouldn't be, it's got pretty shit graphics TBH. I got it for free as well, and for how long the wait times are for matches I'll never buy ANY dlc for it. They almost had me at Ash Williams but I didn't bite.
---
Hey atleast you make it clear that you solo q because people literally cant play with you unless they're wearing toxic hazmat suits
---
And everyone is talking about toxicity. This is wholesome.
---
I'm a memey player. But I need to get back to my rank. I don't feel right playing against lower rank players. It feels unfair.
---
Welcome to the game :). Ignore them. Just have fun. As long as u are not staring at the hook only. Any other steregies as a new guy is ok. Have fun!
---
you're not only a pussy but a bot
---
Be nice to new killers! Sacrifice yourself ;)
---
She's working with the base kit's duration, recharge time, and speed, though. She'd be better off dropping the green one and putting something else in that slot. This won't be good for getting people at range, and you need to choose exactly when to stop so you don't just overshoot and spend the speed boost just zooming around in a confused circle.
---
No bad advice. Just don‚Äôt stare at hooks and just play normally
---
The wait times for PlayStation are still bad as survivor and especially as killer. In 1 hour, a typical hour you can get 3 matches. That's pretty unacceptable. This has improved mind you, before I think during the moonshine event it took so damn long I was only able to get 1 of the costumes.
---
Doctor main here, hi.
---
Buffing Doctor is extremely dangerous because he already curbstomps lower ranks, but at high ranks he's like a C tier at best. His major weakness is his heavy reliance on addons, so let's solve that.
---
1) Base shock therapy range increased by 30%. Electrode addon numbers changed to 20%, 40% and 60%. His base range is literally pathetic.
---
2) Decrease the time it takes to switch between modes from 1 second to 0.8. Makes him feel more fluid and makes shock therapy a more reliable chase tool.
---
3) Speaking of which, shock therapy's ability to stop actions is laughably inconsistent. Decrease the time it takes after firing to hit the survivor, and make it able to stop actions more consistently.
---
4) The part of Restraint allowing you to see Hallucination auras on T2 survivors is now base kit. Rework that part of the Restraint addon to Hallucinations will slowly build madness on a survivor facing their camera towards them, and increase madness to the equivalent of 50% of a shock therapy when they run into one to make it disappear.
---
Interesting! Again, I‚Äôm not as deeply invested in the game yet as the majority of the community so I don‚Äôt know the ins-and-outs of perk tiers vs. their usefulness. Whichever way it would be implemented, it could be interesting to see players being challenged to tailor a perk loadout passed on this sort of system rather than just selecting all the best perks. Thanks for your thoughtful feedback!
---
I've used Legions frenzy to find people in lockers.
---
I know this is old, but it's just did it on stream last night, you can catch the vodka on twitch. It's called "Sandbagging with friends #1"
---
Actually a mobile game called Identity V (asymmetrical horror game like DBD) has a mechanic in place that could fit quite nicely. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù button that any survivor can activate so if the whole team is downed and slugged, you can activate surrender, if everyone in-game agrees to surrender then the game is ended as if you died through the normal means. 
---
I‚Äôve been slugged so many times and it‚Äôs infuriating because you can‚Äôt do anything about it without DC‚Äôing which means losing all your blood points earned AND appearing like an enormously entitled survivor. It‚Äôd be nice to have game mechanic that save survivor‚Äôs the pain of having to wait forever before a game inevitably ends.
---
People who say "You saw"-anything should be smacked with a rolled up newspaper. If I saw it, I would have reacted accordingly. It's like when you get spectated in an FPS and someone says, "You saw him right there on the right." If I saw him, I would have shot at him. Goddamnit pet peeves.

What the fuck is this subreddit

Lance Corporal Calder from Dead Rising 4 possibly.

Yesterday I had a game against a spirit, I spawned in literally right next to her ruin totem. Later on, I was doing the last gen with another claudette while the other 2 were distracting her. The gen was near a Dull totem, the second we popped it the totem lit up with her NOED.
---
I almost felt bad... almost.

Well, it's technically not necrophillia

I used the exact same perk loadout before. Its amazing

There are lots of things that suck in this game. Match winning tactics loose you rank points. Having to pass up a survivor to be fair is pretty weak. Is it tunneling if you cant tell who it is?

The worst is using stealth to gen grab gives you 0 points in chase killing your score in up to two categories.

I just 2 hook people above rank 15 when i play as killer after rank resets , and let them escape after that.
---
You must be the hatch, because I wanna jump down into you.
---
I either eat like Spirit or Clown. There is no inbetween
---
Yes let me run in a straight line and you can kill me, if they can't cut their losses and stop chasing you then that's on them.
---
It happened to me, though the only reason it occurred in the first place was because it was in The Game, and me and 2 of my teammates were in the bathroom. (I also decided to run into Leatherface when he had a tantrum. Yeah, I was hitting myself over the head when the obvious happened.) Also, question. If someone checks a locker next to you, do you also immediately sprint out of the one you're in, or do you stay in it, and hope the killer leaves? I sprint out so I can get a head start.
---
Teabags and flashlight clicks are usually a sign of bm while it can be a decent strategy to make the killer hate you so you can buy your team time and for me personally I don‚Äôt really consider it toxic but annoying when you wait at an exit for me to show up just to run out last second,

I had something similar in one of my first games as killer as well, except I was actually trying lol. It's kinda disheartening tbh and I still mostly stick with survivor. I have a lot of respect for the killer mains out there! Especially if you don't let the toxicity get to you.

Yeah i wish rank reset didn't exist so i didn't have to play with shits like you. Get the fuck outta here Stranger Things trash

I think you misspelled Clown
---
Probably because the Game is fairly easy to run on as a survivor once you know it, it has a fair amount of safe pallets. Plus Balanced is really strong on the Game.

I'm expecting downvotes by saying this, but I'm saying it anyway. There's turning as soon as you hear the blink... Remember, she can't turn while blinking. If she can, it's not by much. Remember, a good nurse is trying to predict where you're gonna be at when the blink ENDS, rather than where you are now, and she can't predict an erratic player. Move towards her, run away from the pallet, fake a vault! She can't cancel the blink either once she starts it, so use that to your advantage!
---
Ghostface seems like the BBQ Fritos type. Frank can have the stale funions.
---
Me and the boys getting ready to bully the killer until they commit suicide
---
I'm not hating in any shape or form, I just saw a similar system in Friday the 13th and good lord it was a shit show. Then again that's just a compliment considering the game started off well then just shit itself when the devs didn't want to work. Dbd however has the potential to keep getting better. But i feel as if the default perk system or just switching tiers of perks would be better.
---
The only thing i really hqte about ruin , is that it's random, you could get 0 skill checks or you could get 10 in a row, i wish it just slowed progress all together

---
OMG my thoughts exactly. I mean I like their concept but their backstory is extremely underwhelming. They're in a group with things like the Incarnation of Pure Evil, a dream demon, a literal demon and Supernatural entities and in the end there just four edgy teens who killed a janitor. Like what?

What do you play on? A really nice Jane saved me  (a baby) the other night on PS4 on the Game map. She healed me out of the dying state near the exit gates, then the Demo caught up to her and I couldn‚Äôt save her before I escaped. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to thank her.
---
Me too brother, me too
---
Lets*
---
Not hold down shift 24/7
---
Fair enough
---
A pallet a day, keeps the killer away
---
So satisfying...
---
Give it to me daddy dwight
---
I‚Äôm with you, I am terrible at using flashlight as well, nor am I good as Killer so I‚Äôm screwed too. The idea of hooking multiple people in the basement means a basement Trapper or bubba build and will also lead to disconnects meaning you don‚Äôt get your challenge done. It seems they need to think these through more.
---
I see your Ultra Instinct wore off
---
They‚Äôre contributing to gens partially cause unless if they run past a gen a mate‚Äôs working on everyone else can work on generators safely
---
I actually quite like the sound of this perk tbh. When I play survivor if the early game goes quick I normally know that the game will be easy. But if it's a slow start with people on the hook when 5 gens are left I know it's gonna be a rough one. I do think this would be helpful to killers learning the game
---
Face could be better, the hatchet could be held differently, maybe a little bit more details but other than that good job
---
One of the big reasons I run bond.
---
you're not going to escape a hit when within lunge range and medium vault 
---
ffs
---
everything you post is either a fine hit or latency
---
Are you confused. No one said anything about this
---
A good reason to not teabag, once I killed the obsession with 8 stacks of save the best for last as demogorgon and when exits were powered I only pounced on survivors to make them think i didn't have NOED. I killed 2 extra people that game
---
They only need to slug if at least 1 person is obsession.
---
And I was wondering if this was the reason... super nice of them to fuck their team mates over.
---
Truth hurts, i know
---
You‚Äôre forgetting the cursed Christmas sweater

---
Does anyone else show them the hatch then take them to a chest just so they can get a gift?
---
This post is mindbogglingly stupid and I don't even know where to begin
---
This isn't the cost. 
---
If you buy when items are on sale, the cost is far cheaper.
---
I bought all licensed characters when they were on sale, total cost was $27 and change. Base game also on sale, was something like $12. I have just 3 killers left to buy using free in game currency. So my total cost for the game is roughly $40.
---
Cosmetics do not count. That's entirely optional.
---
It hit me when I was more than already falling.
---
This whole medium vault argument you guys keep going back to is starting to get tiresome. 
---
Medium vaults don‚Äôt expand my hitbox across the entire drop.
---
I‚Äôve played for enought time, even since medium vaults were released, to know that shouldn‚Äôt happen.
---
Automatic upvote from me because Frank.
---
Wow, you used DS. Congrats ur a pro gamer
---
There is a perk that punishes bodyblocking when carrying someone (Mad Grit)
---
We should start calling those two types of bodyblocking differently...
---
Kate found the hatch first? He hooked the 3rd survivor near the hatch - i dont expect any intelligence from survivor mains but please watch the video again 
---
As for the glitch - she had absolutely no chances of winning this so yes, she should just give up to the killer, but as i said again - survivors have absolutely no morals and will exploit anything to get a win, coming from the history of dbd like blocking windows from infinites
---
No
---
Alright, what about the meta break with slug builds and hex builds? What about tombstone Myers? This perk with thanaphobia on a plague? There are so many situations that make this perk idea overpowered
---
or make it where u gain boldness every 10 seconds the killer is within 24m of the hook
---
And if it‚Äôs latency, that‚Äôs exactly what I want fixed.
---
Oh lawdy, I mean that's more another kind of subreddit material right there
---
Survivor: \*Uses Flashlight\*
---
Spirit: Oooo pretty \*preceeds to not avoid it at all\*
---
True true regardless they‚Äôd be a great monster to have
---
tombstones a black pip at best, slug builds u dont pip with either. Hex build would be a bit strong on so maybe make it not effect totems speed. this perk with thana on plague would be decent but after she gets 4 hooks she loses her perk so wouldnt be broken
---
i‚Äôve lost multiple times as i bet every spirit player has
---
I'll meet yah half way:
---
Both instaheals use half the medkit.
---
Why?
---
Idk, controversy?
---
Has this exact thing happen with a NOED killer. Just getting out of the hospital for my aneurysm
---
For the hatch she got there first and could of waited but no you just want to insult people instead of watching.
---
Sure she might not of had a chance but still it would dumb to just let your self die. Just because you want to play and live doesn't mean you dont have morals. Just about what i expected from a dumb killer main (Sarcasm)
---
Enitity: I'm not taking this bullshit.
---
Ohhhhh Right i forgot about that Xd
---
Looking at the Acheivment stats,
---
Adept Feng Min is the least obtained acheivement in the game above even the hidden acheivements and the new ones with steve and Nancy.

Where's the Feng Love?

Happened to me too. Also called a camper because their friend didn‚Äôt wait long enough to run in and unhook them

I'm glad there are so many of these videos of toxic assholes getting a nice dose of karma
---
In the UK it's 16.

Unfortunately any new killers are added to their collection. *cough* IT *cough*

I just started playing this game like a month ago, im. Still learning

Survivor: Kim Jong un (I forgot his fucking name)
---
Innocent women corrupted by vengeance is still a better backstory than ‚Äúangsty teens murder janitor‚Äù
---
....but u/RadikalNynorsk wasn't defending toxic players, they were questioning your claim that this sub defends toxic players. Turning that into this wall about how your point got proven is....a bit silly.
---
1. I have seen many many perfect killer games with tombstone Myers
---
2. Why the fuck do you think slug builds are so damn popular in the 12-7 rank range? They are damn effective if you play them well
---
3. All the plague would have to do is slug all 4 and then hook em after they are down. Boom, you get 4 sacs and use the perk the whole round.
---
Stuff cost money if you love it who cares people spend money on take out or Alcohol which cost more but all bring enjoyment so not really a waste of money some thots blow 12$ for a fortnite skin lol
---
Wot
---
# PrEtTy GoOd JoB sO fAr.
---
Before the rank reset I Janet feeling bad seeing rank 19s try and loop me and just be really bad at it, sometimes I‚Äôd let it go on a bit if they weren‚Äôt being annoying.
---
Sugoi Spirit Noises.
---
I wish I could leave a message for the killer to see if I die early. Any game that the killer doesn't act shitty I make it a point to say gg, but I'm not willing to sit around more than a minute or so to do it :/
---
okay then don't play a peer to peer game until they get dedicated servers that function well
---
What about for killers? How'd you find this?
---
&gt; This whole medium vault argument you guys keep going back to is starting to get tiresome. 
---
Don't give me this "you guys" shit because I have been a long advocate for making medium vaults more meaningful than they are currently because they are just about as good as slow vaults which is silly
---
&gt; It hit me when I was more than already falling.
---
&gt; Medium vaults don‚Äôt expand my hitbox across the entire drop.
---
It didn't! The hit registry just shows on your end a little late
---
That's only worn by poor Fengs.
---
You ant lying lol
---
Yea
---
Hot dog hot dog hot doggity dog that‚Äôs better to look at than the Legion‚Äôs lore log.
---
and because they are maniacs
---
That type of slugging is pointless at 5 gens because they can stay on gens and rotate while you get no hooks, and the BP gain is atrocious.
---
Mild slugging at 5 gens isn't terrible if you know you can get into another chase quickly and want some immediate pressure, but 4 man slugs are not the best scenario unless you can make sure no one is on gens, and that usually requires them to be close which is unlikely at the start. 
---
(Sorry for going off on a tangent OP).
---
Is say more like 12m and it'll be good
---
"DeDicAtEd seRveRs wiLl fiX thIngS gUyS" except no! That's not how it works, you fucking people dont know how the game works, thinking its hitboxes, no! Its latency, and now you begged and screamed and demanded the dev's switch the game to dedicated servers, something that has more latency than p2p, jesus fucking christ, why do the dev's cave to pressure when its obvious the players dont know what they actually want.
---
Not directed at you, just ranting.
---
You misspelled David King
---
**how dare you lie to us where is our new football?**
---
if people die from 1 hook u can depip from not doing enough especially in red ranks. so yes u can see this happen in lower ranks (which there's already a bunch of dumb shit in lower ranks so that doesnt matter). all I'm getting at is u can slug for 4k but if u dont get enough hooks or chaser points ur not pipping up
---
yeh boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
Personally I prefer the new leaked one over scoops ahoy
---
I‚Äôve gotten plenty of clips where the vaults actually work, and I‚Äôm fine afterwards.
---
And if it‚Äôs hit registry, once again. That is the point of this. It‚Äôs what I want fixed. 
---
A game literally about not getting hit shouldn‚Äôt have this.
---
There needs to be a version where the killer runs the baby out üòÜ
---
It's almost as if dedicated servers are bad for the game
---
Original Steve post made by  [u/BreadPear](https://www.reddit.com/user/BreadPear/)
---
I like the idea but I'd change it ever so slightly. Instead of every hook I'd make it so it's every hook state so u lose a token for every hook state so u can't face camp the survivor. Otherwise I quite like the perk idea
---
Oh god, I had a game today where I was Jane.
---
I was right at the exit gate and I decided to 99% it and run for teammate. I got a hatchet thrown at me so I was injured, then as soon as I unhook the Meg, she gets a hatchet square to the face. I get hit, hooked and die.
---
Also nice Ash meme.
---
How could she got there first when he hooked the third person RIGHT NEXT TO THE HATCH WITH 2 GENS LEFT, and she escapes through the gate so it doesnt matter for shit
---
Think you fuckin inbred, use those 2 last remaining braincells and analyze what you just said
---
let's say within terror radius and call it a day
---
(with the exception of maybe insidious)
---
Nancy set to replace Megs for the Megamind Meg plays!
---
üëç
---
If you look closely you can find one hidden Steve hiding between all those Nancys. Yeah, her perks go from decent to strong, while Steves go from weak to very situnational. Also females are usually more popular to play cause of their smaller posture.
---
&gt; A game literally about not getting hit shouldn‚Äôt have this.
---
uh you're getting dangerously close to saying there should never be window hits
---
Are you joking? I'm going to assume you're joking
---
The amount of reach she gets on they swing always looks broken to me.

I play on low settings. Didn‚Äôt know they were adding 096 as a killer.
---
This is amazing
---
Toxic survivor gameplay = anything that a fragile killer main with feelings on their shoulders seems as offensive.
---
After rank reset the purple and green get send down to yellow ranks and begin to bully the newer players not all but most. In those scenarios I wish they would shoot them up a few ranks so the bully could in turn be destroyed by the red ranks.
---
Retirement isn‚Äôt an escape
---
Thanks. Take my upvote. It's the best I can do
---
Herobrine from Minecraft
---
Nah, window hits should exist. It allows for counterplay and who wouldn‚Äôt hit someone while they are climbing through a window or directly on the other side. (I am saying within reach)
---
What I‚Äôm saying is a game so focused around not getting hit and properly judging if you will or not, should really not have such a latency problem.
---
Yeah been playing ti solo and with a couple friends these last couple days and I'm already dissuaded to continue playing, every match seems to be extremely one sided and un-fun. I don't get upset about losing, but the manner in which I've been losing as a survivor just come across extremely cheap and toxic, not at all a game that encourages new players to pick it up.
---
Dont get the hate you're getting for this comment
---
Who is he ?
---
everyone disconnected (because I was prayer beads and mother-daughter ring spirit) except for this rank 20 baby dweet so I led him to the hatch and he said "Thank you you saint" and that made my day
---
Tell that to non-toxic Claude mains lol
---
e
---
So
---
False reporting is completely accept as correct reports?
---
Gotta love the True Manc phrase! Take my upvote sir!
---
My favorite thing is when the survivor basically puts himself directly in front of you. Like what do you expect me to do? Let you go just to avoid the slight social stigma around "tunneling"?
---
I said *usually*
---
&gt; should really not have such a latency problem.
---
no, it shouldn't. but this post isn't a latency problem. your previous one was tho
---
what system do you play on?
---
It's extremely difficult to get any semblance of learning in gameplay when new survivors are constantly stomped by a killer with fully kitted perks, very dissuading for new players who don't have the know how or even the perks to even compete.
---
Hex: no premarital sex
---
In the beginning when Kate threw the pallet Bubba was there 
---
Think before you post
---
Playstation, which doesn‚Äôt have dedicated servers yet. 
---
If they end up fixing this problem, I will be appeased, if not I will keep posting.
---
You stated yourself that it was to do with latency.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what you just said lol
---
Can‚Äôt agree with you more, had a killer put me on the floor in front of the hatch nod and then close it, he called me trash and said I was stupid to believe he would let me go, there definitely has to be something to punish toxicity even if it is just not being able to communicate in endgame chat
---
Interesting. So the level 1 bloodwebs must not populate until you actually click on them for that character?
---
well maybe the Killer did that to allow the other survivors to get you back up and didnt want to end the game that fast
---
The answer no-one wanted, Imma head out!
---
even if the killer decided to camp both exit gate you would have 100% chance to escape and open both of them ;')
---
No trust me it was a slug fest at its finest
---
Remind me of the time i helped a baby nancy with generators and i had to leave to save a bill from a camping doctor, by time the generators were fixed the doctor cought me and nancy refused to leave infact she saved from the hook when i thought it was hopeless, i never been more proud.
---
Punish the unhooker
---
This is in the patch notes for next update, 600 BP for a DC I believe
---
&gt; You stated yourself that it was to do with latency.
---
No, I said the hit registry was a little late which was probably poor phrasing because I meant it was because of how the animations work for falling; it causes the hit to look later than it was because the drop animation is so fast and detached from hits. If you go back to my first comment I said "you're not going to escape a hit when within lunge range and medium vault" which has been my position the entire time
---
&gt; Playstation
---
yeah I do to and it gets pretty bad
---
I hope the Devs make a boatload of cash and invest more into the Franchise.
---
Unless they tea bag in which case, fuck em
---
THE HAND!!!!, SHE ISNT FAT, SHE HAS BIGER BREASTS, HANDS ARE NOT FAT, THEY ARE ACTUALY HAIRY!
---
Okay let me explain so even a mongoloid like you will understand -
---
With 3 generators already done and 2 left to go with 2 remaining survivors the hatch has already spawned, meaning that the third survivor was hooked near the hatch by the killer
---
But the killer decided to play fair and didnt camp the hatch and the survivor on the hook 
---
But yeah, Kate found the hatch first /s you mumbling moron
---
Ah, right, my bad.
---
Thanks for being calm about this and not screaming at my by the way. Can always enjoy proper conversation.
---
I can agree, but my only problem is she swung pretty late and still got the hit.
---
Yes, the wheezing old lady with a bag over her face "eats healthy"
---
I agree with #2
---
You were going to get the discordance proc anyway if they had all got on the same corrupted gen?
---
Gloryfying exploits in any shape or form is just disgusting, just talking to you makes me feel dumber
---
SHE DIDNT ESCAPE WITH HATCH SO ITS OK SHE USED EXPLOITS TO ESCAPE WITH EXIT GAME
---
it must be hard being so stupid
---
It doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs either ‚Äúsurvive and escape with x‚Äù or ‚Äúsuccessfully open an exit gate‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs never both and escaping through the hatch also counts as survive and escape.
---
Faxxx
---
I like the first two changes, but the last is a no-go for me. I do have a disdain for spirit, but telling players where spirit is at all times with scratch marks would hurt her a lot. (Plus making the scratch marks faint is a feels bad for colorblind people)
---
if it add a cooldown on it and such what I was getting at is 2nd power for each killer to add more variety to how they are played
---
"It must be hard being do stupid" Now look who sounds stupid 
---
Might need to proof read before posting to fast
---
Yxng_svxge_rip_
---
You tryna play in like an hour?
---
Just ignore that shit. Main things to not be ‚Äútoxic‚Äù would be not being an ass at endgame chat and tbagging at exit gate really
---
Cosmetics are optional and yes I see that 10 dollars is a bit to much but I buy them because I want to support the devs and get cosmetics for the killers/survivors I play the most
---
Which still is fair, since you‚Äôre only playing with a few minutes left anyways.
---
Cute art style can you do one of ace I wanna see ace in your cute art style
---
Reporting for disconnections doesn't do anything, they don't even look at them.
---
Bans are tracked and handed out based on how many times people DC within X-time frame.
---
Real talk. A skin similar to this would be dope.
---
I feel like Removing Collision during Phase Walk so she can't just randomly run into you and get a free hit would help
---
What if the other survivors are circling the hook victim waiting for the killer to leave instead of doing gens and the killer knows they are there?
---
Change number 3 is bad. It's supposed to be a mind-game, a guessing game.
---
Honestly with just brown add-ons she's not that great.
---
Try the official one?
---
Yes-huh?
---
Probably because everyone I'm being concerning to deserves it for making massive assumptions and missing the meaning of the post even though it's pretty obvious
---
That's not an "outplay" of anything.
---
Player obviously assumed they were toast upon first being downed and "gave up"...you can tell by the way she stands there like a headlight deer after adrenaline kicks in...like "huh wut happen?"
---
Killer simply slaps her stunned-into-inaction ass back down onto the ground.
---
Nice fake newsing though...feel good with that "outplay", bro?
---
why would he have a lunchkit if he's not going to work though
---
There is one?
---
I fucking love the trapper one great idea and in my opinion LF‚Äôs 2nd ability is that he cans destroy pallets that haven‚Äôt been thrown down. 2 ways of balancing this it takes a long time to do and has a long cool down. Or you have to be in blood lust 1 to do it and you lose BL but it‚Äôs faster.
---
Lord I will still squeeze my hog even if you smite me!
---
Not bad. Don't be afraid of your eraser and focus more on proportion (her head is a bit small, arm and body are thick) and depth - give more of an angled look to the arms, so they don't look flat.
---
You should have put Myers in a tier list by himself that just says dogs
---
If 5 gens were up, how did a RBT kill anyone?
---
Doctors happy juice = insta dc.
---
Ah.

So they are still scummy because they ignore DC reports?

lol doesnt have to be added just a random power suggestion
---
I've heard an idea before of letting the flashlight reveal her during phase. I think it would be a cool item-level thing like with the Hag and Wraith, where having a flashlight would confer an advantage
---
&gt;Allows you to take on the role of **The Shape** in the next Trial. *Your current perks and add-ons will not be used*.
---
&gt;Secret
---
As The Hag, I burned this offering. What's supposed to happen is instead of playing as The Hag, you play as the Offering's killer (The Shape in this case). After that trial ends, the game should have put me back as The Hag.
---
Wait but didn't Plague expose an entire city to the disease after realizing that A, she was infected and B, her prayers weren't saving them?

Oh okay I just thought it was meant to be that way thanks for telling me
---
Halloween 1 Dr. Loomis finds the house Michael has been squatting in while waiting to attack Laurie with a room having a dead dog carcass in it, cut up, a fire pit and a small skillet.  It's either dog or cat because I don't think it's directly mentioned but it looks like a dog.
---
Halloween 2 takes place the same night as the first one so he doesn't ACTUALLY need to eat anything until after the events.  Disappears for Halloween 3 and then I don't believe it's brought up if he eats again after that although he does have plenty of opportunities in H20 given how many chip bags are just laying around.
---
The newest Halloween reboot in 2018 that makes everything past 3 not cannon it is specified by the doctor in THAT one that he won't speak at all but maintains a healthy lifestyle of exercise, staring at walls and eating, stabbing forks into ripoffs of Jamie Lee Curtis, staring, practicing stalking on the mentally ill and hyper paranoid, etc.
---
He's a pure, raw embodiment of evil, of course he eats, he just doesn't care what I guess.  At least he cooks his food.
---
I never heal against spirit until I'm super far away/she's chasing someone else. They always seem to run nurses calling.
---
Same.  I went with a ‚Äúsurvivors like to have fun too‚Äù mentality and it‚Äôs much better.  
---
Corrupt intervention, Pop, Discordance and a perk that the killer comes with is my go to, Haunted grounds + devour hope works wonders on spirit though.

---
For items bring a Commodeous toolbox with swivel socket and wire spool.  If you dont have commodeous and wire spools then use  any repair toolbox and swap in streetwise as one of your choice perks.
---
Remember if Ruin is up dont use your toolbox until its broken as toolboxes increase skill check chances.
---
not a bad idea but for lf what I was thinking since he deals with hooks make it where he can build a hook on his current location but make it take 5 seconds to build it and he only has so many hooks he can build before he has to go destroy the hooks he placed in order to place new ones allow him 3 hooks he can build
---
Do you own her? Try playing her until you get 0k a few times and watch what good survivors do to you.
---
Or eats anything he wants since he is a dream monster.  Like yeah, it doesn't sustain him but I'm sure he's tried to turn a kid into a hamburger at some point in the films after putting someone into a NES.  He does technically eat a girl as a TV in Dream Warriors but IDK if that counts.
---
 I'm the only one with that problem
---
Is this a gender swapped spirit?
---
Its almost as if the game prioritizes who has better ping to the server.
---
The point of the servers is to curb people from lagswitching to balance the game in their favor, that alone is worth the cost of admission.
---
&gt;Ruin is a crutch for people who don‚Äôt know when to leave a chase
---
This acts like Ruin isn't good even if you are just spinning a circle doing nothing. Slowing Gen progress, PERIOD with no prereq makes the game so much easier.
---
Still insulting me huh. 
---
Maybe if you  were a bit smarter you'd know that its just making you look even more sad and pathetic
---
Since making my post I realised a few people have posted the same problem.
---
1. https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dhdbnw/working_as_intended/
---
2. https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dhh071/apparently_splinters_do_nothing_now/
---
I don‚Äôt know about killed, but like psychologically tortured maybe a more realistic thought. But with the archives, maybe some killers will be forced to relive their past, which is the entity‚Äôs form of punishment.
---
I'm the only one with that problem
---
Yah I‚Äôve seen both of them I recently used a glass splinter and I had no idea it was bugged
---
But Freddy's power isn't being stealthy like Wraith, Ghostface, or Myers. It's just a passive benefit of his bloated kit.
---
Yeah bro, and those interesting addons that change her playstyle? Absolutely useless who wants to be an m1 killer with the ability to teleport through walls every 3 seconds smh
---
Whispers has decreasing numbers too, so reversing the numbers on Discordance shouldn‚Äôt be too hard.
---
I dont mind Kate running around the killer for a while
---
I dont mind her opening the Gates, doing all totems its whatever
---
But if you use an exploit you found unintentionally to win, you are just a dick, nothing more
---
bro people in this game suck lol, don‚Äôt listen to them. unless ur face camping or hard tunneling, you don‚Äôt really have much to feel bad about as killer, even if salty survivors say otherwise.
---

You're getting so gaslighted right now it's not even funny.

I had a fun game with some friends the other night in which I ended up knocked and needing to crawl for a solid four-six minutes. I had just seen the crawl movie and thought it would be fun to parody it. Then I remember I suck at video editing and did about half of what I set out to accomplish. I sped up the crawling x3 in some parts so it wouldn‚Äôt be a long video.
---
Well the perk's sole purpose is to increase blood points, encouraging survivors to rescue and heal people would be nice since they are actively putting themselves at danger not sure how game changing the Haste Status effect is since I mostly player a engineer build on Dwight.
---
Bad bot :(
---
There are no rules to this game. Ignore what survivors tell you are the "rules", do your job, play to win. Take advice from survivors with a grain of salt (in some cases, a large spoonful of salt).
---
It gets broken within the first minute, it has nothing to do with leaving chase, it's so you can get atleast 1 hook in and start a snowball before 3-4 gens get popped
---
If it stays up for a large portion of the game, cool, but that may happen maybe 12% of games, if that.
---
It‚Äôs so difficult to be new in this game. My literal second time playing I got messages telling me to kill myself.  The learning curve is steep, and it‚Äôs not the new person‚Äôs fault that the matchmaking doesn‚Äôt seem to make any sense. Thanks for being reasonable
---
Uninstall and update graphics card
---
This is great! xD LOVE IT
---
Had this happen with a nurse the other day. She wasn‚Äôt happy when she finally downed all four of us and everyone collectively dc‚Äôed denying her bbq
---
The first thing i noticed was the head shape. She should have a pointed chin (unless your drawing a child or baby) or at lease a longer face. Other than that the shoulders are slightly to rounded. Try making a sketch of a character with only simple shapes like triangles, circles, a d squares.
---
I think that you should also be able to gain a stack for completing a generator.
---
Well good for you nonetheless! :)
---
Respect the 4%? Fuck that nonsense. Yeah good for them for jumping off but why do it while your still near? I play both sides and you did the right thing
---
chill
---
Dude, chill out.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main, too. The bug happened and we got excited, it was funny. You don‚Äôt have to play every game exactly the same way every time. Sometimes it‚Äôs just more fun to goof around. It‚Äôs not like I went out of my way to replicate the bug and exploit every match.
---
This is really cool
---
No, but there are 2 add ons that help with shred missed attack cooldowns. Unrelenting can be useful with killers like nurse or spirit when you first start playing as them until you can get the abilities down. Maybe wraith if you arent used to him coming out of stealth at first too.
---
So did the other 3, company demands the full uniform to be worn
---
I've had this happen too! Same map. With Nea I think. Only happened once. I don't remember any specific triggers.
---
It's another objective, I wish there was more.
---
Just make the killers text in chat anonymous ("Killer" as chat name) - problem solved.
---
That's me but not because I'm waiting to find a lobby, I'm working up the courage to actually play killer.
---
Killing in the 90's
---
I play anti healing Legion at rank 1, and oh no they're not touching ma gens even without RuinüòÇ
---
All those things make him a cool and unique killer.
---
Pros: 
---
* Survivors will face a wide variety of killers 
---
*Killers who want to play non-meta killers and rank up will be able to.
---
Cons: 
---
* Killers who main non-meta killers will be artificially ranked up and forced to play against better survivors.
---
It's a cool idea for sure.  If this is implmented they should include a reward for ranks.
---
It is just unfair for the killer you played against, you could be the better Man and give him his deserved kill but you didnt, so dont expect respect because you deserve none
---
Will do! üòâ
---
Sam Loomis after seeing the dog he said something along the lines of ‚Äúhe must have gotten hungry‚Äù
---
Tbh, ruin gets found so fast that half of the time it really doesn't slow down gens. All it does is make me feel less stressed at the beginning of the game, as I have insurance for like... 30 seconds max.
---
Not trying to be rude... but what were you expecting from playing one of the weakest killers at high ranks?
---
The devs said all characters are, for obvious reasons, 18+
---
well, you can always run perks to help. stuff like iron will is a godsend. you could also run an exhaustion perk like lithe, gain distance and turn a corner to lose line of sight, and then stop running to stop making scratch marks. it all just depends on the killer/map/etc.
---
So cute!!!
---
Hag and huntress and doctor and nurse are free
---
I thought it was a pretty crazy move as well, but you're right: why not chase them down and make them work for it, right?
---
I'm used to the other killers (bar nurse and hillbilly) but i just figured it's a decent attack with a relatively easy counter so it would work. Shame that it doesn't; this, i think, is one of the few killer perks that needs a rework to at least be viable.
---
I love this cartoon! I'm a nervous DBD player also. Other survivors can usually tell and they help guide me often.
---
The outplay wasn't the Mori, it was downing the adrenalined survivor, but even for that OP is clearly just joking.
---
Also in order to Mori you gotta down someone first so don't act like it takes no skill at all.
---
I get that but from my point of view I think they could've done better.
---
.... its an entity. entities dont have genders
---
Might be but I always associate trapper and dwight as the  "starter/beginner" killer and survivor so I always associate them together
---
Oh. Doesn't that make it pop constantly?
---
If pop figures were acctually gud
---
Worst how? Bad for killers, bad for survivors? Too weak, too strong?
---
In general i just hate indoor maps
---
Wait really? I thought you had less with the switch
---
Aawww that‚Äôs awesome. Wish I had folk like that with me, as opposed to having somebody come over to help me up, only to find them beginning to T-bag me while down. üòÜüò´üò≠
---
d
---
I've sort of realized he was one of the weakest killers, i just want to level him up to get bbq as a teachable
---
The council will decide your fate
---
His mori is throwing a trash can at your neck. As you writhe on the floor bleeding out he stands over you. "Ah shit, did I get ya Cricket?"
---
This right here is the reason why I hate Scary Movie.  The whole premise of it proves that the directors of it were too stupid to understand Scream in the first place.
---
What about when there's lag and killers get hits because of it? Sounds like an exploit to me and killers should let survivors go if that happens.
---
Point is things happen that are out of our control. In this case it was a once in a million glitch and it was funny so OP went with it. OP had a chance to escape with or without the glitch anyways, even if it was a smaller chance.
---
Asking the real questions here
---
I love the idea of making the perk easier to use, since a survivor will rarely get 4 safe unhooks during the course of a game, but I wanted to restrict it to altruistic actions to keep the perk's namesake still make sense.
---
As an Ash main, I have basically this whenever a Kate is hooked.
---
*Hey I‚Äôm just staying in character*
---
It can be pretty challenging to get away from a killer, given that a lot of game mechanics support the killer in a chase (scratch marks, every killer moving faster than survivors, etc.)
---
There are certain perks that will make it easier to get away from killers: "Adrenaline perks" like sprint burst, lithe, balanced land, etc. will all give you a temporary speed burst upon doing a certain action (though they will only work one at a time), Iron Will at level 3 makes it so you make no noise while injured, Quick and Quiet makes it so you perform rushed actions (like fast vaulting or quickly getting in a locker) silently, Urban Evasion lets you crouch walk as fast as you walk, etc.
---
Basically it just comes down to breaking line of sight and then doing something the killer won't expect. For example, over the weekend I stunned a killer with decisive strike, dropped a pallet behind me, and ran to a loop, then stopped and got in a locker next to an active gen. The killer arrived just as my scratch marks were fading away, the noise of the gen obscured my injured noises, and the killer wasted a lot of time searching the loop before leaving because he assumed I had snuck off someplace else.
---
Hope this helps!
---
You don‚Äôt, you let the killer get you and when you get hooked; you have to attempt to unhook yourself and when it tells you to press X/A or space bar, you just have to hold it
---
big daddy and andrew ryan for the survivor
---
While this looks like a hentai, an outfit with multiple swords would be awesome
---
Is it bad I bought no mither?
---
In my opinion, it makes altruism a competition. And the perk's name will still make sense as you're still technically helping your time.
---
Corrupt intervention is a crutch for people who don‚Äôt know how to patrol the entire map
---
Oh, I would just play another killer and use the BP to level him up.
---
I honestly couldn‚Äôt sit and play him and have fun so I just farmed bp on another killer and got his perks that way
---
In my mind, the haste status is strong enough to give the survivors a chance to either a.) speed off after an unhook or b.) allow the survivors to regroup with their allies after seeing the auras post-heal.
---
y
---
Instead I suggest to learn the game before deciding what you hate or not.. the same exact thing can be said for keys, both makes the game shorter and give a free win basically
---
yo Frank got RIPPED
---
Why is there confusion over this? In the legion bio, it clearly refers to Julie being a "popular high school girl" prior to meeting Frank - thus putting her high school aged, so 17 - maybe 18 max. Susie's her best friend, so that puts her in high school too. The whole reason Julie and Frank met was because she met him at one of her parties, no? 
---
\- A Legion main
---
I like the idea. I've always liked secondary powers like Pig's Ambush, Demogorgon's Shred, Freddy's Teleport / Pallets and Ghost Face's crouch.
---
The old killers just seem really outdated when it comes to their powers and could really benefit from a secondary power.
---
Dat booty tho.
---
You can give the last person the hatch or let them escape if you feel like it, some killers do, but it‚Äôs not a rule - you‚Äôre not obligated to let anyone escape and any survivors who complain about you killing them are being ridiculous.
---
Was lagswitching really that big of an issue that they had to put dedicated servers? I've never ran into a lag switcher and I've played for quite long
---
Trying to avoid tunneling or face camping is already kind! Kindness doesn't necessarily mean you have to give your kill away, just play in a way both parties can enjoy ^^
---
Shocked because Feng is easily one of the best additions.
---
Killers dont control lag, Kate sure controlled her movement the entire time so this was clearly intentional hence - exploiting 
---
Sure killers get lag hits but killers that use lag intentionally are not particulary popular are they?
---
I'm calling the police
---
That‚Äôs the funny thing, they give you those two though bubba and Freddy aren‚Äôt even available, you also get kate and Adam for free but Quentin isn‚Äôt available
---
I second this, looping is the most important part of the game and hiding can only take you so far. It also makes the game harder on your teammates because they will be chased more often leading to faster 3 hooks. My serious builds at red rank are lithe dance q&amp;q iron will/BT/DS or DS, BT, dead hard, adrenaline with a medkit.
---
That's a great point- there's nothing more frustrating than trying to stack up WGLF and someone else rescues the hook-ee instead of you.
---
You can get spirit for around 9k shards or whatever those things are called that you get at the end of every match.
---
I feel like an * needs to be added to the end of these posts 
---
* or until I get bored. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen the colorblind posts much this last week who used the same format.

You are under absolutely no obligation to respect the 4%. Take your kills and bask in the warm light of victory if you want to, you‚Äôre never obligated to grant them mercy
---
Yeah that‚Äôs reasonable but the devs won‚Äôt hear that haha

And how I phrased that really shows how very tired I am. The grind is real.

Pretty easy to avoid, you just make sure nothing ends up bright green or bright yellow to regular eyes - bright blue would be the logical option.

&gt;The best part about it is that matchmaking takes less than a minute and I can dc with almost no penalties if I don‚Äôt like who I‚Äôm playing against or get a bad start.

Cant wait to see people like you banned. Even just for 10-30m per disconnect would be so good

This is why we need at least, console cross-play.
---
EZ Daily
---
Totems give you 1000 blood points and for the killers it's a way to screw over survivors thanks to the introduction of Hex Perks.
---
Corrupt intervention is better on killers who require set up time like hag and trapper
---
not if you put a trap in front of it
---
Unless you're spirit or nurse, it's useless to play without ruin.

---
It really really really isnt, lagswitching is rare, its not worth dragging down the rest of us.
---
you played yourself by being in high ranks and then playing him. Should of did it like me and went from 17-9 to unlock bbq and did pretty good lmao.
---
I feel like this could be true. Ruin is a perk that applies pressure even when you aren't doing it. Since you are used to using ruin you might have come to be using less pressure because you haven't needed to apply as much pressure as someone who doesn't use ruin. I suggest don't use ruin for a while ( like a couple of weeks or something ) and then use it again you might find yourself using the pressure of a normal game combined with the pressure of ruin to an extending effect. 
---
Granted this is mainly just speculation and might not apply to you, I'm just trying to be helpful and pose a solution to a potential problem.
---
Changing prayer beads is what I can agree with. The Prayer Beads need to have a quieter phasing sound (not completely silent) but I would say vanilla Spirit is fine as she is. Killers are *supposed* to be strong. It's a 4v1 after all. I'm more in favor of buffing the weaker killers instead of nerfing the stronger ones.
---
I'm SO sorry that happened to you, unfortunately some people take games too seriously. I hope it hasn't put you off from playing the game :(
---
problem with this is that your bloodpoint gain is slow becuase of lack of chili
---
My problem with WGLF is that not everyone can get 4 stacks with just saves so you literally have to take hits in order for everyone to get 4 stacks while a killer just has to hook each survivor once. Why do we have to put ourselves in danger, plus do totems, plus save teammates, plus do all gens? It‚Äôs just really reliable or worth it in red ranks if you want to escape because you‚Äôre literally giving a killer a free hit.
---
This is so cute!
---
I had some tools say "EZ" to me after a 20 minute game where I hooked all of them.  I've pretty much stopped looking at the after game chat
---
So in a game where survivors already have the advantage killers get fucked even more, the game wasnt designed for the killer to have more than 0 ping
---
Kate didn't activate the speed boost herself. It just happened.
---
I don't blame killers for taking hits that result from UNINTENTIONAL lag. Its when they lag switch that its annoying.
---
Ha gottem.
---
OoO is just bad in general but this subreddit is survivor sided and nobody wants to acknowledge it
---
That would work out just don't let them see you doing it.
---
I did the same thing, I love that skin
---
I think in that scenario of ruin getting popped in the first minute is all you need. If it is in a decent spot, having 2 survivors not doing gens and the gens being slowed goes a long way. It lets you get that first down, allowing you to put on early game pressure without sacrificing 2 maybe even 3 gens in the first 80 seconds.
---
It happens, sometimes you get a killer you can fight against and sometimes you get someone that will slug everyone with maybe a new build he‚Äôs trying, as a survivor and killer I see both points of views and I really don‚Äôt get mad when I can‚Äôt do anything about a match, that‚Äôs the game and sometimes you won‚Äôt win, no point complaining about it
---
Lamo you ok?
---
Spirit, Nurse OR Billy.  Don't underestimate those sweet, sweet Billy surfs.
---
It sure did feel good!
---
Totems having skill checks would only make it faster because great skill checks give that extra boost and good ones are so easy to hit
---
I don't understand why matchmaking isn't based on player level instead of rank. Isn't that a better indicator of skill?
---
I assume you mean a complete altruistic action cause if you dont then sounds like heal and stop healing 4 times and max stacks lmao
---
Event*....
---
Yeah because we all loved it when no Ed wasn‚Äôt a totem.
---
Gaslighting is making someone question their sanity. This guy is just getting trolled.
---
Yeah, feels bad. Hard choice.
---
Get rekt with good BP
---
or
---
Win with mediocre BP.
---
That's the line!
---
I‚Äôd love an Exhaustion one just because most Survivors who stay Broken know they can Dead Hard to the nearest loop if you manage to sneak up on them.
---
Why do you care about killing people you‚Äôre meant to kill
---
But also on the reverse side, totems are the only thing that doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsave‚Äù your progress, so being slapped off of it at 99 is extremely frustrating and makes it easy for killers to camp totems(example is devour hope when you are all exposed camping it gets easy kills) 
---
So I feel like that‚Äôs a trade off, no skill checks for not saving progress, if they add skill checks they need to keep the progress worked on the totem.
---
Has anyone suggested if you are able to Kobe off the hook if the killer is within a certain range it stuns him? Obviously you can just stand outside the radius of the kick but then atleast a survivor can bait the killer to get closer. I dunno.
---
Heh, I try, though I'll be the first to acknowledge I have a soft spot for the Doctor and he's kind of anti-fun for survivors.
---
dat booty tho
---
and the survivor is a better player because...?
---
But she did controll her movement just like the killers can play with laggy or bad connection and win - its just an exploit she used to win 
---
I wouldnt mind at all if she came to the killer to give him his kill, but she did not and that makes her someone who abused an exploit
---
i returned to the game at the double BP event and bought leatherface and just grinded bbq from rank 17 till i got it teachable so i didnt have a problem, he just messed up by going for it in red ranks
---
Make them the same size as snapping out of it with unnerving and dont give a great zone
---
-Blizzard, probably.
---
I get it
---
True. Usually Trapper is the "starter" killer (at least he was for me). But I think Jake was with Trapper because it makes sense since he has saboteur and you can sabo his traps.
---
I've always let people go out the exit if they make it, because they've earned it. Even if they teabag me. 
---
I guess in this scenario I saw 4K and went for it and, you're right, they just mad. Maybe the fact they were downed by a noob was extra salt in the wound? üòâ
---
lul try prestige 3. On steve, I did not get WGLF (my favorite perk) until I got every perk in the game (all teachables as well) and had 4 pages of perks at level 3. Same thing with my prestige 3 Billy, I had to get all perks and leveled them up to max level before I got BBQ DEAD LAST. Spents millions and millions of bloodpoints and hundreds of hours grinding just to get the single perks that I wanted.
---
Not BP but a temp ban yes. Like in every other online game
---
5-20-30-45 minute ban that increase for every DC. It's like losing BP if you can't actually play, something that they should've implemented ages ago
---
Every game does that, if you dc because your internet dropped, 5min it's fine since you'll spend that time fixing the issue in the first place. If you constantly disconnect, then it's your fault. You cannot play the game period
---
I bring this up because people think to be entitled to play even if their connection sucks. Flash news, you're not. When I had those kind of issues, I just played offline games, something some brat should learn
---
I honestly hate exhaustion add-ons as a survivor so no matter how much I like them as killer I couldn't in good consciousness use them :/
---
I was using it in more of a colloquial way, cause he's getting so defensive about his own post. But good point.
---
Stop spamming end game screens, no one actually cares. If you 2pip against rank 1 renowned players with  insta heals with a no perk wraith then we might care

You can't moonwalk as a survivor. It's a mindgame tactic used by killers by keeping the red stain on one corner to make you think the killer comes around that corner when in reality you're coming around the other corner.
---
I've been grinding tapper to lvl 50.  Most of the time it spawns in a corner, so i put a trap on it.  Works pretty good, I just have to pay attention to the trap being demo'd etc.
---
Fair point.
---
BBQ is good for everyone the others you have are kind of meh but not useless
---
Try not to focus so much on the killer themselves, try to keep your attention on where you‚Äôre going next. Take note of nearby pallets, windows, vaults, etc. If you‚Äôre running from the killer without any plan of where you‚Äôre going then you‚Äôll die pretty quickly. There are plenty of perks that can give you useful information during a chase. Alert and Windows of Opportunity are very helpful perks for newer players who don‚Äôt know the structures of the maps yet.
---
‚Äú laughs in doctor ‚Äú
---
Ha, it reminded me of the thumb up the butt thing from South Park.
---
Did we know what power demo would have? No, but look, he's in the game!
---
I would say the killer deserved the kills and got cucked, but jugding by the way he gunned for the *S C O O P* he probably didn't deserve it.
---
Boil Over was the true carry here.
---
There's no kink shaming in brotherhood.

Bruh calm down the flair says shit post for a reason bud

oh god no
---
Yeah bbq looks good cause I can get across the map quick after a hook at least

If you learn how to use Play with Your Food on him its a completly different thing, he is mid tier id you use him right
---
they can.... but will they ? not sure...
---
Sounds heavily John William's influenced. Really dig it.
---
Omg that would be hilarious!
---
If they were to let people communicate to the killer in lobby they wouldn‚Äôt make them learn morsecode, they would allow the killer to talk in the chat
---
oof, the drama in this thread for such a simple, funny little video.  I play both killer and survivor pretty evenly and if i was the killer and this happened i would probably just be like.... what?.. and then laugh it off, I killed the other three.  This one glitched out.  If was were the survivor i would be the same.... i would be confused and then laugh it off and just escape.. now if he sat there and messed with the killer to try to induce some rage then it would be annoying.... but its all good other than that.   People shouldn't take this stuff so seriously.   The game is more fun, if you have fun with it.
---
The trap is as much an alarm as a weapon.
---
&gt; but this subreddit is survivor sided and nobody wants to acknowledge it

Whenever I see someone complain about OoO being bullshit, sometimes even saying they dc, it's always upvoted.
---
I just wanna input my build as a p3 Myers main with all perks, I love Ruin (need this or corrupt on Myers because of tier 1)
---
Thrilling Tremors (can be replaced with BBQ if u need the points but it's a better version of Bbq Imo) 
---
Pop helps for some early game but best in late game. 
---
Surge it's great to keep the pressure up and works with his Insta down. 
---
I do very very good with this build. 
---
Could also use bamboozle or brutal strength instead of surge as Myers main weakness is looping (brutal over enduring as u want to stalk behind pallets 
---
Let me know if anyone sees this build and tries it.
---
Since when did I spam this is the first time I posted just my end screen the other was a meme I made, Jesus man your not having a good day
---
Why arent they available?
---
Yeah.
---
I wish gen speed was slower so I didn‚Äôt have to run ruin on every build
---
I really like jake and have since the start I‚Äôm not entirely sure why. Then I went to claudette and I like her for how short she is.
---
You could... but why? Ruin doesn‚Äôt really need a buff at this point. Also, new players will stay away from any type of totem if they have to hit skill checks like that. Totems cleansing is fine as is, but totem spawn are pretty iffy. You either get an amazing ruin spawn or a terrible one. Too much rng
---
If I could chime in and add that the Haste and Aura Reading bonus should be applied to both the rescuer and the hooked survivor.

‚ÄúIf you know what Oversaturated means‚Äù

---
That was actually my idea: I didn't realize I forgot to mention it in the post!
---
Sounds kinda abusable tho, like DC is but without losing BP. 
---
Idk about it.. doesn't sound good, especially if the killer did a slug set up, for example, so he can chase the third survivor. They reach halfway before he come back to hook and they just kill themselves and deny the killer emblem points just for using a strategy
---
I just said "ok" and they flew into a fucking blood rage
---
I like to play as Kate because she's feisty in her lore, David because he's hot, Meg because she looks like Zoey and Claire Redfield, Laurie because I feel like shes never afraid and will bitch slap any of the other dlc characters, and Feng because I keep hearing this internal dialogue similar to the quiet Asian girl from the Pitch Perfect movies
---
Im going to let you know this now dont waste your time playing with or upgrading jake you will never use his perks or him anyways. Best people to play for beginners is meg or nea.
---
I dont know if you play pc or console but there is this move that pc players do where they spin circles around the killer so they wont be hit but in my opinion it works better on console because killers usually dont have high senses and they dont expect it. If you are on pc still do the move, id also recommended you watch some YouTubers play like monto and noob3

Try utilizing Play With Your Food on him, it negates the slow movement speed he suffers when charging the chainsaw, making it waaaay easier to land chainsaw hits before they can make it to a pallet or vault. Also having 2 or 3 stacks of PWYF basically gives him the equivalent of The Beast Marks add-on.

Just bought the hag and was testing her out a bit.Decided to use Ruin to see what was all the fuss about it,pretty decent ngl.But then as soon as it was gone......3 minutes was all it took for things to go sideways on every match.
---
Hero. And what I hate is if you want to run another hex, it‚Äôs more likely going to die *because* they‚Äôre looking for the ruin. Id love to run Devout but nope.
---
All of the above. I have a sneaky delivery boy slacker Dwight, a calm spirited healer Adam, a leader Meg, etc. I love creating characters out of the cosmetic and perk tools. I do the same with my killers
---
What hunters does the switch have
---
Dwight is the obvious choice here
---
If like to see you try and win a game with hex ruin on
---
The sexiest of them all
---
There is nothing more triggering to me than when a survivor says ex after you murdered like 3 other people. Oh but it's funny when they say ez and you got a 4k lol, like shit if im easy you must be some type of walk in the park if that's the case
---
As a survivor, when I'm playing against no ruin, I try to only do 2 gens at the most because I know a gen rush is gonna happen.
---
You know it sounds a bit out of place for a killer chase theme, but that‚Äôs what makes it sound so perfect for a killer like the Clown. Luring people in with a cheery premise, only for it to be their demise. I love it. If they do add unique themes I hope his ends up something like this.
---
\#OVERSATURATED CONTENT

Couldn't they implement a system that knows if you press leave match instead of you're internet being so shit it disconnects you
---
I believe it should be

See killers aura on unhook, provides the ability to take a hit that would be putting yourself into the downed state, while unhooking and 3 seconds after. Gain token for safe unhooks and prot hits. Each token gives a 25% bp bonus up to 50/75/100% bonus bp.
---
If this was her music I would play her all the time.
---
Huntress‚Äô and especially Clowns‚Äô are downright frustrating as they‚Äôre very easy to apply and very frequent in Bloodwebs. The Pig works for hers and the Doctors is a Very Rare add-on and requires Tier 3 madness.

---
Unpopular opinion (maybe?) but I like playing against doctors, I don't see them often so it's kind of refreshing to see them, you do you!
---
And ruin only slows gens down some. A survivor who can hit the checks is only slowed a bit.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs very good for high mobility killers
---
Oooo you‚Äôre hard lad.
---
With that amount of effort it‚Äôs be easier to just balance the current game mode and then spend any additional areas on another game mode. 
---
Instead of splitting the player base between a ranked and casual mode where people are gonna be sweaty and BM in both modes, fixing the ranked system we have now is just better. Not to shut down on your idea, I would actually love an ‚ÄúOpen Practice‚Äù similar to KYF but you can just load in with randoms. You can test perks and generators can be worked on/completed/done for skill check practice but the gates are always open and you can unhook yourself over and over and the killer can do whatever too.
---
I usually run Discordance (it's in the shrine until tomorrow), BBQ, Nurse's Calling and ruin. Sometimes I switch out Discordance with Thrill of the Hunt or Haunted Ground
---
He shouldn‚Äôt just be able to lunge insanely far and fast like that without any drawbacks. He‚Äôs fine the way he is.

Hunters?

Ruh roh raggy

To add, stacks are called "tokens" in perk descriptions. They mean the same thing.

I meant killers

Would be interesting if it gained another token every time a survivor died. Or maybe when you are hooked.
---
I carried him to the gen and kept smacking it and they got the hint
---
I love playing Bill,  mainly because of the lore, I used to be a HUGE left for dead player and seeing him in the Dead by Daylight universe and playing him is so freaking cool, and his perks are great too!!
---
Xenomorph would be amazing, if they can make the demogorgon a playable killer they can do the xenomorph. The xenomorph was literally a fighter in Mortal Kombat X so...
---
Because they fcked u over good enough for at least some 2 escape
---
I bet you wear jeans and a tshirt and that's your entire style with no fashion
---
To be a speed-STAR
---
Sloppy,Bamboozle, Iron Grasp and BBQ sounds like a good build for what you‚Äôve got. Try to get perks like Discordance, Ruin or Thrilling Tremors. You‚Äôre currently lacking any real generator protection so you‚Äôre at risk of losing many gens in quick succession.
---
Hag if you like to play territorial/chess like
---
Plague if you like to make slug fest and set up changing Target with your ability
---
Legion.. ... I mean.. Susie is cute
---
Doctor, it's nice to play but won't do much. Is basically an m1 killer that have fun making people scream
---
Spireh, is strong and fun to play, you can make fun builds like huge terror radius so they won't hear your phasing. Try to do mind games and counter rotate
---
Clown, it's nice, kinda like huntress you need a good aim to cut survivors path, so you can hit them
---
But idk. The most fun dlc for me is Halloween with Myers. He's very fun but it's under license
---
I dont get it
---
It was a toss-up between Hindered or Exhausted and I think Hindered might be less of a pain in the ass?
---
But Oblivious I think is fine because you can get rid of it, it's totally within your power to do so and it doesn't help her in a chase.
---
Just imagine as a survivor going against a killer running Ruin and Devour Hope. From a survivor side they are really good because you can interact with the killers perks. From the killer side they are good as long as they stay up. I think they are balanced for the most part. Except the lit ones shouldnt spawn in the open or by killer shack or gens
---
I think breaking chase would fit better but that might be too much. Maybe being in terror radius like Pebble/Stake Out?
---
yOu dIdNt LeT tHe KiLlER gEt His VirTual InTernet PoiNts - you are literally hitler

Why am I laughing so hard at this for 5 mins at least
---
Get clapped
---
You‚Äôre not getting the point. It‚Äôs just ONE game that this has happened in and I didn‚Äôt immediately ‚Äúrespect‚Äù. 
---
Ultimately, I play video games to have fun and spend time with my friends. I‚Äôm not just going to play robotically and ruin the moment. I was having a blast and laughing, I didn‚Äôt even think about playing it like I do solo. 
---
You‚Äôre getting upset over a very small thing. Get some fresh air, friend.
---
Problem is Plague's would be kinda easy to apply as well since they just have to break and in a game against Plague you will definitely be broken a lot
---
It‚Äôs really just frustrating when someone that doesn‚Äôt like to post continues to comment on it. Yeah I overreacted but it doesn‚Äôt change my
---
thought process. And I‚Äôm not trying to convince people it is a good idea it‚Äôs just a discussion thread. That‚Äôs it.
---
This could be good, but the armor would have to be much smaller to make it work, unfortunately.
---
HEY GAMERS, Feng Min here to explain the joke. So apparently some killers still don't know how to follow the survivor rule book and OP is pointing that out. Remember as a survivor in post-game chat it's your job to remind the killer they did something wrong, everytime. STAY GAMING
---
Welp, to get every perk right now you have to spend 180 levels. So depends on your pool, if you unlocked every teachable or not and a bit of luck
---
Well I play on console and I dont even care about ruin anymore as a survivor. Rather its ruin activated or not my teammates almost never do gens and we die by the time we get to like 2 gens or 1 gen left. 
---
Urban evasioners, locker dwellers, treasure hunters, and or teammates that just go down one after the other and you spend your time unhooking all match. And this is with or without hex ruin. Its bloody ridiculous.
---
Really is that role coming back, thought we'd all decided that the 4% was bull and no matter what you're going back on the hook. 
---
I mean they did just fall off and we don't want them to get all dirty on the floor.
---
I was a Laurie main because of her lore, the OG final girl. I now use also use Nancy because she is a bad momma.
---
i have sometimes gotten good info for example if hook rescue is safe and can i just heal on the spot
---
He has to have a perk that lets him climb objects and break the game with parkour then.
---
Using OoO by yourself  fine, one person using it on a party? Thats the most toxic and broken thing
---
I was trying to find Claudette in this picture for some reason. XD
---
Why not play both? I do.
---
BHVR has said in their discord that they will treat any DC the same RQ or not if you DC you DCd you get punished
---
Id suggest u throw in another perk non related to gen rushing like sprint burst or adrenaline because you want to be able to gen rush but you also want to escape
---
He doesnt hit when he should and he hits when he shouldnt. And his shred doesnt work on most pallets, that change wouldnt make it better than nurse anyway
---
yeah just wonderin if i could be better at the game without it
---
You explained it perfectly.
---
So considerate! üòÜ
---
Upvoted cause ya need it
---
I wouldn't go as far as to say that now, imagine if all the generators had no skill checks.
---
In this example any new or experienced player will never have to worry about alerting the killer since how would you ever achieve a fail state, generators be popping left and right, killer is given no clue if somebody is working on a generator only when they complete it or have a perk telling them so.
---
I think there is only one perk that lets you know if a totem is in the process of being cleansed and if that gets destroyed you'll just be left in the dark wondering if your other hex totem is safe or not.
---
It also takes its time when it misses.
---
*"Vote DWIGHT! s-student body president, p-please!"*
---
Yeah that's what I thought initially, but a big sister would work since she has a more balanced and plausable hitbox
---
I had similar bug as nurse. Fatigue would make me slow as fuck, like burger king slow. Then all of a sudden I‚Äôd be zoomin. Same map.
---
If you think its ok to do it once, you are capable of doing it again
---
Have fun all you want, just not on someone's else expense
---
I think the issue is too many people rely on ruin as their end all be all perk, when they should honestly only expect ruin to be there for 1 - 5 minutes.
---
During those 1 - 5 minutes, the killer should be applying pressure in other ways, like setting traps or hunting down survivors.
---
After ruin is gone, you have to switch from prep mode to Gen check mode. Even if you smack somebody once, hit the Gen, then go find somebody else to smack, it's still delaying their game for that amount of time.
---
big daddy would essentially be billy 2.0 because if I recall they do a dashing drill attack lol
---
Face camping will always be a thing and it‚Äôs a terrible idea against good survivors. 
---
The killer will always loose if the survivors actually do gens instead of crouching behind a bush and slowly watching you die on the hook with the killer around. The sooner people realize this, the better.
---
So your saying he should be able to chase with his mouth constantly open to not allow any counterplay? next youll suggest hatchets shouldnt slow huntress lmao
---
&gt; But Oblivious I think is fine because you can get rid of it, it's totally within your power to do so and it doesn't help her in a chase.
---
I dunno because you would have no clue if she was coming as you were trying to cleanse to get rid of it
---
I got it but never played it, now I want to know how to just escape and not die every round
---
idk why distortion doesn‚Äôt have more tokens and only adds time the killer can‚Äôt see ur scratch marks. like, if ur close enough for scratch marks to matter, distortion is basically useless.
---
Can we just take Ruin out of the game entirely, then balance repair speeds, items, etc... to compensate? Its a boring perk that's not interesting or fun for anyone. Taking it as a necessity to be competitive just removes a better perk that could lead to more interesting strategies or outcomes.
---
Yeah but there are multiple versions of big daddies, so the drill dash isn't mandatory. It could be a middle ground between demogorgan and billy if anything
---
Quentin, because I love Nightmare on Elm Street and his perks are really good and don't try to argue with me about his perks not being good or the original Nightmare on Elm Street being better than the one with Quentin because you're wrong and I don't care.
---
How's that for a runon sentence, ENGLISH?
---
I just started to play last night and I have less than 5 hours of time played, but having a lot of fun (was so scared to jump in, now I‚Äôm addicted) ..However, I pop my gens a lot and I‚Äôm struggling with looping...are there any tips/tricks to improve or is it just something I improve with over time?
---
God where were all these survivor mains whining when spirit first came out? Spirit hasn't been changed in any drastic way.
---
We need more good people like this
---
He didn't even openly say he didn't like it. Only that it was weird. I mean let's be real going from talking or text to Morse code in 2019 gaming is weird alone
---
Maybe even Demo, but he doesn't need it as much as those two, especially Trapper.
---
In one movie he eats a kids soul trapped in a meatball, as a pizza topping. Proclaims he loves 'soul food'. They don't offer that at Dominos. 
---
I guess technically he is sustained by souls? When he loses them he gets all weak. But in some movies its just public fear of him so who knows. Anoes canon is fuckd't.
---
Jeff because his lore his looks and his perks aren‚Äôt bad
---
3 tokens is fine the perk isn't horrible but isn't amazing if you know they have bbq hide in locker to not lose any more stacks but the 1st stack u lose.
---
ds is a lifesaver.
---
Yeah, I just know he removes / heavily limits survivor ability to hide. Removes the stealth element of gameplay somewhat. You got to bring your running A-game when the Doctor is in play.
---
Sorts out the jack of all trades survivors who can adapt from the inflexible ones. Shocks you out of your comfort zone. Some people don't like that. XD
---
Only new players have to worry about alerting killer on generator skill checks. Generator skill checks without ruin are extremely easy once you‚Äôve played for a decent amount of time and only make the generator go faster if you can hit great ones
---
I think both of those would be way too easy.  Killers dont really see your aura often unless they are using an incompetent build.
---
i love this so much reminds me of the time someone made a petition for having mike wazowski in dbd as a killer
---
Ah yes the old "so youre saying move" no thats exactly not what im saying. Im saying that it shouldnt take that much time opening its mouth. By the time it opened that damn mouth the survivor already went over another side.
---
Why the fuck should they slow down huntress? She THROWS Hatchets man
---
sounds interesting, do you have any perk ideas?
---
Claudette and Jake, I just think they're neat. Also Vigo's maurauder looks kick ass!
---
Ok, how do i get it im absolutely clueless i just use the base killer's perks
---
It does makes sense,but currently I'm just trying to play the hag to unlock its teachables.And thank god that my ruin doesn't go down that fast,sometimes it last for quite a while and most of the time they are all hidden pretty well(mobile btw so maybe things are much different on pc since my laptop can't handle it).
---
You're likely right. It's just with a game's meta designed around efficient use of time, it's hard to find a way for casual players to have an option for a less stressful game.
---
Traps are partially for stopping loops, and partially for intel.
---
This whole post went to shit tbh. I just wanted to tell you all a cool idea I had and thought people would like it.
---
For pig it should just be "human."
---
I was worried revealing the Killer's aura might step on other perks, like Babysitter.
---
Thank you for being that player, I‚Äôm brand new myself (baby rank 20oof)  and lived for the first time thanks to a Kate who was the same. &lt;3 You make the experience for us that much better!
---
Watch videos/streams and plan ahead when you're doing a gen, but yea. You'll just get better with practice and map familiarity.
---
thank you feng min from the hit game dead by daylight for the pc, ps4, xbox one and switch platforms
---
Honestly, I just love Ash, for well, being Ash and his character, I loved his character in the movies and loved the TV show, he‚Äôs also one of the only characters that I know that actually says voice lines in the lobby e.g. ‚ÄúLook who‚Äôs shitting in the tall grass.‚Äù
---
I also love Water Trash Ash, Jacksonville loves him and he loves Jacksonville to B-) I also like Bill as well since he‚Äôs from Left 4 Dead.
---
No self respecting killer gives a fuck about survivor's "fun"
---
K
---
Awwwww cutie
---
ds is a Laurie teachable. I‚Äôd only advice using base perks if ur a masochist.
---
There are a lot better perks for spirit
---
If they're using the down time to improve the game it's good but I don't think dbd needs a total rework so I don't see the point.
---
David cause shirtless
---
Get Laurie, aka Halloween dlc
---
Its one of her perks
---
Your kinda annoying (different person btw just wanna say that)
---
Yeah I just played my first match got rushed like hell I did get a 4k tho I somehow managed idk but my aim is so bad with this killer and I don't know why
---
Yeah or even have heals (not self-heals) count towards it. But I'm down for the generator change too because they barely give points as is without Prove Thyself.
---
With your additional effect it wouldn't even be game breaking. The Haste would come in after the safe unhook so maybe if the killer is chasing you and it kicks in, you might get to a vault faster but that's it.
---
And the aura effect is nice but if you have Bond or any other aura perk it would be negligible anyway. 
---
I need this change.
---
Everybody seem to ignore or not to address the real problem: even if BT does process, Freddy can just hit again the rescued survivor, activating Borrowed Time and then chase him until he goes down - because he‚Äôs in the nightmare again and the deep wound bar will go down since there is no heartbeat. This is as bad as the old days Legion exploit.
---
I just respond with ‚Äúgg! Well played all‚Äù and leave it at that. If they keep insulting you just go along with it. I‚Äôve noticed most people lighten up and will joke around with you after that.
---
Oh it's you again. Hello!
---
Run spinechill and respect it. If its solid for 1 second, walk away. 
---
Its all u need.  Then ds.
---
Wait when you get to level 50 are you still able to find perks in them? Like say you get dwight to level 50 and meg to level 50, could you still find prove Thu self in megs bloodweb even though your already level 50?
---
The fuck adept Feng is easy
---
Billy is widely considered top tier. The real underestimated one is Hag. A good Hag WILL demolish survivors.
---
You on drugs xD
---
Nurses is one of my favourite perks ill have to dig through the Web for that one
---
I haven't played on mobile, but I do play Hag a lot.
---
Seriously, look up some people playing Hag or a Hag tutorial. I suckeddddd at her at first, because I was ass trying to place traps.
---
The biggest piece of advice was to do the 3 Gen strat with her fight at the start. So pick 3 gens that are close to each other, within teleport distance, and trap all of the main points (1 by each Gen, 1 by totems, some around pallets, etc).
---
If you haven't found a survivor while setting up, then go across the map and chase them towards the web you made.
---
The thing you can improve and apply immediately to how you loop certain tiles/jungle gyms/l-t walls and so on is by looking on this sub for a post from a guy who made a depiction of what is the most optimal route for a loop for both survivors and killers. Other than that you should on YouTube some high level players and see how they move (TrueTalent, notOtzdarva, Monto, ecc). The rest is up to how much time you put into looping and how much you are willing to improve. Have fun bruh, hope this was helpful
---
They meant it was ez for you. /s
---
Jeez your dense
---
... as skins! ($10 each)
---
That is true no progress is saved when you get slapped and it feels so bad when your on the receiving endüòÜ
---
This happened to me yesterday. I was playing as Claudette, and I dropped a pallet on the killer and then ran in the opposite direction. The speed boost stayed with me the rest of the match.
---
I'd that kahoot music?
---
Ha
---
Love that feeling
---
yes you are able to find perks in ur bloodweb as long as u have them unlocked. if ur meg is level 50, and u level up Dwight and get his teachables, you wil have a chance to find his perks in megs bloodweb now. same goes for killers.
---
Dude are you 12. You‚Äôre getting upset over nothing
---
get out of yellow ranks
---
yup
---
I like it
---
Totally agree with this, but it should be one or the other, you get the points or you get the pip, not both since the killer still has to work for that safety pip as well.
---
Yes, your character level caps at 50 but you‚Äôre still able to buy from the bloodweb. You can prestige and start over but that takes away any perks (besides base perks) offerings and items you have left over.
---
She is perfect where she is lol

Imagine not being a piece of shit

*This post was made by the Destiny 2 Wizard gang*

22nd, the Halloween Event starts at the same time too, I can‚Äôt wait.
---
"I killed a man. With THIS THUMB"
---
Honestly, people joke about it, but applying pressure to survivors is something so few killers know how to do. So often I'll see killers just immediately pick up downed survivors when it would be so much better for them not to, because they feel the need to get someone on a hook.
---
It's the toolboxes that make a genrush, though. If toolboxes followed the rules and only did ONE thing like every other item (except for keys + addons), they'd just break hooks and genspeed would drop on average.
---
Same I‚Äôm really excited for the archive with more lore.
---
You gotta rank up and get around 10 for good games honestly.  Low ranks is gonna have tunneling/camping killers, and incompetent survivors. 
---
High ranks is going to have ultimate sweat that I don't enjoy.
---
Especially if you use Overcharge and Freddy, it‚Äôs worked wonders for me pulling survivors off gens and delaying the game in ranks 10-5.
---
I notice survivors (maybe because they‚Äôre less experienced?) spend time on my totems anyways thinking I‚Äôm running Hex, but I‚Äôm not.
---
Piece of shit stress simulator of a game really
---
.... you do realize she is slowed while aiming the hatchets right?
---
I could live without the bloodpoints. I just don‚Äôt like depipping just because my teammates are too cowardly to actually try. It wasn‚Äôt even against a necessarily good killer either. It was against a Wraith who was easily looped
---
This is constantly happening to me on PC, too. Every day I get a killer daily, I nerf it, and if it becomes a killer daily, it never changes. But if it becomes a survivor daily, it changes to a killer daily during my next game
---
Jane because she has a huge ass.
---
Don't jump on a generator in the first moments of the game, scout while looking for ruin and scoping loops/pallets. Or tap start generators as you move through an area.
---
I may be wrong, but can‚Äôt you be punished for DC‚Äôing if there is video evidence of you doing it? If so, then why is there even a ‚Äúleave game‚Äù option?
---
Ooh I‚Äôll have to go find that! I‚Äôll try to find some people to follow and watch, see if I can‚Äôt pick up a few tricks. Thank you!
---
sprint burst is exhaustion perk they only can use it once and most fuck up with it urban they not gonna crouch forever plus headphones make shit way easier
---
They will lose as in their rank will go down and your rank will go up (if not face camped) and you probably won‚Äôt have to fight them again afterwards.
---
Scoops Ahoy Steve &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy 
---
Upcoming Babysitter Steve &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Everyone (but Jane)
---
That's why you run it without ruin. I was running devour on my demogorgon without ruin at red ranks last week and only lost once iirc
---
How is her Christmas sweater cursed? I wear it a lot
---
I do if they‚Äôre like rank 18 or 19 randoms, but higher rank SWF can get fucked
---
I like to play Ace with his navy shirt with the rolled sleeves and Sharp Ace head for the dad factor.  Other than that I also do play Jane for obvious reasons.
---
So you‚Äôre saying interacting with the killer is toxic? He is just using the gestures to taunt him to come chase him. Not everything can be toxic. 
---
Toxic: sand bagging, tbagging and pointing at exit gate, farming, working with killer. 
---
Other than that, all other strats are used to get killer‚Äôs attention to be chased and stuff.
---
A very small price I think we would all be willing to pay
---
:O I like this idea! I don't really have anything to add, but still!
---
You're comparing apples to oranges. Re-read my other post because it explains everything clearly. If you still dont get it then idk what to say. FYI, I play both survivor and killer. I play billy, trapper, wraith, spirit at rank 1 level. I'm not some biased player picking one side over the other.
---
I think since march 2018
---
&gt; Urban evasioners
---
Do people not like UE? Whats wrong with?
---
I absolutely abhor playing with randoms at this point. Every single time, regardless of rank, they either unhook DIRECTLY in front of the killer or lead the killer straight to you to save themselves :/
---
you literally are though. You asked for a drawback free lunge attack. The only drawback in this is missing, and how are u going to miss when you can just hold m2 and catch up to them for the free hit with no slowdown.
---
We get teabagged, stabbed, flashed, looped, hit by pallets, and more.
---
If you need Ruin to win then you are a shit killer.
---
Killers mains be crying toxic
---
You know, why would toxic survs wish every killer they meet to uninstall, if all killers uninstalled you'd never get to play survivor
---
Ok
---
When dedicated server comes. But if you dc by pulling the plug or because you have bad internet, it's the same thing so I would punish both the same way
---
If your internet is shit 5min ban won't even affect you, if you can't actually play because constantly DC you, then don't play. It's not fair for whoever play with you and is just frustrating to get dced all the time
---
So, play offline game if it's not something you can fix right away
---
You can use print burst multiple times... And I meant balanced landing lol. My b
---
I haven't put much thought into perk ideas yet, if this post gets any traction then I'll cook something up
---
It hasn‚Äôt, luckily! I love this game, and I‚Äôm happy I was able to get back on the horse despite some people‚Äôs negativity.
---
This is my kind of fusion
---
No, mainly from the fact when the gates are powered whatever you got on the hook to just get that 1 fucking kill do whatever you have too there should not be a system that gives survivors another reward for something basic that just makes killers waste their time. You will know when you have been in that one game where you just feel so powerless you have no fucking choice
---
Completionists don't go by purchase only metrics though, they go by ingame time, so it would be about shards.
---
He's taunting the killer. That's toxic.
---
Just bc it's legal doesn't make it right to be attracted to minors lol
---
I‚Äôve once been doing a full totem when the last gen popped and it because Noed. Almost a feels bad
---
Lookin like a SNACC
---
Literally no one wants to do this.
---
Ok now tell me where i said "drawback" i think i said "It shouldnt open its mouth do slow"
---
True so true
---
Make a support ticket on their website
---
Stop replying btw
---
Same goes for my friend, she is always downed and hanged while the killers save me for last even though I just completed like 3 generators by myself while the others rodeo clown for me.
---
It would be cool it he would have a little sister it could summon for Adam extraction. After the Adam is extracted from a survivor it could give the Daddy a plasmid power based on the perks of the survivor it was harvesting.
---
Plague'e tier is actually legit the reason I can't play her when my friend's around
---
Fair enough. I just don't want to be labeled a TOXIC KILLER for rules I didn't even know about but, as you and others have said, it's only a rule survivors made up.  
---
I do try and play fair when it's earned (gen rushed, everyone waiting in the exit, just stare at them and let them leave). 
---
Thank you for the in depth response!

After that, I'd personally recommend going through OhTofu's guides on [pallets and maps](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop).
---
This will give you an idea of what you want to do, which you will then refine over time. Bear in mind that different killers have different powers, and handle loops in different ways - at the start you may find some easier to handle than others, but as you go on you should eventually be capable of adjusting your play "on the fly" as soon as you realise who you're up against and how they're playing.
---
OhTofu and Otzdarva (active on YouTube as "not Otzdarva") do live streams in addition to their videos - the live streams are a good time to ask specific questions on any points you're confused on, and if they're playing survivor then usually they'll provide a running commentary of what they're doing and why.
---
As for gens, there are a few tools that can be used to simulate skill checks - find one that works for you and use that for practice. If you're on controller and can't hook it up to the PC then just run the survivor tutorial's skill check section over and over (you can reset the gen by deliberately missing skill checks). Note that the tools are better in the long run, since the best of them allow you to simulate various skill check penalties that a killer can inflict on you.
---
I'm really glad to hear you're having fun playing the game!
---
Cursed? I call that damn good luck!
---
Theres obviously going to be trolling but id rather that then getting farmed because some dumbass blendette thinks i have DS even though im not obsession and unhooks right infront of the killer. When did they try this btw, i never heard of them trying this before?
---
"U Mad"
---
&gt;Whispers, Ruin, a perk I can't figure out what to decide on as I'm constantly bullshitting it between brutal strength and iron grasp topped with BBQ&amp;Chili.
---
I'd toss on M&amp;A. One of those perks that's good on everyone but it really stands out on Myers, as I'm sure you know.
---
Thats a regular strat to get chased. Its not toxic. Tbagging on the other hand to make fun of the killer is. People just have such thin skin. I play so much killer and none of this affects me other than exit gate stuff bc I know its just a strat to get my attention
---
\*and people wonder why killers play nurse or spirit the most cuz it is the easiest to be on lvld ground while I am over here trying to have fun as trapper while all my traps get disarmed and insta heals are popped while they tbag at the door like "ima come back as spirit in my next game with beads see who tbaggs now"\* nah but for real it ain't easy having fun
---
IIRC  they will not ban anyone for it because its incredibly hard to prove it was malicious, even as coincidental as it may be that the game crashed the moment they got downed. I've had it actually happen to me as soon as i got hit through a window tbh so it can happen. 
---
Leave game is to allow you to leave hostage situations, which is reportable or if you are glitched a gamestate that u cannot get out of, like in a wall/outside the map/falling into endless void to quit to menu without altf4ing the process.

I'm on console so I barely see Nurse's Calling since no one wants to level her up due to how crap she is, but that's a good point regardless.  As for I'm all Ears and Bitter Mur Mur, I never see this ran.  Distortion is just way to situational if you're looking to make the most of it via countering those perks honestly.
---
If u play legion, you should wait for the day of the dead skins on legion and Jane
---
Really ? :O what a compliment &lt;3
---
I feel like at least on console that steve is becoming the new nea or a pal of nea cuz most steves i run into are just the most toxic assholes i have ever gone against
---
That is pretty accurate ahaha. I mean if there was a game chat feature on console, there'd probably be an N word thrown around in there too üòÇ
---
Glad you enjoyed mate &lt;3
---
Am I the only one who can't really hear Michael's breathing as a survivor. But when I play him his breathing is loud.

I want to see the legion and plague badly lol

With a 4 man swf I would write "I like the easy way and if possible, bully someone who's at disadvantage"
---
That would be more accurate
---
I mean like streamers or youtubers who pause, go to the button, and confirm. Why aren‚Äôt they punished?
---
It's a big brain moment that's too much for others to understand.
---
Don't feel bad, it was a Spirit playing Ruin and NOED ;)
---
hmm Freddy should be number one did you see his sexy game in the movies straight rape
---
How does rank reset work? I was rank 12 in both and thought I would go to 18 but only went down to 15. Now I'm getting matched with Rank 10's who were obviously red ranks the day before and getting destroyed.
---
&gt;Remove slowdown when demogorgon charges its blink
---
? you do realize we can still see what you posted right dipshit? You literally are asking to remove the drawback without explicitly stating the word.
---
stop being wrong then btw
---
The fact that you get bitched at for "Slugging" doesn't help either.
---
I mean, any experienced killer knows you gotta do what you gotta do to secure that victory, but a lot of newer/more inexperienced killers get told "Don't slug or your a douche" and as such handicap themselves.
---
I'm from jacksonville so I had to buy the water trash cosmetic. Outside of the Ashy Slashy puppet hand, the sandals with socks really tie the outfit together.

Thank you feng min, can you please verbally recite every rule in the survivors rulebook for killers as I have become rusty on what is allowed and isnt allowed!
---
Mostly for the sexy noise, though.
---
I will add an edited note in case someone is typing a reply after I submitted the original but before/while I'm correcting it. There's been a couple of times I noticed an error or typo and corrected it right away and when I save my correction someone has replied to tell me about my error (that no longer exists.)
---
You're lucky, the survivors I get aren't getting 4k'd by anything less than a high tier killer.
---
generally because banning your streamers is a bad look, and dcing doesn't really matter in this game. Most people DC against specific bullshit killers like prayer bead spirit just to get a fun game, not a "oh boy hope i can mindgame her better when she ignores our counterplay"
---
ah I see, also survivors shouldn't be able to run remove their shift button or whatever its assigned to
---
‚ÄúDude stop. I‚Äôm gonna report you. OH MY GOOODD. AHHHHH **inaudible**‚Äù ~ this leatherface when he saw the speedboost

I think a lotta people that contributed to the toxic Nea stereotype have all switched to playing Steve. I dont think they're new by any means, just playing a new character than the one they did before.
---
What if you wanted to play Huntress, but BHVR said Lerys Memorial Institute
---
Yes, this has happened to me. Too many times

&gt;Females are usually more popular [...] cause of their smaller posture.

Rank reset is covered in detail [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank).
---
If you had went down to Rank 18 then it'd be worth noting that anyone Rank 20 to Rank 16 *inclusive* is given special treatment in matchmaking, in that their rank no longer matters. You'd be in the same situation that you're in now (if not technically a worse one).
---
except it says that frank is nineteen and everyone else is younger.. so doubtful that it's college. especially since it was a small town, doubt it was a "college city."
---
I play Claudette because of her hidden stealth perk, and Ace for his discount Iron Will perk. 
---
I'd like to play as Jeff, but he is so fucking loud. He is more beast than man.
---
Moris take absolutely no skill.  Zero to use.  Ever.  Don't even try that man.  That's like saying keys take skill on survivor side.
---
It's not like you're exhausted the rest of the game m8. And none of what you said is a counter. still, balanced landing is broken on much more than Haddon. 3\4 of the maps have second stories or combines you can use for safe procs. There a reason it's the most used exhaustion perk at rank 1. That and it's passive
---
[deleted]
---
It's not a bug and I'm glad it works like this. Pallets don't make the survivor immune during animation just stun the killer if they both hit at the same time both things happen, one is not cancelled out. Drop earlier, practice timing though don't wanna drop too early and miss the stun
---
If you genuinely eat on this kind of scale I hope your physical health isn't affected. If you're genuinely feeling fatigued or out of breath you may want to get it checked out
---
If this a joke, don't mind me I'm just a stranger on the internet that is well meaning and doesn't understand sarcasm
---
Facts the only reason I play
---
Goodbye!
---
I play on console to lol and more often than not that‚Äôll be a second perk most killers use but i get what you‚Äôre saying as a situational perk

Do you have confirmation for this?

Contacting them via the support channels or the official forums, since that's the place for feedback.

Pig should be higher, you see Amanda‚Äôs sexy bad? Like come on lol
---
Yeah I would hope so because this one seems super easy to get. Steam being dumb sounds like a much more plausible answer.
---
What there's to master in survivors? Loop. As killer you have to learn a lot, and most of things you have to learn as killer are tatics to make the survivor do a mistake (aka double back)
---
BRUH
---
I believe the comment is referring to people who just urban around the map instead of sprinting which, while risky, is almost always more efficient. 
---
Urban is a decent perk when used to break LOS or sneak around corners and avoid detection. But many a new player thinks they need to crouch walk across the map.
---
I thought that was only them reposting it. But I hope it gets I to the game.
---
Maps are randomly generated. There are some "landmark" tiles, yes, but generally you're going to be thinking on your feet.
---
Yes, and with one of those they wont see your aura 'often' and you can pretty much ignore it. With both, an extra token or two would be handy, but its still unlikely they will trigger 5+ times in a match unless you are intentionally ignoring them after after distortion told you they had the perks.
---
EXACTLY !!!
---
I never really played killer before and started with two rules = no camping, no hex ruin
---
It worked the first week 
---
But ever since i got beyond rank 14 i am often getting absolutely wrecked 
---
The more competetive the game becomes, the more i understand why hex ruin exists
---
Sry survivors
---
I think it's because it's a meme. It's over exaggerated on purpose to make a joke and they're poking holes in that. It's not meant to take seriously
---
Das me!
---
I've been buying all the DLCs and even some fancy money. I freakin love this game, but my potato for a computer wont run it.
---
Yep, high rank killer in a nutshell.
---
Yeah i get what you mean that would be cool but difficult to pull off sunce the deva would have to come up with basically new powers
---
Just a baby dweet wearing a trapper mask
---
One advice I can give you is try to play against her like you would not normally do against a killer that doesn't rely on sounds but on its eyes. For example if you are near a pallet you could throw it down by staying to the side of the spirit and try to play around it. Other than that I don't really know other than running Iron Will as you said. Maybe Quick and Quiet can be helpful in some cases
---
They need to remove that damn collision when she‚Äôs phasing
---
I had the same thing before as freddy. Legit thought she was speed hacking and made a support ticket. 
---
Seems like it's just a weird bug :/
---
Deeper into the comment they ask for his email and for him to also e-sign some documents they sent over. Super happy for the guy! I love hearing al these fan made music tracks!
---
yes and by the cool downtime if you cant catch them then thats your fault you legit complaing over perks that don't work with each other and no omly on haddon maybe the new hawkins havent played that map much but even so a rank 1 killer would know how to counter it
---
Thumbs up my guy. Just murdering everyone then giving them an infinite thumbs up
---
ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED IF SOUND
---
That's your usual experience when killer is a hag. It's always a 50/50 if in a chat someone will be calling out for camping/tunneling, when hag just uses her power to jump to the first person stepping on a trap.
---
Agreed, i even try to be somewhat friendly ... well as friendly as a killer can get i guess
---
Fixated helps a lot with stopping her from getting a ez first hit on you, the perk really shines here. Otherwise you need iron will or it‚Äôs gg :(
---
That‚Äôs so fucking amazing! I really hope we get it soonish. I‚Äôve been advocating for new chase music a lot over the past few months. I never thought we‚Äôd actually get it, so I‚Äôm glad he stepped up and they noticed.
---
the wraith has such sexy legs. id say hes above average
---
Nice format!
---
I play Jake because he was the very first survivor I ever played as and I also play Quentin because I loved the Nightmare on Elm Street movies even though Halloween is my favourite Horror franchise of all time which is why I also play Laurie.
---
I also play Steve and Nancy because I love Stranger Things but I mostly play Jake and Quentin.
---
Yeah, being good as a survivor also involves having friends who are also good at video games and coordinating with them.
---
That's just about the hardest part
---
Wtf dude. It's going to be fixed and who cares it's a 5 dollar weapon skin.
---
I like giving Survivors more opportunities to gain Tokens, but the Haste and aura affect is too much. We're Gonna Live Forever is **not** an equal to Barbecue &amp; Chili. If WGLF III was Very Rare, than I could understand, but WGLF III is just Rare. Keeping it contained to just a Bloodpoint gain perk is enough.
---
I agree with this generally, but if you take it to the point of:
---
&gt; that's why survivors always be ao salty and say "killer are overpowere", because, seeing in this way, it's way easier to play killer since survivors do so many mistakes
---
then you've lost the script
---
 &gt;That's why killer is so frustating and will be so painful, you depend on people's miatakes instead of your own hability most of the time to win
---
I don't think this is true
---
Good point but gotta take in alot of consideration here when it comes to the killer age. Frank/legion would indeed make it the youngest physical age. Also if frank is oldest than everyone else is younger than they would at least be 18 since none of them appear much younger than 17 though i always figured joey was the oldest but followed frank around.
---
Thats enough internet for today
---
Seems reasonable
---
Yeah, that might help
---
No. Both take time to learn. Killer is often harder because of the time management and the fact that you can't get carried by anyone.
---
I think the progression of the perk should be 3/4/5 tokens
---
Damn Quick reflexes
---
I feel like killer is easier to pick up, but harder to master.
---
Survivor is harder to learn how to play, but is easier to master.
---
People feel Prayer Beads Bracelet is unfair because there's no practical way to counter it. You have no indication that she's coming for you until she appears, usually hitting you in the process.
---
Rusty Shackles still requires you to trigger the trap, Scratched Mirror has the various penalties that come with T1 Evil Within. There is *no* downside to Prayer Beads Bracelet.
---
True, I honestly always just assumed that Susie was Julie's best friend and Joey was either a friend of her's or just someone who happened to hang out at her parties a lot and thus came in contact with Frank. But either way, Frank is 100% nineteen and all we know is that the rest of them are younger than him, so I always imagined 17-18/senior in high school age.
---
&gt;seeing in this way, it's way easier to play killer since survivors do so many mistakes
---
I meant to say that's how survivor see themselfs, they see killer as a easy side since you as survivor can do mistakes really easy
---
Makes me wonder how they punish the shape since he is what the entity fears
---
The daddy could choose to leave the little sister to harvest or continue to patrol. If left alone other survivors could scare off the little sister. She would of course give a shriek, notifying the daddy. 
---
If he's in proximity to her it's a slow, slow process. Allowing punishment for camping. It speeds up the further away he is. 
---
Maybe...
---
Frank and Julie of Legion are actually both pretty attractive. Suzie looks kinda... Eh, and Joey's alright. Also, if you've ever seen Amanda's (the Pig) face, you know she's actually really beautiful. And in all seriousness, once you see Michael without his mask on, he's not actually that hot, same for Huntress (but she has a killer body tho). Also the Plague vomits. Not sexy at all.
---
1. As a survivor, when I start hearing the chase music and know for a fact that the killer is coming for me but don't know where he's coming from, what's would be the best way to position myself/deal with that? 
---
2. Does looking behind you make you run slower?
---
100% feel the same way. It‚Äôs not impossible to play without it, but it‚Äôs way more stressful.
---
It‚Äôs funny, at NYCC the guys were saying not to use Ruin because it slows the game down too much. Wish that were true in actual play.
---
I bought it a month ago.
---
Battle Pass comes out 22nd so if you play DBD enough that you feel like you'll complete it then save 1,000 Cells as you get the 1,000 back after fully completing it.
---
The new skins are also going to be released so if you want anything from those then wait.
---
You can earn up to 6 cosmetics/2 sets for the Event Skins once the battle pass releases so don't buy them unless you want more than 2.
---
Killer Skins are more for showing off to Survivors (besides the weapon).
---
What? I used Nurse as the example not because of her gameplay (lmao) but because of her complexity, it takes time and experience to be good as nurse/survivor, if you are a bad nurse/survivor the other side will bully you and win and if you are a good nurse/survivor you'll probably win the game if the other side makes less mistakes than you
---
They're pretty easy to avoid.  All you have to do is look around to avoid blinding.  When I get blinded it's my own fault and it rarely happens.
---
Nurse doesn't take much time tbh it's more about having the right addons but it could be different post rework but it's meant to be, The easiest would probably be Legion since he can pretty much do everything we can but he's faster
---
Yeah I considering doing a more gritty serial killer sound but I ended up going with the travelling carnival sound for the sake of flavor.
---
Daddy clown can lick my finger anytime OwO
---
I know they said the Halloween event starts on the 22nd but I‚Äôm not sure if they said the archives and nurse add-on rework also release on the same day. It could potentially release tomorrow or on the 17th but it will definitely be here by the 22nd.
---
Just wanna point out that the purple insta heal will not get countered. The purple insta heal gives endurance on use. Borrowed time gives endurance only if the unhook takes place in the terror radius. The major difference here is the conditions leading to the endurance status effect.
---
You guys need to get laid...
---
Cool motive still toxic
---
....uh....I thought you did get points if the killer DC'd as long as stuff had happened during the game and the killer didn't DC right at the start. Am I wrong?
---
Yeah, no. 
---
I don‚Äôt care how you justify it, it‚Äôs 4 minutes with a slight chance of escape. DCing is cancer and actually cheating. 
---
You say hatch was survivor side but it‚Äôs even more so now. Even if no gens were done a survivor can still escape as long as he reaches the hatch first.  
---
Back in the day you didn‚Äôt even need to slug when only 1 gen was done, now you still have to if you want to secure your 4K. 
---
But hey, we are never gonna see eye to eye about this so ... this is gonna me my last comment in this long chain of discussion (for real this time).
---
Yep, this looks like an easy ban incoming.
---
I could understand that if it wasn't for the fact that BBQ III is Very Rare and WGLF III is just Rare.
---
Yup
---
I'm pretty sure thats what meant to happen but if the killer does option 2 the game treats it as if YOU left in my experience
---
ikr
---
You have yet to provide counter play. All you've done is used broken English and give blanket statements with no backing.  I'm really 1, over 2k hours, only lost twice last week and don't even use ruin half the time. But sure, I'm rank 20 while you're out here acting like the disturbed Ward, mother's dwelling, the clown map, ect don't have balanced landing spots. Ok. Yeah, and hills doesn't matter cut it's easy to catch survivors afterwards even though they're moving faster than 115% speed, sure. So easy. You are daft lol
---
&gt; even though im not obsession  
---
That's not how any of this works
---

---
you forgot to never, under any circumstances, use your power because that is not fair and bypasses le game mechanics
---
According to the surivor rule book section 75 page 4,765 in the notes section at the bottom of the page it says killers shall mori themselves for playing the game at all.
---
Ive butt danced with killers and have had them help me complete a round. Seems to be more a green and purple rank thing though.
---
Yes,where is the part about all the survivors exiting the game when they are put on a hook?
---
I think it was a missed opportunity with clown because he eats fingers
---
Rarity doesn't really mean much though like Balanced landing has a passive and exhaustion effect and that's only Rare
---
What about Hawkins lab? I know its good for killers like trapper and hag but I'm not sure on billy
---
So do exhaustion perks...
---
Yes exactly, if you arent the obsession other survivors cant guarantee you have DS but they act like you always have it.
---
I always run the spirits hex with it and that helps alot
---
ah yes how did I miss that one? you get 100+ bloodpoints and a sticker that says "good job" on it
---
Except if you are smart you can use them properly and negate the downsides entirely like op stated
---
nah you are and i doubt your rank 1 as a huntress main i laugh at you speed means nothing if you can get sniped
---
Might wanna hide their username
---
I just made this as a joke.
---
DS has no say on who the obsession is. It only introduces one to the game if there are no other obsession perks and everyone has the exact same chance of becoming one no matter if they have DS or not
---
Every steve I see is either playing their first game ever or are toxic as shit in my experience
---
* Screenshots highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Yeah, huntress and Billy can snipe people from the hills. But that's 2 fucking killers out of more than 10. Killers like wraith, trapper, ect are shit out of luck.... You really don't think at all do you
---
Guess Im stupid for enjoying the game and performing well? Hardly bragging either, its just a fact- if your going to run into my spirit im going to 4k and enjoy it, seems to me that reddit is just full of baby survivors
---
50
---
Just left hooked the fucker
---
That will be on tomorrow's lesson about how to play survivor
---
To be fair, the lore only says Frank was 19 when he met Julie. It also says the 4 spent a lot of time at mount Ormond while growing very close. That could mean a few years passed between them meeting and being taken by the Entity.
---
I‚Äôm part of Jane gang so I disagree, but they are both hot in their own way but when it comes down to face models Janes is 100% better than Kate‚Äôs I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just ugly
---
The pioneers used to ride these babies for days
---
I alternate between Meg and Nea right now. Working on leveling Kate and Feng cause I enjoy their aesthetic. Sometimes I play as Claudette but I worry people might think I‚Äôm toxic when I‚Äôm not and tunnel me
---
Hol up, how is trapper gonna trap a hill efficiently? That plague one was entirely irrelevant. Wraith isn't fast enough to negate the burst. They will still get to a window. It won't hurt as much, sure, but it's still free chase time. Hag and freddy ain't gonna be able to trap a hill efficiency either unless you spam that shit you'd have to get a hold tier blink to hit a Sprint burster since they turn twice as fast. same with spirit. Legion isn't faster than a burst. And Lord knows demo can't lunge and hit a fresh balanced landing.
---
A broken ranking system doesn't make a game competitive, this game is casual as hell
---
"Screw company policy."
---
Every rule has an exception
---
Pretty much. It makes sense. Most (definitively not all) toxic players are probably teenagers, so there's a good chance a lot of them are fans of stranger things
---
Ty! &lt;3
---
I‚Äôve never have the chance to use DS, but I‚Äôm afraid of removing it
---
I'd say claudette is a good starter too, I found and still find her self care a GODSEND
---
The killer version is also much more consistent in earning the BP.  It's basically 4 guaranteed stacks every match unless you run into a really immersive survivor playing for hatch.
---
Its hard for me to feel bad for the same creatures that blind, stun, t-bag, insta-heal, and flame you in chat for simply playing the game.
---
I had a thought. If you have a full swf.
---
 2  run Spine chill, PTS, resilience and no mither.
---
 1  run spine chill, resilience, no mither, streetwise
---
1 run Spine chill, resilience, no mither, and leader
---
Everyone brings a toolbox. The team could straight shred gens.
---
In all seriousness though, my working man build is PTS, Iron will, better together, and either we'll make it or sprint burst
---
~Probably Jane, Kate, and Nancy to Meg
---
"You say hatch was survivor side but it's even more so now."
---
Oh my god no I see what I've been dealing with this whole time.  That is the most absurd statement I might see on here all day.  The old hatch didn't matter if it was found first or not.  They could find it last and just sit there and force the killer to waste their time or hit them out risk free.  Killers can permanently close the hatch now man.  You are the entire circus if you think the old system way better for killer.  You have a very tenuous grip on the knowledge of this game if that's how you feel.
---
Ghosty: nurses calling, whispers, PGTW and bbq for a basic one
---
The perk is Hex: Thrill of the hunt
---
I mean, that happens when someone stops using their crutch, *they fall flat on their face*
---
I thought that maybe she would‚Äôve hooked the person that she slugged but she targeted me for the first 4 gens.
---
Certainly one of the killers will say yes
---
Say you‚Äôre broken because of Deliverance and Plague pukes on you. 
---
Can you cleanse at all or if you cleanse will it only take off the sickness?
---
Using ruin means you don't know how to do the objective you just chase people the whole time instead of checking gens. Ever heard of overcharge you get rewarded for doing the objective instead of being clueless while running ruin
---
For me they do it while I‚Äôm in an animation like breaking a pallet. I try to look away fast or just hit them. Still obnoxious.
---
I feel this in my BONES
---
You should check out  TrU3Ta1ents ghostface build he has been playing recently. It's REALLY strong. He also did a couple of wraith games with it aswell. It's thanatophobia, sloppy butcher, ruin and nurses calling.
---
Thank you. I'm kinda be new to killer what's PGTW
---
Pop goes the weasel, from clown
---
It's because Steve's perks are ass, I tried so hard to make Camaraderie work in a kindred build and it never does. Whereas Nancy has really useful perks that can actually work in the meta
---
That sounds amazing
---
Remember the always reliable build: BBQ, Ruin, Whispers and Nurses Calling
---
Which is stupid imo. You can‚Äôt escape if you don‚Äôt finish gens. If you can evade the killer and they‚Äôre no competent enough to find you finishing all these gens why should the survivor be punished for finishing objectives????

What the hell does the /s even mean i seen it alot but don't understand the meaning of it

Ohh. I have clown but never played him
---
Casually getting stabbed by a cleaver
---
Pop goes the weasel. The perk where you kick a gen after you hook someone for more regression.
---
Self care and botany without a medkit?
---
Well you don't need to play him if you don't want to, just level him enough to get the teachable
---
:D. I only need Nurses Calling for this build thanks.
---
I was trying to find things that aren't all having different versions. Some new styled perks.

Wow 600 BP that‚Äôs so much like crazy.

WELCOME TO PRIMETIME BITCH

Unless they are beginners who dont know what a "ruin" or "bbq" or "franklin's" is and jusy try and do what the tutorial told them to
---
I've been meaning to give him a try. Rn I'm getting all the survivor perks , then I'm working on killer perks
---
It's because Kira just wants to live a simple life...with some murdering and hand fetish on the side.
---
I try to always have whispers or discordance on ghostface/pig so I know when to start crouching and stay hidden for a quick hit
---
Yeah, that shit looks fire
---
This is me every time I lose and need an excuse
---
ah, I was pretty unclear with the question.
---
No, I've seen people say that there's another change for them coming.  I've seen a lot of people reference this, but haven't been able to find anything about it myself so I'm not sure whether or not to believe it
---
Bugface
---
This.
---
Keep in mind its just my opinion but limiting it to both terror radius AND obsession makes it seem like it will rarely trigger
---
DBD is a casual game and its "ranks" is just an excuse in a often failed attempt to have a matchmaking that separates brand new players from the rest of the pool. 
---
There is no need for ban system, people just need to break out of this mindset of "competitive game".
---
I remember putting on Spine Chill for the first time in a while, and the first game I get is against a Gen-Grabbing Spirit build. Spine Chill carried me to that pip.
---
Np. Do you have anymore art?
---
So you think killer is easier to be good with it because if you're good with it you are good with it?
---
I mean you're not wrong it's just that your argument is pointless.
---
To be fair I'm also a fan of ST and I'm in my 20s lol. I've also been playing Nancy pretty heavily since she came out. I honestly believe the reason for toxic Steves is because the people that literally obsess over him are just fans of all the memes, and "memers" are almost always toxic lol.
---
Dat ass tho
---
I always find a game as killer instantly but survivor queue is always 5+ min. Anyone else have this problem?
---
Deep Wounds also don't count down when you're in a chase, which still happens even when asleep. Unless he's moon walking you (which I guess he can?) you probably won't experience this as much as the rescuer needing to be awake for BT to activate.
---
Ya check my other postings, but be careful, I also posted some NSFW art on other sub.
---
Ghostface for the O face wink wink
---
Not on PC...
---
The Hag does not come free on PC or mobile. It is only console where she does. I'm not certain on Switch.
---
Save progress on cleansing totems, have cleansing totems be 20% slower + normal and great skill checks. That way if a killer hits/pulls you off of the totem, a teammate who finds it can continue the progress. Ruin effects the totems the same way it does gens.
---
What is an anti healing legion? Which perks/add ons?
---
All my prayers are for Dweet &lt;3

But Frank is of age :( he's even getting a shirtless skin

That's why you keep the casual

Iridescent button with Stolen sketchbook
---
Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling and (Coulrophobia/Ruin)
---
freedy, yeah?
---
What annoys me is that the devs fucked up how to view gens popping. Like 5 gens in 3 minutes is...almost certainly hyperbole, but giving you fuck all for shards if the gens get done within 9 minutes is just silly. *An average game is supposed to have all gens completed and 2 survivors dead*. Any ranking system that doesn't account for that is a failure of design.
---
You might want to consider ditching thanatophobia. I've always liked the idea of that perk, but it's usually not very strong in practice.
---
Lol you can actively have an opinion and hate an offering. Everybody is right to their own opinion. Of course a survivor hates ebony mori. It‚Äôs overpowered and takes 0 skill to use. 
---
However I understand why killers like them. You can end matches much quicker.
---
Everyone is allowed to their own opinion and you shouldn‚Äôt shame someone just because ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù 
---
Keys are not a big deal‚Äî- if you want everyone to escape through the hatch you have to finish all 5 generators. In which the exit gates would already be powered. Any good killer can easily delay generators.  Especially with hex ruin. With perks such as barbecue and chili survivors are fucked with ebony mori they have nothing to counter it except running. Killers have perks that counter keys and if they‚Äôre actually good at the game can then kill before the hatch even appears
---
Thats why i wait a day or 2 to play again. Fucking dumbass survivors have been hiding behind trees and waiting to save while crouching as the killer is chasing someone across the whole map.
---
A huge mistake I see so many killers make is "pointless hooks". Putting someone on their first hook at 2 or 3 gens left gets you nowhere, especially if you have other people on death hook. Killers lose so much time in the process of hooking. The worst thing you can do is have everyone 2 hooked with 1 gen to go.
---
Oh cool, thanks
---
Yeah no, allowing to disable maps that the killer would benefit from as well as addons and perks that are crucial in high ‚Äúranks‚Äù would unbalance the game. Both sides apply
---
Kate did that a long time ago.
---
"Whatever" lol okay...
---
Well the killer loses points toward their chaser emblem when the killer stands within 16 meters of the hook, and twice as such when standing within 8. Just give that survivor a bonus based on the killers' loss
---
Deathgarden is unrelated, and the Switch is also a bit of a different issue, because nintendo pretty much always insists on something or another added to their version of the game.
---
Myers is the only person in the game who can Mori people using an add on.
---
 Mori offerings are supposed to be the entity saying 'Sure you can kill some this time', so the theory is that the entity would fear Myers if anyone since he can kill people whenever he feels like it regardless of what the entity wants
---
Idk why these passive aggressive "doing anything but standing in a corner is toxic!" post get so much love. They're about as original as the 20 tier list post this sub gets per day.
---
no fun allowed!! no fun allowed!!
---
I recognise that art style and now I'm scared for Michael lol.
---
Jeez 200 downvotes
---
Overcharge &gt; Ruin. You can‚Äôt find this kinda banter anywhere else.
---
I haven‚Äôt been 100% down with thana either but nobody cleanses so they‚Äôre always injured and they get the full effect of the slow. do you have any ideas of what to replace it with
---
This is great advice. Many killers fall into the Ruin mindset and have a lackadaisical early game. Ruin is 100x more effective when you play as if you don't have it.
---
Lol don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not into Michael that way, only the Doctorüòâ

---
A lot of RNG, but my games could either be 4 gens 1 down, or 1 Gen 4k. I prefer other Gen slowing perks, because ruin can be countered by being good at skill checks.
---
PC will ALWAYS be best, but I have Xbox 1 S. Works fantastic. If you already have an XBOX, just stick with it. Just make sure if you're survivor, please, raise your sensitivity to 100 lol üëçüèΩ
---
I actually had a game against a console nurse after rank reset and ruin popped after about 30 seconds and after 3 minutes and 20 seconds all 5 gens were gone. (I rewatched the video and timed it.) That's when she got her first hook. Poor nurse. She was my inspiration for this meme although she had ruin.
---
Perhaps there should be an alternate item in the game ala consumable item version of Brand New Part found in smaller chests/cabinets.  Bring down regular gen repair (perhaps improve gen-related perks as compensation) and make these little consumables protect against a certain amount of kick damage or improve gen repair speed based on which is installed.  Maybe also slight extension on hook time to accommodate decision-making of saving ally, totem/item hunting, or hitting gens.  Should help Killer buy a little more time and survivors will need to manage item use with drops and such while also doing whatever else they need to do
---

---
You misunderstood kind sir. Mathieu cote the game developper of DBD said that the balancing team are looking at gen speed at the moment but might not be touching at all. Fair point tho, it might be good if gen progression is slower (90 second for a gen) and PGTW apply 15s regression, but this will never be the case.

Yes bc it's my fault the generators spawned on the far side of China from my small house in bumfuck New Jersey.

Killer idea: Remove the power entirely, give em more perks.

Yep. When I was making that comment I went to IMDB to check. 2004. The first Saw film is 15 years old. Time escapes us all.

If you need NOED, BBQ or Nurses Calling then you are a shit killer.

Yeah it's pretty scary ngl. Just really relieved that I actually got the event stuff back, honestly :) Thanks again!! &lt;3

---
Psn: cameron174 im down to group up add me whenever

Only if they turn off any music when she is phasing so I can fucking hear anything, thank you.

If you just remove her collision you will make "win cuz headphones" meme real.
---
Is the Sole Survivor perk working for anyone? I can't seem to get it to work, i get no stacks even if someone dies.
---
Easy Ebony Mori for this crew
---
If you're talking about the right stick movements inverting, its because you're accidentally pressing a button which inverts them, I believe default it's the touch pad but I removed it from controls
---
Yes, yes it does lol. Fuck that makes me feel so old lol. Saw was the franchise I grew up with, it was a yearly Halloween tradition between my friend and I to go and see the new movie every year.
---
Never thought I'd see people asking for Distortion buffs. It's my favourite perk in the game, 95% of the time three tokens is all you need to figure out what it is that's triggering them. It gives too much information to be a hard counter that has more uses imo. Not that I would complain if it did get buffed
---
and then theres rin
---
Could probably guess lol
---
I know that feeling. I have my Plague at Level 50 and so far the perks that wont drop are Enduring, Spirit Fury, and BBQ and Chili. But thank god I have Insidious tier 3 for some reason
---
What if we reverse it - hitting the skill check regresses progress. Missing the skill check doesn't reduce progress but it alerts killer.
---
Scratched Mirror makes Myers super slow, it's only playable on maps like Lery's. Prayer Beads is pretty much uncounterable. If she decides to phase to the gen you're working on you get grabbed or at least hit. And it has no downside
---
Gotta play my boy Ash. Love The Evil Dead/Ash Vs Evil Dead. He cracks me up in the movies and show, and he‚Äôs such an idiot. I love him.
---
Seems a lot less situational now :D
---
Wait, I'm a survivor main.... WHAT HAVE I DONE!
---
Am i missing something? I feel like the guy was just saying he doesnt use Ruin to make the experience more enjoyable for survivors
---
I both understand and sense a new meme format.
---
The Game makes sense to me -- I can generally find my way around and have decent escape and kill rates on it. 
---
Lery's, on the other hand, is arcane bullshit.
---
nah mate ur right, even in deep wounds and chase the timer still goes down against freddy
---
They need to rework MoM completely. The problem with this perk is the effect it gives, Endurance. This effect is far too strong and the current state of MoM basically makes the perk useless to prevent people from getting it.  
---
They need to give MoM a completely different effect which would also include a different way to activate it.
---
Ikr, his mechanics work perfectly with how he is portrayed in the movies. Probably the best designed licensed killer in the game.
---
Thats the problem. What was said and whats been calculated are completely different. Even if you dont take lobby times, DCs, etc into consideration and assume every match is an instant match where you instantly complete every challenge (unhook 2 survivors during EGC, sacrifice all 4 survivors in the basement in a match, sacrifice 2 survivors during egc using noed, etc) it'll take you waaay over 70 to 80 hours to complete. I play this game more than is healthy and even I probably wouldnt be able to complete the rift without buying the remaining tiers with IRL money.
---
PC is supposed to be better because it has a higher framerate and more active players. I play on console and like it just fine. The meta is a bit different on console because there are hardly any good nurse or huntress players on console. Be prepared for lots of trappers, doctors, and Freddy's. Also there are a metric shit ton of spirit and hillbilly players. Spirit is almost never toxic from my experiences, but there are a ton of tunneling, camping, and griefing billies
---
My favorite part about ruin is when a survivor spawns into the game with ruin right in front of them
---
Lmao. Good luck hitting double the checks now
---
That's a good point, meanwhile i do not play these perks
---
I imagine that it's just poor implementation.  Dedicated servers *should* be unequivocally better than P2P.
---
Myers should have ‚ÄúTremendously increases chance to be sent to Coldwind Farm‚Äù in his description.

And I yours apart from Adrenaline sometimes. I dunno what BT is.

You never know.  Shock therapy may not make Michael scream, but one never knows.  üòâ

Besides everybody wants to do Michael.  If this sub has taught me anything, it's that sex god Michael Myers is gospel.  s/ (/s?)

Distortion is good I liked breakdown on a sabo and I‚Äôll be honest I like using aftercare when I do a team build I suppose it‚Äôs all personal use on em I guess
---
Something I feel isn't adressed enough with randoms is when you are on death hook and the one survivor who hasn't been touched all game immerses away from the gen (or whatever you are working on, may it be urban evading away after rescuing you from your second hook) the second a heart beat is heard, leaving you to be exposed and ultimately to die
---
For the Pig's dash attack, what perks do and do not apply with it? I tried googling and kept finding conflicting information, people saying that it does work with Make Your Choice, Devour Hope, Sloppy, and people saying it does not. So I was hoping to get a definitive answer.
---
Hahahaha you‚Äôre right. Maybe Herman can make Michael scream, or Michael could make Herman cry by his huge knife. We‚Äôll never knowüòè
---
This game in a nutshell
---
Ruin now effects all skillchecks.
---
I wouldn't say that they're necessarily pointless, just depends on the situation at hand. If you have two injured and two down, putting someone on their first hook isn't a bad thing, especially if it gives you BBQ intel.
---
Happened to me with huntress
---
Looks like a head on, coach. They stayed in the locker enough for quick and quiet to cool down that‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt hear whoever it was rush out.
---
What‚Äôre the important perks for survivors, and which DLC should I buy first? (I play on Switch)
---
I currently already unlocked we‚Äôre gonna live forever, and self heal. Should I continue working on Nea (lv26) or move on to other perks?
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. If you get hit with borrowed time the timer will go down because you‚Äôre now asleep, meaning you‚Äôll bleed out after 20 seconds and Freddy won‚Äôt have to do a thing.
---
Yep, definitely
---
I'm more "defensive" "bad spirited" and "victim-y" because of these hate threads where everyone I banned, and / or doesn't like me creates these just to get self validation from other people in the same situation. They also want to push exaggerated narratives to slander me and my community to somehow feel better about themselves.
---
Listen to all the other people who got down voted by this circle jerk of a thread and ignore me, watch someone else, fucking wasting your life obsessing over someone you don't like...
---
Also I cant believe you told me to take these circle jerk threads serious, you even read some of them? I will listen to the 99.9% of people who like me not the 0.1% of Reddit basement dwellers who don't.
---
Nothing is ever constructive, its just a reason to create a thread to slander my name. This thread is a perfect example of that.
---
Julie and Suzie are underage my guy
---
No, Frank went mad because Susie was crying, so he wanted to protect her.
---
And the description says the only one that really couldnt do it is Susie, who was forced by Frank, Joey and Julie did it on their own.
---
It‚Äôs not fantastic, especially as your only gen perk. However i‚Äôve had luck using it in anti gens builds and late match it‚Äôs overtaken Thana in terms of the slowdown applied which is important when every second counts.
---
because the totems and gens are already broken enough and too easy to do, so making them easier is a bad idea.
---
I know.

If I don't bring small game I can still work through it while a buddy looks for it. If I do bring small game, no totem will make it through the match.

Patch 2.4.0 - 18 December 2018 (Status is added) 
---
&gt;Survivors now have the ability to mend themselves, or others, without requiring a med-kit. Just find a safe place to stop running and spend a bit of time repairing those internal injuries. The Deep Wound timer now pauses while the Survivor is in a chase and The Killer is shown a location indicator if the Survivor goes down because of Deep Wound.
---
Patch 2.7.0 - 7 May 2019 (Legion is nerfed/DW is buffed)  
---
&gt;The Deep Wound status effect timer does not decrease when within the Killers terror radius.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dc0bzs/apparently_borrowed_time_is_useless_against_freddy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
So here, the meg is in a chase and you can see the bleed out going down, even a frame of her in the dying state. Unless they‚Äôre specifically changed it for the new medkit addon, the same will be for the new addon.
---
-and then disappears into the forest to punish his cock and balls in privacy
---
i had this happen to me before. I let the killer catch me (after running around for a bit cause it was cool) when I could have escaped because I was honestly gonna die if the bug hadn't happened when it happened.
---
He told me to kill myself for hacking and that he reported me. :/
---
Me personally the only perk I always keep is borrowed time. Opinions vary of course, but that‚Äôs the only one I always have, which means I have to put that one as the most important perk. Having an exhaustion perk is usually a good idea too.
---
Nea will have Balanced Landing as a teachable. I‚Äôd recommend getting it for sure. It comes in handy a lot and if you go to Haddonfield, the killer will have a miserable time chasing you.
---
Probably for suggestion that ruin applies to totems as well as skill checks.
---
Yes they changed it, from chase to terror radius.
---
I am simple man. 
---
I see toxic looking swf or bloody Claudette, i bring mori just for them. 
---
I typically 4k most of my games and consider myself to be a pretty good killer main however toxic survivors are still super annoying to go against. My solution? Just kill them with a mori. Nothing pisses of a toxic player more than taking away their ability to play the game and be toxic.
---
most killers simply can't do it well because of their design. most have no mobility or their power is not useful in chases.

It was cleansed when you were in the loading screen
---
LOL You got head on'd with quick and quiet my dude
---
Neither side is easier than the other.
---
**Survivors**: 4 dudes with a 3rd person camera, you can see everything and have a numbers advantage over the killer but that's all pointless if you don't know how the map plays or communicate with the team.
---
**Killer**: 1st Person Camera, Strong Abilities and Perks but doesn't mean shit if you can't down anybody or keep them off of generators long enough for that to matter.
---
K a t e G a n g
---
*raises hand* What about if I have noed or a similar perk in my loadout and or some form of Mori? Should I not be allowed to use them?
---
I haven't actually seen a lot of those lately (thankfully), but yea those are bad too.
---
This. I used to be super lethargic and tired all the time because I was barely eating/drinking anything in a given day just due to anxiety/depression.
---
Once you get a healthy eating schedule and drink adequate amounts of water you really will start to feel better/more awake and energized. It helps me play Spirit/Hag better ;)
---
A problem I had was that making food ‚Äútook too much effort‚Äù so I went ahead and got an electric kettle (lazy mans dream) for Tea/Oatmeal/Creamed Wheat, and stocked up on Meal Replacement Drinks to have for my especially bad days.
---
There's definitely a tier of noob players who's sole objective is to do 2 simple things,
---
 1. See who the killer is.
---
2. Survive until the end. 
---
Usually it's paired with a competent killer that lacks aura finding perks so hiding is very effective.
---
Any idea if they plan to add this outfit?? The Tunnel Bandit outfit would be awesome on this game.
---
It was probably one of yall that disconnected yesterday when I que genrushed him while 1 guy looped the shit out of you. I'm glad you enjoyed my teabags.
---
best tip i can give you is play to have fun. dont worry about ranks or whether you live or die just have a good time with it and you'll never regret it
---
I‚Äôm not sure of the best answer but maybe try disarming then sneaking to the other exit?
---
The way I read it was him saying that Ruin is bad, which it clearly isn't.  I wasn't even talking about the legitmacy of not running things for survivors or killers just the fact that Ruin is MOST DEF not bad.
---
Billy and Hag were probably the best looking before their disfigurements.
---
I'm cool
---
Vibe Check failed
---
I'm *literally* posting the patch notes of the changes. It does not say that it is replacing the chase mechanic, just that it now does not decrease within TR. Either the Freddy thing is a bug, or its the fault of BHVR for not clarifying their mechanics.
---
She just filter-feeds through the bedsheet fabric by inhaling
---
I can tell you're a survivor main OP. I too am a survivor main. But these are a little over the top cool that wall one down to 5/7/11 remove the crutch fro getting caught hiding. And remove the crutch to escape the only killer crutch (NOED).  
---
Also before the rest of you mopheaded, interweb dunderbrains start in on me. I realize its a joke but even jokes can take constructive criticism so sit on a rusty pipe because I don't care about your opinions \^\_\^
---
changing your region should do the trick
---
You're a dick about it but you're right. Kate would have died without the bug. There's no reason to use it for a free escape when you should have died.
---
I didn't even play yesterday. Also jeez calm down lol
---
I'm *literally* telling you how it works in the game.
---
disarm and run to the other as he is distracted. if both are trapped then disarm one and the other even if it takes a few times, then trick him into thinking you are going to run to the other while staying at the other so while hes gone you can disarm and progress the gate a little at a time if needed
---
Ooh I see, thank you :) I‚Äôm looking up Borrowed Time and I can‚Äôt seem to understand how it works, if I unhook someone while injured do I also get deep wound status?
---
What‚Äôs the best exhaustion perk for new survivors? I heard adrenaline is good, but is it only useful once?
---
Trees op plz nerf
---
If you're the last one alive, the hatch is closed and both gates are trapped...it's all over.  Maybe go loot a chest a pray for a key?
---
Demogorgon belongs in a category.
---
Demorgon : *ace dissaproves*
---
Murder flower : *ace approves*
---
Anything which gives survivors exposed still works with the dash, so make your choice would still work. Am unsure about sloppy butcher however
---
they should revert it to 50% per a token instead of 25% because survivor BP gain is pathetic
---
Yeah I run ruin(would rather use corrupt if I had it), discordance(amazing perk, feels so good to run it),bamboozle(vault speed in t3 is insane), and brutal strength(rotate faster when people prethrow pallets) 
---
Works great :)
---
Demorgon? Ha, more like murder tulip
---
She doesn't have a loadout without Iron Will when I run her. Love me some Jane but she can basically be heard across the map.
---
PC is always going to be best if you can build a decent PC.  Consoles are PCs with limitations.

Ah, the golden rule. So far I'm absolutely enjoying it! The whole loadout system and perks are way more robust than I figured the game would be. 
---
Also, I won't lie.... it was amazing the first time I started stalking a survivor and the Halloween soundtrack kicked in. Well done, DBDL.

I love it when a billy hits me with his chainsaw around a 90 degree bend.
---
Test it
---
I do! I'm not at home at the moment but I'll post a link whenever I can.
---
also would you like to sign my petition for more killer concept: pennywise posts? like way more of them
---
What if you wanted to play nurse but BHVR said Yamoaka Family Estate?
---
The YouTube channel NotOtzdarva uploads almost daily, and Otz is very good at explaining what he does and why he does it, so I suggest checking him out.
---
In general, I'd suggest playing both survivor and killer just to know what the other side is thinking/doing since alot of the game is anticipating other players movements.
---
And don't worry about being a bad survivor, everyone starts somewhere.
---
me: tries a new killer
---
survs: teabagging, flashlight flicking, gg ez
---
me: goes back to my 3+ blink Nurse with Discordance and I'm All Ears
---
me: cries
---
No actually, this was around rank 9
---
Sweet. I guess I could just screengrab the moments but if you already have a good screengrab of them that would be great
---
There is rationally disagreeing with people, and there is immaturely picking on them with little to no basis. Politics aside you are making a fool of yourself
---
That is epic as hell
---
I'm 17 I'm cool
---
Tbh me too but I could never say that without downvotes, Nea is wifey
---
Aight hol up, I‚Äôm gonna go finna order some papa johns to em
---
Some people are saying it is since it allows for 100% early game pressure that can't be destroyed within the first 10 seconds
---
I think it's absolutely worthy of consideration as an alternative to Ruin.  I've ran it here and there and found it to be pretty solid.  I hate the idea of them both together though.  If you run them both there's no way they repair gens they spend that timer looking for the totem.  I think it's either/Or.  Whatever I run I like to pair it with Pop.  That shit is amazing as long as you play optimal killer games and don't play to defend hooks.
---
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs written anywhere, but it is implied in the Legion lore
---
**Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs Katelynn Bourne.**
---
It's really all about how you like to play. There are no "meta" perks for survivors the same way killers do. Typically, for a well rounded build, you want one exhaustion perk (balanced landing, Sprint burst, dead hard), one altruistic perk (borrowed time, we'll make it, babysitter), one tracking perk (spine chill, premonition, dark sense, alert), and one miscellaneous perk (self heal, we're gonna live forever, decisive strike, adrenaline). I find his to be a good starter build set up, but I rarely play without spine chill.
---
Oh I forgot to mention each exhaustion perk activates differently so you'll need to figure out which one you wanna run with. Balanced you gotta drop from height, sprint burst you just press the run button, lithe you fast vault windows and dead hard you press the button it tells you to dependant on your platform.
---
Borrowed time is basically giving the rescued survivor an extra hit after they are unhooked. If the killer hits them within a certain time after being unhooked they will get a timer that they need to mend before the end of or they will still go down. It only applies to the person who was unhooked so if you are injured and unhook someone you will not get the effect. 
---
Lithe or dead hard are likely the best exhaustion perk for new survivors. Dead hard will allow you to dodge an attack and will help you get to a pallet or through a window to make a break from the killer. Lithe is also good for new players in that it is useful on all maps and almost impossible to trigger on accident. Others like sprint burst or balanced landing are useful though they can be accidentally triggered. Adrenaline is also good though you have no control over when it triggers. Its great for late game though there is no guarantee you will make it to the end game or will even be injured when it would trigger.  Its great when it does trigger but I have had a lot of games where it basically filled a perk slot and I got no real use from it.
---
no, they need to increase the baseline gain
---
Creamed
---
My thicc girl üòçüòçüòç
---
Corrupt Intervention may be right for you
---
I like it, though I will also admit it I also get a sense of Silent Hill from the Chase/PoV too.
---
But that takes time and bhvr needs time to make spicy chapters and cosmetics
---
If I were you I'd get all your exhaustion perks available, balanced is definitely a good start so work on getting that first since you're halfway already
---
I like this poem
---
Or even Elizabeth/Booker as the survivor
---
Or you do find one and its broken. xD
---
his traps is all trapper has going for him and even traps can be useless if 1. it is a swf that calls out traps 2. doesn't need to be a swf just 1 survivor harassing the traps 3. a survivor doesn't know how to effectively loop a tile and my trap is placed in the spot where the loop would be most efficient.
---
The element of surprise with traps stops working once you keep the trapper busy with map pressure and in general chases. He is still a M1 killer with no extra movement. 
---
It is hard to call trapper a pretty good killer when his traps work against him like an example lets say a survivor is not effectively looping a tile guess what you are now forced to do the same making the loop as effective as it can be wasting your time bc that trap is in the way you have barely any time to pick it up nor do you have time to replace it.
---
The only times where games end fast enough bc of his traps would be bc 1. the survivors probably made a mistake and where overly altruistic or 2. it is low ranks cuz I ain't been in enough games in rank 5 where ppl just run into my traps and get stuck long enough for me to get more downs.
---
I did that once at the exit gate, where there was a Claud and her friend teabagging me at the exit gate, but I exposed them and the Claud got sandbagged and then I teabagged her as she bled out on hook.
---
That was a good match.
---
According to the survivor's rule book for killers, anything other being afk all game as killer is toxic.
---
You're fine
---
Get a grip lmao
---
the first step is literally no perks addons or offerings üò°üò°üò°
---
Or we just delete spirit
---
As somebody who runs last game and finds the ruin totem in 30 seconds and then has the killer dc I can vouch that ruin really ruins games on surv side and killer side not having it
---
Lmao
---
60 seconds is a bit much for ds. There have been MANY times where a survivor gets unhooked I chase the uninjured one, down them, hook them then found the other again and ds was still active for them. It doesn't only punish tunneling it also punishes the killer for having quick chases
---
Welcome back lol
---
Best stuff you can run for killer after the Nurse Patch:
---
Spirit with prayer beads and reactivation time
---
Mori, Ruin, bbq, literally anything you will 100% win if you arent absolutely brain dead thats basically how spirit works
---
Requirements:
---
A headset
---
Well keep in mind I would have to pay for the game pass again
---
Where is the best place to find other people to play with?
---
Doesn‚Äôt fix the problem
---
In the lore, by the time a survivor is brought into the entitie's realm they are all 18+.
---
This was done to dodge restrictions on violence against children in games.
---
Imo hes not bad but not good...hes just full of himself which isnt a bad thing i just dont care for it...its also reason i dont watch tru other then for the occasional giggle when he makes a mistake and says its because the survivor "optimal"
---
Tbh, I wouldn't have any sort of issue with this. 
---
As a survivor, I'd only need to risk one unhook and tank a hit to get my 2x. That's less time I'm spending as a survivor simply tailing an injured guy, hoping the killer will hit me for one token. 
---
As a killer, more people will be running in to take hits, and that means more points and generally more fun times. 
---
It's a win-win.
---
Forgot the shit post tag amigo
---
Makes a post where im nice to survivors: agreement
---
Makes a post against survivors: disagreement. I see, guess you survivor mains aren't happy I made fun of you
---
Joe momma
---
Bruh, chill out.
---
This is really good - but for some reason, I feel the chase music is too happy? I'm not a music expert by any means so I'm not sure how you 'make' music scarier but I feel it's missing something for me.
---
Are any other survivors having trouble getting the stacks for WGLF? Several games now I've had the perk on to get bp and even within the boundaries set to get a stack I'm not getting them
---
These are the people who need to be perma-banned. Imagine thinking it‚Äôs ok to ruin the match for 4 other people because you‚Äôre not having a good time
---
Addition requirements: virginity
---
Why not both?
---
Wait you're a ghost face main? You wiuld react the sane whay if you saw or had to deal with what i did
---
I'm a killer main, stop whining unless you want to start a discussion about balance of the game or things you'd change, otherwise it's a bit pathetic
---
Lmfao, what a pansy if you actually do this......you are literally everything wrong with this game's community.
---
Don't people get tired of this survivor Vs killer who has it worst argument? Like it's never going to be resolved cause nobody sees eye to eye and it's so repetitive
---
Hahah seriously. I'm getting so many down votes for thinking the art is cute?! Cant a girl just wanna  give spirit a hug lol
---
Apparently the discord thinks so
---
don‚Äôt ever be embarrassed of your art! Art is really fcuckign hard, we try again and again and even the best of the best hate their art! it‚Äôs a long ass process, I apologize if my criticism came off too harsh!! Like I said it‚Äôs a good try and your skills will only go uphill every single time you practice, even if it‚Äôs a doodle friend
---
If you exist I will DC
---
I got to say huntress, pig, and all the legions are the hottest
---
Darn.
---
BHVR OFFICAL LMAO
---
Thats simply not true. Spirit is hands down the best killer there.
---
def go with the mask next time. Hiding the fact you are a guy would make this super convincing
---
Ash is hotter than *Feng, that‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs a fact.
---
Its showing that everything in my comment before the /s was sarcasm, as the /s means "lose sarcasm"
---
Lol üòÇ
---
That looks disgusting, does it always run that bad? Or are some maps better
---
I never thought I'd see this format again
---
He kinda does look like a hungry dumpling though...
---
Perfect thank you!  I do try my best to help teammates esp when they're being tunneled, but I honestly just get downed right after a save so I feel much more like a burden. Lol I'll have to try quick &amp; quiet and dwm!
---
Lol ez trigger
---
I read this so often here, is this PC specific? I have nearly no problems since 2 days after the last patch on PS4
---
**IF SURVIVERS SPAWN OUTSIDE IF HOOKS, I WILL QUIT**
---
PLEASE LET THIS MEME FUCKING DIE ALREADY
---
Dbd is the only competetive multiplayer game with no dc penalties
---
The only one that is getting punished by a survivor dc'ing is the killer getting less bloodpoints/bbq stacks 
---
And that's not fair at all
---
I honestly don't know if there's a bad map for nurse
---
Who dares to downvote me
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean it counts for killers
---
Nancy because she is cute. I wish I had a better reason. 
---
Though I feel like Nancy's are getting tunneled right now... but... we still cute. So it's a win win.
---
Shit, il have to go ask my uncle for it back
---
I wanna see her squeeze that egg out.....
---
I don't think that's necessary. In builds that rely on Hex perks, you have the option of running Thrill of the Hunt if you want to be able to defend totems.
---
to be fair Robert did say the new Freddy was good but he thinks the reason the movie wasn't a hit was bc there was so many remakes that year
---
Not exactly answering your question but your rank minimum is 15 unless you don't play for a while.
---
\*Crickets chirping for four months straight\*
---
The only reason DC‚Äôs weren‚Äôt punished sooner is because they couldn‚Äôt track them properly. Now that dedicated servers will allow them to properly track players who DC frequently, I absolutely believe this DC‚Äôing epidemic will be nothing but a bad memory in a couple months time
---
What‚Äôs the music at 2.30 to 3 ? Thanks :)
---
what?
---
Ah ok fair enough. And yeah, youre right.
---
Then f in chat
---
I just had a game. I'm Dwight with brand new part purple toolbox leader and prove thyself all four of us are on a gen. It's about to pop. Start of the match. Everyone at once gets a ruin skillcheck. Gen starts over... Ruin is god tier when it works. The killer almost lost a gen in 10 seconds of the match starting. Ruin bought him a 3k.
---
Look at this hot pile a garbage
---
Well keep going bud I will not see you on dedicated servers once DCs will get rly punished
---
Ghostface + Discordance = Stonks
---
I like to run T3s of Decisive Strike, Deliverance, Unbreakable, and Breakdown. Sometimes I like to swap out Unbreakable and Breakdown with either Urban Evasion, Borrowed Time, or Balanced Landing.
---
We have a campfire sticky post on this sub every Friday where people find others to play with.
---
Have you heard of the Youtuber/Streamer ‚ÄúNot Otzdarva?‚Äù His trapper gameplay is probably the best I‚Äôve ever seen. Just watch one of his Trapper videos and you can see how crazy of a killer he can be. You bring up that his traps are bad for loops, but if you know how to properly predict survivor movement and patterns you can easily cut off their usual loops
---
They thought they werr playing you
---
"How dare you attack me when I chose to only move 10 feet from the hook upon being unhooked, loudly groaning in the bushes without Iron Will, while my teammate is long gone!"
---
That would be nice but maybe that would give hex totems more power to the fact if a killer is running like HG they would have no reason to go protect that Hex that they don't know what it is idk seems good but seems nefarious
---
The only one I‚Äôve found consistent is the safe unhook stack. The protection hit stack is super spotty.
---
What hell are you smoking?
---
I dont want to sound like someone with a bad attitide but look at the front page of this subbreddit - there is a video of Kate using an exploit to escape a killer and people are clapping like its some sort of an achievement - i believe im good changes, that's why i am stuck with this game for 3 years now, always coming back, i just hate the fact that they are coming so slow
---
Killer is OP. Buff Survivors! - BHVR probably
---
Yeah I definitely could have dialed back the melodic parts a bit to make it scarier but I imagined Clown laughing and lumbering after people when he hits them with a bottle or gets stunned and it just made me feel like that would make the more happy circus melodies seem more creepy in context.  By itself it does sound more cheery than it should probably.
---
I‚Äôll take that at this point. Gives me a reason to run calm sprit.
---
Can't wait for you to find a new game, crybaby.
---
If it's a SWF I do go for the easy kill, but if I think it's just solos farming each other, I go for the unhooker.
---
yeah, something is 100% wrong with achievements. I have my "rarest" achievements on my steam profile and previously they've all been dead by daylight related (Adept Feng was not on there) but suddenly I have ones from other games too.
---
how do you think they would show which is which? just curious, do you have suggestions? :3
---
You removed the Bhvr official but didn‚Äôt add the shit posting tag?
---
PS4
---
Yeah, this whole post was a hot mess. Lol
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dhvfau/he_joe_mommad_someone/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Fair point, but Survivors could also use it in some ways, like say a Killer has Thrill, but they aren‚Äôt coming around when a Survivor starts cleansing one of their Hex Totems, it could rip off the Survivors to the fact that they might be wasting their own time or about to screw over the team
---
Yes but have you ever heard him say himself "the trapper is weak" weak doesn't mean he isn't fun but you can not miss the fact Otz knows what is his weaknesses.
---
Which comes back to the point that Trapper is hard to be called good and just bc a couple people can play him really well doesn't mean the majority can which ofc can be said "well you should learn" his kit is still weak even against himself
---
&gt;It proves that the skillcap for survivor is so much lower than killer. 
---
No, it proves that because there's 4 survivors on the match and only 1 killer, so you won't be occupied the whole match.
---
Also just because you are 60% of the time not being chased doesn't mean it's easy match, the whole point of the post is: killer is easy to play because they depends on survivor mistakes"
---
you only got 19k tho
---
They lose 1 pip if that's what you are asking
---
Maybe flashing the symbol for it? Do the ruins have their own symbol? Like for how they appear on screen for survivors
---
Hmm, simplest way I could think off is have the symbol of the Hex appear when the Killer is looking at the Totem? Same way with how the Mori icon appears? Or maybe even color code the Totems lol?
---
Twerking?
---
Aw your postie-wosties got deleted :(
---
It is a interesting idea I think a lot of people have had but I feel like some people out there already know how to abuse it
---
I is cat
---
Lets just make a movement od posting this pasta to every bhvr forums - this would be fun
---
I mean their is no current way to tell the difference between a ruin, devour, NOED, Lullaby or anyother Hex without it getting cleansed.
---
They should have a icon above the totem so if you have a Hex perk, it will display the Hex perk on said totem to the killer.
---
Freddy's new Mori, fucking yeet the survivor on the ground
---
Keys don't take skill, but what does that mean exactly? The act of using a key isn't what's skillful, the skillful part is A) doing enough generators for the hatch to spawn B) finding the hatch whilst avoiding the killer. 
---
Same with moris. You still have to hook them, and down them again. 
---
Moris and Keys are just things, whereas the skillful resolves around how you come to use these things, they aren't insta wins in anyway.
---
That was a freaking rollercoaster, thanks
---
I don't think all of DBD subreddit is people who bully or snipe me. I KNOW people who create THESE malicious hate threads are. If you cant see the difference between this thread and a normal one I don't know what to say. Its made to attract like-minded people who circle jerk over 99% lies, 1% truth.
---
You seem like a sound-minded guy but don't understand the full picture. This is shit what makes me not like reddit, be pessermistic...etc any normal person would be the same. Try having no lifers obsessing over you and slandering your name any chance they get, then get back to me.
---
Any Spirit who runs NOED with Ruin instead of Haunted Grounds with Ruin deserves lobbies full of Nancys.
---
He has a 6m terror radius while in tier 1 so with monitor and abuse he has no terror radius while not in chase. This makes it so u can get even closer to survivors without them noticing or so you can get gen grabs.
---
Considering I drew this, that's actually really cool to hear!
---
No problem, rather be safe than sorry
---
I like to run T3s of Decisive Strike, Deliverance, Unbreakable, and Breakdown. Sometimes I like to swap out Unbreakable and Breakdown with either Urban Evasion, Borrowed Time, or Balanced Landing. (I just typed this same comment in response to another post.)
---
Not really, it has greater latency, your information has to go to a server than to another player instead of directly
---
it's frustrating how ruin is almost a necessity for killers
---
For Trap Dad I've been having a lot of fun with:
---
Lullaby/Unnerving Presence/Distressing/Blood Warden
---
Oily Coil/Bloody Coil
---
For survivor I either use my meta build:
---
DS/BL/Inner Strength/Adrenaline
---
or my Houdini build:
---
Calm Spirit/Iron Will/Quick and Quiet/Dance With Me
---
Also for a female survivor her grunts of pain are pretty quite, if it wasnt for claudette nancy could have been the best female survivor.
---
First in response to your survivor recommendation just no to Self Care.  Literally any other perk in its place.  That perk is hot game losing garbage once you're anywhere near red ranks.  I cannot tell you how many games I've seen thrown away by Self Care Gamers not touching gens and wasting 40-60 seconds a pop throughout the game slowly healing themselves.  Replace it with Adrenaline and it'll encourage better prioritization and decision making mid-late game.
---
I just played against a Sloppy Than Legion where I had Irridescent Lightbringer and Evader because I ran the killer all game and solo'd 3.5 gens but the survivors spent literally the entire game healing themselves.  3 Self Cares in the lobby....
---
No problem, is much rather be safe than sorry
---
He used to have 8 meter of terror radius in tier 1
---
Aight bet
---
ios or android?
---
accept your fate bud
---
Would you like to be robbed of your victory?
---
And they did intend to do that, she has the Control over her character doesnt she? 
---
She doesnt unintentially open the gate and i am sure she would unhook too if given chance
---
You could have gotten Spirit for free by grinding iridescent shards. Shame that people in this thread suggested her. It would‚Äôve been better to use auric cells on a licensed killer like Leatherface because they can‚Äôt be bought with shards.
---
dude..... new 4 pack survivor idea the Scooby Gang. maybe even have a killer like the ghost pirate dude or something.
---
That's fine you can think that I just think the jokes gone too far.
---
you literally said right off the bat of your post that you haven't been playing this game for long, survivors already have a different number of win conditions. seems like you just want an easier game that requires little effort and im not for that. try learning the game, how to counter perks and be able to recognize perks in game and once again you literally said you've put "only a few months" and you're still having difficulties? so just try learning the game instead of trying to make it "easier"
---
I thought it said rabbits instead of habits and I was so confused.
---
They get almost nothing for it so just unlucky, give your team time to do gens and go next
---
I enjoy sneaky Doc a lot. His two best Calm add-ons which reduce his terror radius in punishment mode combined with M&amp;A, Dark Devotion, Tinkerer and Furtive Chase.
---
I just make sure not to get downed twice.  That's nice and all but like you can't really rely on that unless you're still stuck at potato ranks.  Queue against some Red Rank Spirits and tell me how reliable that gameplan is for you.
---
Also this didn't start as me "whining" about anything.  I was just shutting down that absurd statement that the two biggest crutches in the entire game in keys and moris require skill.  That's what this was from the jump.  It only turned into criticism of both mechanics as you continued to attempt to defend them as skillful mechanics.
---
that's not the same as disconnecting from a game tho. not at all. leaving from the loading screen doesn't affect other players except for a small loss of time
---
*actual* disconnecting - like after the game loads - has a number of ill effects
---
That would help gameplay wise but it wouldn‚Äôt make sense that he couldn‚Äôt step in his own bear traps. Maybe a buff where he gets all of his traps at the beginning of the game would be better, that way his setup time isn‚Äôt so long.
---
Sorry about that, but I did just add you now!
---
Run ds, borrowed, stuff like that , helps a lot
---
Somehow I feel like this is the majority of killers I get rip
---
ton of harri steve
---
nah. im good. i like the silence and immersion it allows me to actually be creeped out at times. Friday the 13th had voice chat, and while great at times, it lost its effect when you are getting chased by Jason singing the Mickey Mouse song or talking like Donald Duck
---
he got them thicc legs just take a big step over
---
Muh Fashion
---
Need I remind you this is the Dead by daylight subreddit?
---
I mean they do get punished for it by losing score when ranking up. It's technically a valid strategy, but not a good one. Eventually once you rank up more you'll encounter campers less because good killers dont need to camp/realize it doesnt work.
---
If a survivor is being carried to a hook, you can body block to get a stack.
---
Why don't y'all take your gay shit and post it where it belongs at r/gaybydaylight or whatever the fuck it's called. I think it's that.
---
RIP like to dislike ratio. Honestly if you say anything bad about either killer or survivor, the side your ripping on will get butthurt and massive downvote.
---
In other words: Why are you booing him he's right!
---
Leave bubba alone you bastard
---
Yeah, I think Sleepy Dwight is great, but I could see it being in a similar vein.
---
I don‚Äôt see many people running this build so for me it would be scratched mirror Myers 
---
Fun as Myers, hell for survivors 
---
Add on: Scratched mirror, boyfriends memo 
---
Perks: monitor and abuse (the rest are up to you) 
---
Offering: Lery‚Äôs or The game
---
My guy, i need you to go to dbd HQ rn
---
&gt; And they did intend to do that, she has the Control over her character doesnt she?
---
she didn't intend for that effect to occur. and the fact that it happened doesn't mean she has to go "oh no guess i better just let the killer kill me"
---
&gt; Would you like to be robbed of your victory?
---
robbed? stop being so dramatic. and no it wouldn't bother me if literally only one person got out because DBD pulled a DBD
---
I will say tho, there are some people in red ranks that don't know how to handle ruin. They have to spend the next 20 minutes of the game to go find it instead of just doing the gen
---
It was more complicated for that... it‚Äôs also been a while since they made it... let me look for the guide on how to do it, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll find it nor if it still works
---
For the top one it should be eats candle wax and shards of glass
---
What if you, wanted to play nurse, but BHVR said yamoaka real estate
---
All I have are Bruh Moments
---
He has undetecable effect in tier 1.
---
See that's exactly the behaviour i despise and dont want to argue about it, any form of DC just because you didnt like something in the game is bad - you waste people time
---
Someone doesnt have all day to Play games, people have Jobs, famillies, and you force them to search for the game again - how is that fair for anyone?
---
People like their ruin I guess, didn‚Äôt know it was a touchy subject.
---
How is that even possible? It shouldn't be, the game doesnt allow you to take control of your character until everyone has loaded in
---
Are you sure? He has undetectable status effect when he is in tier 1 now. Maybe he got buffed?
---
Where is this from?
---
Question. Can I use it to distract you from whomever you're chasing?
---
I mean yea I get that it‚Äôs a strategy but it makes the game no fun lol thank god it appears less as you rank up, I‚Äôm over it
---

I got it for free but I've played BHVR back by buying every DLC
---
Scooby is the killer.
---
I think that a core component of the game such as leveling up is more important than giving your character some new clothes. The wglf thing is not good enough because not everyone wants to sacrifice an entire perk slot just to get an acceptable amount of points per game.
---
The thing is gen grabs are so annoyingly Inconsistent
---
Happens all the time and I hate it
---
*So I bring hawkin lab offerings if I ever get them*

Am i the only one who thinks billy's better?

I can‚Äôt find the original guide, but someone posted [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/de6dwf/if_anyone_wants_to_take_part_in_the_dead_by/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) a week ago
---
So?
---
Look at the video again - lf has clearly won this game, he knows where Kate is, where the hatch is, most of the pallets are gone
---
Just because you wouldnt care for loosing one survivor doesnt mean everyone else would - maybe IT would be an achievement for someone and you take it away because what? Oh i guess exploit happen, better abuse it ?
---
Yeah, especially with her nerf
---
it's literally only like 3 minutes to get a new match chill
---
There‚Äôs a time and a place for camping, when it makes sense to do so is when the other survivors are *way* too altruistic and are basically lining up behind you while you hook the person or when the gates are powered because quite honestly in most cases it‚Äôs far too risky to attempt to defend gates when someone is hooked, or just when the hooked person has been sandbagging or trying to farm the other survivors 
---
When it doesn‚Äôt make sense to camp is early-mid game when you need to apply pressure if you‚Äôre sitting on the hooked person you‚Äôre applying no pressure, generators are being done, and you‚Äôre loosing points
---
unless your toxic as fuck i never get these type of killers.  Outside of being targeted for being the one that found ruin im surpised you find this many, unless your on console in which case welcome to how they play
---
Ya he wears a black underwear, you can check here. https://twitter.com/Nanadagger/status/1182079500093448192?s=20
---
Feels better than fuckin joe momma
---
I accepted it
---
I'm fine with it most of the time when my teammates are doing gens so at least the killers just getting me and that's it. What I hate is when the others just crouch a few meters away from me staring at him face camp me, this means that he can playably get a 4k since they didn't punish and it shows the killer that face camping is a valid strat since no one is punishing him....
---
Just added you. I kept bouncing back and forth from 7/8 Rank and could never seem to pip any further. But yeah, my friends aren‚Äôt online at the times I get on, and not many play DBD. Which is why I‚Äôm here asking.
---
Do they even stack beyond purple? Mist doesn't.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt. But doesn‚Äôt always do it. Sometimes you get downed as a survivor while your camera is spinning around with you unable to do anything about it. It shouldn‚Äôt happen to killers like ever, but since the last patch it became a possibility
---
shes annoying yes but not delete her annoying, old legion was literally uncounterable in any way.
---
I'm both Ghostface/Legion and Clown but minus the 6 packs/day
---
I personally think it depends on what killer your using and what other perks you're using.
---
For some examples:
---
High mobility killers or snowballing killers like billy generally benefit more with things like pgtw.
---
Killers that need to control a small area or have poor map pressure such as trapper generally benefit more with corrupt.
---
Stealth killers like ghostface seem to benefit most from surveillance or corrupt.
---
End game builds (bloodwarden, noed, remember me, etc) obviously don't really need any.
---
Ruin works decent on all that were mentioned, but it's a gamble. If you're willing to take that gamble than go for it.
---
I'm able to, I'm 15.
---
But nah, it's all about Jane and Ash and...
---
Mommy Huntress ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
I tried to get the Adept achievement on some of my lesser played killers last night and failed miserably. Its right after rank reset, so I'm sure that was part of it, but man, not having perks to counter the Gen rush is rough.
---
Yeah but there's a lot more going on than just the ping number.  We would expect a dedicated server to be better than P2P for things like quality of connection, spare bandwidth capacity, and available CPU cycles.
---
At the very least, a slightly higher average ping doesn't explain the crazy lag hits we've been seeing.  There has to be *something* else causing that.
---
I'll wait to see some results. right now, i still see rq/dc too often sooo...
---
Both are ugly. Pig is the hottest
---
Queue can get as long as 15 minutes for killers, and its punishing for people WHO want to play their games for no reason other than entitled survivors dc'ing
---
Likewise, and I also just sent you a friend request.
---
Thats actually what i do in a group of friends. Its like the killer didnt even have it
---
Why is this on dead by daylight subreddit?
---
Nope, his phone or tablet just bad. But even on flagmans game got fixated 30fps. Maybe because of heat of processor.
---
&gt;Do you have any idea how easy it is to pop 3
---
And that doesn't take some skill? There's a reason there's a ranking system, because those survivors should, hopefully, have played the game enough to understand what to do and what not to do. Even then, they still need to find the hatch afterwards, which isn't easy, specially on more annoying maps.
---
&gt; If they really want to get slimy with it they can play to proxycamp, down you immediately
---
Again, that isn't the mori itself but the skill around it. Even they didn't have a mori, the survivor in question is still fucked. All the killer has to do is wait a minute and then hooke them again to avoid Decisive. 
---
Again they're just things. This is like saying a "using a baseball doesn't take skill" of course, because its just a thing and the skill/lack the or of revolves around how its use.
---
Kinda feel like Steve should be Shaggy.
---
okay
---
clearly you take this game very seriously in a way that i dont. you take it so seriously that it has created an impasse
---
Send this to the devs not us
---
I'm pretty sure that disabling her collision would be a very difficult process as its not just giving a stat higher percentages or adding seconds to a clock
---
*&gt;BHRV doesn't put any effort into the lore*  
---
*&gt;doesn't even have the slightest idea of the lore*
---
  
---
You just played yourself Mister.
---
It doesn't matter if you kill somebody, the entity recognizes the potential in someone.
---
Take Rin for example, she didn't kill anybody in her life, she probably didn't even hurt a single fly. Yet the entity chose her over her dad. Why? Simply because the feeling of revenge in her was so strong, way stronger than her fathers desperassion, it made her so easy to distort into a grim mindless husk of her former self and form into a ruthless killing machine. 
---
Same goes with Adiris, she was a genuine nice person when she was alive, always trying to help but i don't have to tell you how she ended up the way she is now do i?
---
As for the Legion, the Key Part is Frank, he doesn't have a purpose, is impulsive and fast to anger, while the other ones are just lemmings. The entity had the chance on a free 1 for 4 deal and it took it. They would follow Frank anywhere and manipulating Frank to do the entitys bidding shouldn't be a hard nut to crack.  
---
Instead of being a whiny little brat, why don't you inform yourself first before you try to fling your shit at BHRV.
---
Look at the gameplay, look at the mechanics, you are not getting a triple A story script, but imho BHRV is doing a fantastic job with game lore so far.
---
If you do Huntress, please do Russian Hardbass or Careless Whisper
---
Hence why on many killers sloppy, nurses, and ruin are very optimal
---
I'd color code the aura for the killer but this opens up a can of worms for people who suffer from color blindness. 
---
IDK how to implement it besides color coded auras. I don't know if the game can even support something like highlighting the perk icon when you're looking at a hex, or having a little symbol appear over the totem.
---
Didn't know about that one, Ill check it out
---
Oof -440
---
I expected to be downvoted. Most users here agree that spirit takes skill to play, which she doesn't.
---
Another cute comic, plss more! &gt;w&lt;
---
Of course you wouldn't know what BT is. Based on your opinions on killer perks, you definitely seem like yhe type if survivor to farm your teammates.
---
crying meg in your style is so adorable oml
---
Why all those tho? Calms + Monitor themselves turn you into sneakier Myers
---
Brilliant. Now we can have ruin gone in literally minus seconds from the match starting instead of 5 seconds after the match starts.
---
This is perfect to me. I find the strings coming with the "Survivor found" event perfect for some reason.
---
The approaching *could* be tuned down a bit to match the chase music itself though, but I personally love the thumping beat fading out with the coming of the strings too.
---
Also, I command that, as a Hag main, a Hag chase music be done at some point.
---
Keep it up. I love these.
---
Devour Hope on anything
---
A lot of people trying to play as killer at your rank probably
---
nothing like a bloody rag to filter your raw guts through
---
A lot of his videos are him fucking around and doing meme shit. Not running the same eight perks every match with little variety.
---
No, BVHR said that everyone in game is over 18
---
They only got 9 k tho lol
---
I started working on a legion yesterday but have been sick for the past 2 days so it may take a few days to get out
---
&gt; Queue can get as long as 15 minutes for killers
---
if you're playing at 2 am on christmas maybe 
---
do you get this mad about killers who dodge lobbies?
---
Had that too. Just get a ticket and they‚Äòll restore it :)
---
A down that bypasses flip flop and endurance.
---
I mean, vaulting that pallet WAS unnecessary
---
Ye, gives people an incentive to play other killers instead of the same crap.
---
I know what BT is, I just forgot it was for Borrowed Time. I don't farm my teammates.
---
I used to play on pc but I don‚Äôt have a computer anymore so I can only play on the switch. I‚Äôm a lower rank too as I just started playing I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm toxic I feel I play pretty fairly.
---
He has undetectable ON THE PTB
---
it‚Äôs not on live yet
---
Rank 14.. so you think is unbalanced because you killed in one game baby survivors.. okay dude.
---
I love seeing your posts, always excited to see the doctor üò≠üíó
---
Wow you just furthered proved how fucking toxic you are and a mother fucking cunt ass bitch. :) 
---
My points still stand. Killers vs survivors always have conflict in interest. Thanks for assuming I‚Äôm a rank 15 when actually I‚Äôm a killer and survivor main that‚Äôs played rank 1. Currently rank 9 rn bc of the reset but fuck off. Killer rank 4 but go off.
---
AY I get it cuz he says that in the show
---
Who knows, maybe he killed Freddy and the entity got mad.
---
You really think a toolbox or medkit require skill? How so? They do not. They may not be as powerful as a key, but they don't require "skill" to use them.
---
Are you okay with instaheals? Purple toolboxes and medkits with efficiency and speed add-ons? All them including keys and Mori's tip the scales one way or another. It's where you decide to draw the line. But none of them make it impossible for the other side to win.
---
You are just disrespectful, argue with someone else, i dont have the will anymore, the point of discussing an argument is respecting one, you fail to do even that, there is no point
---
Oh god that‚Äôs an old meme

Have my upvote

Look under his power, right next to tier 1...

That's not live yet. Tier 1 Myers has had a small terror radius for years.

New killer: *The Chicken*
---
oh they finally added a drawback to prayer beads! /s
---
The switch is filled with campers. Especially face campers.
---
I called someone out for this, saying it was speedhacks because I have never seen it before, but maybe this is some new bug. They didn't even have a speed boost perk.
---
Feel free to message me when you want to game.
---
The perfect specimen
---
Popping 3 gens at Red ranks?  No that absolutely does not take skill.  Come on man I play both sides at reds and we all know how quickly gens pop in this game.  Honestly it takes skillful play from the killer to pressure them correctly and end their games with gens up period.  3 gens is pretty much an assumption up at red ranks.  I am fortunate enough to end the majority of my games up there as killer with 1-2 remaining which prevents them from ever having an opportunity to get more than 1 out without a key but I know plenty of players struggle to achieve even this and routinely see their games reach endgame.  3 gens is nothing at that rank.  I have games where I solo 3 myself up there.
---
Natalia Dyer is in my top 5 hottest actresses so I mean yea
---
There we go brother. I have unpopular opinions which I honestly believe are true but some only killer mains on this subreddit love hating for no reason. Skins the size of a loose leaf paper
---
I honestly think it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm a lower rank the more comments I‚Äôm reading. Because it‚Äôs always early-mid game &amp; it‚Äôs not like it only happens to me I‚Äôve watched them do it to any survivor, it‚Äôs just how they play and it‚Äôs no fun. I understand when it‚Äôs end game and they do it.
---
It is a risk we all take. I mean, I'm getting downvoted for supporting a niche sub so what can ya do I guess.
---
punched the FUCK outta dwighty-boi
---
Yeah he's not undetectiable yet so you need to run monitor to not have a terror radius for now. Once the next updates released and he does have undetectiable you won't need monitor anymore.
---
this made me cry
---
It‚Äôs his unique passive. The one he has always had and that he‚Äôs getting replaced next patch. 
---
Live tier 1 Myers: 6m terror radius, immune to aura revealing perks/items, immune to stuff like Premonition or Spine Chill
---
PTB tier 1 Myers: 0m terror radius, immune to aura revealing perks/items, no longer immune to stuff like Premonition or Spine Chill
---
No, you don't.
---
In some regards he is however he can be played around much easier, hence why he‚Äôs 3rd best for most people
---
yes
---
This. This is my favourite compliment.
---
lol how am i being disrespectful?
---
i'm going to assume this answer means that you don't care about lobby dodges rendering you a hypocrite. thanks
---
I think Kate should be Daphne. Idk I like Steve as Fred because he has a similar build. Dwight and shaggy also have similar personalities.
---
Rip
---
It‚Äôd ruin the game
---
Crutch mechanics like DS? Or Noed? Or some even argue Borrowed Time, any exhaustion perk, etc. Like I said, every item, add-on, perk, etc. favors one side or the other. The real debate is how much they favor and if it's too much. If you can't see that then idk what to say.
---
Also fyi, I'm red rank survivor and killer. So I've faced plenty of red rank spirits and other killers. Same goes for extremely efficient red rank survivors.
---
Porque no los dos?
---
How did you not get to the exit and the killer not trigger the endgame collapse?
---
r/DBDGoneGay
---
Is what you're looking for.
---
I‚Äôm rank 9 rn and I still always get paired with rank 20s. 
---
The matchmaking system is shit.
---
And I oop
---
Hillbilly at home is pretty rad. Leatherface with both speed addons and simply act as a discount billy and never stop chainsawing. 
---
One Punch Man is another good one. Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, (new) Dying Light, and Rancor. Ignore obsession all game, one hit mori at the end.
---
yeah console players are ass and dont care or know about the meta at all. They just go full "must kill the guy i have hooked" without knowing mechanics
---
Spine Chill is the best perk.
---
Fight me.
---
As I've always said, prisoner's dilemma.
---
I haven't run Ruin since 2.0 came out outside of very rare circumstances. Its effects are greatly overstated IMO. It's one of the most inconsistent perks in the game and by the time high rank hits, most teams understand how to hit a skillcheck or know where the totem will be within a minute or two. I'd rather run stuff like Corrupt Intervention, Pop, Enduring/SF (Quicker Chases = More Hooks = More Pressure = Less time on gens) and others.
---
balanced landing
---
Really?! It‚Äôs almost like survivors have the ability to end the game so quickly any killer besides nurse and spirit have no chance against them.
---
Not saying the survivors always use this ability with them either being immersed, toxic, and or dumb. But the ability is there and it hasn‚Äôt been changed in 3+ years at this point. 
---
Nope, a battle pass and making MoM activate more than 1 time are definitely more important than competitive balance.
---
Jane has more of Daphne‚Äôs personality though I‚Äôd say
---
I know right? Would love to see that concept elaborated on someday with the archives adding more lore to the game
---
You would think with Inner Strength + 1k BP + no noed would entice you to do totems more often. Sadly that's not always the case.
---
Funny enough if You replace ruin with DS or BT from a survivors perspective of tunneling/camping killers it would make just as much sense.
---
But in seriousness why should survivors who are not in a chase or hooked do anything besides gens? Hooks respawn making sabotage worthless and turning their use to gens most of the time. Searching chests is a huge gamble rarely in favour of a survivor even with a luck build! ~~yay for a brown toolbox with a spring clamp and cuttwling wire add-ons~~ totems are a bit better, more bloodpoints, counts towards your pip and can take away NOED before it becomes a problem. But that is it.
---
Any killer that would still consider DS a crutch perk post rework needs to take a long hard look at their playstyle.  Survivors with DS in my lobbies are 3 perk players.  I leave hooks to pressure gens and chase my next down.  If someone farms a survivor in front of me I switch targets and focus down the saver and swap bodies.  I don't mindlessly tunnel and intentionally play into that perk. 
---
I agree NOED is the biggest crutch perk left in the game post MoM and Decisive rework but we weren't discussing perks.  We were taking about keys and moris which most would agree are no skill cheese for both sides.  But yeah this conversation will just continue endlessly because neither is going to change the others opinion.
---
Inner Strength is, indeed, OP. I won't be slightly surprised if it gets nerfed soon‚Ñ¢.
---
Maybe not for the killer as they are "the entity's" but proximity chat for the survivors would add a certain level of immersion. The killer should be able to hear it as well so you definitely need to shut up a lot of the time.
---
1 killer needs 4 survivors
---
This is my favorite one yet.  They have all been amazing, but this one would scare the crap out of me in game.  Well done!
---
Legit so dumb. I use this perk in almost every build and I can‚Äôt even remember it XD

Vaas from far cry 3

Thank you.  I like seeing what everyone comes up with for each killer and I will definitely be making more.
---
Bullshit like this is why I stopped playing Feng.
---
"Hey, your Feng is wearing a jacket and a skirt, 1 Ivory mori for you"
---
haha that's hilarious
---
It's so lively unlike other songs which are pretty spooky and get the blood running, but that really helps set it apart and make it quite more unique. Overall great job.
---
What‚Äôs ur name again?üò≠
---
It also does nothing to actually competent survivors. Like if you play every game against ruin, eventually you will almost be able to hit every ruin skill check.  It's literally something that devalues itself the more it's used. It's the same thing with normal skill checks, after hitting skill checks all all match it eventually becomes effortless to grab perfect skill checks which makes gen rushing even easier. They need to replace the skill check mechanic IMO it's absolutely one of the most tedious features of this game. Especially paired with something that's already tedious like healing with a medkit, mending, and removing a Pig Trap. I just wish survivor had better skill expression. It's pretty easy to loop a killer once you understand all the tiles and their combinations.
---
Lmfao
---
Made me ugly laugh. Have an updoot.
---
Aww, that sucks, probably gonna be a while before it returns
---
If I ever find you in a game, I'll happily camp you!

Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll message you now.

High quality meme
---
Pop goes the weasel if you respect pallets enduring if you commit
---
Pop. Top perk. 
---
Which killer?
---
Developed the skills to do so.....bro we hold a button down and occasionally click the other.  Such skillful plays man I've got a stream highlight vid coming up that's going to blow your mind!
---
Yup even with those perks 3 gens is still the norm at those ranks.  If you finished it with 2 or less done you demolished them and honestly ending it with only 3 gens done is still an impressive win.
---
This community understand sarcasm very well :)
---
Lol ty
---
yes please do not play if you plan to cower in a corner. there's a learning curve for everyone, but at least try.
---
Feel the same about DS. Whenever I run it, I never get to use it bc the killer focuses on other survivors, but when I decide to take it off they take me down to tunnel town
---
"competitive balance" in a game where it takes little to no skill to reach the highest rank. 
---
DBD is closer to F13th than a competitive game. Imagine if F13th players talked about "competitiveness'.
---
Rank 1 killers only use nurse and spirit
---
Are you sure it just wasn‚Äôt a bugged game for you that time? When I‚Äôm in swf and if one of our friends had that then they were designated chased survivor lol. Although in solo matches I understand there is no way to tell others unless you just hope they will finish 5 gens without you. Maybe uninstall/reinstall the game.
---
Just watched it on youtube, you work fast my man :D . Another well-made piece of art, keep it up these bring me and many people immense joy.
---
And why is that you think?
---
That's pretty good.
---
&gt; Hunch is just so useless I thought this'd at least relay some damn information to others. I still dont see how it'd be overpowered.
---
It's already getting a really good buff soon. And I don't think your idea would be fair in SWF groups. If survivors want that much knowledge they should run it themselves 
---
&gt; WGTLF definitely changed up than what we are used to, I dont know, I really like the risk-reward-protection trio.
---
The issue with your idea is the BP calculation aspect
---
&gt; I just dislike how rewarding Empathy is, it felt always wrong when it's the main perk of a healer, you can't heal mid-chase, and thats always when you are injured first, it came off as way too strong to me.
---
I've literally never seen anyone call Empathy too strong. that's uh definitely a thought
---
I feel like a buff to it would be to make it sorta like diversion were you get it while in the killers terror radius but not in a chase and you still start with a(n) number of tokens
---
I am actually oddly curious about this aswell now lol
---
Nancy is my #1 favourite stranger things character, which is why I main her :)
---
Bloated kit? Are you trying to say hes op or something
---
Spine Chill is a slept on perk tbh. It's super good.
---
 Iggy just be me, but on Switch I see way more Steve‚Äôs than Nancys
---
True shit but luckily most of the time I'm nearly finished when the killer comes around, so I just finish it and take the hit rather than leave immediately to run away. I nearly always manage to finish it because the killer looks incredibly perplexed that I'm not running for a good second, which gives me just the time I need to get the totem cleansing done. Do I get hit? Yes. But is it worth it? Also yes.
---
&gt;Developed the skills to do so.....bro we hold a button down and occasionally click the other. Such skillful plays man I've got a stream highlight vid coming up that's going to blow your mind!
---
Doing a gen is easy when placed in a vacuum. When placed up against a killer that knows what they're doing, the challenge rises, and thus the survivors in red ranks have, hopefully, played the game enough to understand the basics, understand their enemy and work around them. They've played enough to the point that this is easy. Whether you want to admit it or not, that does take skill. Which is what you fail to understand. 
---
By your logic, absolutely nothing anyone does in dead by daylight requires any skill.
---
Curious to know if people think hag is camping when she teleports back to her triggered traps next to hooks and downs the person as they attempt unhook
---
Uhm I am educated?? I understand that happens when either SWF or nobody else can be found. But I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs still shit for this reason??? Like fuck off telling me to get educated. I‚Äôm calling the system trash in part for this reason. Fuck off pretentious bitch.
---
And survivor aren't? When you play another one you get shited on and treat as a "baby killer" how Can i have fun if when i try the game end in 3 minutes and i'm indulted at the end?
---
The knife is looking real good, how did you make it ?
---
I use tbagging as:
---
* Thank you for healing me
---
* Heal me
---
* Let me heal you
---
* I wanna heal you piece of shit
---
* LEMME HEAL YOU RIGHT FUCKING NOW \*points after tbagging\*
---
* How could you be that stupid (at swfmates)
---
* You're worse than me so tunnel me and camp me 
---
* Ha you suck (at swfmates)
---
* Thank you for letting me escape
---
* FUCK YOU  (If the killer was AFK most of the game or boring to play against)
---
* That was easy (If he was right there as I escaped)
---
* Hello
---
* NO I CAN SAY HELLO MORE
---
* FUCK YOU IM GONNA SAY IT MORE
---
* BITCH YOU WILL NEVER SAY IT MORE
---
* FOR FUCKS SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE I WILL ALWAYS WIN GOD DAMN YOU
---
* \*Come here emote first\* Do you want the item (If it's a good item)
---
It has happened multiple times before. It doesnt matter if i was in swf or solo, it would also happen match after match sometimes. Its really getting annoying, i also have tried reinstalling the game but it doesnt work. Its really getting to me. It might be bugged games but it could just be a bug in general.
---
But why? Other than michael or wall hacks wraith builds, stealth killers are the easiest to beat. And outside of the possibility of playing against them, every other killer has a terror radius and are pretty easy to spot making it useless other that the super small % bonuses it gives. Mid tier imo
---
I need some hatchet throw tips for Huntress because I cannot hit the broad side of a barn with her ranged attack.
---
You could run Comraderie and give a little more time on the hook for gen completion. Those are like struggle points too
---
I think we found a toxic survivor bois
---
&gt;Wow you just furthered proved how fucking toxic you are and a mother fucking cunt ass bitch. :) 
---
Kinda hypocrite
---
&gt;My points still stand.
---
They don't. I countered every single one. I proved them with simple maths and if you want I have several stats from BHVR too. Without even talking about people who do 50 escapes in a row, you just say "but I FEEL this way" which isn't an argument
---
You can only pick yourself up once and it‚Äôs rare for that to actually happen
---
Lose a pip, forfeit all BP for the match, and temp bans are coming with dedicated servers
---
Even if all 4 of y‚Äôall got a skillcheck that‚Äôs only 1/5 of the bar. Plus that‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúyadda yadda‚Äù to the killer getting a 3k at the end.
---
I would just save it, you can get Unbreakable by just leveling up Bill, I would use your shards for cosmetics or perks that you can‚Äôt get because you don‚Äôt have the DLC
---
Iron Will is a Jake perk, right? I think I‚Äôve only got him at level 2, so I‚Äôll need to watch the Shrine or work on his BW for a while.
---
I recommend Monto as well. For each killer video he always explains what perks he‚Äôs using and why as well as the addons. 
---
Lately he does mostly gimmicky stuff though so I‚Äôd say Otz is your best bet as he streams on Twitch as well and usually runs more serious builds, yet still fun ones nonetheless.
---
Ochido? Now that‚Äôs a name I haven‚Äôt heard in a long time...
---
U
---
Ok thanks
---
Isn't Ochido banned?
---
No one will dethrone us Megheads... No one.
---
Dedicated servers makes it even, I believe, or at least its no longer in the favour of the killer.
---
Why thank you.
---
Oh? What's the hunch buff? Neat.
---
I suppose calculation would be an issue yeah. Since it needs to still be active post game in case your leave survivors in the trial.
---
Empathy punishes a killer by doing what they want, giving crucial location info immediaetly to a survivor. I think its intended use could be more knowing where people seeking help are, instead of the killer's location on the spot.
---
Laurie: What r u gonna do, stab me? Oh I‚Äôll definitely gonna STAB you!

It's basically a ouija board that the made to talk to people in the upside down dimension. Hung up holiday lights on a wall with letters under them and told whoever's in the upside down to turn the lights on to spell stuff.

Exact same thing on Switch.
---
Bloated just means there is a lot going on. Bellona from Smite is a good example of a bloated kit. Each ability has a primary effect and also gives her a different weapon. She isn't always meta though.

Bubba is 100% fine.  Bring PWYF.  Don‚Äôt even need add ons.  Surprised so many don‚Äôt understand how PWYF makes Bubba quite playable.
---
Your last statement is again absurd and putting words and context in my mouth that I never thought or uttered.  Are you intentionally doing it to be disingenuous at this point?
---
If you want to talk about skill with survivor play it sure as shit isn't gen simulator that's easy once you're no longer potato.  The skill in playing survivor is being able to handle yourself in a chase and being able to run and mindgame the killer.  That's the bulk of it thought intelligent stealthy saves can demonstrate skill, pulling off well timed saves with flashlights, head ons, pallet drops etc can often demonstrate skill.  Successfully making a play endgame to save a facecamped survivor can easily demonstrate skill.  Juking to lose the killer can demonstrate skill.  
---
Please stop assigning things to my brain and fingers that I myself am not communicating.
---
they're trying to say he has so much stuff in his kit especially compared to other killers, literally every other killer has a simple power that is easy to digest in what it does, his is the only one that has tons of powers in one. Hence why it's bloated
---
Wow! On PS4 it looks nothing like this and of course I‚Äôm gonna get a down vote! BhVR needs to bump up the optimization for us...
---
&gt;Uhm I am educated?? I understand that happens when either SWF or nobody else can be found. But I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs still shit for this reason??? Like fuck off telling me to get educated. I‚Äôm calling the system trash in part for this reason. Fuck off pretentious bitch.
---
They can't make DBD's matchmaking stricter because it leads to longer queue times (longer than they already are) and this ignorant community will also nonstop bitch about not being able to find a match.
---
The fact that SWF is now matched up by the highest ranked player carrying all the rank 20s to play against a rank 10 ~ 1 killer is also something that the community asked for. 
---
You should be targeting your complaints to the people asking for these changes, not the system or the devs. Devs are just listening to the community.
---
Yeah cuz there has been games where I couldn‚Äôt wiggle, heal others/myself, unable to use perks and other game ruining bugs that makes playing not fun. Has it been happening since the Stranger Things update or just overall since you been playing?
---
If you are on a gen and your friend is looking for Ruin it‚Äôs still doing it‚Äôs job. Your gen progress is slowed and if your friend takes 80 seconds to find Ruin that‚Äôs a perk gone instead of a gen. And if the killer is chasing another survivor that means half of survivor team wasn‚Äôt working on gens at the beginning of the match. Ruin doesn‚Äôt need to last 5 minutes to be effective, it needs to last until the killer can apply enough map pressure without it (by hooking survivors) for it to be effective. As long as you get a hook or two before it gets popped then Ruin did it‚Äôs job.
---
Oh for sure man but thats the thing about myers he is so versatile you can play him anyway you want to the only mandatory perk is something t ok slow the early game down to get out of tier 1. 
---
Myers is tons of fun. Like you can legitimately make an arguement for a wide variety of builds on him and i would probably agree its a good build or advise on how to make it good.
---
It was back to back to back skillchecks. Completely crumpled the generator. And there was plenty going on. But the killer found us about 14 seconds after the generator stopped. So instead of finding one of us he found 4 of us. And it slowed the game down, just a little bit.
---
Yeah, and even without being broken from deliverance its really good for hiding mid chase to escape. As long as you dont bring your scratch marks straight to yourself lol pretty sure its his lvl 30 teachable too so you dont have to spend too much on him. Other 2 perks are meh
---
Many survivors find his playstyle dull (I myself do, but only if he is running snares or paintbrush), it just isn't fun to try and loop but freddy decides he can just put some snares and make you run the long side, into the snare and just die.
---
Pretty cool
---
I don‚Äôt think they nerf her ‚Äúall the time.‚Äù  The no RBT activation after gens had to be done because of the end game collapse.  They knew what they were putting into the game.
---
Yeah but I think it‚Äôs better to run a build that allows you to win without the survivors even finishing the gens.
---
Technically its a 10 dollar investment that you would get back on completion. However, its not likely that anyone, even streamers and hardcore gamers, will be able to complete the rift through playtime. You will most likely have to buyout the remaining tiers to complete the rift.
---
I main doctor *because* he supposedly makes people DC. I hardly get any even when I run as annoying of a build as possible on him (Unnerving, Distressing, Overcharge, BBQ/Franklin's/Lightborn/whatever)  and sometimes with a Jigsaw Piece.
---
I used to main Freddy too pre-rework because he felt very similar to Doctor and I did surprisingly well with him even at high ranks. I got tons of DC's with Old Freddy because I guess survivors get pissed once they realize they're going against a Freddy who knows what he's doing. One of my favorite builds was Black Box and Dying Light with a Shroud Of Separation, Swing Chains, Thanatophobia, etc. 
---
Obsession would ragequit and activate Dying Light, and you get 75% slow from being asleep with Swing Chains + another 25% slow from Dying Light, as well as more slow from Jump Rope, Thanatophobia, etc. and the game just slows down to a complete crawl. Time to slow the game down just a lotta bit. Survivors would start DCing because the game is just so slow.
---
This is perfect
---
Ace
---
I flail if the killer is camping.
---
the general meaning of hook flailing is that the killer is close to you so people shouldn't go for a save at that moment. don't know any other codes personally
---
Lets say me n my friend are playing. They get hooked and im injured. The killers somewhat camping and the other 2 are dead. Better to heal myself first than get downed trying to save. 
---
Plus some people like to have fun and dont have boners for gen rushing. Taking a bit longer to conveniently heal yourself wherever n whenever is pretty nice. Id rather be fully healed if the killer randomly pops up than be one hit downed with a surprise hit from a stealth killer.
---
Oh god, hook gymnastics discussion again.
---
As far as I know, most people use attempt/don't attempt to tell the rest of the survivors if the killer is camping. Attempt if they are camping, don't attempt if they have left the hook.
---
Billy
---
That bubba must‚Äôve thought you had speed hacks or something
---
Yes, this is how it works.
---
(Except stupid kids who start to spaming flail nonstop as soon as they was hooked)
---
Guess it‚Äôs a good thing killers can open the gate themselves before hooking
---
From what I've seen the flailing on hook is to signal you're being camped by the killer
---
Billy ruin bbq and bamboozle I don‚Äôt respect
---
Billy ruin bbq and bamboozle
---
Ruin healing when xd
---
If you say you think a perk is OP then compare it to your experience using a truly OP perk, then you are de facto saying it is as strong as MoM. Come the fuck on. don't play this game
---
the biggest reason is for gameplay balance. as it is, having a special terror radius gives the survivors a lot more information faster. think huntress and demogorgon. I'm not saying they shouldn't include more, but it will alter the gameplay SLIGHTLY (if I hear that it's a trapper but still don't see them I'll play different than if I hear it's clown)
---
You can also use their knowledge of the totems location against them. I've had countless matches where I knew they would screw themselves going back for Ruin, and wouldn't you know THEY DID! Hell, I'll hook you right next to Ruin once the jig is up and then patrol the area. It's just too juicy for people not to screw themselves like a moth to a flame sometimes. I feel like a lot of these conversations assume the survivors either don't know where the totem is, or they already cleansed it.
---
Just use top tier killers like billy, spirit, and nurse and you won‚Äôt need ruin.
---
That's usually how it is when you're in a game with me. I like feeding daddy Myers.
---
I run whispers, nurses, BBQ, and monitor on myers almost all the time.
---
Overcharge only applies to one generator and that‚Äôs only if you kick it. It produces a small skillcheck, yes, but only one time, and if missed only does a 5% regression. After that you have to kick the whole generator again. From the start of the match, Overcharge is doing nothing, passively or actively. Plus that skillcheck is very way to hit meaning you could miss the person even hitting it. Even with Surveilance, not only are you using 2 slots for a one time use effect but even if they hit it, if you‚Äôre far away from the generator, why even walk all the way back for a skillcheck that can be easily hit? 
---
Ruin on the other hand works as soon as the game starts and every skillcheck is 5% regression with a 2 sec pause before the gen can be progressed again. And it affects every generator until the totem gets whacked.
---
Yikes, typical SJW because she is a woman and a minority? 
---
Here is your complimentary fedora and neckbeard
---
What game is bill from?
---
That was my assumption too or that there is traps nearby.
---
Open up for Daddy Myers!
---
Ace doesn't have the mental capacity to give a shit about what's important or not lmao
---
Looping isn't toxic.
---
&gt;Please stop assigning things to my brain and fingers that I myself am not communicating.
---
First, I'm not putting words in your mouth. Read what I said "By your logic".
---
Secondly, you're downplaying something because to you its easy. Ignoring the fact that you've played the game enough to make it easy. Which, again, is skill. So yes, following your logic, nothing in dead by daylight takes skill. 
---
For example 
---
&gt;handle yourself in a chase and being able to run and mindgame the killer.
---
I'm not the best player in dbd, and even I can tell you, this is easy. With the amount of infinite loops, windows near each other, perks, not to mention once you learn to 360, etc.. I'm no Noob3, but running a killer isn't that hard. Still, I know that I can say that only after having developed the skill to make it easy.
---
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/d7ww5h/simple_border_stranger_things_perks/) these are the perks if you don't know how to install them you can read how to in this [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/cwbq3a/perkbydaylight_faq_tutorials/) you can't install them if your on console they just work on PC.
---
You should run that on Myers, maybe replace Devour Hope with Iron Maiden, and use infinite EW3. Change your steam name to Exposed.
---
I hatelove this comment
---
Depends on the Killer to be honest.
---
Spirit existing and Billy existing gives off enough pressure, Hell some people dc if the spirit downs someone in thirty seconds without Ruin. 
---
However, Killers that require a lot of time will need to use ruin unless they are extremely good at applying pressure in general.
---
In my opinion however, Ruin is a powerful weapon that can easily be knocked out in the first few minutes of the game. At that point, Corrupt Intervention is much MUCH more powerful than Ruin in my opinion. I play a lot of Ghostface and I rely on some kind of early slowdown to get early stalks on people and early hooks and downs. Ruin just isn‚Äôt reliable because Small Game exists and it gets knocked out instantly but Corrupt Intervention brings Survivors to you, Essentially giving you an early game down, Or a 99% stalk meter for the mid game once you find that person again.
---
I think all of the legion drinks only coffee and eat just bakery sweets, that is why they are so twitchy and run with so much energy to stab stab stab.
---
Nice one, OP. You've got that posture down pat! You thinking of branching out to other killers?
---
Why would they run sabo builds with no way to get up?
---
The relevant part of [this video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/492015122) (starts at 48m40s) covers Demogorgon, has some very good tips.
---
If you don't have any of those perks then at the very least you'll have an understanding of the perk logic and how to use their power. If you're starting out then you can use his portals for fast travel between your basement and your 3-gen - see one of Otz's games [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-qix4OYfzU).
---
Any fine details you need cleared up after watching those clips?
---
Yah okay! What planet are You living on? It was a Mori Fest all day yesterday! Oh I forgot to tell you that we got tunneled, then Moried and the killer would even come from across the map to find me or one of my teammates just to be a dick! Plus camping was here and there along with allot of other toxic bs from killers! 
---
Toxic Strode came out to play after the first hour of bullshit...
---
Edit:PS4 btw
---
No it‚Äôs been happening to me for like a week or two now. It usually happens when I hit a survivor, get stunned by a pallet, hook a survivor, etc.
---
It completely disconnects my Xbox from my  internet even though my phone will still be connected.
---
It's still not OP.
---
god forbid survivors have something to counter sloppy butcher
---
Almost everything is on the PTB now. They had some Tome tiers hidden but they have been revealed (though will be time gated on release).
---
Lore is still not revealed so that'l be a surprise - though titles are available to be seen - i.e. The Alchemist
---
Also, Serum isnt on the Rift but will be when the Hallowed event goes live. It will be on the free track and will be used to earn the seasonal cosmetics.
---
I was just hiding from Demi and it just happened out of nowhere. 
---
Lost my Alex's toolbox and Escape Cake :(
---
Of course, I let them crawl towards it and just as they're about to get a taste of it, I close it in front of their faces. So satisfying!
---
I find it pretty balanced when I use it. I hide in lockers before someone's hooked to save as many tokens as possible.
---
I jump n jack when a Killer IS on me.
---
Enduring then I guess
---
I got decisive in my first Steve web.
---
Ruin and bbq side by side with DC and lag switchers.. really?
---
Bbq that have 6 counters and ruin that get cleansed in seconds. Okay dude üòÇ
---
Really depends on the killer and perks. OhTofu has some good looping guides on their YouTube channel, definitely worth your time.
---
As a survivor player you probably have an edge on mindgaming other survivors, since you know what they have to do in order to loop killers... of course, if you were never very good at looping then your experience probably won't be a huge help.
---
If you can narrow down the killer list, and ideally some perks, I can hopefully give more specific advice.
---
Clown doesn't need ruin, just discordance and sloppy, they'll be down in no time.
---
Mutual feeling
---
I'm not convinced this is 100% true of *all* killers. As of rank reset I've purposefully not been bringing it. Partially to test myself, and partially out of protest about how last month at rank 5 or better the totem kept getting cleansed in under 30 seconds. I've been doing fine, in fact I'm ranking up a little too fast, as it is my goal this month to practice the killers I am unpracticed with, and it's getting harder to practice XD
---
Having been playing more killers like Huntress and Legion this month, I would say your statement is more accurate with regards to killers that need time to get set up like Trapper, Myers, Hag, Demo.
---
I'm legit in shock right now....are you proposing that it requires more skill to repair a gen than to successfully run a killer in a long chase?  Tell me this wasn't the point you were attempting to make.
---
For the most part the gen progression is fine, there are a lot of slowdown perks in the game.
---
I feel you, I have to force myself to play some killer because I have done all the survivor stuff I could do except the adept achievements of the survivors I havent bought yet.
---
But boy do I feel the pressure when going solo against 4 other human beings, and then said human beings get angry at me because I either did poorly or too good...
---
I generally assume a killer who plays like shit the whole game runs NOED. I‚Äôm usually right because surprise surprise, good killers don‚Äôt rely on endgame occurring and would rather a different perk for more situational awareness, or help in chases. 
---
Also I assume it on a Spirit, or if the killer doesn‚Äôt have Ruin.
---
Your art style is gorgeous!
---
No love, but we love your BBQ petk.
---
E N D M E
---
I actually...did not know that at all! No wonder I kept getting lost and scratching my head. This is a great bit of knowledge!
---
Oh it was, I had a good laugh. Shit like that is why I run Stridor
---
0 chase time gen grabs hung three separate players on first pass of map. Two gens pop a second after the third hang. 
---
Not all teams are equal some are just better.
---
If they made it that easy to acquire tokens, they'd have to cap it at three
---
Its annoying to play against. Freddy is just annoying in general to play against, snares, paintbrush, swing chains ect
---
Then I tunnel
---
Tbh I got this a survivor too sometimes. Honestly it‚Äôs all about expectations. Go in with the expectation that you‚Äôre playing for fun and may not win. Odds are you will AT LEAST kill one person which is a success on its own!
---
I hear a lot about pallets and I actually dont think I've dropped one yet...I try to just outrun and loop them but eventually I either make a mistake or it seems like they get faster O: I'll try to do these more often though!
---
Your name hurts me internally
---
God this is so fucking lit, PLEASE BHVR MAKE IT HAPPEN!!
---
And then they leave "-rep tunneling camping tryhard baby killer!" on your steam page
---
1. Play a random Killer or one for a daily. Lowering your expectations from "get a perfect 4k" to "use your special power 4 times" really helps you get out of the mindset that you have to be perfect and back into free play. You'd be surprised how well you can still do in these games, and if you lose, so what?
---
2. Breathe. It helps you focus and it helps you not dwell on setbacks. If a survivor jukes you, so be it. If you keep breathing you can make smarter decisions on what to prioritize doing.
---
3. Play with the survivors. Don't worry about their judgment. You two are there to CREATE an experience for each other. If you are truly reading a survivor, you can have much more fun playing cat and mouse with them.
---
Remember not to forgot your own enjoyment. Play the character you enjoy and relax; rise to the challenges you want to, and turn away from the ones you don't. Just go in with no expectations and make a mess!
---
Yeah, I think Im getting too ahead of myself because I've been diving into a lot of big DBD streamers (EdgarAllanBro, Puppers, Boxghost, etc) and maybe trying too hard to replicate what I see haha. I'll be sure to practice looking around! Thank you!
---
A few people are saying they've had this happen on this map... do you think this might be map specific, OP?  
---
Cuz hooooo, boy. Blood Lodge AKA Looper City is a map that doesn't need a bug like this. -\_-
---
Thank......... you?
---
I'm sorry but my boyfriend and I are fucking wheezing at how stupid you are. You're complaining that moris and keys are op. So do you want killers to not have a chance to do something satisfying? And survivors to have no chance of escaping if they're paired with less than favorable survivors? You realize you sound like a toddler, complaining that you don't get your way? It's called being mature and moving on. You get mori'd? Hey, it sucks, but you still played the game. Survivors escaped you with a key? Well, for one, the requirements to open hatch with a key are more complicated than using a Mori; if all 4 survivors escape with a key through hatch, then perhaps get good. Any other way, you still got at least one kill, so quit complaining.
---
Then I leave "-rep brought coldwind offering while I'm playing Myers so I damn well have the right to tunnel you, plus I didn't even camp bc I brought bbq and chilli for the BP"
---
Survivor empathy?
---
Not in my subreddit
---
Yeah, I got massively downvoted when I commented on a NOED post because I said survivor required no strategy. Though, I suppose that's my fault. I technically insulted survivors on a *NoEd BAd* post, so I should've known I was appealing to entitled brats. 
---
But in all seriousness, survivors just have to run circles around an obstacle, drop the pallet once the killer starts bloodlusting, and then move to the next obstacle. And even then, you don't even have to run around an object very long. I got to rank 7 from rank 13 on rank reset just dropping pallets in chase and vaulting windows until entity blocker kicked in. Difficult role my ass.
---
Not necessarily, the killer usually gets toxic after the survivors destroy him.
---
Get the fuck outta my swamp.
---
This guy keeps coming for people that complain. Ignore him he‚Äôs toxic and people can complain about things killers do without being pretentious bitches about it telling them to just get better.
---
I think maybe when she's phasing she should leave a form of mist in the air, or her husk should start bleeding. It would get rid that of horrible annoying pallet "mindgame" where she just stands still.
---
Yeah throwing pallets is generally not something I do too often, glad to know I was somewhat doing something right haha. My biggest mistake in that regard seems to be throwing the pallet and running, whoops. I'll try out OhTofu's guide :D
---
Did you just re-do your entire comment to avoid explaining how it's OP? lmfao
---
When you start walking away from argument and then they whisper something under their breath
---
Honestly I feel bad for people who have to deal with lag while I‚Äôm killer. Just to get slowed down and hit from like a while away from their hit box
---
Then they go on Reddit and make a post about the toxicity in the community.
---
This‚Äî there are ways to counter it but if you have a shit team it makes it a lot harder. I love when killer mains keep saying it‚Äôs not a problem when they don‚Äôt have to rely on other team members
---
I will say dedicated servers will fix this level of lag if not laggy hits etc
---
Imo WGLF is fine and BBQ is op. Not for the aura reading and not for the BP but simply because it gives both. One should choose between a useful perk or a farming perk. It‚Äôs just stupid NOT to use BBQ&amp;Chili, while it‚Äôs a choice if you use WGLF or not.
---
What killer were you using, if you don't mind? I'm thinking of using Stridor in a PWYF build because it seems fun.
---
Any pvp game is competitive
---
Even chess and checkers. You have to balance towards the best not catering towards newbie, that make the game actually unbalanced
---
Tell me a PVP game that's not competitive. Please I will wait for your answer
---
Oh awesome, I'll check those out! Somebody else mentioned Tofu too so I'll have to be sure and peek. I hadn't considered doing the tutorial again oddly enough, that's a great idea! I got some toolboxes from playing and they have made it a lot easier. Im not the best player but I am having way too much fun to quit!
---
no
---
Pop is a great perk for Billy.
---
I don‚Äôt play bill but I agree, would be nice if you bill mains get some variety, fingers crossed, who knows.
---
Thank you!
---
Baseless insults, says the one who keeps calling me stupid. Get outa here troll.
---
Oh yikes, didn't think about that
---
you have just posted
---
cringe
---
Just hide in a locker if you think the killer use bbq. And equip toolbox or provethyself + bond to push ruin
---
Debatable. Me and majority of friends do, we are all rank 1 to rank 6
---
Hey killers, wanna know a secret? ~~Save the best for last + Infectious Fright.~~  You're welcome.
---
Okay thank you for the help! The feeling has got me to either stop playing the game or not even put it on in the first place so thank you for that.
---
Then that makes it even better!
---
Huntress hatchets move in the weirdest fucking way. I've always found it really counter-intuitive, and it's part of the reason I eventually gave up maining her. They don't arc like you would logically expect a thrown object to do. But they don't go in a perfectly straight line like a typical video game gun, either. Instead, as far as I can tell, they seem to go straight-ish, until near the end of the distance they're going to go, at which point they drop down a little. This is even stranger when you consider that they have no range limit, and will go on forever until they hit something.
---
Basically, try to put the top of your target's head in the middle of the screen. Keep in mind good players will dodge, so you may have to wait then throw. But don't wait too long or you'll lose a lot of distance, or they'll get behind something. When you're new to Huntress, catching them while locked into animations ‚Äì e.g., vaulting, pallet dropping ‚Äì is the easiest way to score hits.
---
That's....how you play hag
---
Never tap.. learn how to hit skillchecks or just go through it. Tapping would just make it slower than missing every skillcheck
---
I mean, I can get away in time so... Am I just superhuman? No... It's just possible.
---
No way Hannah-Barbera or whoever would OK them getting murdered
---
But I have long called for skins based on the Scooby gang for the original 4 survivors
---
Yes then search for more people. If you don‚Äôt find a different person quickly though, it would have been better to continue the chase. I never play killer though except for dailys so it doesn‚Äôt matter much to me.
---
Thank you for the help! I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve never shook this feeling but hopefully I will soon!
---
If the Lion wasn‚Äôt such a pussy, he could Maul Batman/Spirit hybrid to death and we the survivors would finally be able to Mori the killers!!
---
That WGLF change would be pretty awful
---
Thank you! People forget that its a team game...i can hide in Lockers to avoid BBQ all day and just work on the gens with ruin active but if ur team doesn‚Äôt know to handle it.... i mean its not much a single person can do before it goes down hill.
---
I mean, the difference between me calling you stupid and you calling me stupid is that I provided actual reasons for calling you stupid.
---
Meanwhile, you just went "Lol you're stupid" and didn't back it up. But hey, keep it up moron. Maybe you'll prove me wrong by continually saying "no u".
---
XBOX game pass: "am I a joke to you"
---
That‚Äôs me when I reached rank 13, turns out my build doesn‚Äôt work there.
---
The interview was more ass kissing than real questions
---
I was using Spirit with Nurses, Stridor, Discordance and Ruin since I dont have BBQ maxed yet kek
---
I dont use prayer beads tho, unless I see four medkits or some dumb shit like that
---
What if they reworked it to simply just slow the actual progress ? Seems like that would be easier to balance and why people use it anyway
---
Lord forgive me for what I'm bout to do
---
Poor OP killed any karma he got from this post with his downvoted comments.
---
RIP in peace
---
Freddy just does way too much, something minor has to go. And that‚Äôs coming from a killer main that regularly plays him. Depending on the add-ons and perks, he can be completely unfun to play against
---
While Steve looks cool, his perks are terrible. Who tf thought Babysitter would be a good perk?
---
what's the source for the format? it's cracking me up
---
Wow your comment is hated!
---
It's normal
---
A fun change that accomplishes what you're asking would be to 1. Make it so that keys only allow the key holder an escape. 2. allow the hatch to spawn right away.
---
The reason that this is a good secondary objective is that it gives sufficient reward for doing something other than the main objective.  It's an overall selfish thing to do and can make it easier for the killer 3 vs 1.  Allows for a decent amount of strategy (give the key to user on death hook)  Every time I see a secondary objective it's just do more X before you can do gens.  But this is a secondary objective that will slow down the game and reward the survivors who go for hatch instead of gens.
---
I just adjust my mindset from "I must 4k and handle chases perfectly and pressure all the gens"  to something like "im just gonna load in to the game and find some people to throw hatchets at and if they finish all gens in 2 mins then too bad its just a game"
---
All Legion members are 18+
---
I say they don‚Äôt need to slow the game down, just balance killers and survivors so they take equal skill.
---
*sees 3 toolboxes*
---
-Ebony Mori
---
-Prayer beeds Spirit
---
-Ruin, BBQ, HG, ~~and whatever else Prayer beeds Spirit has~~
---
This is not happening and lightweight aren't great  perks. If you don't have any teachables, there's better non-teachables like Resilience, Plunderer's, We'll Make It, etc.
---
the only aspect of him that gets weaker is the gen teleportation, and I guess the add-ons that effect slowdown when asleep, which are already some of, if not, his strongest add-ons if used well.
---
That only gets weaker due to people being dead or gens being done.
---
Rest in peace in peace
---
Biker Kate ü§§
---
&gt; With perks such as barbecue and chili survivors are fucked
---
hahaha oh my god this person is wild
---
The meg ascending from the basement made me howl
---
6-7 is totally fine. I remember when i was waiting like hour and a half.
---
Then you get hooked and they don't save you :D
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
It's perfect.
---
Oh yea I agree it was kinda cringy, I'm just pointing out that SOME info was at least gotten from it.
---
I know right?
---
I had to list every single counter that I had in mind.. to say that bbq is op or that fk survivors instead of just incentives the killer to leave the hook, is just hilarious
---
If Ruin and BBQ are enough to ruin ur game I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you‚Äôre the the kind of person to dc the second you see spirit
---
\*Claps for you\* Again, idk where you missed that this is **My experience for today.** Im speaking on the teams I've gotten **today** can't handle it. Jeez. I see i have to put things in bold for you 2 **Understand** what im saying. Its not a hard concept, like at all.
---
wasn't this on r/The_Fairfield ?
---
I'd pay for this
---
I just used your breathing tip and jeez did it help in my last game! It kept my head clear and helped slow down the adrenaline I usually have! Thanks a lot! üôÇ
---
I dislike NOED as a killer, brings out the fun of a chase. 
---
Then I like it once the exit gates open.
---
I LOVE the indoor maps. Bring on the maze. Even if it means the only way I find anyone is by slamming face first into them in the hallways like it's Scooby Doo
---
Yeah, Huntress gets nothing from NOED and Bubba comes with an instadown, so you're really doing yourself harm by robbing yourself of a better perk for the duration of the match.
---
ScottJund's [Huntress guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRDijaX5Io) is your one-stop shop for being a real threat as Huntress - no joke, I was shocked at my own improvement and how *simple* it was for me to actually improve.
---
Bubba... well, Bubba has problems. If you have Play with Your Food then Bubba is *terrifying*, because 130% movement is nothing to joke about when there's an instadown attached to it. Fungoose's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FiqWTi-Bd4) breaks downs some builds and the logic behind them. Gameplay example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4iVVMOSMhU), towards the end of the video you can see what Bubba looks like on 2 and 3 stacks *with no add-ons on top*.
---
So, weird question.  I used a glass splinter offering to play as the pig when I was playing the huntress.  It used the offering, but i played as huntress.  When my game ended though, it had the pig selected as if i owned the character.  I was able to level her up to level 2 and play as her with a perk.  Now the thing I am wondering is if I had had 1,000,000 bp banked, could i have leveled her up to 35 and gotten her first two teachables without owning her?  I do still have her listed as level 2 now, even though I still don't own her.
---
i will adopt him
---
I was replying to the other person not you. Are you an attention hoe?
---
I know it's your experience of today, my criticism is put bbq and ruin side by side with lag switch and dcers. Which is laughable
---
I had no idea it said Gelatine, thanks for filling the made up word I had in its place.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to Mori with a screwdriver
---
The timeline of seeing hag across the map then being downed by nothing made me howl. Sadly that's another clip
---
That's not your build, that's just you.
---
You get no BP for re-running the tutorial, but it's easy to access and doesn't involve any other players. Personally I use it was a warm-up any time I'm going survivor, I find playing killer makes me a bit twitchy and that's not good when I change to survivor.
---
Learn how to juke and how to loop effectively. If you want to use ds like most people here are saying, make sure you're amazing at skill checks and you can hit them well. And fi ally, learn the counters of all killers. When rank reset hits, make sure you're used to all killers, but out of it, the base killers are most common at low ranks while spirit and nurse are the most common at lower ranks. Remember your strengths as well, don't get yourself stuck in a situation you can't get yourself out of
---
Not enough survivors
---
Why nerf WGLF?
---
Don‚Äôt tunnel  and cleanse totems
---
Mhm I‚Äôll definitely buy a screwdriver
---
Thank you, still getting the hang of this game so any tips help
---
Reminds me of some people who were complaining on another Reddit post that it's too hard to get the "Where did they go?" achievement where 4 people escape through the hatch with a key. I love it how when Killers complain about gens being done too fast they're supposed to apply more pressure and know when to drop the chase but when Survivors complain about gens being done too slowly for the sake of an achievement we're all supposed to just universally agree.
---
Oh boy, finding matches as killer. When it does I get put up against ‚ÄúGGEZ BABY LEGION‚Äù Survive with Friends groups.
---
Now that I checked up your profile I can confirm you're really low rank. That's why you put them in the same bucket.. got it, dw with time you'll be able to hit skillchecks.
---
Eventually
---
It's clearly not actually camping, even if it can have much the same effect. But as has already been pointed out, crouching is a hard counter available to all survivors at all times. They can also be eliminated by flashlights.
---
I'm so done, you're beyond help.
---
I don‚Äôt really get it
---
Clown main can confirm.
---
Well as a game goes on either people die or gens get done. He's probably one of the weakest killers in an endgame scenario. Especially if they have adrenaline making him literally not have a power. Freddy is fine he's just strong at a different time than most other killers.
---
Thancc
---
The hell, I thought he was the "hero" of DBD community or some shit like that
---
Well, I get put up against rank 1‚Äôs. I‚Äôm rank 13. 
---
I hate SWF.
---
I didn‚Äôt say they were completely unjustified (although some were) but they nerfed her like 4 times back to back.
---
This happened to me when I played as ghost face , I just prestiged him and didn‚Äôt have much good addons or perks , I used noed with sbfl and nurses , I did win the game but every time I got stunned they would t bag at me but at the endgame moment I won and they called me a trash noed gamer with no skill and should uninstall , says people with adrenaline with instaheals
---
At the end of the game if you capped all your points the full 32k bp and if all players including yourself have used bloody party streamers and you have bbq or WGlF youre looking at 192k bp I believe
---
That‚Äôs why you should break them totems
---
That sounds like a bug, and very specifically the kind of bug that would carry a harsh penalty. 
---
If it were me, I'd check in with BHVR support and just be very careful not to trigger it again unless they sent me something I could later rely on if/when my account got removed.
---
I just queued up so I‚Äôm gonna go mow my lawn brb afk
---
B O R I S.
---
My meme making skills are as great as my dad is to me
---
I‚Äôm actually glad I‚Äôm not going against Spirit and Billy on repeat.
---
Spirit is totally balanced if you dont run prayer beads . I agree Prayer Beads needs a nerf but Spirits base kit is a far cry from OP, though she is strong. If you have Iron Will you hard counter her unless they're running Stridor
---
I personally would put GhostFace higher, just saying.
---
Because theres an add on that keeps you in tier 1 in exchange for being able to stalk/see survivors through walls
---
Often times, no really everytime i get to sacrifice everyone, i let the fourth survivor go 
---
I even try to find the hatch with him
---
But really if they start blocking me and teabagginnh ... yeah
---
literally none of that makes it OP.
---
maybe
---
*maybe*
---
if the devs reversed the healing nerf you might have a point, but as is **fucking lol**
---
&gt; 8s is insanely fast - So fast you can even use it mid chase if paired up with Q&amp;Q.
---
maybe against killers too dumb to read scratch marks
---
&gt; It ignores all possible negative effects active at the moment - Mangled, Thanatophobia, Cloulrophobia, Dying Light and Madness 3. 
---
again, because of the absurd healing nerf, this is totally fine. especially since it can only be used up to 5 times per trial and up to 4 survivors could be using it
---
&gt; It removes the necessity of wasting other survivors time to heal you - They can immediately resume working on generators while you pull a quick heal in the nearest locker to join them shortly after. 
---
ok? this is not op unless you think something like medkit +WMI is op
---
&gt; It negates the killer any possible information he could obtain with Nurse's Calling - If someone else is healing you, NC gives the killer an information about 2 survivors. If you are self-healing, he knows about your location. 
---
god forbid a stealth killer running nurse's has a counter. what a fucking tragedy. 
---
&gt; When unhooked and paired up with DS, you go free no matter what against M1 killers - Just hop in a locker once unhooked, with DS active and get healed. Afterwards, safely run away even with time still left on your DS.
---
TIL the survivor having the ability to play the game out is OP kek
---
as long as it has limited use, competition with other survs, and the requirement to find and cleanse totems it will never be OP. full stop
---
Super smash brothers, according to the developers themselves lmao
---
You know it ahaha...ha :(
---
Allow yourself to fail. If we go into a game with the pressure of getting a 4k , we tend to get angry or frustrated when we start losing.
---
Instead try to play the game to have fun. If you lose then it's no big deal, you can always play another game or take a break.
---
20 percent, not 40.
---
Oh I get: ‚ÄúGGEZ BABY LEGION! USE HEX NOED AND RUIN NEXT TIME!‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt run hex perks because they‚Äôre too situational and I like survivors to have fun as I stab them with Feral Frenzy to find their friends.
---
Oooo nice!
---
Yup. Just make up whatever excuses you need to run away from the argument you started and lost. Keep it up.
---
Last one didn‚Äôt have a flair
---
If your making this comment i'm assuming you didn't read ANY of my comments before posting this. Lol, its cool tho. Again, its a team game. If my team can't deal, it makes things much much harder. Also,
---
1.) I've never dc'd to any killer i rather take the one pip than 2. 
---
2.) I like the spirit. Lol.
---
Perhaps, but it would still be cool.
---
I find the post and call them out saying they're the toxic one
---
No, because when I use my other builds, on the same killer, it‚Äôs fine.
---
Yep, he should be able to recycle his portals like Hag does.
---
That's what NOED is for lmao
---
\*clam slamming
---
Agree to disagree. Somethin about a baby Meg just sprinting around the outside of the map in a chase while running past 35 pallets just warms my heart.
---
Try all 4 survivors spawning right next to it and bodyblocking you when you show up to find one of them already cleansing it. And then try coping with the fact that this has happened to me more than once.
---
Well he‚Äôs trash, by far the worst killer in the game.
---
Nah I just started so I don't really have friends who are good at the game yet. Didn't know if there was a trick to it or not. When I do it early I seem to miss, most survivors tend to check to see what mode I'm in and play around it.
---
I'm mostly looking from a clothing perspective.
---
That's actually why I don't run Unbreakable, I'm almost never left on the ground.
---
tbh as a Steve main Steve's perks are fucking ass. The only perk that's even remotely worth using is Second Wind and it's so unbelievably buggy it's not worth using just to save a grand total of 30 seconds. (IE two heals from the person who unhooks you, not including perks like We'll Make It.) All of Steve's perks may as well be renamed "gets you killed for trying to use it."
---
Meanwhile Nancy has Inner Strength which is already a solid top tier or at least high tier and Better Together which is a great perk for gen jockies. Also garbage meme perk Fixated but at least Fixated has some baby training potential. (Completely pointless if Survivor mains would play Killer for fucking once but w/e.)
---
okay, fuck you.
---
Aw man, this made me laugh TOO GODDAMN HARD LMAO
---
They play the victim game and say you're the one playing the victim game.
---
Im rank 8 my guy. if thats low then eh ok lol. And i don't see who you replied too. so it looks like your replied to me. And how can u tell im low due to my profile? Thats new lmao.
---
Ash vs Evil Dead
---
"except if you are smart" i forgot i should just dodge the AOE clowns exhaust bottles... silly me
---
Wait in regular games? That's stupid that's like banning all good headphones because they give an advantage
---
Closing hatch doesn't mean you're losing. Tons if survivors DC if you slug for the 4k making hatch the only play.
---
Heck yeah !
---
Wait...is puppers considered good?
---
I highly doubt Doc needs Ruin. Unless you're one of the kinder docs that don't walk around holding shock for easy reveals.
---
Oh that‚Äôs me, rank 16-10 is hell.
---
&gt;["M... Mine should be that 'doot doot doodle do doo' **COUGH COUGH COUGH** you all know how it goes... **cough**"](https://youtu.be/AVCEWxOkc0s?t=290)
---
Jokes aside this is really good and I'd love something like this. I feel custom terror radius adds a lot to the Killer and it honestly makes Myers and Demo far creepier to play against than the other Killers. I'd love if BHVR could retroactively add a custom terror radius to all the Killers, and give new ones to new Killers.
---
~~Maybe we can finally get Hello Zepp for Pig?~~
---
The fact that BBQ, one of the most easily countered fuckin' killer perks in the game, is on this list. SENT MY SIDES INTO ORBIT.
---
I "run away" because you bore me with your assumptions. There's no beating trolls so enjoy my block list.
---
This was NOT a mental image I needed today.

I like how instead of going 'wow, that's a lot -- its pretty funny how that kind of thing adds up if you were to go buy literally everything, huh?' most of the replies here are shills defending the total cost
---
The premise of the calculation is 'how much would it cost to buy everything in DBD that you can only buy with real money?'; not 'wow fuck BHVR how dare they want to make money off of their 20$ game they gave out for free last year'
---
Sometimes the real ace are the friends we make along the way
---
should've done the bones, man
---
And that‚Äôs where it sucks, bbq and chili as well as Freddy‚Äôs and Quentin‚Äôs perks aren‚Äôt available to unlock, we have to wait for them to pop up in the shrine... woohoo. At least we don‚Äôt have to deal with insidious basement bubba
---
Im wondering if this was recent. aka if it is than it was dedicated servers since they have been live for a week now.   But most likely old since that looks like lag switch.
---
Yeah he is a god when it comes to juking. Better than Monto and Noob. He doesnt play killer as much bc he understands what its like to be survivors so he goes easy on survivors and gets only 2 kills, maybe 3 and gives hatch to the last person a few times. He makes it red ranks too still
---
I didn't mean it as ur dumb but hey you take it the way you want to. You ask a questions isn't funny how this is so common but get mad when someone answers why... It's also not really a fun talking point given that a whole 5 people replied!
---
Yep. The people i played with just couldn‚Äôt handle it i suppose ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I want to vomit on people and make them sick whenever i want
---
Someone just reported your 6 day old comment, what
---
Lagswitching isnt common, it just someone with terrible connection
---
You listed one counter... On one killer... And acted like it negated all of OP's statements. Please, try again
---
You take one look at that man and tell me that he doesn‚Äôt just abuse his genitals all day
---
Who put a Steve in my Nancys?!
---
I‚Äôll check that video out; thanks for the rec!
---
I think it works similar to bill in PS4 DBD. Because he's not in the game his perks are available at level 1 for any survivors if they pop up. Since bubba and Freddy aren't in the game I'm pretty sure they'll do the same thing unless they plan to add them later on.
---
Edit: They're not available at all at this current time.
---
Completely agree with this. I really dig the game, but it can get a bit boring especially on the survivor end. New maps (entirely new) would be great too. 
---
Even something like, for the last gen the survivors need to gather certain parts or something would help. I wouldn't want different game modes that could potentially split the player base, but it'd be great to get some new maps that had similar mechanics but were implemented differently.
---
Hey mum, you proud of me? I‚Äôm a cool legion now! 
---
All alone. Against‚ÄôGGEZ BABY LEGION!‚Äô SWF groups who pm me...
---
Bruh did you just play killer in the same game I am??? How tf am I supposed to get better at skill checks if I keep hearing a heartbeat? Like what is this game hide and seek, I did not get gen simulator to just be ruined by some tall meanie
---
The look and flow bothers me.  Corridors aren't fun. Make them wider. The whole upstairs is a pointless waste. Needs a major rework.
---
Whatever you gotta tell yourself.
---
Spirit is op regardless of anal beads or not. I‚Äôm not tryna run iron will every game just to counter her.
---
Pain reliever gang rise up!
---
Theyre hooligans so all im thinkin is that that steal from gas stations and only eat candy, chips and hotdogs
---
I agree with Jane and ash but huntress
---
PTB Ghostface be like
---
But standing up after a chainsaw to the back is all good, got that butterfly tape.
---
I‚Äôm getting ember McClain vibes from this lol
---
Steve is bae
---
Yeah he's a super bae!
---
I really wouldn't waste the Shards....it is VERY rare &amp; situational to be left on the ground.  Best to save it for other Perks imo.  Ive used mine for Decisive Strike and Adrenaline so far and been banking the rest
---
*WAHHHH*
---
Yes, but don't tell me that the games you're downloading are free as you're paying for Plus to get them
---
I mean just because you say something doesnt make it true. Plus Iron Will is good against all killers, not just Spirit
---
Also, Steve, for some reason, has a larger build, but is still just as loud as Nancy.
---
* Laughs in UK *
---
* Realises that it is also illegal here *
---
* Still laughs because I don‚Äôt find them hot *
---
I see good players like Tru3 don‚Äôt use Ruin and instead somehow manage to just instantly find every survivor. I don‚Äôt know how they know where to look.
---
But totems only take 16 seconds and hooking someone takes minimum of about 10 seconds with just wipe hook and pickup animations alone.
---
Surprised the doc‚Äôs swole-ness didn‚Äôt make him higher

---
I guess it really depends what other perks you run with Ruin or Overcharge. I'd personally run both just to make it that more difficult. As well as Unnerving Presence in case they happen to be repairing while I'm near.
---
Your game might be bugged then, mate. Try verifying files?
---
Ruin is overrated.
---
Yeah the tbag does alot but thats coz we dont have any other way to communicate to randoms so we created our own way in doing things - by tbagging, if they added more ways to gesture im sure the tbag wouldnt be used as much as it is to represent certain things
---
I have all other survivor to lvl 40 btw...
---
 + I have enough steam money to get all of them I just need some prioritization advice...
---
UE combo'd with Quick&amp;Quiet have become a staple for me.   
---
I did run into a Myers running All Ears, that was a smidgen too spooky lol.
---
This I agree with. Hes completely dependent on hw9 many portals the survivors decide to cleanse
---
wym Rank reset is when DBD gets fun
---
It is rank reset so
---
I‚Äôm honestly about to switch to corrupt intervention. I had a match today where it literally lasted 20 seconds.
---
Could not agree more.
---
Except you're not allowed to run inner strength or you're just paying to win!!!!1!!1! /S
---
You right
---
Quieter than Kate's?
---
I thought he was holding a lollipop the wrong way. Lol.
---
Steve‚Äôs seem to be toxic loopers and Nancy‚Äôs do a lot of running. Where? Who knows. But she‚Äôs running.
---
survivors that act like dicks makes the game not fun :( 
---
works both ways honestly
---
Taking a sip of coffee while reading this was a bad choice, I just coughed the shit everywhere.
---
I love that people say OoO countering Freddy means nothing. This is not nothing, you literally can't catch a good survivor if he/she can constantly see you on loops, unless there's no pallets left.
---
Btw OoO is bullshit. Have fun playing Trapper or Hag against this stupidity, also have fun playing anyone but Nurse/Spirit against SWF with OoO.
---
At least yours doesn‚Äôt spawn in the middle of a field...
---
Here I was looking forward to the return of the Halloween Flowers. As a killer I loved not having to bring Ruin to slow the game down since everyone became bees lol.
---
Edit: Clarifying. DBD needs additional risk/reward objectives for survivors, OG Hallowed Blight being a good example.
---
Exactly
---
ah you're a man of culture as well
---
There will always be players better than you.
---
Conversely: There will always be players worse than you.
---
Knowing that, "winning" seems a lot more random and arbitrary. Don't worry if the game isn't going well, they may just have more experience than you do right now. Just focus on playing, having fun, and practicing. It's not about the kills, it's about just playing the game.
---
That said, playing as a survivor is super relaxing. Try switching to survivor every few games. It also helps you be a better killer as you'll start thinking like survivors do.
---
Hope that helps.
---
yeah, a hospital gown cosmetic it was leaked recently
---
Ex fuckin zactly ..get good!! How often do u run into swf groups... as a killer u can see everyone every rank items and all jus switch it up. To be able to perform at the best of your killers ability.. like theres loads of perks to use
---
No problem. I asked because I was sick of avoiding playing a game I love just because of a feeling.
---
at this point he's just getting downvoted for being downvoted, it's a reddit bandwagon in full effect
---
Adam is the best there imo, but if your looking for fun Jane bc head on, lithe is a very good exhaustion perk with dance with me n quick n quite
---
Maybe they hate the show
---
Corrupt Purge isn't really fine, that's the exact reason not cleansing is the meta. You get unlimited machine gun hatchets at medium range for a solid 60 seconds, and being stunned out of it is irrelevant as you're not going to but running loops in the way that would get you stunned.
---
I think hitting people with it is as easy as people say, you don't necessarily have to aim in any direction other than "the person will be within 5 meters of this area I spray in" for an effective hit.
---
As it stands now, Corrupt Purge is such a strong ability that people choose to remain one shot rather than risk giving it to her. It's also one of two abilities in the game that have the potential to take down all 4 survivors in a single charge of the power, and it is at a range.
---
I feel the best solution is to give survivors more incentive to cleanse (which would be additional effects of the sickness) while also making it so that cleansing gives Adiris a stronger power, but not a power that is grossly strong. At least that's how I feel, otherwise she would of course benefit from better map design, as most killers would.
---
Judging by your flair, so are you.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for that because it ends up hindering my ability to even play the game.
---
I have all of the perks you mentioned.
---
Babysitter is some kinda insanely like, role playing level altruistic shit hahaha
---
False. You don't need to not have ruin in order to experience this. This is bassicly my every second goddamn game.
---
DS for sure, Lithe would be a close second. The rest are ok but also.. sorta meh. Vigil well.. n/c
---
this is a meme right?
---
What about the perks I don‚Äôt have.
---
Go with feng or Jane, the combo works with both of them
---
You have all the good perks.
---
Alert is alright, Ace is alright for memey chest builds.
---
Any spirit running ruin and noed kind of deserves that, I haven‚Äôt played the game in a while so things might have changed but that has to be the most boring killer/build to go against. Actually puts me to sleep. M1 sim baby!
---
This is very blurry.
---
If you're getting gen rushed constantly, then you're not a good player. Killer was hard in 2016. Killer now has never been easier.
---
Classic, killer mains whining despite having never had it easier. Oh and so sorry for doing gens, I didn't realise I had to wait until you told me it's alright to start doing them.
---
Imagine if survivors complained about quick 4k's as much as you do about gens getting done.
---
The only thing I run as killer that some people don't like is ruin and otherwise i'm never toxic and i always let the last person live 99% of the time and surprise surprise, my games are all extremely pleasant, in game and post game chat. I win most games too. You don't need to be toxic and run shit perks or offerings to have fun, I play the game the way I'd want a killer to play and it works great.
---
Okay so I‚Äôll go Ace first Feng second thank you
---
Personally, at least a 2k is a win to me. I dont care much if the last 2 slip my grasp
---
Wouldn‚Äôt Legion be unable to lift Jane?
---
Source?
---
Dude I swear nobody listens to BHVR anymore they have said hits that don't look like they even happen or connect is a combination is lag and animation-delay
---
In other words, ruin is for killers who, "DoN't ApLlY eNoUgH pReSsUrE"
---
Lol 40 would be op. üòÇ
---
No... no, I'm just that special....
---
Oh wow I misread that so bad.. Uh.. tbh whoever you‚Äôd want to use it doesn‚Äôt matter that much. Since you have DS sky‚Äôs the limit really. Ace is basically a free iron will as he‚Äôs the quietest. Quen and Laurie are really only used by people who use them ‚Äúfor the meme‚Äù I find.
---
More like braindead trapper. But this sub is a killer main paradise, so I guess it's fashionable to rag on the survivors huh?
---
So this ochido guy seems to be quite infamous, what exactly has he done?
---
that has nothing to do with Freddy
---
they only mentioned the Teacher in the interview
---
Oak and mist don‚Äôt stack beyond two purples so they played themselves as well XD
---
No it's Parks and Rec, this was Ron Swanson.
---
Quite possibly more terrifying than the real thing
---
So you can have your opinion and I can't have mine? Ohh sounds kinda fashy
---
I NEED COSMETICS FOR HIM. NOW.
---
Trust me youll be fine. Just turn the game volume up :) in the case ya lose survivors youll be able to hear it
---
Oh man, that's so much fun to play, but so horrible to play against lol, it's downright evil. Probably give it a try after my exams. I also like the Wraith with his addon that makes everyone hear the bell and not know where I am, because bing-bonging a lot makes it so they don't know when I'm after them. It helps a ton with gen grabs lol, partly because lag on PS4 is terrible so they have little time to react if I round a corner.
---
Sometimes I'm the savior and sometimes I'm the scared cat at the corner of the map trying to decide when is the best time to go to open the gates.
---
It's not the first time you cry about ruin.. something that any decent survivor won't say
---
If you use both, you must want the iridescent gatekeeper.
---
MAMA JAAAANE!!! CAN YOU UNHOOK ME PLEASE!?
---
In a v sauce video he says that and pulls out a penny from 2023
---
No shit. It's a joke.
---
&gt; A fun change that accomplishes what you're asking would be to 1. Make it so that keys only allow the key holder an escape. 2. allow the hatch to spawn right away.
---
You gotta be joking. Neither of these are fun changes. This change penalizes both survivors and killers from the get go. Survivors lose a teammate, but still have to finish 5 gens. And killer loses a chance at a hook, because a survivor brought in or found a key. Resulting in a max 3k if he can even catch the others. Not to mention, if this only functioned for keys found in the match, it'd be an utter waste to even add to the game. Since the drop rate for a key of any kind, let alone a key that can unlock the hatch, is quite low.
---
TBH Steves are pretty good at looping too. I tend to get ignored when I start looping as Steve. I'm not even that good at looping but a combination of rank reset and me having Spine Chill (it still increases vault speed guys :p) I can actually loop Killers for a good while.
---
I still get screwed by basic mindgames tho.
---
I feel the same way.  It never occurred back when I was starting out but as I climbed the ranks my anxiety grew.  As a survivor, I know I have 3 other people all working towards the same objective as me.  As a killer, I‚Äôm all alone.  Mistakes will be punishing.  That‚Äôs one big reason I main survivor as of lately, it‚Äôs hard to build the courage to be killer when there‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôll fail and/or get bullied.  Still working on looking past that and trying to enjoy the game for what it is, win or lose.
---
Awwwwh that's cool
---
You were chasing a survivor you couldn't see?
---
As a legion main, I refuse to let fake legions running around.
---
Clown runs on a daily dose of fingers, believe me, I know
---
That was the main thing I liked about F13.
---
Yeah, cuz you can normally hear them. Like, not out in the open I was going around a set of rocks on MacMillan, and I thought the noise was the survivors breathing or rustling.
---
Just get infected with Ebola
---
Especially if the killer tunnels. And I don't mean that "okay that was an unsafe unhook, I'm gonna smack them down before going after someone else" tunneling. I mean true tunneling where they refuse to go after anyone else, tank their DS and run past people doing gens in front of them to get this person killed type of tunneling. Any killer that does that most certainly won't get to my rank unless they run NOED.
---
I've also literally never met a Spirit that runs NOED. She's too good for it to get to endgame unless she plays bad, there's just no way you'll need it. It's like a Spirit that runs Spirit Fury/ Enduring, wtf are you even doing tanking pallets in the first place?
---
I had this twitch steamer complain about my game as Freddy with thanaphobia and sloppy my only two slow down perks and a kid drawing, for bonus point since rank reset,  and a common block and complained to his chat that the game was so slow everyone was injured and nobody was healing in a swf.
---
Gg ez
---
That's why there are official tournaments and well paid too right?
---
Also it's a PVP game. If you COMPETE against another human, that's most likely competitive
---
The devs say it's not competitive? I wanna see that since as far as I know it's a fighting game. The essence of competitive games..
---
Next? "lmao"
---
Wraith for a free bell
---
reddit fuzzes vote numbers, you can't say "I have zero points which means I was downvoted one time literally immediately". reddit purposely messes with the numbers every time you refresh the page to mess with bots.
---
The killer is a demogorgon.
---
And also i dont think its sherd makes up for it because its easy to doge(and takes too long to charge it)
---
Jeff.
---
Lol all you've done is hurl grade school childish insults at me.  If you followed this thread from the beginning you would see that at no point was this me complaining about these two mechanics just to do it.  Literally the entire thread began from a dude clownishly pretending that it takes skill to use either mechanic.  And your defense of both makes it appear that you require said crutches in order to play your games.  That's just sad and you're exactly the type of player both keys and moris were designed for.  You sound like a real winner though.  Glowing, and brilliant personality.  The two of you sound like you deserve one another.

The nurse looks like she‚Äôs hugging her senpai

Escape is not a death

Never heard of him.
---
Youre running, searching for the hatch. "One gen! How could we only get one gen!? ...oh god, oh god!" You scream as they close in, a sharp cold bite in your calf brings you tumbling  down,  feeling the sharp pinch of the snow pricking at your fingers and face, you muster whatever energy you have left to turn and face your fate, and then you see it.
---
Balloon legion.
---
Damn boy she thicc
---
So, I had an idea. What about instead of giving a bonus hooking or healing speed for Rescue on the Way, you leave no scratches
---
This might be the same guy who sent me ‚Äúimagine using noed‚Äù when his team got bummed. Lol. I love these comments. The perks are there. If you don‚Äôt think people should use them, that‚Äôs your problem not mine. I‚Äôll use whatever I think is going to achieve my goals. Idgaf if a survivor or killer thinks it toxic or whatever. I don‚Äôt teabag, I don‚Äôt waste the killer or survivors time and play straight up, but I will never not use a perk I think can help me win because someone THINKS it‚Äôs toxic.
---
BOOOOY
---
I just don‚Äôt get the point of being an asshole like that. You outplayed players who have considerably less game time than you.. that doesn‚Äôt make you god tier you pos
---
You must be a vault, cuz you block me quickly.
---
If it glows it‚Äôs gotta go.

Are the skins releasing around the Halloween event limited to that event or are they available forever?

This clip is from about a week ago, as you can tell by the YouTube video date. This is before the reset. You okay man?

Sucks to suck

Most likely on the 22nd, the day when the PC PTB ends and the Halloween event starts.
---
Lol seriously? Hopefully whatever idiots say that arent in the triple digits, same as DS, since it got balanced its totally fair and not a problem, no respectable killer complains about DS these days, they wanted it nerfed because it was bs and it got nerfed and its still a great perk. They did a pretty good job^^^TM
---
Monstrous shrine is a crutch, CONFIRMED??
---
He was famous for nonstop bm'ing babykillers with his toxic 4 man SWF on comms.  They would derank and primarily do it to newer players.  They'd throw on 4 Purple Flashlights with Instablind addons back when that was a thing along with old DS, Unbreakable, Self Care (before it became shit with the heal speed nerf) and Borrowed Time back when it protected both sides of the unhook or Adrenaline.  Basically they were fully crutched out as crutched could get and on top of nonstop teabags and post game ggez chat BM they'd talk about how trash the killer was for using Ruin and how that should be removed from the game while running the cancer loadouts they did.  He eventually got banned for exploiting himself off the map against killers thus cheating on stream and also instigated a witch hunt against a player he didn't like and encouraged his followers to all mass report them.  There is also speculation though not 100% confirmed that he may have requested nude photos from an underage fan of his.  Basically he was slime. Pure cancer for the game and the community and he created an entire generation of toxic entitled survivor mains who watched his content and thought he was cool.

Susie is hotter than Jane.

but object is bad HERGERG
---
I got to rank 5 using only ruin and bbq. That just shows how fundamentally broken the whole generator system is.
---
Honestly all it will take is to raise the regression rate from stomping on it slightly. Maybe increase time it takes to repair, or change the rate it repairs with more than one person (hell maybe only place these increased gen difficulty mechanics in higher ranks). So many killers would be over half way fixed if all 5 generators couldn't be finished in under 3 minutes
---
Not all TTVs are like this - there is a great group of people who don‚Äôt DC. I think people just get angry when they don‚Äôt get there way. It‚Äôs a personal complex they need to work through.
---
If they‚Äôre operating like last year then they‚Äôll be around forever, you‚Äôll just have the opportunity to earn some for free during the event. I‚Äôm not sure the Nurse one will stick around, as it is part of Archives.

In my other post since ur snooping so much. it said my "Team" if you can read. Kthnx. I don't know how many times I've said in these comments that im fine and know how to deal with ruin. Again TEAM.... TEAM IS THE KEY WORD. Got damn dude. Ur opinion is fine, but im giving you FACTS on my experience today. You ok..?

Then why bother leaving a comment? Lmfao.

I mean yes but he already has empathy so telling him to level Claudette is pointless.
---
My boy Bubba struggles sometimes, and the new map has lots for him to get stuck on unfortunately. The best advice I can give for chasing with the saw is to take corners at a 90 degree angle rather than clinging to debris like you would during a normal chase. It means you lose a little distance, but it massively decreases the chance of a chainsaw collision.
---
Because Killers aren't people, but pathetic loser-creatures who are utterly inferior to me spawned for my amusement and infinite in supply.
---
/s
---
Haha, Entity. You don‚Äôt even fool me. I track with pure sight.
---
No worries, have fun.
---
Honestly at this point don‚Äôt worry about reworking WGLF, id say rework some of the more useless perks (like all of Quentins) to make them into something actually work they using and add a BP boost to some of them. Killers have a few BP boost perks and Survivors only the one. Yea WGLF could use a slight buff so it does more than just the BPs but there‚Äôs also a lot of perks out there that just feel useless +90% of the time
---
Just make it be able to activate as many times as you can keep getting tokens and it'll be fine
---
This looks soo amazing.  I genuinely love this and would like to see more of your work. I know someone already requested it but I would love to see all four of them. (If you can't tell I like Legion :D ) Have you considered drawing anyone else?
---
The purple dress she wears in the show? Its just so ugly lol.

I just only use brown addons and offerings, if any. You're not allowed to be proud of winning against that.

Not that people care, but I care less about them if they're that concieted.

That's mighty passive aggressive of you to say. I can feel the projection.

Super disappointing that he's going to be losing his detection immunity soon, and it'll just be limited to aura reading being disabled.

Since Ash is a licensed survivor you need to use Auric Cells (The premium currency) to get the puppet hand.

It costs 400 Cells. so ¬£3.75

Yes, they both added after the match.

If you got 25k points in the game and used a pudding/streamers and got 4 stacks of BBQ, you will get 75k points for this match.

Nah idc, im shocked someone is petty enough to do that and thank god that perk is getting nerfed

I wish they just changed it to general aultrism healing someone for a stack would be nice
---
Steve's perks are very mediocre but honestly for me it's his goddamn voice. Who on earth thought that the scream sounded good? What the hell kinda soyboi voice is that. Don't get me wrong, if they want to put in an effeminate guy character more power to em, but it does NOT sound like steve at all.  
---
Gets hooked: "MYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
---
Cool, thanks for the reply
---
God i hope you dont, they have spools of tape winding slowly and they make a quick "vrrt" occasionally, it makes you look every time if you use headphones lol
---
To let you know that nobody cares.
---
The fact you went out of the way specifically to blur out the fact you messaged him first, then also upload it on reddit in the hopes strangers can say "Your so right dude!" leads me to believe you probably do not work 40hours a week.
---
People who do generally have better things to do with their time than this.
---
Well shit I‚Äôm gonna have to spend 10 bucks
---
I definitely don't cry about NOED.  It's definitely a crutch perk but I run Small Game to hard counter it against anyone stupid enough to still being that perk into their red rank games. People are more than welcome to run it if they like.  I play to punish it anyways.  It also let's me find their hex totems stupid quick so Small Game FTW.  
---
Got you so you do some respectable stuff irl you're just a massive asshole online.  That other stuff is cool and all but still doesn't make you any less a piece of shit for how you began our interaction and then continued it lol.
---
I try to use mine aswell, but I have like 500 syringes, there is no way I can use them all before the nerf goes live.
---
Oh no, another edgy and unafraid reddit user has me pinned in a corner. I can feel myself care more about what you have to say by the second
---
I came here to comment this and you beat me to it. Take your fucking updoot!
---
I would have BBQ and Chili for those extra blood points.
---
Well its unanimous, Ace.
---
Also, i dont like the joke outfits but this would be great lol.
---
I legit don't even wan't to play right now because of this, no matter what side I'm on, I am bassicly Fucked. Either go for Survival were everyone fast faults and kills themself, or I go for Killer where I get Gen Rushed with Ruin + bad Matchmaking.

This is (Dead by Daylight!)

There are RULES!

Well, either m1 them or turn them into swiss cheese...

I am actually thinking of quitting the sub on my phone main acc anyway, people's values are really messed up and i am really short tempered do i guess sorry about that, i think i might overdid it today

I had a ttv dc when he got downed for the first time. Screwed my team over completely. They seem to be more toxic or entitled than most regular players.
---
Every time I see it mentioned here people love it.
---
Oh fuck. It's sarcasticly repeating itself now
---
lol i tbagged as in saying "hello" like survivors do to each other, didn't knew this subreddit had so many snowflakes that cry over something like tbag like fr?
---
We can call him the Lion King!
---
Wait.
---
Did you DC as Spirit? Cause you sound like a salty Spirit main.
---
The blur is for privacy lol, and the first message is from the killer, but it was deleted by them to try to hide that. Use your eyes fam.
---
Wife called me on the phone.  Apparently she took the girls to the zoo.  While walking to the gate the girls just ran off running.  She panicked because running off is not something they normally do.
---
Apparently they saw this generator off to the side and immediately ran to work on it or the zoo gates wont open...
---
I have never been so proud!
---
so his ability is like old legion...
---
That‚Äôs really good! And pretty horrifying
---
The game punishes Killers for chasing one person for too long. Even if you can't get AWAY, you're being a valuable player just by keeping them occupied, although your team may be too incompetent to capitalize on it at lower ranks.
---
With that in mind, you'll want an exhaustion perk in most cases, as those give you a way to get distance from the Killer, and to use vaults frequently, as they force a Killer to go around the wall or over the vault more slowly (be wary of traps though). Hiding is an underpowered option, since you need to stop running to hide and still make noise without Iron Will, but it's still a possibility.
---
Nah. The first blur is bluring the prior conversation, notice how the next 5 have the game shown :)
---
If you knew how xbox layout was, you would know that.
---
What's going on with Freddy suddenly countering borrowed time? Did he get his kit adjusted or has that been a thing since his rework?
---
So let‚Äôs say I pay 5 dollars right then buy the original ash. Then I buy his puppet for 5 dollars
---
Now that‚Äôs 10. The thing is though is his full Jacksonville outfit is 10 bucks so at this point I‚Äôm paying 15
---
Hahaha I do the same thing when I‚Äôm killer. That slow look to the locker and two footsteps forward.
---
I love how the Nurse has her "I'm working the long ass shift" socks and shoes on.
---
Lol I saw u at 711..

True, I‚Äôm no good at killer so I didn‚Äôt even think about it that way. Be nice if every match was fun for everyone.

I wish Michael would eat my ass ngl üò≠‚úä

I have literally never gone against a single bubba that did not camp

Or just maybe:

ITS BULLSHIT. We do listen to them. The shit they say makes zero fucking sense in terms of hitboxes half the time.

First game searching always takes me a bit and then after I‚Äôm good. Might just be me though
---
I'm a feng main out here because I really love the cosmetics.
---
Every sub I've ever been a part of will downvote someone if they are A) Outright Wrong or B) Talking down on someone/a group of people (especially if they clearly don't fully understand the machinations at play behind their statement.) The guy was fine before his last sentence tbh. 
---
Ruin is only a "crutch" if you fall to pieces without it. If you understand the role it actually fills of being an early game perk, there's a good chance you aren't using it as a crutch, but instead using it to buy yourself time to set up. If you don't feel you need the time to set up, good chance you aren't using Ruin anyway.
---
Edit: If for some reason that logic still sounds like say, "Trapper is using Ruin as a crutch to set up," I would argue its the job of every perk to either save time, or buy more time, so... I really have to ask, do you play without perks?
---
Post your stats bro.
---
Its the new status affect(effect?) oblivious that came out with the demogorgon now since he doesn‚Äôt have a terror radius in the dream world instead it‚Äôs Lalala Lalala borrowed time doesn‚Äôt work
---
It depends on what's hardest for you. Thana is a weak perk, despite Plague getting the most use out of it, and Corrupt Intervention is early game-only, but do you need help chasing or locating Survivors?
---
Although Plague is also just lower-tier, so you may hit her limits soon, anyway.
---
Solo queue is brutal sometimes. Killer mains hate on SWF but it‚Äôs the only way to avoid the RNG of DBDs wonderful matchmaking. I feel your pain.
---
Depends on rank, I get games within a minute as killer at rank 12(Ps4)
---
They are working on dedicated servers, it was supposed to be done by Summer's end, let's hope they deliver.
---
You win the scary pumpkin contest, my dude. This is great
---
not really but it could go well with Iron will, and speed while injured perks perhaps but it‚Äôs really just a meme
---
Yeah it's hard to fit in games with kids in the house.  But hey it's at least a bit cartoony.
---
You and someone else posted 2 screenshots of the same mystery gang lol
---
What add-on?
---
Damn that's pretty funny lol.
---
&gt; zero fucking sense in terms of hitboxes 
---
alright good bye I am pretty much done talkin with people that still think it is hitboxes
---
This happens frequently in my matchs. People look like they are afk but it's just that their game is still loading, sometimes for more than a minute.
---
He was, the janitor caught Julie, she cried and hearing her cries, Frank snapped
---
Oh I see my mistake,I meant Julie not Susie, corrected it
---
Except for Doctor, Hag, and Spirit. They can see themselves.
---
Wait what?
---
Play killer and you‚Äôll understand. Most survivors will complain for the littlest things and expect killers to follow certain ‚Äúrules‚Äù or they‚Äôre toxic.
---
Killer wait times depend on a day and time and obviously region. For survivors, it's always fast.
---
I often play during the night so I have to wait sometimes like 5 or so minutes, sometimes longer. Today I've been playing since 10pm or so and my killer queues were under 10s and it's 1am right now. Friday - weekend is obviously faster.
---
Rank also matters I guess, I'm at 9 atm.
---
This is on PC btw. There's 18k people playing right now according to Steamcharts.
---
I‚Äôm console as well and it can be a huge problem but after reading many comments on reddit about this subject it doesn‚Äôt seem many people like to try to power through ruin no matter what platform they‚Äôre on. I‚Äôve kind of found fun in being the generator role in certain situations like that. I try to look for little ways to make more use of my time. The more I can find the more it adds up. Like for example unhooks, if I‚Äôm doing a gen I will try my best to calculate how much work I can do with my current gen and saving the survivor off of the hook before their second hook phase. This means I‚Äôm mainly taking into account my distance from the hook because I‚Äôve already gotten used to the hook‚Äôs phase times. Half of the time I do this they get unhooked anyways and I can just keep working on the gen.
---
Nice, I could definitely see myself rocking that on Spirit. I've had a lot of love for Discordance these days. I'm curious if they will ever address that fact that notifications every 8 seconds is (arguably) better than a potentially erroneous aura for 12.
---
This is the perks of adopting a demogorgon
---
Game won‚Äôt even load for me right now
---
Franklin's Demise and BBQ make me not regret buying Leatherface. FD is my only defense against four item survivor teams.
---
Running without ruin is the whole point of this thread tho my dude. You don't run ruin, gg.
---
Debatable
---
Spirit is actually Helen Keller?
---
It just creates really bad habits for a lot of newer/uninformed survivors.
---
Halloween Julie &gt; susie &gt; Jane &gt; Kate &gt; everybody else

---
Honestly thought this was an E.T. cosplay.
---
At the time of you posting this Xbox live is down, so no matches.
---
Can confirm, killer main here. I exist only to be abused. In the event that I do well against you, it was only because I played unfairly and deserve all the salt in Utah a thousand times over.
---
If your profile name is fuck, you can and will get banned its a matter of time, steam will pick it up and you will kose your games dude, its in the terms and conditions
---
Support the devs and get that puppet.
---
Demo would also be on top
---
Rank definitely matters
---
No, all point offerings are added after the match.
---
Buffing speeds with the likes of This is not Happening &amp; Resilience are good choices, as making an anti-slugging build with No Mither usually never works because the killer knows from the start you're running it, then maybe Dead Hard for when you are found.
---
However unless you're very confident in looping and evading the killers notice, it will never be a great perk to run, and it also depends on what killer you're up against, off the top of my head, NM is most viable against Plague, as it completely nulls her power since cleansing for you is pointless (but the other survivors it is less so unless you all run the same build).
---
Good stuff! I'm gonna forever be upset that this isnt the Clowns TR music.
---
Yeah. They're spreading the demogorgon Undetectable status to all stealth killers, and removing their unique stealth styles with the next patch. T1 Michael will behave exactly like a Demo that just left a portal after that, which means premonition and spine chill will work against him.
---
You sure it wasn't actually hope?
---
It happens.  Big part of why I'm a killer main now.
---
Struggling on the hook. NEver. Ever struggle. Unless you are certain no rescue is coming. What happens 96% of the time is you just go from first phase to second phase with no good result, for nothing.
---
I hate it on one part but like it the next
---
Tons of ttvs are super toxic and dc that‚Äôs why I started bringing Moris for them if they‚Äôre gonna dc no matter what might as well make it entertaining :)
---
oh fuck
---
I brought up end game, you brought up slugging for a 4k and closing the hatch.
---
I dont include the .TTV in my user name, and its hilarious to encounter other streamers who act like absolute garbage people.
---
I was boutta say that
---
I'm laughing at how useless your arguments are. You were the one that came on this post, crying about how keys and Moris are unfair. First off, that's seriously just the saddest thing that one can do; they're in the game for a reason. A key counters a Mori, Mori counters half the shit in the game. Cry about it bubby. Second, you start going full salt Lord because I told you to shut up- which I'm sure multiple people were thinking. You say I'm a massive asshole and a piece of shit but if anything, you are. You went crazy on me, said all I had was elementary level insults when I had only insulted you once at that point, which, if anything, "limp dick virgin bastard" has been a meme on Reddit for years, so it's on you for taking it so seriously. Grow a pair, and stop getting so bootytickled.
---
I never run ruin on Billy because it's 2 ez after that but any m1 killer I'm running either Ruin or Corrupt Intervention

I play both sides and it‚Äôs very overwhelming with a full coordinated swf but at the same time I want to use my instas on survivor as well... same thing happened before the bnp change everyone was using them to get rid of them and it makes it very difficult as a killer when it‚Äôs every game
---
I play both actually. There is no salt when it comes to the perks because i have them myself. Again reading is fundamental. I said team multiple times lol. But hay, believe what you want ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
Thank you pumpkin, very cool
---
Tapp was! But Dwight was the one getting a head pop.
---
yea, it's just that 90% of the time he's more focused on having fun with his chat and memeing around, from what I can tell when he plays a SWF he also just goofs around with the guys drunk.
---
The few times I've seen him play "seriously" he effortlessly can run most killers for several gens and play really efficiently.
---
"YO MIKEY CHILL, CHILL!"
---
This is about every game I play against spirit: 
---
One survivor DCs as soon as they see the killer
---
The second DCs as soon as they get hit by the killer
---
The third tries to stay in the game to not piss off their last teammate but DCs when they get hooked
---
And I hope the spirit will give me the hatch but they don‚Äôt because they think that if they don‚Äôt get a kill it‚Äôs a waste of everybody‚Äôs time.
---
And at some point haunted grounds got popped.
---
 So how am I suppose to rank up if I cant find a game in 30 minutes? 
---
On PC in NA during prime hours.
---
But Jeff has nothing to do with this!
---
For some reason my ranks didn't reset. I stayed at rank 7/6. Now I'm getting matched with players "at my rank" which are the rank 1/2 players that just got reset.
---
I'm assuming it stacks with making you less likely to be the obsession but we don't have anything else that makes it less likely, unless they mean stacks with perks that make it likely that you are the obsession and evens out.
---
Wholesome as fuck man, take my upvote

The only time the game doesn‚Äôt feel stale for me is when we get really good maps like haddonfield or the game that change the mind games up a bit. In b4 the game isn‚Äôt a good map. Imo it‚Äôs one of the better maps because it makes the game feel less stale.
---
...w-what? 
---
Who do you think i am? Im not complaining wtf
---
Otzcheats.com strikes again !
---
Sometimes you throw a hatchet across the map and down someone and sometimes you throw a hatchet that phases through a survivors body. its a lifestyle
---
It's still pretty bs how rancor works, have a free kill if you let all the gens get completed.
---
It should give the obsession vision of the killer's aura after all gens are done as a trade-off. They can instakill you if they find and down you, but you have an easier time avoiding them.
---
I know it‚Äôs just super sad to see, leaves a bitter taste in my mouth after a hard fought game
---
YES!
---
Billy is most likely because the reason nurse got nerfed was because she didn‚Äôt have ultra rare add-ons. He doesn‚Äôt either so I assume he will as long as he‚Äôs in the top 3
---
Oh i dont have any other cosmetic in mind, I'd be surprised.
---
‚ÄúUnique Wedding Ring‚Äù Add-on

It's called Rank Reset
---
Was thinking about buying dbd on switch can anyone who owns the game give me feedback on how it handles in handheld and if the player base is big enough to support it from your experience. Thanks
---
Survivors get buffs in their perks all the time
---
i used to get killer anxiety before, i dont have a lot to bring up to this topic but heres a little advice
---
if you lose as a killer, thats okay, you can learn from your mistakes and improve as a killer
---
Also being trapped by the twin in the locker for 3 seconds as the locker twin grabs a hold of the survivor.
---
My favorite Rancor moment is still phasing behind a teabagging obsession and mori-ing him in the exit gate. When keeping it real goes wrong..
---
Underrated opinion/perk.
---
Ever since I started running sprint burst, and wearing dark clothes. My chances of getting tunneled have dramatically dropped. I don't use decisve. 
---
By the time the killer comes back to hook I'm half way across the map when getting unhooked. Also, RUN IRON WILL! 
---
my anti tunnel combo is lightweight, sprint burst, iron will. I really hate getting tunneled, and most killers will take advantage of u. I use to get tunneled back to back every game, and it was rage inducing. 
---
Also I'm sure you already use spine chill. Give my advice a try.
---
I know. I said it twice if you actually read it.
---
No problem :)
---
So because Susie is the only one he forced its okay!?
---
Ok, sure since you're this stupid.

Meaning of 'Competitive" since you don't have any idea what it means
---
http://changingminds.org/disciplines/game_design/types_game/games_competitive.htm
---
It took me 1min to find these sources. Please give me a real example, you're just embarrassing yourself now
---
Btw party game and be competitive aren't mutually exclusive! Plus by your logic if one dev of Tekken said it's not competitive, means it's not competitive no matter the evidence
---
You can't be this dumb to believe it right?
---
&gt;All of their official tournaments have no monetary prize
---
Do you know what EVO is right? If not, Google it and don't spread lies
---
But how would it work on the absolute chunky unit that is him as an adult
---
Force? Maybe you shouldn't put forth such a change if it's something people have to be forced into. This type of game isn't ideal for casual. What exactly is supposed to be the benefit for casual when all the good and worthwhile stuff comes from ranked?
---
I just read something about Live being a little screwy. So it‚Äôs not the game just Xbox.
---
I'll definitely have to give sprint burst another shot. And iron will hasn't been something I've used in a year or so lol. Definitely gonna try that out
---
I think if 2 people have the add-on, maybe the chances stack. So the chance of not being the obsession is doubled. This could be completely Wrong though.
---
I could probably make one out of another pumpkin. I love it
---
As Freddy when I put down a dream snare, it seems to place where ever I'm looking when the meter is full. Yet I've seen streamers where the snare is placed where ever they were looking when they started the meter. Am I on crack or is there something else going on?
---
you only get the auric cells from the premium path so if you max it you won't be profiting
---
Being exposed always gives a warning somehow - vs Myers, Ghostface and Haunted Ground you'll always be warned when the Exposed conditions are met. However, Devour Hope at 3 stacks and NOED won't warn survivors they are Exposed until someone is hit. Seeing as powers don't trigger NOED, you won't be warned.

Lmfao your responses are top notch dude
---
I think its fine
---
That‚Äôs even better! Shame I didn‚Äôt think of it lol
---
They cant put kids in. They already said during stranger things
---
Whatever you want dude. I'm done with you
---
After all your posts are pretty much the same. Crying about ruin. Bye, you can have the last word if you want
---
Speaking to the OP and adding on to your post, my friend. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Oh lord they coming
---
I still have no idea they have never done like a 3 day event of 2 killers with 8 survivors and like 8 gens to do. Even if it was an unbalanced clusterfuck, it would be refreshing to mess around with for a weekend.
---
Yup it's a challenge just trying to start a fucking game on XboxOne let alone play it..
---
You're the one who prolonged the game
---
Fixated, lightweight, iron will, dance with me, (and no mither with iron will if your so scared of stridor)
---
Really the biggest change was her add-on rework. The charge change also gives a few more numbers to work with to balance her power further in the future.
---
who the fuck thinks of slugging for a 4k and closing the hatch with 1 last survivor when they say end game. You clearly know what I meant when I said end game.
---
that was a horrible take
---
Can attest, Sneaky Myers is godly. I‚Äôve had survivors tell me I legit scared them post game, and I rarely get salt. Buuuut with the recent changes adding Undetectable to T1 evil, you have 0 terror radius by default, so Monitor would be a wasted slot. I usually run Play with your food, Make your choice, Ruin, and BBQ. Feel free to swap anything but PWYF for either save the best for last, or Bamboozle if you want a bit more viability for chasing, but ideally you don‚Äôt DO chases lol, you get oneshots from unhooks or gen grabs.
---
It's called rank reset bud
---
Ah yes, imagine a ghosty and a myers for absolute *S T A L K M A N I A*
---
This is basically Wraith's power but instead of going invisible and nothing more, you can crouch and nothing more. Nothing to laugh about.
---
Who ya gonna call
---
It‚Äôs not okay but you blurred the name, could you message me the twitch channel of them? I‚Äôd like to see how good they are lol. 
---
Also I‚Äôm just generally looking for new streams to watch for Dbd üòä
---
You dont, go cleanse totems and loot chests for extra points. Good luck in the fog.
---
Made it sound nicer happy
---
 Very nice.
---
No shit bud. Learn to read bud.
---
I cant even get the game to boot lol.
---
Xbox Live took a crap for like 30-40 mins and it is recovering right now, so it should be back up soon.
---
Yeah, error 8001 only on this game. Everything else is fine
---
Nice shot
---
Can we just appreciate how ~~sexy~~ buff Michael is?
---
There's nothing funny about the Clown's unhealthy eating habits
---
tit for tat
---
It's pretty hard make me laugh, but this.. this is gold my dude
---
I mean that's a bold assumption given that I was averaging 4k without ruin at rank 1 last week, but that wouldn't really bother me because I'm sure I beat you in every other aspect of life regardless ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Unless you look good, have a good social life, good gpa, a five digit bank account at a young age, and squat 550 too, of course. I mean, Lord knows I'm already beating you in the whole neurotypical department since you dress up like a mouse or something
---
Yes, make him a child
---
Legion is still cancer tho
---
Almost every time ruin is ran I never find it, I swear I search asylum for 2 fking years again and again but can't. By ttat time I'm last survivor anyways.
---
Sexy Michael is sexy mhm
---
Should I buy spirit?
---
You can swap discordance with infectious fright, then run blessed apple, they wont cleanse and if you m1 the obsession you can slug them and get corrupt purge and go check a gen nearby, you will sneak right up on groups of them at times and hose them down because 0 terror radius, if no one is there you will most likely find some scratch marks around the downed obsession and get down them and hook the obsession, if they manage to get them off the ground you can hose them both down again anyway.
---
And with infectious fright + blessed apple you should be able to pressure them into cleansing by using the 1 corrupt pool and downing someone, youbwill get a scream from nearby people  of you get 2 or 3 down the pressure is on and they will begin the cleanse because despite them not cleansing you got corrupt anyway.
---
Otzdarva is an extremely skilled killer main and a very nice dude, probably one of my favorite dbd content creators at the moment. I also like Demi, a more memey content creator who's pretty funny.
---
Maybe universal. Even for killers.
---
If you have any opinions you have to deal with ‚Äúsalt‚Äù on any platform brother
---
Exactly, honestly don't be afraid to get downvoted, that just shows you might not be right or not with popular opinion, that or that one insta normie that immigrated to reddit
---
I just realized I told you about good content creators instead of the bad ones. Sorry
---
But Jeff's D U M M Y T H I C C
---
I'm a survivor main genius
---
Again you didn't read the thread from the beginning.  A user claimed it requires skill to use moris and keys.  Every argument I presented was simply pointing out the absurdity in that claim.  The overwhelming majority of the community would agree that neither is seen as a skillful mechanic for their respective side.
---
I went crazy on you?  Reread your first two comments to me unsolicited by the way we weren't even talking to each other prior.  It is nothing but fucks and insults.  You don't get to ride a high horse on this one.  You conducted yourself like a typical garden variety internet troll.  You're not special.  It was quite the unremarkable exchange really.  This is getting pointless at this point though so I'll leave you to your next thread.  I'm sure you have more users to launch into expletitive filled tirades with.
---
As a hillbilly/Michael main I just M1 and chainsaw when I can...it‚Äôs hard to press M1 as billy but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and risk getting called trash for the 4K...or just use the chainsaw and miss everyone but die a hero

This is stupid.

This made me smile. Thank you
---
If you wanna split hairs that bad, then technically nothing is free. I bought the console, the internet, the electricity that runs it and the house I‚Äôm playing it all in too. 
---
It‚Äôs not technically free. What it is, though is a small investment to play anywhere between 1-24 games a year for as long as I want. The more games I download, the more I invested in however the value per game is only a personal level and to me, like many other people, got this game as part of an investment and fell the value of the game itself was worth the investment, thus putting the price of the game at 0.00. 
---
You can be technically correct, however when personal value of a non-tangible object is the subject, it‚Äôs not as simple.
---
I met my partner in ESO! Love all these online love stories :D
---
Well I mean it is just a stupid joke
---
Ehhh idk.. more tokens might make it too strong and abusable with OoO. You can already kinda abuse it with it, imagine been also able to use it even more often while denying any downside using it
---
I love the perk but idk about adding charges right away. Maybe make you gain one charge but should not be easy for the same reasons I said before.
---
Idk, every 2/3 saves you get a token or every time you win a chase while injured would be an idea, maybe
---
You‚Äôre not alone! It‚Äôs crapped out right now.
---
Personally I think this game needs new mechanics, something that makes survivors work more and take more risks.
---
I once read a suggestion that said that gens would overheat if a survivor works on it for too much time in a row, or if many survivors repair it at once. I think that would be an interesting mechanic.
---
Or maybe even place the door switches on random spots so survivors have to find them. As a survivor player I think those mechanics would add more action to the game, while as a killer player it would give more time to kill people.
---
Deerstalker would work as well.
---
Ash's father would be proud
---
Yeah the streamer just seems toxic as fuck and I‚Äôd just move on from it.
---
Devs should remove the black underwear UwU OwO
---
Unpopular opinion but I actually don‚Äôt want this or ‚ÄúShIrTlEsS mYeRs‚Äù I want bed sheet Myers!

You're the one spreading lies, mate. Nintendo does not, and has never formally sponsored Smash at EVO. None of the players who play at EVO are under contract with Nintendo, and the prize money does not come from Nintendo, it comes from EVO, a private company who sponsors the tournament themselves.
---
Of course Nintendo isnt going to *disallow* Smash from being played at EVO. Sponsored or not, EVO is free advertising for their game. Just because a tournament is big does not make it officially sanctioned by the company that created said game. If Nintendo wanted they could stop Smash from being in EVO completely, but they wont because, as stated prior, it's free advertising.
---
The only "official" nintendo sponsored smash tournaments are their online tournaments or tournaments at their games conferences or offices, none of which have monetary prizes.
---
A good hag is hard to counter tbh so I'd level her. Most perks that are great for her imho are ruin, monitor and abuse, noed or make your choice, nurses calling. She's got a mega small radius with m&amp;a, easy to sometimes snatch people from gens or sneak up close enough for a hit. Your 'web' is what makes you win games, always, always placing your traps in areas survivors run, or in a loop are in your favour, only down thing is she isn't so fast so if you've got a survivor that's pre far from you go find another. :) hag is really just about prediction and mind games, your attatchements can really help in ways, like a body blocking build or silent sneaky hag. Perks are what you should focus on for her as having only totem ones can be difficult for you against good survivors, once they're all gone she's basically vanilla. Over all, I think with the right stuff she's a really fun killer, and it's definitely worth learning/leveling her if you're willing to spend the time and bps. :)
---
The way it works is. Do everything you can in that match to try and double pip. Cause the ratio of survivor to killer is 4 to 1. So itll take long espeacially since survivors rank up quicker. So you have to try to double pip each match to keep up ya know?
---
I agree with the recycle portals a la hag, and they should let him travel without being on a portal a la Freddy. As it stands his portals take too much planning and set up, obsolete after the gen is done, and a cumbersome to use.
