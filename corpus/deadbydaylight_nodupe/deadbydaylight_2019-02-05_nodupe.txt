J wish this was the case. It is so easy to rank up, the only way you won't get to rank 1 is if you don't know basic knowledge of being the killer. You can pip without even killing anyone 
---
They can't. Even without that button, all you have to do is close the game out. There's no way to prevent it from happening. 
---
Seems so. I've heard people say he's OP, I've seen people say he's worse than Freddy. I'm fairly sure people were super salty at the Nurse when she was released too.
---
What? I get tons of messages on console.

Whaaaat??? Hey dude are you still there or did it actually work? IM A FUCKING WINNER 
---
I play on PS4 because it was offered as a free PS Plus game. I agree with the game being inferior to the PC version, pass or no pass. 
---
Despite the bugs, I love the gameplay loop and have lots of fun. Also there aren't many any other games to scratch the niche itch DbD does on the PS4.
---
I play PS4 
---
You know you're a survivor main if you want stuns to heal you a health state. That might be the absolute dumbest shit I've heard all week.
---
At red ranks on PC survivor, they are sweaty. Like, flooded sweaty.
---
I run slopppy butcher and Bloodhound because I like the pretty colours.
---
False saws will be the death of me 
---
Oh ok thank you hahah 
---
Did you try Survive with Friends? invite them to a SwF lobby then search for a game.
---
If I can be bisexual I can be bi-mained ok. But probably clown because I love the way he can stop loops.
---
Sorry I'm not sucking dick for inadequacy, my bad
---
"No03"
---
And why the hell do you have your messages open?
---
Why is No0b3 in the same category as Ochido?
---
Haha
---
Lol yay for useless data
---
For sure. He's kind of a dick but he's got great content for this
---
I play on PS4 because 1) I don't have a good gaming PC and 2) All my friends are on PS4
---
Better than my xbox
---
I feel like I'm the john connor of xbox dbd
---
If you're reading this, you're the resistance
---
Spirit is really fun, but not as fun as the clown in my opinion. Once you get used to throwing bottles, you can really mess with people. I highly recommend the clown.
---
I play Legion and I let all the survs escape if someone dcs unless its a waste of time or they  all dcd on last hook
---
That’s what I’m doing. And there is only one way to play with friend or am I wrong ? Should we open some port or I don’t know to help connect with the killer ?
---
I’m very tired with this bug. I invite my friend, searching for lobby then boom I come in the lobby with 1 or 2 other people and my friend have « disconnected from host»
---
Then again he get in the lobby with 2 other people and I have « disconnected from host » ...
---
I don’t know what to do, any help please ?
---
I got 5 coins within 2 day now i dont want any item so i stopped grinding.
---
That's my point. Freddy's backstory in Part 6 isn't the same as Wes Craven wrote Freddy to be in Part 1.
---
as i replied to so many others I know. Im mainly just salty
---
[removed]
---
I wish I at least knew, I didn't play differently than any other day.
---
It's annoying ya and sometimes unjustified, but you gotta keep in mind the other players are only human. Dealing with Iri Hatchets, Frank's Tape, Tombstone, Omega Blink, InstaSaw, Tunneling/Camping killers with NoED is only fun so many times a night and sometimes you're the unlucky killer that tilted them to the edge and they left for their own sanity.
---
On the opposite side dealing with swf, insta-heal, flashlight spamming survivors is draining so sometimes the killer leaves for their own sanity too. 
---
We all just want to have fun matches, win or lose. I don't blame anyone if they DC. Its annoying, but I know there was a reason.
---
I think I'm a rank 16 killer and I'm frequently getting put into matches with people in the top ten. I was 19 when I versed rank 3&amp;6s, somehow won. Really depends on the survivors, though.
---
It's really unbalanced recently, sorry it hasn't been kind to you.
---
My cat (Gucci) fucking hates them.

Nurse- Best because high skill cap rewards heavily.
---
Hillbilly- Who needs skill?
---
If I am running leader at the time and they have than I will let a teammate heal me to get than lowered but yeah legion is just annoying I have also been running prove thyself
---
gods work... thats what you have done...
---
And Whispers and Spies give you information about the map state that BBQ doesn't. They're different. BBQ is not best in all situations, or for all killers personal playstyles. I don't find BBQ necessary on Hag or a number of other killers because their playstyles don't mesh well with the type of info BBQ gives
---
Demi when 2.1.0 dropped
---
That's because the host leaves the lobby, thats known as "dodging", when the killer doesn't want to play against the survivors that they are paired up against.
---
Yeah, for Discordance you have to get lucky. 
---
On their official forums, I think there’s a way to make a report. 
---
Because i'm not going to turn them off just because of one game
---
Asian or Hispanic. Either one works 
---
I didn't knew that she could do that. I faced one today that was pretty damn good.
---
Not like, "insta down" good but more of "360 headshot no-scope" good. 
---
I think the lunge has a lil aim assist with it
---
I actually came back to DbD last night after quite a hiatus. My first 3 matches as a survivor ended with the killer dcing.  After awhile I decided to play killer. In most of my matches I had at least 2 survivors DC.  (One while I was mori'ing them) =(. 
---
Not much has changed. Got three coins for my huntress outfit and logged off. Maybe it'll simmer down after the event 
---
If the killer leaves why my friend and I are not disconnected at the same time but only him or me??
---
Yeah, I'm pretty much always hearing her humming, up to the point that the tone gets stuck in my head. 
---
I respect your right to play Legion and enjoy yourself but I also reserve the right to call you a butthead for playing Legion
---
Still a game lmao
---
Howdy
---
Whispers and Spies aren't the same as BBQ, i'm not sure why you keep comparing them. 
---
I honestly don't care what perks you use, but BBQ is objectively the strongest killer perk on any killer in the game, maybe only second to Ruin (but Ruin can be destroyed).
---
I'm not saying you have to use it on every build, I don't, but to say that it's only strong on fast killers is completely incorrect. 
---
This would make every survivor cream
---
dont get too discouraged by toxic players, this game is almost entirely a cesspool of toxic players and its almost impossible not to set them off, the thing is. play the game how you want, i cant support dick moves like face camping but normal camping is perfectly fine if they wont stop rushing the hooked guy, dont play for them. play for yourself
---
I actually like the Wraith! I think that the ability to sneak up to the survivors is preeeeetty good. 
---
"legion main"
---
That's your decision
---
&gt;I just feel like as killer all you need to do is get in range and lunge
---
Would you rather us have to be close enough to lick them
---
suck on them toes sister killer
---
One time i almost gave the last player of a match the hatch. it was a new survivor, new to the fog.... I may or may not have moried them... Is that toxic or is it breaking in a newbie?
---
You should try out paragon when it comes back out it's the one moba I like and it's really fun but that's just my opinion hope you agree if you do try it out
---
Awesome, thanks for the info! 
---
Again making shit up. I did not say that. Keep crying and lying kid. You can't even get past rank 20. 
---
Its been 3 hours i think hes actually gone lmfao I  never fucking lose
---
Cause its Suzie not Susie
---
So fucking accurate, people complaining about legion, but billy can have an easy easy instadown with no movement speed penality on his base form, ridiculus, bubba is how billy had to be for balance.
---
Bro you're not the meta master
---
You have recover in triangle? O.o 
---
If you get your tier 3 ds, it vanishes. Do it for your sanity
---
I don't think ur still here but ill be hack tomorrow to assure dominance you fucking loser LOL Im so fucking Amazing 😂 i literally made another human shut the fuck up is there anything i cant do? 😂  
---
Literally had that happen the other night. 
---
I love this outfit, but my internet is fucked this week. oof.
---
I love playing clown and Doc, those cackles!
---
So you would rather killers not be able to lunge around objects? 
---
A killer that could burrow underground, a killer that uses a whip as a weapon, a killer that conjures ghosts
---
Feels bad man 
---
They are though. Pratically every Jason has the same playstyle, the only differences between them are "but this one recharges x skill faster!" "but this one hit harder!"
---
I mean her name is actually Lisa, in'it.
---
I mean how much of a decrease are we talking? Like Wraith needs to dial it back with whole Usain Bolt thing otherwise most killer lunges are fine. I would rather not have to get right up on survivors to do a regular slap though.
---
Pipping every game no matter if you die sounds good to me.
---
somehow the good killers stay on rank1
---
Thus happened to me like three months ago only once. Killer dc'ed, didnt know it was still there.
---
I will not give in
---
There’s a stark difference between hacking (legitimately going against the EULA) and playing a character that was added to the game intentionally, you may not like either but but one is bannable the other isn’t, I hope your 2 brain cells can tell which one that is.
---
W R O N G
---
-This comment was made by Bubba Gang
---
I have a question, is there any way to tell when being hooked if the killer has BBQ and chilli? One of my friends suggested the flames that appear around you when hooked but it seems to not be the case. Any ideas?
---
I don't think he means amount of Killers, I think he means how iconic they are. And Jason's probably up there in the "top 3 most recognizable slashers." Not to discredit DBD (I mean, they have Myers, Freddy, and Bubba), but having an entire game that just celebrates one particular (huge) slasher and everything about them is a big deal.
---
It happens. I always leave a little sliver of use on an item (unless it's a med kit where it's usually a full use unless you score a great skill check and get the boost). If you manage to escape, the item will be restored next trial. If your having trouble finding utems, I'd reccamend using ace and running his luck perks, as well as plundered instinct and you get a ridiculous amount of stuff (especially purple tier)
---
I’ve only had 95’s. Guess the Entity hates you.
---
a safe pallet is basically one with a long wall/blockage. If a killer doesn't break the pallet, you can safely vault it without fearing the killer doubling back to hit you as you vault. For example, an unsafe vault on Lerys would be the pallet leaning against a pillar. if survivors drop it, you can easily cut them off by going around. if they vault it, you can move back and forth a bit before they mess up and you can hit them as they vault back
---
The facecamping gang* ftfy

Ey guys don't downvote him, he was just asking a question. Don't be dicks.
---
I'd buy a Kate one.

---
But you're so pretty tho, wouldve stared at you also
---
Oof! You still have another week! Hopefully your internet sorts itself out.
---
Yare yare
---
Well, progress caries over, so a setback in the short term, but normal in the long term. At least it is not 8/9 coins :D
---
If that was the 8/9 id kill myself
---
Yeah, and I’m sure your mom would’ve preferred her period but here we are
---
Me
---
Pulling yourself off a hook has a 4% chance before any perks or modifiers. Its not worth essentially losing a life. 
---
See the problem is that those particular add-ons take a killer that already has no counterplay to them, and makes the game almost unwinnable against them.
---
People hate playing against the Legion because the Legion is a mind bogglingly poorly designed killer. If a Legion decided to start chasing you, assuming that they aren't a really bad player, you will *never* lose them. They *will* down you, and there is actually nothing you can do about it. Windows do nothing, pallets do nothing, running does nothing, hiding does nothing. You can lose any other killer in the game, even the Nurse, but the Legion you just can't, again, assuming the Legion player has a brain. But here's the thing: that doesn't actually make the Legion a good killer. It just makes them supremely unfun to play against. They will never lose a chase, but by the time they actually down someone, three gens are done and another is being worked on.
---
Frank's Mixtape takes that killer and suddenly allows them to down people in a reasonable time, which completely breaks the game.
---
This is why people hate the Legion and why you'll get so much shit for playing them.
---
I mean at least my mom didn’t try to abort me, cop out halfway through, and give birth to a bathtub sped named milky milk :/ 
---
If the killer hooks you, looks around, and makes a beeline for the aura of one of your teammates
---
You can wake them up if you go next to them just like healing. Also, since you run Claudette and have self care you can start healing yourself and miss the skill check on purpose to wake yourself up. While in the dream state and not next to Freddy he can see exactly where you are. 
---
&gt; I just feel like as killer all you need to do is get in range and lunge and even if the survivor spins or you lose line of sight you can still hit them with ease as long as you whip your mouse around all over the place.
---
You're literally complaining that killers are landing hits while in range for having the audacity to follow the survivor with the mouse
---
Now I've heard it all
---
Pretty much all debuffs stack multiplicatively.  Freddy can get selfcare times up to 3200 seconds in ideal situations.
---
Howdy! 🤠
---
Its good for point farming but thats pretty much it
---
Can a hobbyist get a response?
---
Yes you can.  Just use Bond, and stay the fuck away from any other survivors.  Unless he is using the global terror radius after inflicting Deep Wounds addon, his TR is lower than Bond's vision radius.
---
Or maybe be global and but only lasts for a few seconds after hitting a great skill check. This would give it a high skill cap and incentivise good timing for the survivor.
---
Gotta send 'em a message.
---
...and that message is, "you were not nice, now sit on the timeout hook."
---
Clown's cosmetic with the green hair and stuff is probably one of the more unnerving killer looks in the game.  
---
Honestly, I really like the Clown.  His character, his look, his methods, all of it. He's a nasty, unpleasant serial killer that drugs you and collects your fingers and it's nice to have that realistic simplicity.   
---
Wtf does bathtub sped even mean, throwaway account
---
Aside from the immense toxicity, I'm promoting a good time and THIS is what you bitch about? You must be great at parties.
---
Lol I'm not doing this with you anymore clown you admitted to killing off the farmee and not the farmer in your first post.  Man up and own your words/teribad baby plays 
---
Don’t worry about what people say stay positive play how you like to play if it by playing legion stay playing legion, as well with every other killer same with add ons/perks there is multiple add ons/perks to play how you want to as long as it not breaking any rules you’re good to play how you like 😊
---
&gt; you can hit anytime during the lunge animation, not when the killer initially swings their weapon.
---
No duh? Of course the whole lunge is damage dealing. So you're complaining that the entire action duration can cause damage. 
---
Think about this for a sec.
---
I would love if they nerfed it so it was one time use again. There, problem solved. No more mindless farming and assholes don't get away for free all the time. But Behavior insists on appeasing bad players (DS still has yet to be nerfed) and here we are. 
---
The old BT from a year ago was bad, especially at end game when gates are open, but now it's just insanely dumb. Just rush the hook like a moron, who cares, fuck the Killer, use BT with Deliverance and it doesn't matter if you actually get punished for hook rushing/farming you get to hop off the hook the instant the Killer walks away. Great game. 
---
Why she using a knife when she can use the killer foot?
---
I think even remake Freddy would be pretty pissed to be under the Entity’s control. Freddy’s always been the puppet master (Freddy’s Revenge and Freddy vs Jason), so him suddenly being forced into doing the Entity’s bidding would definitely piss him off.
---
What are thoooooose
---
sometimes. rn i’m using the build just to get BP so i swapped empathy out with we’re gonna live forever 
---
I agree, I don't remember his body shape was like this previously. Poor David
---
This is what I was thinking. I have my Claudie with max everything and about 100 toolboxes.
---
I’m a P3 Wraith as well. Have you seen the Wax Warlock skin? I’ve been seriously thinking about using all my shards to get it but can’t pull the trigger. I feel like I need to get him some more swag
---
More than one ds has been very very rare for me for quite some time now.
---
It is annoying but it hardly bothers me these days because I am usually able to down them again right after their escape.
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
Removed please post /r/dbdLFG
---
Look at true talents latest video about gen rushing. 3 mins, near 4 for all gens to pop. Something isn't adding up.
---
If you crouch to say sorry and don’t get a crouch back you know you fucked up
---
Send it in to deadbydaylight support. Bans are now something they could do on PS4. That is bannable
---
Yeah I bound it so I dont accidentally throw down pallets or vault windows when I want to heal. And I'm used to claw grip my controller so it's really nice for me.
---
Brown Markit is only useful for one health bar and that is it. It is mostly used for having syringes. And honestly just use a different toolbox, like yellow, and sloppy butcher has no effect on a syringe.
---
It makes perfect sense. Just because they don’t have friends or not wanting to use comms isn’t an arguement. It’s a team game not 1v1. If you wanna win in a team you play as a team. I mean we learn this in like grade school gym class. Don’t have friends? Then make some. It’s all just a click away. If you are dead set on not working as a team then you have to accept that the gameplay will not be optimal and you will have a much harder time just like any team game. You can’t neuter the killer side just because jimmy is shy. 
---
All ranks btw
---
Lol, I'd say its more of a dry humor than dickish. But I definitely get why some people are turned off by him, but for anyone wanting to improve I'd highly suggest his YouTube channel, lots of great instructional content.

---
Honestly the perk is pretty fucking good even without the bp gain. 
---
Honestly he seemed pretty serious about it which is weirdfor him
---
It’s really not. The hit connects with him under the pallet and she’s just starting the animation to stop and turn to dump it. It’s just like an arms length away. 
---
Devour that soap
---
BP doesnt affect meta because it doesn't affect ingame performance.
---
im on ps4
---
Both &gt;:) (Stake out, killers dont always have hex perks and it isn't guaranteed that you will be playing against a trapper/hag)
---
&gt;I have played killer so often and at least 4 times a game I say out loud to myself "I did not land that hit" on pallet swings but the game just hands it to me on a silver platter. 
---
I think you are just underestimating the lunge. The lunge hitbox is genuinely enormous, the hitbox remains active for awhile after the weapon comes to a rest at the bottom of the downswing, and it is zoomy as absolute hell. Meanwhile, starting the pallet throw animation requires the survivor to *stop moving*, meaning it's a huge increase to the *relative* speed of the killer - like slamming on the brakes in front of a speeding car.
---
I main killer, and I never really see jank hits at pallets (hit detection is killer-side, so lag jank is strictly a survivor-side thing). It will sometimes look like I'm barely tickling someone's behind with a gently outstretched hammer, but I see that in chases and at vaults, too. And I do meet plenty of survivors who can consistently pallet stun me without giving me a hit, and they are usually really, really good survivors overall. Their pallet stuns sometimes look kind of ridiculous on my screen, honestly - it's like the pallet is barely slamming on my goddamn toes before I'm even under it. The pallet hitbox is really generous.
---
&gt;My ping limit is 180. Anything over that and I won't want to play. My average ping is around 100 for my opponents. Would going lower really make that much more of a difference?
---
Real-time multiplayer is a clever lie told to you by clever engineers. No two people in a real-time multiplayer game are seeing the same thing. The higher the ping, the bigger the difference.
---
If you have 180 ping to the killer, the killer is actually hitting the you from 90 ms ago, which has been interpolated 90ms forward, then finally telling you you've been hit 90ms after you actually were. Altogether, that's up to 90ms of true jank (jank that affected the outcome) caused by unpreventable disagreements in position and timing and 90ms of false jank (it didn't change the outcome, but it might *look* like it did) caused by simple notification delay. That's really close to human reaction speed, i.e. you can consciously notice it.
---
For reference, my current CS:GO matchmaking ping limit is set to 60. CS:GO measures ping end-to-middle (player&lt;-&gt;server), while DBD measures ping end-to-end (survivor&lt;-&gt;killer), so that's the equivalent of 120 ping in a DBD lobby. And DBD is honestly more ping sensitive, because all of the important interactions are happening within arm's length, where small changes in position are way more likely to change the outcome than in a game where the weapon of choice is a hitscan AK47 that you're firing at people across the room.
---
So... tl;dr 180 ping is still playable, it's actually even still pretty fair, but the notification delay is going to occasionally push things into the "feels weird" territory - like dying after thinking you'd made it around the corner in an FPS kind of "feels weird." The guy actually shot you before you made it around the corner, it's just the message that you were shot didn't reach you until after you were around the corner, leading to apparent WTFery. I generally nope out somewhere in the 150-200 range as survivor, depending on how long I had to wait for a game. Average ping is about 80-120. So pretty much the same as you.
---
Hahahaha. Jesus
---
weave: snatched
---
I would say neither.
---
I was wondering how you one-shotted but then I noticed Devour Hope. Good shit. I prefer to let them bleed out because fuck that perk and fuck the people who use it. 
---
Even vs swf unlesss they go super try hard noed is probably gonna pop
---
I love what you just said. Might mean something if that was something I did.. haha. If my post offended you then you’re the one who lobby dodges!  I don’t DC... EVER.   Buddy don’t come for me I’m not that girl ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
The sad truth :(
---
"Most people who use decisive are assholes so I'll be even worse"
---
Let us know the outcome.
---
I have never heard of this glitch, what is it?
---
Ruin
---
It's slept on because totem spawns are horrifically bad most of the time. But you have to use Ruin anyway and hope they don't find it for at least a minute. If the re-work fixes the problem and actually makes it so it takes an average of 3 or 4 minutes for them to find the totem (and I doubt this will actually happen) then Devour Hope will be amazingly strong. 
---
I know I'll drop BBQ on Billy for Devour Hope if that's the case. 
---
I have a video from yesterday. 4 gens were finished in 3 1/2 minutes. How many chases and hooks can you get from loading into the game in 3 minutes?
---
Oh yeah, it's probably not that great of a time for the killer. But it is what it is, again Noob3 is toxic for the sole reason that he is good at chases and wants to be chased "moderately" he doesn't always seek out the killer, only when he specifically says he is going to. 
---
This was originally how comparing Noob3 to Ochido is like conparing a wave to tsunami. One is just fun but can hurt if you're not careful, the other was fucking pure destruction to everyone around him.
---
My ban for this glitch comes off in 5 hours, so if you don't have an answer by then I'll hit you up.
---
Mummy please! 
---
It doesn't prevent it, it mostly helps with opportunities to turn the battlefield against survivors. I run Discordance on Trapper, for instance, to let them work as I take my time setting traps. Then I go after one and use him or her as bait for the others. The perk simply keeps me informed of what they're up to so I can plan accordingly. 
---
Yeah he’s no way like Ochido
---
Will do!

Ruin is over rated.  The reason why people destroy devour hope so quick is because they're looking for Ruin.  But when you don't run any hex's besides Devour, They don't expect it unless they get lucky and see it.  Then it's too late because I'm instant downing people.  Devour hope can be alternative to Ruin I find.
---
All right then. Thank you.

Are you waiting for your friend to join your lobby before you ready up? Or are you sending the invite and reading up before they come in? If you do that you will be put in a match without them. 
---
Step 3?

I lost all my friends because of DBD
---
Spirit for Spirit Fury. Awesome perk.
---
It was a glitch in the 2.5.0 update (That has since been fixed) that allowed you to fully prestige characters while bypassing having to level them up to get to the next prestige rank.
---
Make your choice
---
Yeah what an idiot for not predicting the off chance you'd have Kindred.
---
Completing one quest is already rewarding, now imagine completing all 3 + Killing all Survivors/Escaping the Trial, Swimming in bloodpoints~
---
Depends on what you are after. 
---
If you hate dealing with loops, go with Clown because his ability can zone and slow survivors making him one of the best anti-loopers in the game. I just love it when they throw down a pallet in front of me while getting gassed at the same time, and then I break the pallet with Brutal strength and Fire up, and they barely got 10m away as opposed to the 24m they usually get with other killers in that situation. I always catch them with clown, and finish chases quickly. He's a powerful killer with a mid level learning curve.
---
If you like to mind-game survivors and be unpredictable, as well as have the patience to adjust to a different way of playing killer (high learning curve), go for Spirit! Honestly she has quickly become one of my favorites, but playing as her does require a lot of trial and error. I just love stopping as I chase only to watch the survivor double back into my blade because they think I'm using her power, or jump-scare snatching people off of objectives coming out of phase walk... its just so satisfying!
---
If you want a straight forward killer with great speed that doesn't care about pallets and builds up your bloodpoints better than any other, but typically doesn't get many kills until you get good enough to build a nice rhythm for it, then go with Legion. I love that Legion can be either pure pressure to everyone on the map or a relentless pursuer taking down 1 survivor at a time but at a cost of having longer chase times due to how their power makes them a 4-3 hit killer instead of the standard 2 hit. Still, because of all of the Brutality, Devious, and Hunting points you get, win or lose, Legion is fantastic to have for inflating your BP pool when combined with BBQ&amp;C and BP offerings, which you can use to rank up other killers as well. This killer is also the easiest to learn given the choices.
---
Extra extra! Come and get your Demi plays!
---
I love how people say "above rank 20" like there is any ranks below 20.
---
I would say 30% of all players complain a lot, and should stop being masochistic. 
---
That shit is scary
---
Bing bong
---
I'm also pretty keen on some kind of beast character. Either a classic werewolf or something a bit more deformed ala Bloodborne beasts. Would probably be hard to pull off though, maybe he has a system similar to the Evil Within gauge for his transformation levels? Maybe some sort of perk regarding bleeding survivors on the map? I know there's a few already though.
---
Implying like 85% of DBD isn't RNG
---
I partially agree. You don't need Ruin with Billy/Nurse at least. But everyone else sadly needs it. I've tried playing Legion without it (substituting Ruin with Remember Me) and it just isn't fun to get gen rushed. If every Killer had map control then we wouldn't need Ruin but we don't. 
---
If they can just fucking fix the bullshit where (at least half the fucking time this fucking happens) they spawn right on top of Ruin or very close next to it so they take 2 steps and see it. And fix the bullshit where it spawns next a gen then maybe games won't be as terrible most of the time when you use mid-tier Killers? This is Behavior so they will undoubtedly fuck something up like give DS another buff. 
---
Well, I lost a "friend" of mine (good riddance in retrospect) because I said that I didn't like Bioshock: Infinite. No joke, he told me to kill myself because of it.

If you think Billy’s chainsaw is easy you sir are an idiot

Trapper and Hag have VERY different playstyles so careful with that, I usually run Ruin, BBQ, M&amp;A and a freebie, be it Make Your Choice, Whispers, Haunted Grounds, etc.
---
These are all valid points. Just because you strawman your argument doesn't mean you're right
---
Well for survivors, it's like "alright let's do this guys!" Distortion "BYYYYEEEEE!!"

Short version: Five blink Nurse kills three other survivors, and spends the next... 55 minutes of a 1 Hour and 9 Minute trial, by knocking me down, and dragging me to a corner, where I can momentarily wiggle free - but then get knocked down again. Repeat.
---
When I was about to bleed out, he finally hooked me. 
---
This. Is. Toxic.
---
And no, I refuse to ever disconnect, no matter how bad a round might immediately start off or frustrate me. That will never happen, short of a power failure. :D
---
I’m assuming he intentionally downranks off of it but he’s not intentionally working with a player to ruin others game. Just thought it was odd cause the grind for a new player is real and I’d like to have a nicer time getting BP apart from playing my survivor so I can watch a movie and chill. Think I might have to do this some time.
---
In gameplay map generation is RNG, but where DbD shines is how the players use that against each other. Simply knowing the maps wont really help that much as they change just enough between matches that a moving window, pallet, or sight blocker is enough to always keep the game somewhat fresh.
---
RNG for perks/items/add-ons is, often, horribly grindy but the core gameplay is what makes DbD one hell of a game and it just does things right in that remark.
---
If you want to see really bad RNG. Look at F13 or Last Year and how they make who plays the Killer based on RNG. I play DbD because I can choose to play as anything I want. To be Killer or Survivor is my choice. The game chooses who gets to play as Killer in F13 or Last year and that more or less locks half of the game behind RNG you can't do anything about. F13 is fucking HORRIBLE in this as you have like 13% odds of playing as Jason, in a game all about playing AS Jason! Last Year has just 20% odds of being Killer. Their RNG locks away their own core gameplay. That's fucked up in my opinion.
---
I for one refuse to buy or play any game that prevents me from playing as who I want to play as when I want.
---
They didn't nerf multiple survivors on gen, they just added the visual indicator. The speed is the same as before.
---
You want to ban a killer for being nice? Yikes... 
---
You stood no chance the survivor mains out number killer mains, I like both but I don't know what to tell you. Up vote for giving an honest opinion 
---
weird, I got banned for a week
---
I didn’t know you could farm like that and it be okay. Good to know cause the grind is real! 
---
What did bhvr say about it
---
*than 
---
While I applaud your never disconnecting, you honestly should have just AFKd on that bitch. It never ceases to amaze what dumb shit people pull in this game just to tick others off 😂
---
:( I really like The Legion because it got me away from tunneling and actually roaming the map. 
---
No I even stated somewhere else I didn’t report him I was just curious if this could lead to a ban if someone did.
---
You’re joking. You clearly don’t play Killer
---
Because you still do not get it. I will copy paste as many times as I need.

Caught a lagswitcher, is that hacking or exploiting? Or other?

I actually have a group of friends who like to SWF. I just don't like survivor, at all. I find it extremely boring.

I do this with my Clown 🤡 under the name TAG YOU'RE IT from time to time when I just want to be stupid and have fun for a few games.  Killer can be stressful, so for me just goofing off with a meme can take the edge off. Lol
---
Honestly I wish the F13 wasn't dead. I never got to play it on release and knowing the devs abandoned it is depressing. I loved watching people play it. Plus, I mean, swimsuit dlc. Man o man dat swimsuit dlc.
---
reach past level 100. Each time is another devotion level
---
Is this something you do for fun or do you actually pitch the idea to the Devs?  I hope you do pitch it to them. 
---
It's the only multiplayer horror game that still has a playerbase. Every other game that tries to compete crashes and burns.
---
If there was an actual worthy competitor in the genre DbD wouldn't be as successful. 
---
I mean he's getting chase, brutality, and deviousness points from playing that way so it's entirely possible to pip like that. He was probably being nice :) 
---
Good idea, make the already dwindling console player base even smaller because of a glitch. It’s not like lobby wait times were long enough and people were quitting anyways because nobody wants to play killer on your game that doesn’t even work properly.
---
After level 99 you level your devotion up 
---
Cancel the Freddy rework, he deserves his own game.
---
Yes gens are boring. People have made this known for 2 years. The devs have talked about reworking the end game stage and secondary objectives for a while now but nothing major as been done.
---
The only two big changes since the release of the game have been:
---
* Kicking gens
---
* Hex Totems
---
That's it. It's kind of sad when you think about it. Killer gameplay has not changed radically while survivors still play the same game they've been playing for 2 years now. 
---
Yeah no problem friend, happy hunting
---
Besides that what he/she said is 100% right, you can recognize safe pallets because if you don't run away once you drop them (as survivor) you are caught in this situation in which you have to vault it as the killer is strafing left and right around it to avoid getting hit, and every vault you still feel he might be able to reach you. As a survivor you should never rely on the killer making a mistake, most loops can be "mind gamed" but there's a range of safety within them. But unsafe pallets just don't have this, there's always a very short distance around the pallet that the killer can easily use to avoid breaking it, he doesn't even need bloodlust to hit you, so don't think you can loop this ones. Just throw them and keep running.
---
As a killer, just go around unsafe and break safe. You should check "DamnNoHtml" youtube's channel (scottjund) as he has many good explanatory videos on this regard with plenty of examples.
---
I made a meal and came back, and managed to get somewhat across the map before they blinked to my location....
---
Is this your way of saying you got all 9 coins? If so congrats! But also how the fuck? God being an adult with a fulltime job sucks.
---
Removed uncivil 
---
*titanic music as the post drowns in downvotes*
---
Do totems too, else you might get hit with NOED.  
---
  
---
But survivors don't like doing totems, they usually just complain that NOED is OP even though it's completely preventable.
---
I also hate it when the Wraith I’m against has it lol
---
slugging is inherently worse then hooking because it only takes 3 hooks and someone is dead, but with slugging you might have to drop them god knows how many times for them to bleed out, not to mention how long it takes to bleed out. Not to mention with freddy, survivors can possibly heal a slug before they even get pulled into the dream world, and then you can only really chase one while the other fails a skillcheck.
---
In this sub, anything is possible
---
There is no step 3.
---
Are you that guy who uses memes that die a month later, the meme necromancer
---
It was only sorted by rank and it was killer advantage at all ranks. No swf vs solo though
---
People have suggested some kind of having to find parts for gens or something, would be cool to try it, but devs are too afraid to try new stuff in case it ruins their cash cow.
---
My Killer queue times have been worse than my survivor ones once the event started. I want these insta queues people are talking about :/

If he's a rank 2 killer, he definitely gets enough kills to not need to facecamp.

Yea, you glow a different shade of red
---
Just last week the killer disconnected in a game I was in and then the game shut down and I had to restart the game and when I came back into the lobby I had lost 5 pips total, I was so annoyed
---
You're just mad because you said dumb shit and got corrected. Honestly, though, stay mad. 
---
Relatable 
---
Howdy 
---
And then the game never loads. In my experience anyway. 
---
wrong. You are once again making shit up. You have done nothing but lie all converation. You are lying to a God by. If there were 50 ranks I'd be rank 1 within a week EZ.

---
BHVR back at it with another event 
---
I have full tier 3 perks in all my killers because I leveled them to 40 to get the teachables. Was he hitting you on the hook?
---
How can you complain about camping when killing the survivors is literally the prime objective of the killers?
---
What do you want killers to do? Walk away and let you get unhooked??
---
The point is both parties need to play in a more polite manner if they want to get more bloodpoints and make it fun for the other side. You can "gen rush" and get no points just as easily as I can facecamp 1 of you then noed for a 2k. Not fun and I get shit points.
---
There's a Saver and a Savee.  Savee in that scenario is guy currently on the hook.  Do you even English bro?  If you meant that you attack the person making the save and not the person on hook you simply used the wrong word to say it.  That or you're just trying to wall back what you previously said.
---
Yeah, he did.

When was Clown buffed? Also Trapper is still poopy so jokes on him.

---
still better than 100 percent rng
---
why they are fooni :(
---
While I agree with most of what you said, the part where the Dead Wounds mechanic is a guaranteed down is patently untrue, due to the fact that it doesn't tick down during a chase, and can instantly be cleansed outside of a chase.
---
The part about the Pig's timers being to short is even more untrue. The likelyhood of actually killing someone with a trap is exceedingly low. I know that in one pool that was posted on here, only about 3% of traps actually result in death.
---
Sometimes.
---
Open the task manager, find the still running Dead by Daylight process. Click on "end task".
---
You should be able to start the game again now.
---
We have the same taste in killers. Would choose either legion or spirit. Honestly, spirit is super fun to play as and easy to wreck survivors as a killer. Legion can get a lot of points and, if right add-ons, 4k. Both though seem to fit the other killers "playstyle" that you already have closer than the other killers you don't own. 
---
To be fair, your playing claudette. And im a survivor main.
---
Give me skilled instead auto doc pls 
---
Ayyy I'm the guy in the video I'm famous now :O
---
Umm data drives smells like Last year to me
---
I’m on PS4 but the same trend happens for us too, I’d say. 
---
Out of the three, Spirit is probably my favorite. Rancor and Hallowed grounds are two of my favorite perks and her power is pretty powerful once you get the hang of it. 
---
Same on ps4
---
Im just watching as this comment keeps going from 2 to -2 upvotes
---
I was really hoping you weren’t going to call me out but I guess I can elaborate some more.
---
When there 3 survivors on gens, with toolboxes/prove thy self, and the gens are ending as the you down the first guy. Also, when they let the guy hang on the hook so they can have more time to do the gens instead of being altruistic is pretty much rushing the gens. There’s not much the killer can really do in this scenario unless they play like Billy/Nurse. So us basic bitch killers, like myself, have to put up with gen rushing occasionally which is almost always followed by a “gg ez” message and tbags. I’m sure you haven’t really witnessed this at the killers perspective but it does exist, just like camping and tunneling exist. I probably didn’t explain this very and I could have explained better, but I didn’t want to put to much time into this. One last thing, a good example of gen rushing being a real thing would be Marth 88’s depip squad series.
---
Doing hens you?
---
Savee is the person on the hook.  You're using the wrong word.  You mean the saver.  Killing the saver means you're playing killer with some integrity.  Killing the savee means your a tunneling prick.
---
Doing Gens you?
---
Doing Gens You??
---
I think the real issue is that it's very easy to remember games where you didn't do well, as opposed to games where you did. That, and I've also noticed that the quality of a game, as a killer, depends on how well all of the survivors are doing, because one or two survivors being complete potatoes can really dick over the people who are doing extremely well.
---
As a Nurse, if all 4 players are not completely brain dead, the game is still going to be a nightmare because even if I'm getting knock downs fairly quickly, the survivors are going to be banging out those gens since they'll always have at least 2 people working on them at any given time, which doesn't allow any killer to really stop the rush unless you're constantly catching people before someone is unhooked.
---
If one person is being really stupid, and you take them out of the game fast, or they just don't know how to do gens while you're busy as something else as the killer, it can really stall the game badly and cause the other survivors to lose.
---
Use the search function.
---
# FINALLY
---
that tree at the start looks spicy
---
Rank doesnt matter, relax
---
Eh
---
thats a visual bug, had it quite often already 
---
It would take a new game with a different team id think. Dead by Daylight has a formula now and itll stay the same for a while. Wait for the next game to blow it out of the water.
---
Who cares the devs are fine with both apparently as well as legion so you should probably give up all hope for this game being somewhat even.
---
Just accept there's bullshit and move on.
---
That's also a factor in time, starting lower already after resets, and knowing how to maximize scoring for emblems.
---
This game is WAY more forgiving for ranking than most other games, since there isn't a very clear win / loss, and rather points you have to score. It's why you can get literally shit on as Legion and still pip up, but get a 2k as Spirit and somehow black pip.
---
Pipping is based on Emblems, not bloodpoints though and the Lightbringer emblem checks for % of generators completed (and exit gates/gens finished/hex totems).  It has nothing to do with how many points you earn in the objective category.  
---
Prove Thyself does help you finish a generator slightly faster, so you do gain % of generator completed a little faster, but you don't get more total percentage gained.  Lightbringer emblem wise, Prove Thyself does not really benefit you.  It may benefit in other emblems though, since faster generators could mean better odds of survival but it's not much different than just having a good toolbox in terms of pips.  
---
Bloodpoints wise, it's absolutely great.  You get to max out objective basically every match.
---
Been a problem for over 2 years. Don't sweat it 
---
Ok bye
---
Laurie thats not how you dab!
---
Oh, I thought coop points went to lightbringer? I guess I’ve just been double pipping more? The monetary gain is IMO the better of the 2 perks.
---
I never said hello in the first place seeya 
---
DS annoying? Please....
---
ever heard of Adrenaline? thats basically the exact same thing as Noed, but it cant be prevented by breaking totems...
---
Well, they were a SWF group with no perks who didn't communicate. They beat "randos", but killer is always solo, so... that doesn't really factor much.
---
The other issue is the stats you're pointing to as evidence leaves out a lot of important factors, such as killers played vs. which teams are SWF vs. solo queued, and the ranks they are all being pitted against. When I was Rank 1 killer last month, I got into a lot of games where survivors were acting really fucking weird, trolling each other, or just letting me win. Then there were games where everyone was going ultra tryhard, and murdering 2 gens in the first minute of the game, even though I was chasing and hooked someone within that first minute.
---
I probably should specify, trap narrow spaces like windows and pallets. I know not to trap in the pallet cause that’s just dumb. One thing I do t know is which side to put it on.
---
not sleeping between work?
---
So you dont sleep for days?
---
Dammit, it’s closed. 
---
4 you get a clear reagent.
---
Why not get rid of both plus insidious and legion and call it good
---
Let's see the white knights defend this one.
---
Doubt
---
"only super strong on fast killers" where after that, I go on to explain that I mean BBQ is clearly better on Nurse or Billy than it is on Wraith or Freddy, but again clearly you guys can't read
---
did u tell him
---
Are you on Pc?
---
oh

"YOU ARE TRASH LOL" Great name for destroying rank 20 perkless killers, clearly matchmaking is flawless.

One thing i have toying around with is a werewolf chapter. The survivor and killer are the same person survivor being human and killer being werewolf.  The survivor would have perks based around keen senses (like that of a wolf) and being a heavy hitter. The killers perks were based on senses and strength but Hallowed Ground and Rancor are near exactly 2 of the teachables i jad wrote up. The Werewolfs ability would be jumping, they could quickly ascend floors by hopping in through windows or up holes. And they could take a perch spot up high and survey the area. I might make this its own post later on.
---
Why not remove Legion by themselves :)
---
I find it concerning the design team hasn't considered this before..
---
They need to implement a minimum game time somehow and make it be around 6 minutes. They could do this by dynamically changing gen speed or making it so the gate lever doesn't work until the minimum game time has been reached.
---
I honestly can't see what fun there is in dunking on a killer in less than 5 minutes other than for trolling, and it would be so easy to remove from the game. Most survivors probably wouldn't even notice because they're not the ones trying to set a new personal best escape time every game of DbD even if it means everybody depips and gets like 12k BP. 
---

---
Ok
---
I’m gonna start to complain post game about how killers kill rushed me. They killed me before I could win, therefore it’s imbalanced. Actually I guess I just described tunneling. Fuck. Side note, ever wonder how the devs hate complaining? “NOED is OP plz nerf!” Devs: Okay. *buffs NOED*
---
“Gen rushing is a problem. We need to slow down gens!” Devs: Okay. *buffs Prove Thyself.*
---
Wrong, you lost again. I got some sleep while you were arguing with yourself. Ggez
---
Literally everyone I know who plays this game has "quit" like 3 times. Like no for real they're never playing it again this time.
---
You literally just said that it's **only**, emphasize on the only part, for fast killers, and you didn't explain why BBQ is better on nurse and billy you explained why bbq won't help weaker killers in the chase as if that perk helps in chases, spies is still useless imo because if you actually have ears you can hear the crow's cawing, and you can literally counter this perk by just crouching, and whispers doesn't pinpoint a location so you still have to search for a survivor.
---
i honestly didnt even notice the friends option, I just assumed there was survivor and killer. How is swf even fair?! Cant people in a group communicate to gain a huge unfair advantage?
---
Damn what a play. 
---
You've never seen anyone use a malaphor?
---
This comment section is saltier than a fucking salt mine
---
Metaphor? Isn’t the phrase “sharpest tool in the shed”?
---
While 5 gens is bad Freddy is the only Killer that has a kit that doesnt help with pallets
---
Huntress can throw Hatchers
---
Trapper &amp; Hag can trap
---
Leatherface &amp; Billy can instadown when they run to the next pallet/break pallets faster if timed right
---
Nurse is fucking Nurse
---
Doc can prevent drops and vaults
---
Myers also has instadown + increased lunge
---
Clown can cause slow vaults
---
Pig, Legion, and even Wraith can zoom zoom with their powers for mind games
---
Freddy... gives wallhacks 1/5 of the map away and makes the person hes chasing have slower healing and repair speed...
---
not wrong 🤣
---
what it's worth is ds in everygame and bowls of loops 
---
Buffed in the PTB to increase the slow down to 2.5 seconds from 2 seconds
---
In the Spirit update they fixed his bottles to cause slow vaults. Not a buff just a bug fix
---
People definitely come up with some weird ones lol
---
Mom im a lesbian now
---
This argument is so flawed. Sure, if you 4 man swf you can find all the totems but anything less you’ll have no idea if they’re all gone. Plus, DS gives you 1 health state and is completely nullified by being picked up in a dead zone or not being a good looper. NOED allows you to 1 hit as many survivors as you can catch, makes catching them easier, and doesn’t require you to be good a loops to use because it buffs your ability to run them. Also idk what rank you are but NOED pops all the time at rank 1, and normally gets 1-2 downs before it gets found or everyone just leaves. NOED is only “completely avoidable” if your team is good enough to loop the killer for 5 gens and all the totems. 
---
Both perks are crutches and arguing about which is weaker or stronger is pointless because they’re both broken and neither takes an ounce of skill to use. 
---
This happened to me and I ran over to the Killer to try to make friends bc there were still 5 gens and he just killed me, LOL.  I don’t know why I was disappointed but I was. 
---
I got blinded by a firecracker as I was looking up at the fucking ceiling 
---
9/10 times it's just an easy 4k lol but fun
---
Entity taking pity on survivors 
---
Dude, look out! Wait, he cant hear us with his Airpods in!
---
And you wonder why killers camp
---
Intentionally downranking isn’t bannable unless you dc to do it 
---
I get offended by it, yeah. I had pretty bad anxiety and depression, so to me it just stings a lot. I try to ignore it, mutter something mean about them to myself, leave.   
---
If I get really stomped and  they t-bagged a lot, I just leave. I don't wait to be insulted, and I don't expect a gg. It just feels really mean to me, like I understand you got away, but was it really necessary to rub it in? You outplayed me, congrats, but why act like that?   
---
That said, I grew thicker skin after coming to this reddit page for help, and it worked but with a bad side effect. I think I am becoming more "toxic". I try to avoid it as much as I can, I hate making people feel bad, but if they played horrible or say something stupid (my favorite is definitely "Ugh, NOED, really?) I like to throw in a "Cry about it." and leave, after a GG and calling out whoever said it.   
---
But if they don't t-bag or act smug, Geeist of the Gee's, was a pleasure :) 
---
Even the Entity hates Legion :( 
---
I always wait for my friend to be in the lobby before I start
---
yeehaw
---
Doesnt matter, he alwayys fucks it up
---
It's still not a waste of time. I've learned most spawn points, and I don't always have to ensure that all 5 are gone. I can break three or something, and I'll know the general area of the last totems, if there's a noed.
---
I upvoted just because of your tag
---
As a huntress main. I felt this!!! Good job lol also am I the only one who throws hatchets at them as they die :D
---
#**SPIRIT**
---
They could just do it in some "Trying new ideas" server, no harm there.  
---
Just SOME kind of other objective, lets try anything at this point, maybe after each gen the survivors have to do 20 jumping jacks and eat a salad in order to promote a healthy lifestyle.
---
Run a altruistic build. Bt, we'll make it, and throw in dh to extend chases.
---
If you overlook that pretty much every patch in the last year has been killer buffs, I guess.
---
It's only Tuesday as well..
---
Dude it’s either get genrushed, kill all of the survivors or have an intense/boring game
---
My friends and I often do this including singing the song at random intervals, glad we're not alone. We always refer to each other as Bill no matter what which leads to lots of stupid exchanges like "Bill, go bodyblock Bill for me!" "Roger that Bill!" We also have a no Bill Left Behind policy which leads to many deaths.
---
How often do you really see that scenario though? I mean the bunch of tool boxes and prove thyself. As far as letting a guy hang on a hook so they can continue doing gens is a trade off that you dont have to catch that survivor an extra time.
---
I play both killer and survivor pretty evenly, albeit I dont have time to get high ranks but still single digits, and I dont think I've ever seen a Gen rush like that. I usually run sloppy butcher and switch targets frequently and I think that helps slow the game down, but you also gotta remember you can pip with only getting 2 kills if you do a lot of other stuff and you can usually pick up a late kill if the last couple generators are close together or just harder to do. And now they have perks like discordance to help with multiple people on a Gen although I haven't gotten the chance to use it yet. Idk in all my games the only thing thats super frustrating to me is when a killer facecamps the first survivor he gets.  
---
This damn title keeps making me lol. I keep imagining the spirit coming out of character and saying this in a sassy voice.
---
Add more gens, keep the milestones the same. Gives the Killer more time while increasing what he needs to patrol early on. Survivors have more work to do but they have the opportunity to earn more points while being rewarded for the same amount of progress. Everyone benefits in some fashion. 
---
Congrats!
---
It's used up after one use?
---
PS4 player here
---
OP, I wanna be your friend. It's rare to find people who don't get triggered and just play the game for fun. Especially long term players.
---
I hear alot of crying and assuming in these comments, who hurt you? The cannibal? Wait.. Maybe.. Just maybe behavior made a game with terrible peer to peer servers and an ever steep dropoff of desire to play killer.. Maybe, just maybe we should all "go play civilization"
---
Thanks everyone I am glad you guys like it! I am currently trying some animations, if I come up with something I will make sure to show you guys :)
---
So like... the first two weeks of its release? Jk. I'm salty because I paid 50 dollars for a broken game.
---
Never noticed how hot Nea is 
---
Wow 2 insta heals, OP! /s
---
Isn't Jason supposed to be OP? Isn't that his entire schtick?
---
Just ignore it. Toxic people will make up whatever to put the blame on someone else as long as its not their own fault they lost. 
---
Pressure is a difficult thing.  You have to determine very quickly if the person you are chasing is going to make your life miserable.  If so, go find gens to pressure.
---
Remove NOED! I shouldn't have to cleanse totems! 
---
Well yes but also no. He was supposed to be strong ,but they tried to make it winnable for survivors. However, with this it's so one sided that it's a slaughter.
---
Insta mori on all survivors and you can see their auras , have 160%mov speed and they cant leave 
---
And its not a hex perk anymore. 
---
Thats balanced
---
Yeah they’re not reachable though. They’re the equivalent to kindred or small game. Just a random perk that appears. I want bill :(
---
I love Gordon so much.
---
Getting the teachables is annoying but getting them on characters you play on shouldn't be that hard 
---
No. Mikey is not OP by any means, they are just so salty it corroded their reasoning into complete nonsense.
---
"Using the only thing that makes him good" is a funny way to complain about a killer using their power. Did he just want you to stalk him in T1 the whole game?
---
Aight well doesn’t seem balanced but okay
---
I once did the three rituals with huntress, I kept putting them off and doing the others until I had three huntress rituals, went into a match with machine gun hatchets and made sure to have long chases. 
---
No, you’re meant to hook youself, duh
---
At level 50 you should be getting 300 IS. 
---
Bubba is his first name not a nickname
---
DbD is in Simpsons universe confirmed!
---
Implying that veteran players don’t already have those in spades already, why because of a few busted builds let newbies suffer with the awfulness that is level 1 killers and the leveling process.
---
Someone gifted me F13, and I played a couple of hours of it, but that was several months ago.
---
I guess I don't really get the whole concept of how to avoid Jason, so I sort of lost interest.
---
That said, DBD can't really keep me interested for too long before I need breaks, usually for months on end. I like DBD, but the balance just annoys me.
---
When you play killer, YOU are the only one that decides how the game goes, you have nobody to depend on but yourself. When you play survivor however, you have to rely on your teammates to cleanse totems, which most of the time never happens. It's either you get the gens done, or you get the totems done. Rarely both. 'Just cleanse totems bro' is a shitty solution fed to the community by killer mains, knowing fully well that it's incredibly unrealistic. Also, why the fuck does NOED even exist? It's a true crutch. Nowhere near as bad as DS, like seriously. It needs big nerfs.
---
This shit needs to be fixed as it has gotten progressively worse.  There is no countering magical axes that somehow magically veer around corners.
---
That could certainty be a thing too but I’m sure most people just keep all offerings to use
---
Now hit 1million bps, prestiege a character, use it all up then complete all 3 rituals for extra bps. You can hit at least level 43
---
Thats the thing now. At least DBD has some balance now F13 really doesn't have any....
---
Yes but if I'm not mistaken one of the addons is for 1 health state while the other is to full health but if you use it both get used along with the med kit so you waste one of the good addons this way,  and a good med kit as well
---
this with pre-nerf WGLF. Orgasm.
---
Cause you break the games balance by allowing the strongest yellow/green addons to be used every single game. It would make 80+% of all addons obsolete aswell. It is a stupid idea that would cause any of the games dedigners to facepalm should it actually ever reach them.
---
&gt;Don't bring up DS because it's wholly irrelevant since it actually requires skill. 
---
Skill as in hitting a skill check? DS could prolong a chase by 2 gens if used by a good survivor. Its completely relevant if you want to talk about NOED being a crutch. And don't say "but destroying totems takes time, blah blah", because dribbling or taking the stun takes time. A crutch is something that saves you when you fuck up, I agree with NOED being one but so is DS. Both save you when you fuck up. 
---
I agree, I was just making a small joke
---
That's cause 99% of the people that complain on here don't want balance, they want their (survivor/killer) preference buffed so the game is in easy mode.  
---
Someone should make this but with a billy camping a hooked survivor
---
I think downloading a client is bannable, but if your screen has a built in crosshair go ahead, not sure tho
---
I know what you‘ve been through. I reported for the first time this weekend (killer/survivor duo teaming up against the other survivors on PS4).
---
First tried to attach the video to the report, but instead of saying something like „too large, please upload somewhere else“ the upload just stalled at some point and after awhile I got a „connection lost“ error.
---
After uploading elsewhere and submitting I almost missed the small print saying that the report was not submitted until I verified my email.
---
So I created an account there and it accepted the password I entered.
---
Still couldn’t log in afterwards. First was showing me a message that I had to enable cookies but I have. Figured out that I had to disable cross-website tracking protection in my browser. 
---
Then it didn’t accept my password. I requested a password reset, and trying to set the same password again it now showed me the error that the initial password that was accepted the first time was not valid (needed at least one special character). Once I generated a „proper“ password I could log in.
---
Once you’re through this though, you can see your ticket under „My Tickets“, and despite all the pain it feels good to report people who ruin your experience and I will keep reporting when I have to.
---
True, I play both so I want both just evened out, apperantly people don’t like that then 
---
i call him Billus of the Hill
---
same!! good practice :) 
---
Yeah, fuck toxic killers like you and him
---
Mine keeps disconnecting middle of the match survivor and killer with a message that pops up and says I must own the content.  And before anyone says anything I renewed on my license on my PS4.   I was thinking killer disconnects at first but then that message kept popping up
---
Stop using sloppy and never use ruin, and ILY forever.  Love, survivor main.
---
Not a great plan i must say.
---
A man can only *dream*
---
Seems fair...
---
I know lol, I was just being more specific.  
---
It IS sad though, since it's a tool they have but barely use, they only started using it recently too.
---
Stay there pls. Rank 1 players like to disconnect to purple ranks, rank 1 needs more players
---
So you are saying that people here cry about everyone being a sirvivor main while you are crying about everyone being a killer main?
---
Ironic
---
Not anymore
---
Sassy, yet still echoy and moany.
---
I literally don't even see how DS is a problem. If you chase the obsession for 2 gens and get struck when you pick them up, and looped for another 2 gens, YOU HAVE NOBODY BUT YOURSELF TO BLAME. Like... How?!? How are people blaming the perk instead of themselves...
---
Anyway, even if you DO hit it, you need to keep up the chase again for a fair amount of time to get any use out of it, which is often difficult considering how everyone runs Enduring and the lack of pallets on maps anymore. But this is completely irrelevant anyway.
---
And even if you DO a cleanse totems then it's not 100% guaranteed because *it's a team effort, something which doesn't exist in solo*
---
So DS isn’t toxic
---
This is your friends load out screen. Did he take a photo of his tv when selecting it and then send it to you? Odd.
---
Yes. And I'm right. Look at how this killer-biased post is being upvoted meanwhile I'm being downvoted :)
---
Ban toxic stuff, Hahahahahaha thats impossible to do, even though its BMing its a part of the game im sorry..  
---
I always feel bad if Whispers 3 is going off after I hook someone in a corner. I know someone's waiting, but I'm too scared to look for them
---
He is fun to play, but really just a budget hillbilly
---
Games code is awful, they patched one thing, 20 other things brakes. Optimization is also awful, I play 10x better looking games on stable 60fps on higher resolution, while dbd is a unstable mess. Balance, well, nurse, what else do you need to say about balance? Just make a killer who ignores all defences survivors have againts killers. Brilliant. Events just bring the worst in this community, and it is pretty awful as it is. Grind is ok, it doesn't have microtransactions for bloodpoints, so I can accept the grind. Not getting everything on day one is ok. 
---
Found the killer main 
---
Difference is one is good and brags about, taunting and BM'ing. The other is good, but doesn't do that.
---
You're acting as if hitting the DS skill check is hard, it's not. And even with Enduring if a survivor doesn't continue running in the open after hitting DS, they can waste a lot of time even with a window or two. 
---
Oddly enough I've noticed at rank 10 the survs seem better than at r1. Thought I was imagining it lol. 
---
Ok...
---
But Nurse actually is not that fun once you get good at her. It's all killers that aren't Billy, Hag, spirit and other debatable killers.
---
But then you've got killers like Leatherface and Trapper, Clown even too now. With his large amount of bugs such as exploding hand bottles and whatever
---
We wanna play other killers. Have more variety and be less sweaty. 
---
I just dont get why you would do this glitch at all, why do this instead of grinding and having fun?
---
Honestly you did it wrong. Level the characters whos perks you want to 40. Then level the character you want to play. The less crappy perks in the pool the faster you get the ones you want. 
---
I never said that hitting the skill check was hard, it's the skill involved in actually looping that's skilful.
---
And no, not really. A window isn't gonna do much. It's your fault as killer if the survivor gets that much use out of DS. Don't pick them up unless you already have someone else slugged for pressure, or you have enough time to dribble them.
---
Go play with/against rank 15s and see if you have the same opinion
---
F13 and Last Year are totally different to DBD though
---
Michael's literally my favorite the killer to go up against and the best implemented DLC character. It's like going against the real thing, especially if he's using Tombstone. It's a privileged to be gutted by him
---
I bet you think Marth's videos are how every SWF runs, don't you?
---
Well it could stay at being a human, but disfigured and those "Entity Claws" growing out of him, that cripple the Killer's walk animation. Maybe the Killer could even use them to hunt Survivors to some extend 
---
Tbh harder to get rank 20
---
Yes. It's something that the devs tried fixing for a long time. 
---
He's not funny, and not that good at the game... So, not worth watching.
---
Geez people are too stupid to understand irony :/
---
As long as SWF is in this game we will never get anything remotely close to a deceit based killer.
---
You realise that you can just do gens and escape.
---
Survivor main who hate claudette. Interesting 
---
Unless the killer can morph into one of the 4 survivors in the lobby it wouldn't work. Seeing Frank or Julie crouching around would just make survivors say "Ya I'll go this way" and just run a mile away through a bunch of pallets while the killer puts their mask on looking like the biggest idiot in the world. That wouldn't work on a killer unless they were similar to the thing. 
---
you literally can't 'learn' legion though..
---
What argument?
---
You didn't post an argument, yet expect people to listen to it? 
---
And the Killer argument boils down to: give Survivors more to do. That's the only realistic argument Killers can provide, and it's the only suggestion that offers anything of value. Of course, that requires the Devs to actually implement something new, but in the two years since this game's release, we haven't seen any new Survivor objectives. Totems are optional, chests are optional. What else is there?
---
Bubba: Wait...that's illegal!
---
Unless you play no perks wraith or trapper it's probably considered a crutch to some people :l
---
Not when shes cloaked as a survivor. Like the pig. 
---
If its Frank's mixtape it's a DC from me
---
Buffing Prove Thyself didn't make gens faster. 
---
Gen repair received a 10% base reduction in speed. The change to *Prove Thyself* just reverts gen speed to regular gen speed before the gen repair reduction from the most recent patch.
---
I hope you reported them. They deserve death.
---
Yup but she has a game dragging head trap also. That puts pressure on survivors. Legion doesnt have any. Other than running. 😪
---
When I want to be chased and have quick games I put on my Angrypug jersey and the Jorts.  
---
Killers can't resist the tunnel. lol.
---
Someday hopefully don't hold your breath though.
---
Thanks for confirming. It's incredibly frustrating playing as killer with this. As a survivor, it only hobbles the game, but with a killer, it outright ruins it for everyone.
---
It can be surprisingly effective. Even at red ranks I have shitters who want to divebomb me before I even have a chance to walk away. When I actually do camp I either trade hooks or get a double for free.
---
I do that everyday dude. It's not hard if i'm honest. People think they need oxygen to live, like who the fuck does that?
---
The hook isn’t the only thing getting off tonight.
---
I hold my breath all the time
---
Lean on ghost and the bone clapper, make sure you always uncloak out of sight and in close reach of a survivor, get that ambush and try to use what perks you can to make chases shorter and hits harder (sloppy butcher, play with your food, etc.) and take pallet perks too, cause you'll need to swing through them and also just eat them at times. Also keep in mind that survivor mains will see you when you are cloaked and moving, so your cloak is more of a speed boost and only gives a stealth advantage at a pretty long distance, you can use this to your advantage in chases to catch up if they sprint burst way ahead considering his cloak time is nothing compared to the uncloak time.
---
Well, cleansing totems is an objective too, since it can prevent the use of Noed
---
As someone who started playing late December I'm really hyped to be rank 2 atm. 
---
7 of us started more or less together and I'm currently rank 2 with 3 others at 3, 7, 8 and it's really hype. 
---
Can you escape with the trap on?
---
I'm honestly not shocked to see this shit is still in the game.
---
Yeah it took me long enough to figure that out for some reason.
---
Me too, serious note I hope it gets fixed sooner then later.
---
With a single Windstorm, he's so goddamn fast! Very easy to pressure multiple survivors at once, keep em guessing where you're gonna appear next. Slugging is a Wraith's best friend, since his terror radius is hidden while invisible, which might bait others into coming to help the downed guy.
---
Killer mains are dumb enough to expect the whole team to cleanse totems. Can't help it 😒
---
How is that not valid?
---
Don't feel bad, you don't have to pretend they're not in the area....ut oof the amount of hate mail I've endured even after explaining how whispers works :p
---
They don't tho
---
I thought it was gonna me shirtless Myers
---
UPDATE: So apparently it completely resets everything. All your characters are now at level 1 and any teachables you had before, the only thing you retain are irredescent shards, auric cells, and the event coins. Can I get a fucking "F" in the chat please?
---
because claudettes kill me more than the killer does
---
*too
---
Because every survivor plays in swf, and every survivor in swf should try hard? 
---
Ranks don't matter, excluding ranks 15-20. That range is for actual new people, but from there on, ranks don't really mean shit.
---
welcome to DBD. It is just shitflinging and its been this way since almost the beginning.
---
&gt; Ranks don't matter, excluding ranks 15-20. That range is for actual new people, but from there on, ranks don't really mean shit.
---
Please no more. Don't slow down gen speed AGAIN. Do you want this game to be hold m1 simulator for 2 minutes per gen? The issue lies somewhere else.
---
I’ve been having this as killer a lot, and then people messaging to say they are reporting me and not believing it was a crash rather than a deliberate DC. Oh well! 
---
It's a lot faster and easier to not cleanse any and cleanse it post exit. Stop wasting valuable time and do gens or risk dying due to lack of pallets.
---
&gt; When you play killer, YOU are the only one that decides how the game goes
---
I can tell you don't play much killer. Survivors dictate the pace of the match and they always have.
---
I literally have over 3000 hours in this game, with about 50% being dedicated to killer. But no, you tell me how it works since obviously you're the expert here
---
I kind of like how you made it heart shaped. Looks pretty cool
---
Nah, play wih what the game has to offer.
---
Same reason survivors DC mid game against the nurse and ect, they want easy games 
---
It would've been better with a picture of a survivor getting a hatchet hit from a huntress
---
Yeah. Ita every connection for me. I play killer and its been since around 8 pm last night eastern. Its every single match.
---
something is wrong with everyone.
---
Yeh i understand that and I am glad that they fixed the impossible coop task.
---
Yeah, they have some of the same addons (dev laziness), but their powers fill very different roles. Leatherface is about hard punishes, while billy is about precision rushes and mobility. 
---
I'm glad they did that either, you still need to wait for it to upgrade but still, better than nothing. I'm glad i wasn't on holiday when it was bugged.
---
I'm having the same problem. Three games in a row. 
---
Horrible idea.
---
How can killers know if they are playing against a try hard team or not?  
---
Should killers try hard every time? Then people will complain about tunneling and stuff.
---
Can people stop posting this every day?You are not special.Rank 1 is so easy to reach its not even funny.
---
oh, then it might be a bug, I play on pc, haven't encountered anything of this kind
---
Same, 70% people say "thanks, nice" etc. 
---
Why the fuck are you healing versus a legion?
---
Because killers might play differently depending on how try hard the survivors are. I know I do.  
---
If I see that the survivors are doing pretty badly, I play mow relaxed, not using good tactics and just having fun, often trying to scare the survivors, but if I'm playing against a SWF team that is playing efficiently, I can't do that, but I don't know if who I'm playing against is playing well or not until most of the game is over.  
---
The simple solutions would be to either remove SWF, making everyone a solo player, or buff solo players, nerf SW and buff killers accordingly, hopefully putting everyone on somewhat even ground.
---
I’m all for the perk grind after 50 to be easier but I can settle with just having 3 (or maybe even 4) perks show up instead of two to choose from. The fact is there are just too many perks nowadays and it is ridiculous how long it takes going through webs to get the ones you want. I do like your idea though as the devs themselves have been on record saying they wanted to incentivize prestiging and a way to get perks easier is plenty reason to prestige if you ask me.
---
I obviously do. It seems like both you and OP don't. If you can't communicate with your team then you also can't blame them for not being clairvoyants.
---
If a killer chases me all game and I got hit with the noed then how is it my fault? I had no chance to do totems and my teammates are being dipshits like usual, at least they managed to do 5 generators whoop-ty-fucking-doo
---
This is Reddit. Only five percent of the people here are decent, lol
---
Just don't heal...
---
Truth 
---
Just happened to me as a survivor and earlier when I was playing killer twice wtf. I'm still connected to PSN just fine, this is rediculous...
---
Let's assume for a moment, that this was somehow a valid 'experiment'  when was this 'experiment' done.  Yesterday, last week, a year ago?  Cause if you're going to point to a team of the best of the best from a year ago (before many of the recent nerfs)  than that data is no longer relevant is it?
---
I prefer Billy, honestly. LF is certainly underrates, but the fact that he's got absolutely 0 map pressure just makes him feel slow and helpless to do anything but basically watch as the gens fly by.
---
I'm EU and last night in swf we played 2 games in 1 hour. numeurus waits were around 10 minutes just to get instantly dodged by a killer too. It was hell.
---
Because it works in every rank unless you are SWF. People always say do gens but in order to know that the survivor is being facecamped you need to go over there and check. And lets say you are on the opposite side of the map, you figure someone else will get him cause they are all closer to the hooked person, but nobody is getting him or someone gets hit and you think he is being chased so you end up going for the save, only to spend 20 seconds crossing the map to find out the killer is facecamping. Then you can run back, your teammates aswell and probably healing on top of that. Easy 2 kills atleast, often enough 3. Play slug or noed or survivors give up the game and easy 4K. It just works sadly.
---
yeah, hes one of those killers where he doesn't always work, but when he does he *really* does.
---
Upvote this for visibility.
---
I don't know. I main killer and in general the survivors are smarter as you rank up. It's not a dramatic difference, but some of the potatoes must be getting weeded out. 
---
So a perk in the game bothers you that much?A grown up man bothered by a perk in a game.Pathetic.
---
You got so lucky on those oh my very nice!
---
Survivor population is huge. Once the killer starts a lobby, 4 people will pop in and they think  it'll be a 4 man SWF.
---
Ps loading screen on pc, but the meem's nice. 
---
I want a Huntress statue dammit, but if we're talking apparel then I want the David Jacket from last year's CNY
---
Next level BM bodyblock all 4 survivors in corners with traps. 
---
That's because survivors shouldn't have to find and cleanse every totem just because there's a chance the killer could have noed
---
I played with the same group of surviors about 3 times in a row. Thing was, they weren't swf
---
PS4, once it hits around 8pm Australia time good luck finding a lobby without red ping if you’re swf.
---
Better than most tbh, i wonder if that twitch dickhead is here.
---
What does BM mean? 
---
Kinda just shows you don't know what you're talking about 
---
I love how Amanda always seems to spawn right near me and give me an OINK attack
---
Clients aren't bannable they said it in a dev stream 
---
They'll check it out
---
I don't see anything wrong with 600 IS for Rank 1. It would take someone almost 5 fucking years to even get a single character unlocked from Rank 1 IS gains in the new system
---
So the question is, do you get super healed from this?
---
How would a crosshair mean you don't have to learn huntress? You still have to learn hatchet drop, travel speed, how people dodge hatchets etc. 
---
&gt; Jason can apparently teleport now
---
from the start. He had a gogo gadgeto arm too back then to chope from 10m away.
---
Just.. crouch?
---
Actually to my amazement during the 20+ nurse games with devour hope, nobody DCed
---
To be fair there's still a lot of rng in dbd.  Also a lot of luck. Less than f13 but still there.
---
How fast you escape from traps. Kobe.  Certain overpowered tiles.  What stuff you get from chests. That's just rng though, then you have the entire luck part but that's more or less on the players.
---
that mori ritual is delicious. you shld give killer a try at least
---
Killers need is getting serious. 
---
No u
---
I am a simple man, I see Gordon Ramsay, I upvote.
---
Boosted redditor. Let people feel proud of their achievements 
---
Not since the latest F13 update, you don’t.
---
That's true, but if you look closely you'll see that the blood is baked right into the model itself on a lot of the prestige cosmetics, especially for killers. Making a second bloody version of each wouldn't be \*extremely\* difficult, no, but it is just a tiny minor improvement sitting behind a massive list of major things that the team has to work on right now.
---
You're not very good if you think that. Killers can force a lot more than people realise, but it's all down to skill level and planning.
---
Good perks for hag are stuff like MYC, Ruin, BBQ, monitor and abuse, nurses calling, sloppy butcher, enduring 
---
Do you people know who SirRodion is?
---
You could get a lot of bloodpoints just doing them rituals mate, especially those 3 since they can be completed in a single game. Try it out, you might have fun. If you don't, you atleast get loads of bloodpoints for doing it to use on your favorite survivor.
---
A little thing to practice is downing one survivor and chasing another then returning to the downed survivor to hook, they will leave objectives to heal and its still one man down, if you manage to wound 2 or down another in the mean time you have a substantial lead which can usually lead to you returning from hook to hook while the two healthy survivors run back and forth unhooking (&lt;optimal situation).  
---
Just be aware of heal time in dying state, im not sure if its this long after the healing nerf but it usually takes 30 seconds to get to 95% in dying state so if you can wrap a chase up in 20 and return to hook and possibly still find a survivor coming to heal, you have effectively tied up 3 survivors off of gens for 30 seconds.  
---
A good build i run is with Myers, i run knockout and nurses and some other shit i cant remember, but pretty much i dont waste time in EW III shouldering/transporting and hooking survivors, i down them and run around stabbing them all if i can, if the 1st survivor gets healed you can return and stab the healthy who healed them, once EWIII runs out you should have multiple survivors on the ground and the rest wounded, whom you can now track with nurses.
---
The gates get opened way too fast that's my biggest issue is that if I hook on one side of the map unless I'm wraith, Billy, nurse or huntress you just can't pressure the gate all you can do is proxy camp the nearest door 
---
I think, however poorly it was conveyed, the message is that this issue isnt usually discussed maturely, just dismissed.  
---
But personally i dont care i think the games balanced.
---
Stake outs pretty decent
---
Small game is good for swf that wanna totem hunt
---
From the Community Info glossary:
---
_BM - Bad manners. In-game actions with the sole purpose of enraging your opponent. Examples: teabagging, flashlight clicking, repeatedly hitting a hooked survivor._
---
Learning legion lol.What is there to learn.No skill involved.Have fun playing with 2 survivors every match.
---
I am trophy hunter but also suck as killer. Since I got really bored during event survivor queues, I decided to play killer and during weekend achieved most of the Adept trophies. But I wasn't really feeling like tryharding the "From the void she kills" one, so I simply send message to all my 4 survivors asking them if they will let me grab them and then farm together. But due to profile settings, I was able to contact only two of them. I found that Meg in game as first. She was the one, who doesn't get my message. She looked at me, I looked at her and noded. She noded back and started working on gen. I blinked three times, grabed her, get the trophy, then let her wiggle out of my grasp. I was so happy, that I let survivors doing their job and started looking for lanterns. In the end we had some really fun chases, they smashed some pallets on my head, I hooked them all twice, everyone got a lantern, even me, 'cause we burned 3 Red envelopes. Then escorted them to the Exit gate, since MacMillan Estate is dark and full of terror. I know it sounds just like regular farming game, but I got my trophy and now I need only two more to get Platinum. Yay!
---
No the point of totem peeks is that they can be removed
---
I agree with that, I just arrived to rank 1 yesterday and it's annoying af. Killers are sometimes too skilled and that makes the game very frustrating. Rank 1 is not fun but at least it's useful to improve your survivor skills.
---
I think it might be the same for killers.
---
as a kiler main i hate rank 1... i get bullied to smetherines... \*Ptsd kicks in\* **Flashlights... Decisive... Gen rush... Pallets...**
---
sucksucksucksucksucksucksuck
---
its from the fate series
---
Bit far don't you think.
---
Yeah fuck you.I dont care about your feelings when you play Legion with that combo.
---
i'm like 4 pips off Rank 1 survivor but my god I just keep getting either killers who tunnel hard or derpy survivors
---
ya ppl talk about how streamers are toxic but it seems most are toxic to the streamers 
---
It's just toxic survivor logic. Sacrifice them and you're a shitty killer who only got the win because you're 'cheating' (crutch perks or camping). They escape and you're a shitty noob who should uninstall the game.
---
Basically you can't win so don't bother worrying.
---
Provided you're not using exploits or actively cheating then do what you want with a clear conscience.
---
This is worth testing though... I mean... for SCIENCE!
---
If you place the syringe in the second slot, do you only heal 1 health state or two? And in the first slot?
---
Does it break the matrix and the killer can't kill you anymore?!
---
Love how you put Dipper in coldwind
---
I found the gamer girl lol
---
Her squeal after she gets stunned is too pure for this world
---
I think I'm devotion 2 level 80, and I hate the no devotion rewards 
---
Good repost have an upvote
---
it's true
---
The comment section is why I don't play the game much anymore 
---
I mean, SWF is a thing, so it completely trumps Knock Out and makes it useless. Plus, skillchecks aren't that hard to get, even with the add-ons that lower the skillcheck chance. Plus, being able to clap people awake, Bond, Empathy, and add-ons that increase the skillcheck chance, are all a thing.
---
that's literally wrong though
---
you cant say that getting pressure is just down to luck bc that's not true, especially after all of the survivor nerfs, it's not impossible to play against a 4-man co-ordinated SWF squad anymore
---
So basically u want to buff noed (that is already pretty powerful as it is) and nerf DS? Sorry my english is not the best :D
---
You're right how dare survivors try and survive 
---
It's hard to do slug builds with Freddy because being able to wake survivors up just by healing them up a health state is a thing, specifically to avoid slugging Freddies.
---
Both are nerfs.
---
NoED can no longer turn a losing game around.
---
DS is no longer an extra life.
---
You can still see Freddy with OoO, you just have to be asleep to use it. Freddy makes survivor aura-reading perks dangerous to use, because he has an aura-reading ability of his own.

I bet it's ironically. It *has* to be.
---
no it's funny
---
No, you should never use your power or else you are toxic, you should have to walk around and NEVER use EW3./s  
---
People don't like losing, they will complain about everything their opponents do.  
---
EW3 isn't needed to get kills, but if you see a fully healed survivor and you are at EW 99%, it's an easy one shot, that's just basic tactic with him though, expect mikey to one shot you if he stared at people long enough.
---
Plus, you can just walk around with your power out as Freddy, and it'll lock on to survivors who you might not even see. This is an easy way to find crouching, P3 Claudettes who you probably wouldn't have been able to find otherwise. This is especially good with the 'increase range' add-ons.
---
That person is just stupid for not knowing how fast the huntress can follow up hatchets with swings
---
Oh I see thank you very much! I sometimes teabag killers when I’m about to die and I’m the last one left and then sometimes they bring me to hatch 
---
Well after playing for a while I just decided to ignore the post game chats and community's opinion. If it's not a bannable action such as insults and hacks and abusing bugs it's all fine by me. T-bag me all you want I won't give a thing about it.
---
I'm very proud of you! Here's a star:  ★ 
---
In addition to what CrusaderFrost said, the devs have also released other killers and buffed them months/weeks after their respective releases. Huntress' issue got fixed within a few weeks. Freddy's been crap for almost ***a year and a half***. 
---
Nope it's for if the killer knocks down someone on your team that's good and your nearby, you can run up immediately after they get down and use it to bring them back to the healthy state while the killer is still in the hit animation
---
It’s not even gold.... :(
---
Conversely, survivor mains are the gray bird who is unhappy with tunneling, while the black bird says “cry some more you can’t win every time” like most killer mains. 
---
By the need to clarify what you say, indeed.
---
Ayyyy Frasier. A man of culture we have here
---
People like to claim huntress is bad, they have no idea what they are talking about
---
You want to also trap space between gens and between loops, put traps they don't expect
---
Yeah, I guess that is true
---
NO, COMMIT TO THE GEN
---
I'm also rank 2 now baby 😉 (one of the seven friends)
---
If you play solo or killer there is nothing wrong if you play SWF then you have wait time of 10 minutes 
---
Honestly I only go against like 1 legion per day which isn't too bad except for one time I went against the same guy 2 times in 4 games in both both games everyone DCed cause he was running Frank's, cold dirt 
---
Well he wasn't that good of course but he wasn't that bad either. It was around rank 8, he had four level 3 perks.  
---
Also, it involved a DS, a pallet save when he picked me up after DS, and I took the final hit just before the 5th gen popped (then I died, no regrets). I almost procced adrenaline which would have been funny but oh well...
---
this will be downvoted to hell because this is a killer sided subreddit
---
i fully agree though
---
I don't got an issue
---
Normally I DC though if I make mistakes and I haven't hooked a survivor in 2 gens. Those first 30 seconds to a minute decide the entire course of the game.
---
It's really not that good of a Perk. Also I don't see how it makes you Pip every game.
---
Wow gude for you
---
This reminds me of the 5th harry potter movie
---
&gt; Just like killers should tunnel the first survivor unhooked
---
If anyone does this, they shouldn't be surprised they get 0-1 kills per game and gens get done in 4 minutes. This is just shooting yourself and a survivor in the foot.
---
Nah not like that perk, but take for example that Ronaldo in any game can do the Elastico really well, or that Hakeem Olajuwon's signature move is a dream shake? What if every survivor had a signature spin, dodge, or a juke? It would be sick.
---
Any fix is a good fix for DS. 
---
you can see your past 15 mins of gameplay, at least on ps4
---
Sounds like you stood still before trying to unhook the person. Just keep moving and you'll unhook them no problem.
---
Well it wasn't but sure as hell proved that self fulfilling prophecies exist
---
Hey there is no such thing as a killer main Sub-reddit, we are ALL members of the dbd community and ALL have valuable input, don't disregard people because they play a role with ulterior motives to yours in game.
---
They've enough store fodder as it is. 
---
Some people decide to stop playing for the day, some realise they have survivor dailies, some go for food as I imagine an AFK killer isn't fun is it?  Some decide they wanna play survivor.  Some want to see what's in the shrine of secrets, some have shit in their life they want to deal wit, etc.
---
Will have to disagree with you here, the bs killers have mainly require them to kill someone in the first place. You can't mori someone if you can't knock them down so what else did you have is mind.
---
Also Nea is indeed bae
---
&gt; tunnelling 
---
tunnel = 4 minutes and gates are open
---
Slugging, keeping multiple survivors injured/ healing, not kicking gens during chases, running tiles correctly, NOT tunnelling, NOT camping- doing all these and getting a little lucky with the first survivor you find will all help
---
You know it!
---
Sorry but what kind of broken are we talking right know. As far as I know there isn't a single perk that's op right know.
---
Also I despise the argument "just learn how to..." that's literally what this post was about.
---
Character-wise, yes. Gameplay-wise, no.
---
Iridescent heads, omega blinks, prayer beads, insta saw, 
---
Thank you, 
---
I love both games, If our SWF can't get into games we have an alternative that is equally fun to play together.
---
The 2-3 months where Friday MM was broken has been hell, especially the last few weeks when DbD will put me in a 15 min queue just to be dodged, four time in a row.
---
Unless they fix DbD queue, I will put it on the shelf just like I did with F13 2-3 months ago. Getting back into f13 with the new rage mechanic is a bit meh, I'm not a huge fan but I'd rather swallow needles then go into a swf queue again.
---
I need a Joey version, 
---
SATISFYING 
---
Why would you get rid of their weakest link and not use them as easy leverage when you need it?
---
Mind you, slugging or having someone on hook keeps at least 2 survivors off gens assuming one is going for a save
---
Hence why tunnelling is just dogshit; survivors that just got off 1st or 2nd hook are usually gonna try to stay far away and grab a heal, and in that time you can lay on that hard pressure on other survivors who were just in their own little "gen zone"
---
No you get extra BP from the event which allows you to go over 32k
---
I haven't played today but it's either 9 or 8, Goodluck when you come back
---
4%? Damn, then it's lower that I thought. I thought that the chance for escaping was around 10%.
---
Yeah, I usually just wait on the hook until someone comes and saves my butt but I'm glad that at least we have that percentage to save ourselves in desperate situations.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you're either a killer main or someone that plays killer more than you do survivor. 
---
I think if totems are supposed to be a necessary secondary objective then they should have a counter like gens? I think 5 spawn per map, so unless you’re doing a 4 person SWF with voice coms there’s no way to know how many have been done, or even how many spawn in the first place.
---
I think her crosshair is dead centre of the screen ?
---
well yeah but you are gonna find them again eventually, and when your pressure is good, they will be forced off gens to help their teammates where you can target them instead 
---
Or if you're within a certain distance the health reduction speed is slowed so there's a larger window of opportunity to punish them
---
"Can't remember the last time anyone escaped through the exit gates when playing a killer" Well aren't you badass. Do you tell girls at the bar what a pro killer you are?
---
Exactly. Love how this sub is full of killer mains acting like they're innocent. Both sides are just as bad as each other.
---
Yes ok but I said "and survivor".
---
Uuuuuuughhhhh. I hate missing skill checks while healing. The sound of something breaking and the grunts of pain is like... uuuughhhh. (Great detail by the devs there.)
---
But is nice to know that. I knew that a exploding generator wakes you up (which I find pretty hilarious xD ) but having an alternate method of waking up is always nice.
---
There's a couple things you could do for the killer too, maybe harder breathing, or have vision look really cool (even though it's debuffed) maybe visually have them start swaying back and forth? I don't know, have fun with it.
---
So what happens here ? Can you no longer level up ?
---
That is a good thing to know. I am still far from leveling up Claudette to level 45 to get all the teachable perks, but I was already wondering who I should start using next.
---
Thanks for letting me know, I will check him!
---
I rather make it so it doesnt progress if the killer was facecamping. 
---
I just eat it if I got pressure, and juggle if they're the first down
---
I can't honestly say I've ever seen DS change the course of a game, except in the case where the killer is just bad and got people downed by a fluke
---
Maybe he’s gay ?
---
hahahha lemme just equip purple med kit..yeah umm add the purple agent and red syringe and voila !, snap a pic gotta add a caption, hmm my dumbass friends took this to a match LOL !! free karma boi
---
I did a Fraj meme too!! Good show. Have my upvote. 
---
On her behalf I'd like to say this idea will never happen ever.
---
People who prefer children to stay in fortnite. Also game devs and Most likley his parents care that his playing a pg18 game as a 12y/o.
---
Oh god u/HalfLardo3 watches anime
---
survivor sided.
---
It ends on the day of rank reset, the 13th.
---
Actually happened to me like, 2 weeks ago! I was playing killer and I hooked a Feng, but she just didn't die. The weirdest thing was, I didn't get stunned by pallets, I couldn't destroy them, I couldn't vault windows, I couldn't pick up dying survivors and so on. In the end, the Feng DC'd and the others escaped. They were pretty chill about it and we all laughed about it!
---
Personally I think this would solve nothing and be ridiculous.
---
It takes 80 seconds to do a gen solo, so this is going to trigger every match. If you want it to work, I’d say trigger if two are done in 60 seconds or something shorter, that way it discourages people working on the same generator.
---
Secondly, wouldn’t this just make things harder for killers? The breaker activated and you’ve now got to run between the shack and the wall breaker, find and regress generators, and look for survivors?
---
Fails to facecamp so dc. Makes sense
---
0:27
---
It looks like the Huntress just flipped the middle finger to the survivor, like: *"that's what you get for BMing, BTCH"*
---
It will progress if you were the last survivor and if the generators were fixed. 
---
nrad
---
Yup. I personally can’t wait to spend more time sitting holding a button and occasionally pressing another button. A generator takes 80 seconds as is, I would probably stop playing if it got much longer just due to how boring it’d be to sit there and do nothing for most of a match
---
Fastest way to level up? Or most efficient way to grind out points? Buy leatherface, level him and unlock the BBQ and Chili perk as a teachable. Apply this perk to every killer you can.
---
I'm no expert, and I'm sure someone might be able to help with player level specifically, but in case you're interested in blood point increases I can give my own recommendation!
---
For survivors: David King has a perk called "We're going to live forever", basically everytime you rescue a fellow survivor from a hook you earn a token. Each token increases the bloodpoints you receive at the end of the match. There's a cap to the tokens (I believe 2) but it can be a huge boost, especially if you combine it with an offering that also boosts your blood points.
---
On the Killer Side: Leather Face (the cannibal) has a perk called barbecue and chilli. Whenever you hook a survivor, you see the auros of other survivors further than 40m (at rank 3 I believe). But the really nice feature is that for every individual player you hook, you gain stolen (maxed at 4). Each token gives a flat percentage boost of additional blood points at the end of the match, which again can be huge if you also burn a bloodpoint boost offering.
---
Using those perks I usually get anywhere from 25k min per match to 50k bloodpoints per match! 
---
I hope this helps!
---
play the game normally, match length I think is weighted the most on xp but not sure.
---
Thanks a lot man, and you got this, just takes some time
---
What kind of argument is that? Survivors have tremendously useful perks compared to killers. Killer perks don't allow much room for variation at red ranks. Survivors get tons of free stuff.
---
I've been saying this for ages and no one's listened. YES ultrarare survivor addons are very strong but they aren't gamechanging. Purple and pink addons are so damn easy to get it's unbelievable. It's guarenteed to get about 5 or 6 purples per lvl 50+ blood web and an ultra rare 2/3 times. And during events god it's horrible. The devs talked about BP economy and everyone laughed at them but now I see what they're saying. During the christmas event I got around 50 (most likely more) ultrarares for my killers, thats 16 hours straight of unfair, easy 4k's. In total all the ultrarares I have could last months.
---
No animeposting begone weeb
---
Except the only thing that is currently available to survivors to actually survive is to loop. 
---
Your argument would be pretty solid if looping wasn’t required to do shit against decent killers. 
---
Nurse completely ignores all core escape mechanics that survivors have at base. Due to this it’s nearly impossible to balance her properly without making her utter garbage or completely overpowered as she is currently. 
---
Except Myers tier 1 and Freddy too I believe won't be affected by this. 
---
Man i feel bad, i always thought that meant thanks for the game. :(
---
Okay so I just started reading this with ruin. 
---
You say ruin is necessary at the higher ranks, but also your idea to buff it is to make it not grant the great skill check bonus? If you’re good enough to hit great skill checks, and cleaning ruin grants no bonus - why bother? Just hit the ruin checks. At the higher ranks ruin is useless imo since survivors are generally good enough at hitting great skill checks not to affect it much. At the lower ranks? Sure, higher ones? Not that important. Higher up I’ve gone, less I’ve encountered ruin or when I have found it, it’s not made that big of a difference 
---
I don't understand.
---
Also an issue I keep having is the fast sensitivty I even turned it down to 5% and it was still incredibly fast like it hadn't changed is it meant to do that on console to copy the PC mouse if so I can't handle it.
---
Well i stopped maybe 2 months ago, didnt really miss it any minute :) 
---
I noticed a similar issue as survivor. Few days back I’d get points for unhooking a lantern and every so many seconds I’d get some more for holding onto it. Not been getting those. Not sure if I missed something or I’m having issues
---
I did it that way. I leveled all the chars I want perks from, but at this point I am at level 50 with all characters I actually wanna play and don't have any setup ready
---
:error failed connection:
---
Although i do agree that people often underestimate how much power the killer has, survivors definitely have more than the killer. For example: pressure. To pressure someone off a gen you need to commit to a chase, you can't just gently shoo them away. While you are in the chase you can be sure that at very least one person is occupied, while 3 others do gens. This basically puts the killer on a timer. Unless you hook someone, you are losing gens. It's the only real secondary objective (totems aren't, deal with it). And even then, a coordinated team will send only one person to unhook, while two others do gens. You see what i mean? Even though maps and killers (conditions, basically) change every game, the surv's objective always stays the same, and how fast the game goes entierly depends on their actions.
---
Plus that means that you don't actually play a game of DbD. Not really.
---
Respect none!
---
Hag with BBQ. As easy as it gets. ~50k per match. Doc is outdated as a farming killer and Legion is harder than Hag to actually get those points.
---
If you don't want to play killer you need Prove Thyself and We're Gonna Live Forever
---
I would love to see the DC stats and match ratings on Legion hosted matches. I'm pretty sure Legion games are rated lowest / DC'd the most.
---
Not so sure about that! But yea prob a cheater.
---
This... it pains me to see all those streamers wasted!
---
It makes sense a killer can hit through the window if the survivor is close enough
---
I'm killer main. I'm perfectly happy with 8 hooks and 0 sacrifices.
---
Well she’s just the one I’m using for this event at least, I usually play Kate who I have at prestige 3
---
Had a game the other day where i got the exit gates open and was waiting there at them, with a vessel on, killer turned, looked at me, i didnt tbag or flashlight or emote or anything.  He DCd
---
Ok I got it wrong then sry for confusion and I agree with noed turning the game around and ds can be annoying. I personelly dont use either one
---
Then you are pretty lucky in your region IMO. Since it is easy to get coin progression survivor side, potato killers and survivors surface all the more. Either it is a one sided generator rush with no one hooked or the first to be found gets camped/patrolled on their first hook and subsequently tunneled the shit out of them. I'm lucky to even have as much as 16 points since some survivors for some reason don't even do generators or are downed faster than your queue times. God damn I really hate this event.
---
Are people finally starting to realize tunnelling and gen rushing are different sides to the same coin? I've been downvoted several times stating this very thing.
---
It used to be the same for me when I first started playing at the start of last year. I didn’t know the ropes yet, but with practice and patience you’ll be escaping in no time. You’re going to have a learning curve on each new game you play, against each killer because the game isn’t only about survival, for me at least, but it’s about adapting to the different killers and learning how to avoid/ run them. It’s a great game tho, don’t let this dishearten you.

I can believe that. The only killer I can see coming close is the doctor
---
This sounds like a really fun idea. 
---
I disrespect Pig by outstealthing her with Urban Evasion. I see you crouching, I see that big ass red thing moving. Also Spine Chill.
---
It's pretty difficult to remain in high killer levels without depipping. You NEED to hook some people or you get a -1. Just chasing, hitting and kicking gens might be 'fair play' but this game rewards that with a -1 pip. Hel, even getting a couple of hooks and a 1K will just let you stay at 0.
---
Most games from level 7 on will have the first 2 gens popped within a minute and 1 or 2 survivors trying hard to distract you. 
---
So the other day I encountered a p3 Trapper and he set traps around random corners of the jungle gyms that you'd sneak around or cut close to during a chase and on the edges of the maps by trees. I always encounter the Trapper's traps by a hooked survivor or by windows or pallets. It was refreshing and, after getting caught in 2 and (fortunately) finding 2 set in really strategic placings, I complimented his trap-laying ingenue. The p3 Trapper wrote back that he never plays trapper so he's flattered. What the hell bro? I'm out here trying to be the change I want to see in the community.
---
F13 has perks, so its just dbd with no killer and ways to actually defend yourself without needed a hunk of wood 
---
This happens to me all the time. I accept mistakes were made and go accepting my immediate hook.
---
lord no i could never be a claudette
---
I've read somewhere about someone suggesting Chucky as a killer! But then wondering how would he carry and hook survivors haha
---
Done that and they d/c. 
---
It’s horrible, I love this game but I wish it wasn’t so horribly refined  
---
*oinks in reverse bear trap*

Good tip! Will take it into consideration!

Hmmm i sure wonder who is behind these shenanigans 🤔🤔🤔
---
Not sure if you are being sarcastic, it's quite tough to read an undertone.
---
I'm not saying the visual information isn't good on it's own. I'm just saying if it weren't for the points, I would not use this perk on every killer I play. If they were to make the points a standard feature, I'd definitely run different perks (namely Whispers) or substitute it for synergy if Whispers was already part of my build anyways (Enduring, Brutal Strength, Spirit Fury and Bamboozle is probably one of my favorite combinations, the thing is it doesn't feel worth it because I'm only getting half the points each game and I'm playing for points and prestiging my killers in the first place)
---
Great art, but he isn’t that skinny!😂
---
Can confirm that solo is also long wait times
---
If you think looping has no counter, you haven't even begun to become competent at playing killer. You maybe have an argument if you specified Coldwind, though.
---
Only people who haven't played the game much think that Freddy is OP.
---
Almost everyone thinks he's annoying as fuck to play against though.
---
You’re one of the swf’s that leave ransoms to die. 
---
):&lt;
---
Was my point. He isnt great, but according to SWF P3 Claudettes, every killer is OP and Unfair, yknow?
---
Not enough killers to go around, most likely.
---
pretty good job so far
---
It gives killers a bit more control other than following survivors around gens. 
---
survivors could use it too since they can repair multiple gens at the same time.
---

---
If you want a braindead killer that's S Tier you should probably go for Legion with mixtapes and run backwords after injuring people with your Frenzy. 
---
It's literally inescapable. 
---
it doesn't work it was at 100% and when I switched it down to 5% it still feels like it's at 100% I had this problem with it not changing with ghost recon wildlands, I'm guessing no matter the speed you select it's always gonna be fast because it's killer VS survivor?
---
You need to play the offering to get bloodpoints.
---
Thanks for your reply! Very helpful :)
---
..why dying light?
---
You ever tried running Enduring? Enduring alone is a perk that shits on pallets.
---
Get some Spirit Fury going and slam Bamboozle on it to shit on windows as well and they can't really do a thing. If you are running this combination it only depends on the map and whether there are long pathways between pallets. 
---
I just bought ~~leatherface~~ BBQ and Chili so that'll have to wait.
---
I did but while I was in a chase without perks (not sure when you unlock them) I was still getting caught and hooked I equipped the flashlight in main menu but the flashlight didn't appear on screen in game so I couldn't see it.
---
No, I just know when to cut my losses. I’ll try to save randoms, but I’m not going to stick around if the killer is proximity camping, I know one of us is going to die in that situation because I’m trash and don’t run borrowed time, so yeah, I’ll leave the Random to die on the hook if there’s nothing I can do, but I’ll gladly trade places for a friend or try to run the killer and such. I’m just bad and will get us both killed if I try to go for a solo save with the killer right there
---
Best perk in the game if you want to level things up. 
---
I rather stay in rank 1, than low ranks. My experience in low ranks was: lagswitchers, hackers, survivors that don't do anything and die in 1 sec(for some reason every russian I get matched with is a hacker), atleast in high rank it's rare to see hackers and when you get someone with 60 ping match is fine, no lags, but in low ranks get someone with 60 ping and for some reason the moment you spawn killer tps to you, you run without killer in sight and get downed and then suddenly you appear on hook I often even witnessed killer \*insert harry potter meme music\* disappear into thin air just to appear behind my friend. 
---
I mean with all gens popped I consider camping (the staying close kind not facecamping) fine, there doesn’t seem like much of a point in letting them get a save while you’re across the map pushing other survivors out. Secure that kill at least
---
Maybe you are switching tje wrong sensitivity. You can change it for Killer and Survivor, maybe you are changing it for killer
---
The HEX totems can still be cleansed even if they're extinguished, finding them on the other hand might be a little harder ;)
---
what do you guys think?
---
Says the guy using mori and ruin lmao
---
I agree the brown bag would be good with the Trapper and not op. My above comment was replying to the person who said that the Trapper should have all of their traps at the start of the match - similar to the Hag. 
---
I was being sarcastic indeed.
---
It's not that I don't believe you, but statistically it's a very low chance that someone would just run it for points. Not that it never happens though. Personally I find it a bit funny when I see different streamers saying "oh, it's for points only" and then zooming in with Billy/Nurse/anyone else across the map for a quick down. 
---
Then you have people who say "I got my 4 stack, I am happy" and guess what, next time they hook someone, they are engaged in the next chase almost immediately simply because of the perk that gives points. Don't get me wrong, this perk is good for points. But I can guarantee you that at least 98% of players run it not just for stacks, but for the certain information. 
---
I run Distortion on all of my survivors. It procs in all of my matches at red ranks. Every single killer I match up with runs BBQ. I don't complain whatsoever, I can counter it pretty easily, but it still makes me chuckle when I hear people saying "I run BBQ only for points". 
---
I get the issue with the whole ruin is being found instantly thing, but I really don't think having to waste an entire perk slot, just to prevent that from happening is the long-term solution. Especially since thrill of the hunt already exists and serves as a totem protector already.
---
Anybody that says "it doesn't give me exactly what I want" is a child, period. Only kids want to be given "everything they want" and not want to earn it, period.
---
You don't have to prestige a character, if you do it's purely on YOU for wanting COSMETICS!!! So prestige should NOT be considered part of the 'grind"
---
You can earn most of the best perks with shards. If you really need one special perk, and it doesn't pop up.....here's a real brain buster....get that one character to level 40 and it will pop up in their bloodweb as teachable...easy peezy.
---
I play this game very casually, and I have my three main characters at level 50 with all the perks I care about. I'm not gonna prestige them because I don't give a rip about cosmetics...has ZERO effect on gameplay.
---
This game is only a grind to people with OCD that absolutely just NEED every perk and every character to be P3. A company should not pander to kids with OCD!
---
Is that Sans undertale?
---
Your next goal should be devotion 6 rank 9
---
People at rank 12-6: Killer and Survivor diversity. Perk diversity. More cat and mouse tactics. More altruism in the good sense. People trying new stuff. Mild DC out of frustration. 
---
People at red ranks: There are three killers in the game. There are 8 killer perks and a total of 8 addons between them. There are only 6 survivor perks. There are no chases. It’s either on person stupidly follows the other for 3+ minutes or a chase is over in less that 10 seconds. Slugging for 4K. Slugging the last two despite 5 gens being up. Frequent DC. Increased BM. A cool looking emblem and achievement for doing it the first time. Farming off the hook, but no Borrowed Time because it’s not one of the 8 perks you’re allowed to have. 
---
 The HEX totems can obviously still be cleansed even if they're extinguished, finding them on the other hand might be a bit more challenging ;)
---
Done this with billy before so fucking satisfying
---
That moment when this was my very first thought and I had to scroll through the whole comment section to see if anyone else has said the very same thing already lol.
---
I do dull totems when looking for hexes anyway. Gotta avoid that noed. 
---
The HEX totems can obviously still be cleansed even if they're extinguished. Finding them, on the other hand, might be a bit more challenging ;)
---
Yeah I am the same, red ranks and never use Ruin. I never saw the point as they either destroy it asap or just hit greats.

I've crashed once, most lobbies I connect to, the killer dodges. Which really sucks tbh
---
Imagine if you just bought a fresh copy of DBD with all the DLC. All of my character's are at LVL 1 for both killers and for survivors, the only thing I retained was my iridescent shards, auric cells, player rank, player devotion rank, and that's it. None of my teachables were retained, none of my player levels were retained, none of my prestiged characters from before were retained. A fresh start.
---
It really annoys me when people act like and doesn't mean anything at all.
---
It doesn't necessarily mean every survivor you get will be better, it just means that, generally speaking, you will play against better survivors. Apparently this is difficult for some people to understand. 
---
You are so fixated on the difficulty of the skillcheck you ignore everything being said here. Sure it's not hard, but if your team is not good and you cannot continue a chase due to lack of pallets or just being in a bad spot will make DS a minor inconvenience at best even if you get striked multiple times. Also you need to realize how much pressure and wasted time having a survivors slugged can create since, meaning there is no harm leaving the obsession downed if you don't want that DS to hit you just yet, at one point someone has to leave gen duty to get them up, by that point you can either find that survivor and chase them leaving someone else to leave a gen or pressure the other survivors doing a gen. It sounds hard and impractical but trust me it can be so worth it,but only through trial and error can you learn how effective it can be and when/how to do this.
---
To be fair, BBQ isn’t too helpful on Pig.
---
Are you the guy who posts the same question on random pictures?
---
It's two-edged sword to be honest. Yes, you can't apply mindgames as a Killer due to that. But on the other hand neither does the Survivor. It's not like it's a purely killer biased disadvantage tho.
---
I never get tired of these clips.
---
Yeah, but if you can see through walls, the survivor doesn't *need* to mindgame. They can just run the loop like a robot and never get punished for it.
---
Maybe it's your perception because I have NEVER heard of that problem. Also you should be increasing the  sensitivity, not lowering it. The inverted camera thing is indeed a bug but it is very rare.
---
No, this is my first time asking this.
---
Definetly true, but on the other hand Coldwind doesn't have that many loops in comparasion to other maps as MacMillan. It's more or less a compensation. Less loops that requiere more time, or average amount of loops that requiere the average amount of time. Atleast that's my personal guess of the thought behind it.
---
I’ve found that survivors are more reckless at rank 1. Every one just swarms the killer and makes silly moves and then I’m like damn it guys now I have to come save your asses and die too!! 
---
Interesting. I saw the exact same quesrion asked on another picture 5 min ago
---
That spirit has gotta be like, "WHAT?!"
---
good job papi
---
This is a little off topic but I feel like when Frank made Susie stab the cleaner he wrapped his hands around hers with his knife in her hands and made the most "Don't test me" face.
---
&gt;WGLF is sort of underpowered in comparison to the killer counterpart of BBQ and Chili.
---
OP compares WGLF and BBQ and says WGLF should be buffed because BBQ is better. What kind of argument is that?
---
You don't balance an asymmetrical game like that. Yes, Survivors will have perks that benefit their objective or the way they play and so will Killer. But if you have 2 similar perks that serve the same purpose (in this case we're talking about bloodpoints) you don't make them on the same power level. This *doesn't* mean that Survivors can't have powerful perks. But you can't compare 2 similar perks on either side and say they should be equal in power. This also doesn't mean that WGLF can't be buffed in some way.
---
I'm arguing that the logic of "The power side's perk is good so the other side's perk should be just as good" is a terrible argument balance-wise. Plus, OP's suggested buff is terrible because it overlaps with Breakdown's purpose. Making 2 perks that do the same thing doesn't make any sense.
---
The worst thing about it is when randoms decide to report you for disconnecting, which'll lead onto you getting a temp-ban for something that's not even your personal fault.
---
Have been a victim of this already.
---
It's far worse when you consider that long wall jungle gyms, or jungle gyms with a window in general, can spawn, and their only counterplay is to mindgame them, usually. Loops on Coldwind don't just take an above average amount of time with a decent survivor. They take an obscene amount more time compared to the average loop in another map.
---
Sometimes people just don’t know. But the people running Bond know better. However, official fuck you to people who do that shit running Empathy, cause the amount of times they’ve traded the killer’s attention with my bleeding no self care ass is astounding.
---
This means a facecamper can actually hold you hostage on hook no matter what. 
---
&gt;Foxtrot
---
I have to agree, the dress is nice, and so is the weapon, but the head just doesn't sit as well as the Momma Bear cosmetic with me.
---
(Remembers L4D and shakes head in resignation)
---
Wouldn't lag switchers technically be just as big of a problem in red ranks? I mean if they're doing it, they're probably consistently getting 4 kills and probably should be high ranked in no time.
---
Also I doubt they'd care about deranking, not like the survivors can do anything about it other than DC whether they're rank 20 or 1.
---
I've only seen 1 lag switcher though so I don't have a clue if it's more common or not in lower ranks than in higher ones. 
---
Same goes for Nurse, with the little but important difference that Nurse requieres somewhat of skill. Legion on the other hand...Well.
---
That killer is genuinely the worst killer I’ve ever seen. 
---
I would argue that lowering running speed while back pedalling would stop that. Other than that and the locker detection, I agree wholeheartedly 
---
I get the frustration of teammates wasting time, but I think your post has some misdirected anger friend.
---
If you’re being facecamped, them not saving you isn’t cowardly; it’s smart. AS LONG AS they’re doing gens instead. Wasting time hiding in a locker or crouching near you is stupid, cowardly, and annoying. But them saving you against a facecamper wouldn’t be brave, it would be dumb. The only reason they’re idiots is for not doing gens. So in that regard, I feel your pain!
---
He's too powerful to be a survivor! The killers are in danger! The Entity's in danger!
---
I have noticed killers DC for no reason also. 
---
Hrrrngh colonel, I’m trying to sneak around with this lantern, but I’m dummy thicc and the Legion keeps spitting my aura...
---
I’ll run empathy for flashlight saves. I won’t screw over other survivors unless they screw me over first.
---
Medium vaults seem to make you smack the window but fast vaults seem to have a bigger hitbox.
---
Love it 
---
Ah I see, what I meant is that the perk to make gens progress extremely fast along with tool boxes would be hard to handle. 
---
Don’t forget charging up a blink and then looking at the ground so survivors literally run right into you while you don’t actually move.
---
Wrong. Killers have four objectives. Apply pressure, hook survivors, defend objectives, and prevent escape. All by any means necessary, even underhanded tactics. 
---
awwwwwwww
---
Don’t do sprintburst and lithe together. They are exhaustion perks so if you activate sprint burst you can’t get lithe to activate
---
Remember: If you’re playing solo survivor, do yourself a favor and run Kindred. If your teammates are too brain dead to stay on task while being able to see each other’s auras, then you were never gonna escape, but with real teammates, not only can you severely punish a Facecamp but also prevent a brain dead 4K since even at red ranks, survivors will literally throw themselves at a hooked player. 
---
Probably the entity
---
Oink-ku UwU
---
The art about being a successful Killer is by being capable to decide when to mindgame and when to bluntly follow like a rabbid dog. In terms of the double L walls for example Survivors are on a definitive advantage when the Killers attempt to mindgame. When you simply run after them tho, and prefer consistency over the bare chance to cut some time, you'll mostly save up more time at jungle gyms than attempting mindgames. Vault after them if you vault, don't attempt to cut ways. I know that it's blunt as fuck, but in the end it's more efficient in some scenarios.
---
This game is extremely overwhelming to all new players friend! You aren’t alone. It took me many months to get even remotely good at this game. What helps is knowing when to take a step back from the game. That was my biggest mistake; not knowing when to stop. I’d get mad cuz I always got caught first (and usually died first), but I’d keep playing games in my rage-induced state, which made me sloppier, which meant I played stupid and got downed even faster. Then I’d get even more salty and the cycle would continue. This game requires patience and time to master! It won’t always seem so daunting!
---
It's quite easy to tell apart imo. A genuinely bad internet is lagging (jittery) or delayed most of the time consistently, even when nobody is being chased - inputs still work though. Lag switcher's internet only becomes bad/cuts out when they see someone or start chasing them, no inputs work whatsoever and it returns to normal when you're downed. 
---
Huh? He's like the second most used male character on PS4. 
---
That's a good idea as well, I would not mind that either 
---
DBD Fraj memes. I love it.
---
I love my Fastening Tools. Can I has my Fastening Tools?
---
How are survivors on a definitive advantage at an L-wall? You run the inside way, then you run around the outside way, then they have to vault the wall. It's a 50/50. You call their bluff and moonwalk it in the same direction you've been moving, winning the 50/50 if they fake it, or you moonwalk back the other direction and win if they vault it. It's just a coin flip.
---
The problem with just following like a rabid dog is that you can be looped for god knows how long, especially at a jungle gym with a window. The problem with Coldwind is that it forces you to follow like a rabid dog and removes any form of killer skill from an equation, besides just knowing how to run the loop like a robot efficiently.
---
I mean I agree but taking the game hostage is ban-able. I’m fine with t bagging or facecamping or stuff like that. Things that are rude but don’t break the game. That’s fair. Hell its funny sometimes. But the whole trapping someone in a corner and keeping them there is anti fun and the people who do that shouldn’t be allowed to play with the rest of us
---
You might want to consider switching targets at least in the beginning especially if you run sloppy butcher. It really slows the game down when your chasing someone and 2-3 of the others have to heal 
---
Use time=1.5 seconds
---
Just tweak it so hexes don't glow for the first 20 seconds? 
---
There are people here that copy comments they like and spam them everywhere to get karma
---
You’re right, my bad I missed few things in the post making it have to meanings. Well saving a face camped survivor is dumb only when you do it wrong. best way to deal with face camper is to do it in pairs one protects other unhooks. Ofcourse the might be some some problems with it such as noed and other but it is still to cooperate than do it alone. 
---
Well maybe I’m angry becouse I treat randoms as sfw. Expecting way too much from randoms :/
---
Agreed. Do gens when someone is being facecamped. It's the only way to stomp out the camping bullshit. We must unite in this, brothers and sisters. Seriously, though. Can gen rushing when campers are camping be the only made up survivors rule that we all follow?
---
They do. Maybe try playing a couple killer games and you can learn a bit of how it is for them and it will make you a better survivor. 
---
Fucking ouch. I regret everything
---
It's not just the corn, although, seriously, fuck the corn. It's that, it's the walls that you can see through, and it has some of the worst loops in the game with those stupid stone walls. It's like those maps are designed solely as a big middle finger to killers. The only map I'd like to play on less than any of the Coldwind ones is the Grim Pantry, because fuck that map.
---
Every time this happens it's like, "SERVES YOU RIGHT."
---
As others have said, spend as little bloodpoints on each web as possible. Only try to buy brown and yellow nodes, and be smart about the order you buy them in. Also, We’re Gonna Live Forever is incredible. On tier 3, if you get 4 saves, it doubles your bloodpoints. Offerings, of course, help also. Also make sure you’re playing a well rounded game. Do at least 1 gen (aim for 2), go for at least one heal or save, get chased some, and do your best to escape (duh). Also play with friends and stack envelopes and streamers (: Or ask people in the lobby to stack em’
---
I know. I just thought you were the same person and I was careless enough not to remember to look at your /u
---
Yes, WGLF is superior but I was saying that it should be the one we use cause it doesn’t promote farming people. PT now encourages cooperation in all fields.
---
you know that the biggest Content creater are/were Ochido and Noob3, followed by Monto?
---
Those are the spots I need to learn.
---
I agree. I deranked on purpose as a killer because in my mind the ranking system is flawed. I’m a rank 2 Myers main, but I’m a rank 20 Nurse. So I deranked so I could learn her in a better playing environment.
---
I don’t harass them though.. I spend most of the map just practicing blinks and nodding at survivors. They get their lanterns and leave lol. 
---
Once I get a better understanding of nurse, I’ll leave. Probably after the event
---
I'm rank 1 Killer Main since Season 1.
---
If my rank drops &lt; 5 i play Nurse, Huntress and Billy most of the time to have the ability to crush arrogant/tea bagging survivors.
---
Watch the video of truetalent where hes against Rank 1 SWF (playing nurse)- they rushed the gens in a few mins and GG.
---
Killer is hard to play against equally skilled survis.
---
Wait so you are saying the best strat is to not chase? If a survivor runs out of my trap zone do I abandon chase? That sounds like a really bad idea and really campy.
---
Well he does really well score wise ... and his daily is cake walk too.
---
Extra BP doesnt help lol? /s
---
:-)
---
Salts a way of life
---
I'm aware, but fail to see your point. I did not say "the top 3 content creators". Besides, Monto is on the second one.
---
They don't, but if you run an L-wall correctly, the other wall won't matter because they'll only reach it if they win a 50/50. You run it in such a way that you cut it off.
---
&gt; They could also simply get out of there while you're on the other side of the wall, having the chance to reach another pallet in the meantime.
---
Only if they run away and you double back, yes. Which is, again, a 50/50.
---
[Here's a very simple diagram of an L-T wall.](https://i.imgur.com/IZTDiUB.png)
---
The green line is the Survivor, and the red line is the Killer. The Survivor approaches the L-T wall by running and vaulting the window. As a Killer, you turn right and run around the window, in between both the walls, cutting off their option to turn to the right and run to the other wall. They're forced to turn left off of the vault, and vault the window again, at which point, you're behind the wall, and [they have a choice of either vaulting the window, or running to the other wall.](https://i.imgur.com/leCizx4.png) Both of which are beaten by you going the same direction as them by guessing. Running to the other wall can also be replaced by running to a pallet, which, again, if you guess correctly, you'll still hit them before they make it anywhere. L-wall T-Walls are always a 50/50 if you run them correctly.
---
&gt; the very end a good Survivor will always keep an eye on you and properly react to your gameplay.
---
That's the problem with Coldwind. Other maps, *you can't do that because you can't see the killer behind the wall.* You can't react in time to seeing them come around the corner.  On Coldwind, you can, because you can watch them through the wall.
---
And yeah, Shack is different because you can force the pallet drop without any mindgames by following a simple flowchart, which also happens to be the fastest way to get them to drop it.
---
&gt; Follow them until they get inside. Listen for a vault. Did they vault? Double back and run around the outside where the window is. Did they keep running? Keep going through the shack and they'll be forced to drop the pallet or take a hit.
---
yeah not a bad idea lol
---
Found the survivors main.
---
Theres a guy on youtube that has a very small channel, but he is one of the few people that still main Hag and one of the best Hags I've seen, if I can find him again I'll drop you a link since he comments everything he does and gives tips on how ACTUALLY play Hag
---
If you are still into F13, Jason cannot be stunned in rage unless you have high strength and a strong weapon. So thankfully, Chad with a wrench can't run you around a couch and then quick smack you to run to another house.y
---
But now it's harder to stun him when you use the sweater... either super bugged or intended because Tommy with an Axe hardly works anymore.

BBQ is an omni-perk, and I'm curious as to why you think it isn't good on pig?
---
HUNTRESS IS THE FUNNEST KILLER
---
Why? Because he yells at other people and makes them feel bad?
---
I didn't press anything, I got hooked and kept pressing the button to get me off of it, when a teammate freed me my camera inverted for no reason.
---
Because if rank is meaningless then he shouldn't see a difference when playing with/against a low rank team. I can tell you however as someone who has had that match up that there is a big difference between a rank 1 and a rank 15 team
---
What about the survivors that don't run d strike+instaheal
---
Hey hey hey there , I see there's no man or wamen of culture here .
---
Ohh, ok ok. That's good to know. I will check them out then. Thanks!
---
This depends on the team and the rank.  Killer skill floor is very low, so killers absolutely dominate at low ranks.  When you get higher that starts to disappear.
---
Boil over with your DS version would work greatly. I like that idea.
---
My first and last Nurse game was at Coldwind Farms and I didnt even lay eyes on a survivor that's how hard I sucked.
---
My perception how rude, Funny thing is I don't have this issue with Rainbow 6 siege or call of duty, when I turn the sensivity down there you can feel a big difference, putting sensitivty on the lowest setting actually works on those games and will turn slowly, yet dead by daylight when i put it on low nothing changes and it's still fast.
---
you must be trolling
---
Yeah, that's not a bad idea. I like playing as the killer, but I am pretty bad at it xD
---
(Also I get dizzy from the First Person view, so I can't play killer for much time)
---
?  I power through ruin.  Sloppy is basically useless.  Both are child perks... But they ruin the game for a lot of people.  Lots of DC.  Lots of people who just don't have fun.  It's devs fault ultimately.
---
Betcha a YouTuber will do it to try and get notability
---
Happy birthday
---
Yeah same, I don't come home until Thursday myself so couldn't even if I wanted to play more
---
I agree. I've watched both, I wouldn't exactly recommend the first one. But the second one is still a response to the first one, so if you want a little bit more context it's watchable.
---
I can be fun :(
---
unless if escaping to the hatch, you can’t
---
If it would excactly happen like you calculate it then you're actually right, yes. But in the very end Survivors are also capable of faking vaults. When you're forcing the Survivor to vault, you'll obviously head for the other side of vault to cut of 'em. Simple as that. But if you're already moving onto the other side while the Survivor approaches the vault (as you obviously read that they're attempting to vault) and they actually don't, but head do a 180 turn and leave the L-T wall with you on the other side, they still have a pretty nice gap and thus another chance to reach a pallet and extend the chase.
---
And in regards to the shack, Killers should stop anticipating Survivors to stay at one spot. Sure, like 95% of the Survivors actually do so. But that's simply because they underestimate how impact full a location-switch can be if timed well. When you're at the non-pallet entry of the shack, and they vault, they can simply head of immediately instead of attempting to play around the very pallet. The shack pallet is immensely powerful anyway so you should get as much value out of it as possible, which obviously depends on the Killers current positioning.
---
But that's the very thing about mindgames after all, the only thing you can do is read, receive a reply and taking actions. It would obviously be much simpler if everything runs as calculated.
---
Depends on the achievement, adept achievements do count DCs as sacrifices but achievements like evil incarnate will be ruined by a disconnect.
---
How is that rude? You're having a problem nobody has had in 3 years of game, thus my assumption. Not rude at all.
---
You need to be able to turn as fast as possible to check your surroundings as quick as possible and to dodge the killer, as well as to look behind you when being chased. The same thing, if you have low sensitivity as a killer survivors will dodge every hit. Thats why you want the sensitivity as high as possible. This isnt an FPS.
---
Well I mean mouse and keyboard almost always makes a game easier, but you might not share that opinion
---
&gt;But if you're already moving onto the other side while the Survivor approaches the vault (as you obviously read that they're attempting to vault) and they actually don't, but head do a 180 turn and leave the L-T wall with you on the other side, they still have a pretty nice gap and thus another chance to reach a pallet and extend the chase.
---
They don't have time to do this. If they hesitate, they lose to you continuing in the same direction, because then they won't get a fast vault.
---
Gens get done too fast. But how could you make it fair for survivors then? If doing generators took more time, that would mean getting even a single kill would magnify the difficulty of doing more gens even further. I've been saying this game is fundamentally flawed because you can't change anything without making the game completely lopsided. Its like BHVR has to balance a tiny scale using 1 ton weights. No matter what they do, the scale is going to be crushed under the weights.
---
You get both the killer and survivor and sometimes some extra cosmetics for the survivor for much cheaper than it'd cost to buy the killer/survivor for Auric Cells. And the 9000 shards have taken you many, many hours to gather.. and if you do the classic 1 $ per hour calculation.. it's not worth it.
---
I'm too potato to understand this.
---
Is the killer the toxic one for rage quitting?
---
Or is the survivor toxic for not completing the gen?
---
^((because I felt bad for the killer))
---
WTF DID I JUST WATCHED
---
Absolutely.
---
I don't get it.
---
It doesn't matter, as long ad you don't use Auric Cells for it, DLC or shards makes no difference.
---
Wait what else do you use shards for?
---
This only applies to the survivor

I get so much hate for being a doctor main getting so many "He is too easy! Why use him!" "He is so garbage! He is used by noobs." Yet doctor has some actual tactics that need to be considered, shock timing is important... But even then he is not a perfect killer
---
Also the DLC gives you Ace + a tuxedo for him.
---
Ah alright. Wasn't sure
---
I would love for chunky to be a character! It would be reasonable to make him the same height as when the pig crouches. 
---
It is a huge issue if you play Myers.
---
Don’t get the hag. Bad choice.
---
Why? It seems great
---
This. It feels impossible to come to grips with a killer that your unfamiliar with when your up against rank 1 survivors. Your either forced to just stick to what you know and get burnt out on the game or derank, which will likely occur anyway if your doing terribly with a character that you don't know how to use effectively.
---
It's not as big of an issue as people make it out to be. It's not enough of an issue to "ruin" your game. You may get matched with a r1 killer or survivor couple of times but people really blow it out of proportion.
---
It may be difficult if you're just starting out but the difference disappears after rank you cannot derank from.
---
Cosmetics
---
I have a well trained hate for all murderers. 
---
NO OINK?? FINAL WARNING
---
For a little clarification, I'm not talking about Coldwind. I'm just outlining what you can do on non-Coldwind maps. None of this works on Coldwind, for obvious reasons. I'm just outlining why Coldwind is a problem.
---
Shut up cunt, he's awesome. For real though, he is harsh when he needs to be. And usually on camera, because he needs to entertain people. I don't see a problem with it. *I stick up for Chef*
---
Or perks from Shrine
---
I use them solely for cosmetics.
---
Shrine of secrets, save the shards for that, if you're willing to grind a month out for a killer, you may as well have dropped 7 dollars for the dlc
---
EZEZEZ
---
The reset is actually ON the 13th of every month. And sadly, if you don’t log into the game for months you get pushed even farther back. 
---
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
---
That would be nice but what about the people who would switch their character last minute?
---
And then 2 of them stood at the edge of exit gate in a sense taking game hostage while 3rd crept from behind just far enough not to activate hook timer but close for a save... And you have another "fun" hatch like standoff mechanic that involves more then 2 people.
---
You see issue in this?!?
---
It’s worse on console 
---
I know I said it before, but legion is fun. It finally counters getting run around for the whole game.
---
You’ll throw her in an hour.  Hag gets bullied unless you run op add on
---
Petition to make DCs give automated bans
---
You just level up all the way to lvl 99 again it's a long grind 
---
But you can report people post game, can't you? 
---
"Halving the generatot progress in half"
---
Hell yeah.
---
To be fair that build is annoying as hell to play against. And a lot of people don't understand why people run try hard builds during the event. But I mean some killers just wanna play the game normally (me included) so I get it.
---
This is almost exactly me too. 4 pips to go.  Survivor seems to get more fun, whereas killer gets less (I'm only 9 on killer).
---
This is a seriously good fuckin meme.
---
Mate, can i applaud you enough? Nay, nay i think not.
---
Hopefully it gets better post event, remember killers its ok for them to use meta perks and items, but not you? 
---
Then thy head shalst be poppeth
---
just drag them by the foot lol
---
They said they wouldnt make a clown killer....
---
Reporting doesnt do anything when someone dcs. It automatically reports you. But im not sure being dcd from a match counts to the ban. Dont quote me though 
---
Damn do we already have that many killers? I remember back when we had 3, 3! killers. I always wondered what it would be like to have like 10 killers in the game, and now we are already past that.
---
That's sad... Hope you face only honorable killers from now on. 
---
Was a huge surprise to me, I played the game in 2016 but stopped. When I came back after spirit was added I was pretty surprised to see 13 killers. 
---
The joke-&gt;
---
You, an intellectual
---
I rarely ever comment about good memes but this was really good and gave me a good chuckle. You sir/ma'am keep up the great work
---
There'd be 5 total for a gen. They'd all be the same. They can be picked up (and dropped) like items but without using up that space.
---
Just think of them as bits of pipe and wire and such that the gen is missing. 
---
It's comment like these that inspire me to continue making content. 
---
Not only was he trying to heal you, but he was turning whoever it was into a god.
---
No I had to restart my game since my bloodweb bugged out 
---
Because it works enough times where they dont care if they lose some matches. Face camping builds can score you 2 kills (3 if survivor dc's or suicides) if done well by a killer, since the majority of survivors are not part of a navy seal level swf team. 
---
You don't have to wait for them to bleed out
---
Haken feel this feeling in my bones that Rex would fit The Doctor better. 
---
My idea is like in the movies, Chucky can possess people, so when they are down he will take control of them player and make them hop on the hook
---
Killer main here. Adrenaline is worse than ds. 
---
Just had this happen before. P3 claudette flashlight spamming and tbagged after every pallet, and every time she got injured, she got on the mound on the rock where I couldn’t reach her so I can heal. Gets out with hatch. “OMG you’re so trash, ez ez ez boiiiiiiii.” We got ochido junior here. I queue up for another game, and I run into her.
---
I wasn’t going to play scummy, but I played Nurse (P3) and I have rancor on. Gates got open with two survivors alive, hooked the Adam, and she was opening an exit gate. So I blinked through the door and instadowned her with rancor, brought her to the Adam, and Adam saved himself with deliverance, and I proceeded to mori her, with Adam tbagging her. I picked up Adam and dropped him on hatch. :’)
---
Moral of the story: don’t be a toxic shithead.
---
Only if you learn from your mistakes.  Which I don't seem to do.
---
Red rank is literally the equivalent to like silver on R6. That’s cool and all, but being in red rank doesn’t mean you’re magically a great player. (Especially on killer since it’s practically impossible to de pip unless you really get fried somehow)
---
Plus, anecdotal evidence is hardly evidence at all. Tracking and chasing are important skills but unless you’re playing nurse, billy, or (kinda) spirit, ruin can be a necessity against good survivors or a well coordinated team. 
---
On average tho yes ruin isn’t always “necessary” but perks are meant to be used to cover weaknesses or enhance strengths, and ruin covers one of the biggest weaknesses that killers suffer from. Even if you don’t “need” it, it’s still a good perk because it turn a game where 2 gens would’ve gotten done to into a game where 0 gens get done.
---
I shall embrace RNGesus
---
This morning I wanted to harvest some salt so I played Legion with Frank's mixtape, cold dirt, and an ebony mori. Surprisingly no DC's, killed 3 last found the hatch, and I only received a very mild homophobic insult in the post game chat. I was almost disappointed
---
Found a survivor main.
---
I just dont like red ranks. I never get good games. So i deranked a little bit just to get to like rank 5 at the middle of this season. The survivors are (ironically) alot better and the killers are actually fun to play against. No campers/tunnelers/stupid survivors/not as much salt. Its so much better. But deranking to get easy killers to bully is just being a dick. 
---
I would be too lmao
---
And then i get hooked and unsaved in the first minute.
---
No you dont depip
---
I still remember when I tried hitting survivors on hooks thinking that maybe they would die faster
---
I love what you did to those salty survivors, but.. Why on earth would you want to unlock literally the three worst teachable killer perks in the whole game? And I speak as a rank  1 wraith main
---
Because sprinting around, mashing your weapon a ton of times, vaulting pallets and widows fast and sometimes using op add-ons like Frank's Mixtape isn't fun at all. I would much rather go against a killer that requires skill and can be counterplayed, not like Legion.
---
Not at all, I main Killer. Rank 1 killer and rank 15 Survivor :)
---
Legion isnt fun? Do you mean playing against or as? Cuz when I play as them I have fun ..
---
Here’s one that I had:
---
Mori with Huntress,
---
2 sacrifices with Huntress,
---
And four hatchet hits with Huntress.
---
This was right after I prestiged Huntress too.
---
No he said "some of the biggest". His statement is correct.
---
Rank 1
---
It does? Didn't know that to be fair, but in the very end this doesn't make it better at all. The only thing I know is that I've been temp-banned a bunch of months ago and the support told me it was due to dc'ing too much. The thing however is, I NEVER leave games. What I've recognized tho, is that I've been kicked quite often during the loading screen at that time so...
---
Apparently the ban-system punishes players that can't even be acused of something :/
---
If you don't take the game too seriously, and you are just rank 12, and you say you have controller lag.. why would you think that saying "ruin is dirty" is a good idea?
---
Oof, you caught me by surprise. Personally, I don’t use NOED but I can understand why some people need it for some killers. But if you run NOED on Nurse/Huntress/Myers/Billy, you need to uninstall.
---
yes, totems totally should have a counter just like gens. or noed should lose the speed boost, only leaving the 1 hit down on it. and get decesive strike out of the game already.
---
I mean been trying to get used to it since 2010 and I still can't get used to it on fast.
---
Do you think it would be a little fun to make them like the items, having a brown, yellow, green, purple? And of course not every match would have purples and greens but maybe based on what the killer is running (better addons and such) there is a higher chance of getting one that is better and may speed up the process?
---
Thank you it is not easy coming up with entertainment for my fellow dbd community members.
---
Susie- *YOU'RE* NOT SCARY WITHOUT YOUR MIXTAPE!
---
It's not all people that derank. I took a break from the game and, due to rank reset, I was down to rank 18 or something. Sorry I took a break from the game?
---
Depiping is not a problem in this situation, losing your items it is.
---
Petition to remove Legion instead :)
---
Yes that's true for sure, I still fuck up those skill checks a decent amount. Also when they run unnerving presence it can throw me off. But if its just a normal skill check more than once there's no excuse lol
---
This is what I make memes for.
---
Uh well I did so
---
I like your thinking! Give this man a promotion!
---
Hi hag main - they're lying lmao she's fine
---
I think the point of devour hope is to NOT face camp, right? You need them to save in order to get the token?
---
Well I guess doctor and freddy are out as well...
---
Yeah I wouldn't let this guy's opinion alone sway you, although it sounds like what you've watched has enticed you enough. Check out [Space Coconut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OiP2gVja_s&amp;t=77s) for a great explanation of why she's actually a pretty in-depth killer with lots of mindgames available to her. 
---
In the end if you think she looks fun you should try her and not care about getting bullied, especially if you're newer. She actually decimates people at lower rank hook saves because nobody knows to crouch over her traps. You also get access to one of the best teachables in the game, Hex: Ruin. 
---
If you care about bloodpoints Leatherface is one of the best DLCs to buy too, BBQ &amp; Chilli heavily reduces the grind of the game and gives an aura reading effect which is good for tracking if you're new.
---
The counter to Nurse is my own skill level with her
---
As a killer main, I think things are a lot more balanced now than they were a few months ago. The healing changes mean a secondary way other than ruin to slow the game down (just a little bit...) and sloppy is now a top tier perk.  It's nowhere near as difficult now for killer even in high ranks, and I don't feel I'm depending on survivors to make mistakes.
---
Sure you're not likely to win if you go perkless at tier 1, but who does that?
---
That amount of dcs in lower ranks make me sad tryna coin :(
---
Frank mix tape should be ultra rare
---
With devour hope, you can't facecamp. You probably didn't understand it right. You need to stay those meters AWAY to get a stack, and devour hope is a pretty fun perk, because you can get a speed boost, you can one shot and mori them if you have 5 stacks 
---
I remember watching two survivors do the teabag greeting and then they split and take off when the realize I'm watching lol.
---
yeah but i gotta stay close to the hook. the range that gives me the token is like half of the teleport range
---
Too many Legion mains exist for this to be a thing. I guess people like playing a killer that requires no skill so they can feel good about themselves :/
---
I personally find Whispers to be a lot more consistent. 
---
For me it will be whatever perk has the points will be standard to my build. 
---
I even ran Distressing on Myers for the guaranteed 8k deviousness
---
unless they are twitch Streamers they cant be that big tbh.
---
I get alot of dbd Videos recommended and never have I heard of those People 
---
The devs literally have said this on reddit. I copied and pasted half of what I said in my posts. You guys can downvote it all you want, but if you rage quit early in the match they are looking for it.
---
That's true Garugah, luckily I'm too greedy to use any of mine xD
---
He did make mistakes in that chase, but it was 30 seconds long. It's unrealistic to think any killer except perfectly played nurse or lucky billy is going to average faster chases than that. In Zubat's VOD he had a few goofy chases like that himself, but the survivors were going too slow to punish it.
---
I do agree that his biggest mistake was not slugging. After he checked that gen, he could have blinked further ahead after the second gen was finished next to him. 
---
Well they need to fix that then. Because there are a lot of times i get crashed from a game or disconnected and i dont want to get temp ban for something i cant control
---
I got ti devotion 6 a while ago and got premonition 1. 
---
Thanks! Yeah obviously my art isn’t very good right now because I’ve only just started drawing. You exact expect somebody who’s never played piano to suddenly become Mozart, that would be absurd. 
---
i just read the english version of it and it’s clearer than the portuguese one. i’ll try running it again with that in mind
---
He would have a really bad time on rotten fields. LOL
---
"I don't care about anyone's fun but mine"  So very, very true and agreeable 
---
Survivor mains: *Just shakes the board downward* 
---
&lt;3 please keep making the content. 
---
6 minutes would be the new "on time," and I bet if you time your games you'd see it was still relatively fast.
---
Not uninstalling any time soon :)
---
It looks like you depip, but if you chack your rank afterwards, you won't have :)
---
Which sin have you committed?
---
You can improve your aim slowly but anyway, fuck it. Playing as huntress on PS4 is not about getting better. The hit boxes are small as fuck and you need to be very very precise. 
---
Now this is a gold tier shitpost
---
Playstation 4 - Part of the PS+ noob crew.
---
Funniest thing. You get hooked. Killer slaps someone else , because he found him via bbq. And you can see a survivor crouching on the other side of the map from you, not even near the killer and CROUCHES towards you without urban evasion. If you are like that, you really have to read some guides or so..this is ridiculous.
---
Not even last minute. Once survivors are in your lobby, you can switch killer... and then what? Kick everyone out and look for other 4?
---
Yes, I know, and I already addressed this.
---
yeah, during the event survirvors got some firecrackers and a couple of instaheals, killers got a shitload of rare addons and moris.
---
The other day I had a Meg on Lery's at rank 15 that just kept jumping over pallets and wimdows non stop just to annoy me with the explosions.
---
Granted I'm a new player (120~hours) but it was the only time I experienced what it felt like trolling in game.
---
Crow bombs are things like the crows that can be heard across the map like if you walk up to the boat on the pale rose, and spies from the shadows does not trigger for those things since you can hear them anyways. 
---
Random crows are not crow bombs.
---
wow baby killer needs to use their ability gegz
---
Noob3 used to tea bag often in the past. I hate the fact that he did that. 
---
My build for hag would be Hex: Ruin, Devour Hope, Sloppy Butcher (Its a good meta perk), and Noed. The problem is hag is hex only so she really doesn't have much room for other perks. Also, don't get killers to lvl 50, get as many as you can to lvl 40 so you only have to get the teachable perks and move on.
---
omg that sounds SO incredibly satisfying. hell yeah!!
---
Lmao yaaaas XD
---
What did they say?
---
That's exactly where my experience comes from, I introduced friend to DbD and every match was that, haha. 
---
He’s getting to old for this shit
---
I’m sitting in the dark, sick as a dog, getting ready to leave for work and this made me chuckle.  Thank you! 
---
Monto needs to calm down on calling players stupid or dumb as fuck. Everyone learns at a different pace. Not everyone is good at the same game. Monto gets too ahead of himself.
---
Yeh or maybe have a preferred 2/3 survivors and killers who you want rituals for
---
Have had a lot of killer DCs right as the final gen is powered too. 
---
yeah i’ll stop leveling them past 40, i just got unlucky and it took until level 42 to hex: ruin tier 3 to show up.
---
i’ve never ran sloppy butcher. i’ll give it a try.
---
Nah
---
Play on PS4. You will know how hard it is hit these guys who juke who come towards and you and then just go in the same direction they were going initially.
---
I mean, I think that deranking is not a big problem. It's just the stream was like an hour and a half with maybe 20 minutes worth of discussion (if not less).
---
NOED: too much text to put in a perk.
---
DS: Really Big nerf.
---
Trappers dog- Snap
---
Wraith- Spectre
---
Hag- Muddy Buddy
---
Michael- Slasher
---
Freddy- Darn 
---
Huntress- Hatchey
---
Leatherface- Reegruhhhhreeeeee
---
Doctor- Shocktop
---
Pig- Oinkers
---
Hillbilly- Dave
---
Nurse- Blinky
---
Spirit- Shinigami
---
I enjoy sloppy butcherer on my pig cause then it makes them less likely to heal when they got a trap on their head
---
I see a lot of people deflecting the other sides complaints like both sides don't have valid complaints. In the span of a single chase survivors can get 2-3 gens done which feels like shit to play against. This game needs more objectives period, they should borrow from F13 and/or last year with what they can do. 
---
Alright sounds good, also, good tip if you dont already know, place traps in front of the hook so when they go for the unhook, let them get it then teleport over, easy d hope stacks and hits on survivors
---
You mean master race version
---
All the people in the podcasts, bar Monto, are twitch streamers and arguably the biggest one's around. I think only Tru3Ta1ent get's viewed close to as much as pug and Jen.
---
Yeah, i want to listen to Air Supply while buying ebony moris

---
I agree that it is an annoying build but at the same time survivors dont stop running meta perks just because either so I don't see why killers should be limited like that. 
---
Yea, last season I stayed around rank 7 because every other game was swf with 3 purple flashlights and 4 ds. 
---
But rank 1 survivors is as much not fun. Nurses and billies 90% of time. Haven't played against hag or trapper in a long time. 
---
That might be a good idea. I wouldn't want them making the process of completing a gen faster than it is now though as that would miss half the point.
---
Maybe if you could find better parts in chests that would make certain items work better? Like one part might make healing faster for as long as you're carrying it. And since they don't transfer between matches that would be a nice wildcard. 
---
Ok buddy for one jackkn12 is just my username and for another if you want to know my age cause you guys  are not keeping  it on topic my age is 19  happy and I'm only going to say it once. I repeat jackkn12 is just my username!!!....
---
Oh and about the hex build, it's not normally good to run more than 2 hexes during the trial *unless one or two of them are Hex: Thrill of The Hunt or Hex: Haunted Grounds* but having the noed only comes to play at the end of the trial so it's okay. But keep in mind the survivors can clear all the full totems
---
Agreed. Trying to learn the Huntress against red rank survivors is just hatchet whiffs all game for me.
---
English as a 3rd language? 
---
Nea sighted 
---
Borrowed Time is v blessed
---
I just think if the killer is going to run all red and purple perks there should a slightly better advantage to do a gen. They have to find a part now to actually start it, and if only 1 person has a purple one it wouldn’t be that much of a difference. 
---
Got a thing for young Chinese girls huh ? 
---
Yes i did :))
---
Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Deerstalker and NOED is a pretty good build imo if you don't have any other DLC.
---
BBQ and Make Your Choice work great on her too if you havr those. 
---
Firecrackers are so extraordinarily good even with Tier 3 Ace in the Hole + Tier 3 Plunderer's Instinct you can still get them with no add-ons whatsoever because that would be OP, add that to the + list
---
I got a thing for young Asian girls. Dats why I like the spirit.
---
Also they think I'm 12 which I'm not I'm 19 jackkn12 is just my username lol. Some people just read it wrong hahaha. But I do hope you don't think I'm 12!!!
---
i’m confused. you just suggested i used hex: ruin, hex: devour hope, noed and sloppy butcher
---
that’s three hexes so far, because noed is a hex as well, should i replace anything for thrill of the hunt?
---
Exactly ;)
---
Maybe he has “glass eye” doll sight as some add on and let’s him see things even better, like peoples feet and legs are shown up more. 
---
I don't think someone should be punished mechanically for what perks they run. It's not like you can run downgraded versions of perks after all. 
---
When you mori a survivor, it doesn't count as a sacrifice. If you mori all survivors, you'll probably get an "Entity Displeased" rank. If a survivor DC's, you get a quitter's bonus, but it wont count as a sacrifice.
---
Also depends on the system. PC players seem to be ok but on PS4 solo survivor can take up to 15-20 minutes for a game and forget SWF that is a lifetime lol. 
---
Isn't it the main motivation when playing solo? When you play with friends, you care about their fun too (not sure if on the same level as your own, though). But when you have 4 randoms in your game... Going out of your way for them to have fun sounds like a silly idea.
---
*Charges hatchet*
---
I don't meet much of hackers in high ranks, I don't know why low ranks are infested with them. I was playing with my new to game friend and pretty much every game I had a hacker. I even had wallhacker, guy was playing trapper and was following me over the wall, I realized it when I noticed every movement I make he makes same one, I could see his redlight following me through wall, that wall was not possible to follow, so I was like "wtf?", I try to back, his red light backs, I go forward he goes forward and he always knew where people are. 
---
In high ranks they either know how to conceal their hacks better, or hackers get banned before they get into high ranks, idk.
---
Also love how they spam in lobby ""hahahahaha" after they were hacking in match and their entire steam profile is spammed with "hacker" and has like 100pages :D 
---
Full context: I was replying to someone saying sabo'ing hooks during an event was dirty. Just pointing out that running ruin during the event is the same thing.
---
Survivors get event points per generator. If a killer runs ruin, my chances of getting max gens is reduced. 
---
Against good killers, or with bad survivors, I MIGHT get one gen done if they have ruin. Without ruin, against same killer, I'd get three gens at least. That was my main point, during events like this that rely on gens for points. Outside of events I don't really care, like I said I don't take it too serious. I don't give a rip if I die, but would be nice to get the points for the event.
---
I did that Morltha it wasnt the case, isnt a big issue I know the game isnt perfect by any means 😂
---
Awwww you gave me nostalgia :) I remember when I thought killers were OP and "medic builds" could be a thing.
---
deerstalker has only worked for me while finding dying survivors on the ground. but i consider myself quite good at listening their sounds and finding them.
---
i actually have all dlcs but haven’t leveled other killers yet 😅
---
Everyone knows that yeah rank 15s are generally worse, but the main point he and generally everyone that says this is making is that rank 1 is literally the equivalent to silver in R6, if even. Anytime anyone says “hurr I’m rank one and...” it makes them look like an ass because being rank 1 hardly means anything other than that you play the game a fair amount.
---
You want to be 24 or more meters away to get a token. 
---
So not for her gameplay ? lol 
---
If the legion does not have Frank's mixtape and they nerf moonwalking, waiting at every pallet to hit the survivor using frenzy isn't a good strategy since it takes 4/5 hits +the stun or fatigue+the sprint burst survivors get from each hit. Sure it has no counterplay, but by the time the legion finishes doing that process to 1 survivor, a couple of gens will probably get completed and ruin is long gone. Using that strategy assuming moonwalking is nerfed and you don't use Frank's mixtape will probably grant you around 0-2 kills max
---
He added source engine sounds. 
---
You'd be the outlier in the situation. Breaks happen. But there is a TON of deranking
---
A Huntress statue would be sick! Nice jacket choice too.
---
We aren’t talking perks though, I’m saying by running better Add ons as a killer there would be the *potential* to getting better parts. 
---
I'm red ranks. Killer queues have been great (for once) but survivor queues take upwards of five to ten minutes and when I arrive in a lobby it's usually high ping. Halloween was killer lobby hell and this is survivor lobby hell, give me back BBQ event ;-;
---
I'd love the sweaters, Jeff's is amazing as well.
---
I think the least human-looking killer we got was the hag.
---

Poor Nea really can't catch a break, can she?

Nice job, but her feet seem disproportionate to the rest of her body, or did The Clown and Susie have a baby?
---
Repost? 
---
Or people could just like the design of something? Nothing wrong with wishing for them. 
---
yes, i deleted it because the title was misspelled 
---
Okay so the toxicity in the clip was I 99’d the gen and when he came to hit me I popped the gen so my adrenaline went off as well. I also went to unhook the Claudette and she had adrenaline as well
---
You missed doctor.

---
You know this always seems to happen when a survivor heads my way being chased by the killer and when I fail the skill check the killer is so occupied they never dip off towards me anyway (unless it's the last or second to last gen).
---
Love the nea tucked away in the corner 
---
It's an opinion. Not a fact.   
---
But the general consensus is that it's neither fun to play as, or against.
---
Oh ok, sorry for disturbing. 
---
Even so, we'd need something to balance that out. Like if survivors have red or purple add-ons then there's potential to get progressively more broken parts.
---
I'd still like it to affect something other than gen fix speed though because I don't want to tamper with that too much 
---
It's not always salt - sometimes they are genuinely bad at the game.
---
Same bro, oink
---
Some people just spit out racist remarks. Guess it's rare, but it does happen when it really shouldn't.
---
I’m secretly trying to send the message that Susie should have the ability to kick people to death. Spread the word. 
---
They are both fun. But hag has Ruin. Get hag.
---
I've been escaping and getting 41 points (missing 4 generator points even though all 5 gens were done) and escaping with a vessel and only getting generator points and dying and getting 45 points, all on PC... what is going on?
---
salty killer main downvotes inc.
---
i can already hear them type "BUT SURVIVORS ARE TOXIC WITH THEIR DC AND SC!" hhaha
---
Amanda is the most adorable killer in the game, oink!
---
yes, and when killers feel like they are losing they dc or camp, ehm, secure 1 kill. both sides can be toxic.

---
I honestly haven't enjoyed this event and kinda wish they would just stop for a bit. It just makes everyone play like wangs especially survivors as you have to survive with a lantern to get the most points so their is a lot of selfish play.   
---
I have been of the attitude for a while I want them to stop with event's and adding killers/survivors and just fix there game. Never known a game that gets three times as many bugs after they patch out a bug.
---
Chunky lol
---
looks like there’s some mold on this meme, must be too old to be funny
---
isn't he usually at rank 1 though?
---
Okay
---
Did you not read the last part?
---
But they had their masks on
---
If you play the game a fair amount at rank1 then you have at least faced really strong players, which does give you more insight into the game than people who have never been there have.
---
But the way he entertains people is by yelling at others and making them feel bad. And that makes you a sadist.
---
Rank 1 Piggy here (and some Huntress), I actually only played nurse about 10 times. (and failed badly)
---
Piggy is just too much fun, going stealth all around, reverse bear trap kills (oh look a body), or the dash attack mind-play on a dropped pallet.
---
I'm at the point that even my Billy and my Huntress are worse than my piggy. I know with her I get can a 4K often.
---
we are gonna live forever, baby.
---
A theme is different to an entire gameplay concept. You have somewhat of a point there, but they have a _reason_ not to make such a killer, thus it won't happen. With the killer clown it was just that they couldn't imagine it fitting the serious tone of the game. And they made it work with some really disgusting psychopath.
---
There are bad players at rank 1 too
---
Nope. If it's going off an unhooked survivor is near.
---
Title checks out.
---
Even though I main Doctor and Myers, oink my friend. 
---
Depends on how much you value your money over your time.  Shard point gain is absolutely abysmal when converted to real money per hour situation.  Around 40 hours of playing will net you one $8 (non-sale price) character.   If your budget is at the point that a single $8 purchase is questionable, use shards. You have more important things in life to focus on.    
---
Otherwise, just buy the dlc, as it provides both the killer and survivor, where you would be spending another 40 hours of grind to get the survivor as well. 
---
Sure as long as we disable toolboxes and flashlights :) 
---
(In case anybody takes this comment seriously, it’s not. OP’s suggestion is dumb.)
---
I was so angry when this happened to me last night. I did 3 gens, 4 unhooks, and kept evading the killer and as soon as the exits were open I get hooked and Legion camps me.
---
All of them. 
---
As a meme lover I love this meme. 
---
As a legion main, I’m sad that more people don’t find them fun to play. 
---
Image compression though 😭
---
You learn faster against betters players in every game. Stomping lower ranks doesn't teach you anything except how to stomp lower ranks better. In fact you'll pick up bad habits from beating those worse players and will need time to adapt anyway once you reach higher ranks. Terrible excuse.
---
That's actually kinda useless. Not worth running a perkslot. I'd rather run haunted ground in order to spam more hex totems on the map.
---
Ur getting downvoted because you’re wrong and not every survivor player is a brain dead toxic piece of shit and is willing to call out when another Survivor main is being fucking stupid
---
Dying Light 
---
...Really??
---
Jesus, that's extreme. 
---
You're saying if it's not strong it can be unfun. Great!
---
How about make Legion viable AND fun at the same time?
---
Lowkey, they should bring back Tier II and III daily’s. Atleast for events, because moonrise is compete ass for bloodpoints.
---
Same, except I'm the T3 Myers staring at the person on the Gen.
---
It's not about needing to do totems, it's about the fact you could cleanse 4 totems and never find a fifth one, as a solo survivor you never know if a teammate cleansed or not a totem, and sometimes you simply don't have time during the match to cleanse totems. People ar like "you don't like NOED? JuSt ClEaNsE tHe ToTEms!!11" as if cleansing totems is that straightfoward. If you cleanse 4 totems and leave one, very well hidden, behind, you've literally wasted time to make NOED even stronger.
---
Happened to me the other day but I'm sure they were working together. The dude got on my gen - with Michael im chase - and Michael downed me. Then a facecamp farm combo - for all three hooks, with the same survivor unhooking me *right in front of the nodding Michael* every fucking time. 
---
Good to know thanks
---
Billy and Trapper too. They always tend to be the sweatiest, in my experience.
---
and why exactly is my suggestion dumb? 
---
there is no need to call me names, as you can probably read the flair of the post is "discussion" and thats want i want. a discussion. if i wanted to get insults, i would talk to my parents
---
Oh it definitely is,  the game is a horror survival game after all. 
---
Are you stupid? How am I being stupid? I'm stating a fact, and the sub clearly doesn't like it if they're downvoting me. They *want* to believe that the sub is run by survivor mains because they want to be the minority...
---
Aight good luck
---
You don't need to wait, they can also be purchased for dollars. 
---
Its not that their bad it's just like tier 2 memes at most, nothing clever
---
Sometimes the gens get completed so fast I can't even enjoy the match. As a survivor.
---
I got devotion 7 and got the Freddy buff.

In all seriousness, Huntress. If she didn’t have the mind of a child, I’d hit it if she let me. 
---
Second to her, David is straight sexy too, and Feng Min is beautiful like a piece of fine art. Then there’s also the fine hunk of muscle that is the trapper. He looks especially fine with the antler mask. 
---
That we down you too easily 
---
what
---
I agree if anything the teachables for them should give you the tier 3 for them all. Personally I usually do get at least 2-3 tier 3 but i get screwed over for other perks lol. 
---
I leveled up doc and trapper first and I swear I constantly get their teachables all the time in every killers blood webs before I get the other 5 killers teachables I unlocked, its kind of annoying I want more variety in perks
---
And yet you called any killers who disagree with you “salty killer mains.” Don’t insult people and then be surprised when they come right back at you. 
---
Games unplayable with wait times now, killers disconnecting, survivors disconnecting, lobbys constantly bugging and almost every second game crashing while loading, dead by daylight... turning into dead by update 
---
logic 100
---
yep we just reached peak retardation
---
yes, in-game there is 1 killer to 4 survivors
---
but on the subreddit, the majority of people are killer mains
---
however this doesn't mean they never play survivor
---
I mean the OP did seem to just take a picture of their own loadout screen, so...
---
Explain? 
---
To be honest, not really... sorry mate
---
It's a cute meme lul
---
Devs pls nerf.
---
This is amazing 
---
this made me feel an emotion that doesn't exist
---
I've definitely seen it plenty of times before. Dead By Daylight has a huge official discord, for all kinds of things, one of them being finding people to play with. You can go to chat rooms and begin asking for people with party streamer offering, and get into a voice room with them - https://discordapp.com/invite/deadbydaylight
---
Or... just brother though, when you Prestige, you automatically start with all three perks on at least that Prestige level, from the very start. 
---
So P2 gives you all three perks at Tier 2. 
---
P3 give you all three perks at P3. 
---
I mean, you do grind a lot just to get up there. Yes, the bloody cosmetic is the reward for that, but a guaranteed third level perks would be nice too for all that bloodweb grinding. 
---
Isn't hag like, covered in mud? Mud is pretty moist.
---
I mean. You cared enough to click on the post and comment ¯_(ツ)_/¯
---
Huh. In every other game it means bitch move. Same general idea though. 
---
3! = 27
---
I’m new to the game, can someone please explain the Nea joke to me
---
Jake 😍
---
When the dlc first game out, I saw some people theorizingthat the janitor Frank and co. killed was Jeff’s dad. It would make sense, as his dad died and that’s why Jeff came back. I’m not sure how many parallels there are, but it never goes into the details of his Dad’s death.
---
That wouldn’t be a bad idea since it’s an extra incentive and will give you a little power boost when you start back at 0 with no add ons or other perks so it’s not like starting from scratch 
---
Good throws!!
---
Did you record this on a VCR? That PLAY text with the triangle top left really takes me back!
---
It’s time consuming, not hard
---
Devour hope is kind of mediocre. It has the potential to be the strongest perk in the game, but it is also unfathomably inconsistent. If you can protect your totem while also getting hooks and getting stacks than it can win you games singlehandedly, but I don't think I've ever actually been able to get it to work.
---
As for the Hag's other perks, Ruin is arguably the strongest perk in the game, and all but mandatory at higher levels. Conversely, The Third Seal is one of the weaker teachable perks in the game, especially for a totem perk. It's not useless, but it fulfills a role that I'd almost always rather have something instead of.
---
While both the Spirit and the Hag are strong Killers, most people agree that the Spirit is slightly stronger. If I was to rank all the Killers, Spirit would probably be third or fourth on that list, while the Hag would probably be fifth or sixth.
---
All of the Spirits perks are extremely solid and work on every killer, but are a bit more niche than something like Ruin. Spirit Fury pairs beautifully with the Hillbilly's Enduring, essentially granting you a free hit every time it goes off, which can be extremely useful on Killer susceptible to being looped like the Trapper, Wraith, Freddy, etc. Haunted Ground can gain you a lot of momentum if you get lucky with the timing, but it can also get you nothing at all. High risk - high reward, but overall it's a very solid and versatile perk. Rancor is one of my personal favorite perks in the game. It fulfills the same overall role as something like Bitter Murmur, but has a few nice bonuses at the cost of some of the stronger information given by Bitter Murmur. The global locational information is going to be useful at all stages in the game, even of it doesn't tell you the direction that Survivors might be traveling in. The exposed-mori bonus it gives after the gates are powered can be extremely satisfying and will get you a lot of kills that you wouldn't get otherwise.
---
&gt; since you wouldn't really need to learn her then
---
Yeah man, crosshair = instantly knowing how to play Huntress.
---
Isn't 6? Or is it joke that is wooshing away from me?
---
You wont drop all the way to rank 20 every time. They treat these as pseudo-seasons, but there aren't really any rewards for ranking up other than being matched with other ra k close to yours.
---
Alright but why didn’t you loop that pallet do you know how hard it is to find pallets on that map lol

It would make trapper pretty annoying, searching for pieces of machine and then snap, the piece you were picking up snaps your foot
---
If you want to play killer, the one with Leatherface and the Hag are very important. Leatherface has BBQ that will basically double your bloodpoints every game, so you'll have around 50k/per game. And the Hag has ruin that will slow down the game, which is **essential** when you'll play against good players.
---
The salt!
---
iT sUStAins mE
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
because thats the only argument i ever hear from most killer mains that express their opinion on this platform.
---
I bought Leatherface for his teachable perks and the Pig for a stealthy killer. Read the dlc characters powers and perks and make your choice on what seems good for you.
---
Well in retrospect I suppose camping was an extreme example. Tunneling would be more fitting. If I tunnel someone who just got unhooked then they'll go down much more easily and I can get a person out of the game quicker. Even though this is efficient for winning and isn't terrible on the BP either, it's not fun for the receiving end at all. It's also something that's popular to complain about despite it being the killer's objective. 
---
definitley not as big as noob tho
---
What the hell did u just read
---
She ugly

I am not kidding when I say this is the best meme I’ve seen in months if not years good sir you’ve done it if I wasn’t broke I’d give you a gold (well I wouldn’t) but it’s the thought that counts

Bad Mannerisms 
---
Personally i think nea is kinda a boring killer as its to easy. She has no heart beat no red stain or anything she's to OP
---
moistest... if this wasn't probably loli, i'd say susie and frank
---
one of the many questions science still can't answer....
---
Interesting theory 
---
Purple Flashlights, Brand New Parts, Sabo Toolbox, Instaheals, DS, Self Care, Springwood, Gideon Meat Plant, the entire endgame, and the hatch
---
Gonna need some sources for what you’re saying. Without it it’s just you spewing bullshit
---
That's a pretty bad outlook, sometimes they spawn right on top of the thing.
---
Just ~~handicap yourself~~ play Freddy and come play with the mid-ranks. 
---
Make sure to buy freddy ASAP kappa
---
Why not Wraith
---
why do you hurt Bing Bong boy like this
---
Uh, what you got there?
---
An original repost.
---
There’s going to be a v-day event? 
---
I used to use it to but I’ve been watching so much noob3 I’ve found out perfect perfect perk builds, Monty is apart of that as well
---
Totally
---
Yeah, I've definitely notice that too. I think it has to do with moving your character while you're being healed. Before, you needed to press the Run button to interrupt the healing, but now it seems that the process is stopped just by touching the left stick.
---
that's literally the best and possibly only working possible Shape strat other than jumpscare myers, survivors just being b\*tches.
---
Was this recorded by Myers after he did the tilting glitch?
---
^^^Evidence right up there
---
I've harboured a lot of downvotes
---
Best thing is, i was running Bamboozle. Also, in the same game [a David got stuck outside the exit gates.](https://i.imgur.com/eSIJTAz.jpg)
---
It’s not hard at all, after seeing it once you should expect it every time a survivor runs at you so simply wait a second longer. 
---
I don’t understand the Devotion levels...do they actually affect anything?
---
They're honestly my two favorite killers. The Spirit has a steeper learning curve, and it can take you a while to learn to use her power properly, but she can be much better at ending chases and being an overall aggressive killer. The Hag, though, is great for defending an area and slowing down the game by forcing survivors to crouch their way around, so it all depends on which of those fits your play style better.
---
All it takes to get a safety pip is u pretty much just have to hook someone then bam safety 
---
I don't like to play with P3 Claudettes as a survivor - Blendettes usually just hide instead of doing gens or saving. 
---
Why you bully bing bong boi :(
---
Do you think bamboozle is op or something? lol wtf??
---
r/unexpectedfactorial
---
ree.
---
Claudettes do everything wrong. They deserve death by my own hands
---
Yeah, but I know I wasn’t moving at all when the Jake was trying to heal me. I didn’t even have my hand on the controller just because I thought I could be unintentionally moving. 
---
It’s supposed to be double blood points on V-day. I was just wondering if any other event was confirmed yet.
---
No but saying people that use DS should get better but people that use bamboozle need help playing against loopers lol 
---
Ban thx
---
It’s not necessarily the perk it’s also the type of players that use it. They’re always the ones crying in my DMs
---
Oof should have never posted this comment since most people don't know what a joke is

Congratulations! :D

Strictly speaking, just for Decisive Strike, the Halloween DLC is more interesting if you're a play to win oriented player.
---
That said, the Pig is a very different and interesting character, although if her is more viable than Michael Myers (The Shape) is debatable.
---
Do you like any of the movies? Go for the one you like the most!
---
hell yeah! 
---
Yet he is fun.
---
Sweatiest killer isn’t a bad thing ? And just because “they send swatiest killers” doesn’t mean they are annoying
---
soooooo goooood
---
Ive been escaping with 5 gens while holding a vessel and sometimes only get 20 pts this event is broken 
---
&gt;monthly reset let’s me practice new killers and gradually grow my skills on them, wanna know how fun it is to try and pick up the pig and play basically naked against swf bullies?
---
That right there is why the game is bad. You don't enjoy it so they slap on this half-assed workaround "monthly reset" to justify its existence. This game is full of design like that. Nothing is thoroughly thought out. It's just small step into certain design which is never fully explored or even fleshed out and all the flaws, mistakes and oversights that come with half assed design are covered with duct-tape like solution to truly exemplify the lack of expertise of the designers.
---
Yessssss :) 
---
that is completly wrong...just look at the sub/viewer count 
---
DS literally gives the survivor a BS second chance after they get outplayed in a chase. Bamboozle helps you use strategy to block paths during a chase and helps destroy infinites that good survivors can abuse. There’s a difference. 
---
&gt;NOED on Myers
---
Muh Jumpscare Myers tho
---
Today played as Bill vs a Legion. 3 of my teammates disconnected, Legion forced me to farm, do generators and then threw me down a hatch. Wasn't fun, can confirm.
---
You forget they hate the use of ruin but will use all the insta heals and desicive strikes possible. _. 
---
I personally don’t dodge but I understand why people do it when a SWF are all bringing in items on their P3 clauds. But sometimes the lobby just crashes so a good chunk of time most killers are “dodging” because of shitternet or a bug in a game. But for people who do dodge at rank 1 it’s a bit annoying.
---
It wasn't that bad. The feng that died actually accepted what happened with an oops :) 
---
Well maybe if that survivor ran the killer around better all game instead of waiting to get their first hook at the end then that wouldn’t happen lol
---
Right, I wanna know!
---
And then as a killer you learn to fake you don’t have it with 300 IQ moves... and then you just lose sight of your next victim. Oopsie!
---
Not if you're playing a D-tier meme build killer. Go for the lulz and watch that rank go down.
---
My point exactly with the counter. You could literally do nothing all match but hunt for totems and still get noed because you miss one
---
No sorry it's my first time  how do I delete it
---
Bruh. 
---
It’s a BS perk that gives a survivor a free second chance after getting downed in a chase. I think NOED fits in the same category on the killer side. Both reward bad play. That’s why I’ve never used either perk
---
How do I delete this post it's my first time sorry
---
Self Care, Decisive Strike, any exhaustion perk (my preference being balanced landing), and then the last slot is pretty open, just bring something you like. I bring borrowed time for those clutch saves but not everyone likes the perk. 
---
He gets pissed because he can't handle the situation. Any "great man" does not need to do that to anyone else. He might be good at cooking but he certainly does not come off as educating, hospitable, approachable and warm person.

If exit gates are open then camping the hook is the smartest thing to do? So I don't really see what you're complaining about. 
---
If a killer camps before all gens are even done, then that's a lame way to play and people complaining about that is justified. Which is completely different to what you described. 
---
Wait so you telling me that they didn't conplaying about lag/camping/tuneling/using any perks/using easy killer/ actually hiting them when they try to 360?
---
Guess theres a first time for everything
---
Oinks in oink
---
that made me cry tears of joy from how beautiful that was....
---
To me personally part of the games charm is that it’s a buggy mess 
---
Yeah I was also thinking about bringing along WGLF just to level up a little Thanks!
---
It’s not free though, the survivor has to hit the skillcheck in the first place. Usually they are dribbled. Sometimes they don’t even get to use it with how hooks are placed when they go down. Other times someone hits DS and goes down immediately after. NOED is useless without totems. It’s revealed after one down so at most it should reward one kill if players don’t rush the killer. Each perk has a counter in some form. DS doesn’t do much against Enduring 3. NOED fears small game and that tapp perk. I don’t see the point in antagonizing a perk if it is toxic players that are ruining your experience. 
---
Count yourself lucky. I get days where I see Legions 9 out of 10 games, and on days I don't see Legion much, just going against him ruins my fun and just makes my experience as survivor terrible.
---
Being slow and fucking with your vision
---
I don't get the point of hanging at the exit waiting for the killer to see you leave.
---
Any time I manage to have the exit open, if no one is down and/or I have no chance at unhooking them- I just fucking book it out ASAP.
---
It's unfun to play against any killer when they try hard.
---
30 seconds is an overkill.
---
The only unfun thing about doc is his annoying add-ons and a hostage doc. But he's pretty mid-tier. 
---
Freddy is pretty fun to me tbh since he's just bad and loopable. 
---
Legion, Clown and Spirit are the unfun killers to go against imo. 
---
Yeah its literally the only valid strategy unless you are runing end game perks
---
Came in to comment the same thing about a VCR! :-D
---
Never heard of this before... stealing it
---
To play. Not against.
---
I know! It's insanely stupid. The killer could have destroyed the pallet but he stayed like that for a minute. I think he was a little boosted
---
What are you so upset about? Honestly all you mention is poor design and half baked ideas that aren’t explored... like what? What would you rather for new killers... if I’m rank 7 either I learn the hard way for new killers... or what? I reset at 20? So it’s not like I forget how to play, it’s a new kit that leaves me slightly disadvantaged. So now I’m able to dumpster 20s 14x? The month reset gives you a bit of accomplishment - get rank 1 in a month if that’s what you’re into or try a new killer without being super under handed. You won’t be there long and at least it’s not for EACH killer. Honestly if they just toned the nurse and billy down and maybe rework legion we’d have a better game but overall it’s still a great game for what it is. Like you shit all over secs design but what would you do better in their place? I’d like to know seeing how right now you’re just bandwagoning tossing buzzwords being upset at whatever
---
Yeah, thats what I figured. I suggested it as a possibility in a prior comment.
---
Thanks!
---
It sucks knowing this is a multi platform issue
---
Nah, fam, OP's right. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, just as long as you look cute.
---
BHVR needs to implement some strict anti-toxicity systems and stances similar to Blizzard with Overwatch. Maybe a proper peer-review system like what's in Overwatch might help?  
---
Martyrs?
---
Oh idc if they stop I just do a quick "Lul ggez win baby killer one kill the whole game" then I leave so I can't be screenshotted for being a tool.
---
Legitimately playing and deranking isn’t an issue. The issue is when people DC or use third party software to lower their ranks. 
---
It's from ye olden gamer days. Used to describe ringouts and bullshit op attacks in fighting games, and continued on from there afaik.
---
I think ive known of the phrase since like 98. 
---
I think thats the wrong user lol
---
How does that happen even with bamboozle? 
---
remember! your answers to this paradox are being recorded for r/MOISTinc if you want to see the end result to this social experiment go there lol
---
It’s closer to 20 but if you say 30 the legion gang won’t get as angry
---
When they say "gg ez" we already start tracking where the mf lives and buy an balistic missle on amazon
---
I've been running lithe and quick &amp; quiet which can really help in chases. If you manage to get a window without them noticing it's a clean getaway.
---
Understandable I suppose
---
I have never seen either of the movies lmao! I should do though.
---
I don't dodge due to SWF, bc yeah I get that killer leaving lobby as soon as u and ur friend loads in just fucking sucks. I'll leave if lobby is broken, such as when u have 3 ppl in it but the game won't find a 4th person. 
---
Theyre scared of them escaping, and want to really secure that kill because they feel like chasing is too hard for them. I used to feel that way too. The thing is that it hurts even themselves on the long run, you lose tons of progression on the chaser badge by doing this
---
There’s a perk to be silent when sprinting over windows? Is it a teachable because I’m definitely gonna add that to my build
---
is this event even fun? as a killer i find it tedious to go find some weird lantern hanging in the middle of nowhere hopping i have enough time to hit it and get back to patroling in a timely manner. Even then the points are so incremental that i feel like i was run through a gauntlet for almost nothing. As survivors you have the same problem hope you can happen upon a lantern before someone else then make it to the end of the game. This Whole event seems to promote a lot of camping on the killer side so you can at least get 1 down and find the little bug zappers before the gens are done and survivors seem more immersed then ever before, outright leaving people to die on hook so they can get their lantern or keep the one they have. 
---
Heh yeah I see. Maybe they do get banned before they reach high ranks, I'd assume everyone they play with reports them. 
---
The only real cheater I've seen (that I know of) was the lag switcher I mentioned somewhere around rank 10 (I'm now rank 4 as survivor), so far I suppose I can agree that it is less infested with cheaters and dumb people in general. 
---
However it's in a way really annoying to be that rank to me too, while those people aren't as common there's much more tryharding, and it's a bit strange how some killers quickly decimate everyone and some seem like they've just started playing killer, even if they're around the same rank lol. 
---
I'd say I generally enjoyed rank 10-15 the most, while there's more dumb survivors the killers are definitely easier/more fun to play against too, instead of the inhuman steamrollers they can often be in red ranks. 
---
Probably lives somewhere in the middle US area in his mom's basement 
---
It tiltes me literally. Also did you die seconds later after that juke or got to a vault ?
---
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Reigon-Jin
---
yes
---
How tf do you miss a DS skill check lol
---
That’s a very dim view of things. Surviving only gets you so many points. Actually participating scores much more. That’s how you pip after all. 
---
Of course I want legion to be fun and viable, but I think with some tweaks they can be fixed. I don't mind a rework either, but I highly doubt behavior are going to rework them. I'm just stating tweaks that behavior don't have to waste a lot of time, money and effort on while keeping the community happy. But that's just me
---
Love playing doc. While chasing people I'll get their madness to 3, and they run to a pallet. I sit there and think, oh yeah cause that's gonna work. You won't believe the DCs when they don't drop the pallet and hit me.
---
[&gt;mfw I read that as a Clown main](https://youtu.be/k9iYm9PEAHg?t=32)
---
&gt;Okay so a little background context: Clown's 15% slow slows him down by 15% for 2 seconds. At 2.5 seconds this means that his power can actually be used to chase, and that a chase Killer can actually chase.
---
&gt;That is all.
---
I feel old now
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Yeah. But we’ve earned that ability by grinding it out. It’s not my fault they don’t look closely enough. I only wear bright colors if I ‘want’ to be chased, so I can distract the killer. 
---
I'm a new player barely at rank 10 so I dodge P3 Claudettes and P3 players that carry flashlights.
---
I don't want to run in circles chasing a deranked player with thousands of hours of playtime to then be tebagged at the gate.
---
Yep, quick and quiet. It's a Meg Thomas perk that also works with rushed actions on lockers. Lithe is a perk from Feng that gives you sprint burst when sprinting through a window while in a chase. If you really want to get crazy, Dance with Me will hide your foot tracks after fast vaulting.
---
Don't want to be that guy but... maybe because it works? Honestly the ranking system is so unpunishing if you have NOED and Ruin you can easily face camp 2 or 3 people and still rank up.
---
Or maybe you are getting downvoted becouse you are wrong. Since when people disagreeing with you is proof that you are right?
---
We’re gonna live forever, David King’s perk
---
"Gone in 10 seconds or your money back guarenteed."
---
After 800h, stopped playing this game because of Legion. Fuck him.
---
Davids teachable we're going to live forever is a blood points perk 
---
Btw, is it bugged right now? I can’t seem to use it
---
In this case, yes?
---
Legion has no counterplay and requires no skill. You run to pallets, Legion jumps them. You run to a look, Legion taps you. After one of the longest chases you'll get into that day, you'll finally go down, get hooked, and wait for a save. Then you get to *do it. All.* **Over. Again!**
---
And if Legion moonwalks you, then you're going down. There's no two ways about it, nothing you can do and no way to stop it other than an insta-heal. You **will** be downed, hooked, wait for a save, then *do it all over again*.
---
jake. but it is heavily dependent on the cosmetics. ultimate moistness is achieved by long hair, black jacket, black trousers. m-hm
---
Once upon a time ago I was  a CS &amp; StarCraft player, still never heard, but I'm glad some cumturye was introduced to me today.
---
Won't hard tunneling let others complete gens? I seriously just had a chat with someone who told me I was doing poorly because I was tunneling too hard.
---
SWF is probs the biggest reason then. Even if all solo survivors, sometimes they load in all at once making the killer think its a 4man :/ I also heard some ppl will dodge if there's like even 1 person with bad ping, even if the rest are all green
---
Che bravo
---
Preach. I think the only thing that's worth it is deranking as Killer to learn a new Killer. But when you derank as Survivor you're just a fucking asshole. You ruin the game for 3 other people by not playing at high rank and then you ruin the game for all the people at low rank by making the game too easy for the Survivors and ruining it for the Killers.
---
It totes allows you to get hit three times instead of two. 
---
I like playing ad legion just saying
---
why isn't this at 5k upvotes already, I laughed out loud at the grocery store and scared an elderly woman in a wheelchair 
---
Oh, nice! Didn’t know that, thanks. I don’t imagine there would be any other events coming up until the summer.. maybe another double BP when the next chapter comes out though?
---
I will never understand people who only play one side.
---
ez  clap
---
Perm Tier 1 Michael rounding the corner and pulling you off gen. Now that's scary.
---
Wouldn’t bother me in the slightest. 
---
Hes kinda braindead to play as/against as survivor theres no real jukes or anything just loop once/twice then throw down pallet 
---
As killer arrive at loop throw bottle chase survivor force pallet down rinse and repeat
---
Meme title but I honestly don't think it would be awful as a perk. That being said taking one of your perk slots just to make other temporary perks work is really iffy. I'd definetly just prefer this to be a baseline mechanic. (Hide the Hex for 20 seconds or at least until someone activates it [IE for Ruin when someone does a skill check]) 
---
oops, was on mobile so i didn't care enough to bold it for emphasis, used an ! instead and didn't realise that.
---
it will if survivor can extend chase for a long time. But usually, if a survivor gets unhooked and killer goes after them, they wouldn't have had time to heal and can only take one hit. They also probably won't be in a good position to start a chase or all the pallets in the area are gone. Tunneling works if the survivor you're chasing is weak at chases.
---
I’d replace self care with something to find teammates (Bond, Aftercare, etc) and DS with lithe. Self care takes too long now and lithe is pretty helpful.
---
I believe they dont really hate legion himself, being a pretty shit killer. What a lot of people are ranting about is the Franks mixtape and cold dirt combo allowing you to spam your power and the great advantages that comes with it. People can and will say that it doesnt require skill also
---
I goto get 800 points :/
---
This happened to me on console, i had to reinstall and it fixed. THis was suggested by support forum.
---
Glad I can spread the word. 
---
It Hasn't been used a lot in shooters, from what I've seen.
---
Spirit also has good map pressure. Have also has good pressure from her traps. Nurse and Billy aren't the only viable rank one killers, but they are easily the most popular. But outside those 4 yeah it can be rough.
---
Is Freddy's rework still going to happen? Mine is untouched on lvl 1 for some months now, just waiting for a buff
---
bold of you to assume people use the map
---
Being a killer main myself, it only took one short look at the moonrise objectives to notice it just isn't worth the  time and effort to farm objectives as a killer. Either play normally/just for fun as killer, or switch to survivor to get points. 
---
Literally Pewdiepie walking with a shopping cart
---
I would also add in use Prove-Thyself a Dwight perk, and get on a gen with someone, a very quick way to max out that scoring category (8k) and if you get 4 stacks of WGLF then that's 16k right there.
---
She would be if her hitboxes weren't so fucked. Getting hot around corners by huntress all the time isn't really fun
---
People also don't slug enough. I get that a lot of people don't like slugging, but it is easily the best way to slow a game down when done in the right situations. If you find someone and down them, and know where someone else close by is, and the person you just downed isn't dead on hook, it is often the best play to slug them and chase the other person. Now you are pressuring 3 survivors without having to take the time to hook someone.
---
She's definitely good, but is severely hurt by certain maps. She needs to have steady LOS to be strong. 
---
If you like empathy, you might like bond, or aftercare
---
A build I have been using recently is Dead Hard, Iron Will, We'll Make It, and I switch between Alert, Aftercare or Bond
---
A fun build that can be good for those outofsight mind games is quick and quiet, lithe, dance with me and iron will. 
---
If you feel like you get to the end game allot use adrenaline
---
This is me when I’m on the hook regardless of what they’re doing.
---
Nope I used it in a match this morning. I’m on PS4 though so maybe there’s an issue on other platforms.
---
Don't forget that most of the people in that Tofu podcast are from the same "Entitled Elite" group that commonly run in SWF groups together.  
---
People complain about gen rushing and slowing gens down, but as bhvr showed, killers are still winning above 50% of their games. Putting second objective will have to be balanced out somehow, like killers needing 3 hits to down a survivor. But when what with all the insta down perks and items? Just because you get gen rushed few games, doesn't mean game is broken, you just got unlucky getting coordinate team. Most people aren't coordinate in this game. It's not unusual to get Claudette who types in chat "doing gens, you?". 
---
Would need a new escape animation.
---
Though, watching the killer super flip them on the hook would be hilarious.
---
So basically current blood Warden but without any of the risks? Because it's totally fair to open exit gates and then be kept there for a minute by killer who will likely run Noed. And people don't wait to open exit gates at any rank. 
---
Is there a visual indicator of the stackable bonus for We're Gonna Live Forever? 
---
I'm the Dwight that just happened to walk nearby and got in line of sight with the killer going to the gen. Unhook me please.
---
You’ll never unnotice it now *evil laugh*
---
*repost*
---
If I hadn't seen his shows either I'd be of a similar opinion. But let me tell you that the people that get screamed at on the shows are so damn thick headed that he has already come up and tried to educate them kindly only for them to ignore him or insist they know better, or they are people that so selfish and stuck up that they are risking other people's well-being to continue being self absorbed. Many of these people are so consumed with what their doing they refuse to see that what they are doing is toxic (quite literally in some cases) to other people.
---
I'm not saying Gordon was completely right to tell at someone every single time he has, but in pretty much every case I've seen, these people needed yelled at. Some of these people spent years and years being "instructed, guided and educated" by those around them and chose to ignore and even punish the good will of the people willing to instruct them. Gordon isn't some random chef that suddenly achieved celebrity status, he has trained under world renowned chefs and takes his work very seriously and doesn't just go off on people for mere laughs. And he doesn't just scream at them and walk away forever, when those people are willing enough to get over themselves he comes back and instructs them on how to do things properly.
---
Even if all this is wrong, there is the fact that the people that have appeared on his show knew exactly what they were getting into when they agreed to appear on the show. You can hate Ramsey all you want but it comes down to the fact that guiding someone with a helping hand doesn't always work and if someone is willing to be so thick headed and self absorbed that they are majorly affecting the well being of their staff and their customers, they deserve to be yelled at.
---
*tfw they buff killer to make the game nicer for survivors rather than because killers deserve some points, too ;_;*
---
For people at work - 
---
Dear People of The Fog,
---
We have become aware of the longer queuing times affecting some of our survivor players as more of you are playing as survivors during the event.
---
To address this, we’ll be making a change to the event points earned by Killers and increasing the amount of Red Envelopes spawning in the Bloodweb.
---
STEP 1: CHANGES LIVE TODAY (BACK-END)
---
Increased Killer event points
---
Points for hooking a Survivor: From 2 to 3
---
Points for destroying a Lunar Vessel: From 3 to 4
---
These points will be live but not be reflected visually in the event menu “Objectives” details until the patch arrives.
---
STEP 2: LATER THIS WEEK (HOTFIX)
---
Increased Red Envelopes spawning in the Level 50 Bloodweb: From 1 to 2
---
Amount will remain at 2 until a player Prestiges their character, or has already hit Prestige III
---
We will continue to monitor matchmaking for all players and work toward an improved and stable experience for everyone.
---
Thank you all for your feedback and understanding.
---
See you in The Fog.
---
The Dead by Daylight team
---
I would like to see everyone crouch walking around the light tbh 
---
I haven’t played in a while so the rank reset put me at either 13/16? Hopping on in a bit to play more 
---
This bill from an all bill swf group stayed at the hatch to bm me since I was wraith, he took too long to go in and I got the grab from it. Felt so good. 
---
Cool
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/45458/moonrise-event-balance-hotfix/p1?new=1
---
Someone tried to pull this on me yesterday. It didn't go well for them, and I was really confused what on earth they were doing 
---
Surprised they're not extending it too.  
---
4/5 of the player base is more valuable that 1/5. Gotta follow that money and keep the survivors happy to keep making profit.
---
*flips down nurse* can't forget that
---
I would like that.
---
Is *that* it? One whole point?
---
I got my 9th coin mainly playing as killer about an hour ago, the hotfix came right on time :&gt;
---
What region are you? I consistently get instant lobbies at rank 1, and at most only get dodged once before getting to play. 
---
It's hardly a terrible excuse just because you don't like it. 
---
Playing a Rank 1 Spirit doesn't make someone a Rank 1 Nurse.
---
Lmao the fact that people would prefer i accept the latter just because that throws me in the same bucket as people who derank for easier challenge purposes is really sad 
---
Horrible idea
---
*Uses Prayer Beads Spirit*
---
Man why are these survivors salty? 
---
It’s justified to camp at endgame
---
Definitely a good start, though the one change I wish they would make is showing the killer the auras of the lanterns. Even if it was just when they were in the breakable state I'd be satisfied. I keep walking past survivors and ignoring BBQ intel to wander around looking for another lantern, and it's silly. 
---
Corn for MVP. 
---
The man has passion for cooking, to see some morons fuck it up like that just makes him stand up for it and bring harsh Criticism up in the hopes they open their damn eyes because really: These people can be so delusional sometimes.
---
Muh Burger King Myers though
---
In the new announcement for the Moonrise event, it says "Step 2: Later this week (Hotfix) — Increased Red Envelopes spawning in the Level 50 Bloodweb:  1 to 2 (Amount will remain at 2 until a player Prestiges their characer, or has already hit Prestige III).
---
Does that mean that if you have Prestige III you will continue to only get 1 envelope instead of 2, thereby getting punished for having spent a lot of time on the game, when you are already at a disadvantage because you have a level 50 bloodweb?
---
I would argue that hag is slightly better than spirit tbh. It‘s definitly easier to play as the Hag. 
---
But you have to like the playstyle. 
---
The spirit is really fun to play and it‘s the most rewarding killer to play in my opinion, but at the same time it can be so stressful because you have to focus on your eyes and ears the whole time. With killers like the hag you have to use your ears also but it‘s way more relaxing. Because you won‘t get juked so easily if you haven‘t listen a moan or something. 
---
I hope this makes sense. 
---
Buy the hag if you want awesome perks and a decent killer, but if you like a challange and you are looking for a really fun playstyle than definitly go for the spirit. Ist might be really frustrating the first games but she is worth it. 
---
Definitely.
---
Lol I am absolutely a gawking survivor. Just saw one for the first time a few days ago and couldn’t for the life of me figure out what it was. Thanks for the info! Now I know what to do with it lol 
---
I honestly thinks thats me, I was doing dailies
---
Idk man, I’m NE US and I have no problems. You do what you gotta do though
---
I know that decisive strike is really popular (and Dead hard too) and that many people use them on higher ranks. Right now I'm just adding and removing perks trying to find out a nice combination with what I have.
---
But yeah, I do want to try a "scavenger" build in order to try to acquire items from the game so I don't need to buy them all the time from the bloodwebs xD
---
Way more people play survivor, bro. It's really not that equal 
---
Isn’t the point to a hex is that its extremely powerful but comes at the cost of being destroyed? 
---
Someone message this guy and tell him things will get better! RIP
---
Just wondering, is English your first language? 
---
Yeah tbh he's one of my least favorite killers to go against. Once you're in the dreamworld you're completely useless until someone pulls you out (almost never happens) or you force a skill check to fail (tells him right where you are anyway). 
---
Oh I’m sure you have, I bet you get made fun of everyday and I’m sure those people put far more effort in. If your mom wasn’t so damn ugly maybe I would too, and if you think you’re not getting raised maybe you should take some viagra for that microscopic lil thing of yours. Also you’ve wasted this much time making a fool of yourself so oops ; )
---
I sometimes don’t play for a long time and then will play casually on and off so I was rank 20 even though I’ve been rank 1 and it’s taken me almost an entire month of playing casually a few games here and there to get to rank 4 and the rank reset is coming up so it may be people who are casually playing since many people who have had the game for a long time don’t feel the need to play it all the time or are too busy to. 
---
My point was simply that every other Killer at least has some help. Even if very little. I agree getting ran for 5 gens is 100% on the Killer but if all 4 are strong loopers Freddy has nothing to defend himself. As Tru3 put it Freddy is all about the fundamentals.
---
Oh yeaaaah, I know him!
---
I've been watching some of his videos for some time now. 
---
Time to lose all the karma I gained from my Shaggy Dwight shitpost.
---
Legion is the only killer I find even remotely fun to play.
---
it doesn't matter your intentions because the end result is the same: an experienced player in lower ranks who, whether it be the purpose or not, is playing easier matches
---
definitely a fun killer
---
only the weak feel he's too strong 
---
That’s like triple the time it takes the nurse to down someone
---
Played shortly in 2016 because friends, took a break around august that year then I decided to give it another shot in august 2017 and imagine my surprise when I saw Michael goddamn Myers was available! Immediately bought his DLC, and don't regret it one bit.

'Gen rush' aka poor gen pressure. Besides how can you even tell which games are 'gen rushing' 4 minutes games? Every survivor is going to be doing gens if they are not beeing chased on rank 1 ...
---
*oink*
---
What’s the question, or did you just flair it wrong?
---
She is supposedly ugly according to people, so people joke about how she is a killer.
---
Gens still go way too fast 
---
Illiteracy must be rough
---
There is no skill involved in his ability and he doesn't have any actual counterplay, as you will inevitably be downed unless he decides to chase someone else.
---
Like others have said, We’re Gonna Live Forever is the only survivor BP boosting perk.
---
However, while the event is live, if you use an event offering and grab a lantern when you spawn in you get 1000 bloodpoints for grabbing it and 500 bloodpoints every 30(?) seconds you hold it. If you get hooked and lose your lantern you’ll get another 1000 bloodpoints if you can grab it again. So for the next week or two you can boost your survivor bloodpoint gains that way. 
---
Huh? Can't they still drop pallets despite being in M3?
---
Brand new parts are shit after their most recent nerf, sabo is just a gimmick that people do for fun it's hasn't been op since 2016,self care is a mediocre perk these days and flashlights are completely balanced these days 
---
He's just plain boring to play against. If he sees you, its just a matter of time until you're down. There is no chance to try and actually escape, so all you can do is try to make the chase as long as possible. Plus there's nothing actually unique about him compared to other killers. He's just a generic killer that can move faster. Its really fucking boring.
---
I mean when I'm playing LF probably should have clarified that 
---
I had a girls who wanted to use her no-obsession DS so she stayed in gates but I had a yellow mori :)
---
HybridPanda has like 300k more subscribers
---
It's an old joke from an old video where a streamer said "Nea is so ugly, she looks like a Killer" and a significant part of the community kept said joke alive after a lot of updates, the birth of cosmetics, the new engine etc.
---
The meaning is almost lost nowadays, it's mostly just a silly meme reproduced by people who just want to laugh at the randumb joke.
---
MVP.
---
It is their only objective, it's not survivors' fault
---
Last night in a game my friend got hooked and I went to save him but it wouldn't let me or anyone else unhook him. Downside was we were down a teammate for the game, upside was his death timer wasn't ticking so he was never actually dying. He was stuck in the middle of the animation that happens right when you get hooked.
---
can you pm that clip? I have a love for that kind of stuff.
---
A good nurse against a mediocre survivor yes. 
---
i mean if you want to succeed don’t rely on ruin and do an attemp to pressue. Slug, dont tunnel and dont let survivors keep you on a chase for a long time. I main freddy and i have no trouble doing this
---
I got enough blue shard thingys to buy legion, I have all the other free killers. But with all this legion hate should I use those to buy a survivor or legion ? 
---
Prego mio compatriota
---
This is not entirely true. A survivor of the same skill level as a top tier nurse CAN evade a nurse depending on where they are and how lucky each player are with their readings of the other player. 
---
Ruin is unreliable and you shouldnt pressue with it
---
Not too familiar with Blizzard's system or Overwatch but it's probably better than what we have now. One of the other survivors watched at least twenty minutes of the trial and probably reported, too. 
---
Just goes to show how little people really use/care about maps and their addons
---
I tHiNk WeVe DoNe A pReTtY gOoD jOb
---
you are.... absolutely right! I clearly have reading comprehension issues haha, I thought it was 4 for hooking and 3 for destroying vessels. So yes it would be 36. Killers still gotta work for those points :P
---
You get a boost while healing and doing gens
---
I mean the best counter to getting run around all game is to turn on your brain and play better 
---
Literally happened to my friend last night. We couldn't unhook him either. 
---
Works best for leatherface and Billy when they're about to get you with the chainsaw
---
*run circles around it*
---
The first time i saw a marker i did this lol
---
BEING IN THE WAR TEACHES YOU A THING OR TWO ABOUT BREAKING THE RULES
---
escape involves kicking them in the face and they fly back a few feet, as for the super flip i agree, really wanna see this animated now lol
---
10/10 editing lmao
---
Its a 2% boost and is hardly noticeable but if you hit all greats you can save a little time. It's a little more noticeable on healing than gens though.
---
Honestly if legion is any Indication of future killer design the killer in March is just gonna have a gun and shoot all the survivors, instantly sacrificing them. And the funny part it it’d still take more skill than legion. 
---
I think it depends on my objectives for that day. If my friends are on, I'll play survivor with them. If I'm alone, it's a toss up, bc I enjoy both, but will play killer more if I need faster BP gains
---
Was something wrong with the other one?
---
I got a good chuckle from this, thanks :P
---
I doubt they'd put this much effort into the game at this point, but I think it would be better to have 0 event drops in the bloodweb and just let people buy as many or as few as they want using BP on some other screen. (This is assuming that they're all pretty weak and funny items like firecrackers and not, say, event purple flashlights.)
---
In fact, like I've said before, event offerings don't make much sense to me to begin with. They should just make every game play as if everybody had burned offerings and then just remove the offerings from the game. 
---
Yes, it was a controller instead of a mouse :))
---
Seriously, some people cry about DS ? lel
---
I know its a shitpost but freddy is actually pretty solid and better than wraith and leatherface 
---
sorry i meant characters haha
---
Anonymous maybe 
---
"just loop once/twice then throw down pallet" Yes. That's how looping every killer works. And you can still juke him as long as you aren't intoxicated, and the intoxication only lasts for a  few seconds. Also, every killer is supposed to force pallets down at loops. How is Clown any worse?
---
He has passed through that way more than three times!
---
I think my confusion is on the negatives, everyone says he has a ton but I don't really see much as opposed to other killers? But I also lean heavily into his detection with my perks to give me a ton of map control, so maybe I play to his strengths so heavily I don't notice them.
---
No but the teabags were for sure.  Mid chase teabags are toxic and unnecessary af 
---
thank you for addressing the problem &lt;3
---
You answered it right there. People are petty and on consoles there hasn’t been a lot of punishment for it so people don’t feel threatened to stop. 
---
Legion completely ignores skill, so the best survivors will do just as well as they would against a Legion that knows it needs to target one person, down them and move to the next(average player) while Nurse actually requires (little) skill to play as and the survivors stand somewhat of a chance.
---
Oh, As killer : The Shape
---
As survivor : Claudette
---
OINK
---
Bill OP, pls nerf.
---
I think a better tweak for killers specifically would be giving vessels a timer to get destroyed instead of just as long as the survivor is on the hook. As well as overall making the vessels more prominent for everyone to see.
---
If you hook the survivor on death hook or if someone instantly goes for the save you literally only have a couple seconds to make it to a vessel to break it which 9/10 times isn't enough time.
---
This but unironically. I swear to god I have seen every killer called OP and/or unfun to play against and like half of the killers are already listed in the comment section. This is why people don't like survivor mains
---
Cannibal and Wraith are fine where they are.  I full understand the other two though.
---
and breaking NOED...LOL   
---
I dont have any other upgraded perk on my spirit sorry.  Plus Im using the lowest level add ons
---
Daddy is the most fun on both sides and no one will convince me otherwise
---
So you don't do all the things people complain about in regards to Legion and still got downvoetd. Classic
---
She looks especially cute on the schoolgirl outfit!
---
Can someone paste the text? I get a non-private connection warning. 
---
I was playing spirit yesterday with ruin and haunted grounds. 4 games in a row they broke ruin and didn't touch haunted. Outside of one game at the end where the last survivor broke it as they were the last person and still had 5 gens.
---
Meanwhile SWF teams popping 3 gens in 2 minutes as I get a single hook, teabagging the whole time I was chasing him and constantly harassing you in lobby for "tunnling" and being a 'noob killer" for 10 games in a row. 
---
And you wonder why I get tired of it and decide to camp basement with LF. 
---
&gt;Amount will remain at 2 until a player Prestiges their character, or has already hit Prestige III
---
And why can't killer mains who have every killer prestiged get more than 1? I assume its [to keep the blood point economy in check](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/alr905/gotta_control_that_bloodpoint_economy/)? I get why the blood point gains are limited because we just came off a week long blood hunt, but why limit the envelopes to 1 per web after prestige, the points are already limited so why limit the offerings themselves?
---
Dude. Reply button. Everybody's saying it,
---
You're most likely just not keeping accurate track of how many of each you saw. There are so many killers that without writing it down it's easy for confirmation bias to creep in.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a4l7ex/a_simple_graph_of_killers_i_met_in_thousand_games/
---
Here's somebody that kept a tally, and nurse/billy combined made up about 1/3 of his games rank 1-7. This is more like my own experience, where nurse is more like ~10% of my games and hillbilly is actually more common.
---
ImPrOvEd ToTeM  SpAwNs
---
Legit, stealth is the only counter to nurse. And with all the tracking perks this game has (BBQ, NC, Whispers, Spies now that its not ABSOLUTE trash) and the fact that survivors literally *have* to do generators, thats really hard to do
---
I have no issue with them breaking my totems.  Im just pointing out I had no way to one shot
---
What if, Legion could only VAULT pallets and couldnt destroy them?I mean, theyre only teens. They cant break pallets just with a few smacks. 
---
Good start but far from enough. Decreasing the numbers of points required to get all 9 coins is necessary. And there's nowhere near enough offerings. It's still a huge grind, too big if you're not in a good SWF team that can reliably win and get the full 45 points on most games.
---
Are you people seriously fucking stupid? Or do you all just have problems with reading comprehension?
---
Oh man. I've tried learning nurse but I feel so helpless and swf and bm survivors ruin any ounce of fun I have in trying to learn her. 
---
&gt; You learn faster against betters players in every game.
---
This is only true to a certain extent.
---
Someone reported you somehow, were you showing all your p3 glory off on a character with few perks? 
---
For anyone who did do it I’d recommend you lay off the p3 flaunt until you have a solid perk set or until way after this has all blown over. 
---
You're right, but the only thing about ranks 1 - 3 is, you'll have the genuinely good players mixed in with the players that are only there because they use the best/busted items/addons/killers.  
---
Personally, i like playing in ranks 7-3 as survivor and 15-9 as killer. I feel like i can actually have fun with survivors as a killer in those ranks and anything above, requires you to be too efficent with your time and/or tunnel at least 1 survivor. I know its possible to win otherwise, but you have to be a really really good killer or verse mediocre survivors.
---
Idk tbh. I don't think that'd be that big a deal. I don't get why'd you do that though, Legion already won't be breaking pallets because he can vault over them
---
First day? 
---
The Entity makes the killers way stronger.
---
Welcome, back! But you're missing some context. The discussion has been around content creators who do it on purpose to roflstomp lower skill/experience players
---
Realistically you won't get 3 hooks per survivor in 95% of the matches
---
On a good game you could get around 9-10 hooks for 30 points, maybe destroy 2 lanterns and you would be getting 38~ points more or less wich is still lower than the  45 survivors can get
---
Still, a survivor can get like 20 points average while the killer could easily get 25 points which make things more balanced
---
In a way 31999 is harder to achieve than 32k :P
---
You can change the idea around all you want, it is a **terrible** concept and will likely never happen. 
---
one time my killer lost pips because my survivor match crashed on the loading screen lul
---
Sorry, but Legion is just obnoxious to play against. I can see why they'd be fun from a killer perspective, but it's awful on the survivor end. 
---
another love post between survivor and killer
---
so sweet
---
I love the fact that neas there
---
If there were more killers like Sverkeren or fudge or PsychoScorpionz at red ranks, I'm sure a lot of streamers would be happy to play there. But 3-4 blink/omegablink nurses with Ruin and NOED who slugs with 5 gens left won't make games exciting.
---
well, more like killers main about 3 characters because grinding enough BPs to get decent perks and a steady amount of add-ons for more than 3 killers is a huge pain
---
You're absolutely right about low FPS making skill checks lag. They're local-sided (Your PC just tells the host whether you passed the check) so when killer ping is high, they're one of the few things that's not gonna lag, but they will always lag if your PC is having issues rendering the particle effects (on the new map, for example) 
---
My idea is that he would work on a gen, but he wouldn't actually do anything, he would effectively just take up space on a gen, not do anything, maybe perfect skill checks could slow progress or even regress it.
---
Deserved for using god pallet like that &gt;:(
---
Mate legion takes a little bit of skill (timing, knowing where to hit your frenzy, stabbing after you get a deep wound hit) 
---
I kind of prefer this over having 70 of the Halloween item that I will never use for a year and were just a waste of BPs
---
Is that stat for reaching it at least once? or for players currently at rank 1
---
God **darn** it. 
---
Everything else is such a cock blocker. 
---
Its Reddit. I think you are expecting too much.
---
Thanks! 
---
good lol
---
I said I hope, because I thought you were being sarcastic. I did not want someone actually saying the legion is fun in an autistic way.
---
If they were to put that kind of ranking system in (which I don't agree with anyway as it wont work with SWF), then I'm sure they could lock you from character selection once you press 'find a lobby'.
---
Please, the male version.
---
He’s at the bottom of tier lists because people don’t bother to learn him. Most freddy gameplay i see are from people playing hom wrong 
---
I mean that’s basically how it works for both sides. Red ranks are full of super sweaty players that just suck the fun out of the game. Rank doesn’t mean skill, but the higher you go the more killers and survivors tryhard 
---
I disagree
---
Some survivors dislike Freddy because they find him unfun to play against. Freddy players have a reputation for tunneling. Quite a few Freddies I've played against will camp and tunnel, and it's just not fun. Not every Freddy plays like that, but he's still got a reputation. Also, Freddy tends to be more effective at low ranks, but higher ranked players know how to play against him, and his power doesn't help him in the chase.
---
With how annoying it is to get loopdilooped like that, it must've been satisfying as hell for the killer. Straight up shut that nea down.
---
Cannibal could use an add on rework, but it’s not as pressing as Freddy and legion. 
---
Bruh he can catch this face camp or farm if I run into him.
---
The bare minimum and some playtime is really all you need. 
---
And... that’s not hyperbole. There are plenty of people at rank one that have irrational opinions on balance may it be because they themselves are irrational or just because they want to have an easier time, and the people that agree with them are generally people that fall alongside the same line. It happens all the time here on this subreddit.
---
And now a “perfect game” for killer is 36 event points instead of 24, if you didn’t bother to hunt down lanterns. A part of me wants more increases (especially BP increases for survivors and killers), but this will do for now. 
---
I still see 2 people downvoted it
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
What I meant to say was that each killer is a unique character, the survivors are just skins. Each chapter you can get invested in a new killer because its a new character, but the new survivor could just be new perks for your main.
---
When r they adding Freddy fazbear an pennywise kiwwers?
---
That’s what I have been doing. Didn’t know if I should have gotten Laurie for Decisive strike first.  It just takes so long to get to 9000 so I didn’t want to waste it . 
---
can we all agree deranking on purpose is way more sweaty than just being in rank 1 naturally
---
you only need to hit it once for the achieve
---
Actually if your only talking twitch Tru3 and Noob3 are very close, usually Tru3 is above because he streams more frequently. Pug is consistently above them all, but again they are all very close to each other. Strictly talking Twitch Noob3 probably has the advantage on youtube. 
---
I get 2 fire crackers in my level 50 web and just 1 envelop. :thinking: 
---
In some cases (such as myself) im a survivor main who occasionally plays killer to get the dailys. So im ranked 15 in killer (due to rank reset), even though i have 600 hours in the game. I rarely play killer, but have a firm understanding of the game and how to play killer, even though im rank 15 in killer. Its mostly due to the rank system being a joke. The inverse is, rank 1 killers that are trying to learn a new killer and are forced to play against sweaty survivors the whole time while trying to learn a drastically different style of play.
---
Doctor isn’t that hard either, and if you’re new survivors you vs won’t be able to loop anyways so legion is gonna feel weak because you won’t get looped no matter who you play. In games where survivors know how to loop legion is cancer because the only way to loop him is if the player is brain dead. 
---
Yup but it's 98% true.  I can't stand getting P3 Crawldettes into my lobby as survivor because it basically becomes a 3 survivor 5 gen game for us.  They always run Urban and premonition and spend the entire match hiding and not doing anything when the killer is chasing someone halfway across the screen.  They're also the most likely to be hot garbage in chases and toss pallets without looking behind them when the killer is a screen away.  They are all almost universally trash players.  Occasionally you'll get the 1 in a hundred that isn't a complete potato.
---
that doesnt make sense
---
People of all skill levels are mixed in at various ranks for various reasons, so yeah while rank 1 Survivors are probably better on average than rank 15 Survivors, you can still find SWF hit squads in lower ranks too.
---
I dunno why that's so hard to understand given that there's a monthly rank reset and deranking is such an issue in the community.
---
His perks are aids tho, like you gotta admit his perks are aids
---
Yeah I feel exactly the same.. Where are my bloodpoints :(
---
The escape rate also got fried because there was no incentive to escape, just grab the juice and kill yourself
---
If that's the case, my Dark Zone Legion will be waiting for him.
---
I do agree with what you're saying I just don't think it's *entirely* the fault of Freddy that a clearly bad player was looped for way too long. In the words of BrickyOrchid "the question we need to ask with every new Killer is 'does their power help in the chase?'" and for Freddy that's a hard no. The only strength his power provides is tracking and most good players can locate Survivors without Freddy's help. (Add in the fact that you *do* have to find the Survivors anyways and the fact that you can find them after finding them the first time is made incredibly redundant.) Add in the insane amount of tracking perks we have and there's no reason to dedicate your entire killer to tracking.
---
The thing that constantly has an impact in this game is the chase. It's the only thing that is reliably slow, and as a result is the only thing you reliably need to speed up. That's why powers (and to an extent perks [BS, Enduring, SF, BB, etc.]) that help with the chase are good and powers that help with tracking (Freddy, also to a degree Wraith and Doctor but at least W &amp; D have ways to impact the chase via addons and smart power usage) are not.
---
I don’t think survivors choose when they get hooked lol, if they haven’t been caught until the end that’s the killer’s problem 
---
How? Rank one is basically identical to rank 6-7 in skill, but people bring ebony Moris and op addons like every game which makes it unfun to play at. 
---
I wish they would lock it now tbh. I’m so sick of my sensitive PS4 controller changing my character if I put it down for one second to do something before the match loads. 
---
I've had this happen once and it was hell for everyone lol. 
---
His perks aren’t op, and he isn’t really op at all. The problem is his power takes all the skill out of the game for both sides, which is super unfun to play against unless you play super immersed 
---
If she wants a break, all she has to do is walk past a mirror. That horrid face would surely cause it to shatter
---
Julie looks like such a derp kid haha
---
not everyone uses reddit
---
i havent seen too much legions around ever, and i havent got more than two in a row xD
---
Bruh, unless you play SWF people often don't give a shit about their teammates and do plenty things without thinking. And the stupid "just cleanse all totems" argument is obnoxious to keep hearing on this reddit. Unless you play with teammates it is very hard to find all the totems, and the amount of time it usually takes makes it not worthwhile.
---
I said his perks are Aids, a term for being horseshit. The only one I would run is discordinance.
---
What about the rank 1 killers that facecamp?  Happens often in console 
---
from all the hate messages I get playing normally in a non toxic way I believe them.
---
they are a bit dumb...
---
Rancor works better btw.
---
No no expects Rancor.
---
Cant wait to run into him. Got a hook in the basement with his name on it.
---
Clown has to use his power smartly. He can't just blindly throw them around and suddenly shut down loops that way. 
---
Gotta complain every goddamn second dont you?
---
Legion should be able to still run but he has to normally maneuver over pallets and windows like other killers during the action his frenzy time will be paused until he is completely over 
---
dont know their viewer numbers, but I rarely see dbd streams with more than 6k views 
---
legion with sloppy butcher and bloodhound, and just stare at the ground
---
To add to what the other said, a guy made a dbd animated series and in that serie nea was a killer, so that helped with the meme
---
another update that causes problems "no points" with 8 days left ?
---
And I agreed? Yea his perks are shit except discordance, but his perks aren’t why people hate him. 
---
Yeah it counts as a safety regardless of what your screen says.  You do lose offerings and addons however
---
I only give hatch if I feel the match was good. Or if the survivors are complete potatoes. Ill double hook then vanish end game lol.
---
If Rank 1 meant perfect gameplay, then you wouldn't have ended up on the hook.
---
Yea he could use a nerf (feral frenzy time+speed while in it+recharge time)
---
this idiot buy this game on every platform?
---
It is literally impossible for a killer to get a hit at shack leaving God pallet down.  You would have to be the starchiest of potatoes to ever fall for a hit in this scenario 
---
LOL...i was thinking the same thing.  
---
Opens Claudette: "gg ez noob scrub uninstall"
---
Corn and Claudette. Deadly combination
---
I play rank 1 as killer all the time, the supposed "worse rank to play killer" and its just fine, people who derank are lame
---
Very very small boost.
---
They don't name deodorant strong enough to address that level of sweat 
---
I understand that you think you're being positive, and I dont actually get angry or upset when someone says gg after a game, because I know their intentions of being friendly, I just know that if you use the phrase gg completely incorrectly, dont blame others for getting upset at you, its your fault.
---
shame
---
Because red ranks are full of sweaty killers using iri head and other op shit and immersed survivors who do one gen and then crouch around looking for the hatch. 
---
Hey thanks. Time flies!
---
How do you play him right then? I doubt everybody is playing him wrong enough for him to always be rated the worst character in all lists
---
Its pointless unless you're swf.
---
This is incredible work. Goddamn, I'd love to have this in-game.
---
Their is a site called twitchmetrics and you can see who has been the most viewed in a month. So it's not based off the most they have at any one point but how many people actually go and watch them. The top this month so far is a streamer I have never even heard of, I think the name is Sal_Gu.
---
To give you an idea pug is on 549,443 viewer hours, Noob3 is on 353,219 viewer hours and Tru3 is on 352,499 viewer hours. 
---
Noob3 trounces them all on most popular with average viewers of 4,218. I think if he streamed more often he would arguably be the top streamer. Like to think Monto could give him a run for his money though if he ever get's his net sorted lol. 
---
Did he get buffed or something? Because I remember people complaining during the 1st week of release that he was a bad killer
---
I play him not as an agroo killer. That’s how you shine as him. If you unironically think that the Block addons are his best addons (like most dbd players) your opinion is invalid
---
I beg to differ. I’ve spectated several sole survivors who’ve gone straight for the light and gotten a hatch escape they may not have otherwise gotten. 
---
You're not meant to get all 3 unless you play religiously, 6 out of 9 coins is not even halfway 
---
So did Jeff just pop Julie’s cherry and give her 4 kids
---
Was only hell for us survivors. The Doctor had a *GREAT* time!
---
You're already hedging your other statement in this very post. Does it mean literally nothing or does it show they have the bare minimum of knowledge? I still think it's an exaggeration to say it takes the bare minimum.
---
&gt; There are plenty of people at rank one that have irrational opinions on balance may it be because they themselves are irrational or just because they want to have an easier time, and the people that agree with them are generally people that fall alongside the same line. It happens all the time here on this subreddit.
---
Do you not understand that this doesn't support your point that rank1 means nothing? Funny stuff.
---
Wait, so it's toxic to use the right perks as a killer, but okay for every survivor to use the same tired perk set? 
---
Rank 1 is only good for the aesthetic 
---
Its interesting when this happens lol I'm never happy when it does as a killer cause those doors are hell 
---
Wouldn’t be an issue if the devs gave us a reason to stay high rank 
---
It's really not that bad. 
---
I feel that man, it’s understandable to have 1-2 people hunting the totem but if it’s been like 5-10 mins and you haven’t found the totem suck it up and gen jockey.
---
Two of them could probably handle him. not everyone plays david though. Not to mention, they could stab him repeatedly
---
To be fair, Freddy could already camp hooks if he could stop people from doing stuff in the dream transition. My point is that if Freddy doesn't manage to put all the people asleep in time, even putting someone to sleep and them not being able to do anything during the dream transition won't help him. Also, Freddy doesn't need a speed drop during anything. He already has enough problems as he is.
---
No that cant be possible dude. I've been informed time and time again that nurse is easy mode and broken as fuck, so it can't be possible you are losing with nurse. 
---
When TydeTyme says self care is bad so it must be bad LUL
---
COWBOY JAKE IS BEST JAKE
---
legions pretty garbage without addons tbh. Hes only actually aids with the franks+dirt thing or if your team is retarded and likes being in a big pile/not doing gens.
---
The only upside to rank 1 is dealing with derankers is pretty rare, most slow down before getting past 4. Streamers don't even go past purple most of the time. 
---
Wouldn’t do anything. People would just let legions down them then suicide first hook 
---
It's STILL, literally, impossible and absolute madness to get 4500 points.
---
No! Not after 5-10 mins. You dont even look for it. If you happen to see it? Sure, break it! 
---
He shall not stand a chance against basement bubba

Nope. It doesn't give you anything, just resets your level back to 1. Meaning, you don't get 300 shards per level again, you have to start over at like 50 or something.
---
Wrong; survivor mains will work the gens through ruin and if they come upon the totem destroy it.

I want David having a beard while all bloody :(

I’m a rank 2 killer main and if you look at rank 1 gameplay ruin is in most of those games because the game goes wayyy too quick

For Laurie, I’d wait for it to appear in the shrine, that way you save time and shards (7000 IS)

I swear, the changes to the totem placements have made them even easier to find. The only “new” totem I’ve noticed stays up for a decent amount of time at the moment is the one that can spawn in the corner of the killer shack behind the box where the pallet is. It’s only a matter of time before people pick up on the location, but it’s worth pointing out, seeing as it’s the only “better” totem placement I’ve noticed.

As the others who have replied to your comment have said, so do I; The grind is just not fun. I did it because I had already gone through the prestige process with several other characters before, and honestly just hated it. So, when I read about this glitch, I made the decision to do it and hope that I could slip under the radar. I also didn't play the character until I had reacquired the perk build I had on them in full. Just for reference, I did it on The Pig with Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, &amp; Spirit Fury all at level 3. And frankly, the grind just to reacquire that was tedious and unfun.

I am not a Rank 1 Killer, but I will dodge a lobby if someone in the lobby has red ping and won't leave. Otherwise, I will just deal with the SWF groups. 
---
Hag is can be very close to nurse if played to their maximum potential.However I find spirit more fun to play with since I can mindgame myself.
---
Best is when you get someone at the gate like that as Pig and slap a trap on them. Starts beeping like crazy and you just leave them are on the ground
---
Revenge? That wraith gets rewarded while he sucks
---
Yeah pretty much.
---
You cant buy Laurie with blue shards, only $$$. :/

That's not against the rules and isn't bannable... Slugging isn't against rules, camping isn't against rules, popping small map offerings isn't against the rules. It is a bit scummy and annoying but not bannable or against rules

I never knew this existed until this post wow...
---
I still don't know why it's in the map rotation 
---
It's fine haha. Maps are so rarely used I dont expect people to know the difference lol
---
Have you fought a slugging nurse before or a myc nurse, if you think that is fun then you do you as for I thing a majority of people not really fun to fight
---
Glad I could enLIGHTen you lol
---
Have you turned water into wine? Have you resurrected? Jeez, I get the iridiscent in all categories only when I play killer! The best I do playing survivor is 2 iridiscent, 2 gold
---
Why did I read literally every description. Lol. So accurate.

Update: put in a ticket. Tl;Dr, bhvr says "yeah we know, thanks." Replied asking for my map back and got the ticket closed without a response.
---
Lol
---
Basically you hold down the Mori button but let go right before it completes so they don’t die over and over
---
It's usually a couple games or so, speaking from experience.
---
Hope you don't encounter too much toxic gameplay 😂😂
---
Mostly killer, but I still play a fair bit of survivor. 
---
Yes, swf is tough to beat but you just have to practice. It takes time. Play both sides, you will learn from the success and mistakes of others.
---
hell especially with the amount of points you need for all coins
---
Applying pressure isn’t the problem at all a group of survivors could escape in around 3 minutes not including toolboxes or anything. Rank 1 killer mains have that problem in which the game goes too fast which is why ruin is used in most games unless they have another way to slow the game (discordance, overcharge, etc). Games go way too quick pressure made be applied but there are still teammates doing gens even while a killer maybe hooking someone
---
No. It’s not bad but can waste a lot of your time. Tyde says a lot of stuff I disagree with.
---
Not being able to leave while that NOED is active is quite unfair. What of the exit gates are already open? Will they be blocked and prevent the survivor from leaving with a killer hot on their trail because the 3rd one just died on hook? It needs a bit of counterplay. Hatch escapes being blocked is fine, but once the exits are open, the survivor should be able to leave through them otherwise they will have zero chance to survive.
---
Yeah. I’d mentioned something similar in a later reply to another person. I’d be on board with that. 
---
I think you mean “tier 2 for prestige 2”
---
???? how is it my fault one random dude on my team managed to get a flashlight save
---
I love love letters between Survivor/Killer it’s so cute and sweet despite the feuds you see here often 😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖
---
Especially when paired with Up the Ante &lt;3
---
It’s alright. We all forget stuff sometimes. It happens.
---
I am guilty of this too!
---
LOL - bm for bm :) 
---
Hex perks are quite strong and the point of them being able to be cleansed is because they are high risk/high reward. Giving them power after they're cleansed would nullify the whole point of them being hex perk. That's why I never run them.
---
how??? she got us because she had NOED and could blink. if she didnt have NOED, i wouldve most likely been able to open the gate. even if me and the other guy wouldve have been able to rescue the person who finished the last generator (if the nurse even could down them without NOED) couldnt save them, he and i would still escape. at least 2 people wouldve been guaranteed an escape. but probably three because the nurse didnt... play very well
---
like, clearly this tactic works. but why should it be allowed to work
---
From a legion main:
---
Rule #1 of playing legion: (almost) never hit survivors twice in frenzy
---
Ooooh, yesssss. I love it. Bet that taught her a lesson 
---
More like rank 1s other nearby are focused on winning and use best (read op) perks. For survivors these are DS, sprint burst or similar, self care, adrenaline etc
---
For killers it's ruin, bbq, sloppy and whatever else that fits killer (throw in tunnel and camping if require)
---
Oh that and seriously just grinding rank. I got to rank 1 killer this week because killer queues are so short right now compared to survivor queue. And tbh it's not any better than rank 10. Just people use more meta perk and gen rush. Too bad you can't really hide while getting lanterns which makes their normal immersive play not possible dumb dumbs..smh
---
Ahhh. I see you're a man of culture as well
---
I believe that it wasn't intentional but I have see it here before.
---
Another problem is you cant increase the time without fucking over someone that is the last survivor that finishes the last gen.
---
What do you mean? I think he acted that way because he was unable to cloak. 
---
Wraith is ok. Bubba just needs to not slow down while using chainsaw thats it.
---
What else are you gonna do with LF?
---
His kit is intended for basement camping.
---
Same - rank 13 on PS4. I actually had to go afk to get my son off the bus and I found them all around me when the gates were opened when I got back doing all the teabags instead of just leaving. Why? So I didn’t move and just got to tier 3... and I took them out. Sorry guys but you should have just left. 
---
Lol. I don't have Michael. That must have been fun, though. 
---
Didn’t they say they’re working on it? Also with decent perks Freddy can be very strong so I wouldn’t say it’s even a big problem
---
Meg is Speedy Gonzalez 
---
It's unfortunate that they've decided to start building events around selling us skins we can't reasonably unlock any other way. 
---
I think you should read his post again
---
Tbh favorite killer to play against is Doctor, but I don't mind going against Legion. His add-ons make or break him more then any other killer. I don't mind Legion when you also have infinite tier 3 Myers, Iridescent Head + Infantry Belt Huntress, or Trapper with insta downs on traps.
---
Least fun to play against imo is Myers and Freddy. Freddy just because I don't run self care so getting out of the dream state is a pain.
---
And Meg. Everyone might say Nea is a killer, but Megs are the true killers here.
---
the crash is what’s doing that or the fact that you need so many points that you have to keep coming back...
---
I love how most of this subreddit is just memes instead of actually discussing the game. 
---
Fun
---
LUL
---
Ya, a counter would be good, but devs aren't all that up on QoL updates. it took like 2 years before the wraith spawned in cloaked.
---
Except almost every huntress runs tracking perks to help find people easier. 
---
Jake is one stealthy boi!
---
Meg main big brain
---
“Dosent”
---
Jesus this Subreddit .... 
---
First cry how bad and shit Legion is, then people find a way to play him strong and the tears start to roll again :D 
---
If you dont like him its fine, I dont like Nurse or Doc thats just personal pref. 
---
If he is strong with his item yeah so be it, it will be nerfed sooner or later if its really OP like other OP stuff was nerved. 
---
Try to learn to deal with him and still enjoy the great game ! 
---
you lamp smacking sister stabbing white face FUCKER
---
Can't say I've heard that one before
---
So you acknowledge p3 claudette has an  advantage. Glad we cleared that up.
---
I see you carried that team really hard.
---
Best money I've ever spent.
---
the alternative are events where if u don’t play enough you’ll never be able to get the cosmetic. which were basically all previous events.
---
Solid. 
---
On top of that, if you could be "playing another game" why the hell aren't you playing this one? As if being hooked or put into the dying stay means the end of the game for you. If you have to dc because the killer bested you in a chase that just means you're a sore loser and a garbage team player. If you wanna play a horror game that doesn't require skill and you don't need a team then go play outlast 
---
Ah cheer up. Just a game dude.
---
I mean people do this a lot in this game. Survivors staying in the map making sound cues instead of leaving when they know everyones safe, face camping killers, farming teammates just using you for stacks and the killer taking advantage of it, sandbagging teammates, etc.
---
The problem is that deranking is so easily solved if they just added rewards for being rank 1. 750,000 BP for being rank 1 for each side at the 13th of every month. Then people would actually make an effort to reach and stay at rank 1. No one would de rank because queue times would be great - it would be perfect and the issue would be solved.
---
Why is Nurse up?
---
Getting to rank one depends on time spent playing, not really skill. It just takes a long time to reach rank one, and not everyone has the time to get there before the rank reset in the middle of each month... which is stupid because it just makes rank 1 queues garbage for 4-5 days until people get back to rank one, since all that’s needed is time. I bet most players are good enough but don’t have the time to play as many matches as are needed to reach it.
---
I think one ds per game is fine.. They should just make it do something else if you're not the obsession. Like something with a tradeoff so you have to gamble if you wanna run ds 
---
My hate is irrational and really defenseless considering the nature if the game ; he's a fucking baby-killing kiddie fucker.
---
i could understand that it could be fun to play as or against for you, but most people would rather disagree due to constant chases and stabs until you either bleed out or somehow get away which is unlikely bc most always focuses on them. as well as the wraith, i don’t think he’s as op as legion or anywhere near so, but i guess that’s just me 
---
I hope you gave him the hatch
---
I dont get it, legion isnt that hard to beat.  Ive onlist to his a few times.  Im something like 12-3 against them in the past few weeks.  (Currently rank 12)
---
Said the rank 10 killer. Lol.
---
Game 2. Hillbilly
---
2 kills. 16k points. Black pip. 
---
Got hooks broken in front of me. Never had that before. Decisive strike.
---
Boil over is a good perk. I dropped Kate twice but caught her both times. She and saboteur were the two that died. I stayed close to toolbox at the end (no noed) and finally got Kate to the basement.
---
The other two escaped as soon as toolbox died. 
---
If he did he's an idiot because they will simply continue banning every new account he creates regardless of platform.  Ochido take the hint bro the devs refuse to allow you in to their game.
---
You're the type of person that DC's when you get chainsawed and miss the ds aren't you?
---
Name checks out.
---
You know I want to derank because I feel like I'm not good enough to be at rank 8 but hey gimme that killer torture baby
---
I think it's like, you get 1 pip per rank you had or something.
---
The way I understood it, is level 1 - 49 webs will contain 1 offering. When you hit level 50, you'll get 2 offerings. When you prestige, you go back to level 1, so it's back to 1 offering. When you hit level 50 again, you'll start getting 2 offerings again. If you're prestige 3, you obviously can't prestige anymore so you'll keep getting 2 offerings per web.
---
Where’s the 3rd button for “Make a meme complaining about the other 2 buttons”? Stop beating a dead horse.
---
Yea usually they do the first two-three generators in the first 3 minutes lol
---
Do as I do. Dont buy the Legion DLC until they fixed it! 
---
Idk if this counts. But I call gens Jenny. 
---
No mate, it’s the same point. Even the quote you just pulled from my reply literally enforces the point that rank means nothing. 
---
Just so we’re on the same page, you aren’t talking about skill right? This whole post was never talking about skill, and neither was I. You do realize it’s talking about the “credibility” people think they have because they’ve hit rank one?

I mean they already made the hag...  
---
Maybe it could be a killer with a really close 3rd person view, would spice up the game a bit.
---
It sounds like you're just irrationally angry that I don't agree with you lol
---
When you have nothing to grind for there is no fun tho..

It's also really annoying as killer to have the survivor disconnect.
---
And ultimately, you're not even hurting me because I get bonus BP.
---
No one gets banned for dcing
---
If you're getting run around for 2 minutes and 3 gens, you might want to try a strategy I call "git gud".
---
There are definitely times when it's a bad map and/or bad tile RNG and there's not much you can do against a good survivor. But if you keep having 2 minute chases every game, you're definitely doing something wrong in your chases.
---
Weird, what platform do you play on?
---
I personally do not get the DS hate. I'm a rank 1 killer and survivor and I can honestly say NOED is a much worse perk than DS. When I'm killer there is A DS damn near every match. It sucks but its jor horrible. It saves the survivors what? 20 seconds? NOED on the other hand, can take a game where the killer got 1 or less kills and get a 4k. I get it if it is NOED 3, but I rarely see that. Its NOED 1 or 2 the vast majority of the time that is getting ran  and that is absurd. I believe NOED should work similar to RUIN where the 1 affects 1-2, 2 is 2-3, and 3 is all survivors. 
---
Hey, thats pretty good!
---
/r/deadbydaylight
---
Or as it really should be /r/killermaincirclejerk
---
Lobby times were longer at Rank 1 back when Rank actually meant something, but you could still get a match. Every game with a ranking system will suffer from a bell curve of players but it's not the players' responsibility to play with players massively out of their league due to the poor matchmaking.
---
Gotta agree with you there.
---
Yeah, a while ago I had a killer who got 3 kills and baby raged over one guy DCing so I could get hatch. Wasn't even in a call with the guy, guess he was being thoughtful. The killer raged over not getting a double pip, even though he got the most points of the match and probably maxed on some things. He claimed I was lying about being a killer main just because I said "so?" about the double pip, some people treat rank as way too important. 
---
No but legion double frenzyung you a d stalking you down till mend bar runs out is too much of a meta style gameplay for those who play legion, rank 1 is piss easy to reach as killer so who cares about it, I'd sooner make it impossible for legions to play a match than worry about some bp
---
Do any of those numbers take into account disconnects? Just curious how you are gathering that data (unless an NDA prohibits that of course)
---
I mean there are still lots of people that complain about noed but don’t bother with countering it
---
You are a waste of time.
---
Having 4 survivors in the dream world already slows the game down a lot though? 
---
Maybe. 
---
With the red twine addon it can be good because it tracks totems. After a chase, or between gens, you can use it to see any remaining totems you went near in the past.
---
Ever since they buffed calm spirit, he’s pretty stealthy. 
---
If this is where you’re going then I can say the same thing.
---
Survivors still gains more event currency per hour without any stress. As a killer main, Ill keep playing survivor until the event is over. 
---
Then I wont touch the game until a bloodpoint event comes up. 
---
I don't like DCs because I'm not in it to farm fast games/BP, I want to actually play the game and get better.
---
I usually drop the last one on the hatch in a game with quitters because I agree, it's unfun to just smash 2 players.
---
The hatch appears when the amount of gens completed is survivors alive +1. Example. Two People left alive. Only 2 gens done. Hatch is not spawned. You pop a gen, and it instantly spawns, because now there are 2 survivors alive, and 3 gens done. So you and your friend could exit through the hatch.
---
Stick to Fortnite plz. -Dbd community.
---
So playing immersed has nothing to do with it
---
Doctor and wraith are far from OP, the problem with legion is that you don't need skill to play him like nurse. Legion is probably the most unfun killer to play against, you get hit over and over again and then get downed. There's no way to properly counter him, wait until he goes into frenzy and hope to god he loses sight of you or you're most definitely just going to keep getting hit
---
the same stuff but I dont really care
---
There's no rational reason to dc
---
I think the problem from a survivor perspective is not that they're too strong, but that they ignore pallets and vaults in a way that doesn't require skill. Being chased by a Legion, especially one running Frank's Mixtape or abusing the chase mechanic (i.e. walking backwards, or looking down) essentially just means running down the clock. You can't "win" a chase against a decent Legion.
---
In reality, against a semi-coordinated team who knows how to play against Legion (and again provided you don't use FMT or abuse the chase mechanic); Legion is rather weak and the map pressure their ability applies isn't very strong.
---
From a killer perspective, IMO it just isn't rewarding. I can easily catch survivors, I don't have to mindgame them, or make a good prediction about what they'll do. I don't have to force them to run loops inefficiently. I just have to not lose them and eventually they'll go down.
---
Joe looks like sans undertale
---
This is partially to blame as to why rank is meaningless, though rank in a game that's fundamentally a party game is also usually pretty dumb.
---
Proud to say my first time playing as killer I didn't even know that "camping" was a strategy. I just ran around and smacked people, threw them on hooks and kicked some generators. Then kicking them again because I didn't know I had to hold the button even though you don't have to on pallets. Good times. "Everyone in their first* game camps" is bullshit. Thanks. Have a nice day. 
---
Teach me how. I spent millions and millions on Kate only to end up with 4 Halloween items. Spawnrate was ridiculous.
---
word I'll start to DC as killer whenever I get corn or haddonfield 
---
Will BBQ and chill ever be in the shrine or do I have to pay $5 for one perk
---
Wow that's messed up.
---
Game 3. Nurse. 4 kills. 26k points.  2 pips.
---
There was a rank 9 and a rank 20 in the trial. Not sure what that's about. Everyone tried their best. 
---
When the shock therapy hits you in the nuts.
---
No. There is a perk to counter. Git gud. 
---
Same
---
There’s plenty actually. Like realizing your teammate (you) is a twat. Being in a game with a teammate sabotaging the game by leading the killer. Getting sandbagged is especially shitty. Many many good reasons, and I don’t particularly care if you don’t like them. 
---
yeah but if you have momentum as a killer then come across the ds survivor, it trumps all your momentum if they do use it. Now imagine if all 4 survivors had ds. 
---
Better than not being able to run away after a bad unhook then getting hooked again because the killer came straight back

*keep your job and buy the skin with your pay for working 1 hour.
---
While I get your point you are really exagerating. Anybody can get atleast 1 skin, 80% prolly can get the second skin. Personally I think thats more than fair.
---
You have urban evasion in your name so I guess I'm not really surprised. But if you dc you're arguably doing more damage to your team than the sandbagger. 
---
You don't play killer. You've said so yourself. Please don't presume to know what killers take what level of skill or even what playing killer is like. 
---
You sound like the dev's dick is down your throat. They're "free" but take a nutty amount of time to get assuming you have other responsibilities, making it nigh impossible to get all 3. Instead of making so people who don't have pure free time can get the cosmetics, they snuck in a little "Or, you can buy them for $10 apiece!". It's a big fuck you to everyone who either doesn't have the time or the money to spend on this game.
---
The time has come and so have I.  
---
Hatch spawns (unopened) when a certain amount of generators are fixed. Amount of generators that have to be fixed for it to appear is 5 - dead survivors. This means that that also the last survivor needs to have atleast 2 generators fixed before he is able to even see it.
---
When all survivors want to use the hatch escape (with a key) they still have to fix all generators.

1 point? Careful, don't go overboard
---
Ok? 
---
that is just sad
---
I feel like this is one of the more toxic communities out there. Sorry you got doxxed, tell em to pull up.
---
Except if I'm running BBQ and then that's a stack I'll never get so I effectively lose a nice 25% boost.
---
Plus if it happens early in the game it often snowballs then you're left with a game that contains 1 or 2 survivors trying to do 5 gens which is no fun for anyone.
---
Feral Frenzy is not that fast. It's slower than Pig's Dash and Spirit's Haunting and is only barely faster than Cloaked Wraith
---
That so stupid that killers and survivors can even interact with lanterns without offerings let alone that survivors lose lanterns after killer DC.
---
NOED. The only time its BAD to get a 4k.
---
I honestly have fun with legion. Why do others find him not fun? genuinely asking
---
You must have accidentally pressed it in your panic. There is no other button.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but
---
Leatherface’s instadown is situational and almost never comes into play against survivors with half a brain. He lacks map control and has no snowball effect.
---
Freddy halves survivors’ action speed (which is enough to stall the game a ton), has in built BBq and deerstalker, his aura cant be seen by awake survivors, asleep survivors can lead freddy to awake survivors, etcetera. If you think that freddy’s 7 seconds is relevant and his main issue, your opinion doesn’t count 😵🙌
---
STILL not getting points for escaping w/ vessel on PS4

Most players aren't meant to get all 3
---
I know. That doesn’t stop other people though. You can’t really be selfish with prove Thyself.
---
Honestly if people need more than 2 blinks for Nurse (unless they're on Lery's, fuck that map as Nurse) then they just aren't good as Nurse. As a joke, I put on Bad Man's Last Breath (fast charge, extra fatigue and -1 blink) and Heavy Panting (extra chain blink window which is actually bad, and moderately more fatigue). TL;DR 1 blink and a shit ton of fatigue. I got a 3K with hatch or 4K, I don't remember. Long story short, Nurse does not need 3 to 5 blinks and honestly those add-one should be removed and replaced with ones that reduce the chain blink window as that would be very nice. I tend to swing immediately for a hit and the times where I don't, that would actually be useful.
---
Most players are not meant to get all 3
---
If you say so. Happens to me all the time. 
---
Yeah they changed like 2 numbers today they should take some rest.
---
Game 4. Doctor. 1 kill. 17k.points
---
Looped and baited the whole game. I don't know how to counter 360s so it was frustrating.
---
Got one person at the gate with noed. Her team left her while I was hooking her. 
---
For hatchets I just practice once I’ve won or spare someone. For example I’ll aim for an exhaust on the coldwin farm equipment or the silo in Macmillan.
---
The absolute dumbest thing ever. All players should be able to get all 3, not just the select few who have the ridiculous amount of time to do so. And why should I be forced to pay to get an event skin? Why can I not just play like a normal person? You're either a troll or unreasonabley stupid.
---
It depends on how high or low you are aiming. Put on the Plaid Flannel and go into KYF with someone. You can see how aiming up or down, even as the blink is charging, drastically affects the range of your blink. It's a hard learning curve though.
---
&lt;&lt;yall hated hooks so much yah can die on the ground&gt;&gt; Im fucking crying what a legend
---
Tons of dead zones don't make someone require skill. Joking of course. What was she like as "old Nurse" not including bugs? Actually curious
---
Yea u delete all my responses... just mad cause u make mistakes writting, like everybody who have no arguments
---
Wahhh where's my free content, last event you had to buy some and we demanded unlockable content but now I can't unlock it wahhhhhh
---
Am i the only one who's never been blinded by these, i mean ive watched them take up my entire screen yet im fine afterwards
---
Ah, thanks! Good to know!
---
It didn’t used to be that way. You can instantly heal if your not the one who unhooked so my guess is it’s just another bug. 
---
Is there any pattern to where or how the hatch spawns?
---
Idc about votes
---
Cool, how would I learn more about it?

Never seen it before. Now I am so excited to see a light xD

Decisive Strike is a perk that many people paid money for. They're not going to remove it.

Meg main big brain, Claudette also has p3 flashlight, Sabo Jake, No0b3 wannabe Neas, Daddy Ace, Feng with that one head cosmetic (you know the one), Laurie can’t use her DS well, Quentin is ugly so he tends to the bush by himself, Tapp is also a totem cop, Bill is Bill, Kate has brown hair, Adam is just there, David’s have no shirt (and have big dick energy even if they don’t have a big dick),  and finally Jeff or Jesus is the only good thing that came with Legion.
---
Agreed, but there will always be those types of people that just want to deny others when they lose something sadly.
---
Kill your friends. We do it to practice using killer and perks. 
---
Now if that ain't epic gamer moment i don't know what is
---
Bubba: “I’m going to enjoy watching you die, Mr. Fairfield.”
---
For me legion is actually fun to play (i dont run franks nor do i tunnel one person sińce beginning, like really i almost always get 3-4 people need to mend)
---
As it comes to surv, its fine if he just doesnt go after you whole time, if he plays like i do, i dont find it annoying 
---
There should be more survivors, 4 times as many to be exact.
---
Yes sorry. I mean avoid long chases outside of the trap area because of her speed. BUT make sure you pay attention to what trap is going off. Don’t teleport willy nilly. If there’s multiple traps active look where you want to teleport 
---
I mean sure but my friends aren't always available to play and I can't keep bugging them to play because I want to try out new stuff.
---
I have a tier 1 so its uncommon.

Lol guess I wasn’t the only person noticing them a lot more recently 
---
Is sprint burst really among the likes of self care and D strike?
---
If the game was balanced, yes. Too bad it’s not. 
---
Both, I don't really have mains either. I just never play as Hillbilly and Ace.
---
Ouch
---
well, what wouldve you done differently then? me and another person were working on gens right between the gates. then i opened a gate. or, well, tried to. and then everyone got downed
---
The issue I have is that I have no idea where any of the lamps are. The hooking points were never the issue for me since they are guaranteed, it's the damn lamps that I have issues with.
---
To quote /r/EveOnline - Can I have your stuff? 
---
true, but why is it valid
---
You are presuming survivors are expected to have the others' well being in mind. The trap door, key, and the mechanics of how they work are custom-designed to encourage betrayal. Also this: Key Features
---
If a survivor knows the killer they're going against, if they're good, they can then plan their perks around the killer. Take Hag for example, if you crouch, you don't set off Hag's traps so if you knew you were going against her you could throw on Urban Evasion and make her traps near useless.
---
Legion is absolutely not fun. Red ranks they all use Franks something and dirt something with Black Ward. I always get chased. Stabbed twice. Chased backwards. Stabbed again and down. Not fun. 
---
Yeah. It’s an exhaustion perk. 
---
100% especially when the killer just takes that as an opportunity to be a dick to the remaining survivors. Like if 3/4 of the survivors disconnect when I’m a killer I let the remaining one farm. Even if half of them disconnect I let the other two farm until I decide wether or not to kill one or both of them. If you just kill them right away you miss out on thousands (or even like 10-20 thousand) points you could both be getting by just finishing the damn game. I’ve had 3 people disconnect on me as a survivor and then the killer just hooks me right away. Then we both get less than 10k points. Fuck that. Especially with the event going on. Points beat out being a dick and ruining the game. 
---
Actually true, FeelsBadMan
---
Unpopular opinion: I like the free cosmetics and I don't get the problem at all. 
---
They should make the killers easier to get on token. Ive played a maximum of 20 killer games and got almost nothing in return, and of course survivor games are almost impossible to get into with 10 minutes wait times
---
You mean 28 stab wounds?
---
Game 5 huntress. 1.kill.  17k points. Depip. Looped and taunted the whole match. Emotes the whole time.
---
Hit one person with noed while she was trying to break the totem. Hooked her and waited. They all tried to get her. I missed them all but I got one.
---
Only because of noed. I didn't feel badly. Fuck their emotes. 
---
It’s impossible to have a good game at rank 1, I’m honestly thinking about force de ranking just so I can hopefully find better teammates.
---
What about Omegablink or Iridiscent heads ? 
---
Key difference: we aren't playing My Little Pony here. If you disagree with survivors vs survivors you are the one degrading the experience. Don't bring your normie altruistic philosophies into my murder sim. 
---
We were facing a pretty basic Trapper. He wasn't super good at chasing, and would lose Survivors in a chase pretty easily. I assume he was new.
---
Just playing with randoms in the lobby, and we crank out 3 Generators in barely 5 minutes. Nobody has been Downed/Hooked at this point, so things were looking pretty good. *At least I thought.*
---
As soon as that Claudette got hooked once, she tried to 4% off, and eventually just suicide'd off the game. Whatever, 3 people, 2 Gens left. Easy.
---
Me and a player get a Gen to about 90%, and the Laurie is downed. She quits immediately. The playstyle this event encourages is annoying as hell for the Survivor side.
---
I can see the overwatch fandom is leaking
---
I just got my 7th coin and at this point I don't really want to keep going lmao
---
This doesn't really answer your question but the Devs had said lore wise that the Nurse's blink power is actually incredibly painful for her, which is why she breathes in right beforehand (bracing for the pain), screeches during the power, and has a fatigue right afterwards.
---
I think the intent was to make the nurses screech sound painful, so it wouldn't be a surprise if the voice actor destroyed her throat for that.
---
The "delay" is actually the new unhook immunity survivors have. As long as they don't input any movement while being unhooked, they're immune to damage and cannot be interacted with for 2 seconds or so (excluding Huntress hatchets for some stupid reason.)
---
This is why if you're getting camped/tunneled on the hook, DON'T TRY TO MOVE if the killer is right next to you. If you even touch shift or WASD, you'll lose it immediately.
---
On the contrary, if you want to be healed instantly, crouch down and tap a movement key quickly.
---
Every event is the same story, if BHVR wanted to address it they would have done it by now, this won't change
---
Just deal with it 
---
People will get salty/tilted for losing their Lantern, especially if there are only the 2 default in the game. So if somebody else takes their Lantern, they will either suicide/quit, or purposefully not do Gens to wait for that person to get hooked so they can get their lantern back. The entire idea of the event encourages a very unfriendly gameplay strategy. 
---
Yeah how dare you waste my time and try to play the game the way you’re supposed to. I’ll punish you for that by wasting even more time camping you.
---
In fairness don't most reddit arguments go the same way? If you have a problem with x you're just bad or dumb?
---
I was a killer main for a very long time and I can tell you killers that lose like this usually do so because they don't understand when to break chase to apply pressure or are just tunneling one person while the others are free repairing gens. You're allowing them to rush you by doing this. Their power is numbers. If you don't divide that power, you're doing it wrong.
---
And then those same killers come back to the dbd reddit and make meme posts like this because they did exactly what I just wrote out.
---
No one thinks hes strong lmao. Hes actually rather on the bad side of killers. But hes just unfun to play against. That is his main problem.
---
I played 5 games so far today and 3 times the killer dcd when he realized we would get the door open and leave. One of them replied back and said thats what we deserve for genrushing. Funny cause he had ruin up all game, thanataphobia and pop goes the weasel.
---
If it happens that often then try using Kindred. It might help make sure someone saves you. I personally haven't really had any problems like this. I think the even has been fine so far, except for a few bugs etc.
---
Ka-ka-kawaiiiiiii
---
If I've been juked by a survivor I camp them to make sure they don't get another chance. You made the game unfun for me I'll make it unfun for you
---
Eh, in solo survivor play, random survivors are regularly not progressing generators diligently, nor pressuring them efficiently - and around half of the time, they are not even progressing them at all, "opting" to crouch around the map or hooks much of the time, instead.
---
/s or are you serious
---
What would you suggest that would be better than mad grit?
---
I like that when people say red ranks are full of depip squad swf everyone says "nobody plays like that"
---
But say every killer is a slugging omega blink nurse and nobody bats an eye
---
Frank’s mixtape should have a downside like slowing feral frenzy movement speed considerably while possibly slowing down base movement speed a bit idk but it def needs a downside 
---
Valid doesnt always mean "good" or "respectable" in this sense that nurse as shitty as it was to camp, ended up with a 4k, she popped she got what she came for it's a valid but very cunty strategy 
---
Survivor. I'm doing the event and leveling on survivor and then I will move to killer. I play killer once in a while but honestly it doesn't get my adrenaline up like survivor does. 
---
I'm serious. It's how I play the game. If I see a survivor that's a bigger threat than the others I'll make sure he goes down
---
I get what you're saying, but I disagree.
---
My problem is that there's already enough paid content within the game. 
---
The 10 bucks price of the skins should only be directed at people who didn't participate in the event, so they can still get it while supporting the devs. People playing right now should be able to unlock everything in a reasonable (not too high, but not too low either) amount of time imo. Not everything should be monetized for the game's health. Especially since the game is not a F2P and it already has a pretty aggressive economic model.
---
And if they really want the money grab, well add a 4th "premium" costume only buyable with money. People won't like it but at least it's straightforward from the beginning.
---
I wish people would stop acting like genrushing is a thing survivors are supposed to complete gens. 
---
“Oh I’m mad because you’re doing your job!”
---
The days when you could hook trap...
---
When the wraith didn't have a bell... 
---
Hillbilly flick back when?
---
So it doesn't apply to you, but you still had to chime in to point that out?
---
Ok cool, thanks for participating.
---
I like the Yeet version more
---
I've had to solo 4 gens against a jumpscare Myers. I literally used all but 2 pallets that I couldn't make it to looping him while no one did gens.
---
Soloed 2 gens while everyone goes down left and right. Got the majority of the hook saves. Looped Myers until I accidentally ran him to a team mate by chance. Did another gen. 2 people died. Looped him again for several minutes. Did half a gen. Team mate died. Looped again until I lost him. Finished the 4th gen for the hell of it and looped him until I ran out of pallets (again, except the 2 I couldn't get to because of positioning). He then downed me and out of respect dropped me on the hatch.
---
Bad team mates make the game pointlessly stressful for no reason. Also, Jumpscare Myers is horrible. If any pallet exists, he can not catch you. He's hardly faster than you and can't get bloodlust... There's no reason to die to him unless he gets that first hit and loses you, then gets you again before you heal. Definitely fun to play against though, assuming you have any situational awareness.
---
Like others I thought this was me Legion-ing, but they got you so it couldn’t have been.
---
I just meant dc'ing on either side to deny the other points. 
---
"Unplayable" is one word.
---
I don't find the event nearly as untolerable for killer as everyone else makes it out to be. That being said Survivor has it was easier than Killer. You can literally just take a lamp and then hide in a locker like a potato and gain 45 points at the end of the match. For Killer every Survivor has to burn an envelope and you have to destroy every lamp as well as hook every Survivor 3 times for a full 45 points. They are however patching Killer point gains, thank god.
---
You can win without a full SWF and I think you're just doing poorly and blaming it on your team. Yes events always bring bad players out of the woodwork but at its core it hasn't been changed that much. The amount of DCs have been pretty bad and I hope Behavior can fix their netcode before this event is over.
---
The real problem with this event is that the grind is too damn hard. It takes *ages* to get cosmetics past your first set and the stingy Bloodweb tied with the impossible to find lamps makes the grind a complete chore.
---
Best event in terms of gameplay. Worst event in terms of gind, rewards for the player, and general state of the game.
---
I mean, yeah. But how much time did you spend putting them on dream world if they aren't together. If they play smart they will be far from each other and you won't be able to have more than 2 at the dream world at all time
---
There’s more than 4x on console, but as far as the reddit goes, killer is the more demanding and difficult role so it makes sense that the people who main that role are going to more usually be involved with the community on a subreddit for example.
---
It's a meme I'm not making an argument I'm making fun of survivor mains that use the same argument over and over again and how it gets annoying.
---
I feel like I'm talking to a wall
---
It would literally ruin those games though lol
---
The tutorial proves that Behavior can program AI (admitedly very basic AI) so I don't think it would be unfair to request some Killer/Survivor bots for an offline practice mode.
---
Yeah, why learn and improve when you can bath in your mediocrity
---
Lol wow bro.  If the other survivors aren't potatoes they just gen rush your boosted ass and then wait at exit gate for completely justified teabags.  
---
The voodoo would be cool but how would body blocking or flashlight saves work? Does he enter their body and then pop out afterwards?  Can he still attack people while controlling them?
---
If it's console, that probably was possible because the frame rates literally cheat killers out of hits. Still awesome either way, dodging that chainsaw in close quarters like that... is no easy task.
---
It's my job to sacrifice them and I do that just fine 
---
Your challenge:
---
Unlock every single teachable (if you haven't already).
---
Get your chosen survivor to P3 level 50 (if you haven't already).
---
Continue to pile blood points into them until you have every single tier 3 perk.
---
Now play Perk Roulette.
---
Nah. As long as you are attempting to improve even overwhelming losses are informative. 
---
On the other side , you get tons of time to look at your killer cosmetics while waiting for a match!
---
If you say so friend
---
Well not entirely true. You have to be good enough to at least safety pip more times than not which can be difficult based on certain circumstances.
---
Omg. You are one of those. So if someone is better than you, you camp them to make their gaming experience not fun? Why? I mean if they tbag sure idc camp. But because you cant catch them you have to ruin their game.
---
"News"
---
Might want to give this a proper flair before it gets reflaired or deleted.
---
So you sacrifice an entire match to ruin the game for one person? That doesn't make much sense. If I get the camping signal I just continue Gens. If you're willing to give up 3 gens popping on top of probably 1 more from the chase, by all means waste your time. 
---
At least they're making something.
---
If you had so much spare time while the nurse was camping then cleanse totems. Seriously. Try and do one each time a gen gets done, you’ll run into situations like this much less often.
---
Third Seal is crying in a corner.
---
Will there ever be a way for Killers to differentiate between active totems (Such as which are Ruin, Devour Hope and Haunted Ground traps)?
---
He might be fun as Killer if you have a lobby full of idiots. 
---
Very nice bait sir, seems like no one fell for it yet
---
Nurse actually takes skill to use mate. Legion IS a mid tier killer but he is not fun to go against as you can't counter him at all. He WILL catch you eventually.
---
And i'm not a survivor main. Read my flair.
---
Also, this post is nearly two weeks old. Not sure how you found this considering it won't be in hot/ new.
---
Man’s just tired of being chased and hooked, plus Freddy still gives him nightmares despite being a trash killer.
---
Well I cant disagree with you. There are plenty of money skins, but you can als buy a quite a few from the start with shards obtained through playing and alot of the sets that are auric cells only will go on sale so you are able to pick them up with shards for a limited amount of time. Im pretty happy about that tbh.
---
That aside, personally im afraid that if they would make an event skin money only, everybody is forced to spend money to obtain a certain event skin. Plus I dont think they would add a 4th skin, they would probably just make the third skin money only, or worst case the second one. We cant get to greedy, the first event we got one skin out of 6? Then everbody complained and we got a second skin for free. Now they give us 2 skins that are fairly easily obtained by playing for free, diehards can get a third one for free... I mean, thats not too shabby imo, I didnt have any ace or feng skins so im really happy I can pick these up by playing. I think if we keep wanting/asking more they are just gonna release less event skins and make it easily obtainable and that would be a bigger disappointment for me.. I like event exclusive skins, I always have in any game... its like a milestone as in I played the game at that point and I put x amount of time in the event to obtain them. But like I said, I agree with you, but I think there has to be a certain balance thats fair to casual players, diehard players and bhvr aswell...
---
WGLF. If someone gets downed, run and make the killer hit you for a stack. Then unhook for another stack. You can also try flashlight saving for a stack
---
If not camping, at least defending. I don't even camp with Leatherface, but running over chainsaw revved with 3 Stacks of PWYF always makes me happy.
---
Server glitch, unfortunately shit happens sometimes 
---
&gt; exponentially increases the match in the killer's favor
---
That's where I disagree; downed player on death hook gets everyone's attention trying to save; hooking them when there are 3 healthy survivors just forces them to scatter to gens
---
Yeah, your right. This isn’t an insult to them, it’s just a harmless joke.
---
Third seal is powerful in slug builds, and can trip up non swf
---
Sometimes these people are just new to the game so all I tell them is that they need to pressure the generators after the hook or else they will not be able to go for a 4K.  If they are willing to say gg then I’m sure they just don’t know what they are doing. 
---
Yeah, I don't get how they work on both sides. I've stared directly at one at my feet as a Killer, nothing. 
---
I've dropped on as a Survivor being chased, nothing. Is it a radius? Can you avoid it by looking up? Down? I don't get it.
---
And he has bamboozle, so it should have stopped after one loop, or no loops if the killer vaulted the window first
---
I agree that the survivors shouldn't lose their offerings if the killer d/c's either before the match begins or a minimum of 3 minutes in. Survivors absolutely should not recieve 20k free BP if the the killer d/cs. They were generous enough to give us 5k OR the actual points you earned in-game sooo... I believe killers are intended to recieve more points *GENERALLY* because as an asymmetrical game there should be an additional draw to play the solo role of the 1v4 beyond just getting in touch with your inner psychopath
---
And how did you make this meme? Like what tools did you use? And what gave you the inspiration?
---
“Lil PP killer” 
---
*dad can we buy this????*
---
*sigh* no sweetie...
---
**DEEP WOUND.**
---
I like the idea of him controlling the survivor to kill for him aka possesion...has potential to be interesting 
---
Yeah, but in this case the two sides of the cookie do taste different, so you can see how some people might like one side over the other.
---
*Completely justified teabags* Loved it, 👍
---
Nope. Beginning of the game. No gens got done in my lifetime.
---
I wouldn't consider myself an **amazing** Killer, but I always manage to float around Rank 8-10. With all of these Survivors DC'ing/Giving up during the event, I accidently managed to reach Rank 4 as Killer.
---
I don't even want to play until the Rank Reset because *hooohhhh my god.* All the teabagging, cheese-tactic Flashlight/Firecracker saves, Object of Obsession + 4-Man Squadette, holy fuck it hurts my soul.
---
Ooooh i can edit steam overlay?
---
If I die as a survivor before the game is over and type something in chat, then it stays there and can be seen by anybody who stays until the full game is done, right?
---
I agree, but the two main killers seem to be NOED and DS...
---
Finally, a match where I didn’t get facecamped
---
Oh wait, *now my character got stuck to a tree for the remainder of the match until Trapper got me*
---
Yeah you’re right, you never said that. 
---
So please say *something* to explain why it looks like you repeatedly threw a baseball at your keyboard to write your comment??
---
The morph would just be the thing from the thing. It's a great horror movie!
---
You make a fair point
---
He's down 1 sec after the clip ended. 
---
*99% level of stress*
---
This is like asking how is it valid to loop killers on Haddonfield without the need for pallets.
---
It's in the game, if that shit satisfies the that player they'll do it, and you either play around it or feed into them by giving them what they want.
---
Actually got a pallet stun and kept the chase going for a minute more or so. 
---
Rank is more about play style than skill sooo yeah. Your meme doesn't really make sense. Red ranks are sweaty is pretty much a fact. They derank because those games are a pain in the ass, not enjoyable at all, no matter how well you do. Too many people can make it to red ranks. 
---
I’m just imagining billy as a centaur but instead of holding the chainsaw one of his arms is actually a chainsaw and it’s scary. 
---
It isn't that great. It can help you get some bloodpoints because you'll get points every time you pass something.
---
Clas photo is your best pal. Having it on base kit would be an awesome buff

I like the drag-yeet one
---
Yeah counterplay would be the traditional survivor counter in general.  Loop killer while gens get popped.  You can't defend all those gens while actively chasing a survivor.  It's a good perk now but nowhere near a gameender 
---
We both agree that there should be a balance between free and paid content and the place of grind in all this, but I guess we're not on the same page concerning where this balance should be.
---
Well, let's agree to disagree then !
---
Loads of people think he's strong.  A common sentiment here is that standard play is low-tier but with Frank's Mix Tape or moonwalking is high-tier.
---
What? They are fixing are fucking problem. It’s better than not doing shit. I don’t get why people are complaining about the devs fixing stuff or in other words, what they asked for.
---
Ya, open that mouth wider you’ll fit more dicks in it, about the only thing it seems to be good for. If you want funny you have to actually comprehend jokes, or you know, know how to make a comeback? Or an insult? Or anything? The only thing that needs slicing up is your old hag of a nasty mom. I thought atleast someone would love you but I don’t even think she could
---
Maybe a Hydra with each Legion toon being a head?
---
What about back when there was only the trapper, no one knew how to play as a survivor, and you could trap beneath the hook so 100% if you rescued someone would get trapped instantly? Aaaah « good » times...
---
I can't bother to go after them legally but I reported them to microsoft
---
Haddonfield is super survivor sided. There are multiple houses with near infinite loops when you factor in balanced landing. The only saving grace for killers is when the exit gates are like right on top of each other and only huntress/hag/trapper can really take advantage of that.
---
Can you let us know what happens after your ban? I’m curious if everyone’s getting set back to zero or just some poor unfortunates. I did see some people saying that nothing changed for them when they got back
---
I like to imagine if the survivor wiggles out they just punt chucky across the map. 
---
Amanda blesses us with Tampered Timer and Rules Set no2 Game Overs. It makes me OINK for joy!
---
Daaaaaaaamn! 
---
This completely depends on where the killer is. He is probably at the hook dealing with the other survivor. Adam was probably thinking that he could open the exit gate first while you struggled and if you got out by yourself he wouldn’t have wasted time or if you didn’t he could body block a hit.
---
There's nothing wrong with you not getting free content if you don't have time to play the free content
---
You came up with this version of the idea but a killer that disguises himself as a fellow survivor has been floated around for ages.
---
His power helps him with the fact that he can lose the survivor and then see them with aura reading. So a survivor getting chased by freddy literally has to loop till they die. 
---
Relescia Petardo! 
---
I'd say for me it's usually 2 or 3 pips. 
---
Interesting, but this gives me an idea.
---
How about a perk similar to knockout. So it would be something like when a survivor is within 10/15/20 meters of a hex totem the totem appears dull for 3/5/10 seconds.
---
I'm a Feng Min main now bc I love her new cosmetics so using her new head, top, and bottoms!
---
Gotta love the DBD community.
---
Maybe just give offerings/add ons back when theres a 3v1 or the killer dcs during the loading screen ( no one really likes wasting strong items that you probably lose in a 3v1 ( nit saying its impossible to escape but it sucks) or as a killer, when you get in a game against 3 people with strong add ons and it end like instantly so you actually spend more BP on the add ons than you get from the game
---
Ooohh. That's something useful to know! Thanks! 
---
Pig is the weakest killer IMO. Crouching does nothing but slow you down and her traps are only good end game and are hard to set up for end game since they need to be downed.
---
What do you usually wear with her though? Wearing her bandanna is a lot different than her sci-fi stuff.
---
I'd love an empty map mode to practice Nurse blinks. KYF doesn't work without any friends. :(
---
Time to abandon ship! 
---
I’m new to the game, but I tried playing the legion at a friends house. I don’t see why the legion isn’t fun to play, I really enjoyed them 
---
I did say it was irrational.
---
I was going to say killers/survivors, but it made the text too small for my liking.
---
Oh I was using Kate before wearing her prestige 3 cosmetics 
---
Mamma mia release-a-the-fucking fire-a-cracker.
---
Don't worry, I have rilasciato it and I did it really fricking well
---
Correct: Popular Opinion.
---
Besides bugs the event itself isn't bad.
---
I use the Deathgarden mask on Meg with her streetmeg jeans (retro sneakers) and her new disco shell jacket! 
---
Or just eat the DS lol
---
Ah, for Kate there isn’t much to work with. I think wearing her prestige is better than wearing her sweater (climber works too) with brown hair like literally everyone else.
---
It's too easy to pip, puts a lot of potato killers and survivors in a rank they don't belong. Causes problems for everyone.
---
Right? I swear the community has to always find something to complain about. At least the devs listen to feedback .-.
---
"Scum" and "garbage human beings" might be a bit of a stretch. If the game makes you this angry perhaps cut your losses and play something else?
---
Now that is colorful. Meg has a lot of cosmetics but it seems like everyone wears the same thing with her.
---
Oh yeah I like her darker hair but unfortunately don't have that unlocked so was using her blonde hair instead 
---
I’m a fan of being colourful, then cries when I’m always found! Haha. 
---
How dare you use a perk!!!!!!!!11!!!11
---
That's impressive. Really impressive
---
I think that’s why most people wear their prestige clothes.
---
wasting*
---
This, is a tactic I started to do recently, and it really helps when I am not playing my main killer (Doctor). It helps apply that all needed pressure, especially when you don't have perks like Thanatophobia or Ruin.
---
I would stick with what you were wearing. Stand out from the crowd ya know?
---
Ebony Mento Mori and No One Escapes Death should be reworked. Especially if the Devs improve end game.
---
I’ve been having lots of issues both playing as legion and against legion. Idk if it’s a bug with the character or what. 
---
It's fine honestly. Sure lanterns could be worth a little more to make them an actual objective worth your time, but 3 points per hook is solid. Unless you suck complete ass killer now makes more minimum points every singe round. Sure, a surv who gets a lantern out does get more, but that has the conditions of 1. escaping 2. keeping the lantern alive that long 3. being the one who gets the lantern since its unlikely every living survivor gets to have one in the end.  
---
Especially Claudette! Funnily enough, I’ve got about 2.3k hours and I just P3-ed her. She’s pretty much my last P3! Haha.
---
I'd like to see you source...
---
LEgion design is shit - should just have had evil survivors. Evil Nea that gets close to you and has to cloak up to attack you. The paranoia. The mistrust. Would have been awesome but instead... fart.  
---
No one paid for Decisive Strike. People paid for the HALLOWEEN Chapter. Big difference.
---
THAT LOOP IS AMAZING!
---
Noed yes, but DS you can only juggle if you are close to a hook
---
I think that’s what he meant. It would be like Rainbow I guess.
---
Agreed
---
"Just never pick up the obsession" - Yeah, cause that is real solid counterplay.
---
I don’t think you’ll find that here dude. Just play the game and find someone cool enough to gameshare.
---
People are just not thinking about it the right way. They see this and think, "one point, what the heck?" and don't consider the accumulation. It will make a noticeable difference for them once they actually play
---
No you're right. Ive just read too many posts like this one and i can relate, because Ive experinaced it so many times myself.
---
And i have been playing less, theres too much garbage to sift through to get to the fun parts of the game. 
---
I play solo and killer at red ranks and you can only witness the pattern of boosted toxicity so much. 
---
This exact thing happened to me once, I added the killer and we were both just as confused, I think he had to DC eventually.
---
Same thing. People might've bought the chapter for the perk. If not, they still paid money for a chapter with 2 characters and 6 perks. Removing one because people get upset that survivors run it is not going to go over well.
---
But they'll always know it's you if you take the form of downed survivors
---
and good god it's a 105 speed killer? how the fuck is it supposed to get that first down?
---
Angel Myers
---
Nea had seen everything, it was time for her to leave
---
I always go straight to where I found it last time, then if it’s not there I check every other spot I recall lol.
---
Or I let killer find it. If I have firecrackers, I run around, set those off, let killer hit bc they think they’re grabbing me, then jump in. If no firecrackers, I just go finish a gen or open exit gates. Ya’ll know I carry that *thang* on me (Dark Sense)
---
The worst part about events.
---
“Nurse is fucking Nurse”
---
TRU DAT. 
---
I don't want to perk removed, I just want it reworked.
---
PC too. It'll usually stop once and then I have to start the heal again.
---
OP wants it removed, so that's what my reply is aiming at.
---
Picture this... Shirtless Myers with wings
---
Oh, ok. I see now.
---
In 600 hours, I’ve never seen this game have such accurate hitboxes.
---
My boi Ace looks dapper as fuck. Grey blazer with red dress shirt, the event red pants with the black and gold shoes, and the slicked back hair with the shades.
---
I want you to read what you typed out loud to yourself, and then think about how every sentence you wrote contradicts every other sentence you wrote.
---
Understandable. Do you agree that the perks needs to be reworked?
---
Deserves it for playing legion tbh
---
I like to peacock so naturally I have an extensive Nea wardrobe.  Currently I rock her newest green head with the MJ thriller jacket and either her or black white stripe pants, red schoolgirl miniskirt or her booty shorts.  Previous to that I'd rock pink facemask nea eith her premium Jean jacket and same pant options.
---
That is how you pull off a Daddy Ace. (I would put on the massive mustache)
---
Ds can be lessened with perks, or you can get LUCKY and be able to dribble them 3 times, but it nowhere near counterable in the same way as need. Let alone secret non-obsession follow ups.
---
It’s next to the exit gates or shack like 70% of the time 
---
Leatherface and The Legion are definitely gonna need some love but The Wraith is fine.
---
The way I am, I'm just a good late game player. I get 1k maybe all game. But the moment objectives change to the exit gates is when I get my 3k. I don't know why I'm better at that point but I'm never sad when they get 4 gens done before my first kill. I'm used to a weak start.
---
Here comes all the complaining...
---
Hence why I never run ruin. I don’t think it’s worth it because it always get cleansed instantly and I don’t want to have to try and guard it
---
Sick
---
I mean, there are counters (NOED has a better counter than DS) and both perks can be very annoying under certain circumstances. So, I wouldn't mind if they'd be reworked, but I certainly wouldn't lose sleep if they didn't.
---
Yes! Oh and since I didn't comment on the original drawing: Looks cool!
---
Naw
---
That's totally fake but nice try.
---
Thank you I really appreciate it :)
---
Yeah but what do you know? 
---
Literally just played a game where I put down the marker right next to a gen, and the survivor next to me was just like... surv.exe stopped working
---
Always get it out of the way as early as possible. 
---
HEH
---
I'm not even all that frustrated about an ebony memento mori. It's a very rare offering that is gone once you use it. NOED on the other hand isn't even a teachable perk meaning everyone has access to it and killers can equip it as much as they like
---
Leatherface DLC is currently $2.79 due to the Lunar New Year Sale, so, now would be the time to buy it if you are thinking about it
---
Stop. Trying. To. Solve. Hexes. With. More. Hexes.
---
I would love to see both No One Escapes Death and Decisive Strike reworked but I'm not sure if they'll do it.
---
For survivor I main Tapp and wear his prestige hat and pants with the investigation suit torso.
---
I also like Feng's new hair with her prestige clothes.
---
For killer I main Michael so not much, I like his prestige mask with default stuff
---
Killer cosmetics I worry about less due to not being able to see them
---
that wouldn't change it's shitty nature to play against lmao.
---
The slicked back shades is the only head cosmetic on him I like,. All the others are so weird looking xD
---
It's not like they keep hiding the totems more and more... Oh wait...
---
BuT MuH BlOoDPoInT EcOnOmY
---
After all this exchange you're still incapable of expressing or understanding nuanced thought. I'm gonna leave you here then. Enjoy your day and/or night !
---
I'm the same way I exclusively play Michael but I wanna try huntress I've been trying to learn for a few days now but it's way harder than I thought especially with jukes I think training for survivors would do well too I like both sides but I'm not the greatest survivor
---
Damn you are basic meta killer. Those perks, you a noob.
---
Flashlight-
---
Can be used repeatedly to save your friend from the killer tunneling them the whole game, making nearly every chase pointless.
---
-get good
---
I made it with paint.net
---
You shouldn’t have blocked their names. They shouldn’t be harassing girls 
---
Looks like your connection dropped.
---
im sure he is one of these people who complain on forums about survivors being too op. 
---
I had a killer DC at the load screen and got 25 points for it, did you not get points when the killer did that?
---
Petition to replace the Legion members with Lincoln Park  all together
---
i derank for fun the higher ranks are just toxic i usually bring in lower tier perks and try to let the survivors have a good time
---
just take the ds, one way or another you’ll find that one survivor again. then, at least you won’t have to deal with it anymore.
---
Considering that someone famous (within this community) has been accused of pedophilia,
---
Probably should have used better wording.
---
LOL
---
I REALLY hope we get some kind of killer like that eventually. Just some kind of brute yeti thing with a club .
---
Im an ACE main who runs gold nugget jacket, his red hat, and his moonrise pants
---
I constantly have to play white knight for Legion. Should probably change my flair to "Legion's lawyers."
---
Anyways: Legion is simultaneously the best and worst Killer in the game and it is entirely because of how piss poor their addon balance is. Legion has one of the worst baseline powers in the game and while that is an incredibly bold statement given that Killers like Doctor do virtually nothign with their power I honestly believe that Legion flat out *can't* use their power without addons. The movement speed is too slow, the duration is too short, the recharge time is too long, and the self-stun after using it outweighs any chance of using it for mobility and being a shittier Hillbilly.
---
Legion is not a Killer. Legion's addons are the Killers. When I see Legion in-game I get annoyed yeah but when I die to Legion I don't think "Oh Legion so OP" I think "Oh Frank's Mixtape so OP" or "Oh Stab Wounds Study so OP." Inversely if a Legion doesn't get a single kill and has Smiley Face Button and Friendship Bracelet I kinda just sigh a sad sigh. I want to go pat that Legion on the back and say "sorry you didn't know that those addons are just bait."
---
I think Legion at their core are fine and while I do agree that they are basically Nurse for stupid people I think they're fun to play and can fundamentally be balanced around time to kill v.s. ease of use. But as their power is right now they are awful and can't be balanced when anything below green tier (excluding etched ruler which is a pretty nice alternative to the lower cooldown addons) is trash and anything that's green tier or above breaks the game. (And their Ultra Rares are worthless garbage.)
---
Their base stats need to be tweaked massively as do all their addons. They also need new Ultra Rares and I'd honestly say that Frank's Mix Tape and Fuming Mix Tape should swap rarities.
---
Yeah, I don't get this fear at all.  I never have problem spotting Claudes even in the darkest area like MacMillan's.
---
Sam Albert for president
---
Should be putting down the doctor's too
---
remember when hex wasnt a thing and every killer had noed pepperidge farm remembers 
---
My only guess is it's because we don't have dedicated servers? If anyone else knows correct me lol. 
---
Yeah I figured that. I just thought it was kinda funny 
---
In the case of Legion/Jeff, I'd go with this route as Jeff's alternate outfit is a joke.  It's just a coloured version of his normal outfit.
---
sounds like a lot of hooblah to me
---
If they added Chuckie I'd imagine giving him some voodoo powers would only make sense. So being able to pupet a survivor and make them yeet themselves onto the hook would be pretty fun.
---
Though I have to admit basketball star Chuckie throwing a three pointer every time he hooked someone would be very funny to watch.
---
[I included "voodoo" in my Chucky concept. :\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9coxzs/childs_play_chapter_the_toy_chucky_powerperks/)
---
Where we're going we don't need Decisive Strike to flee
---
I mean from the games that I played.
---
How do you manage this outside of the game/lerys when the ruin spawn map exists?
---
I’ll double pump his ass if I see him
---
Link
---
Not much of an exchange, you just don't understand you're not entitled to free content lol
---
i felt this on a spiritual level
---
Gotta agree with this.
---
He may also noticed that the killer isn't coming towards you.
---
*aggressively points*
---
It still was a heavy concept but I wanted The Morph to be borderline dependent on his ability to shapeshift into survivors. The 105% movement was probably a mistake tho.
---
Quentin main with his p3 clothing cause that's all he has ;-;
---
Hopefully your hair comes back.
---
At least it would have less people playing with it.
---
its probably not based on the gens done but on the momentum. survivors have the momentum at start, all 4 are free and out of sight and with no other real objective than gens, so first 2-3 pop like crazy, but after you hook someone, then  1 guy is on the hook, another one is trying to save him and you chase the third one, that leaves 1 guy on the gens if he is far enough away from you. also every hit on uninjured survivor is around 1min15sec off the gens, giving him humble 35 sec to get far enough to feel safe and 40sec for self care. the killer play is all about getting the ball rolling and keeping people busy with saving eachother 
---
No they dont and thats not the point. The point is that whoever the Legion finds the chase is not interesting nor exciting its boring.
---
Legion doesnt need purple add ons to cheese chase mechanics, they can use Bloodhound and exploit the deep wound timer being based off chase to down survivors with no counterplay. The purple add ons only make it more brain dead to play. 
---
Fantastic point. I know end game how to find them and I have ways to demand their focus.
---
Upping the hooking and vessel points by one each doesn't seem like it's gonna do much
---
He's got the coolest head equip for that, if that's any consolation! 
---
I got out of my way to make sure you did if you’re good. OR I abandon chases with you and kill off your friend in hope you do something stupid trying to save them 
---
Not always. A good Freddy will put as many people to sleep as he can before chasing one of them.
---
It’s still better than nothing.
---
Ik what the killer POV is like. I just don't understand how you snuck around the generator.
---
i thought it was the 9999
---
Theres no excuse for the game running like it is on console. We just have to wait for the “optimization PASS” in like fucking April and thats if they dont lie to us again. They’d rather churn out cosmetics and DLC killers they dont even playtest and ignore all bugs found in the PTB than fix consoles.
---
I never said that it's not a valid strategy I'm saying it gets annoying when it's one of the things survivor mains says when people bring up gens getting done 2 fast.
---
Me and my friend figured this out. You no longer need to hold run to stop those actions. Simply tilting the left analog to move stops them now.
---
