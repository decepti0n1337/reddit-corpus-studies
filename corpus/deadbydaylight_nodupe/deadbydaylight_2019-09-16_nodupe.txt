I've seen that happen many times on here. Nice.
---
---
---
So much drama! This is fantastic! You really captured the attitude of The Pig.
---
Afraid of chase/ confrontation = immersed in my opinion
---

---
There are fringe cases where it helps for altruistic plays but not worth a perk slot
---
you picked a great angle and that lighting!! ugh op you did Great
---
&gt; you also can‚Äôt be reported for it either
---
Technically, people can report whatever they want.
---
*happy Pig noises*
---
Sounds cool, i like it
---
My god. Imagine thinking that you actually want to end and survive a chase is the same as being immersed
---
You're entitled to your wrong opinion dude. I'm not gonna bother arguing with you on this
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

I know I‚Äôll get downvoted but he looks special(like extra chromosome special).
---
Yeah, I lost my touch with geometry dash. After I beat Yata it just kind of went down the drain, but thanks for the support!!!
---
Who is it?
---
This is a serious problem. Not even just for this community.
---
And I'm not interested in immersion perks. Just cause it turns Spirit's "guarantee down on injured survivor" back into a regular 50/50 coinflip doesn't suddenly fix the problem with the killer either.
---
The hardest thing for me about SWF is that I need friends ):
---
I ply ded by dylit on my consle
---
That's pretty harsh. Especially since it was an intentional bad frame taken by me for the sake of it looking silly.
---
Looks like those gd skills got transferred to huntress skills. Those were some great snipes.
---
it doesn't work since she has Stridor
---
I definitely preferred killer adepts when the requirement was just a 4k. The whole pipping system is kind of dumb imo, it's hard enough to do adepts at better ranks without ruin, bbq or other handy perks. Coming from a survivor main, you hardly have to try for their adepts, just run the perks, play the game and you'll get it eventually.  So yeah, I agree they should switch it back, not sure why they changed it in the first place. If they want adepts to be more challenging, then they should probably change the survivor ones as well.
---
He actually broke his whole ribcage I think
---
Is AFK farming bannable? I have been leaving my game open while doing other things to get shards, I'm barely playing until I get enough to buy another killer.    
---
Also I DCed (i.e. crashed) and went down to rank 17, was that supposed to happen?
---

---
His GT is Deadeye Scout
---
Not having even more toxicity pointed at your face from your teammates because you're playing a survivor that its not on the meta/High tier, its a fun thing
---
Being able to enjoy a character exclusive skin wothout worrying that the character is trash meta wise, its a fun thing
---
I'll use an example from a SIMILAR game, Identity  V
---
I cant play the characters that i like the most and want to have ranked badges on, because they suck in general metawise, so i get shamed for playing them
---
I cant have variety whem i'm killer, because every match is the same survivor, and i know exactly how they're going to behave everytime during the match
---
At least not having something unique besides skins, makes them almost unpredictable from the lobby
---
Sure, i'll think every survivor will have their strongest and most used perks (Laurie with DS, bill with unbreakable, etc), but its not thar i'm foing to predict everymove because theyre using X specific character
---
This is a shitty mindset
---
Available at Walgreens
---
Shaming other players, nice. Totally not against the sub‚Äôs rules or anything.
---
TBH, the shouldn't have even attempted lore in this game. It is ill-fitting for the nature of the game to have any kind of story.
---
They didn't NEED to explain why these characters we are playing with keep reappearing in the world. It's dumb, they should have just used video game logic, it is just a new round. When I replay Ocarina of Time, it isn't like Link is being summoned again to replay the same trial in a never ending loop. This game created (stupid) lore to explain something that didn't need explaining.
---
Haz de Freddy un degenerado
---
The crawling guy escaped
---
Had this problem for me as survivor, It got really annoying not being able to see certain corners with something like that in the way
---
That build *would* be fine without Botany Knowledge.
---
https://ibb.co/b3SN3KT this the what looks like now, kinda on the small side but idk how big I should go
---
I got called a tunneler and camper yesterday but i got a perfect game so yeah lmao
---
Plague is Spitter from L4D
---
If she was on heartbeat then she would‚Äôve gotten time anyway
---
For anyone wondering - the pic was made by me, but the whole concept was made by artist named Mugges on Tumblr under the name "draw the squad" (basically making a lineart for others to use to add their own OC/characters/etc).
---
I just think her story would make a great movie. I think Huntress would be interesting as well.
---
The Shape....
---
Thanks first time doing 360s .i had fun with this, hopefully I‚Äôll improve later on.
---
The point is, terminal yoshi was the dwight's crawling, the feng was smokey whom left before I even left, I went down and the killer should have downed me from full Hp without using a lag switch
---
How can you all be so fking rude... nobody gets to choose what theyll look like. Besides he cute
---
That's why my last sentence says to change it to 4 sacrifices
---
I wat a cheate reported that's basically it. Cheaters dont deserve to play with people who play correctly
---
Wait a second...
---
Shaming a player for cheating is pretty justified
---
As someone with 600 hours on xbox/pc I can say that I can only 360 half the time. It's hard but so damn fun when it goes well
---
Again, could be a lag spike. Also, I get it now. Yeah, she would‚Äôve gotten out there. Still, use the on game report feature and don‚Äôt shame players in the forums. Delete this before the mods do, unless you want a possible ban.
---
Is this a god dang JoJos reference?
---
Monitor and abuse
---
Naming and shaming isn't cool, it's still just a game and I'm not really on board thinking it's cheating, doesn't look like it. Honestly you sound mad salty.
---
Spirit or nurse because aesthetically I think they would transfer well on a big screen plus seeing the nurse float would be cool! Also seeing the floating pieces of the spirits body would be cool too! And both have such great lore!
---
It‚Äôs not. Rules are rules. Imagine what they would feel if you began shaming them online if they got an unwanted lagspike.
---
inb4 Gibby is the entity.
---
Dude. Stop. It could‚Äôve been an accidental lag spike. Stop being such a jerk without getting all the facts.
---
It's not really supposed to be used often. It's more of an emergency type of deal to use if you're about to go to your second tier struggle, if nobody is bothering to come get you, if people are being chased and busy, etc.
---
No it‚Äôs not. You are going against the rules.
---
I'm salty but I survived? More like the dude was pissed that we sabotaged his hooks and a lag spike for over 30 seconds? Doubt
---
It‚Äôs even worse than the other too. Cringy as hell.
---
As seen from certain perks and with the most recent establishment of the EGC. The Entity has full control at all times, it can block vaults, gens and the exit gate for survivors and killers. It doesn't allow the killer to leave the trial and blocks the survivors from certain actions when certain prerequisites are met.
---
With the addition of the EGC, it shows that the Entity could literally tear apart the realm and just up and kill the survivors on the spot. So I would imagine if the survivor tried escaping or fighting the killer the Entity would just intercept, also why the Entity doesn't allow killers to outright kill survivors either unless making an offering or after working towards it.
---
That‚Äôs my song! üòÇ
---
Nice.good job.gonna need that extended hidden blade.
---
I mean... I‚Äôm not sure what else you think it could be used for? Deliverance or not, you couldn‚Äôt get off of the hook second phase anyways and that should never be a thing unless someone helps you.    If you‚Äôre the last one alive, the killer would literally put you right back on the hook unless you had DS, breakdown, unbreakable with it, with a key, and knew where hatch was or were near an open exit gate. But why use all of those perks for a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù.   
---
It‚Äôs fine the way it is. It‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs not entitled. It‚Äôs good for solo if no one saves you. It‚Äôs great for a 4man swf so they can stay on gens and you can get off by yourself.
---
Again, can happen. I never said you were salty also.
---
Lol
---
I just want free auric cells. Hee hee.
---
Head traps don‚Äôt count. It‚Äôs by your ‚Äúown hand‚Äù so mori only. Traps are not your hand.
---
Depends on some of the add-ons to the bell. Wraith main here and I believe theres a add on that gives you a small speed boost after coming out from invisible.
---
I kind of agree. I think they could of made it work if they put MUCH more thought and planning into it and got better, more experienced writers for the job.
---
Either go big or go home. They half-assed it. And now we wait to see if the new archives can salvage anything.
---
Yeah but he does have a pretty good speed boost
---
Ohh okay, thank ya!
---
Noed is really balanced, but its counterable to make it that way. Adrenaline is often compared to it, however that actually rewards you for getting to endgame and finishing the objective. Noed literally rewards you for losing, and therefore is counterable.
---
Clicking on your username is a trip haha.  Just a variation of this kind of dick measuring over a videogame over and over.  Must be boring being you.  I sincerely hope you are still a teenager and this isn't your final form.
---
Its cool I usually wait for them to load in and if I see them bring items I put on franklins and become bubba's basement usually get DC after first hook
---
If you try to chase someone else when the gates are open, you will get zero kills, not more than one. That's why you should because you WILL get more points than letting that person go for free.
---
You must be a baby dwight. Stop trying to change the status quo. Go back to hiding in your locker
---
wait until he finds out about nurse
---
A number of issues. How many ppl are on the same router, are you downloading while playing, what are your speeds (use test my net for accurate numbers).
---
Lmao, we‚Äôll see about that
---
Console or PC?
---
Hehehe
---
Its kind of a spoiler
---
She burned the thief alive in the fourth part of her story, where you get her dark side costume
---
Now we getting into extremely literal sense
---
If ya wanna be that literal then I *can* report that guy over there for simply owning the game. I *can* report you for no reason other than you have a reddit account
---
See the problem with being too literal? So many darn tootin‚Äô many possibilities that can be ignored by just sticking to basic literal.
---
Ah yes. Wraith. One of the absolutely best killers in the game, with absolutely no dependence on addons whatsoever.
---
Dedicated servers are coming tuesday, so dont worry about it. It may be that you were connecting to people in a different country or region or maybe you had a fluctuating internet. The game at this moment is peer to peer connection so if anyone has bad connection to you, you'll be laggy
---
Well, if your in the open, then your not safe against any killer...
---
The whole point of wraiths power is so that if you spot him you get a pallet in between yourself and him before he finishes uncloaking. 
---
The speed boost is nice, but not that OP, even with the best add ons its pretty good, but at that point you might as well play moniter and abuse Billy. 
---
So no, wraith isnt broken, just a bad situation you got yourself caught up in.
---
Point being?
---
No idea.
---
Pc
---
SAPRKS FLYY!!!!!! Lol
---
A lot of people are saying that you‚Äôre not going to see good nurses on red ranks!?! Lmaooo. I have 3 friends who are GOD at nurse on PS4. It takes practice but yes, you can 100% master her.    Maybe 99% because those pesky frame rates might be annoying.
---
All I think of here. "PFF, Rank 20 killer and survivors"
---
??? I have close friends who are red rank nurse mains who are unbelievably amazing. So this comment isn‚Äôt that true
---
You do look cool.
---
Mind telling us how she cheated instead of showing us poor connection issues
---
You should atleast be able to use it if you are the last one alive, i know that alot of killers just face camp untill the last person dies but some killer go away to kick gens and destroy pallet.
---
Just me and my wife, no downloads, speeds should be fine the router is 10 feet away but I‚Äôll test it.
---
I‚Äôve been skimming the sub for about 20 minutes now and this is the first thing to make me giggle. Thanks
---
This is so cute! The Clown art usually kinda disturbs me, but I love this.
---
You could argue those lines are just wrinkles.
---
Try using Bloodhound, it's one of the Wraith's Perks. It's really good for people who are new to playing killer. 
---
While you don't have to play them, it's a good idea to level up Hag and Nurse for Nurse's Calling and Hex:Ruin.
---
I can tell you right now you should not be doing competitive gaming over wifi
---
&gt;An African woman will have a white Russian daughter......
---
it he
---
you‚Äôre whining about survivor mains... We just think that noed is a stupid perk because it rewards you for losing. ‚ÄúJuSt Do ToTeMs‚Äù I hear you screaming from your monitor, ‚ÄúI cAnT StOp AdReNaLiNe.‚Äù Well yeah, it would be  useless if it was counterable. Adrenaline rewards you for doing the objective and getting to endgame. Noed is counterable because it rewards you for losing, and killers are either way too weak, or way too strong, so that can completely change the game. Thank you for your time.
---
You know you're insulting the art of a literal CHILD, right? And he damn well draws better than most people.
---
The lore was pretty bad on launch, but I think BHVR is getting better at explaining how things work, reading flavor text and descriptions on how everyone was pulled into the world and how things work and how survivors and killers are bound by certain rules can be pieced together. I personally hope the Archives further the lore and explanations of the game itself and not just character lore.
---
We know the Entity feeds off the everyone, not just the survivors, but the killers as well most of the cast was forced here and aside from a couple exceptions on the killer side of things don't exactly want to be here voluntarily. Especially evident with Trapper and Wraith who show signs of torture for initially going against the Entity.
---
This weird realm is basically purgatory existing outside of time. Everyone is probably not dead per say, but they aren't exactly alive anymore either. They are basically the Entity's forever. This is evident with the licensed characters Bill, Pig, and Tapp being pulled into the realm as they were dying in their respective game/movie and can also be seen in other character's lore in that they were either isolated or in a tragic accident right before going missing leading to the assumption that they could've possibly "died" as well before being pulled in, I believe all 4 OG survivors were lost in the woods in some fashion and other characters like Adam or Jane were met with tragedy before being pulled in.
---
The lore also shows signs of the Entity having a stronger and stronger pull as the game goes on, shown with Kate and Clown where they were just grabbed or with Plague where the Entity manifested itself as Aldiris' god to convince her to do it's bidding.
---
While it seems like a shoddy excuse on who is stronger/weaker than each other as we have a wide array of muscular and slim cast of both killers and survivors, everyone does still ultimately seem bound to the Entity. As it will likely have the power to just annihilate anyone who goes against it, whether it be a survivor going against a killer or a killer preemptively killing survivors (keeping note Michael is the only one who can do this without "permission" from the Entity and it usually displeases it).
---
It's not perfect but the lore is actually expanded in a more coherent layout that can explain MOST things about the game and why they work the way they do.
---
Sorry, you are out of luck. The developers don't give people their Legacy prestiges. Lost my Legacy 2 Dwight back during the Nightmare on Elm Street hype alongside my save, so I know how you feel. Hopefully they change their mind about it someday.
---
They're probably just going to nurse her again because they hate her tbh
---
This is at least funny as hell.
---
I‚Äôll give that a try I‚Äôve always done a WiFi connection the past 2 years, used to play a ton of siege and never had issues with that.
---
Hag mor√≠?
---
Ubisoft can afford better servers lol
---
Kate forgot her key. I had a brand new part and half a soft pretzel in my toolbox.
---
The fucking Nea is like "You guys are hoes, let's flashlight these babies and bounce."
---
&gt; If ya wanna be that literal then I can report that guy over there for simply owning the game.
---
You absolutely could.  Won't go anywhere, but you *could* report people for owning the game.  Lawsuits are the same way - you *can* sue for whatever, but doesn't mean it has any merit.
---
This looks great! Got a hidden blade?
---
People need to stop being toxic?
---
I saw this match live and you were a scary good huntress, I didnt get to catch your name and I asked chat what it was but I guess no one saw my comment anyways I wanted your twitch and im so glad you posted on reddit so i could find you again!
---
Haha yeah man
---
Very clever. Take updoot
---
Like I said, don‚Äôt need to be too literal here. I only emphasized how unnecessary it is for you to be that literal. Being too literal complicates things to the point of losing sleep at night because you spend the dark hours thinking about all variations of something depending on how literal it can be.
---
I love the state of the game right now. Why do I play against a huntress with iri head and belt, if i can just dc, depip, derank, and go against worse killers. At this point its a win win win. And I hate it
---
Thank you
---
That's actually amazing!
---
Wraith Without Addons: Low To Mid Tier At Best
---
Wraith With Addons: Mid To High Tier At Best.
---
Discordance level one is amazing. Iron maiden will be good once the st update comes out. For now use Thatnataphobia, Discordance, Nurses calling, and pop
---
you didn't know? hitting survivors on the hook killers them faster /s
---
^^ joke btw. don't waste your time camping your first hook.
---
Impressive throw.
---
This is a pretty obvious lag switch. The Dwight crawling into a wall is a dead giveaway.
---
Ds, borrowed, dead hard, adrenaline
---
Why?
---
I dont see the shitpost tag anywhere mah dude
---
First two should definitely be Sloppy Butcher and Thanatophobia.  That pairing on him is incredible.  Last two you have some room with though I like to choose from the following to round out the build.  Either Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Save the Best for Last, Discordance, etc...
---
I don't know what Edward did to you to but he deserves better
---
Sarcastically say something like "thanks for the kind comment, I was doing my daily"
---
assuming this was super recent, just an fyi, sloppy butcher doesn't affect hatchets anymore, not sure if it is a bug though
---
You look like The Pig.
---
indeed
---
Thats a pretty decent build atm, I'd switch out Thanat for a chase perk (brutal or enduring) or M&amp;A
---
ty
---
Huh, I never really wanted to use them but now I really don't! They are limited edition!
---
what tier of iron will? if it is 3, it is possible the killer is using stridor
---
This jean seems a little bit brighter than the one in the game and I think it fits perfect
---
Okay so two things could be going on there;
---
* You are running Iron Will 1 or 2. Only Iron Will 3 can completely remove the moaning.
---
* The killer is running [Stridor](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Stridor).
---
You made a thing!
---
Face camping sucks but it's the survivors fault for being so stupid haha.
---
Agree, you look cool.
---
If you don't have it at max level you're not completely quiet.
---
me: *sees rancor* , *decides to locker spam to get the spirit to find me* , *I play my trap card* ,*narnia juke*
---
Is haddonfield suppose to be difficult for killers?
---
Didn‚Äôt really answer my question.. I need help having more control over gens cuz I can‚Äôt even commit to a chase cuz they look me around the whole map and by the time I‚Äôm down w them all gens get finished, I‚Äôm not exaggerating in the slightest. Must be my luck cause apparently these rank 1 streamers go up against bots every gameü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Rude but I was also going to say this, it's like when people post Jason stuff because ahah funny comic about killer that isn't even in the game but whatever
---
higher ranks should give you bp or iri shards at rank reset. there‚Äôs really no reason to climb aside from seeing yourself get better. there‚Äôs no point in rank reset without something coming from it
---
U could say that this perk would stun the killer for 3 min and being a killer main I would love it just seeing a shirtless David running towards me and tackling would be worth losing the game üòÇ
---
Though if he was expecting mercy...
---
I played against a huntress with iridescent head a few weeks ago. She downed three people and all three of them disconnected when they were downed. I was the only one left. When she found me she wanted to farm....uh, no? If you needed blood points you wouldn‚Äôt have ran an add-on that ends the game in 30 seconds. I dced too. Play h o w e v e r you want to, but understand what follows.
---
He‚Äôs like the coolest
---
I believe there is no scream or notification but the exposed still happens. Need to test it though.
---
I know it‚Äôs your personal tier list but why is micheal in D he‚Äôs super fun to play
---
Oh okay 99% of the time I‚Äôm in a party with 2 of my friends.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
You could only get like 2/5 ENTIRE OUTFITS free
---
Boo fuckin hoo
---
Plague should be only rituals and how dare you clown is really fun and I‚Äôm totally not a clown main.
---
Good on you. I try to give newer players a break - especially when you can tell they‚Äôre learning the concept of the game or have teammates that DC.
---
I wanna see Feng Min put the trapper in his place
---
If they've got balanced landing it's a bit cancer, otherwise it's just a mildly annoying map imo. I don't really like it much as survivor either.
---
What an... interesting interpretation of what is fun to play. You know what? You do you. Glad you know what you like.
---
It'll get the account investigated if enough people have reports about it. They'll glaze over the account for suspicious activity and if they're actually cheating, likely reprimanded. If it's just shit wifi then nothing happens.
---
They‚Äôre stupid for not having a chance to save their friend? Thats the kind of logic we don‚Äôt need to have in this community
---
Do you count pig's "mori" with a reverse bear trap?
---
For real! Those legs lookin fit and smooth!
---
Can you explain how you cheat on xbox? Cause, as a person who's been playing the game on xbox for two years, I've never had an intentional cheater. Just people with shit internet. And no, it's not justified. It's a video game, dude, getting him harrassed and banned is kind of silly
---
Also prayer beads Spirit. Absolutely no counter.
---
Haha, funny nea killer joke, please, just no
---
Oh ew, how hard was it to earn the currency? And did the outfits available at least look good?
---
Meg has been hanging around with her BF, Dwight, that she too loves locker now.
---
Haha it looks like there's 4 different art styles in here
---
Alright thank you
---
I like how wraith isn‚Äôt even there
---
Oh. In ps4 it's the only way to give bs so
---
This need more upvotes we need the devs to see this
---
My thoughts exactly. He‚Äôs at least a B
---
Just happened to me and my friend as well.
---
Oh shit, you emphasized entire, could you get parts of all of them? Just not all, or am I misunderstanding?
---
Do you have console? I‚Äôm only asking because I‚Äôm doing exactly that and I hope you can watch me play and tell me what mistakes I‚Äôm making. If I‚Äôm spending too much time on a survivor then I leave em and go to gens, but it‚Äôs rinse and repeat for me. I leave that survivor and I go to a gen that‚Äôs getting worked on and I chase a survivor and then have to go back to that gen. Rinse and repeat the whole game. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just the plague because I usually don‚Äôt have that much trouble w any other killer
---
Supposed to be hair
---
This is a meme train I can get behind
---
They are stupid for all going in on a face camping Bubba. It sucks and I've had it happen to me too but the smart play is just to leave them and go do gens.
---
ik lmao is joke
---
It‚Äôs the hair
---
Idk I‚Äôd put him at top you can do so many interesting things with his add ons
---
Just now noticed the eyes in iron will, let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre acne
---
Y e s
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten that far yet, but so far I can‚Äôt disagree
---
Good one, I like it
---
Not bad. Good work!
---
Yo play both, keep both
---
Literally so accurate to The Pig in the game! Good lighting, too! c:
---
Baby killers
---
Jump scare Myers is super fun to play
---
Yea, each outfit had 3 parts
---
6 Pieces, and you didn't even have to get them all from one set just grab a hatchet for huntress and the outfit for dwight and the apron for claudette or whatever mix
---
What platform do you play? Ps4 killer que time is almost instant. Sometimes at like 5 6am it can be maybe 5min.
---
Legions my favorite imo he's my most played but I have to say they're a weak killer one of the worst at the moment in fact but still the most fun for me.
---
Plauge I haven't played too much of so i can't help you there.
---
Spirit is one of the best killers in the game I think performance wise and she's not too hard to get the hang of imo.
---
So if you ask me, Legion for fun spirit for wins and plauge? She's alright
---
It makes perfect sense that she would be all about that.
---
These are facts I can confirm
---
Oink
---
And you were right
---
Spirit is one of the strongest killers but people will probably hate you. Plague kinda depends on the survivors cause of the cleanse mechanic. Legion is pretty good for farming BP.
---
Depends on how you have fun, spirit is a decent killer which can be fun, but the satisfaction comes from doing big brain plays rather than phasing a hitting at a loop, sorta like how huntress can cross map.
---
Great!
---
I think it would be fair if killer dc'ed you should be allowed to cleanse all totem and do all gens. Or just let the hatch open and give survivors the bp equivalent to those objectives.
---
I have a rework idea I‚Äôll post it on r/DeadByDaylightideas if you interested
---
I Mean, default michael its too repetitive.
---
Hmmmm you have my attention
---
ur opinions my dude
---
Yes, its a pretty standard combo so don't be surprised if people catch on early. I'd recommend Bamboozle higher than Spirits/Enduring combo myself though (shack can be a pain, even worse are the combine harvesters)
---
LOL and my last post was a meme about wraith
---
This is really cool. Where did u get her jacket?
---
i agree with him
---
Spirit. Legion is kinda bad and Plague is awful.
---
Coming from a Legion main who hate Spirit btw.
---
very cool cosplay! :D
---
Yes
---
I was taking a break from the game during that one so it‚Äôs the only event I ever missed :(
---
its staring at me oh god

Played my first game ever, sucked as a killer, and immediately received a message saying 'gg'. It's little, but it's a nice sign of what this community is like.
---
Id be happy with 0 bp just to get rid of awful offerings like 50% more survival like thats not even paying for itself.
---
I like the pants. Yep, the pants.
---
I think we should be able to get at least half of what we bought them for
---
Honestly bamboozle is a great perk, i used to the stupid infinte loops and as you said it helps with shack too
---
If it's part of an event, I'd imagine they'd be continuations of The Hallowed Blight, especially considering some of their names.
---
Yes I don't bother playing nurse as well lol. But like I said, Bloodhound is amazing if you're starting out. A Nurse's Calling can literally be put on anyone with Sloppy Butcher for an effective build.
---
Also don't worry about ranking up, red ranks are really not fun unless you like going super tryhard. Rank 4-8 is the sweet spot where games are just right but try to get Ruin asap, it will make your life easier.
---
Also keep in mind the next update is going to let you pick 2 out of 4 perks on a character that is level 50. If possible just save up you BP for Tuesday, you'll get more bang for your buck if you have someone at lv. 50.
---
There is a YouTuber named Not Otzdarva and he makes really good guides for people just starting out. I recommend you check him out.

Ghost face I feel like they could get a whole series of movies from it call it scream where he only targets kids in high school maybe keep it a small town I‚Äôd like that movie
---
Ok this game sounds absolutely insane, I can't wait to get into it more. Great story!
---
I'd take out nurses and Thatnataphobia for Monitor and Abuse(Doctor) and Infectious (plaugue) if you don't have these perks I would use whispers and Save the best for last. If you only have Infectious you can switch m and A for Distressing

---
You mean Double BP?
---
It's rumored there's one next weekend, but in the end it's up to the devs.
---
It's meant to be a situational perk. In certain scenarios it can be a lifesaver.
---
I think the perk is massively overrated and I would kinda like to see it buffed so that you can unhook on second hook, but I think as it is it's honestly fine.
---
u do

Janes too thicc she would crush killers like legion, Freddy, pig, ghostface, and spirit

I checked his profile too to make sure it was actually him

To time it perfectly the surv must be literally right next to you. If a surv flashlights you, you failed to hit them away and face the other direction.

Yeah and it happens a lot (they fail 80% of the time)

Atm sometimes 2 perks appear on the blood Web but you can only grab 1. They're changing it so that 4 perks will appear on the blood Web the level 50 but you can only grab 2, you'll understand when you get a character to that point.

Yeah, just today while he was streaming too when I asked which Killer was his favorite/main

There's a way to run the game without letting EAC start up as well. Look online about that

Go to YouTube and search ‚Äúdamnnohtml how to run all generic map tiles as killer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a 13 minute video. It sounds like you are having trouble mind gaming/ catching survivors/ running tiles the correct way. This should help you end chases faster.
---
Please more Icarly DBD memes! These are great
---
PS4 sadly, is there a way on there?
---
I'm crying right now, probably the best thing I've ever seen from this game
---
I clicked and read your comment right before it opened up and I panicked harder than the disco
---
Exactly and that's why play really fair with them and send them a GG they deserve for playing a killer that's trash and don't camp,tunnel etc
---
Hold the button you use to run and move the analog stick foward, it cancels the action

"Jeff, didn't we talked about your face makeup thing? It scares me now than the Legion!"
---
I‚Äôd suggest puking on all the available gens first (the ones not affected by Corrupt Intervention). That way the survivors are forced to work on them and get sick, or wait for the effect to pass. Either way it‚Äôs beneficial to you. Once people are all infected (if they don‚Äôt cleanse) they‚Äôll be easy to find since throwing up is noisy and they can‚Äôt hide in lockers without infecting the locker, too.
---
If they do cleanse, you have your projectile weapon that you can use to end loops.

Bubba and pig mains be in full zen the whole time
---
I was trying that, along with every other button but it didn't seem to do anything.
---
Yea ik that puking on gens is key and it helps u out a lot but I keep forgetting to do that.
---
We Legion mains wait together
---
But if it's rare then she's not OP. A requirement of being OP is that it's relatively easy to get a good payoff.
---
I mean, you could actually clearly hear her.  Lockers actually really need to dampen noise.
---
You haven't seen Tru3's devotion level then. lmao
---
haha! every point counts, eh?
---
- I see what you did there
---
Yeah I figured not since you're tagged as "bloody meg" and this was clearly a very salty, very toxic, baby Meg who couldn't handle getting a chainsaw through the sternum and chose to fuck over her team, then chose to BM me over xbox chat. You seem to be a respectable person so you're definitely not her.
---
Funny how you can't use strategy as a killer otherwise you are toxic reminds me of a game where I had 2 of 4 survivors hooked on one side of the map and all the unfinished gens where also on that side of the map guess I am toxic for not running to the side of the map I have no business on and not letting them get the free un-hooks or finish the remaining gens.
---
I need fixated for my claudette heheh
---
Is this rank 20 gameplay?
---
I would love to play as Sebastian omg
---
I'm assuming PC because killer lobbies on there can be ridiculous sometimes.
---
Is this 100% a known fact and not something assumed? If so then I apologize, but if it isn‚Äôt then it‚Äôs kind of wrong to assume
---
I down them sometimes to waste survivors time healing them cause they either dont know they're afk or they want BP.
---
Literally did not say that you should be able to wiggle free /every/ time you get caught. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand where anyone is getting these over exaggerations from. I am suggesting that the chance of escape from wiggling could be slightly higher, because as it is now, and has been mentioned, typically you‚Äôre lucky to make it half way through the wiggle bar before you‚Äôre hooked.
---
Really the only time you have a chance to escape with wiggling is if the killer is feeling cocky and wants to try and put you in the basement or if your team of survivors body blocks the shit out of the killer - which barely happens in random matches, might I add.
---
I‚Äôm not asking for a guarantee escape, but the odds could definitely be balanced a little more.
---
I‚Äôve literally had it where a killer had walked me halfway across the map, and despite wiggling to the best of my abilities, managed to only get 90% wiggled free. Which is fine, like I said, I‚Äôm not asking for a guarantee, just a little bit higher chance.
---
I played two matches tonight to max my BP.  I had a DC first game and an AFK the 2nd game.  I don't know about rule, but I get my BP and stacks off of them before they DC.
---
I'm not sure if he's come out and said he is a product but he shows all the signs. Even though he is that doesn't mean there is something wrong OR something he could control
---
To be fair, the whole ‚Äúomnipotent spider‚Äù thing is just kind of how Eldritch Horrors work in general if I remember correctly
---
Just warning u your 2 saved completed dailys might disappear after you complete your 3rd. This bug has been around for awhile and it just happened to me again last night
---
what an epic  survivor gamer he reminds me of the type of survivor that 360s into a hit that would have otherwise missed or comments GG EZ in the post game chat after hiding in a locker all game and getting the hatch after letting all their friends die.
---
normally they should be TPed
---
Imma break this down simple
---
OP is paranoid, disabling EAC before it starts up will remove any chance you get caught. OP doesn't seem to understand that yes, you can get banned, will you? Nope. And you cannot have the game running while you change the icons, coding doesn't work like that
---
Why distressing and unrelenting?
---
People are using things I don't like so I am going to make sure they can't get points.
---
All I can say is I wouldn‚Äôt say anything unless I knew the facts
---
Aye. That's super cool, I dig it ALOT. Youre extremely talented
---
Actually the struggle animation is kinda lenient I just press the button slowly, not like I gotta keep at a certain threshold or something.
---
Yeah, i was in a match as a survivor Bubba hooked then slugged someone who was afk. A survivor who didn't know fully healed the guy who was afk. 
---
Its like just DC if you're gonna go AFK ffs
---
Okay, thanks for the tips
---
and he deserves all the love and more tbh!
---
Thank you so much!
---
Played my second game of doctor where all the survivors escaped but one of them was nice and gave me tips on how to play doctor better.
---
That felt nice
---
Nobody cares about your comment, we're here to enjoy the meme.
---
I down them, and dribble them to injured state in the weirdest spot on the map I can find.
---
Downvote gang
---
I mean it is for those who have school, a job, and multiple other activities. I can only play about a match or two a day so being at 900k is an accomplishment for me
---
This is me when I haven‚Äôt played in awhile and can‚Äôt remember the skill check button lol
---
It's really just a joke ever since she was added to the game, her face model looks kinda ugly.
---
I hate play against clown too
---
I'm not saying the nerfs weren't contextually justified in some way, just that the pig was already middle tier at best and has received multiple nerfs regardless.
---
There were 7 outfits, iirc? 5 killers, 2 survivors.
---
he‚Äôs tired of your bullshit guys :(
---
30k as a survivor?  If you hit that number either the stars aligned or you're a survivor god and the stars aligned.
---
10k as a killer (with bbq)?  
---
Your general premise feels right but the numbers seem a little off.
---
I did that this time, was rank 1 and after rank reset depipped to rank 14 and got Ghostface and Clown.
---
That we can agree on.
---
Plot Twist: It's actually "Darn"
---
I fell in love with it at first sight, and the wonderful artist gave me permission to make a poster out of it. I'm very fortunate :')
---
Neat. Im bouta check out some Eldtritch horror
---
I‚Äôve seen those perks here (or on some other sub) already and I‚Äôm loo lazy to check if they belong to you or not, so I‚Äôll just leave that there
---
Im a little confused on DbD terms, can someone explain basically what this means)
---
Thank you for clarification!
---
Walter
---
It's kool. I was just seeing if the bug was still in the game. I know it's been around since the Plague release
---
This is awesome!
---
How about you do a gen you deGENerate
---
"You've got the spirit." (Pun intended!)
---
Low ranks, hillbilly, and an afk teammate, I'm not that surprised they dc'd honestly
---
Its just pointless to argue with you, you are so cought up with your own skill and probably rank that you purposefully ignore the fact that a new player literally knows nothing about the game.
---
&gt;It's not that hard to do gens, cleanse totems or help save teammates.
---
For a new player, yes, they will ocatinally get cought off guard it happens to most if not all new players, but ok he **could** have atleast been doing gens, cleasing totems seems pointless to new players so they don't bother (and no, in the moment they won't suddenly know what NOED is so that isn't an argument) and one guy got mori'd and the last two DC'd, so.. Who exactly is he going to save?
---
You are acting as if he is going to play the exact same way every single match, eventually he will learn what the crown mean and what to do, either that or he will be scared off and leave. 
---
But sure, just down them and mori them instantly so that they learn every little nuance of the game in that one match.
---
Freddy should be allowed to use his thicc lung during chase. He inhales so hard that the survivors get pulled closer to him.

Can confirm. Play on PS4 and the only killer I actively hate going against is Spirit.

Nah you bum

You want Dead Hard to be a mobile Head On?

It would need a token charge time. Maybe a minutes worth of chasing the killer to keep with David‚Äôs character?

Unable or just unwilling?

Ability is too confusing and broken for a killer. Perks are eh but great idea
---
 *Betrayal intensifies*
---
Rin's STAND [The Shattered] is more powerful than your [ Locker Tendency]
---
Do the killers ever hang out? I'd seriously like to know, I love the comics and the samination series depicting the killers interacting.
---
It's Butters!
---
I love that for the first few seconds you look like you just got thrown towards the killer
---
I hope not. I don't think it would make sense to just throw away the model they worked on. It just kinda seems like a waste, and I don;t think people hate it as much as everyone acts. is ee plenty of Quentin Mains.
---
Jigsaw woud be proud

People DC to often when i play spirit... not when i play omega nurse... just spirit..

He downed him and didn‚Äôt pick him up because he suspected the survivor had decisive strike. And he‚Äôs saying that thats a bannable offense which is wrong.

i like the "The Camper" name for him, like a play on camping the hook but also cuz of the story of F13

Way to take the jokes 100% seriously. People are just fucking around, of all the people on the Internet, n00b3 isn‚Äôt going to care what people say about his appearance. You stepping in all ‚Äúbuh-but he‚Äôs a person too, stahp being meanies!‚Äù makes you look like an immature fanboy.
---
Ah yes, another man of culture as well
---
The only thing I do in that situation is patrol the hook, while trying to get myself an altruistic survivor. 
---
Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose. But it's always fun.
---
Hell is not an escape
---
You can buy them rn, i think
---
Aura reading perks aren't necessary with Scratched Mirror. The only required perk is Monitor &amp; Abuse
---
Or,  you know, they felt bad for you being the only one left and wanted you to get some bloodpoints
---
30k survivor game is like best case scenario. and 10k is a very low bad game. idk I've had my fair share some amazing games and some very horrible games. I'm not giving averages I'm just giving the BP windows I've seen from my time played.
---
Good survivors usually won‚Äôt cleanse, so plague is pretty much the only killer that actually benefits from running thanataphobia
---
Welp. I foresee a new meta. That sucks it takes away the notification. I really relied on that.
---
Looking Nice
---
People are really quick to try to find instances of wall hacks or smthn. I think I had somebody ready to jump the accusation gun post-game when I was Meyers, saying I "came right at them after hooking somebody, so unless I have BBQ..."
---
I had BBQ. That snipped that right in the bud.
---
I don‚Äôt have Thanataphobia tho :/
---
Gets to leveling nurse then, gotta get those unlocks at some point
---
Calm spirit is very situational though. Nobody actually runs that perk most of the time
---
I‚Äôve um kinda already level 30 with plague just trying to get her perks. Nurse is next though also every match I played as nurse I asked for farming and people were nice enough to farm with me
---
But really tho why is this her *exact face*
---
Remember you don‚Äôt have to play a killer to level them
---
I know, but I just feel like I need to
---
You're not playing spirit right
---
I get Cannibals doing it ***wayyy*** more often in my experience
---
I would like if you vault during dead hard you are immune to damage for the duration of the vault. Dead hard is great for the first time you use it. After that lol
---
Cue*
---
This has got me thinking. When dbd (inevitably) goes offline :(. The final DLC should allow you to do some sort of challenge where you can use each survivor once. If you get all to escape with a certain amount of points you could win a t shirt or some shit
---
Unbelievable.
---
Tapp getting smaller and further away in the middle of the screen was like a ytp or something I love it
---
I dumped hundreds of thousands of points into hag, clown, and ghost face to complete my Freddy build, it really is easier to just level most killers without playing them if you aren‚Äôt good with them
---
I guess I can try that then
---
But for right now what perks should I put on
---
Oh wait, no I meant roblox, sorry for the confusion.
---
I started dying as soon as I started getting yeeted off into orbit haha
---
addons are Scratched mirror and boyfriends memo, use the glasses or the jigsaw piece for an indoor map(possibly the new map as well though i have not tried it yet) and then perks are somewhat dependent on personal preferences but play with your food can be fun cause pulling people off generators doesn't take a stack
---
E for ez skill check lol
---
With how few teachables you have, it hardly matters, throw whatever you find effective on until you have the perks for a proper build
---
But they'd have a different kit at that point. You might like playing against it.
---
They could just give China a separate build that contains the censored moris
---
He's the best streamer i think. Skilled, creative, fun and wholesome. Other streamers i see always miss at least one
---
You look amazing sweety
---
This story makes me smile, good for you and keep up the good work
---
Just hide behind peoples cars and when they get to their car scream and chase them away.
---
Other than M&amp;A, common perks on jumpscare Myers are Discordance, Haunted Grounds, NOED, Nurse‚Äôs, and Rancor. Be sure to burn that Lery offering as well for maximum spooks.
---
Did you seriously post 2 of the same memes back to back in diffrent formats? Couldnt make up your mind?
---
Consle? Also, that's debatable. Unrealistic assumption. There are good and bad killers on pc like there are on console. Simple as that. I've seen both sides on both ends.
---
The DLC drops on my Birthday I can't wait :)
---
Key word "thought", its not true at all you DO look cool

Have the devs said anything about changing Freddy's vision in the dreamworld since that one time they said they were going to alleviate the fog and dreamworld effects? Freddy has the worst vision out of any killer by far and it makes it difficult to see immersed people more than usual. It looks like somebody left ten thousand smoke machines on in there and turned some of the lights off.

I get it. Im just not big on the joke. I think it's mean and discourages people from doing the cosplays they want, especially given the wave of actual Legion cosplay hate that started afterwards.
---
I just don't understand lag switching on dbd.....you literally gain nothing in the end!
---
NURSE
---
I tried to make a Captain America joke ;-;
---
I‚Äôm really hoping for some Halloween costumes for the survivors
---
He's streaming WOW
---
Trust me Calm Spirit will never be meta.
---
I'd say with the right build and survivor mindgames, Freddy is his own inherent slowdown. But that's just my opinion.
---
Probably Nancy‚Äôs too XD
---
I want to kick baby survs now
---
I suggest watching fungoose streams. I think its not your peeks or addons, but your basic plays as a killer. When to commit and when to switch targets. How to track survivor locations. Although ultimately if you cant down survivors gen will really go fast since a hooked survivor generates a lot of pressure to keep them of gena
---
Same

The best DBD YTer easily
---
That looks awesome, great job!
---
You looking at him with your character or with the middle of the screen?
---
One of the best action movies of all time
---
Yeah Omegablink Nurse would probably be the only thing to really get over to the locker in time to capitalize on it.
---
It's on the coming soon section. You're able to pre-order it there.
---
They were delayed to fall.
---
Since you are a new player, I definitely recommend going through the in-game tutorial, it covers a lot of the basic stuff. I even checked the tutorial about teachables and the explanation isn't that bad:
---
[Tutorials: Teachable Perks](https://i.imgur.com/Z9zoqO2.jpg)
---
This is awesome, I‚Äôm so happy for you. Super impressive how good your accuracy is!
---
Bruh, same. I play on low graphics and 0 resolution and the game still stutters and lags. It's hard to be excited for the new dlc, or playing most matches in general. :(
---
No idea who they are
---
Toxicity AND anxiety.
---
WE'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR
---
That or maybe Billy boy
---
a ding ding ding
---
Shift like from F13 the game
---
Because I would've killed them anyways, so it's their fault if they blame me for "tunneling" when I see them injured (1 hit) vs the rescuer 2hits), even though the real person they should be mad at is the dumb teammate
---
Gremlin from Gremlins Killer
---
You start off with the base perks at lvl 1 but you can only equip 1 perk if you‚Äôre level 1. The more you level up your character, the more perks you can equip at a time (max of 4 perks)
---
The Operator (Marble Hornets) or if you don't know what that is he's essentially slender man but better
---
If he‚Äôs leaning at the right angle don‚Äôt even try just run to cover and make him move out into the open
---
Is this the head and jacket from Trick Or Treat Studios? I‚Äôm thinking about getting them for Halloween this year. Fantastic job!
---
*laughs in trapper*
---
No infinites with balancing landing for you, p3 Claudette who thought she is so smart with her flashlight. Enjoy the basement hook.
---
Dude it's ridiculous on this sub.  OP literally posted a video of urban evasion actually being used correctly and got shit on for using it.  
---
According to this sub, the only survivor  perks you should be using are dead hard, decisive strike, borrowed time, spine chill, or adrenaline.  And even adrenaline has some controversy.
---
Oh this is nice! Do you know who drew it?
---
*laughs in inner strength*
---
Run resilience, self-care, spine chill, and dead hard. Grab Adrenaline from Meg to replace self-care if you'd like. Use spine chill to know if the killer is coming, dead hard to yeet away from a hit, and with resilience, if you get out of a chase go hit up a genny while you're injured for the buff to repair speed, and 99% your health with self-care before doing the gen so if the killer comes over you can quickly pop the heal. Also a cool bonus, with spine chill and resilience active, your vault speed gets crazy fast in a chase.
---
Damn.  Upvote because these assholes are downvoting you for reminding them that new players exist.
---
Me: does literally every generator finished
---
Others: and-a-campcampcamp 
---
and-a-tbaaaag
---
and-a-leave the last person alone yet somehow make it out because the hatch was literally right next to where they were as they were about to be picked up
---
this song is taking me back to some places
---
Did they even put it into the patch notes? So instead of bringing WGLF up to BBQ's level, they drop BBQ down. Wonderful.
---
I use Monitor and abuse, BBQ, Nurses, and Ruin. I don't have any problem killing. I usually don't do T3 much either. T2 with barely any terror radius works great.
---
Good point, didn't think of it that way. Don't really need the BP though, so it was neither here nor there to me.
---
Why are you getting triggered
---
r/unexpectedjojo?
---
Actually enduring cuts off 0.9 secs.
---
Yes. Just got this yesterday as a matter of fact.
---
I didn‚Äôt know I needed this until now. Thank you kind sir/ ma‚Äôam/ other!
---
Yeah. As long as you hit them with the shock therapy. It can't be from the static field increasing their madness.
---
Chinese lunar new year.
---
Alright thanks for clearing that up, did it take you long? It‚Äôs the second last achievement I have left.
---
They did I'm pretty sure, they also changed the actual use of the perk to be the same range of aura reading so that BBQ 1 wasn't useless of only seeing survivors on opposite ends of the map, but in turn nerfed the BP gain aspect of it.
---
Head-on dodged?
---
Alright thank you! :)
---
These look like the guys from my last killer match üòï
---
Well, but that's not how we are treated.
---
I like the sentiment, but after 3 years of DBD i have finally given up on trying to be Mr. Nice Killer :(
---
I hope you can infect more people with positivity, maybe then i could bear this game for longer than 3 matches a month xD
---
And?
---
They need to change the Adepts to just getting Merciless regardless of perks since skill with their power is far more important than usage of their perks. Considering how ridiculous the repair times are, you'd need a team of incompetent solos to get Adepts with this new emblem system.
---
Bob Seger, Killer
---
Bill is on PS4 too.
---
My estimation is that I have played a few dozen games with the doctor so if you main him for a few days or so you‚Äôll be good. I would use high stimulus electrode as it‚Äôs a god-tier addon for Doc and will get you more shocks.
---
If you say so. At rank 1, some are bound to be good.
---
Also shock tbaggers at exit gate until they leave
---
Oh, well here‚Äôs hoping!
---
Ive got the OG clunky Xbox One and this has never happened to me. Maybe your Xbox is overheating?
---
Dude that‚Äôs wicked!! Love it ‚ô°
---
Clown
---
There is no point in using more than one Survivor since they all function the same. Minor differences is how stealthy they can be overall with their body size and vocalizations when injured.
---
I should‚Äôve thought of that, that makes sense. 
---
Anything neat come with it?
---
I don't see anything at all.
---
Boots from Dora The Explorer, killer
---
Did they loop you to hell or beat the shit out of you?
---
And overused
---
No it‚Äôs not overheating    The game was fine before the ghostface update but since then I‚Äôve only played like 5 times due to being unable to play
---
I‚Äôve seen a ton of red rank Nurses that are really impressive on console. So yes, she is worth learning. She just won‚Äôt be the S+ tier killer that she is on PC. More of an A tier.
---
That's actually an interesting idea, I like that a lot!
---
Ok thanks
---
Overcharge isn't good. Ruin is pretty much mandatory if you want more than a 5 minute game, BBQ for BP, Thrilling is decent, but Overcharge isn't very good. 
---
I use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's, and Brutal. Most of the time I don't get to stalk people because of Spine Chill or Ghost's stupid outfit giving him away. So I just use the Shroud to sneak up on people. Might get a hit, might get a grab. Who knows.
---
looks like my self portrait
---
this keeps me playing this game when rank reset drops
---
Okay, just making sure. Thanks!
---
I have never heard someone complain about how loud the game is. Sounds like it's a problem on your end, and it doesn't make sense for them to cater to a very small minority and tinker with something that is fine as is. Sorry if I seem like a dick, I don't mean it that way and I feel for you. That sucks that the audio is painful for you. 
---
Are you on PC? I'm on PS4 and have no issues, but maybe your PC has issues with it's audio cards or whatever. I know nothing of computers, though, so that may make no sense.
---
I don‚Äôt plan on playing much killer but I might look into it
---
There was a comic made that was even more DBD-centric, cept it said ‚ÄúDing dong your opinion is wrong‚Äù
---
How is it that the pro players tend to be Davids?
---
**Disney would like to know your location.**
---
A bit dumb to nerf the best part of the perk. Extra BP makes dealing with the game's nonsense more tolerable.
---
you're not a she?? immersion ruined
---
in terms of maps, Family Residence, Haddonfield, Blood Lodge and the Asylum one with like 7 unmindgameable pallets in the center building all need to be looked at. Family residence is huge and turns every single survivor into a blendette with how many bushes there are to hide in, not to mention how easy it is to lose track of them in a chase if you‚Äôre in the center of the map. Haddonfield is just extremely survivor sided and practically any killer but nurse, trapper and hag struggle here. Blood Lodge is practically 90% unmindgameable pallets so unless you‚Äôre playing Nurse, Spirit, Hag, Huntress, or (to an extent) Trapper, you‚Äôre basically an M1 killer. The Asylum map just has way too many safe pallets in the center building and the map itself is also big as hell, so basically no gen pressure unless you‚Äôre playing nurse or spirit (or Billy to an extent).
---
Yup, DBD needs more crazy old men.
---
holy cow. it's bad on PC too but not this bad. it's just people teleporting on PC and getting us survivors to run into walls instead of vaulting and things like that. yikes.
---
Not OP but a really nice addition to any build
---
Won't take you more than 5 to 10 matches if you do nothing else than shock people. Obviously it doesn't get you any sacrifices and people could hatemail you for it but it gets the job done faster if you just want go get it over with like I did. I don't really fancy playing as Herman.
---
Yea, at the very least BBQ 3 is still the same, just sucks for people who have it stuck at tier 1 and 2.
---
No joking, How about a hex totem that hurts you. If healthy then injured state, if injured state then dying state.
---
I thought we were talking about Tru3Talent.
---
You're not the only one...Its been like that since it came off, disgustingly broken and still no one fixed it...its good that I barely play against him anymore, but I dc everytime I see that the killer is Ghostface
---
Is Pig weak? I‚Äôve played a handful of games with her and 3-4K everyone of them. I don‚Äôt think gems have ever been finished when I was pig. That being said I‚Äôm not a terribly good killer, I really only do well with trapper, huntress, and pig (maybe Freddy if I didn‚Äôt immediately get 2 DCs every game). I feel like pig is really solid.

&gt; Imo BBQ is not all that amazing, all it does is maybe tell you that someone is across the map. 
---
Which is great for the top 3 killers because they'll be their either very quickly or very quietly. 
---
&gt;That being said, the reason slugging creates map pressure is that that someone has the pick up the downed person while you're chasing another person
---
Sure but instameds and once they are up - You are a hook behind still.
---
&gt;If they don't pick up the guy by the time you down the new guy you are chasing, then that is two people that they have to save.
---
Only going to happen with potato survs, Anyone with a brain will be able to tell your slugging and run over to res.
---
"King" isn't his last name, it's his rank.

I called it op jist to draw people's  attention really. I don't  consider anything  that doesn't help you in a chase or slow down the game to actually be op.

Say sike right now
---
Yes I am. Tru3 tweeted talking about the comments on a meme saying they were circle jerking each other. I am saying noob3 doesn‚Äôt tweet that and that‚Äôs why I like noob3.

Which update?
---
Feel like We could attach a Piano Sinister theme,I‚Äôm legit hearing a piano when I look at this photo.
---
Great Photo btw.
---
Which one
---
Yeah, when I play versus freddy I just assume if he can see me he can hit me.
---
Family Residence I don't have too many issues with honestly, the blending thing is kind of annoying but once you find somebody, the pallets are pretty spread apart and a lot of them aren't that good imo. Haddonfield we all know is a fuckin issue lmao, and Blood Lodge you're right is also pretty bad. Asylum I'm not so sure on, certain versions of it can be pretty bad but if you can finish chases before they make it to the central building or just drop chases that head in there, I think it can be okay. Maps definitely need to be changed but I feel like it would be better to adjust more in general things like repair speed and common meta perks first and see how that plays out and THEN move on to adjusting maps. As opposed to the BHVR special which is nerfing everything at once and making a super Killer-sided patch. Also I know it was PTB and is subject to change but the stranger things map is like... really bad from what I've seen and played. Prepatch torment creek amounts of pallets and it seems like most pallets have a fairly strong vault right next to it.
---
omg looks great :D whered you get the coat and howd you make the mask?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d4vy3v/just_got_reported_for_exploiting_as_legion/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yes. PC is objectively the better platform because the game is designed with PC in mind and it hss less performance issues.
---
If they want to waste a instaheal when the killer isn't around let them. Lol
---
Also, you aren't  a hook behind, you have just as many hooks as you would of had + map pressure. Think about it, if someone goes over to res them then that  means there are three people not on gens. So unless the person you're chasing is a god at looping (in which case you should give up the chase and go back to the downed guy or the guy going for the res), you will get a hook and force two other survivors off of gens. Look at the alternative scenario, you down a person and hook them instead of slugging. Now you either have no idea where a survivor is exactly or they are on the opposite side of the map, either way you will be wasting time looking for them and they could all be doing gens during that time.
---
Top three killers? Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly? Nome of them are particularly quiet. Lol
---
The top 4 killers are about the only killers that can really use BBQ efficiently, I'm talking about killers in general. That being said, a lot of Nurse and Billy players also use Infectious Fright because it allows them to snowball easier. So if your argument is that it is required because "the top 3 killers use it" then Infectious is, by your definition, a necessary/great perk.
---
No0b3 looking like the killer himself
---
Played a game where I didn't kill anyone as Nurse because I'm baby and got a message after the game saying "You'll get there eventually Nurse is hard" and that made me quite happy
---
If you are looking for people to play with hit me up - I‚Äôll be playing on Tuesday :)
---
It's terrible! That's how two people died, they hook rushed and got hooked together in the basement that's why I took him away and ran him the whole time the struggled and died, and then enough time for her to do a gen maybe two. He wasn't even good. But they refused to do anything,  everyone is scared to do gens. If it's skill checks, main feng for technican,  and then get her teachable to use on someone else until you can hit them. They're so many helpful perks, and half of them run sprint burst and I think that's why they crouch walk NON Stop, when lithe is a 100% more useful. My mind is just blown at how bad people are in green ranks, like how did you get here? Lol
---
If a killer uses NOED, they aren't good.
---
I like this.
---
The fact that you don't get anything for losing one of the more rare and stupid hard to have obtained cosmetics and you just get told "shit luck get fucked" is the most bullshit response ever for something you cannot fuckin control on the players side. This is why people hack Legacy back anyways, because people are losing it and they fucking shouldn't be.
---
100% truth,  which is sad seeing how this is a team game. If you don't wanna have a team,  play killer!
---
I'd argue that it is sort of insane on Billy, and maybe Spirit, as well.
---
Nurse is op in general so everything you use on Nurse is just salt in the wound.
---
I'm still in lower ranks (15) but I love some legion pretty much mained him from the start as killer. They're a bit underrated especially if you know how to play them, they come with 3 good perks (always use discordance for pressuring survivors off gens and mad grits good if survivors are close or hook blocking when you down some one and recently switched that too iron maiden and its been working good too) and are good at finding survivors from frenzy even though it rarely downs anyone with deep wound. Don't have the best add ons though(fuming mix tape is horrible but iridescent pins are great, usually just use legion pin and something to increase duration in a normal match.) Usually get my best matches as legion too, about 40k to 50k with offerings but no bbq, usually get 30k unless I'm not doing good at all. Only problems I have are I wish there was more to the concept of legion.
---
Too many I don‚Äôt know :(
---
Srry idk them
---
Ps4? I'm starting to need new people to play with. My friend isn't always on and I only play with one occasionally 2 other people.
---
That‚Äôs nice, your pretty good
---
Thank you!!
---
Every single time.  I'll switch to killer and think, "I'm just gonna relax and have fun, farm some...then I get the most sweaty, toxic 4-man teabagging, flashlight clicking, hook sabotaging team in existence.  Then I flip the fuck out and turn into a try hard murderer.
---
My survivor rank is typically twice as high as my killer rank, (rank 19 killer because I hardly ever play it), and I *never* get matched randomly with survivors that fucked up when I play survivor...so yeah.  I bring moris for the swf toxic fucks.
---
Dead hard will now allowed you to beat the killer up- dead by daylight devs 2020
---
That‚Äôs some pretty cool artwork
---
I'd probably say 9-11 for survivor 7-9 for killer.
---
Yo I have a PS4 I‚Äôm on rank 13 rn because of rank reset but I was in purple ranks, if u want to run swf sent ur PSN username so I can add u tomorrow
---
You must be a killer main then. I experience same thing
---
Was waiting for him to dump all that on his face tbh.
---
That boy has the devil‚Äôs own luck
---
Cool
---
Hatchet bunny obviously:p
---
People might not like these facts but most red rank nurses on PS4 are using M &amp; K
---
I second this.  Having my console plugged up with a LAN cable makes all the difference.
---
Like around a 4 or 5 tbh
---
I remember using nurse when she first came out on PC at my local games shop who were doing a spooky competition, had fun. Then I remember her using on PC and just breaking and sitting on a hill spinning in circles be wise I was so awful with her and the survivors tried to get me to chase them but I just didn't have the heart for it.
---
Okay cool.
---
Wasn't an actual question tbh I just wanted to spark discussion. I use Infectious on Billy and Legion all the time.
---
Killer 4k achievement pretty much only comes if you double pip

imgur

I see then sometimes.

I normally judt kill them because the repeated crow sounds are annoying.

Naa once again, its kinda orgasmic to get the 4 injured but there is no other special thing u can use. He is fun

Bottom tier should be bubba.

It might be your first time. If it‚Äôs downloading, the game has to finish downloading

And ruin my costume I just finished? Pfft.
---
And I agree that if some things are too sharp they can be toned down. Like breaking pallets. They need to be loud enough that a survivor can hear it reasonably well, but it doesnt need to be toned so sharply.
---
Agreed. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a science to it but sometimes it adds unnecessary stress when you team goes down back to back to back.
---
3 ways to make Chucky work.
---
Human Tiffany with Chucky- Tiffany is the main playable character while she uses Chucky for her attacks. Chucky can be riding Tiffany. Imagine Ferra Tor from Mortal Kombat.
---
Chucky and Tiffany Both as dolls- Since they are 2 characters in one, The 2 of them together can lift a survivor. Tiffany can Piggyback on Chucky's back so they can hang the survivor to the hook. 
---
Doll Chucky with Human Tiffany as AI assistant vice versa- Imagine the gameplay of Resident evil revelations 2.  Where you control one character while the other is AI that follows you around and you can switch characters between the 2 of them with a push of a button.
---
How do you imagine Necromorph taking survivor to a hook? It makes some sense with Demogorgon or Xenomorph bc they tended to take their prey to their dimension/hive without immediately killing them to do something with it (prey). But Necromorphs just kill everyone they find because that is their goal - kill and infect to create more Necromorphs.
---
Alright. So, I'm gonna place my idea for that chapter here, then maybe in a separate post.
---
Chapter name: The marker's call
---
Survivor: Isaac Clark
---
"After going through hell, deadly scenes and scenarios, countless near death experiences that only someone with a will of iron or a god on their side, could've made it out. Isaac is placed in a realm oh so new, yet oh so familiar, filled with dread and death."
---
Perks: 
---
The Stomp:
---
When cleansing a totem, you may use the action key to instead stomp on said totem. Doing so instantly destroys it, uses the perk, exhausts you for 70/60/50 seconds, and reveals your aura for 3 seconds.
---
"Grahhh! Just stay down this time!"
---
Resourceful:
---
When searching a chest with an item equipped, you may instead use that chest to fully recharge said item. Any single use items (styptic, anti-hemorrage, BNP) are not recharged.
---
"You've gotta have an eye for these kinds of things"
---
The Marker's Design:
---
You've made the arcane and simply insane markers, destroyed them, and have plenty of experiences with both death and engineering. For every other survivor in the trial, you gain a token. For each token, you gain a 2/3/4% repair speed bonus. You also gain an 2/2/2% additional progression per great skill check, reguardless of tokens. While repairing, you have the exposed status effect, and for 10/9/8 seconds after ending the repair action.
---
"I've seen these things up close and personal kid, and they ain't any prettier. Just keep your head down and finish the job"
---
Killer: The Hunter
---
"A terrifying beast, with unending rage, hunger, and bloodlust. Frozen by the scientists before they went mad, and help captive for decades. While the hunter's brethren fell before it, it persisted, frozen in anger and agony. It's cries to the markers unending and unheard. Eventually, the entity stumbled across the beast's calls, and pulled the willing creature from its frozen and painful existence. It now hunts for the entity, in search of those that dare oppose its new master"
---
Size: large (trapper)
---
Moment: 110%
---
Terror radius: 36m
---
Power: Necromorphism
---
The hunter can tap into a more feral strain, causing it's terror radius to expand greatly and give new effects. When this strain is charged, the hunter moves at 105% but can instantly down a survivor with a slightly (difference between teir 1 meyers with and without boyfriend's note) increased lunge. The hunter can also place 8 total "trapped holes". For each hole placed, the hunter can do 2 things. 1, should a survivor pass by a "hole" with the hunter in it's "feral strain" it can teleport to the survivor and hit them, causing the oblivious and hemorrhaging effect for 30 seconds. 2 The hunter can also trap certain objects, using it's holes. Vaults, pallets, and Hooks. Should a survivor use this object with a hole, they will become stuck in a web of flesh and must wiggle free. The hunter is given the survivor's aura and can grab them from this position, instantly allowing the survivor to be hooked. The hunter can also use lockers to teleport around the map. While in an unoccupied locker, the hunter can see other survivors in lockers and, should he teleport to them, can instantly hook them. (An animation plays where the locker shakes, the survivor goes to get out but is pounced on by the killer, slashed then picked up)
---
Perks:
---
Fevered hunting:
---
You refuse to dissapoint your new master. While in the chase, you gain bloodlust 10/20/30% faster, but you lose the ability to see scratch marks at bloodlust 2/2/3. 
---
No-one can hear you scream:
---
When the final generator is completed, the exit switches are blocked by the entity for 50/60/60 seconds. While they are blocked, the killer can see the aura of all survivors that completed the final generator for 20/30/30 seconds. During that time, those survivors are exposed but gain an additional 50% altruism action speed boost.
---
"In space, no-one can hear you scream, but everyone can see you bleed"
---
Devoted:
---
For every generator completed gain a token. For each token, you gain 1% additional movement speed, and do 3/3/4% more instant regression per generator kick. The generators also regress 5/7/10% faster per token.
---
"For our flesh may be taken, so our souls live on forever!"
---
Exactly, preferably not just solo stuff in terms of survival like Bill‚Äôs.
---
Just extremely unlucky. I haven't gotten BBQ on my Ghostface in two prestige cycles and to level 50 not have I gotten spirit Fury yet on any of my killers, it's just pure luck
---
It‚Äôs good right now I only run it on my nurse but it‚Äôs good for checking lockers real quick
---
Maybe just tone it down at the closer ranges, it really only hurts your ears when you‚Äôre killer.
---
I‚Äôd say ruin is the most pain in the ass while you can counter it with hitting great skill checks I‚Äôm not gonna be able to do that half the time lol and then I have to go run around the map to find it pretty annoying but I can tap it at least
---
It's just rank, anyways. It's like a horror game version of "Whose Line" where the survivors make up all the rules and the pips dont matter.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if EVERY SINGLE KILLER didn‚Äôt have it. It gets old faaast.
---
Fair point.
---
The mother of a child who lives out in the woods away from everyone &amp; helps her mom hunt wild game apparently lol
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Good stuff wow.
---
I know he‚Äôs talking about improving the killer experience but I think this is applicable at rank reset to both sides. 
---
[Mcote recommends playing civilisation instead. ](https://clips.twitch.tv/ExcitedPeppySamosaTinyFace)
---
Yeah it came out in the shrine and since everyone is kinda low rank atm everyone is using it even with inner strength it‚Äôll still be a perk that is used a lot
---
True but they do carry bodies to certain areas to create masses of flesh, so maybe that might work for it?
---
It's rather humorous that this game turned into people butt dancing and raging
---
If the killer ignores you, it just turns into a perk like empathy but you can see the killer while not chasing too with the drawback of terror radius.
---
This is great! Reminds me of AHS! It definitely emits a disturbing vibe, which means you did it right.
---
Nice.
---
Feeling* üòè
---
Addons: Scratched mirror and boyfriend's memo.
---
Perks: Monitor&amp;abuse, the most mandatory perk since it lowers your TR to zero. Other 3 are optional but i think most effective ones are ruin, because you are very slow and you need something to pressure the gens for you. Bbq because jumpscare myers is really good for bloodpoints, you will usually get 30k+ so bbq makes that a 60k+, and you can see people outside of your detection range. Sloppy butcher to slow the game down even more since you'll mostly be doing hit and run tactics, they'll waste tons of time healing themselves or they are basically one shot down since you can approach undetected. Make your choice because it has the same range as your aura reading, the moment you don't see the hooked survivor anymore you'll have the rescuer one shot down for 60 seconds while you can see his aura.
---
Skips from 4 seconds to 28 for some reason.
---
Where will be your purpose when you wouldn't rank reset?
---
Like do you realy want to play until you've every one on rank 1? And than?
---
My thoughts exactly, I wondered if it was a weird filter.
---
Doesn‚Äôt that shirt come with the original cosmetics pack? That isn‚Äôt a new player
---
If a survivor has been in the locker for a while crows will start to perch on top of the locker they are hiding in, and when 3 crows are on top they'll start clawing at you.
---
When you run up to a gen with like 3 people it does look like rats scattering.
---
If you sit in a locker for too long crowds will appear sitting on top of the locker. You could accumulate a total of 3 and at 3 the killer will gain continuous notifications of your location until you get those birds off
---
Crows will start to accumulate if you don‚Äôt move after a certain amount of time. They would eventually find you because ones you reach three crows, a visual and audio notification is given to the killer repeatedly.
---
Jeff looks like he's about to deliver the Tombstone Piledriver on someone
---
The real problem is that he‚Äôs too powerful to be trapped in the entity‚Äôs realm, he could easily obliterate the Entity and escape while only using .000000000000000000001% of his power.
---
I was left to bleed for awhile last night, and I moved alongside a pallet as I've been saved that way before. When ghost face picked me up, I couldn't see anything. Then suddenly I was by a hook, or the camera was. Ghostface was trying to hook me but I wasn't on his shoulder. I was floating a few feet behind him (as tho I were over his shoulder). He spent some time attacking me, and I began moving away in this glitched state. He tried a few more things when the last two gens popped. I started floating to the opening exit, but it was hard because the camera was stuck on ghostfaces shoulder. He disconnected.
---
It seems he could have done a lot of thing to get me killed...like just moving where I couldn't see the gateway letting me bleed out.
---
This is why I kinda preferred F13 before, but y'know...
---
Awesome cosplay. GF main approves üëç
---
I can‚Äôt say I get *that* many messages when I play killer, one in ten matches maybe? Try disabling messages from strangers if it‚Äôs getting to you.

Doc was having NONE of Meg's shit, straight up yeeted her ass out of the map.

Don't blame him tbh

Thanks!

Adding to the other responses, Legion's Killer Instinct will show a heartbeat of a survivor in a locker.
---
Thanks, now I know what to watch for as a killer!
---
Yeah, I like playing nurse and I usually have a gut feeling when the survivors gonna get rescued off the hook, so I teleport to the hook and I'm nearly never wrong. I'll hit them again and put them back on the hook then chase the person who rescued them. I now have a tendency of where if somebody calls me a camper when I'm not camping at all, If I find them in the next couple games I'll facecamp them to give them an example of what camping really is.
---
Good to know!
---
Dam this is better than my cosplays
---
I guess I had a bunch of luck because on my first 20 blood webs I already have BBQ, Franklin‚Äôs, Knock Out, And Bamboozle
---
I got a very good headseat when i walk by locker very close i can hear the survivor breathing. Also lockers are very loud if you slowly go into a locker and im not far away i can prob hear the sound too
---
Yeah, talk about kicking someone while they're down. Trash talking after a win is for losers. I imagine people who rarely win have to get as much satisfaction as possible out of it.
---
Cutie
---
Edit some flashlights in there and... whoops almost forgot the key for the hatch escape THERE WE GO
---
2 other ways for killer to know if you hopped into a locker are if you are injured they can still hear the injured noises although they are a bit muffled and they can hear the hinge of the door opening and closing, doesn't help find someone sitting in a locker all game but does help with more normal gameplay situations
---
alot of suggestions from movies and games get thrown out but i would lose my fucking shit if they got a licensed dead space deal, there are so many customization options and potential killer powers they could do. on my life i'd drop 100$ into dbd if they could get that
---
Lmao why are you getting downvoted
---
I remember seeing you in the chat I think when you asked him
---
Shaggys ultra instinct would be to powerfull
---
Agreed, it either lasts all match or 35 seconds. No in between.
---
BLOOD WARDEN TIME
---
You don't say.
---
His streams/videos have been a godsend. As a new player who came to DBD after seeing the trailer for the Stranger Things DLC, his commentary has been vital in me not being a complete and utter potato when I play killer.
---
I never dc on either side. Just stop being a pussy and play through it
---
Yeah, like, ngl if some dumbass doesn't move away within 10 seconds of being rescued they might as well shoot a flare in the sky and paint a bullseye on their forehead while waiting for you to arrive. I don't get it lol. When I'm survivor, the first thing I do when I get saved is run to the corner of the map and get healed.
---
1-3 on Killer. Probably 4-6 on survivor
---
Maybe they are inspired by seeing another David kick ass, and the torch is passed. They too go on to seek greatness.
---
if you are gonna try to send people to someones youtube channel i would advise posting a **Link** to that persons channel rather than a picture of one of their videos
---
He is amazing. I also posted on the subreddit at an insanely kind act he did for me and I just appreciate him so much
---
bruh have you been living under a rock? He complains, and trashtalks everyone in his game. People donate $10 for him to play a certain type of build, and instead of seeing the fun/combo with the build he just says it's shit and has no dead hard.
---
Permission... granted
---
As a survivor, I was stuck at level 9 and 10 and couldn't get past that.  So I guess I'm a 9 or 10.
---
Spine chill

Thanks &lt;3
---
Thank you from a trapper enthusiast
---
I'm glad to know I made someone smile with this! If I posted this to my current viewers, I'd probably get shit on &lt;3

Thank you!!!

Okay good, at least I'm not alone in that aspect lmao. Thanks!!

BRING A EBONY MORI IF THEY GET HOOKED ONCE THEN THEY FUCKED!
---
My steve cosplay was reposted by the devs!
---
Um...
---
This is INSANELY good and so close to the movie I think you could frame it as such. That's both a compliment to the Saw guy who had to suit everyone and you for doing a great cosplay. You even arted it up via lights, background when you didn't have too which is something I love. 
---
Now the real talk is whether or not you think Amanda wears a tank top or just a sports bra under the coat. Was a discussion my friends and I had forever ago.
---
What?
---
What does being Mexican have to do with it lol?
---
Exactly. Once I‚Äôm unhooked I‚Äôm out and usually trying to fend of the people healing me til I‚Äôm at a safe distance. Even then I get found sometimes, that killer must have been camping /s.
---
the game deserves it own series a season 1 would go into the backstories of the killers and survivors
---
I wast just saying 'cause the image is in spanish xd

They only should let him turn his camera while traversing through portals (QoL) so i won't get confused when I emerge from a portal + red addon is more useful
---

---
Up until this current point in time

Those angle flips will make playing him more confusing and difficult (in a bad way). I'm not against new visual, but please, don't mess with camera
---
ok but what episode is this from
---
i must know
---
Well, huntress is not weak at all so...
---
Nice job!
---
Worst one I have ever seen is when I burned an offering to start with someone, we spawn in the shack *with a gen* and their first instinct, *I shit you not* is to drop one of the best pallets in the game before working on a gen. I proceed to leave the room, see a Michael walk in through the nonpalleted entrance, grab her off the gen and hook her. It would have been comical if it wasn't so depressing.
---
Thank you :D
---
this really is the biggest and best compliment ever. thank you so so much for this, gosh it means a lot. 
---
tbh the lighting and such was just pure coincidence but im so glad it worked out
---
 And to answer your question, i personally wear a black tank top but id like to believe Amanda runs around like a true free, killer murderessüòè
---
WHY IS IT IN SPANISH???!!
---
 (Just kidding )

I think i know you from somewhere, but i just can't remember

am honored to have our almighty one speak so highly of me

Kind of means just don‚Äôt be a toxic asshole- so as survivor don‚Äôt teabag and flashlight click at every instance just because you‚Äôre looping a killer well. A survivor isn‚Äôt toxic for flashlight saving or looping for a long time, but insisted showing off about it just to be a c*nt. As a killer don‚Äôt camp/ heavily tunnel. And on either end don‚Äôt be a dick by messaging them to show off or calling them shit just because of a  fair game. don‚Äôt really think there are many cheats or exploits in the game tbf.
---
Another person giving us Spirits bad names

I don‚Äôt get it.

LMFAO

This is an amazing cosplay! What did you use for the shirt/tunic thing and the hood?
---
What do you mean? She survived for 50 years. She has a lot of experience.
---
Yes! though chat was really fast so I decided to send it in discord :)
---
17-18.  A tad bit above casual.
---
*NO THAT'S WRONG!*
---
10/10 would mistake for survivor again :). Really awesome. Love the detail in the mask ma
---
If the killer has any aura reading perks or addons they will be able to see you getting into the locker
---
This would be hilarious
---
Oh wah wah wah
---
The match that made you wish that you had equipped tenacity , if you had tenacity you could have made it before that meg head screwed you over :( .
---
The only person I‚Äôve seen who misses on purpose to get someone to run into a trap
---
it's not "Ez" but it's how Doctor works actually. Same for Trapper. You can't just play them like Clown and then crying about gen speed.
---
They are "defensive killer". You have to think your endgame as soon as the game start with these two. But you'll definitely lose at high rank if you chase for more than 15s with them.
---
I legitimately read that as ‚Äúgirlfriend main approves‚Äù and I was so confused.
---
Are you sure this is not a screenshot from the actual game ?
---
When you try to give them advices, most of the time those "baby killers" insult you.
---
mori a moried survivor using the moried survivor as  a mori for a moring a survivor

Because this cosplay is amazing
---
I just discovered him around the Stranger Things DLC coming too, his videos have extremely helped me and I'm so glad for all the helps and pointers he gives out. Blessed Ortz
---
There is still no shooting star version of this scene ?
---
Yeah, it's just not fun gameplay for both parties involved. Unfortunately it's only way to be effective with doc. It's weird that he is stronger at low rank becaus people can't juke (or just stealth only because people are blind AF) but in high ranks docs just unfun. I didn't know why there was so much hate until I played him in high rank. It's 3 gens 1 hour game...or lose
---
To bad he didn't equipped the addon that let you down survivors in one hit
---
Dunno, i dont really use reddit much. I just saw the og video going around on twitter so wanted to make an edit lol
---
I saw! You're an insane huntress! Teach me how to be like you haha

I have to grind out 600k BP tomorrow. Or today I guess. Gonna be rough but I've done worse.
---
I recommend STBFL, Brutal Stregth, maybe Enduring with Cigar Box and 15% Ether. And Ebony Mori Just because.
---
Blendette is an understandable but overused meme.  Shirtless Myers kinda came out of nowhere too.
---
haha thank you so much dude!!!
---
Oh boy, i imagine the various types of traps we'll be able to use!
---
Ruin is kinda exhausting when a Nurse or Hillbilly use it at lower ranks, I just don't even feel like trying if they get early momentum. 
---
BBQ, I just cannot blame anyone using it. It is a WGLF but the stacks are gained just by playing the game and doing your objectives, unlike survivor where he needs to go out of his way for the rescue and then hope the killer won't down the unhooked survivor otherwise no stack for you. 
---
Franklin's kinda cool, sometimes I bring addon free green key to scare the killer and when they bring that perk I feel like I mindgamed him from before the game started. 
---
Mori's are stupid in the sense that killers just deny themselves more points in favour of just having a nice kill animation. But it doesn't bother me that much, I don't see that many killers use it. 
---
Backwater Swamp, but only the ship version, the other one has pallets and structures. 
---
 ‚ÄúA player failed to load into the game‚Äù - would you rather start the game with 3 survivors? That's new...
---
Go thrifting! Who knows, maybe you might find a jacket that looks similar
---
problem is Spirit is Nurse for PPC too
---
thank you so much! 
---
uh i made the mask by sculpting the pig head out of clay then coating it with paper mache. once it hardened i took it off and had a head! i coated in several more layers to give the head strength and then painted it. 
---
hoped this helped!
---
As you rank up you will very quickly find that hiding becomes less and less effective. One reason for this is that survivors leave scratch marks when they run that are visible to the killer. There's also the fact that the survivors have to do the gens to escape, so the killer will know to look for you there. Once I understood this I committed myself to learning how to run the killer around for as long as possible in a practice known in the Dead By Daylight community as 'Looping.' This is essentially what the meta game revolves around at high level play. This isn't something anyone expects you to master right away, but I am going to link you a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QYjInzLeM) covering the basics of looping so that you can start to practice now. A lot of low rank killers will shit their pants if you know how to correctly loop the strong map tiles.  
---
Once you level up characters you can get their perks on other characters. Character have teachable versions of their perks that will appear in their bloodwebs for purchase at levels 30,35, and 40. Once purchased they can appear in other characters bloodwebs as well. I recommend getting all the teachables from Meg and Claudette unlocked first. All the exhaustion perks are good, with Dead Hard (David King) and Balanced Landing (Nea) usually being considered the strongest. Other meta perks are Borrowed Time (Bill) and Decisive Strike (Laurie). That should be something to get you started. Make sure you only run one perk that causes the exhaustion effect at a time.
---
Damn at that point just get an Xbox lol....
---
dont get the runnies
---
I'm sorry to tell you, but if any killer with either some sense or even the smallest axe to grind sees 2 tool boxes a map/flashlight and a key... It's Franklin time baby.
---
Dude, that's awesome! I'm happy that you were able to do that. Please update when he posts the video. It would be cool to maybe see a co-op video
---
time and place?
---
You know most red ranks in this game don't look for a challenge. Whatever is their platform.
---
If they can use Nurse or Spirit, with good addons and with a solid build, they will do it.
---
This is a really good cosplay, thought it was from the movie
---
Alexa, play ‚ÄúSad But True‚Äù by Metallica

You win post of the day

GG EZ baby Ghostface lmao
---
&gt; Unfortunately Ruin is necessary and always will be. 
---
That is true if you want to 4k each game against solo survivors. I've been playing a fair amount of games as Wraith on higher ranks and unless the survivors were in SWF or exceptionally good I would've hooked them all once or twice and by the time all generators were completed I either got 2 or 3 kills depending on how reckless the team is playing. I agree that Ruin makes the games much less stressful overall.
---
Yooooooo niiiiiice
---
Bruce lee against Brad Pitt flashback

What are your usual killers?

Thanks man üòÇ

Just imagine some baby Meg turning onto Trapper and pushing him back few steps
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 too same as my reddit name. Hope to see ya in the fog üòÑ
---
Sounds like you constantly phase back everytime someone is unhooked instead of pressuring survivors off gens.  Willing to wager this results in a lot of redowning and rehooking injured survivors which is where the salt is probably coming from.  A lot of killers myself included hook then leave to pressure survivors off gens and initiate a new chase.  I receive very little salt playing like this.  It sounds like a lot of your gameplay is just focusing on the last hook you did.
---
Yea because i took the time to find this post with 4 upvotes and somehow undo the red markings. Sure. I couldn‚Äôt care less if they took it down.
---
I play a lot of both and honestly playing killer stresses me out, you have to worry about four people at once and a single mistake can cost you the game
---
Well, writers not giving you all the answers you require not always equal bad writing. I for one would be dissapointed, if some mysteries of my beloved universes were revealed, just because the crowd asked for this. Mysteries are here for you to theorise and make your own peace.

Degenerates like him belong on a hook

Really I would just be happy if deadhard could work consistently. Sucks not being able to use my favorite perk anymore because it‚Äôs glitched garbage.
---
No
---
I play both about evenly nowadays, and no, survivor is a much more relaxed experience that killer. The difference between trying to babysit one hyperactive child with a knife and having to try and gather 4 swat trained mice who will blow up everything you own if you dont get them all in 5 minutes like some kind of Saw inspired torture by anxiety.
---
A real entrepeneur right there
---
They changed the survivor/ killer thing so you could do it all as one tho.
---
Weird flex but go off
---
Survivors have a chance to not get killed. So they are "powerful" !
---
Of course we aren't going to talk about the "details" like swf vs solo survivors since it's absolutely not important balance wise (/s)
---
Reminder that 4g cellular connection replaced NBN for a large amount of people in Aus. I'm stuck with it myself. Cant ever play killer and if i do I get called a lag switcher when all I want to do is do a daily.

How people are justifying farming? Cant believe There is so Many dislikes about not liking to farm. Farming is most Boring way to get BP and ruins The game experience. However this shows There is so Many beginners in this subreddit If they think farming is cool and important
---
Something that I had a problem with was your suggestion for NOED. I do agree it needs a change, but it has an important role even if you dont run it. NOED is a perk that you dont ever need to actually run because the threat of the killer having it will force survivors to do totems and buy time.
---
That being said. Getting insta-downed because someone did the gens is pretty bs so here's my suggestion. Make NOED function as a catch up perk that ramps up for every living survivor after the last gen is done. Just to throw some potential numbers. 3% move speed, 5% less successful attack cd, and 5% less missed attack cd per living survivor after the last gen until the totem is broken.
---
Those changes should hopefully let it maintain its threat while mitigating how bs it could be to deal with by giving you actual counter play while making looping more dangerous in a less artificial way.
---
It sounds kinda boring tho, and thrill of the hunt already does the same but more dynamically
---
"Out of the womb, into the Tomb."
---
Had a match where I juked GF for about 5 minutes using very few pallets and mostly windows. No gens were done because of ruin and after getting downed finally I was face camped all 3 stages and no one even tried to help, they just stood there or hid in lockers. Now I'm a killer main
---
not everyone can spend 12 hours a day playing games
---
Ah, yes. Make a meme-reply about a perk you don't even use (Balanced Landing FTW) and get flamed for it.
---
I feel like something in Scott Junds (damnnohtml) video should be implemented. He recommended gens take 100 seconds each and hook states last 1 minute 30 seconds. Thatd give more time for both sides.
---
Well it's true in the sense that it's for the weaker killers in the game, better killers like Nurse and Spirit can be viable without ruin. But yeah, people will give any reason to criticise their opponents on this game, 90% of the time they're just grasping for something other than themselves to blame for losing.
---
Both are good. (Not counting in a bunch of trash tier killers)
---
XD nice
---
All good points but I‚Äôve had quite a few games not load after waiting in queue for 10+ minutes. I guess there‚Äôs nothing they can do about that but still, it would be nice to have a regular game every now and then.
---
For killer mains it's about challenging yourself and pulling off the stunt of catching those fucking mice. Its stressful as hell sometimes but the stress is what makes the payoff.
---
Haha yep
---
Sorry mah dude, still new to the meme life B-)
---
Drink it.
---
Plague is already a strong killer. You either have permanently injured survivors or you have super vomit which means you can end each chase in about 10 seconds.
---
You really did that on paint ? That's impressive.
---
some survivors are just dummy dums
---
I don‚Äôt want a scary game.
---
I want a competitive game.
---
I live for the chase as a killer and as a survivor. If they weren‚Äôt able to use skill to avoid getting downed and basically died the second I found them each time, I would have dropped this game long ago.

I agree weaker killers need it. I can be rank 5 and if I'm running trapper, I need to run ruin or I will lose and I'm not a bad killer. But facts the straws grasped by opposing side would kill many turtles.

Big dummy dums. Killers can be dummy dums too. Equal dummy dums

Whispers works with monitor well otherwise there s no point of using it
---
It's not. It has no meaning in the story of part 5
---
ooooooooooooh boy, does THIS look familiar XD
---
Perhaps not to this extent but... when I tuned in to spectate after being killed my corpse was flying across the map XD
---
It‚Äôs actually just the Steve that‚Äôs not a drawing. I used his real image, the other characters are drawing. But maybe because of the filters that I used it looks like that haha

Good Cosplay - A Fellow GF Main
---
I just don't really like it as is, and it's *too* frequent. Monthly? Too much
---
Where the hell are THOSE teams at? I got NOTHING but 3-4 man SWF yesterday... every... damn... match.
---
The situation I see whispers being useful for gen protection in is when survivors are near gens, but with surveillance I basically already know they‚Äôre in the area so it‚Äôs not too useful, at least to me
---
I like that Nea is disgusted by the thought of being nice
---
You want to drop the chase if it lasts more than 20 seconds or if the guy runs into the 4x4 house and you have the option to patrol the generators. You can't really stop the first 2 generators unless you run into multiple survivors or you use Discordance/Ruin. Takes 44 seconds to complete a generator when you are doing it with someone else so yea, it's pretty stupid and there is nothing obvious you are missing, you just have to take down people quicker
---
Wouldn't you be a Legion of Legions?
---
Very cool! Keep it up!
---
Yesterday I was playing Billy against a 4man swf. I lost so much time trying to chainsaw someone and 1st gen went fast as f*. Then this guys noticed I wasn't good enough for them and stoped doing gens and started jumping over and over again through windows and than hide. Eventually I found them and the chainsaws started working out. Result: 2 DC's + 2 K and the masked Meg complaining I wasn't a good killer LOL
---
since killer is something you do alone id consider myself rank 5 but nothing higher than that, ive been 3 but that was more dumbluck and trappers basement
---
for survivor tho im most definetly a 10 or below, I have no clue how to loop significantly well and ive only been able to get rank 4 because of borrowed time empathy trying my best to heal teammates and get altruistic scores.
---
Had this exact thing happen last night. We figured out that a dude playing legion was brand new so we basically tanked our game letting him down us and stuff so he could rack up points. Well that is until he face camped my friend after he let him hook him and started hitting him while on the hook. We then just finished and escaped. We told hi. We were going to let you hook us all but he ruined it by face camping and acting like a dick. He did say sorry which was cool.
---
What about Overcharge? Even if survivors can hit the skill check, it stops them from being able to tap the gen to stop the regression. When survivors figure out I have surveillance, they tend to just tap it and leave to make me think they‚Äôre there, so overcharge could prevent that
---
You literally can't do anything against that because you can't hear her phase in the heartbeat though
---
This sub defends camping, its no surprise
---
Don't forget [not Otzdarva](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDO__Z-tZD4bfG9m4AkK_uA)...
---
Since I main Survivor, gens get finished a lot, I like to have some insurance.
---
Ehh, I think this sub is balanced in terms of people being extremely killer or survivor sided
---
So your conclusion is "I run towards the killer" - Well that did answers in to things.
---
I hope it returns just for the bloodpoints alone. If you played an offering as survivor, every plant that got cleansed on the map by any survivor would  grant you 4500 bloodpoints. I was racking it in playing an offering every match!
---
I think he's trolling lol
---
Well that's the thing. I was never in chase's. I just never saw anyone.
---
I'm not saying run towards the killer, but you also can't run away because she might be phasing
---
So the chapter will drop in 1.5 hours? :D
---
OOOOOHH YEEEEE
---
I mean typically most survivors keep running but sometimes you can make that play to juke since running in the same direction hurt spirit can still hear cries and has collision theres not much you can do especially without iron will its always a 50/50 with spirit depending on how Good she is and how expensive her headphones are lol
---
Yeah man, while we're at it, we might as well buff the nurse, spirit, AND hillbilly!
---
Search the trappdor
---
This is so terribly sweet: I'd let him teabag and hook me, I need to show some respect and ease his pain!
---
But... I love anime though :'(
---
If you don't own the clown, then you can't get the daily's, easy peasy
---
You sound like a easy kill - Nice.
---
This made me chuckle, thanks
---
Im using this against my friends now. This is perfect.
---
Try to play with the Wraith or Doctor and get used to their spawns/positions, its just practice
---
Only letters that matter
---
Yeah I do. I usually never have any trouble with wraith, although with doc I tend to get too focused on shocking people.
---
Depending on the spirits perks and skill if you are injured yes you get fucked up in the ass. You don't even need expensive headphones to hear survivors. Escaping killer depends on the survivor skill and perks, it is not impossible though and of course Iron Will "helps"
---
This is perfect, i don't like the pig, but damn this cosplay is great
---
oh, ok. thank you!
---
Here I am

If we're not careful Otz's Cult of Personality will take over the subreddit.
---
...let's not be careful.
---
Ok ill describe it too u. When the legion spawns they either is joe,frank,suise,or julie. Cosmetics just appear on the group. All of them have different abilities like frank has a cannibal style instadown and frank keeps a similar style feral frenzy. Some of them are completely new though like Julie‚Äôs rc drone and susie ability to look just like any survivor.  They all fit a playstyle and you can swap out there abilities with add ons there mori is also them as a group.
---
pig doesn't lose stbfl stacks with her dash and that's also how demogorgon's dash is going to work.
---
Maybe an nsfw woulda been useful
---
There's a wraith add on that allows him to see auras at 12 meters, and the locker wont hide you.
---
Yeah really
---
Normal lag would happen casually at the end of the game when she didnt lag the whole game. And I heard her get close to me if you cant hear her as well
---
They‚Äôre update system is just wrong, it should make you update the game in game and not from the App Store / play store
---
Lag switchers can be easily made, I've had a game where a huntress for gen rushed and suddenly she was walking just fine but we couldnt escape from her  like we were stuck in place while she was casually drowning all of us.
---
Yeah you do really cool :D
---
Is there a way to tell if it's regular lag or lag switching?
---
Based
---
We need this.
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong.
---
But seriously, that addon would be insanely overpowered.
---
Yep,
---
Console players will usually connect to the internet over wifi while pc players usually connect via a cable. In my 6 years in console gaming I've only met a handfull of players that used cables of Wi-Fi
---
And killer cant FIND addons, and survivor items arent essential to successful play.
---
The colours remind me of Pokemon mystery dungeons quiz at the start of the game and I love it
---
And that's the truth. The game does not allow a solo team of good survivor to be near the level of a coordinated swf team. Still Killers would like to win against those commando team at the cost of the great majority of the other playerbase : the solo players. 
---
The worst is that there are already builds and killers able to constantly win against high ranked premade. That shouldn't have happend.
---
I have a question, which is not related to the thread, but i don't know where else to ask: 
---
I saw a survivor yesterday with Feng Min's chinese dress, but her hair is blonde. I checked other female survivors' outfits but only Feng Min has that chinese dress. Did that dress for blonde survivor (maybe Kate) exclusive?
---
The pose and lighting make this so much better. Nice work
---
I was gonna get it but then when i re installed the game and 11 out of the 12 survivors i played agaisnt Disconnected and it reminded me where the developers priorities stand
---
Maybe, but there are still more bad spots so you'll most likely get those instead of the good ones
---
I see you got beaten by the Nintendo switch brothers
---
Because you've got to buy that fun?
---
Slugging is a good pressure strategy, but it's not always as simple as leaving someone on the ground if another survivor is within 32m of you. Only Nurse and to a lesser extent Billly and Spirit can really consistently go out of their way to slug that hard. The less mobile killers regularly lose time that way, and have to be more mindful about when to slug, lest the chase that led to that first down is nullified by the survivor revealed with Infectious Fright running away in advance, you first having to catch up to them, and them then leading you on a chase during which the survivor you first downed is healed up again - if you had hooked them instead, you would have spent a little more time picking them up and carrying them to a hook of course, but another survivor would have had to come and save them either way, and now you would have hook progress on them.
---
That's why I think hard slugging for the less mobile killers - i. e. where you slug with strategy and not just opportunity - relies on Knock Out (and/or Third Seal). Low-mobility killers have low innate snowball potential, and in order to more consistently get actual pressure out of slugging, they need to make it worth their while. Where high-mobility killers will even want for other survivors to pressure their slugs, since they can snowball off of that, the low-mobility killers want to use slugging mostly as a means of saving more of their own time (not having to go through the hooking loop, getting into the next chase as quickly as possible) and wasting more of their opponents' (survivors being on the ground longer than they would be on a hook, survivors having to search for them longer than it would take them to run to the hook, or having to heal the slugs up first). Knock Out/Third Seal make it so that not only does it take other survivors longer to find a slugged survivor, wasting more of their time than hooking them would have both by keeping other survivors on the search and the slugged survivor on the floor, but with people not finding slugs, the less mobile killers can actually more often manage to escalate the game that way, keeping people on the ground for long enough to build pressure on the other survivors, snowballing off of it.
---
Among the less mobile killers there are of course still differences in snowball potential, such as killers with instant-down abilities or Legion and Plague, who will usually have people injured and therefore quasi-instant-down abilities. And then Legion has some increased mobility and Plague has Corrupt Purge. Legion can also make good use of Third Seal, since they can spread the effect quickly. Plague can find slugged survivors a little more easily herself, due to the diseased VFX. So I like to slug with them.
---
My recommendation is to pair Infectious Fright with Knock Out, hooking survivors if nothing shows up on Fright, otherwise slugging. The other two slots are then chase perks like Brutal/Boozle or Enduring/Fury, or Barbecue/Ruin/NOED, or perks that assist the slugging strategy, like Monitor &amp; Abuse, Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Sloppy Butcher... Monitor + Nurse's is a particularly nice pair-up for Fright, since Monitor increases your terror radius in chase, increasing Fright's range in turn, while Nurse's can help you both control slugs and snowball off of them, and also has obvious synergy with Nurse's. On Nurse, Fright + Monitor and Nurse's + 1 (Barbecue/Whispers/Shadowborn/Butcher/Ruin/Knock Out/Deerstalker...) is an optimal build, but for other killers, two slots is really not much, especially since non-Nurse/Billy/Spirit killers usually want to spend two slots on chase perks to begin with. So it's tough. But it is fun and pretty viable, if you are a competent killer to begin with.
---
Yeah just fuck over everyone who has been buying the dlcs just for new players who don‚Äôt want to pay it all.

Don‚Äôt wait till last minute to leave. Dropping off the edge will land you somewhere in the actual map, either search for the hatch or except your untimely death.

But it says i get points for not being found and thats kinda bullshit. Plus he wouldnt have chased me he was after a Jake the whole game
---
This is just amazing man, you're finally noticed as an amazing huntress :)
---
Dont u understand what an opinion is? Pls dont.
---
I dealt with a well strategized group that played a "little" bit toxic...
---
None survived
---
Its not just DC-ing that ruined it for me, it did however remind me of a time where bugs wouldn't be fixed for months on end all while numerous cosmetics and DLC got added to the game.
---
Dc-ing and the lack of punishment for it reminded me that the developers have had almost a year to implement functioning dedicated servers to their game so that not only does this issue go away but also, so that both killers and survivors can also have a fun time playing without having to worry if one or the other is gonna ruin their expereince with lag.

But theres also a fine line between "intentionally leaving little holes for the audience to fill with imagination" and "not knowing what the fuck we're doing so we'll leave this HUGE GAPING NONSENSICAL PLOT HOLES to the audience's imagination".
---
I know what you're talking about, and this ain't it chief.
---
Hate to be that guy that responds to a wall of text with like three sentences, but yeah. I when I talk about slugging, I am assuming the killer has some common sense and knows what chases to go for and what not to. As for using knockout, I don't  think it's  necessary as forcing survivors to pick up a slug still makes map pressure, knock out just help you keep it for longer if survivors aren't on comms.
---
I run Infectious on Legion all the time and that works well against non-opitmal survivors (obviously against optimal survivors there are not a whole of perks that are going to help you).
---
But I like to watch survivors scramble for a pallet just to end up getting stuck on a tree
---
ah yes the good ol stand and stare
---
Yeah....usually the killer sees you on the other side of the messed up gate. They're not letting you leave...
---
I DID have one happen last night, I was downed and he let me leave. Except I couldnt. So I crawled off the edge, and fell onto and then INTO the basement. Where I was hooked finally.
---
Apparently so.
---
As someone who paid 30 for the game on PS4 and bought every DLC thus far, plus spent tons in the In Game Store for cosmetics I see no big deal or how it would be fucking me over if tomorrow BHVR announces a new special edition that includes at least all or a majority of the original killers in its base price.
---
Look at them, it's a person who doesn't need bloodpoints!
---
Give that at rank 1 making ppl actually work for it bc that is a problem in like overwatch where they give you a reward for not wanting to get better
---
I must be still a beginner after two years playing because I honestly don't mind easy bloodpoints that also get my item saved
---
Also a reason I wish the survivors (and Freddy) could talk. I'd love to hear people recognizing Michael vs the people who've never heard of him.
---
The closer you are, the higher the points - if you're miles away from the killer all match you won't pip, you need near misses
---
You know i agreed with right?
---
Its the only game of its type thats had assistance from a big publisher, wasn't destoryed by a law suit or restricted to the graphics and gameplay of a mobile game.

---
*Mhm yes, because BHVR totally has control over people‚Äôs will*
---
Dude I love Digiorno!
---
Being stealthy isn't exactly not being found.
---
You get the points for being stealthy if you are in the terrorradius of the killer but without being in a chase.
---
You won't get the emblem for sneaking around in the corner of the map
---
Plague is already strong..
---
Well the boomer is basically the plague and the spitter is similar to the clown with making a give area hazards but I would love to see a smoker or jockey type or make it like left for dead multiplayer where you can be different special infected in one game so there could be a mecanich were you can change infected
---
Wraith can earn PWYF stacks extremely fast and basically zoom around the map destroying everyone.
---
Oh I know, I'm a huge horror fan. Problem is DbD has too many mysteries, big and small, that are just obviously made from incompetence and not intentional and have nothing to do with horror itself. Just a swiss cheese story all around.
---
And BHVR knows it too, otherwise we wouldn't be getting the new archives.
---
We're Legionnaires.
---
But i was near the killer cause i had to get tokens for stake out
---
Imagine needing to lag switch on one of the most powerful killers though LOL
---
&gt;Make him a 2 in one character, Human Tiffany will do all the lifting and hooking for him. They can function like Ferra torr from Mortal Kombat.
---
Am wraith main, can confirm

Iirc BHVR said they were working on something like this.

Leave the fountains until close to a location where a survivor is, by that point prob have a few hurt anyway and can clean house the only way puky girl can.

---
And then it'll be "Nurse every single game"...
---
Couldn't see skill checks when they popped up
---
Are you trolling? Survivors were ridiculous on launch, I can't believe you think otherwise.
---
On launch:
---
\- There was no bloodlust
---
\- Windows did not get blocked for survivors, ever
---
\- Every tile had two pallets. 
---
\- Windows in structures were never sealed off dynamically. 
---
\- Self care took about 10 seconds.
---
\- Brand new parts instantly completed gens on use
---
\- There were no medium vaults, only fast vaults, from any angle.
---
\- Survivors had pallet vacuum
---
\- Ruin did not exist
---
Survivors were so broken. The only reason survivors weren't winning every game without ever getting hooked is because they didn't understand how to run loops and manage time as well as they do now. If people with today's knowledge went back to release 1.0 killer would lose every game without a hook.
---
The only thing killers had going for them was that NOED lasted forever and SWF didn't exist.
---
Harry Warden from my bloody valentine would be awesome as a killer plus since the new chapter is killer only (I believe) I'm hoping its what I think it is
---
yes. But it's not something forced by logic. You play to win, you're ranked regarding your skill level, the more people play the more the matchmaking become fair.
---
Adding a reward would be cool and all but it may  lead to bullshit like more swf to help bad players getting the rank 1 reward for exemple. Which is counterproductive.
---
You want people to be at the rank they deserve to be instead of absolutely trying to rank up for a reward.
---
&gt;  I get happy when I hear Billy's chainsaw and see no Ruin skillcheck
---
I don't mind seeing Ruin against Billy, because he can be looped. What gets me is when I see a Nurse running Ruin. How sadistic can you be? I can count the amount of Rank 1 escapes I've seen against Nurse on my elbow.
---
Spirt is the grudge
---
If they ever put a new killer to a community vote you have my vote.
---
When David tackles the killer, there‚Äôs a 50% it will instantly mori the killer on the spot.
---
Hahaha. What, teams of Chad's standing in a circle with a baseball bat just taunting Jason to come at them?
---
Certainly was enjoyable for everyone but Jason on that game.
---
Yeah, but I haven't played in quite some time. Long story but in essence this game was creating more stress than it was relieving in my downtime.
---
Run in front of the killer and force a hit. At least that‚Äôs what I would‚Äôve done. I need some sweet chase points.
---
Yeah. But iron maiden is pretty bad so I don't need to worry.
---
Clown can only win consistently at high ranks running a pallet shredder build and playing defensively (note: defensively is covering a third to half of the map, not camping).
---
I got and stayed in r1 and my favourite build was:
---
Hex: Ruin (slow killer needs time to set up)
---
SBTFL (once charged up it's a beast to keep survs in your area, not giving them a chance to escape far)
---
Brutal Strength (shreds pallets and gives survs less time to run, paired with a bottle)
---
Bamboozle (infinites will only have 1 use, pallets there will be dropped super fast)
---
I stood still out in the open and he even looked at me
---
See that means you're not crazy like Amanda as going freebie like that would probably make the whole thing more difficult.
---
Still, I'm glad it worked out.  Keep on going with other cosplays and / or doing the same one in different ways.  You got a knack for it.

Something something he wouldn't make sense something something we already have a clown something something what would his name be something something no weapon something something how would you design his power. 
---
It's pretty stupid the arguments against adding Pennywise
---
I've been using a lot of Fright myself, including on Legion, and when I go without Knock Out/Third Seal on non-Nurse/Billy killers, I've found slugging is really not potent enough to justify spending a slot on Fright, for the reasons I mentioned. Besides, I know when it is opportune to slug, I don't need Fright for that, and so I only deem it worth a slot if I'm going to be slugging consistently, aggressively and proactively, rather than merely opportunistically.
---
That's not to say Fright without them is bad, not at all, and it can totally work out for you, especially of course as you say against the less experienced/coordinated survivors, but yeah, if I'm using Fright myself, I will add them to make it more consistently worth my slots.
---
Okay..? Congratulations? A person responded to a message you said in a twitch stream.
---
She was trying to clean all that jam off the Demogorgon's snoot.
---
It's a very insignificant amount when compared to a chase. In short, get chased, maybe pull the killer away from Jake?
---
I wouldn't classify Ash as an ultra badass without a weapon, as seen in the show and movies, when Ash has no weapon to use he'll just run away from everything. Bill however would kick some ass regardless.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs hard to play killer with a boner.
---
It really has to do with how good your teammates are.
---
As a killer, going against high ranked survivors can be really really frustrating. Survivors who work together can be amazingly quick with everything. Basically rendering the killer useless!
---
But as a survivor going against a good killer with not so skilled teammates, then yes. It‚Äôll be really hard as the survivor
---
I tried
---
I just want bloodpoints for my rank tbh
---
I disagree with ur conclusion but ur premise carries some weight. 
---
Surviviors get away with less for mistakes at lower ranks but often times can control the flow at higher ranks. 
---
Conversely low rank killer is probably the easiest time ever since low rank Survivior mistakes are worse than low rank killer mistakes but when you get to high ranks you meet Surviviors who know what they're doing.
---
I dont want to assume your rank or anything, but once you get into red ranks, it turns into a race against time and, unless your spirit/nurse, you are not in control of how the game ends. You live or die based on the survivors play and your successes come from mistakes you either react to or force from survivors.
---
Damn, you did it way better than I could.
---
Thank you for doing the man justice!
---
Yeah pretty much it, hook survivors or harvest plants as survivor to S   U   C   C the nectar to fill those vials for earning that sweet sweet halloween cosmetic (Trapper Halloween cosmetic best cosmetic btw)

When the spirit phases, it shows where she was when she started phasing, and gives no indication that she phased other than standing still
---
Yeah you are rank 6 in your dreams probably, everyone at red ranks knows how stupid spirit is. There is no guessing game in a chase, if you ran in a weird direction she can see your scatchmarks or the grass and you can't walk because she would hear you(even with iron will). Same thing happens with Nurse, 0 counterplay other than hiding the whole game.

I don't want to seem like I'm having a go at you. But I'm so used to the internet's crappy mentality of "Everything NEEDS TO BE PERFECT ON THE FIRST TRY". Its getting a little dull and it really hurts those who want to just make people laugh.
---
Agreed, survivors shouldn‚Äôt be able to bodyblock other survivors either.
---
Poor you, still new to the game
---
Smells like.. rank reset shenanigans.
---
Holy fucking shit yes
---
there isn't even any ranked mode in which only solo are allowed. So what you say doesn't make sense. If you grant people a reward for ranking up they will do all they can to avoid the difficulties.
---
I love how the nea's just like "that's not true you goddamn bafoons, maybe if you were better you'd understand"
---
Yeah I was gonna say. I like playing survivor but it‚Äôs legit a 5-15 minute wait time per game. So when a killer dc at all its a pretty big waste of everyone‚Äôs time.
---
when is it going to be out?

I believe it‚Äôs candle head cosmetic and that the survivor extinguished the flame by dropping pallets on the wraith

---
Dropping the price of a product after three years isn‚Äôt fucking people over by any definition.
---
&gt;You know she can only see your scratch marks with a red add-on right?
---
Wrong. 
---
&gt;Nurse has counter play too, it‚Äôs literally all prediction and running commons.
---
No it's not. You can't run Nurse around any common loops. I should know. I've tried it and failed and taken advantage of Surviviors trying it. 
---
&gt;Mind game them to the next dimension it‚Äôs how I win against pretty much every nurse and spirit
---
Nurse is a mindgame bc you know when she's charging her blink and you know she's blinking. You can see her coming. With Spirit it is a guessing game in the chase. You don't know when she's phasing unless it's obvious. Which against any Spirit with 2 brain cells it isn't obvious. If you knew she was phasing in her TR, then she'd be a mindgame bc you'd know "ok she's phasing which direction do I need to try and juke her". Instead it's "ok she's holding still maybe it maybe not she's phasing."
---
Not to mention most high rank Spirits run anal beads which is the most overpowered Purple add-on ever. 
---
&gt;But calling people rank 13 doesn‚Äôt make you sound anymore skilled then the rank itself.
---
I'm like a rank 5 Survivior and a rank 6 killer. Spirit is definitely beneath Billy as far as how OP killers can get, but that's not to say she isn't too strong.
---
I was expecting you to tell me to play minecraft, eh
---
These glitches are damn annoying. Yesterday I had to let the killer sacrifice me because the name of the level was still on-screen and I couldn't see any skill checks or survivor status icons, so I was worthless.
---
Ohhhhhh my mistake I thought it was with the scratch marks not blood my mistake I got it backwards
---
Just eat the hook
---
I get the feeling you are quite new to the game. If the Jake gets hooked, run over and unhook him take a hit. There is literally always something you can do to get the attention of the killer, unless he was camping the hook
---
Borrowed time, ds, body blocking, insta heals, dead hard, adrenaline, sprint burst. You can use all these right off the hook.
---
The Cowards merely fear the truth
---
Dont get stressed about it, a lot of times ill get saved from a hook while the killer is watching us and I cant really blame him for going after me.
---
Well if that is on your level sure go for it.
---
Why do you argue about balancing if you don't even know how killers work? It really triggered you when i said you were rank 13, must be true lmao
---
Congratulations u/Bluehawk1224 
---
I will be in contact shortly to make sure you get your prize! Thank you to everyone who had participated in the giveaway!
---
"Nerf her to the ground" boi your toxicity is showing
---
I‚Äôm getting flashbacks to the December console ‚Äúpass‚Äù
---
In this particular situation, if you just slugged the unhooked guy you wouldn't have got the hate mail. It's part his fault for not evading fast enough but they understand that you knew where they were after getting unhooked.
---
Alright the nurse thing I get a lot of people have issues with that including me, the red add on stuff I got backwards, and I said before that it was a guessing game because every spirit runs the god damn beads. Why do I feel like I luck out whenever I‚Äôm in matches then I really don‚Äôt have this much of an issue with spirit like others do.
---
10/10; would let you mori me
---
Cease your broke speak the most expensive dlc is 11 dollars smh
---
What's ur perk build when you play Survivior?
---
Why is this so true? Killer is so stressful, and that's with me 4king as nurse. As survivor, it's like there's nothing to lose. The only time I'm stressed is if I'm trying to do some late game stuff.
---
Now i feel like your just messing with me. No one got hooked all game the jake ran him around all game. There was literally nothing i could do
---
Cool your jets man. I think he was just saying if killers cant use collision to secure downs, it seems hypocritical for survivors to use fat shame spots and hook blocking when they are the same premise. If they healed before going into the basement, worst case scenario they get slapped and can go right by him. This looks more like a greedy play getting punished than someone being toxic.
---
I don‚Äôt get it. I am truly and honestly satisfied by everything I‚Äôve just read and I dare say excited for some answers. 
---
The only things I don‚Äôt understand are about Benedict and Vigo, but as I said I didn‚Äôt read the lore myself very much.
---
There are some things they say without saying them - I can see why you call it a dodge - because they can‚Äôt outright tell them or, I‚Äôm going to repeat myself, the magic dies. 
---
Where‚Äôs the incompetence? I mean I see a lot of mystery and maybe some intended holes (like what‚Äôs the entity, that‚Äôs a very dumb question and no smart writer would answer), but I don‚Äôt see contradictions or paradoxes.
---
BL, Bond, Prove thyself, and spine chill it works pretty well it‚Äôs not the meta but it works.
---
Tbf that was over a year ago. Do you have anything more recent?
---
This is what you see after eating a bowl of Sawyer recipe chilli
---
Are you friend with the guy that thinks Spirit needs a red add-on to see scratchmarks? lol, bye
---
While discussing the lore of this game and its critcism, many people pointed out how leaving certain things mysterious is what makes them interesting. I would have to agree with that when it comes to the entity. Not everything else they've left up to us to fill in for them, though.
---
But if they did end up explaining it I would be curious on how they'd go about it.
---
The shade yall
---
BL,Bond,Prove thyself, spine chill it works well and consistently for me I think, it ain‚Äôt meta but it works.
---
What constitutes a blendette in regards to this perk? Would it be all Claudettes with Urban Evasion, all Claudettes with (insert certain cosmetics), or all Claudettes who haven't been chased in x amount of time ;) ? 
---
I'm asking the hard hitting questions here
---
Yo you are too active, I posted the pic earlier and then the second I upload the meme your right there dude aha
---
Demogorgon is gonna starve in this game, unfortunately. Unless he eats survivors whole.
---
*sad demogorgon noises*
---
&gt;spine chill
---
That's why. That perk is the last bastion against a good Spirit and If you know how to use that information you can juke phasing Spirits.
---
There is no notification.
---
It's mostly yellow rank survivors saying dumb shit. When they get roasted by killers and high rank survivors they default to "WOW all these killers of course they disagree." It's the kind of people who said freddy should be nerfed, and complained about ghost face in the ptb. It's really easy to be better than these guys, killer or survivor, you just need to play the game more and get better.
---
TaCtICAl ADVaNTaGE

**What have you done?**
---
Yeah, like I kind of want to know how this magic being can lift my into the air or pop out of the ground and stab my and crack my neck like... It just looks like spoiled crab legs... How does bad food kill me?
---
Pretty much this. I got called out for camping when I was chasing a survivor who wouldn't leave the area the dude was hooked in.
---
Do you play on console?
---
People might run it alongside Inner Strength.
---
It is kind of clear that you know way less than the person you are answering to. Keep digging looks good deep hole you have there.
---
I get what your saying man. I'm just trying to get across why killer can be so taxing for people. Especially since the killer population is outnumbered. So if we dont want to get drowned out by people telling us *its not that bad anyone can do that* we need to make our case well whenever we get the chance.
---
How does it change the fact of unhooking in front of the killer?
---
I have no idea who you are talking about.. you are just screaming left and right. More cheese for that whine? I mean it is clear you need more cheese for that whine.
---
I agree, Jason gets absolutely fucking destroyed by a group of people who communicate on discord. Especially because he is so slow and no matter how much you try to swing at them if they have even an inch of stamina they can sprint away. 
---
Don't even talk to me about the special character, way too overpowered.
---
Pc and console, pc is the harder end but I manage to get around at rank 7-6ish on pc and 5-4ish on console
---
i only use cox comb clapper (to clap that ass silently) and the ghost soot( to pull dat ass of dat gen silently)
---
You are making it depressing now, come on boi
---
I yearn to be that innocent once again
---
Asking for preferential treatment because you don‚Äôt want to pay full price is.
---
The point was more that you wont have them all the time, so if you want to make your next match a bit more fun, go for it. It's not like you get to play like that every game, bad luck for whoever your up agaimst.

Hasn‚Äôt this entire thread went away from the actual point? Like seriously it went from debating on spirit balancing to people attacking each other.
---
**NEKUKO!**
---
Your terror radius when you crouch doesn't vanish, it shrinks till it disappears. Monitor means, if combined with Surveillance, that you can hear a gen, crouch, and make it there without being heard if you play your range right.

I would replace make your choice with overcharge, and also run ruin. It‚Äôd be fun watching survivors scatter in order to progress the game
---
if i play shit killers i get gg ezs. if i play nurse or billy people are plain pissed which i enjoy much more, too bad they will both probably get nerfed....
---
stop stalking me :D
---
You can still hit Overcharge while not on the gen. Get a good enough team and it's a dead perk slot unless your running an Impossible Skill Checks build.
---
Why isn‚Äôt his forehead 10 feet tall? I thought he was the big-brain Trapper.
---
*thankful oink*
---
Every single hit he says thats a lotta damage
---
"lets buff one of the best and most used perks in the game"
---
Yup, I know the feeling...
---
Dude I‚Äôm down for a scary chomp as his weapon.
---
Whats going on tm?
---
More wierd when they have calm spirit and iron will, it's like ***they enjoy getting hit.***
---
There's a difference between "my teammates are mentally challenged and try to unhook me as soon as the killer is turned around" and "bubba is trying to win a staring contest with me while I'm on the hook," though. I'm never going to be mad at a killer for the former. The latter pisses me off to no end.
---
It gets even better when you realize how many celebs have become famous for releasing nudes on their own.
---
well there are four times as many toxic survivors as killers :P
---
basemant is made to be a hard unhook stop cring and heal befor going
---
I personally am a big fan of Enduring/ Brutal Strength since pig struggles with loops a lot and getting rid of the pallets fast is really nice. Other than that i usually run whispers/ M&amp;A or i replace Enduring with Ruin to slow the game down just a little bit lol
---
Fuck dailies
---
Make Your Choice, Pop Goes The Weasel, BBQ and Chili and Save the Best for Last

*Sad wheeze*
---
It has to launch concurrently to avoid compatibility issues.
---
It's more of a rework than anything.
---
You can also hear her footsteps when she's phasing (they are much louder in lery or the game) , but doubt survivors pay attention for those.
---
[The release of Chapter 13: Stranger Things.](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1171835134921908225)
---
Neither can I. I can finally play Nurse optimally, so I am ready for just about anything.
---
"camping fuckin' tunneler gg noob killer"
---
"I mean, sure, okay, but next time, don't be a complete walnut that thinks I won't kill you if you're unhooked directly in front of me."
---
1. Do what you want to do. Play what way you want to play.
---
2. Giving a fuck is like giving a piece of your life so don't give them one.
---
3. You seem offended by the survivors messaging you, don't be, it's not worth it.
---
On my third day of nurse i started frequently pipping and on the 4th day i hit red ranks for the first time, her skill ceiling is overhyped imo
---
I now need a comic or something where she thinks the demogorgon is a big dog or something  and is trying to look after it
---
Cosplay looks badass! How'd you get each piece?
---
Some of them don't get the game fully yet, so they get frustrated. Gotta be patient with them! An annoyed baby Trapper might one day evolve into tryhard Nurse...
---
And if you look to your left, you'll see one of the many mindsets that make the game less fun for everyone who plays it.
---
Noooo. Noooo. What happened?
---
That's when you run both Iron Will and No Mither.
---
Sometimes I like to imagine fiction for games where the bad guys aren't actually bad, Like Wreck-It-Ralph, so the killers socialize with the survivors when the game is turned off.
---
There's like, a handful of survivors that get drunk with the Clown because despite his backstory he's actually a pretty chill guy.
---
The Nurse is... a double edged blade, I guess would be a decent analogy, at least in my mind. Where she acts bad and intentionally misses attacks for survivors that are new to the game, but can, and will, destroy the more skilled survivors, no contest.
---
All the licensed killers do act the same way everyone expects them to (albeit with less murderous intents) so Michael Myers is agreeably spooky while Leatherface wants nobody to know he's actually a cannibal. (Everyone knows, but they pretend not to know. Nobody actually eats the chili except the Huntress who really couldn't care less because "meat is meat") and Ghostface thinks taking selfies with everyone is a great pastime, his end goal is he wants to get everyone in one massive selfie, but every attempt so far usually ends up leaving some people out due to camera space or uncooperative participants.
---
The Entity does communicate with the survivors and killers both, and acts like one of those stereotypical office bosses who needs you to do something and it always sounds dead inside. Not actually having a voice in game, it just mimics one of the survivors or killers each time. Some people are mildly annoyed at being mimicked, others don't care, and some actually enjoy the impersonation.
---
Overall they are good friends at best and tolerate each other at worst, though some get mad when that last match didn't go *quite* how they hoped.
---
Oh, and the Demogorgon is literally just a monster so the killers treat it like the family dog. They are trying to train it so that it can differentiate when to attack survivors and when not to so that it can be around during the downtime between matches.
---
The only killer with activatable voicelines. You hit him with a pallet and he just lowly says ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have done that‚Äù and breaks into a run at 110% speed.
---
It doesn't allow them to outright kill survivors because the Entity feeds off hope, if they got outright killed there is no hope to feed off.
---
Ruin, Bbq, Enduring and PGTW
---
Fucking bullshit, that is what your suggested nerf would be
---
- lunge was hella long and broken
---
- infinite noed
---
- pallets weren't as safe ( Adjusted pallet stun to apply at the beginning of the pallet drop instead of the end )
---
- there was no ds, borrowed time or on demand evasive sprint burst
---
- dying state recovery took twice as long
---
- really good addons ( stacking effects of double begrimed chains which lasted entire game )
---
- shadowborn was basically meta and made it way easier to scout and chase
---
- all other killer perks were much stronger ( old iron grasp, enduring )
---
- Billy had the flick
---
Bloodlust is a weak mechanic and doesnt help much, not like survivors can't loop to a different nearby window not to block the one they were first using, pallets were a decent mindgame and survivors never really utilized them ( on top of being worse at the time ), self care who care, bloodwebs were so huge that people had a single brand part in one out of 30 games, fast vaults didn't make the loops safe infinites and timers/boosts for gens were different back then.
---
If you were to ask me whether I'd prefer playing the game now or after its release as a killer, I'd go back. And I would even go back playing as a survivor, because the game was casualized tremendously.
---
If you actually, ACTUALLY think survivors were stronger back then ( ignore infinites ), then please, do not reply.
---
I play both killer and survivor. In swfs the game is completely different. If killer was already not good enough, swfs really put the icing on the cake. I play a lot more survivor nowadays, but I still remember getting my ass kicked with a bunch of meta perk swfs. There's nothing wrong with that, I just don't like playing games like that though.
---
No u :)
---
"I sawed this pallet in half!"
---
press space on a pallet to saw it in half, sawed pallets break when a survivor uses them, this perk has a 120 second cooldown
---
Yea honestly
---
Yeah. Btw i don't know how you are not getting spirit often, i face her like 6 times out of 10 matches, it's ridiculouss
---
Speedy bubba
---
That is so boring.
---
Spine Chill let's you know when she's looking at you in her phase state.
---
Could you post a link if you do it? Would be very interested ,in the still images :)
---
*emblem system* bothers me
---
I've always thought playing ghostface was just super stressful, the sound that you hear when survivors start spotting you just makes me sick.
---
Perks have a thick outline though, how old is this picture
---
Why the fuck is you tv on stool?
---
And then go cleanse again.
---
No, no, go on, show us how you'll drink it. :D
---
Looks like they finally got the Krueger mori correct!
---
So he'd be a 100%/105% speed killer? Every killer except the intentionally slow ones are 115%.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But yeah, the pallet thing should be a perk. Get a burst of speed after kicking a generator/kicking a pallet. Seriously, not talking about Phil right now, that thing should be in the game.
---
Ryou
---
I get that but, if it removes the ability to avoid all damage if not done directly at the killer it would be slightly balanced, and maybe make it like Decisive Strike to where it can only be used once or after you've been hooked already.
---
I got this earlier doing my clown daily. I usually reply something nice and light hearted and get back ‚Äúsorry‚Äù or something similar. People
---
Online forget it‚Äôs a person they‚Äôre messaging. Just don‚Äôt be toxic back and reply something neutral or kind and it‚Äôs a usual oof moment on their part.
---
Just curious, what rank do you play killer at? I think that in lower ranks killer is easier but in higher ranks killer is WAY harder. (I play both sides btw)
---
RYYYYYAAH
---
I was thinking awhile ago instead of them being 1 hit downs it would be cool if they ignored collision with anything but survivors. Like ghost hatchets.
---
Well they come from different universes. If the multiverse theory is true then there's an infinite amount of universes. Many of them will have Micheal Myers as a fictional character, others will have him be real. The odds are even higher for that happening is there are gods influencing the worlds.
---
Ew didn't need to see that
---
Yeah. I didn‚Äôt know the speed most killers were.
---
This is ridiculous. Decisive strike doesn't need nerfed. It's fine. Wait wait wait hold on. 
---
Ah here it is. 
---
Killer rulebook page #341: Surviviors are not allowed to have perks that the killer doesn't like. If said perk is equipped then the Survivior is not allowed to escape and just let the killer hook him.
---
Personally i would like SCP-1794 in the game. It would be such an awesome killer idea prove me wrong.
---
Ginny is the Dwight that never has an escape cake because he is always eating them
---
The fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all
---
he can have something like the red ballons that he can use like a ward or summ to scout over the map?
---
Wait what?
---
Sh*t! Id better do the same.
---
It takes about 4000 hours if you strictly Play survivor and neglect dailies.
---
About 2300 hours for Killer to be All maxed out. I reached full perks on one character at about 400 hours. Today i'd say 500 hours till you have your First character maxed.
---
Disagree, plays with at least 30.
---
*Stares at Hillbilly and Leatherface and laughs nervously*
---
Yeah two of the same character?? Who would do that. 
---
Also his name could be the spider and he could stun people with his deadlights and his weapon could be he crab legs or he could monch people like demo.
---
Their is an idle Crow and the clown is mixing his potions. He isn't "trying to win", he is taking the game hostage and being a dick
---
Use a map offering
---
11am-12pm on the 17th EST. That's what it's always been, they release on their time.
---
Wtf this TV
---
Infectious is very good with her. If you have ruin use it (if not run corrupt intervention which is just budget ruin), run M&amp;A if you have (whispers if you dont) and Thant if you have (and if you dont have thant run sloppy butcher)
---
Thanks!!!!
---
Why not?
---
&lt;3
---
rejoyce
---
Sure
---
[deleted]
---
T 1000 or a t 800. With Sarah or John conor as survivors
---
Too many tokens.
---
bayushki bayu husband now
---
Lol what anime is this
---
What was your username? I probably was that Myers.
---
Just make every button skill check ez ez
---
Just make this a Bubba skin.
---
nope nvm
---
He got a beard yet he's still a child
---
I mean, if he just stands there and never does anything yeah, that's griefing, but using your collision to secure free hits on a greedy play should be perfectly fine. It's the same thing as Wraith blocking a pallet, or body blocker Hag. As long as they aren't being an ass about it theres no problem.
---
The only one that is annoying to me is Shirtless Myers. That meme died about a year and a half ago
---
"you know the classic outburst from a possible kid" more like the classic from adults :P
---
I honestly believe iri head + belt is a bigger affront to match balance than ebony mori. Fight me.
---
Like 2 token perks is too much? Or having 5 token on a perk is too much?
---
The title is all the people who want them to release dedicated servers despite them not being ready
---
If it is bodyblocking as in just standing there and actually taking the game hostage, yeah, that is bannable (I think) and a major dick move, but bodyblocking to secure hits is not, its a valid tactic, used on killers such as Wraith to secure a hit after that slow-ass uncloak, and is, in my opinion, okay to do, it's also similar to bodyblocking to stop someone being hooked, as in both circumstances you're blocking them from doing something and ensuring your objective gets done faster/more efficiently, i.e. bodyblocking to get a hit reduces a large portion of a chase, bodyblocking to stop a hook can refuse a hook and ensure teammate safety for a longer period of time
---
Do you remember his perks? Was he using Dying Light, Insidious,  And BBQ?
---
I binge watched Otz for a week and now I can't stop getting 4k as Trapper.
---
Yes actually. I have a joke running with my friend group that I'll either escape, or die first hook. There is no in between.
---
leveling isn't that quick. I've only got all the survivors to level 50 and only one with prestige 3, and I'm right at 687 hours.  Haven't worked on killers yet.
---
Why camp?
---
THEY LOOK LIKE BARRY AND PAUL CHUCKLE WHAT THE FUCK
---
babysitter
---
will it be like the huntess where he just spouts incoherent nonsense even when nobodies around?
---
Either reduce the token count or lower the % of things.
---
Do we know what time the DLC drops?
---
Agreed but that doesn't seem to be the case here, you can see an idle crow
---
It‚Äôs possible the killer has a shit pc since the game loves to drop frames once a chase starts and I‚Äôve been accused of lag switching
---
While shirtless Myers has died. The idea of demo wearing a shirtless Myers shirt as a cosmetic legit gives me good chuckles.
---
Lol just had a feeding match with a huntress. Poor girl even apologized for "camping" even though 2 of us ran into the basement to save a fresh hook. Take the free win if the survivors hand it too you hahaha
---
Ah I see
---
Please, remove the 2nd part of this comment and I guarantee that the updoots will start flowing in.
---
In that image yeah, but the thread is about body blocking in general which is fine when not abused.
---
Corrupt intervention, devour of hope, PGTW, and a tracking perk. Not sure if tremors, bbq, discordance or surveillance
---
Considering the stop survivor only had 8k points it seems like the game was over very quickly. The ranking system seems to be working just fine.
---
Either they let us unlock every character in KYF (not transferring to ranked) or just let us have splinters
---
I mean it can prolonged a chase but I just don‚Äôt see it as the best exhaustion perk by any means. The most reliable in terms of you‚Äôre almost always gonna get to use it in a chase as long as the killer doesn‚Äôt have an instant down. But any good killer isn‚Äôt gonna fall for it and it‚Äôs not an amazing amount of distance gained.
---
YEs the game was over quite fast, but why long games that just hurt the killer so much are rewarded more, furthermore letting survs do anything means gens will fly by with the speed of light.   
---
It promotes masochism... I really dont like it... I get the trivia of entertaining the entity, but am i just supposed to let em do gens and watch em, i mean i could just torture em  and be a toxic cunt, but  idont feel like that ...
---
Which one is L√©ry's? Is it the map I always get when I have a Bubba ritual?
---
pls stab me
---
It‚Äôs another chainsaw killer!
---
They made the stairs wider to prevent this, was this not done on M OMEGALUL BILE?
---
Do it for the gram
---
You're one of my new favorite content creators ordz, you're amazing at the game and incredibly kind.
---
Survivors won't farm with me reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
MYC is a good perk for starters. I dont know how many free downs I've gotten off of it on people I wasn't even aware had it. The difference between the two is the survivor can just hide out the duration with no problem, I may not even see them again. DS on the other hand can let a survivor play like a screaming chimp for 60 seconds with no repercussions since you cant just stand on them for 60 seconds. If we could see a timer or affect that let us know its active, sure, I would be cool with that too, but, getting blindsided by what looked like a bad play by identical David #3 only to find out they had DS still or be forced to sit there and wait to punish him for his play is insane. Atleast give us a way to tell if they still have DS rather playing *guess who's getting stabby today* at random.
---
They made it darker? What the heck? Freddy needs to have his vision be on par with every other killer.
---
I sleep.
---
Thana, sloppy, ruin, stbfl is usually my go to. Short chases and can keep obnoxious gen pressure though out the game
---
True
---
Evader is about winning chases or hiding *near* the killer. No one likes players who just avoid player-interaction so the devs obviously don't reward that playstyle.
---
"dOinG gEnS, yOu?"
---
Janes the only character you need to do it twice to
---
Oh they beat the shit out of me. But I was laughing so much so it was hard to concentrate. They were very nice post game chat.
---
Whenever I see a ghostface, I get off of whatever I‚Äôm doing just to have a staring contest
---
Steve. He may not have the best perks compared to Nancy, but I've been wanting to main Steve for so long. I'll level up Nancy for teachables later down the line and then Demo.
---
You better hurry, you only have one day!
---
Ypu realise this was a thing in a previous ptb where when killer was near hook the survivor would not bleed, 
---
Survivors especially swf exploited this hard, they would all run around the hook making it impossible for killers to get hook kills.
---
Yeah, Ghostface might be the most civilized one
---
I sympathise. I really do, but the fact it's instadown with 3 hatchets is just stupidly powerful. 
---
I don't mind one, as it's risk reward for her. 3 goes so much freedom to miss and even worse on a decent huntress who can hit her shots.
---
Plague, Clown, Legion, and Spirit don't have one because they're purchaseable with shards. Clown is the first DLC killer to come without them. They took away Hag's and Doctor's because they can now be purchased with shards.
---
I get face camped quiet a bit since rank reset and I had an idea of that if they are within a certain distance of you while hooked then either they loose 1,000 blood points for every 5 seconds they are around you or make the killers movement speed slow along with nerfed lunng distance or even both cause I'm tired of loosing a tick mark and de ranking because some killer stare at me while hooked
---
The game is really fucking cheap baseline and goes on sale all the time. I'd love a deluxe edition that had all the killer/surv DLCs for like 60-80 bucks but it's not necessary.
---
Oh. My bad. I don‚Äôt have Spirit, so I don‚Äôt know.
---
Good stuff. Im planning on doing Demagorgon first since his perks are all interesting and then Steve because... well Steve and last Nancy and probably only until i get inner strength and Fixated lol
---
Tuesday evening
---
Survivors feel more toxic than Killers because there's four of them in a match #ChangeMyMind
---
This really does break the game.
---
Yup. This is like complaining you bought a game for full price and it goes on sale 2 years later
---
But it would be faster and people would just instantly sell almost everything they get. The grind probably keeps alot of people playing, if it's faster then some people might not play as long. Besides, getting blood points and items is already quick if that's what you want.
---
Yes but i was near the killer for more than half of the game he had no interest in anyone else except the jake. No one got hooked and he got injured but had an insta heal med kit. He was on him all game
---
I always think "cockroaches" more than rats. They skitter just as fast and are more resilient.
---
Someone called me a baby killer on console
---
Jokes on them cause they‚Äôre right
---
Some people genuinely think it's not farming if they use BT.
---
They're working on her right now, devs said it a few days ago.
---
If that was the case all of the comments that actually insult his appearance would be downvoted.
---
His power is spraying you with FlexSeal Liquid, his weapon is the barbell weight held by FlexTape.
---
I'd ~~kill~~ pay to have Crazy Eddie as killer.
---
Lithe q&amp;q ds adrenaline (or small game to deny noed).
---
Well her addons yeah, not her base kit
---
&gt;The difference between the two is the survivor can just hide out the duration with no problem, I may not even see them again. DS on the other hand can let a survivor play like a screaming chimp for 60 seconds with no repercussions since you cant just stand on them for 60 seconds
---
That's objectively false. You CAN stand over them for 60 seconds and If you need to wait a full 60 seconds to pick them up then you probably deserve to get hit with Decisive strike. If you aren't Tunnelling the full 60 seconds means nothing to you. If a survivor is playing as you describe like a "screaming chimp" and you see there's an obsession, well then you can take the educated guess "ok he probably has Decisive" and decide to slug or ignore him. 
---
&gt;If we could see a timer or affect that let us know its active, sure, I would be cool with that too, but, getting blindsided by what looked like a bad play by identical David #3 only to find out they had DS still or be forced to sit there and wait to punish him for his play is insane. Atleast give us a way to tell if they still have DS rather playing guess who's getting stabby today at random.
---
That completely kills the purpose of the perk. The perk is supposed to PUNISH a killer for going after a recently unhooked dude. If the killer knows the perk is present he's just gonna slug the guy and completely circumvent the Decisive.
---
Bruh I ain't even realise it was my cake day. I will remove to see experiment results.
---
Dont ask me why their not. Bunch of dicks imo.
---
Classic Claudette
---
I think what would be more buff inducing for it is you could save someone being carried in theory.
---
Well in my opinion that is the mindset of a beginner. After two years you should have enough bloodpoints used on characters to Begin with. I liked farming When I needed it the most since Every character was below lvl 20.
---
I pray to The Entity that this is satire, or that you just quit the game.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main
---
One of the reasons I was glad I downloaded DBD a couple months ago and just got my first P1 character last night, I should've prestige first but I wanted to get other survivors up to 40 and that wasn't working out well. Bring on the baby DWEETS
---
both sides bad
---
Your Welcome
---
Thanks
---
You‚Äôre missing the /s. Please add it, please!
---
Neither should be able to do it
---
Blendette = hides in bushes / grass because she dark skin. Baby Dwight = newbie player as Dwight.... (these terms are just slang so don‚Äôt worry yourself over dumb terms like this)
---
I hope this is a fucking joke. Like how do devs dare to add more variety to the game right?
---
I like rank reset because it allows me to play meme builds that don't work at rank 1. Plus if every game was a "must use my brain" kind of experience I would get tired of the game fast.
---
Blendette is a Claudette that's wearing super dark clothes, and often uses Urban Evasion to go around the map, blending into everything they possibly can (like tall grass). 
---
Baby Dwight is a new player who doesn't necessarily have a clue of the game yet, thus older players might feel the need to protect them.
---
Lightweight was the first perk I wanted to have a look at when I get Nancy's teachables so I can actually get a feel for the difference it makes with Fixated.
---
What is tunneling?
---
Been there, brother.
---
Blendettes are high rank Claudettes who all wear basic outfits that let them hide easier. They also tend to all play Claudette as a team to make it confusing. A baby x character is someone new to that character and/or new to the game and playing that character. It's just Dwight is a very common new survivor character choice. So you get baby Dwights more than baby Megs for example.
---
Floobity boobity come get on this bootie.  Im a survivor main, seeing the rage on the person who finds ruin too quickly is a DC or tunnel vision so hard it's hilarious.  Gen Poppin is my rapper name
---
Yeah Your Right it does look like that
---
If you see a floating or otherwise frozen survivor:
---
Run. There is no hiding, and while you have little chance to escape, running is your best bet. You cannot kill it. You can only run.
---
It‚Äôs the hospital.
---
Ok I will üôÇ
---
Should be every generator you contributed to, if it was every gen popped you could easily just hide in a locker or hide in general and farm easy points from doing nothing.
---
Honestly that would be hilarious, I would play killer way more if that was a thing-
---
You'd be surprised what he also does as Ghost Face. But I'll let him chime in and I hope I'm not mistaking him, but his username is familiar to me from somewhere else ü§ê
---
That's why you gotta make it private while playing MP games
---
No new perk, just rename Sloppy Butcher as ‚ÄúTHAT‚Äôs A LOTTA DAMAGE‚Äù
---
Maybe you shouldn't be able to pick and choose what the devs add and what the killer player plays.
---
Just grab a 3 gen at the start of the game, put your traps around them and wait until they come ;)
---
If devs want people to stop DCing, stop adding annoying survivor perks. It was more fun when perks were simple like sprint burst and self care, now I can‚Äôt loop anyone without having to worry about mettle of man or adrenaline. Having to injure and down everyone just for them to stay injured and instantly heal once the last gen is done makes me just want to leave and find less sweaty survivor players.
---
The game does not work like that pal. Both sides have special abilities that work wonders when used well and have their own unique counterplay. Like any other game ever created.
---
Nothing is more funny than pulling off a clutch pebble, looping someone for 5 minutes straight, or getting a 4k with BK Myers. Keeps some spice in the game IMHO.
---
Omg how does a game updates this much in just two weeks
---
thanks
---
Should stay as is, that doesn't sound like David King
---
Hot take: Survivors don't need as many bloodpoints as, aside from some okay perks, other survivor characters they could be leveling are just skins. Killers are unique and have meta powers and so deserve more BP. However survivor only dlc like Ash and Bill should be half as much of a regular DLC cost cause survivors are, as I said, basically just alt skins
---
Actually... thinking about it. I have to say, if they turned off collision I'd like that to also count for walls and pallets... If there was an animation when starting phase then standing still as you're phasing should only consume 5% of the power bar.
---
Explanation: With Barbecue, killers get rewarded for doing their objective. Surivors have to stop doing gens just to get more BP and it's still harder to get the stacks. One stack should be either 20 or 25% for each generator. And it wouldn't be op because some games only 0-2 gens get completed.
---
I can't hook you unless I get closer
---
LET'S SEE IF IT'S GONNA LEAK
---
Would you people actually support a Phil Swift killer concept?
---
ALL HAIL THE BASEMENT DWELLER
---
They flex their skills by flexing David's muscles.
---
Oh ho! Then come as close to the pallet as you‚Äôd like!
---
do you imagine the voice actress during the record session XD
---
tf is that tv stand?
---
She still makes a audible crackling noise when she starts it doesn't she? Or can survivors not hear it.
---
Yeah, but if you hate playing as killers it wouldn't be that fun since you are playing with less point gains all the time
---
Or when someone waits until the time in the lobby hits 06 seconds and DCs
---
They made the Dream World darker, yes, I suspect off the back of previous complaints about it being too bright (especially when indoors).
---
&gt; *The devs haven't said anything else about it since then?*
---
What time period were you referring to with "that one time"?
---
Meanwhile a sabo Jake with a toolbox ended the game before it ever truly began. To make it worse, there was about half as many hooks on the maps.
---
Sprint Burst was a perk that existed with the original game and had a 20 second cooldown that recovered while running. Adrenaline was the same and they had seperate cooldowns.
---
Pallet stuns were longer and there were double pallets everywhere, so safe pallets didn't need to exist, but some did. *Original cow tree being twice as wide with 2 windows and a pallet*
---
Window vaults were longer for killers and there were moon offerings to make the maps darker. *Prestiged survivors anyone?*
---
Leader made teammates do gens faster, on top of everything else. Prove Thyself made you do gens much faster than it does now.
---
Wraith had an even longer uncloack so it was nearly impossible to ever catch people. He also started uncloacked and had a global bell so you always knew when he was cloaking or not. 
---
Trapper took 5 seconds to put down a trap instead of 3. And traps could be permanently sabotaged. 
---
Add all of that with the comment you replied to. Survivors had all of that. If you think that version of survivor was weaker than this one, you're smoking crack. It was literally impossible to lose as survivor if survivors knew how to loop. Lucky for killers, they didn't or this game would've died faster than F13 could say "Lawsuits killed our game."
---
If you didn't recieve the 5000 for escaping then yes it was a killer DC.
---
That's a good point. I'm fairly new so from my perspective I want every game to be competitive so I can improve, but if I was experienced like you I can definitely see where you're coming from
---
Especially on killer
---
&gt;This was a side project that I did, not because I was offered "exposure" and decided it was worth not being paid, but because I had fun and it made me happy to do it. ....This was recreation for me.
---
Which is part of the general problem, is it not?  Why hire someone or spend existing man hours on Project X when someone will do it in their free time under the guise of "contest".  It is a trend that is increasing in corporate environments, and not just gaming.  Even in my line of work, we have found that people will spend more time, energy, and passion competing for something to "win" than they would ever spend on an actual work project.  So the company gets extra free/cheap labor out of the deal while patting themselves and the "winner" on the back.  
---
&gt;Do you get paid for your hobbies? If I were a video gameplay tester for a living, should I expect to be paid when I play games for fun in my own time? 
---
When my hobbies provide a service for others, you can be damn well sure I'm getting paid.  The extent of which it is monetized is determined by your skill in the craft.  One of my hobbies is pinball machines and repair.  A lucrative hobby if skilled, because people are downright abusive assholes to machines, and oblivious to required maintenance.  As for gameplay tester, there is a vast difference between that job and gaming for fun, but gaming can be monetized via twitch, which many people (even here) have turned into a full time job.
---
&gt;If I'm playing a game for fun and discover a bug which I decide to point out on the game's forums, should I demand payment for that because I'm a professional?
---
Unsolicited services should never be rendered payment. You are providing charity to the company in that instance.  The same as if I'm a plumber and tell McDonald's why the toilet is leaking that I just used as a customer.     
---
Your skill is good, but you should be looking for better ways to monetize and market your skills.  Because if you keep believing these types of items are "fair", you are hurting yourself in the long run.
---
It's not delivery, it's Digiorno
---
Your myers is cursed, delete and buy another one
---
I didn‚Äôt, so I guess they probably DCed then, they must have rage quit
---
I just finished a match against a scratched mirror Myers. He played a Leary‚Äôs offering but someone else played a cold wind offering. Guess which map we got :p
---
I consistently use my survivor BP gains to level up my killer and my killer BP gains to level up my survivor.
---
I would understand your take if the bloodpoints pools were separate but they aren't. Most people use BP for both killer and survivors
---
*dancing intensifies*
---
OMG, this ended so well for me. I was playing with three other toxic assholes (they called me ugly cause I was Nea, lol) and they DC'd as soon as the killer so much as breathed in their direction. I found the hatch but stood there, letting the killer close it and farm me. He let me go in the end, and in end-game chat revealed that he was actually a Rank 1 doing dailies for his wife. It was the best fucking thing EVER.
---
The anniversary stream would have been May, so by that reckoning they did exactly what they said they would do. 
---
Your best bet is to provide feedback through an official channel, perhaps even provide an edited screenshot to suggest what you believe the Dream World should look like.
---
Unhooks are easier than gens you fat bum. But I think there should be a version for gens, it just should be a separate perk, or you could combine the two
---
Excuse my french but what the fuck are runnies
---
The dude asked what other games, I gave a list showing others, whether people like them or not was never part of the question asked.
---
The Mori is flex tapping the survivor's mouth
---
What is gen camping
---
New Killer: The Damage.
---
But if the killer slugs, that's not tunneling or the survivor being hooked. And if the killer just happens to find them again after they're unhooked despite not looking for them specifically, they're just supposed to let them go? DS allows recently unhooked survivors to also make dumb plays that they probably would've not done otherwise and not get punished for it.

I spent all weekend playing Survivor and holy shit is it so much less infuriating. By the end of five killer matches I'm on the brink of breaking into a NASA facility so I can launch myself directly into the sun but after 20+ survivor games all I had was a bit of a headache from staring at the screen too long. I suppose the game is still asymmetrical though in that the killer is set up against four chads who bully the shit out of him.
---
Wha-
---
That's called griefing.
---
I swear, later when I have my own game company, I Will make a game that is full of memes
---
They did the same thing with Joe Keery and Natalia Dyer's twitters like a week before the DLC was revealed.
---
Hmm..
---
Perhaps, but don't forget that it also counters the Clown and Infectious Fright.
---
There are some good wraiths out there but most of the time i just get camped lmao
---
Gen rushing is preventable with other perks, I play killer quite a bit and understand it can be frustrating to not be able to stop gens, but running pop, ruin, or a number of other progression perks can help to offset some of the issues with gens
---
I had this happen, one jacke was unhooking another right in front of me with the same Jake skin and then they both got downed. I got Hatemail after but, I can't refuse an offer like that when players make it easy.
---
no 'cause 100% of O is still O. I'm not too much into math anymore but i think it still works like that
---
That would be an interesting solution as well. We could also consider having it be on the last gen, add in an element of teamwork and planning while letting it have its "should we start now or wait to find out" presence it currently has.
---
Thanks ^^ 
---
Although the guy at the workshop thought I was some psychopath because I tried explaining what DBD is :):
---
But really. When someone unhooks their teammate in front of me that tells me I'm going to win easily. Therefore it's just a choice between winning like an asshole or winning not like an asshole. That choice seems to trip up way too many people on this sub.
---
It‚Äôs ideal but only 1 scenario out of all the possible ones. BT saves a hooked survivor from being tunneled in more situations than not. A good killer won‚Äôt chase a survivor who was BTed, a bad killer will.
---
It should just give one stack for every altruistic actions : unhooking, healing.
---
That almost always happens to me where the hex spawns out in the open or right next to the survivors
---
I dont think I could handle the leprechaun, he would annoy me to death lmao
---
Can I have it? Lol
---
Yeah I swear that nobody on PS4 knows how to farm anymore. Makes me worry for the next double bloodpoints where I have 12 Gruesome Gateau‚Äôs on a nurse (who I am most probably balls with)
---
I play legion and often get 32k blood points hitting the cap, and only getting 4 kills am I still losing? I'm honestly not sure
---
The It
---
I mean just because they have 700 ping to you doesn't mean they have 700 ping to everyone. If the ping is high or fluctuates a lot for you just leave and find another lobby.
---
Would be kinda cool if each survivor (meaning like. Each Dwight.  Each Meg. Etc) saw something completely different.
---
Its not always the killers internet being good or bad. If you're in the states as a survivor and you try playing against a killer in Australia you're going to have a bad time.
---
you're right. i dont like hilbilly. but i do play huntress
---
Noed is fine imo if you always remove the hex totems you see. There's a chance that you'll get all of them and then you'll basically overpower most hag builds imo.
---
I feel like he would be down for this too, after Jontron, Phil has been getting lots of popularity, and has even been on Instagram, or Snapchat or something

---
Sub 'my drink' with eating an ice cream cone like an ass' and that's basically me üòÇ
---
The actual counter is to leave totems near gates up and only cleanse totems that seem really well hidden
---
Cause if you cleanse all totems you see, there's a higher chance it spawns on a totem no one could find
---
Thank you!
---
For addons, I always love bone Clapper and ghost. The combo is great for scaring the bejeezus out of people.
---
Thanks but it's just a question. Dont need to be rude about it.
---
I really really want a Halloween cosmetic for Ghostface, there's so much potential
---
It's when one survivor is chased and repeatedly hooked/attacked while the killer ignores other survivors. Most of the time, the killer is just going for what they can find, but some killers maliciously target one survivors so as to ruin a game for that specific person. It's hard to tell mid-game which one is really happeneing (malicious tunneling or convenient tunneling) so people end up having really heated arguments about it post-game.
---
Just dont start the game if u have high ping
---
So, odds seem kind of low that it's going to be Pennywise because a) we have a clown and a nightmare already, so what would he even be/do? and then b) the movie already came out so now would be the time for the DLC right?
---
Could it be something for the Dr. Sleep movie, maybe?  Danny Torrence survivor and...Rose the Hat killer?  A psychic killer would be new, I guess...

How hard is it to crop your meme tho?

---
What did you do to deserve this ?
---
This. I'm not sure why the devs added the randomly changing DS obsession mechanic, or the bit about it not even showing the obsession claws on the right person. The devs don't seem to understand that killers only avoided their old obsession because old DS was a complete momentum killer.
---
The best friend but yes I just did my phone died right after I posted that comment thank you
---
It shows how many are affected, if they die it goes down.
---
you said it was spicy so i didnt want you to get the diarrhoea. the poopies
---
Well, I don't usually see the word "Safety" pair well with "Horror", because it hinders the horror aspect. The pallet thing should be in the starter kit of every killer tbh, would make survivors more wary about dropping certain pallets. The perfect integration could be instantly gaining one tier of Bloodlust when breaking a pallet, and then, the survivor would actually try to hide and lose LOS.
---
Oh, yeah. Alternatively, we could get some more outfits. Wouldn't want to be seen with those old ones that have been released a few weeks ago, gotta shine and glitter while being chased around the entire map. Ca-ching, boy!
---
Roadmap
---
I have a buddy who plays Michael Myers and he'll leave the stalk button just before tier 3 in case people try to save whoever he's camping lol
---
YESSSS. Everytime I go against someone playing a weak killer, they usually dont get many kills yet they're also never toxic. I usually tell them I'm glad they don't care about what the meta is. Sometimes a few of them complain - usually about bad Ruin spots lowkey ruining the game, but that is 100% valid. As a weak killer you NEED Ruin and it sucks to have it gone within the first 30 seconds.
---
I mean leave before the match starts. You can have fast internet but if the killer lives on the other side of the world you are probably going to have high ping. 
---
For example, I live in NA and play a lot during the morning which means I get quite a few people from Europe joining my lobby. I have Fiber internet with 1gb up and 1gb down but I still get people with 150 or more ping in my lobbies.
---
And yes you might come across a killer who has slow internet but they can try and find survivors who live close to them. If you see a killer lobby with red ping, and it stays there, back out and find another lobby.
---
Do Killer+Surv chapters always come with a map?
---
They never said it will be killer only. Only that a chapter doesn't necessarly mean Killer+Survivor+Map anymore.We only know that a map rework is coming instead of a new map.
---
s p o k k y
---
25 sounds right because of scaling, lower blood webs cost less to complete
---
From ''We won't add clowns due to real fears''  to LET's ADD PENNYWISE lol
---
I'm really excited but more so as it may be one of his other works
---
Hex:It even works underwater 
---
Once any Lit totems for other active hexes are cleansed they are restored after you hook 2 survivors (one use per game)
---
"Now that's a lot of damage"

But DS is on a timer, where this version of Dead Hard won't be. It could be the next Ultimate Stun Combo with DS, Head-On, Dead Hard, Firecrackers and Deliverance

By the time I see this tomorrow i better see 100 upvotes
---

---
what the fuck
---
Pretty sure you have to fall off the map and then leave again
---
this is by far the most insane thing I've seen in this game lmao
---
There's a difference, though. Hillbilly is based off Leatherface, but the Clown ain't based on Pennywise.
---
Power: Flex Tape and Seal
---
Thats a lot of damage.
---
Hex Tape.
---
I sawed this boat in half.
---
Yeah thats true. Depends on what you choose in the blood webs too so i guess you could stretch it by picking common itemd
---
Your point was pretty shit tbh  What‚Äôs the ‚Äòspecial and unique‚Äô counterplay to a 5 blink nurse who isn‚Äôt garbage?
---
There was a ptb on this all it did was make survivor really easy. First hook was infinite so people just did gens.
---
Did you ever play left4dead2? I feel like what they did with the jockey they could apply to Chucking hooking survivors. 
---
Let's say he wraps a yoyo around his victims throat then chokes/steers they towards a hook. And they could just add a hook animation where after he rides them onto the hook he throws a level and the hook raises off the ground. 
---
Would be a perfect time for the classic Chucky laugh too
---
Not far, around 20-25 ish if you really plan out your webs. I'd personally just level one and then use them to get more points.
---
Easy choice for me as a killer main, got 1m bp and 4k shards for dat sweet sweet Demo.
---
We haven't had one without a map so far.
---
Only times we get a character but no map is when it's a paragraph that only contains a killer or survivor.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt look too much into it they follow pewdiepie and he‚Äôs never even played the game
---
I'd think Barlowe or Randall Flagg maybe.
---
I would love Randall Flagg tbh.
---
I have only played the new Freddy once but I am pretty sure it is an add-on
---
We know the next chapter is coming in December thanks to the roadmap, which is also when the Blu-ray and DVD releases of It: Chapter 2 release. It'd make sense for them to drop a crossover DLC around that time.
---
its an addon. the removes the snares, but add the pallets.
---
As it should be.

Ohhh 
---
Ok

What were you supposed to do, let her down you?

At first I thought Steve was humping Clauddie, but it's more like they're conjoined by the legs or something. The more I look at this, the more cursed I get.

It‚Äôs an addon, one of them looks like garden rake
---
Yeahhhhh, I don't quite do as much anymore. Also, SHOOSH.
---
We kept running until we fell off the map, but it just respwaned us outside the exit again. This clip starts right after the respawn. 
---
Is there a specific way to re-exit? Or should this have worked?

That's damn good.

I don‚Äôt know anything about Dr. sleep but based off hat I know of the shining I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs a character that could work as a killer in DbD
---
Regardless of easy, the same ritual over and over is tedious. 
---
I wanted beer why they stopped naming the rituals after the killer‚Äôs powers (rite of the jaws, bell, evil within) and started naming after the killer (Rite of the spirit, Ghostface, etc).
---
Imo that's more of a reason it doesn't matter. Clown is a littleral clown. Isnt Pennywise an entity that simply takes the shape of a clown?
---
What if they‚Äôre both bad
---
correct
---
Thanks mate.
---
Well he doesn‚Äôt as much anymore :/
---
Boi I made it myself
---
But doesn't it not matter due to the fact that I don't attack survivors, and the perk requires me to stay within 24 meters?
---
oh really? i figured it was gonna be killer only since we are getting two survivors current chapter. im happy to be wrong here lol
---
I plan to take lots of photos in my newly completed costume, and more vids. üò±üî™

Oh okay! Many thanks

Stealth killers are a lot of fun, id recommend GF

Now I wanna know what he THOUGHT he was posting to.
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about when the dvd is coming out. There‚Äôs hope
---
Inner Strength!
---
&gt; Meanwhile a sabo Jake with a toolbox ended the game before it ever truly began. To make it worse, there was about half as many hooks on the maps.
---
I remember refunding the game at launch because I tried killer and basically had nowhere to hook anyone.
---
I want it but while playin against it i`m gonna shit my pants but how memento will look
---
You sure you got your tabs right?
---
Could be a power revolving around his split personality so he could be a killer. Also love the name
---
Dammit monsta
---
Tea bagging doesnt effect you losing or winning and is not a bannable offense but you‚Äôre admitting you intentionally griefed which is a bannable offense.
---
Personally, I have to say legion. Keep in mind ghost face can be snapped out of his ability and then he is just an M1 killer with no power until he gets his power back. Legion with the right perks has the ability to do some serious damage. Legion can injure a lot of people very quickly and is very good for obtaining lots of blood points. Legion was the first killer I ever bought and I don‚Äôt regret it. A lot of people say he‚Äôs weak after the nerf but honestly he‚Äôs still pretty solid
---
WHAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
---
skill floor = the lvl of experience you need to not completely suck with a character. A character with a low skill floor is noob friendly 'cause in one game you got the concept. 
---
Trapper or Wraith for exemple have low skill floor.
---
Skill ceiling = the experience you need to play a character at its full potential. 
---
Trapper for exemple as a low skill ceiling too. Mechanically here is almost nothing to learn.
---
Billy and Nurse got "high" skill ceilings.
---
Rank 20 is an interesting place
---
strongest possible flex
---
Ah ok because the roadmap says next chapter but no mention of a map, So I was wondering.
---
Guess It could be solo Surv though.
---
They're the same person
---
that would make decisive useless and more situational then unbreakable
---
This dude above who posted all the links has done the same in all the other posts. He is a troll.
---
Imo it needs to be nerfed on the killer side rather the  giving the survivor more. They already can't use the exit gates so it's pretty much an easier to proc blood warden since it's Instant (and stacking them and remember me makes escaping take much much longer). 
---
Outside of what's mentions I think showing the aura of survivors and giving exposed is a little overkill. Maybe remove the aura/exposed effect (probably the aura since you can just run more with it)
---
If it was a real perk I could see people going for complete endgame builds with noed, blood warden, and probably bbq to find survivors during and in the last 2 minutes of a match.
---
WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™
---
I have just been running into a lot of campers lately. It truly breaks the game.
---
Sorry but this makes no sense to me, just cleanse totems. A warning would kill the perk. Its fine where it is. Especially with inner strength coming out.
---
Still starting from what we began, BT is not a free pass so you should think when and how you are unhooking
---
Really?
---
If they make The Doctor free new players will have an easier time getting bloodpoints
---
Pardon?
---
I can imagine Christine being a playable killer scaled down (but still proportionate) to be a lower height than the debris around the map but the only weakness is being unable to vault windows...
---
yep this games ranking system is garbage
---
It's not a mistake. It's calculated hype. I think we're getting a paragraph shortly after the Stranger Things chapter.
---
Always a curious question indeed.
---
Go sleep, DLC is like 23-24 hours away
---
Would be cool to have both as skins
---
People act like teabagging is attune with committing the worlds worst sin but honestly it‚Äôs like the only action you can do as a survivor. 
---
Teabagging as an insult is also supposed to be over a dead body, I don‚Äôt teabagging in dbd as any different from just spamming shift in minecraft.
---
I should probably Prestige my Dwight so I don't get unintended mercy from killers thinking I'm a Baby Dweet.
---
Protip Baby Dweets with the LF DLC purchased; there is a black eye skin for Dwight to help you get maximum sympathy.
---
Insomnia is a bitch yo.
---
My two sawed in half boat pieces are ready.

That's what you get for owning johnny english on dvd
---
Real shit?
---
The system is per to per so its half on you dude it's you connection to the killer and in turn them send data back to u
---
Killer has 0 ping to "server" right now. If you see 700ms, it's your ping to killer. Leave the lobby.
---
Hey, as long as her chase music is the from the John Carpenter film I wouldn't mind.
---
Mr Mercedes next killer confirmed
---
Idk, ive had survivors run into walls like that with no lagswitching
---
Pennywise / It would work hugely in their favour though. The It films are insanely popular and would bring new players. BHVR are making a horror game - I doubt they would turn down the opportunity to add a character as iconic as Pennywise.
---
Yeah idk why people think I‚Äôm hacking and it‚Äôs weird because their serious, I like a good joke after matches but when people are serious I‚Äôm just so bewildered.
---
They haven‚Äôt announced a date
---
Not perfect, I can‚Äôt see anything wrong with it. Good work ;)
---
I had a swgurs
---
"No!"
---
Why would you stay in a lobby with 700 ping?
---
Or the truck from Maximum Overdrive, I mean cmon!
---
respecting the loops rn. need to practice mine far more. I've only successfully juked by performing a 180 like twice. nice clip though.
---
I've had that a few times. Just stick them in grass around gens or behind vaults.
---
GhostFace has a little bit of a skill cap to him to play, which can be hard to learn if you have never played killer before.
---
Overall though GhostFace is a much more viable killer than the Legion and if you can put the practice into him it would definitely be worth it. 
---
With GhostFace you need to know general survivor spawns and how they will think. You need to be able to maneuver around them without getting caught so you can stalk them. It's also a recommended strategy to "99%" their stalk meter so you can down them when they are in an easier spot ( basically giving him similar power to the Hillbilly). He also relies heavily on mind- games as you need to down survivors very quickly before their exposed timer runs out, and if they aren't exposed you are a basic M1 killer with not much to help you. A technique I've  seen some advanced GhostFace players do is , activate Night Shroud during chase to easily mind-game loops since you lose your terror radius and red stain. 
---
If you find yourself having a hard time with GhostFace switch over to Legion. He is beginner friendly and can still get the job done. He will be a good starter to get a hang of how killer gameplay works. : -) best of luck to you!
---
Just farm, survivors are usually very accommodating if they realize early on that it's a farming party

I figured there was but dedicated servers got pushed back so I thought they would rather work on that extra blood points

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/82749/designer-notes-new-status-effects-and-bloodweb-changes yeah sounds like it
---
Killer - 1 and well. Solo survivor maybe green or purple as I can run loops but just not perfecting my 360s. With my carry group definently 1 tho lol
---
I always send a killer a nice gg if i lose or even win.
---
whoever says gg ezy, deserves to be lynched at the fuckin stand.
---
She does make that crackling noise when starting, but thats not very dependable as the audio sometimes doesn't play, and sometimes happens randomly. Most spirits will start to charge the ability, just to get the noise, and then let go before it's done to be safe.
---
I don't think lore matters when adding licensed chapters. If lore mattered, the entity wouldn't have brought in hawkins lab in the current condition it is in. There is an open portal that leads to the upside down in that map, and if lore mattered, the entity from that show should have a connection, slowly taking over the entitys realm or fighting the entity for it at the very least.
---
The problem with this is that you will leery regularly only see certain survivors due to unique perks. Let's say based on Meg being an athlete, she gets a perk that increases her movement speed by 5%. That would be absolutely insane and you would almost only see Megs. How of course, Meg doesn't need to have this perk specifically, it could be something else, something weak. But whichever survivor ends up getting arguably strong perks will be the only survivors that you end up seeing.
---
When he downs you he has to scream
---
THATS A LOT A DAMAGE
---
You gotta be 40m withing range of hook when unhooking happens.
---
It worked in a different clip that I've seen
---
Every match as Doctor in red ranks is a nightmare... But that laugh, that damn laugh...
---
I hit rank 15 today, where does the high rank starts in this game?
---
Nice
---
Losing 1000 is too much if ya ask me, at best you could just say ‚Äúface campers get no points from their hook kill‚Äù and that would actually make sense
---
Also, what about when survivors raptor circle the hook victim instead of doing gens, forcing the killer to stay if he knows they‚Äôre just waiting for him to leave or trying to bait him away?
---
Well he definitely should learn what each collocation means
---
That‚Äôs like basically what I said, 40m from the hook, 40m from the the hook when unhook happens; same thing.
---
Yeah for some reason this sub is absolutely full of disgruntled billy mains and p3c's just being angry. Bunch of savages in this town.
---
That's why I never use my good items, I just collect them and admire them in my inventory LOL
---
Isn't being a youtuber the exact same then? People have their hobbies to entertain themself and others, typical a pessimistic person here, has nothing to do w 'taking a game serious'. Not sure where you got that from. Its an cool outfit and as proved numerous times above a lot of people are entertained and like it.
---
Anyone else waiting for the Hellraiser chapter üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
No tinkerer is hot garbage.  It needs a buff for sure but the devs didn't think the numbers through fully
---
IKR?!?!
---
Why? Doc is decent. He's an M1 killer with deny potential. He turns a lot of ehhhh unsafe pallets into guaranteed hits.
---
Plus he has a built in way to find survivors at the start of match.
---
The mistake I see most Docs make is trying to get survivors into T3 madness ASAP. You don't do that- each time you try Therapy shit you reset bloodlust and you're walking slow as fuck. You give the survivor time to run around the map, memorize tiles, see how you behave, and then use that shit against you. It's why imo he's one of the easiest/ most common killers to run a 5 gen chase against.
---
Just play him like an M1 killer with some small denial niches. He's decent.
---
Look I was only proposing it based on "fun" value like what BHVR adds content based around. I'm sick of survivor having "survivor" playstyle. That's it. They need varieties and ways to use counterplay as killer. I'm sick of mindgames being the only counterplay for the survivor playstyle.
---
I became a David main ever since I got the lunar jacket
---
What else can you do when you see 4 survivors spawn all together with 3 or 4 flashlights. If I see a party like that t I often decide to bring noed just to be safe. You gotta punish the cheeky fuckers
---
Maybe we're getting 3 survivors and no killer
---
Except the maps in the game aren't the real locations. The Entity builds the maps (or realms) based on characters' memories.
---
Perks?
---
Mafia man. - Being well known amongst the city has it's perks, but also disadvantages. Being that used to people out to get you, your able to detect the killer from a further range than usual. Increases your chances to be the obsession.
---
Don't do this.
---
Probably hardcore tunneling some people only target one person until they‚Äôre dead
---
I mean you can still point or wave as a survivor
---
It's literally a 50/50 coin toss whether they have phased or not
---
no. None of them are taken in consideration. Skill ceiling isn't the full potential of a character it's the experience needed to reach that full potential.
---
25k
---
Yeah. I'd say remove the aura, and leave the exposed effect.
---
Ash's puppet and Hawaiian shirt
---
Perhaps the Entity is able to tap into the Upside Down, and perhaps it is strong enough to resist the gradual consumption/takeover. I don't know. We're falling down a rabbit hole over here.  
---
We can definitely agree on one thing; licensed DLC is not lore friendly.
---
me waiting for my ultra rare flashlight that disables a killers add ons for 30 seconds when i blind them so the cunts can know how it feels to get hit w Franklin's

I use the saw blade over my bloody blade for that CRISP buzz

I dunno. Let‚Äôs wait and see...

I don't know but I read Terry Crews instead of Tim Curry and now I kinda want that
---
Bell is really easy compared to the rest ... surprisingly large window for surprise attack
---
Question about ghost face. As a survivor I don't really understand his stalk ability. I know he has to power up a meter and such to expose people but does it go away after a while of not seeing you or will his meter always stay at where it was left off?
---
OMG me 2!
---
Somebody make full killer page with info and everything please
---
Cuz killers ‚Äúhave it hard‚Äù
---
I don't need, YouTube its full of it, it's kinda insulting actually.
---
Myers and Ghostface.
---
To expand on what /u/mimikker said, the third person perspective allows survivors to see while fully hidden behind rocks/similar sized structures, and allows survivors to have a good perspective at corners of buildings/jungle gyms. Killers having this ability would be super strong.
---
Upvote because dbh
---
When you trying to 99% but you pop it instead.
---
Nice, you have wiggle room.  I burned most of mine.  I‚Äôm sitting at 1 million, 3 dailies and 1200ish shards.
---
As much as id love another cool licensed killer, id rather have another original again who i can buy with shards and actually afford some cosmetics
---
Not gonna lie, I feel safer right off the hook in front of the killer than any point in the game.
---
DS, unbreakable, body block, BT, dead hard, adrenaline, head on, flashlights, insta heals
---
An unhook puts an acting agent back into the match with potential cards up the sleeve. Always worth it imo. If I got hook farmed EVERY time I went on hook, I would legitimately have way more fun playing this game. Dying on first or 2nd hook is way- WAY worse.
---
That sound playing was a bug, and is fixed as of now, so no crackling sound plays at all.
---
Everything smells like bleach and it's really itchy.
---
50/50
---
Jokes on you, I run Unbreakable and Adrenaline pretty much all the time.
---
You realize breaking a pallet resets bloodlust?
---
That couldn't be more frightening.
---
Dont forget the jawline.
---
Akame ga Kill on r/DeadByDaylight what year is this?
---
Thanks for the explanation. I never thought about it that way, but I can definitely see the sense in that.
---
Wraith had one as well
---
Im not looking to invest them in the shrine or something im just waiting for another original chapter to drop so i can get it for free. but yeah i have to wait some for that. Also if a really dope cosmetic drops i can just buy it with shards (jk you have to pay for all the dope ones)
---
You have to be extra careful around rank reset or you end up spooking rank 20s away from the exit gates and they run off into nothing and get entitied.
---
True story. Feels bad.
---
Another chainsaw tho? I rather he force feed survivors clorox
---
They're both dudes
---
Had a Dwight who teabagged me from a gen because he saw me stalking him from a corner (Ghostface).
---
He didn't manage to kick me out of shroud and less than a second later I exposed and instadowned him, then teabagged his downed body right back.
---
How long does deliverance last? Curious if they would work together.
---
Of course, and that's why I propose for it to not remove bloodlust anymore. It's crippling for killers on maps where pallets are 5 meters from each other, and with the jungle gyms that you easily lose LOS around..
---
What are the changes to the bloodweb that are coming out soon? I can't look them up while at work. Should I stop leveling people past 40 or bring them all the way to 50?
---
Killer main: I love taking survivors to the hatch just to close it on them

Solo killers are also referred to as Paragraph.
---
At least, Leatherface was before the website was revamped, so I don't see why Ghostface would be different.
---
Honestly, if you are going back and chasing the unhooked survivor right after they get unhooked, you are camping and I understand why they are salty.
---
I've only had this game for a week lol. Point is I didn't think I'd be good with him but ended up enjoying his play style after going after that daily.
---
I think for some people and including myself (although I don't DC because of it) Legion is just not that fun to play against. His ability is boring and oftentimes it feels like there is no way to escape a chase because of his ability.
---
Monika from Doki Doki Literature club- She uses glitches and reality warping against people. I also want to see her in 3d.
---
Killers don‚Äôt need bloodlust all the time. It‚Äôs a poorly made band-aid fix to infinites, and if a killer is in an infinite, it doesn‚Äôt involve pallets. The bloodlust removal on pallets is so that killers aren‚Äôt rewarded for doing poorly in a chase that involves basic pallet loops
---
The lobby ping indicator is not accurate for you all telling him to dodge the lobby. Everyone who has MLGA knows this. The ping might be fine in the lobby and once the game starts it jumps over 300.
---
Is this some sort of ‚ÄúNon-STBFL‚Äù joke that I‚Äôm too stacked to understand?
---
I highly suggest watching gameplay videos of the killers to see which best fits your playstyle. Check out Monto and Hybridpanda videos and you will get a good look at them. Monto goes full tryhard and can be a bit toxic, and HybridPanda is just amazing and keeps it lighthearted.
---
After hitting a survivor he should say: "THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE"
---
You don't need to provide evidence because is already there?
---
Isn't the point of providing evidence to show that there's something backing your claim?
---
Probably the smart play, but I don‚Äôt mind greasing the devs pockets.  I usually save shards so I can insta lvl 50 a new prestige/character.
---
Icamp.com was a nice touch
---
*IT Chapter Confirmed*
---
Fun fact they originally planned for killer to be in 3rd person and surv to be in 1st... Imagine.
---
How is he supposed to upload it from his console to reddit
---
Also its only useful during end game. As killer Id much rather use a perk that helps kill all survivors before end game.
---
As an aspiring doctor and being bong boi player, I salute
---
This is me
---
Hi,
---
How do you take someone off the killer‚Äôs back?
---
fr though, why is it always the Trappers? Had one who pretended he was doing the trap daily, so I helped him out. Got killed.
---
Then got another one who got a 2k, and then caught me and let me wiggle off on a gen where I stepped on a trap. He picked me up and let me wiggle off at a gen again. Well what was I supposed to think? 5 seconds later he yanks me off the gen and I get sacrificed lol
---
Go to Xbox.com download the video file then upload it to reddit. That‚Äôs what I do
---
*claudette‚Äôs gonna die soon oooo*
---
At level 40-49 3 perks will appear on the bloodweb and you can get up to 2 of them. At level 50, 4 perks will appear but you can still only get 2 of them.
---
Nah she got a hit on someone else she‚Äôs smart for injuring everyone
---
Stay golden, ponyboy
---
Not...really?  Honestly it's kind of a bad choice for a King-themed chapter, I only thought it might be a potential because of the upcoming movie.  There are far more iconic characters from King's lineup.
---
In that case you could've chased the killer while he was chasing jake.  The closer the better (read: more points)
---
Didn‚Äôt hack the dictionary I see. 0/10. Try again meme master.
---
Idek who Jack is..
---
Keyboard and mice on console is just an adapter as you cant plug your normal keybord in and play most games. The adapter just makes your movements on a mouse controller movements.  And dbd has a hilariously low max sens on console anyways
---
People want Pennywise and I'm here saying, that he is literally an entity of some sort so it wouldn't make that much sense.
---
But I take whatever killer is added if anything happens
---
Someone on another thread pointed out that the dvd release of IT chapter 2 should line up with the next dead by daylight chapter. So it could still be IT
---
this is cringy
---
Ghostface is labeled as a chapter now so with that in mind we can assume that only solo survivors are paragraphs
---
There are a few ways. The killer can drop them. On Playstation it's Circle.
---
The player can wiggle free. They can save themselves using the Decisive Strike perk one time.
---
Another player can save them by blinding the killer with a flashlight or firecracker. Or if the killer walks under a pallet another survivor can time it right by throwing the pallet on them. Finally a survivor using the Head On perk can jump out of a locker that a killer is walking near which will cause them to drop the survivor.
---
I played with my friends yesterday and we played against Legion once. I remember him hitting me with his power and then going for another player. I med myself and then healed with a med kit. My friends told me not to heal against Legion as it‚Äôs quite pointless as he injures you with the power again anyways. Is the general annoyance because of this fact that you run pretty much the whole game in injured state?
---
Devs said theyre in their 20s
---
You read it all that fast?
---
...what is your problem?
---
Hag catches many survivors by surprise - she's the most effective killer on PC (66% kill rate), and second most effective on PS4 and Xbox (63% and 64%, respectively).
---
Hex: Ruin is widely considered one of the best killer perks in the game, and she starts with it. If you've unlocked Barbecue &amp; Chilli from Bubba then you're already in a good position with her. I'd suggest pairing those with Iron Grasp and then a final perk of your choice.
---
With Hag, use the start of the match to establish a perimeter around your 3-gen Basement. If the Basement doesn't support a 3-gen, pick a series of hooks within your 3-gen that'll act as your ersatz Basement. When your perimeter is broken, teleport and hit the survivor. 
---
* If they try and kite you away from your perimeter, abandon the chase and replace any traps (if your fourth perk is Sloppy Butcher then the survivor will have to spend time healing, and that's time away from gens).
---
* If they don't kite you, down them and use Iron Grasp to take them to the centre of your 3-gen, or into the "Basement". Replace any traps and see what happens next - if they go for the save then chances are good they'll activate a trap near the "Basement", and if they don't save then it's one survivor less and you've spent the time pressuring the rest and kicking gens rather than sitting on the hook.
---
Hag moves slower than other killers, and thus works best when people come to her. If you don't like playing like a spider in a web, you could consider taking Ruin, Barbecue &amp; Chilli, Third Seal, and Knock Out as a very deliberate "slugging" build. The goal here is to use the teleport hits to Blind survivors, then slug them one by one before finally looping the entire map and putting them all on the hook. It is a high risk strategy, especially if survivors have Adrenaline and/or Unbreakable.
---
Feel free to switch between the two. At any rate, I'd suggest your next killer should be Myers - Play With Your Food is *terrifying* on Bubba, and Save the Best for Last makes it far easier for Hag to chain teleport hits since she'll recover almost as fast as survivors can trigger them.
---
you've posted this like three times and everytime it's cringy
---
Play with your food and Save the Best For Last stacks most likely
---
I decided to watch Otz after hearing about him on Reddit. After catching up with some of his previous streams and videos, I'm glad I did. He just seems like a nice guy and enjoyable to watch also
---
Just do bones...
---
You can also do that through the Xbox app instead of the website
---
Yeah you  know they'll be toxic when they change characters at the last second
---
I suppose if they're removing all mentions of Leatherface being referred to as a Paragraph, then you're probably right. They do say Ghostface is a Chapter in the Spotlight video.

FIXATED
---
I mean it's the killer shooting themselves in the foot if they think targetting and knocking 1 player out of the match asap is actually a viable strat
---
It will stay where he left it. So in other words, he can 99% the meter for all survs and then down them easily
---
I was also debating giving marker's design the oblivious effect (introduced with the gorgon) but felt like then it would be a little bit too killer favored, now I've had a bit to think about I think it would be the best to keep the balance.
---
Hereeeees Johnny!
---
She was mindgaming, you interrupted big brain plays.
---
No more indoor maps please
---
off the hook asap is what I personally want when I play.
---
Farming me off the hook in front of the killer &gt; Flat out DC'ing 2 seconds into a match &gt; crouching behind cover waiting for the killer to go away before unhooking and letting me go into struggle when they check around, find you, and don't go for the unhook
---
screams are different from grunts of pain. maybe calm spirit bypasses it?
---
A killer with stuffed animal monsters is cringy?  Could you expand on that?
---
You beat me to it
---
Big brain vs human pallet
---
The way GFs power works is he enters a stealth mode. In that mode he has no terror radius and no red stain but emits a faint noise of fabric billowing. He can then press his active ability (ps-L2,XB-LT) to stalk. IF he sees you while stalking you the survivor begin building a meter on his screen. When it fills you will get a warning saying your exposed, meaning he can 1 hit down you. 
---
If you break Line of sight from him before he finishes the stalk then after a few seconds you stalk meter will begin going down.
---
As well if you force his power into cooldown by 
---
A. Revealing him by looking it at him before he completes his stalk then after a few secs it will drain.
---
B. Force him to swing taking him out of stalk early which will cause it to begin slowly draining aftera few secs
---
Unlike Michael there is no warning for survivors that he's stalking you other than when your exposed and that skull thing pops up
---
So... is it happening or not?
---
Oblivious would probably work in place of Exposed, or, you could cut the Exposed effect down while adding Oblivious.
---
At that point yeah, I believe. But sounds pretty unusual if you get my drift
---
Yeah. Give it a sort of mindbreaker effect maybe? Where it's constant but persists for a short period afterwards.
---
oh my ... i feel so dumb right now!! i had a complete brain fart and forgot it‚Äôs **calm spirit** that stops screams..
---
oopsie
---
My fellow killer mains, please vow to not facecamp
---
I can't wait to see killers actively running away from Davids üòÇ
---
great now myers has nurses blink
---
Is there a comprehensive list of perks with hidden pros and negative effects that aren't on the perk description?
---
Calm Spirit has that negative effect while on hook, meanwhile I believe AaronPlays showed that Resilience hashiding buffs for healing. 
---
Just wondering. I haven't seen anything online yet like that
---
You've listed all the terrible evils man
---
*sinister oink*
---
I was unaware this was on a ptb, was the chase portion implemented as well? Because that would help prevent the first hook being infinite
---
I despise my friend who introduced every terrible thing this game has to offer, I now know what hell is and I constantly live in it
---
That sounds good, but at that point, I believe to avoid people stacking on a generator, either Exposed or Oblivious should apply if another survivor is also on the same generator.
---
Oblivious more likely because "I got other people to watch for me"
---
I believe what he/she is getting at, is nothing is really scary about a 20 year old dude with a flesh pony on his shoulder. The concept is good, dont get me wrong, but it just doesn't have that fear factor like the others do. Like the fast legion rushing at you with a shit eating grin plastered on their masks, or the doctor with basically the whole front of his face off. A fleshy brony just ain't it
---
Most players are around that rank following a rank reset, if they've had a few games.
---
Run DS and Unbreakable and you'll be begging to be hook farmed
---
Or DS + Deliverance
---
I really hope it's not IT. Even from a supernatural perspective, I don't think it would make any sense.
---
&gt;!that was in the movie, which is inaccurate. In the movie they made the ritual of Chud fail which did not happen in the book. The reason the losers were able to do that in the movie was bc (and this wasn't mentioned either) they were effectively being protected by Maturin. That's part of the reason Pennywise wouldn't eat Beverly in the first movie.her overcoming her fear of her father, Pennywise couldn't kill her with the Deadlights bc of Maturin!&lt;
---
üëÄ
---
The perk was more in reference to two things. 1. The station in dead space 2 / 2. a death where issac is sucked into space and cut in half by a door. Hence the line "no-one can hear you scream, but everyone can see you bleed"
---
I feel like it could be a Shining thing with Doctor Sleep coming soon
---
As much as I would love to have Pennywise it's more likely to be one of his other works, just because we already have a clown.
---
I was going to be the first to escape but then this happened :(
---
Do you mean stuffed animals like toys  or taxidermied animals? One is kinda crap and the other would be cool if done right
---
It was to late :(
---
I think they just disappear
---
Yeah, so I'm assuming we are talking non demo perks so people can have instant level 50 demo then? Because at first i was under the impression people were trying to buy with shards and i was like uhhhh
---
I keep skimming a bit below and continue playing to restock up to 1 mil.
---
I feel like a winner
---
i think they should just be creative and create more unique characters of their own. they wouldn't have to split the profits either
---
I had a Baby Meg (high green ranks, clearly super inexperienced in every chase I had afterward) totally bamboozle me once with stealth perks, I hit her and she just vanished, scratch marks and all. I had no fucking idea where she went and there was only like piece of decent cover in the area.
---
She was lagging a bit (I had good ping to all the other survivors, so I assume it was her) but only in a jerky way, not like rubber banding into invisibility, and I was so confused.
---
Maybe a poor connection means the 'jerking' sort of run doesn't always count as running to the game engine, since the path you're communicating to the Killer is more short hops rather than sprinting? I dunno.
---
I let her go in the end, she kept running into my face while trying to loop and it was sad, she told me she failed every skill check when Spine Chill was going off.
---
I had an idea. This perk works on a token system, so at 3 tokens, it's max speed with oblivious and exposed, 2 tokens it's only exposed, and at 1 it's none of them with a very minor boost. Balanced at all stages of the game.
---
That sounds fair.
---
Every killer should activate spine chill. Even when the spirit is phase walking.
---
Stuffed animals.  Like, demonic toys.
---
rip Insidious killers
---
Then we wouldn't be able to have Killer Klowns from Outer Space, tough choice.
---
I would too lol
---
So the idea isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs just the ponies?  If they were stuffed animal dogs and cats it would be better?
---
The entity is already a poor man's version of Pennywise
---
Spend them my man. The Entity just consumes them after a mil
---
Doesnt really fit in well with the rest of killers, imo taxidermy is that little bit creepier
---
Ok thank you
---
Isaac Clark is the main character of the dead space series, and is a seasoned badass.
---
Like we have two hicks wielding chainsaws? It at least wouldnt use the exact same weapon
---
I would really prefer something other than pennywise. Mostly because I feel he wont get justice in this game. I truly feel he could get his own game (much like Jason did) and be really fleshed out and actually terrifying. In DBD he would be so lukewarm that it would kinda make him lose some of the real horror surrounding him.
---
Now give me something from The Shining. Carrie? Could be perfect.
---
We could definitely get some of the Losers Club as survivors. Bill n Bev or maybe just Bev
---
Head on - locker
---
Get to 1mil and use it to prestige and level back up
---
Derank in advance
---
Have you never seen Silent Night Deadly Night 4?  Krampus?  The original Chuckie?  If done right, killer toys can be really creepy.
---
Mostly yes, and no, randos at high ranks usually don't let that happen
---
i‚Äôm saving them for nancy. that‚Äôs why i was asking if i should keep playing or just wait until tomorrow
---
&gt;!Let's not forget that It/Pennywise/Deadlights are already present in this game in the form of the entity. The entity really feels like a watered down version of It when you think about it. Feeding on Hope/Despair vs Fear. Spider-like qualities. Cosmic being that can semi-twist reality. Etc.!&lt;
---
But what if you have 100ms in the lobby and once the game starts the ping is 300?
---
Carrie?
---
Wraith and Nurse are supposedly lovers or something along those lines.
---
Hmm maybe a doll is kind of creepy but not a plushie toy man.
---
[Well it's not gonna have a map at least](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1134580355913175042/photo/1)
---
They've changed spawn locations enough times already and some of them are pretty well tucked away as it is. Do they have to spawn outside of the map for you people to be satisfied?
---
Thank you, that sounds fun, with Hagg I tend to control the map with placing traps next to objectives, for example hooked person, gen and basemnet. Is it the right way?
---
The BEAT survivors are the ones that know how to play and give you a gg whether they win or lose.
---
**„Ç¥** **^„Ç¥** **„Ç¥** **^„Ç¥**
---
The map is just boats cut in half
---
Who is Stepehn King?
---
Just spend like 25k or something before every game so that you arent losing any i guess
---
the hand is on point
---
Damn that sucks.  If you legitimately escape and have this happen, the killer is just a straight up asshole if they still kill you (and know you were glitching).
---
No one knows, people expect it to be this weekend but BHVR hasn't said a thing about it.
---
Up to you. Either spend a bit (but enough where you can get back to 1mil easily) or wait till tomorrow. I wouldn‚Äôt waste matches without spending any though
---
Please stop teabagging me and messaging me gg ez I'm trying my best to have fun playing clown.
---
On PC it's R by default
---
Fuck noed.
---
All of year 3 was original characters
---
it's easier to m1 as killer than hitting those skillchecks at rank 20 lul
---
Cries in Plag
---
I was gonna guess Susie honestly, she was the shy naive one. Or potentially Wraith.
---
Both had rather extreme mitigating circumstances that essentially forced their hand.
---
Wraith snapped at the mob boss who had been having him murder innocents unknowingly, and Susie did not want to kill - and didn't even stab of her own consent, Julie put the knife into her hands and Frank forced her to stab.
---
Both were essentially normal people in their day to day lives, Ghostface is a sociopath who went out of his way to murder.
---
that‚Äôs what happened to me this last game i was at 986,000 and got like 30k points so i lost half of them
---
It???
---
It‚Äôs usually anywhere from like 12 noon to 2pm iirc. They‚Äôll be available with cells before the stores update to have the DLC
---
With Bill Hader and James McAvoy as survivors.
---
What rank are you and what rank do you usually get?
---
calm spirit counters them
---
I play spirit, and I know people hate me for it, but I can say with honestly that I‚Äôve never tunnelled, camped or ran NOED. 
---
At lower ranks I don‚Äôt run ruin, I use corrupt intervention since I know rank 20s tend to struggle with ruin. I wait until I‚Äôm at green ranks to put ruin in my builds honestly.
---
And most games I don‚Äôt run beads apart from with certain stealth builds. I try to keep the game fair and fun as I can because I know playing against spirit is real hard and I want everyone to enjoy themselves.
---
It also maximises the amount of points I can get from hooks and stuff since I‚Äôll mostly end up getting a couple hooks on each survivor and I use bbq. 
---
I don‚Äôt always follow the rule book, if I catch a 4 man blendette swf group all bringing flashlights, I gotta defend myself.
---
feng you're doing great sweetie!!
---
so when exactly is the dlc dropping? is it like tomorrow midday? is it at midnight tonight? I've never been anticipating a release for this game like this before so dunno how dlc drops work.
---
NA. Maybe because of rank reset everybody wants to cheese?
---
The game has to be balanced around the majority of the playerbase, which is the casual audience. If you make the game to where every single killer, if skilled, can hold their ground against a team of 4 survivors who are very good at the game, this will kill the solo experience, and the majority of the people who just play for fun. You'll have a game where the people who player killers are very good, and the people who are survivors are very good, but this leaves the game only playable to the top 5% or 10% of players, while the majority of the playerbase just gets edged out because they don't use the right perks, addons, or playstyles to be able to be victorious. 
---
I'm happy to lose a small handful of my games against really good players or teams if it means that the game is built in such a way where the other people who play don't always lose.
---
I feel like for the toilet it should‚Äôve been the plague, but this was so funny
---
Your drift? I get not.
---
Trapper: "muthafucker"
---
That's why I yell at friends to not cleanse open field totems, but recently I've become a NOED tracking god
---
I wonder what power they are giving him
---
And he would have less upvotes
---
I think you mistook bone clapper for coxcombed clapper. Survivors can still hear the bell with the bone clapper, it just isn‚Äôt directional.
---
Survivors will complain about your Ruin while running 4 toolboxes and Prove Thyself smh
---
Could be Jack Torrance in a semi-frozen undead state lol.
---
YES!!!!!
---
In short, anything that stuns or blinds the Killer allows the Survivor on their shoulder to get free. There's a decent list of examples in one of the other responses.
---
Another option is body blocking to delay the Killer from getting to a hook long enough that the Survivor can wiggle free, but this is an *advanced technique* that is situational, risky, and can be hard to pull off effectively. You generally can't delay a competent Killer more than a few seconds and they have 16 to get to a hook (more with Iron Grip), so it basically only works if the Killer is already far from a hook and might be cutting it close to get there in time. You're also likely to take a hit, so don't try it unless you're healthy, or *really sure* you can delay long enough and willing to be hooked in your teammate's place (for example, if they're dead on hook and you haven't been hooked yet, this might be worthwhile).
---
To pull it off, you'll want to get in front of the Killer without them seeing you and crouch beneath their POV for as long as possible. When they look down, do a 360 to dodge their hit and if successful, move back to continue delaying them. You can repeat this until they hit you, but don't expect that to take very long.
---
I think i heard 10.99
---
Pennywise please
---
like half of pigs addons are useless and/or detrimental.  
---
If you use it with the tampered timer it's pretty good and you might actually get a head pop
---
Could've also grabbed her if he didn't lunge
---
*me trying to get the win a match with a found item in the trial*
---
Shoulda specified you were using borrowed time, cause now they‚Äôre back on the hook by my hand.
---
Your mistake is their problem, like how a teammate tossing too many pallets is also their mistake, your problem.
---
Wouldnt make sense for it to be pennywise thing is as strong as the entity.
---
just finished stranger things and I do not wanna spoil it for anyone who may wanna get it but after watching it I am even more hyped than I already was and very much looking forward to it
---
#FakeNews
---
Just check his Twitter and he‚Äôs not followed by them. Also checked dead by daylight twitter and they aren‚Äôt following him.
---
And then exit gates powered up with Adrenaline
---
**but then you remember you is runnin that delicious NOED**
---
That's so cool! Would you mind if I take it? Would be a nice such a nice screensaver
---
Keep it up the good work
---
Its wild, and reminds me of stuff like Tim and Eric. But he seems to have a lot of people supporting him so i hope he's doing well
---
No, you will probably see this meme on Reddit more often (mabye)
---
Yes. An update will always be for all platforms unless something goes haywire (it has before).
---
I hope it's not IT only because we already have a clown UNLESS they play into his ability to shapeshift which could be rad as hell. Otherwise I'd love to see something lesser-known come through.
---
They appear to be
---
The Overlook Hotel as a map would be awesome
---
Indeed! Thanks for catching that!
---
Isn't a problem if you don't get found tho
---
That's why he/she mentioned Claudette I guess
---
I just hold crouch and wait for the killer to down me and get some extra points from that.
---
I brought an Ebony for the mori daily on huntress but the survivors were all babies and I didn't have the heart to use it
---
I guess I'm going to be skipping out on the next few DLCs. I don't mind Pennywise but I'm starting to get sick of licensed killers.
---
Yeah for sure, since the IT clown is actually a "Shapeshifter", it would be really cool if it could change into a random survivor to get close and deceive people and then change back quickly and attack. 
---
Other perks and items could be based on mostly on "fear" since that is what the clown feeds on.
---
PLEASE, the shining, carrie, misery, IT omggg yeeess, we are truly being fed this year
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm pointing out. Claudette doesn‚Äôt help with mending.
---
it's both things, I would change the appearance of the character and his backstory a bit.
---
Even if it's clichey i would go with a more used looks, even a Gepetto look would fit him or something that made him look like a character out of a circus, or a creepy old woman.
---
about the horses, I think there is no explanation on why he does only horses and why he suddenly has a sexual fetish with them. So maybe changing it to him being a dollmaker before would make more sense. and being a dollmaker he would be more fitting attacking children and using the toys to lure them. and not just doing horses, but dolls, horses, and specially Teddy bears, since they are the most popular plushies. or if you want only horses he should have a reason as to why only horses, specially one that goes beyond "is all he knew how to do", maybe a frustrated jockey, or someone who has a grudge against a horse trader/horses or growing among horses thinking they were his friends. something like that.
---
About the sexual part, I would say that you skipped that, of course what you say could work, specially if he made a doll resembling her first victim, but if we go with what is more common, he would have to share likings with Fred.
---
Looks like the survivor expected you to read the survivors handbook for killers. Honestly man this game is toxic from both sides. you have face camping killers and asshole survivors. Just do what you need to do to win. I let two survivors escape my last game as trapper because I downed them all within two minutes and their other two teammates disconnected. Other matches I hook people look around till they get unhooked and then go after the first person I see. You will tunnel people down, but really its just salty words from a player you might never fight again.
---
True... I feel like I'm the only one who wants Jack Torrance instead of Pennywise...
---
Normally 11am est. ‚Äúeastern standard time‚Äù  it will drop on all platforms and it‚Äôs scheduled for tomorrow the 17th of September. This information was provided from the devs at BhVR Interactive. Can‚Äôt wait!
---
I like how pigs version of ‚Äútoxic add ons‚Äù is *you might get a kill* but with most the other killers it‚Äôs like, dc.
---
I rarely get 4ks when I win with ease for the sole reason being guilt that some rookies had a bad start because they ran into me, so I proceed to **YEET THAT BABY DWEET ACROSS THE MAP INTO THE HATCH AND CELEBRATE MY HOOP SKILLS IN THE PROCESS**
---
I wish I didn‚Äôt do this as much because I run into too many future gohan+Trunks teams in low ranks.
---
P.S.
---
Future gohan+Trunks teams refers to how at least one of the suckers is gonna get away no matter what I, androids 18 and 17, do.
---
Whoever dc for any reasons except emergencies are jerks
---
I'm always game for new content. As much as I'd like to see original killers/survivors. Stranger Things is a good fit for DbD and so far from the early looks the content looks strong! (Also ST is really awesome!)
---
Scoops. Scoops Ahoy
---
Yupper and if you close the hatch if there is only one survivor left you can‚Äôt open the gate...

No hooks can be sabotaged or removed because he'll flex tape them back
---
I'm from EU. I honestly believe there is a serious issue with sweaty tryhards here, there is no other explanation
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d53oda/do_you_think_that_survivors_should_have_an_option/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not if BHVR buys the license and then says the entity is stronger. Problem solved.
---
So maybe something like Scabby from
---
Fallout 4...
---
Don't have a real reason if I'm honest. I just like free stuff like every other person.
---
So tunneling is when you focus on one survive after they get unhooked, needless to say that survivers hate it when a killer "tunnels" them, but you're not bound by any made up rule of honer, you can play the game however you want to and enjoy your time
---
"PHIL! YOU MAKE ME ANGRY, PHIL!!!! YO YO COULDA JUST USED ONEATHEESE, PHIL!!!"

**i, trapper, will allow no harm to befall OP.**

*Worst killer of the game* OP!!1!!11!
---
I asked this elsewhere and the response was that Legion got nerfed into the ground, so that he moves slower in Frenzy, Frenzy charges slow, he vaults slower, a missed attack knocks him out of his power, stun when out of the power is the longest in the game, his power can‚Äôt be used to actually down anyone, and his power is boring. He slows the game down in the most boring way possible.
---
So hyped for the Cujo DLC
---
It  BEGINS!!!
---
How did the killer whiff 3 times???
---
What's for dinner tonight hun.
---
And one of her purples pretty much just cucks you, so yeah..  
---
I would appreciate buffs instead of more nerfs, thx BHVR :D
---
Oh God the licensing for that would be expensive.
---
I mean.. I really don't get it why people do that. Ruin just trains you to hit great skillchecks more often so when get cleansed you will already be good enough to hit them more frequently which leads to faster gens..
---
Even if I'm a dummy and hit great ones only when ruin is active but whatever
---
Got a little carried away. Tl;Dr: The Doctor is fun. Centers around making Survivors give away their position, making it hard to hide, even across the map.
---
I've been enjoying The Doctor a bunch. Played a few matches last night, and in about half of them I got all 4 survivors, in the rest I got at least 2 every match.
---
His Power changes to "Treatment mode" which activates a radius equal to his Terror Radius that passively accrues Insanity on Survivors, or you can "attack" in "Treatment mode" which sends out a charged burst that adds a bunch all at once. Which leads to Madness:
---
*  At Tier 1 of Madness, the Survivor will scream, and their aura will appear on your screen (the same way a generator would). Useful in places where there are alot of corners and stuff, because Madness accrues by just being in the radius, not LoS.
---
* At Tier 2, the Survivors are afflicted with hallucinations. Every so often an Illusion of The Doctor will appear near them, which could cause them to run, or mess up a skill check or something. I believe you can also see the hallucination, which tips you of to where they are.
---
* At Tier 3, the Survivors begin to scream periodically, constantly tipping you off to their location. Also in this tier, you see an aura on your screen of the hallucination. In Tier 3, Survivors can't do much of anything until they "snap out of it". That means no healing, no repairing, no sabotaging, no search chests, no cleansing totems, no items.
---
I believe also while afflicted by Madness, they get false skill checks, and trying to complete them acts as a fail, regardless whether or not they succeed (correct me if I'm wrong. I just know late into matches, *alot* of generators are blowing up).
---
So provided you use your Treatment mode effecitvely, you'll be getting lots of visual and audio clues as to where the Survivors are, even from across the map provided you afflicted them first.
---
oof yeah. Might be worth deranking out of purple then
---
They should just rework the perk and make the stacks a bonus like bbq
---
Rank reset occured frequently a d often survivors just depip/won't pip to stay in low ranks even if they should be higher
---
I just want original chapters, not more licensed ones
---
Between noon and 2 pm usually.
---
Tim Curry skin or riot.
---
Ah someone else who has the original Buck Brand Hunting Knife! Got the same one I bought back before screamed dumped out.
---
*sad Bubba noises*
---
I use this when I'm trying to farm as a backup for toxic swf.
---
It is usually between 9 am and 11 am MST
---
They called the Ash dlc a chapter on their forums, and never referred to it as a paragraph. It really seems like they've just retired the term paragraph and are sticking to calling all dlc Chapters
---
Oh that‚Äôs so mean
---
Killer's PC is a potato, or his connection isn't good enough. Still, it's your ping, his is always around 0ms.
---
oy vey nea killer joke haha xd
---
Hahahaha what? I think this is the more 50/50, it can get even if more towards memes.
---
Just look it up how many people daily cry about camping, x perk (usually noed) and x killer. They cry also to legion, the worst killer ever
---
They are pretty much even but if you just look up to things that proves your point and ignore the rest ofc you are gonna think that. FYI it's a huge fallacy
---
He's like a highschooler or something
---
high rank shirtless david joins the lobby
---
Upvote earned
---
Leave them on the hook and do gens.
---
I was really disappointed when they just didn't explain how the Entity got its hands on the Demogorgon. They didn't even try.
---
For the name he could be the deadlights? Cuz in the Stephen king book he is the deadlights, and pennywise is just the form he takes.
---
Holy Hell, I wish they destroyed me
---
I deadass thought it was a forehead flower.
---
"i was to busy hiding in a bush"
---
I changed my mind.
---
New Killer: The Caretaker
---
New Survivor: Wendy Torrance
---
New Map: The Overlook Hotel
---
Why did somebody downvote you
---
Jack Torrance as killer and Wendy as survivor. That would be awesome!
---
*Wendy? Darling? Light, of my life. I'm not gonna hurt ya. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said, I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just going to bash your brains in.*
---
I honestly don't want it to be Pennywise because Pennywise is already a better, more powerful cosmic being than the Entity.
---
wait oh fuck. I didnt realize he played anything but dbd lol.
---
Same, its gonna be a long wait until the start of oktober, especially with borderlands 3 also on my list
---
They said killers would be humanoid. No one ever said human lol
---
save the best for last is so good easily one of my favorite perks in the entire game
---
Abusable. Tried in the past, move on
---
where's bing bong man is he cloaked or something?
---
Oooo, Carrie would be amazing. Forgot all about her as a possibility.
---
Hillbilly came before leatherface. Legion came before ghostface. Clown comes before pennywise?
---
Are you thinking of something like Play with your food? Because that wasn't the case, I was the obsession because of DS not killer perks.
---
Why'd the game get taken off the Nintendo eShop?
---
Legion is a weak Killer, but their power makes them extremely difficult to escape during a chase, then forces you to waste significant time mending. There's not a lot of counter-play; being unable to escape a chase can feel pretty unfair, and mending is boring. Thus they can be pretty annoying and unfun to play against, even though you have a good chance of escaping against them unless the player is really good. This is especially true for some Survivors who find all the "hold M1" parts of the game (repairing, healing, etc.) boring, and who only play for evading/looping in chases... which they can't really do against Legion, while they're forced to spend a lot more time holding M1.
---
Also, a lot of Survivors don't play Killer or don't own Legion and don't know exactly how their power works to realize it's balanced or even pretty weak, they just know it *feels* unfair to play against. Plus for those in double digit ranks, the game is Killer-weighted, so even a weak Killer can feel pretty devastating when you can't escape them.
---
Yo be honest sometimes survivors are just soo bad you can't use the mori or kill them as quick, i never find any fun as a killer having survivors score 2k points.
---
&gt; The Overlook Hotel
---
Damn i need a Spooky hotel map With some actual furnishing!
---
Me too but now I‚Äôm bummed we got the lab instead of the mall :(
---
I would love an IT chapter.  Lots of interesting ways they could handle Pennywise‚Äôs power.  I feel like they would maybe do double survivor again just cause there‚Äôs so many of the Losers, so I‚Äôd choose Bev and Bill.
---
There's some real potential in it, especially in the origin of the Entity, its real intentions and ESPECIALLY in it's biology. They were hinting during the Hallowed Blight event that the Entity was a biological thing which means it likely has had a beginning and came from somewhere.
---
He voiced Dwight in [Camped By Daylight.](https://youtu.be/EKyq_iAjulE)
---
Doubtful. The "meta" is that you shouldn't heal in general. The math supports this. Most "serious" players spend large portions of most matches injured anyway. Though, those probably aren't the ones complaining about Legion, because those players probably understand Legion is pretty weak.
---
Good deeds dont go unrewarded, I'm not participating, give it to someone who really wants it, and keep being cool
---
Cant grab no more
---
in the name of the pope you are hereby sentence to Crucifixion
---
Please, read again
---
The mall would have been cool but It prob could not be the same since I‚Äôd think they would need permission to list the correct store names and shit so that is prob why they went with the lab
---
Rank 20 be like that sometimes.
---
it is very arguable but is it tho?! there is no way detect if you are phasing or not it is hit or miss 50/50 chance not mindgaming
---
I mean using them and getting shit rounds is still better than never using them at all. I just prestiged my myers that had 8 blood partys and 13 soups in his inventory because I forgot that prestiging also resets your add ons/offerings and not just your perks
---
Im pretty sure the type of squad that would convey this message would be a blendette squad.

And then try and justify it after you kill them
---
What would his abilities be? I imagine survivors being frozen in terror as he takes an axe to pallets.
---
Killer name: The It
---
Chucky confirmed...
---
I like to call them single digit ranks vs double digit ranks. It's less confusing than high/low (where no one can agree which is which), and I find trying to narrow it down more than that isn't very useful. Especially since you'll routinely be playing with people up to 5 ranks above/below you anyway.
---
Welcome to dead by daylight camping killers and laggy hitboxes
---
u/CollinTheMed bad u/CollinTheMed bad
---
Stalk meter doesnt go down in any scenario, it only goes away if he downs you
---
That's basically what happens to me during every single fucking rank reset, it is so bad. I'm relatively good at this game,  one of few I'm good at all lol so when people just suck or literally do NOTHING I get so annoyed. I don't care if someone isn't good, as long as they try. But people refuse to and have of them are pretend noobs who camp the hatch lol.
---
I came here to ask the same damn question lol
---
You know I‚Äôve been thinking about the mall as a map, but it never occurred to me that they would have to put the store names. I wonder if there could be a workaround on that?? Interesting.
---
New killer is Cathy Bates, new survivor is wheelchair bound writer
---
Everyone has been hoping for such am ability for quite some time. It would be awesome on paper but would be super susceptible to swf. Swf already poses balancing problems, and this would be the worst of it.
---
Is this actually recent? I thought they were following him before.
---
Fair enough :) you‚Äôre awesome too!
---
I do my research when I costume. üòâ
---
Lol ok
---
just started watching this rn. XD
---
You should bem paying atention but still Nice drawing
---
shit......................
---
You should've ben paying atention but still Nice drawing

Legion is weak, which is likely to be pretty frustrating as a new Killer. No idea why you think they're "versatile"‚ÄîI'd say they're a one trick pony whose one trick isn't that great, and otherwise a basic M1 Killer. Though he does have one of the best perks in the game (Discordance). Ghost Face is really strong, but he has some weaknesses that really punish you if you make any mistakes... which is likely to be pretty frustrating as a new Killer.
---
I'd recommend Hillbilly for new Killers, or Michael if you don't like Hillbilly. Granted, as a Michael main I'm a bit biased, but I started out as a Huntress main and now sort of co-main Spirit, and I've played most of the other Killers including Legion to have at least a basic feel for them. Hillbilly and Michael are both strong and both easy to play, but also have enough of a learning curve to keep them from being boring, at least for awhile (no matter who you main initially, you'll eventually master them and want to move on to something else). In the case of Michael, because he works a bit differently depending which of 3 tiers his power is at and he has some interesting add-ons, he's also one of the most versatile Killers (with probably only Hag offering more playstyle options).
---
It should  be the same as BBQ in that it does more than give BP, like on top of giving BO, ust add, ‚Äúwhen unhooking a survivor, see the killer‚Äôs aura for x seconds‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt think SWFs are a bad thing, I just don‚Äôt personally like going against them. I mean, SWF exists to be used after all. I don‚Äôt mind anything in the game as long as it doesn‚Äôt break any rules.
---
Killer camping me? Don‚Äôt mind, but I‚Äôll just take the fast way out if it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a little too afraid of losing a hook victim so I can play another match faster (tbh it‚Äôs kind of beneficial to let me unhook because then if they come back as I‚Äôm being unhooked and my buddy isn‚Äôt running borrowed time he can re-hook me, a strategy I don‚Äôt mind going against and a strategy I myself use).
---
1. So how does Sole Survivor interact with Object of Obsession? Is there a way to see the killer's aura without them seeing yours using these two perks?
---
2. How does Detective's Hunch work with maps? Do you have to use the maps while Hunch is active or is it all automatically carried over to the map when it pops?
---

---
You must be a masochist. 4 stacks of this would be cancer.
---
Pay attention in class. Now excuse me while i continue to browse reddit in class instead of paying attention.
---
Wait... No0b3 doesn't look like a cute Nea?
---
I hope you know what you've done.
---
That‚Äôs true, however No Mither isn‚Äôt really aggressive nor helpful for the team so it‚Äôs not a far stretch to change WGLF. IMO.
---
Because its a matter of the character being annoying bs that isn't fun to play against, not strength. With nurse, as the survivor you always have something you can do to improve your chances. Break LOS, double back, get into a locker, stand on multi-level terrain, use her charging sounds, etc.
---
Meanwhile a spirit stands still and now you have no information whatsoever, the correct action is entirely a cointoss.
---
That jawline can fucking kill
---
Which addons are detrimental? I‚Äôve been running her recently and wanted to play her better.
---
Reddit kept telling me my comment failed and to try again. I am sorry for the swarm of the damn comment :/... gonna go delete em now if it doesn‚Äôt crap itself like earlier
---
"Swiggity swooty."
---
1) If you end up being the last Survivor alive with both Perks, you will basically be granted Wall-Hacks to spy on the Killer with. Situational, but still cool.
---
2) Anything logged by Detectives Hunch is immediately added onto your Map
---
The entity, not even once
---
1. Exactly the way it sounds, so yes. After enough of your teammates have died.
---
AFAIK, the chapter is set outside of small bug fixes and such. They seemed content with perks and the killer as far as function so we jut have to wait for the final notes tomorrow.
---
Yesterday I played against a leather face who seemed like your average baby killer.  The only problem was that all of my teammates were worse.
---
See, he had bbq and chili, because of course he fucking does.  But my team apparently had no clue about the perk's existence. So after someone got hooked, someone else went down soon after (not me, though, because I went into a locker every time before he hooked someone).
---
Anyway, we get down to 1 gen left and 2 dead.  I've never been hooked yet.  I had just pulled my other teammate off and finished that 2nd to last gen.. then bubba finally found me.  I go down, and before I'm even put on my first hook, *the guy I had just saved a minute ago opened the fucking hatch with a key and left me to die.*  
---
I was fucking enraged, man.  Like, *you piece of shit.  You had a key and knew where the hatch was and couldn't be bothered to try to save me?  What. The. Fuck.*
---
Same here
---
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes
---
Well trust me when i see a camping wraith all i can do is press y to shame
---
Yep you‚Äôre right it was under a different tap for some reason. Thanks for the correction.
---
It‚Äôs a terrible realization when you find out that you‚Äôve been the fake news all along üíî
---
It'll be grown up Bev and Bill perhaps?
---
Pennywise shape-shifting would be cool
---
Well I don‚Äôt have many dlc the most I have is from birthday money so I got ghostface micheal and leatherface and it‚Äôs my favorite killer his music everything about him is so interesting to me
---
Hag is human she's just been changed by the entity
---
There aren‚Äôt any ghost face perks up there?
---
Ohhh! Please be Jack and Wendy Torrence!!
---
Aww I was hoping it would of been Joey Salads
---
I want it cause I‚Äôm a fan of the show and want to be able to play the characters! I don‚Äôt have the money at the moment to buy it myself so otherwise i‚Äôll have to wait a bit to get it.
---
The entity appreciates it.
---
This is literally the exact reason why I have 38 Pink Maps.
---
With Inner Strenght (this is the one that heals after cleansing a totem?) nearly out, people are going to pay more attention to totems, so noed its going to be less and less frecuent...
---
Yeah. They don't count as basic attacks.
---
It's not that survivors are op, it's just that killers like Wraith and Legion have little to nothing going for them when it comes to playing in high ranks. Legion at least has an easy first hit and has a lot of use with Thanatophobia, but Wraith is an M1 killer with an outdated and underwhelming base kit.
---
üòò
---
100% agree. I've been playing a lot of survivor to level my P3 Ghostface back up because every time I play Plague 2 out of 4 players DC and I have to the other two go, and without survive cakes I get like 14k BP which is enough for maybe half a level now. I'd run WGLF but I'm really really bad in chases and usually fuck up the unhooks so I get nothing.
---
omg so sorry for the spam. reddit said "something went wrong" everytime i would click on send so i clicked a few times.
---
As soon as the gates are open the killer can see your aura in the exit gate. The killer cannot see them if you leave the exit gate or while you are opening the gate.
---
Watched and can confirm, both dudes. The right one is gay, whereas the one on the left isn't.
---
I can‚Äôt, for the love of any god known to man, get a green daily ritual.
---
The killer will only see your aura is you are standing in the gate after the door has been opened. If you leave the gate or you are opening the gate the killer cannot see your aura
---
Lol if I have a daily I'm using brown addons. And of course if I have decent meta perks I'll use them.
---
No fuck the car. What about my good boy Cujo?
---
As a survivor, if a killer decides he wants you dead, there's very little you can do ‚Äî your game is just over. You don't even need to make a mistake. When I play killer, I just have fun and rack up 40k bloodpoints every match. As survivor, I spend the whole match running, eventually get camped and get to the end screen with like 5000 blood points.
---
Fortnite has surpassed a lot of games in that sense imo. Partnering with the nfl and nba is probably their biggest accomplishment that shows how much people would jump at the chance to get with them. The borderlands thing they did was pretty interesting too.
---
Does anyone even use DVDs anymore?
---
Really? lmao I haven't been on the PTB.
---
edit: deleted my double post. Reddit error 500 and all that
---
The issue with that is that 90 percent of the time when you vault through a window, the killer hits you from a mile away.
---
Really I was playing last night and if you didn't continue it 
---
It seemed to slowly go down
---
I really don‚Äôt though, because this is eüÖ±Ô∏èic
---
Console
---
I never trust farming killers because of that :p
---
And now we wait for Paulie to make a video
---
Well I think if it's the clown from IT, it makes perfect sense since IT chapter two just came out and it's doing well. Even if it's not, I'm all up for whatever BHVR decides.
---
Every other mindgame is a chance though, if I moonwalk backwards predicting you‚Äôre gonna jump the window, there‚Äôs a 50/50 chance I‚Äôm right or wrong. A mindgame isn‚Äôt outsmarting your opponent, it‚Äôs making the attempt to. Standing still to pretend you‚Äôre phasing is the same principle.
---
Jesus, not another indoor map.

I see I‚Äôm not the only one suffering from reddit comment problems
---
Ty for the work and effort, it‚Äôs nice to see someone who puts the extra work into the fine details such as that! It looks great and you don‚Äôt look like a tunneling or camping ghost face!
---
I never trust farming killers because of that. I‚Äôm paranoid haha
---
I never trust farming killers because of that. I‚Äôm paranoid haha.
---
I‚Äôd like to mention that they next killer is mean to be released in December, the same month that IT: Chapter 2 is released on DVD.
---
Goodbye Jojo!
---
Yup I was the devil ghostface!
---
Oh okay
---
So its already possible to have all 5 totems lit, and given that hex perk, you can get up to a max of 60% stun recovery speed, and enduring already can reduce it by 50%. So problem there.
---
As well as that flat speed bonus, that's just absurd. There needs to be more of a requirement, otherwise that just turns every killer into the old cloaked wraith, and can you imagine that on a Billy? As if he couldn't cross the map fast enough already...
---
Yup yup I was the ghostface! Lol
---
All you need is the hidden blade, and you are set other than that great work on this masterpiece
---
The new shirtless Myers meme.
---
Yeet
---
That doesn't matter. While yes, licensed characters are nice for the fans of said characters, it isn't for others. I'm hyped for tomorrow, because I love Stranger Things. But other people aren't.
---
Bad
---
The "28 stab wounds" meme has been used in conjunction with Legion (quite often in fact), with this exact image, sometimes expanded to include the other parties in the conversation.
---
It hasn't been used with the exact text that you used, to my knowledge.
---
Why does everyone hate Legion?
---
Ye, except the guy, whom you forced to DC was a shitty killer with crap perks. GJ creating another spirit main. It's a vicious circle.
---
EU too. I guess you were unlucky
---
i don‚Äôt understand people who say gg ez and things like that. dude even if i‚Äôm pissed off to oblivion screaming at my screen, ill say gg and leave
---
It was not Maturin during the second confrontation.
---
If a huntress is running iridescent they‚Äôre gonna try to hit you with the hatchet no matter what, so you loop them, and when they try to throw at the pallet, don‚Äôt drop the pallet. If they‚Äôre adamant about the one hit you can loop them forever
---
So, year 4 must just be licensed characters then?
---
Is it just me, or is there an abnormally large amount of double posts in this thread?
---
Have you have played against Legion?
---
how I feel when people shit talk me for maining and cosplaying legion
---
Have you ever played against Legion?
---
Well....that has to be ironed out a little more. what about those who manage to do something like 3 gens all by themselves and everyone else is getting chased or on a hook? How's that fair to the other survivors? That's not very team centric.  And, what about those who don't do gens at all? With BBQ it's a much more easier said and done thing. the killer just has to hook the survivor and he gets the token. while as with gens, there's so many more things to account for. I agree something like that would be nice...but, I don't think wglf is the perk for that. If they were going to do something like that it would have to be an all new perk. And they'd have to work around the variables as well.
---

Thanks for the giveaway. I want the DLC because of the new characters and perks, simple as that. I'm really looking forward to experimenting with them, especially Nancy.
---
Stephen King has done a lot more than It. Hopefully it's from something else.
---
Why yes, chief, I believe that was the joke.
---
This guy has never clapped cheeks.
---
Aw man, I didn't know I needed this.
---
Dead Space 1 had one of the best athmospheres I have played in, it was so oppressive and terryfing.
---
I'd love to see a necromorph as the killer (The Hunter specifically), but one of the main features of the necros is that they could be anywhere due to the vent systems, and we have enough teleporting killers already.
---
i meannnn sometimes it's a good idea to cleanse but if you can loop the plague it's best not to cleanse. More often than not, cleansing leads to a snowball game. Really think long and hard before you decide to cleanse, and also think about the location where you cleanse. Right near a chase where there are 2 important gens is not the best place to cleanse
---
That is quite interesting.
---
You can‚Äôt earn BP in KYF though. You can while using a splinter so there‚Äôs still a bit of an upside. KYF would just be for fun
---
Please stop spamming this

Dude can you please stop reposting your posts again and again?
---
When‚Äôs the release time in UK
---
This happened to me with Freddy it's so stupid.
---
Looks like you were lagging, so it could‚Äôve been due to that. That‚Äôs happened to me before in the past.
---
Something like that would be nice in my opinion. So many games i'm in, people don't even try to do objectives because of how much getting unhooks reward you. A lot of people just hide around the area someone is getting chased and wait to unhook. Sometimes it even feels like a fight to get the unhooks (which you need if you want to rank up consistently).
---
To reward people better for doing objectives, seems like a good idea to me, the only fear then, is people might focus too much on that and let their teammates die? Its a tough call. 
---
I think maybe make a new perk for it, and reduce the wglf bloodpoint gain, but give it an added benefit? Like the way bbq gives sight on people.
---
I dunno, i'm an idiot just rambling
---
She is pretty cool good job!
---
Me sees their are multiple killers :)
---
Scroll down to see legions
---
):
---
The same ones that say: "not a lagswitch just have a bad connection lol"
---
I feel the frustration in this post deep in my **bones**. Preach.
---
Oh my god, Cujo confirmed as new killer.
---
&gt;Hanzo
---
&gt;Ramirez
---
They haven‚Äôt partnered with the NBA yet, I don‚Äôt think. They just did something with Michael Jordan‚Äôs Jordans. I hope they do something with the NHL, too, but in terms of popularity order, NBA would definitely be next, then MLB, and then the NHL. 
---
The whole community got jebaited with some IT crossover as there were red balloons all over the map, but once the movie released, nothing came about.
---
Omg Minecraft enderman would be the best killer ever
---
I'll try and come up with one for them. Some of them are hard to think of :(
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
If you still complain about Legion these days, its kinda sad. He's so pathetic now, his deep wound thing is at best, a little time waste, or a free first hit, and at worst, completely useless. Theres no reason to mend anymore, when you're in any danger. Soon as you're in his terror radius it stops, and him hitting you multiple times doesn't lower it. Legion is, without a doubt, the worst killer in the game right now, if you ask me.
---
I was shocked to see Otzdarva Turning Trapper into a goddamn threat, I mean I only managed to trap 2 traps in the whole time I played that dude, I was getting bullied, feels bad man.
---
After messing up on a ruin skill check why do players get off the gen for a second? I don't mean blowing and exploding the generator, I mean when you hit what would normally be a 'good' skill check and the gen progress goes down. Any reason to this?
---
take my upvote! These are super cool.
---
3 or 4 flashlights? That's an easy match! They won't be doing anything because the'll follow me around and I'll bait the pick up and down them all.    
---
3 or 4 toolboxes/ insta heal medkits and a key? That's an avengers level threat.
---
Yeah I'm sick of games shoving in whatever is over-hyping right now. There's so many under-rated horror characters that would go perfectly and make sense in the game but they'd rather go for the money grab option that doesn't make sense to the game.
---
upvote for meg running in the back
---
Cant a man make a meme without someone taking it this seriously
---
Agreed :/
---
What map and location were they even standing at to where you couldn't reach them? I'm curious.
---
i want it because im obsessed with stranger things and this damn game but im broke easy explaination
---
I personally don‚Äôt want It as a killer. He seems overhyped to me.
---
New totem perk
---
Flex: Seal
---
But the official dead by daylight account is following him
---
The gen wont progress when its sparking but it can still trigger another skillcheck, regressing it even further.
---
Yeah the lore definitely makes things messy, but even gameplay-wise I can‚Äôt see him working. Would they just keep him as a clown, or would he take the form of a bunch of different things? I hope they don‚Äôt try to force an IT chapter just because of the movie‚Äôs popularity, if we got a Stephen King chapter I‚Äôd much rather it be The Shining.
---
thanks i was doing the Trapper too but it got corrupted since i saved in the wrong format lol. im thinking about doing a couple more a few of my favorire killers.
---
Oh boy, it was one of the farm maps and they found an area on one of the machine things where they could overlap each other and not be reached
---
I wish I was as good as you
---
Not if the meme is seemingly making a statement that is honestly so very, very far from the truth.
---
this is a rough estimate and not exact
---
Nope. Cause its the internet, and I like to talk about balance. Im not saying he does, im just saying in general. Legions shit tier now.
---
Yeah, I mentioned towards the end that mechanics-wise, he just doesn't work in a limited game like DBD.
---
We're about to float too ... soon
---
oh my god this is everything op THANK YOU
---
he‚Äôs pretty annoying but if you just don‚Äôt heal his power is useless and you can loop him like other m1 killers
---
They don‚Äôt want to run the risk of getting another skill check. If you mess up a ruin skill check the gen regresses so if you were to keep working on it while it‚Äôs ‚Äúregressing,‚Äù there‚Äôs a chance a ruin skill check will come up in that period causing the gen to regress even more. If they get off the gen and wait, then they can go back and start working on it again without worrying about another skill check in that regression period.
---
Eventually you have to cleanse, because you become broken and spread it to everything you touch causing the rest of the lobby to have the same problem. Cleanse responsibly, and also learn to dodge her range hits as they honestly aren‚Äôt that hard. It‚Äôs better to have the ability to take 2 hits then cause your lobby to be down 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 because of you doing her job for her.
---
Does it come out a certain time or as soon as it turns 12am?
---
I've been playing with my friend who is relatively new to the game having a lot of fun making memes out of some of our games, just a thing I saig...
---
&gt;!not really, the book ending is pretty fucking stupid too!&lt;
---
From my understanding, you‚Äôre better off being exposed and risk getting hit once, than giving her the damage spit that will screw over everyone in the team as well. Especially when you consider that you‚Äôll more than likely get gunked up again within a minute or two. If your entire team has been gunked and you cleanse, the plague goes from one hitting them with melee to having a fire hose of instant death.
---
Its probably gonna be at 11 am est like the last 5 chapters
---
Good luck to everyone!
---
I want the DLC, not only because I enjoy the show and the characters in it, but because I really wanna try out each one of the characters added. The only DLC I ever bought for this game was Legion, and that was, because I really liked how he played. If I win this giveaway, I will indirectly be supporting the game and the community, since it will expand my interest and motivation on the game and make me want to play for a longer time.
---
Do your worst, I have already won.
---
But a meme is not supposed to be true
---
Probably to prevent doing just that I would assume.
---
Around 11am for you
---
Look I only have like 80 flashlights, better to not risk running out by never using them.
---
It is a popular phrase so it seems like something like that would happen a lot.
---
You can swing over from the vault and reach them
---
Yeah I think it is just I find his power and counterplay uninteresting. All legions I go against seem to play kind of the same way.
---
Awesome thanks for the info!
---
It's easy, but clown is not fun to play as or against. He's just an awful killer all around
---
Dude this is great!
---
Thanks bro this actually helps
---
Look dude if you wana look for it cool if you don't its ok. It's not a court room just a game
---
hot
---
Will dedicated servers help?
---
aight but then the killer could just circle around the hook rather than just stare
---
Not when you trash can into this :(
---
"A perk for making up all the times you didn't run into my traps despite using the loops they were placed at."
---
I was genuinely about to match you and do a second giveaway but idk if I will if that's how it's received in this community 
---
Not sure why people would downvote...maybe so less people see it to increase their chances? Either way it's really discouraging I'm sure
---
Ffs, do gens. Killer is already punished by rank decrease and 0 map pressure (fast gens).

That‚Äôs what I said I did, but their hit boxes disappeared or merged to become nothing, I was on top of the little hay next to the thing you can vault over on the harvester and they were hovering over the hay/tire area next to it on the ground even if I swung at them from that spot it didn‚Äôt hit, and not if I did it from the ground either, they were like half overlapping each other at the shoulders and when Claud moved a little further away from Dwight I was able to hit her
---
but thats illegal
---
Patrolling isn‚Äôt camping,
---
for me its 8am PST on the 17th to coincide with releases of previous dlc releases

How about a truck from maximum overdrive
---
I laughed way too hard at this. For me, whenever the killer starts conveniently lagging nothing funny happens and I usually just teleport to the hook while screaming 100x in the same second.

I kill the sandbagger first! But I do knock the unhooked survivor down typically to give myself a little more time. Tbh, when survivors do this in front of me...I feel a very deep urge to slice b!@%$&amp;\* up. Respect the killer. But, yeh that's mostly on the survivor for fucking his teammates.

How are the dedicated servers? I've been away from the game for several months now and have not played or kept up with news. I am about to start playing whenever this new update drops.
---
Oh wow. Totally unintentional.
---
No, I mean you can swing from where you drop down and gain momentum to reach the spot theyre in

This is rather simple. Winning the match with Clown isn't.

I actually think Doc was tortured along with Tapper et al. I think they aid in a stream he didn‚Äôt voluntarily put himself in the eye-opener headgear. 
---
My bet is when he was human he thought he was doing it For Science, But this is pure sadism so he was likely less in. Oats. Or he really went a bit bonkers and needed a bit more encouragement to get the point.
---
God dammit.
---
Or at least make is so you get a stack even if you don't hook save someone. I can go several matches and not be able to save anyone, so no stacks for me.
---
I couldn't resist LOL
---
True needs a buff
---
I‚Äôve only had nice dreams from this game, but if it‚Äôs an issue them stop playing for a while, it might help to talk to people about it if it continues
---
Are you insane?
---
There are people that already do that, so what‚Äôs the difference?
---
lol
---
11 original characters, 6 licensed. Why do some of you guys act like those numbers are flipped ?
---
Doesnt matter wich one
---
And also the next chapter will come without a new map, so most likely it's going to be a standalone licensed killer.
---
Thanks, fortune cookie.
---
thats why he is considered "The Horror Master"
---
Makes sense.
---
The obsession switching mechanic is meant to protect against the obsession getting tunneled the entire game.
---
I‚Äôm kinda hoping for Jack from The Shining
---
This looks badass, you nailed it!
---
i haven't noticed any
---
And tells the killer exactly where you are, and that you‚Äôre hopping in lockers, also Iron Maiden at tier 3 can open lockers fast as fuck
---
Dude just getting the achievement though is impressive
---
Call me a criminal. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And as per usual, 0 gennies done

I thought he said he was ending these? Neat tho.

Did u throw ur controller away ?

Apparently he changed his mind. He released a video about a month ago stating he's bringing it and another series back.
---
Regular lag is different then lag switching. One of the main ways to tell is this you can't perform any actions, like you start repairing a gen but it doesn't progress. Also, If the killer hits you twice, then magically appears next to you, Most likely a lag switch.
---
I dropped it because of how hard I started laughing.
---
&gt;the rat sludge monster from s3.
---
Its an Oblex.
---
Ok :D
---
I‚Äôm guessing you meant something different than I thought and I don‚Äôt feel like explaining it or trying to figure out what you meant lol
---
I can't find it either. I was going to pre-order as well. It's on on the coming soon either.
---
There's no point to tunneling the obsession if they had DS unless you had Remember Me or something or were mad you got DS'd. People can still tunnel if they get DS'd.
---
[Me](https://pics.me.me/sitting-lam-because-stand-you-niggas-i-cannot-43695738.png) when I see people put their TV on... when killers camp the hook
---
I hope they don't add Pennywise. It wouldn't make sense as from description of both in lore and books they are pretty much the same species. One Entity wouldn't be slave to another.
---
Die
---
This is actually the only game I play that my girlfriend likes to watch me on.
---
The Demogorgon is only going to cost 1 million blood points?
---
The devs need to Buff the  weak killers nothing bad can happen of that
---
console bad
---
pc good
---
If I was killer I would have ket you escape due to toxic teammates
---
Yes, the killer victory is of 3 or 4 kills
---
More like Cujo
---
Him and billy definitely have silly moris.
---
Friday the 13th had tons of gore and dismemberment and it didn't have any notable country or rating restrictions.
---
I LOVE this thank u
---
How long has he been playing
---
You cut off the left side of your screen where it shows us how many gens were up if any at all during said camp.  You posted this to reddit so I'm assuming there were gens up?
---
It‚Äôs fair to die on hook if you‚Äôre the last survivor, you should have found the hatch.
---
Thanks for being generous. I'd like to put my name in the bucket as well. Have been wanting to try the new killer really bad but am pretty broke at the moment.
---
Its so small that i piss on my balls
---
There's no way they're going to say anything about this until Early December if they are trying to get Pennywise as the newest killer
---
Yes both of those too
---
Maybe you should rub your wife‚Äôs ass more while your playing it will give you good matchmaking luck. 
---
Or her feet.. either way ;)
---
Look at the roadmap... not will be map ^^
---
But that doesn't mean ... don't come with a survivor
---
https://imgur.com/a/cRc5TQU
---
Buy spirit for spirit fury.  Half the killers MUST be run with enduring and spirit fury, unless u like a red rank whos with his smurf buddies to drop 9 fucking pallets on ur head
---
Personally i like 2 pallets then kill them
---
Exactly
---
about a month or two
---
RUE IT
---
No he's going to cost actual money. About 10 dollars actually. Im just saving up so i can Level him up instantly
---
Dont forget to look behind you
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve seen the roadmap. This was more of a rough idea if it ever did happen, and what I‚Äôd like to see in a Shining Chapter.
---
Banned in countries, yes but what do mean by couldn't be played by teens? The game is already rated M
---
Than cloun or the shape
---
I mean it's easier on pc soooooo, that's why I figured he whiffed so bad. I could care less if people play console or PC
---
does the new chapter come out at midnight during a certain time zone or does it depend on where you live?
---
Sorry if I‚Äôm being ignorant, where did you come to that conclusion?
---
my rule of thumb, if the survivors are toxic, i'll be toxic back
---
The clown or the shape
---
Hmm I know of one actually bamboozle actually effects pallet vaulting as well (perk says it effects window vaulting) on legion in feral frenzy.
---
Ah ok, I gotcha
---
Can we add an honorable mention Leatherface buff?
---
I agree and you‚Äôre right but what I meant is it makes sense from a license and business perspective. It‚Äôs a huge license and if WB is approaching games to have Pennywise in I guarantee they approached BHVR since they already worked with them in the past (NoES) and DBD is arguably the biggest horror game on the market right now. 
---
They can easily make up some cop out excuse like Pennywise/IT being desperate to feed on fear again but is too weak in his physical form after &gt;! his defeat by the adult Losers Club !&lt;  making him easy to convince to serve the entity. It certainly wouldn‚Äôt make perfect but just like the Demogorgon I can see them finding a way to have it make some sort of sense.
---
Loved this video, waiting for sequel, Noob3 is amazing üòéüòéüòé
---
Use moris for an straight week you will enjoy it so much.
---
I love these kind of pics, especially when they are toxic
---
They should nerd the Plague and make it so you just leave the vomit trails intermittently. She is very op in my opinion and she can end chases with her addons and purge. And also when I play with randoms. They always cleanse which then leads us to all dying from 50 meters away bc of the Corrupt purge.  Can‚Äôt even get to windows or pallets when she has the corrupt purge which ruins the game. I‚Äôve only won maybe 4 games in 2 months against killers rank 10 and under using Plague. Such a bad concept imo for a killer. Mind as welll return Legion back to his old self that consists of stab stab stab kill.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Well I guess it could help inspire you to be bigger and bolder lol
---
Ol' Bubba needs some love too
---
I'm having a sneaking suspicion that OP wants Legion nerfed! /s
---
In all seriousness Legion buffs would be nice.
---
Weird how people need to learn before becoming  experienced players eh
---
I agree entirely. It's a huge and smart move business wise. My friend also said it would make sense of it was &gt;!after his death!&lt; Because he was invincible until challenged. The Entity hasn't been challenged yet.
---
Sexy orgy!
---
Would you know if he prefers playing survivor or killer?
---
It‚Äôs definitely not the best perk. Not even the best information gathering perk. That would be whispers or discordance
---
[No.](https://youtu.be/6xVshMgaM4Y)
---
Yes of course
---
Np but maybe the demigoen but that may cost more as it‚Äôs coming out very soon
---
Alternate opinion, Dont buy any nonlicensed DLC (Clown, Spirit, Plague, etc) since they can be earned in game. Licensed DLC has to be purchased (Halloween, Scream, Texas Chainsaw, Saw, Stranger Things) so I would buy those unless you know he wants the non licensed ones
---
Even though It 2 just came out, Dr. Sleep is coming out and that's a sequel to the shining or something like that. So the timing could add up. Like how stranger things dlc was revealed while stranger things season 3 was still newish.
---
I'd buy something like this tbh Go back and make some sets for us! =) lol
---
Not sure why all the downvotes...?
---
sooo just an orange?
---
No I meant as in if a killer tunnels and the survivor taking him off the hook in front of killer not saying that the killer tunnels if the survivors do that
---
If he plays Killer and doesn't have them already, Leatherface and Hag. They have the two most meta perks for Killers, BBQ and Ruin, respectively.
---
Beyond that, it's really all personal preference.
---
Op mentioned it‚Äôs his first hatch escape, we can then deduce that op is rank 15-20
---
I forgot about the demogorgon so my brain immediately went to demoman and I was trying to remember when we got a TF2 chapter
---
Okay that is one licensed killer I'd be totally down for right the fuck now
---
The game relies on you being the host and the survivors connection to you so it might be both of you tbf
---
Got it. Thanks.
---
Wait, what‚Äôs the actual release time?
---
It‚Äôs a great anime
---
For real! and Thank you!
---
It's an idea but I like We're Gonna Live Forever's current implementation. Honestly I'd love for them to make No One Left Behind better by giving it WGLF's current effect, and for them to create a second Bloodpoint generation perk based on the number of generators that are done. Perhaps it's a bit excessive to give Survivors two Bloodpoint farming perks for up to 300% (or 400% with an Escape Cake, which is to say nothing of Bloody Party Streamers) Bloodpoints per round, but I think it could be balanced out if they gave the perks a downside, even if the downside was just opportunity cost. ~~Something something BBQ shouldn't be such a strong tracking perk.~~
---
Of course! also one of the best,,,
---

uh that's not bannable,it would,at most,a ping abuse/lag swicth,with is not bannable

I don't know who you've been watching, but that literally has fucking nothing to do with being a youtuber. They choose content to create, edit and assemble their videos, and upload for money. This bitch spent money to look like a pig, just to post it on reddit and ask a bunch of strangers if she looks cool. It's *a* sad outfit and obviously anyone who thinks it is needs to get a fucking life and stop being so immersed in a buggy game that costs more than it's even worth lmao. Not pessimistic, just an observation. üïµ

next version will include the 15 feet tall brain
---
Is the theme song of this game intentionally meant to go along with the title of the game?
---
Like you know the song, "da da da-da".  Now sing with it "dead by daylight".  It matches perfectly.  Just a random thought I had last night and I can't get it out of my head anytime I hear the song now.
---
Hurray, I no longer need to lawyer up and hit the gym!
---
iri head is fine, it's when it's paired with the belt it's cancerous to go against, especially if their aim is good.
---
Plague and clown for good perks, spirit for viability as well as perks, and legion for bloodpoints. All in my opinion of course.
---
Imagine using self-care in 2019
---
Ehhh mine would just be a new mechanic, where as killer if you go through a rough time of pallet stuns and teabags you can mori yourself.
---
Killer is trying to kill said survivors, automatically T A X I C
---
Survivor addons do have downsides. So do killers.  
---
"Increase Chainsaw cooldown"  
---
"Increases flashlight consumption rate"  
---
"Item is consumed on use"
---
I'm a killer main and I'm scared of you jesus nice fucking hatchets man
---
Theres at least a thousand SCPs to choose from, if 173s not gonna work there is no problem
---
Lmao too true... Apparently killers w/ mori's aren't toxic, but the second a survivor dips a teabag..
---
Perhaps the Entity did alter him somehow, but Carter specifically enjoyed his twisted work and saw it as basically "For the good of science" with all his twisted experiments that were borderline more torture than anything. Whether willing to or not at first, I'm sure he just sees the potential for more test subjects for his experiments and has no problem doing the Entity's bidding as a sort of win-win situation for him and the Entity.
---
I‚Äôm pretty dumb so did self care get nerfed, or is it just unviable?

Don't forget depipping. That's by far the worst! I had a killer DC on us last night right after the match started, completely wasting the sets of BPS that were offered. Sad day!
---
Uhh, halloween if for children. Grow tf up.
---
A telekinetic killer would be dope if they managed to make powers work for them (throwing down pallets onto survivors maybe?)
---
Satire in relation to the genre of horror, duh huh.
---
Then when he hit a survivor he scream on top of his lung ‚ÄúPOWARRRRRRRRR‚Äù? Yes pls.
---
Such is why I said 173 wouldn‚Äôt work. I was making a comment on you proposing 173 over any other SCP

Wasn‚Äôt this just posted yesterday

My boyfriend is the same, he was the one who suggested playing it originally when I wasn‚Äôt interested, but he soon came to think it was a bad game while I love it. I just don‚Äôt play it when we‚Äôre together, we do something else or play another game. :)
---
But im not agreeing with it, the way you said it just sounded rude, so I wanted to say something. Im sorry if i came off trying to argue with you.
---
Well that‚Äôs nice I really liked these
---
Rule #836 of the survivor handbook. "if survivor has DS the killer just submit or he's toxic"
---
Agreed
---
It‚Äôs still there for me... but I am from Germany
---
I'm so glad other people feel and understand,  totally thought I would recieve some hate mail.
---
Not really. The entity is more of a god, but IT is more of an powerful being.

---
I mean, maybe I could cut it up?
---
I'm guessing it's to balance out the Stranger Things chapter since it contains 2 survivors. I don't think it's very necessary at all but they might decide to do that.
---
Ugh, that feels so bad. I've had that happen to me literally after doing almost everything myself.
---
They're not acting like the numbers are flipped. They're acting like they want more of one and not the other.
---
We need a cosmic space turtle as the entity's counterpart now
---
Just name Pennywise "The Entity" then. Lore it up as a physical manifestation of The Entity itself for when the killers can't get the job done.
---
DBD was a sequel to IT all along.
---
U mean the entity
---
Same here.
---
They are described the same. And they are both clearly from the Deadlights.

Another young actors life ruined by drugs and alcohol.
---
That's what I was planning on doing when I'm solo,  maining killer but I'm just not that into it and honestly I slaughter people at my rank lol I use the wraith and rarely don't get a 4k. Idk what's up with the locker hiding lately it's becoming worse,  and I've actually seen killers say they "feel bad" for the "new" players who hide in lockers and let them go.. Like why encourage bad behavior? Kill them, and maybe they won't hide in lockers 24/7.
---
And kindred when you‚Äôre swf
---
Just make it so even if you die you get the bonus points
---
You almost camp most of the pallets but at least loop em efficiently
---
Should've actually fuckin hit the guy lmao
---
IT, as an entity, is a creature that grows stronger the more something fears IT. If there is no fear, it is rather weak (as shown by Losers Club fucking IT up). The Entity could squash IT like the bug she is. I could see the Entity making a deal with IT.
---
&gt;But isn't the killer likely to beeline to the door with NOED?
---
So are survivors. Dull totems next to the last gen are the best option; you can see it light up and check *immediately*
---
I've actually had matches soft thrown because I watched a teammate finish a dull totem next to final gen, then got smacked with NOED. High chance we coulda gotten rid of it had they left it
---
PSN digging deep into your pocket and Xbox is just bending their customers over!
---
If you use his power effectively then it‚Äôs very useful at A. Wasting survivors time, and B. Giving information on survivor locations. You‚Äôre using it wrong or the Legions you‚Äôre playing against are if you think he‚Äôs the worst killer in the game. I‚Äôd give him C tier honestly. Not amazing but not completely dogshit at high ranks like Wraith. (Disclaimer: I love Wraith.)
---
Oh god it's happening, EVERYBODY STAY CALM.. STAY FUCKING CALM!
---
The devs have specifically said they won't add a disguise killer.
---
Two royal guards block your path.
---
No he isn't. Pennywise is a cosmic being Which is just an alien.
---
Lol. Nice.
---
new survivor: boat

Not if it gets you both killed but Oohh-k lol

---
Yeah definitely bubbas the most for me. Myers second place though.
---
I hope his body is as hairy as his face.
---
No they aren't.
---
Yeah that kept on happening with my friend he died like 10 times because of that
---
I really like how the demogorgon will play plus Steve's perks will help me stop tunnelers somewhat
---
Wo rye is every time

Nea Laughs ‚Äúin the Samination voice‚Äù &amp; says Thank You!
---
Ehh I feel like we need Stephen King representation in this game as he is considered the king of horror
---
Screw it, let him saw to his hearts content, just make it take a minimum amount of time to make going around the map sabotaging all pallets not worthwhile
---
Pennywise is from the Deadlights. Touched by the Entity and when the Entity shows up all matches the description of the Deadlights. Pennywise describes his true form as a mass of hairy spider like legs. The same way the Entity looks when we see it.
---
maybe a tower or a man in black.
---
Speed! It's like Michael is on ice skates lol
---
This is dope! I would buy a whole set if you started making them! Nice work! üëçüèÖ
---
Using self care just hurts you more than helps. Takes ages to sit there and hold the heal button, wasting a ton of time when you could‚Äôve been helping your team by doing generators. 
---
It‚Äôs also not necessary if you‚Äôre running perks like Iron Will, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, etc.
---
It feeds on fear. The Entity deeds on Lost hopes. Same creature different desired food.
---
Wow, not sure why the downvotes here lol..
---
I've got a friend who loves Flag and says he's the best villain, but that he wouldn't work in DbD.
---
Lmao git gud seriously.  I run WGLF and i get 40-50k easily just about every game
---
An "entity" is just defined as a being of Independence. It doesn't entail deitic status
---
You forget that it can be his secondary power. Maybe, he can have some other (which helps mid-chase).
---
Or, would be cool if Pennywise could shapeshift into chests, gens, lockers, hatches to ambush people ‚Äî not only into other survivors.
---
King would never sign off on a Kubrick inspired The Shining DLC.
---
Doctor Sleep is coming out soon! Maybe something to push promo for that?
---
I'm not taking offense it was just a pointless comment *shrug*
---
personally I'm using my 1m on Nancy for dinner strength. I recommend demo tho because even if its teachables arent that good the killer itself is pretty good, especially with other petks
---
Damn, how have I been missing out on this! 
---
Definitely going to try it. Thank you!
---
Pennywise is a cosmic being from another dimension. The Entity has always existed in our dimension and has its own literal realm, In a pocket of reality. Pennywise doesn't have that on the same scale as the Entity
---
Now they went for me just for asking, some right sad negative characters on this subreddit
---
Dumb question- so the update does not come at the same time as the shrine of secrets refreshes?
---
Why we can‚Äôt have disguise killer? What if he can change not only into other survivors, but also in the lockers, chests, gens, hatches, pallets etc?
---
Happened to me yesterday. Got facecamped on first hook by a wraith and he went out of his way to message me. I resisted the urge to message him in the first place then I got that. Insane üòÇ (console btw)
---
I completely forgot about Doctor Sleep! You‚Äôre totally right!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt dislike that.
---
I didn't say we shouldn't. But what I am saying is that the devs confirmed it isn't gonna happen
---
They gave me Freddy‚Äôs dream chaser daily 5 days in a row... that was before the rework...
---
Dark Dwight
---
No problem, just remember to keep your obsession alive! The killer can almost get a little too fast lol I miss doorways a lot w/ it's up to 8 tokens
---
I play for fun, skill, and BP in that order, and months back wait times were soo bad i wasn't having fun; meanwhile now i cant bare more than a few games due to how unfun and a chore it is to steam roll new players just to get out of rank 16 (much less the amount of skill required). Thus due to rank reset i am perpetually trapped.
---
What if they are allowed to make It an extension of The Entity? That‚Äôs even what they could call it.
---
I play killer alot and try to get at least one per game
---
True, but if he did he would make a lot of money
---
The frame rate too, personally i dont think its that bad nowadays. But a year ago it you could basically close your eyes mid blink and have the same information
---
Think of it like this: IT can be contained and can‚Äôt affect the word around it. Sure, it can change how people view the world, but it can‚Äôt change the world itself just like that. For example, only the kids could see the blood covering Bev‚Äôs bathroom; none of the adults saw anything.
---
The entity is much more of a god of an alternate dimension than IT. He can bring the survivors to life after death with no consequences (i.e. They aren‚Äôt a zombie after being resurrected). He can get rid of entire places/maps in a second. He directly controls the rules of its dimension.
---
am I the only one who wants a ronald mc donald cosmetic for clown?
---
Only the mask was licensed regarding Ghost Face, not the character from the Scream franchise.
---
Ghost Face is an original character created and largely designed by BHVR themselves.
---
Feeling like the old guy in the group now
---
Wow, it‚Äôs that fast? So basically you have to hit another survivor without missing and it gives you a token. What happens if you miss an attack?
---
Same thing happened with nurse, only thing is people on PS4 always wanna fuck around with her, and I like my Myers better and with that P3 blood mask it scares them every time and they know he ain‚Äôt fucking around! 
---
I do get that one special person who try‚Äôs that with Michael and then find out real quick that when you poke the bear, the bear pokes you!
---
I dont like playing against Legion because I think is boring, the same goes with the Doctor, I just think their mechanics are unfun
---
Sounds the same.
---
That would work.
---
Killer should do what it takes to win. It would be dumb for a killer to ignore survivors since that's their objective.
---
&gt;From ''We won't add clowns due to real fears'' to LET's ADD PENNYWISE lol
---
Off topic, but it bugs me when people use this out of context. The devs said this like two weeks before they released the clown. It was an intentionally misleading statement. Clowns were never out of the question.
---
source?
---
There technically is no "right way" but yeah my goal is to kill as many as possible if the endgame makes it seem like i can't then i protect the hooked survivor
---
I would recommend The Shape
---
The Clown's power is weird, it is kind of like Trapper but not as good (because it cannot hold you in place like Trapper's power can). The Clown's power can be good in many cases, but he is hard to use very well. However, he is free to unlock (if you use Iridescent Shards), and The Shape is not (you must buy him with real money)
---
The Shape is very easy to understand, and easy to use. Some people who can use The Shape well get really really good, even better than people who can use The Clown's power really well. Also, playing as The Shape can be lots of fun, especially when you use the special addons that let him kill people.
---
As for perks, they both have good perks. The Clown's best perks are Bamboozle (which is very nice for some killers to help them in chases) and Pop Goes The Weasel (which removes A LOT of generator progress when you use it). Coulrophobia (which means Fear of Clowns) is not very good. The Shape's best perk is Save The Best For Last, which is good on almost every killer, and is really powerful overall. His other perks are good too, but not as good as STBFL. Play With Your Food is good on certain killers, especially if you really focus on using it (almost like cheating with it). Dying Light is going to be changed soon, and the new Dying Light perk will look very fun to use, especially if you can use it with Furtive Chase (Ghost Face's perk that means your Obsession changes throughout the game)
---
I hope this helps you!
---
Welcome to our world haha.
---
Seriously though, don't let it get to you. Once you get some more perks and become better at the game in general you'll get a lot more kills.
---
I can just imagine as he‚Äôs chasing you you can just hear his armor clanking as he‚Äôs coming towards you
---
Is it not true that they said they were gonna have the dedicated Servers released with the new DLC
---
Actually, this would be amazing lol
---
Why do people downvote this guy? BBQ has atleast 3 counters-stay in 40m, behind the gen or hide in a locker. When whispers has no counter, discordance is so good it actually carried 2-3 games for me today, even bitter murmur can be better.
---
It's not intended to ever go off. Its aim was to promote doing totems and punish thoughtless rushing
---
This hole was made for me!

Can we Please get this

lmaoo
---
Laughs in Ace gang.

Them falling asleep passively or you hitting them when theryre awake count towards it, so pretty much literally just play freddy and youll get it now lol
---
This man is too good for this world, we don‚Äôt deserve such a kind soul
---
That's a tough one. The Stand is classic but Dark Tower is pretty damn good too. A split killer like Legion might be cool.
---
Some big ass rats

Kinda like old bt but sacrifices two perk slots to pull off. So I think it could be a nice change .

Don‚Äôt fret boyo, *I‚ÄôLL BE GENTLE!*

I really want the Stranger Things DLC because personally I really like the show and season 1 was great, season 2 was so so but I didn't hate it and season 3 to me was fun again! 
---
I loved the Demogorgon and I've grown to love Steve the Hair Harrington and Nancy is cool too! 
---
I'm a newer DBD player I started playing shortly after Ash was introduced and before GhostFace. I have grown to really love this game and I've always wanted to try it out since they added Myers. 
---
It would mean the world to me to be able to play as the Demogorgon as I usually play by myself anyways and he really seems like a fun killer and really unique. 
---
Anyways good luck to everyone in the giveaway and thanks to OP for giving back to the community. Also you didn't say to list your platform but I'm on ps4 if that matters c: take it easy!
---
They said by the end of summer and that goal was realistic and was gonna happen until problems were found with the servers on ptb but I'm sure you woulda loved them to be released as a buggy mess instead so people could hate them for that instead
---
I know youre trying to help this dude but he was trying to help someone asking what DLC they should buy and replied to the thread by accident and then replied to him properly lol.
---
You don't have to apologize, this it the No Stupid Questions thread &lt;3
---
I don't know for sure, but I think it is very likely that, yes, you get the achievement simply for playing him. You get Dream Demon points every time someone falls asleep (once every minute, ignoring skill checks, and every time you hit an awake survivor), so it's very likely that the achievement is simply tied to a mechanic that's much easier to achieve now.
---
This wouldn't surprise me, since they never changed the Adept \[Killer\] achievement requirements. Before the emblem system, you used to get a merciless victory every time you got a 4K; now, merciless victories are directly tied to the emblem system, and instead of getting Adept achievements simply from 4Ks you somehow have to get a full Merciless. It be like that sometimes
---
Same with me i was wondering wtf was happening lol
---
What triggers a killer to lose add-ons?   I have more time played than I‚Äôd like to admit btw.
---
The Clown: am I a joke to you
---
I just recently started watching him and I love him already.
---
A lot of laggy (possibly lagswitch) spirits being posted lately
---
Yeah, instas are the same as moris in my eyes, gross broken things for the most part. Someone used a syringe in the middle of a chase on me, and the loss of pressure pretty much lost me the game. She was in my lobby three next round so I brought an ivory to kill her on first hook because it felt like she did as much bs to me.
---
Harry Warden would be such a good idea but i think the trappers backstory is a little too similar atleast in terms of mineshafts and what not
---
He‚Äôs just so wholesome
---
I feel like you see it as a punishment while like remember me and blood warden I see it as a last ditch effort to get downs before escape . 
---
Hence why I think it should stay hidden until end game
---
r/jontron is leaking - ECCH
---
I actually discovered him because of this comment  a few days back, and what a wholesome guy. He's truly nice.
---
I knew Christine was going to be the next killer.
---
So next time don't give a set date watch not get released this fall either
---
Honestly, I would just drop the entity from this game altogether and replace it with a cosmic **event** and keep the Fog. The Entity was never really all that interesting and only made sense in the context of the original killers who were brought forth by it to be tormented and force to kill. As soon as we brought in DLC killers, especially ones that are never subservient and would never fulfill the wishes of some cosmic spidey bitch, we began running into problems. Even with the original though, the killers never felt intimidating because they were always second best and beneath the entity. You don't really want that in a narrative that demands intimidation.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d56jvg/can_you_give_me_good_yt_channels_that_upload_dbd/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Nurse already features what's basically telekinesis in a large amount of her animations. Besides the fact she's floating, she also simply breaks pallets and generators with her hand, kind of just floats over windows, and picks up survivors without touching them.
---
Honestly, the only thing out of place in her animations is her power, which I find amusing
---
.....
---
Creative, I like it
---
Well tunneling usually doesn‚Äôt help the killer win it mostly hurts them with them spending so much time of one survivor over the other three which most of the time work on gens uninterrupted, making tunneling just a toxic thing that you really only do if you‚Äôre new to the game or really want to kill that person (same with face camping)

And thank you too for answering, I was thinking it was like that, but I wanted to get a second opinion. And I knowww, I‚Äôve been playing since May last year, but only recently bought some DLCs that I was missing. It‚Äôs gonna be a pain but at least now I know the Dream Demon trophy is one I‚Äôll get by simply trying to go for that double pip game. Thank you!
---
Technically we‚Äôre all animals
---
they were using good perks, BBQ and Ruin are Meta, and they were using OP addons. They taught someone a lesson
---
Prove thyself for objective points, self care for survival points, borrowed time for all the altruism points and we‚Äôre gonna live forever to get up to double the points each match, and break all the totems you find for boldness points
---
Hex: rue-in
---
Yeah) Would still be hella fun duh)
---
Mad cause bad would be my best guess. Either that or another multitude of reasons
---
It's ok. I hate myself.
---
Bricky is all the man we need)
---
Also, the Deadlights feeds off fear, while the Entity feeds off hope. It would seem that IT would come in to CHALLENGE the entity more than plays it's game right?
---
Show some love to small game perk
---
Someone once tried to tell me homophobia didn‚Äôt still exist in gaming and I wish I could show them this lol
---
weird flex but ok
---
I would fucking main Gibby, just saying.
---
You're too sick to type two words max, but feeling fine enough to reply with full sentences to all the other replies in this thread? My dude
---
Vault speed bonuses? Is that really a thing?
---
ok
---
why does it matter this much??? omg
---
Oh, than it was a nurse that DCd after slugging everyone. I see. Not sure he thought him anything.
---
Why only his addons? They need all sorts of fixing so they aren‚Äôt annoying to play/play against.
---
Furthermore, it's not an asymmetrical game. The killer has a ton of work to do with an incredible amount of micro managing while survivors can literally go afk on a gen, hook, or slugged and potentially only be in chase a small amount of the game. It seems like there's no way to balance it perfectly for everyone to be happy so I always hear complaining from one side or the other. I would be so happy if I saw a post once in a while about how much people enjoy the game as it is instead of always insisting it's broken in one way or the other, it's incredibly discouraging. All that to say I agree with you but also the killer has to wait much longer between matches while survivors can jump right into the next one which is even more BP to consider over time.
---
How long have you played for?
---
Doesn't matter in general, but it seems that you actually care about your viewer count. But still, live your best life.

Maybe a 10% chance of escape when the swing happens?

I‚Äôm quitting maining Myers and going back to maining Clown
---
Maybe
---
How about we remove the killer completely?
---
Source? I REALLY want to see that.
---
I do not understand the first part of your argument, please reword it for me
---
Slugging is not holding game hostage and not bannable.
---
wait so will you keep your swf after a match? cause I thought that was something that CAME with the dedicated servers.
---
For real it is. Test it yourself if you wanna see it in action.
---
Poor clown all wanted was cough medicine
---
That's not luck tho, you could combine these two and get like a garunteed unhook
---
i actually don't want pennywise in dbd
---
I'd play them
---
They don‚Äôt do lesser known horror characters because it just doesn‚Äôt drive in as much traffic as the more popular characters. Bringing in the killer from Sleepaway Camp won‚Äôt give them as much revenue or attention as bringing in the most popular modern horror series, Stranger Things. 
---
I would **love** to see characters from My Bloody Valentine or Candyman but it simply does not generate enough buzz or attract newer players than something like Pennywise or Stranger Things would.
---
are these with the new status effects that come tomorrow with the dlc?
---
thank you! and I agree, a SWF would be a nightmare for a disguised killer
---
Killers alreade have penalty for being 16 meters close to hook. Survivors have BT to safely unhook doesnt matter how you do  that. Decisive Strike is common and now you have to manage four of them instead of 1 and rarely more. 3 hooks. Survivors already surviving alot pls stop.
---
Imagine having the second perk. Equal speed to huntress, hag, and spirit in the endgame. With hope the only things faster are a blink, chainsaw run, or spirit phasing. So strong
---
Let's rephrase: it was gook killer (a Nurse) with BBQ, PGTW, BBQ (good perks), green and yellow range add-on (OP ones). She downed every single survivor before they finished their second gen and then DCd, because she doesn't want to rank up.
---
Perk:Do the fucking gens u lazy cunt
---
Flex seals the hatch when at least 2 gens are done
---
&lt;3 thank you so much dude
---
Not sure about that, since I thought the same, but the friends list and regrouping still worked on the PTB when the disabled the dedicated servers for a day or so (I might be wrong about this, but it‚Äôs my best guess)
---
Haha what map?
---
that... that has nothing to do with the arguement. You said he made another spirit main by making a killer with "weak perks" DC. The huntress was playing with OP addons that anyone with half a brain can abuse the Iri Head and Infantry Belt. The huntress DC'd because she couldn't bully low rank survivors with OP addons. The Poster taught this huntress that you need skill to Bully people (as huntress anyway)
---
Cause y‚Äôall would bitch and moan about it until it gets nerfed to the ground like Legion
---
I subscribe to the school of never explaining jokes or analogies so that people who get it, get it, and those who don't pretty much never ask for clarification because it would out them as not understanding the joke or reference.
---
Cool!
---
What did you use to make this? The lines are amazing.
---
There‚Äôs really only one way that I can see for dealing with this; press on. The better you get, the more confident you become, the fewer nightmares you‚Äôll get of this game.
---
Mine did the same exact thing today. Super irritating.
---
The Game, probably the worst map for the nurse since there‚Äôs not a lot of open area.
---
Not me. I do enjoy strong killers. Newbies ‚Äî yes, absolutely
---
Okay, but HOW is the question? If it's so easy, explain it to me. That's what I'm asking, because I don't buy that lag switchers are THAT popular on console
---
People ask for things explained to them so that they can understand, I don‚Äôt think anyone needs to fear not getting a joke or reference.
---
Actually it is true, legions power is stabing people alot, you're in the wrong here.
---
Hollowed Dwight, more like. He looks so empty.
---
Borgar king
---
The logic is sound. And hey I‚Äôm all for Pennywise being added. He‚Äôs the one licensed killer I still want in the game outside of Jason. But it seems weird that they wouldn‚Äôt add him in 2017 with the release of the first movie then release him months after the second does. 
---
But I guess we‚Äôll just have to wait and see. I‚Äôm excited for whatever the unveil.
---
WE WANT PENNYWISE! SUMMON PENNYWISE
---
Always remember kids if your gonna be M1ing atleast m1 on a gen
---
Well then it seems I can use your logic against you
---
Leatherface can be decent in chases with the right perks. PWYF can change the course of the game if the Obsession doesn't catch on quickly.
---
I think it's great that you explained it :) Thanks friend!
---
I haven't noticed any.
---
My Annie Wilkes killer can finally happen!!
---
How do you know the next chapter doesn‚Äôt have a map?
---
I have the same issue. I've stood on opposite sides of a pallet looking at him, and he's managed to get me Exposed. It seems so touchy, unless there's something I haven't figured out.
---
Please be mid night! Im waiting!!!
---
Again, Friday the 13th has tons of decapitation and it released in Japan
---
http://7gof.tokyo/friday-the-13th/
---
Same, I‚Äôve been grinding them bloodpoints for this!!
---
Same!!! Im at a mil bp to spent on nancy (new survivor main) and demi!
---
That sucks :( I guess you just have to play the game and try to collect as much bp in each category as you can. Bring some bp offerings if you have them.
---
I thought they recently talked about patching that out
---
Where? I cant find the follow.
---
He just can‚Äôt end chases quick enough. So in order to secure kills, he has to camp. The only chance he has is for every survivor to be one hooked and to hope that all the other survivors waste time coming to check out what‚Äôs going on rather than doing gens.  You could have play with your food or bamboozle and other anti loop perks but he still is at a disadvantage against survivors higher than rank 10. His power essentially forces him to be the ultimate camper. You never can get an unhook from a leather face.
---
Dang! I‚Äôm not even close to a mil yet, only at 350k BP. Also I think I‚Äôm gonna have Steve be my new main but I‚Äôm split between the two ü§î
---
If you listen closely to the end you can hear me gasp lmao.. no matter how much play time I have on her I will never cease to be totally amused by cross mapping.
---
I am turning mad , I CANT FIND THE FOLLOW , i go to the following of behavior and dead by Daylight , and they dont follow king!
---
Been trying to do that. Only have cypress mori's left so either they leave as the last survivor or they all cheese escape lol
---
uff...please not another licensed killer. I want original killers!
---
Except I'm a rank 1 killer who gets 4k's 95% of the time if its rank 8 or less. Not the best killer out there but I know what I'm doing.
---
I will not purposely run away from a survivor just cause I know I've downed them before. I'm not gonna waste 30 seconds starting over a search for another survivor when there's one right in front of me. Overall getting a quick down (regardless if they've been hooked already or not) puts the most pressure on survivors.
---
Move over Hillbilly *beep beep*
---
Steves 100% cooler but thing is id just use scoops and never use prest and i love using pret and steves tall AF nancy is small so its better for hiding! Cant bloody wait
---
Go to Stephen Kings twitter, then go to followers
---
Help me I can't stop laughing.
---
They have a roadmap for this year. Next mid chapter patch should have the rifts and the next chapter will have no map because they are reworking a map just like what they did with the preschool (most likely the Saw Map). The last chapter of year 4 should be a full chapter.
---
AAAAnd I was responding to a person that said nothing about killers with OP add-ons. He only said that it makes him feel good when killer DCs on him. And I'm pretty sure that's why he has more downvotes than I do.
---
Also if killer with OP add-ons loses that badly he wants to DC, it means that add-ons aren't OP, killer is bad, map is complete BS, or killer player is out of survivor's league. Which one it is? Or combination? Let's that it's OK to feel good if killer with BS add-ons was cocked by BS map. But should you feel good if you stomped a noob that just wanted to try a shiny set of add-ons? There's no context.
---
Man I‚Äôm getting excited!!!
---
I can just imagine Christine chasing survivors and dropping them off at the hatch
---
usually comes out around 11am eastern
---
It seems like people start every match with an intention to be rude, and only stop once they realize that you're good enough to make it so they can't. This only gets worse when there's a SWF in your match, which is half the reason why people dislike them so much.
---
I say this as a halfway decent killer (I think), and it doesn't really have anything to do with rank or skill or anything like that. It just seems 100% that some people have to be forced to play the game as intended at first.
---
Oh okay thanks, I‚Äôll look into it.
---
Which is odd, since the lore said it pleases the entity.
---
Ahh damn, that‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll be ready by 11. Thanks for letting me know!
---
I‚Äôd imagine a car just jumping driving into the air and flipping sideways to get through a window

Gibby ‚Äòs level 40 perk ‚ÄúGibby fucking dies‚Äù
---
After jumping off of a ledge the closest generator gains 20/30/40% progress 
---
If this perk is combined with balanced landing ilthey combine into a singular perk called‚Äùtoxic survivor mains‚Äù where if you jump off of the lendge the killer fucking dies lol
---
If you want to see it look up Dead by Daylight Road map year 4
---
Look up otzdarva on YouTube, he makes very odd but highly effective builds ie play with your food myers. I've had a lot of success with them so far
---
Irc they'd have to be REALLY specific with what it does to be balanced and it to really stick the landing (heh) and I think to do that they would have to make it where it wasn't the universal stun but one where the killer can't swing for a second and is slowed or something as being able to drop someone at will, essentially, is really strong.
---
damn whats wrong wrong my Twitter
---
Yeah I think so as well, I‚Äôve talked about this somewhere else as well, some people open the game just to try and ruin someone‚Äôs day because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfunny‚Äù, both survivors and killers
---
It pulls from your inventory automatically. It'll keep doing so until you run out or you change your loadout.
---
This is me in every final fantasy game ever.
---
If you're gonna taunt the killer. Do it right infront of the goddamn escape zone you dipshits.
---
Dang he roasted us legion mains
---
Am I missing something?
---
HONK! HONK HOOOONK!
---
If you want them to take it slow then making posts complaining about this and that not being here doesn't help, it's basically saying hurry up or just in most cases insulting the devs.

No, this is a discussion. I wouldn't consider talking to people a game, but I suppose it is to some people.
---
Fair assessment, I think it‚Äôs a coin toss right now, especially seeing as Doctor Sleep is a continuation of The Shining and is releasing in November. 
---
I think a strike against Pennywise is his whole ‚Äòmorph into your fears‚Äô aspect. Taking on the look of a Survivor is already a no go, so how exactly could they implement a Shapeshifter power?
---
I would be mid greens.
---
It was the first hook of the game lol. But there is no right way but there is a least effective way
---
I fucking love this sub; stay thirsty you horny fuckers

It's gonna be the Langoliers.

They left me and another guy to die on hook for the last gen, and this was what Meg chose to do with her free escape.

Carly survivor or riot
---
They asked then but Warner Bros didn‚Äôt know if they wanted to do anything with the movie yet. It‚Äôs more likely we could get it now because Pennywise is coming to Fortnite just like how Stranger Things was in Fortnite a little before it got into DbD.

One: If they like the game they can cosplay as the pig , don‚Äôt be a dick about it
---
Two: The person that made this put more effort into this costume then you did to make a comment that disses her for no reason

Three : there are hundreds of people who dress up as video game characters. Turns out it‚Äôs this really indie thing called ‚Äúcosplay‚Äù you probably haven‚Äôt heard of it
---
Four: if you don‚Äôt think dead by daylight is worth its price why are you on the subreddit for it?
---
Honestly I‚Äôd much rather WGLF be combined with either Borrowed Time or We‚Äôll Make It (probably the latter, cuz BT+WGLF May be a bit too broken)‚Äîthat way, it‚Äôd encourage safer saves, and would actually serve some kind of utility. 
---
If you only get tokens for gens completed, you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to never get four stacks, or people would never go for hook saves so they could get their tokens from gens.
---
*patrick voice* Where‚Äôs the leak ma‚Äôam?

See, what you've done is you've essentially made a bowl.

I mean, Doctor is like stupidly easy, it may as well say "Play Doctor".

I pair it with Play With Your Food so you're right in movement part. I get those mixed up. But those two together can make him, well any killer, fast as shit
---
How many niggers are in my store?

I imagined this to be a literal "yeet" and I chuckled far louder than I probably should have.

Dont do this. Youre just breeding toxicity

Yeah facecamping is pretty stupid imo but if you've got one hoomed and three fully healed survivors with the gate open killers gotta kill üíÅ

Have you tried legion you get like 6 dc‚Äôs in a match

No post-game chats (especially salty ones on either side). Sorry. :(

Please censor names in the future. This is also oversaturated content, sorry. :(

Ah yes, remember when that add-on did something?

Good riddance.

---
"Autistic" isn't an appropriate term to use here. I feel you, I really do, but that kind of language isn't OK.
---
That's pretty amazing! Awesome job!
---
As soon as I read the shapeshifter I already knew it was a big old no
---
You can still have OP addons and still suck ass at the game, you're argument is weak and your cucumbers are soft
---
That would entirely negate the point of Steve's new perk babysitter.
---
So I told you wrong, here's my mistake (sorry) both are Michael perks and are very similar with needing the obsession. So Save the Best for Last increases your "attack/lunge" speed and Play With Your Food increases actual "movement" speed. Sorry abt that. I pair them together a lot, well use to before I mained Spirit. Those two together rely on the obsession and you can be super fast all around using both. Using STBFL would be good with Agitation and Mad Grit.
---
o no joe
---
Why didnt you go through the hatch earlier?
---
looks laggy, you rubberbanded. So nothing to do with hitboxes
---
Holy shit this looks horrific!  
---
I know Evil Dead didn't get a killer, but damn! sure looks like it.
---
I'd agree with you if I was using it as an insult, but I 100% believe my team mates are mentally challenged in one way or another.
---
If you 100% camp throughout a match there's basically no chance he will pip.
---
One: that's perfectly fine but I have freedom of speech and am just pointing out that there isn't any legitimate use for the costume at all other than this post
---
Two: it takes almost zero effort to buy something online, have it delivered to your house, and put it on
---
Three: I've heard of cosplay and LARP (which I bet you don't know what that is (that's a sarcastic insult if you're too dumb to get it)) 
---
Four: because the memes are fucking hilarious and accurate as to how toxic this community really is üòÇ
---
Wtf kinda mental gymnastics is this?
---
That's what I said literally in the last string. Feels good to beat people that suck at a game? You also a fun person to play against, aren't you?

Isolation and discordance, mmmmm.

Screw it.  I'll take a hook for the hex.

Also , i checked Twitter follow checker and it says no . Can you post a screenshot?
---
Survivor perk: GIBBAAH!
---
When activated the survivor strips off their shirt and runs around screaming their name, stunning the killer for 20 seconds out of confusion.
---
Players cannot interact with gens, pallets, windows, or totems while this perk is active.
---
I run Kindred when playing solo for this very reason, hopefully letting my teammates know I'm being camped and to just rush the gens.  Of course, that's not always how it plays out but I'd like to think it helps.
---
You should just power through it then, or play with them a little by limiting yourself perk wise
---
Doesn't a normal Rainbow map track the hatch?
---
There's a difference between playing the game and having so little to do that you waste money to buy the costume just to make yourself feel better about the dissapointment that is your life.
---
No confirmed price, some have said it'll cost around $11.99
---
I mean I don't speak from experience but I don't think rodent extermination is suppose to be relaxing lol. It should be fairly stressful with a level of application of pressure from both sides of the game. That's what games/sports are all about.
---
When you clear out a daily from a previous day, the new daily from today should take its place. However, I've also noticed that this doesn't seem to be happening recently, so they may have patched it out.
---
Please, oh please, let them get the rights to use Bill's laugh whenever he hits someone if it's Pennywise, PLEASE!!
---
I would perform a blood ritual to play this
---
They might've talked about it but currently its still a thing!
---
Steve‚Äôs makes him visible to the killer as well and hides the other survivor‚Äôs scratch marks. Steve‚Äôs is about drawing the killer away. While theres a a small overlap, it doesn‚Äôt negate it.
---
It's "He Who Walks Behind the Rows." His power only works on corn maps.
---
Its been almost 4 years and the game rarely improved in graphics, it still has bugs from 2 years ago, they implement perks that fix game mechanics rather than actually fixing the mechanics, they push out more cosmetics than they do updates. They keep trying to get franchise killers to increase their fanbase despite the toxicity of the community. 
---
Making these post especially these right here are memes, I'm not complaining I'm simply addressing the facts here. I haven't said anything that isn't true, nor did I say they need to make the game in my favor. What I specifically want is them to stop this bullshit cosmetics, these shitty chapters, these shitty perks, fix the game mechanics, update their programming, get more involved with the community instead of just the killers, then maybe just maybe this game can be great.
---
Personally I'd prefer Carrie or The Shining since we already have a clown killer. I mean, imagine having the overlook hotel as a map. That would be so dope. It's one of the most, if not 'the' most iconic horror locations in a movie ever.
---
i just dont like her slower speed, same as nurse. if nurse sucks on console, why dont they give her at least huntress speed only on console, not on PC
---
You don't secure a pip camping 1 person to death while getting gen rushed lol.  That's a recipe for a depip every game once you're out of potato ranks.
---
Daddy McCote....bless us
---
I'll level with you here. Even if, hypothetically, somehow your entire team consisted of people who had mental challenges or learning disabilities, calling folks out like that still isn't right- *especially* ones with mental handicaps, and arguably might make it even worse than using 'autistic' as a slur. Sorry to be such a downer on this. :/

---
Theres less killers then surviors generally. Survivors also dont need to stay whole games. not to mention killers need items while survivors dont , so they spend more bp. A lot more. (ofc its nice for survivor to have items but) I think WGLF is perfect how it is, BUT like BBQ should give a second decent effect. 
---
Oh not to mention killer you have to play alone, it getting more bp is really only fair.

Huntress is actually based off on old wives tale from virginia about a guy who lived in the woods and killed people. He wore a bunny mask and typically killed with an axe or hatchet. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunny\_Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunny_Man)

Sure , but can you imagine Derry , with the canal , sewers , park and library ? God damnnnn .

Those builds can be a lot of fun, BUT...with the way ppl dc, it may mean you only have 2 usable perks if the obsession dcs. So, it may not be two you want to main all the time. Your preference. Hope that helps.

---
Every time someone on this sub suggests a killer that disguises itself as other survivors, I die on the inside. If SWF didn't exist then maybe it'd be a good idea.
---
I mean they could do a jack for the book and not the movie but I still don't think they would make a shining chapter. Would love to be proved wrong though.

Actually really good, if the devs would actually take fan made content I can atleast see one of the perks making it into the game

Ranking is based on other actions you do as killer in addition to sacrificing . This includes just finding and attacking survivors, kicking gens, etc.
---
I dont think anybody with half a brain would do that and not expect it, I was obviously speaking about those guys that just "patrol" the hooked guy forever not even getiing far away enough to check the closest gen.
---
"Just do gens" of course its the obvious option but think of the hooked guy just dying like that and then for the rest of the players that match was a snoozefest of constabt left clicking
---
Ranking is garbage.
---
That honestly sounds pretty darn fun.
---
Yep but its amusing how many "Im not like that" killers you find here that will jump to defend any point against camping
---
Jokes on you I run Up The Ante and Slippery Meat. I can do it 6 times!
---
My dude. Even if this happened, this would just mean the killer would slug the last survivor every game, and just carry them away from the gates if one happened to be opened. This is a 4v1 game. One of the group players going against the power role will lose. That's how the game is designed.
---
I want free stuff that's why XD, Kidding, I want the dlc because I love stranger things, I've only watched it for a bit but the show is so interesting and it's got me captured, being able to play as the creature that I love so much would be a thrill, Also I apologize for all the discouragement, People are gonna be people right?

It is for bad killers and sometimes for good killers on bad maps. I dont like dcing no matter what so Ive been stuck on lerys with billy wanting to die the whole time. I was running speed add ons so my chainsaw was useless. If I had ruin maybe that wouldve been better but still. If Im wraith without ruin I will be beaten almost no matter what unless I have good addons. It sucks
---
Strange, considering the first post was along the same vein... why did they get upvoted by the commiseration was downvoted?
---
Reddit is weird
---
Is the perk rework coming out with the dlc?
---
Wait, your "source" is a Bricky video? Like, I like Bricky and all but he's not a dev. That's like citing an article about a study, not the actual study.
---
Billy mains who still manage to clap survivors on Lerys are a force to be reckoned with
---
No way, they won't add ANOTHER clown into the game, whats the point?
---
They won't
---
Everyone knows a generator takes 40 seconds solo w/ toolbox (no BNP) and repair perks while Hex: Ruin is still intact by hitting Greats, it's literally outlined in percentages on the wiki.
---
If you honestly think otherwise, you're naive.
---
That would be too hard of a condition for WGLF to be useful. There are so many games that one person is targetted all match and is never capable of doing gens, but they deserve the bonus. A killer has to be either really bad or against really good survivors to not get a BBQ stack.
---
Please...
---
Well fingers crossed for Pennywise on my part. Seems like BHVR is aiming for newer properties as of late.
---
So he‚Äôs the worst killer in the game when I get 4Ks in purple ranks?
---
I was about to say it needs that sound effect for 'the evil'.
---
It's fine, I don't post much on this subreddit so I wouldn't have known
---
The first one is a steve perk
---
Either you forgot the /s or the fact that Hillbilly and Leatherface exist in the same game.
---
I'm not. Glad I don't go insulting random strangers. Here is a well deserved down-vote good sir.
---
Is it out on Tuesday in Australia or Wednesday in Australia?
---
Gotta make her worse than legion so legion is technically stronger
---
I mean, you're playing a video game, is not like you're building a house and not getting paid.
---
But the killer hair on Steve
---
You can use mine
---
I think they need a rework instead lol
---
I don‚Äôt want it for myself, I want it for a friend who has no DLC for dbd who just started and he likes stranger things and that‚Äôs why he started playing.     I hope I win! Good luck everyone! (my friend and I are both ps4 btw)
---
It sounds like you spent the beginning of the game trapping and not putting pressure on the survivors - remember to get started on your gen patrol right away, set traps on the way
---
If you give them space, they will rush to get the gens finished
---
MoM Charges should be for safe hook saves too
---
Every hook is just ‚Äúlets see if we can add one to the count‚Äù
---
Wonder if it‚Äôs going to be $10 like usual or more because of the extra survivor .
---
I love democracy, I love the republic.
---
The emblem system doesn't work super well in situations where the match is imbalanced. To be fair though, if you don't get chased by the killer at all, you aren't exactly displaying much in the way of skill that game. It's not your fault, but that's just how it goes with the current system. One way to look at it is as a measure to prevent people from being hard carried to higher ranks by a more experienced player. Usually you can get enough emblem points to at least black pip from the other categories, even at red ranks.
---
NO ONE ESCAPES NEVILLE
---
It's like 12 seconds per gen added, not enough imo to be with the perk slot in its current state. She works great with the standard m1 build of ruin, bbq, enduring, spirit fury. If people cleanse you don't need to worry about chases, but if everyone stays broken, she has nothing in a chase and is too tall to mindgame a lot of tiles, so being able to work through pallets is immensely helpful. I prefer corrupt to ruin though, as it usually gives me a good idea of where people spawned and helps start a snowball.
---
All totems would be busted. Totems are already incredibly Survivor sided. I think hex totems should take longer. And they should have different Aura colors based on the perk. Half of the time my devour hope will be in The Killers Shack or next to a generator while my haunted grounds is placed in a spot where no one will find it.

I think we're going to live forever is fine where it's at. But it should count all altruism actions. For example healing should count. If anything was to be added... It shouldn't be Aura. It should be something to help the unhooked person. Like hiding their aura or scratch marks for a certain amount of time.
---
The nerf is warranted, but I think alongside that nerf it should had a secondary effect so the addon is more useful. Like decrease cooldown on Feral Frenzy, or regaining the speed boost on FF that was taken away.
---
Look at the rank, and you'll know why. New players make new mistakes. No need to be rude.
---
What about the Dark Man and Gary Sinise from "The Stand". Or a plane and the Langoliers from "The Langoliers"
---
He is weirdly cute. His voice sounds like it's always full of saliva and it makes me hungry.
---
As much as I find this funny (was giggling the entire time) I kinda feel bad for the pig. Seeing that she had a survivor pudding I can only assume she wanted a good strong match. I‚Äôd be pretty annoyed realising that I just wasted my pudding on a team about to DC.
---
What a nice meme Sir!
---
Ooh, maybe we'll get a hotel map.
---
How does the rank reset work? This was my first one. I didn‚Äôt go back to 20 but rather from 15-16 to like 17-18.
---
I use mouse 2. You can react way quicker and I almost never miss great skillchecks.
---
Noed is only a problem for rank 8 and above
---
#SPONGEBOB, ME BOI!

*IM IN THE ENTITY'S RELAM AND IM FORCED TO DO GENERATORS OR BE KILLED BY MICHEAL MYERS!*

And here we thought Nea was the entity, it was baby dweeght all along.
---
Heck, I bought one pack a month just by skipping out on buying chips, and I still have a few dollars left over. I now have all the DLC except Ash, and saved a bit of money.
---
I've done it a few times as Bubba and I piped
---
I love this shit
---
He's pretty good at 3 genning, I always try to keep 3 gens close each other, often times letting survivors take the outer gens and ignoring any that try to lure me away from the 3 gens. So when the inevitable 3 gens comes hitting them all at once with FF puts allot of pressure, letting you down the fourth/third guy while the other 2 are mending instead of doing the gens.
---
Since they have a clown maybe they could do Spider Pennywise to shake up the phobia
---
I second this. And to add on to the comment below, you know how fucking cool it would be if there were certain hallways and rooms in the overlook that would always spawn, and some that would swap out, like in the movie since the hotel‚Äôs layout doesn‚Äôt really work in real life.
---
LMAO, I forgot 'bout them. It is that I really hate the idea of adding IT into the game, I personally dont like IT as the character/creature/whatever it is called. And I really hope they wont repeat Hillbilly/Leatherface thing, yeah. I really do.
---
That's more like a perk
---
This is the most relatable post that has ever graced this subreddit.
---
The dedicated was the same as the one in the last PTB nothing changed they sitting on their ass.
---
I disagree, sometimes it‚Äôs just who ya say it to that makes it good or bad analogy. In this case it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not the dragonball subreddits
---
May I introduce you to leatherface
---
I need his stats.
---
I feel like people really doubt the entity, the entity is not a creature, the entity is a realm, *every map in the game is the entity itself*, that‚Äôs why the maps have variations, it doesn‚Äôt quite understand the world it is copying,penny wise, while it may be god like, is a creature, if penny wise ever did end up in the entity as an enemy, pennywise would be near powerless, the entity can create almost anything it would need to destroy pennywise, or severely wound them at least, while pennywises shapeshiftong abilites would be near useless against an entire plane of existence
---
11 dollars
---
Its 11,99. They confirmed that on twitter
---
Rly? It's that hard to get there in 2 months? I didn't realise tbh. But I play bout 2-6 hours daily but the days I missed add up to about a week and a half
---
WGLF should be survivor BBQ: For every unhook, you see the Aura of the survivors.
---
It was a shitty killer in the first place
---
If they were to do a Stephen King story it would be either IT or Doctor Sleep. I say doctor sleep because it‚Äôs the sequel to The Shining, Danny is an adult, and the movie release at around the same time as the next chapter.
---
Then it‚Äôs not really somewhere new every time
---
I really hope not. I prefer the original killers and we've already had three licensed DLCs this year. I also don't think Bill Skarsgard portrays Pennywise that good. His voice is Goofy and Pennywise is supposed to be a clown appearance to appeal to children. I don't know a single child who would approach the Bill Skarsgard Pennywise. He tries too hard to be physically creepy. Which takes away from the aspect that he's a shape-shifting monster and the clown Forum wasn't supposed to be scary. Now hes just Mr. Jump-scare, loud noises, bad CGI = rule 34 and Archive of Our Own fanfics.
---
Oh well. I guess I can't complain too much or I'll get downvoted to hell and back. As long as we're getting more content I guess that's better than nothing
---
does anyone know if the lore stuff/ battle pass are coming out tomorrow with this chapter?
---
Haha I get it because the quality is slightly subpar
---
Lotta people are saying it's $12, I hope not cause every other dlc has killer and survivor at $3.50, since the chapter is $7. But if ST dlc is $12 that would mean $4 for each character.
---
PAPPERMAN?!
---
It literally just makes logical sense to hook the same person repeatedly lol 
---
people who play with honour rules are bad
---
Looks like kelly from ash vs evil dead
---
In before that guy with the list of similar threads gets here. 
---
But also in about 16 hours from now.
---
I feel like people forget that Bloodpoints are a shared resource between survivor and killer. The very fact that bloodpoint earnings are skewed in favor of killers already ruins any kind of event centered around them, this is why matchmaking is screwed up every time a reason to farm is brought up simply because it's easier to gain the points on killer, hell technically once the DLC comes out, it may harm matchmaking a tad, simply because we have 3 characters instead of 2 to level up and it's simply easier to throw on BBQ and a streamer and rake in nearly 100k BP in a single match.
---
I would rather have a dull totem in a known location *away* from the door. That way anyone working the doors is distracting the killer from the totem, while the person working the totem is distracting the killer from the doors.
---
I'll have literally anyone over pennywise. We already have a clown who is in fact more creepy then penny, granted neither are very creepy.
---
... Or you could leave it the way it is and no one would be the wiser
---
I‚Äôm a killer main but this is actually really good...I could see a lot of use out of someone like this
---
Holy shit I was literally planning on watching this movie tonight and I just saw this comment
---
I just remembered how much I love Connor üôÅ
---
lmao this dude acting like bhvr cares about lore
---
I think Otz is trying to say that a perk's usefulness is determined by its level (tier 1,2,3) 
---
where if you wanted the most of "Discordance" you only really need tier 1
---
but with "Knockout", for example, it's only effective at tier 3
---
For Pennywise I would have 2 passive powers and I'm not sure what the actual power could be. One of the passives would be if you are in his terror radius things are distorted which would help in chases. Survivors would have a hard time hugging walls on loops and may run into things that seem farther away. The other thing would be each gen has a red balloon on it. When the gen is completed the balloon explodes and injures any survivor that completed it. That would make survivors have to choose who gets hurt. As far as a power though. I got nothing.
---
Oho, so you‚Äôre approaching me?
---
Yeah have you seen his new hair? Lmao something definitely killed it
---
I came up with a solution to this issue. I'll post it eventually.
---
Was Freddy just reworked (maybe I just haven't been against him in a match for ages), and what are his rules now? From what I can tell he can hit you asleep or awake, or is it just you fall asleep if he gets too close no matter how much time is left on the timer? 
---
Either way, had a very fun (and scary) match with one, the blood-spewing gens definitely got me
---
 Like what Aerostraits said. The ranking is depended on what you do during the match (both killer/survivor). I‚Äôm sure you see on the left on your screen when you do various action that you get points for them and if you do them a lot you max them out. 
---
To rank up you as killer you need to:
---
‚Ä¢ Kick gens.
---
‚Ä¢ Break pallets when survivors drop them.
---
‚Ä¢ Win chases.
---
‚Ä¢ Hook/sacrifice survivors.
---
‚Ä¢ Use your power and having it being set off
---
I‚Äôm new to being killer so that‚Äôs all I know for now. Also having longer games than short ones help a lot since if your only goal is to sacrifice then you won‚Äôt get emblems to help rank up. 
---
For survivors you can‚Äôt just do gens and escape. You will not rank up. You have to:
---
‚Ä¢ Cleanse totems.
---
‚Ä¢ Heal other teammates/yourself.
---
‚Ä¢ Safely unhook teamsters. 
---
‚Ä¢ Take protection hits.
---
‚Ä¢ Finish gens
---
‚Ä¢ Open gates
---
‚Ä¢ Escape
---
I play survivor mostly so I know more. For anyone else who plays survivor and see why they aren‚Äôt pipping you have to do more than the objective. Stupid, I know, but that‚Äôs how they made the system. I hope they change it but no news on that.
---
Ash was a paragraph, and Nancy Steve and the demo are all in one chapter. This is all after getting clown, spirit, legion and plague.  It‚Äôs not bad to have a small streak of licensed killers which bring more players into the game increasing the player base. And if BhVR‚Äôs track record continues, this next licensed killer ( if it is one ) will be the last one. After that we‚Äôll most likely get 4 original concepts
---
Its sad when they have to camp. I love making people shit themselves by popping up .0002 seconds after hooking someone lol
---
No matter the game, typing "Get fucked" as soon as you hit the post game screen makes you the asshole.
---
What is a unhooked survivor going to do if the killer no longer focused on them? If you hook the same survivor three times, it's 1v3. If you hook different survivors, it's still 1v4. And the survivors you're not chasing are still, as always, on gens until that third hook.
---
Getting the first kill as killer is vitally important to getting a second. You should ideally try to intercept survivors going for the rescue to keep them off gens as well as knocking other people off nearby gens, but if your choice is to chase a survivor with zero hooks or a survivor with one or two hooks... it's clear which one is superior.
---
"IT is stronger than the Entity".
---
Bish, he had his shit pushed in by a bunch of kids!
---
Meanwhile, the Entity OWNS Freddy Krueger.
---
Please let this happen
---
it should just go to 200% like it originally since 
---
1. Survivors just get way less points than killer in general
---
2. The perk doesn't actually have any sort of benefit like the aura reading of BBQ and Chili
---
How do we know there will be another Hallowed Blight Event?
---
Yea sometimes I slip and and get looped or juked and lose my FF, but Pop Goes the weasel makes the 3 gens allot more feasible. I will be trying out Surge when the DLC comes out, sucks that they nerfed the radius to 24m from 32 sadly.
---
‚ÄúYOU WILL RUE THE DAY CARLY SHAY!!!‚Äù
---
You should get stacks for hooking teammates
---
Likely 16 hours after this reply.

Basically everybody passively falls asleep due to micro sleep or him hitting you when youre awake. Freddy can hit you awake or asleep, but can only use his ability to place fake pallets OR slowing snares on people who are asleep. Additionally he can teleport to any gen on the map that is not complete, but has to channel his ability, making the gens spew blood before he teleports there. 
---
Also you cant see him clearly until hes in a certain range when youre awake
---
all i see in this post is excuses and shifting the blame to others.
---
Um.. King never said he hates the book he wrote.  He hates the Stanley Kubrick movie adaptation.
---
I would probably be the girl lizard with a no mither build.
---
As the Plague, can you vomit on hooked survivors so that they'll be broken once they're rescued?
---
if this happens, im gonna flip my shit
---
Change your Steam region to Russia, and it costs $5.
---
Be careful of his flex glue traps, once you‚Äôve stepped on it you can move.
---
The killer loses next to nothing by giving you the hatch.
---
Survs might be facecamped after letting you hook them.
---
Little did anyone know, they‚Äôre actually gonna add Christine as the new killer
---
it happens. i do it all the time with baby nurses, that way theyll spare me when they grow up to be monsters
---
If you said it, you said it. Not much else to it.
---
Turning off chat, PMs, and leaving immediately after games will do wonders for your mental health.
---
Yea that‚Äôs going to be a yikes from me
---
i like how this sub consistently alternates between unedited meme templates, cosplays, and unadulterated otz thirst
---
The survivor could be the guy from Oxi Clean who died way back and they could have Mr Clean
---
That would be sick
---
This made me laugh my ass off, but imagine if you're able to force a person to play a certain type of killer.
---
If they don't have access to that killer it would work similar to killer shards no perks no add-ons 
---
This would be fun as people would have to spend points around various killers and have a pre build already set up üòÅ
---
I said "who otherwise would have escaped" not just literally at any point in the game.
---
When Phil does his mori should he say "I just sawed this survivor in half!" or "That's a lot of damage!"
---
I just can't play killer i can't fund a game.
---
BIG BRAIN!!!
---
It's automatically played in your head while Tapp is screaming in both terror, and confusion.
---
Hehe I know honey! I‚Äôm just messin‚Äô üòò
---
I don't know how to feel about this
---
See you tomorrow
---
Him being shirtless is not sexual at all, it‚Äôs a exhibition of peak human performance.
---
Did you really read it that quickly?
---
Those aint no baby dweets
---
Good job.
---
Change your Steam region to Russia, and it costs only $5.
---
Does anyone have the link to that meme that listed the popular Content Creators' karma that reflected their attitude?
---
I disagree, outplaying the nurse involves breaking line of sight, which is really easy to do on the game. If she charges a blink on the second floor you can run towards her and she can‚Äôt shorten the blink by looking down or she‚Äôll end up on the bottom floor like my clip. The new map might be even worse for her
---
Of course but why would they add the book version? Everyone who thinks of The Shining they think of the movie.
---
yes? your post is like 200 words it's not a long read
---
Plus PGTW can't be taken out of the game, especially if the killer is able to keep up their hooks.
---
Yes which is the time when you will be facecamped since all other objectives are done.
---
If they don't know your "Giving" them the hook, the correct play it to just camp, especially if exit gates are open and survs are sitting in them.
---
All we need now is for him to follow pornhub or something then people can get hyped over the clowns vhs porn tapes lololol
---
That's not true.  I literally just got done giving a Huntress an open exit gate kill because I felt bad they abandoned every single chase with me during the game.  Some of us hook struggling killers up with free kills.
---
rip her survivor pudding and those bps
---
Please Carrie or Jack Torrance. Pennywise makes zero sense lore wise.  Nor does he have an ability that wouldn't be easily telegraphed by survivors.
---
im putting my money on the swedes, no amount of bing bong can challenge that amount of angst and parental frustration
---
As a true Stephen King fan I would like a killer to be cat or the boy from Pet Cemetery. The book is really creepy and the killers power will be to resurrect dead survivors to serve the killer.
---
Jack Torrence from the Shining is a very real contender and he matches what they usually follow in making new killers. There‚Äôs also Mr. Gray, the alien, from Dreamcatcher. He was dead set on infiltrating the world with his race. I‚Äôve seen some good arguments for Carrie from well, Carrie. She‚Äôd make a good paragraph. Personally, I‚Äôd love to see Annie Wilkes from Misery. Crazy nurse rabid fan with an ax.
---
They should release it today
---
Ok, so you're basically just the kind of person who just wants to start a fight? Because I'm not making excuses or blame shifting. I deserve a ban, but not a one week this time, permanent next time. I don't care about the one week part but them threatening me with a permanent ban upsets me.
---
&gt;it's propably not good to have this much of a noob stomper character in the first place
---
I'm not going to comment on the rest of the post, but I will say that any character in this game can be a noob stomper. Opinions like this is what got Freddy nerfed.
---
These people look just like the ones in some video game.
---
It's a fair point but if definitely can be made clear that the survivor is giving themself up, and regardless who would care if they stood at the hook while you died the whole question was that you would give the killer the extra points and not escape just like they would give you the extra points by letting you take hatch
---
What the fuck otz is just a wholesome boy and y‚Äôall being creepy as fuck
---
The steam store updates at 10am PST. Stop asking.
---
Pennywise (books) doesn't translate to DBD in the slightest. He functions on making survivors feel fear and see the things that terrify them the most. I can't see a way for it to be in without completely breaking and being hyper non-conforming.
---
Could someone explain if and how dedicated servers will effect console? Will the game on all platforms share the dedicated servers, or are they for PC only?
---
If you say so
---
I remember the original comment this came from
---
Both are extra-dimensional creatures but the Entity seems to be at least slightly more powerful as it has its own realm of nightmares to influence, to which it can take ideal Survivors and Killers to, regardless of place and time whereas IT doesn't.
---
Two different versions of the game to maintain.  They just got done making everything one version.  They'll never do that again.
---
11am-12pm Est. They always release updates and DLC's on their time. So it'll be the 17th at 11am-12pm Est.
---
Just imagine if you had blood warden
---
I'm not due that IT can't or just doesn't.
---
&gt;  and regardless who would care if they stood at the hook while you died
---
Well you're sacrificing 5k bloodpoints to give the killer like... 500?
---
So yeah, what's the point in that.
---
Killers can still accumulate a shit ton of bloodpoints and give the hatch.
---
That wasn‚Äôt you asserting dominance that was Ghost Face granting you mercy
---
New killer perk-
---
Hobknocker:
---
After hooking a 3/2/1 survivors, you can whisper the definition of the word "Hobknocker" into the ear of a hooked survivor, which reveals the auras of other survivors at any range for 4 seconds
---
I don't mean that you'll make mistakes at the end, I mean that no matter how good you are, you won't have three gens near eachother all the time, no matter what. Its a specific situation that can be good.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Dailys reset at about 2000 EST ...
---
I'm going to assume it's for a film role and not the style he would have chosen on his own.
---
all toolboxes
---
how dare you take money from bhvr, who are perfect in anyway and have a balanced game
---
11AM-12pm EST
---
Gotta love the holidays
---
nice photoshop skills
---
I've seen enough Scandinavian murder mysteries to know how this ends.
---
My proudest creation.
---
Really?? Source?
---
My mental issues part is for the people who read this, and explanation of why I'm so upset.
---
Taking into consideration the fact that they are gonna reqirk some maps, the fact that she has to refill everytime and maps are gettong bigger and bigger, they might consider making huntress a 115 movement speed killer. I think she deserves that.
---
Ruin isn't meant to be up all game, its only purpose is to stall enough till the killer gets first hook
---
When you play killer you can determine how good your match will be based on how quick you down the first guy. If you're chasing 1 person, 3 others are doing gens with nothing else to take away their attention. That's all they can do (besides loot chests/ break totems)
---
Against a good team, yeah ruin is pointless, but it's sometimes enough to secure that early game foot in the door.
---
I wouldn't use it on killers who have no trouble with pressure, like Nurse or Billy. But on killers who need survivors moving around the map or something (Huntress/ Myers) then it's useful.
---
I mean consistently, sorry about that lack of context.
---
Don‚Äôt have bbq  ;(
---
I think end screen will say you lost a pip but when you get back to the main menu you will still be the same rank as before.
---
What time is that Eastern then?
---
This is going to inspire toxic survivors to complain about ‚Äúlet me pick the killer‚Äù
---
Who's the killer?
---
To be honest I dont play againts a legion in months fucking devs and their nerfs
---
Lol seriously? I thought this was a joke, how the hell did I not know about this? Is there even a benefit?
---
Distortion also counters BBQ
---
Oh awesome thank you &lt;3 that answers another q I had too about the clocks, wasn't sure if there was just one he could easily patrol because that's all I saw for me
---
There isn't enough players at the moment for this kind of separation.
---
It can take up to half a hour to get a killer match right now, if we split the player base that could double wait times.
---
Great play, the ace must of crapped his pants lol
---
You lucky bastard
---
last online: 5 Years
---
DBD doesn't have a population big enough for separate queues and the "ranked" system is not a real one anyway, stop treating like it. Just act like every match was casual (which pretty much is). 
---
Even if some regions could have separate queues, DBD is a global game and this system would negatively affect some regions more than others, preventing people from playing in both queues.
---
I had it on Myers before I prestiged him. I should‚Äôve grinder for Max BP first
---
Except that can't work, because you'll have a 115% nurse that doesn't blink, or a legion that doesn't frenzy. It doesn't work, and I've sat and thought about that for a while how this could be doable without overhauling the entire game.
---
Add ons could be all the body parts that have been collected
---
Oh my GOD
---
I hope you know that chasing the guy with BT and DS off hook isn‚Äôt what it takes to win tho lol. A lot of killers do that then complain that the perks are OP when they lose
---
It's so underrated. When he yells at the fridge he becomes my favorite actor
---
Thing is the people it works on are likely the kind of people you could've beaten without ruin anyways
---
Sometimes you want to do it to activate certain end game perks, or you've just accepted defeat and want the survivors to fuck off.
---
What about healing another survivor to one health state alongside the safe hook rescue?
---
They're not necessarily more rare, it's just that when you factor in map offerings, bloodpoint boosters and items and addons, there are such a hifi amount that the chance of a green node being a commodious is a 1/34 chance of being a commodious compared to the 1/11 for a specific purple on one of those nodes.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of Blood points!
---
Please don‚Äôt eat my ass spirit
---
Trying to survive is toxic ofc
---
"I got banned cause I bully to cope. Why would the devs single me out like this?"
---
Dude come on. You KNOW you said something you shouldn't have in the past, and now you may not act that way anymore, but you still said it. Everyone is held to the same rules, no one is exempt.
---
You can vomit on them, but they will only start off at base afflicted status when they are unhooked. They won't gain any extra affliction if you continue to vomit on them.
---
I'm on drugs rn .. rip
---
Probably not gonna be penny-wise a much more Well received cult classic and all around amazing movie is getting a sequel so here's to hoping it's Jack

Such a pure and holy man he is! Dressed in his Sunday best!
