They're quoting the OP, not you.

---
---
why would you use deerstalker with freddy????????
---
Free yourself from hook
---
freddy has some pretty god damn amazing builds for the killer that he is
---
oh god
---
sluggin time
---
So... are you going to learn how to get better after this change, or be a crybaby over it? 
---
Devs have said DL will remain active
---
I never said that all 4 people are going to have it and use it, but at least one survivor is going to have it in basically every high rank game. 
---

---
It's weird that you seem to argue that it's both a good perk that shouldn't be changed, and one that a "good" killer will be able to completely circumvent. If that's the case shouldn't it be changed? Maybe to something that activates as the killer is picking them up, but with a different activation clause...hmmm. 
---
Y‚Äôall: Dodge because swf is ‚ÄúOP‚Äù
---
Me an intellectual: Dodge swf because the BP grind tuff out there and I don‚Äôt always have time for a match I might come out of with 16k.
---
What Ive noticed is that survivor mains get really annoyed when BHVR nerf a perk that has no 100% to counter it so they complain that a killer perk also need to be nerfed cause it has counters as well as more downsides then the survivor perk in question. But as I killer main I can say that this DS change was to much, DS needed a change, but I wasn't surprised, cause everything BHRV touches after its release either gets really really good or really really bad. A good example might be Surveillance which went from the worst perk to one of the best. But it makes sense why people complain. It is asymmetrical and if you only play one role it doesn't seem fair, and that is why so many survivors complain, they see that DS gets nerfed, one of the better perks for survivors so their reaction is to get mad/furious and in this rage post about a very good perk for killers. It all makes sense, Survivors like DS and killers don't, and killer like NOED but survivors don't. 
---
When it comes to the other nerfs to survivors/ buffs to killers you mentioned. It seems to me like you are the opposite of the killers you talk about, ungrateful. When it comes to healing, healing went by to fast and it fixed an issue that has been in the game for a while, self care. Self care has always been the best survivor perk in the game, and now you can run it if you feel like it, hit change made the game a lot more team reliant which I think is a good change. When it comes to looping changes, i agree with you, they balance a lot of the game around bad players. The problem i have with looping is how easy it is, if looping was harder and you were able to loop the killer forever if you were skilled enough then I would be fine with it. Totems has always been  problem, and by changing around the positions it doesn't do a lot cause after a few weeks everyone know most spot again. And then you talk about BBQ, a perk that was implemented so killers would have something else to do other than camp, plus there are 7 counters to BBQ, and Nurses which is also very easily countered. When you talk about slowing down the game I guess you mean ruin which is one of the better killer perks and the reason is that a lot of killers like Michael or Trapper need the perk, cause they have a very weak early game. You also come of as not that experience when you talk about how annoying Ruin is, cause in reality doing skill checks is very easy. And Legion need to be removed, no argument against it. I guess you can say Rancor counters DS but not 100% there are ways to go around it. "tons of exposed perks" I can agree that exposed isn't very fun but a few of them are nice. 
---
TL;DR: A lot of what you say makes you sound just like the killers you describe, ungrateful.
---
Elephantly soft?
---
I didn't copy it I just used the format
---
Omg.
---
For survivors, Gideon Meat Plant.  
---
For killers, either Haddonfield or Autohaven Wreckers.
---
We meme, gen jockey, and teach Borrowed Time to everyone else while rarely using it ourselves. That's... about it. 
---
Dailys reset at 7pm EST, that‚Äôs why
---
Like on of the Working Joes.
---
The reset is midnight GMT, I'm assuming, which just passed 4 minutes ago.
---
Ok. That's why then.
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
Learn nurse.
---
So much more fun and rewarding.
---
can't or won't üò§
---
Cav killer when?
---
Clown cause
---
Hrmph 
---
Cough cough
---
Scream 
---
Ahahhahahahahahha
---
but why? hes just as loopable as any other m1 killer the way he is, his chainsaw doesnt really help that much in getting looped, reducing his movement speed would turn him into a hag without traps, a huntress with hatchets, a god damn legion without feral frenzy, he would be total garbage.
---
Dumb claudette you‚Äôre supposed to rage quit as soon as you see no skill legion 
---
Doesn't Freddy see your aura if you're outside his terror radius? Insidious for vision of everyone in dream state, op op
---
I put up a big ass list for you up there. All of these combined together did a number on the dynamics of DBD. Changing DS just added more to the pile...
---
Listen, we all know the nurse is at the top of the tier list in dbd, but hear me out. You ever seen her break a pallet? Yeah she doesn‚Äôt even touch that shit.
---
Now imagine that, but it‚Äôs your spine. 
---
Nurse is simply too OP. 
---
I know ds your friend
---
why hes just a downgrade from billy
---
If I had ds, then yes
---
I need a new flair. 
---
"Shine that fucker where I'm working!"
---
Can we get the OG pic?
---
This is unrelated, but you missed an opportunity with your user name. It could've been "Bill Mori". If you're not going for that, fair enough but it's just something I couldn't help but say.
---
Some NECA figure killers would be awesome
---
That does sound like an easy fix for this problem...
---
But knowing BHVR they'd poorly have killers lose all collision from the start for about a month.
---
good riddance
---
&gt;Hillbilly takes absolutely no skill
---
And with that line you've lost me.
---
WE WILL! WE WILL! FARM YOU! 
---
Lol I only turn the farm on if 3 people loaded or someone dced early. Then its a rough farm. They dont realize im farming just getting two hooks and instead of last hooking them leave them on ground. Some catch on to it but its only if they initiate it after that. If they play normal so will I. 
---
See but no one can tell if your joking because the killer mains complained for so long about DS that they finally got their way but when survivors complain about noed the devs don‚Äôt see it as an issue 
---
First of all, addons are meant to be powerful. 4 blink nurse, infinite tier 3 myers etc. 
---
Im not saying there is no problem with Legion, he is fucked entireally, but in no way comparable to NOT BEING ABLE TO GET HIT FOR THE ENTIRE MATCH.
---
&gt;There is no such thing as "salty survivor" with me you little bitch so watch who you talk to like that.
---
Oh fuck, this dude is gonna come buttrape me over the internet. Better watch it! Fucking degenerate.
---
Chastising people is not how you get them to agree with you. Neither is mocking them, belittling them, or, perhaps more importantly, doing any or all of those things in what is apparently an overemotional tantrum. 
---
Me: sees a full lobby of flashlights-laughs in doctor-
---
I had a stroke reading ‚Äúlithe, albeit‚Äù
---
It's funny that you list these changes as if they are bad things.
---
I get the impression you don't play Killer.
---
Or you could just, y'know. Play the game normally and see if it makes that much of a different in the PTB before making huge assumptions.
---
More a thing for the people who believe a shitpost on reddit has and credit. (Rhyming not intended)
---
At least there's one voice of reason I can count on here. Thanks, Bill. 
---
Yeah but That's the problem. H√® Will insta-down you if you're in the open so pallets really are his only counter. The fact that h√® doesn't get affected by pallets to much proves h√® needs the 110% speed to be balanced.
---
If only it wasn't shining in the right place... 
---
Nurses Calling is 28m, Heartbeat 32m btw
---
When you want to use a funny screenshot but can't think of a good caption
---
That‚Äôs exactly what happened. Lower ranking players don‚Äôt know how to deal with certain killers like Freddy or Doctor which makes them very powerful there. It‚Äôs absolutely astounding that the devs nerfed him because of lower ranks getting demolished, and guess what, he still does good in low ranks. 
---
This has a really weird quality to it that reminds me of r34.
---
Yaaaaaah, it‚Äôs haunting time
---
The gfuel is the clue!!!
---
A doctor but instead of a heart beat for a terror radius, it's dummy thicc ass cheeks clapping.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far. He‚Äôs a dev
---
Bubba always had a tie. His family were inbred hicks, but they dressed like gentlemen. 
---
Lol
---
Instead of making Huntress 115%, make it so her hum isn't directional so that you can't tell from which direction she's coming. Because of her hum being directional you can't really mindgame loops too well.
---
I'd say Clown is fine as he is, I'll agree with the direct hit bottle thing, at least make him more fun than he is. He's so boring.
---
Instead of that trapper change, make it so he starts with multiple traps from the start. His bag add ons would make it so he has more of them. That way he doesnt have to waste 2 minutes setting his stuff up.
---
For Pig making her beartraps less Rng dependant would go a long way. A lot of times survivors get them off on first box. Instead of % chance of a key on each box get less boxes(number increased with an add on) that contain a piece of the key. Lower the number of boxes but increase the search time per box. 
---
That way she still delays the game but isn't tied to bs RNG.
---
Ok
---
I'm going to use that for my Steam name, thanks 
---
Get pizza Dwight on the other leg
---
Nice guys maybe? I'm not sure 
---
this is cool as fuck!!! 
---
I must demand sauce from you sir.
---
So cool
---
Not gonna lie that's pretty damn awesome.
---
No. It doesn't really fix any issues.
---
When my swf tell me to bring in a flashlight I just use it to light their gen. 
---
Good killers don't even run NOED, so I beg to differ on this statement. It just helps bad killers who are the likeliest to use it.
---
That‚Äôs Legion. You can get safety pips or even single pips just by one hooking everyone and just stabbing everyone else. Iridicent Malicious and Chaser and bronze Devour is a single pip every time. 
---
For sure. 
---
i snickered and my mom asked why so i had to explain to her
---
I feel like it'd be a better fit for Small Game just like the Totem counter (and extra defense) is tied to TOTH for Killers.
---
Pretty good job, so far.
---
Don't you stack for taking a hit for a survivor being carried?
---
Dunno why you're so upset that we did a low budget cosplay bro
---
This. 100% this. You have to seriously mess up or otherwise the only ban if from a SIE report
---
I always thought it should've been a thing on the Game. I just like the thought of not being sure if you can crouch fast enough and trying to decide if you want to keep running or slow down to maybe get away.
---
I'm not. I really don't give a fuck. Someone said they wish they could do something. I told them how to do it. Idk why you're so thick in the head.
---
then why did you bring up pallet vacuums like they were a nerf and not a fix
---
I might never play DbD the same way again after scrolling though this sub holy shit what have u done
---
Can you honestly tell me that Billy takes skill, and i don't mean having 10 iQ to know to Use it for patrolling gens.
---
The nurse has to aim where She blinks Well, the spirit has to guess and mindgame the survivors, the huntress has too aim very Well to hit her hatcheds.
---
If you are bad with them Then  you Will lose since the player is required to Use their power, their "skill"  if they wanna catch survivors.
---
If you are bad with billy you won't be as punished since he's able to become a m1 warrior, Which means h√® doesn't have to rely on his power, Which means h√® takes "no skill"
---
It's like you're intentionally forgetting he has a chainsaw
---
If they were to add something else noed would become even stronger as totems would be even more time consuming due to the other objective. It‚Äôs a smart decision in terms of game balance to make totems a slightly more important objective, which adding a counter for everyone, without the need of a perk would do.
---
I disagree with not trapping pallets, it really depends on where you put it, a general rule of thumb is to keep your traps hidden unless you cant
---
Say goodbye to your gd kneecaps
---
Excactly, I think he wouldn't be "that" bad if there was actually some sort of a perk that enhances mobillity on certain situations. Clown for example is someone who'd benefit a lot from this too.
---
Honestly they should just overhaul agitation. Remove the terror-radii boni and make the speed-buff persist for a bunch of seconds after hooking someone in my opinion.
---
That looks really cool! If I ever get a DBD tattoo I‚Äôd probably want the Rancor icon
---
This is too good
---
another example of the devs just not paying attention to their own game
---
The shard to perk ratio is complete garbage IMO. Back in the old days I played enough to get 1 new perk every week, sometimes enough to get a new DLC perk. 2000 shards is way too much for a perk, I‚Äôm only using bloodpoints for perks now.
---
downvoted for toxic DC
---
if you're lagging its your own fault for staying in the lobby with the ping you have, 100 percent OPs fault here
---
Is that a JoJo's reference?!
---
RIGHT!? i really think this console ban talk is a scare tactic, i really am believing that
---
IIRC it depends on how big his Terror Radius is.
---
If you run Distressing or are in a chase with M&amp;A, IIRC, Tier 1 will have a noticeable Red Stain.
---
Your dad sounds like a mean drunk
---
It's not a fifth perk slot, if you play with NOED you are forced to play whit 3 perks for the entire game, and bringing other HEX perks just harm you. SO when you run NOED you only have 3 perks to begin with, you cannot use perks like Ruin to slow down the game and if they find your totems you just fucked yourself. Now lets say the killer doesn't have NOED, it doesn't harm you that much to do the totems. I myself would rather finish the gens after cleansing all totems and then realize he doesn't have NOED then to not to them and realize that he does. It all comes down to "Am I willing to do the totems if he has NOED or just say fuck it and do gens". It's like chess expect not hard, in chess staying ahead of your opponent is a big part of it. You want to be prepared or block certain moves the opponent can do. It's the same with NOED
---
A category for giving props to the other team would be great. I hate dB events that have 4 streamers and a mori.
---
Take a shot every time you read NOED
---
Ooooga booga booga booga!
---
Kinda, yeah. They don't even want to think about the admittedly harder objective once the opportunity for a pretty much free escape is there. 
---
No it was a joke sorry didnt read your post if you look below a little I made a comment on how ops account seems like an alt
---
'dumbtuck'
---
Better if is deleted
---
If you think it was "buffed" to a Hex totem, you're insane. It was a huge nerf (which was understandable, bc god damn it was powerful before)
---
Ace: "Return the medkit or suffer my curse!"
---
Leatherface: "Make me!"
---
Who cares? The day I can't play with my friends is the day that the game loses at least 4 players plus many many more. The problem is killers seeing it as a divine right to win the game - who cares who wins or loses, we just want to play. 
---
Just ignore them. I've walked to the other side of the map, came back, got screamed at that I was camping post game.   
---
I usually reply with something like "Good luck next game." or "Hope you have fun in your next match" these guys feed off salt and being trashy people. Just hit'em with a GG and move on. If you are having fun and playing the game as intended. Fuck'em. :) 
---
IM WHEEZING LMAO
---
That‚Äôs how mafia works
---
unless its gonna cost them a hook state, I would cleanse a hex totem right next to them first, if the killer knows the totem is there they know its gonna get cleansed so they will come back no doubt. Dull totems however will come later.
---
Dont worry there's a totem over yonder you can cleanse ;) 
---
..I'll see myself out 
---
NOED and Ruin aren't broken at all...in any way. I play 100% solo survivor, and whilst the game can definitely be annoying sometimes, I would never blame it on Ruin or NOED. Most of the time when I join a game, Ruin gets destroyed pretty close to the start of the match. And if it is still standing for an annoying amount of time, all you have to do is power through it...most people don't stuggle with great skill checks anymore, so it's pretty easy. NOED is pretty much the same deal. Assume every killer has it equipped and destroy every totem that you see. A few seconds every now and then isn't difficult. When I'm ultra suspicious that a killer has NOED I just wait until the last gen is nearly done and then go for a scavenger hunt throughout the map, whilst keeping track of all the broken totems I've seen. Of course, I'm not omnipotent, so it still pops up here and there, but it's not hard to handle. If someone gets hooked, search around for the totem before you go for the save. 
---
Oh, *and* if that's still not working for you, there's a pretty niche perk called "Small Game" that helps you find killer totems, traps and stuff. It's pretty handy when you want it to be.
---
we are overdue for the chapter 11 teaser and there is an injustice towards our comrades 
---
Some people like to play as Freddy Kruger. That's fair...that's fair, you do you.
---
But this guy seems to main Dunning-Kruger.
---
Choosing Claudette has made u a terrible person
---
This is hilarious! I really need to buy Michael on PC. XD
---
Meme builds just don't work as well on PS4, where there's no post-game chat and no way to edit your username. :\[
---
But pallets and windows are literally designed to be the counterplay to killers. Killers are 10/15% faster so if you don't use windows and pallets then of course you will go down. That's how the game is designed.
---
That plus getting to a hook probably puts it closer to a minute, either way I didn‚Äôt want to spend anymore time in that game
---
Get better at the game 
---
I agree. In my experience they just end up traveling around it, and it usually makes for a massive loop because trapper can get stuck in his trap, but if you place them where they can see but still near the pallet, I guess that can work.
---
The most annoying thing is having your traps disabled.
---
Im actually really haopy about the change as a survivor main who gets tunneled hardcore but I dont want to get slugged becuase of this :( 
---
Some aspects of it can be scary etc. tier 1 Myers, Prayer beads Spirit, The Pig. It just takes a bit of getting used to.
---
Before you commit to P3‚Äôing your favorite survivor/killer, consider getting some to level 40 for their teachable perks. The best perk builds consist of perks from each killer. Self-Care would be the top survivor perk, whilst BBQ &amp; Chili would be my pick for killers.
---
I watched the whole thing and it gets better and better, god tier survivor not even joking.
---
If you‚Äôre a killer and you dodge a lobby you‚Äôre a pussy. 
---
Because this is a fuck-your-skillchecks Doctor build. 
---
&gt;Who cares about NOED? Did I mention NOED???
---
Now you can't be as stupid as to not realize the comment you replied to, right?
---
And it absolutely is more balanced then ever. Lets take a look at things that are no longer in the game: 
---
* Infinites
---
* Sabo destroying hooks
---
*NOED being overpowered
---
* Machinegun builds
---
* 4 Man D-strikes
---
* Sprint Burst coming back mid-chase
---
* Brand New Part
---
* Trapping underneath hooks
---
* Facecamping
---
* Instablind Flashlights
---
* Swamp
---
* Autohaven
---
I could go on, but I'm not. Look, I can tell you haven't been around long, but trust me, this is the most balanced it has ever been.
---
It took 4 against 1 MORE than 10 minutes to kill them.
---
"Just get better" isn't a real argument when the game is fundamentally designed so that competent Survivors are more in control than Killers.
---
Just because survivors were getting nerfs and killers were getting buffs doesn't mean DS was okay. It punished the killer for winning the chase by just deleting all the progress they made. It was a broken perk that rewarded bad survivors, and punished the killer for playing well.
---
New DS atleast punishes the killer for playing poorly (tunnelling). And helps the survivor deal with something out of their control (being tunnelled).
---
Either way, DS was a not so well designed perk and the proposed change is so much better than the current DS.
---
Me: ‚ÄúGross‚Äù
---
Thats just survivors being used to having it too good.
---
Oh, don't worry, IMO most Jeffs are fine!
---
It's the ones who were already P3 like a week after he released, constantly try to get me to chase them, and t-bag every pallet that get my goat.
---
So in terms of scary, there are some jump scares sometimes if you get snuck up on. 
---
But my advice, 100% unironically, is wait a month. The next dlc is out next month, and wait and see how it changes the community, rn the dbd community isn‚Äôt in a particularly good place (spend 10 minutes in the subreddit you‚Äôll see) and if you start now you might get a bad taste for the game that could ruin it 
---
SWF leaving sounds like a wonderful fix to me.
---
This really strikes my decisive.
---
I think that's the point where we're just going to fundamentally disagree. It's like when an event comes out and for the first little bit everyone is doing anything but gens (or event gens), it's important for us to chose what we want to focus on. Surviving, and countering anything the killer may bring to the best of our ability? Saving our teammates, making sure they have a chance to get out? Doing gens? It's our choice, which is why I believe totem gobbling should remain a surv's choice on an individual level; similar to bringing BT or whatever.
---
I've literally never seen a leather face face camp. Actually,  I think I've maybe seen 3 killers in my last 100 matches face camp now that I think about it. I play around rank 5 to 10 so maybe it's different,  but I almost never see what you people are constantly complaining about happen...
---
I run DS all the time and very rarely get slugged. Even if the killer doesnt have enduring
---
I thought the drop priority bug was only when you used it to prevent getting a flashlight blind drop, not DS?
---
Get ds use verse friend. 
---
Please don't strawman me to death, nobody is pretending that every SWF is a NAVY Seals team, just that voice-comm programs suck some fun out of the matches for killer players. They're not insurmountable challenges or something, they're just *less fun* to face. 
---
Mount Ormund
---
Both are given a ‚Äúsurvivor release prompt‚Äù, thus, probably works the same in both instances.
---
In my experience the trick is making sure that they're out if position first. 
---
If I pick up the survivor without making sure there isn't someone else right next to me, I get blinded and frankly I deserve it. 
---
If I know they're closed but it'll take a second for them to run up, that's usually enough time to get control back.
---
Chasing Dwight and I. I came across these two and pointed at them. She killed them, then killed the Dwight for using DS and then she let me do two gens and get the hatch. 
---
Glad I could help in some way!
---
I hope you have fun playing Freddy. &lt;3
---
Pallets and windows are extra safe against Billy, he won't have time to chainsaw you and he will be forced to m1 you instead.
---
&gt;you're gonna be exposed to a potential chainsaw if you leave the loop, you're gonna wanna stay there for aslong as possible
---
Yes, but that's the point of the loop. Keeping the killer inside of it for as long as you can without going down.
---
&gt; since h√® has 115% speed he's gonna force you out of it 
---
So you can loop him like any 115% movement speed killer like Bubba, Trapper, Wraith etc. so that he has to M1 you and his chainsaw doesn't get used? That's the point, you can loop the billy like other 115% killers, he's balanced by that. If you make him 110% his chainsaw doesn't help him in the chase like Spirit's or Huntress's would, he'd be garbage at looping.
---
All 110% killers have a power that lets them play around the loop the 115% killers don't have. Billy doesn't have that sort of power, his power gets stopped by vaults and pallets.
---
I understand this logic. But if we apply this logic to survivors, Bill must be the most powerful survivor, seeing as how he didn't come with a killer. Therefore Bill must have killed the killer he was supposed to come with while being transported to the entity's realm. Easily making him the strongest survivor.
---
Hi
---
Thank ya. &lt;3
---
Well that bild usually drags game long so wouldn't ruin get cleansed super fast?
---
This hasn't happened, but honestly I would be delighted. She looks funny, but she's trying her best to experiment with different styles outside of her comfort zone. I'd encourage her that her hair is very unique, and that her dress is stunning (is that Valentino? wow!), and to keep exploring her personal fashion.
---
But whenever I tell people to get good, their feelings get hurt and I get downvoted.
---
Couples who kill together stay together
---
You can‚Äôt waste time checking everytime you down someone though. 
---
Yes, the Legion Legion is always excepting new members!
---
^(As long as you promise not to play EVERY match with Frank's Mixtape. :p)
---
Which is hilarious because if they put pressure on the gens they can force the killer to move. 
---
I had a match against a survivor who saw me at hatch and so he started doing gens. Really close match because he would switch from gens to making hatch attempts. Really fun!
---
There's a 0% chance that would ever happen. Game's players would be less than half what it is currently. 
---
Tbh SWF is more fun to play against. Solo ques suck cause atleast one DC is almost guaranteed
---
Immediately surrender and walk to the nearest hook tbh
---
Why should the burden of inconvenience be on a stranger for you wanting to play with your friends and voice apps the game isn't balance around? They're not my friends, they're yours. If anyone is going to be inconvenienced for using voice boosts, shouldn't it be you and not a stranger just trying to enjoy *their* night? 
---
This. 
---
I just think some survivors are lazy, tbh.
---
Sorry if I wasn't clear but I don't mean like 10-15 second checks. I normally do a fast 360, depending on the surroundings I make a judgement call but the general idea is "can a survivor get directly in front of me within 1 second?" 
---
If I feel like it's a no I go for it. If it's a yes, it's because I see them being too close and I go for a bit instead.
---
You aren't. Looks like Lightborn is back in my builds i tell you hwhat.
---
Oh ok I got you
---
I‚Äôm really sorry but can someone explain the bee killer to me?
---
‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt ban all of us‚Äù you sir, are a fucking genius.
---
Oh cool!
---
How did you make the costume?
---
Oh i agree. But just because there are a lot of SWf doesn't mean its a good thing.
---
And to each their own, I prefer to not play against Discord cheaters. They DC just as much as solos, too.
---
I was under the impression the game favors giving you dailies for whichever side you don't play as much.
---
More like /r/dadbydaylight 
---
The strong point about facing Freddy is that you can‚Äôt actually see him without being asleep. I think he still needs a rework though 
---
Protip: If three people are in the lobby waiting for a forth, there is a glitch that will prevent someone from joining in the last spot, you could be waiting for a long time for that spot to be filled. The quickest way is to dodge and start a new lobby.
---
Besides that, if I see 4 people load in at once and I'm not playing my best killer, fuck that, I would like to have fun too you know.
---
&gt;as do all killers
---
Besides Legion, pepeLaugh
---
That was nice of them!
---
Shame about the sucky teammates tho. :p
---
I'm still angry they actually kept the exhaustion changes related to running. The only perk that needed it was Sprint burst, but for some reason they've felt all of the perks needed that treatment.
---
Well you could juggle or just let them hit it and chase them and hit them again because they‚Äôre still hurt (and exhausted if they have that) 
---
Sans clown
---
I had one session where I played solo que since none of my friends were on. Three games in a row atleast one person DCed. Decided to never do that again.
---
Imo, I don't mind playing against SWF since it is after all a teamwork oriented game, which means that if people want to work together and be coordinated that's alright. 
---
(Plus when I play solo que as a survivor the other survivors are alot more selfish and will either leave you on the hook to die or farm you when Bubba is 5 feet away revving up his chainsaw)
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
How do you pick another character by accident?
---
Oh god give it a rest with the third party bollocks, I'm just trying to play a game and not have to wait an hour, nothing more nothing less. 
---
I am flattered that she dressed up and wanted to look her best to murder me.
---
Nice!
---
I'd argue Lithe is worse just because it's horribly buggy, but Spring burst encourages stealthy-walking-everywhere playstyle so I'll agree with you on Sprint burst.
---
You don't want it. 
---
I once had a doctor I had looped (and not once teabagged) tell me to "kill yourself" after I told him "Js, your add ons don't stack"
---
What's r34?
---
Does the right one say 'China' on the third line?
---
^(Also, that's a top tier desktop background.)
---
Billy is the most played because he is the one who has the best chances other then Nurse. If they nerf Billy that means all you will see at high ranks are Nurses.
---
They need to buff the other killers into viability.
---
I need to check that now.
---
Please, elaborate further. What's the advantage? 
---
If it's having more people then that's kind of the point of this game, survivors have strength in numbers while killer is strong on his own. Of course they'll have the upper hand there.
---
What about normal EW 1 radius and scratched mirror?
---
üò±
---
Yes he needs for a proper curving 
---
Literally just found out their group is called "The Entitled Elite" lmao. 
---
Ok. That the default? Or is it possible to change it?
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
It is a teamwork oriented game, but Discord is cheating, hardcore. I do not wish to play against players who are most likely cheating. So I will keep dodging. You do you though.
---
Ok. That I do know
---
L2 and R2 switch characters
---
Imagine telling the tattoo artist about this though if they don't know about DBD. Did you bring them a picture or something? Or did you just go and say "Naked ghost lady with hair floating in the air defying gravity and she's covered in wrappings, Oh and also she has cuts in her body and some parts of her body are completely cut off but they just float like normal and also she's covered in shards of glass"?
---
How is NOED bad on freddy? you already  loss too much time waiting for them to sleep, if you have to hit them twice they would run half map to the gate for free before you can't do shit.
---
\&gt; be me 
---
\&gt; buy DbD with friends  
---
\&gt; should check the reddit for a subreddit
---
\&gt; oh found it 
---
\&gt; see this meme
---
\&gt; 10/10 would laugh again
---
Well, I P3‚Äôd him asap, but I mainly run the P3 head with either the Death Metal style body or the Wolf t-shirt one. XwX 
---
Wholesome  &lt;3
---
at least he has one...
---
How are you doing that in first person?
---
They need to rework billy‚Äôs addons definitely. Insta-saw is bullshit. It removes all skill from backrevs
---
Well then cleansing totems isn‚Äôt really a counter because sometimes you can‚Äôt find them all 
---
Unless you're running the addons that decrease dream transition state by quite a lot, you still usually have to put them to sleep and then catch them, on top of hoping they didn't do totems or they aren't already opening a gate. Just usually does not work out well, most other survs won't even be that afraid to rescue since you'll have to put both to sleep to get them down.
---
Oh I know you will not get banned for it. But using comms gives you so many extra advantages the game was not balanced around, I cannot see why people do not think it is cheating. You are using a third party application to give you an advantage over the other side in a supposedly competitive game.
---
I don't really care if you do it, but call it what it is.
---
yeah but billy is seen as the 2nd best killer in the game by many. reason being is his map pressure and instadown which he doesnt need add ons for.
---
Why do people keep saying the new killer is a bee?
---
I get juggled every other game at a minimum. (At red ranks).
---
If they can't juggle what else are they going to do? Slug.
---
Id say WGLF is easier as you can just jump in front of the killer to take a hit \*ding\* unhook even if its unsafe \*ding\* body block while they carry \*ding ding ding\* (if all 3 there)
---
Third party application on a server hosted by BHVR who decides what is cheating and what is not...
---
Just google "joe the people follower"
---
The better answer is who cares, you wanna face camp one person while everybody else does gens, so be it. The only people that get mad are the ones that are first on the hook. I had people DC just because I knock them down within the first 30secs of the game.  As a survivor if I see a person camping I go do a gen or two by the time I go for the save we already have 3 gems done 
---
Is this a new feature? I‚Äôve played this game for months but I stopped 2 months ago
---
Lots of people surprisingly. Just had a game where a David stepped in 2 of my traps in a row and DC‚Äôed
---
Mozzie's a boy but Ace is a MAN'S MAN
---
Heh
---
I dont know honestly I hadn't paid attention to patch notes till recently and I'm just kinda eh about the whole thing. 
---
That's around the time it was added. It was in the last update
---
i had no idea bout that, i thought he got banned off ps4 by sony itself i didnt know the dbd devs actually banned him thats good to know as far as a working system in place for bans but i personally haven't seen any legitimate reports actually make any difference on the people i have reported
---
I'm insecure
---
Yup.
---
At 110 he would be looped to death
---
They can't handle your big dick energy and have to disconnect before they implode.
---
I got Moro‚Äôs by red dress Lisa, I was disgusted and couldn‚Äôt watch and looked away... and I was super salty just because I got Moro‚Äôs by a hag in a dress 
---
Im sorry can you name some examples? I play killer a lot and I cant think of many
---
I didn‚Äôt read most of your QQ because it‚Äôs obvious salt and troll bait. I will say this, you‚Äôre getting mass downvoted for obvious reason. Plain and simple, DS was unfair. The BIGGEST problem with it was there wasn‚Äôt a fucking counter for it. I don‚Äôt know why this is such a hard concept to understand. Enduring, dribbling, slugging; none of this was a counter. If they would have made the perk with a legitimate counter, killers wouldn‚Äôt make a fuss about it.
---
Any big name streamer will say this. Even AngryPug, a salty and huge survivor QQer makes fun of people that use DS. That‚Äôs saying a lot. Most decent survivors who don‚Äôt use DS are apathetic about it. Whose crying? The small percent of survivors who relied on it. There was nothing fair about the perk. Good riddance to this shit perk.
---
we should all just report these people
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No, that's now how that works
---
I have said it for ages, totally agree.
---
You're better off finding Atlantis
---
So there are no good killers, just bad survivors? That's straight up not true.
---
You can turn up to ZubatLeL's or ScottJund's killer stream and see them 4K almost every game. You can then check out some bottom level stream and see them lose games over and over. 
---
By your statement it means that those first two get very bad survivors almost every game, which is straight up delusional.
---
Who wouldn't?
---
Yeah. Or we can let killers keep their addons
---
Yes but 110% isn't THAT slow which is why we need to still test it on a ptb.
---
Honestly there are points why h√® needs 110% and points why h√® needs to stay the same so let's just agree too disagree on this.
---
yes because any survivors that uses cosmetics HAS TO BE in a swf 
---
Alright.
---
Hah yea ruin getting done fast when I‚Äôm a survivor 
---
Killers have this weird mentality that any survivor that uses a bought cosmetic automatically means they're good at the game so they dodge for "easier" games. 
---
I've been meaning to watch that movie, you just reminded me
---
Pre workout is a myth and that's a fact, post workout is the shit
---
*ENHANCE*
---
No matter how they are game balance wide the look of the Legion is definitely one of my favorites in the game, this looks really good!
---
You can see up her ass too when she hooks you, obviously they never put a butthole there but uhhh... ya..
---
That's bizarre if true bc I am just a bad dbd player who loves to spend money
---
If I were the killer I would honestly kill myself
---
You can?
---
I'm not seeing an ass jiggle
---
Ok Jasmine on Discord, play in red ranks and tell me who has the power. 
---
Really? Have you seen some of the players they played against. Please enlighten me, tell me who has the power in a chase. 
---
wait there was a skill gap and ability to mind game in friday the 13th as well 
---
not to mention that the survivors all play differently thanks to their stats where as in DBD all survivors are the same since perks are not limited to just 1 survivor.
---
the jasons all play slightly differently as well. 
---
the big difference between this and friday is that friday lets you fight back against jason and it is less forgiving. if the killer catches you in dead by daylight you get hooked and can be rescued
---
if jason catches you in friday the 13th you immediately die
---
You just saw a very clear example in the clip above. This buggy hit type alone happens rather often.
---
No
---
Gotta have that small FOV or it's too advantageous-&gt; not a joke played a game as clown with M&amp;A and well I could almost see across the map 
---
Shirtless David makes me feel impotent 
---
After the initial pallet blind he could have looked up and block the flashlight from blinding him again, but he's dumb and chose not to do that impossible feat.
---
Truly tragic, there was NOTHING he could do there.
---
would be cool as a gamemode for a little while
---
That's interesting.
---
##E X I T P O R T A L

Good lord üòÇ
---
This is both the kinkiest and scariest shit ive ever read
---
Oh lol
---
You don't mention NOED *by name*, but you were replying to someone talking about NOED, and your first two lines are obviously replying to a comment made about NOED. Step up your game.
---
On console people hardly ever message you to say good things.
---
So I‚Äôll pass.
---
&gt; self care 
---
&gt; necessity 
---
Really tho?
---
Because it can't possibly get any better after witnessing it?
---
Or it's a bad luck like spilling salt or walking under a ladder?
---
Yeah he sucks. 
---
..it‚Äôs totally not me c.c
---
Nice. I need to get m&amp;a on Michael. Though I do want to prestige first.
---
It sounds like you weren't playing when insta flashlights were a real thing. To answer your question, you down survivors near a wall to avoid the problem entirely, or you chase off other survivors flocking to their teammate to attempt a save, and potentially get another down.
---
I think I've encountered this kind of killers. Basically you have to use the other exit instead of the one he guards. But if you use the exit he guards then you're asking for it. 
---
id give this 5 unfunny "nea is a killer" memes out of 5
---
memes aside it's pretty good art
---
Lol. I like your reaction. I just didn't realise r34 was rule 34.
---
That must have been an awkward conversation.
---
True. I'm not really sure how to balance this to be good perk.
---
This would nerve other survivor perks, and you generally always know where your teammate is when they‚Äôre being picked up anyway
---
Yes but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about in my example, they are separate. Sorry if it didn‚Äôt translate well. 
---
Or the doctor, legit I just got out of a match where a doctor hooked me and camped the whole time, using his shock therapy anytime he thought someone was near. It sucks because I was using Escape! Cake and someone else used bloody party streamers, of course we got a camper which gave us barely any blood points 
---
Ah I assumed you took the hit on the way to the hook, healed and then unhooked for the three stacks :') Makes sense now 
---
Even if you looked up to dodge the blind, a blind at pallets is already really good. Flashlight saves are still viable, just people don't know the timings so I guess it's bad according to people lol.
---
I don't comprehend your argument here. And no problem, was a dope clip xd.
---
In my experience they usually play like douchebags. Following you around all game, clicking flashlights, unhooking ppl 2 seconds after you hook them, etc.. Their just kinda annoying. The guy version of a p3 claudette lol...
---
Oh my the memories xD
---
Lolololol holy shit 
---
I don't understand why you keep bringing up ochido... Like what does he have to do with this???
---
Then fuck off and give up simple
---
Yeah I guess
---
I don't give up.
---
Yes
---
Grow, Adapt, Overcome? 
---
perks and power seems a bit too OP for my taste, and some of the perks and a bit of his power relate back to the doctor.
---
Oof too real
---
Depends? If you want to make it to end game DS DH adrenaline balanced landing. If you want to farm points self heal and any farming perk.
---
&gt;On long loops he can 90 degree turn around obstacles using the second of free control he gets at the start of his chainsaw.
---
But you are a smart survivor and know that he can do that, so once you see him getting into that distance you drop the pallet and get to the next loop.
---
&gt;who doesn't expect it.
---
How is someone not expecting something/lacking game knowledge a good argument for something being strong? Just as the killer gains knowledge on how to play billy so does the survivor learns how to play against it and expect it in the future. This is where skill and predictions get involved.
---
Godly Soft.
---
Your chances to survive is higher the more survivors are alive.
---
But if you want to be selfish then you have no one to blame but yourself when you get killed too. 
---
If you're playing solo survivors above R8 or so, it is absolutely a necessity. So many survivor players are braindead at those ranks, and trying to get people to heal you is a huge waste of time.
---
I don‚Äôt believe this Tuesday, but real soon 
---
What other use would flashlights have if they removed the literal only utility they have left?
---
I can do 1/3rd of that after I get Spirit lol
---
Oh I'm sorry my bad my bad. I thought we just making shit up abs pretending the other person said it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
&gt;Logical fallacies
---
How often do you win arguments when you bring up fallacies???
---
I honestly just want you to realize something before we go any further. You're a huge dork. UH OH AD HOMINEM! 
---
I said fun, not hard.
---
I see you're one of those Davids who blew up gen when a Jake was working on it. Understandable. Been there, done that. Luckily the Jake I was with didn't mind. 
---
Suggestion to me and you: stop looking at Jake's face and look at the check skill. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying remove flashlight saves; I‚Äôm saying I would like to be able to move my camera during a pickup animation. If you can only get a blind when the killer is locked in place you shouldn‚Äôt use a flashlight 
---
I completely agree with healing contributing to bloodpoint gain.  Also, adding aura reading for the unhooked survivor would help give a safe rescue.
---
My first myers game i didnt know that his lunge was shit in tier one so i got screwed lol
---
I'm going to prestige him next. I am at prestige 1 level 50 for Billy, Trapper, and Doctor ia at prestige 1 level 44
---
Wait what happened 
---
Clearly. Nurse is the only killer who has an exception, Spirit to an extent. Survivors have the power to determine how long a chase is, bad survivor = short chase, good survivor = longer chase.
---
Pallet blind runs out half a second after the pallet is broken, if he looked up he wouldn't get blinded for over 3 seconds. You don't get any distance in half a second of a blind.
---
He has ears to listen for footsteps so you don't even gain distance with flashlight blinds at pallets. You look up and listen. It's not that hard. Pallet blinding does nothing.
---
Am I the only one who lets people farm when they use a party streamer? I mean its an easy win-win.
---
Ever picked your item back up? It doesnt just disintegrate when it hits the ground..
---
Except Franklins is only situationally good and is often taking away a much more generally useful perk for the killer.  Killer is only going to bother with it if your survivor group is stacking items.
---
Oof at least you know what rule 34 is
---
A fellow spirit main. Rin is best girl &lt;3
---
You dONt nEeD To TAkE A pERk tO CoUNtEr NOeD
---
But they can turn off chat
---
Ace gang unite!
---
While I agree that it's annoying, you should probably chill out.  But the white ward being countered by Franklin's is one of the dumbest things.
---
Are... Are you trolling me? Holy shit I hope you are. 
---
Bad killer = longer chase, good killer = shorter chase?
---
It works the exact same way the other way around, killer skill absolutely matters. I don't know what are you getting at.
---
No I think your just a moron who seems to be missing the entire point of my comment,
---
..unless you‚Äôre unable to blind a killer if they‚Äôre moving? And your insulted? 
---
I love the new D Strike change.  Green Mori, Dying Light + Enduring.  
---
But on the other hand, items would be basically invincible (careful how you read that one, I didn't say that it would always work against the killer) until the survivor either used it all up or dropped it/gave it to someone else. I get the frustration with losing your item due to a perk (I've had it done to me), but killers and their perks are meant to be stronger than survivors. That's what the whole asymmetrical aspect of this game is all about.
---
It could be, but it is all just speculation/rumors at this point.
---
Do you ever go to Ohayocon! I think I've seen you
---
Lmao edit 3
---
&gt;Makes a post about something and is blatantly wrong
---
&gt;Switches to a second account and gives himself good to make it look like people agree with him
---
&gt;‚ÄùEveryone disagreeing with me is a baby killer, I‚Äôm done with this game‚Äù
---
You won‚Äôt be missed pal 
---
&gt;But you are a smart survivor and know that he can do that, so once you see him getting into that distance you drop the pallet and get to the next loop.
---
Pretty optimistic of you to assume you can get to another loop every time if he literally just saw'd a pallet you dropped down. Or, if you drop it as soon as you get to the pallet, you lose in the end game because you're wasting every single pallet.
---
&gt;How is someone not expecting something/lacking game knowledge a good argument for something being strong?
---
Because arguing with a "every player plays perfect" viewpoint is stupid when talking about a video game. The Survivor *could* expect it and not run to the window, but the Billy *could also* predict that prediction and down them anyway. Or just straight up react to the change in movement. If you argue perfection then Nurse hits you on every single blink because she's playing absolutely perfectly.
---
Or in FPS games, let's take CSGO as an example. The Deagle is the best gun in the game because you just headshot them on every shot. Also, bloom is irrelevant because every bullet will go into the middle because the RNG is perfect. Or Overwatch where Tracer is garbage because you just auto flick the same frame she blinks. Also, aimbots are pointless because you just aim perfectly anyway.
---
Arguing in an "everyone plays perfect" sense in video games is pointless. No one plays perfect so you don't assume people play perfect.
---
&gt;So does any 115% and 110% killer, so I don't see a problem here.
---
???? Yes, every Killer does. Billy is good on long loops *and* short loops. That's the point.
---
Someone had a bad match against franklins, calm down dude, noone uses it anyway
---
Lmao, I also just found that our myself :p
---
I mean it‚Äôs basically glorified caffeine, but it does more or less what it advertises 
---
Gotta slow the game down just a lil bit
---
Nah it's a bug that happens once in awhile 
---
God this game is perfect. 
---
It‚Äôs called a joke ever heard of one? All the downvoters are the salty ones, although legion is pretty annoying :p
---
Good spirit/nurse = shorter chase. No other killer can deal with pallet looping.
---
Plebs got GotY :) 
---
I mean, ‚Äúmany‚Äù he‚Äôs unquestionably the second if not best killer...
---
Last I heard about that, they were launching the beta back in December. Have you heard any more recent news about it?
---
And while I'm looking forward to it, there's no way I'm going to pay to be 'Gatekeeper Myers' for a few games. :p
---
The initial argument was that Flashlights were bad and not worth running, a waste of a slot. So what are you getting at...?
---
Sorry :/ I know it sucks but it is pretty rare 
---
&gt;Pretty optimistic of you to assume you can get to another loop every time if he literally just saw'd a pallet you dropped down. Or, if you drop it as soon as you get to the pallet, you lose in the end game because you're wasting every single pallet.
---
But that's dependant on your skill level. If you know how to run the loops properly and how to be efficient with pallets is one of the most (if not The most) important thing to master as survivor. If you don't know how to loop the tiles then yeah, you will not last for a long time. That's not a problem with Billy, that's on your skill as survivor.
---
If we are designing balance based on player's mistake then we're not really balancing anything. If you base everything on players running it as mindless drones then you won't get anywhere.
---
Yes he has more options than a basic m1 killer but that doesn't make him broken, if you make him 110% then he'll be bad on both short and long loops, but I guess we're only looking for any argument to nerf Billy now so I guess this is enough.
---
https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/10/10/psn-online-id-change-feature-entering-playstation-preview-program-soon/
---
The full rollout is scheduled for early 2019
---
Yeah talk to BHVR abt their ideology of ‚Äúnot every killer needs to be top tier‚Äù on that one. 
---
I get that some killers may end up being a bit better than others but when you make some that straight up suck and some that are really good, you‚Äôre gonna have an issue of play rates the second you reward one side more for winning
---
That's kind of the eternally revolving circle when it comes to high ranks. High rank survivors are, well, high rank survivors, and killers pick the best stuff to go against them (the two best killers). Then the high rank survivors either bring their best stuff to combat that in turn, or whine and start to depip into lower ranks. 
---
It doesn't help that other killers aren't as viable in rank 1, unless the survivors are boosted af or make a huge mistake for some reason. I don't like the devs' thinking with "not every killer needs to be rank 1 viable". Every killer should be viable at every rank. Full stop. 
---
I was like oh cool an across map nope just an insane lag spike 
---
I always want to play against a shirtless David, especially when I'm Myers. I will doge if you are with three flashlight Claudettes. 
---
You replied to me randomly about random information... Is your IQ low? o_o
---
My problem with BBQ is that it's essentially a 5th perk, because there's a compulsion to play around it even the killer isn't running it.  While being so ubiquitous that you're better off just assuming that the killer has it.
---
Yeah. That's the main reason I'm prestiging.
---
Accurate 
---
I read what you said, man, but I‚Äôm saying the devs have confirmed it‚Äôll remain active (unless I‚Äôm just being dumb at 4 in the morning &gt;_&gt;)
---
I think people get annoyed by Billy because he's so popular, so people ask him to be nerfed when he really just needs insta saw taken away.
---
Well you also get that with some other perks like Nurse's calling or Noed. 
---
It's just something you have to assume people have. I see your point tho, it'd be nice to have any sort of an indicator.
---
T1 with monitor and abuse and scratched mirror gives me a fat erection.
---
Replied to you randomly? You posted a clip and then even argued about it once I have responded to it. Don't try to pretend the whole conversation didn't happen, you can scroll up a bit and read it again.
---
Flinging ad hominems won't get you anywhere.
---
Fun to read, but what?
---
......stalk me pls
---
 You absolutely need to learn how to 360, you won‚Äôt always have a loop nearby but you can always 360.  However higher rank killers can sometimes predict 360s or just wait until they have a guaranteed hit so don‚Äôt expect it to always work
---
I mean you can kind of say the same thing about any perk whatsoever
---
‚ÄúOh you can‚Äôt survive a game/get kills without _____? Work on your fundamentals!‚Äù
---
I mean you‚Äôre right I‚Äôm not arguing that point but if you‚Äôre gonna say it about one thing you gotta say it about the rest
---
Oh you can be creative as hell, but if you don't spread out your points by doing gens and rescuing others, you will not pip.
---
. Yes, unfortunately
---
2. Can't speak for this, it really depends on your region and what time you're playing at. Personally queue times have been better since the lunar event
---
3. They don't really get better unfortunately, even at rank 1 you'll have survivors urban evading and crouching around hooks instead of doing gens
---
4. Yes it's worth learning but don't rely on it, it should only be used as a very last resort when you're out in the open and are 100% guaranteed to get hit.
---
5. Ruin is pretty necessary if you're playing a killer with low map pressure, especially with how fast gens are done. 
---
Give BP/shards by rank, maybe a shirt or something. 
---
Did you make this OP?
---
Yes. I've always wanted to be punished by 3 hour queue times for being good at the game when thr majority are mediocre and I have to wait those 3 hours only to get a boosted noob that tunnels and face camps 1 person while the rest escape. That sounds like soooooo much fun! 
---
Guess I'll need my /s because everyone here is so asshurt and takes every single little thing literally.
---
Maybe it's because no other Killers are capable of swaying the outcome of a game like Billy and Nurse. That, and most people who actually *want* to be at the red ranks are competitively minded, so naturally they run all the meta perks with the two best Killers. Whereas less competitive players will use other Killers with non-meta perks because they care more about just playing than pipping.
---
Damn when did the survivors start rolling with the killer like a gang running down the street? This game just got lit! 
---
Gotchya. Thank you so much!
---
^(NGL tho, #3 is kinda triggering.)
---
You talking about the possum in the garbage?
---
The similarities between DS and NOED are stronger *after* these new changes. 
---
The thing about NOED is that you can't tell if the killer's running it. Survivors have to cleanse dull totems *just in case*, even if the killer doesn't have it.
---
With old DS, you could usually tell when a survivor had it. New DS doesn't give any indication until it's used. Killers have to avoid tunneling *just in case*, even if the survivor doesn't have it. 
---
They were never meant to be. Killers should be OP in comparison to a survivor. It is 4v1 after all.
---
&gt;hope that they'll end up buffing other killers to bring more variety to matches
---
You'd have to do soft-reworks on every Killer to bring them to Hillbilly status. (Nurse status would be op). You need great map-pressure and great chase times in order to be a good Killer. There's no way to do that with small buffs.
---
To fix this problem all they need to do is make the game slower so you aren't required to have both. (Gens take longer or add mandatory side-objectives).
---
&gt;And make the coldwind tiles not see-through.
---
Agreed
---
Anyways, good night. Have a good day tomorrow! :)
---
That's literally a symptom not a valid reason. If they gave people a reason to reach their proper ranks, it wouldn't have to be that way. 
---

Disabled? I'm pretty sure you can go pick it back up and have enough uses out of it to make it worth bringing. Considering that toolboxes and Prove Thyself are the new sub-meta, being able to take that away is something the Killers should be able to do.
---
I'd say spirit is better than Billy against good players. 
---
You can loop a good Billy, you can't loop a good Spirit. With some add ons her map pressure is comperable to Billy.
---
Oh I‚Äôm throwing the BS flag and I would tell MCOTE to his face he‚Äôs full of shit and a little bitch with a shitty coded game! Then see what he says, probably be the same bs that he said before like in his interview ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve done a good job so far‚Äù 
---
&gt; I learned how to hold a flashlight and get fucking yelled at.
---
Refined palette for memes I see.
---
You might not be, but someone certainly is. You just got shafted.
---
I rarely bother going into Red ranks anymore as Killer, as there is no point, I just play for a few days, get to like 5-4 and get frustrated with facing the same DS/SB(or DH)/Adrenaline survivors every game.
---
I play alot of different Killers, so those sweaty Games are definitley not worth the struggle for me
---
If you do trap pallets, trap one side or the other. Middle they can just throw the pallet onto it. 
---
And if you're in a level with a steep incline like stairs, putting one at the top can catch them off guard. 
---
Dad: "Shine the light over there."
---
*doesn't tell you where over there is nor even a general direction*
---
You: *shines light anywhere, it doesn't matter*
---
Dad: "no! Not there üò† Go help your mama in the kitchen, I'll do it myself"
---
hello fellow classic halloween movie fan. :D
---
I stated why flashlights are not strong. You posted the clip of the pallet blind and I've replied to that.
---
I've listed counters to flashlights in a reply to that clip, which was the context. If you take out the context then many messages lose their sense. I don't understand why you are doing that.
---
So I Hooked Green Next To A Gate Then Red Finished The Last Next To The Other Gate So I Rushed Over To See If They Where Working On Door, They Where Not So I Knew They Where Going For The Save.
---
I assume that with Enduring now, it's around 2 seconds. So, with it being reduced to 3 seconds, it'll be around 1.5 seconds unless they lock in that stun time regardless of if you have it equipped or not.
---
R/deadbydaylightSALT
---
I just introduced my friend to this game. He thinks it‚Äôs funny to teabag the killer outside the gate. I think it‚Äôs hilarious when he gets slapped with NOED.
---
I warn him every time he does something toxic/dumb. I hope he never learns his lesson. 
---
It's never in the right place.
---
Your dad only says that so he can have a reason to get rid of you so he can enjoy his alone time.
---
While I agree that most Killers deserve small buffs (especially the directional-humming for Huntress) it won't fix the problem. Making them more entertaining to play would increase diversity for most ranks, though. (Red ranks will still be Nurse/Hillbilly territory).
---
The time of the game is the thing that prevents Killers from being fun. It's just too stressful to lose 2 or more gens before the first down, even if you play optimally. Ruin is pretty much a mandatory perk for high ranks since those players will instantly go on a gen instead of dicking around.
---
Also, yeah, if they slow the game down I'd imagine they'd nerf Ruin or rework it.
---
Even a bad killer can land a hit and finish a chase eventually, a good killer just finishes them sooner. 
---
You realize that you could possibly get 4 Obsessions in one match, right? Each time DS would be used, a new Obsession would be selected and DL would be turned off. 
---
No.. you replied to me saying flashlights aren't bad... what are you going on about.. If you're stupid I'm going to insult you, stupid people are annoying. You'd hate to be my lab partner. It's not a discussion also, I gave my opinion and you went off on a tangent when I wanted no part of it...
---
Most killers high rank run noed. I never used decisive don‚Äôt even own it. But my god the amount of time half my team decide to be altruistic for the last guy left behind gets them all killed
---
The secret move is when youre on your last hook to loop back around pick up your item then jump and stay in a locker until they pull you
---
They're being compared because Decisive Strike got its long overdue nerf, and survivor players are upset that big brother didn't get his toy taken away, too. Their complaints are punitive in nature, it has nothing to do with balance. 
---
We all gotta die sooner or later. &gt;.&gt;
---
Exit doors were open, I fully expect camping at by the killer at that time. Prolonging the game is always a bit fun and more challenging and can either result in no kill for the killer or he can down even more people, so it a risk. Every killer and every situation is different. The question is, do you feel bad about it? I think it‚Äôs fine. 
---
You're not required to unhook people, but you'll potentially screw over your team by not helping. Yeah, it sucks being the gen jockey when you don't want to be, but someone has to do it.
---
I was under the impression that if you used DS, you became the obsession?  
---
[My "tangent" is a direct reply to your clip.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/343893170049908738/549087075559931905/unknown.png). If you didn't want to talk about flashlights why did you post the clip and then reply to what I've said about pallet blinds? You took part in the discussion and now you're saying that you didn't want any part of it. You are straight up lying at this point.
---
You are ignoring how things have happened and just insulting me instead of responding to the arguments, that's called ad hominem. That's just being rude. If this is how you act towards other people then I don't think it's worth having this conversation with you anymore, have a nice day. 
---
You did nothing wrong. There's not much else for the killer to do at that point. 
---
Sometimes I try and do ill advised saves after the gates are open and end up dead. That's on me
---
As a survivor, you are the last one that should complain about losing an item. You guys can just 1% all your equipment and still keep it if you escape the trial.
---
No thank you.
---
Explain to be how flashlights are a joke.  I just started using them and I've gotten like 10 flashlight saves and countless chase escapes at pallets.
---
I hope you aren't specifically targeting the Survivor side by making them seem childish. If they nerfed NOED but not DS (and even specifically told you they wouldn't nerf DS) then Killer players would be pissed too. This is expected.
---
You shouldn't be a game dev if you didn't expect some sort of small uproar if you nerf one side and leave the other alone. In an asymmetrical game, nerfs/buffs need to come in pairs in order to make your players content.
---
People who are complaining about *this* nerf *know* DS is op and needs a nerf. They just don't like this change. It has glaring issues that need to be addressed.
---
DS and NOED are comparible in the fact that it's so fucking annoying to play against either. "Oh, I finally downed this guy but he got his free escape." "Oh, the Killer couldn't keep up with gen pressure and now gets a free kill." These perks are both trash game design. It doesn't matter whether either are op or not.
---
Had a game like that today.
---
Got lucky and had my first hook in the basement. Placed my only trap in hand at the corner fern next to the pallet then walked off to patrol gens. He got saved the instant I walked away and caught the saving Survivor in that trap. Back to the basement.
---
I didn't get a chance to walk away this time as the first guy never left the basement. Downed the 2nd again, pulled the first out of a locker, and placed a trap at both doors. Out in the open. A 3rd person walked right into one as I just walked away. 3 in the basement now. The 4th soon after found my only other random trap.
---
Got called a camper to boot. Survivor quality seems to have dropped horribly if they can't just run in circles all game.
---
Hah
---
It happened again. 2/5 of my killer games have gotten stuck because someone crashes. Ffs.
---
R/spotthemobileuser
---
Good onya
---
Madness level 4?
---
Dwight and Mike
---
T R U E. And he has High Tops...
---
Also,I love how your description/bio is the definition of Vigil.
---
I've said it a billion times so I'll say it again: Billy has an instadown, massive map pressure, and a fast pallet break for literally no downside. Nurse has no instadown, slightly higher map pressure (when compared to Billy), and the ability to ignore pallets. Billy has 115% and Nurse has 97%.
---
Billy should at **LEAST** be 110%. He gets to move at a slightly faster speed because unlike Nurse he doesn't flat out *ignore* pallets but he essentially does along with all his other upsides.
---
Nurse is balanced ~~(her concept honestly isn't and there are tweaks that could be done to make her feel more fair and be less of a challenge to play)~~ but Billy honestly isn't. While Nurse has counterplay and is worse than default if played by a bad player Billy is better than default if played by a bad player because of his fast pallet break, and his instadown + map pressure aren't that hard to learn either. You don't have to be the strongest to be the most broken.
---
Smol pp. 
---
I imagine a lot of people will back you up. Loads of campers around here.
---
Out of all the things,Quentin is The Savior which I love. (I would've said The Insomniac but Savior sounds better)
---
Stinky leatherface. So stinky.
---
Steam menu (Shift+Tab) have a force quit menu now if you too lazy to tab out to task manager :D
---
It‚Äôs so triggering I can‚Äôt. Why do people like this even exist... 
---
You played so well tho! I would have just DC tbh
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for pharmacy to pop up again‚Ä¶ üíÄ
---
You don't really need fast reaction times to play this game, I mean you might struggle hitting great skill checks or be a bit late on dead hard but it's nothing too serious and won't really impact the game.
---
You can absolutely enjoy the base game, in fact if you're playing survivor you don't really need to buy any dlcs, if you like certain licensed killers like Michael myers you have to fork out money though.
---
Wait times aren't really an issue if you're playing survivor, it may be kinda long for killer in the new player ranks (20-16) but it shouldn't be an issue, especially if you're not playing at like 3 am. 
---
ironically I've only ran into like 2 hardcamping leatherface's. The killers I notice facecamp the most are Clown, Pig, and Wraith.
---
Exactly my memes eloquence usually transcends most people‚Äôs simple minds /s
---
I like the tits part
---
Legion teasing a killer that resembles a survivor has me thirsty for a paranoia killer. Like has mind control or copies them completely like The Thing. 
---
What are you opinions on swf? 
---
Bill is so powerful he completely escaped consoleland. 
---
2000 shards isn‚Äôt that much. Easily obtainable in like 8 hours
---
How dumb do you feel. Poor thing. Good luck with everything bud. 
---
Ya know, I'm not surprised that there is a porn subreddit of dbd, but I never really wanted to see it...
---
My curiosity got the better of me
---
Couldn‚Äôt understand what order to read screenshots in
---
Have one person in your group run distortion.
---
Be warned this game has a huge grind aspect to it and you'll be going against people with experience and better perks/items for quite a long time. If you can deal with that then just play and have fun.
---
There no change, just sometimes you‚Äôll get thrown out of a chase not not get you‚Äôre speed burst
---
What makes DbD fun for you?
---
For real? I didn‚Äôt know his lunge changed on evil level. 
---
How much of a difference we talkin? 
---
Same here. Went killer and suddenly my game crashes. Offerings should be burnt post-game. 
---
The big issue with this game is the low skill floor for killers, especially when compared with survivors.
---
I agree it‚Äôd be initially, but after the novelty of playing in first person wears off, people will stop using it because all it does is really gimp you and put you at a huge disadvantage.
---
There needs to be a reason to use it to give it a purpose other than just checking it out or nobody will use it more than a few times.
---
Xavier Woods killer when?
---
Also, I *think* T1 doesn't have red flashlight strapped to his head. 
---
You played amazing,  but damn life isnt fair apparently. Fuck those people
---
Honestly, just doing relatively well. I don't think I need to aim to escape every time. Pretty unrealistic. But I at least want to try and even get to the point where all gens are completed with most of my objectives done; such as totem-cleansing and healing. I like to run perks such as leader and vigil to make things a bit easier for the other survivors when I'm playing solo.
---
Running the killer is also pretty fun; I usually run dead-hard and dance with me for that. 
---
It just seems it's not as fun to do anymore because most killers at my rank don't really seem to have much fun with it. I don't expect them too but it kind of sucks to see wraiths all the time with NOED.
---
I'm rank 13 right now btw, rank resets pushed me back to 18. Highest I've ever gotten is rank 5 and I had fun up there
---
I have so much trouble understanding why people have issues with NOED and Dstrike.  We should all be upset by dying light and Franklin's, because they were invented by a Dev who tortured animals as a child.
---
Lisa is so ugly she ends up being cute in her red dress. I also love her lettuce costume. Poor Lisa. She‚Äôs tries so hard to look nice for the survivors. 
---
She was no where near others as far as I know? I‚Äôm fairly certain they were SWF and they knew I was chasing. 
---
Like I said, perfect game. 
---
Looks like something out of Darkest Dungeon
---
Doors open, all bets are off. The end. Why would you walk away just to be cucked by borrowed time or the million other perks?
---
Trying to explain what happened is pointless to toxic players. Just gg and leave. You‚Äôve got nothing to prove. 
---
Multiple pp
---
In tier one his lunge is nearly non existent. In tier two it's a bit higher then a normal killers. In tier 3 it's massive.
---
I'm sure everyone come across a handful of killers like that. I've seen many Bubba's that don't do it boringly, I guess my luck just has put me in line with those that do. I'm sure everyone's got a specific killer they've seen do it more than others, just the way it be.
---
Oh... damn. I guess I should YouTube this. Maybe that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt smack him with pallets. Lol
---
I saw you today! I knew something was going on so none of us opened that exit gate, we skirted 
---
It also means that if the Obsession killed themselves on the hook you have a chance to get more stacks.
---
I've embraced it. Not every game is full of thirsty survivors with toolboxes. And I can be that killer that doesn't immediately tunnel one guy and spreads the love evenly. And the bloodpoint gains are nothing to shake a stick at. So many points. 
---
If you‚Äôre looking to killer main, you really shouldn‚Äôt need to worry about pinpoint accuracy, even with some of the more accuracy focused killers(huntress/nurse), hitboxes are fairly forgiving and really the best time to get into the game as killer. 
---
As for enjoyment out of base game, ABSOLUTELY, all of the killers are fun to play as and have different play styles. You can also purchase the new DLC with shards that the game gives you by leveling up your profile(XP after each game, not by leveling up individual characters. And you can get perks from previous killers from the weekly web where 4 teachable perks can be purchased with shards. 
---
And wait times aren‚Äôt bad for killer, if you play survivor you‚Äôll get a longer wait time but it‚Äôs never to horrendous except around event seasons. If you are on console you‚Äôll have a longer wait time all around, but if you‚Äôre on PC it should be fairly quick
---
Yeah it'll be best to find a comparison. He also has an add-on so in tier one his lunge is only slightly worse then a normal lunge.
---
I‚Äôm already afraid of clowns. The frosty eyes just make him even more terrifying. 
---
Basic M1 115% Movement Speed Killers are all loopable for the entirety of the game - it's why they're 115%.
---
From someone who's favourite is to go up against the Hillbilly - your mistakes are punished by his chainsaw. (exlcuding instasaw - which i agree is the actual problem) But other than that, he's just as loopable as all the other 115% Killers.
---
When he revs up his saw before a pallet, there's a window of opportunity to essentially juke or negate his sprint pointless. So if you can't use your chainsaw at a loop - what good in chases is it going to do?
---
And if they're able to hit those chainsaw downs when they're super hard to - commend skill, and not the unbalance of a character. The Hillbilly is much harder to use than most people anticipate. Imo.
---
The Halloween Chapter or Shattered Bloodline. I‚Äôd probably lean toward Halloween personally, because Myers is soo fun and satisfying to play as. I‚Äôve been loving Spirit too though, and although it‚Äôs not the greatest perk in the world, Diversion is very fun to mess around with.
---
Had the same thing happen to me. I was running bond and escaped the killer the first time and the other 3 survivors + the killer spent 10 minutes walking around looking for me.
---
Pretty gross overall but it was sort of fun hiding from them. Disconnected after getting caught so they couldnt get the points or bbq from farming me.
---
The look of joy on Billy‚Äôs face is priceless 
---
I was also thinking Halloween bc I‚Äôve been wanting to play as Laurie. Her perks seem nice haha 
---
I second the Halloween chapter! Absolutely love playing as Myers 
---
I agree, that there does need to be an incentive to be a higher rank, but i also think that ranking up should be made tougher because their are rank 1‚Äôs who play like rank 20‚Äôs and rank 1‚Äôs who depip to 15 to screw with new killers.
---
This sub is entitled survivor mains who can't handle even the slightest bit of help being given to killer mains. 
---
Then they wonder why their queues are so long or why everyone dodges their swf cancer stack 
---
Damn Im jealous
---
Oh no..
---
Not solo survivor 
---
I do
---
Kek
---
I love the cocky types, once they find out their loopty loops and flashlights won't work, guranteed hatemail baby.
---
Of course it‚Äôs not your fault, I am talking about real dodgers, not people like you.
---
Peekaboo Myers is best Myers
---
And everyone saying they want something like Nendoroid or nothing. I'm just here going "I'll take anything at this point"
---
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt understand this?
---
Stab 'n Slash
---
That is probably much worse than 600.
---
&gt;We saw it go up and down
---
Guess you've learned a valuable lesson today.
---
Bloody Nea seems unimpressed.
---
Boosted apes lol 
---
It's fun to imagine you're Thanos when you play Doctor
---
&gt; Her perks seem nice haha 
---
You're in for a rude awakening. Myers is good though
---
I mean they could be using MLGA to keep track of the ping. It could have been fine in the lobby, and goofed in-game.
---
Tbh I think this would be a good idea. Make them wait 15 minute for every dc . And make the timer pause when not on dbd.
---
Make it so No Mither puts you in third person and grants a bonus 100% in all categories, people who want a challenge will definitely use it.
---
I am going to really enjoy dedicated servers so the killers with very very bad internet will just lag and then complain about it lol
---
this is so true it's sad. I was playing today and I saw a 4 man swf so I threw on the trusty no perk no add-on legion and had 3 Insta dcs
---
And toolboxes let Survivors finish gens they otherwise might not have through normal progress. Perks that reveal the Killer's aura let them avoid running at them when they would have in normal play. Deliverance let's them get off hooks they otherwise may not have normally. Etc. Etc. Etc. 
---
Don't go trying to act like NOED is the only thing I the game that let's o e side have a chance to turn the tables. That's the entire point of items, add-ons, and perks. And end game is when a Killer is at their weakest. It only takes 20 seconds to open a gate. If they're lucky they've got 60 seconds from the last gen popping until everyone is out. So stop crying that you still have to try and just finishing the gens doesn't guarantee an escape.
---
Are you me?
---
Yes nerf Billy  to decrease the playable Killerpool at higher Ranks even more (great idea +1).
---
spirit high key thiccy
---
Noed is easy to counter though 
---
Am I the only one who always goes for dull totems both to prevent noed and to get extra bp
---
Extend the timer a little and let me kick a regressing gen and then it'd be my favorite. :)
---
not gonna lie will smith is dummy thicc
---
Just encountered this guy today. He was pretty funny. Mori'd a Claudette right by the gate as I aggressively pointed at him. Good times.
---
so wait. was he afk the whole game or did he stop trying when everyone left?
---
Send that video to BHVR and they'll get banned. 
---
Scratched mirror at asylum map.
---
the best feeling is seeing a claudette trying to get her flashlight back
---
Mate stfu
---
"Witch hunting" is one thing, but it's hard to call it that with blatant evidence of the entire match like this. The sad thing is even with reports and obvious evidence, it's unlikely anything would come of this. If they want to bully a random so bad, why not invite them to a KYF with this as their challenge? Then they can be scum bags and not get banned for it at least.
---
The whole survivor experience is pretty trash right now. The sound doesn't work, hit boxes are broken, killers dodge every lobby, Noed, 90% of killers have terrible ping (which seemingly doesn't matter since every game lags anyways) and all the usual problems which will never be fixed. I'm taking a break from the game until they add dedicated servers and even then I doubt they'll actually fix the problems with the game.
---
While Nurse just seems pissed at the survivors
---
You were facing some pretty bad survivors then. NOED isn't that powerful if you have a map full of pallets and exit gates powered.
---
I see you're getting downvoted by salty lobby dodging killer mains. Lmao, they deserve to be BMed at the exit gates.
---
Is that whats happening!? 
---
well I mean. it's rank 1. and I did say I left after last gen was done. so exit gates hadn't been powered yet I had a bit of time to play with. even so a perk shouldn't have enough power to grant 3 kills when the match is already over
---
"Not this shit again."
---
Yeah, but don't do it to people who drop connection. If my internet cuts out for a second I don't want to wait that long to reconnect. Make it so if they hit 'leave game', it applies.
---
WGLF and We‚Äôll Make It... god pls no. Then it‚Äôs just gonna turn into a shitfest of who can get to the hook first. On top of that, instant heals off the hook. 
---
I‚Äôm ok with something like kindred for a second or two. Or just killer aura for 5 seconds within a certain range. 
---
This is by far the most accurate post I've seen in a while
---
They may or may not have done the totems, there's literally no way to tell. The same thing goes for the second part. You'd think that, but no, not always. Survivors are lazy and want to win the easiest and fastest way possible; this usually does not include totems.
---
I need this killer in my life
---
I also love going against hillbillys, but trust me the really good ones are extremely hard to loop, since they can turn perfectly over 90 degrees while in chainsaw sprint.
---
I kinda like this idea. I‚Äôve had to leave matches so many times with 0-1 stack. And it‚Äôs because randos without WGLF or borrowed time snipe unhooks... or because the killer can‚Äôt hook anyone. Lol
---
Oink!
---
Don't get found, don't lose your items. Gg ez.
---
Why is Wraith Naruto-running, I thought Legion'd be the type to do that
---
Yea, but it's not constructive. Its complete ludacris. And it's like people are entitled to win at everything they play now. Like I said, I play both survivor and killer. And it's not the game really, it's the community that's broken. 
---
Myers sticks them on the nearest wall by impalement with kitchen knife. :P
---
Or maybe they're newer players trying to win the game the way they think is the best? Not everyone that plays the game different from you is an asshole.
---
true. but regardless a perk that turn literally nothing into a 3k shouldn't exist, right?
---
&gt; Survivor lately has already been pretty unenjoyable
---
Rank 10 must be hard. That, or you don't enjoy M1 simulator/marathon simulator. In the latter two examples, I don't blame you.
---
&gt; Things like The Legion
---
Legion is just another form of Freddy (darn). A killer whose power is interesting and strong, but not quite right in its design. I don't know why people complain about "tunneling Legions" when a Legion who uses frenzy multiple times on the same survivor is just eating stuns like breakfast cereal.
---
&gt; Moris being imbalanced
---
In what way exactly? Moris are in a fairer state now than they ever were. You now have to actually hook someone before you can mori them. I remember the old days of ebony moris and not getting enough points for a pip because you just mori'd everyone. Do you? What other changes to moris do you want? Do you want them only to be available when someone is on death hook? How about you can't use them until the rescued survivor is fully healed and a new chase must be initiated? Will that satisfy you? How much more should killers be neutered before you're happy?
---
&gt; unfun perks like NOED
---
Totems are one of the easiest things in this game to get rid of quickly. Besides, aren't survivors always griping about wanting a secondary objective?
---
&gt; OP add-ons like Prayer Beads
---
I actually agree on this one, though its power is offset by its rarity and the fact that addons are consumed regardless of outcome. Hearing phase-walking is an element of counterplay to Spirit.
---
&gt; Omega-blink Nurse
---
Right, because stealth is such a hard thing for survivors in this game. They'd all rather run marathons around jungle gyms for hours on end. Heaven forbid you have to be sneaky for once.
---
&gt; 90-second exhaustion hatchets
---
Oh no, my precious dead hard/balanced landing. Let's just forget how easy hatchets are to dodge unless you're point blank with the Huntress, in which case, what went wrong?
---
&gt; Against fair killers
---
I really wish this stupid ambiguous label would go away.
---
&gt; killers who don't use OP shit or play like an ass
---
Oh, I suppose that helps some with the ambiguity, but what exactly does this even mean? What's OP shit, and what's playing like an ass? Is "OP shit" using powerful ultra-rare addons that you don't get to re-use, unlike every survivor addon that isn't a consumable granted you live? And what's "playing like an ass"? Is that doing what you must to kill a survivor as fast as possible, rather than becoming an experience curator or tour guide for survivors to ride around like a safari bus?
---
Man I wish people would pull their heads out of their asses.
---
They can‚Äôt do that until they fix the game crash while loading into a lobby 
---
Run Franklin's, completely screws this up for Survivors. But a few tips for mitigating annoying survivors:
---
\-  Always face a wall when picking up a survivor, helps with flashlight saves.
---
\- Never pick up a survivor right after you down them, look around first and see if anyone is charging in for the save.
---
\- Go for the hook first, don't worry about survivors trying to pester you as they carry the downed one. 
---
\- If they're blocking the hook, swing through it, don't drop the survivor and chase them, always go for the extra hits. 
---
They are 3D printed in PLA! :)
---
feng gang &lt;3
---
It shouldn't have turned into a 3k, but that means the survivors played so poorly (not cleansing totems, and somehow three of them dying on hook despite gates probably being opened).
---
At least with ps4 and xbox because there basically the same, PC would be too unfair because of the keyboard and mouse advantage. 
---
are you defending noed? you gotta remember this is multiple 3ks after doing nothing at all. imagine if I had been playing the whole game, as most people who run noed do. it would be virtually impossible to get less than 2 kills a game, making ranking up very easy to do
---
üêùüêùüêùbuzz buzz buzz 
---
Breaking totems is just as boring as doing gens. Its just checking the same couple of spots and holding M1.
---
90% of the times Noed has killed me is because I was already in a chase when It activates. Am I being cocky by getting found? Is running away from the killer toxic?
---
Saying the survivors messed up =/= defending NOED. As if defending NOED is a bad thing, to boot.
---
I could also question how, after a game of literally not being antagonized at all, the survivors managed to take themselves from a 0k to a 3k just because of one perk, especially when a counter to that perk is *simply cleansing all of the totems before popping the last gen*. They literally had all the time in the world. 
---
Nah, Bill got raped by 3 tanks. The Entity felt bad that he got raped so he brought him by himself.
---
"Hand me the, uh, the thing."-  My dad, vaguely pointing at a toolbox filled with all sorts of things and with the last 15 seconds of his patience ticking away.
---
we already have questioned that. the survivors messed up 4 times in a row. ok. That's like the memeiest thing ever "Just Cleanse LUL"
---
Imagine not being so low ranking and having to sit in the queue for an hour just for this to happen. This was infuriating to watch. I hope the ban hammer comes down hard on these bitches. Queue times make me wanna derank but people like that in those ranks make me not want to.
---
Fuck. Daddy can you Mori me? I want that knife deep. (For real though)
---
I thought I was the only one that got a head ache after about 3 matches as killer. Need to play as survivor or I get really nauseous 
---
i did and i already maxed out chase, escape, bold &amp; healing haha
---
It's a matter of cleansing and not magically turning into a potato once they figure out the killer has NOED. Survivors need to play smart. I'm not really interested in your bs.
---
that and i would love for the killer to kill the survivors that do this. i‚Äôm tempted to go afk on purpose and kill the fucker that acts like this lmao
---
I like it!
---
i wish! i try to point at the killer and like ask them to follow me but they never do :(
---
Ugh.
---
You nailed it. This attitude needs to change. 2k without camping,tunneling and no-ed against good survivors is a great win in my book. 
---
No one deserves to get tunnelled and face camped either. Plenty of killers do it because survivors dared to stay alive in a chase slightly longer than their liking. It's a shame you think that way.
---
It's me! Thank you for posting it!
---
You do realize that thats fine and reasonable right, only two people available to do gens while ome is on the ground and the two must coose one to go heal leaving only one person on a gen until they are healed, this amount of pressure can be worth leaving rather than hooking in the right situations
---
Note: this is not my own work, but I loved it so much that I really wanted to share it as I haven't seen it here.

Losing isn‚Äôt fun

That knife looks amazing, did you 3d print it or use something else? 
---
Susie/joey masks are pretty hard to pull off, but I think you nailed it! 
---
There are survivors who consistently stun me at every pallet without ever giving up free hits. They are usually very good survivors overall and it's a pain to chase them. This is just a skill thing. It's something you learn by playing the game instead of blaming it. There is a correct, 100% safe (outside of like a bajillion ping) timing to pallets, and learning that timing makes you a better survivor. Throw your damn pallets earlier. Throw them so early it makes you say "how the fuck did that stun the killer?"
---
If you have this problem more than once in a blue moon, then either your internet is potato or you don't know the pallet timings. It's a three part animation - slide into position on your side of the pallet (1), reach for the pallet (2), throw the pallet down (3). If you hit space late, you're giving the killer time to smack you in the face during 1 or 2 when *there is no stun because your character hasn't even touched the pallet yet*. Being smacked in the face doesn't interrupt animations, so despite already being hit your character continues to reach for the pallet and throw it - too late to do them any good. The solution is throw the pallet earlier so the killer doesn't have time to smack you in the face before you get past 1 and 2 and get to 3. Voila.
---
I'll remember that next time 3 people simultaneously disconnect because of my killer choice.
---
I was the Papa Emeritus with her! ^_^
---
Yeah wtf? He wasn't even being inflammatory
---
r/woooosh
---
They said they were planning to look into the cooldowns because the change hit other exhaustion perks too instead of just Sprint Burst but they never did it.
---
I still stand by my point that they should have reworked Sprint Burst to be in line with the other exhaustion perks (give it a condition in order to trigger it) and there have been many suggestion like this from the community, but so far... nothing. 
---
Do dream demons breath?
---
How dare you, Ace isn‚Äôt a bad person
---
Then why make comments calling me privileged? When I play both not only survivor so get your facts straight. I don‚Äôt care that you speak multiple languages, but when you try to call me out on something you have no basis on and then continue to do so by saying I‚Äôm privileged for playing a game I spent my money on is very rude and disrespectful.and lastly your horrible spelling and illiterate sentence structure makes your points literally pointless, where all you are trying to do is make yourself sound high and mighty by saying you are able to speak 3 languages.
---
Actually BBQ and Chili is the easiest countered perk
---
I'll sum it up easily enough. Fuck em, play to win
---
They should be incentivised to not tunnel anyway
---
How did u make the mask
---
my post is about non-swf survivors that just load in together. I have bomb ass internet and play with an ethernet cord so i‚Äôd say 85% of the time the survivors load into my lobby at the same time. if I were to DC everytime that happened it would just be stupid.
---
Why would a swf group DC on the first hook ? wouldn‚Äôt screwing over your friends be the las thing you want to do ?
---
Also if killers aren‚Äôt obligated to play with survivors who they think are ‚Äútroublesome‚Äù than why should survivors? I‚Äôm sorry you have obviously had a bad time in your matches and got caught in a crossfire, but if killers aren‚Äôt obligated to play with survivors they don‚Äôt want to play with then why should survivors be obligated to play against killers they don‚Äôt want to play with? 
---
See what I did there? It‚Äôs a two way streak between survivors and killers so maybe we should just agree to stop DCing instead of acting like bitches in the comment section of a reddit rang 
---
They should, but they aren't. I'm just pointing out that if anything, this change has taken DS and made it more similar to whatever NOED is.
---
Press F for pur fallen comrade.
---
I would love her as a killerüòÇ
---
My boyfriend modeled them in Fusion 360 and I 3D printed them :)
---
Thank you!
---
Why make comments calling you privileged? You complain that the devs dont nerf killers, and based on the fact that the devs have stats, they balance accordingly. Then that makes you privileged in the sence that you have played so luch survivor that you think its fair as is, while the devs have stats telling us otherwise. Then when survivors are nerfed, you feel oppressed because you know cant have the same feeling as you had before. Also, this CHANGE to DS was in no way a proper nerf, it is a healthy change for both survivors and killers
---
We can both agree to do whatever but we know deep down nothing will ever change.
---
I understand. My conception of "stronger" was four optimal survivors vs one optimal killer, but SWF means a huge rift that I'm not accounting for.
---
Yeah that happens to me too i dont know what the fuck it is.
---
3D printing, filling and sanding and painting everything with acrylic paint
---
He didnt jump on the badwagon my dude :/
---
Or Lery‚Äôs. *shudders*
---
It's hip to fuck bees
---
&gt;It has glaring issues that need to be addressed.
---
Like what? Not trying to be rude but from what I can see the decisive rework looks really good. From a ridiculously overpowered perk with no downside to a strong perk that only activates in  certain situations.
---
Implying that I don't have to look for them and my team is also doing them.
---
not when you need just a little more IS and have been grinding the past few hours/days
---
T2 with insidious can be as fun as their one
---
Wait I thought t1 had no terror radius?
---
Wow aren‚Äôt you so damn smart, calling someone privileged and oppressed when you don‚Äôt have the STATS showing what side I play, and it‚Äôs not the DS Nerf people are mad about, it‚Äôs the fact that it‚Äôs a constant nerf to survivors and never stops and then we get assholes like you that automatically call someone else privileged for playing something they SPENT MONEY on and not being able to enjoy it when the developers go off the ‚Äústats‚Äù that they have that show the killers aren‚Äôt as good as some survivors. So instead of actually trying to BALANCE the game they keep taking from the poor and give to the rich. If you consider this a healthy change then you are part of the reason of why this game will be dead in a year 
---
Why are you so salty 
---
Hag is a goddess you take that back
---
Hell, if you get tunneled and face-camped then complain about it here, you'll get taunted and mocked. Killer want survivors to care about their fun and won't return the gesture. 
---
Damnn... that's hot as hell 
---
Wow you‚Äôre a toxic asshole. 
---
Well id be glad to be playing a "dead" game without you
---
considering how long DS got a rework... maybe in a few years we'll finally get one.
---
sprint burst, imo is still pretty broken. allowing you to escape 1 free hit and being able to manipulate the exhaustion condition is pretty powerful.
---
You have the need to point it out? Pathetic 
---
Thank you, I now feel dominated.
---
How to spot a killer main
---
Killer can never catch up? Really now? The speed difference must not exist on the version you play. 
---
Lol, i litterly dont play the game because i dont have a pc to play on atm, so while i can understand where you are coming from, i litterly cant be more privilaged than you, because you actualy have the privilage of playing the game
---
WGLF encourages altruism and if you play solo it's not a good thing (unless the hooked guy has kindred) because everyone will dive the hook to get their WGLF stacks which means no one is doing gens. Imo I think you should get 2 stacks for altruism and 2 stacks for completing gens. I think that'll balance out not being super altruistic and will also help with different playstyles because I'm not super altruistic( trust me,super altruism makes you lose the match, it's a killers dream) I think wglf should give you like 15% faster unhook time, and 2 stacks from gens and 2 stacks for altruism
---
Probably a console player, where Nurse is nonexistent and Billy is the META king. 
---
You can unlock tier 3 on all other survivors as well
---
They have a learning curve, Billy is one of the easiest killer and is one of the most effective. 
---
Or a black pip!
---
What if he did make a second account to give himself gold? What gives you the desire to be the 10th person to call him out for it? Do you get off by hoping on the band wagon?
---
Very nice but did you sandbag someone at the end?
---
They aren‚Äôt broken, you‚Äôre just a bad killer I have no issues when playing killer. And yes I have bad queue times on both sides survivor more then killer but still bad times on both.
---
I wish this was my infinite loading screen.
---
Once the gates are powered and you have someone on the hook, there isnt really any safe  reason to leave the hooked survivor unless you have Freddys perk Blood Warden. If you leave the hook, chances are theres a survivor hiding nearby ready to unhook their mate and follow them to out the gate to body block if possible. 
---
Wait what. On a side note I hate obsession perks in general. And I also hate Franklin's and Lightborn.
---
Then where do you have the ground to talk like you know how the game is being played at this moment? Sine you can‚Äôt play? And it‚Äôs not a privilege to play something I payed for with my own money 
---
I like the "Y" at the bottom
---
I don‚Äôt dc but playing against a trapper without coms is pretty ‚Äúannoying‚Äù since you don‚Äôt know what loops are trapped or not.
---
They expect someone downed to always die. But its not how it works, the game wants you to leave the survivors a second chance
---
Preach it brother, solo is a nightmare. You get teammates who leave you to die on the hook, super altruistic teammates, teammates who don't do gens, no one cleanses totems so it's a guaranteed noed and more. I'm far from a perfect survivor and I make a lot of stupid mistakes but being super altruistic and leaving someone to die on their first hook are things that should not happen 
---
Neither is a constant clicking noise in your ear 
---
Okay so you are still implying things. If it's a full solo queue, then everyone needs to find all five totems in order to make sure. How do I know? I cleansed 3-4 countless times and I still got one shot by it. Do you have any idea how much time it takes? Against a decent killer that's already throwing the game away.
---
Just ignore it /s
---
Guys i think thats hookable
---
A p3 good nurse. I dream of becoming one of you someday 
---
It all maked sense now
---
Its a band-aid fix for tunneling now. Not sure why but BHVR loves their band-aid fixes instead of actually addressing a problem
---
The killers who dodge for SWF usually play like complete dickweeds so you're honestly better off being dodged
---
Next level pathetic m8
---
What are you leaving too?
---
If there was a totem counter of some sorts on everyone's HUD then this excuse would make perfect sense.  The Survivors would have no reason to complain about NOED if they know there are totems left and don't cleanse them.
---
So what if im a bad killer, i still stomp bad survivors, and you having worse que times on survivor means more people play survivor as in over 75% of the playerbase playing survivor, and that isnt healthy
---
You're talking about BM as if it's a felony when most of the time it isn't even malicious
---
I don't understand why people hate it. For survivors, it has one of the most amounts of safe pallets(like 4?) and has plenty of loopable pallets and it's great for killers too because it's not super big and gens are not super far away from each other. The only time I hate the game is if I run up into an impossible skill checks doc or a God nurse (which are both super rare in my experience) 
---
I am so angry that as a doc main i have never thought of this
---
I relate to this 
---
Thanks for the comments guys! I think I'm beginning to understand the different sides of the community here!
---
People unironically complain about sprint burst and flashlights and think they are top tier. Sprint Burst was only good when Exhaustion recovered while sprinting. Sprint Burst+Vigil was so stupid. Flashlights were insane when they made your screen bright white, the killer pickup animation was longer, insta blind was a thing. All of that has changed and yet you still have people whining about flashlights. I do not understand the victim mentality killers have. Like everyone is out to get them and ‚Äúbully‚Äù them. I‚Äôve never seen such a mentality so widespread before.
---
Im basing it on the fact that the devs decided to change a survivor perk, but didnt change the killer "equvivalent"
---
These type of killers are the best.  
---
One time I was up against a no check out nurse. All game no killer, as soon as I opened the gate I got noed to the face.  
---
All she said was "no check out at this time, thank you."  
---
I know it's not unique and we've since heard of this before but my first time I almost had a heart attack when I opened the gate and saw her just standing there waiting. Unforgettable
---
**Granma's Cooking**
---
Using her knowledge of amazing recipes that she has created and learned over the years, The Gram-Gram is able to create amazing dishes that Survivors have trouble resisting!
---
* When at a Generator, Locker, Chest, or Unthrown Pallet The Gram-Gram may interact with the object by pressing and holding the Power button, placing some freshly baked cookies or a delicious meal near the object.
---
* Survivors who attempt to repair Generators warded by The Gram-Gram's food will do so at a considerably reduced rate (-50% repair speed) and gain no bonus progression from good or great skillchecks, as they are distracted by the delicious food close by. Survivors can end this affliction by consuming the food at the Generator, however this will notify the Gram-Gram and reduce their movement speed by -5% (due to being stuffed). Only one Generator may be warded by delicious food at a time.
---
* Survivors who hide in lockers warded by The Gram-Gram's food will immediately begin loudly consuming the food they find inside, unable to resist it's deliciousness. While consuming the food the Survivor will be unable to exit until they finish eating, trapping them in a locker for 10 seconds. During this time The Gram-Gram can hear their loud munching if she gets near the locker. 10 Lockers may be warded by delicious food at a time. Warded locker's auras are revealed to The Gram-Gram.
---
* Survivors who search Chests warded by delicious food will notify The Gram-Gram when they begin searching the chest. Upon opening the Chest the Survivor will notice the delicious food within and begin consuming it instead of searching the chest, during the 10 seconds that follow the only thing that can stop the Survivor from eating the food is The Gram-Gram's iron grasp. Once the food is consumed the Survivor may cancel searching the chest or continue searching. There is no limit to the amount of chests The Gram-Gram may ward. The auras of all Chests are revealed to The Gram-Gram, with non-warded chests being visible in red and warded chests being visible in white.
---
* Survivors who attempt to throw pallets warded by The Gram-Gram's freshly baked cookies will instead eat the cookie for 5 seconds, slowing their movement speed by 20% and preventing them from throwing the pallet until they finish eating. Being hit by The Gram-Gram will cause the Survivor to drop their cookie, moving at normal speed and begin crying because it has been totally ruined. Gram-Gram you monster &gt;:\[ Only 4 Pallets may be so warded at a time.
---
Can someone else do her perks? I'm way too tired and my head hurts.
---
Yes it is healthy in a way, it means that people want to play with friends. How is that not healthy? Not many people play MULTIPLAYER GAMES solo. If they do it‚Äôs either because they have no friends to play with or are in the process of waiting for people to get online. So nobody is gonna be playing killer when they have 3 other friends they can play SWF with. Nice try
---
Okay so don't mix up people who derank to stay in green/purple ranks to avoid sweaty games (because that's what you get in red ranks, not skill) and people who derank as much as possible to bully new players. Most derankers are group one. And if you think that people in green ranks are noobies then you just proved us that bad players can keep ranking up meaning devs should fix the ranking system and how red ranks play.
---
Idk why but I really like seeing garbage can lid shields used in things!
---
That's the thing with tattoos you don't have to explain them to anyone and they don't have to have a meaning. It's just art some may like it others may disagree. I'm saving money to get a badass Alice madness returns tattoo because of it's aesthetics and my love for the game.
---
Then if that is thw most healthy way to play why dont they just implement vooce chat and balance around swf?
---
This isn't even possible anymore after the Legion patch. 
---
They didn‚Äôt change the ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù because killer mains would have gotten angry and bitched even more then they already do.
---
As someone who only started playing DBD a week before clown came out, bringing BBQ/WGLF is a great way for me to catch up with my friends who have almost all P3 characters
---
Surprised you even were allowed to grab that toolbox with that amount of lag! Damn brotha, Hope you never have to experience that again
---
Gonna sound toxic but this game has loooots of kids in it. The facebook group from my country has like 70% kids in it who are playing the game(that's why I left thr group)
---
A kid, most of the times, wants to be *THE BEST* and does stupid and irritating stuff for attention(including teabagging because most of them are Ochido fanboys who think that is what a pro player does)
---
Anyway, if I play survivor and I see a bad killer I just type in chat what he has to train more and what perks to use(I've seen sooo many Myers with NOED). The game is infested with toxicity because it's very much a competitive game and it gives you an adrenaline boost sometimes.
---
Disconnect by daylight!!! It has literally been an hour now and still no game! And if I did find one I get disconnected üò≠üò≠üò≠ it sucks 
---
Frederick 'Stretch Armstrong' Krueger
---
I think I'm gonna start doing that too.
---
The smile on Hag's face makes me thing that she is literally cackling everywhere she goes.
---
How does that make any sense? So the more people that call you out for being a shitty person for calling out another shitty person is better? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
---
Yes he does? Are you fucking stupid?
---
It was never busted hitboxes, it was always just Frederick 'Stretch Armstrong' Krueger's elastic arms!
---
Thank you, I will probably upload another one today. 
---
So you want them to make him unplayable?
---
I am already at it, EW is charging while I am writing you. 
---
Thank you. 
---
[removed]
---
Holy shit. Actually accurate
---
Cool weapon skin, but it takes up the entire screen lol
---
I doubt it, since they havent implemented voice chat
---
You literally don‚Äôt understand anything do you? Why would they take the time to implement a voice chat when anyone that plays SWF would use PARTY CHAT like they have on PS4 and Xbox one? Or even discord chat for that matter. They have more pressing issues to worry about in this game other then implementing a voice chat. The connection issues for starters, it‚Äôs so bad a voice chat would be utterly useless 
---
Then why should they balance for it, unless they have statistics that say 90% of survivors are playing swf with voice chat then i can understand that, but i doubt thats the case
---
That's some pretty good stuff. Adrenaline III, Odd Bulb, BPS, and a Syringe.
---
Nobody has answered me. Who the hell is "The Bee"?
---
Thats not true. Survivors with high visibility cosmetics are usually just behave really arrogantly.
---
I hope that was the case
---
You might regret this in 10-20 years 
---
T H I C C 
---
My friend has a Xbox and I have a Ps4. I'm not buying a new system just so I can get the same experience just so I can wait for long queue times and all the infamous shit of DBD , not to mention how little I'll use it. Love the game but would love it even more if there were cross play with xbox and later switch.
---
If it‚Äôs got a charge stop using it at 99.9%!
---
And then die anyways.
---
Wait, wasn‚Äôt loading all the survivors at the same time part of an update? Did I imagine this or did everyone forget?
---
Aye big smoke it‚Äôs me, chill baby cheell!
---
Amanda? OOHHH MY PIG
---
Maybe if you were good they wouldnt get a chance to teabag you? And you know how you get good? By practicing against good people, like the SWFs you now dodge because one time they hurt your feelings by crouching up and down.
---
Dont forget the victim mentality
---
It goes from dead game to bursting alive its weird
---
You called him out by posting on his post? 
---
Killers will just complain about not having the innate connection advantage and unironically ask for some sort of buff to compensate for it. Imagine if a survivor asked for that.
---
I honestly think killers should be able too, but they have to have a progression bar just like a door or maybe even half of a generator timer with skill checks
---
No I want him to work for instadowns like every other killer
---
How so? Let's day you dc 20 times... There's no punishment if you can just leave your game on while sleeping or something to avoid the timeout.
---
I play both surv and killer and I think it's fine how it is because it gives the first who finds it the win but if a surv camps hatch letting others die while doing nothing I can see why you say that 
---
-rep legion 
---
Regardless pretty cool idea!
---
Let's not forget Wraith shall we.
---
Yeah that's what I do against NOED as a survivor, and leave dull totems next to gens and save those gens for last
---
I kinda don't care DS is being nerfed but the fact that it's being nerfed implies it was like a huge problem, outside of non-obsession DS
---
Like it was only really a "I like chases/ pub stomping really bad killers" perk. Started running it every rank reset cause I didn't enjoy dying on first hook and depipping, or M1'ing all game and then getting insta-downed/ facecamped and black pipping cause the killer applied zero pressure all game for you to earn altruism or boldness points off from.
---
At least i dont make up "facts"
---
Erm, that melee weapon for Trapper does have a wiggly bit with a chain attached to it. And like two wheels on it?
---
Hell yea I mean it's peak gaming hours right now. Weird.
---
Just had this for the first time ever .. 2 days ago. I had a key and killer was near. Luckily I survived
---
DS is meta too
---
Unless you literally carry the survivor to the exit they dont get you are being nice. The odd veteran player might get it but the average idiot survivor wont
---
Exactly. Survivor don‚Äôt got much to communicate with lol it‚Äôs pretty often you‚Äôll see survivor tea bagging after you heal them or unhooking them.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy to tell if it‚Äôs an insult or a thank you. Pallet stunned tea bagging is a royal fuck you and any gesture in there favor is generally a thank you. 
---
As a tattooed person, the amount of times we hear this is ridiculous. I might be dead in 10-20 years, if not I'm sure I'll have other things to worry about than a cool image on my body.
---
It could have looked nice if the style wasn't cartoony. The original spirit art fits better for a tattoo I think. 
---
Eh, I can see both honestly
---
Because timers are terrible, especially 20 minutes. 
---
Removed - Shaming other players
---
Why? It's getting a nerf next week member?
---
Yep. If I load up into a lobby in red ranks as survivor and theres more than one survivor with one piece of bloody clothing or a DLC cosmetic, its almost like a guarenteed ebony mori. It was so bad during the event I had to switch to classic meghead to actually find a lobby that wasnt an ebony mori or a lobby dodger. 
---
This game would be a lot better if the ranking system wasnt half assed. A good place to start out - an actual incentive to hit rank 1. Either a unique cosmetic or bloodpoints - literally anything. 
---
Also the fact that anyone can play Legion and kill nobody yet still pip is actually crazy. I wonder what it would take, maybe a streamer like Zubat could play No kill legion to rank 1 just to expose how god awful the rank system is in this game
---
That scene was beautiful, I'm glad the devs added at least *something*  from the original! 
---
You can make people DS into bad spots; corners of maps = far from pallets. You can also make sure they drop whatever pallet they're going to before smacking/ picking them up.
---
You can make them DS off an edge that stuns them with the landing animation. Like the basement stairs- if they DS off of it, even with Balanced Landing proc'd they will get hit.
---
Slugging your first hit is not a bad call even if they don't have DS if you see someone else. Especially before when pickup/ hook animations took way longer, it was often better to just leave first dude on the ground and get pressure rolling faster.
---
YEAH, people can pick the dude up- but they run from whatever gen they were doing to get to them. It's why hooking or slugging someone counts as "at least" 2 people off gens; someone else is going for the save. If you start chasing someone right after, that's *3* survivors off of gens.
---
Not only that, but you guarantee bringing them to a particular side of the map. You can even plan stuff out so survivors get "bad gens" off the side of the map, then apply your pressure and bring them to 3 gens next to a very limited amount of pallets.
---
But if you pick them up, eat the DS, and can't catch them in 7 seconds- you just got rid of all that pressure to work with.
---
And then killers who don't know how to deal with any of this facecamp/ run noed cause they play for kills and not points or interesting gameplay.
---
It would likely never happen.  PC players have an unfair advantage over console players.  Keyboard and mouse beat console controllers. You can tweak settings on PC, but not console. 
---
Cross platform on Xbox vs Ps4 would be more fair,  but that is unlikely to happen as well, as that brings in Sony and Microsoft allowing it to happen. 
---
Simply put, it will never happen for DbD, nor would I ever want it to considering the amount of bugs and network issues the game has.  Now imagine double or triple that if you include cross platform.  No thank you.
---
Just buy the game on whichever console your friends primarily use. 
---
Removed - Uncivil
---
&gt;but even at rank 1 everybody dies 90% of games anyways
---
.........
---
m8 you know the game is heavily survivor sided right? a 4k is pretty uncommon in rank 1
---
Every killer would get buffed if they fixed some of the broken maps. Haddonfield window infinites and the coldwin see through tiles are a great start
---
Right? The game used to be heavily survivor favored, but now the game is headed in the direction of being catered to killers.
---
Look at all the survivor bugs there are at the moment.  Also, the weeks that it took to fix the tinkerer bug causing billies with no heartbeat and the week of having no chase music in a game, so you didn't even have the ability for audio cues. Yup....
---
Jump scares are pretty much the main reason I play this game now. T1 Myers is my specialty, I love playing against Twitch survivors and going to their stream after to see their reactions. I respect you for this, well done. 
---
Finally a new Myers skin. I thought it would never happen 
---
SPOILER ALERT
---
Ohhhhh ffffuuuuuddddgggeeeee
---
Killer is in a very nice spot right now. I think the developers said themselves killers are getting way higher average kills than ever.
---
I stopped playing killer since the queues got tons longer and it became way too easy to play. Only had like 1 or 2 interesting games in the last 3 sessions I've played. Good survivors just seem to have a lot less to work with.
---
Just because you don't o something means no one does?
---
See sometime I will camp by hatch if I know when a hook save is a bad idea like when 2 people left me and the guy hooked there is a chance where surv will be camped unless I see killer away from hook I wont save dont want to farm
---
If you want tattoos make sure you get whatever you want and whatever means something to you, whether that be an irrelevant meme or an obscure cartoon character! 
---
Seriously, tattoos should be for you and you alone, if other people like them it's a nice bonus but if they don't then that's fine because it's not their body so they don't need to worry about it.

I just use perks that synergize with being injured. Iron Will/Dead Hard. Cant carry the team if you‚Äôre wasting 32 seconds healing instead of working on a gen.
---
Id tink personally that invisible gens sounds stupid however there certainly needs to be more incentive to do totems. NOED is supposed to be a punishment for not cleansing the totems, but currently totems are a timesink for survivors that grant them nothing but avoiding NOED. 
---
Id like to see totems as a whole provide passive buff/nerfs every match which would promote survivors cleansing them
---
5 totems remain : Survivors suffer a 15% penalty to all action speeds
---
4 totems remain: Survivors suffer a 10% penalty to all action speeds
---
3 totems remain: Survivor suffer 5% penalty to all action speeds
---
2 totems remain: No buff/debuff
---
1 totem remains: Survivors gain 5% buff to all action speeds
---
0 totems remaining: Survivors gain 10% to all action speeds
---
The numbers could be adjusted but this gives killers more edge at early game and survivors more late game, it also promotes survivors cleansing totems
---
2 totems remain: Survvi
---
Read what I said. You cannot completely block people out of the game for any period (aside from a ban) for DCing when there isnt stable servers. You cannot lock your game out of players when the player base is so small anyways. People complain about lobby times now how about when there are 10 killers trying to cycle through 200 survivors 
---
I‚Äôve lost kills and momentum to it so many times, and when I first unlocked it, I was downed at the gates by a nurse, but got away because of this perk, haven‚Äôt used it personally since it just feels so dirty, it‚Äôs like using silent spirit or mix tape, feels like cheating
---
I'm glad it finally got hit, it's been a problem for far too long.
---
It's ruined the game for every survivor, not just the toxic ones.
---
I didn't care about none of that toxic crap, I just wanted to mess about and have fun but almost every game seems to be not, so I just don't play anymore. 
---
Hopefully they balance it out to get rid of the toxic but still make it fun to play survivor. When dedicated servers come I hope they fix the hitboxes too.
---
I feel like Seal Team 6 survivors still have a tossup depending on map. Balanced landing + haddonfield offering vs a huntress, yeeeaaah the killer will be roflstomped.
---
But nowadays people give SWF way more credit than they deserve.
---
Purple flashlight too
---
If you were able to move your camera during pick up then flashlight saves would be literally impossible. Your entire point is stupid.
---
It's as simple as making the timeout apply to people who manually click Leave Game. It doesn't have to apply to lost connections, bugged loading, whatever.
---
As for the reasons you stated, if you don't want to play bad connections check ping in the lobby. Timeout.
---
If you're getting farmed, die and play another game... You lose less pips for dying than leaving. Timeout.
---
I think it's unsafe pallet, so as a killer u should be pleased :D
---
Decisive got nerfed ? Can you tell me more about it ?
---
Cant be decisively struck if it never activates XD
---
Don't worry about what he said. Just go ahead and equip Unbreakable, cause killers are gonna be slugging your ass for those 60 seconds after unhook
---
I dont get these for this sub what
---
Obviously I read what you said. Down to every punctuation and spelling error.
---
 Dedicated servers are on the way in case you didn't know. 
---
That little boob crack, I‚Äôm in love.
---
How do you spread your arms like that?
---
But it's an instadown.
---
If LF gets them in an open area he can end the chase right there. However the downside is he needs that time to use it, time to get real close and charge it. That's balance, he has the ability to take a survivor down in 1 hit but that survivor has to be far enough from any forms of protection. So it's unlikely to happen early game but comes in handy later when pallets are disappearing.
---
Myers can also take a survivor down in 1 hit but he needs to delay the chase to stalk them to do that so it balances out.
---
Hillbilly sprints at 230% speed catching the survivor off guard, charges his chainsaw in a second or two, while walking behind them and not being slowed down like LF, then takes a swing. Most survivors can not avoid it. Hell hillbilly can hold it charged and walk around circular objects to get the survivors too unlike LF. Not only this but if he misses he can just swing again and again and again. He has no timer like Myers, and if he misses or hits an object the punishment isn't anywhere near as time-consuming as it is for LF.
---
Hillbilly's chainsaw simply isn't well balanced.
---
This reminds me i have to farm Bubba for Chili and Barbecue
---
*Chili in the Shrine*
---
**What the fuck**
---
Hence why players usually equate both perks of being OP as well as a crutch.. but since people kept on saying that NOED isnt comparable to DS is just ludicrous.. both rewards bad plays, both takes no skill to run, and both rewards toxic behaviours.. But seeing that the devs isnt on board on tweaking NOED just as they did to DS is nothing short of damage control..  they cant please both sides but since Survivors are deemed the toxic one here, they went with just doing away with DS instead of both... they knew that if they were to gut noed as well as ds, they'd have a riot on their hands... 
---
I don‚Äôt even know what I just witnessed.
---
Me either, and I was the one playing!
---
Yeah. I am getting the facecampers and tunnellers all the time. It really just makes me pissed off at the game and not wanna play.
---
If I do all the gens by myself I wont pip up and that's just annoying.
---
I play PS4 and I need both hands free to work the controller.
---
I don't know the details but I think every sub you're in sends them from time to time if you have it enabled. 
---
The fact that all you see is that both or OP says a lot, you are clearly not a killer or an experienced killer and you only see the text of the perk not the big picture. DS had no 100% counter, only small once, and it's down side is you run 3 perks for the entire game IF you miss it. With NOED it offers a good effect at the price of using only 3 perks the entire game and also having the chance that it doesn't even active. DS is a safe card while NOED is most of the time RNG based.
---
Lol HEX has no downside either. I disagree that the rework looks good for anyone but a bad killer. The good killers could keep up with the decisive because they‚Äôre good at chases, the crappy killers would actually lose survivors or get their time wasted because they couldn‚Äôt finish off a survivor. That being said, the nerf looks so bad for a survivor. The perk becomes very situational, and the stun time is now decreased as well.
---
The only people that will find the totems are those who have played the game long enough. As it stands the game is not friendly to new players who try out survivor. They are constantly making totem spawns harder to find (which I agree with) but unless you are in a 3/4 man SWF you cannot efficiently destroy every totem without wasting a massive amount of time. That time could be the difference between escaping and dying for a perk that may or may not be used. It is *not*  balanced and the devs *don't*  know what they're doing because this game is simply killer sided. I'm not rewriting half of my points so just reread my post. 
---
&gt; guaranteed advantage
---
Please watch streamers play this game. 3k+ hour killer mains, survivor mains; they will all have virtually the same opinion.
---
With the amount of ways to screw over DS, and granting the survivor can even *hit* DS, it's a huge gamble to run.
---
That's not even addressing how you don't seem to see slugging as a viable thing.
---
With the way your joints work I don't think there's gonna be much momentum when jumping from 10+ feet so I don't think there would be much realism to that portion. Exhaustion makes sense bc of impact on landing, but it should be much less time
---
‚Ä¢ Hillbilly wasn‚Äôt beaten by thugs. 
---
‚Ä¢ Well Huntress.. yeah she did. 
---
&gt; because this game is simply killer sided. 
---
I take my leave from this thread now. 
---
I was mostly just implying that this DS "nerf" is just gonna make good killers slug people who just got off hook.
---
And we all know how fun slug metas are.
---
When you start the game, the obsession is hidden and Decisive is disabled, When the person with Decisive is hooked and rescued for the next 60 seconds they can use it.
---
It's changed from being a free escape perk to an anti tunneling perk. 
---
the game sucks ass and 25% of the time you get an infinite load screen when the game starts, that btw counts as a disconnect. so devs need the fix that first.
---
If they made killer tons harder to rank up (more dependent on # of hooks/ # of hits on survivors, your amount of kills being near negligable to pips)  you wouldn't get as many boosted killers who inist on camping/ tunnelling.
---
because haddonfield needs more :D
---
&gt; Killers are incentivized to avoid tunneling just in case
---
Killers are incentivized to slug survivors *just in case*.
---
So you are basically giving survivors 2 exhaustion perks? This is too good TBH. The perk as it is now is to good on certain maps, this would make it godlike.
---
Because the entity is a small fairy following them around filling up their gas for them.
---
It would be even better if fixing gens was like fixing a real generator; they could also have multiple different issues.
---
those "sneaky" plays are like the best thing ever - i wish we had an unsuspicious whistling for the killer - just like "don't mind me nea, nono don't get up i absolutely didn't see you behind that tree, just walking by here doing my best to not look in your direction at all!"

Bruder du musst los
---
I just don't like Rancor.
---
The past 3 days I keep seeing more and more of them(on PC), especially today with 3 different guys on my last 5 games. Only found this post cause I was looking up if anyone else gets them more lately.
---
Gg, you took the bait. 
---
I hear that but still parkour, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm basing it on. 
---
Oh ok, thanks :*
---
I quit a match the other day because a survivor instantly killed them self on first hook. Like 2 min into the game. They sent me a message after saying ‚Äúnice tunnel camp‚Äù. 
---
I pretty tired of the toxic community on psn. Every game someone has to cry. 
---
YOO what if the survivor did a forward roll when landing and gaining lots of momentum.
---
woooosh? 
---
nothing official has been said about anything yet. so no conformation for anything
---
&gt; -upon landing uses momentum to sprint at 110/120/130% for 3 seconds either one up for debate
---
That's a speed boost idiot, survivors run at base 100%, so it would be a speed boost by 10/20/30% that is not affected by exhaustion.
---
Ok so the perk is countered by 2 killers, looks like we need to buff it so it becomes completely OP. Here is the deal, this is a terrible change you are proposing, you want to change a perk that is already good against most killer to just completely OP.
---
Good luck trying to loop the killer in first-person
---
What?
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being salty or not 
---
No like legit that‚Äôd be really fun
---
you seem chill, wanna add me? xoxoxo
---
This is true
---
I feel you dude it's pretty ridiculous. 
---
Its not about nerfing good killer but making bad killers good lel
---
Wow shooting the insults already, I‚Äôm glad you can do basic math and know the basics of the game good job. Thanks for pointing out clearly what I stated. Momentum=speed boost not effected by exhaustion good job
---
Is this supposed to be a joke 
---
1. Clown has no mobility apart from being a 115% killer, which means he has no map pressure.
---
2. Clown has no stall.
---
3. Clown's looping power is barely existent. At first glance his power seems fine. Except when he winds back his arm to throw the bottle, he slows himself down to the point where a survivor could outwalk him. This means that without Flask of Bleach, the slow he gets from gassing a surv nets him nothing. Even with Flask of Bleach, it's iffy.
---
4. The medium vault changes killed him. His gas is supposed to force you to medium vault no matter which angle you come at the window from, but with the new i-frames it nets him no advantage. (That's assuming it even forces the slow vault to begin with.)
---
5. He has I think upward of 20 bugs attached to him.
---
5.1. Clown has collision with his own bottles, but when thrown from certain angles, the hitboxes overlap. This causes the bottle to explode literally as soon as you throw it.
---
5.2. Sometimes, for no reason, the gas just doesn't slow the survivor.
---
5.3. The gas doesn't force a medium vault sometimes like it should.
---
5.4. Sometimes, the gas doesn't cause a survivor to scream. (This is not because of Calm Spirit; the survivor wasn't running it.)
---
This ^ is all from the perspective of someone with 800(?) hours in Clown. He's perhaps the only Clown main in existence. 
---
Thank you for not immediately downvoting and calling me an idiot, unlike some people.
---
Yikes
---
It‚Äôs not a terrible change, you are just mad for no fucking reason and already threw insults at me. This rework benefits both sides. You‚Äôre just mad someone else has an idea you don‚Äôt agree with
---
Fun is subjective, so that wouldn't really work.
---
So what you want is a perk that completely stops you from staggering, gives you a speed boost when landing, that isn't affected by exhaustion and is instead based on a cooldown so you an use it with another exhaustion perk, and it also makes the killer stagger more? 
---
I can tell your sarcastic ass thinks it is, so tell me oh wise one is this overpowered already?
---
Yeah, but you can't get the extra bloodpoints without playing a character that has the perk
---
The killers don‚Äôt stagger at all upon falling, so the killer will 9/10 get a free hit on you as you are falling any way, this change would nullify that allowing the survivors a slight window to escape. 
---
Hahaha, ofc I don't agree with it it is the dumbest idea I have ever seen, it doesn't benefit both sides. 
---
I thought it was a joke cause it sounds like a stupid idea. Of course this would be op 
---
You must not remember the days of machine-gun sprint. Being able to use two exhaustion perks on separate cooldowns was broken as fuck and should never return.
---
Clearly you are to arrogant to hear anyone else out
---
I am hearing you out and I'm telling you what you are saying is dumb.
---
They should leave the perk alone it is fine. No reason he change it.
---
Set it in AVP - different time line? 
---
Lol then you could argue that DS has the downside of, if you miss it, it‚Äôs useless. I‚Äôm not gonna argue on how the devs treat the survivors unfairly because I already have voiced my opinion over and over but I strongly disagree with you.  
---
Spirit can be really good, but that is dependent on the survivor's ability to make reads, which honestly not many have that. 
---
Why thou? It‚Äôs not like they need anymore of a buff they always bitch games are to quick this will make it take longer to play. It‚Äôs literally feeding to what killers want, and I don‚Äôt agree with using balanced landing plus sprint burst. My point is on the fact that I should be able to use balanced landing and if the killer did get a hit on me I should be able to dead hard through the killer giving me another chance to escape as soon as needed
---
Bigot
---
It‚Äôs not fine, if I‚Äôm injured and I jump off a ledge the killer can do the same thing and still lunge and hit me even if I had a 4m gap between us due to the lack of stagger.
---
Ya works great for solo queues
---
Typical killer main
---
Again, realism is not going to help you here. You think a fuckin' atrophied pile of bones like the Hag, or a fat fuck like Leatherface or the Clown could keep pace with a fit, athletic, normal human being, much less somehow catch up to them? Not to mention most of the killers carry around heavy-ass equipment and weapons. Realism has zero bearing on game balance.
---
Trap god windows.
---
Dont trap the pallet, trap around the loop so when the survivor starts running around it, they run into it.
---
This guy gets it!
---
So you admit this game is broken in the killers favor. And this rework would give survivors a slight advantage and that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt like it.
---
Ok so you got unlucky. If the killer is close enough he should get the hit. The timing is obviously bad, which in most cases is just bad luck.
---
You sound jaded. You know, I could absolutely say the same thing about survivors who complain about every well deserved nerf. But I don't, because I understand that people aren't like that all the time. I suggest you try playing some high rank killer and get back to me. Or take a break from the game. It's making you into an asshole.
---
Are you talking about fast vaults though? Newer players often mistake slow vault speed for broken hitboxes
---
Or bad connection, which again is why something needs to be done to as you called it ‚Äúbuff‚Äù the survivors instead of hindering them constantly

Save and take the hit? Camping hatch should be bannable
---
You're right, thank you!
---
No, not at all, I was here when double sprint was around, this has literally already been in the game, and it was absurdly broken. I think the game may slightly favor killer now, but bringing back double sprint is a bad idea, it was removed for a good reason.
---
Is sitting there hitting the dude and throwing bottles at him also acceptable to you?
---
I play high rank killers they aren‚Äôt always great Rank doesn‚Äôt mean anything salty. It‚Äôs not hard to face camp 2-3 kills a match and pip. You killers that act high and mighty when survivors get nerfed it was makes this community toxic. You keep getting buffs and nerfs to go in your favor and all you guys do is still keep bitching. It‚Äôs pretty sad when they keep taking from survivors and you still keep getting your ass beaten, and still try to find more reasons to nerf survivors.
---
Your point?
---
I mean, I feel that, but there are just a lot of broken as fuck perk build + add ins. As entertaining as a tombstone Myers build is to watch, that shit is annoying as fuck to attempt to play against. 
---
That‚Äôs just an example off the top of my head though. 
---
Yeah probably because DS is literally a fucking wasted perk slot with the new change. 
---
Watching how jumpscare Myers can wreck survivors in Lerys or The Game, I can't begin to imagine how that would play out lol 
---
Never said bring back double sprint, I said BL shouldn‚Äôt be an exhaustion perk and I already stated I don‚Äôt agree with BL plus sprint burst. It was removed because killers got tired of losing chases the same reason why pallets numbers have gone down and windows
---
Well hopefully dedicated server might fix that.
---
White and black skulls are vastly different. Idk why anti science shills use this picture
---
This should be pinned to the sidebar
---
What is this? I think the game is actually pretty balanced already. (im lvl 5 btw) 
---
Aaaaaand it's not haunted ground
---
I think that this needs to be implemented. Survivors aren't already better than killers 
---
Can't you use a keyboard and mouse on console? If not, why buy it on console and complain lol
---
See how hard was that? You finally gave some positive input instead of hurling insults. Good job. But I doubt it something will happen where since killers aren‚Äôt getting this laggy hits they will want an extended lunge or hit range or a speed boost to 120% instead of 115%
---
Sarcasm?
---
I‚Äôm 99.9% sure you‚Äôre a Rank 20 survivor main 
---
I need to remember that
---

It would seem a bit farfetched but what if her ability was to temporarily age a survivor to the point of Gram Gram? They would be slower in everything they do but the more work(out) they do, the faster they regain their youth? 
---
I know with survivor like Bill would be weird (since's he's already old xD) but it would be a cool power. Idk how it would work but oh well :3

oh yes a whole 4% of pc users have it.
---
It‚Äòs ok it‚Äòs just one of my tiny hands but great u noticed it!
---
Removed - No salty messages
---
Grandma, I don't feel like eating cookies
---
This would make it completely broken. 
---
As it is, some areas are already near infinites with balanced landing, having 0 stagger, with a speed boost,  + giving the killer stagger would almost guarantee infinites on some maps like Haddonfield or The Game.
---
Nothing blows my mind more than when they initiate the tbagging, pointing, etc; then immediately start shit talking in lobby and follow all of this up with calling you toxic

Without bragging or anything but you can fake doing them aswell and this works SO well even on legacy killers c:

You need an adapter to use keyboard and mouse on this game. Console has native support for keyboard and mouse but it's at the developers discretion to enable it lock it from their game. They've chosen to lock it so unless you have an adapter you're shit out of luck.

The game suffers from terrible performance on pc too. No way i'm buying such a broken game on any platform. I just moved on. As you said they will never fix it.
---
I feel this happens with literally any argument about this game no matter what side you are on
---
Wow, great meme 10/10
---
Yea a first person survivor mode that also put some sort of limits on killer and has its own separate rank would be really cool. 
---
Not with how heavily it is at the moment. 
---
Lmao it literally isn't but okay. 
---
I‚Äôm a little bit newer to the game, do you mind clarifying this?
---
Is that map really that laggy on console or was that last switching? 
---
Yeah because they don't know how to fix their game lmfao
---
How is it heavily killer sided when 4 out of 14 killers stand a chance against survivors with half a brain. The game is going good now balance wise. I dont agree with killers 4king every match but the devs are achieving what they wanted
---
Damn this comment chain is edgy

That tells us that u dont really nees it to succeed 
---

"YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG. Honestly, i don't even know why i called you."

We have an announcement to make
---
#STOP BULLYING
---
Both are obsession perks that grant 1 free escape/kill that feels like bullshit. Noed can be prevented 5 gens before it happens
---
&gt;But longer gens goes against what you said survivor mains like: the chase.
---
No, it doesn't. The Killer can only chase one player at a time. Nothing changes to the amount of chases you get into. The game will just last longer so it's ok if chases take a longer amount of time. (So they can potentially add more pallets, buff vaults, fix hitboxes and getting hit through pallets. Or, just stop nerfing the chase in general)
---
I promise you, they will continue to nerf tools Survivors have in chases because, for whatever reason, the devs are blind to the fact that that's the only fun part in the game. If you ruin chases and make them end faster then you ruin the fun. Why not choose to make gens longer (or mandatory side-objectives to prevent a m1 simulator bore-fest) isntead of making chases shorter?
---
DS is practically useless now whereas NOED is still stronger than ever. As for the solo to SWF strength I agree but it doesn't look like the devs are doing that. We were promised a lot of things that never even got done so I don't hold out much hope for them. 
---
He just means that he doesn‚Äôt have bbq and chilli on any other character, since he wants the extra bloodpoints from the bbq and chilli perk he has to play leatherface
---
You just seem to want to complain about the game instead of working on new strategies
---
Generally, Irridescent add-ons provide effects that none of the other add-ons provide, or provides new ways of applying those effects, such as the Irridescent King. This just feels like a really overpowered purple item. It doesn't change how you play, it just makes you better at doing the things you already do. It's not fun for the killer, and that's the main reason why Irridescent add-ons exist.
---
&gt;If we are designing balance based on player's mistake
---
That's how the game has been balanced for years, though. Nurse, and to an extent Legion, are the only killers with which you can say "I will down this survivor in a timely manner no matter what they do".
---
Every other killer has to abandon chases, or lose multiple generators if the survivor they're chasing knows how to loop.
---
Not really
---
Did you even read what I wrote?
---
They're doing so poorly that statistically they only get 2-3 kills a game. Its rough to be killer.
---
Rancour only affects one player that might be dead before then anyway. NOED puts the effect on everyone regardless of anything else. Cleansing all the totems when not playing in a SWF can greatly hinder the game and cause you or your teammates to die. 
---
Rip ds, It helped me get better at chases and skill checks
---
*sniif* it is beautiful 
---
I feel like it might have been a switch.... everyone was running her around for a good bit so she might have been frustrated or something idk.
---
I totally agree with you bud.
---
The -1 karma was probably because it's literally pinned on the front page for almost 3 days now lol.
---
But if you want some more details check [this out](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/48381/decisive-strike-upcoming-changes)
---
That is indeed what I meant
---
Watch the shrine videos of HybridPanda on YouTube. He is fun and explains what every perk does and which one to get!
---
Me and my friend found this swf lobby glitch that allows me to show up in his lobby T Posing 100% of the time.
---
The T Pose only shows up on his screen, but it still is truly a sight to behold
---
All I have to do is have the survivor in their full base set of cosmetics (aside from Meg and Jesus or some reason) and be in the killer menu displaying Legion when I accept his invite.
---
I'm not sure what else is at play here. Considering how common it is to have those set of parameters, you would think that it would have been discovered by now. We have not modified the game or messed with the files in any way.
---
Me and my friend will continue to investigate how the survivors have managed to ascend beyond us mere mortals.
---
Fang is definitely better smh
---
The thing about DS is that it received too many low-key nerfs to actually earn to the title of "busted". The heal nerfs (which'll cause a higher down time IF the Survivor manages to escape), the exhaust changes (which was a huuuge cut to chase-extending Survivors), the hook-density changes (which made dribbling even worse and non-obsession DS useless) plus the fact that the exploit called "dribbling" has also been a thing for so long now...DS got absurdely worse in comparasion to it's release-version.
---
Regardless, I obviously admit that DS USED to be busted as hell. Almost as dominant as pre-killed sabo back in the day.
---
&gt;Meanwhile, all survivors have to do is complete gens, open gates, and escape. NOED does not interfere with that
---
Come on man. You can't be serious...
---
If I get instant down the moment the last gen gets done and camped (which Killers *should* do once the gates are powered to secure a Kill) then it *does* interfere with me escaping.
---
I've never seen a Killer at red ranks not camp once the exit gates are powered unless they're using an ultra-late game build. I see noed so damn often. It's come to a point where if I see a Killer play like shit I **know** they have noed 100%. It's a literal crutch perk that's garbage to play against and doesn't reward or encourage good play.
---
DS is the same shit. They both need reworks or nerfs.
---
The problem with totems is that it doesn't tell you how many are left. If I'm playing solo I *have* to find all 5 totems to assure the Killer won't get noed. And, if a different Survivor already cleansed one, I need to look *extra* hard to find the broken remains of that totem. I can't *assume* my teammates will find that last totem. I *have* to find it to counter noed consistently. Do you know how long it takes to find all 5 totems? The least the Devs could do is add a little picture by the gens that show how many totems are left. This way "just get all the totems 4Head" will be a valid argument.
---
&gt;Dribbling is not always possible since you have to be already near a hook
---
This is when you slug. Slugging is the same as hooking a Survivor except you don't get progress towards their hook. The slugged Survivor can't do anything and another Survivor has to get off their gen and come pick them up. That time is a lot more valuable than eating the DS and getting the hook later. This game for Killer, as it stands now, is a time management game. That one hook doesn't matter. 
---
I did one, tell me what you think:
---
The "Entity's"last breath
---
An ethereal last breath given to the nurse by the entity itself. In the hands of the nurse, it rattles with unnatural power.
---
Tremendously decreases fatigue time.
---
Adds 1/2 extra blinks. 
---
Slightly/Moderately decreases the maximum range of the blink.
---
Slightly decreases the chain blink window.
---
Moderately decreases accuracy. 
---
What‚Äôs wrong with pointing
---
In waiting for then to hit us with the "hes now the entity" or he was the entity this entire time. Something along the lines.
---
IMHO opinion, save all your shards for the side you don‚Äôt main. For example, if you play killer, buy the survivor perks you want. This will cut your bloodweb counts way down and require you to do way less grinding for the side you don‚Äôt really play.
---
Theres a comment above explaining how I do it, was gonna post one earlier, but I forgot :(
---
It‚Äôs good, but I think it only needs one extra blink though because of the tremendous decrease in fatigue time, as it lets the Nurse get lots of pressure quickly.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs not like we have any perks or any items that could help track, locate, or do something about totems, right? 
---
Everytime i witness a dead hard i hear in the distance *fookin dead ard*
---
Now that I think about it, he does have a metric fuck ton of bugs and downsides to his playstyle but despite this I still get 4k's 90% of the time (Using thick cork stopper and chloroform).
---
But regarding 3, he only slows down when you're reloading and 1 second after throwing the bottles.
---
5.2, they always slow down for me at least.
---
5.4, this only ever happens to me after throwing at least 3 bottles at the same survivor in a short amount of time. I think this was done purposely to not earrape the killer or survivor with location notifications.
---
 All killers have their own bugs and downsides but with enough practice you can master them. Thank you for actually explaining your reasoning for thinking clown is low tier, unlike some people.
---
oh man I love dishing out pain to survivors who keep trying to do this xD  
---
It's mindblowing how they think they can get away with their cockiness   
---
What‚Äôs worse is the new matchmaking they‚Äôre rolling out is going to more consistently load the four survivors in together. So I‚Äôm basically prepared to get dodged out often. Hopefully when they add dedicated servers, we can either stay in squad together, or it treats the killer leaving like a survivor left, just wait to find a new killer. 
---
tbh this would actually make me hate legion less.
---
Also sorry for being rude in the first comment I had just woken up and these threads tend to rustle me to heck.
---
i always feel so bad for the thicc bird getting yelled at, you can tell how fucking annoyed he is and it makes me sad
---
and how would that Perk be any useful at all?
---
Sounds like a way way way way worse Bloodwarden
---
Mind games.
---
So Leatherface has one of the best perks in the game which is called BBQ&amp;Chilli. The reason it is really good is that the first time you hook a survivor you get a stackable bonus of 15/20/25 % (Tier 1,2 and 3) more bloodpoints at the END of the match. If you usually end a match with 24k bpoints, then with tier 3 bbq you get 48k if you hooked all the survivors at least once.
---
So if you hook the 4 survivors at least once, you can get up to double bloodpoints which is insane for farming.
---
Also, the perk is also really good tracking tool because everytime you hook a survivor you can see the aura ( a red silhouette of survivors) of the other survivors when they are farther than 52/46/40 metres away from the hook.
---
To sum it up, if you are leveling LF, it is way more efficient to play him as you will have BBQ&amp;Chili right from the start which means 60/80/100 % more bloodpoints per match.
---
1st person survivor vs someone like Spirit or Pig would be terrifying
---
Just had a killer ‚Äúprotect‚Äù his totem for a good 4 minutes. D/c‚Äôed after I cleansed it. GG
---
Survivors don‚Äôt screech, too scared for that. We speak coherently and explain our stances, killers like yourself are more of the types to whip around and start with the screech fest. As is my case and point when you showed up and essentially started, as mentioned, said screech fest in my comments.
---
I'm with you bro.
---
Down here, salt is a way of life
---
Imagine getting this tilted about a game.
---
Instead of making one killer weaker, why not make other killers stronger and increase the diversity at red ranks? Solves the same issue while not neutering anyone.
---
It is now for sure, I‚Äôm more looking ahead after the change. It won‚Äôt be
---
No problem! I tend to be more survivor oriented, so i don‚Äôt see issues like infinite looping when it comes to changes like these. You brought up a lot of good points
---
I've never seen survs expected to play a certain way to please the killer, but plenty of people complaining about the killer not running to the other side of the map immediately after hook.
---
People who camp*
---
Glad I'm not the only one confused, didn't know what to say. 
---
I‚Äôm not even necessarily titled, I just see a lot of stuff get posted about things people find annoying and decided to hop on the boat, I also debate by nature so when I do things like this I tend to make a spectacle of it. 
---
DStrike was killed with the hook-density changes anyway. Non-obsessions couldn't hit it anymore anyway, and atleast 50% of the time it was exploited, uhm "dribbled" as Killers prefer to call it for obvious reasons. DStrike will atleast 90% of the matches hit just once and most of the good players/Killers can afford to tank that anyway. Especially if they're using Enduring or simply play high-tier Killers.
---
The new DStrike seems...Actually ok. It appears to be an anti-tunneling pillow while it can also be used to go for reckless dives as they'll finally negate "dribbling". Meaning it hasn't just one but two niches, which's ok as I'd hate it to see even more perks like Deliverance that are so extremely niche that they turn out to be useful like once every ten games.
---
In terms of NOED tho...I see too many (ironically mostly Killer mains :^)) people thinking that the perk is fine due to the fact that the totems it's tied to can simply be cleansed. But to be honest that's simply not true. A perk which's bare existence will force Survivors to waste several minutes of valueable time just to deny a perk which might not even be existence in the first place definetly IS an issue. Especially given how impactful time as a resource in this game actually is. Thus, the bare existence of NOED rewards Killers against paranoid or simply annoyed Survivors, punishes solo-players (as are SWF obviously capable of counting totems cleansed in total), while also rewarding the Killer even tho the perk is cleansed already thanks to the cleansing progress of the perk requiering muuuch too long. The only possibillity to deny NOED without giving the Killer a literally free game is by destroying the hex while the exit is powered but that has it's obvious risks and downsides.
---
To be honest, when I take a look at the two perks, I'm more Pro-DStrike biased. Which's sad considering I haven't used it since the exhaustion-nerfs (Vigil/DS/SB was so dumb back in the day lol). But in the very end I'm more fond of a perk that can actually promoted AND denied by a certain amount of skill. Good Killers can dare to tank it while only good Survivors will get a good value out of the perk. NOED on the other hand is the only perk that influences games even tho it isn't even existent in said session, something I absolutely can't stand for while also rewarding less experienced Killers and definetly has a lower skill-requierement in terms of "getting value out of the perk" than DStrike has.

---
NOED is so fucking simple to counter but y'all keep complaining. 
---
Depends on context.  It can be a way to taunt the killer into or during a chase. Almost as if to say "I see you and I'm good enough at looping that I can afford to stop to do this animation."
---
I feel like the game is decently balanced. Noed and DS are just a bit annoying to me but it's fun to play anyways. I play both sides basically 50/50 and the only thing that makes me not wanna play is toxic survivors or when the game wouldn't let you fast vault certain windows (like between rlthe buses on autohaven of in that one house in Michaels map) 
---
The same logic for decisive. Just resume chase. I‚Äôm saying it is hypocritical to complain about Decisive when you have something like that in tow. 
---
Agreed. But as it stands don't you think it's unfair that DS gets all these changes while NOED stands stronger than ever? I hate both but I'm annoyed that NOED wasn't altered as well. It doesn't seem right at all. 
---
ok I wont either 
---
That's it, I'm gettin me mallet
---
The rules about tunnelling is ridiculous, you can get called a tunneller because you'd dare hit someone when they get unhooked 5 seconds after you just hooked them.
---
i hate that it's actually good
---
That's the thing. You'd think that, yet you get to the end game and boom, NOED. It's like these P3 Nurses at rank 1 who use both Ruin and NOED even though they shouldn't be using either. 
---
It‚Äôs like bringing an escape cake every game if you manage to get 4 tokens.

What‚Äôs the bait?

---
VERY LATE but I meant to reply with their surprise factor making them harder to avoid if a killer doesn‚Äôt pay attention to the hand wave your character does when you drop it. 
---
I play for laughs so im always winning
---
Correct. No red light for T1 Michael. 
---
Yeah but LF doesn't get a speed boost after the chainsaw is revved like Billy. Billy could have a slow down and still close the gap after he's done revving.
---
I think it would help if they would take feedback from top tier killers/survivors with 2-3k hours. Someone like Zubat is very fair minded when it comes to both survivor and killer.
---
Instead of listening to the forums emotional QQ fest.
---
Yeah same thing happened to me. I was leveling bubba and just as i got BBQ &amp; Chili it appeared in the shrine the very next day. Then i woke up and remembered that BBQ will never be in the shrine because BHVR want to have their 5$ 
---
some of it is A poses which signifies a beta male or female 
---
Well spoken. My survivor rank is about 15 and I've been farmed by fucking P3 Claudettes. In one instance she literally followed the killer up to the hook, unhooked me as soon as I was done. The killer understandably smacked me and I was on death hook, but both the killer and I were enraged and reported her. 
---
You know who you are if you're this stupid, STUPID farmer. 
---
Whilst situational, balanced landing is already a really good perk. It makes the killer's life hell on certain maps already.
---
It doesn't need a rework, it's already well balanced... No pun intended... Ok, maybe a little bit of intention...
---
Don't need to think it, I've played against it. Ran into several killers who didn't use NOED or even ruin, or a black mori, and they still managed to kill at least 2 of us in the lobby. All comes down to survivors planning terribly and killers patrolling properly.
---
Of course we COULD get a PTB next week, but normally we get a teaser the week before the PTB.
---
I'm not complaining, I don't need NOED. Just like I don't need DS and make sure I cleanse all the totems.
---
YougetthecapemotesAND?!Linkage

Why do you cry so much on reddit? Don't play dbd for a week, it will make you feel a lot better.

---
#FUSION
---
What? Yeah that happens but I never said NOED was the only problem. The gap between SWF and solo is a big issue and you're bound to die if you and your team aren't coordinated. Solo play makes that harder to do but killers are also a lot stronger when it comes to solos because of the SWF gap the devs decide not to fix. 
---
I thought it was You get the camel's hand.

What are you trying to say about THE HUM?
---

PSA - Just because i disconnect doesn't mean because it was how you loaded in/ what you're carrying. I simply do not want to play with people who need the crutch of having 200+ ping(I know not your fault but i ain't playing with it) Besides that, finding matches doesn't take longer than 5 minutes for me. On either side.
---
Equally, killers can rely on over altruism. Use Mad Grit, Discordance etc and it balances back out. There's ways and means of dealing with a SWF group that don't rely on several people not being able to play for the best part of an hour because lobbies are broken. Besides, who really cares if they win or lose a game? The ranking system means nothing. 
---
Yeah the devs say they listen but they don't listen to the right people IMO. I'm in no way saying I'm the best person to listen to because NOED truly does annoy me more than DS ever did but still. 
---
It was great work.  Hope you guys had fun at the show.
---
They are just showing their hitboxes.
---
They're probably realizing their time is coming to an end and getting as much time as they can.
---
Lol i did too for the longest
---
I don't get why people not just leave. stood 10 minutes yesterday before some guy finally left. I ain't pushing you out lol. 
---
I play Survivor when I'm with my mate, and killer when I've seen gens done within the first minute of the game. It's never a fun start when you're the killer
---
The hardest t-pose of the 20th century imo
---
i already regret it for him.  a tattoo from a mediocre game with a cry baby fan base.  
---
They should either remove SWF or remove 3rd person.  But they won't cause the fan base is shitty whiners.
---
I could kill that cunt with two hands tied behind my back he‚Äôs not good
---
I was thinking, something along the lines of throwing pies, huntress style and then applying a speed debuff called ‚Äúfull stomach‚Äù
---
sadly I cant, and always end up at Red ranks if I play for more than 3 days straight...
---
that would be quite the plot twist
---
Can't wait till the new killer comes out, i have gotten a lot of blood points in preparations for the PTB, so i can enjoy the new power.
---
‚Äúonly one obsession PER MATCH*
---
Omg! This happened to me and I had no idea it was a known bug. I was finishing the last gen and this billy blindsided me out of nowhere. I didn‚Äôt notice him until he was right on top of me because there was no heartbeat and no chase music. Someone completed the gen I‚Äôd been working on while I was being chased and I got hit with NOED and facecamped once the exit gates were powered since the killer hadn‚Äôt managed to kill anyone yet.
---
Also experienced a similar thing with Legion. The chase music will start up even though the killer is no where near me.
---
*This happens to you*
---
*A survivor gets too cocky and you down and hook them*
---
Get flamed as a toxic killer
---
I never said that they did say that. I was just saying because people act as if all survive with friends are try harder who make it their goal to ruin the killers game.
---
You can use A or An. An does sound really funky when you use it in that sentence though. 
---
An 'ealing item
---
No one: we‚Äôre gonna rework noed!, me: *sadness noise*
---
Is it the pubes on display?
---
As far as I know it used to give you more items of higher rarity - but ever since the prices were changed to fit the rarity (like 3k for brown, 4k for yellow etc.) it hasn't had any effect on how many rare items appear. 
---
Handing the game to killers? Survivors still have the advantage by quite a long shot, the game is only becoming more balanced every time they tone down survivors. Once killers start winning every match, they can ‚Äòhand the game to survivors‚Äô again.
---
I play with SWF to get low rank games with People like you
---
You're saying that this is fine? 
---
this is scam account right ?
---
no, most Killers wont even care and you make yourself look like a fool.
---
Killers laugh about that :D
---
*runs this and complains about ds*
---
**P I E  F L A V O R**
---
I love Franklins because even when I lose to a SWF with baller items and they lose them... it‚Äôs still a win in my book.
---
"A perk which's bare existence will force Survivors to waste several minutes of valuable time just to deny a perk which might not even be in existence in the first place definitely is an issue"
---
Except it's not. Risk is a huge part of this game. You don't know what the other side is running for a reason. It's why people do other stuff, like hopping in lockers to deny a potential BBQ or dribbling (old) DS (when some people ran Sole Survivor for that very reason). You're supposed to evaluate the situation in-game and determine if you want to spend the time doing one thing (cleansing totems and deny NOED), or something else (do gens as fast as possible and risk it). Survivors shouldn't just get to focus on gens without any issue, they go fast enough at high ranks already.
---
Bing Bong
---
Also the killer: complains about ds

As u/ArcheologyNotebook said, you can use both. It all comes down to pronunciation, really.

A if you pronounce the h; an if you skip the h.

With that said, a healing is more universal, as far as I know. An healing is entering thick English accent territory.

---
Word. Can you link me to a copy of these DMs of which you speak
---
And yet, in this sub, every survivor is painted to be a ds using, flashlight abusing, pallet t-bagging asswipe. Killers can be just as toxic, and there‚Äôs a lot of toxic killers out there. Through out the years, I‚Äôve consistently seen buff after buff, either directly or indirectly for killers to have an upper hand, and for a time they sure as hell needed it. After a while, killer mains are even bigger crybabies than the toxic survivors. Killers constantly say there‚Äôs no rules as to how this game should be played, yet they whine when survivors use the tools given to them, be it flashlights and bullshit like ds. My point being, people are hypocrites.
---
Suing DBD for gameplay balance? Let me get my popcorn, this salt is limited edition!
---
Nw, did remember it was part of a devstream and did just go through them and found the statistics part snuggly hidden in the text :D
---
It is good to see that number wise, the game is in a decent spot of balance, and that the highest priority will be balancing the extreme edge cases, instead of the core.
---
I'm glad I understood that reference. 
---
I'm sorry but what?
---
Ochido is suing because he got banned lol. Frivolous lawsuit at best.
---
It's not going to be a Legion rework.
---

...did you just complain about survivors being forced to do something other than generators?
---
&gt;A perk which's bare existence will force Survivors to waste several minutes of valueable time just to deny a perk which might not even be existence in the first place definetly IS an issue.
---
Anything that adds time to the game for killers is a good thing.  The threat of cleanse totems or maybe get NOEDed is good for all killers all across the board. 
---
This is so pathetic lol. 
---
its been objectively getting easier to hit survs in almost every case. Remember the update that supposedly stopped hitting through pallets? It worked for like a week. vaulted a window and second ago and aren't in the animation? hit. Just sayin
---
No terror radius or red stain. Make all footsteps louder to compensate. No progress bars or status bars. I even wanna say no perks in general lol.
---
Itd be more fun if it was actually a game where killers can just pop up on you and scare you.  
---
Fingerguns now dammit!
---
That‚Äôs one of the best parts about it, how surreal the dream sequences get.
---
Wow, that was epic. Took me like 5 times to really understand what was going on xD
---
I can‚Äôt see it happening this soon (or a major adjustment) but it‚Äôs just a wild stretch. We don‚Äôt seem to have any clue what‚Äôs coming and we know that the devs know that we are not very happy with the state Legion is in. 
---
Cool idea. Most wouldn't play without their crutches though
---
If killer is running obsession perk, obsession gets chosen at random.  If Dstrike gets used, obsession is now who used it.
---
&gt; graphs 
---
Aren't these numbers skewed from the Hallowed Blight?
---
Aw man, that‚Äôs rough :( especially with the shard

It‚Äôs really not a lot of time if the survivor isn‚Äôt a complete potato. The fact a competent survivor can render his own perk useless in a chase is stupid. It‚Äôs a pretty weak rework as it stands, but has potential to be much better.
---
That‚Äôs how they do it in English English.  Weird that the American English speaking DbD team would choose this way to show that they‚Äôre actually tea-sipping queen-sniffing redcoat spies, but whatever.
---
the whole risk of using hex totems is that they can spawn out in the open or tucked away in a corner.

I've also always tried to face the killer when crouching so it's like a head nod, face away for a teabag. But I dont teabag unless a killer is INCREDIBLY toxic or has a really high ping with lots of lag after the lobby ping was low. 
---
rofl, by "fun" you mean easy games and yet you still come on here to brag about saying GG EZ to killers at low ranks
---
don't worry aduuud we know your type
---
I did think about the terror radius thing! I think it might be too strong, whilst making Mikey pretty much irrelevant. It would be pretty fun though.
---
I fully agree with footsteps to make tracking easier, along with injured moaning to help lead survs to their injured teammates to heal.
---
I see the same immersed shit with Enpathy and Bond.  I usually run one or the other.  Immsersiveness has completely taken over random queues and it's disgusting.  They are quite literally worthless to have as teamates and the Claudettes are the worst offenders by far.  I ran a fucking Nurse for 5 minutes total on Preschool.  We died with 4 gens done.  Guess who repaired 3 of them?....
---
I really like the art. Where is it from?
---
at least for the last 6 months you can
---
I am pretty sure it only has been numbers from before HB or collected over a longer timeframe where HB didn't have much of a impact, but I will look at the devstream again to see them confirm it.
---
just let him keep his illusion.

Makes for some delicious end game chat if a "Baby Killer" gets him :D

So you didn‚Äôt even know that it was intended in the first place.

This is why I never listen survivor complaints. You have no idea how this game works

I'm sorry but that's a stupid perk to run especially at red ranks. The extra progress from a great skill check is minimal compared to the progress you'd have if you weren't crouching around not doing gens.
---
If you're gonna complain about queue times don't make up such a ridiculously high number

Agreed. I got mine for me and they mean something to me, if you don't understand them well that's why they're on my body and not yours stranger. 
---
&gt;I just did some googling and apparently they've always been able to? 
---
Correct.
---
kek
---
Why is that never in shrine or any dlc on sale for ps4? Steam sale like every month but no consoles.
---
THey also thought pallet vaccuums was fine, originally, as was near instant heals, or perma-hook sabos. Just because they CURRENTLY think something's right at that point in time, doesn't mean it permanently is. They CURRENTLY think it's fine because most people that use it, only get kills at the end, but the way the game is progressing, more and more people are picking it up just on account of 'Fuck it, everyone's doing it'. Noed has actually seen more use than d-strike on average, AND secured more kills than d-strike has won games.
---
You seem to live in your own little bubble where you think everything the devs say will always be right, even though most people agree on the complaints larger names bring up, meaning that clearly, the devs aren't *perfect*
---
I really don't see the problem with this after the fucking healing changes.
---
(Unnecessarily vitriolic response including a threat to report you for spam)
---
I think this argument is actually bigger than salty Survivors or salty Killers. Without any gen slowing perks, (or being Nurse/Billy) Gens ARE done too fast when it comes to more adept players. Hex ruin is nearly a necessity against competent players.
---
If games were slower, for example by giving the killer more incentive to leave survivors on the ground, I think it makes for a richer game and meta. Perks like deer stalker, insidious, tenacity and unbreakable would be more reliable. In my opinion, mini-games like totems or The Pig are good examples of healthy game lengthening mechanics.
---
Nah but still, you gotta be more transparent about when you have noed, it‚Äôs pretty a fifth perk slot 
---
It is 1/9 if it is included at all (and it is reasonable to expect that BHVR did indeed exclude those 2 days). Add to that that most people had been finished by the time, and the survivors that suicide on hook after collecting definitely depiped, sometimes even 2 depips, the data for the high rank still would be accurate. It is arguable that the lower rank data is skewed, but it would need a lot of data to skew it into the direction of 2 to 3 survivors escaping on average.
---
(Post refering to you as "salty" or "toxic" and calling you out as preferring or only playing one side despite zero evidence to prove as such)
---
WOW CRY MORE SALTY KILLER MAIN
---
I'm not sure what you are saying, but if I understood it correctly, it's already how it's supposed to be. Since the skillcheck will appear during the pickup animation (that's mentioned in the changes), not after you're picked up from the ground, even if you're downed right on front of the hook the killer won't have time to hook you after picking you up if you hit your DS.
---
(Reminiscing on a time when a survivor was nice or offered constructive criticism, and wishing all survs were like that)
---
You're an unbelievably biased killer main, get your head out of your arse, if you cleanse all the totems you won't be able to get all the generators done in time against a killer who actually knows how to play the game. It's that, or do five gens super quick, and risk getting snowballed on by NOED. It's not weak, you're just thick.
---
*clears throat* JUST DONT TUNNEL ONE SURVIVOR IDIOT
---
Yeah, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be as overpowered with the current game meta but they‚Äôre not going to bring it back. A lot of the stuff they removed or changed when the game was new was to help gameplay balance for both sides but, imo, it seems a lot of changes now are either completely out of the blue or to appease the player base‚Äôs incessant complaints.
---
Flair is discussion but it clearly should be whining lmao 
---
Can i still have your queue times? It takes me 20 minutes to get a game that isn't 300+ ping/stuck in loading screen, and even then it's most likely a 3v1 :/
---
I'm a survivor main, and I agree with most everything you're saying... Except for the NOED part. NOED is powerful, but definitely not broken. It's counterable in a much more thought out and doable way than DS was. It's also much more situational than DS was. I really don't see that much problem with it.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, I honestly think that if they reworked all of the maps, except for the actually good ones, this game would become infantesimally (?) Better. The infinite loops would've over, and everything else would, too.
---
Thunder Punch He-Man confirmed for next Killer.
---
fine
---
Skeletor confirmed for next Killer.
---
I think the issue the devs have with that is low rank survivors that just play casually and who already struggle a lot. Everytime there is a slight nerf to survivors they complain about them getting nerfed over and over again. So I think they just don't know the potential of survivors. So making the games longer would hurt these players even though I think the game should be balanced around the true potential of a role. But casuals make the game live so, finding a middle ground is pretty tough. 
---
To be fair the h is silent in Quebec
---
You can also counter your own perk just by reaching a pallet and eating up a large chunk of the clock. It‚Äôs a situational situational perk, if that makes sense. You not only need the situation of being tunneled, but also a specific requirement beyond that. Not a useful perk.
---
It needs to be those times, but the clock stops during chase, and also when downed obviously. This means if you are tunneled, you are either going to get away, or be able to use your perk.
---
So since I have been hit with noed before I‚Äôm a bad player? What about pro players who have been hit by noed? Are they bad too?
---
Be quiet.
---
My French friend always says Da hair is blowing trip my air 
---
The air is blowing through my hair.
---
They rushed the objective, and refused to do totems. 
---
And the best part is... as a former Leatherface main, I can say that making him better than he currently is wouldn't even be hard. The main problem with his power comes from the fact that it's bugged. His m.s. during his chainsaw attack doesn't go back from 87% to 115% as it's supposed to, instead it stops at  ¬±110% (and this is probably the reason why his Chili addons don't work).
---
Then how will you ever lose them?
---
Who the fuck needs SWF to get to red ranks?
---
And what if I‚Äôm chased and get tunneled and don‚Äôt even have time to do gens?
---
That's a really good point you have there, YES risk is definetly a part of the game. However there is in my opinion a certain amount of "risk" you should invest to deny certain perks. The examples you mentioned are in the very end definetly legit, however just a extremely tiny investment in comparasion to NOED. Hiding behind a gen to counter BBQ or dribble a Survivor is obviously not even close to the time investment that NOED requieres to be "denied". Plus it's actually pretty stretchy in terms of cleansing all the totems, it could requiere "just" 2 minutes but also 3 or even 4 depending on totem positioning and the fact that we're still human and also might overlook 'em. In addition a lot of perks reveal 'emselfes thanks to Killer-behavior. Does the Killer ran straight into while you're on the way to the unhook? With a good chance it's BBQ. Does that Killer head straight onto you while you're healing? Nurse's Calling it is. Ruin exposes itself immediately, just to name a few examples. NOED however is absolutely unpredictable and requieres too much effort and time to be played around in comparasion to other perks.
---
I definetly understand that we need a secondary objective, I don't like the game being fast paced either as this limits too many Killers (and especially Freddy) while making Killers that have a good amount of lethality and mobillity too strong (looking at you Billy, Nurse is a special snowflake anyway so not worth mentioning). But I think the devs should actually start to conceptionize a secondary objective instead of relying on perks to do that. Hex perks are a neat concept, sure. And they actually do their job pretty well in that regard but NOED is quite the exception. Not in regard to the secondary objective-thing, in that case it's almost too good. But simply due to the reasons I mentioned earlier.
---
WOW CRY MORE SALTY SURVIVOR MAIN
---
Ok, if you close to the gate I could see the issue there. Otherwise I really don‚Äôt see 60 sec being enough time to do anything. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever timed my crawls, but they usually seem much longer.
---
Oh god. Freddy stay out of my dreams please. 
---
I've had pretty huge break from the game when they introduced the Player-Level system :&lt;
---
Oh do they? Why would it tho, I thought the whole purpose was to prevent seal-clubbing in the first place.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see what buzzword we use for what comes after 4k 
---
How about a brief period of time as the game starts, when gens can't be repaired? Like one-two minutes at mid ranks and maybe two-three minutes on high? Encourages survs to do totems and chests first and not gen rush, killer is boosted a bit by this.

After a set amount of weeks, the ranks reset. The higher your rank, the higher you start at at the reset. So if you‚Äôre around 15/13, you‚Äôll reset near 19/17, then obviously if you‚Äôre rank 1 you‚Äôll drop to around 14/12 *I THINK*
---
Ur taking it too serious as well :P   
---
What I wanna say is that Spirit is close to Nurse imo\~
---
Theres already 8k so I imagine ‚ÄúFull 8k‚Äù lol
---
I don't associate with that, if that's the case. And I see plenty of people defending survivors in here. Of course killers can be toxic, that wasn't my point. I was just saying that not all Leatherfaces are tunelling assholes. You're paining with a much larger brush. 
---
Adding voice comms will kill this game. 
---
it would be better if huntress got a skin that was a latina mother that would throw slippers at the survivors
---
Whispers with Monitor and Abuse is a really fun Combo on the Pig. When you go near a generator and Whispers triggers you can sneak up to them and try to grab them off.
---
For addons:    
---
-Anything that gives you more traps and boxes make the game easier since they spend more time on the boxes. Useful for sure but as fun as Ruin basically. Just extra time.    
---
-Crate of Gears + Tampered Timer can be really nasty and can give you a surprising amount of headpops if you're into that. (Up to you if that is fun/useful).    
---
-Everything that interacts with the crouch and dash attack is decent. These are fortunately all brown and yellow, so you can get a lot of them. With the newest buff to the Pig I don't know if they're necessary anymore though. You should test out if they help you.     
---
-Amanda's Letter is a lot of fun; Rules Set No. 2 is garbage.    
---
That bird can fuck some shit up. 
---
Did I mention any changes to NOED though? Don't think so. Perk itself can stay exactly the same. It's the Small Game that is underperforming, and solo survivor coordination problem that creates an illusion of the game being killer sided. 
---
Killers have never been underpowered. They're just unfun to play against competent survivors since it's up to the survivors to make the mistakes
---
As a killer main I can agree, it's certainly not the start you want. But completing gens is the survivors objective. As killer we need to adjust to that and slow the game down ...  *just a little bit.*
---
Nah don't be passive-aggressive, it's cringey. I'm just saying that skill level has both to do with whether you have less fun facing voice-comm squads, I could spell it out for you if you're confused how it can suck some fun out of matches. But I feel like you're purposely playing dumb if you really needed an explanation... 
---
True but for new players it def helps having NOED, plus it‚Äôs fun having it when you go up against a group of toxic SWF groups, I see there are some salty people on here about these perks since my comment got downvoted, but seriously NOED isn‚Äôt that big of a deal, DS I have had so many people last min whip it out and run out the gate or prolong me from hooking them and I‚Äôm glad about the rework they are doing for it,  it NOED is fine in my opinion and I‚Äôm serious on what‚Äôs next? The saying goes if you give a mouse a cookie, he‚Äôs gonna want a glass of milk next and so on... yah BhVR is more worried about making as much money as possible, saying fuck you to the customer and not fixing the game at all! 
---
So we will see how it goes in the future but if people would quit buying shit from them and put the foot down and say we are not spending another penny until you fix the game it would send a BIG CLEAR MESSAGE TO BHVR! 
---
Im still low, I just want to bp bonus.  Should be a base perk for all that increases bp.

That's how you do it fam.

---
&gt; reasonable to expect
---
You might be giving them too much credit. 
---
There are times that it flat out wins games. 
---
A lot of survivors that run it are bad and will just get downed 10-20 seconds after using it. In those cases it's only "meh" as a perk. But in the hands of a great survivor it's completely broken. 
---
Killers rely on hook pressure if they invest time in a chase, and a perk that denies that and allows a survivor to run to a new area of the map and start looping again is just too strong.
---
As a person who uses neither of them I find this slightly amusing
---
dbd is all about mistakes. the more you make, the more likely you gonna lose... and bad survivors can make pretty huge mistakes. like starting gens on one side of the map and working their way to the other side, so that the last 3 gens are close to each other. you cant balance that. 
---
survivors are the ones who decide how the game will go. having this power AND super strong perks isnt good for the game.
---
I shouldn't need to use a perk slot in order for gens to be completed in a fair amount of time.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Mine looks the same i dont play like i used to before devotion.
---
1 drops to 10. 
---
Update! I just escaped again... same build. Still nothing. Goddamn this game sucks sometimes.
---
the nurse is just a baby
---
Do you not know how to screenshot
---
I don't believe so either. You had a tell who was running DS and could dribble them. Unless it's 4SWF all running DS lol. 
---
If you are insinuating they hacked, you shouldn‚Äôt as devotion has only been around for less than a year.
---
Pink addon is fun for jump scares.
---
You can drop from 15-16 and two pips or something like that and it slowly goes down more.
---
Good for you? Whatever makes you happy, bro. 
---
Yeah and in most these games people complain about toxic teammates, could you imagine how bad will it be for dbd? This would be too much of a change to add to already existing game, where most survivors are trying to just relax and chill. + a lot of perks are created around survivors not having comms and just completely making a lot of perks useless is not fun. 
---
Are you okay? Have you ever played solo? The only way it's 'balanced' is if it's a killer vs a 3/4 man SWF or they are *all* incredibly competent (quite hard to come by at the moment, especially with the rank 20-15 change making it so much easier for new players to rank up). The devs already said 30-40% of survivors escape every game (most of which are probably big groups of SWF) meaning that the game is already proven to lean towards the killer side. If you think that the correct way to balance a game is to buff one side until they 'win every match' then clearly you don't know what you're talking about. 
---
Everyones level of fuck it all is different youll get there friend
---
Who was talking to you?
---
Gang gang
---
Exactly. I end up disregarding pretty much every decent piece of fanart because its most likely stolen, which isn't at all fair on the actual artists on this sub. 
---
baha no you're not alone. also if you get that gen done it sort of keeps the illusion up that it indeed works!
---
Lol actually brags about teabagging and bm in game but calls you the kid....is anyone here a doctor, I got hit really hard right in the irony?
---
Here have a downvote.
---
I sent you my knife please respond
---
You sound like you would like to get facecamped by me. 
---
Fair enough. Definitely would have been better if it was guaranteed it did not have such influences. In the end, I wish they would be more open with their data (personal data in the game, but also public general data) since it is usually pretty interesting.
---
One of my favorite tactics is to act like I didn‚Äôt see someone and then charge at them I wish I could see the look of horror on their face when that happens
---
Meh, it helps me when every killer wants to run ruin and I‚Äôm on PS4 so hitting great skill checks is harder for me. I didn‚Äôt say that was all I was doing, I simply said if I am crouching by a killer , that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. I can be doing a gen, he comes, I leave and crouch. Plus sometimes that‚Äôs all I have when I get a daily with my level 30 Adam Francis. 
---
I love running perks that you might not normally see. I still make it either out the gates or last one alive so think that all you want. 
---
Played a couple of games as Hag, one of which I had my 1st entire team disconnect against me because they couldn't find my hex: ruin totem. I was going to message the last guy left so we could farm but they disconnected before I could do so.
---
A few games after that my Hex: Ruin was in an easier place to find. After sacrificing one survivor and another one who disconnected, there was 2 survivors left, both Megs and still 5 gens left to do. I decided to be kind and farm with them. Because of how my games usually go when I'm playing Hag with Hex: Ruin: I usually feel bad and end up wanting to farm.
---
Meg 1 got the hint and we farmed bloodpoints, Meg 2 on the other hand didn't no matter how hard I tried to make it as clear as I could. In the end Meg 1 escaped with over 30k bloodpoints, Meg 2 on the other hand disconnected and didn't get any points. I got maybe 35k bloodpoints because of an offering I took
---
That's not the only face-something I'd like you to do to me, but that will do for a start.
---
I will, as long as there are people who want to see me/Daddy Myers. 
---
I got trapped inside a locker and had to dc just yesterday.  Shame because it was a good game too.
---
You again.
---
Gentle? I thought about getting all in.
---
The knife would look good in you. 
---
&lt;3
---
Why would you do that here? 
---
Throws flashlight
---
Then you're not really the last survivor, are you?  And as soon as that person on death hook is considered dead in the game, you will no longer be able to struggle.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Alright, then come back once you've gotten a little more experience in DbD and then tell me NOED is 'weak'. Smartarse. Respond, and you're blocked.
---
I‚Äôve seen people say that the adept achievements (not sure if it‚Äôs all or just a few) are bugged right now 
---
No hatch, opening the door and running straight out.
---
I think NOED would be fine if it gave more information to survivors. NOED giving survivors a status that goes away when all the dull totems are cleansed, maybe with slight dull aura reading abilities if need be would be fine. Then survs have enough information to choose whether to take on NOED or not.
---
Dead Hard 3, No Mither 3, We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever 1. Literally nothing else. No items, add-ons, or offerings.
---
Voice comms was mentioned because of your comments about you and your team not being coordinated. Voice comms would make coordinating easier, but you might  well just play SWF if you want to talk to the other people, so I'm glad you saw my point there.
---
Auto Kindred and a totem count wouldn't be as helpful as you think. Only 5 totems spawn on a map, and the spawns are wash enough to figure out. On the Mcmillian estate maps for example, at least 2 totems spawn in the cornfields. Kindred, for as little as my friends and I have used it, only seems to work if your in the general area of another survivor, which if your playing correctly, you shouldn't be that way too often unless you're looking to heal them or speed up the fixing of the last generator.
---
Let's also change the name to "unbalanced perk"
---
i think both are in an ok place right now just for freddy adrenaline shouldnt wake you up but should just give the speed boost and health state because when that happens to a freddy that person is gone gone
---
I post a meme like this and get a bunch of hate from survivor mains but this comment section is filled with people who want to actually talk. smh
---
WOW CRY MORE SALTY SPECTATOR MAIN
---
Oh
---
Thanks for the correction on Kindred.
---
Now, if people who know that killers are running NOED more, I would hazard a guess that they are cleansing totems they run across.
---
Looks like Ramona from Scott Pilgrim vs the World!
---
Nice job!
---
I‚Äôm not even going to merit such drivel with a response. Re-read my message and feel free to try again.
---
When I first started playing, I had no idea sandbagging was a thing. I thought we were dancing/celebrating getting to the gate. Whenever a killer let my SWF partner and I live,  we would start doing synchronized crouches, chanting "We're not worthy! We're not worthy!" and we had absolutely \*zero\* clue that the killer might find this insulting. 
---
Not every survivor who crouches this is being mean! We use crouching to convey a lot of meanings. Saying hi/thank you to other survivors, indicating to another survivor you need to be healed or snapped out of it, etc. Usually, a quick double crouch to the killer means "thanks!". It'd be nice to have more emotes as a survivor. Currently we have "come here" and "over there" (though "over there" is also used to say "you fucked up my gen and you should be ashamed" to teammates). I'd love a thumbs up and thumbs down emote in the future, too!
---
I try to remember that killers don't know my intent, so now when I want to give props to the killer, I crouch and nod instead. On the rare occasions that I play killer, the only time I personally get annoyed by sandbagging is when players do it right after pallet slamming, because there really is no way to misinterpret *that* as anything but an insult XD
---
Yeah that's the thing, not a lot of players actually 
---
I just thought of it at work and had go post it. Got a link to the other 
---
Unpopular Opinion: Searching for the Totem is a waste of time and someone will cleanse it in due course. It‚Äôs worth it to just do gens as normal.
---
Having 4 survivors running around looking for it at the start makes it more effective than it actually is.
---
BBQ is useless now...
---
There are 2, the one you are talking about is Amanda's letter
---
I'm not saying you should use it. I was pointing it out that IF gens took longer, those perks would just be insanely more effective, I mean you can completely destroy like over half a gens progress and completely regress it with the right perk setup and pressure rather quickly. Regression is percentage based. So regressing say upwards of 40% of a gen is much more effective if the gen takes like 120 seconds to complete as opposed to 80 seconds.
---
My point was overall saying making gens take longer to do is not the answer. People tend to clearly forget that not every survivor out there is an efficient gen jockey that can do a gen in seconds hitting 20 greats in a row against Ruin and Lullaby combined.
---
If the maps were designed well then a killer can efficiently monitor gens in a fair way to ensure their slower progress themselves. Then they wouldn't come into unfair loops and IF the killer is efficient at chases will greatly slow gen progress organically by injuring, downing, hooking, and chasing survivors. Inversely survivors shouldn't have to feel they can't do anything when a killer finds them and will feel they have a fair shot to at least run the killer to the best of their own abilities before getting caught, that's the balance this game needs. Where a map has the right balance of tools to where a killer can effectively monitor and chase survivors and the survivor can effectively run from the killer and the outcome of the chase becomes who is the better player.
---
Giving the killer artificially more time to fuck up or chase without any input from them or the survivors by making gens take longer isn't fair as it will be the same problem as games going by to fast in favor of survivors, the games that go by super slow puts it in favor of the killer.
---
Nothing people just don't want to be bothered with cleansing totems.
---
idk. if the killer doesn't kill anyone?
---
There will always be a perk that takes the mantle of 'Most Annoying to Face'. Are we going to play whack a mole with them until they're all dull? NOED still exists because it addresses a problem with the game(match speed), as BHVR sees it. It let's every killer get some benefit from the perk, even the ones that don't use it. My matches are slower on average because survivors have to consider countering it even though I don't have it. You can agree or disagree that matches go too fast when survivors focus on generators, but I'm not sure it matters because BHVR explicitly agrees. 
---
Except nothing in your previous comment was actually anything worth me replying to again? Why don't you re-read your own message and try again?

PS4 player here, all DLC apart from Legion has been on sale two or three times in the last six months. Hell, the Spirit DLC went on special for Halloween even though it'd only been out a couple of weeks at that point.
---
Would be nice if it'd show up in the shrine, though.
---
Are you sure you don‚Äôt already have the achievement?
---
Then you didn‚Äôt comprehend it.
---
There will always be a perk that takes the mantle of 'Most Annoying to Face'. Are we going to play whack a mole with them until they're all dull? NOED still exists because it addresses a problem with the game(match speed), as BHVR sees it. It let's every killer get some benefit from the perk, even the ones that don't use it. My matches are slower on average because survivors have to consider countering it even though I don't have it. You can agree or disagree that matches go too fast when survivors focus on generators, but I'm not sure it matters, NOED is more of a game mechanic and less of a perk, but it isn't going anywhere. 
---
Honestly I got outplayed by this post
---
Extremely unfair WOW
---
New wraith add on looks great
---
This is funny because I said this many many times in the past. Bond was extremely fun to use during lunar event because you see all the Claudette‚Äôs hiding near the exit gate with their lantern. It‚Äôs so funny to watch them. They are so scared that they won‚Äôt even open the damn gate but wait for someone else to do it. I troll them and hide next to them or make bunch of noise.  Once i saw the damn Claudette go for my lantern instead of unhooking me. 
---
I‚Äôve done it three times already, I‚Äôm about to just stop playing this game at this point.
---
Either you are just so good with flashlights that you understand the timing and only use them when you know the killer can't face a wall, or you're at a low enough rank at which killers don't know how to properly avoid flashlights (not a jab at your skill).
---
Who was the killer?
---
Why would arguably the worst exhaustion perk receive a nerf?
---
But they heard your complaints, and just days ago explicitly told you that we're making up a false equivalency between the perks that they don't see. NOED didn't get any stronger by making Decisive Strike weaker. 
---
Happens to me with windows/vaults more than pallets. If I had a dollar for every time I got hit when I was clearly on the other side than the killer, I'd... well, I'd have enough to buy the next few DLC's and probably some hats.
---
Of course I don‚Äôt have it, I should because after three times escaping with the set up. But I don‚Äôt.
---
&gt;A good killer will always get at least 2/3 kills unless against a very well coordinated team or SWF but a good survivor must rely on their teammates who might not be as good.
---
Well, that's one of my points. Bring what we know as "a team of 4 randoms" that have very limited ways of coordinating their actions closer to what we know as "a coordinated team" by providing ways of sharing information.
---
And right now killer needs 2-3 or sometimes even more kills to rank up. Survivors on the other hand don't need an escape to rank up. 2 gens done, 2 other guys unhooked and you're good. If, being a good survivor you are, you got some good chase time, it will make things even better.
---
Yes, NOED does change endgame from "haha, let's teabag this noob" to either "OH SHIT, RUUUUN" or "HE GOT ONE OF US, WHERE'S THAT DAMN TOTEM!?". Which one is a propper endgame? I believe it is anything but the first one.
---
Let's assume every killer runs NOED (just like my SWF does). Then you must cleanse all the totems if you want to avoid that risky endgame, right? So you go for totems and for gens, and now it looks like you got yourself that second objective everyone is talking about.
---
Btw devs mentioned that they are working on endgame changes. That's where NOED becomes active. If endgame itself changes, then the perk might as well be OK. Think about it.
---
And for the love of Entity, stop downvoting me. If my opinion is different and I have arguments to support it, it is the best contribution to your post you can imagine. 
---
Classic Claudette
---
I feel like this is alot of game communities now a days divided. I love the game too
---
That's super handy. I've had games freeze up on me a few times, to the point where I can't alt-tab, and that might be a good get-out.
---
This got me thinking how, if at all, a 2d game similar to DbD would work.
---
My theory is that we are getting it on this Tuesday, since they usually do PTBs on the Tuesday in the last week of the month prior to the month the DLC itself comes out, but seeing as how we haven't gotten a teaser yet, I'm a little worried that might not be the case.
---
I‚Äôm glad we were able to have a discussion. Regardless of what changes happen I hope you have an amazing time on the game! Thanks for this!
---
I want to rush my opponent out of the match, but I don't want there to ever be downsides or consequences. 
---
I can see Claudette
---
Wording makes out a lot when talking to someone you know. There's a certain difference between "I disagree with you" or "I don't think so" or whatsoever and "I've never read a comment more wrong". It's simply a matter of common respect everyone should have to each other by default.
---
But that's something life itself will teach anyway.
---
I unironically think NOED is fine, AMA 
---
Beautiful

Sure, your opinion buddy. MergaREB could get a slice of your politeness.

What does AMA mean tho? Lol

This reminds me of a story my dad told me about time he caught the ferry to Shelbyville. He needed a new heel for his shoe. So he decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So he tied an onion to his belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. "Gimme five bees for a quarter," you'd say. Now where were we... oh yeah. The important thing was that he had an onion on his belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have any white onions, because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones. 
---
Yeah, someone deserves what‚Äôs coming to them
---
Hiding her terror radius takes 4 seconds though and you can't walk around the entire map crouching. It's too slow.
---
Ewww self care and decisive 
---
If you give survivors a secondary objective that's mandatory, killers will stomp you every match because they're all going to drag on for much longer. If you untie the objective to escaping and just make it a reward, you get what happens during the Lunar/Blight event, where survivors farm more often and play less altruisticly, making matches harder to win. There's no good way to do it. 
---
Imo that logic applied word for word to DS, so I would have agreed before then but we're entering a new age üòÇ
---
Yes, solo survivor is weak. And there are two ways to fix that. 
---
You either rebalanxe the game with assumption that all survivors are solo, which will make SWF teams powerful beyond anything you can imagine. 
---
Or you bring solo survivors closer to SWF levels of coordination, which will (and oh my God am I gonna drop a surprise on ya) not require blanket nerfs to either side, but will instead demand new interactions to be introduced. And it will allow to balance game for both SWF and solos. But yes, it will require killer buffs in order to match a coordinated team. 
---
If it is not obvious for you which way is better, it is your problem. I believe that devs know their answer. 
---
Is this suppose to prove something? 
---
They at least profit by getting chase points, which would be more then they already had lmao
---
Ok.
---
Ask me anything 
---
With old DS you could only tell when 1 survivor might have it, and most cases all 4 survivors had it.
---
You don't need to be able to tell if the killer has NOED, survivors should be doing totems anyway.
---
I have a serious question. What is bbq? I‚Äôm only a lvl 10 jake player, rank 19. Needless to say, I‚Äôm fairly new and don‚Äôt know any terms 
---
Either not a high rank killer or you're lying if you can't wrap your head around why killers hate the perk. 
---
I've never had a problem with Haddonfield. And to get from point A to point B, to around the sides of the map or through the street.
---
Also known as hillbilly french.
---
DAMN
---
Cause he‚Äôs gotta know
---
Aye
---
I see how you feel but, are you complaining of gens being done? Some salt here
---
Priorities
---
That auto aim is very slight and used to compensate for killers having such a massive FOV
---
I dunno, people used to run it all the time back when you could recover exhaustion while sprinting. 
---
they should change the location of the great skill check for every new one that appears 
---
This is something me and my buds bring up all the time. How about if you're a SWF of 3, you have to finish 6 gens and 7 for a full SWF. Maybe increase the number of times a survivor can be hooked by one for a full SWF game.
---
They can't make it a different mode because it would hurt queue times but an automatic game adjustment if they are a larger SWF. 
---
I mean, it depends on the user. Streamers who  I watch use it, and you can definitely see why. It‚Äôs the best when it is in the right hands.
---
Someone used a black marker to scribble out the surviors names and icons
---
Speed hack? That must be a nightmare how fast do they go!
---
Don't need to do it if the survivors don't get to end game...
---
Or because I don't run NOED.
---
I guess the survivors could wiggle out but it‚Äôd have to be really situational. It gives the survivors more of a downside to be honest. Especially if the killer has thanatophobia 
---
Note to self: Don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúbug‚Äù in title ahah 
---
to yall saying how i didnt get any point as the killer, im buda, the killer dc'd after getting looped
---
Does the adept achievement only work when there are four survivors in a match? I‚Äôve gotten most adept achievements but I can not remember if there were three other survivors. I wouldn‚Äôt think the achievement would limit you to having everyone survive, or if there were less than four survivors. That limit is only placed on the killer.
---
H M M
---
Dead Hard is one of the only mechanics in the game that can be countered just by assuming they have it. You don't even have to waste time guessing, just hold back on lunging and wait for them to proc it. 99% of survivors will activate it when you're in lunge range, virtually nobody waits to see the actual attack animation. 
---
Because now you can just leave postgame screen without seeing the toxicity, with voice comms you‚Äôll be forced to either play with these people all game or have a HUGE disadvantage (if they‚Äôll balance the game around comms). 
---
Idk why are you keep bringing swf and discord into this, playing with friends and playing with strangers are two entirely different things. 
---
I've been waiting for finger guns for over two damn years, your bunny feng can wait.
---
The point still stand tho. Even if he DC I dought that he did it immediately, therefore the killer should have had the time to make a couple of points.  
---
I know. I predicted this one hard, huh.
---
It wouldn't lol it would be a massively unbalanced mess no matter what they do. The killers, perks and items are not balanced around that kind of gameplay.
---
I don't get it
---
Couple Franklin's with Mad Grit and you can give them a real bad time.
---
Got it on my first try. 
---
No Mither &gt; The Legion
---
No. The way dead hard is usually used is to extend loops, that gives you much more time than 3 seconds. 
---
This is great you should post in on their fb page xD 
---
I hate hex: ruin just because I can never actually find the totem for my life. 
---
Fine?
---
The killer dc'd so the killer lost all of his points. Op isn't the killer.
---
&gt;DBD players already complain about toxic teammates in post-game lobby. 
---
Exactly so adding voice chat would make this annoyance even worse. 
---
I personally don't mind the toxicity much but I like the atmosphere in this game and don't want a bunch of 12 year olds screaming around every game while running from the killer. 
---
In my opinion this was obnoxious in F13 and would be obnoxious in DBD.
---
It's your internet, dummy.
---
It was horrible. This chick was going like 250% the normal speed  and every time I I came close to hitting her it‚Äôs like she‚Äôd dead hard and teleport and extra 10 feet. It was fucking crazy 
---
Sorry I edited this in late in my last comment:
---
&gt;This would be too much of a change to add to already existing game, where most survivors are trying to just relax and chill.
---
Just have an option to disable voice comms and it show your teammates an icon near your name that you've disabled it. Easy.
---
&gt;Idk why are you keep bringing swf and discord into this, playing with friends and playing with strangers are two entirely different things. 
---
I queue regularly with strangers via SWF using Discord servers. There are tons of Discord servers where you can queue with strangers. Makes no difference to me. We are all players and love the game.
---
BBQ and Chili. It‚Äôs arguably the strongest killer perk in the game. It‚Äôs Leatherface and basically what it does is it lets the killer see where the other survivors are if they are outside the terror radius (heartbeats), after hooking a survivor. It also gives you stackable extra blood points, so it‚Äôs really good for farming. Once you get Leatherface to level 40 you can teach it to all the killers, and every killer will have access to it.
---
Adrenaline progged while on the killers shoulder
---
That was because it helped more easily prolong chases. A timer reduction for Deliverance's Broken doesn't really do all that much. If you got yourself off the hook, chances are you waited until the Killer wasn't nearby, and thus are going to stealth around, waiting for your chance to heal or find an ally and have them heal you. An extra few seconds on that isn't much.
---
(Golden mean fallacy, arguing that the toxicity is 50/50, 100% equal between both sides) 
---
Just do gens then, and work on your skill check timing.
---
But I am totally the asshole who runs Lullaby with it and plays The Game offering. 
---
[examples includes in fat guy playing dbd ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kBAvQUVHMxs) 
---
I kinda have every perk I want so i usually just use  shards to but perks I already have to get points
---
The problem is the enormous difference in skill between new and experienced survivors. A new survivor will be bad at the game and will probably lose to even the worst killers because they will fail the Gen skill checks, they won't know how to deal with tokens, everyone will unhook right in front of killers and so on. By slowing the game down more new survivors will win even less often and will be even more frustrated. The game isn't really beginner friendly as it is due to how grind heavy getting new perks and unlocking new characters is. If the devs slow gen progression anymore there will be less new players/ new players that remain active and thus the game will eventually die.
---
At least that's why I think the thought process of the devs might be.
---
I think getting more perks that force survivors to cleanse (dull) totems would be a good start or slowing Gen progress only for higher ranks maybe. But then I would imagine that a lot of high level survivors are going to derank. Potentially they could add actual rewards for reaching, staying and winning in rank one in order to prevent this but I ain't no game developer, so I don't know how well that would work out. 
---
It's literally an exploit and it makes chases unwinnable. There's no point in playing those matches
---
Worse spawn is the bathroom on The Game. Drop down the hole and bam!
---
By like a quarter of a second tho.
---
&gt;Exactly so adding voice chat would make this annoyance even worse. 
---
Just have an option to disable voice comms and it show your teammates an icon near your name that you've disabled it. Easy. Or a mute button for specific muting.
---
I thought (until now) that they actually made it so you literally can't drop below rank 15 once you've surpassed it, so I was obviously confused.
---
I saw Jeff in the store and did my research on him earlier at school the other day on the dbd wiki. I already decided I wanted to save up for him even though I haven‚Äôt played the game for very long. 
---
You are not the first to ask for this. 
---
The difference is, all the others asked me privately lol. 
---
üòÇ i‚Äôm not shy
---
Not a billy or leatherface.
---
That‚Äôs how good players use it but the majority use it trying to predict the killer. Which is why it‚Äôs easy to outplay 
---
&gt;I personally would still prefer the game without voicecoms since the introduction would lead to a need for the rebalance of certain perks and the game in general. 
---
I think we can agree that there are already plenty of perks that are useless and need rework. It shouldn't be too much work for the devs to tinker with them but updates are slow for the game.
---
&gt;I enjoy the game more when it is balanced/centered around you having to pay attention to the environment instead of just constantly being aware where the killer is due to voicecoms.
---
Fair enough assessment. I just think its impossible for the devs to balance SWF + comms gameplay vs Solo Queue survivor gameplay. They just strategically buff killers. I think this hurts solo queue survivors in the long run. Taking that to an extreme, it could eventually force solo queue survivors to have to find SWFs just to win games.
---
Wait.. a nurse player crying because you made things very minorly difficult?
---
I don‚Äôt believe you.

---
**Online disinhibition effect**
---
Online disinhibition is the lack of restraint one feels when communicating online in comparison to communicating in-person. Possible influencing factors toward online disinhibition include anonymity, invisibility, asynchronous communication, empathy deficit, in addition to individual factors like personality and culture background. The manifestations of such effect could be in both positive and negative directions. Thus online disinhibition could be classified as benign disinhibition or toxic disinhibition.

I don't mind if the game is not 100% balanced and am not a fan of pushing every game into the competitive/esports genre.
---
Imo they should simply give the killet a small buff and/or BP bonus depending on how many SWF he fights.
---
15 minutes for a match? Are the survivors birdwatching instead of doing litteraly anything usefull?
---
I have no right to say anything, as I'm such a new player, but these debates that survivors are weak and Killers are OP just seem so fucking \*stale\*. I play as both, and I win and lose as both. Sure, my rank is rather low, but I have never felt that I was advantaged or disadvantaged. If NOED got nerfed, there'd be an exact same thread like this one complaining that Killers are weak and survivors are OP. Not saying you'd make it, op, but Im hoping you know what Im saying.

Ruin is more of a mental affect than an actual game mechanic. Hitting greats isn't that hard, and even if you don't hit any, you will only be slowed by like 20 seconds max.

---
Crouching is slow. use monitor to get pretty close to a gen, but not close enough for them to hear heartbeat, then crouch for complete stealth. You spend less time crouching around thus letting you move around the map faster.
---
But if the killer has to rely on survivors to make the mistake doesnt that make them... underpowered?

---
I deadass just woke up so sorry for rambling on, the bottom is a kinda half ass tl;dr
---
The problem I have with it is that yeah, absolutely, gens ARE too fast when it's a competent team. If you got a 4 man SWF and don't waste your time with more then 1 person going for a save or you got no one going for the save if the killer is camping, yeah the gens will be finished way too quickly pretty often.
---
The problem there is that we're looking at the optimal try hard gameplay of the survivor side and saying that's a problem that needs to be nerfed, meanwhile you got new/bad survivors OR just people who play for fun and don't care to be super efficient to win all the time and when facing people like that it really isn't a problem since multiple people go for saves, they'll waste time with someone being camped, etc. It's also worth noting that it gets even WORSE when no one is a SWF group and you just don't know if anyone is going for a save or anything.
---
Basically complaining about gen rushing is more of an issue of complaining about the most optimal gameplay for survivors and how it can be and often is too strong. My issue comes in when if you look at it on the other end of the spectrum flipping it to the killer's side, all of a sudden it is a problem to judge balance based off the most optimal gameplay for killers. If you say that the Nurse is too strong when played optimally by a good player you'll often get responses with things such as, "But the Nurse is a high skill cap killer, she should be able to get 4k games nearly guaranteed if played well! Besides, if she got nerfed then the bad players who go for Nurse that ALREADY struggle will struggle even more!"
---
tl;dr kinda? The point I'm trying to make here is that yes, gen rushing can absolutely be done too quickly I don't think you can really deny that. However it's mainly an issue with survivors playing optimally with high skill level, SWF, etc. That means to nerf gen rushing in some way because it's an issue then, you'll likely impact the other end of the skill spectrum with bad survivors playing for fun and make it even harder for them when they often already struggle to win. However if you go to the killer side and argue the same thing with top tier killers, you'll often get shit on and using Nurse for the example it's often things like, "Nurse is a high skill cap killer she's hard to play and deserves to be able to 4k consistently and quickly when played really well. If you nerf her because of good players then the bad Nurse players will have an even harder time then they already do!" Basically arguing the exact opposite of what they'd be willing to argue for the survivor side.
---
Its level 35, and it's not the strongest that would probably go to haunted grounds. Cause everyone is to the point where they see lit totem-&gt;cleanse and that can be bad. Very bad
---
If a killer is excellent and dangerous regardless of if competent survivors make mistakes they'll be too powerful for lower ranks and less skilled players.
---
U should have gotten it after u were unhooked i think
---
What does skill have to do with enjoying matches with voice comm less? 
---
My initial reaction to your post yesterday was......."I gotta let the DBD fam know about this." We all agreed, this is a badass fucking tattoo. So well made, custom, the pose, everything about this is sick!
---
Clown's self-slow is stupid IMO, but Legion and Spirit are fair points.
---
I think the same. Especially since killer got 25k and no kills 
---
Assuming of course they take the time to do totems for noed. Majority just ignore the totems and the cry about it later when they get smacked. My survivor squad does totems regularly and the games much more enjoyable. Other survivors however seem to think this is completely crazy talk and expect the killer to not run noed out of some wierd taboo
---
Legion is arguably the worst killers, while Jeff is arguably one of the best in terms of perks, all of his are amazing to downright mean, so he's a good pick.
---
Rank doesn't matter
---
My fav thing to do with in game chat is when a killer absolutely destroys us I say "gg ez" usually gives them a bit of a laugh
---
I never do totems as a survivor, I always just take my chances and rush through gens, hopefully he goes after some one else. Then again when I'm downed from NOED, I don't complain because I know that my own decisions led me to that. 
---
What song is this? I've heard it before but I've never known the title. I pretty much know it because a few years ago in 6-8 grade, all the girls were constantly singing it.

The shrine of secret gets 4 teachable perks every week. The perks that come up there can be the teachable for ANY character, meaning you can get a perk in there for a killer/survivor that you have not purchased the DLC for. So if you only want 1 perk from someone, for example bbq from leatherface, but dont want to purchase the DLC you can wait for it in the shrine. However these 4 perks only get changed 1 time a week so and there are A LOT of teachable perks so it could take a very long time to see the perk you want. **IF** the shrine were to never repeat itself until it cycled through every perk it would take 22 weeks to get through every teachable currently in the game.
---
Nice
---
I think it is balanced. Maybe even a little weak. My squad does totems so it never actually does anything. 
---
You sir are a treasure 
---
Brand New Part. Pink addon on toolbox.
---
Flashlight saves are possible when the killer can move their camera while walking around. 
---
If everyone is only capable of saving during the pickup animation maybe they should get better at using flashlights

Because instead of brainlessly stomping solo survivors not working together god forbid you actually have to try to get a kill. Dont try to pretend like it isnt the reason why. Its blatantly obvious and its ok, just admit it at least.

Imagine actually believing that
---
The crow ain't wrong.  Immersed teamates have killed more survivors than Insidious Leatherface, 5 blink Nurse, NOED and Moris put together.  I'm legit more triggered by useless teamates than camping killers at this point.
---
Nah 
---
When the progress is that far you just have to commit 
---
I dont see DS or a flashlight.
---
I mean, I know I'm being sarcastic and all, but with 1k hours in this game you can easily get back to red ranks after the rank reset in three days or less, if you play like you normally would. (Although I admit that that might be on me and how much "normal" playing actually represents for me.)
---
Unless you get unlucky with skill checks, then it's more efficient to just try for the hex skill checks. Gen tapping is slow, and at least you have a chance of hitting it.
---
I see your point on useless teammates, but I just don‚Äôt see how being careful is equivalent to being immersed. In fact, I did 3/5 gens that were supposed to be done, and saved and healed my teammates multiple times. I can‚Äôt see how I was being immersive at all
---
They're for sure gonna nerf Adrenaline next (read: they shouldn't). I'd imagine that adrenaline will be wasted if you are hooked/dying when gates are powered, it won't wake you up, and it won't ignore exhaustion. 
---
Confirmed 100% that they are healing not mending.  And to be fair NOED is a mindless perk used to boost any killer regardless of how strong or weak their power is.  It's an insta down..

It's not a free 4th kill because they busted their ass to get the first 3 that makes the 4th even possible. The closest thing a Killer has to the hatch is NOED, and look how much Survivors whine about that.
---
They haven't even acknowledged Legion as a problem. I can't see it happening ever.
---
That's like saying I shouldn't *have* to bring Franklin's or Lightborn if I want to avoid flashlights. You gotta stop acting entitled dude, these counter perks exist for a reason, your can't be prepared for every situation and opponent loadout every single time. 
---
Some of the maps are also bugged. Ruin will *always* spawn in a specific spot, instead of being random.
---
Yeah careful and immersed are very different.  You did 3 gens that alone disqualifies you.  I'm talking IMMERSED.  Only crawl and hide.  Will not ever touch a gen if they even think they hear the slightest heartbeat.  Will not repair gens even when you're chasing killer across map, you die, they escape through a hatch and you still outscore them 2-1.  Those teamates flat out ruin the game.
---
duud that's illegal
---
I have this strange feeling that this post is on the 8th level of meta and is actually pretending to be a brainless Ochido fanboy while really hating the guy as much as everyone else.
---
Baby camps spotted in the wilds of reddit?
---
You think that because you're in a swf lol.  Try playing primarily solo queue.  You'll be the only one taking out dulls I promise that shit.
---
Yeah thats why i said i sometimes you use i never actually use NOED to help with thier power also thanks for lettling me know about nurse's calling guys i thought i was picking up on people mending but i guess not still it helps
---
I'm kind of glad I don't base my wins as Killer off of kill count. I just care about BP. 20k and up, with a 4 stack BBQ  on top = good game. Don't care even if no one died along the way. It's a lot less stressful.
---
It‚Äôs not been made as an official statement but one of the devs on their own stream (mcclean?) I don‚Äôt remember, said that the team knows that Legions gameplay aspects aren‚Äôt well received and they are actively brainstorming how they can make him better. 
---
Everyone: *Gets to red ranks without abusing overpowered perks or being needlessly toxic.*
---
Ochido fans: LIIIIIEEEEEEEES! THE FILTHY EARTH BOY LIIIIIIEEEEESSSSS!
---
Every "discussion" flair is just some overly-padded think piece on camping or tunneling or DS vs NOED, they're almost never worth your time entering. 
---
To answer your last question, type it out like this
---
\[words](URL)
---
You know I have a suspicion those first two paragraphs were a bad idea, not gonna lie 
---
Yeah... I take a look at some of those discussion posts, but they usually are just like you described... 
---
yeah I agree. I try to do as much as I can to help my team survive, even if it means I, myself, will not end up escaping. I just can‚Äôt see why immersive players consider the way they play fun. I feel like it‚Äôd be quite boring to just not do anything but hide the whole game. unfortunately, being careful and being immersive are often mixed up and I have a lot of people yell at me because I didn‚Äôt get to them on the hook as fast as they wanted me to, even though I didn‚Äôt want them to get smacked right off of hook
---
I used your Scissors on your Valentino Fabric
---
&gt;Bugs
---
&gt;Toxicity
---
&gt;Poor balance
---
&gt;Lazy devs
---
I could go on.
---
Vigil became a shit perk the moment they nerfed exhaustion recovery in chase.  It really does next to nothing for you at this point.  
---
Hey everyone, here's the video on Mike. As always, please give me any constructive criticisms you may have, either here on reddit or in the youtube comments.
---
I tried to test what I could where I could, since a lot of stuff about Mike isn't really documented anywhere that I could find (mostly the stuff relating to Stalking and how it functions) but sadly there were some things I couldn't test properly, such as how slow you go when actually Stalking a Survivor. 
---
As I said in the video, I did try to get in touch with some Fog Whispers (the ones that did actually respond were very nice about it) to see if they could help me with getting through to BHVR, but nothing really came of that sadly. I'll keep trying to get in touch with them to see if I can get the real numbers for everything, but until that point its all relying on datamining and testing, which leaves room for error. If I feel like there's too much of a room for error (like in the case of your MS while Stalking) I won't even really give a number since I don't want to spread false information.
---
How? It's not an easy hit if the survivor can move well.
---
It still takes skill, and you sound ignorant. 
---
Missed the part where Decisive Strike drives off a cliff and explodes.
---
**I Get This Design Shirt Here. Anybody want can try this** 
---
‚Äú Dude stop shining that flashlight in my face shine it where I‚Äôm working‚Äù
---
*laughs in Spine Chill*
---
Repost
---
I see nothing out of the ordinary here.
---
I get a lot of games against mediocre survivors, but every time someone wants to talk shit, it makes me want to only play nurse, and slug for the 4k before a gen is touched. And close the lobby immediately when the score screen comes up.
---
Rename myself to "EZ" 
---
Hell yeah. Ever played sleepless Freddy. Eventually they start jumping in lockers just to get hooks lol
---
Buy the pig. You‚Äôll thank me later.
---
Don‚Äôt hold your breath. Things don‚Äôt happen quick in DBD.
---
She‚Äôll have wait till next check lol 
---
"risk not being able to find every totem in a decent amount of time on a hard to locate map to avoid a perk the killer might not even have" Stuff like this is exactly the name of the game. 
---
Killers would have a hard time just trying to find Gen's, terror radius with no scratch marks would make Gen rushing super easy 
---
well survivor progress was still made if the hatch is spawned. 2 gens minimum still have to be done for the hatch to come into play, if the killer gets down to the last survivor before that's done, then yea that 4th kill is deserved(in most matches). It's usually not even going to be 2 gens, if there's say 4 gens done, I would say that single survivor still deserves at least some chance against the killer.
---
Basically the 4th kill still shouldn't be free all the time to the point of where all the survivor can do is just walk up to the killer and go "hey come hook me!"
---
If you farm a game, everyone gets points.
---
Hitboxes are one of the many issues killing this game.
---
"too" 
---
It‚Äôs not too hard to fuck bees, you fuck it every day
---
Rank 8ish is the sweet spot. At least for killers. 
---
Is that with overcharge?
---
Only reason it's run is to be used with the tombstone, and this wouldn't work for that.
---
I swear the show went downhill once they introduced that chubby dude. Not Jay, but the other one. Dude is so annoying.
---
I always commit to finishing the gen whenever it‚Äôs over 90 or 95% 
---
First person with urban immersion in the cornfields.
---
Let's the rest finish the gens.
---
When you get close and they start spinning you tap R2 and you'll hit them. Lunging should be a risk countered by juking and have a longer cooldown than regular hits.
---
Yes. It makes me a big shot.
---
Your *squad*. People who play solo can't even rely on their teammates to do gens, stopping to try to break NOED means you aren't getting to NOED 9 times out of 10.
---
Pfft remind me again who thought such a thing?
---
More realistically it's just been delayed.
---
On topic though i'd be very disappointed. That's not to say Freddy and Legion shouldn't receive changes I just don't think it should replace a Chapter.
---
This is exactly what green ranks play like.
---
Did you fart
---
We all can agree that rank doesnt equal your skill and that the rank system is broken.
---
But this screenshot just proves how unhealthy for the overall gameplay it is.
---
It simply hurts the playerbase...
---
I've never seen tposing on dbd thank you so much for bringing this to out attention.
---
Dwight is like ‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Äù
---
lol I was moving my hand idk why it sounded like a fart
---
Implying Dying Light was ever the better choice.
---
Probably because of the large black thing that pops up and goes BAM!
---
Sometimes I wish we had a button to end it early. When someone gets hooked it blocks a whole section of the screen so you don't know if anything is coming your way right after.
---
Oof..
---
I would give input, but I don't play any of the 3 killers. Good luck
---
If you think that then you're literally braindead lmao. This game is nowhere near balanced. 
---
Anything to make the Perk less useless.
---
Well he is only rank 19 so....
---
He didn‚Äôt seem laggy the whole game though, had a good connection.
---
Ruin, no question.
---
Yeah SWF is good fun but solo is just ehh. :(
---
Solo is  pretty fun when you manage to claw your way out of the trash pile and hit at least green ranks. 10-12ish.Then people start actually playing the game and it's fun. Otherwise it's just you doing gens and 3 other people crouching in the corners of the map. Then you depip because no one rescued you and there's only 1-2 gens done. The solo fight to claw your way out of braindead ranks is what makes rank reset miserable for me. Hey I just spent a week, playing a couple of hours a night, escaping maybe once or twice in the 20 or so games I play to get into ranks with decent people and now I've just been shoved back down for no apparent reason.
---
This is why my play time dropped to almost nothing, it feels like a slog just to play with other people who also want to play the game. I very rarely see even 4 gens get done.
---
2 hours in, they finally did the last gen. Downed them with NOED as they ran for the hatch.
---
Called me a try hard and said they blocked me. 
---
2 hours in and they didn't cleanse all the totems... 
---
Make it happen Beehavior
---
Flashlights aren't a big deal if you know how to deal with them. I'd take flashlights over toolboxes any day. 
---
Hell yeah, I'll upvote for Hot Fuzz!
---
Support is always welcome tho 
---
The Destruction points are a very satisfying detail.
---
Not really tho. 
---
Shit now I just got a new bloodweb and it has bbq or ruin. What now?
---
&gt;Q: How much have you guys spent on cosmetics?
---
85.000 Iridescent Shards or 0,00$. 
---
you trying to flip it back onto me isnt working, nice try though. 
---
What about Nurse or Billy with gen slowing perks? I think that kinda even things out. 
---
Not really. Just like 2 hours, which is enough for some 8 games. A little more on the weekends. I've had the game for a long time, 'tho, and played it more when I first got it. That's how I am currently at 1.5k hours.
---
I don‚Äôt wanna know, to much like one outfit a month. 
---
PS4 application won‚Äôt start
---
So I bought the game but every time I try to start it my PS4 immediately overheats and shuts off. Does anyone know why this is happening and how I can fix it? All my other games work fine and my friends seem to run this game fine on PS4. 
---
Nerfing the survivor version of a lagswitch isn't balancing toward SWF, it's just a sensible decision that everyone knows they've been trying to make for months now, if not more. 
---
I dunno, whatever it is. It needs to be something interesting for the Pig
---
Don't get me started on Yamaoka Estate. Ruin spawns at the killer shack 99% of the time.
---
Why should we label content creators opinions as truth? 
---
Freddy isn‚Äôt too bad... legion can suck a fat one though, doctor too. 
---
Nice work by the way. :)
---
3 minutes is a long time in this game. 
---
I honestly think quick and quiet is a wate *mid-chase*, since you'll probally just fast vault a window before the killer can even hit you. I'd preffer to use lightweight (makes the killer lose you faster in chases.)
---
fun fact: the clown who was hit by d strike in this video facecamped me afterwards 
---
This was too good. The clowns face in the 2nd to last panel was great. 
---
You sound exactly like a killer who camps and cried about DS until they changed it. 
---
Survivor version of a lagswitch?? I have no idea what you're talking about. Isn't balancing towards SWF?? Honestly I'm confused. 
---
depends on my mood but sometimes Freddy really pisses me off lol, but agreed the legion can suck my left titty
---
I feel you man sounds frustrating but it's temporary.  If you stick with it you'll have all the perks you need to in no time.
---
The killer had no heartbeat and chase music never started even during chase? As far as I know that‚Äôs not normal. 
---
Probably for a ritual to hit with hatchets. 
---
8 survivors, 2 killers? Killers compete against the other killer while survivors work together
---
Well he‚Äôs faster then what I‚Äôm used to with nurse 
---
Similarly, as killer, you lean towards your monitor to lunge further.
---
No, sorry, I don't fit your narrative. In reality, I only enjoy playing survivor. The killer does not interest me. 
---
I get it, you can't criticism and Civil conversation is difficult. 
---
That‚Äôs hilarious
---
Perks with auras don't work, except in the case of giving extra BP such as BBQ. 
---
Killer has no TR or stain, but all voices, footsteps, and other player created audio is enhanced.
---
No ambient background noises.
---
Killer's add-ons are all disabled. To compensate, all status effects inflicted by perks are doubled in time, and their effects are 1.5x stronger.
---
Survivors can't bring in items, and chests are disabled.
---
No totems. To compensate for no Ruin or NOED, gen repair speeds are reduced by 5% and Great Skill checks are not possible.
---
Visual notifications are disabled, but they still make noise in the direction they occurred.
---
Bleeding frequency is increased by 75%, but scratch marks disappear faster. Bloodhound's fresh blood effect is now doubled in duration.
---
I got about 10 followers off of it :D
---
Decisive Strike, where you essentially reverse the results of what just happened. 
---
Literally unplayable
---
That gen warding power is actually really dope.
---
Yeah matchmaking seemed broken today, played a few games as rank 10 killer and got against rank 3-5 survivors twice. And then rank 8 survivor game with others being 1-4
---
*stabbed
---
$5. I bought pants and shoes for the Wraith
---
"I said for the WEED, grandma!"
---
You cannot compare that to what a big problem lag switching is. Looking at it that way you could say that NOED also reversed the results of what just happened. You got thrashed and all the gens were completed whoops better revoke all that and get my free kills!! 
---
There‚Äôs rank 1 killers who play like that lmao
---
Yes but then I have to play an ugly swamp map 
---
He had 110 ping on MLGA. That is acceptable in any game. This is just a result of ping spiking which can be fixed with better code on dedicated servers rather than the host machine.
---
Or a killer suggestion thats been done to death
---
I love your art style! The Doctor is my favorite.
---
That crow is my spirit animal now
---
*whispers quietly*
---
^(teabagging)
---
We do not hand them decisions because they are content creators. We do this because they are killer and survivor players whos skill we do not question. 
---
Your idea is one sided very much favoring an insanely overpowered buff. And judging by your response just now, it‚Äôs pretty obvious why your original post didn‚Äôt have much thought in the first place.
---
I‚Äôm 99% sure you‚Äôre a Rank 20 baby killer who when the other side wants change to benefit them a little you get angry due to you it not being what you want 
---
thank you! &lt;3
---
Oh god no.
---
That's actually really helpful because i've been mainly playing the chainsaw dude
---
Judging by my post? I‚Äôm not the toxic asshole calling someone garbage because of an idea they had. I Guarantee I‚Äôm 10x better at this game then you think you are  
---
Get this... what if there was a killer that could hide in *lockers*? 
---
Didn't the devs go on record saying that they would never make a non-human killer?
---
Lmao one of my friends just got the game so I‚Äôve been playing no perks/items and goofing off to keep it fair. One game we had a super sweaty deranked nurse so I tbagged him on some tires in front of my friend and now every time I get chased he tells me to ‚Äútbag or no balls‚Äù at every window. Safe to say I don‚Äôt escape much anymore. 
---
Quick question: What brainlet thinks we *don't* need dedicated servers.
---
Hey guys wouldn't a werewolf be a cool killer idea.
---
Not good enough.
---
There should be compensation for the hooked person for not being able to participate in the game for lengthy period of time. 
---
I'll practice my skill checks when it's not on hexruin gens, til then gentapping!
---
Wait does pebble give survivor notifications now?
---
Probably because any opinion you have on here is wrong.
---
I've heard from numerous people before that they for some reason rather want another chapter than dedicated servers. Beats me as to why. I've been playing Apex Legends with people from all over the world. Americans, Australians, British etc. and had no issue. I really hope that'll be the same result for Dead by Daylight.
---
Let's hope BHVR can actually do something right.
---
You do know that it works if you get unhooked from struggle, right? Or are you choosing to be blind? If you get found after being given multiple minutes to hide and heal, that's your fault.
---
Big facts
---
The whole thing I don't get with this is noed leaves a fucking sour taste in a survivors mouth, but you guys don't even seem to be open to change when it comes to that. Just " oh should have cleansed them totems bro" when that's pretty much impossible as a solo player.
---
Well as a new killer I have been told to frequently dodge if I see 4 players come at once, because that means they must all be playing together with mics. And after having dealt with a recent game vs 4 claudettes all with mics and flashlights, I see exactly why. In conjunction, playing vs 800 ping also isn't fun.
---
Unless they fixed the ranked system to where as a level 4 killer I don't have to play vs 4 level 40 survivors all with 4 tier 3 perks and with the ability to use mics, I'm still going to be dodging as a killer.
---
Evil brainwashed green ranger was my favorite. 
---
Haha so because unlike you I don‚Äôt spend my whole day on the DBD reddit and actually work and earn everything I have. That makes me unskilled and stupid? And people wonder why they call this community toxic fucking scumbag
---
Look out loorie stride it's makel meyers
---
That blade of grass at the side made me think Bill had a knife and I was very confused
---
Depends how you take it. 
---
I like to take *those* kinds of responses as a meaningful or thoughtful argument (most of the time) 
---
I do enioy those kinds of comments and posts. It's neat to express your ideas while learning others. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt answer what I said, if he ignores me for 60 seconds atleast I heal up and get back to doing generators and saves but now that my 60 Seconds is up I LOSE DS. 
---
You aren't losing a hook state and the killer camping your dying body gives the other survivors plenty of time to do gens. Would you rather be face camped ON hook where you can't move and can lose time through being farmed?
---
Doc is mildly annoying imo. Not Freddy or legion level.
---
There are two moments I want to share. They‚Äôre not recent, but they stick out to me a lot, and I always think about them whenever I‚Äôm the last one after most of my teammates DC.
---
The first one was when I was playing Nea for daily blood points and we ended with three survivors against a Myers. After one DCs and the other dies, the Myers actually let me finish my generator, take down his Ruin Hex, and we farmed for a bit. He let me go through the hatch afterwards. I found it sweet.
---
The second time was against the Pig. Again, three survivors, I‚Äôm playing Claudette, one DCs and one gets sacrificed. The Pig gets a trap on me and instead of running, they let me do two generators before the trap went off. Honestly, I could have let the Pig farm with me, but I realized that maybe most killers in that situation always let the survivor go so I let myself die to give them more points.
---
But i have Sprint Burst!
---
/s kind of
---
I‚Äôd rather baby killers stop being toxic scum bags and stooping to the level of the trolling survivors 
---
Reading what you wrote I can live with most of your provisions but that last bit is something I‚Äôve wanted in the game for forever now. Proximity chat sounds so good for a game like this
---
Solo Q isn‚Äôt something the game can be balanced around. We all have the ability to invite people at any time. Ignoring the built ability of telepathy is the players choice. Not up to the devs to make things easier cuz some folks choose not to use the tools given to them
---
Cool story man. 
---
How about ghostface, chucky or jason vorhees
---
"Do you want to play hide and seek?" 
---
Like ¬£300+ but a lot more on the game in general since I've spent a lot on buying DLCs for my friends and myself.
---
My sides üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Haha that's so funny, 
---
Watched a video posted here about Survivor tips. That was actually really helpful.
---
You're probably the same type of survivor that disconnects when I play Nurse.
---
djjxndjd I kinda just assumed from the tutorials that gens = active gate = escape 
---
Then they do a 180 and check the locker you're in
---
Been here for a bit but still learning the hooks. 
---
I was in your shoes once so I empathize. It sucks but until you get better, killer will be aggravating either way. Just think, sink or swim.
---
I think killers in that typical camping range should get some sort of effect that severely narrows FOV or puts a blindness film over the screen after a certain time. That and possibly even a slowing effect to movement speed if you're in the camping range for too long, like moving through mud.
---
They could easily keep it themed with "the entity" and truly discourage camping.
---
Glad you got the message - idk how some others missed it. ;/
---
Thank you.
---
It gets even bigger at tier 3.
---
So The Clown basically. But without the area of effect?
---
From a Survivor view, that is.
---
noed doesn't slow the game down at all, it's just a crutch perk that secures a kill on any poor survivor the killer decided to chase after gens were done. The game is done when NOED ticks over, and as soon as the down happens and the hook is made the doors are open and the game is over unless survivors get stupidly altruistic. This isn't some "unspoken/uncomfortable fact" lol..
---
Well one reason is because all the maps are designed for human like characters. You get a map and play a giant bug on it, survivors can see them over the obstacles.
---
Lol take your downvote and have a good day.
---
Details: Claudette managed to get on the rock that is usually on hills (the one that hides the totem). Dude was running No Mither + Unbreakable because he knew what he was doing. Couldn't get up there with the acceleration from the chainsaw, and I sure couldn't get there just walking. 
---
And during the 35 seconds what the hell are you doing? You should be either crawling away or reviving yourself so another survivor can do a drive by heal which by then WILL be full. But yeah if you insist on being a brain dead survivor shrugging your shoulders because now Decisive has ONLY gotten you an extra 3 minutes worth of life because the killer wont pick you up for all 3 hooks(which by the way, wow what a shitty perk, 3 minutes? Might as well run no mither).
---
5th Option - Just go at the first gen you find. Most killers I‚Äôve gone up against try to find the totem too so they know where to come back to keep an eye on it
---
They also said they‚Äôd never make a clown killer.
---
I do however think they‚Äôll keep their word with non-humanoid character models.
---
leatherface takes the cake on that one
---
Killer main big brain
---
What the hell's with guys putting an extra e in Myers?
---
It's not pronounced *Mayers*. It's pronounced *Myers*. As in the word *My*, then *Ers*. 
---
Come on.
---
6th Option: Do Generators as there is a chance the Killer will be paranoid with his Hexes but also it is rare to see a Survivor willing to burn through a Generator.
---
6th Option - Stop \*\*ruining\*\* a meme.
---
I‚Äôd say hillbilly, he looks like bleached jerky 
---
At least they got 2 kills
---
Well, this is a good reason to run the new DS. Will be a complete anti camping ability.
---
Second, it‚Äôs kind of a hard thing to punish. DBD has such arbitrary rules of what‚Äôs acceptable and what‚Äôs not. Sometimes camping or proximity camping is the most tactical move to do. It sucks for the survivor, but what should a killer do if he knows other survivors are in the area? Just leave to avoid being called a camper?
---
I‚Äôm not to close minded, killers bitch all the time about not being able to use their perks and now they keep adjusting the game to make it so they always can but that‚Äôs ok? Like wtf
---
You can get up there as killer but it‚Äôs way harder than it is for a survivor
---
You must be very very lucky then, but here in central Europe in prime night time, we have to wait minutes for a killer and one random so we can be four and play. 
---
When you get dodged like 4 times in a row, when its not even event or something, it can get very annoying very quick.
---
Me neither. I just happened to spawn 10 feet from it.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Then the 360 strat is gone and killers have a significantly easier time spotting survivors. That slight auto aim also servers as lag compensation. 
---
Yeah, i trie to get the kiler attention and then get away ez its working by the moment
---
I‚Äôd replace quick and quiet,maybe lightweight if you wanna be immersed
---
Personally I run the same thing but with plunderers instead of qaq
---
Takes dedication and some serious grinding. You‚Äôll get there tho and stomp people! I recommend leveling Hag and LF first to get their sweet, sweet teachables. But hillbilly is very nice too for enduring(love this perk).
---
tbf it's the last place I'd look as a Survivor
---
Nice idea, thanks!
---
So uh, nea is a killer joke... there I did it, u happy ?
---
High skill gameplay. And as a plus, they probably dont get the rank penalty for being within 8 meters of a hooked survivor i think i t was. Not that killers care about it anyway.
---
Oooh your onto something
---
Yeah that's what I thought, blue haired Feng xD
---
Keep posting these forever
---
"please michael stalk me again and again"
---
I am a person who using controller on pc.
---
Check pornhub
---
He probably salty cause of the DS changes
---
You do know some people play solo survivor, bless them. The other survivors do not know you are being camped. 
---
&gt;learn to 360¬∞ 
---
You say that like anyone can do it from day 1. I'd tell someone to learn how to loop the killer on t-walls, jungle gyms, killer shack, etc, effectively and efficiently before even mentioning how to 360.
---
I would have screamed XD! 
---
I do agree to an extent. I just have issue with the carte blanche nature of it. A Survivor can do jack shit all game and still escape. There have been plenty of games where the only escapee had the least points. If they're getting 7k for taking the hatch and *still* getting last in points something is seriously wrong. And 2 gens isn't that hard to accomplish, which is what makes the hatch seem like such a freebie.
---
TBH, I'd rather have a Left Behind baked into the game mechanics over the hatch mechanic.
---
If the killer doesn't mess around and have fun with it, then they are sad creatures.
---
Level up bubba to get bbq and franklin's demise. Bbq is basically double bloodpoints+tracking which is super helpful for map pressure. I don't know if you enjoy him but personally I find bubbas game play boring (unless you do bubbas basement that's fun as fuck) but other than his perks I'd leave Bubba. He's also a really crap killer meta-wise. In high ranks you'll struggle with him.
---
The legion is really controversial at the moment but he's not that great, unless you moonwalk or use Frank's mixtape.Discordance is good but his other perks are situational. He's fun to play however;unlike Bubba.
---
The clown is a very solid killer meta-wise. He's good against looping and is a good for herding. His map pressure is weak however. His perks are amazing. Coulrophobia is not the best so I wouldn't suggest it but bamboozle and pop goes the weasel are amazing. Bamboozle is great for chase heavy killers(pretty much all killers except nurse) and pop goes the weasel is very solid for generator regression.
---
Good luck and I hope your future games go well! 
---
Ah, I missed it entirely.
---
The reason isn't self explanatory. Why are they not there?
---
HEY! This is exactly mine! I made this in Paint!
---
You tried I guess? This doesn't even make any sense.
---
If he patrols you or downs you all those efforts are for nothing. Sure it wastes time but end game doesnt matter and depending on the situation it wont be much wasted time. (Lightly chasing after another surv) I'll say this perhaps its unlikely because they wont know you have DS. But its still plausible scenario from a toxic killer judging your cosmetics.
---
I wish, but no, they‚Äôve gotta be going at half walking speed or the killer‚Äôs going to appear from nowhere or some shit
---
&gt;Sweety 
---
Sweaty*
---
heard this 4 billion times, hope you die in a car crash
---
Oh god. That‚Äôs horrible. 
---
For real tho Ive been begging for The Thing to be in this game for years 
---
Don‚Äôt worry about being a savage killer. And take being a ‚Äúbaby killer‚Äù with pride. Everyone was once. It‚Äôs how you learn. Just take this time to have an excuse to make stupid choices and form good habits.
---
Yet youre still there
---
Apart from lag switchers the dedicated servers arent going to fix lag, hitboxes and other issues. Its not some super fix
---
i was here before this post reached the top
---
HahahahaüòÇ
---
Also, Hag is a pretty solid killer, and is extremely consistent in lower ranks because people don't know about the crouch thing to don't activate the traps.  
---
She is still consistent at higher ranks too.
---
How does DS reward bad players? Because he gives up a perk slot for the majority of the game meaning he is only operating at 75% for 90% of the match? Because he is hoping his opponent is dumb enough to actually let him get it off?
---
\&gt;little effort
---
You're lowballing it for the sake of your argument. To get all the totems, it would take somewhere like a minute of total wasted time, not including the search for the totems and disregarding the time you'll probably be searching for a totem that a random destroyed and you have no idea about. I get that most of the playerbase aren't very smart anymore, but a minute is enough time for most Killers to win a game.
---
\&gt;to make his end game perk completely useless and people still complain about it.
---
A little extra effort would be dribbling to a hook or slugging (which adds pressure and is almost always to the benefit of the Killer), but people still complain about DS, and the complaints are justified. Even if NOED was truly a minor effort, it doesn't change the fact that it's a crutch perk that bad Killers use because they just aren't very good.
---
\&gt;You don‚Äôt have to run swf to cleanse dull totems and it‚Äôs not the killers fault if teammates don‚Äôt work together
---
Go try to play solo and cleanse totems and see how many games you win. And I never said it was the Killer's fault or even that Killers should use it, but that doesn't make it any less of a imbalanced crutch perk for bad Killers.
---
There arent very many new players, the system matching you tries to take rank into account but eventually it puts you with who it can find
---
The pallet got the destruction points, not him.
---
I did haha
---
care to explain what that is?
---
Rely on me, I will. 
---
Four man games can easily end before the five minute mark, what are you on about?
---
Good thing as Hag is you don't really need addons. When I play her I only use brown addons that increase +10 meters to teleport thing and faster set speed. She is pretty consistent if you know how to play her. Just don't chase people with 10 traps in your pocket and then say she is worse than trapper.
---
And then I have a bad ass chick on my leg. Win-Win
---
putting yourself on a pedestal by saying "have a great night"? probably the most toxic thing ive seen in the last 4 billion years
---
But sometimes the illusion of 4 people coming at once doesnt mean they are SWF. Against flashlight, turn to the wall, or bring Franklins.
---
And I dont get your last paragraph at all.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll look into hex ruin since every guide I check pushes it 
---
So all the ugly killers and you left out the not ugly ones 
---
Xir?
---
This is art 
---
Puts them in a portable sleeping bag and just beats the shut out of them.
---
Let him. I mean, it's a Dwight so he's not exactly going to try to do it to anyone else.
---
they're all ugly besides daddy myers
---
you're obviously doing SOMETHING wrong. How long in those games does it take you to get your first down?
---
You are on reddit telling people to die in a car crash, so really you are bellow my pedastal in a pile of shit, go away toxic kid please.
---
Same. I'm on PC so its not that bad, but fuck playing solo. My rando teammates are more a killer than the Killer in the fog.
---
Freddy is not drawn because you don't sleep, duh.
---
Nea (players) really are the killer, honey. 
---
Sometimes
---
Hate keeping in a video game. Lol
---
Totem placements suck. 
---
Oh ok, good thinking. It happens to me so often that usually nothing gets done and when one survivor dies on first hook that really affects the game. Maybe I‚Äôll start using a tracking perk to see what everyone is up to. Thanks. 
---
I know right, strangest thing. The game has gotten super stale especially the last chapter or two, so the only time the game play changes is during events which I'll check out but otherwise, meh. 
---
If the survivors are any good at hiding they can complete 1-2 gens before I‚Äôve started a chase. I‚Äôm generally able to end chases quickly but DS is always there to save the day for that particular survivor. The by the time I‚Äôve properly downed them it‚Äôs 3 gens, then they finish 4th while someone else is unhooking. 5th is then completed and the hooked guy gets his adrenaline to heal him, then I pick the wrong gate and have to walk across the entire map and by that time they are already crouching at the open gate
---
You‚Äôre an idiot if you can‚Äôt DS skill checks, it‚Äôs like missing healing skill checks.
---
Did you also know that you can throw pallets down to stop the killer? Crazy right?
---
Boil over NEEDS a buff
---
I can‚Äôt hit great skill checks for the life of me. When I do it‚Äôs pure luck.
---
I‚Äôm boosted.
---
Well I'm new so I don't have franklins, so I can't do that. And also if I see 4 people all with similar names, or all as the same character, it's a safe bet that they are swf.
---
And the last paragraph is saying that I, a killer who has reached level 4 using bloodpoints, and no higher, resulting in me only having one perk on my character that is tier one. I have faced a group of 4 players all with 4 perks on their characters, and all of those perks are tier 3.
---
Discordance/whispers, Nurses, Ruin, and Surveillance... Combat straps and video tape. 
---
I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúthey are‚Äù fits anywhere in that sentence. 
---
Oh my god I thought you were a Claudette. I‚Äôm dead fucking serious.
---
By there, I meant the subreddit. Im just curious not being passive agressive but why ?
---
*cries in no console optimisation patches*
---
Yeah that makes sense. I‚Äôll start basing my rescues on the distance between me and them, if I‚Äôm too far I can only hope that someone who is closer to them will do it. I get a lot of games where all survivors will go for the rescue at once and we either only get one gen done or none at all because we all just go back and forth rescuing each other.
---
r/prequelmemes *wants to know your location*
---
I can't believe that's still a thing in the game. I mean, if you do it once, oookaaaay, but people abuse it
---
Yeap and not using freddys power at all. 
---
Okay but how are you "suffering from success"
---
Listening to music can help, but if you‚Äôre about to send a hate message think to yourself ‚ÄúIs it really worth getting upset about this?‚Äù And just move on. For me, I get my ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù and ‚Äúhow the fuck does that not hit‚Äù out of the way then move on. I usually get hate messages from the survivors I killed so that calms me down. 
---
So yeah I guess listening to music, podcasts, whatever to distract you will help. 
---
This is why Huntress is the best killer.
---
What a shit advice they gave you
---
I mean that's not a problem with the hatch, realistically you can have 1-2 people doing jack shit all match and still escape if the other 2-3 people are competent enough to make up for their slack. That isn't really a hatch issue.
---
The hatch isn't a freebie, and if the killer really wants a team wipe he can definitely play around it with slugging and other methods of play. It isn't like the hatch just spawns on the survivor and lets them escape instantly...
---
What is this.
---
Sem problemos bud (Np)
---
Because gen rushing and being forced to slow the game down.
---
THATS IT IM GETTING ME MALLET
---
Alcoholism is a good remedy for playing killer
---
It's Myers using scratched mirror :^)
---
Come on dude it's (current year).
---
The issue isnt hitting them, but rather picking them up. I was able to down them several times but they got up with No Mither every time because I couldn't get on top of them.
---
You have 5 hatchets. 
---
FOMO
---
Indeed. You ran directly into the chainsaw and by dcing yoi put your (former) teammates to a disadvantage. Stop promoting toxic selfish behaviour! 
---
??????????????????????????
---
I was NOT talking about lag switchers, hitboxes or "Other issues".
---
You're off topic, wildly.
---
That is so awesome!
---
I was just about to say.
---
No that's some random youtuber that nobody cares about except pre-pubescent teenage girls
---
Killers still hit Survivors long after they vault or set pallets down, lunges don't even have to connect most times i hear them miss. Since Devs are nerfing the things that make Survivors op then they should nerf the crutches that Killers have to make the game skillful.
---
Sorry, but I'm really missing the point here.
---
that hook was well deserved 
---
You can bleed out for a reason just wait for them to pick themselves back up and lob a hatchet.
---
First, why are you lying to try to make a point? Put the pictures side by side; the skill check zones are inherently different from each other. 
---
Second, even experienced streamers miss skill checks. My point with respect to missing it,  is that ypu don't get a second chance to hit it - if you miss it, you've still used up your one time use.
---
i've never seen a discussion flair, only shitpost flairs lol
---
lmao i dont see why not to camp like why am i just gonna let you get free
---
Woah, it's just a meme bud...
---
Sort by new. It's practically the only time you'll see them. 
---
I just listen to songs while playing killer. It just depends on how you play (wether you're better at chases while watching the survivor, looking at tracks or listening to breathing, the crows) 
---
Not caring much also works. If you just try to have fun you won't get as tilted playing killer. If you start getting mad play a different game.
---
red rank on console would have like 7 people
---
Doubt it, considering we've heard nothing besides the fact that the DS change will be in it.
---
That said, if it is 2+ weeks behind schedule, it may be a BIG update.
---
I'm talking New Chapter, DS Change AND Freddy rework. All in one patch.
---
So my biggest problem with buffing... hey look, a puppy. What a cute puppy. Have you ever seen Event Horizon?  It‚Äôs a great movie.  
---
Focus your thoughts!  There‚Äôs good perk, worse perks, and better perks. There will always be ones that seem lackluster and won‚Äôt be chosen. Even with buffs.
---
Most balanced match in any game EVER
---
toxic survivors shit their pants real quick once you start swinging. i managed to actually down someone while carrying a survivor the other day, they were the last two alive as well.
---
Hyperbole. Well yeah, but like they rarely do. Why do you think people laugh or call themselves idiots when they do? I‚Äôm pretty experienced in walking but sometimes I trip. If you can‚Äôt hit the skill check you definitely didn‚Äôt deserve that 2nd chance.
---
I was able to do that with just a simple lunge, though. No need to use something as fancy as hatchets if it can be done normally. Even if they could've eventually bleed out, doing so wouldve taken at least 10 minutes and at that point it would be more of a "Fuck you" statement rather than just trying to get the survivor.
---
Xenomorphs are ancient as a species, that‚Äôs the only thing I can think of. 
---
Ok, might be self-promotion but well done!
---
Oh. Well either way you shouldn‚Äôt be getting mad at missing skill checks.
---
Why would someone pay for a game you already have, or pay for your game in general. Stop begging on the internet for money and go buy it yourself 
---
&gt;If the survivors are any good at hiding they can complete 1-2 gens before I‚Äôve started a chase.
---
Lmfao wtf dude? Thats a you problen not a generator problem.
---
I don't get it? How is ruin staying up causing you to suffer from success? 
---
So you can chase and hook other survivors, interrupting gen progress. Also getting more bloodpoints and creating a more fun game.
---
Unless there was an implicit /s in there, then my bad.
---
But the movie takes place in 2079. I would be pissed if they didn‚Äôt have Ripley as a survivor.
---
Who is mad? I just made objective observations about DS.
---
Take note of mistakes survivors make and laugh at them. That helps me a lot. 
---
I think you have that very backwards. I can play like a potato and still counter so many killer perks. It comes down to communication and to many people not willing to do it
---
I can only imagine the horror or how it would be. Maybe hear the \*dong\* sound and have to look at generator to see skillcheck, taking your eye off the killers direction only to look back and see him staring you down. Guarantee be a LOT more fear.
---
You said it took skill to use it, which is like not at all true.
---
Contributing
---
if the game was meant to be played in squads, solo would have more communication options open to them other than point and beckon. Being in a squad with discord completely defeats the purpose of leaving out a voice chat system, even after people asked for it.
---
Other entries in the Alien series show the Aliens themselves being thousands of years old (if I‚Äôm correct) which makes them very old. The species themselves are very old, the killer itself is very old, not necessarily the scenario it‚Äôs placed in. 
---
Me too. ;D
---
It's literally called a skill check lol
---
I recommend to play as hillbilly or nurse for like one evening of your time, and I guarantee you'll do better. Also you should learn how to run windows because a lot of killers don't know how to do that.
---
Hello there 
---
Just realized that the same scene happens in Shaun of the dead.
---
admitting you're on a pedestal? argument won.
---
I guess, but in all honesty I just want a (good) original killer. Most of the licenses aren‚Äôt very good. Clown &gt; Bubba and Huntress &gt; Myers. Not saying Myers isn‚Äôt good but Myers is the only good character. The others have boring powers that linger in mid tier with the exception of Freddy.
---
What if it were a human-sized bug?
---
Greedy farmers have killed even more.
---
Problem #903579821798 with Leatherface
---
Get that logic tf outta here
---
But it don‚Äôt take skill. It‚Äôs checking for skill. Not testing it. If you think a skill check requires some immense skill I don‚Äôt know what to say.
---
how do you manage to make every single one of these terrible
---
Your right, I should have explained in more detail about repetition and practice will lead to positive results. Should have explained to a lvl 1 that your loadout might be the issue, but you know that.
---
I take everything back. We should contact the devs, tell them the game isn't easy enough, and that more focus needs to be placed on hindering other players strategy. 
---
While were at it, we should also tell the devs of Super Meat Boy and the devs of CupHead that there games are hard, therefore shouldnt be allowed to exist because I'm a lvl one and I'm not the problem...
---
I make up for it by literally prestiging nobody (except Quentin once) on surcivir side. And now I'm 3 levels away from P3 Level 50 Pig
---
It's one of the reasons Freddy is so annoying to deal with (just like Wraith). Unless you are hiding behind a concrete wall with your back towards map exterior for a while when you hear the song, you can never be sure if he can see you or not. 
---
And this makes playing Freddy one of the few genuinely hilarious expreriences in DBD. Claudette nervoursly staring at the bush but actually in clear view for you because you are 30¬∞ to the right never gets old.
---
No competition on the market.
---
Fookin dead ard
---
maybe just maybe they have sprint burst and have to save it sweaty. toxic survivor :)
---
Yeah it sucks, but on the bright side, the better you do without powerful perks, the better you're getting with the character. You'll eventually find yourself comfortable enough with a killer to not *need* those perks, but they always help.  
---
It's also how good nurses got good with nurse, they ran with no perks so that they didn't need to rely on them to do well.
---
I guess you embraced the sluttiness of the sub.  I still feel bad for your inbox.
---
because its fucking fun to make people salty as shit
---
Git gud noob.
---
Nah it‚Äôs really not. It‚Äôs a team game so logically it means friends will play together hence the survive with friends option and the ability see each other‚Äôs names for invites. Expecting the game to get balanced around solo q is silly because all it does is buff swf even more then it already is. If they didn‚Äôt want to we wouldn‚Äôt have the ability nor would we see each other‚Äôs names to send invites. 
---
Yeah, even Legion is super bearable. Its hard to walk backwards with a controller.
---
You get used to it. Eventually you come to accept that survivors will ALWAYS be shitty people, and once you see past that, it becomes satisfying to watch them lose and cry in the post game. That satisfaction you get from destroying survivors that act like douchebags help keep you calm long enough to see that resolution to the end. 
---
Source: I'm a Killer who shrugs off all the teabaggery and scummy playstyles and is delighted to see survivors bitch and whine because no matter how many crutch perks and flashlight batteries they brought, they still died. 
---
Should've put a last game where it was only the loading screen, you know?
---
Yo, apologies if this is yours (which that seems so.) one of my friends posted this in the DBD discord I‚Äôm in a while ago. When I recently got Reddit, I thought it would be good on the DBD Reddit, that‚Äôs all my man :). All of my DBD posts is stuff my friends put in the discord.
---
Please, you will talk when the adulte are finished.
---
Until, eat your vegetables, kid.
---
She either wants you dead or is aiming for the skilled huntress achievement
---
Hot Fuzz memes trump normal memes any day.
---
Yeah music doesnt help. I act blind and lost as hell when I even run whispers. I with whispers was a visual thing instead. But yeh playing killer is rough so my advice is a few things.
---
1) find and play killers you feel comfortable with. No point playing a killer like nurse if she makes you motion sick. Or huntress if you cant hit them with hatchets just yet. 
---
2) alternate between survivor/killer or killer you like/killer your trying to learn.
---
3) go in to every game with the mindset that you already lost. If you expect to lose then cool but if you win then its a nice surprise.
---
4) play a gimmicky build. I play the doctor who doesnt shock people(but still 4ks) 
---
5) Play a shitton of solo que survivor. It will improve you as a survivor give you a chance to see how others play. And the best killers play survivors and less likely to fall for their tricks. 
---
6) time... i used to get so upset when playing killer that id be trembling from frustration. But eventually I improved and win more games then I lose. So the ones I played like shit in I can see what I did wrong if anything and improve. 
---
Adding maybe a minute or two isn‚Äôt a huge cost. We do it daily. Even if they have noed they should only ever get one kill off it. I consider noed the killers hatch
---
I mean to be honest you can see many reposts here with ton of upvotes
---
And The World‚Äôs End; all three of the Cornetto Trilogy‚Äôs films have a character hopping a fence, as well as a few other things.
---
You know, that's a good point. I'm just used to not having that issue on my old PC so it's taking a while to adjust, but I guess it's better to deal with it. Besides, other people tend to totem hunt when they see ruin anyway
---
Leprechaun just in time for St. Patrick's Day, clearly... :p
---
Ice-T as the chapter's survivor.
---
And Leprechaun's terror radius is just like Freddy's except instead of the lullaby you hear: 
---
"Lep in the hood comes to do no good
---
Lep in the hood comes to do no good"
---
You are telling us that you are rank 1 so you are good bit you're facing all day killers that camp.
---
So bad killers.
---
So bad killers killing a bad survivor then right ?
---
The game hard punish camping already, even more with the DS rework. Really stop complaining for nothing.
---
They have the same communication options as swf tho. Headsets
---
I didn't mean it literally, of course she will get stunned and blocked by pallets. By "ignored pallets with her invisibility" I meant that she can be completely unpredictable and make pallets not matter in a chase (unless it's a really safe pallet).
---
It isn't that black and white. It's not like you either "facecamp" or "literally let them escape". You're just calling yourself out as a bad player.
---
Bit of a stretch man.  You have the option to play with swf and balancing it wouldn't be difficult anyway a simple totem counter would do so you'd know how many totems are left for baby noeds.  It wouldn't buff swf at all since they already know how many are left since they're talking to each other anyways lol.
---
Or dodging SWF. Which is fine.
---
Excuse ME never disrespect Michael Meyers OR Jeffree Star like that ever again
---
Rank doesn‚Äôt mean a whole lot. It‚Äôs a bit more black and white than that. There are people who get off on doing stuff like this and those that don‚Äôt. 
---
Lol and killers are the one who cry.
---
Yeah to be honest I didn't *really* have a problem with it before. It was annoying, sure, but at least it wasn't *every. single. game.* that I would go against it. Now it is so easy to get people don't even bother using other perks and it's not even a teachable for God's sake. At least with DS it's a licensed teachable so brand new survivors won't be likely to have it at all. 
---
I once went against a white rank killer due to the poor matchup system whose only perk was tier 1 NOED and they actually got a kill with it by facecamping. It's kind of sad that new players learn to play by relying on it so easily.
---
That's cool. Tell your friends I'm glad they went dumpster diving for my OC :)
---
I just do gens all game, I‚Äôll run the killer around if they find me but I‚Äôd rather not be the one going for hook saves, altruism always seems to get me killed 
---
Lol fine if you're soft as baby shit.  No offense but if you are afraid to fight a swf you don't belong in the killer role.  Killers aren't supposed to fear anything.  Also those groups make you a better killer.  Most satisfying wins ever come from wrecking a cocky 4 man.
---
No you attempted to be a smart ass and offer no actual criticism all while being condescending and literally your first word was wrong. Saying "my load-out is the problem" is in no way smart or thought out. Offering suggestions for perks to run to help against camping would have actually been well received but instead you needed to measure your internet penis against everyone else's instead of actually engaging in a healthy conversation. 
---
that‚Äôs valid, and understandable 
---
&gt;Adding maybe a minute or two isn‚Äôt a huge cost.
---
It absolutely is. Play against Zubat or Ryanpez and tell me crucial a "minute or two" can be.
---
&gt;Even if they have noed they should only ever get one kill off it.
---
Which is why it's imbalanced. DS can give you a free win when you don't deserve it, NOED can do the same.
---
Is killer in general a bit of a pain to play as on console? I would guess that if it is then the balance is probably a bit fairer for console players. 
---
youre right i am a bad player, do i care? no? im having fun doing it
---
Thanks UwU
---
Sound is a crutch. Scratch Marks are a crutch. Lmaooo you had me in the first half, chief. Well done. 
---
Hey chief I asked you question, aren't the players using voice boosts the people getting easier matches?? 
---
I‚Äôve played a lot of hillbilly and nurse, I can‚Äôt figure them out. And like I said, chases aren‚Äôt my problem, I know how to loop and deal with windows and shit, it‚Äôs just finding the survivors to begin with. Being colourblind makes things difficult lol.
---
I don't dodge swf unless toxic 4 squadette. 
---
But I can understand it. It is annoying as hell to face a team that runs 6 perks.
---
I love playing killer, but it‚Äôs probably a lot easier with a mouse. Thats probably another reason killers seem a bit OP on PC. A mouse and keyboard is better fit for the killer‚Äôs first person compared to the survivor‚Äôs third. But who knows, im just a dumb Billy and Dwight main.
---
I can't because of my potato pc. Sue me.
---
That or it's just been delayed.
---
It‚Äôs not easy doing it if you solo que. you can only get so many on your own with doing gens and getting chased, saves etc.
---
Taking forever. And its sunday. 
---
A killer afraid of a cosmetic... brings me back to some of my favorite horror movies that all feature that one scene of the killer running away from their victims in horror because they worse a costume.   Again dude stop playing a killer you're already wearing the dress so you might as well play Feng or something and just stick to survivor.  
---
I like the idea. Would certainly be worth trying on a PTB.
---
He's not around, but what he's left behind is a wound that'll need time to heal.
---
I thought it would have launch Skyrim
---
This gun runs blendette and premonition and hides by hatch all game!
---
I can never not find this scene amusing.
---
You requested a handicap for your poo poo strategy. I suggested you tried to get better at what is given and occurs in the game. You didn't like that. Sorry bro, go practice instead of asking for a handicap 
---
"Baby killer" ah fun, there are some killers who are smart and can see a 4 man derank squad when they see them. And no matter how amazing the killer you will derank it's the purpose of those groups and they are 9/10 not even matching with people that are of equal skill but people who are rank 10-7. Sorry but a group of p3 claudettes urban evading through the map isnt my idea of fun as a killer
---
lol
---
Basically you should stop the game, you are toxic as fuck and if two comments make you that salty the best is probably to question your life's choice.
---
How it dying? I have no problems finding a match, as killer or survivor. 
---
Camping has a viable spot in Dead By Daylight, the devs have even said themselves that it‚Äôs alright to do. 
---
Yeah something like if a killer is within 16m of a hook and there are no survivors with 28m or the exit gates are not powered then your FOV narrows and your movement speed slows a little bit every 10 seconds and lasts until 10 seconds after the survivor is unhooked. Any debuffs will go away if the killer leaves the 16m radius, but will return to what they last were if the killer re-enters the area while the survivor is still hooked. Finally, debuffs will not apply after the first 10 seconds but will double up as if they did starting at 20 and then increase like normal, and debuffs will reset each time a NEW survivor is hooked. (Might as well discourage the camping and tunneling of one guy bc the killer has a grudge or something)
---
Haunted grounds strongest killer perk? No way
---
You need to be using headphones to play killer adequately. Last night I caught a meg just because I could hear her breathing loudly. My advice is try not to take things to seriously. I used to get riled up after a particularly bad round but now I just go in with no expectations with a mindset not necessarily to win but to just do well. 
---
I think that the framerate would give a hudge advantage to pc users.
---
Also "make it crossplatform" is not on the hand of the devs only.
---
Lol I'm salty because I'm telling you to man up and play the teams you get matched with.  If you're that insecure about your killer play man it may be best to stick with survivor or play Civilization or something.  I'm a rank 1 killer every month and I'll play a 4 man 4 flashlight lobby I don't care.  Rise to the challenge don't cower from it.
---
If he ever does get into this game he better have multiple Moris! Maybe based on which Survivor he's killing.
---
Since you wanted ideas, here are mine (put as simply as possible):
---
**Meg** \- Jason grabs her by the head and crushes her skull (her model doesn't actually change, there's just a lot of blood an eyeball flies out and she falls on her face to hide that her face didn't actually break).
---
**Dwight** \- Jason stabs him through the skull. Dwight twitches erratically on the ground, so Jason steps on and breaks his neck to make him stop squirming.
---
**Jake** \- Jason snaps his back by bending him over backwards with his bare hands.
---
**Claudette** \- Jason steps on her chest and pulls her arms out of their sockets (again, since model destruction is a no-no for BHVR her real arms bend back into the ground and Jason rips off identical arms that were never actually attached (like how the Clown's Mori works) bloody stumps are attached to her model to cover the bent limbs).
---
**Nea** \- Jason grabs at her, but she dodges. Her grabs again, catches her, lifts her into the air holding her neck and chokes the life out of her as he stares at her face and tilts his head.
---
**Laurie** \- Jason swings at her while she's on the ground but she rolls out of the way, kicks Jason full in the face and grabs his machete as she gets to her feet. She slams the machete into his shoulder, but he grabs her neck in both hands as she does and wrings her neck until she dies. He pulls the machete out of his head afterwards.
---
**Bill** \- Jason stabs him in the stomach. Bill spits blood onto his mask before Jason pulls the machete out. As Bill falls to his knees, Jason turns to leave but Bill grabs his leg and pulls him back. Jason turns to look at Bill, yanks his leg free and walks away as Bill reaches out and dies.
---
**Ace** \- Jason slices off Ace's arms as he lies on the ground (same way as Claudette) before slamming his machete into Ace's head.
---
**Feng** \- Jason holds Feng's head in his left hand as she punches at him. He lifts the machete to her neck and slits her throat. As she clutches at the blood pouring out, Jason slices off her left leg (the actual leg gets tucked into her chest, while the duplicate falls away (as with Claudette a fake stump is attached to the model)) and she falls to the ground.
---
**David** \- David punches Jason in his hockey mask. Jason stumbles backwards. David tries to punch him again, but Jason grabs his fist and twists his arm. As David yells in pain, Jason throws down his machete into the ground and punches David in the stomach five times. As David starts coughing up blood, Jason lets go of his arm, grabs his head in both hands and knees him in the face. As David falls to the ground coughing and gasping, Jason grabs his machete and stabs him through the neck.
---
**Quentin** \- Jason impales Quentin in the stomach and throws him to the ground. As Jason walks away, Quentin coughs, gets to his feet and grabs Jason from behind, pulling on his head, trying to break his neck. Jason whirls, and throws Quentin off of his back. As Quentin gasps on the ground and tries to get up, Jason takes his machete and stabs Quentin in the face, killing him.
---
**Kate** \- Jason takes the machete in both hands and slams it down through a supine Kate's neck, decapitating her (same as Claudette).
---
**Adam** \- Jason grabs Adam by the neck, lifting into the air. As Adam struggles Jason guts him (like Lisa's Mori, organs come spilling out) and then tosses him away when he dies.
---
**Jeff** \- Jason throws down his machete, grabs Jeff, raises him into the air, and breaks his back over his knee. Jason retrieves his machete, notices Jeff is still groaning and stomps onto the back off his head, cracking his skull.
---
**Tommy Jarvis** *(We better get him if we get Jason)* \- Jason slams his machete into the side of Tommy's skull. As Tommy clutches at the machete Jason grabs him by the shoulders and throws him to the ground face first so that his face slides down the machete's blade as he hits the ground. Jason retrieves the blade and hacks at Tommy's back until he stops moving (four swings).

If you get downed from NOED, the killer didn't lose, you did. Popping five generators doesn't mean you should pat yourself in the back and cruise to a win, your objective isn't complete yet. 
---
dunno how thats edgy but okay buddy
---
Yup - youre right - only good survivors have never gotten hooked once in their entire DBD career. 
---
I've spent much more than I expected.
---
It is a big not effort to go rank1 so keep your dick in place.
---
You see, you have no power kid. I do what I want. Keep your salt for all the teabag that will wait for you :)
---
Haha better than a Freddy and Claudette main I'm sure. My framerate is bad due to my poor quality computer but I've played on my friend's super fast PC before and it was so easy to play killer compared to my usual 10 fps, I would assume its sort of like that in regards to the gap between playing on console vs playing on PC. 
---
And there's those of us that challenge that sweaty swf and say bring it.  Any team is beatable man.  You'll never improve your play dodging the rough lobbies.  Theres things to learn from every game.
---
wig snatched
---
What? Solos can't communicate by voice, at least on PC whereas SWF can just pop open discord. The level of communication by voices trumps any other way.
---
I don‚Äôt get it, what‚Äôs the bug
---
My god you've done it
---
Her skin is grey and her neck hangs limply like it's broken. Also her Valentine's skin has her missing her heart and a significant portion of her upper chest.
---
Agree to disagree, but I'm pretty sure she's dead.
---
And my strategy was what? Never get hooked? Genius. How can you possibly defend a killer camping someone to death on their first hook.  No matter how good you are you will eventually get hooked. 
---
Nah they are.
---
But I am fine with camping. It is a guaranted win for my mate. 
---
Facecamp is just bad we both know it.
---
And then the Survivor hits you with DS, and boom, you lose. Just because you downed him doesn't mean you win, you still had to get him to a hook. You lose.
---
Lol alright baby killer go dodge lobbies until you find those basic Dwight's your after.  The rest of us won't puss out at the first sign of a challenge.
---
I‚Äôd be ok with a totem counter. Idk if it would completely fix the issue but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt any. The big thing is getting people to cleanse them at all. People seem to think cleansing a dull totem is equivalent of pulling teeth
