Sure sounds like you do.

It’s hard to find time in the day to sit in ques that don’t pop, mainly due to work! Hoping to get there soon though.

not funny legit baby yoda memes aren't funny
---
This year my birthday is on Friday the 13th
---
Yeah, I've come to expect it. And no, Self-Care isn't UTTER trash, especially for newer players saving points and getting hit more, but it's far from the best choice.
---
Fair on that clarification. There's been a lot of entitled survivors of late and this post does come off as such before clarification.
---

---
And bonus fairness for your edit that uses hours played as a metric to gauge skill level.
---
But the whole survivor queue time is really a creation of survivors. And almost every survivor complaint is just looking for a quick fix without regard to how the killer side of things will be affected by it. It's honestly sad to see how our community is one of the most entitled communities in online games.
---
That entitlement is the reason low-rank killers stopped playing. It's what created the long survivor queues, because killers just don't see it as worthwhile to play against that sort of toxic, entitled survivors. 
---
I won't even say every survivor is like that. It's a small percentage, to be sure... But unfortunately, when you face 4 survivors every game, even a 25% toxic survivor ratio is going to mean a toxic survivor every game -- Which ruins the game.
---
But hey, I'll admit I misunderstood and jumped to my point a bit quickly. Happy things are clearer.
---
While survivors do have a meta it's interesting to note that killers use BBQ + Ruin more than survivors use their top 3 meta perks combined. In addition, perk selection should in theory be more varied since different powers mean different perk synergy yet their meta is stronger than survivors'.
---
What tracking perk besides sfts could you recommend?

He's not a time traveller; He just plays F13 with friends.
---
This is great. Lol
---
At least with the new rank reset thing it'll be easier to maintain a rank for the newer players.
---
Aren't you contradicting yourself tho? You've said you never heard anybody say that. Dig a little more and we'll find people have been saying the same very recently at least about Hawkins
---
I'm not defending BL nerf, but in no way I believe you've never heard complaints about it especially after you admit yourself doing the same even when applied only to specific case
---
Or they hang out in their respective realms actually
---
Yes, the entire DbD community hates brown people don't you know
---
Good to know that trick
---
Holy fuck I thought my wraith was feeling weird. His speed curve feels ridiculous
---
r/StabbyGang UNITE!!!
---
Not a third chainsaw killer :(
---
I see it better than it might be, but in context if the survivors live, they just end up in another trial. They will never live to see daylight. There was never supposed to be daylight because they will inevitably die
---
That incarnation of Ash isn't from any of the Evil Dead *movies*, he's from the TV show Ash vs Evil Dead.
---
The more you know :)
---
as long as you remember the cardinal rule- never get in a locker when playing against huntress
---
I hope they add pennywise as a killer
---
Deceased after dawn.
---
Also reminds me I have some parody movies I need to watch.
---
Very generous of you, ty for giving some goodies to the community c:
---
i'll never understand why people can't get it through their thick skulls to lead the killer away from the victim. 
---
this is absolutely NOT camping, tunneling, or any of that other rubbish.
---
I run a generator build, so whenever I see NOED...
---
[https://gph.is/1L5Zy8g](https://gph.is/1L5Zy8g)
---
Pants are a bit weird in game though
---
Yikes...You sound so entitled.
---
 People like you make people like me not want to play as a killer anymore. Much of the whining and negativity on this subreddit is of survivor mains complaining about how the game should be adjusted to their desires constantly, not taking into consideration that everybody doesn't play survivor, and most people who play survivor aren't even good enough players to make such demands. 
---
If more survivors stopped doing toxic things, then more people would want to play as killer, thus the queue times being adjusted. 
---
...Nobody wants to wait five+ minutes for a match just for the survivors to DC as soon as you down them. I'd rather play something else.
---
Devs should just cut their losses and accept that mending was a terrible mechanic that nobody likes to play against and is really difficult to balance around. After that they should just fully rework Legion to either be able to camouflage as a survivor or be able to switch between them like literally everyone wanted them to in the first place.
---
It’s just a half arsed fix.
---
It's  far more likely that whatever they have planned as "event" releases on tuesday. I haven't seen his video, but tuesday the next christmas skins get released, tome 4 opens, and tuesday is usually the day we get new stuff anyway. Last year it was 17th december so it being 18 this year would make sense
---
Yeah, but if it doesn't apply on Feral Frenzy it's literally unplayable /s
---
Me?  I main the cat in the hat
---
Ah, it was a salty P3 Claudette. I got a hook on the corner of the shack and she sat right behind the pallet expecting me to fall for that. 
---
The hook killed themself as someone else ran up. Like... dude, I’m literally putting pressure on every gen by standing here waiting for your move.
---
It was Noed.  I finished last gen in killers face and then got slapped with NoED. Killer was laggy and this hook was the result
---
Don't get too excited for the event though! We won't get objective based events for a while, so it might just be double BP or indeed the christmas decorations if we get them
---
I mean yea.... kind of the point of perks and addons.make it easier.
---
You'll float too!!
---
Lmaoooo
---
Yeah. If I reach 1 million bloodpoints and used up all my streamers and puddings I prestige. The other bloodpoint offerings are not worth it. The hollow shell offering (25% all) gives you 8000 more bp in the best case scenario where you max out each category. That’s like 1 or 2 items in the bloodweb. The green bloodpoint offerings are even worse. I guess if you want to be as efficient as possible you would use all of them up but it really won’t make much of a difference. 
---
With pudding/streamer and bbq you can get enough bloodpoints to finish two level 50 bloodwebs. With no offering and bbq you can finish one level 50 bloodweb. Adding 8000 more points won’t help you finish two bloodwebs unless you get lucky with entity manipulation.
---
Ah yeah. Mount ormond is when white power really comes into play.
---
what did I just watch LOL
---
Not to mention BPS
---
Michael overpowers the Entity so the Entity taking killers hostage really doesn't apply here.
---
I don't really wanna make a new post because it seems to be a common question. How do I get that mask and is it possible to get now?
---
There is certain criteria that has to be met as far as how many gens are left compared to how many survivors are left. The hatch can spawn with the last two survivors and if they work together they can escape together
---
waaaaaaaaaaah
---
Some of them even share an actor. Laurie's voice actress also voices Jane
---
It is not skill-less, and yes, it was definitely rewarding. Survivors would have to play around pallets more and exploit them less. What is a problem with that?
---
No miner
---
Yellow borrowed time

Yellow borrowed time
---
same, my right thumb is messed up from being slammed in a truck door so spamming the A button hurts my thumb and is quite hard and frankly just annoying to do even with my pointer finger.
---
Hey man listen, you do you if you wanna wear a pink sweater go ahed and be fabulous.
---
This has happened to me twice. Once while I was in the middle of a match on sanctum and once in the end game screen. It just started ear raping me out of nowhere, I almost had a heart attack
---
Are you aware of what Wake Up does?
---
Maybe make Legion a delayed one-shot killer, and make the sprinting a gap closer, but somewhat unreliable?
---
Wake up! is a perk that exists?
---
Weh weh I can't get my free escape
---
Yep, and iirc Wraith and David (and maybe Michael or Bubba) have the same actor as well. (Don't quote me tho)
---
The only clown that I acknowledge
---
Please dont run selfcare, its a terrible perk. Just use medkits, adrenaline, bond or inner strength
---
If it bugs you, go for inside map offerings. Guarantee spawn further apart. Wake up! too,!as the comments say
---
Pretty sure the goddamn Chosen One should clobber that bitch into next month
---
the first 1 is my p3 claudette ass knowing the killer aint gonna see me
---
I got so many blood party streamers that I'll never use.. as if I want to benefit the side I'm playing against before I even know what kind of game its gonna be.
---
Miner trapper loads in and instantly grts mori'd
---
and only removable after 1 gen is done
---
I actually think it (and the Feng equivalent) are like the most tacky and cheap looking skins. It reminds me of riot girl Tristana from league of legends, just a hair change and stickers added on. If these skins were on league, I'd price them at the lowest tier (520RP iirc)
---
I never said Nemisis and Legion didn’t need to be changed. It’s just the way they did it. They somehow managed to make deep wounds even LESS threatening.
---
RBT no longer deplete while sprinting
---
A pallet that you can set down and be able to loop more. An unsafe pallet is one that you have to get a stun to be able to run away. (They can just go around the obstacle and catch you easy
---
Wake up: Am I a joke to you?
---
The issue is, you can’t control when to use no miner. You can control to tbag in the exit gates and look at GF (Myers would’ve been a better choice), stand in the open with a Billy. But no mither is a yes or no perk.
---
Repeatedly hitting things nearby can get the message across, just gotta make it look deliberate.
---
how many times is this joke going to get posted?
---
Bill also has a muttered "why" when he's on your shoulder.
---
Further
---
What did you do for it to happen?
---
That’s normal when I play on PS4 and reporting them does nothing because BhVR has no power over suspending people.
---
Also wish BhVR would fix that healing glitch!!! It’s been around all year and those incompetent fools still haven’t fixed it!
---
I have no clue. It seems to be a completely random glitch.
---
Because gen speeds are ridiculous if you don't have Ruin (especially with Leader being a thing) and BBQ is mainly a bloodpoint booster.
---
One person who looped the killer for 80% of the game got downed to noed and the two other randoms dipped. I stumbled across noed in a desperate search for it and ended up getting our teams mvp out.
---
Your arguement is the same with ds , “how am I supposed to know if this guy has ds or not , aight imma pick him up and hope I don’t get stabbed in the back”
---
Fucking survivors man, they nerfed every killer to oblivion and they still complain
---
I advanced for leaving the Nemesis interaction as it is, without the follow-up nerf.
---
Oh yeah you may be right but hopefully characters too because on Black Friday wanted to get clown chapter but was normal price
---
I mean... Those are English words... but they don’t seem to mean anything.
---
Do you refer to yourself as dad? Is that what you’re trying to get at?
---
Are you so rattled and confused that you had to devolve into a “I fucked your mom” insult?
---
I’d expect more from a big-shot youtuber with 54 subscribers...
---
I would be on board with you...
---
You must be new to this subreddit then, it’s always been the killers bitching and complaining on here
---
I love and hate everything about this video.
---
I meant replace bbq for sloppy
---
It’s a long sword which would usually measure 6 feet
---
If they're new and on Switch then no
---
If they're on Switch then they might not
---
Software development in a nutshell. It's obscenely hard to catch every bug because you need hours of playtime of edge cases and rate occurences, and often times changing or adding something completely unrelated to something breaks that thing somehow.
---
Out gamered my dude
---
I come across more nooby David’s and Bills than any other character. I don’t get why they don’t have a meme lol

*'scuse me?*
---
They also sound rushed. The pause your supposed to have after a period does bot seem to be there. Though I fault the writing really, most of the text just doesn't flow well, hard on the ears.
---
the lawsuit ends june 2020.
---
There’s still been no confirmed event at all
---
It seems pretty normal to since is always the killers who get nerfed
---
Jason never uses a chainsaw :)
---
It’s not about Tru3 using it, it’s just that if everyone is injured it slows all actions by 15%, with sloppy on top of that it makes it much longer to heal and therefore it slows the game down quite a lot.
---
No I have a better one. 
---
When you aren’t looking around like you should be late at night and cranking on the gen and all of a sudden you see a snout poke out the right side of your screen towards you and stop. 
---
You know you just fucked up...
---
I got my adept because of the tbag. I had two guys left and I kept slugging them and they kept getting each other up. It finally ended when I started conversing with the downed Nea via worm wiggles and teabagging which attracted the David who strolled up from behind the corner and let me down him
---
Feng Mins voice actor is just a dog squeaky toy
---
jason would fit nicely into dbd, unfortunately those other killers wouldn’t make any sense being in f13 because, well, they’re not jason.
---
What's the point of M&amp;A?
---
Me and you have different mindsets I think. I can totally see why you wouldn’t like moris but I can handle them, and I play solo, so body blocking and flashlight saves don’t usually happen at least to save me. I also get real fast queue times and don’t have to wait for a friend to finish the match. I suppose those are all fair points, and although they’ll still have to wait in most games moris would be especially awful. 
---
Also moris usually just automatically make the game a hatch game unless everyone really puts in the work, and hatch games are god awful for swf aren’t they? Leaving someone to die isn’t an option for them, when I can leave 3 dead teammates and call it a win. 
---
Yeah I wasn’t thinking about swf as much as I should, it sucks 10 times worse for them then solos. They should probably get changed then
---
Wake up exists but it's so bad there's no point in using it.
---
Wake up, Resilience, and Spine Chill, good sir.
---
I love running Rancor
---
Haha.  I think just had a bad moment.
---
I think you mean prove thyself, leader doesn’t affect gen speeds.
---
waaaaaaa rhaaaa yah whaaaa
---
I have been told SB only adds an additional three seconds to healing; I’m not sure if that’s for SC or if that’s being heals by another survivor/with a medkit, but still, that’s an abysmally low number for a whole perk slot.
---
Plot twist: that is where the voice a thing is from
---
Man, How come I don't get potatoes?, All my survivors today were fucking doing gens at the speed of light and they did everything perfectly
---
Id put DS over self care tbh.
---
That’s normally what I get as killer. But I get potato groups as survivor. -.-
---
For swf, I've recently found that Breakout can be really fun, esp if other players have perks like flip flop and boil over.
---
For non-swf, I love PEBBLE TIME. (Aka Diversion.) It's difficult to pull off on higher ranks, but when it works it's so satisfying to slink off while the killer searches an empty corner.
---
Im just lvl3 with him and have no chance against full perk/adds on teamers :( never tried before so if you have any advices to me dont hesitate to tell me :P
---
Same, every fucking time, When I play killer and commit to one chase: *can do gens with ruin in 5 secs*
---
Survivors when I get chased for 300 seconds: *5 gens left*
---
Dead hard makes up for mistakes. Its a free get-out-of-jail card like ds except you have full control over it.
---
What's wrong?
---
Ds is helpful for countering campers and tunnelers, though. Some survivors just chase you around while it’s active and waste it, though
---
Its funny how you write this paragraph but what I said went right over your head because you're too stupid to get it. Its okay mr big shot. At least I have quality content, whether I have 54 subs or not. Shows how much of a piece of shit you are tryna insult me for that. Not my fault im better than you at any video game. Keep hiding on reddit 🤡 and talk when you put yourself out there.
---
Yikes
---
I suppose you all LOVE vanilla sex too?
---
Thank you
---
On console I usually focus on wounding as many survivors as possible when using my power.
---
I always use Discordance with him as it will show you the locations of half the team when active which benefits your power.
---
why, do we finally get jason?

---
I wish console got to play him at his best. 
---
I'm still having so much trouble with managing his power and when to use him in an ambush
---
This means that self care is better than anyone and everyone is better than dogshit. How wholesome
---
Well,they didn’t get the rights to the character,only the mask.Which leads me to believe,if we ever do get Jason,we’ll only get his fingernails,and we have to create a simpler character underneath.But hey,we have his fingernails!
---
I'm just going to add here that when DbD first came out they had nowhere near 500 employees. In fact I'm fairly certain it was maybe only around 20 people. If someone has the correct numbers they can tell you, I'm at least certain they were a small indie studio.
---
What the fuck.
---
Ok...
---
And complaining about the anti camping and tunneling perks of course.
---
True, still figuring everything out, one step at a time
---
Thank you 😁
---
I seriously doubt she would fan girl over someone who specialized in using family weaponry to slice and dice people for funsies.
---
Hey. Worked for Freddy.
---
If the Supreme Court rules on it (which they probably won’t). Unfortunately, unless Horror Inc wins the case (which they really probably won’t) they’ll still need to suss out a rights sharing agreement with Victor Miller. That won’t happen immediately and — considering the sheer amount of spite that has allowed this case to reach this point — might not happen at all.

Is Trapper on the rise from the Archives? He never seemed as picked as he has recently
---
We are fine, thank you. If people bothered playing him more instead of making all the circlejerks we would be even better.
---
Don’t need to put myself out there because I don’t feel the need to prove myself for approval.
---
And “spinning” against rank 20s isn’t skill *or* quality content.
---
If it was, you’d have more than 54 subscribers. And you’d be doing better than insulting a random guy on reddit because you can’t dare take any sort of criticism with crying and throwing a tantrum.
---
Yes I am,
---
Sorry 💀 if that was confusing
---
Yeah. But tbh they are used for a reason they are good. Except noed, I dont use that shit. I see 4 dead hards every game before rank reset where people make pallets they would never make. It sucks.
---
Killers can just slug you though. Dead hard just requires you to be close or by a loop to work.
---
I would assume so, he kinda messed with my data a little
---
The superior clock to use is the 24 hour clock. Never misunderstand what time of day Debbie from the office emailed you about again!
---
BHVR should listen to the community, this mother fucker will please the entity so bad!
---
The first perk sounds like a perk to use to run the killer into your teammates so you can stop being chased.
---
dude it’s not that fucking hard to understand. we’ve been over this. if you change or alter an image it is *editing* not stealing someone’s work. please get a grasp of reality. the point of editing is to change everything and use images that are NOT yours to make them special. i added my own lighting effects, added entire top half of the photo and used a filter THAT I made for ME. you’ve made zero points. show me the person i stole this from and i’ll be glad to think of you any more of an idiot.
---
Simple: killer changes -&gt; Circlejerk made by people that don't play the killer thinking they got nerfed -&gt; free karma -&gt; repeat until the next killer changes
---
Its not that rare, i often find myself giving master lessons to killer mains
---
My new favorite song is: 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What about a bitch of a Hag what a bitch of a Hag what a bitch of a Hag
---
ALL YOU DID WAS CROP THE IMAGE AND CHANGE THE SHADE YOU FUCKING MELON
---
No, despite the entity thriving off of torture and all that, it's in fact, the gamer's that are the true evil presence here 💀
---
Perk 1 seems like an interesting idea but I do think its a bit too strong, especially if all survivors can be seen. It would effectively make the other aura perks redundant unless a specific range was added.
---
Perk 2 would be broken. Having exhaustion recover while in chase would allow for exploitation of some of the Speed perks. There currently already exists a perk that makes status effect recovery faster called Vigil.
---
Perk 3 Seems interesting. Not strong but niche enough that it could be useful in some maps, similar to the Dance with Me + Lithe combo in trying to lose the killer. 
---
For the killer perks
---
I am assuming that its just one perk.
---
Survivors not in chase with you being 15 meters away from you screaming does not seem very useful since usually the killer has made LOS with a survivor at that range. 
---
Additionally, the 20% rng would make the perk worthless as its to inconsistent to be worth running.
---
Having a 120 second cooldown for a survivor to give out their location is a bit significant for the effect it actually gives.
---
The pallet vault idea would be horrible in that it would allow killers to bloodlust pallets easier without needing to break them. It would force survivors to take hits at any pallet if the killer refuses to break it. 
---
I give you props for being creative. 3rd perk is an interesting suggestion though.
---
Survivor with very basic looping skill* 
---
Oni is so bad
---
Monitor and abuse, one of the perks you’re running. A while back, they changed Myers to have the undetectable status in tier 1, meaning that you have 0 terror radius. That means that monitor and abuse is pretty much worthless on scratched mirror Myers since you will never leave tier 1. You should swap it for something else
---
STBFL was meh cmon now, the person you are chasing will go down in one hit if you did your job well with Frenzy, why does it matter you get to hook them a little bit sooner, the real good perk was Sloppy that lead to their best builds which where stall builds, but as we saw with forever Freddy getting axed, BHVR wants to shy away from such builds and i'm all for that, Legion should be a neck-break speed killer, not a stalling snore fest.
---
Get Leatherface, level him to get his perk BBQ &amp; Chili to rank 3 and to level 35 to teach it to other killers, and use any Bubba / Any Killer + Lvl 3 BBQ &amp; Chili every match. Remember to grab Survivor Puddings and Hollow Shells in bloodwebs as you level. Always try to do daily rituals and Tome challenges.  
---
Killers get more points in general because they're more difficult / frustrating to play. Level 3 BBQ &amp; Chili lets you earn x2 points every match if you hook all 4 survivors. There's some more depth to like what killers tend to score more points, how you perform, but that'll get you started. Someone already mentioned David and We're Going to Live (Farm) Forever. That's what you'll try to use for the survivor side of things. Harder to stack that perk though.
---
Thanks! Im gonna try it! :)
---
do you want a fucking process video? how dull do you have to be? it’s not that hard to put two brain cells together. overlay the original and my edited version and you’ll see. if you had an iq over 1.6 the differences would be extremely easy to see.
---
I said they are used every game. They were "complaining" in the other post about bbq, ruin, thanat,  and nurses calling. Read the title and you might not have to comment dumb shit.
---
Your criticism is dog shit. I have gone against the best killers in the game and done things you wish you could do. Blinky Bill, Swift, zubat, ryan pez. You did what? Pissed and moaned. I was red ranks before reset and most of those clips are recent so nice try 🤡
---
Instead of roar you just hear WAAAAAAAHHHHH
---
Idk why people expect killers/survivors to just use weak perks. Meta perks are meta for a reason. 
---
Also, I put NoEd in my list because whenever I criticize NoEd, there are staunch defenders who insult me and call me a survivor main even though I play both sides evenly.
---
Bro spirit is still dc city because good spirits didnt need to bump into you nor do they need a window if I want you dead as a spirit you'll be dead
---
That is a good possibility too, I’ll give you that. Who knows, really. 
---
I just want to play more Survivor games (in my main account) w my noobie friends and have a good time without bullying the killer.
---
Las time we face a GhostFace (rank 20) w Spirit Fury, Enduring, Nemesis &amp; Play w your food (all lvl 3). He was playing so dumb until we realized he was stalking us to one shot us w his nitro speed. It was a fun match.
---
Maybe survivor will not stun you by pallets then? Swinging like that actually slows down the killer, lol. And in this case, in rare instances when you are on top of the survivor, it they would receive a hit anyway and no pallet would really help...
---
love and hope?? are you a Friday the 13th Player???  Welcome to the Factory of Salt brother :)  enjoy
---
I play Legion sometimes, but I'm not good with him/her/them. I don't think I have the right perks on them to be successful.
---
I disagree; please continue.
---
Sorry for saying no miner, the autocorrect mad me do it.
---
I mean its mentioned on here in every ghostface thread but ok whatever. Keep downplaying it because you’re afraid they might one day fix your buggy killer
---
Lmfao exactly its fucking dumb. People complain about killers using ruin while they use dead hard and adrenaline religiously and vice versa. It's actually insane.
---
As someone who has about a grand total of 2 hours in Legion, I will now speak as the sole authority. /s
---
Nah seriously: they were nerfed in some ways and buffed in others; I think the nerfs hit harder than the buffs cuz of how many builds got ruined by said nerfs.
---
Survivors typically spawn near gens. Oni takes time to find the survivors.
---
Even excluding that, a survivor should be able to run a base m1 killer around for a minute and a half to 2 minutes in most maps. You should really be going down against a killer with no power in less than a minute and half.
---
Pre hotfix oni was definitely Billy level imo. As in he was around 3rd/4th best in the game but obviously not stronger than Nurse or Spirit (well spirit after they fix her current speed bug). He was strong but would struggle against extremely coordinated teams of competent survivors harder than those 2. 2-3 gens will pop before getting power.
---
You are right, he still has those tools. The issue is that he has a limit on using those tools that don’t really make up for it.
---
Take this scenario for example: he gets his power after hooking somebody, activates it and goes to chase a survivor on a gen. He still has to run the loop normally so it’s going to take a minute to actually get the down so the majority of his power is depleted right before getting the down. Keep in mind that the minimum charge to get the 1 shot is slower than an instant down from say Myers. He gets the down and little to no power is left due to down penalty that comes with power. The other survivor has already healed. At this point in the game, he’s just M1 killer again.
---
He doesn’t have anything to mitigate this and maximize the limited time that he has for power. It was flick.
---
Take Myers for example, he has to build the power up and everything but he’s still Myers. As in he can catch survivors out of position due to his small terror radius. Which allows him to walk up and instant down them and then get a good amount of pressure from their. His smaller terror radius in tier 2 also gives him a bit more of map presence than a standard m1 killer.
---
That’s the problem with Oni there. You will see I 10 feet tall red gorilla glowing brightly as he comes toward you on most maps. This gives the survivor ample time to position themself and have a good route. Which leads to the above scenario.
---
This leads to what his power actually is now: something that gives him significantly above average map pressure temporarily. However; what’s the point of the map pressure that you get if it’s going to inevitably lead to chase that will cost almost all of the power if you’re chasing a competent survivor?
---
That being said, against potatoes or reckless survivors, he’s still ridiculous. If he’s able to avoid the loop scenario since the survivors are out of position, then he’s basically old Oni lol.
---
I would call said perk “Tag, you’re it”
---
Says the guy being salty cause survivors want a chance to win
---
If you say so,
---
Do you know about the Nerf?
---
You can it’s in the settings
---
However,bitter murmur is a worse rancor but people still like bitter murmur.
---
Name should have been killed before sunrise
---
If you’re red ranks and bragging about “spinning” rank 20s, there’s something wrong with you.
---
That’s like beating up a toddler and calling yourself a boxer.
---
And if you’ve gotta game matchmaking to get yourself content, you may as well hire some paid actors to go up against...
---
Your content is shit. You’re evidently shit. And you’ll probably always be shit. Unless of course you get banned again.
---
Let me know when your subscriber count hits 60. I’ll celebrate with you... so at least someone will be there to care.
---
Theres only 4 options and they have 2 different things to do on each button.
---
But what about Papa Steve
---
I feel the same way, Turn off the chat option, that's all you can do for now
---
Explain, for i am the rank 16 noob you speak of
---
Tbh I'd just turn off the chat if your PC. If you're console turn off messaging from those who aren't friends.
---
Don't bring self care. Bring inner strength or a medkit. Or iron will. Or have teammates heal you.
---
When Devotion rewards come in you're gonna be rolling in the dough
---
Never knew they were the same input on console, that's interesting! They're different on PC even by default.
---
OP kept cancelling the heal and was crawling closer to pallet. Once OP cancelled the pallet causing the healer to start healing again it gave the prompt for the pallet instead. Entirely OPs fault IMO. Still funny doe.
---
Happens quite a bit. Get pallet stunned and it fixes it (not great but usually survivors will toss a pallet for you)
---
I agree.
---
if people tell you to kys they can get banend if you report them for that.
---
but getting upset at crouch spamming is kinda childish and nothing to act sad over, if chat bugs you so much turn the chat off, you wont see the messages from others then.
---
if you're over emotional then you either need to turn chat off or find yourself a different game, tbagging, gg ez, etc, has been in every single multiplayer game since i can remember, just keep playing to have fun and improve and turn the chat feature off.
---
getting upset at people saying noob or gg ez and tbagging is never gunna stop it's just a video game thing, good luck though.
---
I stay injured most of the game cause my teammates are garbage. I bring a medkit a lot but I want to use other items.
---
The entity not a female. The French language doesn't have "it" so it was automatically set to the feminine "la". How could a powerful entity have a human based gender lol? That is funny to me
---
It gets to me too and I've have 900 hours. I'm on console so I just try to block and report. There's no reasoning with those people... Believe me, I've tried. I just changed my name to Xbox to "ew ur mean" and I haven't got any salty or toxic messages since.
---
DS isn’t an anti-tunneling perk tho
---
Further proof we need The Thing in the game
---
It's good if you can get everyone injured, on it's own is not that good but with other perks like sloppy or you're playing legion, plague or a killer able to chain hits
---
Maybe survivors won't use one of the two resources they have to avoid the killer...genius idea.
---
Dead hard for me is hit or miss. Like the other exhaustion perks can build more distance but when you just need that extra bit of space for a pallet or window to get to a strong loop. Its amazing. I run dead hard and another perk occasionally. It doesnt feel too bad. Plus fun mind gaming killers using lithe one loop then dead hard the next.
---
You mean the killer's [insert any map here] offering that gets ignored for EVERY coldwind offering.
---
Michael Myers ain’t no Deadite or other hell demons the Necromicon can bring over. He may be evil personified, but it definitely doesn’t mean Ash could defeat Myers (or at least without extreme difficulty). To put it plainly, the Shape is unlike anything Ash has ever faced, whether that be in the trilogy or in the three seasons.
---
I hate how it just does sentences like this.
---
Claudette feels alone. She feels different. Different from the other kids. 
---
It’s like the backstory is better written than the Archives
---
It's not the same as other multiplayer games. If you play killer, you're one person with multiple people being dicks to you. Don't call him childish for not liking being tea bagged. It's unnecessary and just rude. He's not over-emotional either. Nobody likes being picked on and insulted when they're just trying to play a video game that they're new at.
---
Ruin is absolutely necessary. People need to stop complaining about it.
---
thatd be sweet. i just realized it's also friday the 13th by coincidence. or is it destiny
---
I never usually have a problem with it. I don’t think I’ve ever had i time where I was running self care injured and got down because it wouldn’t let me throw down the pallet. Nonetheless some support for button mapping would be amazing the fact that you’re just tied down to bumper jumpers or original is annoying.
---
It’s a hard knock life for us dbd console gamers. No dedicated servers, no button mapping, no moonwalking. What a shame.
---
Cool!
---
Especially if you're just swapping lockers somewhere. Without specific perks there's almost no way to find someone who just isn't doing anything.
---
If this is really how you feel, stop playing. Get help. It’s a fucking videogame. People have been assholes to each other playing video games since their inception. Quit.  Coming onto reddit and crying that your feelings are hurt over a fucking videogame is insane.
---
It makes it better.
---
That’s actually quicker than PC!  Thanks
---
Pretty fast during the day in the US for survivors, and at night it swaps and killer times become instant
---
Can't get over how sexy Oni-chan looks.
---
wouldnt it be awesome if all the licensed killers got blighted skins?
---
imagine getting upset at tbagging in a video game skskskskks??? like i play killer i have it done to me every other game, its all in good humour, they're probably gunna get downed anyways
---
That pink can be extremely good though honestly. Other than that though...ehhhhh
---
Nea Karllson
---
ok i main huntress so not that good for me
---
That’s really weird but cool to know. It’s the same way for me (NA xbox1). I’m glad dbd has a lot of support for most of their platforms, I’m surprised honestly.
---
Tbh the whole turning the chat off is as far as you can go, reporting people for saying "ez" or t-bagging won't do anything, but it's nothing to get upset about, i find myself with these kind of players every single time, i just type a gg and gtfo, doesn't matter how hard of a game said player had, if the escape, they will say ez (some even do that after dying in the first 2 minutes), the thing is, they are doing this to try and piss you off, and they expect a salty response from your end too, a gg often breaks the salty guy's mood, and hey, if you don't stay in the post-game chat long enough, you won't even see the end of it.
---
Switch to playing survivor. Not only will it get you put of thenslump but itneillnimprove your overall game
---
It's a slog till you can get decent perk loadouts and learn the game. Also see if you can find some people to hop in KYF with to learn without the pressure
---
how many hours?
---
BBQ is a perk that is actually two in one and doesn't even need to be. I would run it even if it didn't do anything just like I've WGLF as a mandatory perk on any survivor I have it on, however, WGLF isn't even a meta perk even though survivors have a worse grind than killers which leads me to believe that most people who state that they only run it because of bp are lying since the survivor version doesn't do anything besides bp and isn't as prevalent.  
---
I've always found gen speeds to be debatable. I've seen killers complain about gen speeds after 4Ks or on 15+ minute games like damn son what the hell more do you want?
---
Your Kate is a midget
---
Please note that I'm in the central portion of the U.S. so lobby times may differ.
---
It’s very good on killers like Legion and Plague who keep people injured. If you’re going to run it on any other killer I would recommend running sloppy butcher alongside it to help keep people injured.
---
How do you abuse the hook vacuum?
---
I think it’s a really neat idea. I mean I don’t think I could come up with a more clever killer and I honestly wouldn’t mind trying to play/play against this.
---
when his traps used to snap when u caught someone
---
I'm not trusting any statement of no more exclusive cosmetics what's the point of saying there's gonna be no more
---
Because in that hour survivors start playing swf and killers are scared of toxic swf after the nerf of nurse and spirit xd
---
Oh I mad misread the wiki then haha
---
What? He's a solid killer if you're not playing him for the literal first time. Not insanely powerful, but balanced, probably one of their best DLC's.
---
You act like killers don't shake and nod after downing survivors who weren't toxic at all.
---
Surprisingly, they were always large, but that's because they're a software developer that was part of a larger investment firm, and were essentially several companies merged into one under a communications corporation in the late 90s - in fact, over half a decade before DbD, they had enough investment capital to purchase a company from *Activision Blizzard*. And not just any company, they purchased the largest game studio in the history of South America at the time. They've always been AAA, it's just that many people had never heard of them because most of what they developed were licensed games for properties like The Grinch, Scooby-Doo, The Smurfs, Lizzie Maguire, etc., before eventually moving on to original IPs in the late 2000s like Wet and Naughty Bear
---
Another fun fact: according to Wikipedia, they had to change their name from Behaviour to A2M. Apparently, they changed it back as soon as legally possible because A2M is shorthand for 'ass-to-mouth'.
---
You dont ask that, is like asking why you are a stupid?
---
Better name- "the martyr "
---
“Me and Michael Myers are having a staring contest!”
---
I didnt mean use them all together you can use one of the three with second wind
---
Oh, it's all good haha
---
As a new PC player, this is confusing to me. I was told killer queues are very long because there are too many killers, and my experience so far has been very short survivor queues and very long killer queues. I have mostly played survivor for this reason. The killer queue has been 10+ minutes every time. Is this a rank-specific problem?
---
Damn guys I thought this was a light joke, I'm glad y'all took as serious as me XD
---
I'm still pissed on how contradictory they are, especially in how they've backpeddled about the Event cosmetics.
---
BHVR wants less toxicity. 
---
BHVR Still allows camping and tunnelling then wonders why players are angry with these scummy tactics.
---
It’s pretty toxic on both sides, but I typically get more of that from killers tbh
---
So true 😂
---
first piggy now mikey. You have good taste sir and or madame
---
Cleansing allows the _plag_ to get her super sick™ which can injure/down you if she hits you with it.
---
It’s lowkey worse imo when you don’t see him the entire game then go to basement to grab an item to leave with to be greeted by an insidious bubba who wrecks me an instant. All I wanted was a flashlight or something and bubba just bent me and my whole team over in a matter of seconds for it, guess I learned my lesson.
---
Freddy is fine and is fun to play as and againts
---
Because imagine stay on the ground for a bit to do nothing and finally get hook. Wow -rank point because u were in the dying stats for a bit to do nothing. So u can't get ur point. That my reason. But i never said u can be ban for this. I agree if i was the killer and get ban because i slug is not cool. My english skill is so bad,
---
There are toxic players in every type of game, and it shouldn't really hurt anyone because all they are trying to do is piss you off, ignoring them often results in them trying ever harder to get your attention, most of the times killing them. You really should just ignore these kind of people, they aren't worth the attention.
---
Certainly not killer sided these days
---
if they buff the cannibal i'm uninstalling
---
Uh oh... so if im devotion level 4 what does that mean lol. I have a life i swear.
---
I think for most there comes a point where the constant camping and tunnelling and BM from Killers forces them to become toxic. When they finally get into a game where a Killer plays fair they take the opportunity to give it back and are toxic for all the shit they put up with.
---
There's no way this is PC, I wouldn't believe it, Nurse, Spirit, and Billy would all be higher, same with huntress.
---
Claudette
---
Man on console too goddamn, true gamer.
---
High-Ranks have a good ratio of Killers to survivors, yes. As you drop in ranks, you’ll find far fewer killers, leading to slow survivor queues.
---
Around Rank 14 is where you can expect to notice the shift.
---
Of course, time when you play, region, and platform changes this slightly, but the pattern is there.
---
If you want to watch a dbd youtuber/streamer who is actually respectful watch Otz

Take a break.

Hope you continue to enjoy it
---
Is vaulting a different map than repairing gens? Because I keep grabbing gens next to windows and pallets.
---
Theres also a teachable perk for Bill called Left Behind it shows you the aura of the hatch when you are the last person alive
---
There are a few specific instances of Jason that aren't. I remember there was a time when people said we wouldn't have a clown either.
---
So chill.
---
Ok, so you’re new and you’re upset that people are talking shit? Don’t be. Firstly, it’s a game. Secondly, they’re just assholes. You’re letting them truly win if you get bent out of shape over their trash talk. DBD is competitive. Every competition in history has sore losers, sore winners, angry people, and someone who’s inherently better at something than you. It’s ok. Just play the game how you want. You don’t just start off being a good killer, it takes a lot of practice. You have to learn how to hunt the survivors, their behavior, their perks, your perks, how to utilize your killer the best, etc. literally just practice. Then when you’ve sacrificed 2/4 of them, the trash talk of the other 2 won’t mean shit because you still made them pay! I play survivor, when I first started I was absolutely terrible. I’d freak out when I was getting chased, got way too into it, died every game. Then I just remembered the killer is deadass some other person out there just trying to win a game. Took the horror out of it, and now I can break ankles and not even worry about it. But I had to utilize my perks, understand the killer, and adopt a stealth play style to minimize my time in the killers view so when I did get chased, it was infrequent. I’m generally the last person alive on my team now and I escape quite often. But again, that took me months to get to that level. You too can get good at DBD, just practice. I’d recommend watching Pain Reliever on YT. His vids really helped me, and I’m a better player for it. Don’t give up!
---
Makes sense why I don’t ever get rescued, my team mates forgot to bring a watch!
---
You just have no class
---
[*Lookit this anime opening!*](https://youtu.be/tF4faMbs5oQ)
---
At least the dead hard through a hatchet is the game actually working as intended
---
It goes both ways, Toxic people create other toxic people in a chain reaction, theres no stopping it
---
ikr, he’s *clearly* op and needs to be nerfed
---
Not all Killers have been taken unwillingly, Spirit, Michael himself and Clown are a few who come to mind.
---
I fucking hate that shit. There’s so many of them too
---
Yeah wouldn’t use on huntress but other killers may be good
---

For real. The stories aren't bad but the voice acting. Oof. Terrible.
---
Can i ask what movie or tv series is that scene from? :O
---
Survivors don't run WGLF because the blood point bonus isn't very big, and the way you get stacks sucks. Best believe that if it was easier to stack every survivor would run it. Stop being a donkey.
---
Everyone talking about Jane, but no one has said a thing about claudette sounding like shes just been stuffed when she's picked up.

Ahh? Ooohhhh....♡

You can report on console directly to Sony for spam and hate speech. ;)

They get little bans here and there. Only reason I keep my messages open.

A mere 32m near the hook on a map 64m wide

**TUNNEL MODE ACTIVATED**
---
Wait that's what the flick is? I was always under the impression the flick was about the spike in sensitivity at the end.
---
I'm pretty sure Billy also has the flick, so I see no reason Oni shouldn't
---
You could always play Stardew Valley instead. :)
---
While giving killers ways to bypass survivor perks making camping more effective
---
He was pretty strong, flicking and one hit downing someone and then running across the map to down another person made him an even better Billy since charging his skill was so easy. Streamers who play the game everyday were agreeing that he was OP.
---
I hear you, but don't worry it's an easy mistake to make! And thank you for the award!
---
That’s a great way to put it haha! Murder tag
---
Turn off chat, I’m a pretty emotional dude I think too and it bothers me people just can’t take the beating and shit up so I have my setting very private but I’m also on Xbox so I don’t have after game chat; I honestly think this is a horrible idea anyways what do they think killers will thank the survivor for looping them or survivors will thank killers for killing them? no. Try not to think of it as a you problem because it’s not I feel bad for most of the people that go out of their way to message me when I play fairly, because there is obviously bigger issues they have to deal with. Hope I helped and I hope you don’t stop playing!
---
I only play on PC so i didn't know about that one, thanks for the correction.
---
Am I the only one who actually cleanses dull totems anytime I see them? They give a good chunk of boldness bp and it reduces the risk of NOED at endgame assuming other teammates are doing the same? I stand by this reasoning as it has helped me get to rank 1 with the added bp in games where I am gen crushing anyways.
---
I find it funny that this problem inverted itself. It used to be that killers had to wait for sometimes nearly an hour for a match. 
---
I've stopped actively playing because of toxic survivors at higher ranks to be honest. It's too much of a one-sided battle when the survivors know what they're doing to the point you just can't play the vast majority of killers.
---
There's still a lot of loops where if you chase the survivor, you will lose the entire game, and when you get unlucky and get 4 survivors at rank 1 that just.. instantly run to these loops when they see you, you literally just lose, if you don't play nurse, or spirit to bypass some of the looping mechanics.
---
Everything is VERY survivor-sided at high rank. Yes, there are survivors at rank 1 that don't try-hard, and a lot more that are genuinely catch-able, but when the survivor's are good, there's not a counter as killer. You just have your time wasted, and have a horrible game.
---
Wait is resil not meta??? It absolutely is if you ask me. I get at least 1 or two every game

How do i get the link for pc?

Interesting.

This is great. By chance, you think you could make one in 1440p. If not it’s all good

Idk
---
Nice bait
---
Reminds me of r/Arabfunny
---
Oh my god, this hurts my eyes.
---
Please do not listen to anybody’s list on best killers or weak perks etc.
---
It all comes down to personal preference and the way you play them. I’ve gotten too many 4k’s with legion to count and idk how many times I’ve seen someone saying he’s one of the weakest killers. 
---
If I knew this I wouldn’t of bought killers I didn’t like, because even if they’re strong doesn’t necessarily mean they’re fun to play with.
---
Wow Huntress is sooo low. She’s like once every 3rd game for me
---
I don't blame you if you don't believe me, I don't really know how he acts on stream, but I tried to find clips of his behavior on his stream and they weren't there when I went to report him and he wasn't currently streaming. So he either does it off the cameras or it was a one time thing or whatever. It was like at least a year ago though when I was newer, so perhaps he's changed a bit.
---
how is your mom relevant
---
And here we have the required “1v1 me on Rust,” only updated for the younger, dumber crowd. You’ve got nothing to be proud of in real life, so you gotta brag about video games, right?

It’s no wonder you play Fortnight. You’ve got the mentality of a 12 year old, so I’m sure that matches your audience.
---
All 54 of them.
---
Or have you been banned in that game too?

Mettle of Man

DS is almost just an extra health state when used properly. You can use it to avoid getting hit when missing a loop or being tricked into vaulting, you dodge through hatchets, can make Legions FF end, cause Nurses to miss a blink, Spirits to miss a lunge, dodge a chainsaw/kanabo hit or m1s while exposed
---
It’s not like missed attack cool downs are crippling so it’s not insane but survivors best tools (BT, Dead Hard etc) are basically mulligans.
---
i mean borrowed time is basically just the dude unhooking you shooting you up with adrenaline. people have been known to have super human endurance, strength, etc. due to adrenaline that would seem magical
---
i bet you feel ridiculous now...
---
He doesn't even use a chainsaw...
---
to a degree, the advice to turn off chat and grow a thicker skin is valid. it's certainly less common than it used to be, but people like that are always going to be around and there's shit all anyone can really do about it.
---
i hate saying that though, because it sucks. i've always been a sensitive person, it's something i've had to work on and every now and then it does still get to me. it sucks to just want to have fun and get mocked and/or insulted for it
---
so yeah, basically what i'm saying is that you do need to work on shrugging stuff off, but please don't think there's nobody who empathises or wants to play with you because there are. it's just that the assholes are louder and pushier.
---
If there's one thing most survivors hate more than using stealth is doing gens so I've no idea where you get that from. I play solo and do at least 2.5 gens on my own since to everyone else a hook is a message from god telling them to drop everything and go on a quest immediately. From my experience most people would rather go for the save than do gens.
---
I hate that they only made certain streamers get to try the game. Like what's the point of having beta if not many players could get to try on it
---
Please at least use pngs... 
---
 Good, and good effort, but it hurts to look at :(
---
Are you a furry?
---
I got Oni.
---
When Claudette and Bill have to heal in a dark corner..
---
I mean what are the bisexual? "Enter and exit?"
---
I’d switch noed out for literally anything but just a suggestion not gonna tell you how to play, have fun:)
---
I don't know if its off meta, but I fucking love Kindred. The change has made it such a godsend playing solo.
---
Killer side, I'm thoroughly enjoying Blood Echo in my Legion and Plague builds. I've had a few survivors run directly at me to dead hard after it procs, forgetting that they can't. Its been hilarious.
---
Wait you don’t? I thought straight people had sex and children just appeared!
---
He clearly needs some buff as the reason why he is played is only his perks (not for me, I love him because of his movies). Maybe reduce the chainsaw speed loss a bit while he charges it (without addons) because imo the problem is his lack of mobility and easily being looped
---
It adds four seconds for one survivor to heal another survivor (without any perks or items), but since it's a percentage, it adds 8 seconds to a survivor self caring without any items. 
---
As for how much time that adds, it depends. If you hook everyone twice and they get healed up to full each time by one other person, again assuming no perks or items, that's 32 seconds, or the equivalent of having to heal two more health states. If in this scenario they all self care, you're at 64 seconds, which is a huge amount of time spent doing something besides gens.
---
The other comparison to make is how much time other perks waste/save. Enduring is a super popular killer perk that saves you a second at a pallet stun, so you'd have to get hit by 32 pallets in a game to equate the time that healing 8 health states would be increased by Sloppy. Now, obviously the benefit of Enduring is not the total time saved but the time in specific chases, but the same can be said about Sloppy as well, as it means four more seconds of two survivors standing in place (or eight seconds of one survivor).
---
Although I had already finished this challenge awhile ago, I did have a recent game on Hawkin's Laboratory (I put the offering) using Spine Chill and was chased for like 3 gens and the killer left 3 different chases after he realized I was able to play unsafe and semi-safe pallets very well and I avoided being downed.
---
Pop goes the weasel, I think that's on the shrine of secrets now if you got the iridescents for it.
---
"Dear I knew you would be in the salt farming business like me."

Where have you been all my life friend. You are the only one I have seen who agrees with me. The think should be the next killer and the survivors should be macready and childs.

Just a heads up you can run rancor for that exact reason. You can insta kill that person if the exit gates are open if they continue to be toxic. Im glad you often give hatch too I like to reward the nice ones.
---
Lmaoo. This why I like the doctor...a gen can be 90% done and all it takes is you Overcharging it and let them fail the check them just come back to it and overcharge it again...by the 3rd time you patrol it, its already back to 20%. LMAOOO

meanwhile survivors be like: adrenaline, borrowed time, decisive strike, self-care

what are these cosmetics? smurfs?

Just curious if there’s any actual hard proof, like a video or something out there?

Heard Kate’s original voice actor was so annoying they changed it. I didn’t think it would be too bad, then I looked up the video. Yeah...I get why it was changed lmao. Also that’s the reason I don’t play Jeff or Jake. They’re soooo loud.

I mean, there's no way she *could* kill him. Kazan could probably rip a dude's jaw apart with those massive hands of his.

Buy Legion just to get tons of points.

I have no Idea what someone would disagree with you

You again? See you before..
---
Ah found the 7 year old
---
What? Did someone say nerf legion again? You got it!
---
Would you rather run from an M1 killer while injured, or run from SuperPlague^^tm while being injured after getting hit 2 seconds into the chase?
---
I’ve seen posts where people have argued why leaving makes sense
---
If only the rights to him weren’t a clusterf—k right now. Especially disappointing since it’s the first movie’s screen writer holding it hostage in litigation and Jason isn’t even in it except as a kid. Hockey mask Jason wasn’t even until the 3rd movie either.
---
What even happened here?
---
God please don't
---
Jason has never used a chainsaw ever
---
Some sort of infinite loop glitch.
---
It’s still bad and only effective against bad survivors.
---
I tell you what I have observed. You are the definition of a reddit troll, so don't talk like your life is something special. Reading your posts is actually funny as heck. You literally are a clown. You think you understand balance of DBD? I've been playing since one month after launch. Anything you think you understand about this game, you don't and I understand it better because I am better than you. I mean what kinda person sits on reddit and critiques threads all day long and can't back shit up other than just shitpost respond? If you are so good, show me how its done. Oh yeah, you can't. Your computer probably can't even render a video. Your stream is probably lackluster enough to have people rather watch paint dry than your immersed ass. But hey, you understand DBD balance better than anyone right? you've proven your skills right? all I see is a keyboard warrior.

Every single killer in the opener is someone known and some of the best. Now suck my fucking cock while taking a shit you reject loser ass clown.
---
"Fishes"
---
I'd say you should enjoy the game and have fun, if you like wraith, stick to him, use some builds to get the best potential out of the character and ignore the salty idiots that you'll run into, and if you don't want to use meta builds, make your own and have fun with that.
---
It's a map that favours immersed gameplay and some people don't like that...

Bruce Campbell voices Ash but I think the rest are devs/people who work for BHVR

"Ah yaasss, umm hmm"

"there was 0 skilled involved" this dude..

There is aim and range involved, not some damn 'teleport to nearest survivor' perk.
---
ah very cool, good job on the work!
---
Great. The first Hillbilly perk that isn't a racist joke and only the 3 people playing mobile will get it.
---
@thehag
---
I respectfully disagree with your opinion of reset being detrimental, and do still feel like it, to some degree, rebalances people out who truly need the derank. 
---
But I am absolutely on the same page in that the entire emblem system is flawed as a whole. The way it is set up, most people will rank up just from time played. I also agree that rank rewards are long overdue. Hopefully these are all things they still plan to address early in 2020, per the roadmap for Year 4.
---
It's coming soon.  I'm not letting go.
---
Is it?  It’s a VIDEOGAME!!  A game!!!!!!!  Get past this??? Get past what?!! People being mean??  It’s a fact of life!!!!  People are assholes!  If you can’t deal with a videogame hurting your feelings then I’m sorry but you have waaaaayy more issues then random people on the internet cannot help.   See a therapist.  I’m sorry I’m not holding this kids hand telling him it’s gonna be ok.  The fact that he posted it online for the world to see his precious feelings are hurt over a fucking videogame shows me hes got way more issues then dealing with “mean bullies” on a fucking digital platform. Stop playing. Boom problem solved. Move on.
---
I don’t even understand where this new “cleanse anytime you can!” strat is coming from shit is completely bogus. Even if you cleanse you all get sick again anyways right after AND she gets her machine gun vomit. Just don’t cleanse, learn how to loop people while injured it works the exact same almost
---
What about Identity V voice actors?
---
Can I have your blood web I would kill to constantly get rainbow maps. Fucking love me some rainbow maps
---
By far highest skill cap killer in the game —&gt; no skill required. God bet this guy couldnt 1k with nurse after 20 games
---
Nurse? Legion?
---
Self care let’s you heal by yourself, the other is a medkit addon that’s ultra rare
---
Turn chat off, trust me. 
---
Honestly, if someones playing toxic then you have every right to be toxic back to them, don't put up with that BS. Tunnel them, facecamp them, get them out of the match and then start playing fair with the remaining survivors.
---
In every single other online multiplayer game I have played, there’s a penalty for dc’ing. I don’t understand why this game hasn’t implemented a similar penalty yet nor why people argue against it. Dc’ing ruins the game for the other 4 players
---
I understand sometimes you have to dc for other reasons, but 19/20 times someone dc’s is because they are salty and losing
---
Can’t tell you how many times I’ve tried healing and accidentally vaulted over a window, or thrown a pallet down 😂
---
i s2g bloody party streamers and chewed pens are the RAREST thing in this game
---
I love Adam. I prestiged him right after Jake.
---
Meanwhile my solo que random teammates are running: Urban evasion, premonition, slippery meat, and no mither
---
I personally think she's overeating. Like the dude's just having a joke and having some fun.
---
I agree, thought it was a bit unfair that the killer had to DC even tho the survivor was the one who was stuck
---
I thought it said “Sole Survivor“ and I was like damn he has 2000 hours with the perk, that‘s dedication and expected an in-depth perk review. Then I was confused and looked closely. I think I should go to sleep now.
---
Lol i should too
---
On console? On console vaulting, repairing, skill checks, throwing pallets, and healing are all the same button.
---
the only time a chainsaw and jason have been in the same room is part 2 where he got attacked with one
---
You keep up at it...  Talking about how much better you are than the random person on the internet. You and your 54 subscribers must be so proud.
---
You see, I’m not the one putting my shit out there for everyone to see, then throwing childish tantrums when called out for it.
---
I’m not the one bothered by the sad, little boy with 54 subscribers being upset. You keep throwing your little tantrum because your little YouTube channel is shit and you have to face against rank 20s to feel good about yourself.
---
Maybe mommy and daddy will come love you again if you get 100 subscribers. Won’t that be special? Yes it will! You’ll be so happy when that happens. Yes you will!
---
Keep getting pissed. Your subscriber count is sure to go up if you insult everyone in the thread you made to promote your channel.
---
Wouldn’t a big enough youtuber have a following that would come in here and start defending them? Did no one respond to your twitter post either?
---
YESSSS QUEEENN SLAAAYYYYY!!!!!
---
How was it before and what do you think changed?
---
...do you *honestly* think I care about having "negative karma"?  Say one thing someone doesn't agree with and they get pissy and dislike it. I am a grown woman I can care less and your comment was very whiney, sorry.
---
Which had no relaton to BL?
---
IMO the meta survivor perk pool is much larger than the killer one but that's not the players' faults
---
Hey didn’t have none of those perks.
---
Bubba didn’t read The Survivor’s Rulebook for Killers
---
I like the second option. I feel that makes perfect sense as it would be the Survivor version of BBQ.
---
BBQ was in the shrine like 3 times since Bubba‘s launch and his other perks are also pretty neat. Franklin‘s is great against Flashlight/Toolbox bois and Knock Out is the best perk for slugging builds. Also he costs like what 3 dollars? Definitely get him. He is also pretty fun to play especially with PWYF.
---
I always go for getting healed by others but in some situations I need to do it. I'm not that brain dead, and gens are before heals anyway but still.
---
Lmfao facts.
---
Sarah scribbles are always funny no matter the context
---
She’s definitely the highest skill cap but anyone who says “aim” is a factor is wrong lmao. Nurse has built in auto aim. Once you get distance down it’s gg
---
So instead of like you know growing a pair and proving you remotely understand how to DBD you insult my channel? and lets be real, my jukes/videos are good enough to pop off at any second. You on the other hand talk like you know it all but as far as we know you truly are a rank 20 survivor/killer. You can't even talk about the game, I on the other hand can say what I want. I got the clips clown.
---
You just called Ryanpez rank 20, marth, swiftlegend, zubat all the goats that I literally just linked a video to you of. 4Head. I could do big circles on you all day.
---
I think the hate comes from people having a picture in their head of how they thought he should look. People also get mad that Laurie looks different
---
That said? I am sure the dev Quentin is based off of is quite handsome; we all know the facial models can be a little wonky and aren't doing anyone any real favors. If they can do a facial retool on everyone I think we could appreciate him more
---
Play as survivor. Imo it’s a lot easier to learn how to play survivor. You’ll still face toxic players, but at least you have 3 other ppl helping you out rather than 3 ppl being an ass to you. Plus as survivors, you don’t have to learn a power and you don’t necessarily have to have a specific build as a survivor. As killer, builds are more important because they need to fit your killer’s power. It’s just something to think about. It’ll still make you question why you play the game, but it’ll be easier to learn
---
Your second point makes the most sense lol
---
It was actually a png but was run through so much shit it looks bad. Thank you bro I'll try better.
---
stop crawling during a heal and it wouldn’t happen
---
True
---
I honestly don't think she'd like him. She was killed by a crazy family member, and Kazan is like King Crazy of Crazy City.
---
Please use self care more. It makes playing killer so much easier
---
One day, maybe, you’ll get that 4K
---
It’s like you didn’t even read my comment
---
they got some balls doing the tango while being tortured
---
Every time I say this I get downvoted into oblivion, but there needs to be a penalty for dodging lobbies when the ping doesnt exceed a certain threshold. Any game with a ranking system shouldn't encourage players to be selective with their opponents and say "oh prestige skins, these guys are probably good. See ya!!" Fuck that. And queue times are horrible and endless dodging just makes people wanna quit the game because it's just a fucking lobby simulator at that point.
---
As a Freddy Main, I’m ok with the nerf. However, the nerf to Oni was totally uncalled for. Most people were ok with how Oni was. Now he’s totally useless
---
With her Chinese accent, it would probably sound like this:
---
*ahem*
---
**NEEGAAA**
---
Yeah u/I_Fap_To_Murder has a point
---
I'm pretty sure if you are the kind of guy willing to kidnap and experiment on people, you'll do the same for some teenagers you find. Legion may be a teenaged gang, but they are leather wearing psychos with masks and knives, I highly doubt Vigo has much empathy for them.
---
My solution to moris and keys:
---
You can’t mori the survivors until **everybody** had been hooked once.
---
When a survivor uses a key to unlock the hatch, the hatch immediately closes after they escape.
---
obviously a meme but i cant help it...  
---
that dude HAS to be joking with that picture...looks fancy, but anyone who gets behind a microphone knows that is the worst staged pic ever
---
gonna watch the shining tonight tho, thanks
---
It's like you didnt even read the post. Just stop lol you're making yourself look bad.
---
Lmao who even says that

I don’t play killer, but those cosmetics make me want to.
---
One of them was the biggest menace of the game for a while and the other was fucking GOD TIER if you knew how to use him around Flesh and Mud, so maybe they got some Tony Montana balls
---
The header on the banner says 2019, but the graphic and dates are from last year. 
---
That said, they took the time to put it back in the files with the new 2019 label, so maybe it’s just serving as a placeholder for one that we’ll get next week, hopefully.
---
Aces arthritis was flaring up

Oh boo hoo no it’s not stop making up bs to fit your silly agenda.

Dedicated servers are on PC at the moment and they aren’t great.

You can see the ping before you start playing though.

One of the best feeling you can in this game

Ay didnt even notice thank you!
---
Strangely, bitter murmur. Gens will always go no matter what you do so the info helps especially with end game builds using NOED or rancor to find the last survivors
---
No problem
---
Myers kills teenagers not seasoned demon slayers. Ash would totally win
---
C'mon on the record, call TSL, Blinky, Zubat, Pez all rank 20 again mk cupcake. C L O W N.
---
The poster's name is racist how? Shouldn't you be downvoting him or reporting him?
---
this
---
i, for the longest time, refused to play killer just because of how scared i was (and still am tbh) of getting bullied and some cocky people since that stuff gets to me real easily, im better at actually playing killer now, but i still get that little nervous rush when i first load up dbd because i dont wanna get bullied. so yeah, you just have to work on it, i've been working on it for over 1.5k hours and it still gets to me a fair bit.
---
survivor main *intensifies*
---
I signed up if these are exclusives forever (Which I doubt) I would be depressed
---
From the way she talks it sounds like he's the kind of guy who does wacky stuff like this. And I'm jealous. I wish he was my father.
---
Myers doesn’t get the opportunity to kill seasoned demon slayers. He’s restricted to the suburbs in Illinois, not many demon slayers there. And, as proven many times in his 11 movies so far, he’ll kill anyone, not just teenagers. 
---
Also, what you’ve got to remember is that Myers is not the kind of evil Ash generally fights. Take that big bastard at the end of Season 3 to ‘test the mettle of man’- Ash has to kill it with the Kandarian Dagger. Myers is completely unstoppable, that’s his whole point. He is a force of nature that never stops- the dagger would do little to him, even in the hands of the Jefe, let’s be honest.
---
"Who is that? I think i see him but...he's.....he's just staring at me"
---
The good old phrase: "get over it", every game has their own toxic bunch of idiots, but the thing about DBD that is weird to me is why so many small things are considered toxic, DS and BT are perks that COUNTER a tunneling/camping killer (which IS toxic, since you're not making the game enjoyable for that one survivor), NOED is a perk that helps the killer to maybe score some kills during the endgame, i consider it to be cheap, not toxic. Flashlights help the survivor and his teammates to evade/escape the killer, which is their objective, they're just using a tool to make it easier (like NOED, i find items to be cheap ways to help you). Lots of things in DBD that help you and hinder your enemy are considered toxic, but in other games that isn't the case, and really can't find an answer to why that is, maybe the community got used to calling certain things toxic, when in reality they aren't, or they got the wrong concept of what something toxic really is... i dunno.
---
Stopped using DS and started using Iron Will instead. IW is so underrated
---
I agree but on the other hand its not fun playing against toxic swf. I'm not condoning facecamps but good god its frustrating when the survivors are the power role.
---
WHAT LOL. My post is completely unedited and it would say otherwise if I did. You're honestly a dumbass!
---
Didn't the rights to ANOES also go back to the Wes Craven Estate? The devs could probably do stuff like give Freddy and Quentin cosmetics now if they just asked.
---
He does feel better. Survivors do not know what to do when broken
---
Ayy fellow Raptors fan!
---
These survivors are A-holes I wish I was here because I would've helped you
---
Bond all the way! I can't play without it anymore. Most of the time you know where the Survivors **and** the Killer are.
---
My teammates at purple/red ranks still did this 😤😭
---
lol wut, no they're not. 
---
Wraith isn't terrible, but Legion sucks more ass than people at a gay beach party. Seriously, they need an absolute freddy-style rework. People might like them now, and that's fine, but the fact is that they're still utter shit.
---
[deleted]
---
I would love to have IT in the game. Who would be the survivor? My vote is for Eddie Kaspbrak. He's not dead, the Entity just took him!
---
I mean as the in-universe character. The actress certainly is cute.

Last I read only Scream officially did so far and ANOES was still being debated because New Line Cinema produces it while Weinstein Bros produced Scream. It might have changed since I last researched it.
---
Stunning and brave
---
OG Wraith was the weakest out of the original 3 and to properly get 4ks it required decent skill. Same goes for modern Legion. You kinda explained the point of this mate.
---
He comes off as a very decent person on stream
---
You usually cant farm a 4 man group, you basically have to win the game, leave 2 survivors alive, ?????? And then Profit.
---
I got Badham 6 games in a row the other day, tragic.
---
Because Pennywise is a cosmic deity and likely what inspired the entity to begin with.
---
They may have Tony Montana balls, but the Entity is Tony Montana himself
---
i have turned around while being chased, started revealing ghost, but turned back around to focus on running...and it keeps revealing him even tho I'm no longer even facing him
---
I think so. Personally I think he’s one of the most fun killers to play in the game.
---
\[cries in quentin\]
---
Yeah it feels super unfair. I played a lot of killer now I'm playing a lot of survivor and I feel the killers pain, it sucks having a gen be done before at least 1 hook. The couple times I really dedicated myself to unbreakable it was literally game saving almost every time.
---
[Cries in Leatherface]
---
Agreed! Adam is my favorite character and he has so few cosmetics
---
I was also born on a friday the 13th. I love seeing superstitions people's reactions
---
If there’s ever a reason to back out that’s the biggest one for both sides.
---
She probably got stuck behind a car on a bridge
---
Honestly I only use it to guess how many survivors are trying to save the one I just hooked
---
Yeah I can see how that can be annoying. It just sucks going up against toxic killers when you’re a solo survivor because you can’t communicate with anyone very well. Pretty much anything sets killers off. A Freddy camped everyone in a match I played the other day because nobody answered his farm requests. And in another match I played I was tunneled endlessly by a Billy from the start of the match for no reason, and I was a Dwight and not try harding at all. I just think it’s dumb that killers tunnel me or camp me because they couldn’t catch me in the first 30 seconds of a chase.
---
Wow. 
---
You are fourteen kinds of toxic. Why don't you say something productive instead of blowing up at someone for being upset over dickweed players.
---
based feng
---
lmao i do this when im not playing with my friends to save my ass
---
Get help, dude. You got a problem.
---
I mean. You're the one that literally put "Rank 20" in your video. I just repeated what you said.
---
But go on... Keep being so rattled that you brought the conversation out to another thread that was a day old and has nothing to do with you.
---
Red ranks is full of tryhards as much as it is people who don't belong there, but got carried by SWF.
---
Best way to play nurse on console is to set your sensitivity to 100 and snort coke
---
his mori would be to pull out his massive green cock and beat survivors to death with it
---
My 2 fav games
---
Hahaha noob rank 20s make a call out but ITS REALLY THE OPPOSITE LOL HAHA NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE
---
*fear*
---
Now imagine doing this with empathy instead
---
100 percent agree and honestly if I can get my friends into this game, I'll just play custom games with them.
---
Ah good to see another intellectual
---
I lost a survivor rank to the colour before that just bwfore the reset happened, needless to say that i am a pissed rank 17
---
Toxic friend groups and bad manners are a problem but I don't see an issue with flashlights, Borrowed Time and DS. Flashlights are a good mean to protect yourself and there's a perk two perks to counter them to either knock them off of the Survivors or be resistant to them. Borrowed Time and DS discourage tunnelling. I use DS when I'm really not in the mood to deal with tunnel Killers. NOED is fine because it's a hex perk and it's possible to stop it ever activating. Cleanse every dull totem you come across f you're concerned about NOED. I made a habit of it, just doing away with any totems cross my path. There's a perk that helps with finding them if you actively want to prevent NOED and there's maps as well so it's not exactly unfair. Camping, tunnelling, and toxic behaviours are the real issues because either you're miserable as a Killer dealing with twats or you're mad as a Survivor because the Killer is rendering you unable to play do anything at all.
---
Get used to cutting corners tight when the Killer is after you. Makes surviving a bit easier if they hit the walls. Also make sure you don't pull the pallets early, try to wait for the killer to at least have their red light on you.
---
Dammit, alright. I’ll take notes
---
it's so funny to me how to license holders for Saw were SOOOO into the idea of cosmetics to the point where they're releasing outfits the character(s) never wore in the movie
---
then there's the Nightmare on Elm Street holders who don't like free money I guess
---
Killers are penalized when using moris, even more if they camp, tunnel and wait for ds like you said, there is no way to pip by doing this, you might even depip. If we consider that piping is winning, then using moris straight up make you lose the game.
---
I don't think 99% of killers use moris because they want to have an easier time winning, from my experience most of them do to be toxic towards swf, streamers or whatever because it's fun, and to see the cool animations.
---
Keys however have no penalties, they give you free escape and probably a pip. That's way more bullshit.
---
I don't mind keys or moris cause even if it's annoying, it happens very rarely and losing a pip isn't a big deal at all once you played the game enough. We are far from spirit, old legion, old MoM etc, omnipresent things that ruined the game as a whole and would make people not touch the game at all
---
Okay cool, thought I was out of the loop on something
---
It's just impossible. Also the Switch has a lovely bug atm where you don't have that blurred vision, and you just pop over to your blink. You can't hit what you can see, or judge the distance of.
---
I had the worst match earlier where I ran Unbreakable against an Oni and he literally would slug anyone besides me for no reason. He had no reason to believe I had Unbreakable. It was on the Game map and it sucked so much. I got 3-4 gens done upstairs with prove thyself and couldn’t find anymore. Oni basically refused to leave the bottom floor and it was so hard to get any gen done without running into him. Even worse I found the hatch and the other guy was injured and I think about to die on hook but the killer found me and hooked me immediately. So I didn’t get to get to use Unbreakable against a killer that is typically a slugging killer. But I have gotten a few good games in with Unbreakable where it literally saved my life.
---
Exactly. They're weak as shit. They don't have to be op, but they shouldn't be absolute pieces of garbage either. "YoU kInDa EpLaInEd ThE pOiNt Of ThIs" my ass.
---
It’s couldn’t care less*, just to educate you. 
---
It’s the same amount of time to separate my comments rather than putting them together. So think a little harder before you speak.  
---
You clearly haven’t played this game as long as I have/long at all or you’re on PC. Because you wouldn’t be saying what you did if you experienced this. 
---
It’s called feedback, and the DEVS need to see it to see how people feel about their game and hopefully try to figure out a solution. 
---
And as a grown woman myself, you can have an opinion all you want. I’m not taking that from you. But as a MATURE grown ass woman, I know to not make a reddit account just to be negative with every comment I post. And I sure as hell think before I speak. 
---
You came here with some idiotic comment and acted like I’m not going to say something or defend it. I had plenty of people disagree with me and did I get offended? No. But you decided to approach me very negatively and the funny part is, it didn’t make sense!  “Entitled survivor” =/= Long queue times. Do you honestly know how to read? Or are you that bored  and hurt that you wanted to come on whatever post and let your insecurities show? I got time right now so if you wanna back up your argument then by all means, I’m here to listen. Make it make sense!
---
That implies anyone still plays f13
---
Uh, if only this is true I'd be killing survivors in style using my WW1 Nurse outfit.
---
You post virgin vs Chad memes.. you have literally no credibility here lol
---
Custom sounds very fun honestly. So you deal with less anger. I played SWF with some ppl I met on DBD and this one guy kept getting so unnecessarily angry. Was really annoying
---
This shitpost isn't for arguing if Legion truly is actual shit or not. It's saying "hey, you can still be Ted Bundy with even the worst killer in the game."
---
Okay i switched from main Dwight to Nea
---
Now how do i use the mori?
---
i bet you thought pre-nerf legion was balanced.
---
It's not at all. I'm on console and I hit ruin skill checks consistently.
---
But but tumblr tells me that Myers want to fuck all the male survivors (and killers too, that slut!!).
---
Otzdarva already did a video on it with that, that's what the guy was alluding too.
---
D E A D A S S 
---
Probably because they want a way to revive the franchise and get it back up for the eventual sequel to Jigsaw (which I think is still in production?)
---
I miss the Halloween gens :’(
---
pop goes the weasel is in the shrine rn btw...
---
Mmmmmm mmmm good! Lol
---
Feral Frenzy used to be able to stack Save The Best For Last and Sloppy Butcher, among other perks. Since the most recent patch that’s no longer possible. Deep Wound was also changed this way due to the Oni’s “Nemesis” perk, which effectively brought back old legion.
---
So basically it's an argument for whether Legion is actual shit or not, as Ted Bundy got 30 confirmed killings, possibly even more. Meanwhile, Legion's lucky to get just a 1k against a good group of survivors.
---
It’s reddit.  We *all* go through posts and pages and get lost. I wanted to see what type of person you are to everyone else, and I got my answer. You’re not a nice person. You don’t speak *maturely* to people (but wanted to call me immature). You look for an argument with everyone.  Every comment you’ve ever made so far has been negative and looking for a fight.   
---
I knew where you were going with your “blendette” comment, so I shut it down extremely fast. And I actually gave you a very concrete and detailed answer. So actually, you should thank me. 
---
If you’re not new, you would have known what a blendette was honestly. 
---
By all means, block me! I wouldn’t mind at all. I think honestly, it would be good for the both of us because I can already tell what type of person you are and you’re going to grind everyone’s gears on this subreddit. People like you don’t last here.
---
Ha. We wish.
---
Were you bill? Lol.
---
- hey, what time is it?
---
- dunno, probably something about time to urban evade when the killer’s not around
---
Every. Single. Game.
---
Doesn't Meg literally have the most fuckin cosmetics in the game?
---
I had to stop running aftercare because people would just use it to run the killer at me
---
Yeah, and killer frame drops are horrendous on console. Which is part of the reason why Oni sucks on console.
---
Wow, thanatophobia, that's like, such a useful perk, wow. 
---
Sure, addons make them slightly better, but again, you're only really going to do well against survivors who aren't really all that great.
---
what
---
Honestly though, the basement isn't a very fun aspect of the game. I would want it to be reworked and am willing to compromise. I think both basements should always spawn instead of it being one or the other, but the basement should have 2 sets of stairs instead of just one, that way it can't just be camped or easy pickings. There needs to at least be a 50/50 involved.
---
Hey, you dropped your /s
---
Right?
---
...Right?
---
na even on PC she's (imo) the easiest killer to loop without each technically looping, after her rework she's 10x easier to lose and as someone that hated nurse I get hype getting a nurse game because running the killer is fun and a nice break from being a gen jockey
---
Tell me for curiosity, do you actively play Legion and play against them?
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
I wouldn’t know. I’m a solo survivor. It feels like every match I play, I get tunneled or camped for stupid reasons. Lower rank killers are so emotional and will face camp just because you didn’t get knocked in the first 30 seconds of a chase. But I agree that survivors can be unnecessarily annoying and toxic. I used to be that way when I started cos I was always going against toxic killers and was just annoyed. But now that I’m better I try to be better about not being toxic. Unless a killer is toxic first

---
DS is only a minute long .... it is not that powerful and if you tunnel that surv youbwill kill him.  I have never used DS and lived unless somone took aggro.
---
Programming is a lot like telling a child what he can and can’t do. No matter how many things you tell the kid he can’t do, he’ll find something else to do while you’re not looking.
---
Several reasons.
---
The time to heal haa been increased from 12 seconds to 16 seconds, which makes Self-care go from 24 to 32.
---
Sloppy Butcher increases heal time by 4 seconds up to 20 seconds or 40 with Self-care.
---
Pallet quantity on map has been decreased and pallet vacuums were removed. The time spent on pallets and the amount of them being reduced means survivors have noticably less time than before to spend time healing instead of generators if they're not being chased.
---
Exhauston not resetting during chase gives survivors less opportunities to extend chases.
---
Healing during a match will probably only occur once or twice if survivors do decide to heal. A med-kit is not infinite, but neither is a survivor's or killer's time. It is more efficient to use a med-kit over Self-care. Survivors can also use perks like Botany to make med-kits and healing speeds better (shave off 1/4 of thr time) or use We'll Make It to shave off half the time.
---
Other perks that extend chase time, increase healing speeds, decrease killer momentum and pressure, or avoid being hit by the killer make up for a slot Self-care could originally be in.
---
Survivors now need to be more time efficient on gens and resource efficient because all those resources have been decreased for survivors. A game of people too reliant on Self-care will stall to a halt and their pallet resources will diminish with no pressure on the killer with gens. Killer perks like PGTW can sometimes shift the match so drastically it's better to give the killer no gens to kick.
---
Survivors should learn to play injured and should access the situation if it is wise to heal. Playing injured teaches you more to position yourself better and to not make mistakes as you get chased.
---
I assume most inexperienced Self-care players use that first hit to make up for their misposition then just throw pallets down to not go down super quick without knowing how to loop well.
---
Lol no. That’s why I said they had no reason to believe I had Unbreakable. I was playing as default Dwight. You’d think killers would be nicer to me as a Dwight, but they aren’t. They’re nicer to me as Kate.
---
Survivors love to make excuses for their weaknesses.
---
I don't play them (least, not anymore) and they're a rare sight to see nowadays, but usually, I do pretty well against them when I do encounter them. Every once in awhile I'll die to an exceptional Legion, but even then they'll get maybe one survivor if at all, and that's it.
---
https://youtu.be/dIwpNxsKHjM
---
For those of you who haven't seen it
---
I think most of the survivor are actually feamale
---
Oh I didn’t really look into the nurse changes.
---
I do the same thing! I think any fan of The Texas chain saw massacre does! Lol
---
As a Bubba main and big TCM fanboy, I do too!
---
I like his headpiece ngl
---
Hopefully they are working on it. I know there are always bugs when a game comes out for a new platform. I’m tired of getting my foot stuck in gens too. It’s demoralizing to stand there while the survivors fix the gen your stuck in, haha.
---
I think that these are just issues with the dedicated server.
---
Also no need to apologize for your English, my dude
---
It all depends. You doing everything you can to help? Doing gens, totems, healing i will actively avoid you.
---
Sandbag, farm, allow me to get to struggle phase on my first hook? I will personally be ringing the dinner bell you trolling potatoes.
---
This has happened to me several times on PS4. It just gets stuck on the intro caption and never shows you anything else. No HUD, prompts, or skill checks. I’ve never been able to fix it once it happens. Pretty much makes you completely incapable of doing anything but running the killer around.
---
I cant play without getting a Ruin nowadays
---
Please let's petition this. That would've been beautiful.. Let the Hag keep her horrid swamp variation maps.
---
You're joking? Nurse and Spirit were far oppressive. If GF is oppressive then fuck me because my games are 50/50 with him depending on teammates vs almost always a 4k vs Nurse and Spirit
---
It stops you from screaming in madness but it still shows your location, It doesn't do anything for against Trapper or Hag traps.
---
You're not "educating" anybody. You're pathetic honestly. Not sure why you unblocked me just to say that, what a waste of time. Bye sweetie.
---
Way back it was survivor god mode, now it’s fairly balanced but there’s so many issues that hinder solo survivor for it to be very enjoyable.
---
I feel like the definiton of Toxic in DBD is different than on other games, in DBD, if you help yourself and hinder you enemy, you are considered to be toxic, Noed, Insidious, Ds, Bt, Adrenaline, Moris, Flashlights, everything that helps you is toxic to the other side, t-bagging is considered toxic in other games too so it shouldn't be a surprise.  In CS for example, a Toxic player is someone who annoys his own team or the enemy team (via all chat), teamkills and blames his mistakes on his teammates who did nothing wrong, but if you use a helmet to survive a headshot or an AWP to get an advantage over the enemy team, that isn't considered toxic, and that's what bothers me the most about DBD, if you try to be better than your enemy, you're considered toxic, which shouldn't be the case.
---
Not sure about the trap, but it counters Doc.
---
Screenshot from Demi's video right?
---
Yeah I ended the match with max boldness but still lost
---
Yes, it’s totally a competitive game. So arguments are bound to happen.   
---
From my personal POV, this game can spark some really great discussions. Way more than some other games.  But these discussions can get super negative super fast. But I get it; it’s killer against survivor. But we also pin survivor main against survivor main. We don’t help each other out a lot. 
---
But if camping and tunneling are the only toxic things that are worthy of discussion, that’s not gonna fly with those who do it. Or the killers who don’t do it but still think a perk, flashlight clicking, tbagging is toxic. We will never win
---
You can change them though? My self care is left d pad after my bumper messed up after playing so much and my pallet drop is x
---
The RNG on Plunderers is awful. I played a match where I got 2 gray medkit, and a yellow flash light. Then there’s ppl who are RNG gods like Monto and get a shit ton of red and purple keys using plunderers.
---
You’ve clearly never bought the auto-sniper in comp CS
---
Haven't had a huntress,plague, bag or demo in forever.
---
Does any think that maybe demo should be looked at? He is literally the 2nd newest killer we should be seeing him every once and a while at least.
---
Thats why i just mute the endgame chat and just play for fun. If one surv is being particularly toxic just ignore them until you cant. Chances are theyre trying to bait you into chasing/tunneling them.
---
My issue with these perks is that they allow the survivor to make incredibly stupid plays. I've had so many matches where all the gens are done and two survivors are up. I hook one (1), the other (2) is at full health. The other (2) goes for the unhook, takes the hit, and the both run away with most likely both of their exhaustion perks off cooldown, the unhooked person (1) able to take a hit (for 15 seconds) for the unhooker, and you are unable to pickup the unhooked person for a minute. Now I am not saying that this dumb play is uncounterable, but for multiple killers, pretty much any that don't have one-hit downs and even some that do (A Myers that won't get another Tier 3 or a Ghostface if they didn't 99 the unhooked survivor) you have to be running a small handful of perks, most of which only work with specific circumstances. Oh, you ran Devour/NOED, hope it doesn't get cleansed first. Haunted will only work if they think you have NOED, and they don't cleanse it before the gates get powered. STBFL might be the safest, but even that will only get you a trade. MYC only works if your first hit is after the unhook and is to the unhooker (2). Blood Warden might work, but only if your hook is after the gates open. What the survivors need to watch out for? The hooked person didn't get tunneled after their 1st hook and that the unhooker doesn't get grabbed (which is less likely the someone unhooking themselves). 
---
It is so frustrating when you have a healthy survivor standing in front of the hooked survivor, tapping the unhook button so they keep starting the animation, but not actually doing it, that way if you try and grab, you will just do a hit and lose both of them. In that situation, what is the killer supposed to do? Pray for a grab that will never come? Just go GG because you didn't base your entire build to counter this, and be lucky enough to have it survive? Or because you didn't want to play the one killer that 100% counters this, Leatherface? (Note: before you argue Billy counters this, his chainsaw only hits one person so if the other survivor (2) plays close to the hook, it's really hard to hit it on the unhooker, and not the hook/hooked survivor (1). Or the ones that kinda counter it, Doctor &amp; Plague? (Doctor can grab from treatment without hitting them &amp; Plague can put the unhooker (2) into the injured phase without giving the survivor a post-hit speed boost/cause an attack cooldown)
---
Pc or console? We can buddy up if you play on Xbox :)
---
Thank you, do you recommend I get pop in the shrine? I have more than enough points to do so.
---
I personally think plunderers is good especially paired with ace. But I guess everyone has their own experiences.
---
\*laughs in Freddy and Bubba*
---
I swore I read somewhere on here that there's a legal reason Quentin and Freddy don't have cosmetics. Because he obviously would've got one by now if there wasn't some reason. He would've at least got a Christmas sweater.
---
I only actually see people complain about tunneling, camping, and NOED on the killer’s side. And T-bagging on the survivor’s side. Plus toxic chat on both. Anything else I feel like are what the minority complain about or see as toxic.
---
Yeah, he is a faster hillbilly, they improved steering with controller too.
---
You make a very good point and I hope everyone reads this!  
---
It’s like, I never felt the need to post anywhere or vocalize that someone killed me with certain gun in a shooter game because they *should* be using this gun because I’ll have a better advantage. Like no, you find what’s right for you and you roll with it. Most shooter games are very vocal and toxic via voice chat. It’s been like that forever. We get heated. We get frustrated. We rage.  I’m mad that you killed me! I’m not mad that you killed me with what’s given to me in a game.  I never thought to think like that... until DBD. What makes DBD so different?
---
It depends on the map. If someone is standing outside Thompson house and waving at me while his two teammates are hiding nearby im not gonna take that. I know no one is on gens. I know I can simply sit there and wait for them to either go away (not likely) or throw themselves at the hook for some ezpz kills.
---
I never blocked you in the first place. God you’re super weird
---
Threads like these are honestly annoying to read with the amount of killers defending this stuff. Imagine if there was a spot where a survivor could somehow trap a killer in the corner and there's absolutely nothing the killer can do to escape, and when you complain about it everyone just says there's nothing wrong with it considering the EGC exists and the game won't go on forever. It's not the point, the point is that it makes the game unplayable for the survivors trapped for up to 5-10 minutes. For some stupid reason it's not bannable, but it sure as hell should be
---
Sorry, rant over.
---
I'm applying for a job as a designer for BHVR next summer when I move to Canada. I'm hoping to god I can get something done then
---
Yeah I just have awful luck with everything RNG in DBD. Always get the worst perks in my bloodwebs, never find hatch, paired with worst teammates, matched against toxic killers. Sometimes plunderers can be really good for me. I did get a few purple keys today but lost them because toxic killers. And another time I kept getting Alex’s toolbox and green toolboxes. So it’s not always bad
---
What if a survivor could somehow trap a killer in the corner and there was nothing the killer could do but wait for everyone to finish gens and leave?
---
it was originally a silly joke about people who like feet, don't read into it too much.
---
I love rank reset because I get to face against non meta builds and killers you never see in red ranks.
---
There was a time when everything was absolutely batshit insane. Survivors could permanently remove hooks off the map, killers could afk in front of a hooked survivor and get a free sac, sprint burst came off of cooldown in a chase, crazy, crazy, shit. There really was a feeling that you could do certain things *just* to shit on the other side.
---
Nowadays pretty much all of that is removed, the only thing i can really think of that is acutely OP and toxic is OoO with a SWF.
---
Im rambling but basically, everyone needs to calm the fuck down it isn't as bad as everyone says. I've only gotten like 2 salty profile comments this month, its an all-time low.
---
Thanks for sharing?
---
Upvote this comment if you dont care that hes leaving...  downvote if you care that hes leaving..
---
Cant let the trolls get to you man. Be strong friend.
---
I want Quinten to get a cosmetic: a mask.
---
Okay lol now I know I didn’t say I enjoyed it!!! Let me say... the first time I did get blinded I squinted so hard because my room was dark and my screen was bright white- i thought I really went blind/my game broke.  Haha.   But through all of that, I didn’t feel a negative reaction to it. After I was educated on the flashlights, I didn’t think that what they did was rude or wrong. 
---
I can say I am a flashlight gamer. I used to blind at pallets, not so much anymore because I know it can grind peoples gears. Once in awhile if I think I can juke them.
---
I can't wait for when Frenzy stabs no longer injure or apply deep wounds and just give a free speed boost.
---
Well I came in blind, I had no idea it was this bad. I was familiar with teabagging having played many FPS but didn't think it was prevalent or a thing in this game.
---
And to be honest, you're not wrong, if I ever get decent enough I'll probably repay the favor.
---
Right now this matchmaking definitely isn't helping.
---
Honestly there’s not really much you can do. Toxic assholes will be toxic assholes. The most you can do is not let it get to you. There’s also a lot of good people in this community, so try not to pay the few dick heads much mind.
---
I just feel like that tends to be the nature of the internet. Like you, I don’t indulge in any of the toxicity, but what can you do. I’d say there’s also a portion of the people who enjoy the toxicity and getting angry with the people and the game. Sometimes it makes a good vent for real life issues.
---
Feng and nea are also getting many cosmetic...really want more for kate
---
I dont have any problems. I enjoy xooming around with him way more than billy. I feel like a speedy hedgehog
---
Okay I wasn’t there from the get go but my closet friend was and he tells me those stories. **THAT** seems fucked up, and those are the things we should be happy we don’t have in the game. Why do we have to complain about everything?  
---
Swf with OoO is strong as shit. I can’t even remember the last time I SWFd so that’s why I didn’t put that in here. I forgot it was a thing killers hated. 
---
I like you. Just calm the fuck down
---
I’ve had this happen to a few friends of mine, as far as I know there’s no solution :/
---
Passed before morning
---
but you never know, ur being very negative here.
---
Her nerf was more substantial than people think, now her blinks even with addons nowhere near makeup for her slow movement speed, her 2nd blink fatigues if you try to charge it more than 1 second &amp; the only way to get an additional blink is to remove her ability to go thru walls. She can still be hard to play depending on the map &amp; how big brain the killer is
---
I feel like I’m a brain dead idiot because I’ve been playing a lot of games for years and years now and I didn’t know tbagging was so universal and toxic.  Except maybe in mortal kombat, I think I did feel some type of way in that. 
---
You’re gonna good at this game. It takes practice and thick skin. Don’t let others get you down; and don’t assume they’re doing something to piss you off. We all just want to win.  But I’m not saying let that sucker get away, try your hardest and be your sweatiest if you want. 
---
I hate matchmaking. I’m in this subreddit longer than I am playing this game because it’s been taking forever.
---
At least bubba gets cosmetics if you mori enough
---
I played nurse for a daily earlier today, and she's definitely worse than before. 30 seconds in, thrill of the hunt goes off, i teleport over, a guy blocks 1 hit, then i still grab them off the totem. They kill themselves on hook, someone DCs, (although i found out after that they lost power, from one of the survivors friends) but i'm 60 seconds in, 1 dead, 1 dc, 1 on the ground to be hooked, and I'm just like "wtf, why?!" I then just farmed with the last two, but one asked me to kill him in the end. After her nerf, nurse is slightly harder, but non of her addons do anything. They all kinda suck, except recharge rate. The fatigue reduction is pointless, because she has to recharge to do her blinks again anyways.

facts
---
On low mobility killers (Hag, Huntress) it’s usually not recommended. This is because you have to go out of your way to kick the gens, and, since you move so slow, it ends up costing you more.
---
It’s basically ok to pop a gen as long as you don’t go too much out of your way to pop it. Pop is really good on high mobility killers though, hence why I recommend it on Wraith. He moves insanely fast with his 2 speed addons that he is able to afford to kick gens. Even ones that are a bit away
---
Takes long enough to get into a game as is.
---
Dont listen to people shitting on clown. Pop is a great perk and he can stop loops like its nobody's business I havent read all the comments but ohh boy do some people hate on clown on this sub.
---
As a Pig manion behalf I'm sorry about a garbage killer and person and genral.
---
I’m gonna let my vain and pride take a beating and accept my downvotes with my opinion right now.  
---
I hate it. I hate the lobby dodging so much. Between long queue times and dodges, it makes it really hard for me and others to keep playing.   That’s my biggest question, why the hell does someone get to deny me a game? I don’t know a single game that does that other than the off chance someone fails to join on paladins or someone leaves a game mid match... yet they get replaced instantly so we don’t have to forfeit. 
---
I *hate* the fact that killers can choose who they can play against.   4 toolboxes **bye**.  All prestiged? You’re good! **bye**.   It’s bullshit. 
---
But.... I listen to why killers do this. They see toolboxes and think “why should I have to sweat even harder and protect gens when they’re just gonna rush me” or “why should I have to play against a 4man SWF” I get that it’s frustrating. I’ve been on the opposite end and it SUCKS sometimes if I’m not doing my best. 
---
But why make this game if you thought for a second it would be hard on players? It’s too late to change anything now drastically.   Unless they hide the screen where killers can see us. Or implement a timeout for dodging as well.  But they won’t do that right now... because killers aren’t going to be happy with that... and a lot might leave, and no killers = no game. Fucked up mentality :( i sad
---
Exactly.
---
The title really hit home when he dabbed on you with the blind lmao
---
he isn't faster than Billy, quite a bit slower actually. Billy in a chainsaw sprint is 230% movement speed, Oni in his dash is only 195%
---
yeah u don’t even need it on tier 1 Mikey anymore
---
Cause if they buff them than survivors complain. Survivors complain anytime a killer isnt garbage.
---
I like you too sweetheart, im just a drunk dude rambling about freeze tag simulator.
---
It baffles me how both sides are mad at the other for using strong tactics. Really i think we should remove the ranking system entirely or just have an unranked mode. It would tone down the salt i think. DBD is the only game where i play the ranked mode, because the ranked mode is the only mode.
---
Plying him, he feels faster.
---
is that scratch marks hair claudette?
---
Because it hurt OP's feelings. Not so obvious.
---
It kinda is homie. I love Otzdarva as much as anybody else, but a post just about his smile doesn’t really have much to with dead by daylight. Yeah he’s a public figure in this game, but if the mods remove a post cause it’s unrelated, there’s a pretty good chance that it’s unrelated. If you’re talking about something Otz said or did in relation to the game (like his new wraith video as part of Tru3’s debate, or even saying how he’s a good example of sportsmanship) then that’s fine, but this is just an Otz fan post. Don’t think this is the place for that. Just sayin
---
Good luck out there in the fog tho
---
Very true, gotta love the age ore fans who will defend and fall on the sword for BhVR Interactive when they should have hired more qualified people to help out, yet they are making allot of money and we still have a shit game.
---
Plenty of other games out in the gaming world have a million more things happening at once and don’t experience the same amount of shit.
---
FYI, I was "blocking her" by cornering her in a stone wall (where she was hiding) on the clown's map so that I could get a free hit
---
I feel pike Wraith has more usefulness than Legion sadly...
---
So what? You can queue again, isn't like dcing in the middle of the game like survivors do, which is worse in general
---
Wanna punish people lobby dodging? Enjoy longer queues since people already don't play killer as much on console, and I should remind you 1 killer is needed to even start a game. If 1 killer leaves it's equal as 4 survivors quitting the game due to dumb rules
---
Just sayin
---
Congrats mate!
---
Oh I love fan mail
---
He absolutely does. Legion is beyond a shadow of a doubt the worst killer in the game. Meanwhile, these absolute walnuts are going NaH LeGiOn'S sTiLl GoOd
---
There should be a ping limit set before they can ready up but this is BhVR Interactive and anyone above 250 I leave the lobby
---
Like the killer is wasting 2 perk slots
---
Personally, as a red rank killer, I dodge lobbies because I’m not sweaty. I play as Wraith, one of the weakest killers in the game. I play as him because he’s fun. 
---
I avoid 4 man swf with toolboxes and keys because I’m not going to have a fun game. I don’t care about winning or losing. I just don’t want to have all 5 gens done in 2 minutes. I don’t tunnel, camp, or use OP addons/killers. If I get a 4k great. If I don’t, too bad
---
I play this game casually. When I get “sweaty”, I don’t enjoy the game. Maybe if people weren’t so sweaty, killers wouldn’t dodge
---
For chat, saying gg first usually makes people act nice (if you lost). If you got a 4k, just say gg and leave. Like what's the point of sitting there and waiting for them to yell at you.
---
For the in-game stuff, you have to change your attitude. Treat them like little bratty memers and have a good time instead of seething every time they do something "toxic." Get Franklin's demise and knock their items out of their hands.
---
If things are going really bad, switch to meme mode. Currently I'm playing bamboozle-only clown. I kill megs. Only megs. At the end screen, I tell them god came to me in a dream. He told me only one clown is allowed per trial from now on. Sorry Megan.
---
With sloppy and ruin, it makes for a potent slow.
---
it's always a pleasant surprise
---
I only ever dodge if someone has a name with dc in it or I’ve ran across a toxic individual I dislike.
---
Ceased body function before sunlight
---
cursed image
---
Zimbabwe bubba
---
But didn’t you read the memo? Even though killers are invincible, and walking gods they are also the victims! /s
---
I used to play killer only for years and got to red ranks, i played a mix of clown and legion both ranked as trash killers I hardly ever ran ruin or noed and still pipped every game cause played for score not for 4ks but i got plenty 4ks as well
---
I will never understand why so many (not all but a lot) of killers are so whiny and angry constantly is playing a multiplayer game with god mode on not enough for them? Its hard cause people can run us in tiny circles and do a butt dance? Who cares hook them go stop gens, smash pallets, injure people get the game over
---
But nope lobby dodge swf, lobby dodge flash lights, lobby dodge tool boxes, or offering dodge map offerings, cause if survivors dont all line up and accept their death then its too hard. They act like they want everybody to die on first hook after a 2 second chase, do they even realise how shit their points would be from that?
---
I didn’t know that! I rarely open them but I’ll be sure not to now.
---
Funnily enough, it's the other way around. Shame this concept wasn't picked up by a pair of better developers, it's a good one.
---
Is that what he's saying? Holy shit lmao.
---
As a Canadian, I can say you'll love it here!! :)
---
Shred is good, portals are near useless. They're sort of a cross between bear traps and Freddy's teleport, except that they combine only the worst aspects of both. Some of which are multiplied.
---
Hate to say it but you aren't in the right either. There's no excuse for playing like a trash monkey troglodyte, even if the killer is a low tier. Your just a bit of a bitch if you play like trash and blame the killer
---
I wish they'd bring you to a 3rd person view when performing the break action, picking up a survivor or morying somebody, just so you can see that sweet skin you have equipped.
---
So many broken loops voullsnbe fixed by making bloodlust give you a decent speedboost.
---
Lawsuit be like hippity hoppity your game is my property
---
They did say it's something they've been looking into
---
Typos reeee
---
/s
---
Seems interesting though, keep it up!
---
Maybe I’m nice, but idk I wouldn’t witch hunt them like this. But body blocking bannable? Don’t make laugh!
---
A pig with combat straps can stand up fast and grab almost before her stealth wears off. Nice because combat straps are a brown addon. Plus, surveillance is a pig perk and it's decent for seeing when people get back on gens.
---
I wanna draw that now...
---
yeah well people might have a thing you dont have a life where they might need to do stuff your enjoyment of 1 match does mean someone missing something because well you shouldnt leave a match
---
Need to know how you were playing to get context really..
---
I love how salty survivors pull the "ban" hammer bullshit.
---
I had this happen to me a while back, funny thing is I was supposed to heal other survivors for a challenge
---
game over
---
Is this a PC thing? I have not come across a killer like this on console.
---
God knows the first one didn't work out.
---
It wasn't just because it was annoying. It was because her old scream was just so **LOUD**. Like deafening loud. The original VA who did it really did a great job with it.
---
Honestly, it was a really good sounding scream in the sense of "Holy shit I am being murdered!" type stuff. They should have just turned down the volume on her hook screams and it would have been fine. I like both of Kate's voices though. They both sound fine to me.
---
LMFAO not the F word
---
You Kimura. Released just last week or slightly before as a part of the new chapter With the Oni.
---
Yeah flashlight saves I can do but pallet stuns I cannot lol. I had to go for the attempt though.
---
People who use ruin are jackasses
---
That's just fall damage
---
Holy rotoscoping
---
Thanks!
---
"Let's be faggots together bb"
---
I keep getting the map with just the killer shack and some trees and rocks. No other buildings, no raised dirt hills. Flat ground, mostly open crap.
---
Excuse me I run no mither, self care, adrenaline, and iron will.
---
Nea fell from a high place
---
She’s brown?
---
They really do be putting their mic next to their mouth and moaning hard
---
Ah yes, getting DS'd after hooking someone survivors means I tunneled, thank you for your insight and not moving goalposts. /s
---
I know exactly who this is. They’ve sent me salt before and I just blocked them.
---
It’s weird you are downvoted. This is what happens when the mob mentality takes over.
---
You kinda fucked up there because DS is for tunnelers if you don't want DS don't tunnel this is common knowledge if you tunnel you get what's coming to you..
---
Why is Demogorgon so damn rare? He's a REALLY good Killer. Not Spirit or Nurse tier, mind you, but he's WAY better than Legion, Bubba or Doc
---
Why do people unironically make salt threads for the entire sub to see lmao
---
Ok kid
---
Well, some Mori's *do* make you go third person. But yeah, I agree, these should all happen.
---
I try not to let it get to me for sure, but man, sometimes, it’s tough to see someone go out of their way to add insult to injury. You won, sacrifice and pack up dude. I’m working on taking the game more lightly. It does make things a million times more fun, and like I mentioned in another comment below, sometimes you accidentally talk a killer into farming
---
And if they have to go do something that comes out of nowhere? How can you predict if something occurs and you need to stop the game to go somewhere? Does it bother you so much that a player leaves the game? Sure it sucks, but it is a game for f- sake and people should be allowed to choose when to stop playing -_-
---
The only thing I consider "toxic" in this game is DCing. And even that its toxic it's just a pussy move and ruins the match for everyone. Teabagging, flash light spamming, camping, noed it's all fair game. Sure it's annoying to get face camped and 1 hooked. Just move on. If people stopped crying about this stuff so much I bet people would do it less because it isnt even a reliable way to win the game. 
---
Idk the way I see it, as long as you dont quit, it's fine.
---
So what? You queue again
---
Yeah let 4 players keep playing.. if doesn't result in DC chain or just kill yourself on hook or farm fest
---
In every case a DC in the middle of the game is worse than queueing again
---
Thank you sir
---
Good I just took a hiatus
---
Yeah, that's one's really hard. I've tried it 9 times already, and nothing. I'm just gonna save it for last and hope I eventually get lucky
---
I don't think it's ever happening, especially considering that there already is a f13 game that's as close to a direct competitor of dbd as it gets.
---
Went against a Legion on Gideon with Iridescent Button , Than, distressing, Unnerving, and Colofobia ....me my two friends and the random just wanted to die after 3 minutes
---
I ran iron will on him for ages just so that I didn’t have to hear his cries for pain

"God what a waste of time" he says after voluntarily writing an entire paragraph

The "instant karma" style timing of the commentary. Title is obviously sarcastic as the gameplay is far from peak performance

God mode.. I stopped reading after that bs
---
What do you smoke? Or you are that delusional as a person in general?
---
If you don’t agree with the post and don’t want to make a point for either side then leave? Why are you defending clearly the incorrect side. There is no way in the world someone can actually validate the argument against this post. No fucking way.
---
Somebody's fired up tonight. Am I not making a point for either side or am I defending the wrong side? It can't be both lmao
---
Actually it can be validated, by saying it's just a game and if you feel this strongly about it you may need to take a quick break. Go for a walk, get some water, whatever you want.
---
Congrats.
---
Holy shit, I'm devotion 3 and even that I think I'm playing too much.
---
Jakes scream is earrape
---
I just started playing DbD a week or so ago and I love playing Claudette. I was really sad to see that she didn’t have an ugly sweater. :(
---
No worries, the pricks playing on PS4 are some of the shittiest people in the DBD community out of any platform. I just need to come join the PC community and get away from console... theres no class anymore on console not like it was back in the early 2000’s
---
I couldn't imagine Pinhead not being powerful, it would just be so weird.
---
Why isn’t it steve ahegao
---
It started with Legion. Give nerfed aspects of his original design no one even complained about, despite the only problem having been his moonwalk exploit. When that happened, survivor magic realized they could get anything by bitching no matter how unreasonable, so they got nurse nerfed harder than needed even though she's just needed add on tweaks. Then Spirit, they started screaming for within 48 hours of the nurse announcement. Because God forbid she equalize see through loops. Now it's Freddy because he hurts their ez gen speed, and Oni because apparently he can turn fast on PC and that's bad I guess?
---
Which is interesting. I never thought about it before, but why are survivors allowed an innate insta-spin movement ability but not killers? I get the camera perspective but the super spin biases the poorly designed loops for them quite a bit more. I mean, even Super Mario 64 had a turn animation when you changed to the opposite direction at top speed.
---
rather than cosmetics, imagine if his diverse arsenal was his add-ons. Each one gave you access to a different weapon, on top of the machete.
---
This makes sense, and I respect it. Tbh I enjoy watching a toxic survivor vs a fair killer get mind gamed/trolled. But I don’t play toxic so I don’t expect toxic treatment
---
Do they also want to actually put me in a dying state? Because that's what happens when the struggle phase starts.
---
I think Doctor is free on consoles but has to be bought on PC. People were giving out steam keys for his chapter earlier.
---
On behalf of the Pigs, I apologise for such fuckery. He will get no snoot boops
---
*IN HELL*
---
Nobody is forcing you to play the game. Quit it if you feel like it's bad for your mental health. Or take a short break if you think you still might want to play this game in a near future. If toxic chats affects you a lot. Once done with the game, hit the continue button right away, instead of torturing yourself reading the post chats. I like how this game is casual and at the same time has a high ceiling learning curve for killers. It's not a surprise that survivors will be toxic when you're a killer, any game with two opposing sides eventually will be griefing each other. You could always be the big person and hit the continue button and go on to the next game. Like I said, nobody is forcing you to do anything, you have to make the best decision yourself.
---
Wow! Thats what i need cus many time my tem die in the frst 3mins.. thanks! :)
---
"I think we're safe, I hear the chainsaw really far awAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH FUCK!?!?"
---
Yes, happens to me and my friend all the time.
---
I bet. I know she’s a high tier killer on pc but on xbox I’ve seen her a solid 20 times in my time playing. One time the nurse actually got a 4K and I hated myself for it cause she’s honestly so much worse on console. I’m sure there’s that 0.001% that’s good at nurse on console but I haven’t seen them that’s fs.
---
Ash has fought demons that's could literally destroy the world, Cough Cough Kandar the Destroyer Cough Cough aka that fucking building sized demon at the end of Ash vs Evil Dead season 3.

No just commenting my experience

She has one. She got one last year. It’s white-ish with tomato vines.
---
Stop just saying then
---
That makes me so happy! I probably just overlooked it then. Thanks so much. :)
---
Calm down there, Satan
---
It was allot, like 3/4 of all games played, solo survivor was the most played vs SWF. Remember when all the killers kept screeching that SWF was running rampant and that’s why the killers were having such a hard time and that it was unfair? 
---
Then BhVR dropped that early Xmas gift like a bomb on all the crybaby’s and it shut allot of the complaining up in the community, because it proved that SWF was a very small percentage of the player base actually going into battle and kicking some ass in the fog! 
---
I hope they do another info drop again in the new year.
---
Dude Even the male survivors sound like this. Have you heard Jake go “Mmph...augh” when picked up?
---
From what I've heard it was a bug and got fixed.
---
Yep I’ve had a couple times lately where I’ll run a killer 3-4 gens by simply knowing when to leave loops and make distance and then my teammates will instantly go down as soon as there chases and throw the game. I’ve had a couple of times where the killer felt like I should have won for playing so well he would just straight up ignore me and kill the others and let me get hatch. Usually he would send me a message afterwards giving me props.
---
Excellent. I will order your entire stock.
---
So PC can expect our performance to have its knees bashed in with a baseball bat? Lovely.
---
Oh you can have a excellent jam up SWF team and then you get a really seasoned killer who don’t fuck around and bends you all over with no k-y and your left thinking at the end of the match of what the Fuck happened and who didn’t do their job on your team... 
---
Yah solo survivor can be a total cluster fuck and the higher you go the worst it seems to get... seen rank 15’s play better than rank 1-5’s
---
Same here
---
Even pre nerf he still had good weaknesses that balanced his strengths. But I I there's still better killers out there above him.
---
&gt;inherent weakness =Billy and Bubba. Weak against loops, however he has the additional wait unlike the other two. No matter how you slice or dice it. He's an M1 killer until he gets his power, which sucks ass and makes him much more weaker. I dont give a shit how powerful his ability is, Oni is a M1 killer until he gets the first hit.
---
&gt;reason why he was good is because you were out positioned, just like Billy and Bubba! Had easier controls and flick is what really made him better than the two. Yes his blood orbs are supposed to be everywhere not for tracking although it's a good tool. It's meant so that he doesn't have to go back to being an M1 killer and getting looped to daylight. Hence why his perk blood echo exists to help keep people injured. So that when they start unhooking you can earn your powers back or already have enough from previous chase's to keep the momentum.
---
&gt;his nerfs make his flick much more smaller, idk exactly but some say it used to be roughly 90 degree now to 30 degrees which you can flick.
---
&gt;no, even with his powers if he gets it just run to a damn loop. Most Oni players at the time learned this and compensated by constantly dashing to find someone outpostioned. Oni and billy are pretty similar. Wherever billy is on the tier list Oni should be above or below him. He's a decent killer, weaker than before, but I wouldn't say he was that strong other than his tracking being very powerful.
---
And for the 7th week in a row, Sporty Meg!
---
Oof look at those downvotes. Only green rank GF mains in here, I see lol.
---
Completely agree though that other stealth killers needs some buffs. Pig is probably the closest to being balanced, they just need to touch up her boxes, add ons, and make her faster when crouched and possibly speed up the crouch transition a bit. Oh and change the audio cue on her ambush.
---
Make sure to go to their “body” section of their store page, it’s a green item in there.
---
All Survivors except Laurie and Quentin have one now.
---
He is free in all platforms. Doctor can be purchased with shards
---
Bless up! My queen has a sweater now!
---
No, he is free on PC with shards
---
Or better yet if your injured (or you know your going to be instant downed) just hop into a locker. It's the ultimate f*ck you because if he opens up he loses his power.
---
Usually I enjoy facing seasoned killers unless there trappers or spirits(screw the spirit forcing people to run iron will), usually my favorite good killer to go against would be billy cause you can respect if he outskills you. Usually though the killer would have some bs happen to him and lose or it will be a fair match where he gets 1 or 2 back when I played a lot of swf.
---
And this is why dc should not be punished...
---
How is he free exactly if you have to pay for him with shards
---
Not sure if you are on Xbox. But just set it to where only friends can send you messages
---
Really? Cause I’ve had this issue since the chapter update and it hasn’t gone away
---
I think she found you on Reddit and downvoted all your shit too lol
---
Thats Sheltered Wood, which is a pain for everyone
---
Sloppy is fire on Huntress, one of my favorite when I prestige her and havent found the Ruin/BBQ/Nurses/PGTW set
---
I hate it
---
They are having a Winter Sale at the beginning of January. I’d assume that some characters would go on sale. On PSN there’s constant sales for the game and characters.
---
While the screams are loud it still will never come close to the femur breaker scream
---
I havent seen a shooting stars meme in forever. This was a very nice edit
---
had similar situation happen to me but i was playing as ghostface. just trying to have fun with the survivors, i hooked each 2 times and at the end i just started goofing with them and meme around as ghostface. they were swf and they told me if i am trying to be friends with them cuz i wont be and i should try with other people. i am like i am just trying to make people laugh and have fun, but later that day i made a fully deaf streamer smile and it made me happy. remember there is always good and bad people. but if u make someone smile it will overtake the anger in you. don't worry about the troll. if he didn't have a terrible life he wouldn't have said that stuff to you. &lt;3
---
Right, but on console he's just unlocked for no Shard cost as soon as you start up the game along with Hag. He's auto unlocked the same as Trapper or Billy would be.
---
Probably intimidate him since she’s considered to be better by many
---
It’s not the greatest but it’s still fun 🤷‍♀️
---
And theres the toxic swf.
---
I think they cleansed too much tbh I lost like 33% for healed injuries
---
Nice to see my boy Jake stay consistent over the years.
---
last hotfix. Note only pc is suffering, console's controls were already worse than this.
---
Feng's evil twin
---
When did the Entity manage to abduct 4666?
---
That Feng is the equivalent of a kitten that won't listen to you about not going up on the table while you're eating.
---
No seeing survivors ranks, was unintentional.
---
"Oh you're running to the coldwind tree/macmillian building/shack..
---
Oh you too?
---
And..again..
---
Nah its cool I'll just. Y- yea no I'll just hang out in the corner. The entity is gonna torture me for this but its better then trying to chase you."
---
It's called tunneling, friend.
---
PERSONALLY, if you like to get very immersive into the game and like to make your own fun I would buy Legion but your logic is right, Pop is nice but clown is just like, idk he's just boring to me, you always do the same thing
---
The console versions are all "special editions" that come with Doc and Hag automatically unlocked. On PC they're both killers you can buy with shards.
---
I escaped one time when that was an issue just fast enough to get into spectate and watch the other 3 survivors die to the end game collapse as it went off while the bar was barely below halfway lol
---
Wouldn't be surprised tbh
---
But he used dead hard, that's what's suppoda happen
---
Also SB + DH + Lithe + BL
---
Yeah? You gonna hold a gun to someone's head to make them play with you?
---
Who cares about rank..
---
Indeed, in her rage she will probably try to slash the entity if he ever shows himself in front of her. The only exception may be her mother or someone who looks lile her.
---
Kinky
---
Are you under the impression that shards cost real money?
---
I know.
---
That’s still free.
---
If you don’t have to pay real money, it’s free.
---
I see what you did there
---
It's big brain time
---
You must never have played an FPS before.
---
I track the same thing but as a red rank survivor PC player. The comparison is very interesting.
---

With new Obedience Add-on on Doctor
---
I laughed audibly a few times reading the most recent posts. Thanks for sharing.
---
kek
---
I disagree. There has been few killers with perks to slow down the gen repairing time like crazy much... and if you increase the gen repairing time  the match is already lost.
---
Inches away from dead-harding into the side of the exit 😂
---
If the game told me who was in an SWF and who was not, I'd be shitty to less people. I'd only be shitty to SWF discord crutching clowns.
---
bruh what are you even saying.  Killers win most of the time, or get 2-3 kills.  Gens take 80 seconds I believe.  Perks like ruin, kicking gens or pop, discordance, nurses etc can slow down the game.  Certain killer abilities (Freddy's teleport, Plague's illness, Pig's bear traps etc.) can slow down the game.  Hooking survivors and forcing unhook/heal time slows down the game.  I think you need to just practice more and you'll find the game is in a decent spot.
---
Best of luck man, I don't play killer a ton but if you want more tips I'll happily research for you.  Sorry you're having a frustrating time.
---
Rank 10 killer here, going against reds and purples exclusively (only one game with survivors who weren't red and purple, and even then 3 of them were still red/purple, so far).
---
Ruin has spawned right next to the survivors (breaking within the first 20 seconds of the match, including the time needed to actually cleanse the totem btw) or within clear LOS of a generator every single time even on indoor maps, except this one time on The Game.
---
I keep getting looped for too long to make any chase worth it around too many safe pallets, and haven't gotten a mindgame off on any red/purple yet, and between sounds being bugged as fuck (survivors without Iron Will being completely silent, or hearing survivors as if they're right next to me when they're 20 meters away without using Stridor) and how absolutely ridiculous tracking scratchmarks is (they seem to be fading faster this patch and I'm color blind to the point that Windows' color blind mode is not helping, particularly since they make flashlights so much painfully brighter) because BHVR made them fucking red.
---
It's just not a good time, and I still have to go against rank 3s as a rank 10.
---
it's based on terror radius, monitor &amp; abuse on nurse is quite common  
---
also it only activates if the nurse keep chasing the just unhooked person  
---
but i didn't know that the maps were 64m wide, glad to know now (kinda)
---
I would much rather brutally gen-rush the Plague because jokes on you, 3 survivors can pop a gen:Without any perks!Without any items!Through Ruin!
---
In 33 seconds!
---
Just totally clear this side of the map, it's a Plague, there are still 4 gens left to space out and avoid a 3 gen! It takes her more than 30 seconds to cross the map and get her power and return to pressure the generators, so now you can cleanse on this side for free!
---
What is she going to do? Oh right, we're all four alive and two survivors can pop a gen:Without any perks!Without any items!Through Ruin!
---
In 44 seconds!Plague leaves to get her power and we're going to pop both generators before she can even think about regressing them, sucks to be her, we're all healthy and the generators are powered, we can just immerse through her one charge of Corrupt Purge.
---
If she goes to get a second, it takes longer than is needed for the gates to be opened and for us to escape!
---
**Plague isn't in a good spot if the survivors just 3-man each generator right from the start before they even get broken in order to create a dead zone they can cleanse in freely.**
---
Honestly from my experience most surviviors don't care,  especially if they're down in the game and have no chance. I've had killers message when there two of us with 1 gen done and say we get to farm but they get to kill us at the end. I always let them, because at that point I got more points than I was going to get. 
---
Plus,  fake farming killers are expected now. A lot of killers do it,  even message before the game lol. Pretty toxic but it happens.
---
It's funny? Playing killer you get slapped in the face with a lot of pallets, it feels really good to see a survivor run to a pallet, all the while they're thinking "yes I'm safe! Take tha- OH SHIT!" and I then they get clobbered.
---
It's not like they're particular good. Once the survivors know you have dream pallets they can just pre throw every pallet to be safe
---
Or if you just play a normal game
---
I do because low rank killers have atrocious match times
---
The second blind is just... man, insult to injury. Leave the poor man alone.
---
Yeah those are all valid reasons to not like the game. I just repair the car and leave by myself.
---
Nurse said she’ll do it herself
---
Freddy is literally the strongest killer right now. Chill.  
---
They've stated that Cannibal is going to be one of the ones to be looked at next.  
---
Legion doesn't need buffs. He needs his whole concept rebuilt from the ground up like Freddy.
---
Hyperprotip (for PC players): Just create a toggle-able macro that spams Space and lean back while watching the three Blendettes heal in the far corner of the map.
---
Skins are technically usless to
---
This happened to me 2 times in one match tonight and I pressed the button multiple times. It never dropped
---
Hell yeah now I can wait for legion to get buffed first..................
---
Tunneling is a strategy™
---
It is a meme build. Youre so slow and all it's not viable in the most sweaty ranks
---
Dont listen to them. Jumpscare myers isnt even the best jumpscare build anymore with other stealthy killers around. Fun as fuck to play as tho.
---
It is kinda op in the ospital map
---
Ya but what you don't understand is that if you stack all the game slowing perks you won't be able to run other perks like BBQ, discordance, nurse's, whispers or even infectious fright and enduring. It's just a big tradeoff that all depends on the survivors you go against which you can't control.
---
Now for real, Yui is Laurie Strode level of loud.
---
I don't remember exactly, but I think I just for the life of me can't figure out where to go for some reason
---
More like LOOK AT ALL THOSE CHICKENS
---
Drifting with it is so cool
---
Anyone else getting a lot of game crashes during matches lately?
---
This is why I rebind the Skillcheck key to something else.
---
Take a closer look at feng :D
---
It makes it unbalanced in 1vs1s. This game doesn't need add-ons for for both the sides.
---
Are you rude or are you rude in general?
---
Sounds like someone had a pig mori daily
---
he actually does tho
---
Yeah my bad sorry. Keep getting the old Leader effect mixed up with current Prove Thyself.
---
As someone who is terrible at looping, I ran I think 4-5 full Blood Furies in a row without getting hit. I’m honestly less scared of him in BF than I am of him in normal mode.
---
Technically speaking, pop is 25% per gen hook kick, while thanataphobia in theory impacts 4 survivors at 16% each
---
2 out of 3 ain’t bad. Ace In Your Hole and Open Handed are good in some builds.
---
It’s just a bad perk. It’s great you’re using it for jukes instead of crouching around the map looking for ruin. Once you get into higher ranks however, you’ll find that killers don’t fall for urban evasion jukes ever. So unless you’re playing against hag it’s just a waste of a perk slot. Now in defense of UE there are rank 1 survivors that run it sure, but even they almost never get to use it durning the match because there aren’t many situations where you would need to crouch walk 100% faster, you barely even crouch walk at all in the average game that’s Green rank+
---
If you like being immersed/stealthy a much better perk to run would be spine chill, that way you only go hide when you know for certain the killer is coming for you. But at the end of the day remember the most important thing is... **just run whatever you have the most fun with**
---
Did Feng Min really just accuse Claudette of using No Mither? Shame.
---
I don't know about you people but trapper with the circular saw is something special to me
---
Hella hatin lol
---
Yeah, I did. I could not figure out what was wrong. Maybe because I'm new (?
---
Not talking about people who are trying there just so many people who throw games on purpose and give up dying on first hooks and really really trying to make others experiences terrible
---
Lol even on high ranks sometimes i stay on hook, usually its when someone so stupid to show himself, waiting to resque when i leave hook. God dammit, you are literally near hooked survivor, doing nothing, why should i leave hooked one? I better stay near, try to come close to you. If you want me to not stay near hook - dont act so obvious
---
Don't really care about spelling on reddit I'm not typing a report
---
Free only because you can buy it with shards only because its not real money doesn't mean its free free is when it cost nothing even if it would cost bp its still not free
---
Killer games start up in less than 10 seconds consistently. Xbox red ranks. Game pass probably has some correlation here.
---
Be nice if it was just hold A
---
I main Princess Beach actually
---
Michael on a Bichael
---
If I'm playing GhostFace and two are left I'll just chuck em on the ground or hook if it doesn't kill and wait and see if I can get both down to secure the kill or just kill and see who gets the trap door faster, or gate I guess
---
12 vs 8 is normal. it's 4 ranks apart. the "hard limit" is 6
---
The hard limit can be bypassed tho. Imagine this. Rank 14 killer picking plague for the first time after buying her, getting Hawkin's lab which makes it hard to use her puke, facing 4 rank 4 survivors
---
That's what I played a few days ago as a survivor
---

That’s a big yikes from me chief.

As an Adam main, yus

Interesting thoughts. I made it to rank 4 right before reset, but I probably have a very unconventional play-style. I feel like there are a ton of objects where the killer would easily see me standing but have provided cover for me to hide while crouching. I try to play a very stealthy game, my usual setup is DS (almost mandatory to avoid getting tunneled when some potato unhooks you right in front of the killer), Empathy, Balanced Landing (kinda sucks but I don't have Lithe or Sprint Burst), and UE. Of all of those perks I feel like UE is the most core perk to how I play, although I'd like to try some other stuff out. I feel like not running it would require the biggest change to my gameplay, but I'll give it a shot at some point to see how I feel about it.
---
My usual method of transportation around the map is sprinting. With Empathy I have a pretty good idea of where the killer is a decent amount of the time so it's not that risky.
---
Bruuh survivors can loop so ficking god against killers and goodmode would only bee if killers are unstoppable only because they can't be hurt they are not in goodmode only because a survivor can't win a 1v1 against a killer doesn't mean that the killer is in goodmode you're probaly the kind of person who says that the game is unbalanced you mained killer for 2 years but still think killers are in godmode wtf
---
If a trapper is stuck like this how do I help? Do you let them hit you, try to step yourself in the trap, what can you do as survivor? Cause this sucks
---
Well people have been complaining for months about teammates still using selfcare. If you use it wrong it can cost the game a lot of times.
---
It isn't op, you're at 85% speed, it's just entitled survivors who don't know their fingers from their toes
---
Yes, because screaming when your in immense pain is very strange
---
This would make bbq a low used perk. Only reason I use it is for bp
---
Oh boy I would take this down before people say you’re promoting blackface
---
"Blendettes have entered the chat"
---
^^but ^^you ^^can't ^^see ^^them
---
I felt like I was that Wraith. You did blind me I just swung wildly and managed to hit you
---
Nah, maybe it’s my side of the world where I play or whatever, but I’ve had so much fun in high ranks, both as survivor and killer. I don’t sweat and as long as I get good teammates and a fair killer/enemies, it is always fun. 
---
Jumping out of my skin because a Gf hid his light or having a good chuckle at a panicking survivor hiding in a corner and looking at me like “yeah I know I fucked up” it’s fun, more fun than low ranks where you get tunneled and two of your teammates hide in a corner while the other one gets chased.
---
So yeah, although I do get pissed because there’s a few assholes here and there, the game is still fun as fuck, especially when you play competitively with people that know what the fuck they are doing enough to let everyone have fun
---
Oof
---
I notice at as both killer and survivor, I just stand there and wait patiently as a killer when I see the survivor just stood at the pallet

Also Survivors: “Why does no one want to play Killer for us?”
---
Forever Sharp Hand Joe
---
I second this. I feel like my survivor game really took off when I started playing killer. Seeing how people lose you, loop, and mind game from the opposite side was really eye opening, both in what to do and what not to do.
---
You literally repeated what I just said. So I'm suggesting move the farm aspect to monstrous shine since it doesn't have Aura ability. It's too easy for killers to say they use it only for farming and don't take advantage of the location aspect
---
Shirtless david hahaha shirtless micheal ahaqhha
---
Amazin
---
that's the problem. All 4 have to be injured for it to have a decent effect and then a survivor dies it reduces in power which is really stupid. Maybe if dead survivors would count it would be a good perk to use
---
Reminds me of a noob3 video when he ran into someone with the same name (the guy didn't DC in the vid)
---
So you want to take the main reason people use it and put it on a worthless perk just because? I don’t understand you logic, some killers don’t use the aura aspect therefore it needs to be moved? Like why?
---
He has such a smiley face
---
You could probably look up a streamer’s recent gameplay of Spirit or Wraith on YouTube
---
BBQ "bonus part" is the aura reading
---
Okay, now I understand. I think it would make both perks mid-tier, or MS would still be low-tier, but chosen more often in basement builds.  MS is a shitty perk, even with BP bonus
---
I don’t really agree with him being op it’s more that he is completely overshadowing myers which isn’t fair imo.
---
Yes I understand that logic, I just don’t understand why you are so against it. The aura reading isn’t even op, you can literally get in a locker to prevent it. All you are trying to do is make grinding for bloodpoints harder because you hate the aura reading part
---
Basement hooks are used more rarely than normal hooks (except when you run basement build, or is just near you), so people would still have a problem with putting BP bonus on MS, because BBQ is easier to use
---
Fucking never. All this subreddit is, is bitching about legion or the matchmaking.
---
i like when it’s purely cosmetic choice tbh
---
&gt;Ah, I see. So you already know about the matchmaking issues that have been occurring for a little while. My bad.
---
The new matchmaking is working very well, people just can't be bothered to do some research before making a thread complaining about something working as intended. 
---
Most 7 out of 10 "fix matchmaking" threads we see are showing all players within 6 ranks of the killer, which is something intended by the devs. People might not agree with this decision but that doesn't mean matchmaking is not working or has issues.
---
Taking up another perk slot just to get add ons isn't worth it...Plunders gives you great items as it is...I just started playing DbD like 2 weeks ago and used Plunders right away....I got a bunch of boxes,keys,maps, medkits so ppl r fine with that tbh.
---
I know that feeling. I never run into a Ghostface that DOESN'T hard camp and tunnel anymore.
---
It should be like teachables
---
Does Quentin see illusions then, cause lack of sleep? 😂
---
We're Gonna Live Forever gives stackable BP bonus for safe unhooks and protection hits, but that's all. You don't get somethink extra, like aura reveal in BBQ
---
Hes not too op...its just the damn shroud. It's not fair to play against.  Like how r we supposed to crouch or walk away to not be seen when we cant look at him ?? He already can see us very clear from far away when stalking, why give him shroud ??
---
Like I said I was kinda in a rush to get it out (I  originally was typing this on reddit but my phone died without me knowing when I was about 2/3rds of the way through so I redid it on Google Drive.) But that was also partially intentional cause I orginally only wanted to make the killer and tried to used as little quotes that weren't from The Ruiner as possible (considering he's only really in control/influencing for about half ofthe album.) I've already got some ideas brewing for a survivor though so you can expect it in the revised version.
---
These are the only solutions because of DBD's player population size and how many ranks there are on top of needing 4 survivors to 1 killer.
---
Don't expect devs to "fix it" because they simply can't even if they wanted. 
---
If they try to fix one problem by turning matchmaking stricter to create fairer matches, people complain about queue times.
---
If they try to fix queue times by turning matchmaking wider to create faster queues, people complain about unfairness. 
---
Somehow you managed to complain about both situations so good luck.
---
Bro they're the thirstiest players. They want to win so fucking bad they'd ruin the game exp if they have to smfh
---
So why is this nsfw? Because you said 'fuck'?
---
Course they can loop, but we move faster, can juke, moonwalk, mind game, they watch videos to learn those loops, watch the same videos find out how to end them. 
---
Yes I did play killer for a long time and maybe it’s just me but in my personal experience killer is way easier, I get fucking wrecked as survivor, way harder to play and adapt, for killer it’s easy to predict where they are going. It got tougher are purple/red ranks but was still completely doable. If you are at gold/green and getting looped that bad then you need practice not more killer buffs
---
I need to finish the show.
---
ace in the hole &amp; plunderers are good item farming perks. they aren’t bad at all, just serve a specific purpose. open handed is good for perks like kindred.
---
Not bad but every other killer has something better than legion
---
Yeah ikr? I think i posted at a bad time cause shitty memes that took me seconds got thousands lol
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
I don't know too many killers that can vault faster than survivors and know exactly where survivors are. He's not a top tier killer but in a better place than they were. Very fun to play.
---
Of course they will have a problem with you wanting to remove their training wheels, all children do when they're trying to learn how to ride a bike 😉
---
because contests have all the legalities sorted in the terms and conditions. there's a lot of headaches to be had trying to sort out things like rights, royalties etc that just isn't worth it for the potential earnings of Joe Shmoe's cosmetic idea. the alternative to this is something like Steam Workshop, and that's just... yeah, no.
---
I think having this extra effect added on to blindness would give Blindness a desperately needed buff. 
---
It might even pull Third seal out of its current place of being a horrible hex perk.
---
It would also make blindness add-ons from killers like the Clown and Freddy significantly more useful since currently there is almost no point in running them.
---
Then why is it such an issue even suggesting to change it?
---
After that game he brought an ebony mori to the next
---
It's a good skill but after deactivating it from vaulting you'd still be at the normal chase distance as anyone else most of the time.
---
Good to know
---
Those are all good perks tho. Why would you be mad at someone for using them?
---
Spirit and Wraith aren’t getting their speed boost
---
Surge require just down survivor
---
Pop require hook and go to Gen and kick it, wasting time
---
I'm gonna make a guess and say because Surge is an area of effect and Pop requires laser focus, so to speak.
---
Congrats! I’m almost at devotion 9 on ps4
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
They changed post-phase state in that way, yes. And happy cake day :D
---
European aswell, that's odd though. I noticed rank or time doesn't matter much, the queue times stay the same for me.
---
the same thing happened to a survivor when i was killer, i think it might be an infectious fright bug
---
Imagine using wraith. You must suck at chasing down survs
---
Seriously thats just making deep wound almost useless
---
Her weapon skin changes the glass shards on her hand as well.
---
yeah was pretty much expecting that info to be wrong, considering that the guy didn't know about borrowed time being related to terror radius. so I just thanked for the info.. ""(kinda)""
---
Mate if I hook someone and know 2/3 ppl are attempting the save. I will camp you as long as you like. 
---
If you’re team is pressuring gens. I am noping away.
---
Uh Feng gets very few outside of the lunar events and Christmas sweaters everyone else gets too. She has only had like 3 official cosmetic launches in the store since it first opened (sci fi series...ballerina...weird neon gaming outfit that really doesn’t look much different from her default, just with random headset) as opposed to Meg getting one literally every patch *cries in Feng*
---
I mean, i know about the stalling builds with Sloppy and purple blade got ruined. Other than that what build was affected? Cause STBFL wasnt really all that great so it was a small loss imo.
---
*Nightmare*
---
I'm also on the european server, yet I have a queue time of 5 mins max
---
Agreed, my only worry is queue times though ;w;
---
Not as bad as people are saying. I’ve seen so many “ONI UNPLAYABLE ON CONSOLE” comments floating around and it’s a gross exaggeration.
---
Wait, wasn't this fixed already?
---
Same shit as killer
---
Goes back to I think it's OP.
---
Source?
---
Enduring is a great choice, baiting pallets in Frenzy and getting stunned allows you to break out of it faster and break it after (just dont bait them if you havent gotten a hit), obviously Spirit Fury pairs well with it. Other than that Ruin and Pop are good stalling options, Discordance and BBQ provide invaluable tracking and Corrupt is good for both stalling and making sure survivors get closer together. For addons always go for at least one duration and pair it up with either the yellow, green or iridescent button
---
You need to get over your salt over BBQ.  It's stupid easy to counterplay.  Slow vault a locker and stop whining.  There's literally no reason to change BBQ.  The devs aren't going to nerf it just because you're too lazy to counterplay it.
---
After you get over your salt from sometime suggesting your training wheel perk is op.
---
Goodbyyyyye, moonmen!
---
but it's the literal same distance as it was last time. just different speed and duration
---
Adam main here, I really REALLY hope they give him an outfit this mid chapter patch
---
the is just the new game mode "the floor is entity"
---
Well I don’t but i guess we can agree to disagree
---
sOLID
---
If you start to burn him out when he starts to reveal (from feet) it is not enough time to burn him, since his revealing animation starts at the middle of uncloak. Uncloak takes 3 seconds by default, so he starts to be visible at 1.5 second mark. You need to start burn him out when he is still fully cloaked.
---
Lol training wheel perk is the first laughable statement.  Only a baby survivor fresh off the boat feel this type of salt over BBQ at this point.
---
Second laughable statement was assuming I use BBQ.  It's almost never on my loadout.  Any survivor with a brain can choose to counterplay it at any point so against good groups you don't get the reads anyways.  You really need to practice man.  You come off as such a biased child.
---
DBD players: *complain about NOED
---
Killers: *use other perks
---
DBD players: *complains those perks too
---
Hey my Myers meme, beautiful
---
I was rank 2 ma'am. Your bliss is so salty.
---
The game really wants you to play demi, don't deny fate
---
It’s not just any Community Manager. It’s Not_Queen
---
I do. But I enjoy being on both sides. If I'd only paid to be a killer I wouldn't have a single issue.
---
Sometimes that isn't anyone's fault and I think the consensus is that people would rather restart a match than do a 3v1 so there's no issue with me on that point. Just getting to a loading screen consistently seems to be the problem for me! Lol
---
Not got a problem with this. I wish there was an automatic filter where if they were on your blocked list they couldn't matchmake with you. That would seem to solve both of our issues.
---
who cares about thana lol
---
It was larger, thiccer, heavier and cruder than any normal blade
---
Yikes that's some bullshit team you had, my friend. Hope you don't get them again
---
If you don't want to play...just don't load it up haha. I'm not forcing you to enter a lobby...
---
Imagine those loops if they took out bloodlust like OhTofu wanted
---
Hey fuck you too bud
---
Pretty sure they prepare the music booth, the "voice" actor comes in while mccoten stands with a hammer and they bring a table in.
---
Not true. You can remember who has dead hard and it's still useful when they use it to get to a pallet or window. It doesn't have to be used to directly dodge a hit. Just to close the gap to the pallet that you wouldn't have made without it.
---
People said we wouldn't get a clow because the Devs literally said they wouldn't add one because they know people have a sever phobia and don't want to cause stress.
---
I agree, it is easier as killer in the sense that you have more control over the game. I actually have more respect for survivors who can waste the killer's time effectively. As a killer, you rarely need a buff but actual game management. i.e. if someone is looping, get a pallet or something useful out of them and then move onto someone else who may not be as good or catch them out of position. My problem is usually that all 4 can loop me until kingdom come! Hahah
---
It might come from the fact that as you mentioned they are low rank killers....
---
A lot of baby killers simply think that camping is the best strat to use
---
I usually just give them tips afterwards on how to play better
---
surge is an aoe to potentially hit multiple gens at once. You can't pop multiple with multiple downs since youll have to down, pop, hook, pop. Having to go to a gen is already all the cooldown you need.
---
Chill isn't an opinion most games if you want any kills
---
That's not naziism, that's a very reasonable thing to get annoyed about.
---
mychael on the cycle
---
It’s not considered a witch hunt as long as you block out the username which the OP did.
---
It’s more like sharing and experience
---
Licensing
---
Lol again barking up the wrong tree.  I can loop just fine my dude.  Just pointing out how laughably easy it is to counterplay if we choose to in our games.  
---
And I'm sorry but there's zero chance you play better survivor than me whining this much about BBQ.  That screams noob survivor man.  Again BBQ is fine.  It won't get reworked to appease a salty entitled player.
---
&gt;I’ve never heard of a player saying you shouldn’t teabag.
---
Then you must be new here
---
&gt; I’ve only heard them call it what it is: rude and a BM play. 
---
It's about the equivalent to flipping someone off and I flip my friends and people I barley know off plenty.
---
Maybe grow some thicker skin if a player slowing themselves down for you hurts you.
---
&gt; This is where survivors whine and claim that it’s not rude. 
---
Nah, just the GAMERS that have grown up with this behaviour don't care and know it's not rude. You're the one whining about it.
---
&gt; When I play survivor I have never once done it. 
---
I'll do it as killer. Maybe quit being a snowflake about it.
---
I very, very rarely go against the pig and last time i did it was a facecamping pig
---
no boops for me :(
---
To think people were getting mad at killers for abusing the basement glitch. Like survivors don't take advantage of game flaws whenever they can.
---
You could've left this spot using the speed boost from the first hit instead of being a scumbag.
---
All I did was post a leatherface meme and now this format is everywhere here lol.
---
Are we playing the same Demo?
---
Healing takes:
---
* 16 seconds base
---
* +4 for Sloppy Butcher (as of last time I checked a live test, the Wiki is wrong; Mangled gives 25% extra healing time, not 20%)
---
* +4% per injured survivor, minimum 1 (duh).
---
I thiiiiink all percentages in DBD are additive, not multiplicative, so each injured survivor adds 0.64 seconds. 22.56 seconds total to heal, 2.56 from Thana.
---
I don't think Thana is here for the healing time, not really. Sloppy does that. Thana is for if they leave people injured, adding 3.2/6.4/9.6/12.8 seconds to generator times, further multiplied by any failed Ruin checks. Thana, not Sloppy, is the one that should be dropped for BBQ if you want more blood points.
---
To be fair, the iterations on his default skin are better than most of anyone else's. The others tend to be literally just recolours, whereas for him textures and styles change quite a bit.
---
I suspect there haven't been very many Adam skins because they didn't sell well enough, with not many people playing Adam. I would play him more if he'd get a dread cosmetic like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9m3g6h/adam_francis_sora_robe_head_variants/?st=k45i6i7o&amp;sh=0b4c7691
---
Suddenly Waluigi Spirit?
---
BBQ is easy points, Ruin is "I don't want the game to end in 4 minutes if everyone just does gens." It shouldn't be much of a surprise. Ruin is basically mandatory if you want to have a chance to win.
---
So then using infinites are being a scumbag ?
---
Personally to only one that is annoying is ruin, it’s a really boring way to slow the game down and most of the time I hit the hex checks anyway. PGTW is so much more skill based and to me feels more interesting. The rest aren’t that bad. BBQ is literally just for BP
---
Are you pwrhaps around rank 10-15?
---
i ThInK wE hAvE dOnE a PrEtTy GoOd JoB sO fAr
---
I would usually mark it down as, like, a choice for the character, since you legitimately get people who speak like that in real life. The issue comes because they're using the same guy for EVERY STORY, so it's impossible to tell if it's intentional or just badly written and voiced. 
---
If they used different characters for different stories, and this guy did some of them, I feel like the weird pacing would work much better, because then it would more clearly be a character quirk as opposed to bad writing.
---
Its made kind of worse because its the only REAL spoken voice in the game so there's absolutely nothing to compare it to, and if they NOW released different characters with "better" voices, people aren't going to think "oh it was a character choice", they're going to think "oh the writing's much better now". There's kind of not an easy solution :(
---
I'll still do it even though most killers I face are ones who are still going to down me and then either mori me or hook me
---
U need invisibly in order to have success ??
---
I like rusty shackles hag jump scares :)
---
&gt; absolutely no counter play against Legion.
---
Literally just drop pallets early unless you know his power's down lol.
---
His face is already ugly enough
---
Yeah 
---
My lowest was rank 7 but recently been 10’s when my friend got the game
---
&gt; Let them downvote me, I'm right
---
"I'm right because I say so"
---
I wanna see them recording the sounds survivors make for plague.
---
Open handed is best used with a swf team. Everyone running it with kindred means a 48m read of the killer when someone is hooked. Its really fun :p
---
My man please tell you dont ACTUALLY think the wrait is some sort of top tier killer or his invisibility is a crutch or some shit.
---
It would be great if free pass had bloodpoints/shards as rewards
---
It is a guilty pleasure to use it, like rancor
---
Because it's not even as bad as old Legion. Old Legion did not have counterplay. Nemesis Legion does.
---
Wtf? Yes lol haha. But i mean, good job on finding it, and its jst as much BHVR's fault as yours but whatever lol, you will suffer no consequences.
---
But yeah abusing infinites is in fact toxic genius
---
My final message. Goodb ye
---
Oh yeah i forgot about wake up.
---
They didnt even help u? what dicks!
---
In my opinion it isn’t nonsense,
---
At the start of the game we can barely get one gen  done and perks like hex make that harder and I did say I’m not the best but I can never escape chases
---
If I 360 the killer I can only buy myself a couple of seconds and gen progression is hard with a lack of communication with d/c teammates or solo nea 😂 
---
And there is games where I just get hooked face camped and killed, I don’t really attempt escape to save the amount of chances I get on hook but then I die. I don’t think I’m great at the game but barely anyone I play with gets escapes either and stuff idk tho.
---
...or maybe he's secretly packing a sawn-off shotgun!
---
He does have an ugly sweater, its black with  red stripes, or, red with black stripes
---
He was overfixed.
---
The game was far more toxic at the games inception.   
---
I had a hiatus from the game just before Clown release because I found the killer role too exhausting.   
---
There were periods of time where as a killer you had to run a specific perk, the one I remember most prominently being Lightborn because if you didnt, you might NEVER hook someone because someone would be ready with a flashlight. You had to bring (iirc) Enduring to soften the edge for four Decisives. The Saboteur toolbox meta when hooks didn't respawn and there was no Hangmans Trick. There were infinites off the shack and no Bamboozle.   
---
Trust me, the game is a much better place than it was a long time ago.
---
Actually i think its mikey on the bikey
---
If this post doesn't have 420 up votes in 3 hours we riot
---
I just think blindness should not only prevent aura reading, should also visibly obscure a survivors vision after a certain distance. Actually make them, y'know. Blind
---
I mean leaked reworked add on, I should have written that new Obedience will instead of giving survivor Exhaustion will make Skill Check run Counter Clockwise
---
thank u i cant wait!
---
Bhvr does not care about perk balancing. Noed is not there only because we only get 4 slots.
---
Not defensive yet resorts to calling names like a child right. I don't think anyone should take you or your attitude seriously. Other people were having civil discussions about how it would be affected, not writing defensive/absusive paragraphs about it. Tell you what, you keep hiding in lockers and behind screens, like a child and I'll keep writing my opinions about how to keep the game fresh and not have the same loadouts over and over again which is a common complaint.
---
whenever i do something kinda scummy like that i always apologize and say why. survivors usually understand and don't get mad. like when i had 1 obsession kill left for my rift mission so i tunneled the shit out of the obsession just to make sure i got it done
---
On heals it is only around 1.3 seconds saved, however. 1.7 if they have Sloppy. Thana is just a pretty bad perk, always happy to see killers run it, knowing they are essentially on 3 perks.
---
If you use Resilience, yeah, definitely 99% heal to take advantage of any second you can get out of it, but just saying, Resilience without affecting vaults would never be worth running. There were a couple of months recently during which it did not affect vaults, and it was a trash-tier perk during that time.
---
If you leave all 4 of them to do gens and they refuse to heal then yeah. Not everyone's working on a gen, and you can at least assume one is busy being chased by you. 
---
25% of max gen progress regression in just a kick is so much more impactful than thana.
---
I like to think of it as a "surprise stealth skill test". And if I'm chased while dead on hook and spot an ally who is not, you better believe I'll try to get a bodyblock or some extra scratch marks at least. I would do it for them.
---
Getting the shards costs time and time is a resource you will never get back. Pay money or pay more. Either way it's not free, if you can't  have it without paying in some way
---
Also calling killers you can't play by default "free" limits our capabilities to easily differentiate between these killers and the ones that come with the main game or actually free DLCs
---
Bruh that picture is fire can we get the format?

If you playing killer and you know they have dead hard, just swipe, don't lunge.

whats this new trend of crying over bbq lol, just let us farm and read some auras kid, survivors over rank 15 knows to hide in a locker to avoid it anyways, is that easy to counter
---
I really love using Dark Devotion, it's especially great in combination with PWYF because you can smack your obsession then leave and have a speed boost in sneaking up on a survivor
---
Well I originally found it in a reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1mwin/how_it_feels_to_reload_as_clown/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). But there's also a video on youtube [aswell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRMRMlOM-n0).
---
Nice meme but you missed an oportunity to photoshop a harmless blunt weapon in place of his katana. Something like a sausage or a... banana.
---
I said DECREASES THE CHANCE it doesn’t ever guarantee as such. I’m rank 9 from reset and I still get paired with 20s from time to time. It happens and it’s kinda messed up but if you aren’t even playing and just DCing instantly just quit the damn game it’s not for you.
---
That would’ve been funny yeah
---
thats what spine chill will prevent, good luck
---
Me can't get hatches, me bulge keeping locker shut! Me can't open locker sideways!
---
I get more hatemail in this game than any other, and I used to play Dark souls and Bloodborne every day. 
---
I typically play 50/50 surv killer, I even get hatemail from *other survivors* saying I was trolling them. Sorry but if two of you play dumb and get downed and hooked in the basement against a trapper? GG buddy.
---
Idk, I just don't understand the mentality of people who have *adopted* the attitude of actively being a dick and flashlight taunting or teabagging at every opportunity.
---
Stop complaining and git gud. The devs are not gonna nerf every single killer just so you crybabbies can t bag at the gates and spam flashlights.
---
# THANOS TRAPPER
---
What about Legion? He’s basically a god.
---
imagine complaining about wraith
---
Not a bad idea, really. Never bothered with macros so far, since I consider them borderline cheating, but this is a case where I could ethically endorse it.
---
But it's not even appearing???
---
r/expanddong
---
This 100%. If theyre too busy trying to bait you, they aren't doing gens. My experience is also that they get desperate and start making mistakes. Then you go after their teammates who actually want to do gens and everything crumbles in your favour.
---
Nice
---
That's why I use it on wraith. To give them an incentive to heal and for some easy downs
---
Once you get out of low ranks you will see that this game is survivor sided
---
are you red rank? bc thats only rlly when gen speeds are a problem

Myers on them tires

The build is quite bad unless you‘re playing on Hawkins‘ or Lery‘s where it goes into fucking overdrive. If you‘re decent at playing JSM you won‘t lose on those maps. It‘s my most favorite build in the entire game, but it‘s only viable on those two exclusively. You have to abandon chases (unless you run PWYF and maybe Nemesis) and it encourages you to get injures passively by ambushing survivors at doorways.
---
Try tru3ta1ent strat and you will see what a beast Wraith is
---
Turn off chat
---
Bro idk what that bottom perk is and I know all survivor perks and almost all killer perks and it's driving me INSANE
---
Don't do that ,don't give me hope...
---
The question is, do you love people or hate people?
---
Me with the NOED challenge.
---
thank :)
---
Poor Oni-san.
---
Isnt itallowed for the killer to block a survivor?
---
Or maybe his back is so broken from all this Carry that it popped out?
---
As a Killer main i have deep respect for Solo Survivor mains because at least i can kill those toxic fucks, but they are in a Team with them, sort of relying on them.
---
Play your favorite characters because you want to and you want to bring your own vision and excitement to the game. Seek out your opponents and play hard and well with the ones you can sense are there for a good time. 
---
But know your gameplay, your presence as an opponent, is all predicated on mutual respect. Obviously tensions ebb and flow and games get messy; that's exciting. But when your gut tells you that the respect isn't there and the player is trying to push your buttons, you have to recognize it and breathe. Notice it and ignore it. I've thrown a few games because of bad trolls but honestly, they usually simmer down when they realize it doesn't work
---
Have empathy for yourself that you're still a sensitive and respectful person. Go in with the perspective that you're willing to OFFER your vision of a good time and surely you will come across great players to share it with. And if you don't like the way someone is treating you, leave them to twiddle their thumbs in cyberspace. It's their time they're wasting; don't waste yours. We need good minded players like you in the fog
---
So you have chosen death? But just push it, you will get your team just in trouble while they are in a chase
---
I mean, she already has the two best outfits in the game.
---
The shooting star memes were my favorite. Thanks for this.
---
Just STFU and go play on your rank 30
---
It was as i haven't had it happen in a while and i main tapper. This could be an old video pre the hot fix patch
---
The thing in this was fixed... if you read the hotfix notes or any patch notes past the nerfs and buffs you see that
---
Yui
---
Unfortunately you should never give survivors the last hatch because then they expect the hatch in other games which leads to toxic behavior.
---
too late, he got nerfed so you can't go around corners anymore
---
don't level him up because devs just destroyed him with the last nerf
---
No one left behind, situational but more chance of being used
---
So essentially BL didn't really matter on Haddonfield? I'm picky because it because I really dislike ungrounded statements that people might not even truly believing themselves while still stating it
---
yes https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/eajf53/neonlight_icon_with_semi_transparent_perks/
---
I remember we had a DC, so the three of us did this with Pig Momma leading us around to generators. It was amazing.
---
Sounds like you need a break from competitive games in general. If you can’t disregard what a stranger says/does over the internet that you’ll likely never meet again competitive multiplayer games just aren’t for you. I’m not trying to be an asshole here, just making a suggestion. I think you should play a relaxing singleplayer title for a while. Try out Death Stranding, that could definitely be something for you.
---
I wouldn't want to be that killer, that must have hurt
---
This was a meme lol I know which one is better, but thanks anyways
---
Yo this same shit happened to me not too long ago. I thought it was just me lagging
---
JESUS CHRIST DUDE YOU FUCKING KILLED HIM
---
Anti tunnel btw
---
Oh, that's Iron Will. I've made it a personal goal for myself to find an anime image for every perk in the game because I'm a degenerate. I've got Leader, DS, BT, WGLF, Iron Will, and Balanced Landing so far.
---
As a Cannibal main: Let's face it he isn't that bad of a nerf unless I missed something while I was gone. He might suck, but he is a fun meme killer for lower ranks and BBQ is kinda the best thing about him.
---
Wait what? Hasnt PC had dedicated servers for months?
---
What about noed your forgetting noed
---
If you do this you srent allowed to complain about tbagging
---
I've never encountered that invincibility stuff, but sometimes autoaim is a bit stupid and makes me hit the person being rescued during their natural invincibility period when I'm actually trying to go for the rescuer
---
Toxic survivor much? Hahaha na jokes I woulda done the same thing
---
other survivors messaged me after the game saying how much they were lagging as well
---
DBD is an extrodinarily unbalanced and unoptimized game. Survivors and killers get mad at each other when we should just be mad at the devs
---
Hm, well I know for a fact in this clip that infectious fright causes Jane to be frozen so they might of used it for yours. I don't know.
---
Going for the "take one for the team" achievement.  You basically bave to hook bomb
---
I agree with you 100%, I am a survivor main but I do play killer from time to time. I had a Freddy yesterday that was just fantastic, he didn’t camp or slug even when it was down to just two of us. We both died, in the chat I told him gg and that he was a great killer.  When I have a toxic killer like one that you described shutting the hatch in front of me.  In the end game chat I usually just put lol, gg!  I don’t bitch in chat, people like that want you to get angry. I don’t ever give them that satisfaction. I also don’t-bag I just leave.  
---
I notice some killers go out of their way to give you a fighting chance, and I think those killers should be recognized and it seems to me they rarely are.
---
This is cool but I wouldn’t wanna see a massive influx of people only playing certain survivors at certain ranks, the fact that there’s variety and some aren’t too weak vs too strong is good bc we don’t wanna end up like killer where only 4 are viable at red ranks
---
Why they did so hard adept killers omfg
---
Litteraly all they had to do was make deep wound be based on a 32 meter radius and not be terror radius based, but i guess nerfing the killer to the ground works :)))
---
Oh my...
---
I forgot who Adam was thats how little people play him
---
Where do i get mobile
---
Is plague even good?
---
if they get one Claudette should totally have a handicap.
---
like slower running speed or repair skills.
---
He did say sanctum of Wraith instead of Wrath...I think it was an invisible joke.
---
Do you have any evidence they aren’t using dedicated servers on the Xbox Live Connect platform?
---
As someone who just got back in the game, please send help. Like we need survivors 61
---
Yeah you need ps plus to play
---
Or maybe it’s a spine erection due to staring at pantless Myers and thicc clown
---
once my friend was being tunneled by a wraith all game and the other two survivors and I just took turns taking hits for her at just the right moments so she could keep going and consistently rushing gens and we all got out. so proud of the teamwork honestly
---
Yes and no. A lot of people using the perk see being being injured as a really bad thing and they must heal themselves before they are able to do something else. This causes generators not to be done when they should be prioritised, people reaching struggle phase on first hook and basicly very selfish play in general.
---
Imagine a situation where there is 1 gen left and you are being chased. You go down after a 45 second chase and as soon as you are downed you see 3 people selfcaring when they couldve done a gen in that time.
---
The perk isn’t bad, it’s the people using it are the worst teammates.
---
It says Adam..
---
* dead hard
---
* not too useful
---
like, if you try to run at the killer and make them whiff with dh complain that dh is bad because latency or killer has a brain then i don't know what to say. it's the undisputed best exhaustion perk
---
How fresh.
---
They love campers, this isn’t surprising
---
I'm too old for this shit!
---
It was still Ace at the time, disregard it then.
---
You seem to be stuck in this closet. Authorise me to assist you out of said closet for your personal health
---
the visual effect for clown doesnt do much for him, people can still see through it. It's really just annoying imo
---
Was a obvious typo... that’s why I put *
---
I’ve never really used it as survivor, but it’s easy to counter it as killer by just breathing down their nexts before they dh.
---
not sure what to say. it only extends a chase by about 1 second when the person doesn't know how to use it properly, or doesn't have anywhere to go even when using it for distance, which is their mistake for running in an unsafe area
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eaki2n/dark_sense_challenge_should_only_be_2_gens/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It is currently the worst map in game, for me personally. As a survivor there are no places to loop, nowhere to run, death zones everywhere. As for the killer, its easy win. Especially if you make game lighter with computer settings, they wont hide
---
I think it’s usually funny but I hate when I run a killer for 2-3 gens and they nod when they finally down me like they actually did something. pet peeve tbh. BUT my favorite thing is when they nod in my camera angle while I’m being sacrificed lol that shit looks so goofy
---
Yeah all that makes sense, I figured it may be better in low ranks but as you get to higher ranks your teammates are more reliable to heal you too.
---
Too many survivors I see use it the wrong way, and only against Trapper I’ve seen them jump across traps and safely run to the exit. The perk is just annoying to play against for me
---
no.. what you said about dead hard is not true at all
---
yeah i don’t know why people think he’d be a good father figure, he’d probably just bash her head in for being part of his bloodline without being a respectable samurai
---
Just got the adept a few minutes ago, extremely challenging. I have to mention that I am playing windowed, on 0% resolution. It's a pain sometimes
---
Srry didn’t know that fuck me
---
I personally don't think that nerf was so huge. I mean I felt the diffrence but for me Oni is still top 5 killer.
---
Sure
---
why did I read this in the samination wraith voice
---
How exactly would that work?
---
Do they spawn into a trial and scream "I'M HERE I'M QUEER AND I'M READY TO CAUSE SOME FEAR!"
---
I'll ask my dad who knows the Trapper irl. I'm sure we can figure something out.
---
Exactly
---
The killer doesnt kill anyone, they just slap them and the survivor faints.
---
Not if you play Nurse/Hillbilly/Spirit
---
I believe thats for Friday the 13th not Nightmare on Elm Street
---
I swear somebody already posted something like this yesterday
---
i can see that becoming problematic. i would rather have no survivors orientation or gender identity specified, just like they are now. for all you know, they’re might not be any straight characters at all. plus, it might be tricky to work pansexuality into a killers lore. i’m gay and honestly if i was made into a character i couldn’t see my sexuality influencing much of how i was presented at all.
---
I think she's definitely at least higher mid. I get 4ks with her much more easily than with anyone else I've tried.
---
nice troll lmao
---
and let's say you mindgamed them on a loop and you're supposed to get a hit but they just dh for distance and drop the pallet, basically an extra health state just in case you fuck up as surv
---
She's around Myers-Ghost Face. If you get survivors that let you have your power she's pretty powerful, but usually you don't so you're just permanently able to one shot people who are easier to track.
---
But that isn't as big as it sounds. You don't have the increased vault speed or extended lunge of a T3 Myers, and basically every stealth killer can get the first hit so easy that they might as well have one shots like that on top of then having powers that help in a chase. Plus super good survivors often don't heal anyways and instead focus on just pushing gens as hard as possible, and keeping people broken pushes survivors to play super efficiently like that.
---
Basically yeah she's good, but she's not Billy or Freddy or even Huntress good. Without corrupt purge there's really nothing special she can do outside of counteracting Iron Will.
---
You can pull some shit with her addons though. The apples can let you do some very nasty shit to a team that refuses to cleanse and the black incense is the best tracking add on in the game.
---
How would DBD help? What helps the gay community?
---
Think how many killers would target the gay survivor, it would be horrible.
---
You haven't explained anything or expanded on your idea. Think this was done cause you're bored.
---
If something is free but you have to work for it it’s not really free is it.
---
I mean, sexuality really has no place in this kind of game; it serves no purpose whatsoever. But putting that aside, they've never said any of the existing characters were straight to my knowledge,  so how do you know there aren't any gay ones already?
---
You can remember who has it easily and just wait until they use it to try to lunge, they still might get the pallet if they’re fast enough but not always
---
Rightfully so imo
---
quit coward
---
Added a source, and edited my comment. Elm street also had a court battle
---
Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Pop Goes the Weasel, and BBQ for bp. If I don't stack gen slowing perks, matches in red ranks are over in three minutes, that's insane.
---
Yeah i saw that Elm street had one previously but couldn’t find any evidence of it still being in one which confused me a bit.
---
Wasn’t trying to call you a liar or anything
---
He could occasionally see aura flickers of random people on the map? 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Please make more of these.
---
I'm usually against taunting, but if I escape when the killer facecamps and tunnels me I teabag like there is no tomorrow
---
Nah, my bad. Didn't know it had finished.
---
And no attack meant from me either, I follow politics reddits so I'm used to having to provide sources
---
Look at the title
---
I don’t see a problem with this but I don’t see a reason for it. No characters have a sexuality or sexual preference. I’m not saying that’s a bad or good thing, I’m just saying. I think it’s best if we just imagine that some characters are part of the lgtb+ community rather than creating it. I’m bisexual too so don’t think I’m just some hater on the idea. I have a theory nea is gay anyway tbh. BHVR doesn’t have to act on that though
---
Sounds like either unnerving presence or you may have equipped brand new part
---
i think you mean poo thyself
---
No I mean someone already made the killer version of this
---
I didn't even noticed that in the title until now. Lol, good catch.
---
Yes and I highly suggest getting the game it’s sweet
---
Oooohhh. Sorry i figured no-one made one for Killer, my bad.
---
too bad pablo rodriguez isnt in the game
---
nah no need for apologies man I just wanted to make sure you weren’t meme stealing or something, still a good meme!
---
I don’t think people would target the “gay” survivor. I think killers would target any survivor that deemed fit for killing in the situation but I get what you mean. I can see trolls just going after the gay survivor for jokes and end up ruining a gamer’s experience. And I can see survivors claiming they get tunneled harder than everyone else bc of the character’s sexuality
---
lol whats wrong with u ppl that this got 42 upvotes
---
Doctor is black, so is hag.
---
Repost
---
well it feels like the servers in dbd are in a taco bell 🔔
---
What do you mean repost?
---
She's higher mid tier for sure. If you happen to use her best add-ons, which are the Emetics and her UR the Black Incense along with a good perk build I would consider her as touching the very bottom of top tier.
---
She counters any and all stealth perks, survivors puking up a storm are heard super easily and no perk silences that, not to mention anything they touch or hide in becomes infected so you can easily tell which locker they're hiding in. Add on top of that that she also counters any and all healing methods as well if people choose not to cleanse, you can theoretically make people's entire builds + items useless just by playing Plague which is a significant advantage.
---
I find people don't give her enough credit and I don't see why. While I can see she's not the best killer, she has some really unique tools that help her keep consistent pressure and make things unsafe that allows for easy snowball and tracking.
---
There's 2 (3?) types of Auras for Survivors
---
**Actual auras-** the entire Survivor is shown. It's like BBQ or Bond, so your whole body is shown. If you're in a Trapper trap they see you (even withCalm Spirit). Also Distortion doesn't work if you're "incapacited" and since that includes Trapper traps you can't hide
---
**Scream Auras-** these are just Loud Noise notifications, like when a gen is finished or when a Survivor fast-vaults. Since they happen when you make a loud noise (like screaming), and Calm Spirit *prevents* you from making that loud noise, your aura won't be shown.
---
**Killer Instinct-** when you reveal Ghostface, are on top of a Demogorgon portal or when Legion is in Frenzy (after stabbing someone), they'll get Killer Instinct, which is hard to explain, but basically they can see you even if you have Distortion or are in a Locker.
---
Btw Hag traps don't show your aura/scream/Killer Instinct, but there are addons that show your aura after stepping on a trap. Doctor also has addons that show your Aura after your Madness increases. Also Clown and Doctor get points for hitting a Survivor with their powers, so they can know your general area if they're paying attention
---
Calm Spirit is a bad perk though. Sorry for the wall of text, good luck!👏👏👏
---
Adam and Jeff get an average of one cosmetic per year.
---
Tell me about it haha
---
Thanks man, have a good one!
---
no. BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why we recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons.
---
Rank reset was all I needed to do it for me.
---
I can almost guarantee it’s because of their network code and not dedicated servers. Either way, if someone is lagging it throws off their interactions with everything so it’s not like the killer being the host or a separate server being the host fixes that.
---
This happened with P2P too, but at least back then the killer would correct it with a hit immediately. Now it's just "aight, guess I missed, will try another time"
---
At random Quentin will fall asleep and the player will lose control of him for up to 15 minutes.
---
Running noed on Bubba?
---
***Why***
---
Aah I love that variant you know the black really goes well with the black and oh wait more black 🙃🙃🙃🙃
---
i think that’s what he’s talking about. the invincibility thing when they get unhooked is so annoying.
---
I’ve been playing for two years and I’m only devotion 4
---
Not sure if it’s a DBD or steam thing but anyone know why I have to launch DBD through steam and not a shortcut otherwise it says steam offline?
---
Ah but that’s the big fat problem. On Console this map for Killer is honestly the worst IMO. Like I hate both of the Yamaoka maps but the newer one is ridiculously dark. Like I basically give up now when I’m sent there
---
the torture is probably for the more reluctant / tragic killers. I highly doubt it’d care much for messing with Ghostface. Guy is already an irredeemable psychopath.
---
While this is hilarious, it is the small tonal problem with the game. Killers are an absolute joke to these people. Imagine stabbing a gigantic demon, then pushing past him to get into a locker, just to smack him in the face with the door.
---
Strafing right or left helps me maneuvering around the map with it
---
Why? he gets a speed boost and his chainsaw is not really good. besides 1 hit hammer &gt; Chainsaw most of the times.
---
thats the worst one
---
This map is amazing I see you actually manage to hit a Claudette good job I hope you won that game
---
This reddit always jumps to conclusions. Every time. Nurse is dead, Spirit is dead... yeah right...
---
So glad the wraith is looking out for him.
---
Glowing pile of bones 😂😂
---
XD
---
Happened something quite similar to me a few days ago.
---
In the 20 minutes queue times, I decided to go and watch some tv, in another room, so the game started, when I finally came back the game was already done, just one gen to go in the next few seconds. I was using the oni, I chased a guy and downed him.
---
then someone tried to open the door, so I rushed and downed the survivor. it was the only kill i got.
---
But for some reason that survivors was mad and threatening to report me for bad sportmanship.
---
Oh yeah those two.
---
Its ridiculous how long some of them have been bugged for and nothing is done about it.
---
Please give my baby boy Quentin a speedo, he wears it in the movie, he’s a swimmer, it would make sense.
---
r/bonehurtingjuice
---
Just do the bones.
---
I agree with you. He complains a lot and just makes for an overall bad watching experience imo, I prefer to watch Otz, No0b3, or Ussylis for my content.  know of any other good streamers/youtubers?
---
lol what else you could do? wait for them to run out and get no points? there is always one salty person in this game complaining :D
---
That would be unbalanced because some people have better teachables than others. Wraith would get nothing helpful, even a free tier 3 of any of his perks would make no difference at all. Ace’s perks would make almost no difference at all (luck is useless, 4m aura reading is nothing, tier 1 ace in the hole is useless).
---
Then take into account perks that are easy to play around. Adam getting a “free” tier 1 deliverance would not matter because the killer would know its coming.
---
Survivors already have advantages over others. Claudette is better at stealth and Ace has built in Iron Will. Trying to give them bonuses is a really bad idea.
---
If you do five bones than yeah the perk is gone but let's say that maybe you cant find one or he has TOTH than he has a really hidden noed that you cant get. I feel that you shouldn't be punished this hard for essentially beating the killer and doing the gens
---
+right
---
Teachables already encourage that. Claudette has a perk that heals people faster and a perk that lets you see injured survivors. It already encourages you to level up and play Claudette if you want to be a medic
---
His flick is what allowed him to counter loops somewhat, now without that when facing skilled survivors he’s just a gimped hillbilly on a cooldown.  He’s a lot weaker without his flick.
---
That scream was the spider's.
---
if u "beated" the killer doing the gens then u sure had lots of extra time to find the last totem
---
I mean when I was new to the game I got fairly mad at noed as well, but after time it got fairly easy to predict whether the killer has noed or not. 
---
l It all comes down to how well he is contesting gens and overall how well he's playing and whether he is good at ending chases or not. If the killer is doing badly then more often than not he will have noed.
---
I'm right because the changes were in fact good and an overall buff.
---
Oni’s flick is what allowed for a skillcap to him and gave him antilooping potential, now without it he gets absolutely fucked by good survivors who position themselves correctly.
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
Bone hurting juice would be proud of you
---
Is it tho? 16 seconds before it takes effect and has a use time? And if you’re downed it’s effect doesn’t activate. Can someone explain how it’s useful unless you know you can escape a chase every time?
---
lady lunatic nurse spinning must be the cutest thing
---
That's not what I'm talking about. This is innate skills not perks. Each person has some innate ability that cannot be transferred. Not a perk. Some built in skill that is can only be used on that survivor. Just like the legion cannot set traps. Obviously not as strong as the killer perks but something to push people to strategically play other people because there is a benefit to playing that person outside of cosmetics.
---
Well. You dont want to be a stinky dweet do you?
---
dont get it
---
Take one for the team, aka be a complete dick to your team. Basically last achievement I need
---
I use to do this often until I got a message one day accusing me of teaming up with the survivor that I let escape. 🙄 Now, it's a rare occasion
---
Their balance team is absolute shite. Which is a shame because their design team is fantastic...

His lunge is literally the same as all other killers. And they just nerfed his add-ons
---
Yeah that’s what I use it for, ruin gets taken out really fast anyway or people don’t do gens or they do just fine with ruin active. To me PGTW is much more useful and skill based
---
Nice defenatly using this

I swear, playing against purple/red survivors makes you think Borrowed time is Default Kit

Most killers run ruin, and that can be gone in 20 seconds. I never said you should run it every game, it’s just not horrible

Xbox- Lifting a pallet with “Any means necessary” while suffering from deep wounds will drain the timer even when in the killer’s terror radius
---
Found out when i suddenly dropped dead while trying to be cheeky against a legion
---
The eternal issue with this suggestion regardless of when it's asked is that this will further create a meta in a game that's beyond dull and repetitive. I'm already sick of seeing Claudette, Nea, and Feng every fucking match: I'd get even more sick of it if Claud healed 10% faster, Nea used items 10% slower, or Feng had a short-ranged Premonition built into her kit.
---
In theory Behaviour will make all the characters have unique abilities that are strong enough in their own right to all be competitively viable but... this is Behaviour fucking Interactive we're talking about. They shipped Steve's perks in the state they are currently in and gave By Any Means Necessary a 2 minute cool-down. I expect characters like Meg to recover Exhaustion 20% faster while characters like Quentin will be able to see the exit gates auras before they're powered.
---
What happened after?
---
No Ed on a insta down killer really big brain you got there
---
&gt;playing plague without cosmetics and getting a 0k
---
Fixed
---
I love when the survivor who dies last accuses me of tunneling them
---
Still bugged...
---
u are right, i mean, no one picks a character just because he/she is straigth or bi or whatever, people in general are much more than just their sexual orientation.
---
booli
---
Nah hope isn’t horrible, but it definitely is neither op nor top tier. It is however a niche perk that can be either very valuable in certain circumstances. I personally wouldn’t recommend running both, and I don’t even usually run adrenaline so I definitely don’t run hope.
---
They look so strange, they don’t have the same charm as the frosty eyes, but I hope other players enjoy them.
---
I don't know why but i'm hooked on this...
---
Keep replaying it over and over
---
Fair enough
---
Bro you are talking about a game where a wood pallet stops  2 Meter tall Monsters that are buf as fuck.
---
Bro what do you mean "the killer doesn't have the power role" that's so cringe now let me play Nurse and Spirit
---
was brown toolbox with no addons? killer had unnerving or overcharge?
---
Ooooh, that melody reminds me of Pokémon, but i don't remember when and where it played .\_\_.
---
Ngl I kinda wish we had Ruby myself
---
If you choose bubba it's because you want to use his power, but that doesn't means that NOED &gt; Bubba's chainsaw.
---
he is not as proficent with his oneshots like other killers, so I say he is the only one where actually you might beneffit from using it.
---
How about you make something other than your sexuality the forefront of your identity? Nobody gives an honest fuck where you put your genitals, so stop subjecting us to idpol warfare and claiming oppression at every chance.
---
Also, nice b8 m8 i r8 8/8
---
To be fair to the guy he does kill grown men too, and with surprising ease. But he is still like... a guy. One that takes an absurd amount of punishment but a guy none the less so yeah I agree. Ash.
---
Nemesis is from Resident Evil 3.
---
Bill isn't on there (yet), so it's only natural they use the placeholder icons
---
You may want to try verifying game integrity and/or reinstalling the whole game.
---
did u just made public my secret rank 1 in a week build?
---
Oh yeah, well my grandpa knows kung fu.
---
3 games in a row where each killer got all 4 people only because of NOED? Doubt. 
---
The only way that happens that much is if you just kind of let it happen 
---
Also do totems
---
I’m the endgame you don’t always have the time to stalk people. You want to down as many people as possible as quickly tbh
---
Quintin is disgusting and his mains deserve no love
---
Smh toxic killers tunneling two people at once
---
When you right click the shortcut and look at properties, what is in the "Target" field?
---
it has no place in 99.9% of interactions, yet it's all we hear about constantly from these types. i know this post is likely a troll, but still a lot of people identify themselves by their sexuality because they are simply boring as fuck and under achieve, so they lie to themselves that society is the reason for their lack of fulfillment and project it onto others. add in a generation of susceptible adhd youth and you have identity politics on rampage. they think people react to them negatively because of their sexuality, when its really just their personality and social skills.
---
24 foot huntress cock 😩😩😩
---
This is why survivors run swfs. This happens ALL THE TIME.
---
I can feel your pain. Dying on the first hook is frustrating.
---
The easiest buff for trapper is to just let him start with all his traps.
---
Using distressing and wondering how you lost
---
Dude , you actually thought you can express you opinion and have a mature response? HERE?
---
Hahahahshafunny number 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 FUNNY NUMBER JAHAHA WHOLESOME 100 THANJS FOR 😂😂 GOLD
---
It's your own damn fault for being in the basement.
---
Man me yesterday. I was trying to that noed challenge and everyone was farming and letting me two hook them. I couldn’t betray them like that. I let them all live.
---
This is pretty accurate to my experience.
---
Glad I have the platinum 😅
---
Lmao I guess I was over optimistic
---
Bloodlust only exists and needs to exist because of horrible level design. I just want them to fix the shitty infinites. They're all easily removable by just.. removing a window. The only thing holding these near-infinite loops together is a single, badly thought out window.
---
Remove coal towers window, the preschools fence vault, etc, and the loops are actually reasonable.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
yeah I've had many survivors straight up say it was bullshit i shoulda downed them. they don't know how i didnt get them either. imo the survivor being unhooked shouldn't block the one doing the unhooking esp since they seem to block in a 360 very often
---
Your blood is weak.
---
You’ve got an itch? Let me scratch that for you.
---
Cleanse totems, bring detective's hunch or small game to find them, spine chill to help you get away from thrill totems in time or do the dull ones first. It's one of the easiest countered perks, you just have to do the counter.
---
I shouldn't have to bring a perk or multiple perks to counter a perk that the killer may or may not have
---
Didn't have it before this game, shouldn't have to run perks to help my teamates not be brainless in the first place though to be honest.
---
A comeback is not the same thing as one shotting survivors to the point where you are almost guaranteed at least one kill
---
I am also very proud of you
---
so if survivors play it cool and position themselves correctly they should die anyway because of the killers movement?
---
But you said "the concept of winning after playing poorly shouldnt exist"
---
This implies that comebacks should not exist.
---
Noed is fine fam, do the bones. They give BP and everything.
---
Nemesis is a thing now. Getting stacks is easy
---
He's hiding Iago in there trying to convince Aladdin to get him the lamp. Or something like that. Who knows...
---
I imagine the legions blighted skin would be that the serum had deformed and fused all 4 members together like a sorta Frankenstein monster with glowy bits
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ealshr/so_iridescent_age_isnt_working_as_survivor_is/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You can say do the bones for any hex perk yet ruin is still considered one of the best perks in the game
---
They changed the way deep wounds worked it’s not tied to terror radius
---
PS4 trophy medic still unattainable
---
Ruin is considered good because its passive gen slowdown, which doesnt really exist anywhere else.
---
Even then people hate running it because it disappears in 30 seconds most games
---
I make it my mission to make sure a teammate never hits second stage on their first hook even if that means I have to trade places with them. Although no one really does the same for me.
---
omg ur mind
---
Time Traveler too: Jason? He's boring as shit. Xenomorph tho, so fun
---
But you dont hear people saying ruin is bad cause all you have to do is do the totems
---
God I've had many robbed grabs because of dedicated servers. I'll be asking the specific survivor in the end game chat if they thought I should have grabbed them or not and they say no or don't say anything. 
---
I can get some grabs off if I pray to the entity but other than that it's butterfingers.
---
Then ya got survivor side with the bad hit boxes and other things. Everyone is dealing with weird stuff :(.
---
I feel ya. I just came back after a long ass hiatus, to the point where I decayed to Rank 20, and my queues are painfully long.
---
Hey what movie/show is Ash at!?
---
Ty dad 🥺
---
Depends on rank. Lower ranks (15-20) everybody wants to play killer so queues are horrible. I got to rank 10 and queues were fantastic, then there was the rank reset and I'm now at like rank 16 and my queues are 10+ minutes. Considering I want to play more casually/for-fun it's gonna be a huge pain trying to get back to a decent queue time.
---
Alot of people say ruin is bad because it's a totem. That's the main reason people dont run it.
---
But man I love those 10-30 seconds it buys so much
---
Yezmika my mind is very lagre
---
Lmao when I had to do get for self care I heard it a lot haha.
---
It depends on the rank and platform. I never have long queues anymore no matter what I play as. The longest maybe being 8-10 minutes on a rare occasion.
---
Ash VS Evil Dead. You can watch it on Amazon Prime
---
It's just getting real god damn tired when you pay for a killer who is immediately changed from the killer you paid for, even if it's not as bad as, say, Freddy. Survivors always play the same at base, you're just picking a skin. 
---
Nerfs when a killer is so new just feels so reactionary. They should only be nerfed if either Killers hate playing them (Freddy) or Survivors hate facing them for an extended period (Since there's variety in who they face) like Mending Legion
---
People run ruin all the time. What?
---
You’re right. I did forgot that asking for proof of something is a snobby thing to do on Reddit. My bad. Now, what I just did is called being condescending.
---
gollum outfit for quentin. do it bhvr
---
Short queue time
---
through a damn window too... like 3 steps later wtf
---
Funny as shit my dude, keep it up.
---
I am given the hatch as survivor if my teammates were bad and I give the hatch to people if someone dc
---
Would be something different tweaks would be needed and a community vote on 20 perks would be needed also i feel killer perks should also be voted on as well add ons dont really matter and no offerings other than map or chest, hook type offerings
---
bug by buglight
---
She just noped on out of that soon to be chase
---
Exactly, I think a good buff would be make his normal BF lunge more similar to T3 Myers. The weird lunge he has now is atrocious
---
Nope, it persisted until the match was over
---
looking for people saying you deserve this or that for playing the game well
---
Nope, there were 2 gens left but I was playing with a bunch of rank 17’s so I didn’t expect to win.
---
Your gambling like 70 points for 2500
---
There is nothing intelligent or thoughtful about your "suggestion".  It literally amounts to you know that perk that was nerfed so we could counter it easily with the locker update?  Well I still hate it so it should be 2 perks because I'm that 1% of the community that despises it.  There's nothing thoughtful about that.  You didn't create an intelligent post for amazing discussion here.  It's just a salty player venting about a perk they don't like.  Nothing more.
---
The dev stream was before it came out on switch where they said they want to add it to pc and if it works it will be on all platforms and if it doesn't they will just do PC and might do it with switch (to get multiple forms of testing) it was on Reddit somewhere but like I said this was before the dedicated servers were even in the game so it might be hard to find but I think you can go back and skim the streams around when there was first talk about dedicated servers.
---
Spooky beyblade
---
I quite like Father Campbell's too, varied map with the church and carnival elements, and is one of the fairest maps imo.
---
I really fucking hate Coldwind though, just all of them, because I have never been able to see through the corn properly and I always lose people in them.
---
Ok. But it still doesn’t address either of my comments that had the same question. It may just be that we have no idea what’s really happened because they’re not communicating.
---
I appreciate the explanation on the Switch.
---
Probably around 250k-300k
---
why would u only notice that
---
He clearly doesn’t have any other leveled perks, and so what if he uses more anyways
---
Well ,I don't.
---
Was forced to use it to complete the tome challenge.
---
Entity ashamed!
---
It’s quite interesting how I’m having a conversation with others who aren’t as fragile as you are and am able to get somewhere concerning the dedicated server situation. 
---
I hope you’re not this fragile in real life. It sounds like the quickest way to be curled up crying all day because someone asked you a question and you started crying.
---
If Wake Up let's you do jojo poses I need to start running it more often.
---
You really need to get laid, man.
---
No dude you don't understand, its more important to make sure new players have fast queues than making sure they have a good time. It's perfectly acceptable to put this rank 17 solo survivor, 2 rank 15 solo survivors, and rank 9 solo survivor in the same game against a rank 10 killer. Even if it makes the rank 9 have a miserable fucking experience and quit the game because hes so fucking sick of running into teammates that do nothing except urban around the map and spend a combined 2 minutes self caring in a corner instead of doing the fucking generators. 
---
What do you mean the killers heartbeat is across the map? I better hide behind this wall instead of doing anything useful. Wonder what that rank 9 teammate of mine is up to, hes been injured with those little white lines around his icon wiggling for the past 5 minutes. Is it some sort of bug??
---
This is pretty great. Nostalgia aswell.
---
Oh its Eeekans!
---
They were so cute! Especially the Dwight with one of his sweaters. He was too pure for what I had planned.
---
Just a little bit ;)
---
If for three matches the Killer got (i'm assuming) all 4 Survivors when gates were powered that sounds more like you and the other Survivors screwed up so badly and just let it happen more than "NOED is a problem"
---
And for a perk that does nothing 90% of the match and can be disabled before it even does anything (meaning the Killer practically only had 3 perks) you should really consider doing bones. (and telling the other Survivors to cleanse one if they can)
---
You have Small Game and Detective's Hunch for perks to help you find totems.
---
Don't want to use a perk? Bring in a map with Red Twine.
---
Don't want to use an item? You can always learn where totems usually spawn on each map so you have a general idea of where to look.
---
And why should you cleanse a totem? Inner Strength gives a pocket heal for cleansing a totem, 1000 Boldness per totem if you're not too confident in being chased, and a small Lightbringer bonus.
---
Actually Amanda (The Pig) wasn't strong enough to hook him properly, so that happened instead.
---
Yeah, a cheap ass down that no one wants to play against. No survivor wants to be chased around only to bleed out cause the Legion is exploiting the deepwounds mechanic. That shit is boring.
---
I know you’re saying your queues are long.
---
I mean what are you trying to say about the archives?
---
Thanks. Autocorrect.
---
You haven't said shit to correct me. I'm sure if you looked at my comments on other posts and shit you'll find my reasoning for why I believe the changes to Legion were an overall buff. Or you can state why you think he got nerfed and then I can provide a counter arguement. Just like how I can't say my statement is right, you just can't say my statement is wrong lmao.
---
So are bill and ace, and ash even but nobody complains about them
---
It's not dedicated servers, I have the same Problem on console, they simply disabeld the grabs
---
I know I can bring DS or borrowed as a survivor, but I just unlocked DS and don’t have borrowed... I can’t get DS in my bloodwebs! I leveles 1 person 4 lvl50’s and I still didn’t get it... as a killer, I use noed, but all totems get destroyed before the match is in endgame collapse. Some other meta perks I don’t really have, and I don’t like to facecamp, and tunnelling gets countered by survivors’ BT
---
Anyone else having this, every match a SWF group, it’s inevitable...
---
This is why you run unbreakable
---
nothing that's just a meme
---
I am just wondering how are your killer queues instand when I'm here 15 minutes into the queue still not getting any survivors?
---
second I typed this I **FINALY** got a survivor group
---
Ah, absolutely right sir. Sorry for the inconvenience, I will be getting my botany knowledge license soon.
---
Yeah they tried covering it up of what is going on but they will come "soon" it will be apart of the patch notes whenever it does come to Xbox and PS4 so you can keep a eye out for that if you want to tell if it has been released yet or not. Also with bhv if they say a date and can't do that they will wait till the last minute (halloween event, dbd mobile or they will try and hope people forget about it dedicated server, Freddy getting a rework years ago) basically don't believe bhv till it is in the patch notes
---
I think some people forget that a window is... Well, a window. An open space.
---
Can only grab injured people off a window or pallet. Can grab anyone off a gen
---
As a Plague main with plenty of cosmetics for her, I see this as a complete win
---
What is a red twine? Otherwise thanks for the tips
---
Wait what happened to him I’ve been gone
---
I need to do this. Did you 3d print the switch?
---
They're not wood pallets. If you stop and look at them, they're iron railroad track bars and rebar pinched between boards all tied together with ropes.
---
The fake grab has been going on since middle of last year on ps4 and we don't even have dedicated servers. It's so bad that your arm gets stuck in the grab animation sometimes and the only way to cancel out of it is to swing your weapon. 
---
This isn't a dedicated server issue. This is an overall issue that has been in the game and the devs won't fix. The challenges that make you get grabs sucked. I had to farm that shit because the grab mechanics are busted as fuck.
---
"Babe come to bed" "hold on it's only at 48%" BRRRRRRRRRRRRNG
---
Favorite is sloppy butcher and least favorite is tenacity
---
If only everyone was more like you.
---
Pig was my first choice and now my main. Her power slows the game down well enough so you don't need ruin, since her traps are for keeping survivors off gens (if they have a trap on, they have about 2 minutes after a gen is completed to get it off. Being chased, hooked or downed pauses the timer). Typically you should trap one survivor ASAP, pressure the gens, use 2 traps mid-late game, and use the final one at the very end so they can't escape unless they get it off. Although it does depend on the situation.
---
You play her right, she'll be able to keep decent pressure on a team. Although I'd say Billy is a decent choice for a new killer. Being able to cross the map in a matter of seconds is pretty big. 
---
Trapper is good but if you don't place his traps well, you've just got a killer with a weapon and nothing else. 
---
Nurse punishes you hard for your mistakes so if you're not confident, wait a bit before you give her a go.
---
Stress level 99
---
Rank 10 far less than 5 minutes. Like 20 seconds. Bullshit as in unfair or lame? Yeah, but bullshit as in untrue no, not in my experience. You probably got rank 9 survivors because the game was trying to find them a killer and couldnt find any at that rank. When I was rank 10 I regularly would play with rank 5-6
---
How did you get that reward?
---
There really should be a brief stun immunity timer for killers. Even 1 quick second.
---
i’m scared to watch streamers play bcus all the do is attempt to loop and get hit, and watching them at night injured literally sounds like porn.
---
This is more of a git gud post
---
Again? I mean. If you’re offering I think I’ve had a long enough time to recover.
---
Lol there is nothing intelligent about you or type paragraphs. Salty killer main.
---
&gt; Freddy is literally the strongest killer right now. Chill.
---
Nurse.
---
Darn. Okay I think can find with that info, thank you.
---
Fake Grabs drive me crazy.  Not in that I don't get the grab.   But that it forcefully changes a swing into a grab, and then I get neither.  
---
At least if you are going to take the grab away from me, count it as a hit on the survivor.
---
With full stacks of bbq, about 5 matches maybe 6.
---
Was anyone else hoping we'd hear the T3 tier up and she'd get a knife to the face?
---
Cause I don't like campers. All they do is killing the fun... So I felt that it needed to be said. Shitty Matchmaking kills the fun to though...
---
the only way u could possibly turn that switch that fast is if... gasp. ure a killer irl
---
I like how y'all just hide in lockers, survivors purple in up get in proximity of the hook and stay out of lockers. But yes this is a trend about baby killers crying about losing training wheels alright ;)
---
You aren't wrong.
---
Quick and quiet, lithe, dance with me, self care
---
Susie is just my favorite and I don't like spending too much on cosmetics 😭 I may end up caving and getting a plague outfit tho.
---
🤢
---
Yay lets start using this!
---
It's multiplicative on different perk. So running Thana + sloppy doesn't do much for healing speed, although it helps to slow gen
---
...provided you hit all 4 survivors.
---
At which point, you better of finishing them via tunnel tbh.
---
Also PGTW is so much superior for slowing gen
---
if he didnt camp then he wouldnt probably even make bp, or do u think the killer was having fun being looped by a probably most experienced survivor?
---
So Nurse, Hillbilly, and Spirit can all have consistent ability to get downs with 0 perks, but when Legion has a single survivor reliant way to down reliably it's "cheap ass" and "boring"? Right...
---
Grape drank
---
I know me too, he's also most portrayed as having a machete when he doesn't use it that often. If I remember correctly he only uses it in part 6 and 7, I might be wrong though. Jason doesn't ever use just a single weapon, he uses whatever is closest to him to kill someone
---
It's more like a flamethrower to be fair. Limited range but Uber damage.
---
Oh my god! Are you playing on Xbox? I ran into three swf with a Kate and Claudette and 3rd survivor I can’t remember who teabagged on top of the hill at a stalking Michael until he hit tier three and ran him STRAIGHT to the gen I was working on and then farmed me off the hook till I died. Game crashed before I got a chance to report them
---
Said that few days ago and I get downvoted  because BP matters apparently :|
---
OSHA Wraith reporting for duty lmao
---
Yeah that's what I thought to as it says nowhere on the case that you need it. It's kinda weird certain games like minecraft state that you need ps plus to play online but dbd doesn't
---
My favorite perk is No ED
---
I just love playing the game with a green Instagram filter over my entire screen.
---
A well-known counter is to run to where you came from, run back
---
Because you play on PC and I play on PS4
---
Okay I don’t think you know what memes are. That was just gibberish
---
Run Iron Will, it will reduce your moans of pain to 0 when you stand in one place.
---
Having Spine Chill would be a good idea to run.
---
When loading into my game for the new rank reset it reset me to 5 as I was red ranks however it then crashed and wouldn't load dbd so I checked again the next day and it rank reset me twice to rank 9
---
I’m hooked on this please have borrowed time
---
I started as a survivor, went to try a few killers, mostly liked wraith (he's great for getting a feel for where survivors will go, since stealth vision lets you basically walk up to an active gen).
---
Eventually I said: "Fuck this, I want ruin" and bought the hag, who is now my #1 favorite killer. Especially at low killer levels, you get traps sprung *all the fucking time.* I've had numerous games where literally every time I trap a hook it triggers. Low level survivors just don't know how to avoid hag traps. For that reason, I definitely recommend hag- pulling down ~30k points a round is super cost efficient.
---
Awww Bubba made a friend!
---
Try playing against the plague on the Hawkins laboratory.  Have everyone sick and to the point of broken status  One generator complete  And everyone's clock ticking down.
---
 Then tell me there is never a circumstance where you need to cleanse early
---
Survs shouldn't have the power role. If a killer is good, the game should be in their hands. Removing the flick really hurt.
---
That's part of the game tho I'm pretty sure, it's to prevent killers from downing unhooked survivors without giving them a chance to react
---
Of course it's a thing, but now you need a second perk to augment the first one. Killers already have little to work with in terms of loadout because of the Ruin requirement. So you'll have Ruin, Nemesis, PWYF, and one final one. Requiring two perks to make one function well is poor design.
---
And the stacks may be easy against potato survivors, but good survivors will figure out what's going on and start dropping pallets early. You're putting things in this simplistic vacuum to suit your argument instead of just being honest that NOED rustles your jimmies.
---
Yesterday was the first time I've had a killer DC, it was a Wraith that wasnt very good so i just looped him for about three gens. Started to feel bad for him actually, got away from him and watched from a locker while he threw a tantrum.
---
Yes I used the "Frankenstein switch" on thingiverse. I deleted the wood grain, made it a bit biger and a few changes to the handle etc. I will upload and share the STL  
---
Edit; [Here it Is!](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4048742)

Also, if you like this, you'll probably like some of the other things on [my Etsy shop.](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KSquared3D?ref=seller-platform-mcnav) Lockers, the hatch, Gens... Its a growing collection of all things DBD!
---
The bad hitreg does though
---
There is no real counter, only some things that might help you if the spirit is bad.
---
-4k
---
I said juke the Nurse lmao. Juke her or avoid LOS. Stun the Legion? But he has nemesis though dumbass, so if you do you're fucked regardless. So you either stun him and you're fucked or you dont and he just bloodlusts you to death lmao. Yeah you are, playing against Old Legion was not fun, there's nothing fun about just bleeding out and being absolutely helpless about it. Bloodlust is a shitty mechanic that was only implemented cause of shitty map design. Bloodlust rewards a bad killer, bloodlust is overkill on new maps that are actually designed properly. Plus, I'm talking about Bloodlust on Legion while he has Beast Of Prey.
---
Good man killer. :)
---
That damn NOED challenge. I played like I normally do but just with NOED equipped. I’d get 3 hooks on 2 survivors each and then would just sit in the corner of a map hitting a wall waiting for the last two to complete the gens. Once they popped the last gen I down the both of them, opened the gate, and then hooked them. I felt absolutely scummy doing it. Got GGs in chat though and some saying they completed their challenge so I guess no one was too mad about it
---
Wholesome memes
---
That looks hot
---
Not during tier 1, ambush/crouch, invisible, shroud, even with alert all you get is the ding notification but no aura
---
Wow this is the nicest way someone could have apolpgize to you for dc'ing damn!
---
What system are you on? That makes a difference. Also there is a possibility of getting matched with a same killer again especially at certain times that are less people playing
---
Pepehands, but it's understandable
---
This has been asked a few times before and has been met with the same response of a hard "no" from most of the community. Your sexuality doesn't matter in a game like this. You won't get special treatment just because you're LBGTQ. None of the survivor's sexualities have been revealed, so have fun with that, But that is all you'll get.
---
Buy bubba save shards and level up all of your characters for teachable's you'll thank me later
---
&gt;  But he has nemesis though dumbass,
---
You said BoP, not BoP and Nemesis. ;)
---
&gt; I said juke the Nurse lmao.
---
Nope. Editing doesn't save you honey.
---
&gt; **There are actual counters and looping against the Nurse**, Spirit and Hillbilly. Against a Legion with Beast of Prey he hits you with FF and then just chases you till he gets bloodlust and then you're fucked. The changes to how deepwounds works was to make sure the Legion wasn't shit to go against. If you can't see how cancer that shit would be to face then you're purposely ignoring the survivor side of things. I don't want to loop a killer only to go down cause he has bloodlust. Legion gets a free hit against you cause of his speed and ability to vault windows and pallets easily but the trade off is that he can't down you while in FF or with deepwounds so his speed doesn't feel unfair to go against, if you couple in the speed AND the ability for Legion to down you with FF then that's just broken and unfun to go against. Juke the Nurse, Loop Billy and be unpredictable against the spirit. They have counter play, old Legion didn't.
---
Or maybe he spent most of the match trying to get that infinite tier 3 on survivors with much more experience than him. And finally popped it during the endgame getting one lucky kill. I'm sure the other 3 would just leave the last guy on the hook once they realize his tier 3 hasn't went away after a while.
---
EDIT: it also seems like he had trouble finding them since everyone on this board has low BP. They prob just genrushed and gone.
---
So really weak loops are better against a machine gun ranged weapon?  Still a no from me dawg
---
Sad part was that I actually was wearing headphones and it was the first thing I heard when I woke up. I play at a fairly high volume preset as well so I had a pretty good jump
---
I know. Normally it would be like, oh whatever. I’m actually taken back. Why isn’t Anti-Shit Posting a Flair. There should be a thread called. The Bright Side of the Fog.
---
Iron will is all the time at max rank
---
FYI even if you’re running Iron Will you will be heard anyway if the Spirit has Stridor. Less then other survivors, but you’ll be heard if injured. 
---
Spirit really doesn’t have a counter play even though they changed some of her add ons and some other things recently. What I usually do when she fazes is, look for the closest jungle Jim or double T wall, fast vault the window and slow vault back or if there’s a pallet drop it in front of me (opposite as usual) and walk back. Still those counters have a chance to fail since there’s nothing 100% effective against a a good Spirit. 
---
A very good perk loadout against spirit is:
---
Lithe, Quick and Quiet, Iron Will and Dance with Me. Really fun build and you’d be a nightmare for the Spirits out there and not only.
---
I edited that as soon as I sent it lmao. Haven't touched it since. And no dumbass, you said he was wasting two perk slots. Don't go back on your word now just cause you look stupid.
---
That has nothing to do from it. Just admit you're wrong and there are sometimes a good reason to cleanse and drop the "the top players say this so it's TRUE" bullshit.
---
Servers definitely aren’t on Xbox cause I’ll still find lobbies where the ping is like 300 to 500 ping. Also it’s super, super, super, rare for me to find a lobby better than 110 ping
---
I like how all the stories of being tunneled and facecamped in this thread all involve Wraith
---
If you hate survivors, get Spirit.
---
*it hurt itself in confusion*
---
I have had this. And the fake grab during rescue. I can see the hand extended out and everything
---
You need 50-60k on lvl 50, so roughly 25-30k per level. Around 250k BP.
---
Good BP gains for devious and brutality if you make good use of feral frenzy I think.
---
I hope it takes 20 sec everytime you want to turn on the lights
---
For the full ash story line. It goes:
---
The Evil dead (1981)
---
Evil Dead 2 (1987)
---
Army of Darkness (1992)
---
Ash vs Evil Dead (2015-2018)
---
The actor who plays ash as well as Sam Raimi have also announced that there will be more of the evil dead story to come in the future. This also includes a video game coming at some point.
---
Thanks. I'm going to make at least one more of these with a mix of all killers. The Share Factory for Ps4 is pretty annoying to use though.
---
Hey man, shitty matchmaking but atleast you got a kill. Also if anything, this will improve your skill even more by going against people much better than you. It will improve you alot more than a normal rank 17 match imo. You will learn competent survivor tendencies alot faster lol. Also you got some nice perks and addons for a rank 17.
---
Her withering blight cosmetics are probably my favorite for her, so if you haven't already used all your putrid serums I would definitely recommend that
---
That made me cry
---
That seems like a much better explanation, I didn't see the infinite add-on. I rally to your scenario then.
---
If they’re talking about the unhooked survivor, yeah, there was a change a long time ago where they’re not supposed to be injured until they are actually in control of their character after the animation.  I e never encountered invincibility for the survivor unhooking tho outside of old BT.
---
He got his flick nerfed. Again. So now Oni can't end chases as effectively anymore.
---
Lovely to see there are kind interactions between Survs and Killers.  Sometimes it feels like such a divide and so much hurtful shit is said.  At the end of the day we're all people and should be understanding of each others intense game emotions.  Great job OP and bless these Survivors too :)
---
There are now 5 different preschool maps all with slightly different layouts but the same landmarks. Some of them have large dead zones so it can seem like they’re bigger
---
So now I get in games with lower ranks without knowing? That sucks.
---
Nope, nope, nope.
---
I know what you’re talking about. Its a bad idea because its telegraphed. If claudette healed faster innately the killer would know that you’re healing faster. This is why teachables are a much better system. Innate abilities is just asking for a balancing nightmare.
---
Lol again for the 4th time you're barking up the wrong tree.  At least my assumptions about you have proven themselves accurate.  
---
I'm not a main on either side.  50/50 3K hour player.  That's probably why I think you're as adorable as you are with the BBQ hate.  On killer I don't find it useful enough bloodpoint farming aside to justify the slot and in survivor I can choose to counterplay it easily OR just say fuck it here I am let's go loop.  What I don't do is take option 3 which is to take to reddit to cry about a balanced perk.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
First when will this be mass produced and second how much?
---
It does
---
So now, when you’re doing something on your computer ať night and someone turns on the light, it’s even more similar to the killer starting the endgame collapse.
---
I am serious, after rank reset and me going from rank 9 to 13, I keep on getting teams of rank 16-20. :(
---
Guess being able to see the stealth killer auras when he's camping was too op 👻
---
I don't see how self care can get prioritised over throwing a pallet down. It seems like the complete opposite, like youd throw a pallet down instead of self caring.
---
BHVR:What's a buff killers
---
So that's Wraith's rework
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eamvot/wraith_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Nobody loves Quentin, and for good reason
---
Both freddy and the map got revised.
---
Pre-School has now 5 alternative versions, and they'are all bigger than the old one.
---
&gt; You're putting things in this simplistic vacuum to suit your argument instead of just being honest that NOED rustles your jimmies.
---
Or you're just trying to find excuses to use perk on killers who doesnt need it
---
Killer:
---
Spirit 
---
Mother Daughter Ring, Father‘s Glasses
---
Sloppy, Dying Light, Ruin, BBQ
---
Farthest I‘ve seen survivors going with that build is 3 gens. Father‘s Glasses are really good with MDR, because you can just phase out at the last bright red blood stain instead of the scratch marks. If you can handle MDR‘s speed you can also use cooldown addons.
---
Survivor:
---
Sprint Burst, Resilience, Spine Chill, Adrenaline
---
Once you‘re injured you can make vaults that shouldn‘t have been possible because you get about 15% vault speed from Spine Chill and Resilience. Sprint Burst because it‘s my preferred exhaustion perk. Lithe could also synergize well with this build. Adrenaline because it‘s the best survivor perk in the game.
---
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual = Different genders= Mental Disorders.. Mate you huffing paint?
---
Ok thank you now.
---
Thanks.
---
Damn beaten to it I wanted flesh and mud well thanks anyways &lt;3
---
So you always get so defensive from people barking up the wrong tree.
---
I didn't when you started barking up this tree you accuse me of barking up. But keep crying over a suggestion.
---
PS4 - Just played against a Wraith who hit me while cloaked. He was chasing me while cloaked, did the full uncloaking animation, but remained cloaked. I just assumed he canceled the animation to mind game me. He kept chasing me and then downed me, picked me up, and carried me to a hook, all while still cloaked. Is this a known bug or an ad-on that I’m not aware of? Or was my game just glitched?
---
Now imagine what would happen if killer can see survivor ranks and vice versa during the count down lobby
---
OP, what region are you in? Trying to see if changing my region would let me install the beta.
---
I second this
---
Iron will
---
You don't have to run the perk forever. I ran Small Game for a week, and I learned where most of the totem spawns were. I haven't had to run it since. You have to be open to changing things up a little every now and then to improve in certain areas.
---
Well if the infographics we've seen here lately are accurate, almost everybody plays Claudette or Nea at red ranks anyway, so it wouldn't really be that different.
---
No that would be hella broken, and way extremely easier for killers to mindgame. Imagine  Freddy running those blindness add ons with snares. You’re practically forced to run through them at loops already or get two tapped. No thanks.
---
My etsy shop is slammed for the holidays, but I should be able to add this in a couple of weeks. I'm not sure about price, maybe like $30. what do you think is fair?
---
I mean for all we know, they’re all gay, and I think none of them should have a labeled sexuality anyway lgbtq+ or not
---
Is it really Mori or only sacrifices? Because I feel like I’ve been killing a gazillion Claudette and still no face. Don’t want to waste my Moris for no reason.
---
Thanks to both of you, just played a game on it and was so confused haha!
---
Of course it was a Wraith
---
Ok that actually sounds really helpful. I'll put small game into a loadout for a bit
---
Ok np dude
---
Using spirit with NOED is way more outrageous than a few flashlight clickies
---
What dose the IAP mean?
---
I wish the clown cut off your finger he’d put it in his butthole
---
When I use Bond and feel as if I'm being chased for too long or I'm injured I'll use Bond to go to a healthy teammate and try and shake the killer. Some people are willing to take hits and sometimes killer will break chase to prevent gens. I'd rather not go down if possible.
---
A man can only hope
---
Continuity in Evil Dead is a funny thing. Evil Dead 2 completely retells the first movie and Army of Darkness has a pretty darn good recap so you don't really miss anything. This is actually commented on in the Ash vs Evil Dead show.

I mean why not it really doesn’t change shit about anything. Cool they’re this what does that have to do with the gameplay? Not a damn thing so why should anyone really care. 
---
The only ones to give a fuck are the ones that are against it or are for it. 
---
But it’s always funny to see the ones that are against it to be very salty and pissy at something so insignificant.
---
The ones for it are just happy because they have someone that they can play that is 100% them. 
---
Also Jeff’s not a killer.... corpsepaint is just black metal tradition.
---
I mean it's basically the same thing though. If I'm playing against Huntress I know lockers are off-limits. If I'm playing against Michael I know to break line of sight as soon as possible, etc.
---
&gt;They're sort of a cross between bear traps and Freddy's teleport, except that they combine only the worst aspects of both
---
Haha I love that!
---
Also shred no insta down, or any other status effect. I mean..why?? He is literally M1 killer that has a mobility based on portal that needs placing in first place...in limited quality...with cooldown on using them.
---
Also his teachable perks suck
---
In your message, you said:
---
&gt;  Against a Legion with Beast of Prey he hits you with FF and then just chases you till he gets bloodlust and then you're fucked.
---
You only mentioned the one perk. This was the statement I responded to. There was no mention of Nemesis here. If anything it's you who is going back on your word.
---
&gt; I edited that as soon as I sent it lmao.
---
Nope. Minimum of 3 minutes afterwards. See the little edited asterisk next to it? Yeah that's what that signifies.
---
You both just made me laugh I love y'all 🤣
---
Clearly you’ve never met a youth pastor
---
Paulie Esther’s video. I probably spelled his name wrong
---
You keep calling it "getting defensive".  It's called calling out bias and entitlement I'm not salty or defensive lol.  This is just yet another shitpost on an endless string of shitposts.
---
Nice wraith build!  I'm on my way to make that.
---
Well damn jefe
---
First time really trying out flashlight, would never do it usually but you're right. had to for the noed lmao
---
I call it the acronym build:
---
PWYF, PGTW, NOED, STBFL
---
They poke fun at the inconsistency a lot. Joking about how he dates so many Linda’s is another funny one, since they had three different actresses play Linda in the films. They also reference how ash tried to burn the book and it didn’t work, implying that it wasn’t destroyed in the first film.
---
Its not only to help brainless teammates when you get hooked. It is also a bond with unlimited range and and shows the killer when a teammate gets hooked which is pretty common
---
Nurse has a lesser pocket watch of stamina.
---
Bill has an enchanted pocket watch of endurance.
---
Clown trains his hands with Porn.
---
I noticed this with Detective's Hunch but it is possible it is true for other aura perks tied to generators. 
---
When one generator pops, the perk activates. But if another generator pops during the 10 seconds of aura reading, the aura reading is not extended by another 10 seconds.
---
Is this intentional?
---
It's the only way!
---
They created the pattern, made the product and then ship it to you. Sorry everything isn't made in china
---
RUNNING FROM ONI AND I KNOW IT'S MY TIME TO GO
---
I had to double-take because I had this exact same match happen last night, even down to the Michael addons lol. I was a survivor though and I'm rank 13 after the reset.
---
Amandannygorgon is what you're thinking of
---
Yeah I saw you only had two perks. Once you get his awesome add ons, you will dominate.
---
Nope, it's bugged atm, most of the time she doesn't her her 'windstorm', same with Wraith
---
What's that resolution you're using? I play on 1440x1080 but it isn't as stretched as this one.
---
Yeah. No hard feelings it was a good play.
---
Oh no. SpiritBilly is a real thing
---
He altered a pattern that was already made by someone else. You seem quick to read my comment but not of those who clearly stated they made minor alterations to the original design of something someone else made. 🤷‍♂️
---
I used to play on 1280 X 1024 but now I've switched to 1154 X 1080. It's disgusting I know.
---
Aah, well, such is life for the killers
---
They still had to alter it to look like that, that takes effort and time
---
i was going to give someone the hatch one time, but they started wiggling so they had to get the hook instead
---
The word your looking to replace for “semi transparents” is translucent
---
why does it feel like ive seen this before
---
Not enough time to justify 30 dollars or your simplistic views of how long it actually takes to make minor adjustments and altercations.
---
You're not a degenerate, but a man of culture. Great choice to put Nezuko there!
---
I saw a salty uncivilized low intelligent person rage whine over some small suggestion and started trolling instead of even trying to have a conversation about points. But hey, you keep defensively arguing with your screen ma'am. 
---
Maybe you should practice what you preach, locker hider.
---
Lets see, few dollars in materials. Takes me nearly an hour to paint. Also takes 4 hours to print (just the plate) so factor in time using the printer, electricity... Looking at $5 easily just to make it. Im practically paying myself $20/hr. And that doesnt factor in the time I spent creating the models in the first place.
---
What does this mean lol
---
Oni does not suck. He's still very strong, PC people are the only ones that are gonna feel any changes. Since you play on PS4, the Oni didn't get a noticeable nerf, and he has fun perks. It seems like that's who you're leaning towards too.
---
What are you talking about? This game has no glitches or bugs. For sure it’s your Xbox 😝
---
Nah
---
&gt;breaking entirely unrelated things repeatedly
---
That's an oxymoron. The bugs only seem unrelated. If you change one thing and another seemingly unrelated thing changes as well, then the two things are related to each other. It just goes to show how difficult it is to design and code a game like DBD.
---
Would a point system with perks work in DBD? Get 10 points worth of perks with adrenaline, ds, etc worth like 4 points and then tiered down from there.
---
that go hard asf
---
I just started ctfu 😂😂😂
---
Reading the rift entries i had a thought about the Yamaokas. I dont think she is much different than her family. She probably had the same madness in her but got killed by her father before it manifested. Maybe even killed her to break a chain and stop the madness that runs in the family. Thats why entity took her. Last name Yamaoka is also most likely reference to Akira Yamaoka, video game music composer who wrote most of, if not every song Silent Hill franchise song.
---
Nice subreddit you created there. Homophobic piece of shit.
---
What's the bubba offering?
---
“Why are you booing me? I’m right!”
---
Say what?
---
Why would someone even do this lmao it's in your own best interests to have all living teammates up and completing objectives
---
You don't get to high road when you set the bar this low with this post.  
---
Hider lol!   Again good loopers don't care about BBQ.  If you whine this hard it tells me you're garbage at staying up in chases and this is why you came here to cry about the aura reads.  There's zero chance you are better at looping than me with your opinions on BBQ being what they are.  You wouldn't care about the perk if you were any good like the rest of us.
---
I only use self care when running solo because I can never rely on my team even when I'm right behind them they ignore and don't heal me.
---
Yep
---
Every time man, I have to always bring it cuz (I know this is just me) nobody on my team EVER runs DS. It's literally a locked perk slot
---
I’m confused
---
It’s 25 Moris on the original 4 to get faces I believe
---
I just bought a hatch from you and I love it! Seriously guys their stuff is good.
---
Ha ha that's funny. You think they'll give Jane and Ash viable passives. Just look at their perks dude.
---
Ash's passive will be to say "Groovy" at random, revealing yourself to the Killer, and Jane's passive would be the ability to stun someone (Killer or Survivor) for 1 second by jumping out of a window and landing on them with dat ass.
---
Go on their profile

---
I already have a good life, so late to that party sis
---
Recently, not the one talking about food lmao
---
Oh Yea for sure, I’m not saying anything for or against the initial idea, just stating a repetitive meta is already in the game so making one for the survivors wouldn’t really be a new thing. But yea, I don’t like playing male characters because they feel different. They seem like they’re slower, bigger hit boxes, louder, and just in general worse than the females and I know that’s mostly in my head because they all move the same but I don’t like the animations and it feels weird. So having to play a male character because they have a better passive would make me die.
---
I have yet to survive on the new map but Hawkins is still worst for me
---
You could probably test this with poised and fixated to see if it's a consistant feature.
---
Maybe you might want to consider investing in a screen printer or make one to keep cost time down. Your overhead isn't the customers problem. Time using the printer isn't even a labouring task. Oh no I had to take all my time, effort and energy to click the word print on my computer. Such a daunting task. You carry on about your day while it does it's thing. It takes 2 seconds to snap the switch to the plate body. 
---
Horror props like that doesn't take long to paint either.
---
Can we be real here with the amount of effort that is actually needed? 30 bucks is way to much for something that doesn't even have any included effects to complete the esthetic. You're just being greedy at that point. Along with almost everyone else on etsy it seems.
---
Brown toolbox. It has jarder and more frequent skillchecks by default.
---
Lol.  None of what you typed is remotely accurate but I got you 100% accurate.

You didn’t provide an argument.  “What about THIS MAP” is literally all you said and you aren’t right.

I'm pretty sure Bruce said he's done with Ash after AvED was canceled
---

Hey a Bill did that to me last night, he died shortly after

---
I bought the Joey one. It's just green rarity and it's only a top, there's not a full outfit
---
There is a survivor tech where you start unhooking and then run through the hooked survivor, but it’s a bit tricky. It makes the killer hit the hook and deal with the successful attack wipe animation
---
If you look harder, you will. It's not in the outift tab.
---
Still worth it lol
---
You can right click the game in Steam, click Properties, then click Local Files, you should be able to click "Verify game integrity" at the bottom.
---
Doing that will manually check your files to make sure they are there and aren't corrupt. Not sure if it would help since you already reinstalled, but it certainly wouldn't hurt.
---
I laughed for a good ten minutes
---
Hes pretty small, try punching him in the nose.
---
Really? Never noticed that before
---
At least those would be hilarious. I'm all for meme builds lmao. Oh yeah, I'm an Ash main and my brother (my swf buddy) is a Jane main, we know all about their lack of viable perks. I can dream though. Dream of a world where not every single team I'm on is 3 Claudettes and an Ash, or 2 Neas, a Meg, and an Ash.
---
Ayy cool.

Ok, now I see.

How are you playing dbd? Your tv is on the floor wth
---
As Steve would say; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH (this is frickin awesome dude)
---
i can understand about the first part, and a tl:dr would be Dev's Incompetence, but for this:
---
&gt;The fact the hitboxes are considerably bigger than a single pixel meaning that lag will have a considerably larger affect on the outcome
---
I disagree because there are countless games where you use swords or other weapons to fight and they don't have these problems
---

Crouching below windows and walking instead of running help. Walk one way, double back and go left or right to lose her. Use objects to hide behind and just don’t walk in straight lines.

---
The Discpline addon only reveals your aura for a few seconds every time your madness tiers up. If you're in tier 3 then Calm Spirit will prevent the random screaming, however the Doctor will be able to see the auras of any doctor illusions spawned.
---
Yoooooo
---
Agreed, people who play Susie are nerds, Joey is master race
---
And It probably doesn't even have to be a survivor only offering, it could be for both sides.

Well I’ve brought remember me. Good luck getting to bed *bitch*

Within 6 ranks from the killer and rank 20 avoids all rules.

That one actually follows the rules

And then he poopy it out on your body
---
That looks like a nightmare for the killer
---
*completely misses it*
---
Are you ok-
---
If survivors got passives I'm 100% sure all killer mains would quit.
---
Even I a killer main think this is stupid. Before when there were no points for wiggle sure why not but now I know they're gonna try to get at least a little more before they die so I expect it. If you're gonna let a survivor go then let them go and if they try to get away show you're being friendly. There's also a chance they can get free if they wiggle as well so they'll go for it expecting to get killed anyways so survivors are supposed to just miss out on points and give them an easy hook at the chance of a free escape?
---
Its honestly super suspicious/weird how you almost \[...\]
---
\- never get slugged when running Unbreakable
---
\- Never get tunneled when running Decisive Strike

\- Never face Doctor when running Calm spirit

New survivor: what's that sound. His friend: *DC*
---
What fucking pose are they in-
---
don't think so
---
Your inability to think for yourself. I thought that was rather clear.
---
&gt; I didn’t call anyone in particular an asshole, just asked why some people play like it during events
---
that could clearly be directed at someone, therefore it's necessary to remain consistent
---
Its still there the post and the subreddit. Just in the meantime report that post and subreddit and down vote him into Oblivion.
---
Riperoni I guess the meme was unbalanced
---
Uhh *_how?_*
---
Because it *feels* super long. The thing about imagining him a meter closer is pretty good advice tho
---
Dude there isn't anything wrong with wanting an opinion on something. If you don't like it then just move on with your life rather than trying to be a dick for no reason
---
Yeah, I’ve reported it and downvoted. What a stupid asshole.
---
Ive played for a while but i got tired of playing killer so i took a break thus rank 17. My best rank was 10 cause im kinda bad at tracking.
---
I beg of you to give me a clean version of this
---
&gt;It just goes to show how difficult it is to design and code a game like DBD.
---
Or it just goes to show how much of a mess of spaghetti the base game's code is. When stuff breaks, it's almost always core mechanics in some manner, newer things tend to work better. While you're technically correct in the sense that yes they're apparently connected in some manner, the point is that they *shouldn't* be. That's typically due to bad coding, not that "it's complicated." Not to say coding *isn't* complicated, but ultimately that just means the base was coded badly.
---
Painful. Never happens when you have the perks on, then the opposite happens the millisecond you take them off lol
---

You can tunnel multiple survivors though. You tunnel them out one at a time it’s not impossible 🤦🏼‍♀️
---
Me too, I’m only an ally but it really pisses me off. It’s so stupid and unnecessary, creating a shit subreddit too. Cunt.
---
Bur the defs said that they fixed rhe matchmaking by matching a killer with the same rank as the highest rank survivor. I am a tad bit confused.
---
Well, it's ultra rare, so it's gotta be ultra good.
---
thats the part that irritates me. getting the "successful attack" animation. if my attack just bonked like it does when you normally hit a hooked survivor, i wouldn't care so much, but the game is telling me that i got a hit, so it should do something
---
Like balanced landing
---
hitting the hooked survivor wouldn't play the "successful attack" animation.
---
I never said it was wrong. I was just pointing out that you do it ALOT and it's annoying. So I asked if you ever think for yourself. If you don't like what I said then move on with your life rather than trying to avoid my question that you obviously have no answer to.
---
Anyway, I'd pick Plague or Myers.
---
It doesn’t bonk. It registers. Go hit a hooked survivor right now dude. You get the blood FX, they scream and you wipe. No glitch.
---
After some Googling, turns out it is. Started as a BDSM term. Looks like Jeff is kinky.
---
Was just going to keep scrolling, but seeing people taking pride in something they made makes me happy. So I had to come back and upvote ⬆️
---
Yeah, i just got out of a Series of Games as Jake where i took Calm Spirit out because i didn´t face anything making you scream (Iron Maiden, Infectious Fright, Doctor in general) and faced Doctor, Plague with Infectious Fright and Legion with Iron Maiden in that Order.
---
I was honestly salty, not gonna lie. And now Calm Spirit is in my Jake once again.
---
no. i do it all the time. if you hit someone who is hooked, it plays the same animation that it does if you hit a window or wall or something
---
Legion (Susie and joe) got Christmas sweaters, santa clown came out last year, and soon we'll get reindeer huntress
---
God damn the content on this sub just get worse and worse.
---
stop, please
---
Sorry dude but that’s wrong. Go try it.
---
Plagues best oerk imo is dark devotion which blocks gens in the beginning of the match, legions best one is discordance. Pigs best is make your choice. Freddy's are kinda bad. And Michael's good ones are stbfl and pwyf
---
you are a great man, thank you.
---
Agreed. I want a blinking string of xmas lights all draped and tangled on the Demogorgon
---
i do it literally every game. its not wrong.
---
See what i did there mika
---
I think the Myers and Freddy ones still show up
---
It's a troll thread, downvotes for everyone!
---
Stoners

Its the same as survivor. Feels like theres more killers quitting than ever before.

That would be adorable.

Why basement bubba, when you can instasaw bubba?

I ragequit my last wraith match because of a robbed grab, I was pissed of already and that was the final straw.
---
“I could keep working on gens or I could be useless...”
---
Lmfao good thing tomorrow's Sunday. I'll be on the couch playing dbd 😂
---
idk. i love it when survivors give me free hits when they try to block me
---
Jane has other type of physics 8)
---
Unless it’s been changed very recently to avoid BM. I know for a fact it used to have a wipe at least 2 months ago
---
I had one game in the swamp where I could not find the hatch, I went all over that map three times, let the survivor escape to look for it, too. After a while they just DC'd, felt bad man.
---
In the exit
---
I'm 28, you short-sighted degenerate.
---
No it doesn't. It plays the successful hit animation.
---
Hopefully
---
He’s done playing him in live action. But he still will do voice work. Hence why he’s in DBD
---
Hey when you hit a survivor who is on the hook, does it play the wipe animation or does it do a wall hit animation?
---
pretty sure it got changed cuz I've only been playing for like a month and its never given me the animation and the only time in videos that i see it play the animation is in older vids
---
Can you still do this at the preschool? Ive done it once and tried it 50 more times since then, only to fall ):
---
Urban is a good perk if you build around playing cautious, the problem is everyone associates it with players who do nothing but hide in the bushes all game.
---
Offering icons are incredibly low res during loading.  I can't imagine this being difficult to fix.

---
Underrated is the wrong word, pair it with ds, inner strength and he's Don and the killer can't do shit about you jumping in a locker
---
Instablinds were incredibly aggravating
---
Instant gen completion was busted as all fuck
---
Instant full heal was bullshit
---
Keys are bullshit
---
No-hook necessary instant moris were total bullshit, and all moris besides yellow remain bullshit that is actively complained about and petitioned to be changed
---
I'm sorry to say this (not), but I'm glad they are trying to reduce the amount of bullshit in the game.
---
When the Killer was a host, it would effectively give them a 0 ping as far as their actions are concerned. It was why lag switching was so effective for them, and why lag switching with a dedicated server is less effective.
---
You speak as though everything in the network protocol and application layer protocol are synchronous. That the killer cannot take an action until it receives a packet from the survivors. That’s not how it works. 
---
The killer will now have lag. Which they didn’t account for originally which is why they’re having so many issues with killer related network code: such as traps and hatches.
---
It will even out the experience for everyone by tuning the delay between each peer in the network instead of having to hope the killer host is capable of providing a stable connection. This is a good thing. 
---
A 50 - 200 ms ping is not going to affect player reaction times in a game like this. Given the hit boxes here, things are not as precise as you elude them to be.
---
There are issues here that have absolutely nothing to do with a hub and spoke network model. It has to do with their network code and ability to coordinate the actions of every one. This should be fairly obvious to anyone who has played other games which have central servers and have far more accurate timings of actions.
---
In the end, they should have done dedicated servers to begin with but I understand why they didn’t. It is incredibly more cost effective to make the killer the host. Either way, switching from the Killer being the host to a central server that has to coordinate the positions and actions of external peers will always cause challenges.
---
There is extra “travel time” in relaying the positions of everyone. i would assume and hope that collusion and interaction mechanics now happen on the server. And if so, then there’s no delay in those interactions. Only the communication in the result of those actions.
---
I’ll repeat it one more time, all the issues they have is because of their network code not the network topology.
---
I hope so. Along with moris
---
Oh okay. Nah I’ve been playing for two and a half years and I just found out they changed it around 80 days ago to bonk
---
Same man. Well sort of. My old psn account got banned (long story about my account getting hacked and me cancelling my credit card instead of contacting psn first) so I quit for about a year. Now I'm trying to rebuild on a new account from scratch and it sucks.
---
I can think for myself just fine. I can post however many questions I want and you finding it annoying won't stop me. There is a saying that goes "if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all."  So instead of trying to be rude just move on. That's all I'm saying
---
Pig too
---
Nea: build to run the killer only but suck at it 
---
Claudette: immersive as all hell
---
incorrect. it bonks now
---
What have you brought apon this cursed land?
---
The problem is, if they nerf gen speeds, then survivors will have to spend even more time sitting in the same place doing QTEs, which just isn’t fun.
---
umadbro?
---
their lmao
---
?
---
r/Oinkers
---
No problem. Keep up the awesome work. I hope to collect the whole set one day. Ha
---
And pig and legion
---
I said “why do events make people play like assholes?” So in the given context it wasn’t directed at anyone in particular. It’s important to be consistent, but fair
---
On ps4 if you touch the touchpad during a match it inverts your Y axis camera movement. Just hit it again and you’ll be good
---
you need sloppy and nurses. You pretty much play like you play with legion. Hit and switch target keep everyone injured, they will waste time healing and not do gens
---
You forgot silver, but gg regardless.
---
He asked If that sounded fair ?... no need to be a dick the value of things is subjective from person to person .
---
This happens even on dedicated servers, if not more than when we had P2P on PC

---
It really is utter bullshit that they haven't given bubba ANY BUFFS AT ALL let alone reworked him. Do you really expect people to buy such a low tier killer for his perks alone?
---
The fact you think all black people are as stupid as you makes you racist.
---
No it doesn't. Killer ping isn't added to the server. The laggy stuff you're seeing is because of unoptimized prediction code and bad input validation. BHVR can fix this over time, but it will require many months of slow improvement. I'll explain quickly.
---
The way dedicated servers (are supposed to) work is as if you're playing a game of Monopoly with your friends on Skype.
---
One of your friends owns the board game, and sets it up with a camera pointing at it. This friend is the GM.
---
Whenever it's one of your guy's turn, the GM calls your name and asks you to make your move. You can tell him "roll the dice!" or "buy this property"! And he'll do it for you, and everyone else will see it in real time. It's very very hard to cheat in this Monopoly, because nobody except the GM can touch the actual game!
---
What happens if someone says "GIMME A MILLION BUCKS"? The GM just says no. Too bad. This is a big, rarely praised advantage of dedicated servers. The server can just say no if it detects\* weird input from a cheater like "move Myers to the other side of the map".
---
The server has a constant ping (like you looking at the Monopoly board) and this shouldn't be affected by anyone lagging.
---
\**: BHVR is a noob company and they have to go through growing pains. Which means improving their dedicated servers until they don't *****accept any laggy input at all*****. This is the solution for all the janky shit going on. It's not because of laggy killers or survivors. That's the symptom, not the solution.*
---
That's an amazing idea 😂😂
---
"Looked at" as in altering his add ons so that he can follow the same "2 reds several purples etx" format as all other killers.
---
The joke is that clown mains are omega chads
---
True, I just want more I guess haha
---
This is honestly very helpful and I seriously thank you for the 1 meter tip.
---
yeah i don’t have a problem with it existing, i just fuck up a lot by hitting the unhooked survivor too early.
---
Door opens, EGC starts
---
Just a Nea crouching and doing absolutely nothing

There is no gen here and the ruin is done

This is so cool. Love it!!!

Most people dont write that they enjoyed the game, but they do. Almost all People are friendly and enjoy the game, the small minority of toxic Ragers is just so loud that we mostly remember them.
---
Pictures like above proof this to me anew each time, honestly thanks for posting, this made my Day, too
---
Idk if it’s a hack or a bug, but this thing was funny, although it made me lose 2 sacrifices
---
I’ve never been on the map. Loaded in once but someone didn’t connect and the match was cancelled ;-;
---
That shit is so annoying. Happened to me alot the past couple weeks.
---
Idk how it triggers but I love getting this bug lmao
---
You're crying that your ezmode instawins are being taken away. That's cute.
---
I look dapper in my sweater.
---
Also, I decided I'm going to try to make it to red ranks this season by maining Legion.
---
Love the iconography in dbd
---
The bed sparks and gets grabbed by the entity
---
As a piggy main, i may be too biased to answer this. However you shouldn’t level up Nea since her teachables dont work on other killers.
---
No, they're not wrong. I run Kindred and if Ghostface goes into night shroud mode, his aura is invisible.
---
They get annoying but it’s fun to run them every now and then for a special build
---
Your set up is giving me anxiety lmao why is your shit on the carpet 🧐
---
I also play ps4, survivor mainly, rank 5, it takes me FOREVER to find a lobby, so long that I resort to playing killer just because i'm at a low killer rank. Sometimes when i'm waiting for a survivor match, it'll cancel &amp; it'll give me an "error" message.
---
Always when someone dc early in the game, I don‘t know what to do. Some survivors think I should let them go for it, but a dc is also annoying for the killer. I‘m a person that gives the last person the hatch if they really did something useful this game, but when someone dc, I normally give the hatch to the last one.
---
With tenacity, you get it SUPER fast. If you have FlipFlop, you have a better chance than usual to wiggle out. Unbreakable hands down my favorite perk.
---
Like hillbilly and wraith
---
I really thought about this and ive came to the conclusion that I should level up the 🔤ea
---
Keep it up!
---
Really?
---
That one brown outfit for claudette is insane on the swamp. I can barely see them. Also yamoakas.
---
I thought that too
---
"people" could refer to someone in the match
---
therefore it's consistent
---
and fair doesn't matter because the system is never fair, it's abuse of the consumer
---
Love it 10/10 would dc again
---
Doing gens, you?
---
That's why Nea is Enitity
---
Change my mind
---
Fucking good
---
So thats what happened to my wife.
---
move yellow mori to the base kit and remove the other ones, ez change
---
Its avaliable in some regions still
---
Can someone explain to me why keys are op? You have to survive long enough to use them and do enough gens if you want to escape with multiple people, it's not like the old insta heal or brand new part where you do next to nothing to reap the rewards at the very start of the trial.
---
I couldn't even get through your comment because i don't care for your negativity. I'm not the one stalking your page like you are mine. Perhaps, your time would be better spent filling out job applications and trying to get out of your mothers basement.
---
My safe word is "The Observer".
---
Newer things work better because it was just freshly written and will not go into the game until it is working properly. This spaghetti code thing is a trope that people like to blame when they need someone to blame. What large code base is not a mess of code?
---
Because the content on this sub keeps getting worse and worse.
---
I'd play Ash more but he's so damn loud when injured that I literally can't play him without Iron Will lmao
---
You feel robbed of a win as killer. You could have 3 people on death hook, 2 gens remaining, and a 3 gen strategy. It looks as if you have outplayed them and then the game is just over, no ability to stop it.
---
Once you level up other characters, the teachable you unlocked will show up in their bloodweb available to unlock.
---
Honestly, is there any reason to use the Oni over Billy now? Oni just seems like a slightly more controllable Billy who has to wait for his power.
---
Thanks
---
Found the trollllll
---
I allways get hatemail when killing them even if their mate dc'd
---
It probably took them all game to down just one survivor with that huge rank discrepancy. Even if they camped to secure the kill, I don't see what other options they would have.
---
Nea is killer confirmed
---
It’s Always Philadelphia
---
And? So what? Let him say what he wants, as long as he isnt hurting people. Besides why should it matter in this subreddit? Regardless of what he believes, he still plays the game. His political standing and beliefs shouldnt be an issue here unless he is actively touting it about around here. Stop bringing drama in the conversation when it doesnt apply, you actively discourage discussion that way.
---
I love this
---
omg that is so cool!! I just got a 3D printer, I am STOKED! Thanks so much for sharing :)
---
This ain’t it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Moris could just be moved to after second hook or after struggle. All your doing at that point is taking away decisive. I do think it would be cool to have them be interrupted by blinding or decisive tho. 
---
The key just needs to take some time to open. Like you would a door but maybe not as long. Totem cleanse length? Or snap out of it length. 
---
I have been a long proponent that the door should have at least one skill check. Totems too.
---
I just though it was bullshit how I got set back that far. And as the item guy said this is just a thing I play at night after work. Sorry I’m not MLG like you.
---
But you cared enough to try and squeeze in that last garbage, recycled, high school insult about jobs and basements! Never stalked your page, just recognized your name from your other posts.
---
Idk why you're so hostile... $20 is a good price, I just would rather print a lot of other things. So yea letting this take up my printer 5+ hours (total) isnt worth $20 to me. Especially when I still have to paint, pack, and ship it.   
---
As far as flipping a switch... yes that's true, but it's because I got it to that point. I still have to level the bed every few prints. So that means waiting for it to warm up and watch it print the skirt, which takes 3-5 min each print. Then go back, remove the plate, and start the handle and nubbin. I agree it's not much work but I hear $20 and I'm just like, meh. Not quite worth my time.  
---
On a side note, $30 is nothing lmfao I spend more on a few drinks at a bar. This switch, you could have forever.
---
I'm not saying its better, or even good. I just think its more fun to use. Using it in a chase is really nerve racking and I don't feel like I'm wasting them by using them because they aren't god tier anymore.
---
Oops I must've struck a nerve.
---
Tell that to half ultra rare addons now
---
That's pretty impressive!
---
That makes a lot of sense. Maybe they could make the opening take longer, like it's rusted shut and the survivor with the key has to do a noisy action to open it over the course of like, 10-15 seconds?
---
Haha I love this, thank you so much!
---
claudette is one of my favorites.. rip
---
These cosmetics just keep getting weirder and weirder man.
---
Classic dbd moments
---
This is hilarious 😂
---
I assure you, you did not. But I am gonna stop replying now because you aren't really that good at banter and I'm getting bored. Enjoy the game!
---
"Nothing personal kid"
---
What is it tied to now?
---
Shadowborn isnt that bad, it can be useful for finding people.
---
Yeah but you haven't contributed more than negatively complaining so...
---
There's always that one fucking super-well-hidden totem unless map w/ tracking range or Detective's Hunch, that I only find about half the time.
---
I've started to leave a totem somewhere until the end in case NOED lands on it, unless I'm extra-thirsty for boldness because I'm not getting chased very long at all, or really super need it for Inner Strength.
---
Unless I've found all 5, of course.
---
Then I'd be unsurprised and also fuck you
---
Yes
---
Or when you go for the grab on the unhooker but for some reason it makes you smack the hooked dude.
---
In what way is he hurting people? Emotionally? You're on the internet, if you dont agree with what his opinion is you can literally just ignore it and go about your day. If he was going around calling people names and harassing them, I would be a little more inclined to believe you. Besides isnt this the same game where sometimes in end game chat people will literally call you the n word?
---
Haha, stupid Clauduette running towards me-
---
Wait what the fuck, why am I down, I am the kill- OH MY FUCKING GOD, CLAUDUETTE NO-
---
Taking it as you didn't read my post? Literally stated my queue times.
---
I can’t even tell who is being ironic/a troll/sarcastic anymore
---
Yeah playing t1 Myers kinda sucks right now because if a survivor reacts to BEING GRABBED fast enough they just ignore it.
---
Thanks to True everyone is starting to use this build.
---
Getting chase but I am lucky, I only got dead hard left, d strike, lithe, unbreakable left and uhhh 13 pallets!
---
You can be reported for going afk for bad sportsmanship/not playing the game as intended, it's right there in the report options and their contextual text.
---
Unless you think every single person working for BHVR are salty for actually encouraging, allowing, and providing options for reports in that situation?
---
I get everyone goes afk during the queue sometime, but it's still reportable if you're actually afk inside the match itself, whether survivor or killer.
---
Anytime someone brought up my youtube channel they were like...
---
"Your channel is shit"
---
or when I felt fruatrated and tired and dc'ed they went...
---
"Add that to ur youtube channel lol"
---
That along with uncreativity drove me to off my channel, and make a new one, which I had yet to work on.
---
😂😂
---
Plauge
---
It's funny though. The screenshot is from when the game was ending so I obviously didn't even get to use the noed lol...
---
I mean, the sun sets around 4:15 where I am at, so it fits.
---
I won't lie. 
---
I was slightly aroused.
---
Boomer is a state of mind, not an age
---
no need to be a bitch about it. did someone hurt you or something?
---
No, that's more like saying:
---
"I agree that it's unfair to go against killers using the basement bug but it's apart of the game at this point and calling it toxic is wrong because they have to use it to kill. That's like saying camping is toxic." 
---
PSA: Because it's in the game.. It *is* a valid strategy. Nobody can knock that.. But it *is* also toxic so if someone calls you out on it, don't be surprised.
---
I’d honestly rather just have the option to disable grabs and just take the smack instead.
---
Nothing worse than grabbing someone, it letting go, and they escape away unharmed
---
My channel is pretty random, a little gaming and a live online talk show with a friend. Trust me, I’ve gotten the your channel is shit before! 😋 just like everything in life. A different tastes for different people.
---
Does it take 30 seconds to flip the switch?
---
This is a big step up from *”gg ez get fukt”* like I’m used to.
---
Good for those guys
---
I have spoken
---
She's got noed
---
So she hooked you basicly..  That means blood warden will become a thing!
---
I actually had a guy accuse me of this a month back when really it was just the survivors turning on each other.
---
Depends on how good they are at using the safe pallets for me, loops are huge and good pallets ridiculously easy to stall with or force a full bloodlust+chase reset (when it takes a good 20-30 seconds per safe pallet break just to catch back up) that being a man down doesn't mean much to an experienced survivor.
---
If the survivors aren't really tryharding in the match, however, I'll show some mercy towards the end, after I 2-hook everyone.
---
Basically I play mostly like I still mean it, but if I'm getting all the hooks I will let all the saves happen, always chase the unhooker even if they dive bomb, and focus down the most useless person among the remaining three if I feel they're just waiting for hatch instead of helping. :P
---
Then I decide how many to spare, some people will just kill themselves on the first hook immediately, which usually gets the other two mercy...
---
Though being robbed of a BBQ&amp;C stack means I have to make up the extra points somewhere.
---
Hahaha nice
---
Got any advice for starting a channel?
---
Be ready for DC every game after you down someone
---
End of year 4 will be June 2020 I believe, bc the game came out June 2016
---
Right? I don't understand this mindset that I really only see on reddit, killers here expect the last survivor to just be meek and submissive so they can give them the hatch with magnanimity, ignoring the fact that 9.5/10 times the last survivor is getting killed regardless. Then they have the gall to whine like they were about to do the survivor a favor, when there's literally no way for them to know that.
---
That's not even mentioning the killers who'll take you over to the hatch, only to then hook you right in front of it.
---
Go ahead and shoot
---
The chance of them getting free by wiggling when it takes like 15-16 seconds to wiggle out is minuscule unless there are too many broken hooks nearby, which usually never happens outside of dedicated hook distance offerings+sabotaging (killer generally will space out which hooks they use for sacrifice than sacrifice on two adjacent ones, etc).
---
Just don't wiggle and see if the killer has mercy.
---
She is a fucking MONSTER if you can secure a good 3-Gen and use Pop Goes the Weasel. Nobody can hide considering they’ll be vomiting, and no one can stay Healthy since you can just vomit on the Gens over and over while they regress.
---
Otherwise she’s basically just a permanent Tier 3 Myers. Smart Survivors/SWF won’t cleanse until the Gates are powered anyways.
---
I did have a pretty rotten relationship in my early 20s, thank for you asking. That doesn't really have any relevance to OPs question or mine tho. I hope the memes you make are better than your white knighting.
---
You’re about 6 months off
---
He’s perpetuating hatred and he IS calling people names, a harmful slur. Just because people say the n word in post game chat, doesn’t make that right either?? 
---
The reason I brought it up, wasn’t for ‘drama’, it was because the people in the dbd community are extremely diverse and in all are a wonderful community and there’s no place for people like that in it. People like that deserve to be outed. You’re showing your whole ass here and no one is going to agree with you.
---
Also they put out a message on Facebook saying they are going to take a temporary step back from content right now and work on game stability, I think they brought out one a little early so they could get onto that
---
I have the slim and it runs just fine
---
"We normally don't dc like that." Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
---
If he putes so fucking much effort just so say how mach he hattes gay people then I think that he probaly does something like that irl to and if he would have a gay son/daughter then he would probaly kick them out or beat them and that with the n word wtf does my comment have to do with that and tell me one multiplayer game where this doesn't happen and now a honest question wtf does the n word mean I realy don't know that I only know that its a bad word (sry I  don't know what to say about words like the n word in english)
---
That’s because they do. If you look closely you’ll see the knives in his glove do get bigger when he lunges. He still has the same lunge distance as other killers though.
---
I'm engaged to a lovely lady.  She'd probably get turned on if I were dressed as Myer's.
---
You can play the blendette build. Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Distortion/Sole Survivor, and Left Behind.
---
Play as a P3 claudette and do nothing. Don't heal anyone, don't touch a generator, don't rescue anyone, etc. Just wait for everyone else to die and grab hatch.
---
she’s just vibin, bro
---
It’s in a rough form, but do whatever you want with it.

Hold the Power button to apply the Spiralling effect to survivors in range (works similarly to The Shape’s Stalk). 
---
Survivors afflicted with the Spiralling effect are steadily progressing towards total self destruction. The Spiralling effect  will constantly progress towards the next stage. (Sort of like The Doctor’s Madness crossed with the Plague’s Sickness)
---
Stage 1: Slightly decreased Repair and Heal speed.
---
Stage 2: Greatly reduced Repair and Heal speed. Periodic Oblivious effect.
---
Stage 3: Constant Hex: Ruin effect applied to all Skill Checks other then those caused by Spiralling.
---
Stage 4 (Rock bottom): Survivors are completely unable to perform channeling actions. Survivors can attempt to Snap Out of It to return to Stage 3.
---
Survivors will be given periodic skill checks at all times. Hitting the skill checks will do nothing while missing will slightly advance their Spiralling effect.
---
Every time a Survivor advances a Stage of Spiralling, The Ruiner gains a bullet. The Ruiner can hold his Secondary Power button to pull out a revolver. The button must be held for 2 seconds before firing. Hit survivors suffer a single health state of damage.
---
Items will spawn around the map allowing Survivors to regress their Spiralling effect by 1 Stage, but The Ruiner immediately receives a bullet. 
---
Mori: The Ruiner holds out his revolver to the dying Survivor who hesitates a moment before taking it. The camera cuts to The Ruiner’s face as a gunshot is heard and the camera is stained with blood. The Ruiner picks up the gun and the game resumes.
---
Omg!!! This guy was actually doing it, he was running round with the killer showing him where everyone is and unhooking them so the killer could just hook them again. Assholes.
---
YES!
---
**[AAAIIIII-YAAAHHHHH!]** is Ash
---
Ikr? Anyone who gets hit with DS is a tunneler, how dare they so much as glance in a survivor's direction within 60 seconds no matter what the survivor does.
---
Seriously though this kind of shit in the video is amazingly BM/trolling, two people with an active DS at the same time? Even considering Oni has a one-hit down that's a stretch even if he is tunneling/camping, and jumping in a locker to force him to eat both and then also Head On is just 100% not the intended purpose of the perk.
---
Farming people off the hook shouldn't be rewarded with DS.
---
Put the Christmas Tree charm on your hook and call it a day
---
It doesn't mean calendar year.
---
Yeah obviously I can do that. You don't have to be an ass
---
thats the new buff for pig. i mean i wish it was only a meme but every time BHVR reworks a killer they give it like 20 powers at once from other killers... cough cough freddy cough cough
---
Someone’s a professional victim. Wasn’t being an ass AT ALL.
---
Dang son 😂
---
I like my sex mint-chocolate chip
---
ik you say you don’t dc (good on you) but this scenario you describe I feel is literally what the ‘leave match’ option was designed for. Sorry you had a shitty game like that.
---
He says it on Hook Struggle too
---
Ok boomer
---
“NEVER GO ASS TO MOUTH DUUUR”
---
*posts a video of someone teabagging, which isn’t even ass to mouth*
---
Great content, you’re right.
---
There’s no sign of intelligent life anywhere...
---
Yeah, I’m gonna have to say that’s a jerk move. Two DSs and a Head On to boot? It’s not a fun game for the killer.
---
Nice one \^\^
---
Indeed!
---
Lmao
---
True way too true
---
Agreed! He’s also creating a space where other homophobes can gather and spew their hatred. 
---
The N word means the derogatory name that racists call black people.
---
Ok my bad. Apparently they changed kindred.. It used to trump any stealth abilities the killer has.
---
You have to be honored
---
Hey, Wraith has movement options now!
---
I never realized that, I throw and go and I've yet to use Bill as a survivor.
---
No event generators or anything like that (bc we have the rift I think) but I’m hoping we at least get the Xmas lights
---
Interesting, I kinda like it. And you I think you just gave me an idea for a revised ability
---
I see it now, I thought you were talking about the OP. What a piece of shit
---
I don't remember the last time I purposefully 'chased' someone fresh off the unhook who wasn't either unhooked before I could even leave the nearest gen/break all the nearest pallets, or when I was led back to the hook via scratchmarks.
---
Even then I'm usually still trying to get the unhooker first, but they run in the same direction.
---
99% of the other times the survivor either (1) fast vaults into a locker, (2) runs into me like a melon - either right into my face or their scratchmarks within my LOS or (3) is on a generator.
---
Or I was all the way across the map chasing someone else, but their rescuer doesn't heal them, so I see them still injured through BBQ&amp;C after hooking someone because surely it's been 60 seconds now right? I just chased and downed some other dude through like 4 pallets.
---
Then they have DS up still anyway and stab me with it. x:
---
BBQ with Railgun Doctor (Interview Tape and high stim electrode) is hilarious since you can zap peoples auras across the map after hooking someone.
---
I've been practising a lot more as killer lately but I never play Nurse or Hillbilly because I just can't get the hang of them.
---
I just don't like playing as these two even if they're arguably 2 of the strongest killers in the game.
---
you clearly didn't read the whole post
---
Spirit yeah. Nurse is not the power role anymore. Especially when you can literally run in a straight line to make her less effective than a 115 killer
---
Works as you’d expect for me on a slim. My bf has a pro and his ps4 doesn’t sound like an attack chopper  getting ready to take off when dbd is loading like mine does lol.
---
...clown main. Catch me in the yellow ranks
---
Add Oni to the list of victims that the bully squads can take. 
---
Who all is that now? Wait...every killer? 
---
Uh oh...
---
Im in this image and i do not like it
---
That is a very old bug I think it was fixed but now it returns
---
You didn't even have Decisive Strike
---
No that's fucking stupid. If the killer is gonna show mercy then show mercy even if they wiggle who gives a damn what they do as long as it isn't toxic if you wanna let them go anyways
---
Once you master her she's a force to be reckoned with. I view perks as cheats with her and consistently 3-4k.
---
They don't show up if you own the killer they're for.
---
Cool tnx
---
Yes, but I would get punished for it. The others would get points and that didn't seem fair when I was trying to be a team player 🙁
---
You can record this stuff, along with player profiles, and report them via the in-game system and DBD website. If you give the proper information they will get banned.

&gt;GRIEFING: INTENTIONAL GAMEPLAY ABUSE
---
  
---
&gt;- Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates
---
We probably get a 2x bloodpoint event.
---
Ok but what people is he actually fucking hurting here? You literally brought it up in a thread where he was actually being nice to OP. I get the need to defend people from assholes but you aint going to solve shit by silencing others. Video game communities are going to have a toxic side to them, but thats just a part of the culture and tolerance. Tolerance is accepting people in spite of their beliefs, not outing someone for a post that isnt even relevant to the thread. If you cant handle what he has to say, you dont have to listen to it just like anyone else. Anyone should have a voice, but nobody should be forced to sit there and listen to it.
---
Yeah, they changed it. Now you can see everyone's aura and the killer's withing 16 meters if someone else is hooked as an added bonus to what it used to do. It honestly got a huge buff and I run it all the time.
---
Nice. I will have to try recording on PS4. I did report both of them under Griefing 👌
---
I know you probably don't care to much but:
---
1.Body blocking is when someone takes the hit for you
---
2.what feng did has many terms but most call it sandbaging
---
3.when a killer downs you and doesn't pick you up it's called slugging(the act of picking you up and putting you back down is called juggling)
---
4.when a killer stays right next to you when your hooked or downed its called camping, and if they're looking at you its called facecamping
---
It sounds like the feng made friends with the pig, which is awful for you. I'm sure the feng didn't mean to actually sandbag you, mostly because the game is very clunky. It really sucks when something like this happens, but you gotta try not to let it work you up. Remember to take a short break between games to get a drink or pace a bit. I hope you get into another game with that pig and break its ankles.
---
Imo, swap ds for iron will
---
Because people like you only play the easy half of the game. Try playing killer more and you'll get instant queues.
---
I figured that was the case, didn't know the exact month and was wrongly using January
---
Just give ace plunderer's instinct as his passive
---
Figured that was what I was missing
---
Back then, you only had to get a 4k to get merciless killer. They reworked the emblems, but the achievements haven't been updated to compensate, so now you need a beyond perfect game with suboptimal perks to get the achievement now...
---
Oh thats completely different. I was trying to complete a daily for hooking survivors in the basement and there were two slippery survivors who I kept getting looped by one of them got mad cause the loop ome guy used was near his apparent favorite hiding spot so when I chased him he'd end up caught. Eventually the survivor would point towards the other one whenever I had him cornered.
---
Do you play surv or killer ?
---
Both pretty equally!
---
Haha thanks, I'm taking a break now 😁 but Feng was intentional. I would've lost the pig and she had plenty of time to move. Enough time for me to point at her two times. 🤷 What can ya do. Thanks tho 😊
---
I only ever notice frame drops when playing as the Doctor, but I rarely play as him.
---
Hatred or bias without illegal actions isn't something you can thought police without infringing on other freedoms, even expressing (hate speech) those biases is covered under the principle freedom of expression, which - again - you cannot really police without infringing on other freedoms.
---
They may, in actual fact, violate Reddit's TOS and be punishable by Reddit (you can go support the Subreddit if you want), but from the philosophical position of being allowed to express yourself as long as you are not attempting to bring physical visceral harm (or threatening to bring such harm) to another...
---
That's the kind of thing you're not supposed to read if it offends you, I mean look at Hitler's manifesto (the Mein Kampf) if you want an example of sheer hatred that is allowed to exist in written form and, if it offends, you can simply choose to avoid.
---
It'd be like comparing Chick-Fil-A to Westboro:  
---
Chick-Fil-A actually still hires LGBT people and doesn't (by all reports) discriminate in a physical fashion or violate labor laws.
---
Westboro violates all kinds of laws in their protests and is physically disruptive and aggressive.
---
There's a difference between verbal and physical.
---
I can see that, with the amount of slugging I've met recently you basically never get the chance to use it..
---
Surv has wayyyyy more trash perks tbh. There’s like 6-7 *meta* survivor perks. But imo, spine chill is for newer players so if you’re alert and attentive you shouldn’t need it. Depends what kind of reduces you go for. BT is amazing but if youre constantly being smart about your rescues - unless the killer is camping - then you don’t *really* need it.
---
If your sprinting it won’t go down but if you perform any actions it will
---
Im not going to tell you what the n word is first off, just know its a derogatory term for black people. I aint getting in trouble for that. Anyways, the reason I bring up the example that people will use the racial slur in the end game chat is because thats exactly what happens. You guys are acting someone for being "toxic" and shit when he isnt the one really doing anything. You cant assume what someone does irl just because they say stupid shit on the internet. Besides, what if he just made it as an edgy joke? Then you're just attacking someone who doesnt even hold those beliefs. See what I mean? Dont assume the worst about people.
---
That's really nice
---
I'm on console so I'm not playing nurse and I don't play Spirit cuz she takes no skill.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion but i don’t think pig and legion are as bad as people make them out to be. Are they top tier? No, but thats fine.
---
Everyone keeps saying legion got nerfed into the ground but I wonder if they’ve even played legion since the patch. He feels a LOT better now in my opinion. 
---
Deep wounds and Pig’s RBT’s aren’t designed to get downs and kills they’re designed to waste time. Ever played against a pig who camps the last jigsaw box you need? Which is what they do. Not saying Pig and Legion shouldn’t get buffed but can we stop acting like they’re as bad as old freddy? 
---
Sloppy butcher is still good on legion, you’re gonna have to m1 the survivors eventually anyway. 
---
I encourage anyone who thinks legion is worse now to actually play him. 
---
As for pig you can mindgame the shit out of people with ambush. I would recommend watching Oh Tofu’s video on pig. He’s not even an amazing pig player and he surprised me to what he can do. 
---
I would personally but clown and doctor below legion and pig. Since freddy’s rework i feel like theres zero reason to play pig or doctor when you could just play freddy and shut down the loop just as quickly and you can teleport across the map to apply pressure.
---
that's literally what it means lol
---
Nurse said fuck that and took it like a CHAMP
---
Adam needs more cosmetics cause this is ridiculous, i know for male survivors Dwight, David, Ace &amp; Jake are like the top most played male survivors but they should really be doing something a little bit more for him.
---
I think its OP only because huntress hatchets  hitbox is so wonky at times
---
Not to be rude, but do you play much video games online? It's not just this game, it's practically every single one that involves other people.  I don't agree that DS, flashlights, BT, or NOED are toxic but there is definitely a lack of sportsmanship and respect for others.  Bottom line, you'll meet some fantastic people but they are few and far between which makes it seem like there aren't any.
---
I mean if the killer grabs you out once you get healed (they'll see when you get healed in their HUD after all), which he can do even if you try to fast-vault out immediately (and probably do regardless just by hitting the open locker prompt even if you have Head On since you're having to wait for Inner Strength first) you get injured immediately again.
---
You might still hit him with DS, but IS didn't help you.
---
WOW a rare apology!
---
oh she's broken broken
---
I need this. This is so fucking cool
---
Normal ps4 runs like crap. Ps4 pro is definitely better
---
It looks amazing
---
Did you even read my comment to the end?
---
:,(
---
You gotta set your location to the moon
---
That’s awful! It’s not your fault!
---
Playing on pro without problems.
---
Okay, this one got a good laugh out of me.
---
Survivor exterminator: Have a survivor hiding in your house but have iron will? Survivor exterminator will clear that out!
---
Thank you 😊
---
This isn’t even funny. As the killer I would be so frustrated and feel so humiliated. It’s just toxic and rude.
---
Claudette later calling the killer a tunneling piece of shit.
---
Whaaaaa??
---
My gripe with DS is that it’s too good at countering stuff that isn’t tunneling and then it’s honestly dogshit at countering tunneling. If you can slug the dude right off the hook and wait 60 seconds while he’s on the ground, yes you were tunneling, you just waited out the D strike timer to be an asshole. So here’s my idea to make it better. 
---
Decisive timer reduced to 30 seconds. If you are within 32 meters of the killer, the timer is paused. If you are downed by the killer, the timer is paused. 
---
Stun time upped from 5 seconds to 8 seconds. Skill check made easier to land (also fix the bug where you hit the skill check and even hear the sound, but you don’t get the stab). 
---
The DS skill check cannot be altered in any way. Huntress lullaby, Unnerving presence, madness, none of that will affect the DS check. 
---
Pros is that it’s more powerful against a tunneling killer, the killer cannot circumvent it by slugging or prolonging a chase by just following the survivor, (proximity based as well to stop zero TR killers from abusing it). Only downside is that it can be abused but that’s why you add this stipulation. 
---
“If the timer is not paused when another survivor goes down, DS will deactivate”. 
---
There ya go. You just fixed DS. 
---
Next up is BT? Simple fix, nerf mending time. BT got a buff it didn’t need recently, so revert that and make it so that it takes longer to mend. There ya go. 
---
Adrenaline? I could go on a rampage about how to adjust the perk to make it more fair (I even came up with an Adrenaline/NOED rework concept to make them both feel more fair). 
---
As for Dedicated hard? Yeah I got nothing, it only really works once lol. Just...yeah don’t whine it’s not that bad.
---
Do it because you want to. Our talk show gets 7/8 views and 3 people on average watching it live. My cohost and I do it because we love doing it. And it has lead us to making friends with some cool people. Make a channel if you want to make stuff. Create your own success. For me if I stream and have a hand full of cool people I’m good.
---
They can fix the fps and the gen Rush
---
If you want to do what makes you happy or whatever, I’m not gonna say you can’t or you shouldn’t. 
---
But i will say.... We play this game because we want to have fun and enjoy ourselves. I want to get on and have a game and move on to the next one hopefully proud from the last, but if you tbag and flashlight click like crazy just because you want to get a reaction out of someone is not that cool man. I personally don’t think it’s fun to anger or make someone rage if I can avoid it.  Yeah, people are sensitive. Yeah; a lot of us has mental health problems and video games are a coping mechanism. But to taunt someone inside of a game when all they wanna do is just play is a dick move in my opinion.  Especially when you’re actively seeking to do it.
---
The LegOni
---
Play Hag with her new spooky cosmetic and scare the shit out of people while securing a 4k.
---
He really thought you were in there
---
I definitely agree, and to some extent that includes Oni as well. It seems like DBD is going with this trend of letting killers have multiple powers now and while I do kind of like the idea, it's a little oppressive to play against.
---
The only Plague cosmetics I like are the Hallowed Blight and prestige skins. The rest feel too too similar to base Plague. 
---
Meanwhile, my girl Huntress has tons of good skins.
---
No. I’ll silence, out and shame bigots every day of the week. People like you are what’s wrong with the world. I will not be tolerant to someone that creates a community with the sheer purpose of spreading hatred. 
---
I don’t give a fuck what subreddit it’s in. I’ll confront bigots and assholes like wherever and whenever I see fit. Last I’m going to say on the matter because you’re thicker than the door to a safe.
---
Personally, I feel like it's alright on her. I don't love going up against a Huntress with it but overall she's not that strong of a killer and it just helps with her ability. Trapper has a similar mechanic where if you get caught in a trap, even if you release yourself, it still goes down. As it's impossible to bring every match it's rare you see them playing such things which makes them a bit easier to stomach.
---
Plus, once you go against Huntress enough, you tend to figure out how to loop her even with the hatchets and how to avoid being hit by one while ducking. Nothing is full proof, of course, but it all makes it a bit more manageable and easier to stomach for me.
---
Honestly DS has too much counterplay if ur trying to tunnel and not enough if you just stumble on it. I think it should have its frame of use tightened (this is a rather recent revelation for me. I know. But honestly I’ve gotta concede where I know I’m wrong) but be made stronger in that frame
---
I agree with this. The xbox one s and ps4 slim dont run it all that well. The one x and pro run it pretty well though. Still stutters sometimes though.
---
Yeah I know about that, and honestly, I don't think it's even that hard for them to change that. Like, come on, not everyone is a sweaty tryhard.... like me.. lol
---
Got Wraith and Nurse adepts today, so I'm happy with my skills :)
---
One part of me wants to say Jesus and that's the killer waiting to send them to him.
---
The other part says their praying to the devil and that's him emerging from the ground ready to be the next killer.
---
and on a side note, please, crop your stuff.
---
Well they disagreed and reported me. I havent played since but I assume ive been banned.
---
My perks? If that’s what you’re talking about I was doing a healing archive challenge but as you can guess it didn’t go so well
---
I really hate when I've let a survivor escape my grasp and rescue their friend after the other two survivors killed themselves on hook.
---
And when I try to carry them to Ruin they keep wiggling out, like both of them are on death hook and I had one hooked and one slugged right on my shoulder in front of a hook and I let them heal up instead of killing them both.
---
And I've passed by two hooks and they keep wiggling as I shake my head no and down them again and pick them back up.
---
It makes me want to just kill them. Wiggle = death.
---
I doubt it, the people reviewing (if it even gets reviewed) will see you didn’t do anything wrong, don’t worry 😊
---
I don’t want to be such a player I don’t like that play style no offence to people who play like that I just dislike it just like face camping, although I do it when the survivors are EXTREMELY toxic
---
Power: Frag Grenades
---
Then let's clarify the situation;
---
I refuse to accept racism is an acceptable part of any society, and anybody who willing accepts that being rascist is ok is on a moral equivilence with Nazis.
---
Be toxic on your own time in your own game. I'll just be over here NOT hating people just because they look different.
---
Potion seller... I am going into battle, and I need your strongest potions.
---
I’ll infringe all day. I enjoy infringing. I also have a fringe (bangs) so I’m perfect for the role.
---
Isn't this the fella whos mad about the upcoming dc penalties because he'll be penalized for auto dodging spirit/killers builds he dislikes?
---
It is! Are sounds messed up for anyone else though? Sometimes I hear an injured survivor from like 20 meters away as if they're right around the nearest rock, and it's super confusing. Not running Stridor.
---
Me: does the totems
---
You sir have been countered
---
You might be on to something there...
---
Then it’s gonna take another 20 minutes lol
---
New Nurse buff is too OP
---
yup, every time he goes against a baby spirit, he says “i woulda dodged her, but this was a good game”
---
YES. I can’t hear shit as killer like unhookings or footsteps and survivor audio is messed up too. Sometimes as survivor I’ll be doing a gen and it’s muffled when I’m not inside and the camera angle isn’t to blame, so I miss stealth killer’s footstep noises 😔
---
I used to think it was just dedicated servers causing objects to be closer than they appear, desync in position, but that despite all appearances the hit was legitimate.
---
The number of windows I've vaulted well in advance or killer's catching up during my exhaustion perk and downing me, pallets that don't drop when I hit space as I run by, or times I fall to the ground 5 feet from the window and then proceed to 'rubber band' another 5 feet away to where I was genuinely standing when I got downed is agony.
---
I dodged so many hits, I used to get like 2-3 whiffs a game, now every single one of them hits.
---
Ok well I hope you enjoy yourself that way, because I dont believe in silencing people just because they think that way. Pretty hypocritical to hate people for hate speech so, whatever. You and your high horse.
---
Pretty sure aftercare already looks like the meme.
---
Yes I did. Why? You have a problem with it? If so please explain.
---
How do you have two killers in one game?
---
I wouldn’t notice until 40 minutes because that’s usually how long it takes
---
Because we need killers on PS4

There was a subreddit called Alt Anti LGBT. It was a subreddit that promoted and incited violence against gay people. One dude posted saying in his country, homosexuality is illegal. So he reported his gay neighbors and was happy to see the police assault and brutalize them. That post got upvotes and positive attention. Shit like that, is fucking disgusting. He’s helping perpetuate and glorify the problems the LGBT community faces. 
---
And as a member of that community myself, I don’t advocate for censorship. But shit like that has no place in the modern world anymore.
---
It should be the kid going super sayin in the background. Ya know what I’m talking about right?

Level bill until you can get borrowed time in your blood webs and then meg for either sprint burst or adrenaline or David King for dead hard and then put them on Nea.
---
Hell yeah
---
No. Is this some kind of hack?
---
Dedicated servers will register the hatch as a miss. But the next hatch will clearly hit him after he runs around a corner.
---
Plus in the high ranks Killers 99% of the time never eat the DS if you got unhooked near them without BT or if they see you again within what they feel to be 60 seconds, they will slug you though because it applies free pressure
---
Edit: If there's an obsession*****
---
Me reading all caps Name in lobby: megs toxic, do ppl change?

Ah okay. How do you do it??

Faster recovery, and the ability to down more than one survivor.

You just brought back an old memory lmaooo, this guy?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1bHSR3WsRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1bHSR3WsRA)
---
Who cares what the dude says. Get a life.
---
Aesthetically, it’s one of the best maps in the game, primarily dude to the statues. To play on? Fuck that shit. I hate all the visual clutter. Granted I’m a killer main and I enjoy chases and hate hide and go seek, so maybe it’s just me.
---
You forgot iron will
---
Iron Will is necessary to be able to do much of anything against Spirit once injured. It's particularly nice against Nurse as well, and it helps you both in and outside of chases against all killers (well, not against Plague), allowing you to mindgame and hide when injured without the killer being able to just track or locate you.
---
You can run it over Adrenaline, since IW has a lot more reliable and consistent value. Or you could bring it over BT, since survivors will not seldomly have DS anyway.
---
Also, there aren't really very many great survivor perks, the pool of meta-viable survivor perks is if anything smaller than that for killers. But both of those pools are too small, with both sides having a ton of subpar perks that should all be buffed.
---
That’s the one!
---
corrupt, ruin, stbfl, pop
---
From a survivors POV all I'm seeing is they created space for their team to continue doing gens, literally the same thing as looping killer. From a killers POV I would be happy to get rid of 2 DS before gates open and now I know which two survivors had it. I was survivor rank 5 before the reset and killer rank 6, so I'm hoping I at least know a little about what I'm talking about. This game doesn't always have to be toxic this or toxic that, it actually takes strategies believe it or not.
---
That’s just the stories where they get away
---
Otherwise I’d expect to see more bubba
---
How
---
Yeah, easy ones. Enough that you need to pay attention, not like an overcharge check.
---
Honestly I really hope survivors get unique abilities of some kind at some point. Of course, balance changes should be provided around it.
---
Oh? Ive heard nothing but nightmare tales about getting reported. Like if you do your killers version of teabagging (revving chainsaw, blinking, actually crouching) even once they hit you with the hammer.
---
It's just way too easy to use a building and the safe pallets around it, and win a mindgame because the killer is so highly visible and has a terror radius that can be used to measure the distance from them by its volume.
---
The tricks to mindgame around a double-window loop or the side of a loop where you break LOS for half a second are limited enough that once survivors learn them, you can't do anything but chase them through it conventionally, toss on the sheer distance (you only move 0.6 m/s faster) a survivor can gain for every pallet break, safe loop, double-window/jungle-gym, and building with bloodlust constantly being broken...
---
It takes what, 2.6 seconds to break a pallet, losing bloodlust? Survivors move 10.4 meters in that time, which takes 17.3 seconds for the killer to catch up (actually a little more, since the survivor wasn't right next to the killer before the drop), at least doubled if the killer gets stunned and has to break it or go around it again instead.
---
Pallets are close enough together (I think they vary from 10 to 20 meters now) that a survivor will reach another, they're 10.4 meters away and move another 69.2 meters in the 17.3 seconds minimum it takes the killer to catch back up, in a straight line.
---
But they turn easier around obstacles and have more pallets, windows to force the killer to vault instead, and buildings, doing 3 loops around a pallet and dropping it/forcing the killer to break it and then running off to do it again is already 3 generators at 50% before you even reach the next pallet, you can do that two or three times and 3 gens will pop even through Ruin.
---
It's painful to play against red ranks.
---
When anyone being the spectator/s in the lobby, clicks the switch role button as soon as the last guy clicks ready, they swith to killer. If the last guy click ready and the spectators switch at the same time, this happens. It takes a while to load it tho.
---
She look like she just did 5 lines of coke
---
Nothin' personnel kid
---
Keys and mories should leave the game asap. Especially green keys.
---
And then the killer winds up being your teacher that called in sick, and they somehow recognize your login names. Then said professor gives you a report that’s due next class detailing what you all did wrong and they’re better than all of you.
---
This will probably get taken down but there is a dbd subreddit strictly looking for groups
---
Incorrect. The patch says it no longer does when they buffed it and even before that Kindred already couldn't Trump the Undetectable status effect that now every stealth feature has.

---

---
Haha that made me laugh more than it should have
---
That's generally how I think about it, yeah.
---
360% Hillbilly is going to one-hit-down you around pretty much anything because pallets just get eaten and he can zoom around the edges of loops and the whole nine yards of always closing right back up to you if you create distance.
---
Huntress getting 3 instant-down hatchets that are really bad around and loop with a wall and early pallet drops and force her to abandon you to even reload isn't going to mean anything unless you get caught in the open or somewhere too narrow to dodge, or try to stun her with the pallet instead of dropping it early and using it like another barrier/vault point.
---
But in what circumstances do you get caught like that? She's got 40 meters of lullaby to warn you she's coming, you're always going to reach a wall before she's close enough, and if she's sniping you from 40 meters (or more) away and you're not dodging it, that's not any more OP than getting caught in the open corn when you hear Billy revving.
---
The difference is that Huntress gives you more warning she is approaching, can only try it 3 times per chase, has to spend 13,000 bloodpoints for the combination, only moves at 110% speed, and has to use her perks for map pressure since it's not in her kit.
---
Hillbilly literally gets all of that, and has 4 free perk slots and 2 free addon slots, people who don't use the lullaby radius as a find-cover warning deserve the hatchet they get. x:
---
We were playing on auto haven so it wasnt hard at all for her to hit her hatchets. But compared to trapper its a big difference because trapper is a pretty weak killer huntress isnt, trapper has to go out of his way to get his traps one at a time then place them in the location he wants wasting a ton of time and on top of that they can be disarmed. Huntress on the other hand can hold 5 at a time and go to a locker and grab 5 more, 7 if you have the add on. The huntress in my game ran the one hit add on and the extra hatchets add on so she had 6 one hit hatchets which made the game 10x easier for her
---
who cares what i say. get a life
---
Do you use the app?
---
The only thing that really matter the gen Rush is not fixed
---
On PS4 they are instant because so few people play killer and there are constantly survivors waiting around to get matched up with them.
---
Why is it always the wraiths to facecamp
---
I see nothing. this is some next level witch hunting or he's just deleting everything I guess
---
Love his confidence
---
People don't play those killers for a reason. they are pretty trash.
---
It doesn't have more, it's that it has less people playing killer. Meaning there are a lot of survivors sitting around in lobbies waiting to get matched up with a killer, so when you queue up as killer you get matched up with one and into a game immediately.
---
See my hatchet throws are usually very tactical I like to bait the survivor into throwing down a pallet under the assumption that I will either try to go around or break it because by the time they finish the animation and get ready to start moving again I have my hatch it aimed right at them and they fall for it over and over because most huntresses don't do it that way if I know there is a palette coming and I see them going for it I start getting my throw ready.
---
 Let's also not forget that when you're holding the hatchet throw you are moving slower so they have more time to get ahead of you and get around a corner while you are charging up the throw.
---
 Just an hour ago I had a game the proves that the Hill Billy on his own is more broken because he was running barbecue and Chile all he did was change saw his way across the map down somebody hook them and then immediately go for the next person because there was nothing we could do we finished 2 generators before we were all killed and yet people say barbecue and Chile is an overpowered when it literally shows the killer where you are at all times unless you are hiding in a locker and even then if they hook somebody and they don't see 3 auras   They assume you are nearby and camp the hook nobody wants it nerve to because they want the extra blood point game when there's no reason it can't do that but get rid of the reading or make the reading have a distance limitation.
---
 Meanwhile they wanna get rid of the only combination of the huntress hatchett that is actually any gilet the hatchets are usually for slowing people down or getting the finishing blow after they are already injured the for they can start to loop you or while they are in the middle of looping if you hide behind chest high cover and duck that hatchet can't even hit you.  If you zigzag during the throw it's more likely to miss and if you only have one throwin you miss you have to reload which means you're screwed you have to give up the Chase or stay on the Chase and waste time.  If anything the infantry belt makes it fair because I'm willing to bet you all these people complaining about the huntress don't see her that often so they don't know how to Dodge the hatchets because they've never played as her themselves  And have absolutely no idea how hard it is to actually be accurate.
---
 You will never be 100% accurate with those throws and you will always miss 2 out of 3 unless you get lucky or you catch them not moving.  That 1 hit KO has won me games because I was able to throw the hatchet at a long distance while the person was opening the door if I had to hit them both times they would have escaped because the door comes open and they get hit And even then it's not a perfect way to win
---

So anyway, I started clicking

Do the lockers open??
---
Omg yes, that's it. Now I really feel like fixing it and uploading it again. I don't know if it's worth it though.
---
It was my girst game with infinite t3 myers and I got gen rushed into oblivion. I fidn't want to leave empty handed.
---
This wont even come close to working

I'm seriously considering unironically using Urban because of them.

i used to wear that outfit with pride, now, i am filled with a deep sadness
---
# Squats
---
Go ahead and upload it with the fix, I'll give you another upvote! And you'll also like it more that way instead of settling for this one
---
there are no bubba mains because there's nothing to learn with him.
---
The season probably restarted. I don’t play dbd but that’s what I’m assuming that’s the case.  Ranks probably reset too but don’t take my word for it because I don’t even play dbd
---
no
---
What are you implying? That people will just wait out the entire 2 minutes and she will find no one and get nothing done? 
---
During that time she will mostly be able to keep the survivors on one side. And if they aren't on that side, they aren't doing objectives. She can begin to get everyone infected while at the same time preventing the very strat you said was good to  counter her. Not sure how that's bad? 
---
Like watch fungoose play plague. He doesnt have that problem lol
---
It’s infuriating and beyond stupid. 
---
At launch, Killers were ranked exclusively on kill count. “Merciless Killer” just meant you got a 4k. Getting “Merciless Killer” with just a killer’s base perks only required a 4k. Totally rational and understandable. Still hard for some killers but eh. 
---
The Emblem reworks to make the pip system COMPLETELY fuck killers over didn’t account for Adept achievements. Now you’re straight up fucked if you wanna get any Adept Killer achievement past rank 19.
---
every killer in this game is viable hes got some stuff
---
Luckily on console wait times are only 5 mins for killer
---
big iridescent head play
---
That's more of matchmaking just being bad. I'm talking about rubber banding mid game not able to commit to long chases
---
And this is when i'm all ears...
---
Same, Franklins with a full gen slow build.
---
Me either, btw what is dbd?
---
Dead by Daylight. It’s just a abbreviation
---
&gt;it's the undisputed best exhaustion perk
---
Sprint Burst is the best, but most dont want to use it because they think it means you can never run
---
Sprint burst literally makes every gen a safe gen, counters stealth killers, can be 99ed for instant distance, doesnt have any requirements for proccing(hills, injured, etc) SB is basically a safety net of guaranteed instant distance. 
---
DH is a good perk, but not the best. Plus its counters of just baiting it out, any 1 shot, latency issues, exhaustion addons ie Berus Toxin, etc.
---
Hmm yes it allows the survivor to watch South Park
---
I’m scared
---
I usually do this because survivors on Xbox are so bad I feel sorry for them.
---
That and I don't like pipping as killer the higher I climb the less fun I have and the more teabags and flashlights I see.
---
If you installed on steam right lock DBD from the library list and go to properties. From there go to open folder location (or whatever the button is to go to the game folder) and go into the EAC folder and click the installer. Reinstalling EAC fixed the problem for me. Hope this helps.
---
no shit i had a game last night where someone d/c'd at the start so i decided i would let them all leave but i was gonna get as much bp as i could in the meantime. i was chasing and dicking around with one survivor while the other 2 got 2 or 3 gens done. then after maxing out basically everything that wasn't sacrifices, i hooked one guy and he suicided on hook. so then i hooked a nother guy and the last dude left him for dead on his first hook to find the hatch, so out of anger for the dude he left to die, i found him and killed him also. they took the simplest bp farm game with 3 escapes they ever would had and turned it into a 3k for me
---
As a cop, I can promise you that in no way am I stepping anywhere close to a case where it's infringing on the 1st Amendment.
---
Yes, it's distasteful to hold biases or prejudices against any particular group for no apparent reason, but it's also something that's allowed to exist. So long as the thoughts are not manifesting into behavior, then they have every right to maintain their positions, as ill-conceived as they may be.
---
You don't get to say to one person that their expression is fine and another's isn't. There's no objective standard; at least, not when you're trying to hint at legal intervention. I can guarantee if the shoe were on the other foot, you'd be decrying the use of legal intervention against what you would claim is your own freedom of self expression. 
---
You don't get to wield the legal club and use it strictly for your own benefit without the same happening to you.
---
And hatred of homosexuals is *not* homophobia. People conflate things on a regular basis anymore, particularly those on the left side of the political aisle, but to forget the word "phobia" that exists in the word, and to instead use it as your own type of pejorative, is dishonest at best. Phobia implies an irrational fear. You don't have to be irrationally afraid of homosexuals to bear hatred for them.
---
Again, is it distasteful and disrespectful to harbor biases? Sure. It'd be nice if we could live in a world where nobody held any level of prejudice, but that's not reality, and so long as people's thoughts don't manifest into behavior, there's nothing you can do about it.
---
DS is now an anti toxic perk and in a great place right now
---
I agree that logically if you want to win the game, tunneling down the weakest link is the most optimal way to “win”, but doing that is just toxic for the game.
---
If you tunnel someone who is say, hooked in the basement, they basically can’t play the game if you decide to instantly come back the moment they get unhooked.
---
There is no other consistent counter play to tunneling other BT/DS, tunneling is also
---
1) Incredibly easy to pull off, injured survivors are pretty much too loud to stealth away unless running strong stealth perks or you had to use a poor choice in hook
---
2) Incredibly rewarding of pulled off, not only do you keep another player out of the game, there is a good chance you hit the unhooker or have another pop/BBQ flash of the others now and can keep the momentum going
---
ty gonna try it right nw
---
D'aw, thank you! I didn't use any personal in-game photos so google was my best friend for this one. It's nice that you acknowledge the time I put into it so once again, thank you very much!
---
Best of luck to you too. I am learning to just give up once they start an infinite. But when the infinite is right next to a gen it hurts the game.
---
Good for you screw him for ruining your fun!
---
Why bring enduring and brutal if all the pallets are unsafe?
---
Do you play huntress ?
---
Well, there is some muscle memory and Bubba's skillcap comes from mindgames and timing rather than mechanical skill, the problem with bubba imho is threefold:
---
* Everyone just assumes he is bad and dumb.
---
* Most people who play him play him bad and dumb so no one is the wiser.
---
* A lot of his stuff is downright broken. Addons don't work, hitboxes are wierd, the charge timing can fuck you over.
---
Let me know
---
Live action Ash is retired! But the evil dead series is not nor is the character of ash. ( comics, animations, video games, etc.)
---
Yeah and it's wrong 🙃
---
i had fun. i was mad he fucked over his teammate for the hatch when i was planning on letting all 3 escape
---
No, my aim is awful. But I’ve heard she’s more difficult to play on console.
---
I would honestly recommend giving billy a try. For the infinites just try and ignore survivors that run those loops bc it just wastes time you don't have. He is really good at pressuring gens all over the map and once you get good enough with his chainsaw you will get to rank 1 in no time.
---
I usually do it and the Spirit either becomes confused as shit or knows what im doing and I get fucked
---
probably because they're easier to bully
---
It's true.
---
That DS change is a huge buff, to the point where it's broken.
---
So say you get unhooked and the killer is, say 20m away. As long as you stay in the Killer's terror radius you can basically do whatever you want. Body block, do a gen, whatever. If it didn't go down while in the terror radius then it could last forever.
---
Why increase the stun time? This is just a bad idea. 5s is enough.
---
And pausing the timer while downed? That's ridiculous. So with your version of DS you could just stay in the terror radius and then once you get downed the killer is fucked. Either they pick you up and you stab them, letting them escape OR you leave them on the ground.
---
This would lead to killer's camping a downed survivor until they died from being on the ground. I'm glad you're not in charge of balancing DBD, because this shits fucked.
---
And that is why u always 99 the gate
---
Like generator skill checks or Overcharge or Demo's portal?
---
Would a bonus be received for hitting them?
---
I played him so much and loved him, but then I played oni for awhile and have no muscle memory for bully anymore. Also it seems that they and just turn a corner for him to miss. I'm probably just dumb but I could give him another shot.
---
Not an outfit
---
I have never ever found the hatch when I have a key.
---
How is it any fairer for you, as a rank 17, to face off against a team of rank 10+ as it is for me, as a rank 9, to face off against rank 15s and a rank 9?
---
no im not the killer in this scenario either
---
I'm saying that part of the reason SOLO survivor is awful is because you get randoms that are rank 15+ that have less than 30 hours in the game who have no idea whatsoever how to play against specific killers and perks. Meanwhile your opponent for those games will ALWAYS be the same rank as you or at least within 1 or 2 ranks in either direction. They likely have a fully kitted killer and plenty of experience. You're essentially in a 1v1 where you want to slam your head against a wall because you have NO team.
---
Made 2 versions of the pool noodle oni

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eapwv4/most_people_after_342/favose1
---
I would like to face some other killers besides the ones the Meta claims are the best. Just to stop the game from being stale.
---
Really? For me it's the exact same opposite, it'd often mess up with the space bar
---
Nvm I forgot that BBQ isn't a perk from the legion :( guess I get to do that again
---
Whenever OP Addons are discussed iri heads are always first to be brought up. I would change it so it can’t be used with other addons if that’s possible. I would go up against an iri head huntress if it meant she couldn’t bring an infantry belt.
---
Make em even worse. Rub a salt pouch in the wound
---
Freddy is definitely strong enough to get to rank 1. As you get higher up the ranks you’re gonna need a strong build to win consistently. Look for a strong 4th perk to round out your build. I’d recommend Pop Goes the Weasel and maybe even replacing Sloppy Butcher  for Discordance.
---
When did this happen and what platform?
---
One thing that helped me alot with him is binding q and e to his left and right for turning (if you play on PC). Then just practice turning on loops and killer shack.
---
People undervalue the individual because they are so used to the corporate conglomerate :c
---
Last night and on xbox
---
Check the body, it's not a full outfit
---
Rip dude, good luck on ur task
---
Legion needs a fucking rework at this point. Throw the old concept away and make something new
---
literally no one I've played against cares if you wiggle if they're giving you hatch
---
No. Stop begging and go away.
---
I would've been okay with the opportunity to waste 2 DS's, but then the extra Head On would have pissed me off ngl.
---
I'm glad you're also someone who puts a decent amount of time and effort into memes. If you need something like a part of a screenshot made transparent or anything I can help, I've been trying to make things people can use instead of slapping text over meme templates.
---
Iron will is OP. Watch FunGoose on YouTube and twitch and he uses it to mind game jungle gyms all the time

i would think it would be like pig's trap removal where if you mess up it gets reset and great's giving bonus percent

I have done that. And I was good with him before. Just gotta get back into it.

She can’t find them in Jacksonville!

It's really wholesome when people admit to the fact that they were assholes. The mere fact that you acknowledge that you were a jerk proves that you're far less of a jerk than the average jerk. You can't improve if you don't admit that there's a problem, and the fact that they admit it and apologize proves that they're willing to improve. :)
---
Thats amazing isnt it

Aii, found it, thanks. I swear I clicked through all while looking for it \^

Ohhh ok thanks
---
Fair enough. I didn't really think about that tbh, jacking the price just to reduce demand a bit because you can't keep up is totally valid haha. How'd you go about modelling it? It looks great
---
If a survivor is aiming to bodyblock tuen they aren’t doing gens. That’s 1 less dude on a gen and if ur chasing one dude that means there’s 2 people not doing gens. 
---
Currently if you really wanna tunnel, DS isn’t doing anything If they’re adamant about it. Personally I don’t find that to be fair.
---
Surely making subreddits specially about that hatred is a behavioural manifestation of said hatred? The 1st Amendment is also a specifically American thing, the internet isn't. Other countries have their own rules/laws on this kind of stuff.
---
As I said it also breaks Reddit's rules so the guy was far from "in the right" in the first place and that places a form of objective standard.
---
Different countries also have different laws around this kind of stuff, so it's not as black and white as saying "he can say what he wants".
---
Also I can do something about it: what I'm doing now. If they have the right to do such distasteful things I have the right to fight against it.
---
tbh it wasnt that difficult, apart from the nurse ones
---
“We really wanted a fun gaming experience for our last match in your style didn’t give us that..” idk that just strikes me as patronizing, regardless of the next friendly message. Like regardless of how their day was going they didn’t like his style. How can you get mad over how someone plays unless their cheating or  intentionally taunting you? I’d like to see these kinds of people to play fighting games. It would make them shut up real fast.

Your sound effects were perfect! XD

Rule 6 means the game just closed before EAC closed. So this crashing has nothing to do with EAC. Try replicating the crashes. When and what are you doing when the game crashes etc?

You have better luck waiting for all eternity for BHVR to add cross progression to be frank. Usually BHVR only gives bps to corrupt save file victims.

I ran streetwise (for more toolbox usage), aftercare (find teammates from long distances) and lithe to lose the killer to do more gens. Works pretty well, and u can replace aftercare with distortion to hide from bbq
---
&gt; He’s perpetuating hatred
---
So? If it doesn't manifest into behaviors, why do you care? You certainly aren't opposed to perpetuating hatred towards people you deem homophobic (which isn't a correct use of the word), so what makes your stance any more correct, objectively speaking?
---
&gt; he IS calling people names, a harmful slur
---
So what? Words are just that, words. They are not physical violence, despite all attempts by the left to make them as such with all of this nonsensical talk of microaggressions and the like. 
---
&gt; Just because people say the n word in post game chat, doesn’t make that right either??
---
What does this have to do with anything? You seem to have a whole host of issues with correlation and causation.
---
&gt; because the people in the dbd community are extremely diverse
---
Who cares? Racial composition matters to only 1 group: racists. There's nothing particularly special about being white/black/hispanic/asian when playing this, or any other, game. Behavior is not tied to ethnicity, and if you believe so, *you* are the racist one, not the person you're attempting to shout down.
---
&gt; and in all are a wonderful community and there’s no place for people like that in it
---
You don't get to make that determination, bub. I don't know what sort of indoctrination you've been brainwashed with, but you don't get to be the great moral arbiter simply because you don't like someone for their viewpoints. Nobody gets that endowment, save for people inside their own echo chambers, which you seem comfortably nestled in. 
---
&gt; People like that deserve to be outed
---
Ok? And what next? Do you pitchfork up and go throw rocks at their house? Do you realize that you're becoming the very thing you find hateful? If the Klan can't march, assemble, and throw rocks at the homes of black folks, then why can *you*, and those who think like you, march, assemble, and throw rocks at the homes of people you have ideological confrontation with? Aside from your own tightly clutched pearls and virtue signaling, who gets to be the ultimate decider on who is the "correct" party in the matter? What if *you* were the one that was the one being opposed? You certainly are up in arms about someone not liking something, so why is there this double standard?
---
&gt; and no one is going to agree with you
---
Great! Wonderful! Disagreement! There doesn't have to be a grand monolith, despite what you may have been tricked into believing. People can hold conflicting opinions with other people, regardless of who deems themselves the most morally "right". We're here to play a video game, not to be some sort of cul de sac community. Stop trying to make this into something it isn't. 
---
Words are not violence, nor will they ever be. So long as you are not inciting someone to violence or calling for violence to be committed, then anything you say is completely guarded by the wonders of the 1st Amendment, and you don't get to decide based on your own subjectivity who is worthy of its protection.
---
You need to get hired by Behaviour right now

It's a sprint burst bug from what I've seen, and no one is getting banned like other exploits because no one knows how it triggers and it happens out of nowhere. One moment you're playing as usual next moment you're the flash.

Play DbD on Switch. Boom.
---
Mint Rag is nice for this, since if they try to avoid ur trap u can tp to it anyway
---
Gen rushing isn’t the survivors fault. It’s their only objective. Would you rather they go make a sandwich, come back, and then start working on gens?
---
Well, you don't have to, but the point remains the same. You don't get to be the ideological fascist standing there wielding the governmental club unless you want the exact same thing turned around on you. So either grow a bit of a spine and realize that you're not the center of attention, or just get off the internet if you need to be sheltered that much.

None of that made sense. Username certainly doesn’t check out.
---
Come on now, you know Dad wouldn't say that...
---
........There's a dead by daylight mobile game? I've only seen dead before daylight but that's not the same.
---
Try and use dead hard, you always get hit AND still get exhaustion applied
---
Cutie.
---
It’s ok as long as they don’t complain about the killer camping afterwards. After all, it’s their objective to sacrifice the survivors and they aren’t just gonna hook someone then leave so that they escape
---
I usually go Mint Rag with Orchid Necklace or Bloodied Mud. Black ward for Add-on because mint Rag is hard to come by
---
Definitely not if the gates are open and in range of the survivor
---
Its so bad, but not as bad as gideon imo
---
Let me have my moment 😭
---
Rip Oni Literately lasted 1 week
---
I do like it, however it would make more desirable survivors even better, though most survivors and killers have at least one decentish skill.
---
I thought just giving a really small passive bonus to each survivor (that you could possibly increase slightly with a prestige, maybe) would be simple enough.  While some will invariably be stronger than others, the idea is that they would all be really small bonuses, like scratch marks disappear .5 seconds faster for Kate, or Claudette heals 5% faster.  Bonuses that you wouldn't really have to worry about building around, but could if you really wanted to min/max.
---
If all gens are done camping is completely acceptable and this is coming from a full meta perk asshole survivor main.
---
Dbd mobile is only available in some countries, I changed my store to Australia to get it.
---
it usually appears after one match and just crashes so far,don't really know what else would count,(also i have to go now,i will have to continue this conversation tommorow)
---
*laughtrack*
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
If you're saying he's camping because the gens were done that's perfectly fine. What else is the killer supposed to do once he's hooked someone and all gens are complete? Especially if the endgame collapse has started meaning a door is already open?
---
Hold B on console, not sure for pc
---
On PlayStation it’s holding the circle button so I think that’s the A button on switch? You have to hold the button for a second not just tap it
---
Circle PS4, I think B on xbox, whatever the right button is.
---
On a scale of toad to rhino why are you so horny?
---
Neck:*exists*
---
Tv: I’m going to end this man’s whole career
---
u/fakerfakington seem to say otherwise.
---
Nothing wrong with showing some love to vommy mommy.
---
Damn I knew someone would make a meme out of this
---
This is what my self-esteem tells me I look like
---
I always use Spine Chill. I literally abuse stealth killers and can always can tell if they're faking.
---
Or it'll go 2 feet to the right, but the servers will register it as a hit
---
Well, if the killer wasn't as dick cheese as it comes in terms of power.
---
There wouldn't need to be DS/Ruin always available in Draft. Fewer options means more diversity and less of a reliance on the meta
---
And ghostfaces mori is a lot more enjoyable than that cold stare of myers
---
r/commentsyoucanhear
---
Before this it was Ghostface, and it just went to show that basically if he plays something and enjoys it, he's just going to act like that means they're strong and such, when everyone who just plays the game, most especially those who play survivor a fair amount, already knew these killers were not only plenty viable, but in the case of someone like GF, are  quite fucking strong.
---
Tru3's opinions have always been shit for me, I don't really understand why anything he's been saying recently is any more important or impactful than any other time.
---
&gt; specially about that hatred is a behavioural manifestation of said hatred?
---
And what sort of behavior is happening? Are people being burned, assaulted, killed? No? Is it just a bunch of people in a group echoing each other's contempt for a particular group? Yes? If so, then *who the fuck cares*? 
---
A correct example of thoughts manifesting into behaviors is someone having deep hatred for homosexuals which results in targeting with physical violence. Say you just absolutely hate gays, and because of that, you make it your mission to punch every one of them that you meet. That's a behavioral manifestation. Private people and private businesses can discriminate in any manner they see fit because the only protection granted is when the action is done by the federal government. If your local diner doesn't want to serve you because you're gay, black, or whatever else, they should be permitted to do so. The free market will see to it that they are eradicated because all it takes is another diner to open up and say "we serve everyone". Invoking the government to side with your plight is a slippery slope because if it's possible for it to be used for you, then it can certainly be used against you. You'll be happy for it to be used for your purpose, but indignant when it's the inverse. 
---
&gt; As I said it also breaks Reddit's rules
---
Which is fine, again, because it's a *private* company creating the rule. Is it becoming clearer when I said if it can be used for you, it can be used *against* you? As for objective standards, hardly. It's a subjective standard, and that's fine. The point is that the entitlement is present.
---
Let's take an example of Site A and Site B.
---
* Site A forbids anti homosexual rhetoric. Site A refuses to allow any postings or groups to be formed that would perpetrate such a violation of its rules.
---
* Site B forbids homosexuals. Site B refuses to allow any postings or grouped to be formed that would perpetrate such a violation of its rules.
---
For Site A, you'll have cheering and support, but for Site B, you'll find indignation and condemnation. Why? I'll tell you... Because the group that's being forbidden is inconvenienced. Again we come back to the "if it can be used *for* you, it can be used *against* you position.
---
&gt; Different countries also have different laws
---
No kidding, which is why I'm glad I live in, and was born in, America, the greatest country in the history of the world for freedom. To be able to be jailed because you made a statement that someone finds unsavory is highly problematic. To be that beholden to the federal government that they can deprive you of your freedom specifically because you stood opposite of them ideologically is extremely dangerous. Ask the millions of Jews sent to their death how it felt to stand ideologically against the federal government. Not just the Jews, but anyone who aided them. How's that for a wake up call?
---
&gt; what I'm doing now
---
And what is that? Posting comments on a subreddit admonishing someone? What do you gain from that? Karma? Your own personal sense of satisfaction? You're "fighting" a nameless, faceless, person, whom the likelihood of you ever interacting with on a face to face basis is astronomically low. You clearly are not going to change the person whom you're "fighting"'s mind, and they clearly won't change yours either, so what do you actually stand to gain?
---
If it makes you feel better to shout at someone or attack their character because they don't think like you, then *you* are the person with the issue, not them.
---
It baffles me how people don't truly check the store, despite saying they do.
---
I love playing clown and doctor, but if I do i get shat on by anyone who knows vaguely what they are doing. No thanks.
---
I had a game where i never tunneled and actively swapped out players with less hooks to take the bait on another, Unfortunately 2/3 of them looked a like and one idiot kept pushing center gen before healing like the others (it was a swf) so I would usually end up getting the hook on that person until he D/c'd for being stupid. I'd much rather block them than respond at this point
---
I had this happen once, too. Did the Killer drop the survivor? I don’t think it counts toward the challenge if the survivor isn’t freed.
---
Oh my god it's fucking real
---
NOED and Keys need nerfs.
---
&gt; TLDR
---
Well, thanks for at least being honest enough to admit that you're too lazy to do anything except screech your parroted points. I guess you getting this level of triggered will keep your therapist in business.
---
EDIT: What's bigoted about advocating that someone be free to say what they please? Give me one single example of where I'm bigoted, or you're just a piece of shit levying charges without evidence. If *you* are free to say what you please, why not someone who doesn't think like you?
---
Peeeepa pig, oink oink
---
I mean that is true. But it is funny. Blame the damn achievement take one for the team. I have to hook bomb. So this is the funniest way to do it
---
Been running this sweater myself on Xbox to spread the Christmas spirit to survivors. Sadly I've only gotten a bunch of hate. :(
---
But really,Why and how?
---
Of course it doesn't make sense to you. You're too lazy to do any level of thinking, and instead want the comfort of your own beliefs.
---
Cognitive dissonance can be harsh for people like you, I guess.
---
So for the blind challenge it wants you to actually save them from the killer, not just blind them. The emblem challenge is looking for red medals not gold.
---
Yeah, the clown dropped the survivor and he chased me down. 
---
I'll try it again,  I'm just really bad at flashlight saves so I was excited to get it done finally.
---
That was he case before they got undetectable, Now most of them are myers
---
What happened?
---
Look at your controls.
---
I love Hawkin's especially when I play survivor. A few semi-safe pallets, corner pallets than can be safe if it is linked to a room, and loops that actually take skill and patience on the survivor's part. 
---
Sadly I get put with people who panic and throw down pallets as soon as the prompt starts and go down.
---
Even then you sit there and stare at it for 2 seconds before you smack it.
---
Additionally it's only a 'behavior' in the loose sense, since it's still communication-based/dealing with text that (if in America at least) it would be your freedom to read out loud.
---
Journalism is technically a behavior, so is reporting, taking a job as a newscaster, but it's all just words.
---
As long as it remains words, anyone can express hatred, a position of being biased against the LGBT (or even hating them) isn't any different in the eyes of the law than a person's right to be biased and hate anything else, it's not something you can stop unless it starts physically assaulting people over it.
---
I'm training to be a cop myself.
---
I always hate these dumb ass fucking comments/opinions.
---
What the fuck do you want from them? They apologized. They can't fucking magically dive into the heads of everyone and figure out the exact words that will somehow magically fix the whole situation if they say them in the right order to make you fucking happy.
---
You're not accepting it because you disagree with their initial attitude and post, not because something was wrong with their apology, or anyone elses. This is how it ALWAYS is.
---
People like you act like they need to commit suicide in order to please the fucking gods, it's so stupid. You act like they beat someone half to death, as opposed to just saying something a bit insensitive that isn't even that big of a deal, if not for the RIDICULOUS pc culture that exists currently.
---
They don't hate Quintin, they just don't have the rights or licenses to give him cosmetics yet.
---
It all started with a cube... Haha the classic Blender cube
---
 Of course I deleted it immediately; shift+A - add mesh &gt; cube.  
---
 lmfao
---
Just play how you want.
---
The level 2 tier has a gold emblem challenge, while level 3 has the red.
---
And the killer did drop the survivor, then chased me. So I'm not sure where that one went wrong
---
I only use Self care if I also have botany knowledge along with it, Botany knowledge is equal to a 66% speed bonus to your self care speed and it's also kind of nice if you want to heal others faster
---
Starting endgame collapse honey
---
I mean, clown literally laughs everytime he hits people.
---
I wish that seat was my face.
---
No, not really, she's pretty mid tier
---
Omfg I literally just joked about wearing that exact skin to a match, but no flashlight
---
Now make a generator lamp!
---
She is pretty thicc
---
Deepwounds was always harmless. Literally nobody was dying to DW before the "nerf". Show me a 4k using only DW before...oh wait you can't cause that aspect of FF was always harmless. It was only meant to buy you time, which it still does.
---
Quin...ton?
---
The poor poor Claudette
---
It's like r/deadbydaylight and r/bonehurtingjuice had a baby.
---
I had to change my Steam profile name to something like, “Flashlight save, please.” The very next game I had a nice huntress let me get a flashlight save right at the beginning of the match.
---
Lmao what a camper play, noob killer camping gens
---
I think there's something weird with their licensing with them
---
Iron Will throws me off when I track through walls by sound.
---
I always loop em into oblivion.
---
im a survivor main and i hate lery game and this is 1 because its not even fun on these maps i like open maps
---
He’s thinks everything is a literally joke even the death of the innocent people running from him
---
How it feels to chew 5 gum.
---
And saying "Doings Gens, You?"
---
Yeah! Like the overcharge or portal ones. That’s perfect. Bonus for hitting it, penalty for not. So one of the large solid ones.
---
Edit: I realize the bonus for and penalty for not is a wash. Lol. So probably just a penalty for not hitting it.
---
Stress is not being able to accomplish any of your dailys, rift challenges, or achievements because every trial is another infuriating, toxic, laggy mess that gets you ridiculed in the DM's for being a burden to everyone else's wonderful life. Welcome to Dead By Daylight.
---
GG. I ain't ever getting platinum on this. I suck hard with the nurse! Lol
---
I think this is only a reddit and streamer thing. Haven't heard this from anywhere else.
---
How much for one?
---
Seems like he's on Xbox so I'm fairly sure it's the host's internet
---
I never leave the campfire without Iron Will, assuming I have it on who I'm playing. It's my crutch perk.
---
I'm on Xbox, sadly.
---
Just one more reason to switch to PC
---
Thank you :)
---
I mean I was doing a sick 3 gen defense but there was still 4 survs left. I was just patrollin, what else could I do?
---
Thanks, cosplay took hours to make.
---
big iridescent brain
---
Flashlights are very easy to avoid tbh
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ear3wo/is_it_true_that_pc_has_more_cosmeticsskin_abd/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It was a joke homie, a satire on what survivors could possibly say about getting pulled off of a gen
---
&gt;But imo, spine chill is for newer players so if you’re alert and attentive you shouldn’t need it
---
I feel like this used to be the case but because ghostface is pretty popular and it's decent to help against spirit, it's still really valuable.
---
Then of course it helps against the odd-ball Wraith, Pig, or Myers too
---
There is just a little bit too much detail for my comfort in that picture. But this is hilarious and true.
---
Certain gamers will complain about anything to excuse their loss. Just play respectfully and in good spirit and there's no problem when it comes to most people.
---
That is a great idea! I do have the gen already so I just need some LEDs in the lights. [heres a link](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KSquared3D?ref=seller-platform-mcnav) if you wanna check out what I've made!
---
FINALLY
---
It only blocks them if they are already open, if you 99 the door, and wait for the hook to open then you don't have to worry about it.
---
Umm it’s complicated
---
Idk. I main killer and when there is no obsession. It just becomes an easy game. You can triple hook someone without any reprocutions.
---
Just imagine the type of mori you can get with that
---
I think he is just happy to do his job, but he is still very serious 
---
I need an enthusiast with a smile who actually taunts and makes jokes of survivors
---
I know, but I'm still trying to figure out how he could have possibly thought I was a camper. I was runnin make your choice, so I was never even near a hook... lmao I guess he was just salty.
---
where's that guy who's always complaining billy needs a nerf
---
he might have a point
---
The hottest mori ever in the game
---
Not being "hostile" just having a conversation. How you take it is on you. I approach every topic neutral and remains that way throughout unless someone is getting hostile with me.
---
20 might be a fair price, if the lights lit up. But they don't. 10 sounds more than fair for a piece of decorative plastic.
---
was the killer wraith? I think I can see him in this screenshot
---
I got mine a month or two ago good job
---
Undetectable? It doesn't affect Spine Chill if that's what you're saying.
---
I dont have a flashlight and nor do I know how to use one lol
---
Haha this is pretty great especially from ransoms not SWF
---
One too many pallet stuns?
---
I play stealth killers because im sick of the game just being find survivor on gen-&gt;go to loop, and stealth killers at least give some variation. 
---
Also there is counterplay. By just sitting on a gen or healing when you know they are likely running nurses you are giving them exactly what they want.
---
dude your ps4 camera wall mount is the best thing ever
---
You do realize that people that works on bug fixing for gameplay stuff aren’t the same than the marketing stuff?
---
Aim for the nek
---
Hey, is it safe to use these?
---
A couple of months ago I heard that BHVR's system was banning people who changed the game's files
---
r/whosh
---
Right here
---
Myers was "the" stealth killer, but now there are killers that do stealth better than him. Thats the main reason. I still play a lot of Myers because he is a god at snowballing the game, but he really is subpar on stealth when compared to pig and ghostface.
---
Take this message and hold it close to your heart. Seriously. You probably won't get another one.
---
 BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why we recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons.
---
Honestly, I never even hook people two times in a row just to counter DS. Love seeing 2+ survs carrying DS post game. Such a waste of a perk after the nerf.
---
It’s a slur towards black people
---
Hopefully the same thing happens to NOED. They make some stupidly simple tweak like 'cleansing a dull totem gives a notification to all other survivors similar to the hex-totem cleanse'.
---
Then, just like Decisive Strike, Mettle of Man, and every other item on that list, everyone goes, "Wait, why were some people vehemently defending the old way like it was a core aspect of the game?"
---
Fremandabillyhag isn't real, it can't hurt you
---
/\\
---
Thanks *le sigh* and I agree with you on that
---
Don't forget Camaraderie which halts the struggle phase for up to 34 seconds once a survivor is within 16 metres of your hook
---
Second, even forgot I was in queue once and still didn't get one
---
I think what they mean is on PS4 the trophy sections got split after Stranger Things was added. Now when you go into the trophies there is section 1/2 where almost everything is and then section 2/2 which currently has Stranger Things and Curse Legacy trophies.
---
Killer and surv ranks are independent, he could have poured BP into killers to get the perks without ever playing them,  I’ve only played 2 games as killer but have bbq and ruin on pretty much all of them
---
I wouldn’t run a build using anything like that at rank 20 though just seems cruel
---
I'm on ps4 too and I think I've played with you before
---
Nurse yeah, Huntress not as much. I've faced a couple of pretty damn good Huntresses on console. Like, they hit almost every hatchet, makes me think they main her, too. And there's very few that can do that.
---
EDIT: Now that I remember, there might be one or two people on here that are actually console Huntress mains....so yeah. They exist. Only that they are an endangered species...but still...thats the only reason why I dont underestimate her
---
&gt;Can we be real here with the amount of effort that is actually needed?  
---
I wouldnt call that polite. And $10 would be fair. If I was selling it unpainted... I'd like to see you spend time on shit like this and then sell it for pennies. I spend hours each day, *after* my full time job, working on this shop. Not worth the effort for a hundred bucks or so a week. If I spend x amount of my free time filling people's orders, I need to make x amount of dollars. $10 for an hour long paint job. Plus materials, electricity, time... I dont think so. This isnt China.
---
Fungoose. He’s plays all killers but is really good with Bubba. He should have a lot of bubba vids on YT
---
r/PerkByDaylight
---
Oh my. It appears that the hook has summoned another spider!
---
That's never going to happen. Devs have stated that they don't really want killers to speak. Plague's Mori notwithstanding. Otherwise Freddy would be calling people bitches when he hits them.
---
I definitely think it’s better but still could use some tweaks.
---
Really?! 😁😁 We should play again sometime!!!
---
R on PC.
---
Doc laughs histericly at sight of patients going insane
---
Same, I thought this was me for second, but it isn’t cuz I didn’t find the survivor, I wasted about 50 seconds hitting the locker the time that I did it lol
---
I probably ran into you as killer, but I'm always down to play with people. just let me know ☺
---
I still play him, he is amongst my favourites along with Myers, Spirit and sniper Doc
---
Ghostface trumps him because in tier 2-3 you have a terror radius. While gf has zero terror radius while cloaked and can instadown survivors without increasing his terror radius. Mike has to go through tiers 1-3 to be able to imstadown. Also once you stalked someone with myers you cant stalk them again whereas gf gets unlimited stalk. 
---
Also think about speed in tier 1 mm is slow af, where as gf hes not as slow while cloaked.
---
It's not there
---
While it does, it doesn’t buy as nearly as much time as before. Now, they can wait till last second to mend, because that decreases the risk of legion being able to use his frenzy and learn where you are.
---
I'll just let them unhook while I go pressure a gen if I'm in a good mood, but any Survivor that actually puts that in their rule book is a baby even to other babies.
---
What killer do you main? And you can add me on PS4 if you want. Same username w/ 92 on the end
---
Working as intended
---
 In general don't give up at the first hook (even if you just started the trial and got caught in 10 seconds). Remember chasing/hooking/killing is a main component of the game so instead of trying to avoid it completely, take your partial wins. Even just juking the Killer two or three times and prolonging the chase is a huge time gain for your team. Even though it's gonna feel AWESOME when you finally truly disappear in a chase and win it, remember that stalling for time is still a fundamental boon for the team
---
Also be wary of what the Killer knows about your whereabouts. From the perspective of the hook, when you're rescued, don't always go to your first idea of a hiding place or escape route. Whatever is obvious the Killer will check so try to really suss out options while you're hanging
---
Is that a... Warframe?
---
I used to main spirit and wraith, but know I'm just switching between all of them. and alright. I'll add ya
---
I got my first hatch given to me on my 500th hour of playing, was pretty nice I got an achievement as well
---
Doing this just basically decreases the chance of surviving on the hook for next time, so to me thats kinda pointless. Perks seem to take a while to get, and getting a specific one just to extend my playtime sounds a bit off.
---
I dont know, its obviously a 'me' problem. Ive been trying to like this game cause its concept and atmosphere is really well done but the game seems to love taking playtime away from me for the sake of feeling underpowered
---
Wait DBD is on mobile now ?!
---
You still need to mend, you either mend or run around to stop the timer so for 12 seconds that survivor isnt on a gen. Yeah, the reduced timer was a straight up nerf. DW was always shit, only new players would go down to that shit.
---
I guess
---
I know sometimes people think you’re camping when you’re trying to place a trap as hag but you didn’t even try to place a trap.  It’s annoying to try to place a trap near a hooked survivor, step forward, step back, step side, repeat.
---
yeah!
---
bc built in wallhacks, why else? they also run bbq and sometimes nurses to make sure the game is faceroll and remove all skill and fun of hiding and searching. add in the fact that he is fast as fuck and the shitty pallet / vault hitboxes and this game is literally free 4ks.
---
Its just a shame that the people who program the game are too stupid to do their jobs yet the animators are always on top of their game.
---
Nothing. I think it was a group of friends so they just acted like that
---
Unless that last rank reset change changed this, you can derank past 15 from rank reset. If it is changed, then he couldve just not played for a while before that change
---
Yeah there isn't really much you can do in terms of going to a hook, Having people destroy and body block are your best bets
---
Yes on Xbox! That’s happened to me a lot of time too.
---
Yeah he is worse than ghostface or Pig, but for different reasons and he is still good.
---
Ghostface:
---
* Best Stealth in the game
---
* Still can instadown with his stalk
---
* Can T-bag
---
Pig:
---
* Better Stealth than Myers (especially with Whispers)
---
* Traps are inherent slowdown
---
* Ambush lunge can help on loops
---
Myers:
---
* Small terror radius, but is loud and tall
---
* Best snowball game
---
* Gets Looped
---
I dislike the new map too. It's literally impossible yo find survivors if they have more than 1 braincell and are hiding
---
