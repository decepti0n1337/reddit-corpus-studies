As does alot of games another one is Conan Exiles and it's an abortion of a game on the console because of it.
---

---
As I've said it's possible. They chose not to do it as have others and it only breeds problems.
---
---
---
yeah, would make more sense tbh, an extra layer of end game in a totem instead of an insta down that was unexpected and undeserved.
---
I’m baffled that the devs think this is a good idea. You are game devs, isn’t it supposed to be your job to know how your own game works? This is just crazyyyy damn.
---
Even though the streak was broken long ago, I still call "cursed map" when I spawn into the swamp.  I've just died there so. MUCH.   That said, I'll still take it over the meat packing plant any day every day cause that map is practically a death sentence in itself. 
---
One of them has self care, don't know which
---
I do not have much time to play video games. Its good for someone like me who would play this game just for few minutes.. At least I can climb a bit in this game..
---
Seems to happen when you down someone within 1 minute of the match
---
Sometimes gets very annoying especially when everyone leaves as soon as they get downed.
---
Happened to me once soon as I downed them they dc one by one until all of them were gone
---
It's your fault how you behave. You can't control the others, but you can control what you do.
---
Higher rank survivors (5 - 1) are ridiculously efficient. Sometimes slugging is necessary.
---
High tier killers already pressure enough without totems and randoms can't coordinate to destroy them making it an easy carry for bad killers. Unless you are trapper or wraith I don't really see it justified. The very least they could add counter just like for gens.
---
No we just need DBD in VR
---
That's such a me move..
---
But then how can we down survivors t-bagging at the gate? OP is a butt-dance apologist. 
---
I’m all down for another good killer, but I don’t think a killer with this little consequence for messing up their ability, while also having ranged damage, is a good way to go about it. 
---
ah I sense a man of culture 
---
I benefit from the new ranking system.  I won’t have to depip anymore.  Makes it simple.  The one nice change is that low ranks will be difficult to achieve therefore finally separating the players that shouldn’t be anywhere near the red ranks from lobbying with their rank 20 swf.  I feel bad for killers though that aspire to be low ranks.  All a survivor has to do is dc and they black pip no matter the outcome of their game.  Will it increase toxic behavior?  I don’t see how the player base could be more toxic than it already is.  To me I see this whole charade of changes great.  It will be nice to know that all of the grade school peacocking that swf is will be gone.  Player base will undoubtedly drop because the children can’t brag and teabag when they are stuck at rank 16.  If anything it will help eliminate and disband many swf which imo is single handedly the best thing that could happen to this game.  The kids will go back to their peacocking on fortnight.
---
It is of course killers fault.. not survivors right? /s
---
The Needle **S T O P** 
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Below that is Borrowed Time. 
---
PGTW has to have the time limit, the whole point is to get the killer to immediately leave the hook. It’s a camping deterrent.
---
Wait, this is illegal
---
*You just yee'd your last haw.*
---
I love tattoos like this because even if someone doesn't know the game it's still a sick tattoo! 😀
---
then i will dc if i get the obsesion 
---
im skillfull dc warrior™
---
yeah, majority solo play and i always have noed problems... usually 3 or 4 out of 5 games tbh. its concerning when perks get used near all the time, its like they need to be looked at it some way
---
Their logic is his
---
When you beat me because you are better your trash
---
When you kill my teammates your trash because I’m never wrong nor is it ever my own fault
---
10/10, will get nutted on again. 
---
Murderous teens who also like to call people on the phone. If they didn't implement a phone mechanic somehow having Ghostface would be pointless.
---
Meg: "It's Rewind time"
---
It's still an option. 
---
instead of an insta down, it blocks the exits for x seconds for each time you hit someone, if they want to keep the hidden till hit factor of it.
---
That's what I was thinking too :( thanks alot!
---
Did they take anything from your basement chest?
---
The problem is that high ranks is ultra toxic
---
I am still confused about the shrine. I use my currency for level up to get more perks, but are they permanently added to my account or do they go away after a while?
---
Implementing this is far harder than I think you realize. It’s not like cod where the bots search a grid and then shoot at whatever target is visible. The ai would have to be able to prioritize gens, targets, etc (for killers) and be able to track killers heartbeats, choose gens with strategy etc. You’re asking a lot out of an ai, when the same thing could be accomplished by finding a few people who want to practice and hosting a KWF. KWF pretty much has 0 reason to exist otherwise. Js... But I can’t fathom this ever being implemented or having a dev waste time on it.
---
Removed - Rule 1
---
OHHHH i forgot, i will dc if the survivor window juke me, 360 me or outplay me.
---
Basicslly just do it if you want the cosmetics
---
Although I personally hate wraith and would love to get behind this, I disagree. The wraith was pretty terrible back then and yes, he's still not amazing right now but he improved. The speed boost after uncloaking massively helps him catch up to survivors. The windstorm add ons actually make him pretty good and have high mobility, which helps a lot with bbq and nurse's to hook and go find someone else quickly. If you play body blocker wraith, you can get rid of soo many pallets in the map by the end game there will be non left.He's not amazing and he's pretty add on reliant but is he the worst killer? Absolutely not(imo) 
---
Yeah imagine voicing your opinions and concerns about the game on a forum designed for talking about the game. Ridiculous.
---
The perk you're looking for is called Decisive Strike and/or Breakdown.
---
Makes sense, I'd cry if I got screwed over on RNG after prestiging lol
---
I just don't understand why there's no addition effects to sickness on her add ons at all. Almost every killer has debuffs on their power as add ons no matter how "oppressive" they may feel.
---
Hell, Huntress has a COMMON exhausted add on and UNCOMMON hindered add on for landing her basic form of hit. Are you saying it'd really be so horrible to give Plague add ons for slower repair while sick, or exhausted/hindered/blindness etc while sick, even if they were limited to maximum sickness?
---
As it is her add ons are so fucking dull and she barely has any that aren't just on par with most killers' lowest tier shit (in terms of how much it changes how she plays, not necessarily effectiveness.)
---
turtle beach px24
---
I'm rank 8 atm and I feel your pain.. :( it's shitty!
---
Got it with all four survivors at the hatch, I had the key so I was first one in. Trophy popped after the game result screen. Can't see any other way working. 
---
I have literally NO facts to back this up except personal experience, but I think the stun isn't a range thing. I think if the killer is within proximity of the door when you shift+space out of the locker it'll stun the killer even if they backed away from the door while you were mid fast vault animation and that's why the range feels massive.   
---
[https://youtu.be/mIp0VL45bN0?t=475](https://youtu.be/mIp0VL45bN0?t=475) like in this clip, the Plague is MILES away from the locker but still gets stunned, but when tru3 *starts* jumping out of the locker she's directly in front of it trying to bait it out.  
---
~~That's literally just speculation tho so take it with a grain of salt~~
---
Ded ard
---
Find à lobby as killer. This one is the longest. For me it takes 5-10min to accomplish 
---
It's worth it on Claudette because then you can go cloak mode, lol. But other than that, it's not worth it unless you really want to get blood on yourself.
---
100% agree. 
---
Frank’s mixtape is an instant DC. 
---
Nope, that's what the bleedout timer is for. You can only be slugged for 4 minutes, it's really not that long.
---
Being able to kill yourself takes tactical decisions out of the killers hands just because you want to be spiteful and deny them points/pips when you've lost.
---
That ritual has already existed 
---
Don't worry, I'm medikated.
---
Why haddonfield is the worst killer map in a nutshell 
---
Don’t do it until you run out of things to spend your points on
---
There’s actually a lot of fun perks in the game. I love the shits out of Urban Evasion, and paired with Iron Will it’s so great.
---
Recently I’ve been running a super-altruism build with Botany Knowledge, We’ll Make It and Borrowed Time.
---
Oh hey it's Scott! I was watching one of your streams a while ago. Weird seeing you here but howdy! 
---
Why did you post this twice
---
I think such mistakes like running to go save a survivor but whoops, they're on death hook, are meant to be in the game. Survivors shouldn't be able to play 100% optimally all the time (it's a big part of why SWF on voice comms is such a problem).
---
Entity: errrrr sorry Jeff but I'm going to have to punish you for looping that wraith like that!
---
Jeff: manly groaning noises
---
Ojomo was tortured into killing
---
Does the lag ever make you run faster than the killer? I've had a few laggy games in the cornfields where the killer just couldn't catch up with me.
---
Moment of realization... 
---
Burn her out of the phase walk. 
---
Now *that* would be a cool niche counter. 
---
To be fair, it's Frank's mix tape SWS Legion.
---
What child do you know that's 2 meters tall
---
Such a garbage point as well, most tattoos with meaning are from specific moments that have meaning to the person. You just come off like a cunt taking the time to comment that, you gain nothing but downvotes.
---
I guess its probably pinned into her hair in the back, by the part that goes down her neck. Or the sides arent fully detached from her scalp and theres some type of pins there too. Prolly evil spider magic tho idk
---
Oh thanks for letting me know. I just started the game and have been enjoying playing as a pacifist jump scare Doctor who's entire focus is getting Madness 3. I didn't know until a while ago that addons were burned after every match, so I came here to find out if my Doctor perks would disappear too.
---
Meh, idc about upvotes and downvotes
---
Oh nice bro
---
With the implementation of the new pip system I think we will start to see less swf.  They will revert back to their fortnight glory.
---
Nice. This is a great way to add qol. Nice work kid.
---
You are a fucking absolute miserable cunt, lmao. Listen to you moan on about shit my fucking granddad would moan about.
---
It saves a negligible amount of time. Probably saves like 3 seconds if you break every pallet on the map
---
I very clearly asked if I down someone with my Killer's power does that count? This isn't hard to understand at all. 
---
Did you level tapp as your first survivor?
---
Odd decision because his perks are not very good, but I respect it. I would recommend getting claudette, Meg, David, and nea leveled up first.
---
!remindme 48 hours
---
So easy to pip as killer?
---
I’m toxic yet they’re the ones who DC during the match... ironic. 
---
4k 5 gene should be a pip
---
I’m glad you made some things bold. It lets me know this conversation about online ranking in a video game about monsters chasing people in a supernatural world is indeed very serious business.
---
TL;dr: Get the fuck over yourself and accept that not everyone will pip every game. Almost as if it’s meant to be challenging. 
---
Necroing an arguement.. wow new low 
---
4k 5 gen a pip?? That's a double.
---
I don’t know, my friend and I both gotten 4ks without dc with 5 gens and did not pip.
---
No. Just grind through the Level 50 blood webs until you get what you need. Unless you really want the cosmetic.
---
just know that youre gonna die and lose a lot, just keep on playing, youll learn the more you play
---
Here's how I think these perks should be buffed, let me know if any of them are op and I'll adjust accordingly:
---
Monstrous shrine:
---
Numbers should be buffed, should spawn black hooks around the map that give the effect and should give 100% bloodpoints in the sacrifice category.
---
Unrelenting:
---
Your idea
---
Fire up:
---
Numbers need to be buffed
---
Predator:
---
Needs to have digital footsteps. Idk if you played cod bo3 but there's a perk called tracker that puts a digital orange footstep that glows when an enemy walks. Should be like that or just return it to how it was before
---
Play with your food:
---
Not sure how exactly should it be buffed but a good band aid fix imo is you lose a token after 2 successful hits rather than an offensive action.
---
Dying light:
---
Hooking every survivor perhaps should give its effects. Would work perfectly with bbq. Numbers would perhaps need to be lowered though
---
Third seal:
---
Hooks should not show a bubble. Totems will not show if its a hex or not. Actions should not show how much progress is done like Gens or healing(maybe that's too op idk)
---
Overcharge:
---
I always wanted an overcharge buff. Should give the survivor 3 instant skill checks that regress by 6% each if failed and are harder skill checks than the current one since that one is easy to hit. Should also allow you to kick already regressing gens to overcharge it
---
Beast of prey:
---
Either: 1.Red stain should immediately dissappear in a chase or 2. bloodlust should appear much quicker
---
Pop goes the weasel:
---
Generator should regress by 30%, should allow you to kick already regressing gens and should last 45-1 minute instead of 30 seconds.
---
Survivors:
---
Boil over:
---
Hook block aura should be increased
---
Deja vu:
---
Diversion:
---
Should be 25 seconds. 45 is too much
---
Left behind:
---
Should give you a bonus to repairing gens per hooked survivors. Idk what number should it be though
---
No mither and no one left behind:
---
Your ideas are perfect
---
Slippery meat is pointless because of deliverance
---
Q&amp;Q will be replacing my U.E. next patch. Super sneeky sprinty.
---
I run empathy, stake out, self care, and small game on my Claudette. I feel it gives me the best balance of perks to be useful in any situation. Empathy lets me track chases and heal people, stake out rewards me when I'm hiding from the killer. Self care is obvious. Small game lets me get all the totems as well as helping out with traps sometimes. I'm much better at hiding than looping, so I plan to never be seen.
---
I also enjoy a build with urban evasion, quick and quiet, balanced landing, and iron will.
---
Decisive was bad not only cause it wasted time, it could potentially prolong an already long chase into one or two gens more, and robbed the killer of an earned hook. Survivors aren't owed anything, even at the end of the game. The game isn't over just because the fifth gen is done.
---
What exactly are you having trouble with? are you going down really early, are you having trouble running away from the killer? whats the issue?
---
Ah yes the DC 2.0
---
Lmao what?
---
Add Fire Up onto that.
---
Look at the pallet. Now back to me. Now back to the pallet. The pallet is now gone.
---
It's not about everybody agreeing, it's about not fucking the poor 20 ranked killer
---
No matter how good you get, you'll win some and you'll lose some. Playing killer is definitely more stressful because you've got to multi-task more than survivors, but you get more points for it though. You'll find what killer, or killers, suit you. Good luck.
---
If anything, I’m showcasing the frequency in which players DC during games for almost no reason at all. It’s a common occurrence that ruins every game it happens in. Also, in the majority of those clips it’s the survivor that had done something earlier in the match to deserve my head shake... which is a sad reason to DC regardless
---
Just use surveillance 
---
Don't DC if it's legion, at least suicide on hook 1 time
---
People bitching that NOED and Ruin and not letting people get the hatch is toxic isn't contributing to anything, it's people not realizing what kind of game they are playing.
---
Same with people bitching about DS and especially t-bagging when it's used 99% of the time as a form of emote that doesn't take 5 seconds to play out. 
---
I'd love some discussion where one side isn't claiming unfairness and toxicity from the other. But almost none of these threads are doing that. 
---
Get a job and buy a pc then, i can solo q at 6am and get a full lobby of other rank 1s in 10 seconds.
---
Unexpected TF2 reference
---
I've scrolled past this multiple times just thinking it was a joke about the hag eating people and then I realised the pun...
---
Prove Thyself and Leader do not give bonuses to the same thing anymore. PTS is for gens while Leader does everything else.
---
Just dont succumb to toxic strategies. Dont camp, dont be a dick survivor. The best survivors dont waste time at the gate, just get the hell out.
---
The fun killers to play against are always patrolling and not area camping or being asses.
---
Just focus on getting better in chases, learn how to cut off survivors. The "Easy" killers are easy to learn so you can focus on gameplay. Gonna be honest, just dont play doc, because he a crutch killer, almost always a 3k or 4k.
---
Well as survivor I’m having trouble running away and as killer I’m having trouble with losing the survivor from a chase to easily
---
Nice d strikes
---
its not really a hostage situation if its on a timer
---
as much as the 3 minutes of waiting may be  annoying, slugging is a very important mechanic in this game
---
not to mention survivors also have ways to actually hold the game hostage
---
Quite the opposite, actually. 
---
If it was Dwight it would be a floating locker that sucks you in.
---
Plenty of Jeff's love to go around &lt;3
---
fun and situational is better than busted with sprint burst combo
---
The Children of the Corn remake looks great.
---
What are you using to connect the controller and your phone ?
---
so its ok to fuck over 19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 
---
until these same people say hey fix your shit behvr and we go around and around again 
---
Nice
---
I read people commenting on your post and I think most of them don't realize that the true potential in this combo is in lockers near generators. You do generator, you hear the heartbeat, you go into the locker and then you sprint away for free gaining so much distance on the killer that it is debatable if you're still worth chasing at all. Generators with lockers nearny would be ridiculously safe 
---
Well, I've been playing since May, when the game got released, played in multiple tournaments instead of just hosted them. Played both sides, and watched both sides, and I say the exact opposite. Jason is way better than counselors, but counselors are Noob stompers. That's why they kept nerfing him, because counselors would beat the crap out of Noob Jason's who didn't know heo to block. It really is that simple, the block is what makes him op. Without the block, is agree he'd be weak, but being able to stop every attack and still hit makes him Incredibly stronger. 
---
Not fun if you never get to use it 
---
Suggestion: random perks for additional bp
---
Opinion:
---
&gt; holding m1 and watching the bar fill up is boring as shit and nobody likes it
---
Fact:
---
&gt; gens let you escape
---
Doing gens and cleasing can be both boring and the survivors' main objective at the same time. If you dont want people complaining about totem cleansing then make it more interesting, rewarding and actually fun. Gens suffer from the same problem as totems except gens actually give you bloodpoints and you have a higher chance of getting into a chase around a generator.
---
Soft but thanks for the free BP I guess...
---
Killer gonna fall?  
---
Killer gonna lose the chase?  
---
Maybe swing and whiff?
---
Ms Jane I don't feel so good
---
I gave up responding
---
It’s has tbh, but I don’t like it because I feel like it makes the game unfair to the killer.
---
A part of me thought that making such a suggestion could, if implemented, lead to fewer mistakes by solo survivors and make it more difficult on killers than it already is. But when I thought about it - it could also lead to more block attempts and more survivors hovering around you when they know a teammate is on death hook. But with the newest Plague perk in the mix, this also could lead to more quick-hits and more downs as well for killers. So it could end up getting killers more kills on the flip side if they don't have to go too far to find survivors. It all depends on the strategy of the risk taker. 
---
Sure, wiser survivors would see the death hook icon and stay away, but there is always the chance that someone wants to be the hero for the extra points and play with fire.
---
I forgot to mention what this could do for hatch play. 
---
Scenerio: As a killer you see two people around you and hit one only to see that they are on death hook and the other isn't. All we can currently do to get a four-man is slug one of them and go search for the other. Slugging is boring for both sides, and with the new ranking system you want to get as many hooks as possible as killer. If my idea is implemented you'd now have the choice of, upon hitting one of them and seeing that they are on death hook, immediately go after the other so that if you hook him/her you can have some time to go after the other before the hatch comes into play. So this could also help killers in the end game as well a little.
---
I have an entirely different "end game" suggestion I'll be making the coming days for the devs which would completely eliminate the hatch. But for now anything that could help killers avoid giving free escapes and risking their ranks I'm ok with it.
---
So you don't wanna do totems because they're not fun, but want to nerf NOED because you don't wanna do totems. That's not NOED's problem.
---
Probably cause he’s the only male killer that’s not all mutilated or deformed. Just a jacked dude with a thing for voyeurism.  
---
Hook yourself twice in one session
---
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077NBZHXT/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_2ZgHCb2BNTDSZ
---
But we're not refering to slugging during the match. It's when the killer chooses to waste everybodys' time or loses track of his slugs when everyone is downed and he's looking for them to hook them.
---
Instead of hoping for them to eventually find you/having to wait it out because they are being a dick, you could choose to kill yourself to skip the waiting. They get points, you get to skip the bleedout stage.
---
I'm not trying to pain the killers as the only ones holding the game hostage, I'm explaining the idea behind the "kill yourself" button to skip waiting.
---
You’re 100% right, I’m just thinking of builds based towards using it. Pretty solid meme potential with OoO.
---
It can blind her in phase, I saw a video on it. 
---
lol after swinging at me and teleporting through me, he caught me... 
---
^
---
I mean... I wouldnt mind log-in rewards... give me a reason to log in every day and hard counter legion with my bomb dc powers. Works every time.
---
Practice, practice, practice.
---
Not sure, but it seems to be like a cone radius ? I've seen killers quite far away from the locker get stunned, but not when standing just in front but directly to the right or left of the locker. 
---
Definitely agree that his power is fine. I think Frank's could be looked at and the moonwalking too but other killers have strong add ons that can end chases just as quickly so idk what makes his any different. 
---
Legion can slow the game down really well if he uses his power the way it was intended by hitting multiple players because they have to go mend and heal (if they want) so you can have multiple players out of the game and not doing gens.
---
 Discordance really plays into his game too so players don't want to work together on gens so you have ppl spread out which slows things down some too and then add some other perks on top of it and it can make it tough for survivors to get momentum because they have to mend and heal constantly. 
---
In the end, Prestige isn't really worth it. It's nice for your main character to have all three of their bloody clothing, but overall it's not really worth it.
---
[removed]
---
Right now I have a lot of perk options that I have in mind for a survivor build, but I think my main build is this: Self Care, Adrenaline, Lithe, and Urban Evasion
---
Self Care because I need it to keep myself at full health and take more hits (unless it's a killer with an insta down).
---
Adrenaline so if I get chased until the end of the game it can activate and both heal me and give me a boost of speed to get away from the killer, also if I'm injured and there's 1 or 2 gens left to do, it makes it so that I don't have to waste time to heal myself and can just do the last gen or last gens.
---
Lithe is my personal choice for the exhaustion perk in my build, I like being able to vault a window in chase and get a burst of speed away from the killer and the killer would either have to walk around the window or vault it at the slower pace than survivors vault windows. I don't like using Dead Hard or Sprint Burst because once the killer finds out you have Dead Hard they'll expect you to use it and then just down you and I just don't find Sprint Burst fun to use and I feel like it doesn't cover as much ground as Lithe does.
---
Urban Evasion is my personal choice for a stealth perk, since my main survivor is Adam and I wear his dark brown trench coat I like to play more stealthy and Urban Evasion giving me the faster crouching speed has helped me in so many situations when hiding from the killer. It's also very nice combined with Lithe so when you vault a window and get that speed boost, you can just urban evade away in another direction, it's especially good against Spirit who I haaaaaate facing. Finally, It can also be used to sometimes troll the killer, I remember one time I messed with a Trapper so hard by watching him place traps everywhere and then I went in to disarm them and urban evaded away before he could even know what happened. I also remember one time I was being chased by a Doctor on the Yamaoka Estate map and he swung at me but I 360ed him and hid in some tall grass that I 360ed him through and he thought I ran back the other direction and went to the killer shack, and then I just slowly urbanly evaded away (but then screamed and he found me again ;-;). But yea, I love using this perk in my builds, it's helped me in these two situations and many more and helps me make crafty plays against the killer.
---
Other perks I enjoy using are as followed:
---
Deliverance: So that when I unhook a team mate and get the "safe hook rescue" bloodpoints, I'll be able to unhook myself on my first hook and keep myself going in the game and not be sitting on a rusty meat hook bored and just waiting for the entity to consume me.
---
Borrowed Time: To prevent the killer from tunneling by giving the unhooked survivor an extra hit and hopefully an advantage to get away, also works good combined with Deliverance.
---
Balanced Landing: Sometimes I use this instead of Lithe and unlike Sprint Burst and Dead Hard, it can help cover a good amount of ground against the killer by simply jumping off of something like a hill or the top of a building or house so that you can get to another looping spot and buy your team mates a little more time to do gens.
---
Alert: So when the killer breaks a pallet or kicks a generator, I can see his/her aura for 5 seconds and know where he/she is and know if I'm in any danger or not, I love the information this perk gives.
---
Bond or Aftercare: So that I can see where my team mates are and know and know if I can help them with anything or know if I'm in danger, these perks are also a good substitute for Self Care so you can go to a team mate to get healed up instead of waiting 30 seconds by yourself to do it. Personally I would choose Aftercare over Bond because the range of a survivor I've healed, unhooked, been healed by, or been unhooked by is seen to me within an infinite range and Bond on the other hand is only 36 meters, but I do like both of these perks, definitely good for giving you information on where my team mates are and how I can help them or how they can help me if not being (if not being chased by the killer of course).
---
Distortion: So I can counter the killer's aura reading perks like BBQ + Chili or Nurse's Calling and carry on with the repairs or heals that I am applying, however if I'm against a Freddy who can simply get me out of his terror radius in dream world then that's a huge ooof because it counters Distortion completely by not revealing your aura to Freddy and wasting all three tokens, it can also be easily countered by a Doctor with Restraint addons who can just simply shock me and reveal my aura to him. But other than that, this perk is very useful for keeping yourself safe and hidden from the killer's aura reading perks.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
good, she actually seems balanced.
---
Ffs, buff Freddy already.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I didn't "punish" them or try to get anyone to DC. Them DCing means we BOTH depip so I did them a solid, let them do gens and safety pipped by chase/hooking them. We both don't suffer for their bad teamates. But call it what you want idc.
---
It can do that, yes, but I am referring to the burn that can happen to a Wraith and Nurse. 
---
I've suggested bots before. I've also suggested a mode that doesn't effect your rank for the sake of BP and practice.
---
But both got buried because they only got 5 or less upvotes because no one like to think outside the box.
---
Survivor queue times on PS4
---
It's not NOED's problem. That's all on the totems. By the same token, TOTH is unfun because it uses a similar mechanic.
---
Agreed, I know complaint culture is rampant so this will prob get some hate but yeah man you right lol my homies swear he trash until they run into someone who knows how to play him.

Entity not angry, just disappointed
---
You could put it on a maximum timer. 
---
The door is locked till you clense the totem or x amount of time passes.
---
Set the timer to something reasonable and make it an alternative to remember me.
---
How? Wraith has no problem with chases. Cloak, catch up, uncloack, speed boost, free hit or pallet drop. Somehow missed? Cloak, catch up, uncloack, free hit or pallet drop. Not very hard. 
---
&gt;Like wow. You get slower gen progress in the sleep world, it's not like a survivor running bond couldn't just find the nearest awake survivor to wake them up.
---
So now you’re assuming worst case scenario for freddy lmao. When you look at a character in a clearly biased view no wonder they look bad. 
---
When you tunnel one person as freddy and only have one person in the dream world at a time yeah no wonder he’s bad. When you spread the love and get multiple people into dream state he slows the game down and can snowball really well. 
---
I’d say wraith is better purely because of his add on rework but Freddy isnt “dumpster garbage tier” like everyone says. He seems fine to me.
---
i do the same thing 
---
\#3...  
---
*Coughs in Nurse.*
---
In addition to both those things she has sets of brown and dark grey clothes in the store that on certain maps it’s almost impossible to see without either your brightness turned up or practically walking into them.
---
I'm just joking that you double posted
---
Holding m1 and watching a progress bar fill is boring, bad. They didn't imply that doing the same thing on a gen is good as in fun.
---
Not interacting with the killer is the boring part of the survivor gameplay.
---
But he doesn't have to wait to hit someone, he can straight up attack you without the long dreamworld transition, and what do you mean lore wise? He's been dragged from the dream world multiple times.
---
* Monstrous Shrine: Make it effect all hooks, but reduce/rework the numbers.
---
* Fire Up: This really just needs to activate at the first gen. The numbers are fine.
---
* Play With Your Food: Only loose tokens when you successfully hit someone with an attack or power that does damage. Hitting your Obsession and letting them escape gives you tokens.
---
* Dying Light: Each time your Obsession is hit, all Survivors gain a reduced action speed penalty up to 20% max. For each stack, your Obsession gets 20% increased Altruistic action speed.
---
* Predator: The auras of scratch marks within 8 meters are revealed to you for 4 seconds. (Maybe)
---
* Pop Goes the Weasel: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9wjdcn/rework_for_pop_goes_the_weasel/ I will accept no other alternate.
---
I hated the ranking system since emblems came out. I’m forced to play a certain way to pip. There have been a few times playing survivor where I’ve been chased for  5 gens and escaped to a black pip. Like, what am I supposed to do? Get caught on purpose for a possible chance to get points in a different category?
---
You’re definitely not if you think survivors are strong rn lmao
---
It also doesn't help that in recent patches they keep changing totem spawns so the less obvious totems are really hard to find especially as a solo survivor where your looking for totems that may or may not be broken since there is no way of knowing on the survivor side how many totems are left
---
Oh must have been because of my bad internet. Posted twice. Also, /s would've helped didn't know if you were joking or not. 
---
I don't think he's horrible, but as he stands currently, he's either the second weakest or the weakest killer. He can definitely get some good games, but he's incredibly easy to bully, especially without add-ons.
---
!remind me 48 hours 
---
Ah, the wild rank 1 killer who got there by being mediocre and playing 30 games a day in their natural habitat: using stupid ass builds that make no sense 
---
!remindme 48 hours 
---
Plus I've seen several posts where totems that are out in the open... are still out in the open. GG, devs.
---
Other killers, excluding nurse (and sometimes spirit), still have to worry about windows and pallets regardless of addons. Iri head hatchets is another topic but still. 
---
That’s what makes Legion unfun. You just don’t juke him. You run until enough time has passed that you’re on the ground. 
---
who face camps as the clown? i mean at end game yeah i can see it but any other time?
---
Touch a fellow Survivor long enough to fail a heal check and alert the Killer.
---
I loved him before I knew he was in DBD. He's just cool, no special reason why.
---
Why on Earth would Freddy have a perk that allows survivors to drag him from the dreamworld? He's a god in the dreamworld, he wouldn't want to be dragged from there for anything. Plus, he doesn't have his aura-reading or his 50% dreamworld speed debuff. Being able to act like any other killer but without a power is a straight up nerf no matter which way you look at it.
---
I sometimes join as the fourth person and the killer immediately dc's
---
Every killer takes skill if you play them sub optimally. The problem is no one does that everyone just tunnels with legion and his chase is unwinnable so you just go down on a timer once he sees you unless the killer literally bought the game 20 mins ago 
---
What is a MMR system? 
---
So that's how King Crimson works.
---
Clown
---
Jesus, your a toxic nutbag you know that? The OP is just criticizing a poorly thought-out system that fails to address the problem with the game's ranking system. They are not saying you should PIP everygame, you fucking nitwit.
---
You might as well put blood warden on a hex which tbh it would probably work better that way
---
An Ebony with Tombstone? What lunacy is this?
---
Poor Tapp. Dude was not well mentally even before he got swallowed by the entity
---
If he was fun to play how come I always play against legions, clowns and spirits?
---
10 bloodpoints for each daily 
---
It offers a speed boost and a considerably smaller terror radius, that paired with other perks would be deadly.  
---
Change "Pick Up Item/Interaction" or "Actions". They are by default the same button, which isn't good.
---
Actions are vaulting, entering lockers, pulling pallets, ETC. Interactions are almost anything with a progress bar, healing , working gens, etc. They shouldn't all be the same button.
---
I changed "Pick Up Item/Interactions" to RT/R1, and then "Use Item" to Y/Triangle. This keeps everything different buttons.
---
Chasing isn't the only aspect in DBD that you can use to outplay the killer
---
Ooof. It’s my fav map
---
🤣🤣
---
Oh shit! The killer is camping mine :(
---
Disagree with seven. Orienting with these effects is difficult, but it is quite fun not to mess this up. It’s like throwing pallets at Clown with blurried vision.
---
r/woooosh
---
MatchMaking Ranking. Its what pretty much every modern multiplayer game does. Dota, Overwatch, fighting games, etc. Its also known as SR.
---
You do placement matches and get estimated a "skill ranking", and the system then uses that skill ranking to match you with people of similar skill. SRs are usually divided into brackets or tiers, say, 1000-1500 would be a tier of people close in skill ranking. Winning makes SR go up, losing makes SR go down.
---
It was originally devised as a system to rank chess players, and as such it has problems when it is used for team games and not 1v1, but still it is the best we have and serves other games well.
---
Still doesn't fix other issues or address my other points.
---
Tru3talent’s view on NOED is: “It allows a killer to not really know how to play the game and still do well”.
---
It’s a crutch, plain and simple.
---
I’ll admit it’s easy to deal with, jUsT cLeAnSe ToTEmZ. I personally do cleanse totems, but can’t always find all of them. I’ll cleanse 3 or 4 and still get one-shotted at the end. It doesn’t happen all that often, so I don’t feel the need to cry about it. But it’s definitely a stupid perk.
---
I’ve seen some of the shittiest killers clean house at the end because the survivors feel bad and wanna try for the save, or find the totem after it’s too late.
---
The bottom line is that good killers don’t need it.
---
And you're delusional to think they aren't lol.
---
You can still stun legion with pallets and if he stops to bait the pallet that buys you a second and wastes time on his frenzy. The windows never bothered me it just is his thing and if you have lithe it you can get some distance on him plus if he hits you he loses his frenzy if you are already hit which gives you a small window to lose them.
---
If anything I would be ok with changing the mend timer so you don't go down as quick but he is good at the chase in frenzy, it's ok for killers to be different imo
---
Slugging isn’t the only viable strategy on any killer
---

---
I ragequit several times because I was pissed off by wasted perks. I play Ace, I state in a lobby that I can get better items, I teabag and point them to give me the chest but they ignore it all. 
---
Okay. Thanks! Im not really a multiplayer game player so never heard of it.
---
What happened to our 100k dailies?
---
Nurse?
---
It would just save time, I guess. 
---
\*Press random button\*:Territorial imperative, lightborn, Coulrophobia and unrelenting.  
---

---
This is gold.
---
Pretty big closet.
---
As for tunneling - it's a risk for sure. But that's in part why I suggested that this be something survivors see as well to have the playing field leveled in that aspect.  Survivors interfering/taking a hit for a survivor who is on death hook is both risk and reward and could lead to more bold play styles. While information is power, as we know altruism could also kill.
---
SWFs have had the advantage of being able to know who is on death hook for years. I think a change like this is the least that could happen for solos. Tbh, I would have thought this was the direction the devs were going anyways when they coded in entity claws which wiggled whenever the obsession was being chased. This is another step in that direction to help solos while also helping killers a lot. 
---
Tunneling is a concern yes, but with the new DS I think killers would have it in the back of their minds that it's not always a good idea to do so.
---
Probably a greenscreen
---
glad I could help.
---
5 hours have passed
---
Achievement?
---
I'LL MAKE YOU EAT THOSE WORDS! ...-y fake!
---
Well yeah, Jason has the upper hand in combat. It's not wise to go super aggro against a good/decent Jason because he has the upper hand in combat at all times. Is that the meta nowadays? Because it honestly shouldn't be. 
---
The combat isn't or has never been even remotely counselor-sided. 
---
And he plays in the tournaments too, dummy. I didn't think I needed to state that. 
---
And btw, the downvoted button isnt a "disagree" button. 
---
ゴゴゴゴ
---
So good for Claudetting on I love it to, not sure why people hate it so much.
---
I mean sure its more work but it does seem strange their isn't just some form of a second floor vault for killer where they more so vault through the window instead of stepping through.
---
"I'm a genius!"
---
"*oh no*"
---
I do believe you but I think the 2 jumped in their rank 16 friends lobby and joined you
---
Blood warden can be played around by 99%-ing the gate and waiting till the guy gets hook, that way it's rendered completely useless. 
---
Yeah, I think this would work better.
---
So, I left the warehouse where I work to get home. 
---
But because a coworker had neglected an important process, I turned back. 
---
I am now stuck in dead traffic for about 20 minutes because of a major accident about 60m ahead of me 
---
:(
---
That one is tricking ya. It takes an eternity for a game to start in the PTB!
---
Man I can't wait to use this on other killers!
---
I ran into a few laggy survivors who had mini sprint bursts because of their lag.
---
Hitting the obsession causes the speed boost effect and a lowered terror radius, the sleep mechanic is unique to freddy.
---
I mean...base power vs base power, Huntress is better.
---
However, Huntress's Toxin add-on is nothing compared to Solvent Jug.
---
Here's a thought: Fuck rank. It's utterly useless. 
---
No, if there is no situation where you can make it to the saviour there needs to be a penalty to the team or else the game becomes rediculasly Harder, that’s why borrowed time is so great, use it👍
---
I personally don't care about ranking, to me this is just an invitation to have a variety instead of nurse after nurse and decisive after decisive. 
---
If it were up to me I'd either get rid of it or turn it into an ELO system where it's your average BPs or emblems per game.
---
Full Jeff -Distortion, Unbreakable, Aftercare-  with We'll Make it. His perks tell you so much about the match. Distortion for the reasons you mention. Unbreakable shows me the best path to get away after being unhooked. Aftercare is just godlike for knowing what's going on across the map. I use my Distortion stacks to find situations to finish up key gens or be unaccounted for so I can get the unhook. Heal em' up real quick and scoot off to the next gen. It's not the best build, but I enjoy the hell out of it from a strategy perspective.

I did this once and got hatemail from the killer
---
Then he camped me 😄🔫
---
I just want the achievement for it and then to never go back myself 
---
He should get rid of monitor n abuse and brutal then replace it with bbq and enduring pretty shitty perk build
---
Thx for the info fam never knew that (I knew about wraith but not about the blinks)
---
Google xbox clips, type in gamertag, download videos. 
---
Doesnt matter, the point is if they ever want to use it, they have to leave the hook. I’m just telling you what the purpose of the perk design is for...the timer isn’t going anywhere.
---
I mean it's the start of the song.
---
I get it, shitpost, but is that how most people signal it? I use jumping jacks to signal it's safe.
---
I don't really care for my rank, should I still care about the changes? I feel like it will affect my games.
---
Wait what?  I thought swamp was survivor favored.
---
I've thought this several times recently when my game decided to crash on the loading screen.  I'm so new to it all that I don't even know what they were, but they were bright colors and looked nice and were totally wasted when my game client decided to crap itself.
---
An easy fix would be to "burn" the offerings, but just kinda hold onto them until the actual game's been going for a half a minute or so before permanently removing them.  Might not even need that long, a handful of seconds might do it—just long enough to ensure that things have actually gotten underway properly.
---
It seemed like all the other players were moving around just fine. It’s all good though, sometimes these things happen! Just gotta accept that’s how life is on console haha
---
This is really impressive :) 
---
The chase is the exciting part of the game, why would you want to make the game more hide and seek focused?
---
especially with a certain character like I havent touched laurie so using one of her 3 perks living and opening a gate is hard
---
Let her suck your bing bong and get the hook you deserve. A fair trade
---

---
Its still a very good record but him having someone to help him does take away some of the flare. 
---
Don’t have them at the exit gate lol.
---
I'm not sure why anyone would play survivor if they don't find holding m1 enjoyable, considering that's what you do 70% of matches.
---
If shes pretty than I'm a fucking model 
---
It's actually one of the better maps for survivors against nurse. The size of the map means she has great map control, but the teleporting between floors can be wonky at times as well as allow for some mind gaming.
---
I mean, a good nurse means you're screwed as a survivor anyways, but that map can be used to your advantage somewhat.
---
Considering totems have set spawn locations, and if you have at least a few hundred hours on survivor you should know where every spawn is on each map? It really doesn't take long to cleanse them at all. I can do 3-4 totems on my own in just around a minute on most maps.
---
Not aware of it, care to share a link?
---
Thank you for complimenting my wife!
---
Aww thank you:)
---
...Jane being thicc is her only distinguishing feature as a Survivor (Not including perks.) Her design is boring. She just looks like some random lady who walked out of the office and got taken by the entity. At least Jeff's design was a bit more interesting and pulls through some of his personality. And his story actually ties into his paired killer, he's just more interesting overall compared to Jane. Making her underwhelming to me compared to Jeff.
---
Granted, I still wish we got Susie over Jeff last chapter, but it's still better then Jane imo...
---
This is giving me vibes of when people who make up explanations for things that are wrong to try and look smarter than everyone else but then they end up making themselves look like an idiot 
---
It might mean more people of a greater skill level in lower ranks. It's hard to predict anything except that the PTB system doesn't fix what's wrong with the current system. Hopefully things won't be worse, but the new system is definitely not making it better
---

TydeTyme calls Hag D tier on a video from three months ago = DEGENERATES LIKE YOU BELONG ON THE CROSS.
---
You’re going to get beat down a lot early on. Just take every match as a learning experience. Oh and a tip the game doesn’t give you, if you hold your attack button you do a lunge attack. 
---
we gathered all 4 survivors at the hatch and jumped in right after each other, less than a month ago
---
I mean like KISS? I don’t see how wearing freaking awesome clothes makes you incapable of being Bob Ross.

---

---
Nice, legit have you as a friend on PSN. Small world lmao.
---
Chases are fun, looping is not and in its current form one cant go without the other because there has been nothing that encourages a Out for a chase. 'Chases' happen for a few seconds until the survivor is downed, or until the survivor finds a window loop or pallet loop, then the 'chase' is over, it becomes musical chairs instead.
---
The idea behind Pallet and Hide would be that there is a method to end the chases, a method that relies on the survivor playing smart with the pallet drop and then being able to hide or get away based on that. Having pallet drops be focused more on being potential chase enders, instead of chase extenders. So there is a chase, your running from the killer, vaulting windows and other stuff desperately trying to find a good situations to drop a pallet your near, a situation that lets you then hide and lose the killer either because the pallet blocks them or they are forced to break the pallet. Pretty much shifting the purpose of a pallet drop.
---
Window vaults/Downed pallets = Stalling or extending the chase.
---
Upright Pallets = Chase breakers, with ability to hide or get away from the killer provided the survivor plays smart, forcing the killers hand to search for you or to then disengage at that point.
---
TL:DR Chases are fun, Looping is not.
---
1) you have NOED, so your post is invalid
---
2) While I disagree with Tyde’s placement of Hag on his tier list, this proves nothing. You can 4K with anyone and you can make people DC with every killer. 
---
Wonder why you got downvoted for being wrong.
---
I had such a face camping clown earlier he would hook my teammate and not go away he would leave for 1 second and come right back we had to save put teammate by everyone rushing to help it was so annoying 
---
The survivors are supposed to be average Joe schmos. They're meant to be like us, somebody who you wouldn't blink an eye at if they were behind you in the line at the grocery store or something. 
---
Noice
---
I totally agree. The current ranking system is complete garbage and throws most team cohesion out the window.
---
Imagine running Sprint Burst over Dead Hard like 99% of the shit Claudettes you see at Rank 1 who get downed in a chase in 5 seconds flat 
---
Is that HUD from a Monto game? I recognise the names on the right. Maybe a Tru3ta1ent one? 
---
I mean, them being from another time period doesn't make them any more or less identifiable/empathetic... Perhaps it's just me, but I would see that using people from other time periods would just mean more diverse and interesting stories and designs. If anything I would think they would use that for more appeal.
---
It's a shame we're gonna be stuck with more modern day survivors though.
---
Decisive Strike ans most killers will ignore you ;D
---
you've broken down my argument in one sentence. thank you
---
Well not exactly, or at least not in the sense that you’re saying. If you watch most game devs play their game, they’re not exactly the best. If you watch the DBD devs that stream DBD you’ll see that they would legitimately get rolled on at rank 1. Game devs spend so much time actually making the game that at the end of the day, they don’t spend time playing it at the level their players who spend thousands of hours playing do. It’s the reason a killer like legion was able to be released. So these guys quite literally don’t know what it’s like to be at rank one and just don’t realize how much of a problem the PTB rank system is. 
---
*than crouch speed 
---
I agree, but that's they're logic behind it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I legit really like this idea. I see no harm with that at all.
---
We still arent even allowed to play private games with killers we dont own. i have to spend 9k shards or pay money just to properly understand how a killer works and gather information that neither the game nor wiki will tell you. Also kill your friends was bugged for ages (if it isnt still) and things that worked in there didn't work in actual games, so that may happen to this offline mode. And knowing them, they'd charge money for it, and it wouldnt work, just like the rest of the game. 
---
Yeah, it is a good idea and it would be nice, but this is dead by daylight. There is no "easy to implement" for them.
---
Like these guys have said, watch streamers and practice practice practice. Get familiar with the killers and perks.
---
A few general tips:
---
Survivor
---
-Run precise routes, every inch counts.
---
-Keep your camera moving, know where you’re going and where the killer is.
---
-Learn to loop pallets and windows
---
-Learn to be stealthy, looping won’t always save you against good killers
---
-Know when the killer is busy. If your teammate just got injured, the killer is likely to chase them down.
---
Killer
---
-Start with someone simple. Michael Myers has a power that’s easy to use but very effective.
---
-Figure out which perks compliment your killer.
---
-Never forget to protect your generators, especially the 3 that are close together.
---
-Don’t commit to every chase, even just injuring them helps. Injured survivors are way less confident and easy to hear.
---
Can I download that though?
---
You underestimate how terrible that killer POV can be, you probably didn’t even register on the screen tbh xD
---
Susie as in Legion Susie? Because if so I honestly think Joey looks better. 
---
Also Jane’s default outfit looks boring as all hell. It really does look like she was just grabbed out of an office. Who knows, maybe she has some amazing cosmetics. 
---
Yeah still rendering.. usually takes 2 secs per frame but for some reason this killer is taking around avg of 12 secs perframe.. so im still rendering it.. probably becasue iused a rotating light source for this not sure
---
She says something like, “take heed, you’ll drink from hundred fountains.”
---
Wouldn’t the bottom be the top just worded differently?

I'm on Android. Are they free or do they cost money?
---
I only do it if a toxic survivor finally gets downed and I’m willing to let the rest go. The constant laughing as I slash at them just really speaks to me somehow on a microscopic level. 🤡 Fuck me if that makes me a bad killer, shouldn’t have tbagged and blinded me. Hope those bold points were worth it.
---
Honestly if they made the tiles on coldwing not see-through and added some doorways to stupidly strong structures like ironworks window or grim pantry house of fun then they would fix all of the problems most killers have with the maps. (Minus the fact that all maps except macmilian and autohaven are pretty bad for huntress).
---
After fixing those problematic structures the devs could then remove bloodlust and make chases fully skill based.
---
They're free, at least when I got them, good luck on your meme making

Thanks again, and sorry for the inconvenience.

How do I upvote twice?
---
It's all cool 
---
I'm sure you can find it somewhere or buy it. Maybe youtube to mp3.
---
This is one of the few “suggestions” ever made on here that I can get behind 100%
---
Hell, we could make new offerings that mask the color to the default white for the killer too and vice versa.
---
I've been wondering this. As a fairly newbie player I've noticed that my 4k no gen games I get like NOTHING. Barely any chases, hook a person twice if I'm lucky, kick a few gens, maybe a pallet gets touched. In other competitive games that would be like 5 MMR as you said. As it should be no?
---
In a match if I'm having fun and really getting into it it's close and I feel like I'm getting to think and my opponents get to think. Those are two pip games generally. I think people focus too hard on gaming the system. Just play, have fun, keep some of the stats in mind, and go from there.
---
LOL you think I'm saying Urban is OP? HAHAHAHHAHAHA. Get real. It's for immersed survivors who can't handle chases and get downed in 10 seconds. 95% of survivors you see running it at high ranks are absolute trash. 
---
\*Gently grabs trap instead of survivor\* *My precious\~*
---
That's just a different tactic....stealth.
---
what if you don't have every perk or every teachable?

Signal Jumping jacks to say they are camping. 
---
Ignore that guy, a memory leak would have no bearing on things like that. The exact same thing happens to me and my friend too. My rig has dated CPU/mobo/RAM, but his is pretty new and in great condition. It's just this game. 
---
It's really not meta if you don't have the chase mechanics of a toddler. any other perk works better because you could just walk/sprint instead of being immersed everywhere. 
---
r/woooosh idiot 
---
don't dc
---
Bro... that’s kinda cringe bro...
---
Yes. Most games work fine. The most lag I’ve experienced was from Titanfall 2.
---
I love how you 360 Freddy on PS4 with his long reach and then drop a pallet on him. That was so sad.
---
Whispers, BBQ, Nurse's and Ruin. 
---
I like to swap ruin for Shadowborn as it can help me with aiming.

Mori is up the butt!

Only the hatchet will hit an invisible wall halfway between you and the target. 
---
Oh dang, thats hot
---
Thank you. Seriously, thank you. 
---
16k on steam as of an hour ago. I checked steam charts. Usually a good place to get a player count for games.
---
Game is doing well it seems.
---
And when you prestige her she has a bloody stealthy outfit,contrasting with other survivors like Kate,who shows a lot of skin (oh my), therefore making her less immersed than Claudette,who shows less skin and is black even when she’s played with her prestiged outfit
---
Its a given with the changes that elements like bloodlust would be suppressed, remembering that bloodlust only occurs because looping existed in the first place.
---
Again its not a chase, its musical chairs, its playing ring around the rosey with a killer until the survivor makes a big enough mistake to be downed, or until the killer decides to leave. Yes your being followed by the killer sure, but again when i think a chase i don't think a survivor running around a broken car with a killer on the other side of it.
---
Ultimately its tricky to pin down one change, since you would have to be careful, design stuff in a way that fairly discourages looping while also allowing survivors to escape based on Pallets. It makes it tricky, you cant just do stuff like scratchmark suppression on pallet drops or stuns since it does not stop looping. You cant slow breaks because again by itself it does not stop looping. I have not suggested a idea because i don't have anything pinned down enough to present as a idea, its a problem because at the core of the game nothing was put in place to stop looping. 
---
If i was to suggest rough elements that could be a direction to explore have some check or something, if a survivor runs past a pallet a certain amount of times or runs near it too many times the pallet becomes fragile and the killer can break it while it is still up, then ontop of this maybe have the idea that a pallet stun will decrease the time a survivors scratches stay present for a short amount of time and perhaps gives them a speed boost so give that Dance with me/Lithe sorta dynamic. Increase pallet break times aswell maybe and perhaps even slow the killer down a bit aswell so there is a bit more leeway in open areas for survivors to make a choice.
---
(Keeping in mind before fellow killer mains burn me at the stake that these changes would go in hand with generator changes, changes that will rework how you work on generators making a funner minigame then looking at a bar, allowing generator times to be extended enough that Killer are on a far looser time limit. So survivors have more incentive to get away from the chase instead of just stalling, because stalling would be less effective because generators would not pop in the time it takes to find one person).
---
You just activated King Crimson 
---
Unfortunatly the best we can do is to increase the deterrent to unsafe unhooks, increasing the penalty to unsafe unhooks.
---
Maaaaybe lowering the point reward for hitting someone who just got off the hook to deter tunneling, but that's debatable.
---
Wouldn't those burns/hooks on trapper say the same, iirc? 
---
With touch buttons no one should use it. 
---
Dead Hard is trash. It is the least problematic perk for me as a killer main. I'd rather deal with a DH user than a SB, Lithe, or BL user. They are so easy to kill that... you know what... keep telling people DH is best exhaustion perk so I don't have to deal with any speedsters.
---
&gt;The only time this perk really feels good is when you sabotage hooks to 99% and then finish it later in the match as the killer is carrying a survivor to the hook. It's a powerful perk in that moment, but there's so much set up to that moment, and sometime even after all that set up the moment never comes.
---
That, and there's literally no counterplay on the killer's side, outside of whacking the survivor and hoping they run away and don't just tap it before your hit cools down. Killers have no indication how sabotaged each hook is, and they can't kick hooks, either. It feels horrible to go up to a hook but some immersed survivor runs up and taps the hook down, meanwhile you're running out of time before the survivor gets off your shoulder. 
---
I mean, they did, in so many words. Average it out. Everyone agreeing on it is not a necessary prerequisite. That's kind of a random thing to expect from a suggestion post.
---
*heavy breathing*
---
I know for a fact that some of the survivors I've played with would still fail all three of those.
---
Leader only gives 10% repair speed bonus to every survivor doing the generator, including you!
---
Leader affects action speed of every action except working on generators (and vaulting).
---
Unfortunately real life doesn’t have these hit boxes 
---
I can only nod and stare.
---
I believe Bubba is saying words in a donkey language.
---
How many times does it have to be explained in this sub that Dead Hard has more uses than meets the eye? Extending loops, giving you extra distance to get to loops and vaults, etc.. As a high rank killer for almost every season since December, I can tell you that the absolute most annoying survivors to deal with are the ones who really know how to utilise Dead Hard to its fullest potential. You can call DH trash because most people who use it don't know how to use it fully, but SB is an absolute braindead perk that terrible players can just run and utilise decently well with no experience. 
---
If the gates are open and all the survivors are at full health. The game is already over.
---
No problem! Sometimes a little break from the game helps too. I find that if I get too angry with people being toxic, calling it a day and picking it up later helps. Otherwise it does seem like you get one jerk after the other in every game. 
---
Not in any way that you can counter like either of those perks, either.
---
Ok well consider you "pseudo moonwalk". What can the survivors do? Literally nothing? It's not like they can avoid going down. They have no counterplay to that. Palettes, loops, even healing doesn't work because then you can simply walk up to the them and they're dead.
---
That's the reason everyone dislikes Legion. They can't do much to prevent themselves from going down. 
---
She really is
---
Maybe im a bad legion but if i play him its still hard to get people with 4 stab wounds. He is good for slowing gens down mostly. 
---
Really? I dunno man I've seen some pretty good shit. But appreciate it nonetheless!
---
Thoughts? We want to promote the original intent of the character, and I think the 0 stack version is the way to go about this. The stats can obviously be moved around a little for balancing.
---
The Legion somewhat becomes an inverse Micheal. Once 1 stack is reached, we can grow the current iteration's of the The Legion further while not promoting tunneling (Survivors main complaint). This version also rewards a good Legion for getting all 4 stacks (Killers main complaint). Maybe Deep Wounds duration would need tinkered with.
---
What changes would you suggest? Should the power get reset (or even partially) if the killer is stunned?
---
He sounds like a pig to me.
---
Ok. I'll try to find it.
---
Yeahhhh.... as a relatively new player, it didn’t really click that there were Killers that actually wanted to let me escape. 
---
The first time it happened, I was the last one left as a David and the group only managed to get one gen on before they all died or something. The Nurse kept downing me and I thought I was successfully escaping, but they really just were dragging me to a gen.... but I kept running away. The Nurse was like repeatedly hitting a gen with me downed and it eventually dawned on me to fix the gen. 
---
While fixing it in front of them, I was just thinking, “What kind of sick game are you playing?”
---
But then they left me alone to find a gen. 
---
Some posts on here make it seem like it happens frequently, but I think I’ve only had it happen one other time where a Hag carried me to a hatch while I was desperately looking for it in the Game. 
---
Like I’ve had so many annoying games where people D/C and I don’t, but they don’t wanna have mercy on me T-T
---
Although I have had multiple games with Killers standing still doing an attack, it took me a couple of those kind of games to realize I could farm bloodpoints during it.
---
I checked the steam charts before I made this post too. That's why I was wondering if most of those players are high level or not. I've heard people say that they have a hard time finding games on PC. There's also a youtuber I watch that plays this game pretty frequently on PS4. He tried it on PC and said he only found 4-5 games on PC within 3 hours of streaming it. I'm pretty sure he tried playing both killer and survivor too, which is what worries me.
---
Bubba, for real. 
---
I have 1.5k hours in this game and I play 8-10 hours a day and have played at green-red rank every single season. When I say "most players are bad at this game", I mean it. There's a certain skill level you get to where you start realising how bad most other people are and how you're the one who has to loop the killer or push gens to get done almost every game. A lot of the best survivors in this game will tell you the same thing, that there aren't a lot of people who are genuinely good at this game. Like I said, I'm just going to assume you're one of the bad ones. 
---
When you haven't purchased some DLC? 
---
You know an argument is good when “Nah dude” gets responded with “Nah, bro.” 
---
So because your friends are shit at the game, everyone who uses DH is? OK. Sound logic. 
---
&gt;If SB can be utilized by brain dead users and perform decently, then surely better players can utilize it even better.
---
Google skill floor and skill ceiling. This isn't true in the slightest for a lot of mechanics in a lot of online games. 
---
If you don't have every teachable, you cant have every perk on a character. You can have all the perks that you've got the teachables for, but that doesn't mean you have every perk. 
---
Idk claudettes dont bother me regardless if they're prestiged or not. I might play billy or nurse to have an easier time but its whatever.
---
*ignores pallet*
---
Guys he broke out the hours
---
I know it's a meme but sometimes people doubt your experience and you just have to quip up with a little information that shows you know what you're talking about. 
---
Have you tried gen tapping? You just keep switching from repairing, to standing, back an forth, giving the game no tome to initiate a skill check. It’s relatively fast if you don’t trust the game to be lenient with skill checks. 
---
I agree with you but we would be wrong in saying that each player that uses ur an evasion is bad. Tru3 talent uses it and he is a decent survivor at worst. 
---
I stopped using urban evasion. I hate hiding nowadays. The game is fun when you want to loop and bamboozle. 
---
Damn! Very well made! Congrats, and obviously 10/10 Originality &lt;3
---
Honestly, if your timing is right, then he's half right.  5 minutes for 1 Gen through ruin is inexcusable for red ranks.  Killing himself on the hook is still pretty dickish though. 
---
Are you talking about the Sabo speed, or any general changes to the perk?
---
This drawing is so painful. Well made &lt;3
---
Start slapping a gen and maybe they’ll start working on it?
---
There are two skills in this game. 
---
Looping
---
Knowing when to do what. Should I heal myself now or should I do the gen now? The former might be the best option or sometimes the latter seems to be the b St option. Should I go for the save now or shall I let my teammate get to the second phase.  
---
These decision making skills coupled with the skill to loop the killer are the only skills in this game. I think you will agree.
---
Why not just switch it? 
---
Probably any general changes. 
---
The red eyes really set it over the top. Great job.
---
Urban gives you no benefit though. I reckon all decent survivors who run Urban just don't realise they're wasting a perk slot, because they are. 
---
Oh, yes. It annoys me to see people play very stealthy and waste time unnecessarily😐
---
The consensus is generally that he's terrible, he's just unfun.
---
Same thing with prove thy self?
---
Or just sit slightly closer to the screen because claude being invisible is just a meme and it’s really not any harder to see her than any other survivor hiding in a bush
---
Are you positive they were “teaming” and it wasn’t just that the Meg clued into the fact they wanted to farm and you didn’t? I believe more context or even game footage would be needed before making any final claims on this.
---
Lol
---
Fair enough, but you spent 500k to get it? 
---
No they were 100% teaming. 
---
My friend is rank 1 and he wants to play with me so its like rank 14 rank 1 rank 13 rank 10 and rank 10
---
Moris refused to appear :(
---
Like when you're hooked next to a gen that's regressing from 99% and the brown Claudette across the map is Urbaning her way to you whilst the only other person left alive on your team is in a chase and already injured? Yeah. That's how a lot of games go. That's what I mean when I say most of the playerbase is shit, because they are. It really puts me off playing survivor sometimes. 
---
It’s an old iPhone lol
---
Beep! Beep!  *teabag, sprint burst*
---
Then what? Just watch as the now-injured survivor runs away? Either way it’s the same result
---
Is that the PS messages app? Why don't they have a profile pic?
---
I would be mad too if no one got a gen done in 5 minutes of me running the killer, regardless of ruin. I would have just noped out too to be honest. That is some rank 20 bs.
---
Yah, bro? 
---
Legionnaires by contrast, are a complex people.
---
Some of them are losers who enjoy abusing exploits so they can murder people to death, others just like to be stabby-stabby without the killy-killy, still others just want to justify owning certain cosmetics, and yet others only want to see if all the Legion = DC memes are true.
---
It is, man. I love it when I'm chainsaw running across the map and I see a bright neon pink. ;)
---
Feels bad, Jeff.
---
Empathy, Spine Chill, Self Care, and then I cycle the last one. I ran lightweight for a while cause I forget not to sprint a lot or just really like running around. Botany Knowledge was my go-to third perk for literally forever especially when paired with Empathy because I prefer to play support and do my best to heal the other survivors, and healing them faster is great. Recently I've been running Ace in the Hole because getting an item with add-ons is basically the equivalent of Christmas to me. 
---
It's probably no surprise that I main Claudette, and my play style leaned heavily on her base perks for the absolute longest time. I'd run her three main perks and then have Spine Chill or Lightweight as the fourth depending on what I felt like accomplishing. In truth I'm the absolute worse at escaping the killer once I've been spotted. It's pretty much guaranteed that the second they see me I'm gone. For that reason none of my perks are build for the more aggressive play styles  and I do my best to stay hidden and pop out when my teammates need me. Think of me as your walking med-kit. I will drop what I'm doing and walk across the map to heal you the second Empathy triggers, and if I'm close enough to play distraction so you can get away? Well, yeah I'll do that too. 
---
Not just that. Also add that you have kindred and even then they can't decide what to do. 😐. I don't blame beginners and that's exactly why the ranking system is bullshit in this game. Ranking up should be made really hard for survivors. Else we will have beginners at red rank 😣

Could you share the template??
---
When I start a chainsaw charge as Hillbilly, for the first split second the sensitivity shoots to like 300%, making it impossible to begin a chainsaw charge while chasing someone at even a slight curve. Does anyone else have that? Is it intentional?

I want to do this!
---

If you are in the LA area there’s a place called La-Ax that let’s throw axes for 25 bucks an hour. You can also reserve sessions for groups too. Only thing is you have to be 21 or older to do it

Debates are about convincing other people, not the other person. So the upvotes and downvotes will decide who was terrible. And downvotes are not for disagreeing, which is what you used it for. You also attacked my grammar, sadly. You attacked other people outside of the debate without knowing them and overall moved away from the original point to attack others to validate your argument. I've made this argument before and don't care to explain it to you because if my friends claim the same things you do, that DH is an amazing loop extender, then surely they would be good. But apparently rank 1 streamers that you don't know aren't actually good. I've seen players better than all well known streamers, they just don't stream because streaming a game with averages of 6 viewers a stream is pointless. You'd rather believe others are piss poor at the game than to believe maybe you are wrong.

That was fast, your welcome
---
ehhhh dont see how discordance would suffer. nor surveillance. it would give that a buff. and i alre ady mentioned the new killer perk.
---
No kidding, tonight on a post about people being nice to eachother because there was a DC, there was an edgelord that made such a big deal about how edgy he was and how much he tryhards. There's just so much toxic shit around here.
---
I dont think that really solves anything. If they just made it 7 gens I feel like the game would have a good pace. Would be nice to see diff objectives as a whole though.
---
Yea that seems like it would be sweet! The ambience with the power boost is super fitting.
---
For killer I would suggest raising your sensitivity. Most people think 360’ing works... But it really doesn’t. You just need to be able to turn fast enough on your swing more than often.
---
Absolutely they both take skill. You have to anticipate where the survivors will go and place the traps.
---
Chases all include everything the other guy said. You aren't wrong, if you can't run the killer then you're a liability that constantly needs to be saved. But he is also right, too.
---
i agree. im not saying don't add more objectives. im saying fix the one we already have. and THEN add more.
---
The worst thing I ever did to a killer was a Faint/Hazy/Murky Reagent and a Swamp Offering. Poor Killer couldn't see a thing.
---
If my whole point is that most people are bad at the game because they run a popular perk that I don't think is good, of course I'll get downvoted. What kind of logic is that? Votes mean fuck all. I'm not saying the streamers aren't good because I haven't seen them, I'm saying they aren't good at using Dead Hard because you told me for a fact that they couldn't use it effectively against you. You're really struggling for points here and it really shows. I feel bad for you and I'm tired so if you think having the last word means you've "win", then go ahead and reply to this with another made-up "fact" that you think makes you right. Do it. I'll let you have this one ;) After all, it's the small victories that keep us sane, right? 
---
Remember, kids, don't face camp. Unless it's a toxic SWF, then you don't owe manners for shit.
---
I made a typo in my first message and wrote leader twice. 
---
Prove thyself gives you and every survivor working with you on the same generator a 10% repair speed bonus. It doesn't stack, so even if there are 4 people with prove thyself, only 10% bonus is awarded. 
---
Leader gives you a 25% bonus action speed to everything but vaulting and repairing generators. Leader doesn't stack with other leaders. Only one leader at a time.
---
Please stop inserting yourself into other conversations of mine. It's sad. 
---
Nah. I unlock on top of them its the chase that makes me loose them. I have a hard time keeping up with people on certain maps. Like coldwind 
---
Having sex with Trapper daddy is good uwu 
---
40 seconds for one person isnt enough, it takes 30-60 to walk around the map and find your first survivor. In that time someone can bust out 2+gens with a toolbox or a second person
---
A Native American Survivor would be amazing! 
---
I have to say, I'd personally prefer it if they were less an image of the stereotypical 1700s Native American, but I'd still love having them if they were!
---
&gt; Slowdown for 2 seconds or less and the slowdown after you puke is so small its barely noticeable.
---
Still hurts in loops, thats the problem
---
&gt; Because unlike other killers while you're sick you're constantly telling the killer where you are.
---
No aura reading like Freddy has, no bubbles like Doc. Only time it gives you away is if you want to be immersed
---
&gt; It takes like 2 seconds of puke to put them into broken if you're close enough. If the killer were 110% movement then yeah that might be a valid strat, but a 115% killer should have no problem staying close.
---
With the slowdown its harder than you think against a good survivor. People will learn how to counter her.
---
&gt; Right now in the PTB, it could be longer in full release.
---
I damn hope it will be longer, right now its useless to puke on objects.
---
Im not saying shes terrible, she has the potential to be really good. But she needs some buffs, the sickness needs to do more.
---
Hag maybe 
---
What the hell is wrong with you? I'm browsing the dbd sub and I happen to come across your comment. I didn't even look at who made the above comment. It's a community forum, there are no 1on1 conversations. Get over yourself.
---
my Jeff loves you too!
---
Sounds like someone sucks at hiding.
---
Np, have fun!
---
Are they really bots im the tutorial or just tgem running a simple script?
---
the original gens are boring in practice as well. im not sa ying dont adda nother objective
---
I wonder too.
---
Lol 
---
I think you're right. It's annoying just because there's so many little things that could use tweaking, like this perk/interaction, but not many of them are big enough nor unbalanced enough to receive an actual change anytime soon.
---
Also, on a somewhat unrelated note why have there been no new survivor obsession perks? Is there any reason for that?
---
I love this style! Very cute 
---
No idea. Probably because obsession perks for survivors have to be designed a certain way. 
---
Not exactly the easiest thing to thing about. 
---
Thanks owo 
---
What you might not be considering on wraith is how his power makes it easier to find survivors initially instead of them hiding when they hear the terror radius. Most of the time you will get that first hit fairly quickly as well now that uncloaking has built in speed burst.
---
Eh, trust me they meet enough of them daily to remember that you do.
---
I've noticed that slugging doesn't really work too good on higher ranks :/ but yeah I got the achievement anyways 3 hatch standoffs later.
---
Fuck man that sounds great I wonder why I don't do that more often, hmm.

As soon as I saw this post I knew someone would say that

Untrue. P3 Claudette in front of brick and specific other textures is legit invisible.

I'm so bad at the game, I'm like rank 82

Adrenaline, Dead Hard, WGLF, Borrowed time.

I hate people who tunnel and deny others the chance to play the game.

I like using perks that let me be creative in a chase.

I love clutch plays with adrenaline.

guys i was kidding don't downvote he's my friend irl
---
What’s your point?
---
Bitches be bitches.
---
i have no idea who this dude is
---
Oh noes, down votes!
---
Ride ass, full charge, hose down the survivor and GG
---
The other survivor was struggling on the hook when I found him crouching over in this area and once I downed him and started carrying him to the hook I saw the hatch and realized he had been hatch camping, feels bad
---
Based on OP’s profile pic it looks like she is a girl not a he

---
Trapper takes alot of map awareness aswell as Hag. Survivors like to act like they know-all about the game and will bash anyone who threatens their goodtime. All killers take some skill. Some more than others, but still. 
---
Wait, isn't Jeff from the future?
---
As a teenager he was paid by The Legion to paint a mural for them while he was away from home during one of his parent's fights. Given that the Legion disappeared by 1996 and he was still in high school after painting the mural he would probably have been 17 or 18 when he painted the mural in 1996 (or 1995, although I find it unlikely the Legion was around that long).
---
The Jeff we know in the game has had 5+ occupations and has a full beard that is starting to get gray hair. He's at least in his mid-to-late-30s, but possibly as old as his 50s. Given that his father had died of old age when he was taken by the Entity, I'd guess that he was probably in his or 50s (most people have children in their 20s and old age usually takes men in their 70s) when he was nabbed.
---
Maybe it's just me, but I always figured he was taken from, like, the year 2029 or so (17 in 1996 and 50+).
---
RIP blood points. I think I've had my three for over a year.

Slugging isn't the only viable strategy, you can do without it. I've seen multiple people do without it.
---
Yes it is a smart thing to do if a good situation presents itself.
---
Hey guys, I just started playing a couple days ago and was wondering what's the best way of managing my time on DBD. After I reach lv40 on a survivor should I just move on the next to get all teachables or keep going until I prestige that character?
---
Get the kick fast enough with the one that uncloaks you on certain actions.
---
*Survivor starts running*
---
*Kicks gen faster than Shaggy could*
---
*Attacks survivor*
---
That's called Hillbilly flick. It's intentional, as far as I know.
---
It is; one of his Very Rare add-ons. I personally enjoy Wraith, but he's not for everyone.
---
Glad you got the achievement finally. &lt;3
---
Yes, yes they can. 
---
Oh god so my poor Dwight build is not very effective against legion that’s unfortunate 
---
I'll trade ya
---
She does pray very quality while she has corrupt purge but I am unsure if the survivors can hear it
---
Marking their territory? This is the epitome of asserting dominance.
---
To discourage close range 'charges' I presume.
---
You can slug the survivor and go after the guy who sabo'd the hook. 
---
The survivor basically traded the guy going on the hook for a lot of progress on a generator he'd have done if he wasn't sabotaging multiple hooks.
---
People of this sub, we must spread this new meme format
---
If you play killer on the PTB you'll see a very clear issue. If you end a game fast youll lose points for lack of chases. If survivors work on gens, youll lose points on gate keeper. Theres no possible way to pip unless you have a neer perfect game where survivors dont kill themselves and do very little gens. Sometimes ill even depip if i get a 4k or a 3k which should be a win. Its just a tad much. While I dont think we should be spoonfed pips, I do think currently its way too hard to pip. 
---
This is a very good idea, it should be implemented asap.
---
Tho I doubt you get them to agree to additional bloodpoints.
---
50 devotion? That is some SERIOUS devotion to this game.
---
To the hook with him!
---
Few gaming subs have the quality of shitpost we can boast of here.
---
It aint much? Oofers
---
Jeff is from 2018 (give or take a year). It's never specified how his father died, so he could've died from a heart attack, car accident, or something similar. Jeff if he was 17 in 1996 he'd be 39 now, which seems accurate given his appearance.
---
You should record it the next time they're being dirtbags. Report it to Twitch. Odds are, if they're monetized/affiliated, they won't be anymore. :\^)

Nice, I wasn’t sure if they would even notice our conplaints on here

Not sure if someone's made this already but I swear this is some original content
---
I would wink at you but my eyes are affixed open.
---
Hey... that's sad...
---
I am not saying what you are doing is negative in any way, I'm just pointing out that they probably remember that a killer can camp them.
---
That was literally all I've said.
---
Looping is the reason Killers are a reactionary role, the Mindgame for the killers is entirely reliant on the survivor making a mistake in the first place. This has been a big thing for a while now, the whole Killer have no control because a survivor must make the first mistake.
---
The entire point of this conversation was about stopping looping and figuring out something that isn't ring around the rosey, so yes the idea is a mechanic that stops a survivor looping is the point of it. Its not about the killer being bad at loops its about stopping looping from being the primary killer, survivor interaction. Therefore a method to look at is to disincentives a survivor from running the same path through a pallet. Also you cant complain about the Fragile thing not making sense, many mechanics in this game don't make sense, its the same dynamic as how the Space crab blocks vaults. If you want something that makes more sense aesthetically a survivor running near the same pallet causes the entity to stir wrapping around the pallet, killer can use the action button and cause the entity to crush the pallet, breaking it. 
---
Why did that idea turn me on?
---
I mean OINK.
---
Head on brudda
---
^^(I ^^agree.)
---
She just pleased my entity ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
no worries honey
---
Freddy can still slug, it's just less effective on him.
---
Yeah but that's the point of sabotage, you sacrifice time on a generator for a potential of a save. If the risk pays off and the killer does attempt to hook someone at the hook you have sabotaged and you save that survivor from getting hooked. If they don't then you have wasted a lot of time and in effect put your team and yourself at a disadvantage.
---
In a situation when that risky play pays off you as the killer are not supposed to have a guaranteed way of nullifying that. What would be even the point of doing it if you were? 
---
Without add-ons you're not supposed to hit the survivor more than once, it's made for them to stop doing gens while you hunt the others and to put pressure on hiding from you. Even with yellow add-ons you shouldn't be hitting them more than once per mend because they get a second speed boost and it's faster just to cancel your frenzy.
---
Well then I guess we'd just have to hope the date went well enough for her to want to cut us some slack.
---
As a solo survivor main I get into matches nearly instantly, all the time. I typically get to rank 1 each season. Queue times don't really change much unless you rank up really quickly around rank reset, then it can take up to about 30 seconds to find a match. Not at all bad. 
---
As killer I play casually and only get to about rank 8 each season. I don't have many issues at all with filling lobbies, they fill within 10-20 seconds. 
---
Hag crushes huntress in my opinion. 
---
Why is Altruism designed to punish Survivors teams that don't get caught? Objective designed to punish a Survivor that runs a killer for 5 gens and 2 gates?
---
I had a game like this and couldn't confirm but it looked similar to this
---
"...as by the time someone gets hit it's usually a bit too late"
---
It's already too late, No One Escapes Death. It's not that big of a problem to deal with. It takes about 15 seconds to break a totem anyway, if they are found all the totems could be broken less than two minutes into the game. Of course that's not always the case but because of the new totem spawn placements, it's really not that hard to find and disable them.
---
Yes but you are still getting the effect of slowing down the game as someone has to get off a gen to go pick them up. It's less effective as he has a harder time defending the slug.
---
As I've mentioned before, you can slug the guy and still generate pressure. 
---
When you go for sabotage there is no guarantee that you are not completely wasting your time. The killer might down the survivor miles away from you or near a hook that you haven't sabotaged yet. It is a risk and reward situation for that survivor. Yes, if his risky time investment pays off then that survivor deserves the payoff.
---
&gt;By that logic, the survivor shouldn't get a guaranteed save
---
Yes they should, I've just explained why. It is a risk and reward situation, there is a 50/50 chance they are wasting their time and being useless for their team.
---
Hums in approval. 
---
Prob just lagging real hard 
---
It's almost like the survivors don't have fun against legion. I know, unthinkable right?
---
I doubt it will happen sadly
---
that would be really nice if they did release Chapter 13 as Friday the 13th
---
GJ. These kind of things you learn to do with Billy. Shows real skill with him. 
---
Seems pretty tough to implement. It'd be nice, but I don't expect to see it.
---
I don't know, I wasn't even trying to make an innuendo. Just ominously reference Billy the Puppet.
---
I mean, uh, OINK?
---
&gt;  the Mindgame for the killers is entirely reliant on the survivor making a mistake in the first place.
---
You honestly believe that the killer doesn't have any input in that, and that the killer can't outplay the survivor? If it's not about the killer being bad but about the survivors being bad then experienced killer streamers like Zubat must be getting incredibly lucky every game and getting crappy survivors. You see how stupid that sounds? Skill of the killer matter just as much as the skill of the survivor, to think otherwise is ignoring how the game works.
---
The way of playing you are proposing is incredibly boring, as it is not fun to base the game on wanting to avoid any interaction with the killer. Why are you even playing a multiplayer game at that point? Go play amnesia or Alien Isolation if you want to play a hide and seek game.
---
Ty for the pro-tips friend! I’ll have to try out your suggestions. I’m a baby killer but a veteran survivor, sooo.. I need all the killer advice I can get lol. My dream build is Endurance, Spirit Fury, Pop Goes The Weasel, and BBQ. All on Hillbilly 
---
Hag is top 4 killer. Trap placement is everything with hag, and knowing trap placement is where skill comes in. 
---
Haha, that's fair. I said that simply because Trapper is an OG killer, and it seems that the only people who play him nowadays are veterans to the game. They got the game when it first came out and mastered Trapper (since they only had three killers to pick from), and they still play him to this day. A P3 Trapper terrifies me.
---
As did I up until now! lmao i got hatemail once saying i only got them bc it was pale rose....but i was Myers &amp; that map is hard to keep pressure on without mobility. 
---
When you remember that killers are still trapped here. Makes this sad. Amazing work.
---
I remember seeing one “Chase the survivors for a total of 3 minutes with The Nurse” 
---
Yeah, I play Trapper, Myers, and Pig and Swamp is a fucking nightmare.
---
Here [http://waifu2x.udp.jp/](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/)
---
You're welcome ;) 
---
I played so good in one match tonight that I went all the way from rank 99 to rank 1 in just that one match.
---
That's got to be a bug of some sort.  There's no one hit down add-on, no perk that even COULD be affecting it (even bugged interaction).  It's either lag or a bug causing a double hit somehow, but it never even goes through injured as far as I can tell. 
---
I use Shards and Cells for customization only. I just buy the DLCs.
---
Yup, all the killers and survivors I wanted to level are at a good level now, so saving was so much easier than I expected! Although it does suck once you realize one million bloodpoints gets a character to like level 30...
---
My shards go towards cosmetics. The grind for bloodpoints and more shards isn't bad with a group of buddies and time to kill, so the shrine is out the window for me aside from having all the perks except from Jeff &amp; Adam I believe.
---
I personally would say to *buy* the DLC, as shards still take awhile to earn those bigger numbers needed to buy them, even if you're playing a lot with friends. You get two characters and an exclusive (albeit lame, but still) cosmetic for the surv and can put all those shards into perks from the shrine or cosmetics without having to wait forever to play and grind for the chatacter you want, if I'm making sense.
---
BHVR is super generous by making them grindable if they're non-licensed chapters in exchange from some pricey nice cosmetics to buy for an equal price of a full pack as an alternative, but I prefer to just get the packs to save time while supporting them and just nabbing cosmetics for em as I rack up shards.
---
I mean yes but plenty of trappers/hags just hard camp/patrol
---
Where do you think plague would be?
---
it's worse than a closet it's just a brick box that had a hole in it to feed him through
---
dude no one gives a shit about your PSN messages with some random from a match we didnt even see footage from. like actually no one cares
---
just remember that the toxic people are either angsty 13 year olds, or virgin 25 year olds
---
Yah that's a good point. The one thing I hate about perk changes is that on most killers it can be a good change whereas usually on just one it can be devastatingly op. Look at the new Thanta change in the PTB. It's now usable for other killers but on legion, the perk is now devastatingly strong. 
---
I'm not sure about overcharge. I mean its only real counter is technician which has a 50% chance to stop gen explosions. 
---
I really like your suggestion of Beast of prey. It makes the perk much more practical while also having some interactivity. 
---
The reason I never listed Insidious on the buffing of perks is that it seemed to me like it was built for the sole use of camping. It doesn't seem to have many other purposes. I do like your idea though. It sounds like that can be incorporated into its existing effect. Would make starting momentum really strong for some killers. 
---
What app is that 
---
Get the Hag. She will bless thee with divine Reeeee and jumpscareth aplenty. She is holy, she is divine, she is....the beginning of the survivor's end. 
---
The Thanatophobia buff will actually make that Legion playstyle of hitting multiple people viable. Sloppy+Than, two perks could be whatever, probably one of these perks ruin/BBQ/Bloodhound/Monitor
---
Ouuuuuf
---
That's a horrible pallet
---
Beautiful result tho
---
Its amazing that the devs thought it was ok to release Legion.
---
This brilliant 😂
---
Yeah Trapper and Wraith were tortured until they killed. Not sure about the others but Billy does have balls of iron in him and whatnot so
---
I wouldnt call his perks “awesome” but they are 10x better than Jane’s perks for sure.
---
The new PTB update makes it that at every gen a 3% stackable bonus is gained. A max is reached at 15%. Still, I see it as being too weak to be worth anything. The minor increase in action speed does not make up for the lack of gens and increased pressure you have to face.
---
PWYF - Gives it a nice synergy with remember me. That's quite alright.
---
Predator - Not really sure about the effect you are describing. 
---
Pop Goes the Weasel - I quite like the requirement for hooking someone as it rewards you for doing it. Having an infinite timer though would make the perk more useful so you can pick a gen as opposed to rush to the closest one. The way you described it makes it a bit strong for patrolling gens. Maybe instead make the gens regress a bit faster if kicked instead of having the 25% effect permanent.?
---
Gas! Gas! Gas!
---
This is the best tier list I've ever seen. Tier lists are highly subjective though. The only part I disagree with is Leatherface being D. I feel he belongs in C. And a good clown could easily be B tier. But overall, love it. Wise man you are.
---
I really wish it was harder to rank up as both killer and survivor. I have such a bad time at rank 1 survivor right now. Just keep dying and dying, but I still almost always safety pip.
---
I like it being loud ,added some nice tension 
---
After the match klick on the thumbs up or down next to the name and I would choose unsportsmanlike behaviour
---
Congratulations! You are the 1,000,000th person to rehash this joke!
---
If you're willing to level nurse then stridor is really good on her as tracking is highly audio-based, nurse's calling is also good but that one's just good in general.
---
Playing killer on PS4 is really dificult. You have bap fps and the controls can make it easy for survivors to dodge your attacks. Also I see alot of toxicity from kids that play the game in ps4. 
---
Here is a video by a really talented killer that goes into depth about playing killer
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY
---
General Tips
---
Beginner Tips;
---
- Survivors spawn usually on the furthest part of the map away from you. More or less travel to gens that are furthest away from you and you should find survivors.
---
- When being looped around an object stack as close to the object as possible. Hug its wall. It makes you loop slightly faster which can help with making the survivor drop the pallet faster.
---
- Don't be scared to swing through pallets. On occasion, you can actually get a lucky hit on a survivor. If they drop the pallet on you-you get stunned for 3 seconds and then you can choose to chase them or break the pallet. There is no real loss and you shouldn't feel bad if you're stunned.
---
Counter-rotate survivors if they lose line of sight from you. You don't always have to follow them. It can work wonders if you can predict where they are going to go.
---
In PS4 I don't lunge unless it's at a pallet because of how easy it is to 360 a killer. I would just walk right behind them and then press R2 so that they cannot avoid the hit.
---
- Watch more talented killers such as Tru3 talent and watch how he plays the game. You can learn a lot from killers like him. My personal favourite is Damnohtml, Tru3talent, Ardetha, and Zubatlel. All excellent killers. 
---
- Don't be dismayed. Being killer can be really stressful and at times more painful than fun. Eventually though once you get into the swing of killer then you will eventually find enjoyment in the job. Nothing is more satisfying than killing a survivor that has been tea-bagging you and flash lighting you just to see them cry at you after the match is complete.
---
- You have a red stain in front of you that shows survivors where you are looking. If you are being looped around an object you can look away from the direction your moving to hide the direction your traveling. It can confuse survivors and make them run into you or you run into them as they didn't expect it.

Why is this so funny to me

If you think you need BBQ on Spirit (or every killer for that matter) you’re doing it wrong.
---
Hooray for skillcheck simulator
---
Technician only prevents the audio notification for the killer, you still get gen progression penalty.
---
You forgot hillbilly

i shall proceed to persuade you with one word: legion

What was she at?

Assert dominance by T posing and throwing up on people

What’s wrong with trying to go for a 4K? Killers are killers our ideal goal is to kill every survivor.
---
MMR?

Xd
---
It’s not hard anymore, but it used to be. They really dumbed this game down.
---
!remind me 24 hours
---
Ok not our fault have fun dcing and giving legion players free blood points 
---
Play Legion. Youll have alot more fun mining salt and dc's.
---
BT, WGLF, SC, and Deliverance
---
the running fast and ability to vault are both good mechanics. the missed attack cool down is absolute bullshit as well as the fact that chases take a predetermined amount of time to complete unless you're brain dead or let them bleed out. there's no counterplay to legion other than balanced landing or lithe. the other problem is that legion is not encouraged to go after other survivors, every time I branch out and go for someone else, something bullshit happens like a sprint burst or lithe. this incentivizes being a tunneling nerd because everything else is extremely punishable. legion is horrible for the game's long term health, much worse than what nurse or Freddy can ever be. there is no skill ceiling other than "oh that other person is close I can injure them too". the chase mechanics and mind games are the best part of the game, and if the developers can't see that, I fear for the future of this game and it's community. we're getting to that overwatch/call of duty mentality of "push button, impact game" and if there are no plans to rework legion, myself and many others will leave this community.
---
Wasn't too sure if people in this subreddit would be too sensitive for some of the humor, but I don't mind it
---
Hag takes a lot of game knowledge to do extremely well with.  If you know your maps/loops/general survivor psychology then she becomes insanely good.  
---
Also reminded me of the bugs in resident evil 4 that had the whole grab to facemelt thing going for them and like, nothing else.
---
I disagree. Sure you pip if you have a good game but having a good game against a 4 man of Claud and Nea at rank 2 is difficult
---
smh must have traced this from one of the official game artists
---
Edgar is dev10 lvl54 ATM, kitty was about to hit 11 yesterday. (Not 12 as I said before)
---
I've seen a grand total of 4 players with clown since he was released. every match is spirit/legion
---
why not NOED, it’s more of a crutch perk 
---
Oink
---
Seeing as how this post was meant to be as a joke, you ironically whooshed yourself there.
---
People were posting easy dailies, not impossible ones.
---
Cries in rank 1 on a low player-density area.
---
Discordance from legion is really good perk on spirit especially if you do a prayer beads build.
---
Jesus. They really oughta start handing out rewards for that sort of stuff. I know Pug reached Devotion 10 today too. Gotta make it worth their while somehow. 
---
Maybe they were farming. Maybe the meg did something to get on the killer's good side. Maybe the meg was the obsession and the killer had stbfl. You have no idea what happened, and you shouldn't report people when you have no idea what's going on, especially when you're just doing it because you disagree with them.
---
The report button is not a super dislike button.
---
I actually encountered my first basement bubba a few weeks ago. Was excited to finally face one after hearing about them!

 I hate how hard this made me laugh lol

Damn, I ain't playing right then 
---
a entity corrupted plague doctor outfit would be better on the plague herself, the corruption would turn the mask into a plague ridden crow head with the iconic eyes and hat
---
Yeah. I can see that, but sometimes you just gotta laugh it off
---
Rank doesn’t matter tho so why bother? I get it helps shift the balance, however there are plenty of people who have a full set of legit perks playing at rank 15. There aren’t any incentives to rank up. 
---
You are at rank 2. The 2nd best rank, and you're complaining that pipping up is hard. Nice. And having a decent game against a 4 man isn't that hard, and a decent game is all you need to pip. I'm at rank 1 even though i am very much not a good killer, i 100% admit that. I am not that good yet 90% of my matches at high ranks are either safety pips, 1 pip or 2 pips. If pipping up wasn't so goddamn easy i'd most likely be at rank 6-10, not at the highest rank where all the amazing players are supposed to be
---
All I can say is yikes
---
God I would LOVE an Isaac survivor, a necromorph killer, and an Ishimura map in this game. 
---
You couldn’t see, but you pallet stunned him and Freddy started crying. 
---
"Play the Wraith"
---
Sounds hard tbh
---
Yes. We need a casual mode anyways.
---
Normally a Wraith for me
---
Doc too high, Hag too low, Trapper too high.
---
Also Spirit is S-tier IMO. 
---
Who cares? 
---
I would say Hag takes game-knowledge, more than any other killer, and Trapper is straight up brainless, but why do you give a shit? 
---
Damn... I’m level 645.  It can’t go lower can it?
---
omg ur so dumb thats devotion LOL dont whoooosh me 
---
I would like to have an option to crawl faster at expense of health.
---
Wraith can use windstorm to cloak during chase and make it to pallets/windows before the survivors to bodyblock them, and with a windstorm wraith has quite a lot of map presence. Wraith is definitely not in the top-tier, but definitely mid-tier, and way better than Trapper, Freddy or Leatherface. 
---
On my second day playing this game I got hoarded on by the survivors on Xbox messages. I just got noed and I was doing ok (cause I watch hybridpanda) but still got whooped and they were talking mad shit. “NOED is toxic, you’re toxic” “EZ baby killer” “WOW nice NOED, scrubby” like what? I had like 2 perks and they were running full sets 
---
also coxcombed is just a meme, what you really want is windstorm + swift hunt. 
---
been for a long, bad players will tell you otherwise tho. 
---
RT is R2 but thanks I didn't know I could do that.
---
If someone else in my match dc’s against a legion while I’m solo, I’m 100% joining them. Legion is an awful killer, but a 3 man with 5 gens against Legion? Fuck. That.
---
Because doing gens faster is still worth the chance of a NOED.
---
And then you remember that even tho some of them are enjoying way too much being trap there (Doctor, Clown, maybe Legion etc...) Some of them just don't want to be here AT ALL (Huntress, Wraith, Nurse, Spirit, maybe Hillbilly etc...).
---
I'm not counting the licensed killers in this by the way.
---
BHVR is too comitted to their non-sense Emblem system to even consider this, I'm afraid. They did change killer pipping to be more directly dependent on kills, but then came Emblems - this unnecessarily complex system that now however, after a bunch of reworks, lets just about anyone rank up if they just look at the game funny. Red ranks are filled with subpar players, the skill disparity is huge, and it destroys the game experience, for all (except those that don't really want a challenge but beat up on players decidedly below their skill/experience level, I suppose).
---
Rank should definitely be more directly tied to surviving/killing - *the* game objectives. Of course there are more nuanced variables at play here that determine how valuable a player potentially was, but for the purposes of ranking, evaluating those on a per-round basis is asinine. Ultimately, taken over a large number of rounds played, a player's survival/kill rate will tell a conclusive-enough story about how good they are at the game, and create a vastly more even playing field, in the context of a MMR system. For survival rates, the system could actually take into account the entire "team", since this would also reward players that got chased for 5 gens and then died the sole hero of that round (and not reward players that screw their team over and just play for hatch): again, spread over a multitude of matches, most of the nuances stop significantly skewing the results, and the average survival rates of the matches (1-4) a player played in start telling a good story about how good they are.
---
The only actual problem I see with this is that the top ranks would be filled to the brim with Nurse. This problem could of Course be solved by finally solving the Nurse problem...
---
I only prestige for the bloody faces. I put a ton of points into my Feng, but then I saw her P3 and was rather disappointed, wish I had just kept her at 50. Take a look at the survivors bloody cosmetics and see if they’re worth it for you.
---
"Maybe if we make the ranking system even worse, it'll go full circle and become good!"
---
What do you mean I would of had no idea what happened? I was in the game idiot, not you. I know what I saw, not you. Stop acting as if I were blind and assumed wrong. I know what I saw. I the Meg helping the killer, bringing her to my teammates and I, constantly getting us farmed and doing a gen right in front of her while I was on the hook. Don't assume mate. 
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
Camping and getting downed to lag are really annoying. The lag I let the killer know that that's why they got me, but being continually matched with shit ping hosts is really annoying. Camping is a choice and is a fucked up one. I'll throw a couple of insults at their gameplay and how shit they are 
---
Well, see, now you are saying this as a fact without any background or any research. Simply because you believe in it and you know that others will believe in it, therefore giving you the feeling of accomplishment, I guess.
---
I have never projected on you my own feelings or emotions. I understand why you think it's dark, but again, this is just experience, wits and... I guess you can call it guts. 
---
And speaking of narcissism once again: you talk only about yourself over and over and over again. You belittle other people and make yourself look good on expense of others. I gave you more examples, but you chose to ignore them. 
---
Since most people won't know what it is, you gotta have a good story for them . . .
---
* For Grandma, it's your grade point average . . . 5.0 baby!
---
* For chicks, it's how many times you've turned down Ariana Grande (but she keeps calling).
---
* If you end up in jail, it's how many times you've killed.

I give the hatch when survivors get shafted by the rest of the team. Mainly out of kindness but also as a big 'fuck you're to the rest of them.

Did a game today where my Ruin totem spawned in a really obscure spot and they simply couldn't find it. One survivor played like a complete potato and got downed and hooked three times in the first few minutes and then two others rage quit as soon as I picked them up. That left a single David alone with only 1 gen done.
---
He came and found me and just stood there waiting to be hit. I smacked him once for the points then hit the nearest gen. He got the message and once he'd completed it I found the hatch and messaged him to tell him where it was.
---
We had a friendly little chat afterward.
---

The truth is that to get to rank 1 survivor you just have to play. Loop a bit, do a gen and already Safe Pit.
---
The hard thing is the killer pip. To pip you need to get 3 kills most of the times, which at high ranks is kinda hard since everyone goes toolbox, adrenaline, DS and Flashlights
---
It’s not a myth though
---
Funny how the OP's my friend.
---
I had the same happen to me. The surv readied up with a 1k+ ping(no joking; the others were green)
---
Welcome back, survivors are worse than ever
---
Not long ago i was playing as wraith for a daily, i need to mention that i fooken succ with wraith, never played with him and i don't plan on playing, sudenly a group of 4 people join the lobby
---
They all escaped, the basic... T bagging, clicking flashlights etc etc... When that game ended i said to myself "im going to stay awake all night looking for this assholes to murder their asses" i selected hillbilly cuz i had all the mfing perks with him, and there they are... When i was about to ready due to V E R Y G O O D B U T T O N P L A C E M E N T O N C O N S O L E i accidentaly pressed Rt which switches the character and i was now hag... Without perks... and no add-ons
---
Turns out they can't do much about a killer that can actually plan his moves because t bagging doesn't quite help you surviving
---
I wish the comunity had more of the guys you play against and not the guys i have to play against
---
Take a break. Everytime I have a string of games where I'm found immediately, it gets upsetting. I take a break and try again later. 
---
Thank you!
---
They couldn’t do a single gen in five minutes. 
---
They had two other options
---
A) Gen Tap
---
B) Find ruin
---
No excuses
---
This is obviously advertising smh
---
Dude my whole build is around stealth
---
I lagged like this once it was terrible doing gens but the killer couldn't catch me
---
BLAHRGARHAGRAHAGRAGAHAA!
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Is the game installed on HDD or SSD? I've noticed this as well when I uninstalled steam from SSD, and installed it on HDD, since I got run out of free space on my 120gb SSD.
---
I have the same problem... sometimes its sooo frustrated... i get hooked and survivors comes with the killer chasing him... unhook me and im always thinking„ ok dont need to run away“. so almost im just playing like 4 or 5 games and take a break before i get to angry. Watching youtube or watch tv to calm down
---
Same here, each time there is 1-2 DCs, I'll always let the other 2 survivors do the gens, farm some points from me and escape. Being someone who has played plenty of survivor games too, I know how much it sucks when someone DCs because they got downed once.
---
I don't have anything clever to say, but have an upvote!
---
Bro wtf I'm 246 how u so good
---
HOOORRRYYYY SHHHHIIIIIET!
---
Broken and will never be fixed lol which is sad

Hah! Only one hatchet, huh? What a loser Huntress has to use  Iredescent Head to kill, go git gud noob killer!

In my experience freddy's are one of the most fair playing killers. I don't know other people their experiences, but when i play against a freddy I usually have a great, fair game.
---
It's rampant in this community for a variety of reasons but mostly entitlement and safe spaces:
---
The shitlords don't get shut down on social media and etc. So they can spout off whatever terrible or wrong opinion they have and not get shut down.
---
The balance is bad and Survivors are used to the devs bending over backwards to cater to them. To be fair, the devs are trying to filter out these people and I've noticed they've taken a more hard line stance with the post-game chat. But it's just scratching the surface. Want to send a message? Take away Fog Whisperer status from streamers that routinely behave poorly. Actually punish ragequitting (which dedicated servers might actually fix). 
---
Also me and my friend play ace, and we are not the most fun players to play against, we only play him because of his cool sunglasses and don't use any of his perks.
---
Davids are usually pretty ok as far as survivors go and Pigs are usually alright in terms of killers.
---
how tfq... I have rank 167...
---
But fr i started playing in january and now i am rank 2 but maybe it is bc i play on console
---
Excuse me but what the heckles is Leatherface doing in D?
---
Never got to play dead space and I wish I did.
---
Well... that just seems like his regular M.O
---
If you think this is why i should have been killed you havent seen the whole game before this
---
wat
---
Well maybe, but not for the teabagging
---
Had one yesterday for the first time. My whole team ran down and I was left with 4 gens. Feelsbadman
---
Bad
---
AWAKEN MY MASTERS!!
---
Legit.. survivors seem to forget that gens win matches. If somebody gets hooked, don’t rush the hook— you have time to do gens or whatever else for a bit before you go save.. So frustrating lol.
---
at least make a freaking macro or something, youre only making it worse for the others
---
Love your build. I'll definitely use some lithe builds next patch
---
I’ve had some clutch pebble throw and jump into a locker moments, makes for good fun rather than running the standard Meta Perks these days! It’s all about having fun :))
---
Exactly! I feel like all my teammates recently have been overly altruistic, they basically leave all the gens for me to do as they rush the hooks and get themselves killed in the process.
---
A three month span? You should be hitting red ranks by that point 
---
I don't see any messages on ps4. I camp all the time with leather face. Can't tell you how many times someone trys to save and I just chainsaw them. Multiple times I chainsawed everyone with one attempt 
---
Tru3?
---
That's what you get for teabagging.
---
Spawned in and ran to a chest, I was doing aces adept and was wanting to collect items, pulled a lunchbox and found a gen. Dont believe that screams "follow me I want tunneled" 
---
Isnt that what tge legion is but with lore cosmetics ? 
---
Dwights are the ultimate may may Lords and for killers huntress tends to be nice 
---
I wish it too buddy ! If you're free sometime wanna play together ? I need some people who play this game *and* are nice !
---
Don't let them put you down ,after all the harrasment in steam profile comments with spamming noob ,I finally disabled post game chat and turned my profile private!
---
Trust me it's better that way 
---
Level Hillbilly to get Enduring, that pair exceptionally well with Spirit Fury (both perks should be tier 3 for best results)
---
Me too ,I stopped playing dbd regularly because more I played more stressed and frustrated I got ! And the game is supposed to play to *relive* stress but in the end people behind screens can't do anything so just shrug them off and say GG
---
Bizarre flex. 
---
I can relate but maybe OP just needed to chill and had some toxic peeps in the lobby ? Sometimes it be like that 
---
Generally my sentiment. Like, really, you pulled a pallet down, didn't hit me at all, game just started, and you're humping the ground like I imagine military men with wives get pounded after coming home from deployment for months on end. 
---
I love this Nea skin
---
Only on reddit can two people stealth brag about something and one gets kudos for it and the other gets smashed into the ground for it. 
---
Reminds me of anime tropes, haha. 
---
Issac Clark perks:
---
“Stick around”: for every survivor next to you, you gain a 2/3/4% speed repairing. Add an additional 1/2/3% for every 30 seconds they’re next to you. 
---
Issac: “hey, stuck around, I’m full of bad ideas”
---
“Gravity boots”: press the active ability button to stomp on a chest, instantly granting you an item. Increases odds of getting a toolbox by 50/75/100% of at least uncommon value. Killer is notified when you use gravity boots.
---
Issac: “AHHHGHG!!!” -stomp-
---
TFW it took you awhile to realize the point...
---
*hangs head in shame*
---
There is also the saw series where the pig comes from . . .
---
I mean, I’ve been playing since 2016, so yeah. I’ve seen a lot of changes.
---
I obviously mean the current changes, otherwise I wouldn't criticize your comment
---
This was so annoying during the Lunar New Year event. Straight up a quarter of my event offerings were lost because of killer dc's.
---
I forgot about Jeff’s and Tapps because I don’t see them often. That professor guy can be cool too usually
---
You will die a lot in the beginning but you can still 'win' by doing enough before you die. Repairing generators, cleansing totems and unhooking teammates will all contribute to your final score.
---
okay, triggered fanboy.
---
I actually ran into a Bubba using this the other night finally. Wasn't even in the basement, hooked a guy, then just backed up a bit from the hook, and stood there. Radius vanished, and I snuck up behind him, but someone else ran for the hook so he ran off too. 
---
The Freddy DLC is not based on that movie, it is based on the 2010 remake.
---
Little known fact, this is actually just the Nurse when she takes her costume off
---
As a solo survivor this happens every game. I mostly play killer these days so I can laugh at the overly altruistic donuts throwing the match away. 
---
Silly goose. I don’t need a blood hunt to rot on my couch. 
---
Yea
---
&gt;at least make a freaking macro or something, youre only making it worse for the others
---
My peripherals don't have that feature otherwise I would gladly use it. After playing this game for so long I just can't be bothered to struggle anymore. This mechanic is stupid and should be changed.

Rank 19s who are playing rank 1s
---
It's not that bad, (11 + 17 + 8 + 2) / 4 = 38 / 4 = 10
---
I mean, 1 I don't control the matchmaker, 2 insta-saw isn't a thing, it hasn't been since they reworked tinker friend. Not much of showing off either, just felt like it was a good game and decided to share. For your reference, I have over 2000 in this game. Regardless if you don't think its good then leave a dislike and leave. No need to be an ass about it.
---
2010 movie wasn't too great imo. Arguably, part 3 is the best of all the movies. And part 2 is referred to as "the gayest horror movie ever made"
---
She's so fat
---
262 here PepeHands
---
I normally get between 800 and 860
---
yeah i meant the season rank. Dunno if its good or not
---
Well
---
Because it tests more than the strength of the killer. It's always the same, the killer has a lower skillcap than the survivors, so if you don't understand how the hero is countered you will lose more.
---
Survivors cry for the killer to be nerfed into the ground after 2 days of playing EVERY FUCKING TIME and then people cry because the newly released killers are completely crap after people know how to play against them.
---
The PTB is primarily to gather data on bugs, crashes, whatever gamebreaking things could hide in the code. It's not to throw balance around because people think something is too strong after playing 2-3 times against them. If she is too strong in a few weeks still she will get nerfed.
---
If youre the Killer whack them and then laugh at them. 
---
Nothing can keep the doctor away * laughs in zappity zap *
---
Adrenalin is pretty good, yeah
---
Just to clarify, no, I don't think it's coming out today, this is literally just shit posting to be a goofy ass and all, please don't take it as anything more than that. I'm well aware it could be this week or next week and it usually doesn't take over the subreddit until the day people are expecting release. 
---
Rank 1*
---
I swear by Adrenaline, it has saved my ass so many times. Though if you’re a very immersed player and don’t do a lot of chases it might not be as helpful.
---
I actually really like your idea for slippery meat. It should work like a reverse monstrous shrine where it slows the entity progression. It will really help with randoms not saving you.
---
Yeah I intended for overcharge to work like a reverse brand new part. I'm okay with them adding the overcharge buff but without kicking already regressing gens but even if they don't buff it then at least they should let you kick already regressing gens with the current overcharge and pop goes the weasel 
---
Swf exists
---
Cool story, I'm sure they will be devastated from the loss of you.
---
No terror radius?
---
I try actively to be nice, but really for what, just so one killer dont feel bad and the other 9 of 10 steamroll over me and slugs, camp and tryhard even if the other 3 survs fuck me over and dc? Yeah nah, after two years playing this game I think I pass. I try to maintain positivity through my games and chats but it gets to a point that you just have to stop playing and take a break or being a "good boi survivor" is just out of the equation.
---
Nah probably not then :D Well gonna stream it
---
No one thinks it's hard to get to rank 1
---
I think you're making some good points, but still... If the only "counter" so to speak is slugging people then I don't think that's a good perk to have in the game. Slugging isn't fun for the killer or the survivors, so that's not ideal. Also, the whole 50/50 risk/reward idea makes sense on paper, but in my experience you have to spend a lot of time sabotaging at least a few hooks and then happen to be in the same area as the killer and the survivor and the hook you sabotaged in order to get the pay off. Or you could waste more time not being on gens to follow the killer until they down someone, but again not ideal.
---
To me the perk just isn't that fun. It wasn't fun for killers when things were sabotaged permanently, now the perk barely even does anything (I mean if you want to sabotage just bring a toolbox, the extra 30 seconds hardly does anything). The few times it does work out it's great, but there's still no interesting counter-play. It's kinda like Decisive Strike. You spend all this time chasing someone and then get them to a hook just to drop them on the ground and start a new chase with someone else. It's not as bad because you still have one survivor on the ground, but again, that's not an ideal way to play the game for either side.
---
I've seen every saw movie except the latest one. The first ones weren't that bad tbh
---
It’s easily my favourite perk. You could just level Meg to get it, though. 
---

Welcome to Autohaven, where the totems suck and your precious Ruin *always* dies in the first fifteen seconds! 
---
https://store.steampowered.com/app/17470/Dead_Space/
---
Damn, you found a way to make the least scary looking killer look pretty damn scary. Good shit.
---
I’d want a version where Momma Jason runs after you with a rolling pin and little drowning Jayson crouches at knee length so you topple over. It’s not exactly “canon” per se, but it’s close enough and they’ve taken certain liberties with other licensed killers before. I.e. Freddy being as monstrous as a squirrel. 
---
Yeah, I hate it when I don't have Ed on my team.
---
You are legit ruining the game for all of your teammates. Maybe try changing the hook struggle to your mousewheel or something. 
---
As I said in one of the other comments, in the majority of the clips the survivor had done something earlier in the game to deserve that. Which also explains why they DC is because they can’t take it in return. If you play killer then you’d understand that it happens literally every other game where survivors are disrespectful. Also, what a coincidence that almost every survivor that would DC was a d strike user?
---
The ace that came back for you &lt;3 
---
It’s the best survivor perk imo. 
---
This is so good, it really gives me Fran Bow vibes and i love the way the hair is drawn
---
Which one of you, idiots, is the wooosh kid.
---
Me too
---
I think I have about 100 of this same type of message in my DM from survivors from this last month alone.. even when I’ve never tunneled or camped. Sad
---
Goddamnit, now I need a mod that makes her sound like Roger.
---
"Fucking ninja Megs." - Clown from Peru
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
borrowed time is a really good perk, especially in lower ranks since camping and tunneling is more common
---
That's the beauty of it, his skins could just be the separate movie appearances 
---
Yea a Micheal Myers facecamped me earlier so I’ll switch any thing I should know?
---
Which sucks because Pale Rose is arguably one of Trapper's best maps. I usually require Ruin to buy time for setup, so an early cleanse is the absolute worst. I think it's pretty safe to say as well that shit totem spawns are more common than good ones by at least a 1 to 4 ratio. 
---
Oh ye of little faith
---
when ur a gay nurse player 😔🤪🥰😍🥺
---
I didnt even say she was broken. Half of yall on here have selective reading lmao.
---
&gt;You are legit ruining the game for all of your teammates. Maybe try changing the hook struggle to your mousewheel or something.
---
They ruin the game for me by urban evading around the map so I couldn't care less. 
---
I won't sacrifice any of my hardware because of a stupid mechanic that devs refuse to change. 
---
or you know you can mind your own business
---
For survivors, usually Jakes and dwights are nice. Sometimes I get super toxic Dwights but sometimes I get super noob, cute and friendly Dwights. For killers Mikey is usually really memey and funny
---
F for this franchise. 
---
Really? Huh. No elaboration, aside from, "You were camping"? If you're gonna be a douche at least have some evidence to back it up.
---
thicc cork and solvent should be higher, and while redhead's doesn't mesh with how you usually use your bottles, the mere fact it turns you into a better huntress means it should be higher.
---
Other then that, I agree.
---
Right above doctor. 
---
I don't see you having any ability whatsoever to delete this post. 
---
I disagree. There aren't enough players to split the player-base like that and it will just create longer queue times.
---
I haven't played the game in over a year (cause of trash PC) and I am still that level, lol
---
Ishimura map with 2 floors you can travel on and it's as dark as this game. Only way the lights turn on are by repairing Gens.
---
That is an....interesting way to say get the hag. 
---
Honestly, Nu-Jason would be the best. He actually runs after people.
---
That's literally what the upvote button is for.
---
I do this at least once per game, [for the tickles](https://i.imgur.com/jzTNVIX.png).
---
I was the killer in this. Funny to see it from your pov!
---
shit talking has always been a part of playing games. The way the dude in OP's pic did it wasn't right, but to completely disavow name calling completely is pretty weak.
---
People need to put more effort in their insults. This is just sad.
---
I don't know who this is. My first thought was the President's daughter in Resident Evil 4.
---
I would make it so survivors only need 6 emblems to pip but make it extremely hard to excel in many different areas. As in, you need at least 4-5 safe hook rescues to get iridescent benevolence. This would reward players for performing extremely well in one area more than the current system. I haven't put much thought into this though so I am open to constructive criticism.
---
For looping, just try to mind game. Left right all the time. Also building bloodlust. Bloodlust is your best friend. You could use Spirit Fury and Enduring to reduce how much respect you need for pallets. And focus on keeping the game slow as opposed to tunneling one survivor for 3 or 4 gens. They will come to you with time and the slower the game, the more room for mistakes. Highest rank I've been for killer is 6 so this is the most advice I can give you from a survivor main. Good luck!
---
If you’re good at chases, it’s a good perk
---
I will take longer queue times if it means i actually enjoy playing this game again.
---
And if a casual and competitive split will kill the game, maybe it deserves to die.
---
Neat
---
Are you getting looped on T walls and the likes? Might want to try Bamboozle as a crutch while you get a bit more practice on mind gaming in. Not the best thing ever, but something at least. Rest of the stuff from the person above helps as well.
---
Right? This happened in one of my recent games, and then every survivor dced after they all went down. I was the only one left and then took the killer on a hell of a chase, and lost them. They then proceeded to DC, making me the only person with any points.
---
Hex ruin!!!! Work on your Nurse, Spirit, and soon to be Plague. Tough to 4K with Wraith against good survivors and I would say Doctor is not near the top tier killer list. I main Michael and love him. I think he is the most fun to play against as well. Let's back up a bit as well. Have you played much survivor? I hardly ever played killer til' recently and I'm rank 55 devotion 2 so that is a lot of survivor. Becoming good at survivor taught me a lot and helped me become a great killer. It has become a new game to me and I love it. Good luck and cya in the fog.
---
Her having to charge her puke again is her penalty for messing up, she has a slight slow when charging and after shes used it. She has to waste time trying to fill up your bar, this should give you time to find a loop where you can avoid her puke, hugging walls and such. There are perks that will help against her like dead hard. The best thing you can do against any killer is waste their time and it's easy to waste the plagues time if you dont get caught out in the open, waste all the time you can avoiding the puke and once broken, just treat her as an m1 killer. If she breaks chase to make you go to pool, be smart and go to a pool really out of the way or not near gens. If you hear the noise for her corruption, hide for 30 seconds. Treat her like a t3 Myers then.
---
I just feel she has too much rng with the release of the plague I see no reason to use her over plague and I feel like her power is too out of your hands for her to be very good 
---
I agree, they should repair through ruin, however not everybody is experienced, some think its faster if they try to find Ruin, some people just want to have fun and they dont really care.
---
Maybe you should play with friends that think like you and focus on objectives, because complaining about it won't magically change peoples minds, not everyone goes to youtube, reddit, etc even if you think we are a somehow big community, majority of players are never going to visit these forums.
---
This happens to on PC and PS4, so the best thing you can do is whenever you are not chased work through ruin yourself, then move on to the next gen, some might actually say "Oh that guy made it even with ruin" and eventually adopt that strategy.
---
Good Luck.
---
Even if you’re not, it’s still so useful and needed. I don’t know how people play without it. Can’t imagine getting hooked before the last gen pops and not having full health afterwards. 😬

finding the "farmer john" channel on youtube. if u like noob&lt;3 then u will love fj. 
---
I'll give it a try if I have free time. I had all the time as a kiddo 😔
---
Yes, sometimes the RNG can fuck you over but she can stall the game like a monster. Even with the RNG, I’d still say she’s better than Wraith because her dash can help with loops. 
---
I play a good amount of survivor, rank 13 last time I checked. Sadly I cannot do Spirit or Plague due to money issues, and Im not sure about Nurse. I am on console, which makes it a lot more difficult to play her. 
---
The cars in autohaven can fucking blow me for all I care. Even with mind games that shit is impossible.
---
Same. I'm rank 1 and died time after time last night (maybe 8 or 9 times) while trying to do survivor dailies and I still didn't depip. It seems a bit broken and from the way I was playing I'm not sure why I should be at rank 1 (I played like shit). 
---
[The kids, probably.](https://i.imgur.com/cackgC6.gifv)
---
The wraith can do the exact same thing on loops though and the wraith has amazing map pressure with any tier of windstorm and I have really bad luck with rng so I tend to use all my traps at the end game 
---
Huntress can turn pallets and windows into death sentences, and she doesn’t even need perks like Spirit fury, Enduring, and Brutal Strength because you rarely ever destroy pallets or get stunned. I’m still tweaking the tier list so this is a rough draft. 
---
Part 6 was always my favourite version. That when he gets resurrected by lightning and becomes an even more unstoppable force. I’d like to see his special power be something like an alternate weapon that randomly changes. He’s used so many different weapons through all the movies, would be a cool way to implement those different weapons. So use the power and you get a spear, then activate it another time and it’s a pitchfork and it just changes randomly.
---
Exactly! I play a game to relax and forget about the stress I have during the day. When it gets the point that the game is MAKING me stressed, it’s time for a break. I love Dead By Daylight, don’t get me wrong. I have about 1000 hours and don’t intend to abandon it, but sometimes I need to take a vacation from it.

In the pigs case why not play the plague because she gets insta down vomit
---
Also I didn't mention that wraith can bodyblock like a god with his cloak which let's him shut down powerful windows 
---
Both are very different perks. Bonds effect is also a lot more consistent than Self Cares. I would use perks that always have an effect, no requirements for them to work.
---
I mean, I love Legion to begin with. Im just playing other killers to get him better perks. Nurse, Im not sure if shes good on console.

She chants while holding corrupt purge, and she says shit in Sumerian when she lands a basic attack hit. Not to mention she's the only killer that speaks in general. That's enough I think. Let the Huntress be unique with her passive song, chanting would get old very quick 
---
No, the joke is he is rank 20. You can't woosh someone when they didn't miss a joke
---

---
Here’s one for juking 
---
He can bodyblock, but that doesn’t help during a chase. Pig can still stall better than him and his invisibility isn’t as good as pig’s. 
---
Also, plague can’t stall the game and she’s not nearly as fun as pig imo, so I’ll stick with pig. 
---
to be fair, the first 2 are really good, both have that plot twist no one expects, while after that its just gore porn
---
Self Care always. 
---
People like to pretend like transit time isn't a thing when it comes to group heals, and being able to heal yourself at any time allows for more opportunities to successfully complete the heal undetected.
---
Both of you have a point. However I think that with Selfcare, you need to be chased for a certain amount of time in order to be worth it don't you think? The extra benefit of Selfcare also only helps against a Freddy, where you can just injure yourself.
---
With bond however, you can always see teammates from a certain distance, wether they're injured or not. However you rely on them to heal you and the time for you to search for a teammate and than be healed can be far longer than with Selfcare.
---
Lifeisxo, you mentioned that you don't need to heal immidiately. But doesn't healing yourself and taking another extra hit give you more benefit than walking around for a solid two minutes (if you're doing a gen first anyways) in the inujred state?
---
It is incredibly obvious as killer the difference between groups who understand that and those that don’t.
---
Several chases and still 5 gens vs one chase and 2-3 gens done.
---
You've played so much that you don't know what you're talking about, because you've lost sight of why people actually play the game. The majority of people don't care about hours, or ranks, they play to have fun, and if being scared and immersed is fun for them so be it. That's why you're getting downvoting. Dictating how others have fun ruins a game. 
---
So you'd choose Bond? What do you run if I may ask, do you even run a perk for healing in general or do you rely on finding teammates when injured? 
---
I’m the same, I mostly play billy because, well it’s billy. But sometimes I get the most ridiculous chainsaws like through trees and barrels so I leave them on the floor, not gonna hook someone because hit boxes are inconsistent as fuck.
---
What a gem of a subreddit
---
Imo Selfcare takes too long to heal without a medkit, so I used to run bond. Now I run Aftercare instead. 
---
Tell him, "You are a killer Survivor!"
---
His body blocking means he can block off notorious windows and safe pallets which will gueantee a hit if you play it right also pig can stall wraith can't but wraith can map pressure while pig can't which is imo more important and plague does stall the game with her vomit forcing you to go to a fountain 2hich she can infect and use to get basically an insta down 
---
I hated the wraith until I played with windstorm addons. Also spooky wraith is a fun build too.
---
Without addons or with weak addons he’s not too fun IMO.
---
But in the later game Killers often run Sloppy Butcher. Doesn't Bond give you more benefit than? Since people heal you much more faster than you healing yourself when hit by Sloppy Butcher and you see teammates. Isn't it more consistent? 
---
Selfcare is indeed very nice, but in the higher ranks I am noticing that I have rounds where I am just sitting in a corner and healing and healing and healing. 
---
tHaTs n0t uR rAnK r/w0o0sH
---
She is good, but just very hard to use especially on  console
---
Many people would argue it is the second best survivor perk(behind decisive strike).
---
Because people also play killer and it can be very boring to try and look for people on the dark map, also its a bit big.
---
Killers are on a time limit. Not survivors.
---
 Bond 100%. One moment, I have a link somewhere...
---
That would be nice except for the fact that bodyblocking doesn’t always work. You rely heavily on survivors mistakes and that’s something that doesn’t work that well in high ranks. 
---
Nah M&amp;A stays.
---
If you think there are better perks you could use then you don’t have to use either. I use to run bond but It made me die more for some reason (probably b/c I relied on it too much). I swapped both for dead hard and it’s 1000x better. Most of the time if you’re in a chase they won’t give up until your dead, so no point in finding a way to heal in that situation. On the off chance you do get away damaged you can just go to a generator and avoid the killer until someone comes to you. If that doesn’t happen and the killer finds you, you can use dead hard to extend the chase for a bit. I’ve also noticed that when you’re in the injured state you almost have a 99% chance of finding a medkit, which saves you the perk slot and gives you the free item. If you have to choose between the 2 perks though I’d say bond. I have died so many times because people won’t bother saving you until they’ve wasted all there time self-caring and it drives me nuts. Nothing more frustrating then watching someone’s aura in the “crouched healing position” for 1000 years while you’re struggling.
---
People underestimate the power of kindred. Always have. Though sometimes my team manages to fuck up even when I have kindred on 
---
......no obviously not but are you trying to say there’s endless of time for survivors to do objectives and them dying/consistently getting hooked doesn’t factor in the time limit that you apparently think survivors don’t have?  
---
Wow that’s a nice thing
---
No one can really answer if having cosmetics means enough to you as a player to have them.  
---
Yeah exactly, but it does also take a lot of time to find someone even with bond. You're running around looking for a teammate which takes time and they need to fix you and that time can be used for them to fix a gen. Do you think Bond cancels out the negatives of Selfcare with these things? 
---
How many full heals can you pull of with an average Kit, 2? Isn't that a bit on the fewer side? 
---
I’m sorry I don’t have as fast reflexes as you dude, can’t always hit great skills checks and the way it always goes for me when I try to power through is I always get found by the killer and can never make it back to that gen afterwards. 
---
Ok. I've actually been getting pretty good with Tue Plague. She's SOO much run!
---
Well you don't always need to heal yourself, if you know where someone is just go over to them.
---
5 years is a lot! But with the effort they're putting into this game this year I am not surprised: Better matchmaking, dedicated servers, more effort into killers and survivors, adding a second objective!
---
The Legion only killed one man. They were a bunch of young adults who went around burglarizing and vandalizing. 
---
Nice.
---
I agree on the part that DS was broken and needed a rework not only because of the complaints, but since NOED is definitely not as balanced as I(and really half of the community and BHVR itslef) would like to see, it probably is going to get reworked anyway. Also the number of complaints about NOED way outnumbers the number of complaints about something as something like the amount of traps on the trapper.
---
Just got rank 1 on Killer for the first time, without your tips and the videos you linked I would have never been able to achieve that, thank you so much again!
---
Haha you're right. It's just that some survivors like David and Nea are just so goddamn awful by base design xD While having the outfits make them look considerable better. In a game where you look at your character all the time, it's worth it imo to just buy a few clothings here and there. 
---
NOED is a perfectly fine perk. It leaves the user with 3 perks only for 90% of the game in most cases, as well maybe not even being activated. 
---
I mean sure NOED can feel like a cheap way to win, especially if all 4 survivors are alive till the end and all and the killers isn't that good or being out skilled and then BOOM all 4 die thx to NOED. But think of it this way, a survivor is on a gen ,doing it ASAP and once it is done they run over to another gen, and they spot a totem, if the survivor doesn't cleanse the totem it is their fault that NOED is activated, you cannot blame the killer for using NOED if you are letting it activate. Your basically giving the killer a bullet and then being mad because they brought a gun. Just like DS, NOED can be abused by bad players to make up for the lack of skill. As of the current state of the game, gems are being done to fast, perks like ruin doesn’t buy you a lot of time. So what is a good solution to a group of players doing the objective ASAP and getting out. *Spoiler alert*, it’s NOED. I don’t get how survivors can get mad at the killer for using a perk that they can just disable. If there is even the slightest chance that the killer might have NOED why are you not cleansing totems? NOED isn’t a baby perk, ofc weaker players can use it. In reality the survivors are the babies, for not cleansing totems. This is the main thing with NOED, survivors have a very easy way of not getting fucked over by it. If the killer runs NOED and gets you, it is not his fault, it is your fault cause you are the baby survivor.
---
That’s the thing. When you’re injured and don’t immediately see anyone close by after losing the killer, then just get on a gen for a bit while injured. It won’t take long for another survivor to come around so you can go to them to get healed. 
---
Freddy needs a rework,legion just gotta be deleted.
---
It really is a breath of fresh air when you meet other players that are just people trying to have fun and not just bully a killer or 4k every game. I have actually seen a lot more of this in the last week. I don't know why, and I'm not complaining. I'm just enjoying it while it lasts.
---
... no lol that's a very twisted view. let me guess..killer main? 
---
Good
---
I just hate getting bloodlusted by her, it sucks not being able to gain distance by her vomiting on you and waiting for the 'Broken' status effect.
---
it used to be both massive, and at least on some systems, really taxing for no good reason
---
example being on my old AMD powered system i think it just force crashed on Medium or above, only map that did it, but i believe they fixed that a while back.
---
I like the map nowadays, at least Pale rose, not a massive fan of Pantry myself
---
I miss being scared when I played this game lol. When I first started it was terrifying when I heard that heart beat getting closer.
---
Ok but on other maps like The Game or Lery's the spawns are always garbage for Survs great for killers so it pretty much balances out
---
They introduced a new scoring system in the ptb but it's super broken. A 3 man is a depip and a perfect game is a no pip.
---
Is this new concept art for pig costume 
---
It's about surviving. It sounds cruel and very egoistic but at the end of the they it is all about you.
---
What about the screamers from the evil within 2?
---
I'll be the first to admit that the numbers probably need some changing, so I totally understand what you're saying here. The detection perk element could definitely be removed. The goal is to have The Legion use Feral Frenzy, and be able to get that first hit in. The chapter is "Darkness Among Us", and I think this fits the theme. Upon using Feral Frenzy, The Legion changes to the 0 stack stats, and is able to hit (and not tunnel) that first survivor. Once the first survivor is hit, the stats greatly change as they now have 1 stack. Your Terror Radius gets larger and larger with each hit, incentivizing you to find that next survivor and continue to gain stacks of Feral Frenzy.   
---
Nirvana's name could be changed to something else more suiting to the action, haha. I was trying to find something that fit the themes of troubled youth. I re-edited the post to better explain Nirvana. Essentially, once the screen gets covered red after chasing a survivor with Deep Wounds, the killer screen is essentially flash lighted. They must use Nirvana to clear their view, and they could go about this by whatever means. I thought they would slow their movement speed down akin to The Clown refilling his bottles. Perhaps they use their free hand to clear their eyes, or menacing take a deep breath while appreciating the moment, removing the blood-lust. Perhaps each skin has a different way of doing this? 
---
Oh definitely-mass murder is still kinda hard to justify. But he had a reason for killing those people, he didn't just do it because he liked it. That's why the Entity had to torture him before he submitted.
---
Lmao what? I was just telling you it's a he.
---
I play all sides and have Devotion LVL 29 so I’ve seen my fair share of toxicity on both sides. T.TV is a good bet that they’re toxic asshats most of the time.
---
Good survivors might not always get out, but they will almost always win.
---
It's true, and it doesn't matter because survivors have the means to end the game quickly.
---
M&amp;A is trash
---
Just cause a lot of people complain doesn't mean they have to change it. And we shouldn't give survivors more info. That would just make SWF even more brain dead
---
- Your Opinion
---
It was out of their hands though. New Line own the rights to Freddy, and the only version of Freddy which can be used now is remake Freddy (they mentioned this in a dev stream way back). They basically said how they really wanted to use OG Krueger but just couldn’t (hence why they didn’t even use remake Nancy- she was nowhere near as good as original Nancy they said).
---
I enjoy a bit of friendly shit talk. But it seems everyone is malicious in this game.
---
Top 10 Photos Taken Moments Before Disaster
---
Rank 181 here, it’s seems ever since my very first game I’ve got worse and worse :P
---
I barely play with/against any that don't DC
---
This is every game for me as survivor, even at rank 10. But as killer, it's the exact opposite, which is probably why my killer rank is still 15.
---
The fuck they are. Sit through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05lLvRTddLE&amp;list=PLfKEeuOdJJrPtPYtiKvUajWVCFXmNtMkI) and tell me with a straight face that those devs know what they're doing.
---
With a straight face. I'll *pay* you.
---
Yeah, the Clown is a swell guy to be around. As are the Legion now that I think about it.
---
Well yeah it puts a little risk into it. I’d say the reward of optimizing your time by finding the gen in the immediate area rather than running the map to get healed, unless you’re death hook then that’s different. Just think of it this way, if you lose the killer or are unhooked and the killer isn’t immediately on you then that means the killer is likely patrolling elsewhere or is chasing somebody else. You’ll have enough time to finish the gen and find a survivor to heal you in most cases
---
Yup. Once things stop going their way, they DC to avoid issues with their streaming crowd.
---
man, wish i were that good lmfao
---
&gt;Ok but on other maps like The Game or Lery's the spawns are always garbage for Survs great for killers so it pretty much balances out
---
I agree that those two maps can be annoying to find totems but for the absolute majority of maps (also counting just **15** from 3 original maps), totems spawns are shit. 
---
Seriously though, I would like to take a moment and emphasize just how much a user experience nightmare all of those numbers are. I mean you have 3 forms of progression alone. Character level, skill rank level, and devotion level. Plus the three currencies all being conflated together by being put in the same area. This as a UI is a nightmare for new people to understand. 
---
If it discourages stealth tell me why all the randos at rank 1 are p3 claudettes that urban evade to gens and hide in lockers when they hear a heartbeat. Rank 1 survivors are the new rank 15 and I hate it. 
---
What was his reason apart from liking it? He seemed pretty happy about it.
---
&gt;Yeah but tbf to BHVR they have been changing totem spawn locations and parameters every update for the last few
---
They say that in patch notes but when you look at the changes in-game, they still spawn in the same tilesets, just with a prop in front of them or closer to a corner so you need to get closer in order to actually see the totem. 
---
NoED is a valid counter to the current survivor meta of 'Just rush gens, fuck everything else'. 
---
I don't care who says it's a crutch perk.  Running into a 4-man SWF with meta perks and toolboxes, generators are popped in 4 minutes. 
---
That's incredibly boring for a killer as you may get one to two chases in and then you get boned.  
---
The way things are now, the game feels less like a horror movie, and more like four friends going to a forest/swamp/cornfield/asylum/haddonfuckingfield and running into some supposedly terrifying supernatural killer and calling him/her a wanker why they speed rush gens. 
---
NOED is s necessary evil. 
---
Highest I ever got was 891. Just start mashing the moment you are hooked.
---
M&amp;A is one of Legion's best perks, he already has a smaller terror radius, so you can get way closer to people before they realize, and once you do start stabbing people, your terror radius is larger, so you can see further with Killer Instinct. 
---
Noed is fine. 
---
Ppl are gonna think your like a goth murderer lol
---
&gt;normally
---
Does no one ever unhook you?
---
I've played a total of like 3 games as a killer so far and every single time I've been flamed and BMd lol. Not a great first impression so far
---
Platform and name?
---
But quite unbreakable 
---
they don't dc whilst live lul that's so incorrect they do it when they aren't live because their viewers won't moan and cause them toxic for disconnecting. this is toxic streamers, we're talking about.
---
but in the context of this meme they said they play legion and use moonwalking / looking down because they want them to DC. that's way more toxic lol
---
Yeah, it's sad. Sometimes I bring a secret offering that ISN'T  a mori and they still dc. Also some claim you're stream sniping because of their injured breathing or you see them behind a tree.
---
Then the ones who use 4 cancer meta perks and are like "omg this killer is bad" (im talking to you too non ttvs) Not my fault all your perks are the annoying meta ones and I can't do anything to kill you. If it's just Adrenaline or just DS or both? sure. But selfcare, sprint burst, adrenaline, and DS and then you complain and cry when killer tries to counter that stuff with NOED, dribbling, nurse's, etc?  You're the bad one.
---
I don't have problem with anyone bringing a mori to kill the ttv. Same with looking at the ttvs stream. There isn't a problem with it. I've had a ttv (who sometimes dcs) say there's no problem with stream sniping. The ones who dc when things go wrong think they have "streamer privileges"
---
 
---
A big problem with this whole thing is survivor mentality. It’s not uncommon for someone to loop the killer for 3-4 gens. But then they respond with o that only happens cuz the killer is bad. Then they get smacked and dc and they cry op here. They never accept responsibility for fault 
---
&gt;Top 10 Photos Taken Moments Before Disaster
---
hahah
---
If this was a billy or nurse, sure, I was most likely doomed. A legion? Poor guy. 
---
Yeah I got red in my first season and was very uncomfortable with that fact. Like "no, but I suck..."
---
Happened yesterday. Match starts, someone spawn near ruin and cleans it, trapper was there, downs him, and then before reaching the hook he downs someone else who was in the middle. He hooks one, then the other. The other one gets unhooked 2sec later, but trapper hit the unhooker, down him and hook. The one escaped got caught into a trap and downed (add-on).
---
ALL THIS in 1:24min, I recorded the match.
---
It doesn't always work but it works a lot and it's very reliable and consistent when you know how to use it
---
&gt;a killer leaves you because the timer of the game is ticking down and your too much of a liability to pursue, or you escape the chase because the killer loses track of you due to their own tracking skills.
---
That's skill expression right there. You are better than the killer so much that they can't even keep up with you and they need to leave you. That's how you can escape the chase, by being better than them. Giving you an easy escape button is taking that skill expression away.
---
The killer is a butt monkey only when they are bad. The killer is the power role.
---
It's preference, and be weary - if you learn how to aim with shadowborn you'll have a lot of trouble aiming again without it.
---
The extra fov affects things.
---
Yes it is toxic, and you're quite the asshole.
---
Survivor would be too easy if your teammates were alright. 
---
It's not the greatest ever, but quite fun when you pull it off right. Why waste time uncloaking when you can spread that pallet and uncloak?
---
Yup same
---
Idk what survivors you’re getting for bodyblocking to work all the time but that doesn’t work much of at all. 
---
I love how OP got a bunch up up votes and isn't even rank 1 and is actually rank 20.
---
I am not saying they were excused? I'm pointing out that gen tapping is an awful habit and the they should have searched for ruin. 
---
I had a game where we got absolutely crushed, was still fair, no tunneling or camping and post game the survivor who did the best used the hard r on the killer. Some people are just such toxic dirt bags I swear
---
Even though he has an instadown, he can still be looped and isn’t a good killer for reasons that everyone has explained before. 
---
Wait..  that's illegal
---
prepare to hate ur life
---
No I didnt, he’s by spirit. 
---
I would pay $100 for Santa Clown cosmetic if I needed to
---
I think I'm actually getting pretty good with her. Idk how she will be changed with the balance update, though. Probably not much of a change,
---
I fully expect that mindset when someone's on their last hook, and I'm fine with it. Everyone should want to get the most BP they can.
---
When it's done first hook of the game, it's stupid. You end up getting the rest of the team killed, and there's only so much BP you can earn alone.
---
The reason I put him so high is that a good trapper can severely fuck you up. 
---
Is legion really that strong or is he just a troll/ meme pick? I can never tell.
---
It seems everyone likes her for the most part, but like I said I don’t really like her kit too much. 
---
You stupid stupid little Child that is level one you are rank 20
---
I've been curious to see how well NOED would do if they removed the exposed status, but massively increased the movement speed bonus. If done right, it could potentially remove some of the BS of going against NOED, while still remaining a strong perk.
---
Thanks for sharing. 
---
What do you mean by kit?
---
The killer was being toxic first for playing legion, so teabagging was actually justified. 
---
I am -1 NoT yes Dudw RAM
---
I know it’s you Noob3, you can’t fool me
---
Yeah, just noticed. I was tired when I typed it and barely had my eyes open
---
Her power. It’s just not for me, similar to how Nurse isn’t for me because I don’t find her fun. 
---
Fair enough 
---
As a killer I hate it because if I'm up against people who want to hide for twenty minutes and wait to see who gets hatch I don't really have much choice but to waste 5-7 minutes playing hide and seek. (Although Whispers definitely helps when I happen to run it)
---
As a survivor (and I don't play too much survivor so this could be lack of experience) there just don't seem to be reliable pallets anywhere and I'm NOT a blendette main--mainly because I know how frustrating that is to play against--so if I'm found it's pretty much run to three pallet spawns I'm familiar with (jungle gym, shack, and then whatever the main building is) and hope that my team-mates are doing gens. Pro-tip, they're usually not, because they're trying to find ruin, which is nigh impossible unless it spawns on the first floor of the two story building.
---
How far into the game was it? Sometimes if the game’s going incredibly badly for the survivors I’ll let one go. If the survivor was leading the huntress to you or stuff like that then the survivor is 100% toxic but you also mentioned the huntress wanted to team with you - so who would you two team against? 
---
It sounds like she was going easy on you and when you just wanted to play normal without mercy she went full on for you (And not the other person because mercy). Depends on what ‘teaming’ here was. As I said if the other person was helping the huntress instead of the huntress just leaving the other person alone. Of course I’m assuming this was happening later in the match and not from the start. If it was from the start then yes that’s toxic no matter what they did
---
Ok. I like her power because it is disgusting. Somehow that appeals to me. The Nurse's power seems pretty good if you know how to play her.
---
&gt;I've been curious to see how well NOED would do if they removed the exposed status, but massively increased the movement speed bonus. If done right, it could potentially remove some of the BS of going against NOED, while still remaining a strong perk.
---
It would be even more boring to play against. As a survivor you can still loop a NOED killer, is just harder because of his small speed buff. If they had a **massive** speed buff, they would just bloodlust you around a pallet and there is little survivors can do. 
---
Nah dude, she THICC!
---
Starting to think the moderation of this sub is selective because I've seen a few people post gifs/images that weren't inherently Dead by Daylight and they were removed, but this makes it to "hot".
---
America explain
---
He did it to protect/please his father. In the lore, there's no mention of him enjoying that act, but it definitely got the Entity's attention, which shaped him into a sadistic killer that he is now.
---
I like killer’s that are really fun to play and Nurse just isn’t fun. Plague seems nice but I don’t like her power. 
---
What is the checkmark in your description and how did you do it?
---
Been playing 20 hours a day since launch.
---
I thought they were bots my bad
---
Are you joking? I hope you are.
---
Yeah and it’s always before the killer even has the chance to turn and go away, as if the other survivor thinks that you die on hook in 10 seconds and the killer won’t notice them run up
---
I've had other survivors flame me for doing trash when I started playing. I've had trash killers call me a crybaby when I said they should get better internet. Both sides are equally as toxic but you see more toxicity from survs because the game is a 4v1 and the 4 is survivors
---
What are you talking about? It says rank 1 right there! 
---
devotion lvl 29 still isn't what you'd call "experienced" so idk why you flexin. what i meant was you don't know who that streamer is, what if they're just a friendly person that likes sharing their gameplay with friends? it's so rude and unfair to do that just because they stream. but bear in mind I'm not talking about if you want to mori them, that's no big deal. it's in the context of purposely abusing legion's faulty mechanucs just to get a reaction out of them. grow up people
---
Hardly a woooosh, I saw the sarcasm and chose to ignore it. Spastic 
---
At the time it’s probably really frustrating for the killer - you’re pushing their buttons in a way. So of course they want to focus you and teach you a lesson. I’m sure it’s a good feeling once they get you. As long as you have fun and nice or let them know you had fun after instead of mean later, I think it resolves the toxicness of it from that match. Others use it just to be plan toxic though. 
---
Yes please
---
Well, to each their own.
---
I finally got rank 1 survivor last weekend. I’ve been basically trying to sacrifice myself to help my team mates as much as possible to derank. So tired of playing against Hillbilly, and Nurse every match. Matches went from being fun to straight up head aches. Glad I got the achievement though 
---
Hahaha yeah I've heard it's not fun. I only wanted it for the achievement anyway because I want to 100% the game.
---
It’s a well known fact that playing legion is a reportable offence OP should’ve flagged them 
---
Lots of fun. Puppers does it as well, and it’s crazy with rank 1 killer he always steam rolls people. He’s damn good and has fun at the same time. 
---
well, I've yet to have one dc from mine and I played the beta. though obviously some would so I've probably just been lucky. 
---
Holy shit really? Can you link me to a video or his channel please?
---
i believe so, you can confirm if a token is added to the perk 
---
Imagine if the plague running it finds a group of survivors and gets them all with her special
---
It does
---
git gud
---
Legion is not really that "Strong" as you'll be able to genrush him with a split up co-ordinated team. The problem is that he is very annoying to play against. If the Legion is not a complete newbie you will be guaranteed to go down eventually while he's chasing you. The other point is that the Legion has no counte play, the only trick you can do is vault back thru a window you just vaulted to confuse him. It is just a braindead character. And this is coming from a killer main.
---
whos gonna tell him?? anyone?
---
Yeah I know what the issue was with og Freddy but BHVR isn't exactly notorious for making good decisions are they? 
---
should have had spine chill 
---
LOLOL
---
lol having meta perks doesn't mean you can't kill them, you just aren't experienced enough. i mean that in the most brutally honest way possible. survivors used to be broken af, now after a bunch of nerfs, they're way more balanced. Just running meta perks isn't the reason you can't kill them, but I agree that using meta perks ia gross. Y'all meta perk users are boring af I change my perk build daily to weekly and rarely use Self Care. 
---
Poor Freddy my ass lol

If you're being toxic thanatophobia is better. Thanatophobia, ruin, M&amp;A, bloodhound
---
Or if you really want to use M&amp;A T
---
Jokes aside, getting to rank 1 as survivor is ridiculously easy, I'm rank 1 and I consider myself dead average survivor
---
&gt; survivors seem to forget that gens win matches
---
I don't think survivors forget, but players want bloodpoints, and altruism (more specifically unhooking) rewards a ton of bloodpoints (at least by survivor standards). Due to this, the game indirectly encourages survivors to forego the main objective and go save your teammate before someone else does to get those juicy bloodpoints. If you have WGLF, it encourages this behaviour further. 
---
Obviously BHVR wouldn't want to make unhooking less rewarding, because then players would just sit and sap bloodpoints out of gen in peace and quiet, but it's also kind of wonky that you almost have to compete with your teammates to get unhooks. Maybe it would be an idea to add a 'teamwork' bloodpoint pool where a certain amount of bloodpoints gained from teamwork related tasks (such as unhooking) get pooled into and then shared at the end of the game (how many points and how even they should be distributed could vary). This might help to discourage *farming* other survivors.
---
Or they could rework the bloodweb so it isn't tremendously grindy for no good reason, but that's probably not gonna happen.
---
p3 but with the last red helm :D
---
Maybe his father should’ve been the killer.
---
good'ol copy and paste ✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓
---
I agree that helm does look pretty nice
---
He's strong. This sub won't admit it, you will hear him being called "unfun". But yeah, he's strong. You can escape a match if the player sucks. But if he is decent, he will destroy you.
---
Halloween made doing basic things like locking the door cool again!!
---
I'm not.  I'm just saying you shouldn't steal other people's work.  The problems been resolved anyways so nobody needed your output.
---
idk i’m pretty dumb sorry
---
Thickness powaaa
---
On top of that, add a killer randomizer
---
Winning &gt; Juking, getting downed, failing ds/juggled to hook, DC like an angry pussy bitch. 
---
This is actually really true, and I feed it’s pretty off putting to newer players 
---
If you prestigex3 Claudette, you have a 90% chance the killer will dodge,especially if you’re lower rank and you carry a flashlight
---
It's a joke dude, Chill. 
---
no its really really hard. you have to be either extremely good or youre gonna lose
---
The first thing they need to do is change Self Care skill checks to give Survival instead of Altruism. Also I feel like escaping a chase should go to Survival instead of Boldness.
---
I like your ideas too. The category could really do with more ways to earn.
---
On the other side of this post, I have a friend who does generators all game long. Usually the killer just won't go over by where he's at or usually me and the other 2 survivors will be getting chased throughout the match and doing generators when we're not. Not sure why but when the final generator finishes, he usually gets caught or is the one being chased when the final one pops. We all know that's the worst time to be chased cause the killer usually won't leave you. However, when he gets hooked he starts going off about how the rest of the team did nothing. It still suprises me that he thinks doing the generator is the "hard" part of the game
---
This is brilliant.
---
Excuse me, go to the back of the line for your autograph please.
---
Never underestimate the power of Megathan.
---
This is the cap.
---
The thing that most legion player don't seem to understand is the way to play him.
---
Most Legion player think that his gameplay is about tunneling ONE survivor in frenzy until he's down and then repeat until everyone's dead.
---
And yes it sometimes guarantee a kills. However, I think that the proper way to use it (to slow the game down, forcing survivors to waiste time healing themselves instead of doing gens) is simply to pick a survivor, go into frenzy, you hit him ONCE to activate the bleed state or whatever it's called and then you leave him to go chase ANOTHER nearby survivor usiing your ability that let you see their heartbeat, breathing or something, you hit him too, then you find another one, you hit him in frenzy and you repeat.
---
The point isn't to down someone as easily as possible but to keep everyone occupied by forcing them to heal to THEN hitting normaly the last survivor you've chased to down him and put him on the hook.
---
That way you have someone on the hook and you go and start chasing people again, they wil be too busy healing themselves and saving each other to repair gens as fast as usual.
---
And yes this is totally the same way of playing it as Tru3ta1ent wich is (in my opinion) THE optimal way of playing him and where the true strenght of this killer is.
---
For short: 
---
1) You look for survivors doing a gen, 
---
2) you go in frenzy, 
---
3) you hit all of them as much as possible, 
---
4) and when your frenzy end, you pick the last survivors you chased, 
---
5) you hit him normally to down him, 
---
6) you put him on a hook.
---
7) Repeat.
---
Any recommendations?
---
I'm just waiting  for the r/dbdgonewild posts
---
BBQ , TOTH, DIS
---
I'd suggest trying to get to survivor rank 1. Just make that your goal and play with friends and you can watch the killers there and learn from them. I am a survivor main, and I hardly ever touch killer, but after learning what all the rank 1 killers do and trying to reproduce that I can get down to around rank 9 with killer
---
NOED isnt a broken perk, it only feels cheap because of its "gotcha!" value. Survs are blind sided by the exposed status which basically guarantees the killer at least one down. I think NOED wouldnt be nearly as broken if survs just left the fuckin game after they see that NOED is active. The number of times Ive watched a surv go back into the game after opening a gate to either try and get the cleanse points or unhook someone while NOED is active is pretty high. In most cases NOED wouldnt even be worth the slot for the one or two free downs you get, except that survs are pretty reliably overly altruistic, which gives more opportunities to use it.
---
Am I even more shit or is it hard to play nurse with one brain cell
---
It is harder yes.
---
Maybe your shit too I don't know.
---
Maybe both.
---
Dead hard is also really viable indeed!
---
I mean.... 
---
Do you? 
---
You've completed the game 
---
Considering there are people with Level 50 devotion, I hardly feel like my gaming history should be called into question. Plus I was unemployed for about a year lol
---
Fair enough. If you don’t believe I’ve gotten that many messages then I don’t believe you’re getting consistent 3k/4k’s or you’d be getting them too. You’re bound to go up against salty SWFs every couple of games
---
Heard the mh751/52 are way better than cloud 2 is old now, the alphas are also better but ear cups are uncomfortable, SHP9500 /V MODA etc
---
Where is he whining?
---
Rank 13-15 survivor here. 
---
Is it really worth it? All Ive seen from the internet is long waiting for matches and the same survivors and killers over and over who run the same perks as everyone else,
---
No, I've tried it it's really hard
---
Tinkerer Billy can be surprisingly scary
---
I am also very shit 
---
As a survivor it doesn’t do anything,but as legion you’re not considered chasing someone,so their timer goes down
---
im a gen jockey meg main myself 😔 if i do get in chases right as theyre done i try 2 do a gen
---
I think that one of The Plague's perks, Corrupt Intervention, could stealthly buff The Trapper in a weird way. Making it so that 3 gens are not able to be touched for two minutes might just give enough time for The Trapper to set up some of his traps and not get genrushed to death. that perk could also apply to The Hag.
---
but regardless of that, i do agree that what you said is a buff that he really needs. hopefully the devs are working on something like that.
---
Did you know what was happening at the time? Was it actually any different for you?
---
I bet you they are doing this new hard ranking system on PTB so they can introduce some kind of incentive that would otherwise cost them money.
---
Are you on PC or console? 
---
I do know that some of the killers were given to PS4 for free, namely doctor and hag.
---
You forgot Frank's Mixtape + Cold Dirt 
---
PS4. Interesting.
---
Advice to my fellow survivors on pc. Swap the control to mousewheel down. Then you can just spin the mousewheel and it’s why less annoying then mashing a keyboard button
---
HOLY SHIT I was going to comment the exact same thing
---
That's really cool. It's probably just a present or PS plus thing that you received. Nice I got to check my dbd out.
---
I hope thats actually a thing. Dont forget what dailys are for. Its not a challenge, its to get people to log in and give a simple feeling of being rewarded for you to associate with it so you keep playing.
---
Hell it's better than smelling like gucci mane belly button
---
That's what the downvote button is for!
---
Read it again.
---
It’s good advice up until your teammates leave you on the hook, you end up dying on the first hook even though you had tier 3 kindred and the killer was across the map.
---
So first off. As a trapper main. I like the idea of a trapper buff but your reason of "these other trap users have this"
---
Pig traps don't notify and cause an injury state. They kill you after x time. It's a way to keep you off gens. 
---
Hag traps? Hag is slow as fuck and her traps are the only thing that makes her a competitive threat. Much like how the nurse is slow af but has a tp.
---
Hag can be countered by flashlight/crouching. Trapper can be countered by just paying attention to the map and a toolbox. 
---
Trapper exelent at zoning. If he started with all traps on person. Jesus Christ. He could just lock down 3 gens until the end of time. 
---
While I do think that he needs a buff. I don't think it's as easily done as you would think. I think with the plague coming out her anti gen rush mechanic will greatly help trapper. Meta shifts usually do. 
---
Can we talk about Tattoo's middle finger for a second? Picture this: Haddonfield. I'm a level 15 Meg that has nothing to camouflage herself with, which makes the following shitshow even worse. Killer is a clown with Tattoo's Middle Finger.  
---
Four gens in and he got NOTHING done. 1 kill, maybe three or four hooks total. I'm chilling out in someone's house, molesting a gen. I'm almost done when Big Chungus walks in, I hide behind the wall and pretend to be a particularly ugly armchair. Big Boye pays me no mind, kicks the generator and somehow jumps through the window without taking out the frame as a bold fashion statement slash hulahoop. I jump right back on the gen and finish it within seconds, the terror radius is still blaring. Thus begins the shitshow.  
---
I yeet myself out the window, a bottle yeets itself inside. I somehow don't ed up shitfaced - literally - and crouch behind the bushes. Thiccums is on a mission though, he throughs a fucking bottle after a bottle inside, hoping to flush out the perpetrator, I'm sitting in the bush, fucking gazing at this scene, enchanted, Jake's out here waving towards the exit door, Nea's t-bagging behind his back, it's a whole fucking another level of mess. I'm confused, Chubbykin's confused, we're all fucking confused.   
---
And then we left him lol.
---
&gt; Devotion LVL 29
---
Is.. is that good?
---
I main trapper and I feel like he is fine. The trick is to place traps in locations that are not obvious. Another trick I use is placing traps at pallets that have already been thrown. The only real buff id give him is his carry limit default and starting default.
---
I absolutely agree. I think the Trapper is still balanced for the early era of the game, back when most players didn't know the basics, let alone the more advanced tech out there. The Trapper feels like an old man trying to keep up with these new young killers.
---
The reason why I ask is because I seek an alternitave for healing, not just a good build.
---
Corrupt Intervention is great for all killers that lack map pressure, namely M1 killers like leatherface or Myers.
---
So happy to see another killer generator defense perk. These killers are going to feel so much better to play when momentum can be gained easier at the start of the match.
---
To have sex with them in exchange for auric cells, as is tradition.
---
i use prove thyself and wglf as survivor and get around 50k bp every match
---
My guy this subreddit is literally a killer main circlejerk, what are you expecting?
---
hah you think that's bad? Try the Crotus prenn asylum, ruin just spawns in the middle of a deadzone for all to see.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Hell I'd settle for 2 more traps default on map. 
---
XdxDxaDxdxdx 
---
Homosexuality Within III
---
Yeah I cant believe some of the perks from the past game. 
---
Unnerving presence used to make skill checks 15% harder at tier 3. 
---
Even better Urban evasion when it first came out only increased crouch movement speed by 15%.
---
The game has changed so much over the past few years. 
---
TBH no. I was addicted for a bit, but DBD got me through a rough year. I just landed a job that will keep me away from it for most of the year, so I’ll be watching on the outside as you guys play the Plague and other new killers later this year :( here’s to hoping the game will be better all around next year!
---
found the "solo queue between ranks 13 and 10" player
---
It shouldn’t be, but if it’s not as soon as someone uses it killer mains are gonna flood this sub crying about it. 
---
The only good thing about (most) Saw movies are behind the scenes. I forgot which movie but for the pendulum trap I do believe they used a real blade IN MOTION while the actor was under it. I won’t spoil the other behind the scenes in case you want something to binge.
---
Lol I knew It!!!! What exactly is the exchange rate ? 
---
Yeah the older maps (except gas haven) and the Asylum are pretty easy, every other map is a different story.
---
Go to the spirt's map, Lery's, The Game, Ormond, Red forest, Haddonfield, Preschool and you'll have a different story.
---
Plus it does take plenty of time overall if everyone is doing it and you don't have communication. That's why either giving survivors a counter of dull totems (to close in the gap between solo survivor and swf) or giving them any sort of indicator of noed before it's in use would go a long way.
---
Also try doing all of the totems when you're solo while you're getting chased a lot.
---
Death to the Stormcloaks!
---
No one is even trying anymore with memes.
---
I drew the comparison to point out that the Trapper's traps are not so big of a threat they should need to be collected before being placed. The other trap-based killers have strong traps too and they don't need to pick them up first.
---
The 3-gen strat is basically the only saving grace for the Trapper as it stands currently. It's his only defense against the exit gates opening since he's either giving up his power to do chases or he's giving up gens in the early game to gain map control.
---
The devs announced in the official forum that they are satisfied with the way the plague has been released and have no plans on changing her.
---
You should of put a empty loading bar at the bottom 
---
The killer was trying to get his insidious, so it was either then or never, I managed to live for about 3 minutes after that
---
I dont think you can play Nurse on Console lul (i play with very high mouse sense and i doubt a controller can keep up).
---
I made it to rank 2 last season. I had 1 more pip to go and just potatoed like 4 matches in a row. I was salty lol
---
That’s a great idea
---
Ye that's why i asked. I played a lot during 1 week and a half and got rank 1. Juste seems like  farming to me, wich sucks tbh.
---
Now do pig!
---
Good job
---
I'd say do it once, just for the achievement, and then never do it again lol
---
Good players don't heal against legion, and don't stick together. They'll spread out, and do each their gen, basically nullifying any pressure a legion can apply by having 3 gens pop by the time he gets his second down, and all five will be gone after maybe 5 hooks. Unless he has franklin's mixtape, it takes a considerable amount of time to down a survivor, and a considerable amount of time to down means the killer is weak
---
They are however extremely obnoxious because they render your skills useless and even when not on you, they'll just force you to spend the next 15 seconds doing pretty much nothing
---
Yeah if they don't take it seriously. I think if the games come fast enough and you don't lose items/pips (as in nothing really to lose like the normal survival based games) then it will be easier to be nonchalant about losses. 
---
Ugh, such a salt-inducing game in so many ways haha. Why do I love it so much PepeHands
---
On top of what was already said: The fact that he has bloodhound in his build implies that it is a so called "moonwalk" legion.
---
The strategy of moonwalk legion is to find somebody, apply deep wounds to them, then break off the chase as soon as possible and follow the trail of blood while walking backwards so you don't re-start the chase.
---
Because the chase is not formally ongoing the survivor will go down in 15 seconds due to the deep wound, but because you're still following them they can't heal the deep wound either.
---
This strategy is "strong" in the sense that it gets things done, but it is an unsportsmanlike crutch. There's very little that a survivor can do against it and neither you nor the survivors are enjoying themselves. Nor is anybody actually getting better at the game because you aren't really playing the game.
---
you dont bloodlust with nurse, bloodlusting only typically happens when looping and you shouldnt be chasing like that with a nurse
---
I reckon you're right there SirJames
---
Mouse 1, killers that rely on just hitting you in melee.
---
That streamers bother me, trying to become "faMoUs" and live on that. And the only thing they do is bully the killer. 
---
No
---
It's something!! 
---
I didn't read your shitty comment until now because my live doesn't revolve around you. A 4 minute reply after a day long break though? Clearly, you didn't forget &lt;3
---
Oh, I thought that bloodlust would stack when blinking. Tho that it would count as chasing and would activate regardless. Well, thought about leveling Huntress because of the perk but good to know I won’t need to
---
Thank you :)
---
&gt;119% speed with one shot M1 ability at the end game where there are no pallets and probably 2-3 survivors left, balanced my ass.
---
If a killer is using NOED usually means he struggles to 4k before all gens are done. If he struggles at the game, I doubt he will clear all pallets quickly (unless of course, the survivor sucks). If he struggles at the game, I doubt he will have killed anyone before the gates are powered.
---
Remember, NOED leaves killers with 3 perks throughout the match so they are less likely to run chasing perks which will punish them by taking longer to capture survivors. 
---
Good killers won't be running NOED because they tend to finish the game before that. So yes, even if NOED activates, often you will have a lot of resources to deal with it. 
---
or give a bonus BP  to the perk Technician : each time you complete 50% repair of a generator you get one stack of Technician. Each stack give you 10/15/25% more BP at the end of the match.
---
The fact that totems spawn in the middle of jungle gyms is a problem
---
The first hag trap popping up in your face when you don't know who the killer is, is also a good way to have your heart up your throat
---
You can. Just a little bit harder
---
Incoming hate towards LF
---
i dont play DBD because im kinda too scared to play it, and my parents probably wont let me play it, but i do play Fortnite. dispite me being at the age of some of those toxic kids (14), im probably the most casual player. if someone kills me, i just leave and try again. sometimes, i'll even friend the person who killed me
---
Yeah I’m not going to be that guy who disconnects and screws my team over. But I’ll happily body block, after rescuing from hook and get put on hook instead. Rather depip trying to help without being a nuance to my team 
---
I never camped anyone so I think I earned it.
---
Yeah fare enough. I find hitting people doing 360s quite easy now after the ridiculous amount of times I’ve been juked by it.
---
I feel like the last panel should just be the first pannel because it really seems like Trapper isn't super bothered by stepping in his own traps
---
ITT: people pointing it ways you could’ve made the meme even spicier
---
Really, as a huntress main, the only one of her perks I actively use is lullaby.
---
Small Game is basically training wheels for you to learn totem locations, so giving it a meaningful buff like that sounds good, yeah.
---
Tunneling isn't toxic. It does however make the game extremely unfun for whoever just got unhooked, only to go down. You can definitely win without resorting to this, which is why it's frowned upon. You are right in that it isn't toxic though
---
What do you mean about mid-match? The killer's loadout qas disabled in the post-match screen so nobody could see it until the game is completely over.
---
Absolutely. I still can't get my head around people who intentionally d/c. At least buy time for your team if you're getting downed and hooked. So selfish to just quit.
---
Sub has gone to shit
---
That’s the reason. Being signed into another account and/or activating that accounts primary will give you the DLC also. One thing you may notice too is that it gave you the killer and survivor, aka the PlayStation store bought DLC. Any characters bought using in-game currency is not shared.  
---
Who were you playing as? I always find billy has a stupid lunge, I mean people say every killers is the same but I can get some crazy hits with Billy’s r1 and I’ve been hit from so god damn far away as well. This could be a lag issue but even with green ms it still happens.
---
Grant us eyes, Grant us eyes! Plant eyes on our brains, to cleanse our beastly idiocy! 
---
if someone has a twitch link in their name I just pull up their stream on my other monitor and mute it. Free ghost
---
We.... we do
---
I just thought of something. Hag with the perk that transfers her terror radius to someone else + the add-ons that make it so survivors don't know her traps were triggered! Imagine how spooky that's gonna be!
---
For farming, killer is the way to go. You get a lot more blood points with bbq&amp;c than playing survivors with wglf. 
---
For fun, playing survivor is much easier than playing killer and mistakes are punished much less. 
---
I like to run trapper with insidious and surprise pull people from the hatch. I then 360 a bunch of times and drop them back in. It's not about killing them, it's about knowing that I could have. It's also really funny when it spooks them.
---
I spent the weekend spreading good vibes on ps4 as killer. Id start games and invite all tue survivors to my party. I did talk to some children with social issues, but for the most part, everyone i talked to was cool and we had a blast no matter who was winning. 
---
Ive never celebrated getting hit with DS until a dwight made an epic play with it and took the hatch. I dont think ive been so happy to have a survivor escape on me and hearing how happy it made the player i was talking to made it even better. Its definitely my preferred way to play because its so much harder to take things personal when you can talk to the person youre playing against.
---
Can it even count as lag at that point, if even the clown sees it? Seems more like the spagetthi code acting up
---
I tried huntress once, I still want to practice her, but I did terrible lol
---
Ye
---
spawn places are garbage for everything
---
Yo why the fuck did I get down voted lmfao? Bet y'all are the ones that rage quit like this lmao. 
---
Perfect phone wallpaper!
---
I wouldn't really count slippery meat as a detriment to trapper, simply because nobody runs it(Since it really only works against him. The minimal increase for a kobe isn't even really considered), and if they for some miraculous reason do, then that's one less perk they're using
---
Although in regards to that, if he was an actual threat compared to a lot of other killers, they might run perks to counter him specifically. As-is though, I see a trapper about as often as I see a Freddy(Basically never), so nobody's motivated to touch the perk, which might in turn also be a good reason to buff him
---
i am in pc 
---
I play self care and empathy. Unlimited range and knowing who is getting chased is nice. I also do solo queues so I don’t want to rely on someone else for heals
---
But as soon as  you switch to killer you get 4 quickswitch p3 squadettes with insta heals and/or purple flashlights that used mist and swamp map offerings...
---
It's ok. I'll forgive you.
---
so Spirit has this quirk where every once in a while she kinda leaves behind some duplicates [like this](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/editor/m4/voj1pqchhfap.png).
---
The tree addons make that more frequent. its good for mindgames.
---
I've suggested raising the BP cap as a devotion reward. In combination with rank BP rewards, I'd find that helpful!
---
I could also see using shards instead of BP, since we can use those for cosmetics and the grind for them feels slower than it used to.
---
Don't think it's feasible to get to red ranks with a camping leatherface. Too many SWF's, the penalty that comes with camping and the occasional kindred would most likely lead to more depips and black pips than pips
---
Is it just me, or is there some sort of stigma for killers to get 4k? Im a killer main (rank 8) and something that I always come across is this. If I get a 4k, I'm insulted (campy, lagswitcher, the 'I'm better than you peasent') and all that. However if I get  2k then I'm teased (baby killer, delete the game noob) and honestly turns me off from playing killer. Currently I'm just taking a break from killer and having some fun with swf.
---
Bill:unbreakable
---
David:no mither (not recommended if you’re garbage)

Meg:adrenaline (as soon as the gens are done)

Every perk is one-timer

Petition to make this one a head piece!

28 seconds for a death animation? This series really was trying too hard lmao
---
Well I mean it’s 4 toxic person vs 1 so there might be more toxic survivors 
---
Umm no fuckin way you have devotion 29 jesus christ
---
To be more clear:
---
Rework the lobby-system to detect who is SWF and who isn't.
---
That would fix 2 things right of the bat and some possible issues in the future.
---
* (Only) As a solo survivor being able to see the Killer loadout after you died.
---
* As a SWF getting back to the SWF Lobby right after the match.
---
There is already futa of it(don't ask how I know)
---
thank you :)
---
Sure stream sniping is not against the rules but you’re a toxic cunt for doing it.
---
Ok but who cares what others have to say about how u play. And the killers seem to be more toxic most of the time when they say ur hacking cause u beat them in a game
---
With Myers there is always the treat that he suddenly flies around a corner, picks you up, and instantly kills you. Now that is a killer that demands respect.
---
You completely ripped my post ideas off. You took the same picture with a similar idea and format. You’re lucky I’m not reporting you

The passive phasing effect is shown at the end of this video. Skip to 18:30 to see phasing effect from both add-ons stacked from both perspectives. Also, I personally think this is a great guide for someone new to The Spirit. Helped me out a lot with some of her more difficult mechanics. Good luck in The Fog.
---
I dunno mate, there’s been a few times as a solo survivor that I’ve gone out of my way to tell some rando, “hey dude’s got NOED/mori”
---
If it’s an abusable system, it will be abused
---
I find that, generally speaking, you shouldn't need more than 4 bottles to down a Survivor. In addition Solvent Jug only works when facing off against Exhaustion perks other than Sprint Burst, and Lithe / Balanced Landing can sometimes go off before you apply Exhaustion. It's a godsend against Dead Hard though.
---
Redhead's isn't that great speaking from personal experience. It's hard to pull off and most experienced Survivors know how to play around it.
---
Getting genrushed is very much so a real thing. That's why some games go to shit and others are piss easy. Even a group of four solo survivors that aren't completely incompetent at running the killer around, and simply hump a generator when they're not being chased, will have the game go by in a flash as soon as chases don't end in 30 seconds or less
---
How does this happen? 
---
Sometimes when I pick up Meg for my survivor I feel like my braincells are changing
---
It's pretty good, I just love the Trapper's mask. Good job!
---
mmmtrue
---
I had an idea while I was in the shower!
---
What if the "beans" thing that the creator council are doing ISN'T just a reference to "spilling the beans" but is a reference to the killer after The Plague.
---
What if we're getting a cowboy killer?

I’m actually a mother of two, with a awesome husband. And I’m a very kind person. You don’t even know me, so that’s very quick judgment of you. 
---
lol but being a streamer doesn't mean anything.. they're not a toxic streamer, they're a toxic player that likes to stream
---
so they're a toxic player. plenty of toxic players in. this game
---
Slug the last two survivors 
---
Survivors popping up around corners out of nowhere scares me everyonce in a while. also I play the Hag alot and her traps activating when I dont expect it while it's right next to me scare the living daylights out of me.

---
Did you mean as the drink tapp or the cop, lol?
---
They should implement proximity chat, and let the killer hear it when hes in range too 
---
There's not going to be a single 60fps patch. It's going to be a gradual process, with performance getting better each patch. 
---
I like that for an add-on idea... not so much an addition to her power tho...
---
I know for sure that the Pro has a better processor and engine, giving better quality in videogames and faster upload speed, the FPS in DbD are higher than a normal Ps4 but that’s it.
---
Even if you had a super PC it wouldn’t matter because the game won’t start until all the players finished loading in.
---
all those things you listed are describing me 100&lt; hours. so basically you're describing new player that don't really understand the game much yet. just give them time rather than getting mad and insulting them back
---
Clown slows down from 115% to 100% when he throws his 15% slow bottles. It's part of the reason he's kinda bad overall. :/
---
Feathers help negate this somewhat since the slow is lessened. It also lets you interact with the game faster to start breaking a pallet or hit a Survivor.
---
So when chapter 11 releases will it improve a lil bit at least?
---
Probably was a Jacket Tapp. Off duty Tapps will do whatever they can to ensure they will not exist in any way or form possible.
---
I'm still annoyed when somebody writes me he wants to slap my bald nans head. i know it is ridicolous, because she still has her hair.
---
The problem is, this gives our gaming community a bad rep. Wouldn't it be nice to writes smbdy who gives you advice, "hey try this and this out next time" than to read what a raging lunatic writes. 
---
a way more fair response? on this subreddit? iconic. 
---
If true then that sucks. I was going to use it on Billy because I hate it when I down someone and I know there's a guy hiding nearby but I don't know where and refuse to wear 7.1 surround sound headphones with very specific sound settings where I almost go deaf so I can just barely hear that one guy hiding in a corner. 
---
The same way claudette is associated with toxic behaviour because so many people use her and are toxic(It's decreased dramatically since the new lightning system has made her considerably easier to spot, and ochid0, being a leading factor of her being the symbol of abuse, also being gone), streamers have a nack for being a dick. I'm not entirely sure why it's such a common thing for streamers to be assholes(Probably to entertain), but if they have ttv in their name, chances are they're going to do something to make your experience sour, no matter which side you're on
---
What's the top image from?
---
That's the best part... it's a maybe ! &gt;.&gt;
---
so both the killer and my teammates can hear me calling the urban evasion self caring p3 claudette a fucking moron? i dunno, might be okay.
---
Megs start with sprint brust, which is inherently the best starter perk for a new player, simply because they don't have situational awareness, and sprint burst helps nullify some of the need. Thus, new players are most likely going to play her. She also has adrenaline, so her and claudette are the most recommended starter characters
---
&gt;The Hag’s traps require a flashlight or crouch walking, which is a much bigger time investment.
---
I agree Trapper needs tuning but The Hag and Trapper should never be compared gameplay-wise
---
"*cough cough*" ..is my l0rd "*cough cough*" because just saying "*HACK*""*CHOKE*" his name "*BELCH*" "*PUKE*" triggers the children "*shits pants*""*cries blood*" in this sub "*explodes into a pile of gold coins*"
---
The interact time delay never interrupted anything for me but I just somehow never noticed the slowdown XD
---
yeah, fuck
---
"Piggy in the Corn!" Lol, like when someone at the beach shouts "SHARK!"
---
I both love and hate you at the same time!
---
Both your posts are bad are the lowest possible point a joke could get 
---
Things will never go back to how they were...
---
This art is just so good, great job!
---
People play like asshats and the game is still unstable, better than console though.
---
Cheaters are very rare. 
---
You can install MLGA to block asshats. 
---
Totem spawns and pallet spawns are both garbage.
---
Which ones the second killer?
---
Actual hackers are pretty rare outside of free weekends these days.  You'll see one every once in a while.  You'll see a lag switch every once in a blue moon as well, though you'll see and hear a lot of accusations of it that are more likely just borderline bandwidth issues.  
---
You will probably run into more pro sports swf on PC than console, but that's just a guess.  It's a fsr older platform, so it's realistic, but I can't speak to console. 
---
Killer should be way more fun, handling wise on PC rather than console.  Survivor should be more a matter or what controls you're more used to. 
---
The thing I love most about wraith is that he's the killer that you're most likely to have survivors literally walk into you, or not immerse themselves whenever you're 3 walls away. Means I can actually chase, instead of play hide and seek
---
The Claudette
---
Only thing I have to say for this is a totem counter to show how many totems are left. If NOED needs some changes it will get changes.
---
I only do it if they're face camping and about to die 
---
Ahh, I meant to write sloppy butcher... Ill edit that right away
---
Ill eat all those pallets
---
Both 
---
Should I mori him?? 
---
Even 3 gem starts can be rng though :(
---
it looks like the Daughters - You Won’t Get What You Want album cover
---
Wanna share that match? I want to experience it too
---
You just can't see her because her flashlight is turned off. 
---
Swapping agro is a smart game style. If someone is running bond and selling out team mates, that’s another ball game.
---
Any wraith that RELIES on the ultra rare add-on, is inherently not a good killer. I've ran wraith with literally no add-ons and no noed and gotten quite a few 4K's at rank 1, purely because it's super easy to find survivors since they don't actively hide without a terror radius to warn them, and often enough you can get a free hit since the first bing comes halfway through uncloak
---
You relying on an add-on doesn't mean the killer is reliant on it, and the add-on is extremely potent, hence its rarity tier. 
---
Maybe a slight buff. He can default carry two? In red ranks, when I see a trapper they can be genuinely scary. Safe loop? Nope. Window?  Nope. He’s genuinely scary to face. 
---
Ahhh fuck where
---
You can get up with No Mither about 5 times before bleeding out, it's the only exception.
---
Wtf thought this was a one timer as well, but ngl if killer sees you injured from the beginning don’t expect to get slugged
---
I agree there equally toxic 
---
Only really tangentially related, but it's insane how many free 4ks you can get by sticking close to your one farming thrill of the hunt totem.  Like, people do Gens, they see there's no ruin, and yet they will suicide on a spike over and over to kill that thing. 
---
Not enough 
---
People will hate anything that ruins the fun for one side, even if it helps the fun for another. That's just how PvP is
---
I swf with my brother and a couple of our friends and we just have fun, if we’re against someone that “camps” or “tunnels” then we don’t care we just have fun, some people take it so seriously 
---
You should enjoy it.  Frames make playing killer way better and their playerbase from what I've seen tend to camp less than our console brethren.
---
No true, only time it might work is as a support perk for team mates, jumping in front of the killer when he's chasing your injured team mate. The killer will either pick you up, or has to make the choice to leave you to get up and keep chasing the injured team mate.
---
Aww, I thought you were actually going to land on him!  Was going to go look for a link to the Blazing Saddles theme! 
---
Tbh, not even sure if that's possible with survivor on top. 
---
"What's he doing under the light?" "He's *just standing there*, **MENACINGLY"** 
---
(Anyone else think of this Spongebob scene..?) 
---
Just give it some time, you'll see it clicking at random intervals if you're patient
---
Highest I've ever gotten is 890 BP. And that already spamming stuggle before the seconds phase.
---
Well, not really. I've seen a plenty of decent, and a handful of good players even, that have been pretty stinky with their attitude.
---
One of the best learning perks is the wraith's tracking perk "Predator". It will make it considerably easier to keep track of where the survivors move during phasing. While a good spirit probably won't need it, it's a good learning perk. I've heard that stridor can give really mixed results and throw you off from people that have played her a decent bit, but I have no personal experience with it
---
A group of SWF will already know how many totems are remaining. This information is purely relevant to solo players. As for exposed being revealed immediately, that would just mean it'd have more counterplay than it currently does. And noed users sure do love to bring up how balanced it is because it has counters! So how about giving ACTUAL counters like knowing how many totems are left, and that it's in play when it can one-shot down
---
Ill try that out, I have to get bamboozle however Im pretty close to getting SF
---
I see people like monto play her and is just insane the shots they get lol 
---
Sounds great!
---
A little bit XD
---
Excuse my confusion, but at what point in your life were you sniffing Gucci Mane's belly button? 
---
Wrong, it has never been easier for campers to rank up.  I can't tell you how many campers I still come across at rank 1.  Those swf get overly altruistic often which feeds these trolls.  Very glad they're changing the emblem scoring to punish campers back into trash ranks where they belong.
---
So basically, play like an asshole. Gotcha. The perk promotes being a dick as a survivor. Boy I sure love this perk!
---
people actively playing the game aren't likely to stop and watch a stream of a game they're already playing.
---
the advertising itself isn't the issue, we're talking about the stereotypes associated with self advertising, which don't always apply to everyone anyway.
---
there are ways to get views besides tagging your game, and of the 4 or 5 streamers i know, one of which (a japanese streamer named wavekid) has a decently large following, none of them advertise their stream in their name.
---
Like who? Angrypug has Lvl 11 or 12 and he plays 8 hours a day 5 or 6 days a week
---
Just don't.  Honestly, I cannot think of any time I'd bring beast of prey to a match outside of it being the only perk I found so far.  Especially not on Nurse, though. 
---
Selfcare
---
Idk man. There are a lot of potato survivors, even at rank 1. I think you could make it work if you really tried.
---
Killer here, can't wait to get DS'd as a punishment instead of when I finally down a survivor!
---
Best guess sometime next week between tuesday-thursday
---
They do all the time but it's usually for a reason. 
---
I think they've taken a cue from the Freddy fiasco not to nerf Killers. Even though they've yet to fix Freddy.
---
&gt; The Pig's traps take huge amounts of time to get off
---
lolno
---
Like the Gentlemen from Buffy's Hush ?
---
She just activated her cloak mode, give it a few minutes and she'll get out of it.
---
Claudettes are still worse.  
---
Your entire story still proves its toxicity, and no offence, you sorta sound like an ass. The fact that the killer felt bad going after you because you provoked them in the first place doesn’t change you being a dick, but adds to how much better of a person genuinely they are. It’s like pissing on a homeless guy and saying “My bad fam, Just wanted to see if you’d snap, here’s some change”. There’s a point gesture and a come here gesture... which already get used toxically. T bagging after dropping pallets is just frosting the cake at that point, regardless if your intentions weren’t with malice. You can’t rightfully or with any sense judge an action purely through hindsight. It’s somewhat worrying that someone would even assume you could. As a rank 1 surv... the closest I’ve came to “tbagging” is a ty tbag, the short 1-2. Logically speaking if your goal was being good, and had 0 intentions of being toxic, a well seasoned player wouldn’t waste the survival time by killing 3 seconds tbagging. The whole game is built on optimization of your movements, tbagging only shows your more comfortable playing against what you’re assuming are less skilled players, and from my experience on the killer side, atleast 80% of the people who consistently tbag are the same who run ds, only use flashlights, and disconnect when they clue in (if you can call it that) to being outplayed due to their own actions. I’m not making wild claims either, it’s pretty damn consistent.
---
Fuck that I’m leaving 
---
The fuck is this post lmfao
---
Huntress has always been free on console, you just have to download the (free) DLC.
---
Play killer 'til you die inside ;)
---
Pretty sure this is reportable, under harassment or something like that.
---
Makes sense. I thought it would be good on Nurse, since when I play survivor against one, I try to see where she lands by the bloodstain and tho that Beast of a prey would be a good perk to hide it
---
But apparently it doesn’t work on her like that and doesn’t seem a good perk in general 
---
Thanks for the reply btw 
---
I feel like it only makes sense that survivors are going to be significantly more toxic.
---
Killers have a built in method of venting frustration and exerting power over other players. They get to murder the shit out of them. Survivers, for the most part, must resort to toxic behavior to ever exert that same feeling of power.
---
Survivers have a team, and therefore the support of gang mentality. This is generally accepted to allow for a greater amount of toxicity, at least in the case of bullying.
---
On top of all this, survivors have significantly more opportunities to be toxic, particularly in game. From teabagging to emoting to flashlight clicking to taking the game hostage, they have plenty of options. In game, most actions that the killers take are designed to be part of the game. The closest things to common "toxic killer behavior" I can see are camping and tunneling, both of which have strategic merits and can't be written off as purely toxic behavior in a competitive game.
---
You asked me to change your mind, I gave it my best shot. Don't hate me.
---
Other survivors heal you twice as fast as you can self-care, but that means they have to stop whatever they are doing.
---
Basically it can only ever cost the team more time, because two survivors healing at 16 seconds is still 32 seconds of time spent on the heal, plus you had to go and run to them.
---
So same name, but no. Ashley graham is a model. 
---
BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/Spirit Fury is pretty much meta for all killers at the moment. With Michael you can get away with BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/MA.
---
I’d recommend one of those two builds for general playing on Michael.
---
The perk you are referring to is **Unbreakable**. Unbreakable is **William "Bill" Overbeck's** Third Teachable Perk. 
---
You will need to level Bill up to **Level 40** to be able to buy Unbreakable Teachable.
---
I agree with this. The game honestly feels unplayable without a bag addon. That makes it so you feel like you only really have one addon.
---
That episode fucked me upppp
---
I've been saying this for a long time, the original 3 killers have exceptionally outdated mechanics.  Billy survived because his was strong enough not to go obsolete.  Wraith was in a bad place, and was helped by his rework adding some elements to his kit at base.  Trapper's add on pass just isn't enough.  He and Mikey are the only 2 killers who have to literally collect their power, but Mike gains a slight benefit beforehand (stealthy), and his power is quite increased once fully collected.  Trapper has NO such mitigation for that huge downside.  He doesn't move faster when he's not weighed down by traps, collecting all his traps doesn't increase his power beyond having more instances down, which is not really a huge increase in killing potential, considering everyone knows by then to watch for traps, and it doesn't matter, because they all just walked out the door anyway. 
---
While trapper and hag have a very different trap handling, go into a kyf and find the killer shack.  Then go trap every single spot you can find around it with hag.  Then go do it with trapper.  Its just.... Ugh. 
---
She exercises and eats healthy, she just has a bigger body type. 
---
damn i wish lol 
---
I run bond so I see every dumbass thing my teamates do.  If I come across a completely immersed teamate that isn't touching gens, totems, altruism, anything but just urban evasioning around the map and hiding I will sandbag the shit out of you.  Teamates like that are just as bad as facecampers on the other side and they don't deserve to live.  I'll throw a pebble right at your immersed face.
---
Without context available in game, and considering the origin of the teabag, it's pretty much always going to be assumed to be malevolent, unless you've placed yourself in a position of complete vulnerability beforehand. 
---
Even in your example, you intentionally did it to press the killers buttons... So it's being used malevolently.  You may not always be an ass, but that certainly qualifies.  Of course, the killer is also somewhat responsible for taking that bait, as well. 
---
I haven't bothered to play since the December update fiasco. What's with the meme about playing Legion against the twitch streamers? 
---
Prestige cosmetics are best cosmetics imo! Plus they're darker colored for hiding and free since you plan on p3 anyways!
---
The doctor and nurse both maintain strict sanitation and sterilization standards, thank you very much. 
---
Well done, you not only displeased the Entity, you wasted the Entity's time.
---
I still have hope for the Tall Man from phantasm. 
---
PTB has a pattern of ending 2 weeks to the day it launched. So the 20th. And then most likely the day after that or the 18th or 19th is when those changes and new Killer/Survivor come to the base game. 
---
Blinking removes bloodlust, so Beast of Prey does not interact with her blink.
---
The point that “it becomes a hassle to cleanse totems if you’re playing solo” is a really cheap way out of it. You are not forced to play solo, you are queuing up, no one is doing it for you. And by that you should no that playing solo is a lot harder than SWF, you cannot communicate as well about things like who/where the killer is, what perks/add-ons they have. So by queuing up alone you are deliberately making the game harder for yourself, how can you then sit and complain about NOED, if there is a simple solution, play SWF. And if you say “But I have no one to play with” you are wrong. You can just join the DBD discord and always have people to play with.
---
&gt; Another thing that would be great, but not too unfair in terms of nerfing NOED would be showing how much totems are left on the map in total. In a survive with friends group you can ask your teammates how many totems they have removed, but if you do not have a 4-man squad you don't know how many totems remain and can thus be turned into the NOED totem. If you could see how many totems are remaining you know wether you are safe from the insta-down perk or not. Since killers react to the rants against NOED with the old and golden reply "Just do totems lol", i think it would be fair that survivors would see wether they actually have to do totems, or wether they are already cleared.
---
Just a completely terrible idea. 
---
1) If this was the case all the totems would be cleansed every single time. The devs would rightfully never allow a perk to be *that* easy to totally counter. And NOED is already one of the most easily countered perks in the game, Survivors just don't want to do it.
---
2) You're not supposed to have perfect knowledge of whether or not the perk could activate. Good grief
---
Yep, I had a guy go down near me and I had a toolbox, almost had my gen done. He got hooked near me as I finished the gen and began urban evading over, woulda taken 10 seconds. In those 10 seconds I guess I wasn’t moving fast enough because he started trying to pull himself off, so I walked over to him as he did it in my face, teabagged and walked off at which point he promptly suicided.
---
No idea why he was THAT impatient as I was actively heading to help him. Oh well
---
Oh well, I guess it would be kinda op if blink didn’t remove and it could combo with the perk. Makes sense 
---
Thank you 
---
I'm guessing new chapter on the 19th
---
Going after just one player throughout multiple games to the exclusion of other is already reportable. 
---
It's a good idea to check the "laws" before complaining about them not existing. 
---
I believe the code of conduct is stickied in the game forums (though I could be wrong). 
---
If you've been playing the game longer than a few months and still can't work through Ruin you're trash.  Ran a killer for 3 minutes yesterday and not a single gen pops.  I ended up having to repair the first two gens myself afterwards because scrubs can't hit skill checks and refuse to even try.  I'm sorry but I got no empathy for these types of teamates.  They tank the entire team.
---
I play survivor and killer equally. And at this point everyone knows to just jump in a locker for a few seconds to counter it. Running the same crutch perks on every killer means you’re weak and can’t make a decent 4K without BHVR holding your hand. Same for nurses, self care, ds, etc. it goes both ways asshole.
---
That is not what that always means lol. Why wouldn't you use addons? Literally every killer does. I was simply giving advice with different addons. Perhaps you should form your own opinions rather than listening to all of the youtubers and streamers. 
---
Just some math I did when I played the Clown.  
---
Bottle reload time 5,1sec  
---
With Thick Cork Stopper its 3,03sec so 68,3% faster than normal.  
---
With Thick Cork Stopper + Fingerless Parade Stopper its 2,67sec so only another 22,9% increase.  
---
In conclusion my dic.. Thick Cork Stopper is all you need and man its great!  
---
Claudette is great! Totally agree her P3 camo is nice lol.
---
Only killers can be toxic change my mind(coming from a killer main) oH HeS TeABaGGinG!!! Yeah ok just don’t mind me running noed, facecamping you with leatherface, being a tunneling baby killer, and pretending killers still at all hard to play verses the average survivor. Yes survivors have crutches but killers can RUIN the game. Pun intended. 
---
Everyone needs to be able to work through gens with Ruin.  If you can't you're a liability just like a teamate that can't run a killer more than 10 seconds.
---
Yeah nothing wrong with that since you're still sort of new. Its just at red ranks you get people with 2k+ hours with people with only a couple hundred. Huge difference but same rank.
---
Maybe you just suck dick at the game. He is fine, just because he cant fly acrossed the map or explode and kill survivors doeant mean he is broken. Just get good and quit pretending everything that doesnt 1 shot is weak. You're weak.
---
Also, at what point in his life?
---
Mans cleaned up after his prison sentence.
---
I play leatherface as frantically searching for The Intruders, camping isn't part of my game.
---
But if you go in the basement against a leatherface, you deserve what you get. That shit is uncool.
---
I'd be happy with a trapper addon rework and giving us a baseline 3 traps to start with.

You sound like someone who suicides on first hook because he's so pissed at silly little details.
---
lmao amazing. You still can't respond to my points. Just answer even one of them ffs
---
What the fuck I've seen this exact conversation months ago
---
You can't form your own opinion and its sad. You're the type of person that wants everything in a single tier and no variety to where addons and perks become meaningless. You're not worth my time or energy because you have a simple mind.
---
See thats your problem? Making faulty assumptions. Im jusy not biased to all hell. I have a p3 ace but hey if that doesnt count
---
I love Wraith I play him often but no way is he better than Leatherface.  He can't compete with an instadown and if you're in the open that's a guaranteed down.
---
*way* too slow. 
---
Concept is good, execution bad.
---
Jesus the salt in these comments of a shitpost is hilarious.
---
Yes.... Enlighten me, knowledgeable one.
---
Hate to break it to you but no one in the known cosmos thinks the plague is any more than a 1.
---
Huh, wierd.  I guess some constants remain constant.
---
I wouldn't call 800+ hours new
---
Mhhhm, especially if you’re running Borrowed Time. If the killer thinks to hook the second right near the first one and then try to down the first hooked survivor, it will give more time for them and more time for the others to save the second one and try and finish a gen.
---
It's fine, I definitely get where your coming from lol, it is really over done by now. &lt;3
---
...Who do you think I'm parroting? This really is bizarre. I gave a list of issues with Trapper, and you're just screaming about me not forming my own opinion and calling me simple. But it seems you're the one with a small mind.
---
&gt;  You're the type of person that wants everything in a single tier and no variety to where addons and perks become meaningless.
---
Like I have no idea where this came from wtf
---
BuT hAg Is So sLoW eArLy Game AnD is ReAlLy BaD bECAuse of iT.
---
Rhe man gave you 5 minutes and you couldn't pop any gens?  I'd have been livid man.  Even I'd you ONLY hit good skill checks you still should have gotten at least 2 gens down with Ruin up.  I'd have been out of that match myself.  How long can you guys reasonably expect the guy to stick around and carry you 3?  I'm sorry I'm not trying to be a dick but I get stuck with teamates like the game you described often and it is beyond frustrating.
---
I've had multiple times where a good player went off because we lost a match because of someone not doing well or just poor teamwork while they did a lot of work. When it comes to being toxic the issue isn't skill level, it's the amount of entitlement that the player has. A lot of people go in with the mindset that they're supposed to have fun and if they're not having fun then something is wrong. It makes sense to an extent, you paid for this game why shouldn't you enjoy it? But since this is an online multiplayer game not every game will be fun or go just the way you want it. I think having the option of doing offline matches with bots could really help decrease toxicity because it would give players an opportunity to get better at the game in a less stressful environment and it would also give them the opportunity to have that fun experience that they were looking for.
---
Then I'll remove the "survivors can destroy the doll cases". Thanks for the feedback!
---
You can't bully a killer if you're bad.
---
I hope your condition improves.
---
...Did you start going through my post history to get mad about stuff? You are actually fucking insane oh my god. And I never said Trapper is bad. I laid out several issues with his balance that need to be addressed 
---
Looking at you Legacy Claudette. But in all seriousness the survivors who I've noticed that always lead the killer to me are Dwights, Lauries, and anyone who runs backwards.
---
Isn’t that what the nod is?
---
Not really.
---
A fast 4k no gens usually leads to iridescent-iridesent-gold-black
---
Which is enough to rank up in the new ranking system up to red ranks. They will get stuck at rank 4. 
---
Also again in other games with ranking systems you would get little to no rank in a game in which you completely pubstop your competition. The only other game that I can think of with such a binary ranking system would be hearthstone. Even then only the visible rank goes up or down base on win/lost. It has a invisible rank that that works more traditionally. In which if you are higher rank and the game thinks you will win, you will get no invisible ranking. 
---
Okay. I'm going to mark you down as "literally insane and crawling through people's post histories to get mad about irrelevant things from a week ago and incapable of addressing people's arguments calmly"
---
great
---
I appreciate you for that, I try to do the same and that's why I like to run bond when I can.
---
I’m late to the party, but holy shit. You just made Bubba a tiny bit suicidal
---
Woah, looks great! Any chance you can make one for a Clown main? I feel so alone with my big boi
---
Lol. I love this.
---
Yes
---
Ummm, I never understood why people tunnel/mori/hate twitch streamers that have it in their name. Like what the hell is your problem? Let them have fun and grow their stream, Christ 
---
This is why this game and community are toxic 
---
The guy plays at rank 20 and thinks he is a pro

---
I was working on a gen, and I think another one was but I don’t know what the other one was doing. I do usually have matches where Ruin is in play, but this match was a little frustrating for everyone.
---
I’m going to try harder and play smarter next time, this was one of my first few red matches I experienced.
---
There are just so many of them. Seems like every lobby I go into has at least one. Idc if they do it, but when they try to act toxic like their idol, that’s what gets on my nerves. It’s like, no one cares about your stream dude, give up the act.
---
Why the fuck are people downvoting this.  We find the other cheating trashcans that coop with players from the other side?

Well... That's kinda the point so yeah or design is a sucess.

I got rank one killer on ps4 and there was no trophy. Theres also no survivor teophy. What are you playing on?
---
I use SB, Bs, Ruin and monitor. Depends on my addons and such. 
---
Why is everyone assuming op is full of shit?  I went up against a teaming Michael with a Meg the other week.  He used her to farm every survivor to death, they both spam bm all the players with nods and teabags.  After everyone else was dead he watched her repair final gen open exit gate and bounce.  There are cheating slimy dickheads in this game.  OP gave no reason to doubt the validity of their story.
---
So cleanse the totems? They nerfed DS cause it is unfun and has no counter only soft counters, NOED is probably one of the most balanced perks in the gane, it rewards the killer for only using three perks the entire game as well as punishing the survivors for not taking their time
---
I mean...she probably *was* pretty hot before the whole plague shit went down. 
---
Was once playing swf with a friend of mine, killer was a huntress who wasn't doing to well with the hatchet tosses. We got to the point of the gates being opened and so far no one was downed, but then my friend goes down, gets hooked near a door, and the killer proceeds to facecamp. I'm able to rescue him with the help of the other people we played with. But I go down and get facecamp, I just tell my friend to leave and the others follow him. 
---
In the post game chat I see that it was a t.tv username that was the killer, and proceeds to call us trash and toxic (mind you, and I promise, we generally are not, we don't try to run pallet loops and we definitely don't teabag). I'm just more confused than anything but then I go to twitch and sure enough he is streaming and going on a rant about how we we're the toxic ones, and his few viewers he had were just eating it up. Agreeing with him in chat.
---
So yeah, lots of twitch streamers are toxic 
---
NOED won't be broken. I don't know what it is but survivors would rather be no hooked moried than actually take time to break dull totems. Even though it gives them points, points towards emblem and can stop NOED they still absolutely refuse to break them. It makes no sense
---
The problem is 90% of survivors that accuse killers of tunneling don’t actually know what tunneling is. 
---
90% of survivors: “ hey the killer just hooked you and is now not even 10 feet away, lemme immediately unhook you”
---
Killer: *insta downs the survivor and rehooks them*
---
Survivor: “OMG baby killer tunneling”
---
Yeah that’s horrible! The one of the games before this one was a Pig match where I did 2 gens, got maybe 4 unhookings - did the last gen and that was the first time I was caught. The Quentin that was the only one left, open the gates and left me. First time on hook, the pig wasn’t even camping me and didn’t have NOED. but I can’t expect much from a Quentin, he’s always so tired.
---
What's in the OP is not what the rule there means. At all. If you think the devs are going to hand out bans to people for going after one single person throughout one single game then you're delusional
---
I literally haven't lost a single game with The Legion. He gud
---
Oh wise is the survivor who leaves her totems untouched
---
For they are children of our lord  and corrupting thy children will incure her wrath
---
Do not run from her REEEEEEE...for that is the The Hags greatest gift to us lowly peasants
---
Embrace the Hag, love thy Hag for she is good
---
Now for our Mantra:
---
She protec
---
She atac
---
But most importantly she set traaaaap
---
Was- was the Tapp’s name Detective Trapp?
---
Was it a bloody tapp?
---
Survivor insanity. Same old same old
---
This post is so ironic. Hates NOED yet gives advice on how to use it lmao.
---
The 3 perk midgame excuse is bullshit.  When the final result is a fast as fuck instadown killer endgame you really aren't giving up much.  Plus most killers have a lot of leeway when it comes to their 4th perk anyways. 4th slot is typically my flex spot.  In a solo queue game I cannot begin to tell you how many times I take out 3 or 4 totems myself still to eat NOED from the baby killer that couldn't down me once midgame.  Only swf groups take out 5 totems.  In solo games killers can and will get their mindless noed proc.  At a point in the games balance where playing killer has never been easier I just don't get why players still feel the need to rock the babycrutch 
---
You never heard of a sore winner
---
And the new DS is somehow better than not getting hooked in the first place or saving your DS? New DS is absolutely useless in its current state. They need to remove the timer; in the PTB I was just slugged for a minute after every save. I understand that killers were probably expecting DS in the PTB hence the slugging so that MAYBE in the live version tunnelers will (stupidly) pick up the survivor instead of waiting for a minute, but I definitely won't hold my breath. And then, of course, there's the fact that the top-tier add-on killers with moris are going to have a field day now. 
---
Just cleanse the totems bro, it's not a big deal.
---
Wait, doctor and hag aren’t free on pc?
---
I don’t think he needs a huge buff. I think this goes for a lot of the weaker killers, but he needs some of his Add one default. At the very least, he should start out with more traps.
---
I’d also love to see him either reset the trap or automatically pick up the trap when you pick up a trapped survivor.
---
Technically 6 parodies. There's the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zlUtUxtzrc).
---
&gt;What's in the OP is not what the rule there means. At all. If you think the devs are going to hand out bans to people for going after one single person throughout one single game then you're delusional
---
OP listed and excluded a bunch of stuff that involves normal gameplay. The only thing that is left as his meaning of "tunneling" is being harassed by someone. Either that or I don't get what OP is trying to say. 
---
Please post this. The hilarity of the description makes me want to experience it personally.
---
Lol completely glosses over my point about taking out totems.  All good guessing you're just another super weak killer still rocking the baby perk.
---
Not sure, it was PS4 so I kind of doubt it. 
---
I don't sue NOED, I don't like it, I prefer using 4 perks. You don't need to use something cause you defend it bud. But that is basically it, if you cleanse the totems NOED sin't an issue.
---
The devs are talking about targeting an individual throughout multiple games. They are not making a rule that the killer has to spread out their aggro. That's literally insane.
---
&gt; Either that or I don't get what OP is trying to say. 
---
Op is whining because they feel like one killer chased them too much one time
---
I normally don’t agree with a lot of killer changes but these are some solid suggestions. Would love to see trapper get a buff.
---
No, he still had a clean white shirt. 
---
Lol that's the worst, I understand sometimes getting scared and hesitating on things, but ditching someone who almost all the work sucks. If I feel like another survivor did more work or offered a streamer I will gladly sacrifice myself for them. I remember a match where only two gens got done and we all got slaughtered because it was at the meat plant, and one guy who did semi decent decided to "apologize" to the killer for having a shitty team. The killer then proceeded to roast him for using a meat plant offering and called him the bad team mate lol
---
Oh thank god
---
Where should the totem spawn? Within generators sight, God forbid, 'jungle gyms' no, hills or open areas no, then where? Edge of the map? But then survivors will just run along walls and cleanse all totems. What's your solution? Make them completely invisible? 
---
I forgot about the music video
---
Poor leather face. More like baby Billy. He’s so damn fun to play. I’m actually considering calling myself a LF main. I don’t camp either.
---
Why do ppl keep exaggurating rank 1 lol, im not even a good killer and all of my Freddy/Bubba games are 4ks unless I let someone off the hatch. 
---
Why are you being downvoted 
---
not really. Other than camping something it has no use, and camping is rarely optimal. Also hard countered by swf like most perks.
---
I could not give less of a shit about noed. I'm a killer main. 
---
FOOKIN DEAD ARD
---
Its situational and fun to use. But people seem to forget how to have fun in this game.
---
Reminds me of Imscared and I love it.
---
I'm interested to see where Plague ends up. I played her for about 6-7 hours (so...about one match /s). She is definitely at the very least a noob stomper killer; if the survivors heal up and I get my corrupted purge then she feels REALLY strong (even against good loopers). The add-on that increases speed with corrupted purge also feels really broken...but then if survivors DON'T heal, she feels on the higher end of average; she's a 115 killer with a slower version of backrev (if you can land a full broken effect purge).
---
I'm not a top-tier killer at all, though, and I remember that spirit wasn't seen as S/A+ tier until people started getting really good with her. I can't really see Purge as S tier, but I have a sneaking suspicion that she'll end up an A tier killer. Happy to hear that the devs won't change her. 
---
I think he means one that looks like American Psycho. Unassuming.
---
Makes sense. I wanna play Nurse, tried some matches and I really enjoyed her playstyle. I will check out his videos
---
Thank you for all the info :) 
---
I've been having some really fun survivor games lately! I had a wraith sneak up on me in the basement as I searched a chest so I stopped and pointed at him to leave me alone and he just nodded  and walked away haha. Sometimes it's just nice to have a silly game where the killer isn't taking it too seriously
---
I you don't Sprint burst over before the killer leaves I kill myself. /s
---
One time I grabbed a dude off of a hook before he could activate Borrowed Time and I got called a camper. 
---
r/rareinsults
---
Buy a tomahawk and a stump and do it in your yard. I used to run events doing this and got pretty good at it. Too bad those skills didn't transfer to Huntress lol.
---
If we’re being serious. A killer with OCD like Jack from Lars Von Trier’s film the house that jack built could be interesting. You can have a power and unique perks that reward perfectionist play style. 
---
897 is my best.
---
definitely not. 🤣
---
Terror anuses? Chapter XIII killer "The Flatulator" confirmed!
---
Oh... 
---
Ok then 
---
Getting camped or camping someone isn’t fun to me.
---
It’s not as effective in low ranks because newbies are still oblivious to the fact that you can see them squatting on the hatch/in a corner doing fuck all but in solo high ranks it’s a game changer 
---
Terror radius replaced by HI BILLY MAYS HERE
---
all potatoes will evolve into french fries eventually &lt;3
---
Yes, in his short frenzy window he trumps stealth.
---
But after that you're left with multiple survivors with deep wounds, with no scratch marks, who then run away and heal peacefully while the legion aimlessly runs around trying to find the healing survivors. 
---
This is of course if you play his intended playstyle.
---
🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Ace
---
Without a bag you feel really gimped. The only time I don't run bag is with honing stone or a fastening tool.  Bloody coil and Iridescent Stone are also a great combo.
---
But overall it's # of traps, speed, then damage buff on trap for priority.  
---
Having the ability to hold 2 traps should be standard and brown bag just adds one to your starting inventory. 
---
1 trap trapper is more active m1 killer style. Instead of herding. 
---
But after plauge drops we'll see how much of a change trapper really needs when we can control the gen rush a bit better. 
---
I swear this morning I got teamed up with a teammate who, not sure what she was thinking, would unhook with the killer right there. I'm sitting there like nononono and.. down. Two matches in a row same person. I could only imagine what the person on the gen was thinking. I was done after that. 
---
You’re right though, what a douche.  Giving good Feng mins a bad name 
---
Unbreakble - Bill Overbeck teachable perk on PC, non-teachable on console. Allows you to get recover faster and get up from the dying state once.
---
No Mither - David King teachable. Renders you injured for the entire match, but when you’re downed, you can get up an unlimited amount of times.
---
very true.
---
put this with bloodhound (imo that replaces legions scratchmarks). and the other play style is he constantly keeps at the one guy  that has no counterplay to beat him with
---
Nerfed? She needs a buff lol. Insta healing at fountains is ridiculous. 
---
GTFO
---
And what's a good and fair way to play him after you hit someone with your power and there are no other survivors in the vicinity? Choose to pull off the survivor? Choose not to use your power and get looped for a period of time that would be much longer than if you just chased with your power?
---
Some Legion players are absolute cunts, no denying that. But they're only doing the optimal thing to do half the time. It isn't fully their fault. It's his faulty design. Nor are they the ones to blame for playing in a beat-ass way either. The devs are not only ALLOWING it, but ENCOURAGING it since his 110% movement speed is absolutely gross.
---
Shameless plug for another doll concept you might want to check out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9a91t0/killer\_concept\_the\_dolls\_survivor\_map\_perks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9a91t0/killer_concept_the_dolls_survivor_map_perks/)
---
Entire game is ran on rng. :/ It's just something we need to live with. If I'm not mistaken the new perk works on furthest starting gens from the killer. So you can zone easier. 
---
I just hope it's not too strong when mixed with ruin. 
---
Sounds about right. I always tell megs and Claudette’s they’re ugly. 
---
Killers seem to more frequently engage in toxic behavior such as camping in all of its forms(face/proxy camping), and tunneling. I consider NOED to be toxic too, but whatever, not everyone agrees. 
---
There are however more chances for survivor to be, as there are 4 of them. It's important for people to realize too, that looping well and being good at chases isn't toxic in any way. 
---
Obviously both sides can be, but I mostly play killer with some surv too, and far more killers seem to engage in douchey behavior than survs. Also, survivor behavior is easily counterable, whereas if a killer wants to be a shithead and camp/tunnel off hook, you're pretty much screwed. 
---
but I was Kate...
---
She looks like Nia... so that’s a nope. 
---
Thrill of the Hunt is way better than NOED in a Hex-only build, especially on a Killer like Hag that specialises in patrolling small areas.
---
Good. Enjoy your ban.
---
brother you living in some bubble around here on reddit, even with the pig or freddy I have never let gens go that fast and average a 2-3 kill game usually ; the games I find it hard to put pressure on are when I get those farm maps or crotus prenn asylum (That map is fucking ridiculous btw), and yamaoka estate because that house fucking blinds me when I'm playing freddy but it really isn't a thing and killers on reddit need to stop living in a bubble same way survivor mains need to stop, learn how to pressure maps and force the survivors into bad positions and not rely on noed, try out a tracking perk maybe might help.
---
Trapper is my favorite killer and I think he is mostly fine.
---
Maybe give him his brown bag as a base but I think giving him all traps at the start would be very OP (imo).
---
For me it's the pig, when I bump into one sneaking around it scares the shit out of me.
---
On the flip side, I think every killer should be able to have a little something in their power for every part of the game, like something in the chase for the Doctor. 
---
I tend to be in 2 man SWF so when the two others lead the killer to us we yell lmao. It's worse when you're trying to get an unhook and were perfectly hidden then bam, theres claudette with the killer behind her. 
---
See also the survivors that point at lockers you're hiding in. 😊
---
&gt;M1 killers
---
&gt;Leatherface
---
Um.... Ok. 
---
I don't think there's any way to find out what specifically caused it, that'd make the ones who reported you a target.
---
According to the [rules](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system), "insults" is listed under harassment, so while you might not have been using hate speech- still gets banned.
---
Where the hell are you getting the info that you depip from a 4k no gen done? 
---
You black pip (aka safety pip) from that. You say it would encourage proxy camping but that runs the risk of the killer not moving far enough away and then losing what little chaser emblem they have.
---
I know right. Human race is trash.
---
Sucks. Thanks!
---
Damn you are really good at this, And you're making more for other people!
---
Hell yeah for the Decisive Strike change, now I won't feel bad about an anti-tunnel perk.
---
I got to rank 4 this season with Freddy. (This is also the first season I started spending blood points on killer. Until now I mostly played survivor only.)
---
Normally I run Remember Me, Blood Warden, Nurses Calling and Thanatophobia, but once I reach red ranks I just can't get any further because my chase game is weak as fuck.
---
You don't even need to walk backwards. 
---
Just walk back a few steps during fatigue to break chase and then just don't look directly at them when you're close.
---
I'd use Trapper if he weren't so terrible. He doesn't have to be Billy/Nurse tier just not... You know... Terrible. Saboteur permanently destroying traps is complete and utter horse shit and the fact that the devs didn't correct this mistake is mind boggling. 
---
I mean, all you said was idiot, so that makes the report look like a giant pissbaby. 
---
When you run NOED
---
Git gud baby killer
---
Sounds like your screen resolution is wrong. I am not facing this issue.
---
*Yee-haw Intensifies*
---
well no because its motivated by furthering your gameplay to the point where they even have killer perks surrounding this type of strategy. so thatd be fine!!
---
You okay buddy? You seemed to have gone off the deep end there.
---
If we're ignoring the huge wall around sanctuary in the walking dead, that'd essentially be a clean version of lampkin lane. With the clean and charismatic negan coming after you with Lucille 
---
why don't you just drop them and attack the other survivors then
---
Does Thanatophobia even work with mending? I genuinely have no idea.
---
no, i never saw that killer again. and im not complaining, like i said, this was just an idea i was excited about. don’t assume things please.
---
Bodyblocking barely if ever works and usually ends with the whole team injured.
---
Go to the nearest hook and hit them if they get in the way, I dont get the problem people have with it 
---
Also reporting it is pointless its part of the game
---
You asked for a solution, they presented you with one
---
yeah it sucks
---
DBD is all about the chase, thats what people find fun about it. Also legions power lets him see all survivors so stealth doesnt even work anyway
---
You can tell by her half normal face that she had a beautiful square jawline, pair that with those blue eyes her height and some nice titties, she’s definitely a 10.
---
its literally cheating but ok
---
...like i said, im not whining, it was *just an idea*.
---
If it's a big problem for you maybe try using The Legion's Seconds Teachable Perk Mad Grit.
---
I actually don't know. I don't even know whether there is even a perk that affects mending.
---
Relax dude, it’s just a meme. 
---
Stop harassing people. It's just a game. Some survivors suck, some killers suck. that's just how it is. Keep talking trash and your ban will be longer next time or permanent.
---
toxic + toxic =/= untoxic
---
run Mad Grit.
---
now hear me out, it's very situational but when it works, it is the absolute funniest thing ever. they think that by bodyblocking they will help the survivor wiggle out BUT LITTLE DO THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE JUST MAKING EVERYTHING WORSE FOR EVERYONE, IT'S SO GOD DAMN FUNNY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHA
---
i’d blame it on the idiot survivor who unhooked you while the killer was right there
---
For me, he’s just a weaker hag. His traps just aren’t effective enough for me to want to run around the map replenishing traps all trial.
---
Don't worry, I did that too.
---
Let’s have a mafia leader killer that can summon members that can hunt down the survivors. The map could be his mansion haha.
---
What do you feel you suck at? Objectives, surviving, helping others? 
---
Spirit. But for some reason I love fengs lil booty too
---
I'm pretty sure some YouTubers have talked about giving the Legion 115 speed and they all say it's a bad idea. A small change like 5% movement speed can change a killer from ass to overpowered. Imo they should do a rework or what you suggested where the timer only goes down outside of a terror radius
---
Vynil 
---
Dear god how could you fuck up such an easy word.
---
I'm a budding Huntress, gimme a break. I'm trying to get away from more campy killers.
---
You mean kind of like if a killer in the PTB has an easy game and just completely wipes the floor with survivors, resulting in a 5gen 4k?
---
Seriously, though, it could be a good perk. I would agree to its constraints but you should only lose tokens for hitting your Obsession. 
---
You're an absolute madlad.
---
Never realized there is a bit of a nipslip going on there
---
Ty fam
---
They like to play ring around the rosie. I'm not sure why.
---
I'm not saying its hard but it isn't easy. If you're fighting 4 man's and saying they aren't very hard then you're either a pretty good killer or you're not fighting the toxic 4 man's that I'm talking about.
---
A legit strat for me is to go back to being a more camp-y killer.
---
Bodyblocking sucks but there's not much you can do when you're picking someone up and bring them to a hook. Only thing you can do is be aware of where other Survivors are and go to closest hook where they're not rushing to body block. 
---
Apparently devs want body blocking to be a thing because Survivors get points for doing this specific thing? Which doesn't break immersion at all. I don't know about you but my favorite scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre is when Leatherface is about to put the girl on the meathook and a bunch of people jump out of the woodwork and crouch in front of the hook and line up to take a hit so the girl can wiggle away. 
---
There's nothing you can do against body blockers not unless you use specific Killers. I.E. Billy (natch), Nurse, Leatherface (natch), Myers (with EW 3 ready to go), Legion and maybe Clown (just hit the blocker with the tonic and walk around him, not unless they blocked off a small entrance). 
---
I really hope you can continue making this for a lot of time op
---
great job!
---
I just checked, he has 9 devotion.
---
I live in California, and I'm also at Rank 1 as a Killer Main.
---
In the last couple weeks I've had several nights where I just kept playing the exact same people over and over again.
---
I assume its partially because PTB, partially because only the diehard fans are still playing this late into the month (with rank reset three days away and all) but it's definitely a thing I've been seeing.
---
It was an entire team of people juking me around, but thanks for being honest about it.
---
Huh. Weird.
---
That's pretty fucking stupid of them to be banning people because of curse words. This is not Club Penguin, it's a goddamn horror game with pretty brutal animations and aesthetics, but don't you dare call someone a fucker otherwise get banned.
---
At least I'm not a baby Myers! \*Bunny hops around\*
---
game is very consistent with its frames (depending your pc specs). should be a better experience
---
Ty for this fam. I will def use it
---
It does not affect mending. 
---
The survivors need to bring an item to use Franklins. Even then most items arent scary enough for it to be needed. Bloodhound lets you moonwalk with ease. 
---
No I know what you meant. It's totally fucking ridiculous. 
---
1) it requires you to have some kind of knowledge of why that one person is being targeted
---
2) it's asking the devs to make game rules about how players allocate their time and energy
---
3) it's maybe the whiniest shit of all fucking time. You're going to occasionally have a game like that. Fucking grow up and just move on oh my god. 
---
I did not. I asked for reason. Not solution. 
---
I tunnel them because they always talk shit. 
---
ANGRYPUG is both good and toxic at the same time.
---
You gave the reason 
---
I'm not saying they aren't very hard. They are. It's just you don't need to do well against them to pip up. I had a match today where the gens were done almost instanty and everyone escaped, but i safety pipped just because i hooked a few people. That's why i think pipping as killer is really easy. You don't need skill to get to rank 1 as killer. You just need to play a lot and you'll get there.
---
If it gets to that point, it's time to take a break. Whether it be a day a week or a month. This game has a lot of toxic players and sometimes you lose your cool. I get it. 
---
I've always thought she was beautiful in a sort of ethereal way. It's probably just the gold/metallic decorative clothing tho. 
---
"it's not against the rules"
---
I'd like to make you understand what makes you toxic, but I know I'd have better chances squeezing milk from a dead battery.
---
wait so you actually harassed a player for reporting you for something reportable and you have the fucking audacity to complain about killers "harassing" by spending 5 minutes on one person?
---
you fucking cancer
---
Prayer Beads aren't even that powerful. You're completely exaggerating their strength because you got outplayed by a high tier Killer using the one and only add-on that has this power, and it's very rare to acquire overall.
---
I might if you ask nicely
---
Bodyblocking as a bannable offense refers to if the killer or fellow survivor traps someone where they can't leave and holds the game hostage for no reason. What you described was not a bannable offense since you can either drop the one you have or if you have a carry related perk (Agitation, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit) you can counter it.
---
I'd say that they can be as toxic as survivors who are toxic, killers as a whole aren't toxic and neither are survivors. 
---
Not to mention OP has bragged about harassing people before for no reason so their post is horseshit in so many ways
---
They are super fun to throw, I highly recommend getting one. Make sure to sharpen it correctly so it sticks in the wood, it is safer that way.
---
Sometimes you're the windshield and sometimes you're the bug. It happens to the best of us. 
---
Holy shit you are sparking some kinks I never knew I had 
---
I don’t know, sometimes I can’t tell who did the most work, so that’s hard to tell! I know Quentin did some work but while I was on the last gen I saw him a few houses down (haddonfield) - possibly dodging the pig? Hiding? Not sure but he wasn’t on a gen lol 
---
I mean, the killer would know who was the weakest link for the most part, and I think at the end of the day we are all people in a chair/couch playing a game wanting to have fun, so I’m glad the killer stood up for the other teammates which reminded me of another game I had with a spirit - it was Mt Ormond, and he put down a mori. He messaged me and another player (2 of them had messages on private) and he said “it’s just an ivory, calm down”. The other player didn’t understand and just put a question mark and they replied “I’ll show you” but I said “I’m not scared!” Thinking he gets a lot of disconnects for putting a Mori down. He sees we got Ormond and says “oh you guys won this map sucks” and as I take out a Hex (haunted grounds) I got found first. Get unhooked and as I am doing a gen a Hallowed Blight Dwight comes and throws a pallet down right next to me and just stands there! Before I could move, the spirit comes and gets me and I’m Mori’d! I message in the chat for the other player to watch out, that Dwight set me up with that pallet drop and the killer focused on the Dwight and then asked me if I wanted him to camp him (and added F*ck that Dwight). I told him he didn’t have to, he’s the boss of the match so do whatever he wanted. He obviously didn’t need to camp, he 4k’d the entire team by the end of it.  It was a little sweet that the killer would understand those types of players lol
---
They have negative IQ points
---
If you get a 4K your trash
---
If you use a killer perk or strategy I don’t like your trash
---
These people don’t have a proper grasp on logic
---
No, at high ranks a lot can happen in 30 seconds. You'd be surprised how much a team of survivors can do to gens in 30 seconds. 
---
stop lying
---
&gt; its because he had to come to me to complain about my dc and try to get me BANNED (not reported, banned, which is excessive) 
---
Holy shit this is some of the worst entitlement I've ever seen on this subreddit
---
&gt; like i clarified, it isn’t applicable if he’s going after a surv because its the smartest play, its only applicable if hes ignoring better options and abandoning normal gameplay
---
lmfao it's not ignoring normal gameplay. It's subpar gameplay. Fucking christ you are a piece of fucking work.
---
The devs are not going to ban for this you goddamn baby
---
wow im slow i didny think of that sksksk
---
since theres four survivors, i dont think they can technically get bans for not doing stuff since theres other people who can still further gameplay. if it was in an instance where all the survivors were doing this, or there was only one survivor left and they were doing this, id consider this taking the game hostage since game progression counts solely on the players not doing anything. but since theres only one killer, if they dont further the game on their side theres not another killer thats able to swoop in and keep the game going in terms of fulfilling killer duties. i WISH you could punish survivors who do that since its stupid, but sadly it wouldnt work as well.
---
TTV is Mori bait. They know the rules, but they do it anyways.
---
Even when you lose as killer they call you shit, and if you win they call you shit. 😭
---
Leatherface's power helps little to nothing and relies on green addons, making him a m1 killer
---
what happens when you’re sleep deprived?
---
i like it, its very good
---
Frankly, if this keeps be at rank 8 or under, then I'm fine. That's generally the best rank to be at for mixing the skill levels of the teams.
---
okay so you just want your widdle special snowflake feelings catered to
---
Ain't nobody trying to wake the whole house up just to get 4000 points a game.
---
*Please give the Clown boob physics.*
---
I got a new disorder as well
---
It seems that I lose IQ points due to the stupidity of entitled players that don’t understand logic.
---
I dont think killer should get a bbq stack, except maybe for the points.  But killer doesnt need anymore advantage over survivors if its a 3v1.  3v1 is too easy for the killer as it is.
---
Eh, it's console. 360ing a Frenzying Legion can actually pay off. It's hard to land Frenzy strikes on console, y'know.
---
Its a shame the game is restricted to such an ugly engine/texture limit. Just like the blighted wraith skin, it won’t look nearly as good as it looks here
---
Jimmy is a wanker.

^^imlegitjustgoingtopurposefullytypoeverytimenow

like i said in the post, youre allowed to have your own opinion on it and can feel free to explain why it wouldnt work or its a bad idea but you dont need to be rude about it. and i dont understand why you cant separate that my petty revenge was not because he decided to take the action he was supposed to, its because of how rude he had to be about it.

At what rank level?
---
This is in general I guess, because piping is different for each color rank. 
---
You sound more like a salty survivor mian who gets called out on their lag switching.
---
Thats not what the post is about. The OP wanted to start a discussion on what tunneling is and if it should be reportable not to get attacked for being "whinny". What he did in the past doesnt affect this particular post. 
---
D O I T
---
And in the old system that it was a reflection of kills on the killer part and not blood points or blems, there was still complaining over needing a better ranking system. 
---
?
---
i didnt make this up for me, i was just suggesting an idea to help everyone else quit complaining about tunneling. once again, no. need. to. be. a. dick.
---
Isn't this a joke?
---
Legion can still be countered. This is the reality of the situation but Survivor Mains fervently reject this and keep spreading this propaganda: "Legion is un-fun! Legion breaks the game! Nerf now devs! NERF! NOW! DEVS! REEEE!" 
---
I admit, Legion is easier to use than Nurse but the balance is that it takes longer to down someone when compared to Nurse and Legion doesn't have map control either. This is how you counter Legion:
---
Use Sprint Burst. Done. I can't catch you now. I a Legion player chases someone with Sprint Burst they're going to waste insane amounts of time. 
---
Jungle gyms can still allow you juke Legion. Same with Pallets. Legion still has to respect a pallet. Legion players need to use both Sketch Books in order to counter the juke but that means no Frank's Mixtape. 
---
Alternatively you can just do the gens. Legion still gets gen rushed. All the crying about moon walking is laughable. Like, I don't even need to do with Legion. I can just stab your ass, look away (and break a pallet) and then still follow your piddly little ass with Blood Hound and your ass is still going to go down. But I still need to put your ass on the hook 2 more times to finally kill you and that still gives your team plenty of time to get gens done.
---
Stop crying about Legion. Stop crying about "moon walking" because it's not going to get fixed because it's not an issue. The people bitching and moaning about Legion are no doubt the same people who bitched and moaned about Freddy last year until they got their way. It's not happening this time, buddy boys. 
---
I've come to notice that red ranks have a lot of good survivors, but no teabag gets or flashlight clickers. Basically, no ochido fan boys. Reason being; they're too bad to play against good killers so they bully mediocre ones. This post is 100% true.
---
thats why ive learned to be more zen about things that seem unfair. unlike a lot of people in my comments.
---
Typical survivor main behavior. You’ll get used to it
---
You're all sensitive if you're here to cry about my post. You survivor memes could have just ignored it. But just like in the game, here you are to troll.
---
I feel bad for people who are so bored they spend their lives trolling 😐
---
Oh yeah sorry didn’t know what you meant 
---
Steam-PC, if you look at the picture of this post you see the achievement pop up for PC called Legendary Survivor 
---
you dont have to be rude buddy
---
oh fuck off the devs are never going to make it bannable for the killer to try too hard to get one person no matter how much you piss and cry
---
… You ARE Alpharad, aren't you?
---
Those are the minority of Christians BTW.
---
They deserve it for being follower whores anyways.
---
gg when you win
---
salt when you lose
---
I wouldn't say he's good. He hovers around green/purple ranks, if I remember correctly. Not to mention he mainly plays SWF, so he's got full coordination. But yeah, definitely the most toxic shit bag out there, for sure. 
---
lol
---
No you're trying to force your piss baby feelings into the game
---
Yeah I'm going to be rude about it. I'm so fucking sick of entitlement and this is some of the worst I've ever seen
---
I can confirm a lot of this, however I think all add-ons that effect the size, effect, and duration of the gas cloud itself is far above being able to use the Tonic more.
---
You don't have to be a fucking baby, buddy
---
I would love a DLC on FNAF
---
Adept killers are where the real struggle is
---
Yeah, lag switching is relatively common. Obviously though, if you come here and wonder about if you can hack, you’ll be safe from any ban. 
---
When one of your teammates is running Urban
---
Please no I would shit my survivor pants
---
Yeah maybe, definitely a perk you might slam on after getting camped
---
I mean, a BBQ stack is just a stack. It dont give you any advantage.
---
Killers used to have a system (up to last year) based on kills.
---
It was changed since there was a ton of complaining. 
---
Mostly from survivor side. Basically once a killer found and downed you, your game as survivor was done. Tunneling and camping would happen to ensure the killer got a kill.
---
Yes that IS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO PIP IN THAT SYSTEM. 
---
However, that gameplay style is un-fun to survivor generally as well as it makes games uninteresting.  That is why a system based solely on kills will fail. While not toxic, the behavior it caused also lead to the lowest player period of DBDL. 
---
Not just that, survivors will 100% abandon any hooks after the exit gates are powered due to a camping killer to secure a kill vs the fun risky plays we see now.
---
He's competent, I'll give him that. But if he mainly sticks to provoking lower rank killers, he'll never improve, and strategies that work on rank 10 killers most likely won't work on rank 1. He's also been responsible for many witch-hunts on people who tunnel, camp or mori him. That's more or less where the toxicity comes from, not to mention he's a massive man-child. Arde's video sums him up pretty well if you wanted to check that out. 
---
Damn then idk what’s up Kate’s the only character in this game who isn’t ugly as fuck
---
The objective of the game is what bhvr says is the objective.
---
You have 4 objectives in this game since that is what BHVR wants to have. Killing and escaping are not your only objective.
---
Yes you can. Very risky and do not reccomend.
---
I think you have the right idea bit I completely disagree that stealth isn’t valued, the amount I have gotten done because the killer didn’t known was there is staggering, and I don’t even run stealth perks. Plus you make $$$ in terms of the evader emblem compared to chases, so stealth can really help you improve your score with much less risk.
---
Any perk is good on nurse.
---
It's a crutch. 
---
Incredibles 4 da win!!!!
---
Happy mic day
---
if they waste your time it's a viable reason to camp them.
---
I'm already liking Corrupt Intervention. Corrupt Intervention on some maps could effectively force Survivors towards you in the early game and make it easier to facilitate 3 Generator Strategies for the late game. Think about how effective this could be on Killers like Trapper, Hag, and Doc. It would buy a serious amount of time and allow you to set up so much more easily. It would more easily allow you to defend Hexes, run interference, and just apply more pressure in general. All in all, really looking forward to using it. 
---
I appreciate that, but I tend to not delve too deep into things like that. He's good enough to be entertaining to watch every now and then and that's about as far as I care to take it. 
---
I didn't know he was encouraging players to harass other players in the game. I'm not a fan of that at all. 
---
shhhhh they can't know i'm really bubba LUL
---
Which is also fine. Do you brother.
---
You will never convince me that a wraith is a chill individual. Those guys bm and camp more than Leatherface. 
---
I use them on either cosmetics for a character I actually like or I use them to buy perks.
---
I had a survivor once claim he was gonna get his friend at behaviour to ban be for falsely reporting him being toxic and called me a fag. I’m still a little stunned at their brain capacity.
---
#COME BACK HERE 
---
Not like they can stab you in the locker. They'd have to end their Frenzy and pull you out.
---
From what you've said, I think Doctor or Spirit for the killer (or maybe wait for Plague). I believe they all have mindgame elements to them, as well as average-to-good map control. 
---
For survivor, probably Jeff (Distortion is great for stealth, Aftercare can boost survivability when playing solo, Breakdown is meh) or maybe Adam (Deliverance for survivability, Autodidact is mediocre and altruistic, Pebble is a meme).
---
I'm 3 pips away from my first rank 1 survivor but literally every other high ranked PS4 killer just tunnels me off the hook. By the way, I'm rank 1 on PS4, and don't tunnel.

---
No perk affects mending as it’s not considered a healing action and is instead treated as its own unique thing. 
---
If all of the fountains are corrupt I believe they all reset.
---
I love the idea, but I wouldn't go quite so far. I do agree though that he needs more traps to not only spawn but he at least needs to carry one or two extra on his arm in his base kit (the Stitched Bag especially I envision as being a sort of quiver slung over his back). 
---
But I think to carry all of them at once would be a little much. 
---
If it’s one of the killers that just stand there and swing then I let them down me and I lay there underneath him until i bleed out
---
How are you maxing out altruism is they’re afk...?
---
Killers can nod at survivors, shake their head at them, hit them on hook, mori spam, spam their ability, facecamp, bleed survivors out, and they are also very much capable of taking the game hostage. There are also killer-specific ways of "griefing", such as for instance a Pig following a trapped survivor crouched, until they inevitably die, spamming roars at them, all the while... or yet - and this is a personal favourite of mine - a Freddy with Rancor following their Obsession all game, without pulling them into the Dream Realm, perhaps continuously or intermittently swinging at them, only to sleep and mori them as soon as all gens are done.
---
There's really no shortage of things killers can do solely to try and make some survivor(s) have a bad time for no greater purpose but to. I do think you are right that survivors are commonly perceived to be more unpleasant due to there being four of them for every one killer. What I think might be the biggest factor is that a survivor's way of griefing is usually more capable of making fun of the killer player's performance and skills, which feels more personal. Because let's be real, people rarely actually care about being teabagged or flashlighted at if it is not combined with being unable to catch those survivors, with losing the game, getting beat, outplayed. If survivors on the other hand get outplayed, the chase is just over, so even if it might feel bad to get nodded at or something, at that point, it's not like you are being taunted while still having to exert the very same effort that is being ridiculed, in a way of "try and get me, you can't". This can be perceived as extra stressful and mocking.
---
Neither. I’m currently running:
---
-Adrenaline
---
-Dead Hard
---
-Resilience
---
-Deliverance (I switch this for iron will if I’m facing a lot of spirits)
---
So what you're saying is that normal chasing is too hard and you should take advantage of the injured survivor who could easily have borrowed time? If you go after the injured survivor than the one that save can easily get back on a gen and not worry about healing or anything like that
---
Can she vomit in a random locker and block your entrance there?
---
1 or 2 extra, yeah. Besides, having them spawn around the map also is part of the use to the almighty Iridescent Stone. Sometimes, they can spawn so optimally it's like "damn, wish I'd thought of that." 
---
Dying to a killer that’s 14 ranks below you must be a new record
---
Tunneling: ignoring certain survivors to specifically target one survivor
---
Ah, most AFK killers have that macro where they just swing constantly. Obviously if they’re not doing that it would be a bit difficult :p
---
to specifically target one HEALTHY survivor despite having *better options*. their best option in that case is a free down
---
If you play killer I would go for bamboozle instead. But yeah, adrenaline is one of the best survivor perks.
---
Lol interesting move. I’ve seen killers do that though as an endgame strat, with the exception of coming alive and hooking people downed. (No ed usually) Super old strat tho.
---
I'm on PS4
---
I agree mostly. He definitely needs the glory of a high tier killer. Your idea of him actually being faster (say, 120% movement speed) when not weighed down is an excellent idea. 
---
I still think that there should be some difficulty and time management to using him, but in his current state he's sadly a little too weak without add-ons. 
---
I also think he should get at least 1 extra trap in his base kit. Dude could totally carry more than one on those beefy arms of his. 
---
hi
---
Serves them right for trying to farm you. 
---
Yea, body blocking the killer isn't reportable. That's referring to survs body blocking other survs while being chased. Its a legit strat for survivors. The best thing you can do is drop who your carrying and start throwing some hatchets. If they are all body blocking they aren't on gens and that's good for you. Or fake a pickup to bait them to run up then chase.
---
the perk comparison between the rank 1 and rank 15 weighs more than some arbitrary number next to their names. Be toxic in the game, not the subreddit ✌🏻
---
i could be wrong but it seems the entire toxic element of this community seems to stem from survivors vs killers saying shit about each other. its a big enough deal to where its leaking into dbd communities and everyone attacks everyone else over the assumption that everything is an attack against killers or survivors. no one can take anything at face value. its quite annoying.
---
I can't stop laughing. So good!
---
"*The*" game objectives as in those things - among the indeed various things one could be trying to achieve in the context of a trial - that people regularly actually care about. Killer players usually want to sacrifice survivors, survivor players usually want to escape the killer. These are the fundamental "goals" the game is built around, and the Emblems very much are built around those core goals, as well - it's just that they are way too lenient and render the ranking system a farce, leading to wildly uneven matches.
---
Since the Emblems are built around those core goals, the Emblem system could be adjusted to actually be tough enough to prevent hordes of bad players from playing at the highest ranks, sure, but I don't see why we need all that complexity for something that is ultimately exclusively about match-making.
---
Mods do stuff like that sometimes. I was making posts about how broken SWFs are on console and they started taking them down for "spam".
---
If you like mindgames as killer then spirit would probably be right up your alley, her power has a lot of trickery potential, for example you can stand still right after they drop a pallet and they might slide back to you if they think you are phasing,
---
Also i would get a killer, most of the really good perks and stealth perks are on free characters and killers offer a new playstyle
---
sorry i was trying to help my boyfriend who got reddit like five minutes ago find my account. this was the easiest way. 😂
---
last should have been she's kinky
---
What does that have to do with what killer you should buy?
---
A bbq stack is just bonus bloodpoints, doesn’t give any advantage
---
a FAIR play would be going after the unhooker.
---
a SMART play would be going after the unhooked.
---
i wish theyd choose the fair play but i cant be mad at them for choosing the smart play.
---
Should have been but how could you have rhymed Grace and Kinky?
---
Truth
---
oh was its supposed to rhyme my b
---
I'll do it :)
---
Any for a good ol doc main here?
---
Yeah I’m on console too, everything on it is pretty broken, this post got taken down again lmaooo
---
People play efficiently or attempt to, very rarely will a group of randoms run borrowed time. And it's not taking advantage when someone's stupid enough to unhook in the middle of the chase. Also read what I said before trying to be a little kid. 
---
It's funny how they look and t-bag 
---
I’ve had late night games with friends (we are all in the green ranks) where we always face rank 20s and 19s. Really messed up match making system. I would hate having that done to me on killer. 
---
Killers definitions of toxic are really confusing a lot of the time. Shit like emoting, Looping, playing swf, using exhaustion perks, other good perks, and gen rushing (which is the most baffling). 
---
That 1 survivor 
---
Hey that's illegal 
---
D: report
---
She can vomit on all of them if she wants, and then when you enter it you get sick.
---
It’s a legit tile 
---
When does the new chapter come out?!
---
Person on the hook probably screaming because all they see is you getting in and out of lockers
---
This was EAC that's him
---
She’s gorgeous
---
She’s grace
---
She’ll fuck you any place
---
What if getting stunned too much made the killer turn into a little doll ? 
---
I used to run Bond but i traded it for Aftercare, it's so good tool as a solo survivor to communicate with your team across the map.
---
Might be an asshole but playing smart is the best way to win as a killer especially at red ranks. 
---
Man I feel sorry for that plague. So many lockers to check lol. Might as well just leave and go find another guy
---
Lol basically.         
---
Survivors: Killer perks are too op, Killers are too op, Having to do gens is op, Life is op.

Also Survivors: He’s afking and giving us a free win? BAN HIM!

You’ll get more BP if you don’t mori them or mori them on last hook
---
Ok sorry I have no respect for you sir :(. Tunneling to get kills is scummy, and if you are in red ranks you should be good enough to get kills without it, right? You can play however you want, you're just a dick for it.

It's always a David running WGLF but not borrowed time

How exactly do you "get viewers naturally"? There are literally hundreds of people playing DBD on twitch at any given time. How is a 0 viewer stream supposed to stand out in the first place? You have to do some self-promotion, and advertising in-game isn't the worst idea. I've followed a couple of streamers after having a match with them and hopping into their stream. It's not a bad idea.
