Haha your right I hadn't thought of that factor on top.
---
---
---
It's super effective against Freddy I heard but doesn't affect Michael
---
Yup. Trying to understand an issue isn't trying to excuse it.
---
It's not that they specifically chose to wait until the last minute to announce the delay. They only found out about it at that last minute because of a series of other, probably equally stupid, choices.
---
If you‚Äôre into dark souls, rank 1 is for you.  I find green and purple enjoyable.
---
Yeah but what's in kyf doesn't really matter in the main game. I just mean it's unavailable where it matters
---
Takes about 10 minutes for me
---
60 bucks worth of content with more than 50% locked behind a paywall.. a grinding worse than any mmo I know
---

---
Sure buddy. I spent way less for way more content in other games, as big as BHVR if not smaller than them
---
You can white knight them all you want but their system is a f2p system with pay to win content (perks behind paywall) and the battle pass just make it more clear
---
I've seen more f2p with less content locked behind a paywall than this game, that you have to pay to play
---
Play the game, get BP, use it on new offering, play the game more as you now get extra BP, level up while playing more, get serums for leveling up to certain levels, rinse repeat.
---
It's really not that funny guys
---
I would rather have double blood points
---
i think some platforms have longer killer queues but an hour is insane.. I play on Xbox and it takes less than 7 minutes, survivor less than two minutes. Maybe people are playing more killer at the moment because of the event?
---
Spine chill is a great perk. In fact, I often run spine chill and resilience together for the +15% vault speed.
---
Same for me... I was counting on this new patch to solve everything but apparently they're not going to fix it so soon
---
You know damn well this game will die the instant something else comes along that does it better, most stream games have a shelf life of 5 years tops. This will not come anywhere close to Team Fortress 2 in longevity, at least 3 promising games in the genre are about to be released as it is thats going to give it a run for its money if BVHR doesn't get off its ass. This game just shows how terrible humanity is as a whole when such a large amount of you claim you would leave the game if they balanced SWF bullshit.
---
if they were shirtless you would be totally ruined
---
Nice
---
Wish fengs mask would be worn on her face as opposed to back of the head.
---
Its like concept art from the devs. Very nice
---
Damn, you beat me to it. Lol
---
A little here and there. Gets easier once you get your first t3 tbh.
---
Slugging for a 4K is literally what you have to do to guarantee a 4th kill. The Hatch is pure RNG and the Killer has to risk losing a 4K because of a poorly thought out hatch mechanic. But just "don't complain" after getting denied your hard work because a survivor got lucky.
---
Just because it will happen doesn't mean you have to like it happening and can't tell people to not do it.
---
FunWorld actually owns both lol
---
Ghost face is 100% A with the new way of playing him and billy is probably more b tier
---
I thought I was the only one
---
Thank you! That's the wrong mindset though, if you want it, you just have to practice a shitload! :')
---
I don't remember the Telletubbies as all purple? Weren't they 4 and each was a different color?
---
I'm a very big Halloween fan. I have seen them, so yeah, the blond version definitely came from those.
---
Oscar is low-key trash
---
Why do you think that robe is so...extensive...in the front there?
---
It's because the third survivor was blocking the hand and names of the fourth survivor messing with a killer's information in lobby this change was in the patch notes.
---
Allright that makes more sense just wish it was clearer for people how the offering functions. 
---
It says it stacks but I thought it was stacking in sets of 1000 and I've been on since the update went live and hardly seen any being used. 
---
I'm guessing the confusion isnt localised to just me. Be good if they could update the description of the item to incentivise people to use them as if your the only one popping them they're still fairly useless.
---
This shouldn‚Äôt be controversial this is better for the game lol
---
I guess that makes sense
---
Same here Michael Myers is definitely my favorite slasher of all time
---
That shit is A1!
---
I get your point and I'll partly agree with it (that Freddy nerf right after his chapter released was pretty uncalled for imo) but don't you think you're over reacting a little?
---
My point was you get higher bonuses from common offerings than you do from the event item assuming your a decent player and that's only the common offerings and as for green offerings, party streamers or escape cakes even more so.
---
If they're purposely running this shrine to help with beginning the rift, then BBQ will be on the Switch's shrine soon. LF and Freddy's teachables are available via the Shrine and the Shrine only for now.
---
Nurse behind Billy and nightmare? Ok I won't take this seriously
---
Immediately run out when you see the bloodwarden spikes, the killer has aura reading on you
---
*has like 1 million rift fragments*
---
Only on PC.
---
Rift closes in 69 days
---
...
---
You're rank 20. Do you actually believe that you're supposed to slaughter people by playing properly when you clearly don't have the experience in the game to do so yet? Not to mention only have a player level of 16. You're brand new to the game and still green.
---
One bad apple can ruin a bunch but I was appreciative of the other 3 survivors who downplayed the toxic survivor. I went out of my way to avoid downing someone if they were just unhooked and would try to hit the person who saved them instead. I went out of my way to avoid going after someone if I saw they were going to lead me around in a circle with a pallet.  
---
With some people, you just can't win.
---
I mean I could, I was just drawing this between wait times
---
There‚Äôs always going to be some kind of meta in any competitive game unfortunately. Players are really good at figuring out how to break stuff.
---
Unforseen circumstances.
---
well tbf the victims of his in the movies (the ones hd actually kills) were teens of the parents that killed him, they didnt do anything to freddy
---
Yea, I tend to show mercy when there are early dcs, it's good manners. I can be merciless at times though too. Doctor can be so oppressive haha.
---
 "lol generator" üòÇ
---
What does that even mean? Should I resort to camping and tunneling? That's the impression your post gives me. I didn't think I would actually sacrifice anyone while I'm getting used to mouse and keyboard and playing on PC. I just didn't imagine that someone would still throw piss and vinegar at me for trying to be a morally decent Killer.
---
If Jason's own game no longer has permission to do anything with what makes you think DBD could use him?
---
Only pc has dedicated servers
---
Repost
---
Same thing happens to me.  I'm also on xbox one.
---
The shrine let's players pick up teachable perks from characters without unlocking them through levelling or purchasing a dlc.
---
So bbq is a perk for leatherface now you've got it from the shrine you don't have to buy leatherface to unlock the perk. üëç
---
I was going to make this exact meme last week and I thought it wouldn't get updoots
---
/r/titlegore
---
Lol almost. You either did or you didnt. Good on you for being a good sport.
---
Haha I can‚Äôt stop laughing, where did you find a picture that crazy???
---
Please answer my question above I‚Äôd love to print it and make copies
---
The Shrine is random 4 perks for sale which change every week. The shrine gives you a chance to get a specific perk that you desire (if you're lucky) without having to buy the killer, say for example you want bbq but dont want to buy bubba, well the shrine gives you a chance for that.
---
Whipped around that corner ready for smacking
---
I loved old Freddy. He was not shit. He actually made some matches challenging, though I would still 3/4K most. New Freddy reminded me how generally easy, boring, unfairly balanced this game is playing killer.
---
Beause it spawns more hooks and gens. Read the offering.
---
It changed when they launched the update today.
---
Cosmetic
---
But is the cool fire/entity effect back to what it used to be?. -. I miss that effect
---
What that means is don't complain about people escaping and you losing the game because you're still learning. Don't sit there and face camp people just to make sure you feel like you've won when in fact you're gonna be the biggest loser in the match. Must be loads of fun hanging out around the hook or watching someone die that isn't actively participating in the match.
---
No one is good at this game when they're new. You're not gonna sit there and watch some mediocre streamers and youtube videos and think you're the holy god of this game. You have to actually play the game and learn how to read people. 
---
You're over here complaining that you lost because you played fairly when the fact is you're still new to be efficient in chases yet. Camping hooks to make you feel better about the match must be the most exciting gameplay you've ever had huh?
---
[removed]
---
grammar is important people!
---
haha yes
---
Are you sure you claimed your rewards after you completed two unhooks?
---
it‚Äôs a 0% hit because they‚Äôll run away
---
No one is adding shit you fucktard. I've edited typos and nothing else. Be mad and assume more please. üëåüèª
---
I'm not expecting anything, I'm pointing out a flaw in logic.
---
Yeah, it glitched for a second but then I backed out and went back in and both are bright blue now.
---
Exactly! Everytime I run self care (without iron will) the killer almost always hears me then downs me. At least when someone else is healing you they can take the hit, slow down the killer for a sec while you both have a better chance of getting to a loop
---
Hm, I‚Äôm not sure then, you should report it as a bug
---
Simple. John Carpenter added the brother and sister thing at the last moment of Halloween II but He didn't like it and in the newest movie they cut the family ties. Laurie is just a babysitter that got stalked by the boogeyman. Halloween 2018 fixes the canon up since the other stories also have a weird cult story.
---
Boo! Okay, thanks dude!
---
I just make it clear I'm down to farm to the survivors if I have a daily with a non-main killer. They get points, I get my daily, we all have a good time.
---
Man I really wanted thanataphobia
---
The Shadow
---
Nope
---
Honestly I wouldn't even blame a PC player for not noticing since the lag on dedicateds is actually worse than what I experienced on P2P.
---
Sorry, I don't do deep meme lore
---
Its sexy
---
With a garden section (green house) would be killer!
---
The skins in the battle pass look really underwhelming
---
This! Hehehehe

What "I think" happed? K. I must be wrong. Dude got 500000000 bloodpoints 4 kills and no one left alive. I mean, it's not like it isn't there in the picture for proof or anything. Oh wait, it is. You don't need to be in a match to see 4 escapes and him having less than 14k points while everyone else exceded 20k points. Thus he feels like he's failed. But hey, I must not know because I wasn't there and obviously there isn't a picture of the end game results of what happened in that match.
---
Ah, enjoy the slightly less painful grinding. I don't know where I'd be at without BBQ. I've only played Leatherface once, with a splinter offering too, and he's just so boring. You can never hit anything with your chainsaw, and it's not helpful in loops, so you're just sitting there being a literal m1 killer with no other redeeming qualities.
---
Yeah it's still viable but why did they bump it down from 15 seconds to 8 :-(
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
I....see no rift or archives.....
---
That's a rare perk

Good killers shouldn't run to completed gens, waste of time and gen pressure.

Any idea how to report a bug? Never had to before.

So that was a fucking lie
---
Lmao you're dumb as hell dude, take your foot out of your mouth then maybe think about it again. How are you this braindead yet you're calling others dumb?

Hey that's cool man, just looking for someone who will do gens and go for saves, I'm only rank 8 myself. I'll add you when I'm back on in a few mins

Nice strawman, I never said who spend money are cows but that terminology is used to describe people with ton of money to throw, aka Cash cow. Are you that stupid to not understand or just act in bad faith?
---
Btw I'm broke just because I don't wanna pay for a battle pass and aggressive marketing to make you pay more than I already did with the dlcs? Wow.. dude you're so delusional

If I'm stupid just for that, then what are you for not understanding simple things like the concept of "Cash cow"?

Platform: PC

Type of bug: In game
---
Description:  Nurse Lethal Blink ritual not completing.
---
Steps to Reproduce: Have the ritual and hit 4 survivors with a lethal blink.
---
Expected result: Mission complete
---
Actual Result: Mission failed. Can't get them next time either.
---
Reproduction Rate: completed with at least 12 lethal blinks over two games, nothing.  Don't really enjoy playing the Nurse so not trying for more reproductions.
---
Specs: Irrelevant.
---
I installed maybe two weeks ago default is M1 item use is M2.
---
Not really, it's just I think that's how they will act if they keep acting as they did all this time
---
I hope to be wrong and be made fun of by thinking this. I do
---
It was a Billum
---
I think the Hatch is just fine. As you said, neither side is entitled to an escape/4k. If a vulnerable survivor is up against a much faster killer all by themself, they deserve the hatch if they find it first: It's in the 110/115% movement speed, doesn't need to hide killer's favour after all.
---
Wait didn‚Äôt a shrine just come out with ruin and thanataphobia?
---
In the video you can see that the last blink wasn't fully charged costing the Nurse about 2 seconds so the time is way closer to a 115% killer
---
Personally? I don‚Äôt care about post game chat much. Shit happens, people are shitty, move on with the day. However it‚Äôs perfectly normal, and human, to want to vent to an unbiased audience. I get why people make posts like this.
---
Also, wouldn‚Äôt shaming another player require the players name to be mentioned? Not really sure if it counts towards shaming an anonymous person, but who knows. I‚Äôve seen plenty of posts like this, so? If that‚Äôs not the rule you‚Äôre talking about then I‚Äôm just oblivious.
---
Though it is also 1AM and that is my excuse. Lmao.
---
You can cleanse the totem
---
No edits or anything i just noticed it after a game\^ i restarted and its all good now
---
But the timer doesn‚Äôt imidiatly starts when you‚Äôre hooked , most pig plays I‚Äôve seen and done usually they get it off before the trap activates and most teams don‚Äôt do gens to let the person get the hat off
---
Pros:Big Boi does chomp
---
Cons:
---
Just in case anyone wants to know, I wasn't tunneling. This Dwight just happened to always be in front of me (probably trying to provoke a chase tbh)
---
Yeah, mistake on my part. But she does slow down while charging the blink, so I believe it averages out a bit below 115%.
---
I never once said he did in THAT match. Are y'all really this stupid? The ONE MATCH he admits, IN THE TITLE to NOT camping hooks or tunneling and he still feels defeated for playing properly just cause of some salty bitch. What's it like being on a first grade reading comprehensive level? I suppose I could ask my 6 year old but she would only be able to explain it in terms only another 1st grader would understand.
---
wtf
---
You'd think I'd hate the indoor maps as a Ghostface main. Means less places to hide, right?
---
Yet, somehow, I seem to have a very high success rate on them with him. :thonking:
---
Lmfao dude you really are dumb as hell.
---
Did you even read the post?
---
When it's practically every match I've gone against today it gets very frustrating. During an event I pretty much only see keys, moris, derankers, comm squads, and other means of ruining the game.
---
Doesn't help that I play both sides and deal with the shittiest of each. For example teammates that go down to Leatherface instantly after I had been looping him for 5 minutes. They will then attempt to wiggle off the hook and die.
---
I had both final survivors down one match. They were right next to each other. I get rotten Fields every time I play Freddy. As I'm killing one the other one is right at my feet and the hatch spawns during the animation. I brought an ivory Mori because that one specific Survivor was a streamer. They were made animation when I swung. If the hatch grab was still a thing it would be GG. But nope. I had to deal with that Survivor trash-talking me in the post game chat. Personally though I see the hatch as a reward for failing to do the objective. If you have to take the hatch I don't believe it is a win. Especially when you depip
---
Don't worry, if you sed a feng with a red dress, ill for sure heal you for stacks on my autodidact

Title doesn't state he camps or tunnels or anything of that kind. You really should learn your reading comprehension before trying to call out others lmao.
---
Wait, what‚Äôs up with kindred? I use it all the time when I go solo
---
Other than Dead Hard, I've had an overall positive experience with them.

to program and develop a videogame?
---
I'm gonna take a shot in the dark and guess that you haven't actually played Dark Souls
---
Oh botha!
---
What are you playing on?
---
The fact that this guy procreated is disturbing on many levels. I feel sorry for his child if he rages like this about video games on the Internet. Poor girl.
---
I actually do heal people when they start selfcaring next to my gen
---
I just try and play the game, not like every other asshole that plays a survivor
---
PC/Steam
---
Interesting idea but I think seeing him die once was sad enough without seeing it over and over again. The walking dead games were more about the story then the gore.

Did you read his?

Your entire post is made irrelevant because to counter NOED all you need to do is cleanse all 5 totems in a match.
---
BAM.
---
NOED never even activates now and the killer ran 3 perks the entire game and wasted a slot on NOED.
---
But no, please go on about how UNFAIR NOED is after that.....
---
A furry? That's the scariest thing I can think of.
---
Yes.
---
Thars exactly what i did in case its because of its pre rework daily
---
Self care is a net positive for the killer for as long as it takes. It's such a waste of time and any killer in the purple or red ranks would love if all the survivors ran it.
---
For 14 days over 365 bbq was available.. I guess "shrine" isn't really a good excuse for it
---
Idc about the post game chat when the relevance you've put on the post was the title followed by the picture. Chat is irrelevant in you feeling defeated.

Oh no someone said words on the internet let's pretend that's the main focus on why I feel bad getting no kills and no points. Sure thing pal.

Good

This looks like the builder from clash of clans

Maybe it's your timing?

Yeah, this has nothing to do with my internet. I‚Äôm hardwired in with 70mbs at least. Maybe it‚Äôs just PS4 and their spaghetti code

I cannot wait until this is in the game!

They mentioned it on dev stream. After the server is dropped, they will be able to fix it easily

They already acknowledge the problem

Halloween is totally Survivor sided, it makes them play better because they rush the Gens now.

As someone who has like several hunderds of hours on Nurse, I personally think that he rework is the best thing they could've done with her. And on top of that, in a rather simple way.
---
* Her roaming has suffered a lot thanks to the recharge requierement.
---
* A Nurse being successfully mindgame'd by Survivors, suffer a much harder penalty, as they won't be able to recover the track as fast due to the recharge requierement
---
* Nurse has lost lots of pressure due to the fact that her roaming suffered as well. BBQ on Nurse has suffered due to that aswell. Which's tough considering that she is the Killer who benefits the most from the aura reading.
---
* You can't exceed 2 blinks anymore without a quite heavy handicap, rendering her much more fair in general. Simply because she can't recover from failed blinks as fast.
---
* Thanks to this, experienced Survivors might render a mediocre Nurse almost uncapable of applying any pressure. Considering I personally can also withstand pretty good Nurse's for quite long as a Survivor, it's not as tough as it sounds once you have the know-how. Mindgaming and knowing how to abuse specific tiles and structures is everything when it comes up to being chased by her.
---
* Nurse was always extremely vulnearable against stealth. A Nurse that can't find someone by herself, can't do shit. Many other Killers have a certain benefit within their abillity when it comes up to finding Survivors. Nurse, Billy and Spirit simply don't due to their high mobillity. Which is also the reason why tracking and / or anti-stealth perks were and are always the best thing to do as a good Nurse.
---
* Fatigue reducing and Chain Blink Window increasing Add-Ons suffer as both of them are counterproductive when being put into consideration with her new charging system. A reduced fatigue duration doesn't change the fact that you have to wait for your blinks. A increased Chain Blink Window increases the time that has to pass until blinks start to recharge. Since there are no charge speed increasing Add-Ons anymore, there's no way to synergize a increased Chain Blink Window properly with another Add-On.
---
* Nurse still has a total of 5 Add-Ons that either cause a reduced fatigue duration in some way, or increases the chain blink window. In addition she has two Add-Ons with a massive handicap that ain't worth using at all (the +100% BP in xy category types). In addition there are also Add-Ons that are more meme than being useful (Tracer Recall, Kavanagh's Last Breath iirc) or Add-Ons that ain't consistent enough for the effect that is supposed to be provided (Bad Mans Keepsake). Overall, almost 50 % of her Add-Ons are still dead despite the fact the they've been reworked just now.
---
I just made a post about this very topic. Nurse and her Add-Ons I mean. I won't post a link since I don't know if it is against the "Reddiquette" but I'd be grateful if someone that actually cares about the new Nurse to take a look at it.
---
Much obliged for the post anyway &lt;3
---
Absolutely, thank you so very much for taking your invaluable time to respond to my comment. Cheers to you my good sir and with that I bid you g‚Äônight.
---
Looks really cool
---
Bubba needs to be S++ for his moaning in bed
---
Did us one better tbh, gonna be chasing that **exposed** booty as survivor now üòè
---
oh holy shit that fucking banana
---
LMAO
---
Why do these even exist? Event hooks and gens dont even have a vial associated with them like the nectar did (at least I dont see a vial) if I want more bloodpoints i can just run a survivor pudding or escape cake. Unless these give more bloodpoints than those? In that case I highly doubt they give any more than bloody party streamers anyways.
---
well she might be annoying but we are talking about sexiness
---
It's pretty generous of them to begin with really. Grind for 2 and then buy the other one
---
Some people dont have free time to lost one hour waiting sorry i have a life
---
You have to unhook 2 survivors in 1 game. The meter is for how many times you have achieved it. So 0/1.  If it was unhook 2 survivors in a single match 5 times, it‚Äôd be 0/5. Not whatever you think it‚Äôd be. It‚Äôs basic knowledge you‚Äôre just misunderstanding
---
idk what‚Äôs up with this bug lol. i sacrificed a claudette on that hook, she died, but she just kept crying i guess
---
This is easily my favorite cosplay AND costume this Halloween
---
Devs need to get the fuck off their asses and fix the DC issues, ban them for a day if they dc a game
---
no ones sexier  than daddy myers with him id get to be the clown and lick more than his finger
---
The hatch is already favoring the killer.
---
He can close it faster than you can get in it. And on top of that, killer has the advantage on the race to find it.
---
Then add on top of THAT, that he can simply slug P3 while searching for P4 and/or the hatch to deny a hatch escape.
---
In the RARE opportunity that a survivor gets a LUCKY hatch escape since EGC was introduced, they deserve it. Because the odds are AGAINST them getting it.
---
So any killers complaining about survivor hatch escapes are REALLY friggin whiney and entitled babies.
---
*"But what about bullshit keys????? Huh????"*
---
Sorry, i couldn't hear you over your Ebony Mori's ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
yes, its makes the game more random, which actually lowers the skill ceiling.
---
Yup.  We definitely need an avoid player function like Overwatch.  This game attracts assholes.
---
Get a recording of it and post on the forums.
---
Good.
---
Freehand meaning I drew it while looking at a picture on my phone... I didnt trace
---
Leatherface. Rank S. Right now.
---
That sweat stain on his back is such a turn on, he's dripping with sexiness. Them massive forearms, that manly ass jog, them tight jeans, whats not to like?
---
Hex:Ruin is in the shrine rn and Pop Goes the Weasel was in the shrine last week. Both will slow them down.
---
You perfectly summed up my attitude towards this game. Try not to but will if I have to and I'm happy with two kills.
---
Putting effort into something and wanting to be recognized for that? Impossible!
---
Apparently I need to clarify that freehand means I didnt trace it but did a freehand drawing then cut out following that...
---
Exactly. She just wants to give you a little chibi figure. What's wrong with that
---
Same with me, 0/4 progress after multiple hits.
---
Also, since they turned on the dedicated servers, I am having major rubberbanding issues with the Nurse. After each time I blink and I'm recovering in fatigue, I will rewind back in time to where I was 2-3 seconds after landing. Anyone else have this problem?
---
We feel like this was made by a rank 20 who has only watched YT videos of this game but never played it themselves
---
A man of good taste.
---
Or woman, I don't know.
---
No gen or pallet is safe.
---
I figure Plague sees her sickness as something holy or divine. She suffers for her gods in her eyes and willingly endures it to show her faith, and spread it to as many people as possible.
---
Most Killers are something like that. They mostly aren't suffering, they enjoy their torment. Most but for Hag and Spirit Id say. Both of them was taken moments before they died.
---
Lisa (The Hag) was brought to the brink of death by starvation, dehydration, and being eaten alive by cannibals. She lost her entire body mass and became almost literally nothing but skin and bone due to what happened to her. She made a deal with the Entity, and it took the deal gladly. Giving Lisa enough power to slaughter the entire cannibal group, turning her into the Hag. An ever starved beast who will never stop hunting and eating everyone in its path to subdue a hunger that will never end.
---
Rin (The Spirit) came home one night to find her father had butchered her mother. In an attempt to get away he cut Run down as well removing an arm and a leg before throwing Rin through a sheet of glass embedding it in her flesh. The Entity first was summoned by the bloodlust of Rin's father, but made a deal with Rin instead when she asked for revenge. The Entity took that deal and turned her into the Spirit. A Yokai who grinds her own flesh and bone with the glass in her body with every move.
---
If I had to pick who suffers more. It would have to be Hag. Pain is one thing, but hunger is something else.
---
Ruin isn't in the shrine rn, it got changed suddenly with the update
---
I didn't even know that map had an inside
---
Someone doesn't read the lore. At all.
---
nvm. Its updating.
---
weird that i was able to play not updating...presumably with other people who havent updated? huh
---
That's lame af
---
Then Freddy has it the worst- Perpetually angry and with aching, agonizingly burned, blue balls.
---
Eh, should've probably put /s, just thought doing that degrades the comment, oh well here comes the downvotes
---
its pretty bad when i hook somebody, leave, chase somebody back to the hook, down them after they unhook and get DS'd, like so much shit can happen between hooks &amp; DS still chugging along
---
Dewit
---
Really? Weird as hell. It's always been E for me. Unless I changed it like in 2016 and forgot I actually did so.
---
You can easily cancel out of healing animations by doing an emote. Spread forth the wisdom for those guys.
---
OwO
---
Just because they aren't called instaheals doesn't mean they weren't instaheals. It's an 8 second heal or endurance now. The reason I said "insta-heal" is because the OP is still calling them insta-heals when they are not.
---
The styptic agent instantly healed 1 health state and the anti-hem istantly healed 2 health states.
---
THEY WERE INSTAHEALS. That's why people called them that instead of anti-hem and styptic agent.
---
he has one sharp chin
---
So what if I don't want to go against multiple prayer beads spirits in a row? (this was sarcasm, mostly)
---
If people can't dc, they'll just suicide on their first hook.
---
cant change my mind 10/10 would let him eat me out
---
Probably did back in 2016 and don't remember I did, lol. But the strange thing is, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game several times since then, and it's always E. Probably remembers my settings eh.
---
oh my god
---
Oh this was from the skin contest right?
---
Oh i know what they did before just didnt know that they actually got removed
---
New Killer perk- 
---
Gun.
---
Instantly kills Survivor. Offers option to kill yourself and end the game early if you‚Äôre Legion.
---
I love how when you're viewing outfits you can spin him around fast enough to make his skirt rise up. So damn sexy.
---
I mean, I just played against one of these and three of them hopped out early with a key and trash talked after, are you surprised. Don't wave the flag of toxicity if you don't want to be treated accordingly, with disregard.
---
Roger that. Thanks for that info. 
---
Where is that documented? That‚Äôs what we are playing on and I couldn‚Äôt find any info anywhere.
---
Fortnite's Chicken Trooper skin or whatever and the two thief skins were fan drawings that got really popular on reddit and implemented into the game as a paid items. The creators got the item, currency, and merch as well I think
---
They really need to nerf Janes sexual moaning it makes it really awkward when guest are over
---
as long as you‚Äôre okay with like... not having a crotch anymore then sure
---
Blood flavor?
---
The game has way to many OP ass things to have people not DC. When this game is actually skill based then yea sure
---
Your point falls apart  When the artist's name is literally at the top of the image. I understand being unhappy about your artwork being shared or stolen without credit given, but when credit is given you have no reason to complain.
---
Yep, this and demon hunter feng. This is the render they showed of on stream today
---
Lol I just lost 3 survivors because they had 2 keys. Keys and Moris OP
---
They're asking why it changed once the patch dropped, not what the shrine is.
---
The rift is a battle pass. Either you pay for it or get the free version. 
---
Basically, you get Charms, Cosmetics, And all the Auric cells you sunk into the "Battle Pass" if you completely finish it. 
---
Also, you do, essentially, Daily Rituals but they last 69 days from today to go complete.
---
Well either way, this one‚Äôs non canon as fuck. No RBT has a timer above 60 seconds. The only reason it would take longer in the movies is due to Saw having weird AF editing.
---
Huntress S tier
---
They shouldn't act disgusting if they don't want punishment
---
I havent gotten to see her in game, only played her.  Does she have it there too?
---
Peanits told me this was going to be purchasable with shards only.
---
My biggest complaint about the End game is that there
---
Is very limited game play.  It would be nice if the collapse became its own ‚Äúmini-game‚Äù.
---
Wait there's actually a new outfit for him?
---
Either use it earlier, or switch it out. The Dedicated servers has made it so your timing has to be even earlier.
---
Considering you have to do lame tasks to read the new stuff...
---
When the fox hears the rabbit scream he comes a-runnin‚Äô, but not to help.
---
It's not even winning it's just cheating. It's like shooting a bear and saying you took it down bare handed, it's Superiority Complex as fuck if you ask me.
---
The rift is basically a thing where the more you play the more items you can get from it, you go up a tier each time you accumulate 10 fragments which you can get from earning xp and archives challenges. Archives are basically a set of challenges that provide bloodpoints and rift fragments on completion and some also provide a bit of lore of some of the characters too.
---
Good because I WANT DANCE WITH ME
---
Well if the person who repost give them credit then what‚Äôs the point of complaining
---
Hopefully the weapon works on release haha
---
So is the event still ending on november 1st? It cant possibly, right? Anyone know what day it is actually ending?
---
That he‚Äôs a gurllll
---
Same. There are some survivors who will always find something to complain about and watching them get salty over nothing is the best part. Even if I played a perfect game they still have something to say. It's hilarious
---
Steven Crowder DESTROYS liberal SJW with MACE and A TASER
---
Pfft Self Care? Worthless. I'll take Inner Strength any day
---
That sucks lol glad I bought it last night.
---
The shrine went all weird with the patch yeah
---
Me: *laughs in second wind*
---
Either something needs to be done about disconnecting or killer emblem requirements need to change. I can‚Äôt hit 9 hooks when 2 people leave the game.
---
1 day dc penalty is pretty concerning considering the current stability of DBD compared to other games.
---
The game is too casual for dc penalties tbh.
---
Ive just been letting people leave lol
---
*takes really terrible glared up, blurry picture that's also SIDEWAYS, of his laptop with his phone where you can barely tell what's going on, instead of pressing prnt screen*
---
-_-
---
I agree with many of your points.  The collapse feels very RnG based.  I‚Äôd like it to be more engaging than ‚Äúwho finds the hatch first‚Äù or ‚Äúgotta slug for a 4K.‚Äù
---
Nah, Ill probably stick with PC
---
huntress emoji socks new cosmetic?!
---
LOL great cosplay guys! looks neat
---
Oh right. Sorry for the confusion. They‚Äôve been changed pretty dramatically in 3.3.
---
Or seduced.. Ash be like that some times
---
yes, thank you so much! :)
---
Omg look it‚Äôs the sex number
---
she manlier than all of us
---
They‚Äôre probably worried you‚Äôre the killer given that you‚Äôre covered in blood.
---
I couldn't find the patch notes but i gotta say the rift is good
---
walter
---
I more meant getting someone up in the basement, or if you were the last survivor standing and you were able to get one of the slugs up during a chase. I think that is cool. 
---
If you read my comments you‚Äôll see that I don‚Äôt think using it to just extend a chase is cool. I suggested not being able to use them on yourself.
---
Man, you know what would make it EVEN EASIER? If they had some way for a large amount of people to try the patch and test it before launch. Shame that doesn‚Äôt exist.... ^/s
---
bruh that's not even a good shitpost.
---
Welp, doesn't surprise me
---
I felt this.
---
lol
---
ü§°üëç
---
They showed it on the livestream
---
If that's true that's wierd since everything for shards is also for cells
---
Welcome to the dbd subreddit /s
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a nerf, but it was kinda needed because it undoes an entire chase in two clicks. All we need now is to nerf Ebony moris somehow and both sides have busted stuff fixed.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
This why we 99% doors guys.
---
Damn meghead
---
Trans girl Myers is valid.
---
For those that aren't aware, the devs had a contest for artists to come up with their own skin, and two would be chosen. This clown skin and a skin for Feng Min won.
---
Are you okay? Do you feel better now?
---
Ffs, I'm done with this dogmatic shit
---
woooww
---
That must have been annoying
---
Say that it is delayed to fix any bugs and problems , still has bugs and problems so what was point of delay
---
It‚Äôs out now
---
I asked this to Not_Queen and apparently it‚Äôs a bug and their looking into it.
---
Finally I can pop a boner for mikey and not feel gay about it, bless
---
This meme made me snort
---
Tbh u can get to rank 4 &amp; suck at the game. So I would 2nd what the other guy said. Until u get to red ranks, you'll run into descent teammates. Even purples play pretty bad from what I've seen. 
---
Like all super immersed. Not all of it is true, but red rank players tend to be above avergae.
---
Seeing is one thing, but learning is another. It's easy to sit there and watch something for entertainment purposes, but to be an active participant is another! Best way to learn is from those that are better than you
---
You get serum through the rift. It shows you how much you have at the top right next to bp and auric cells.
---
But it was my turn to post this!
---
You get serum by progressing through the free track of the Rift. You can burn Pustula Petals offerings to spawn a Blighted Gen and a Blighted hook. These will simply give extra bloodpoints.
---
That‚Äôs why I dc when killers are toxic in game, because I know it bothers them because they spent so much time looking for a game lol
---
All four levels
---
Yes I believe so :)  
---
Its so strange having such a quick base movement speed. But it really helps get you a quick 2nd hit after you get the blink hit.
---
Acting like we haven't already smh.
---
Idk
---
People only used them on mass because they were going to be taken away. They were strong before, but you could deal with them. Now they‚Äôre pointless
---
Remember that the sibling plot wasn't until Halloween 2. H1 never gave this implication.
---
I asked for advice and now I'm getting a lecture I'll cya guys out on the game
---
I don't because I'm still fairly new to DbD. Mind linking it please?
---
nice. i figured so but wanted to be sure. totally gonna save 1000 cells for the next 4 levels after this one, too
---
13th iirc
---
They should make him cripwalk at all times
---
I think its just a one time purchase. You're paying for the rift not the challenges.
---
Daawwww that‚Äôs adorable. Now I want to buy the Rift Pass to get the cute little Claudette charm for my hooks.
---
That'd be fucking amazing.
---
Same place as always, they only release one or two a week for the next few weeks
---
I was scrolling through reddit a bit to quickly and I thought I had caught a glimpse of Bunny Feng
---
holy shit call 911
---
Im memeing clearly
---
Has it been updated on ps4?
---
r/ihavesex
---
That.....might actually be worse if you mean you're not chasing/hooking at all. All the survivors are trying to get healing/unhooks atm.
---
You malicious bastard lol.
---
You should go for the shrine bbq unless you play bubba, because then you can use your blood points on other killers. Plus it's like over 1mil bloodpoints to get to 35
---
When was that said by devs or in patch notes? Serious question btw.
---
I always thought it was their way of making traps appear via entity magic or smthn, so it made more sense than the traps appearing from thin air XD. Either way it was a cool effect and I miss it. -.
---
For some reason the only time people don't believe I'm actually playing for a daily is with the doctor, not sure why.
---
Yeah, that was embarrassing as fuck.
---
I hate spoilers, so I agree that they should be properly tagged
---
It‚Äôll be quicker getting him to 35 with the event running now (as the petal offering gives more bloodpoints). Shards take AGES to grind so you‚Äôre probably better off grinding bloodpoints. Besides you‚Äôll earn shards along the way so it‚Äôs up to you!
---
For real now, who would want to escape such a beauty killer?
---
Computadora
---
Oka lo har√©
---
I just wish she had more add one effecting her dash instead of like 3
---
Oh yeah for sure. Dedicated servers have issues with this. I have been told it‚Äôs been better than PTB so I guess there‚Äôs been progress tho
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/AndrewMarty8/status/1189659352040443904
---
The main use is catch survivors when their guard is down, not mid-chase people.
---
Saw that coming
---
oh lol i was thinking about the ptb.
---
Time flies, doesnt it

This is a great idea! Have you tried reaching out to any of the mods yet about this idea? If this is going to be implemented into the subreddit, it might want to be brought up immediately before anyone leaks them.

You're welcome, glad to hear.

Amazes me how toxic survivors are. Especially considering how easy the game is as SWF

Wataten!: An Angel Flew Down to Me
---
Nah I play the game I just let them not die at the end lol. I even had someone disconnect, so its real gameplay ;D  
---
  
---
~~except basement trapper theyre all dead~~
---
Dead hard was always pretty trash in my experience anyway. After using it once the killer would just wait until you use it before swinging. Only thing it can be consistently used for is extending loops a little
---
Funworld owns both, actually.
---
I have about 80 hours in the game and just hit red rank as a killer. Yikes. 
---
Its pretty brutal, don't get me wrong, I want the games to be difficult but since getting to red I've started having distinctly less fun. Salt levels, toxicity, insanely good/meta perks+items (Which is something that's admittedly been a bit difficult most the way through ranking up just due to being at an initial disadvantage with perk/addon selection due to low time input) and survivors who know the game very, \*very\* well have really started dragging my mood down. Even the games I win are often exceedingly stressful. Honestly if you don't get some initial momentum the game might as well be over if the survivors don't do anything to hard-throw it. It's like spinning plates if the plates mocked and teabagged you.
---
Around rank 8 was probably where I had the most fun in the game, tended to match with high greens-low reds and it was usually a good mix of difficulty and enjoyment in the majority of games without having to go full tryhard or stress myself out. Honestly I can't blame the people I hear about intentionally deranking themselves, but I at least want my Rank 1 achievement to show that I've done it.
---
Another piece of advice I can give to chill yourself is to either just go do something else for a bit or play some survivor games. Red rank killer game after killer game is exhausting and you'll play worse and not have as much fun if you let it tilt you.
---
I very rarely have a survivor game that stresses me to the level of a killer game. Yeah sometimes they have an ebony and sometimes they'll be one of the harder killers to face or be running NOED, but generally speaking it's much easier to both pip and not get frustrated as survivor even with much less resources invested in it (I play a level 5 Nea with Urban and Balanced, and short of not being able to make risky saves and having some extra safety nets I don't feel like I'm at the insane disadvantage I would be playing a no addon 2 perk killer).
---
That being said I'm only in purple ranks as my survivor so it could well get more stressful at reds if the % of Spirit/Nurse and Moris there spike up sharply.
---
The invisible thing is a bug. I've faced my fair share of invisible killers (can only see the red stain), but it isnt reportable.
---
Neither is body blocking. I dont personally camp, but theres nothing reportable about it
---
/facepalm
---
whats wrong with daddy myers?
---
Thanks it seems super cute so I wondering
---
Ohhh i got it thanks!
---
Iight imma head out
---
This looks really awesome. Great work in photoshop too to create smog and ambience.
---
Also damn that ass xD
---
If you can‚Äôt win with 3/4....
---
The hitboxes for the most part are perfectly fine, the placement in the animations combined with latency to the servers is to blame.  Only people who should be complaining about hitboxes are huntress or billy mains.
---
^(I had no idea I needed this in my life)
---
One thing wrong, he doesn‚Äôt need a shirt.
---
It's my cake day to :)
---
The turns have tabled
---
REPOST. This is what is so fucking annoying with this website
---
i think he does stab someone w a pipe in the films but i believe that‚Äôs a shotgun he stabs her with right there in that clip
---
It's a lot easier to be toxic to someone if you don't understand their struggle in the opposite role.
---
Playing both sides makes you more empathetic toward the other.
---
Yeah, fuck it, why did they make an event? Great use of time and resources. /s
---
That or if you feel lile you can 4k slug the 3rd and find the 4th with whispers then close the hatch before killing the last on
---
As a killer main myself I do feel so bad for the last guy when this happens and I usually let him go
---
oh ok but still 1000AC every Tome(every 4 Levels, every 3 months)
---
Had a game today where i found the same person 3 times at different gens in pretty quick succession i admittedly felt bad but if they are the only person ive seen am i not supposed to hit them like sometimes idk
---
Myers can stand over me anytime :)

Would be more accurate if it everyone today, yesterday they gave us ruin now they gave us haunted grounds
---
That's a massive boner
---
New to the game, ive heard the term tunneling get thrown around but what dous it even mean? Is it like tunnel visioning on one specific survivor or something.
---
Bought fake bones and skulls on Amazon. Found some sticks in my back yard. Lashed them together with twine. And then just the little electric candles.
---
Can you see her holding the trap when you are playing her?
---
why the fuck did i comment this
---
Yeps! Have fun. And definetly dont let salty people ruin the experience. The game is by no means perfect, but its still a really good game and its tons of fun
---
God tier
---
Dude scoops Steve‚Äôs are the funniest little scamps as killers they always surprise me at loops
---
Actual picture of u/otzdarva
---
Why?
---
Well, it's effectively two pipes in one stab, which would be more surface area and likely harder than a single pipe. Plus he impales through the wall as well.
---
Instant match for survivor (level 12) a lot of players that I've matched with are in better ranks 8s? 
---
I wait a long time as killer (rank 20) since I don't normally play them just for the dailies. I put in a lot of hours on my bed, so this is where all my dlc is at
---
Tbh i play a lot more survivor but in situations where someone insta unhooks im significantly more frustrated with the unhooker as i expect the killer to re down me and chase them its an easy 2 for 1 deal
---
Good thing this sub isn't r/gaming
---
It means downing the same survivor every time they get pulled off a hook until they die. Honestly I don't think it's the worst thing in the world, just some killers are sore losers about it.
---
removed for repost
---
I completely forgot basement existed with Hawkins lmao
---
Give people time to level up their bloodwebs and you should start seeing more
---
If that was so then spirt would be a wild character
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Anytime I let a Claudette heal me, they're actually trying to sandbag me for the killer to down me again, so I can be farmed smh.
---
You're a fucking madlad, good shit
---
What are they for exactly? I have used them tonight but all I see is that they give you extra bloodpoints. Is there something else cool going on with them? This is my first Halloween event!
---
Whats even better is when they camp a fake pallet after getting hit so you just stare them down &amp; clap their cheeks at lightning speed
---
Hillbilly: *limps*
---
Also hillbilly: 115% movement speed
---
Find i‚Äôm leaving! You‚Äôre such a Claudette

üòå
---
DBD Myers is trans
---
So you need to get peddles from your blood web. Then you need to offer them up before the match. During the match if you see a gen and playing survivor fix that gen. If your killer hook survivors to hooks with pustulation pods on them and charms. At the end of the match go to the rift and you will be able to collect your viles.
---
They spawn event hooks and generators, which you get more BP by using those specific ones. It's +1 per offering.
---
This is the dumbest shit I've heard on this subreddit
---
Perfect clown outfit
---
tbh I do this. I dont go out of my way to hit that person, but come on, if you pull the guy of right in front of me you better belive im gonna go for the guy I know is one shot.
---
It‚Äôs freaking amazing how you can manage to hook people 7 times, kick gens going on a circle and still get 0k because toolboxes, decisive strikes, unbreakable, and infinite loops
---
Here I highlighted it for you:

Loud warning kinda :)

They've had most of the day to level up and get some.
---
As a new player i have zero clue what any of that is
---
I guess dbd is everyone‚Äôs top priority and they don‚Äôt have anything better to do
---
she cute af but not sexy imo
---
It's actually better not to. There are perks like decisive strike and borrowed time. It's better to got the person unhooking.
---
all the gens in hawkins spawn in the same place, you can simply memorize the layout.   
---
The Game you just need to look for big doors. 
---
for Lery look for glowing signs
---
spirit if you have iron will. trapper if it's early game. billy if they like their chainsaw. every killer has their weakness
---
It's funny they wouldn't be mad if the atrat didn't work. And it doesn't in higher ranks
---
Well, apparently they decided to let the accumulated progress stand. It wasn't that terrible either, I think I started at rank 9ish and I think that is around what most player experienced.
---
Invisible sandbagging is the only true issue with her.

Its exactly what I said.. are you ok?

The original meme template is with regular people with the purple TT being the odd one out because it doesn‚Äôt fit in with the narrative.

You heard it here first folks, short people can‚Äôt be stronk.

Is this sizest?!
---
You didn‚Äôt directly say it but it seemed like you were implying that it‚Äôs perfectly fine by arguing against that other guys statement. 
---
I don‚Äôt even have a problem with the exposed status effect. Insta kill Myers should probably go away but that‚Äôs a different story. Insta heals shouldn‚Äôt have been messed with. People didn‚Äôt even use them that often until they said they were getting rid of them. And most people I encounter don‚Äôt even know how to use them..

Ruin is pointless on spirit anyway

literally of one of the most popular posts on the sub, at least actually try...
---
As a Canadian I can confirm that Canadians being super nice is just bs
---
So when do these come out?
---
Meh... they still fucked it up, they just recognized that they would harvest a shitstorm of epic proportions if they delay the archives even further. \^\^
---
Because they have to blame everyone but themselves for their loss
---
Hu. Ill have to look into those perks. Ive played survivor like once and found it really boring, so dont know much about that sort of stuff. Thx!
---
Yep same
---
They still pretty strong tbh
---
Before you could literally heal in front of the killer, nullifying 30s chase. Which is huge for how short matches goes
---
Of course it was a doctor.

Just posted a video of it:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBKmoQma9Yw&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBKmoQma9Yw&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Killers are fcked up
---
I mainly spend BPs playing killer, and not survivor, so I haven‚Äôt got any petals on my characters with the best builds ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
thanks
---
No, what‚Äôs reportable is standing on the top of the basement stairs and blocking 2 / 3 survivors from being able to leave just so you get your kill. Which you did 3 times. That‚Äôs why ‚Äúbody blocking‚Äù is in the end report screen. Sure, the second survivor can push by you, but you still are blocking to get either survivor because you refuse to move. At least tell the whole truth if you‚Äôre going to make a post an hour later.
---
oh thats why i was already like tier 39
---
My PC is crashing every time I try to play DbD after the 6gb update. 
---
Started crashing mid-game, and now I can't even queue before shutting down.  
---
Other games are fine.
---
The "Complete them in one match" is optional?
---
Wtf are you talking about ‚Äúlame tasks‚Äù all the story is there in the character info. Even if you don‚Äôt own a specific character you can still read they‚Äôre lore
---
Who cares. Just leave the match. People need to learn to ignore
---
Issa joke
---
Are you sure it doesn‚Äôt mean that you did the whole pumpkin with no hands?!
---
... did you telekinesis the fuck outta this pumpkin?
---
I was trying to figure out why it looked so feminine besides the boobs, and finally I noticed it was the luscious locks
---
this is sick asf
---
Nah, he was invisible the entire match after the first hook and stood at the top of the stairs for the next 3 hooks (until everyone died) that he had in the basement. I would say that‚Äôs pretty fucked up if not reportable.
---
Those hips don't lie

uncharted 4 multiplayer allows you to spend a bit of points any amount of times to replace a daily

Awesome dude! I might try this out myself!

Add some real candles and it would be a 10/10 (proper fire safety comes first tho obviously)
---
That girl is just trying to help him get through society.
---
When the event ends you're not able to use the pustula offerings and the halloween hooks, gens and items will disappear. The Hallowed Blight costumes and the serum have nothing to do with the event but with the rift.
---
You have 69 days to get the serum from the rift, when the rift closes the serum currency will be available 2 weeks after.
---
The thing is you can't use self-care to heal every single injury though, especially with how popular Sloppy Butcher + Thana "keep everyone injured" builds are becoming. If you just try to self-care away every injury, you'll never get anything done. I still like running it though because it's really valuable to be able to top yourself off when your heal gets interrupted halfway through, or to be able to self heal when you need to make a risky play and can't afford to do so injured. Just in most situations, I'll probably keep working while injured and get healed when I run into another teammate.
---
yikes a *Jake* man
---
secretly you want him to beat you up with that instrument of punishment too
---
Yeah you're welcome. Decisive let's the survivor escape the killer's grasp once per match, for up to 60 seconds after being unhooked.
---
Borrowed Time makes it so if someone unhooks a survivor in the Killer's terror radius, the unhooked survivor will essentially get another hit before they go down.
---
They are anti tunnel perks and they will waste your time more so going after them rather than the person who unhooked them.
---
It depends on where you‚Äôre from. I‚Äôm playing from Ireland currently and my survivor wait times are ~30-40 minutes (Rank 8). Killer wait times are ~40-60 minutes (Rank 18).
---
Dude you can basement trap with almost any killer.
---
I recall body blocking you once, but the other time your team literally stayed near the basement in the ski lodge.
---
You were getting healed and everything.
---
Please make a post detailing your side of the story, or share the video evidence.
---
Locker jukes aren't pointless
---
Wow, Imagine if he hooked someone around the final gen to bait a person up for 2 free kills,  body blocking is definitely stupid though. (I'm looking at you 1 spot generator in the second story house that The Shape can lock you in if s salty survivor doesn't do it first
---
I was playing a level 15 Billy a couple of days ago and I got three people say "To ez"
---
I sure hope you reported him in-game and submitted a ticket. This is called holding the game hostage.
---
Oh yea i was just saying that as a joke. I trained my two puppies to bark and sit at the door. Took a few months but if i hear barking, get up and see those two sitting in front of the door i know they want out!
---
Event gens will push you over the 32k
---
Yes
---
No it‚Äôs not optional
---
BBBBRRRRRRAKMONGA
---
lol you're not wrong
---
At least you could give your friend a heads up that‚Äôs a pro killer. Spirit Fury and no enduring baby!
---
Survivors have whole arsenals of shit just for fucking with killers and you want to take away a their only rebuttal, you know whats the best response to instahealing the survivor you just downed back to healthy?  A FUCKING MORI, 3 people flashlighting you nonstop?  another goddamn mori, Twitch streamer swf party? take a  wild guess
---
So I'm not the only one that thinks he looks like Jon Bernthal lol
---
OH NO! THEY'RE ON TO ME!
---
It actually can be depending on how late into the game it is
---
You body blocked every time you hooked basement. You kept body blocking basement, where are survivors supposed to go when the team is hooked there? I don‚Äôt need to share evidence publicly which I‚Äôve already sent. Lol
---
We have exposed your greatest secret.
---
Come clean or we shall cleanse you in holy fire, you Witch!
---
True and in this realm size is not a option and a previous post months ago was pointed out that everyone in the game is actually really short. The game map shows a height sign. But yes the entity gives them extra powers as she sees fit. 
---
Because in real life if the Legion came across a pack of David‚Äôs, well it would be game over for the Legion...
---
Whenever I feel like it. If they deserve an escape then they get one, unless they wiggle after the hatch opens. Ash players tend to be given the hatch more just because Ash
---
He probably got to play Freddy for free after that if the legends are true
---
Thanks, my small brain has hard times comprehending big words like The Shape.
---
I do the same, BhVR needs to spread them out some and then some games they are on opposite sides of the map. But hatch escapes on PS4 are not that bad and only happen every now and then to me as killer. Not sure how the pc or Xbox community are.
---
I love this on so many levels
---
And pretty much all the cosmetics in the rift you can get in the store, right?
---
Spine chill and urban evasion. That way if a killer approaches, you can sneak away without a trace before they get there.
---
Find a decent hiding spot and wait it out. I‚Äôd recommend...
---
Spine Chill/Urban Evasion/Balanced Landing/Whatever else you feel like running.
---
I use this build quite a bit, and usually only get hooked for the first time towards the end of the game (If I‚Äôm trying to just do gens, open chests, sabotage hooks, cleanse totems, etc.)
---
This is the best cosmetic it‚Äôs not up for debate
---
Some of those seem borderline impossible. Have to bank on bringing a purple coin and no one looting at all but you?
---
Basically I wanted to get a feel for others opinions first. I'm pretty anti-spoilers as a general rule, and some communities can be much more open than I would be normally. I wanted to get a feel for how folks around here felt before bothering the mods. 
---
Plus, I figure there's more value in being able to say "hey, here's a thread of people's thoughts on the subject" than just "hey, here's my thoughts on it".
---
That is a very specific rank 
---
Who hurt you
---
Some of those seem like bs
---
Tin tun tun Tin tun tun tin tun tin tun
---
well both of them are good in some way since killer be adapt with it and they might think you have barrow time effect for 8 seconds so they wait then the will hit you ( maybe you reach a pallet by then or escape already ) but if you have the syringe you will be healed because they waited or you wasted enough time to get the passive heal.
---
What's an instaheal?
---
Sloppy,nurses,than, corrupt two power recovery add ons
---
Who said anything about cosmetics? We're talking about the LORE. The STORY, which is ALSO unlocked through the Rift. Completeing specific tasks unlocks portions of the stories.
---
They made the event because of it's tradition in a (so-called) horror game. And it has nothing to do with the Pig or their lack-of attention to the Pig. Rather the Pig was in the game or not this Halloween event would still be going on.
---
What has BHVR's complete and undivided attention is first and foremost anything that has to do with monetization (DLCs, Skins, Archives, Auric cells, the sale of the base game). A distinct second is game health (bug fix department) since without this there won't be people around to do number 1. And the distant last place is base changes/improvements.
---
I feel comfortable in predicting that if there are ever any problems with the Archives/any monetization avenue that that shit will be fixed within hours pronto (I wonder why). Whereas if there is a problem with a gameplay bug, it'll be fixed within weeks or a month. And if there is a problem with a killer needing a buff it'll take YEARS. And I'm certain I'll be right about that prediction, while people like you will be nowhere to be found when the reason why is pointed out.
---
I thinks it‚Äôs great so far
---
Sounds mostly like your graphics driver is crashing/stopping. Update it
---
Yes, the killer knows where you are, but the second that gen pops it also becomes a waste of time for the killer to walk to it, especially if it's far away from other active gens. I guess it depends on how safe the gen is that's being done, how good of vision you have (or basically how much time you'll have to react to the killer coming), what killer you're going against and what the state of your team/ the gen progress is that decides whether you want to heal first or do the gen first.
---
If you have good vision and can tell if the killer is coming from a mile away, then maybe it's best to 99% the gen, heal up, then pop it either when the heal is done or when you see the killer coming your way. This is the safest heal and lets you have your cake and eat it too.
---
However, if the gen is tucked around a corner with bad vision, or if you're going against a stealth killer or if it's the last gen/ an important gen to finish (i.e. to prevent a 3 gen) then finishing the gen takes priority over healing back up any day of the week. The worst case scenario is the killer coming to your gen during the heal without you seeing it coming, interrupting the heal and potentially downing the injured survivor, AND you don't even get to finish the gen. If there's any risk of this happening, just pop the gen first it's more important. 
---
Remember, the killer has to get up to 8 hooks until he can kill anybody if the survivors are playing optimally, and survivors only have to get 5 gens. Even if you pop the gen and the killer comes and downs the injured survivor because you didn't heal them first, that's a good trade for the survivors.
---
No one really used instas tbh this was overkill.
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
Oh god yes. I wish there was a way to stop someone from being able to unhook you like how you can stop someone from healing you. I hate being farmed like that, unhooked RIGHT IN FRONT of the Killer.
---
Least you don‚Äôt have to worry about those insta heals anymore, am I right?
---
Also, this is hypocrisy at its finest. If they don‚Äôt want people to use moris, they should not bring a key, and I say this as a survivor main myself. Stop being hypocrites, friends.
---
Why are you asking me lmao
---
well fair enough
---
Than it‚Äôs just additional to the already existent story. Plus you can just find it online so it‚Äôs not a big deal

&gt; Lmao the animators giving her a bear trap in the lobby isn‚Äôt hurting anything, you‚Äôre really reaching there. It‚Äôs a small thing that was done in less than a day, it‚Äôs nothing to bang on about.
---
It is nothing in the long run, yes. That's the problem. It's nothing, so I'm telling them FOH with this nothing. Give us something that's actually meaningful. Lipstick on a Pig, means nothing.
---
It doesn't make them money, so I'm sure they'll take a year or two more to actually do something that benefits the Pig. In the meantime I'm sure they'll pump out more outfits for her that could be bought, since money is really all they care about.
---
Wow only 60k for that though? Like I suck with killer. There's no way I'll get that without getting baby survivors. I'm def not paying the 10$ for the pass. Won't be able to earn back the auric cells cause I can't complete crazy challenges like that.
---
Just got dc on my PS4
---
Said the killer left 
---
No bp or anything..
---
You really don't like this cosmetic?
---
He could just hit them though
---
That may be true, but for a lot of players, the game loses its "horror" feel after 20 or so hours
---
Besides, not all the cosmetics are strictly horror
---
Do killers lose add-ons?   
---
I just finished a trial - no disconnects - and my add-ons are still there. What I'm thinking is that the game auto-filled my add-ons because I had extra. Is that correct?
---
What platform???
---
A fellow denizen of r/cutelittlefangs, I see.
---
The Slayer of Demons yes it is her, I cannot wait for this to drop.

That‚Äôs not the original‚Äôs fault tho, it‚Äôs the fact that everyone tried to replicate/make fun of the original so it just made it boring.

But I literally did leave and teleport, that‚Äôs how  I activated make your choice.

Thanks always trying to improve xo

I‚Äôm farming for about 95% of those

I would only recommend running it in an endgame build, one specifically designed to slaughter during EGC. All of Freddy‚Äôs perks are great for this, and you can slot in NOED as a fourth perk of you‚Äôre ok intaking some after match sodium. The idea is to slug someone, open the game yourself, hook them, and watch as their teammates either dive the hook and die, or corner themselves in a blocked exit gate and die. You‚Äôll rarely pip with a build like this (which means technically you lost, or at best had a draw) but man is it fun.
---
I had the same thing happen to me. It started me at Tier 5 or 6 and i reached Tier 7 before I stopped playing today but I didn't get any of the Auric Cells from the Premium rewards.
---
Last Minute Hero has got to be the worst imo
---
Honestly what a legend

Its the best feeling in the whole wide world.

And then they find the hatch

I just DC if an active totem ends up in those jungle gyms

fyi ormond also has those so itll be bugged as well

Really? I think doing 4 gens completely in one trial is gonna be a pain.
---

Contrary to what this community likes to say, the acceptability of any given tactic is contextual. For example, I had a game where a survivor brought a key in, and I noticed that there was no obsession (so no ds).  In that scenario, the only reasonable course of action is to make sure that the key-holder dies first by any method, or else 2 or more survivors are just going to vanish apropos of nothing, and I lose the game.
---
Tomorrow, i think
---
No but I can get one

Thanks!. When did it start?

Could ban certain things like killers/perks to make it more appealing.

Lol the David can just open the door and start the collapse. In order to prevent situations like this, the collapse should just begin automatically after a few minutes have passed. You‚Äôll be stuck for a few minutes, but you‚Äôll eventually die. It‚Äôs not like the Killer can keep you there forever anymore.
---
I dont think so.
---
You can complete the pass without finishing the challenges

If you cum there, you'll gay too.

You'll gay too.

I‚Äôm hoping to be Wraith next year, with a Trapper. Hopefully there‚Äôll be a lot of killers and we can get a ton of photos!

Because they are given powers by the entity you know that literally eldritch god that watches over the killer and survivors and is the whole reason any of this is happening
---
i hadn‚Äôt ;-;
---
Insta heals got shafted
---
jesus, what‚Äôs the point
---
That's a clever idea actually
---
Master Challenges aren't optional and must be completed within a single match.
---
Something kind of similar happened to me. Similar enough that I‚Äôll share it here because it‚Äôs not worthy of its own post.
---
I was playing survivor (I‚Äôm a killer main but when I feel like playing with a little less stakes, I‚Äôll play survivor) and I was working on a gen. I hear the heartbeat start pounding so I take a look around and see this big white thing moving in the background. Obviously it‚Äôs killer, so I feel safe. Suddenly I get hit from behind by this fat, laughing guy with clown makeup and I look at what I thought was the killer again... it‚Äôs a Scoops Ahoy Steve. I accept my fate and got hooked. The end.
---
Clowns not cute he sexy
---
Its definitely stick drift, i had the same problem as you, and then it got worse and affected other games
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't played demogorgon since the PTB, but I think shred works with NOED. I was curious if shred could insta-down so I took NOED and let the survivors do all the gens so I could check, and it worked. They might have changed it since his release, but I'm fairly certain it works with shred.
---
On their website I know that they have tickets you can fill out and submit. I was trying to see if this is a known issue but you're the only other person I've seen mention experiencing this problem. :/ . Atleast we know it's not just us now.
---
Yup. The survivor main will try killer and be like ‚Äú OMG Killer is so hard wth BHVR what kinda of game is this &gt;:( ‚Äú

Turn your brightness up

So happy fairy tail is done

Mr Envy definitely has the best chase music as far as I've heard. It's not a consistent music track like others have made. It's the same short looping track on repeat which is far more unsettling.

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs hard to tell sometimes with the state of this community. There really are people who post shit like this and never realize how ridiculous they sound.
---
No shit

Theres one starting tomorrow.....it was confirmed

I havent got around to wayching new seasons ive been so busy with college and uni i havent had time. Luckily i saw all of tartaros arc and have been waiting since its release for the new seasons. Ik what im binging next week
---
Lol
---
I think it's doubly hilarious because it was a stealth nerf to killers, not buff. No one dies to egc without being a 4head, but now closing the hatch for a key instantly completes the generators. To put salt in the wound, Pig had to get a "logical change" in order to compensate.
---
The true answer is Distortion every killer about rank 10 will be using BBQ and Chili and thats why people doing gens far away get chased immediately after someone is hooked. Combine with Bond so you can leave gens before teammates bring the killer to you Bond is better than Spine Chill. Pick whatever exhaustion you like Sprint Burst will be easiest to use Balanced Landing is the best option though. Lastly use Alert because its underrated and shows you where the killer is very often
---
This is true, but it's also conceptually bullshit that a teammate would literally rather be in a worse state then help their teammate. The last gen I can understand because of adrenaline, but otherwise it's pointless not to heal.
---
all trashy /assholes/lag switchers 99% of them are doctors and you cant prove me wrong with that.
---
I think if you go and work on a gen or something it should deactivate. If you get away and work on a gen and I find you then I shouldn‚Äôt be punished because you still have DS
---
Oh ho? Then try as hard as you like
---
Watching the game.
---
Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself
---
with xbox randoms? that sounds like a bad time
---
BoDyBlOCkIng at least you can do something about you can kill the survivor or hit it if they are body blocking this is exploiting.
---
It's super useful at shorter loops. Running Pig with Bamboozle makes her better than most killers at countering loops.
---
I‚Äôve turned off my messages as well (on PS4) and just have to laugh when someone tries to send something toxic by sending a friend request and including the hate in the little message part of it.

Damned if ya do, damned if ya don‚Äôt.

All I remember of that movie despite watching it multiple times as a child are the fever dream scenes where Babe murders an elderly clown at an LSD party and nearly drowns the target dog.

I choose to pretend that movie doesn‚Äôt exist.

1. Again. You are paying money for the shit they give you. I never talked like you hadn‚Äôt paid for those things at all.
---
2. The free updates are obviously not out of the kindness of their hearts. They are for the exact reason stated had you bothered to read. What I stated was that the free updates were to keep players around. Keep them interested if you will. Because if you stick around you are more likely to buy. But if they today decided to stop updating the game, that would be their decision and it would be okay. (Now that there is a roadmap of features promised and people have passes bought for the rift stuff this is less true, now they are paying for things to come, and so they should come.)
---
3. The fact that BVHR are treated well was my entire original point and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre slowly managing to piece it together, but you‚Äôre not quite there yet. Your greediness and lack of any thought for other people like the devs is the exact kind of shit that makes the game industry toxic for them. Because your stupid entitled pressuring is what gets them to stay late. And your stupid entitled wining is the reason why other companies that maybe have smoother launches tend to have godawful dev treatment. Are you putting it together now? Are you seeing how your ridiculous level of anger towards these devs is the exact kind of shit that makes this industry so bad for them? Can you see now how your entitlement is one of the biggest things wrong with the industry today? I seriously hope so. Jesus Christ.
---
he‚Äôs holding the fame hostage, how daft must you be to defend the doctor?
---
Yeah, I don't have many perks with him yet but I'm already running NOED for this exact reason. I don't care about salt or Pips. Awesome tip, was wondering how best to go about using this perk.
---
Only question is why he‚Äôd run Dying Light lmao
---
You have some specific examples of fanmade stuff making it into the game? I'm excited to know about them
---
Remove body blocking for both roles?

Russian roulette, now with Hex totems!

People are just upset about her anal beads add-on because it makes it hard to know she's coming
---
I played as a level 1 nurse to try and get a daily... did terrible of course. And then the survivors sent me messages afterwards saying how much I sucked (I play on Xbox). I don‚Äôt get the toxicity, especially when you see it‚Äôs a baby killer trying to get used to a new style entirely with no add ons

At least you can use Pop goes the weasal on every killer to good success!
---
feng min
---
What the actual fuck?
---
Yep same here literally for PC. Didn‚Äôt have much issues until after today‚Äôs patch happened.
---
It gets to the point if 1 person dc at start of the game nobody wants to play that disadvantaged especially when the killer knows theres only 3 survivors and they basically hook one and chase the other. The gameplay with only 3 players really sucks and is more of a time waste if anything
---
I change my perks a lot lol. Right now I need to heal people so pop better healing perks and whatnot. But guess I'm gonna have to run d strike but it doesn't help against being mori'd lol.
---
My love for Katie is too big
---
They look nice (when you can see them), don't decay or get used, and each character can have the different ones (upto 3)
---
This is tricky for me since yeah there SHOULD be a way out of that situation since that's definitely broken, but I don't really blame the killer since the other two survivors could open up the gate and you two will die, it was a group effort of survivors AND the killer to hold the game hostage here, but if there weren't a way out of this I would call this holding the game hostage, is it scummy? yeah. Would I do that? no. But it is the best way undeniably to play that situation.
---
I was just dumbfounded by his load out lol.
---
Here, take my downvote
---
This reminds me of one time when i was in my living room and i heard this weird tune being whistled outside but I wasn't able to find the source
---
One man can dream yeah.. that would be great :/
---
What would your myers build be? Especially after the most recent update. I take it Corrupt, Infectious Fright, Discordance and what would be your 4th?
---
tomorrow 11am est
---
Spirit and plague
---
I like me a school girl ghost and a vommy mommy
---
Nah but knowing where the killer is at all times is helpful. Just hope you don‚Äôt get caught out and bring a key üòä
---
Exactly. If some of these had much higher numbers but weren't master challenges it would be fine.
---
As long as they dead, you get it
---
Cutest survivor - Kate
---
Cutest killer - Tie between GF and Pig. Pig makes cute sound when she gets stunned but GF has fun making memories in his moris and makes survivors want run in to get in the picture.
---
Yeah I get that but stat buffs just seem wierd. Maybe if you could ‚Äúcollect all 5!‚Äù And get an exclusive cosmetic
---
So immediately adding P2W because some Charms are premium only.
---
No.
---
I already did as much of Evan‚Äôs backstory as I could. I haven‚Äôt gotten enough safe unhooks yet for the other yet.
---
Feng doesn't use lockers and i main her. I never seen that. Its dwight i always find in lockers
---
Surprised he‚Äôs not running NOED too honestly
---
Bubba
---
Who, trapper?
---
They still lose because the Doctor body blocked them. That's still holding them hostage.
---
Nurse
---
Unfortunately. Honestly an unneeded nerf in my opinion
---
What rank are you? I don‚Äôt mean it in a disrespectful way but once you reach the top tier of rank 1, the Spirit and Nurse are really the only viable killers...  Any decent rank 5 killer going Against Rank 5-10 survivors will easily beat a 4 man
---
Its useful only if the survivor stays on the loop while you crouch, doesnt happend often in red ranks
---
Thompson house needs a rework sooner or later. It‚Äôs pretty bleh for a main landmark.

oh well

Goodbye to the days of survivors not struggling every time
---
noo you'd be huntress
---
So I‚Äôve played for a little over a year, but exclusively survivor (admittedly pretty bad). recently started playing killer and picked it up instantly just from observing what killers would do to me for so long, after playing killer for the better part of a month, I start playing survivor with some friends again. Taking a month off of survivor MADE ME A BETTER SURVIVOR because I started seeing what GOOD survivors would do to me, and applied what I learned. 
---
TLDR: picked up killer finally after a year and was good because of the being on the receiving end, went back to survivor and was better for the same reasons just in reverse
---
People see the coin offerings and instantly remember chests are a thing. To which they then each open one to get a brown medkit.
---
But I love Myers ;-;
---
Also this. Just got home from work a bit ago.
---
How the fuck wouldn't they? His fucking sack got boiled. I'm now legitimately curious about that.
---
Yeah, how about no.
---
One? You can't stop at just one. About 750,000 will do.
---
Thank goodness
---
Adrenaline does like 5 things at once, it is easily the survivor perk with the most individual value. Speed boost, fully heals you if acquired after unhook, picks you up, heals you if injured, and wakes you up. Not saying you need to run adrenaline, just ‚Äúperk slot value‚Äù is NOT the argument to use against Adrenaline

Because who GaF about streamers? Don‚Äôt need them in my games as merchandise

Cool

It took me WAAAAAAAAAY too long to realize you were making a Darkest Dungeon reference.
---
Please make more "Dear Survivors" posts.

The only thing I disagree with on the used to be insta-heals is that they take up the full medkit.

That is bullshit.

It should just eat the addon like BNP does.

congrats

90% of the people here are sensitive children. Not surprised you're getting downvotes and soon will be my comment. Lol

I'm glad they're actually adding this a skin, I remember the concept art for it like it was yesterday
---
What‚Äôs the mask made of? Looks dope
---
Yeah the producers of scary movie actually commissioned the masks to be made that‚Äôs why they were later sold in stores as Halloween costumes as opposed to other parody characters who typically look terrible, I consider Doofy‚Äôs ghostface to actually be one of the superior costumes, featuring a double-over robe and a long goblin hood, the wrinkled mask is perfect for the character looking less like a scary Slasher and more like a homicidal doofus who‚Äôs trying his best to be a scary Slasher.
---
Its pretty much the same as Nancy unhooking Jane with ease
---
we learned this lesson with the Evil Incarnate achievement :( BHVR needs to introduce surivvor husks that are interactable

He is so cute when trying to hide

Can we get a full body pic? Also, did u make that mask?
---
thank you! :)

Finally that Trapper nerf we all were hoping for! After the Pig nerfs he was the only killer played at high rank
---
I did this when I was a new survivor then I would teabag and get patrolled or facecamped pretty badly but I had a friend using a smurf to play with me because I was new and it was after they made it so the highest level player dictates the killer level, but I had been killer for months before I just wanted to level them first and not play survivor with no perks. Anyway I usually got saved and if it was with the exit gate open enjoyed having everyone body block at low ranks surprisingly coordinated for only duo + two randoms.
---
that epic usefulness of Second Wind though.
---
Oh no. Please don't start here.
---
That's not a bad idea either
---
If you call criticism of a company who consistently do a bad job "greediness" and "entitlement" I haven't a fucking clue what you're smoking. I've paid for the game and supported it for a long time, I have every right to be upset when they fuck something up.
---
ya they need to remove it and also speed up the death animation for survivor cause it takes forever at the end for the entity to fully kill them so the hatch can open
---
Kinda dumb that they ban someone for finding exploits in the game and just being good at it.
---
100% quality content
---
If you complete every tier in the Rift you will earn 1000 Auric cells and be able to pruchase the next pass without buying more, if you want.
---
That‚Äôs weird. Whenever I go against a doctor they‚Äôre usually idiots lol 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to brag (because I‚Äôm trash 99% of the time) but I‚Äôm the only doctor I‚Äôve ever encountered that has gotten a 4K. I had one doc that would chase anyone he saw no matter what and had the attention span of a peanut.
---
Yeah which still makes no sense why they would  do this
---
Didn't realize blocking a staircase was a pro gamer move. Man, I wish I knew how to block a staircase.
---
Thanks! :)
---
This makes me happy. Please, have an upvote.
---
Thanks again! Glad its coming
---
Tbh that wouldn't surprise me at all. Due to an unforeseen issue they remove the pig entirely. Forcing more people to play spirit
---
Yo if it doesn‚Äôt help me I ain‚Äôt coming outta my god damn busy Dwight
---
My name is Susie. I‚Äôm the killer sent by entity.
---
Shes fun as hell tho
---
Why would you sit there for 15 mins? Just dc and move on.
---
Take your loss you fucking loser.
---
Then you hear the chainsaw rev repeatedly at the start of the game
---
Incorrect. If the person holds crouch as they are being unhooked, they won't activate the trap. Same with things like healing or completing a gen. At no point is it impossible to avoid the Hag's traps if you are aware they are there. The myth her traps are unavoidable makes her a lot better than she really is, because if she isn't actively camping and you don't trip her traps, she has to waddle across the map at 110% speed which makes her Proxy camping practically useless outside closed spaces.
---
The only time that's not the case is with her Ultra Rare Mint Rag, which is--unsurprisingly--very rare.
---
I‚Äôm thinking maybe they could a Freddy situation where different add-ons change the power?
---
That moment when mettle of man got buffed today
---
Happened with a kate for me, Don't think she understood how myers worked
---
Freddy looks like he went back in time, molested himself, then got burned by the townsfolk. Love it.
---
I demand blood points for all the time I didn‚Äôt play too!
---
I didn't realize he had a Reddit. That dude just excels at everything he does. Legit one of the nicest YouTubers I've ever seen.
---
I mean... he won?
---
Yeah but I mean like permanently banning a streamer from a game for playing it differently when they weren‚Äôt even using cheats or anything. This whole community seems to always want to get anyone they can banned for whatever reason they can find.
---
A simple solution to this would be if they removed body blocking after 30 seconds of collision
---
Nah it's made out of the blood of his friends and enimies
---
But this is a bannable offense.
---
Yeah but it kinda pisses people off when a trapper facecamps you for 3 hooks. You wouldnt like it would you?
---
No one said he didn't win? Lol. I'm pointing out the fact that he had a mori and tombstone,  it's a little much seeing how the challenges are to get hooks until you need to kill all 4 and he wasn't on that one.
---
And no matter how much exercise Jane gets, she'll always be **T H I C C**
---
Slugging and camping is ok for hatch tho right? üòÇ
---
Mmmm. Tastes like survivor tears.
---
Except it's not like it's unreactable. You run from the charge, not from the crouching itself, meaning you still gain distance.
---
The thing a lot of inexperienced players do that try to replicate this is they run no-where.
---
It would be easier to just do the challenges before the prologue just to be sure.
---
For those down voting please read this to understand why I say this. Maybe you will come to the conclusion instead of downvoting for no reason.

Console nurse rippp
---
        I love dead by daylight and I have managed to get pretty good using nurse on the PS4 edition of dead by daylight. It must have taken me months, at least 3 months of constantly playing nurse on console just to be good enough to use nurse effectively. 
---
          And it saddens me when I only ever come across 2-3 nurses a month when I play survivor. Let alone a good nurse. 70% of the time it‚Äôs actually so bad that it‚Äôs a guaranteed win on the survivors side because everybody is afraid to pick up nurse and learn how to use it. Beyond the atrocious frame rates on certain maps to the poor sensitive it really was a mind game and prediction based killer. Truly was. 
---
          And I‚Äôm my complete honest opinion I felt this particular killer needed a slight buff to her cool down just to keep up. The part that saddens me is this killer has recently been nerfed to the console edition, and I feel like I will never see another nurse again apart from the occasional people trying it out for the first time, and the ones who need the challenges done. 
---
          In fact, so much so that I have recently deleted this game from my ps4‚Äôs library because it‚Äôs clearly not up to par with the pc version and requires more attention instead of the developers focusing on one machine and tuning the rest the same way when this should not be true. I chose this killer out of the others because I wanted to be different. I wanted to be one of the rare few who could master this killer and dominate. I wanted to put fear into the survivors when I played instead of the survivors scaring off the other nurse players. I wanted to be that 1% of console nurse players who could actually be a killer instead of a killer who could be bullied. 
---
           While I do believe something should have been done about the rampant nurse‚Äôs on pc. How about take this one for once and leave nurse alone on console. 
---
           If anyone sees this post I would like some feed back. Especially maybe from other console nurse players and see what they think of this. Have you played her on console? If so, for how long? And how long did it take you to master her huge skill gap? Would you recommend this new version of killer to your friends to play? And finally would you recommend this game to your friends. And if so, what would be the drawbacks?
---
Ok, we need Shirtless Myers in heelys
---
Idk why anyone would stand there for 15 mins to just get angry and make reddit posts or whatever . Could have dc‚Äôd and been halfway done another game.
---
Not racist but Claudette is my least favorite character in the game (my friends are black, it‚Äôs okay).
---
Same I was facecamping too lol got billed hard
---

&gt;Self-care

Pick one
---
I've only used it twice and got good ass hillbillies both times. Literally smacked me with a chainsaw, so now I'm light weight scared of that perk lolololol. It was nice tho at first. I'm red ranks now, so around reset I'm gonna try it again to get used to it before going up against red rank killers.
---
Actually if you don‚Äôt mind could you tell me the buffs? I wanna see if an ash levelup is worth it before Adam

For charity sure.

Technically that'd still be blood flavor. Just natural instead of artificial.
---
You can still fake the charge. 
---
If you're talking about reacting to the point when the pig is moving fast, by that point it's already too late around most loops
---
Imagine doing the gen
---
You right, would still be better than it is in its current state though plus what if the healing stacked
---
Seriously!
---
MEME THIEF
---
You're killing a potential teammate whose being chased who has adren
---
They really need to fix the collision on bodies in general. I've had way to many killers body block me in ways that are just bs
---
Let them run from the loop! Doesnt take much to uncrouch and its a free hit.
---
Iridiscent axes are still in the game tho...
---
I'm at the point I concider leaving when I see its doctor because they're always so toxic.
---
If you can activate Mettle of Man in a match, then you can activate it again if you get three more Protection Hits.
---
Tbh I feel like most playerbases would say this after getting into the game. LoL, Hearthstone, CS:GO, etc
---
I love them. Super fun idea.
---
Creative :)
---
Same. I had a kind of mediocre game as hillbilly on the game. This feng was taunting and teabagging all game. Gates were opened and I hook my second kill. Him and a Claudette were teabagging at the gates.  I come full chainsaw charge across the map and feng was teabagging but too far away from the exit line. Insta downed. Grabbed her right at the line and got the kill.
---
The salt was unheard of. Somehow after that it was my fault for running noed and I was shit for running it even though I caught her being cocky.
---
If you make an appointment :)
---
It's so simple yet great i love it.
---
OP is on my level
---
Take my upvote and go get downed by noed.
---
Not putting down the artists who created the skins, excellent job tbh, but these were not the best choices for winning in-game cosmetics imo...
---
Asian name. Content creator. Popularized cheating. Why am I not surprised
---
I was testing out a new Myers build yesterday based around Mad Grit and Agitation. Went against a 4 stack including 2 Blendettes. Ended up 2 hooking everyone, but they all made it out after tbagging at the gates.

It feels pretty oppressive when you see all these talented people out there doing cosplays... and then there's me. But I'm happy you like it.
---
I keep going against ebony moris ;-;
---
lmao
---
Dang
---
You think they should remove hatch?
---
Naw thx :3
---
Some people seriously don't use their brain.
---
I shake my head sometimes, I didn't realise it's a sign of toxicity. I always did it in a "sorry that didn't work" kinda way.
---
Lol, I had a killer messaging me cauz we were using a No-Mither build, even though he got 4k, he was still complaining that we brought No Mither.
---
His argument was that we were trying to bully him even though we were just trying out new builds.
---
Hurled a bunch of abuses to me through PS4 PMs and I had to report him.
---
God these see hard
---
Can't wait :))
---
My rules are simple: 
---
If I had fun, more than likely I‚Äôll give the last person the hatch. 
---
If you were a toxic POS to me, you will definitely get mori‚Äôd or hooked.
---
I'm an idiot. This was the issue. I unpaused it now.
---
Can't wait
---
As in he shoots them and it marks their location  for a bit
---
If the killer is in a chase then i'll finish it first since they're not gonna drop the chase. But if the killer is patrolling I'd rather be safe.

Either way you should go for the down. If they have borrowed, then it's still only 2 hits to down. If they have (or you think they have) decisive, you can just leave them down. Still one less on gens. It's definitely not better to go for the person who saved, unless they are blocking you from the other survivor.
---
it happen to all you need to find the hours where are more surviver online ,for exemple i am in europa  i can play dbd only after 18 gmt+2
---
Where do you find these people, because I barely get hate messages on ps4, even when I‚Äôm going a bit try hard on em.
---
And where do you get this information as to whose in a chase unless you run empathy or only play swf
---
Hey, Franklin's is still a really good perk.
---
Note that borrowed time doesn't waste killers time for chasing the unhooked survivor, but forces you to hit one of the two twice.
---
r/naughty
---
Until they change the way the hatch works that's the only way to give the killer a chance at 4k without betting they dont find hatch first.
---
Fucking yum
---
Lmao time for Haden field cuz I‚Äôm about to farm.
---
I would say bubba more camps, than tunnels.
---
Did you do one of those where you get hooked and just immediately sacrifice yourself because in your head you're like "nope, fuck it". I've been there before...
---
I accepted the prologue rewards and was able to activate the ones I didn‚Äôt do yet.
---
I didn't read the patch notes and ran into this change. Actually a horrible change imo.
---
I'm on console and I reported a couple of people that were working with the killer to get me and my friend killed, provided several videos and such and they banned them both
---
I'm not getting safety pips for them DC'ing though. Should I be? Or is it just if I lose connection in general?
---
And they need to play trapper of all things....
---
Dc‚Äôing for hatch is entirely fair. The game is already ruined if you‚Äôre camping or slugging, and I don‚Äôt see any other reason to do so. If you hate not getting a 4K so much, play survivor. You‚Äôll see how much you want some Dwight to dc once you‚Äôve found hatch against a phase faking spirit.
---
Let the downvoting commence
---
The only thing I miss about Leage of Legends.
---
The easy to read, easy to understand patch notes.
---
Yeah, same. Out of every game I played tonight I was the only one using them. Weird
---
no, no it is pretty serious to go from a game were i should have pipped to one where i depip because someone ALT F4ed
---
Except if you DC hella early it causes the someone to de pip because they didnt score high enough.
---
Best legion cosplay imo. I feel like this is the only one that got the mask right.
---
I'm not even gay and I'm sad for these responses lol
---
Have the tables turned
---
locker good
---
dwight bad
---
I know, I grinded the entire first tier today. I‚Äôm sitting on level 16 in the rift and I‚Äôm very happy with the update.
---
I think it‚Äôs mostly because it‚Äôs not iconic enough
---
I don't boop snoots. I put my snoot in their boop.
---
[Magnificent.](https://youtu.be/Nysb-m49Ol0)
---
Ez fix, up the number of required actions to activate it, but include, grasp saves, healed from down state, gen completions and safe hooks.  
---
Ex: 5 tokens to activate metal of man, But if you heal someone from the downed state, unhook two survivors safely, take a protection hit and finish a generator, you have it activated.  
---
tweeks would be neccisary, but thats what I think.
---
I would say red ranks also dont know how to loop and camp all the pallets
---
I got a reply from the support person that received the ticket saying they had banned them, that's all I've got
---
I like this one. And I‚Äôve been super critical about legion ‚Äúcosplay‚Äù that is nothing more than a paper plate mask and a hoodie. I‚Äôd be genuinely scared of this one.
---
Yes, they are stop asking for nerfs they are the only thing a killer has and even if he dicides to use it, still don't win the game, they don't pip. O stop bitching about them they already where nerft!
---
No havent done that today lol. I play on ps4 so its a pain in the ass to get in a survivor game
---
Yeah I've gotten the charms havent checked the cosmetics cause I was playing survivor all night and didnt end up looking at my killer stuff tonight.
---
Welcome to the enlightenment, playing both sides.
---
Phlogistinator intensifies
---
Like how you suppose to unhook 3 people at end game in one trial? Thats insane
---
are they soft cookies or crunchy cookies
---
Because the devs are incompetent? There decision making is insane?!!
---
It really is
---
Ay a fellow tall person, sadly, the Michael Myers costume I got was far too small
---
Only on NOED. Otherwise I‚Äôll die for you.
---
Thank you. You guys might encourage me to get some more practice in and keep doing this.
---
Apparently it was their level from the ptb that they left untouched ? Kind of sucks for console players but it's nothing to bad I guess lol
---
I usually play after 3 in america since most are out of classes. Today I was playing around 1 though so I guessing everyone was still in class/working.
---
Can confirm, had the same glitch. At least now we can prepare for these, the basement on seems rough.
---
Yellow/green ranks are the tunnel / camp ranks.
---
Before that people are usually clueless or haven't played in the longest while. After that they get that that sort of strat does t work past green.
---
One tip: get DS and just have teammates power through gens to punish the behaviour
---
Someone got wrecked by a freddy
---
The rework made him a much stronger killer. He now has a lot of map pressure and chase potential. Easily top 5 killers. Cant tell if you're salty from going against him and losing or if you're just bad at playing freddy.
---
This is the only good legion cosplay. All the other colspays make the mask look like it was ether on crack or had a few more cromosones. If you are gonna cosplay please be a little more creative than susie frank or julie. What i like to see is an (good) joey cosplay. Sorry for all the complayning just had to get it of my chest. Youre mask looks good (unlike the others). Ggwd
---
Hmm they seem a little bit too hard for casual players...  :/
---
For everyone in awe that he missed, this is *exactly* why you don't shoot a gun one-handed...at a moving target...behind cover. Handguns have a shitload of kick, which is why you use both hands--for stability, and throwing your hand forward and blasting like that is going to send bullets flying everywhere even at pointblank.
---
But based on the fact the victim was a lawyer with an ongoing case against him, I don't think this dude is very bright. Still, insanely lucky that he only took two bullets and both of them were superficial wounds.
---
You prob salty cause you get wrecked by him or aren‚Äôt good with him
---
No, Freddy is in a good place. Git gud.
---
Freddy is a lot better now than pre patch and the changes allow him to get map pressure and have good chase potential. Overall he is in the upper mid tier of killers so i wouldn't say nothing's changed
---
I‚Äôm not either. I think it‚Äôs a common problem.
---
Maybe in that case they will realize killer is hard and that they aren't god tier like they think.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù if they‚Äôre face-camping and tunneling to get a kill. They should have to git gud.
---
If you'd just said you don't like Claudette it would have been fine. Add the first 3 words and the last part in brackets made this way worse.
---
How are you de-pipping with 2 survivors left and on your way to a 3/4 kill. I don't even think camping/tunnelling hard would get you in that position pipping wise.
---
 It's pretty damn hard to de-pip as killer.
---
During struggle with the entity, is it normal to just suddenly die even though you're pressing spacebar and your bar is still pretty high? \~ 40%
---
You accidentally clicked "suggestion" and not "shitpost"
---
Coagulation Cookies
---
Ok, so obviously these are bullshit and must be changed.  At the very least, a lot of these shouldn't be "master challenges" because they're basically impossible.  I mean, I know their goal is to get you to spend money so you can finish the Rift but...fuck that.
---
What are you looking for, a support group. Go cry to your mum.
---
that show scared the shit out of me
---
Lawyer was wise to hold his ground, and the shooter's form was *incredibly* sloppy--like hitting the mark for every stupid thing you could possibly do with a gun to guarantee his shots were as inaccurate as possible.
---
The difference in basic intelligence saved his life.
---
What op items do survivors have? Keys?
---
Killer doing daily doesn't get a 4K  
---
Survivors: haha ez baby killer get gud  
---
Killer with his popcorn after casually getting a 4K  
---
Survivors: tunneling camper gtfo sweaty nerd, reported enjoy your ban
---
These seem difficult for hardcore players..
---
That's not a problem with freddy that just a killer who doesn't care about others fun it happens just move to next game
---
They're getting there. Cut them some slack
---
yes it sounds like a rocket lift off
---
If they are fave camping and tunneling the problem isn‚Äôt Freddy it‚Äôs that they are a crappy killer.
---
Or they could give Freddy a skateboard since he has used one in the movies
---
LOL, so many bitch Survivor Mains in here justifying it. You're right op it is bullshit plain and simple. It doesn't make me mad but I've had it happen enough times that I know they just do it so their dumbass friend can escape. Everybody commenting and calling you a crybaby has done it at least once.
---
The Entity tortures those that displease it. Until his rework, Freddy probably got tortured a lot.
---
Also Quentin lit him on fire before they both got kidnapped, so most likely his sausage is bbq‚Äôd. Again.
---
That sucks
---
I gave a Laurie a free hatch once, and in post-game chat she complained and was salty because I had Franklin'd her toolbox.  
---
Have to say after that I very rarely gave hatch, only when I felt sorry for a survivor or if they played really well.
---
Just had a 3 David match earlier tonight. T'was glorious.  
---
Imagine being a killer in such a scenario four survivors join the lobby, and one by one they all switch to David King and take off their shirts.
---
Imo that map just sucks in general, i wish they started doing map overhauls.
---
No just Ebony's, namely cause you can kill all 4 survivors over the far more balanced just 1.
---
I have survivors hold the game hostage all the time. No one does gens, just hides. It's trash. I didn't even know you could block ppl in up there. That guy is actually evil.
---
Bunny Feng?
---
That sucks man, that's why I got a the dickies jumpsuit so I could get my size. All I needed was my measurements to see my size on the size chart.
---
The comical explanation to this is that they put 2 and 2 together, as in:  
---
"anger + electronics = money loss and angry parents"  
---
"anger + flaming random people = no money loss = win win"  
---
kek
---
If we‚Äôre talking about killers how about reverse the nerf on nurse for consoles. Now that‚Äôs just dumb. No one will touch nurse again lol and that‚Äôs how you kill a game my friend
---
Yes and I fucking love it. I just leveled hag last week to unlock ruin and BBQ was the last perk I really needed. An absolute godsend.
---
why does the menu look so bland for 2018 and 2019
---
Believe it or not, handguns are very inaccurate unless the shooter is experienced and using proper form. Between only having one hand on his gun and moving so erratically, it'd be incredibly hard to hit a static target, let alone one that's moving erratically, even if you are that close.
---
It's obvious the shooter had no idea what he was doing, and that saved his victims life. Imagine being so incompetent you bungle a shooting in broad daylight from two feet away, I hope he's in jail.
---
Its legit. Its the winner of the community skin design content on the killer side.
---
I'm not racist, but you put that very well.
---
u have to expect some of that as the ps4 taps into the world of the entity. its for ur own protection so u dont get sucked in as a survivor
---
Probably because you‚Äôve gotta crouch everywhere and eventually she‚Äôs gonna find you at which point you‚Äôre fucked because Hag might honestly be the best person in chases on indoor maps because of all the traps you have to run through in a chase.
---
Nice, wp
---
Her power is only good for getting ridiculously stupid hitbox [hits](https://streamable.com/3a4yz).
---
2017 is still the best.
---
I managed to get thanaphobia in time
---
Feels good
---
People don't realize its a massive buff, since endurance protects you from one-hits as well.
---
I‚Äôve done 100% of that gen solo numerous times and never gotten any achievement :(
---
League player since beta.. I haven‚Äôt had toxicity as bad as DbD players for a couple years. Maybe a bad one here or there but DbD.. rotten.
---
new freddy sucks. the old one had a unique power. but alas, he was too beautiful for this world
---
My problem with that is I can t stand playing survivor, i dont find it fun, i either escape or don't, even with Michael myers the games arnt fun as survivor, i can't stand doing gens and looping the killer is boring as shit to me, I'm a killer main who loves killing, that's all I want, i dont camp, i dont tunnel, i only use OP perks and addons for the memes or if I wanna just have some fun and torture the survivors the whole game, i ran fragrant tuft and j myers memorial and i had each survivor on their second hook and kept downing them to let them heal eachother and gain points and let them run from me and get away to just knock em down again, then on their last gen I killed them all, i got 32000 bp and i ran survivor pudding with distressing and bbq and chili (purely for bp but it's also super fuckin OP with this build)
---
Also I ran overwhelming presence and iron grasp
---
Just for anyone who's lookin for a good farming build that legit tortures survivors, like I'm sorry survivors I hope yall got enough bp but i ain't letting any of ya live when I'm goin for a perfect 4k
---
Then when I'm actually farming with survivors I'll run bbq, distress, throw in some bps and hook everyone twice then just knock em down and let em escape.
---
Because they didn't change the colors. The menu already has a weird yellow/orange color.
---
Since it protects against any attack, its a massive upgrade.
---
oof 3 killers i play/want to play are up there
---
i think im getting mine cuz it says 325
---
The best dbd content
---
Fuck man, this whole sub is infested with swf Survivor mains. I'm with you, I seriously wish they would because I'm fucking sick of facing swf 4 to 5 ranks higher than me. You're damn right I would lobby dodge.
---
Remember that these are all not time limited. This Archive, as well as other future released archives will remain in the game and can be done at any time. Also aren't required to level your battlepass, not to mention People can choose not to do them. 
---
I couldn't be happier to have- essentially another version of achievements, in the game. I love this.
---
Alright cool, they‚Äôll probably get it sorted then.
---
For fun I did a Legion game where I never used Frenzy and had zero perks and zero add ons. I got 9 or 10 hooks and a 2K. Opened the exit gate myself because why not. The two remaining survivors made it to said exit gate and tea bagged like they were hot shit.
---
I hate this so goddamn much. Every single bit of it
---
If its a major deal I have a solution; make two seperate ones and you pick which one. Its just an extra tab with the same stuff. Once you do one on either role its blacked out for both so you can't get double rewards.
---
Fucking mental. Most of the survivor ones are borderline impossible.
---
Thank God I‚Äôm not the only one. I thought I was just going crazy.
---
I feel that.
---
Oh okay.  Thanks mate.
---
* Bond
---
* If the Obsession is being chased then the legs wiggle
---
* If someone was recently hit
---
* Like you said SWF and empathy are options
---
* On maps like auto haven you usually see where killer is.
---
If I have no info i'll assume the killer is in a chase
---
If you‚Äôre not pipping- that‚Äôs on you. You have four people, one leaves, so you have three left. Between three people you should be able to hit pips. Taking out something in the game simply because you can‚Äôt counter it or play differently is stupid. It‚Äôs not as serious as you‚Äôre putting it off to be.
---
Well at least they get points for it now.
---
Don't worry, I also hate niggers.
---
I was afraid of this. Some of these will be quite difficult to get and survivors can easily dc to prevent some of them from being completed. These challenges don't expire, right?
---
You got 14 games in 2 hours?
---
They won't lol, because they didn't play killer at all they will be on rank 20 and because they have basic game sense they'll kill new players easily and then think to themselfs that killer is easy.
---
69th comment yay!
---
Boop the snoot from beyond ‚ù§
---
What he says when he gets revealed
---
&gt; Sacrafice 4 survivors in the basement
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Complete this challenge in a single trial
---
Can't help but think that playing insidious LF would be the easiest way to do this. I'm so sorry future survivors please no dc.
---
The filters helping you cheat a bit. But it's really nice!
---
these better fuckin change pretty damn soon
---
I never specified items my dude. But yeah that's one of em.
---
He‚Äôs not Asian
---
Bodyblocking to hold hostage IS against the rules
---
Make a support ticket with pics
---
That dude seriously needs to know how to fucking play, no offense to him...
---
This also happens on PC.
---
Carefully, he's a hero
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt like the new lobby look, I always press escape to go back to the old view but just asks if you want to leave the lobby &gt;.&gt;
---
I don't doubt you have a problem, but I've not had one.
---
Depending on the age and other factors your playstation could need a good clean and some new thermal paste that can make a difference.
---
is this true? the only reason i don‚Äôt play killer is because first person perspectives in games make me extremely motion sick and often trigger migraines. i hope i‚Äôll be able to do the archives
---
Survivors don't have to open the gates. The killer can open the gate. The Doctor is the one holding the game hostage because the 2 survivors are trapped. Why is this so hard for people to understand? Do you think BHVR would think that the survivors were the ones holding the game hostage??
---
no, you have 2, because 1 dc's which isnt the same as hooking, and the other get hatch. you get a max of 2
---
Here is the thing, sometimes it is a good strategy to remove certain players quickly, but if you go against decent survivors, they gonna gen rush the hell out of you and its your own fault. Its different to down the same survivor simply cause they run into you after they get unhooked vs trying to tunnel them. I will down you if I see you, even if you just got unhooked. I'm gonna intentionally tunnel you, but if you give me a free down, I'ma punish it.
---
I was so happy when I heard about this today. It's the last perk I really been wanting and really didn't want to have to buy Leatherface to get it. I just leveled up hag last week for ruin.
---
So no more Insta heals?
---
It's a cool concept, but killers queue takes so much time. By the time you're found a lobby as a killer, a survivor game might be ending or ended and started queuing
---
Not that surprising IMO.
---
Lots of people like to open a chest if nearby at start because it's so free for BP, and at 4 chest base per game IIRC, even 2 chest being opened by others prevents it.
---
Dont want to sound rude but am I missing something? You can only use the syptic when you're injured so it wouldnt matter if you got instadowned or not
---
that is very wrong, its pretty easy to infact, especially at purple or red, im in green myself, and 2 escapes is maybe a safety pip, i dont tunnel nor camp.
---
Idk why.. but I laughed too hard when I saw this screenshot.
---
What, you don‚Äôt have a time machine? Scrub. /s
---
i would if it was earned, but it wasn't.
---
guessing the ppl who are downvoting me do not understand or some killers do not want that trade lol
---
Ran better also. No stuttering, and I wouldn't dip below 60 fps with a 4gb 680 max settings.
---
Damnit Nea! You're not a survivor!
---
the other reason is that "lol baby killer EZ LMAO LOOK I ESCAPED YOUR TRASH" people are toxic. DCing should never be a viable strat in any game.
---
Nonsense mate
---
You're telling me to get good but you're the one who needs swf at high ranks, I've made it to rank 1 solo q multiple timeS
---
Umm.. before you try to talk smack... learn how to spell... it‚Äôs survivor.. not ‚Äúsurviver‚Äù
---
I played against him today. He was super sweet post chat, really wholesome dude.
---
Just walk in straight line amright. I once heard someone saying that killer was brain dead unironically
---
I got a Camping M1 Huntress
---
As a BL user, the fact that there isn't a giant leap from this house irritates the fuck out of me.
---
i..i never said that..
---
Hehehe, I see what you did there. But thanks!
---
here is the thing *i wasnt camping, i was litterally billy running around like a fucking mad man*
---
The mind games got me then! He must of stalked until i went to run, Stopped to fool me into thinking I cannot move, stalked me when i felt as though i was fucked, and fucked me
---
Yeah, some of the rewards in the archives can only be obtained from killer only challenges (there are some that can be achieved by both however).
---
Sorry to hear about that, sounds like it sucks
---
What happened to the third person? Four people play the game. One gets hatch, one leaves(dc), where are the other two? Even so, you didn‚Äôt do anything during the trial to get pips before this silliness occurred? I mean I am so confused as to why you‚Äôre not getting any pips.
---
RIP second wind
---
Ah, I get it now. Thanks!
---
On PS4 it‚Äôs the exact opposite. Killers get in instantly and survivors wait forever. Really odd that it‚Äôs so different on different platforms.
---
They look brittle in texture but it‚Äôs hard to tell, kinda curious too
---
I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt agree that it was useful but I‚Äôm saying I wasn‚Äôt an intended mechanic
---
R.I.P
---
Yes Mr. Fairfield, you may hide in the lockers for as long as you want. We will be here
---
no, thats exactly what happened, 2 gens left, got 2 sacrifices and then the dc+ hatch ended the game, I safety piped, but BARELY, partly because my chases were nto long enough, I was punished for being good at ending chases. also watch some DBD killers in red rank, youll see what im talking about, but either way, that is no excuse for DCing for hatch to ever be ok.
---
Hope you sent in this as a bug report as well.
---
One problem though is that in yellow ranks it feels like 70% of the time I get hooked the killer just camps there and all the 3 other randoms just instantly stop what they're doing and run to the hook.
---
God I need to get a friend to play this game with me. Playing survivor in low ranks with randoms is fucking horrible.
---
Eh I‚Äôm going to feel so dirty
---
I'm confused about how a bunch of you are saying "what if they are camping the hook" then..just kill yourself on the hook instead? like???? that makes 0 sense "instead of killing myself on the hook to let them escape, which still lets me get points, ill DC so I depip" and with slugging, I'm not talking about that, I'm talking I just downed the 4th guy and they dc WHEN THEY GET DOWNED.
---
I swear I get so many steam profile comments from survivors its insane
---
Where was this announced, I doubt doubt it I just missed it...
---
Thank you!
---
"Come on Sidney, paint me like one of your dead girls... Or I'll turn you into one."
---
This ^
---
Why is it bad on consoles?
---
I like him too but stopped playing him for a while now, I got one bad game and didn‚Äôt play him anymore.
---
imagine feeling bad using a perk :(
---
I hooe these aren't real. Because this is a farming thing....and i don't want to play a game that pushes me to do that....
---
Solo four gens? 
---
Yeah. No.
---
I fucking refuse. I don't want to be a scum again
---
So when will the event end?
---
Insert a face that‚Äôs like what the pizza rolls sees when it‚Äôs in the microwave and put it in front of the blood points and make it like what the blood points see when I‚Äôm about to spend them on op stuff
---
I‚Äôm not a big fan off ghostface I‚Äôm not great with him.
---
Man come on let people thank the devs sometimes it‚Äôs a thankless job let‚Äôs show support
---
If you report in game only it seems like nothing is ever done... but it seems if you report in game then open a ticket with proof it often gets handled.
---
Just gotta be as nice as possible to those players. Not because you need to be a positive influence but it makes them mad as shit
---
Half of these scenarios are really unrealistic.
---
People are going to farm these to complete their Rift, making the last part of this season really fucking boring and tedious.
---
what did the others do the whole time lol
---
ok ill run you through the whole game, ill nukber the survivors 1-4, ok? 
---
Que as billy for daily chainsawing, go with lube and light for fast saw charge.
---
Get in game, zoom around for a bit because its fun, do the normal song and dance for 3-4 gens, in the process hooking survivor 1 and 2
---
4th gen done, i saw over there and find survivor 3, proceed to down them. Notice they are close to hatch, but i see survivor 4 has almost healed up survivor and begin chasing them off, que me bumping into a lot of things with the saw so they get a big lead, cant risk them them healing up their friend so i chase. finally down survivor 4 around the other side of the map, then i think "wait, survivor 3 is probably on hatch now, so i should go hook them first to make sure they dont get hatch"
---
Saw over there and see survivor 3, just need to walk a bit to get to them, Que survivor 4 Disconnecting from the match and the hatch opening right before i can grab them. my 4k goes to a 2k, i barely depip (might have black piped, this is foggy now but i know it was close to one or the other) because of lack of gen defense (im a rank 8 billy with enduring and sloppy) and chase time (sawing people). so my 4k, which i worked for, mind gaming 4 survivors, keeping as much pressure on gens as i could being a bad billy, running the loops and what have you, gets turned into a 2k because someone ALT F4'd. Its not so much that i lost out on pips, or bp, its that i lost out on them because of no fault of my own. I didn't mess up to lose, they litteraly LEFT THE GAME TO MAKE ME LOSE. why on earth is it even at all ok in someones head that LEAVING THE GAME is a viable strategy FOR THE GAME.
---
Isn‚Äôt SWF geared towards the highest rank of the person in the lobby? Or did they change that?
---
So is this like having new dailys but it's actually possible to get ones for survivors now?
---
I don't.  There is an element of skill in proper bodyblocking.  But it needs to hard stop after say 10 seconds of contact.
---
Problem is, if they open the gates, the endgame starts and the doctor ends up with 2 kills or more.
---
Its not just a perk, its t h a t perk
---
That isn't holding the game hostage.  Because in the end, you can kill them, and progress the game.
---
I watched the show, but I still thought it was funny. It looks so unnatural. As if gravity just pulls him down lol.
---
Hi friend ;)
---
I think I saw somewhere on official forum that it's November 13th, but can't find the link atm.
---
Not you the guy with the attitude
---
What's a battlepass?
---
We're entering the dark ages
---
Tier 1 Mikey used to be completely undetectable no matter what at all times; now he just works like normal stealth killers
---
Only certain perks like Kindred will trump stealth abilities now, and Kindred has the trade off of you being on the hook to activate
---
Spine Chill is about to be mvp
---
Aye but if it‚Äôs for charity I think it‚Äôs worth having can never have enough goodness in the world
---
&gt; If the Obsession is being chased then the legs wiggle
---
For real? I had no idea why those wiggled. I thought it was random
---
Meanwhile I just had a spirit facecamping in a game with 5 petals :)
---
Survivors healing = survivors not working on gens
---
2017 by far the better , Classic DBD when ?
---
"Completely repair 4 generators using dark sense in one trial"
---
Does this mean what I think it means, are you supposed to repair 4 generators by yourself?
---
Check out skemooo on youtube he does high quality renders of the skin he may have what you're looking for.
---
Rainbow Map works great with Detective's tho
---
So what you're saying is a Freddy just killed you and you're a bit upset about it.
---
holding the game hostage is only when the killer makes it impossible to end the game. if the other survivor has just opened the exit and escaped the end game collapse would have finished things
---
This is pretty epic, ngl
---
 
---
I play both because playing survivor solo is so boring, I need a friend to play survivor or else I just get bored holding m1 on a gen without conversation.
---
Still could be the rift thing iv still no idea what to call them I had to sweat earlier to get all 4 kills any means necessary and I said challenge/daily
---
3 survivors after EGC started... Not with my normal build and gamestyle, that's for sure. I'll need Bloodwarden, probably
---
I'll give it a shot, I hope so because I wanna play ghost faceüòÇ
---
Well, I usually have a full stack but on days I don't feel free to add me, or pm me for a community discord I'm setting up
---
If you DC fast enough you can get the games faster
---
That's the problem - some of these challenges force me to use builds I don't like (I don't run NOED on any killer, haven't used Bloodwarden in ages - endgame builds are not fun for me). 
---
Right now it feels like I'll just say "fuck lore, fuck the Rift" and just won't bother with completing any such challenges. That also means I won't buy battlepass, because without completing challenges there's no way I'll unlock enough levels to feel my money were well spent.
---
It really just irritates me. Like I could've gotten that hit into the dying state but the game just stops
---
It's kind of like how he has perfect posture when dicking a gen
---
Why is he called baby Dwight?
---
No they can't, It's astronomically harder, if not impossible for survivors to hold the game hostage, the killer can slug them and even if they keep getting up they will eventually just die.
---
Personally im never more bored when im being slugged for 4 minutes cause the killer is so desperate for a 4k.
---
They wanna die that bad
---
Same, I kept thinking Jake was crouching down to sabo the hook.
---
Same for me. "Sacrifice 4 players in the basement"? Why? I don't like to play this way. "Use NOED"? As if it's not one of the most hated perks in the game. And devs force killers to use it, nice move.
---
OMG
---
I know I'm gonna be running small game when that happens lol
---
Dead By Daylight always makes my PS4 run at Mach 5.
---
The title screen has an uncapped frame rate so the processor goes WILD
---
The Winter Solstice event that happened right afterwards was amazing too
---
I'm a rank 13 and have had the game for like 6 months, playing occasionally and I still have fun.
---
Yeah, most likely a dirty scumbag facecamping for shits and giggles
---
You have the right idea. More accurately, it's when a killer focuses on one survivor the entire game, even if it means the killer ignore other survivors.
---
Though some killers tunnel on purpose, most of the time (in my experience as a killer and survivor), the killer just *happens* to find that one survivor on accident multiple times and is called a tunneler for this accident. 
---
Even more commonly though, you'll see this phrase used primarily by salty survivors that are angry they got killed. 9/10 times, these survivors weren't even tunneled that much.
---
2021: Not even a pumpkin, its just a lone carved watermelon
---
I can't even imagine a world where a survivor doesn't DC when I down 3 of them with NOED. It's unfathomable.
---
I'm not say specificly the spirit music (if that's the one creatorshave did) , what I'm saying is that checking every single part of these songs is not worth to them, because they might miss sonething and get in trouble, it's better for them, if they want new music, make it in house, don't twist my words, I never said that anything specifically about creatorshave
---
Imagine Legion with Heelys
---
"this isn't holding the game hostage, because in the end, you can open the gates, and progress the game"
---
I kinda like it. It's not that bad. I wasn't expecting narration at all, it's really something I didn't know I wanted. 
---
You can turn it off if you don't like it?
---
Ive only heard the voice on the first story you unlock, but I thought he did a decent job with the acting, suprisingly enough.  If he slowed down I do think it'd add to the performance, but not disappointed at all.  
---
Also Im absolutely loving the challenges. Very ahopy with the update, Im glad I didnt decide to burn down BHVR after it was delayed 8 days
---
that's just a porn sub
---
Im taking my time. 
---
Just need 28 serums and im happy
---
Run shadowborn
---
I mean honestly thats what a challenge is, the basic tier 1 challeneges are easy and some people have pretty much finished them already
---
Tik tok is cringe bro
---
Nah this game really has become Un-fun
---
I'm not giving excuses, this happens all the time, a box in Csgo had to be removed because a couple of the skins had imagery that was not from the creator of the skin for example
---
Next tomb?
---
put out*  OP dont know what up
---
he could be playing on console

I dc whenever I want, if I don‚Äôt like what I see I head out, I‚Äôve been rank one so the skill is there, I just know from experience now, if I‚Äôm not enjoying it I can care less what other people think, I‚Äôll dc. If I‚Äôm losing a match to a fair killer that‚Äôs fine, but if there‚Äôs toxicity or certain killers with certain perks, I‚Äôm not wasting my time
---
So i've done the survivor path up until This is happening and i'm unable to select it. I can select killer ones and I was able to click the epilogue
---
Oh yeah, I love this update. Even if you don't buy the premium rift you still get a bunch of free stuff and all of the challenges still, which also give a bunch of bloodpoints and lore to go with it. 
---
I love this update a lot.
---
Same here. Don't know the solution to it. Hopefully, they address it in the next patch.
---
Camping is not a reportable offense.
---
He was blocking the doorway to prevent anyone from leaving. It‚Äôs not even about the camping. He was using his body to block anyone from exiting.
---
I want to see how fast a 3x PWF + NOED + T3 Myers moves
---
Oh yeah, completely forgot about the bp. Im at 950k and only played for a few hours today.  Honestly just top marks.
---
You won a fight!
---
I'd like to say this is a good way of handling toxicity but if I'm being honest with you, you're giving the toxic players exactly what they want.
---
Noed itself doesn't bother me, but the challenge requires me to have 3 alive during egc...thats against how most killers play and it's practically forcing you to play the opposite of how youre supposed to. Oh well, suppose thats why its called a challenge.
---
&gt; Can somebody give me any reason to stay in a killer match where you're not having a good time?
---
Why "killer match" specifically? Are there reasons to stay in survivor match when you're not having a good time?
---
I mean, if everyone will leave "unfun" trials, how many games will be finished at all? "Oh, it killer X, not fun, I DC", "Oh, it's perk Y, not fun, DC", "Oh, it's an item Z, not fun, DC", "Oh, someone already DCed, not fun, DC".
---
DBD runs on unreal engine 4.... have you even seen other games run that? Look at mk 11, that game is so beautiful and realistic with unreal 4....
---
Add in devour and bloodlust 3
---
Four horsemen of the Apocalypse
---
Unless he was holding you hostage in the game (something like 10 minutes, I believe) by bodyblocking, then it is not a reportable offense. Holding games hostage as either the survivors or killer is a reportable offense.
---
The fact that gens were getting done means it isn't reportable. If he had all 4 of you stuck it would be.
---
This dude deserves to be banned
---
More lobby time?
---
So making anyone unable to leave basement isn‚Äôt reportable? K. I‚Äôll be sure to play trapper for the rest of the time I play killer and just camp basement and get my 4ks.
---
Funnily enough, MK11 is actually on a modified version of UNREAL 3 lol. That goes to show, a game on Unreal 3 is still miles ahead of this.
---
Dude is just a trash killer
---
I dont see it, whats happening?
---
Any killer can do it, it's even stronger on huntress. I would suggest trying that.
---
Like I said, it's about holding people hostage not about using a valid game mechanic. As long as you're playing, then it's fair play.
---
Ikr? They could've easily made add-ons that increase or decrease the different aspects of her dash. But she only has 1 yellow and 2 brown add-ons that affect it, while the majority of her 17 other add-ons affect her boxes and traps in negligible ways. Outside of "box/bag of gears", "ruleset no.2", "tampered timer", and the add-ons that affect her lunge, every other add-on can be ignored.
---
you're rude to every single person on here. Again if you said "gens were getting done" it's not bannable. Sorry you're upset you got outplayed.
---
When you uninstall a steam game some of its files remain. Sometimes those files are settings, others could be 100gb worth of Skyrim mods that apparently don‚Äôt get uninstalled despite also being a part of the files.(based on a true story, also see Garry‚Äôs Mod workshop content for more wasted space from a game you don‚Äôt have installed)
---
the archives make us use a lot of perks we normally wouldnt use... it is what it is... death to all!
---
I had a guy tell me I was a bad survivor yet he is knowingly playing on a hot spot to get free 4k‚Äôs. It was so bad you could barely run without rubber banding 10 feet every 2 steps
---
Second wind as useless as ever.
---
Lmao because one gen got done by the two people he didn‚Äôt trap down there? Stfu. I wasn‚Äôt rude to anyone but the first person to reply and not to you. You probably play this way too because you can‚Äôt get kills and get juked the entire 20 minute match.
---
I think the answer to your question is I don't really give a shit. I didn't pay behavior money to not have fun. If people are being sweaty and shitty then why bother staying in a match to be their punching bag? My life is miserably hard day to day, why bother with this added insult?
---
Who unhooked you? Two were hooked, others did gens... It reads like he was camping, preventing others from entering the basement.
---
I‚Äôm pleased to see this upsets killers haha I definitely dc when I know my team mate found hatch, it‚Äôs like a spit in the face to the killer haha
---
Lmao actually nope I'm red rank on both sides and ya you are rude as hell. You're pretty dumb too since you cant grasp what you're being told but that's ok keep being upset at some random on the internet it's hilarious;)
---
The person that ran down there? As he was setting his trap? Like huh? 
---
He was setting his traps all around him and stood in the part of the hallway where you were completely body blocked
---
(He says, when I dodge people with blendettes with 4 medkits in hand, meanwhile, some people still dodge moris which are equally bullshit)
---
And again you literally are saying people cant read when you're being told the correct answer for your situation lmao
---
They need to add matchmaking bans to leavers
---
Lmao I‚Äôm sure you are. Like I said, you probably do exactly what he does and then wait for teammates to die so you can take hatch. Get a life and get skill so you quit camping and crouching around as your teammates do everything. Quit blowing up my inbox by spamming me with edits.
---
Lmfaooo you're so salty. Keep whining cause you got outplayed. I bet you're like rank 20 since you cant even grasp this.
---
So, basically, what you wrote was not what actually happened. Ok...
---
Yeah you really are salty you got called out. Not my problem. Play better ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Lmfao you're dumb you think you're somehow calling me out? What was your point of the post just to bitch at everyone who responded cause you got owned?
---
or dc to give hatch
---
Again, sorry you can‚Äôt read and I didn‚Äôt go into a 6 paragraph essay, killer main.
---
thats not leaving tho, they're not even in game.
---
That makes no sense. You can say him holding game hostage for an hour is valid gameplay since I‚Äôm ‚Äústill playing‚Äù
---
Tbf I only get mad and want to DC if the person clearly isn't better than me. IE I mindgame them at a jungle gym, but they have dead hard so they get the pallet anyway. I appreciate survivors outplaying me. Just my anecdote
---
Pretty sure op has a few screws loose lol
---
Godspeed you magnificent bastard
---
Again, sorry you got called out. Play better ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You let a trapper confine you to a basement and are now crying about it on Reddit and calling other people bad. You shouldn't throw stones from the basement of your glass house.
---
Try setting profile to private so they can't check your friends
---
the thing is, its not really leaving if youre only in the lobby, which is my issue rn
---
He saved his teammate right before he died
---
I really can‚Äôt wait for the disconnecting punishments to be implemented lol
---
Lmaoooo what a chad hahaha
---
Sorry you've gotten called out by everyone whos responded to you lmao. Enjoy staying at rank 20 if you cant even grasp what happened in your situation üòÜ
---
im on ps4, they can tell its swf bc everyone loads in at my once
---
I had a poor game trying to do a Forever Freddy build but fucked it up and everyone escaped. I know I played bad. Survivors felt it neccesary to rip on me in endgame chat, because lolol sweaty killer with Ruin and Dying Light couldn't get any kills.
---
It was just such a... "Why?" moment. I wasn't salty at all. If I do bad, I know I played bad. I couldn't comprehend why people who WON felt the need to be so rude. It was mind boggling. I'm a bit disappointed that they all left before I could just simply say I play to play so I don't care.
---
‚ÄúLet‚Äù? I got hooked in the basement. Lmao it‚Äôs not like I walked to the basement and stood there. Lol you must be that dudes alt account.
---
I don't play killer enough to get at a high rank, so any challenge that has to do with sacrificing/hooking is pretty easy. otherwise, i just play friendly killer (meaning i still chase and hit, but no hooks) because i don't want to give low ranks a hard time :(
---
And thats exactly why people slug
---
Right?? Op is so oblivious it's hilarious
---
What show is this?
---
Okay, never said I wanted him banned. I just asked if it was or wasn‚Äôt against the rules and if it‚Äôs punishable. I never said oh my god ban him right now!!! I asked a question.
---
I see it as a counter to gens flying by so fast. Survivors can do totems, which gives me
---
More time to patrol gens.
---
Same. The last update is eating away at my PS4. Half of my games are unplayable.
---
Outstanding play
---
What they should do is this 5 dodges or streight away leaves in a week space resorts to a 1 day ban and a 3 day probation. 
---
Then they add a forfeit button for killers after 10 mins or 4 gens done alowun them to leave but survivors still have fun
---
The 18th
---
Not one of my proudest moments tbh....
---
Yikes, good one
---
Well if it‚Äôs not a reportable offence it‚Äôs not against the rules is it.
---
I love how everyone down votes becuase they assume I‚Äôm on pc and don‚Äôt know the struggles of a console nurse let alone this nerf
---
Had a laggy ass ghostface on Xbox, and I messaged him after asking him why he had walmart wifi.. and he just sent a gg... soooo.... yeah
---
Corrupt can be replaced by Ruin, and probably Pop. But i'd try different things to see what you like. If you need BP, by all means run BBQ. 
---
But generally yeah, i just want to find people and stalk ASAP, and then snowball my T3 as hard as possible. The reason i dont like BBQ that much, is that if they're showing up on BBQ - theyre far enough away that i'm losing the hook i've got to go to them, and my T3 will have worn off
---
So you knew they were two different things but fucked it up?
---
You can take your fucking attitude and be gone like lol killer mains are so rude lmao
---
You get them in the rift, but to claim them you have to enter to the Archives, they don't get claimed automatically.
---
Yeah, you said he surrounded himself with traps, so the bodyblocking was irrelevant.  In addition he cant stand on his own trap, and you keep changing your story.  
---
This is like complaining that you got trapped in a corner while a billy was charging his saw.  Youre dead, and the 2 seconds of bodyblocking probably didnt make too much of a difference.
---
Does anyone know what happens if you fail a challenge? I'm dreading those that need to be completed in one trial exactly because of things like this.
---
If it were any faster. If it was activated when someone was on hook it would be impossible to get it off in time which would be stupid..
---
&gt; how come most killers are op?
---
Get to red ranks.
---
&gt; how come the killer see all generators? but survivors cant
---
Run Deja Vu lmao?
---
&gt; how come when someone dies or leaves at 5 generator, the generator count doesnt decrease to how many players are on the map. for example: if 3/4 survivors left the game why does that 1 survivor have to power up 5 generators??? why not 2???
---
Disconnects are a known rampant issue that the devs are yet to implement a fix (hopefully soon tbh)
---
&gt; about to be 2020 btw
---
Better than it was in 2016 by a damn long shot.
---
He BODYBLOCKED the chunk of the hallway so you can‚Äôt get by him and are stuck staring at him. It wasn‚Äôt two seconds lmfao. It was like three minutes. Soooo yeah.
---
Such a great response.  
---
‚ÄúEither you hate BHVR with us or you‚Äôre dick riding. There‚Äôs no possible way for you to be actually happy or grateful about what‚Äôs BHVR done other than that you‚Äôre dick riding‚Äù.
---
Just then I realized I googled it and I was wrong so sorry for misinformation
---
if it was for 3 minutes then you couldve healed and ran by him..?
---
Personally I only recebtly started playing on PC(played on ps4 before this) and I always do my part and wrote "gg" after a game, no matter win or lose or survivor or killer.
---
It's common sense but you good, alot of people like that mistake
---
thats a good idea! maybe make it so 3 dodges a day gives some kind of lockout, only an hour or so, even that should disincentivize killers from dodging too much. shouldnt be too harsh a penalty cuz then theyll just dc in game instead
---
I'm gonna start using this perk cause I waste too much time actually finding a generator. Additionally, this would stop me from 3-genning myself on accident.
---
How bout both? Lol
---
I think I'm finally starting to get it. I played against a ton of Survivors way lower than me (not on purpose) with Killers that aren't the best without ruin AND without NOED to really learn how to do things. (I also watched some of the best killers or killer matches to see what they do and it really helps)
---
But sometimes, it really feels like even when you're being really really optimal yourself, that one SWF whose hellbent on ruining the game for someone will get what they want and you just gotta take that L and realize that hey, the other 20 survivors were cool and maybe you should have brought ruin. 
---
You really only win when you dont let the SWF bother you. They don't actually play the game to play the game, most of the time they only have fun with the endgame insults, say GG and Lol and they lose more than you do.
---
So I‚Äôm gonna repeat myself again
---
He put one trap right next to him, one trap directly behind him, and one trap directly behind him to the other side. Basically double trapping one side of the hallway and then standing and trapping the other side. So if you were to get hit, you‚Äôd step into the other trap and get caught anyway. Like you know four squares? Only one square was his body
---
Fair enough should of figured it out before hand before posting like a goober
---
Lmao wow I made it to reddit. I was that Freddy that went against you on xbox earlier haha.
---
It‚Äôs a proven bug the devs are working to fix.
---
Lmao, so if there is a bad map spawn, you just DC because you want to have everything easy? That way you will never get better, and if you keep doing it you will eventually get banned
---
Ahh yes, stfu.
---
Then like I said, the bodyblocking literally didnt matter.  Have one of you take a hit and run into the single trapped side, so the other could get through.  Not hard.
---
Congrats on 100%, but I find it hard to believe that only 0.2% of players closed the hatch 30 times.
---
The gens were already finished. Hello??!! People just need to stop being assholes.
---
Using your body to block part of the hallway is body blocking as you‚Äôre using your. BODY to BLOCK people from leaving an area.
---
i could‚Äôve sworn the shrine just refreshed yesterday
---
Your title implies so much salt. You won‚Äôt find an echo chamber here.
---
I mean, it was easy to know that when he said that he DC if there is a bad map spawn, instead of trying to loop and get better.
---
There was a trap there that you couldnt walk through anyway though.  So if anything he was body blocking you from one of his traps..?
---
Okay how are Bubba and Clown not S tier?
---
He was basically making it so if he hit us, we would‚Äôve ran by him and into a trap regardless. But he didn‚Äôt try to hit any of us and stood there
---
When the survivors are stacking on a gen not realising you're close
---
Looks sick
---
This guy knows.
---
Every survivor main says the same thing.
---
"I play Killer at rank 1, no perks, no add ons, 4k every game, and I barely have to try. You are just garbage. Killer is EZ."
---
Knowing damn well they don't even know that scratch marks exist prior to the Stranger things DLC.
---
No that counts towards it plus theu have to play untill the forfeits available so 4 gens done or 10 mins played
---
me after one game with pallet Freddy LMAO
---
Oh boo hoo
---
&gt; how come when im 10 mins into the game with 15k and know im going to die and i want to disconnect that i lose all of my points right after disconnecting
---
Because it's a punishment for leaving a game.
---
Game design.
---
&gt; how come most killers are op? 
---
Yeah, sure.
---
Please fix the frame rate in the lobbies on console, it's like 10fps, it's atrocious.
---
 So then people with bad internet shouldn't be allowed to play survivor. Yesterday I was playing as a killer and I found someone who has teleporting because of his bad connection, so it took me a long time to catch him.
---
Atrocious frame rates. Sometimes it looks like 3-5 FPS when blinking and seeing frames of a survivor is significantly less than if it would be on pc. I saw a video that puts this really well but I forgot the link to it. I‚Äôve had many situations where all a survivor had to do was 360 me or 180 me after I blink and swing and they would be completely gone. It‚Äôs like they disappeared because it‚Äôs that‚Äôs slow
---
Just to note: dedicated servers as they are currently still reward killers for bad connections.
---
You‚Äôre a fucking psycho.
---
No.  This is reportable and anyone that finds themselves in this situation should report the killer immediately.  Making up arbitrary solutions is just supporting this sort of behaviour.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm a psycho because you‚Äôre probably used to being able to give attitude to whoever you want on reddit and I‚Äôm not about to sit here and let you be rude to me. If I‚Äôm a psycho, you‚Äôre a twat. Fun circumstances, isn‚Äôt it?
---
Wow.
---
Sorry b‚Äôys this mainlander must of gotten bit by a goose or something foul creatures they are I can tell you now Newfoundlander are some of the nicest people in Canada thoe that‚Äôs not saying much
---
Im going to say it for a third time then, this time explaining it so even *you* will understand. A, B, C all represent traps, T represents killer.   
---
AB  
---
TC
---
Step 1: Person 1 attempts to disable trap C  
---
Step 2: Trapper hits person A  
---
Step 3: Person A runs into trap A  
---
Step 4: Person B runs through the now clear path while Trapper is in hit stun  
---
OR  
---
Step 1: Person C disables trap A  
---
Step 2: Leave
---
Something about this is just really smooth.
---
Last Minute Hero is literally impossible unless you message the killer beforehand. Some of these are just ridiculously difficult
---
I don't actually do it but it's frustrating playing through a game where you're outplaying them but they still "beat" you.
---
I‚Äôm on PC and I just messaged the random people and told them I had a challenge to do and if they could the chests alone. I also told them they could take whatever was inside the chests once it was open. So there‚Äôs that.
---
I can see what you‚Äôre saying and I respectfully disagree. If the killer isn‚Äôt camping then the 3rd hook will kill themselves and then the final survivor has to wait for the hatch to spawn , whereas the killer (as soon as the hooked surviver dc‚Äôs) can zoom around the map and find the final surviver. BUT if the killer isn‚Äôt camping both the killer and surviver are on even playing fields where the surviver can rescue or find hatch while the hooked surviver struggles.
---
I don't want to use it, but if I have, I will use it but only with a killer that isn't very OP, like wraith
---
I‚Äôm going to break it down for you since I‚Äôve explained it to you, alone, 5 times 
---
Body blocking basement so we couldn‚Äôt leave.
---
Didn‚Äôt try to hit us, stood there so we were unable to make any move without 
---
A) being hit
---
B) being trapped
---
C) being hit and immediately trapped
---
There was no work around. I‚Äôm sorry you have trouble visualizing what is explained to you. Maybe go back to elementary school where they teach you how to comprehend what you read.
---
*oh fuck help*
---
You lose your points and 3 pips for leaving a match because it fucks with the killer and their rank/perks if you leave early.
---
Unbreakable lets you recover fully once a match, slugging is a strat killers use and can even rely on in some matches hence why you can't fully recover even if last alive.
---
If the killer disconnects and you have 30k points, the killer isn't disconnecting I don't think. I could be wrong but I believe if the killer disconnects you keep whatever item you're holding and points you've earned.
---
People leaving is unfortunate and penalizing to you, but it's not an every game thing. It used to be much worse. If it removed generators because people left mid match it would be super easy to abuse as well by SWF groups so it isn't happening.
---
The killer sees generators and survivors don't because the killer is 1 v 4, it's really easy to find generators as a survivor even without perks helping you do so.
---
Being body blocked by teammates sucks, but most games it doesn't happen at least not intentionally and considering you can body block killers it makes sense at least.
---
Most killers are seen as weak. Only OP killers are really Spirit and Nurse where the game mostly comes down to their skill level as opposed to the survivor skill level. Every killer is viable and usable, just some are better then others. Leatherface for example is seen as one of the weakest killers and can absolutely struggle when played against well, he's not at all OP not even close.
---
It is almost 2020 you're correct.
---
Why would he have to hit anyone eventually. Instead of going afk for 5 hours?
---
Or it‚Äôs going to piss people off (me) and then they‚Äôll (again me) will stop playing the game for a while.
---
If you don't want to feel dirty, use it on low tier killers like Wraith so you don't feel very dirty
---
Same. I love salt. It's the reason I never report for hate mail or harassment, no matter what people say.
---
I mained Bill for awhile for this reason too! Only reason I stopped was because killers kept on predicting I had unbreakable equipped.
---
Cool one!
---
These seem...wholly unreasonable.
---
They'd br fine if there wasnt that "single trial" stipulation.
---
worth it!
---
Lmao yeah
---
Imagine being at 1800+ and still getting angry when a killer wins.
---
Just say: "GG, was a fun game, enjoy your day" and move on.
---
It's not that hard to be a decent human being
---
Lmao *yeah*
---
Oh that's cool!
---
Welp I'm unlucky, i bought leatherface recently :D
---
It usually depends on the build you use, since some killers can be extremely powerful with specific builds while they might fall behind with just meta perks
---
Gotta admit tho that took some MAJOR skill on Trapper's part
---
Insta heal we you freaking freak
---
No hes not that good, hes really glitchy right now so its hard to break him out of stealth but hes nowhere near the top 5
---
Yup too true
---
It's optional

You can get past the limit using the event hooks and doing the event gens

The fix for this is likely easy, too. They've already implemented a similar solution with Basements. In certain tight hall-like areas, they temporarily change the collision boxes of killers and survivors if they collide for a moment so survivors can get past without being held hostage in the basement the same way. 
---
I hope they see this and decide to implement that solution here!
---
Sure as hell doesn't feel like it lol

My experience has been the opposite so far. I switched over to PC from PS4 a couple days ago and the killer queues are long af.
---
Yeah there is. Just open the gate
---
Finally, socks! She needed them 10/10 buff
---
The ENTIRE game is balanced right now around this stupid perk. The devs need to make a lot of changes to their game cause it's a joke right now.  All suggestions in this post are better than the current ruin.
---
Hope you didn't cosplay the leg hair too
---
Yea once endgame has started, the killer would never willingly leave the hook. And even if you saved one person with borrowed, you would be the new target and probably be next on the hook
---
Petition to change the killers names to these
---
Outplayed.
---
Plus theres the chance of you being dead on hook by then as well
---
I'm not trying to spend 30 minutes in a match because toxic survivors don't feel like playing the game. If your not actively trying to complete the gens then you can fuck off.
---
Exactly
---

If you don't like the game, what are you still doing here? No one is forcing you to play the game other than yourself. Find another game to play.
---
SAFELY. Presumably, not resulting in a hit for a set cooldown period.
---
There planting more trees. Even killers look after the environment.

---
This id Dead by Daylight, those are clrealy salt flavoured.
---
Ah yes. Halloween 2017, when I joined this wonderful game. Good times.
---
I think I‚Äôm ok with this because Nurse, when going somewhere specific like a generator, can always travel in a straight line to her destination. Other killers still need to maneuver through debris, jungle gyms, go up stairs, find stairs, etc which add to their travel time.  Nurse bypasses all that completely.
---
The Entity is all about that false hope!
---
Real nice escape. Lucky, but nice none the less. XD
---
1. "Tunneling" is sometimes the best move for a killer
---
2. "Falling for" Decesive Strike is not something killers have the option to do consciously. It's really out of their control for the most part.
---
3. You are mad

Judith's Tombstone
---
Time to DC to rank 20 so I can have a reasonable chance of doing these challenges :)
---
I miss last year's one
---
I want my giant pustula back
---
Take three hits just so that the killer can see you across the map and you can take 1 extra hit? Insane
---
Ironically, considering Scream is my least favorite major slasher franchise, it's been Ghostface of late. However, I also love Pig, Ze Gud Docta, Trapper, Wraith, and my boi Fredward
---
Nah, he stills get looped pretty badly. The only thing he has going for him is no red glow, so it's hard to tell if he doubles back. Not only that but spine chill (super underrated BTW) hard counters him into Oblivion.
---
I think the one time I did it I managed to get all 4 but that was completely luck-based. I very much doubt I will ever get the chance to do it again lol
---
I literally just watched Bahroo block someone in the boxes by the water tower, stalk them to tier 3, and then down them.
---
I hate when people try to make games seem like they have to recreate horror movies or real life. Fucking stupid.
---
I've already practically thrown matches for some of the ones just to get them done (I did a lot of running around for totems) so these ones feel egregious...
---
I burned a purple coin and used pharmacy and open handed to boost the aura for the challenge that‚Äôs out now. Theoretically that should produce 5 chests so if you just run around doing chests first you could probably do it.
---
God ur stupid.
---
Let them burn
---
Someone doesn't know to put /s cause it's impossible to discern through text if someone is being sarcastic or not.
---
Calling lasagne noodles has ruined my day.
---
Not happening to me, but it is to a lot of people. I'll see a teammate running/doing a gen and DC at the time.
---
lmao would buy the head tbh
---
Someone doesn't know how jokes work
---
not funny at all
---
Do you mind telling me what those offering are/what they do? I‚Äôve only seen the orange ones once and didn‚Äôt have time to read them.
---
Some doesn't know that, that's why you put /s
---
why do you feel the need to message someone hate in the first place? move on to the next round or do your fucking laundry. you ppl have no lives
---
&gt; I‚Äôm not searching every nook and cranny of a map because some people want to be toxic.
---
Then thats a you problem. If you have a way of making the game end but don't use it then it's down to you being at fault, not them.
---
Yes by making it to where they can't even play! G E N I U S

Man-Children in a nutshell.
---
One of the two overpowered add ons that can ruin the game for the survivors
---
*please dont downvote me*
---
Glad to see you back again. :)
---
The budget is spent trying to mass produce cosmetics and brainstorming more ideas to monetize the playerbase.
---
I had a teammate call me garbage because he wanted me to heal him at hook vs. Freddy with BBQ and a gen right next to us. When Freddy came out the gen I ran, he didn't, he got killed, I escaped. Then proceeded to bitch about me not committing when i'm also dead on hook. Very fine salt.
---
&lt;33
---
Post continued:
---
I swear lauries p3 head and normal shirt used to blend better than this??
---
We won't, worry not. It does ruin a game. Permanent tier 3 as well.
---
Mike the builder
---
It's not overpowered. There's a fair chance survivors will blow through all the gens before you get the chance to reach T3, and if you aren't running it with the other ultra rare (that gives infinite T3), you have to get it two, maybe three times in order to kill them all. I wouldn't even consider it a good add-on, especially against survivors who have the brain to break LOS and such.
---
Bruh pig has a perk that rewards and encourges you to not tunnel
---
"It's in the game so it's okay" doesn't really work as an argument. There have been multiple "features" like this in the game that have been patched out.
---
The doctor must have a new perk which allows him to stalk players in other trails. 
---
This was quite entertaining to watch

---
Technically no, since there are two other survivors that are outside of the trap. They can open the gate and the collapse will end the game.
---
Down one and hook them then close the hatch in front of the other guy. Fuck em.
---
I see what you mean but as a solo survivor player (*most of the time*) teamates feeding him power then running to me on a gen, getting me insta killed
---
Same. Recently got seriously pissed about playing Spirit because the survivors were too good (Ranking system at its finest as usual), swapped to survivor and enjoyed myself for a few more games.
---
Happening to me 1/3 games. It‚Äôs not servers (because i‚Äôm on ps4) it‚Äôs devs doing PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR.
---
You‚Äôre on a meme trying to argue semantics, how is *he* the mad one

[Survivor Master Challenge - Plunder King](https://i.imgur.com/Bkaiyss.jpg)
---
as someone who plays both sides, i can confidently say that everyone hates each other in this game and there will be no resolution for it
---
Just go to the gate and wait until the very last possible second to leave. Fuck the other dude lol
---
Better than playing Wraith.
---
Well, its griefing then, doesnt feel like that is a way to play the game.
---
False and true. The myers mains have started defending their killer that it is my opinion that they are overpowered because i play with friends who don't know how to hide/win a chase. Or i solo and i get dumb teamates
---
It‚Äôs happened to a few, noticed it on my P3 Nancy as well, the blood cuts off around the neck and doesn‚Äôt go well with her other cosmetics.
---
I think it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect the killer to find 4 survivors who are fully immersed and not touching gens. As long as they move often enough the avoid crows, the game could take an insane amount of time if you don‚Äôt have whispers. Maybe hours.
---
Witch hunting is basically pointing the finger at someone and getting people to harass them. It's WAY easier for big streamers to do since their followers will just follow with whatever they say (This guy's a streamer, go into their chat and harass/mass report them!) but people used to do it on reddit. There's even a rule against it now, which is why you need to remove names if you're showing someone being a dickhead.
---
I mean, I think more or less he meant that survivors would feel bad for their team mates if they left but like if survs are being toxic, then there isn't much of a reason to stay in the game. Personally, I just think the only thing you lose from DCing is more of a "if things don't go my way then I'll just give up until they do" attitude, which isn't good for anyone to develop. Also, I mean obviously if you DC whenever a game doesn't go your way then you won't get better.
---
Becuase its the perk -_-
---
If it should work on teir 1 myers it should work on
---
Invisible wraith
---
Nightshroud ghostface
---
Crouching pig
---
PS4 there's a lot more SWFs iirc?
---
I only get good load times for both at a very specific time at night, and by that time I'm going to bed anyway. Otherwise killers take five or ten minutes and survivors are instant.
---
who runs without looking back? normi REEEEEEEE
---
I dont play survivor a whole lot, is Hunch actually good/worth picking up now? I don't have Tapp
---
There‚Äôs no way even BHVR expects you to do 4 gens in one match. Since dark sense now activates when any gen is done it makes sense that 4 gens just have to go off... at least i hope
---
Funny how the Myers main says the nerf is uneeded!! Just kidding i think they should change it back, and do the same for other stealth killers
---
She's so easy to use though, she has self-care.
---
Feng with a fang.
---
It‚Äôs honestly just one big circle of a fucked up toxic cogwheel tbh. It‚Äôs just so tiring when you go in there with already low expectations and come out not enjoying it. It‚Äôs costs nothing to be nice
---
 for inpatient/time-strapped people
---
Holy shit the comments in this thread are some of the worst I've seen on here. THIS is the community we have?
---
I have no idea what this all is about, but I'm pretty sure this doesn't make playing survivor any more fun for me to bother.
---
How on earth does that make me toxic, I wonder?
---
Same, I really liked how Pig looked without it, now it just adds too much imo.
---
its not fun in the slightest to play vs SWF at high ranks and people play games to have fun.
---
And Its really not fun if you don't play one of the chosen killers.
---
&gt; I had full intention to win the game 
---
How? If you're not putting survivors on hooks/mori them, then how will you win?
---
Essentially, both sides are holding the game hostage in this case, similar to hatch standoffs. If you have unlimited free time, and not bored out of your mind patrolling gens and doing nothing else, good for you.
---
Can't wait for bans ^^ hopefully servers are coming soon enough to see people like you getting banned constantly
---
Do you have to complete every challenge or just make a path to the other end?
---
It's against the EULA. So no, it's not fair
---
Big facts. I can crank 90s and cone retake in Fortnite but I spent like 2 hours in Tutorial trying to figure out 360s and moonwalking it's so clunky.
---
It should. Everyone complaining on both sides could actually enjoy the game for once then. Playing the game and just leaving. Such a concept lol
---
You can just make a path to the end to get the charm. But all the master challenges give you pieces of lore.
---
They should just shorten the banister on the left so you can hop off in front of him
---
Remember the old "make survivors search for parts". It's here, search for the switch LOL
---
&gt;No one really uses her crouch
---
Bitch please
---
OSHA approved
---
It's the dog shit FOV. It's legitimately like 60.
---
&gt; maybe this game isn't for OP 
---
Not only this game. Every PvP game, it looks like.
---
The others are right, its one of his two 'Tombstone' addons.
---
When Mike is taking a really long time to tier up you should immediately expect at least one of three things.
---
1: Tombstone, hes planning to instant kill someone, get near some vaults or lockers if he is trying to get close.
---
2: infinite tier 3, he'll likely pop this at a distance because hes not worried about it running out. 
---
3: mirror addons.  There was probably a Lerys or underground facility offering.  
---
I highly recommend against t-bagging him at the gate or hatch just in case its the first one.
---
If it's meant to be finished in one trial, the progress is restarted so you have to work for it again in the next trial.
---
The difference is, fortnite is f2p at least
---
And you don't have to pay to have decent perks, unlike DbD.
---
Like, imagine to be able to use a specific weapon you have to pay 5-10 bucks
---
"Killer IS easy unless you're against really good survivors." No shit, just like in every game ever, if you have really good opponents you are going to struggle, isn't that obvious? And that also applies to survivors, idk why do you think that survivor is "bullshit difficult", you didn't gave any arguments for that. Maybe you just need to get good.

---
Don't keys require someone to die first tho?
---
I'll do it with immeasurable pleasure, but no hooks. Only tombstone.
---
YEAH ! WHO CARES ?
---
/s
---
It'll show survivor mains how toxic they are and maybe they'll stop
---
&gt; Ez fix, up the number of required actions to activate it, but include, grasp saves, healed from down state, gen completions and safe hooks.
---
&gt; Ex: 5 tokens to activate metal of man, But if you heal someone from the downed state, unhook two survivors safely, take a protection hit and finish a generator, you have it activated.
---
&gt; tweeks would be neccisary, but thats what I think.
---
The problem with MoM is Endurance (too strong), not how hard or easy it is to make it active. Devs made it insanely counter productive to activate because they couldn't simply delete the perk until they find a new effect to rework it.
---
Imagine getting ran around for 5 gens by a No-Mither Dwight. That's actually uninstall worthy
---
What rank do you usually play on, just out of curiosity?
---
Any tips on how to escape as Claudette?
---
 Mine is working fine
---
Yeah, too bad that most of perks are already behind a paywall
---
Imagine if, for example, to use a specific weapon or make a specific construction you have to pay 5-10 bucks, plus core game and think if wasn't enough, they made a battle pass to get even more money from cash cows
---
Yeah it‚Äôs happened to me quite a few times as well, but the bonus only ever seems to not work when I have four tokens stacked, oddly enough. 
---
Anything less than four stacks gives me the post-game bonus, but yeah, four stacks at this point might as just well be an empty perk slot sadly. I sent a support ticket in about this a while ago, maybe do the same? If enough people point it out to the Devs then maybe they‚Äôll get around to fixing it sooner rather than later.
---
In his defense it was preschool lol that map is painful
---
They go on hooks or on your survivor‚Äôs belt. You can equip them in the customization menu
---
There was no official announcement about bloodhunt.
---
Link?
---
I mean it's the same as escaping any other time. But if you're really having trouble just bring a key.
---
Ds player pressed skillcheck: whoah dude this is insane! PepeGA
---
They should be nerfed too. Especially Moris. I‚Äôm not a killer main dude. I actually main survivor.
---
The thing you have to understand is that there‚Äôs a difference between a good addon and a broken addon. Insta-heals were broken, and desperately needed a nerf
---
You can run inner strengh if you REALLY need to be healed at all times for some reason
---
Idk where you came up with that, but I buy it. I mean I used to be in OP's shoes and DCed whenever I got anything shit. SWF, certain maps, the whole shabang. But then I looked at it and thought "it's a game if I get mad I can just get up and go do something else until I feel like playing again. " Unless well... Someone is forcing OP to play the game at gunpoint then I feel bad for OP. I mean hell my last 3 games sucked ass but in the end I at least black pipped cause I stuck through them.
---
Ngl I'm gonna be DMing players asking either for help or if they want help so much in the next few days or weeks. Jesus Christ.
---
Hilarious
---
Nea personally.
---
Not really for the perks as much as I just like her punk/grunge cosmetics and shit.
---
Though her perks are also a bonus. Especially if you‚Äôre just learning.
---
Yeah, if it wasn't all in one match it'd be far easier.
---
At least Borrowed Time works. They just have to not be DOWNED.
---
That looks like enough to buy a medkit!
---
This is the right answer.
---
What is BPS?
---
Damn steve has a text neck
---
Damn, I haven't escaped once ever since I reached survivor rank 13 haha
---
The devs literally said
---
"All the gameplay changes, the bug fixes, the event and the bloodhunt are still active!"
---
How is it not confirmed
---
Right, with the addition of Undetectable to stealth killers, does it mean that your aura will not been shown by Rancor? So if I'm in Nightshroud as GF or crouched as Amanda, my aura won't show when a gen is complete by the survivors still will?
---
Or does it still operate normally? Just curious
---
F all the haters!!! üî™üî™üî™
---
Alright so where's the bloodhunt
---
They could just remove a piece of the handrail to fix this. I have had it happen to me twice. Both times it was a LeatherFace though.
---
How long did you do Jack shit for?
---
&gt; This is called holding the game hostage. 
---
not it isnt, survivors can escape the game and EGC will kill the other 2. It is really scummy but most people here dont know the difference lol.
---
Now body blocking 4 people down in the basement with EGC not activated for example is holding the game hostage
---
If you get to 70 for free, then buy it you get 1000 auric cells. Rinse and repeat
---
no he isnt.........
---
there's always sibling rivalries in families.
---
Okay but either way, she set up to teleport back so her intent was to come back immediately when someone went to save.
---
I mean idk if you'd count this, but when I'm playing PvP games with friends and just fucking around I tend to never get mad, just bored after a bit. But assuming that's not what you're talking about then that's a fair assumption. Idk though, it could be game specific tilt because like when I play DBD and get a shit game I get pretty mad but when I play Apex and get a shit game I don't care. (Probably cause I'm absolute shit at Apex though)
---
All day everyday, you know it üëè
---
No homo, but me too
---
People should fear you as a doctor for being a variable but efficient sadist of a killer, not an asshole. This guy is obviously the latter
---
But her power causes her to exit the physical plane? It makes zero sense as to why she can bump into players
---
That would make it too strong. Just widen the staircase so blocking can't occur
---
rip grind :(
---
Thanks! Theres other things that I plan to adjust/redo with it to improve the quality/authenticity over time as I continue to learn more, thanks so much üíô
---
Have you seen the new med kits? I can't even get back to hook by the time people have SELF CARED back to full.
---
Where do you send the videos???  Got two survivors working with killer yesterday all on video. PS4.
---
He knew i was in the area and i couldn't go help without being seen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I wonder if this is your life's motto? If it seems that you almost never have fun with this game, stop playing the game. Maybe try some Stardew Valley or something similar?
---
I mean REAL tunneling goes a step further. Had a game yesterday where a Spirit was HARD tunneling a Kate, so much that at one point I purposefully tanked a hit for her. Kate had TONS of distance since I bodyblocked for a good 4 seconds before she eventually hit me, and then she ignored me (injured) and went after the Kate instead (also injured but WAY further away).
---
Like, it's just REALLY unfun for all 4 survivors (frustrating for the one getting tunneled, the other 3 play M1 simulator) and is a really inefficient way to play to boot.
---
Nothing in dbd makes sense anymore
---
Any chests will do, bring a coin to help
---
My point is instas required no skill and we‚Äôre complete bullshit for any killer that wasn‚Äôt nurse. So happy they got gutted now I hope they target keys
---
Her whole POWER rewards + encourages you not to tunnel, but that doesn't stop some people. Like if someone's trapped, you know they're preoccupied, it's better to chase someone else + occupy 2 people.
---
Yeah didn't think of that lol. Thanks for the response
---
Yep. Thats how i play her
---
It does. 100% of 0 is still 0
---
"Decisive strike is out of the killer's control".
---
I mean, just don't tunnel, maybe?
---
&gt; Yeah, too bad that most of perks are already behind a paywall
---
&gt; Imagine if, for example in fortnite, to use a specific weapon or make a specific construction you have to pay 5-10 bucks, plus core game and think if wasn't enough, they made a battle pass to get even more money from cash cows
---
&gt; The difference is, at least that is f2p, DbD isn't
---
As long as Shrine exists, you can't say perks are behind a paywall. You pay to get them immediately but that doesn't mean its the only way to get. If anything, considering the amount of perks we have currently Shrine could use some love with a few changes but thats it. 
---
Rocket League is also paid, has countless DLCs, loot boxes and a Battle Pass. Your point?
---
It‚Äôs still a problem considering that is such a cheap exploit, and using exploits is a bannable offense.
---
I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve seen anyone say anything about nerfing keys, at least no more than before.
---
It's a strategy, just a terrible one.
---
Ok, can we not talk about special cases? I am talking about team of survivors, not one of them. Taking into consideration not tunneling not camping killer, survivors have much more room to make mistakes than killer and if killer kills only one person that he camped then you should feel like your team won (of course it won't be represented in points and rank, but i can't count how many times i 4k'd and didn't rank up because i did it too fast). And don't act like every match you get killer camps anf tunnels, because that rarely happens.
---
Pretty sure borrowed time is next
---
Did you get out ?
---
Too many killers, not enough survivors
---
I fuck up ghostface pretty great tbh.  The trick is look around and listen for the reveal noise intently.  Ghostface isn't close to spirit imo, the only op killer
---
They don‚Äôt do that.
---
Thank you redditors for showing me the errors in my way, I shall no longer complain about things without thinking about it first. I have been set free.... So hex ruin is bullshit petition to remove it?
---
Same thing has been happening to me since the update.  It's beyond lag, it's been straight up teleporting since the update. Got unhooked on a hill, took a step &amp; was instantly teleported about 20 meters away.
---
The only killers better than ghostface at base are billy, nurse, spirit, and possibly hag. He‚Äôs most certainly top 5.
---
Don't, he is a whiny bitch.  Every survivor hit he takes is omfg so cheap and every killer game he goes in op.  Watch zubatlel at least he's ok with it both ways.
---
Moonwalking is obviously unnecessary as survivor. 360s can be useful, but more often than not you don't wanna be doing them, you wanna be getting to pallets.
---
Insta heal?
---
Huntress &gt; GF. I can fuck up a gf in loops all day.
---
I have the same problem, Nausea after a few loops.
---
Isn't that one figure-8 room an infinite with balanced?

---
Also don't Kobe and skip struggle phase.  Or sit by a tree bc killer will see u like another op.
---
I have an idea, perhaps an add on could make him looked like an injured survivor and make him wail loudly so other survivors run to heal him only to be tricked and killed. A combination of fake injuries and perks such as thanatophobia could work very well to trick them.
---
Last year's was nuts, there was a secondary objective people had to do which had nothing to do with generators so killers either had to be nice or they pubstomped everyone. It was amazing..

Ghoulnose

What if he has the last survivors up there?
---
I agree
---
I've reported and they never let me know what come of it :\  
---
'We'll now begin investigating for you. We won't be able to stay in contact with you, but rest assured relevant action will be taken if it is required.'
---
Pathetic, but it doesn't surprise me. Killers want to be able to camp hooks without penalty, and devs allow it.
---
It's mostly for balance reasons but yeah it's almost like the killer has horse blinds on
---
It‚Äôs their first time and the first one ever. It happened for PUBG/FortNite/CoD/Apex, but they‚Äôve pretty much been consistently better over time. You gotta start somewhere and work off the community.
---
Because then the killer mains would whine and leave the game. Have to appease these babies above all else apparently.
---
It's OP with No Mither tho

Best used as leatherface, i pump these tips out as often as i can but im yet to make a guide or anything, but as leatherface if you down people you need to leave them on the ground a few seconds because of LF lack of map pressure.
---
So when bubba boi if you down someone walk off and stomp a gen or m1 someone quickly, try counting to 10 otherwise they can heal them up off the ground, what this accomplishes is if you return to your downed surv and no one has revived them yet, just hook em, but sometimes they go for the rex and you will see them or see scratch marks and can get an m1 or chainsaw and start a steamroll.
---
Heres the thing though, guarantee if you down someone and walk off, they will crawl under a pallet and a nearby surv will lay in wait to get the slam, so do what i did in the vid and walk up to the body and fake the pickup, they will come sprinting right into your lap to get the slam, when you see them, at the last moment step forward and now they cant drop the pallet because body block, also they are now at point blank range of a leatherface, so you get the saw, then you just hook the inital surv because their heal timer is more progressed and come back for the other one.

I feel like they do it that way because thwy think the majority of people dont want to be 2 minutes listening to an audio or they rather read it...if thats the case, They can still make the audio with the proper pauses at least for the people who wants to hear it
---
Same as demo being an inferior billy clone
---
I don't dodge anything when I play killer. I just congratulate you on outplaying me via communication.

---
Running around a giant map finding jigsaw boxes whilst doing geny's that activate it is non canon as fuck too but it is called taking a concept and balancing it for gameplay.
---
I was actually joking about borrowed time lol it's actually an anti camping perk so i hope it gets buffed via changing it from Terror radius to distance from killer as freddy can pretty much hard camp for kills which sucks ass, I like to save my randoms
---
Even more painful to watch. I saw a david king doing that while the last gen (that he was wprking on) was on 90% and he was running adrenaline, rank 1 player as well
---
Dude I know. It takes like 3-5 minutes to find a lobby as survivor. As killer it takes like 20 seconds
---
i‚Äôd say near 50% of the lvl 4 challenges are impossible, not even exaggerating.
---
Who invited Jason? Nea please escort him out
---
Most of the later Tome challenges desperately need changing so that they can be completed in multiple matches.
---
Like others have said, it changed again when the update came out. I was looking forward to getting Dance with Me when I got home from work, only to find out it had changed. Life's hard man.
---
Oooh, some do look very tough!  Will have to just keep trying because a lot are affected by what other survs do, like the 4 chests or 4 gens...  
---
Easy peasy with friends, but I play solo on ps4 :\  
---
Should it really be like this?  Solo- it could take lots and lots of games to do.  Friends- could just take 1.
---
Hahaha xD good one

You need 3000 if you want a shitty toolbox so you better keep baking
---
&gt;Sweden is just code name so really nothing was leaked
---
Some things got leaked. We know he is related to a new status effect "crazy" and he has to charge his power. Not much but it is something.
---
Unfortunately you're not wrong. But it felt nice throwing it out there after so many matches I had today people just DC because they get caught. 
---
I've known toddlers with a better attitude than some of the survivors I run across.
---
That‚Äôs probably because they restrained the Holliday by making it the blight. While it made the event better and have us nice skins, they can never really make dbd look the same as it did in 2017, as it‚Äôll always be tied to the hallowed.
---
"Not much. Chillin, killin."
---
Yeah I hate to be that guy but insidious basement bubba seems the way to go for hooking 5 in the basement and killing all 4 in there
---
Well How elses, I went after them of course. That doesn't mean I would run after obvious bait to the other side of the map. In that case, I might as well just stand still and let them finish gens, no?
---
Firstly, dumb is not synonymous with uniformed, particularly about news affecting a minority of the playerbase, Secondly, dumb is thinking we care, you‚Äôre complaining about a problem that has been solved by the developer, and is simply in the process of being rolled out to other platforms.
---
Don't you need to claim your rewards from your completed survivor challenge on the right?
---
Well if I could read over the humongous watermark maybe I could see that.
---
Agree, they were asdholes but he only went to tunnel.  Why do I go to help?   Clearly swf is only what they tell themselves
---
Steve for the looks and Feng for the perks
---
My issues with the idea:
---
\-**Blood of the prey** \- by the way it's worded, once you down 3 survivors, everyone bleeds out 60% faster for the rest of the game. I don't think that's how it should work.
---
\-125% speed feels like a bit too much
---
\-**Hex: Cursed Blood** sounds like worse Tinkerer
---
\-Weapon sounds very similar to what Freddy or Demogorgon have, and if the model's too small, people will complain about hitboxes. I'd make it similar to what Spirit has. Make his nails quite short, but glowing bright red and once you lunge, they would grow in size for the animation of the attack
---
Screenshoot or it didnt happen
---
Oh thank god, thank you
---
I remember why i stopped playing the game; this community is toxic af
---
Feels like a giant troll by the devs part or they might've just done an oopsie and confirmed Pennywise. Either one wouldnt surprise me anymore
---
You can only have 1 challenge active at a time and it looks like a survivor challenge is currently chosen. I literally just did the challenge you are showing and it worked fine for me. When you hover over the archives while you are in a pre game lobby (killer or survivor it will say either select challenge or it will display the current challenge you have picked. Hope this helps!
---
They said graphics update, not engine. Really the big thing I'd like them to bring back is the original fog and lighting. Those helped hide the lower quality of the models and textures and added a nice atmosphere that's missing now IMO.
---
Killers are way more toxic when they don‚Äôt kill everyone when you are high tiered
---
He tunneled to mindgame the survivors smh
---
Looks like a killer that either finds the obsession or sucks blood until they can turn into a bat to find obsession. Then slugs them, then slugs everyone else and leaves them all to die.
---
Oh right, I wasn't aware it had changed and read the title of  the post.
---
&gt;Well if I could read over the humongous watermark maybe I could see that.
---
I can read it just fine. Weird.
---
I remember playing huntress because I need to hit 4 survivor(s) with hatchets and chase survivor(s) for 180 seconds and some guy called my a baby killer cuz I'm a survivor main.
---
There's also that deadend on the first story porch.
---
You can only pick one challenge at a time complete the one you have active or claim the rewards before selecting another.
---
This is too accurate
---
Looks like it‚Äôs bugged. You can only have one selected at a time however it should be light in colour like the 2 Survivor challenges as it‚Äôs the next one along, however it‚Äôs dark like it‚Äôs blocked from being selected. Have you tried closing and restarting the game?
---
We NEED more positive memes! Keep it coming. &lt;3
---
Okay I'm a bit less enthusiastic now xD
---
when i play killer i only stay at the hook so that cant get off. big brain

as long as the hatch is here, you can open it

I guess I won‚Äôt be doing any of them ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Unironically want it. Late 2017, early 2018 was the best apart from a few aspects.

Do you 100% have the premium pass? That's the only way you can get auric cells from the rift

Honestly more players SHOULD play both sides, at least for awhile. You get into the mind of your opponent so much easier if you have the experience of playing their side, AND personally, you might find you prefer that side you refused to play just like I did :)
---
That‚Äôs I‚Äôm getting me p3 rank 1 huntress
---
I'm not sure if struggle phase is "local" or if it could be affected by latency - u/McLean_BHVR could tell you for sure.
---
Eh, like half the maps in the game really need a rework. Thompson's house is definitely up there though.
---
i think there are people who plays
---
As far as I know, you don't HAVE to play both sides. Sure, you'll lose some rewards but you can progress through the battle pass without completing those challenges (But of course it would be a lot harder!)
---
Do Freddy mains tunnel? Honest question. I don't see a lot of videos involving Freddy tunneling.  I bounce between Freddy and Myers. When I use Freddy I hook and Gen port usually to the other end of the map. When I play Myers it's harder to get distance from the hook cause USUALLY one of the survivors farms the poor guy on the hook lol. In that case I leave the saved survivor alone and hunt the hero lol.
---
The alchemist im calling it right now
---
Actually having looked at the paths you CAN do it by only one of the two but it's a bit tricky

Can't tell if these are legit questions or just whining.

I just finished playing a game as nurse and got over 32000 bloodpoints. Is the cap removed?

When they had the placeholder legion model while trying to figure out his power he was called kenya, or the map was anyways so I don't know if "Sweden" means anything
---
Had this same thing happen to me with a wraith, he was a good sport about it though so I didn't report him
---
Yes to restarting the game, and I have also verified my game files on steam. When I completed the challenge before it, it said an error occurred. I think I'm going to go ahead and say its bugged currently. I guess I will have the get to it from the ones behind it lol.
---
 I‚Äôm actually dying
---
I claimed the rewards of the one before it, though it doesnt give me the option to select the next killer challenge. I understand I can only have 1 picked at a time.
---
It also turns a regural hook into a haloween hook for each offering. The killer gets bonus bloodpoints the first time they hook a survivor on each of these hooks
---
Nah, he‚Äôs good, he just needs to slow down a bit imo
---
It‚Äôs an event so you can earn more blood points per match. I think... maybe... yeah...
---
No you fake the pickup, survivors see a killer walk straight up to a downed survivor and its clear they will pick them up and hook them, so when you suspect someone else is close by you tempt them with a save by pretending to pick the survivor up, they take the bait and run out directly into your lap.
---
That works too.
---
It's actually pretty damn easy in rank 20 new killer games. The difficulty curves up noticeably sooner than it does for survivor (around rank 12ish). With that extra challenge comes the reward though, cause killer games can feel sooooo good.
---
Might want to dodge 4 man SWFs until you find your feet though.
---
1) Sometimes our friends play on our accounts, in fact my girlfriend does this a lot.

They only have the rights to the first movie, this isn‚Äôt the outfit in game anyways, it‚Äôs supposed to be when he escapes Smiths Grove in H1
---
I mean, most of the time in purple red ranks everyone else is just saving each others asses while I'm usually the one who does the gens, but 4 is just too much, 3 should be maximum
---
I see thx
---
What? Misinformed? It's been spread everywhere that PC has dedicated servers. I bet even your mother knows. Anyway, you say this problem has been solved by the developer yet it still hasn't. Most of what I've seen on dedicated servers has been negative. Either lag, worse hitboxes, etc. They have been promising dedicated servers on consoles for how many years now? And we still have to wait. I mean, it was meant to be released last December, remember? But it never was. But instead it was delayed and we still don't have a confirmed release date.

Nope the alchemist is the blight dude he isnt archive only there's tons of proof for him more for him than pennywise if I'm being honest I could be wrong but I seriously think it'll be the alchemist
---
I don't find that Freddy stands out as a tunneller. (To be honest not many killers do, it is more about who is playing). But I do find with freddy, even since the rework, he is one of the least fun to play against (for me). I'm not sure why that is either..

Tier 3 isn't any faster than tier 2 which is normal killer speed

So I play both sides, but I don't think playing only one side is being toxic, if I don't like one of the roles and only prefer to play the other one, why would that make me toxic

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dpmk83/test/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I beg to differ on instant heals being broken, but no matter what, this wasn't a nerf. This was a brutal murder.
---
Doctor is standing in the only exit of that floo, trapping the two Survivors with no way to escape.
---
Basically holding those two hostage, with the other two being forced to play along or leave them to die.
---
I have a feeling that this will all change since they are all set to be done in one trial. Alot of these when the 4th level comes around will most likely be set to multiple matches.
---
Yea maybe I think the alchemist will inject himself with the serum or he'll inject survivors one of the two
---
INB4 new pig nerf, you have to restock traps from a locker. Can only carry 1 at a time.
---
If their killer is low rank, they will probably go "damn this is easy, why do people complain?" Sadly.
---
I usually have good luck playing against Freddy, Maybe cause I play him. I have the worst luck against Legion.
---
in THEORY they give more BP due to the halloween gens giving bp in a category seperate from any other ones, so if you got a 32k game with 5 hallowgens being completed it would give you more points but it's a fairly slim scenario
---
I think what he is trying to say is that killers have no free will and have to follow a fixed path of actions regardless of the circumstances. If anything obstructs this then it is not balanced.
---
Ah shit like in the video! I forgot about that one
---
So basically a doping killer lol
---
O i didnt know it was widespread like this, these devs dont know shit about programming
---
Excuse me?
---
The indoor maps are all wank. Hawkins is only mildly wank wheres the other two are downright atrocious.

Lol druggie killer confirmed?

I'm playing on xbox and am having the same issue. Hopefully they are working on the fix :/

Don't forget the god awful framerates in lobbies for console for some fucking reason.
---
Use both together for maximum profit
---
This is exactly why I will never for any reason work on that gen in that house or go anywhere near the stairs of that house. Someone else can but not me.
---
Every match for the event has a special hook and gen that give more bloodpoints for interacting with. The addon just increases the number of special gens/hooks and increases bloodpoints given by interacting with them.
---
Its nice, but honestly not better than an escape cake or BPS. Especially because you can still benefit from other people using them.

Its not "widespread", people just can't look for other threads before creating a new one about the same subject.
---
This^ 
---
I play both sides and do not consider it tunneling at all if going for the injured player was the smartest move. That's what I would do as killer and I dont blame killers for doing it.
---
It's when going after one person is clearly the wrong move (for example another injured person is much closer) and they still go out of their way to only target that one person. That is when it becomes bullshit
---
Ah well, guess i should've searched a bit more before posting...
---
Freddy is just a bit meh for me. Not that I find him difficult.. Maybe it is because there is too much going on, falling in and out of sleep constantly etc.. 
---
I used to hate legion, but more recently I just bait them into missing a hit then get away as they screw up their power.
---
struggling literally doesnt do anything at the end, it doesnt matter, if you are the last person, and you get grabbed, its over. I often give the hatch, because the hag and freddy both tend to get full up on devious points before the end, but I'm not going to spend 10 minutes doing it, so if they keep struggling and running around like a chicken with their head cut off, I'm hooking them to end the game.
---
I‚Äôd see if you can complete it by going backwards and doing the challenges at the other side first. If you can‚Äôt select it at that point i‚Äôd definitely get in touch with them.
---
Well forgive me for not scrollng thru reddit for hours tryna find a thread similar to.mine
---
As a huntress this is accurate, they all always spawn on the other side of the map, next to the ruin, 
---
and before I take 10 steps ruin is gone, while they are churning gens separately with toolboxes. 
---
By the time I get to the other side and find somebody 2 gens are done. By the time I down them 1 more gets done and by the time I hook and move to which ever gen I can stop from being done, they finish last 2 by the time I reach there.
---
Meanwhile, the only guy I manage to down is rescued and obviously has adrenaline, DS and Endurance thanks to his friend's borrowed time.
---
So I have since decided to go straight to basement and stay there without giving them any chase/altruism points so at best they get a dead pip, as I just wanna have fun and don't care about ranking.
---
Butt dance at gates all you want, I am not giving you free emblems. Enjoy your de-pip/dead pip for abusing the game.
---
Oh trust me they can. I played a match on Red Woods as Doc and had two survivors do **literally nothing** for 20 goddamn minutes. Turns out they were swapping lockers in the basement so madness wouldn‚Äôt build and so they wouldn‚Äôt get crows.
---
If I am unable to move the match forward, and they are refusing to advance the match, the game is held hostage by them.
---
Or it'll hit the fly that you can barely see and destroy the hatchet early
---
Because that's what heroes do.
---
I agree, it's a game you should be free to play the way you enjoy
---
Lol I love that argument.
---
I've had countless times where i down someone, hook them, leave. Fund someone else, down them, hook them leave.
---
Find another guy, down him, pick him up, oh it was the guy who just got unhooked 55 seconds ago? Well shit. Apparently I'm a tunneling piece of shit lol sometimes it is hard to even tell.
---
Especially if you are getting quick downs or if they are all the same damn character. Or even just not paying attention super hard. It's very easy to forgot who has been unhooked in the last 60 secs
---
You do realize that every killer runs into that shit so often that we just jokingly call it the rulebook, right?
---
Of fucking course it's not written down anywhere, the people who cite the rulebook don't have the self awareness to know they're in the wrong.
---
Roger that, thanks for your help. Appreciate ya
---
I can relate. Never forget about old Mettle of Man and old DS lol
---
Dude, it's a game, you're free to play the way you enjoy
---
If you're supposedly that good to down 3 survivors in less than a minute, then why complain about DS? You're CLEARLY way better than the survivors in that situation, and you're for sure gonna get a 4k that game, if you're downing 3 different survivors that quickly.
---
What? As a survivor I hate hatch campers worse than as killer lmao.
---
As killer it means it will end very quickly when I hook the other person. 
---
As survivor it means I either have to kill myself or play the game of who's the better sandbagger
---
What are the archives i feel well out of the loop
---
&gt;Well forgive me for not scrollng thru reddit for hours tryna find a thread similar to.mine

Get ready to solo 4 gens or hatch.
---
I see no difference in the default screen for 2019
---
Because of the play style you pair with it instead of stalking because that waist time you just use him as a zero terror Radius on demand
---
Usually they were already injured or its T3 Myers or something.
---
This isnt like every game for me I get 3 downs every minute lol just saying it's not uncommon
---
I managed to do it pretty easy, my friend and I both used purple coins, then i just asked the other survivors to let me do chests.
---
It‚Äôs still a scummy way to get kills
---
Ho your stuck in my trap unable to run instead of attempting escape your just sitting there
---
Haha. I do love the dbd community
---
so many reposts lately smh
---
Shouldn't, having a wider FOV will make it less likely to induce headaches etc.
---
It‚Äôs antialiasing and it‚Äôs used to keep hair from looking like a strange pixelated mess, but I agree it‚Äôs horrible so thankfully it can be turned off. Just go into your dead by daylight directory and look for engine.ini and insert this into the document.

Woulda been cool as hell to have one of the special infecteds as a killer.

25% of points vs 5k(+50%) for survival
---
Which was worth more?

micheal just vibin

The only thing needed there is a wider passageway, like they did with basement so killers can't block there for eternity

what else do they expect us to do lmao

Goblinhead
---
I don't think it is reportable, in that particular case. What he did is a dirty move, but it is a surefire way to kill that certain survivors since others re going to open gates, triggering EGC, which would kill trapped Kate. If the Kate was the last survivor remaining and there was no way she could leave that house, then it is reportable.
---
Survivors are holding the game hostage because they can‚Äôt escape because the killer is blocking.... now that is some serious logic
---
Not exactly sure what you are trying to say... But it can't be any faster - because from hook to the final box the survivor needs to have a chance to get it off if it has been activated.
---
Otherwise it would be RNG based to whether you die or not, based on your luck with the boxes.
---
Hm, is it because there‚Äôs more killers than survivors?
---
Thanks for the calculations, I was wondering about that myself.

Very bad Spirit player myself but here are, to my knowledge, the two most important tips.
---
**1) Play with headphones. Sound is EVERYTHING with her.**
---
2) Don't play drunk. It's easy to run certain killers drunk but she demands that you be pretty good at following scratch marks and spotting minute movement in grass or corn.
---
Other than those, it's just practice. You need to get used to the length and duration of scratch marks and how close you reappear to them based on their position and the volume of their breathing / grunts.

oh boy here we go, fire up the whine machine, lube up those tear ducts, BHVR is promoting the use of NOED we are all quite lit-er-ally doomed.
---
Everyday that I have time to play this game (PC), I search for a match as killer. It takes so long I end up playing survivor because I only have an hour or so to play.
---
That was a general buff to all stealth killers tho, I don't consider it a buff but more of a balance since their power was useless against OoO
---
Very pleased with it, I was buying the pass regardless but as a casual player, I was worried I wouldn't see the end of it.
---
Usually takes me a minute but I haven't played since the update. Guess we'll see.
---
Then rip
---
GRAPHICS DOWNGRADE, PEPEDANCE
---
Want to solve the insane difficulty problem? It‚Äôs simple.
---
DON‚ÄôT MAKE IT SO THAT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A SINGLE TRIAL.
---
The only scary thing I see are the 2 self-cares
---
no switch, I'm sad
---
was useless against OoO
---
is no longer useless against OoO
---
that means, it's not useless more often, so it's stronger, which means it was buffed
---
bait?
---
Keep looking above to avoid flashings
---
Ps4 here and I've had no problems
---
What do you mean?
---
Yeah, honestly I think it's great. They could have easily made it an 8-hour-day grindfest to milk the playerbase, but chose not to. Like I said it's honestly super achievable.
---
It‚Äôs all well and good in theory, however the only thing i‚Äôm concerned about is the level of difficulty that later challenges provide according to the leaks.
---
For example: ‚Äúsacrifice all 4 survivors in the basement in the same match‚Äù ‚Äúescape using spine chill without being hooked‚Äù ‚Äúsacrifice 3 survivors with noed during the end game collapse in the same match‚Äù ‚Äúsafely unhook 3 survivors during the end game collapse in the same match‚Äù 
---
These are only a few of them and they seem almost impossibly situational.
---
when she chases you, it‚Äôs usually a game of chance if you get caught after the first hit due to her power, so people feel powerless against her.
---
&gt;This is why I say - This game needs a nice graphics update.
---
10 FPS on consoles, 30 on PC POGGERS
---
He saved everyone but himself. 
---
I thought this was going to be one of them "make Billy into a 110% killer".. I was already ready to downvote it
---
That must have cost a fortune to add
---
From what I gathered from people in this subreddit, theu complain about her prayer beads add on and her guessing game which for whatever reason isnt considered mind games to these people. And that's about the only things I seen them complain about.
---
Absolutely not. I‚Äôm not a fan of killer cosmetics anyways, unless they‚Äôre super dark. This is just silly.
---
The Nurse and Wraith one are sick, I like the new Trapper mask too. Surv cosmetics kinda suck.
---
Good thing they took mercy.
---
Every played against a beads spirit?
---
Yeah some of these require a degree of skill, but others, like that one, are purely luck. You've got to have just the right combination of shitty teammates to leave you enough gens to complete, but also good enough teammates to keep the killers attention while you slam out the gens by yourself.
---
So people don't like her becuase she has a btec insta-down for free? I see why that could be annoying
---
&gt;The only scary thing I see are the 2 self-cares
---
Scary for their teammates, right?
---
Oh lord Ace your perks are shit but your injured state is automatic iron will
---
this literally just turns u into a powerless m1 killer are u kidding me
---
People constantly bring it up on steam forums but the devs reply with ‚Äúmajority wanted it changed to how it is now‚Äù. I just want the good ole lighting :(
---
ugh, pallet vacuum, thank fucking christ that was dealt with
---
Yeah, that is worrying.. missing even one challenge in a tome is an additional 3 hours of game time to make up the fragments (5 for the challenge and 10 for the completion bonus at about 5 fragments per hour). An additional hour is needed for each additional missed challenge. Though theoretically I think you can make up for it realistically, an extra 10 or so hours of game time over the span of *70 days* isn't super difficult if you can't do the challenges.
---
Personally me and the wife just dislike like the sounds she makes which sounds like a angry goose
---
Basement bubba intensifies
---
?
---
They literally just said yesterday that they know spirit is OP and are planning on solving that.
---
Why would they do this? So you don't accidentally walk in your own trap? To prevent trapper from blocking off a pallet and then walking through it? Couldn't you just turn 180¬∞ and then place your trap and walk backwards again?
---
While I agree that everyone should play both side, I think the ratio of challenges needs to be adjusted slightly. The challenges are close to 50:50 (though a little more survivor challenges) but in a 4v1 game shouldnt there be 4 times more survivor challenges so as not to effect lobby queue times?
---
WWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
It‚Äôs more than hard, it‚Äôs RNG.  You‚Äôll need to play dozens of matches for each of these specific situations to *potentially* happen.  Then you need to make the improbable play.  Now do that for each challenge.
---
It only makes you hit the unhooked survivor twice. It used to affect both, but it's been nerfed.
---
I feel like the petals do more for points than party streamers. Imma save BPS for the double BP events
---
Killer lobbies are instant for me
---
Just gotta say something happy that your joining the community it a wonderful but toxic places but I got to say your reactions sound.fake (even if they are real) and your voice is throwing me off since you sound like primink
---
&gt; Wow, Imagine if he hooked someone around the final gen to bait a person up for 2 free kills
---
It would be a damn shame if people are going to start doing this now because you gave them the idea.
---
Also it's not 3 downs in less than a minute. The 1 minute timer doesn't start until the 1st guy is unhooked, which could be after 30-45secs and I've already hooked the other dude
---
dbd trying to turn into a teabaggy version of deceit lol
---
Oh
---
No. I only just reached rank 11
---
Start with David, unlock were gonna live forever. Use that perk to gain bloodpoints faster for other survivors. I'd suggest that you try to get dead hard from David as well.
---
Only the third one you mentioned is that difficult. You could easily get the first two in just a few games at most if you go in with just that purpose in mind
---
Oh I get it, lol. But anyway, usernames doesn't always represents what you do, but represents your name :p
---
Lmao
---
I know everyone here read those in Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs voice in their heads.
---
Now here is my question, can these rift challenges be done in KYF, if so that just makes things so much easier.
---
4 gens is reasonable at rank 16-20
---
My Rules: D I E........ iiiiiiinnn the most fair way possible I won‚Äôt do any of that camping or tunneling bs unless very certain 
---
C I R C U M S T A N C E S occurr

Nice work! How long did it take you? If you don‚Äôt mind my asking
---
*flashbacks to watching 2 yellow auras heal on the other  side of the map while I struggle for my life*
---
Just hear 4head
---
It‚Äôd be so cool if there was an option in the settings where you could choose which music you‚Äôd like to have in your menu out of all menu music in the game. I like that they don‚Äôt force the music from the new chapters into the survivor and killer lobbies, but I‚Äôd like to be able to just have the Halloween 2017 menu music for all menus. It kinda sucks you can only hear the Hallowed Blight music when you aren‚Äôt even in a lobby
---
They probably want to see if you have adrenaline before spending time healing you
---
Biggest theory is since the Pennywise voice actor is swedish, Bill Skarsgard, then Pennywise is the newest killer. Judging by those leaks looks like he's getting new chase music too, I was hoping for Jack Torrance, like a new Madness based killer. But I'm literally fine with any killer, I'm not picky.
---
I always use headphones. But I guess you‚Äôre right
---
Try getting a hit and then use her power to follow the scratch marks and down the same survivor
---
The bitch always kills me üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm gonna need at least 1m of them chief.
---
I always get killed by micheal :(
---
You should honestly ditch urban evasion your pretty much running 3 perks rn
---
Yeah that‚Äôs generally what I try to do since they get that speed boost when hit.
---
As a killer , if there a vault it‚Äôll be a nightmare since it‚Äôll be haddon 2.0
---
Sorry this picture is sideways guys! First time posting pictures from my phone üòÇüòÖ

Yeah im finding a bunch of old clips on a recovered hard drive, good and bad memories come with seeing older footage lol.

Hot take: legion is just four kids in a trench coat. They run faster by dropping a kid and getting them later which is why they get shorter when they run.

For anyone who already has a Bill perk unlocked (before he became a dlc character) they should be able to max that perk in particular even without his teachable.
---
I met a guy who was fapping, an abusive couple and a narcissistic woman with her own personality cult in those lobbies. Fun times.
---
BHVR didn‚Äôt put up the Halloween stuff because they said they were focusing on more important additions to the game such as dedicated servers. It has nothing to do with players‚Äô complaints or behaviour.
---
Uh the biggest problem with this map is how unfair it is for killers. They need to fix that before they do something to address the occasional sore loser
---
I highly doubt, I mean yeah he has been broken for a while but every killer game I played today the I got teleported back every 1 second and very laggy attacks. It's not even my internet, I have very good internet.
---
I assume u 2 were fixing THE last generator up here? Right?
---
HAPPY HALLOWEEN AROOOOOO!
---
(Psst they know that and it‚Äôs what they want)
---
Thank you I really appreciate that! Yeah normally I don't force reactions but I was trying to focus on learning the game still so the reactions came out kind of cheesy.
---
since youre clearly brain damaged lemme try to explain, though i doubt there is much point.
---
1.  game hostage      : when the game cant progress (impossible to end) due to someone not doing an action that they can perform.
---
2.  who's fault is it?    : the person who is capable of doing something but doesn't, which as a result makes it IMPOSSIBLE for the game to reach a natural conclusion. (Note: if a person is doing nothing, but it is still possible for the game to reach a natural conclusion, then that person is not "holding the game hostage".)
---
lets leave your emotions out of this :)
---
Exhibit A : Same as the video in this post, but there are 4 people body blocked by the lovely doctor.
---
In this case the 4 survivors are trapped for all eternity due to EGC not being activated and the game can never end,and there is nothing the survivors can do. The doctor CAN move and that is the ONLY way that the game. Applying 1. and 2. we see that the doctor is the terrorist :)  (he holds the game hostage)
---
Exhibit B: The video / n&lt;total number of survivors are body blocked  (n= number of survivors trapped)
---
In this case despite the 1/2/3 survivor(s) being trapped and the doctor just body blocking, the game CAN STILL reach natural end. This is achieved by the at least 1 survivor who is not trapped. Since we assume that the doctor is basically afk, this survivor(s) can complete the remaining gens and open the exit gates, activating the EGC. This will cause all survivors to die within a guranteed 6 minutes, ending the game naturally. If they refuse to do gens, then the game will never end. Since the game can only end as a result of the survivors actions in this particular scenario, it is the survivor(s) *outside* who are holding the game hostage. Sure the doctor could just not be a dick and simply move, but we have shown that it is possible to end the game naturally despite this. Applying 1. and 2. we see that it is not the doctor but the survivor(s) outside holding the game hostage.
---
Q.E.D the survivors outside are holding the game hostage and NOT the killer, as stupidly claimed by the parent comment. 
---
Footnote: Game naturally ending = no one DC-ing, EGC= end game collapse

Nice.

Its weird man, i remember when r/gaming used to be about gaming, guess what, you cant link video files directly, ok fair enough, but now if you turn footage into a gif and upload it to r/gaming the automod removes that too! No v.reddit links or files unless they're a static image.
---
So basically "memes and circlejerks only k thanks".
---
So when i feel like throwing a short snippet up because i love when people comment and we can all talk about the game and what we like etc, i guess i go to r/gaminggifs right? No they seem to only like retro gifs over there.
---
I'd honestly just like a place where people can upload gaming gifs and chat about whats on their mind and what theyre playing and stuff.

Here's some more pictures, as well as a brief showcase of some of the work I did. A previous post I made shows the mask in better detail.

Yh but that‚Äôs when you haven‚Äôt complete a challenge, he‚Äôs finished that one.
---
No, shadowborn is always active. I think the chase one is monitor and abuse.
---
People learned how to play at her bedt potential, but saying shes OP is ridicolous, she is an ok killer without addons
---
Looking forward to the next one!
---
Not sure if that's sarcastic or not, but that's only an additional 15 minutes a day, assuming you skip the entire tome. Doesn't seem *that* bad to me.
---
A very old one,it looks like!
---
aro?
---
Me too but everyone has to find a way to get their fix of karma. I really don't get the appeal it's just internet points.
---
And let‚Äôs see how the large majority feels.... oh so sorry you are completely wrong and are very entitled
---
maybe the final day...
---
Now*
---
I apologise for fixing your Grammer
---
That‚Äôs exactly what that person wants.
---
I personally don't think she's op but that seems to be the general consensus. I think people just underestimated her when she first came out. It didn't help that she was bugged upon initial release so you could tell when she was phasing and where she was. Now that you can't she requires a much different style of play when your playing against her and some people hate that.
---
Well it clearly is your internet. You must‚Äôve been downloading if you were rubberbanding. That‚Äôs all on your internet not their servers
---
and whit the servers on  you cant even complain about the killer acting was the server ...
---
feel bad man
---
Yeah this map should be even worse for killers than it already is. Big brain you have there
---
But now if someone has OoO they know to patrol in crouch
---
He got 8k in all categories except 1 and 4kd red ranks
---
That wasn‚Äôt sarcastic at all, it actually *is* perfect which means I have days to get ahead of the rift now!
---
Why does everyone hate Joe? :(
---
Not all clips are carved from marble, some are shit, but usually still better than reposting the same circlejerk meme format or "hurr hurr trutalent bad".
---
The video was about the t bagger quickly getting their comeuppance, but yeah its nothing special. Have a good night.
---
Without parental supervision.
---
It's a known bug.
---
It better be Kate and Jane simultaneously blowing me if you think I‚Äôm doing all those challenges in time.  Let me know in advance so I can take a leave of absence from work.
---
It actually *is* perfect, since now I have days to get ahead of the rift!
---
We dont know if your so innocent, either.
---
Ok thanks everybody I will check you all out when I get home
---
It‚Äôs not that easy though. 
---
You really think Survivors won‚Äôt DC when you‚Äôre about to complete the 4 man basement challenge. 
---
Or you think a Killer isn‚Äôt going to camp a hook during endgame making it impossible for you to get 3 safe hook rescues in those 2-4 minutes. 
---
And when you down a Survivor with Noed during the EGC do you really think the other 3 are going to stay to allow you to have a chance at sacrificing them. Not only that but in order to get 3 kills during the EGC you have to purposely keep the Survivors alive until the last gen gets done in order to have a chance at it. One DC or suicide and you‚Äôre probably not doing it that match.
---
Im so suprised at the amount of people who dont do this little trick, ive done it for ages, glad i shared to be honest.
---
Might have phrased it badly, I mean that the killer will hear a heartbeat when they are working on the generator. Was thinking like tinkerer but  more "vampiry like blood and stuff.
---
Yeah actually I think you are right, had so many ideas floating around that I rushed it a bit.
---
I'll re-think it a bit. What do you think of the power?
---
I am *not* saying that any of these Legion cosplays are terrible, I  like the majority of them. This is meant to be a shitty tier list and no more.
---
I do not mean offense to any of the people who took the time to craft a Legion cosplay. a lot of them look legitimately cool.
---
It‚Äôs never been useless, just very situational.
---
Head on, inner strength, Q&amp;Q, and ds = baby survivor
---
No Add-on spirit wins just as frequently as a spirit with green add-ons. You can pull off a few less things but the only big ones are Prayer Beads and the other irri and purple add-ons because of the insane amounts of bonuses they provide.
---
Is it you? Because having your teammates abandon both you and the games objectives to hump the hatch is a trash move.
---
If you had the game already, yes, they should be competely unlocked by default. I think they only become locked for people who get teh game after he was added.
---
It does happened tho, Alex from the support Team banned a killer and survivor for working together. Alex is a pretty good and helpful.
---
There's no way someone does it in a legit way. I just can't imagine how a solo survivor could do it.
---
SWF maybe, after rank reset and waiting a couple of days to get a very bad low-rank killer.
---
But it‚Äôs less situational now. Most games I wish I brought Unbreakable with me. I just wanted to see if other people shared the same opinion
---
Yeah lol that's not my intention, will re-think these perks! Wanted something related to vampires that could be used on the other killers too.
---
Ah yes, the huntress I played against yesterday that stood just outside of heartbeat range with a hatchet raised at the hook DEFINITELY wasn't proximity camping! Or the hag a week or so ago with MYC that literally stood still and waited in range to teleport and did nothing else lmao.   
---
People use the terms wrongly or are stupid about it sometimes but people do camp like that.
---
I'm almost afraid to ask what a burger king Myers is.
---
I don't. I don't think...
---
who is Joe?
---
Was meant to be only the killer could hear it but that is a good idea actually!
---
&gt;He got 8k in all categories except 1 and 4kd red ranks
---
This is pretty common, whats the big deal?
---
Dwight: AHHHHHHHUHUHHH

your sentence is a bit mangled there bud

Completed challenges are gold my dude.

Some of the lore stuff is on killer/survivor challenges. You can get all the charms etc without one side tho

BHVR: *Just fucking turns up the Orange‚Ñ¢*

The idea is to be as fair as possible and STILL get hate messages.
---
Looks awesome!
---
Yeah, personally, I know I'll have a few weekends I can spend double-digit hours on. Might even complete the rift before tome 4 drops.
---
I didn‚Äôt want to start an argument
---
The tomes are permanent, yo. You could do one challenge a day and still get the charm eventually.
---
Dope cosplay it's really well done keep up the great work it's cool to see really well done cosplays. Don't think I'm calling it great due to the things others point out. The outfit and mask of the cosplay is well done nice job (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*.‚úß
---
It changed after the new patch. I've seen both of these shrines. Got tricked into waiting for later into the week to get a perk I wanted. And now when I can afford it.. it's gone.
---
&gt;It changed after the new patch
---
Thank you! It was a lot of fun.
---
 It changed after the new patch
---
Nea-T
---
The basement one? No, I don‚Äôt that that would happen. I play a lot of basement trapper and survivors are pretty cool about it more often than not 
---
I don‚Äôt know why you mentioned the end game collapse one because I explicitly said that‚Äôs the only difficult one. Did you even read my comment?
---
And the NOED one is also super doable. I‚Äôve seen enough killers get multiple kills in EGC with NOED on. A lot of survivors are willing to risk it if they have an otherwise good game. Don‚Äôt play like a douche the first 95 percent of the trial and make sure you go out of your way to hook every player and you can do it.
---
Maybe it wasn't meant to offend? With limited communication, what you see as teabagging might have been meant as a cheeky (pun intended) "nice, got me". I know I spam ctrl when I see fellow Survivors, after a heal, or anything notable happening if I can. It's  not (always) meant to be rude!
---
Fuck, I‚Äôve played with the last one too! Doesn‚Äôt she have a Discord full of guys who have ‚Äúorbiter,‚Äù roles and don‚Äôt give a shit
---
Its all for that small feeling of success, people say "unpopular opinion but TruTalent is kind of grumpy lately" then theybwin awards for the most popular unpopular opinion ever and they feel good, thats fine i hope they feel good, im judt doing my part to even out the content in the sub  add some videos of gameplay to balance out all the videos of someone in a Myers mask dancing to hip hop.
---
Things get popular only when it's le funny clutch moments with second chance perks and lucky rng
---
Get away from that totem you FOCKING DONKEY
---
Yeah was thinking initially that it could be a hex but I'm thinking encouraging slugging maybe a bad idea or at least a waste of what could be good perks.
---
Yeah was trying to go down a similar route to tinkerer but with a vampiric twist forgot to put at 70/60/50 % but yeah maybe just a rehash.
---
Yeah that's a good point. I'll think around that.
---
Gonna reupload this with some changes taking in feedback. I don't even work for behaviour just interested in this idea lol
---
My mom made it!
---
Oh and also, you said that the survivors were the one holding the game hostage but then defined holding the game hostage as ‚Äúbeing impossible to end‚Äù which means that the killer could just move which would mean that the survivors were not holding the game hostage. Not only are you entitled you are hypocritical
---
He made them out of the toxic players' blood
---
Instead of having "[Killer name]" in the files, to prevent leaks of killers, they put the name of a country in the files instead. It's like a variable, they put whatever name they want to have it ready when they put it in the game and then later changes it.
---
They‚Äôre not really able to say either ‚Äúwe didnt have enough time‚Äù considering the GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF COSMETICS
---
For real, no issues for me either. Just back out to the main menu and it should that. No way in hell I'd wait 30 mins for a matchüòÇ
---
6 great skill checks in a single match? I'm lucky if I hit two!
---
Me too! I feel so fucking tricked! I was 100 shards away and thought I'd get it later in the week. Literally the perk I've wanted the most for a long time
---
But then Doc can just continue camping to get the Kate and Claud killed via EGC timer.
---
Ok but why are the people who actually put effort into making a mask lower than ones who bought ones on Amazon? Cause I can see a couple of them with the exact same mask that you can find online
---
If this is legit and it's coming to the game I'm not even joking I would shit myself from how scary that shit would be if it ran at me in game
---
will they fix it and give us back our auric cells?
---
Iit was in the shrine this year already I think. Before that, literally years as you said
---
Yeah still doesn't make it funny.
---
You're not cool because you don't like something other people like. You're a sad hipster who desperately seeks validation by being "different" from other people.
---
Let people enjoy what they like. It's not harming you in any way. Being an ass about it just makes you look like an ass.
---
You guys havent got the update yet?
---
Half of these things are only possible in low ranks like how tf do I flashlight a rank 1 killer twice whole they're carrying someone
---
I like this spoicy Nea! üòçüòçüòç
---
I mean you responded, and you posted it here for whatever reason
---
I'm pretty sure if they're exhausted when they start that part of the loop you can get bloodlust and catch up eventually. But if they use balanced inside the room then you can't get enough distance back to keep a chase and gain bloodlust to anti-infinite. Regardless, it's one of those loops that you go for a quick swing on the first vault just in case then leave them to go find someone else. Simply not worth running it even if you technically could catch up.
---
Here's how you fix this: Just make the opening at the top of the stairs larger. Hell, make it twice as big as it is now. Then they can't block it.
---
I played for an hour today and I used Unbreakable  in almost all my matches. Might start bringing Flip-Flop too
---
M&amp;A is TR.
---
That's pretty solid. Nicely done. How's your creepy humming coming along? Haha
---
Girl in the background its like: oh fuck
---
You cant report for facecamping
---
1. Don't burn out your phase travelling. Always save some for when you see a survivor
---
2. Don't always look in the same way you're phasing, especially if you're leaving a gen.
---
3. It helps to teleport partially to cover (into sheds and buildings), then keep travelling stealthily
---
4. Use phase to change targets to herd groups. For example, if you hit two survivors off a gen, and you know one will go back, then you can pretend to be watching the injured one while you circle back to hit the other one. Same goes for anytime you catch a survivor hiding in the corner of your eye
---
5. Listen for jump falls around staircases and upper floors
---
6. Sometimes it pays to stay in phase just a little while longer as you listen and narrow it down. The extra time can throw off a survivor who is trying not to panic
---
Those are sugar cookies, very soft c;
---
It‚Äôs just a bug, it‚Äôs happening to me too. I already sent a ticket in to support and I know a lot of others have as well, hopefully they‚Äôll fix it soon.
---
Man, these actually look really good! What flavor are they?

It's because of food colouring that's in the dough

these are so awful that I legitimately had to laugh

I'm sad

Fuck off some of these are literally impossible unless you're the luckiest bastard on earth. Goddammit Behavior, this first round was so good too. 
---
I can see this turning into a game where people form impromptu farming groups just to finish it
---
I don't know man. I put this together in like... 15 minutes.
---
Most of the "bottom" tier is still pretty good anyway.

Are you quoting the Constantine movie?
---
Yup, it was datamined before but:
---
1. I datamined this pic too before I saw it on another subreddit
---
2. This subreddit got more people. So whats the harm in letting all of them know about the new skins
---
Cheers
---
It was supposed to work like that apparently but not the case for me at least 9 out of 10 times.
---
I've already had people sabo my event hooks. Literally the only ones they try to sabo the whole game.
---
I also already got cussed out for running NOED. Explained i was doing the challenge to get a sacrifice during EGC and was told doesn't matter with more insults thrown my way.
---
&gt; Not urban evasion'ing in a corner while I die on a hook

"survivor DCs xdddd" - 3k upvotes.

---
&gt;Oh so because one person reports someone for ‚Äúrage quitting‚Äù which is listed in the report system so it‚Äôs fine. you think you can report people for bullying a rank 20 killer.
---
rage quitting is wrongfully listed in-game and hasn't been a reportable action for quite a while now.
---
All reports on that get discarded :)
---
&gt;Since when is Spirit OP?
---
Since Prayer Beads became a thing.
---
The killer is fine until people min max her the fuck out with perks and addons. Prayer Bead spirit is like iri head huntress or omega nurse or any killer with an ebony mori. You just don't want to have to deal with that shit regularly.
---
Nope it‚Äôs an option on the report system.
---
Thanks! All of the steps from opening the pumpkin and cleaning to the final product was about 2 hours.
---
Coal Tower is already a fairly safe loop for anyone with Balanced Landing, though the lack of a vault makes it a lot harder to loop I'll admit.
---
That dude scared the shit out of me as a kid
---
Of course it doesn't exist. That's the point their making. now face camping I can't excuse. I was a survivor main on xbox when it first came out. then about 2 years ago i switched to pc and to killer because I got a decent rig. And face camping used to be a much bigger issue than it is now. you could only pull from one angle and that was straight on. And you had the whole pallet vacuum which was broken as can be. you could heal insanely fast  in like 1 second with the right perks, when the killer wipe was like 3 seconds. And you could blind the killer for over like 20 seconds  So, believe me when I say survivors have a lot of breaks when it comes to dbd.
---
Lol do you even read that subs rules? I used under 5 emojis so force isn't necessary. Now if you'll excuse me, the killer is coming this way. **initiate cloak mode** 
---
*disappears*
---
It's not a bad map, it's just needs to be updated since ,most of the time, strategy is thrown out the window
---
Why are their two pictures of god emperor Xi Jing Ping?
---
Defo a reduction in quality
---
As predicted. Next, iri heads and ghost face
---
Not surprised. I feel like doctors are the kind of killers to do this when they're upset.
---
I'm so glad Legion is permashit tier and requires a lot of work to.. well, work
---
But at the same time I miss release Legion and how fun it was to 3shot everyone in frenzy :(
---
People are sore losers, especially when they are anonymous over the internet. 
---
Basements can be strong, near unfair if the survivor team doesn‚Äôt draw away the killer.
---
The textures and patterns are just right! It's so well done!
---
Would you think about putting a dirt effect on your feet and arms? I bet you want to keep your floors clean but I think it would be really cool
---
&gt;Nope it‚Äôs an option on the report system.
---
The in-game report UI is as old as it gets and needs to be updated. A lot of things there are listed under the wrong category or simply not reportable anymore.

Needless to say that Ghostface and Huntress are most adorable ones.  So god damn well drawn.
---
yes! we! are!
---
Yes. 100%. 
---
In some ways, she is easier to play as with the new addons.
---
This is adorable
---
Dirty, blood flavor
---
Which effectively shuts her pressure down anyway considering how much slower she is in crouch. Besides her visibility to OoO wasnt one of her worse qualities anyway
---
Ok boomer
---
You paid for the premium pass, hahaha üòÇ
---
Nah,left 4 dead,it's kind of ironic since Bill got saved in this clip
---
wah! &gt;:D
---
Still reportable
---
Yes but her fun level is now F Tier because waiting for recharges while moving slower than survivors feels fucking weird.
---
I've heard a Claudette move a tiny patch of grass around a rock. That ended up killing her.
---
Take my audible chuckle
---
Lol'd at the last sentence
---
Ofcourse, I always play fair,  but if a survivor gets unhooked right in front of my nose, I won't hesitate immediately downing the person who just got off the hook
---
Still hate how they teased legion and then when he's released it turns out all he can do is run fast and lose games even faster.
---
Sshhh don't tell them. They might actually learn how to mind game as survivor
---
*Shakes fist*

---
I get it when there's 3 plus gens left. Had a 20 doctor slowly kill everyone and we're down to the last gen. I've been looping and buying time for a good 2 an a half minutes. Eventually I run pass the hatch and see the Claudette waiting for me to die. At this point I have 2 gens going on both ends of the map. I mess up an get hooked. I then proceed to struggle for every second and just before I die the doctor leaves and gets the last survivor before the hatch opens. Felt nice to fuck her over when all they had to do was one gen while I had the doctors attention.
---
Yeah daddy lay that pipe in my ass.
---
Every other survivor: *blood curdling scream*
---
Steve: welcome to my opera performance
---
Doing two solo in the PTB was painful enough. Only way you‚Äôre doing 4 is by playing with a SWF and trekking them to stay off the gens.

Should we actually try to apply this logic to any killer? If that's the case many other killers would be way more op, you know that I hope
---
Corn maps are only bad for Hag or Pig because their camera is lower, that's it.
---
If you have trouble tracking survivors, IDK what to tell you except get some glasses or some shit.
---
I tried it once, but the same again
---
Thanks for the tips. I have some follow up questions if you don‚Äôt mind. 
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt I look In The direction I‚Äôm phasing? 
---
I‚Äôve always heard that spirit can fake phase to trick people... but she only loses her terror radius once she REALLY phases right? (So anyone paying attention knows it‚Äôs fake). Or does her radius only go away once you‚Äôve phased and popped out of it (essentially moving your radius from your original spot to your pop out spot instantly).
---
Tunneling is an actual strategy, at least putting a survivor on the ground while going after another one. That takes two out of the game. It's one that legitimately works too, the only thing is that you're a cunt if you do it and it's one of the most infuriatingly asshole moves you can pull.
---
Needs more hobbits feets üòÑ
---
Looks great!
---
&gt; Sure the doctor could just not be a dick and simply move, but we have shown that it is possible to end the game naturally despite this. 
---
read  you pleb
---
Nah, was a pretty obv mockery of actual people crying about spirit lately
---
Was funny
---
How do you know this
---
It doesn't shut down her pressure anywhere near as much as someone with OoO calling out her location on coms though. It's not a huge buff but there's no denying it's useful. Most of the time when someone has OoO they'll be in a call with their teammates, as on your own it's useful sure but nowhere near as useful.
---
People are lazy assholes that want everything handed to them for free that‚Äôs why
---
Well glad I'm not the only one. I've brought this up multiple times here and on the forums and nobody ever seems to know what I'm talking about. Like I'll be chasing somebody and make a turn to follow them but my character just keeps turning after I let go of the controller sometimes spinning in circles. And restarting the PS4 doesn't always fix it for me.
---
I'm having a issue when I'm queuing as survivor it will tell me host unavaible then I will lose my menu options and ill que forever. Just now after a match I went into a loading screen that was infinite too
---
I‚Äôm all for cosmetics, but I understand when other say things like steamer merch in the game takes away from the realism. I can not buy it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt see others wearing it.
---
Literally just have to break the rails on the other side of these stairs he's blocking so there's two exits
---
He said a survivor was working with the killer to face camp people and let them die
---
What makes it worse is that someone DCs at the start almost every game I play against spirit, which makes getting those gens done harder, I can remember quite a few game where my team lost with 1 gen remaining and someone DCing.
---
Ps4 struggles to run this game sadly.
---
Is this an Otz reference?
---
Jake needs to keep his distance from the Legion. Getting stabbed hurts.

Nvm then

&gt;just remembered its an event and they like to ruin it

Lol I play both, but I was referring to when I‚Äôm a survivor.
---
I really hate the new interest in data mining everything coming to the game it ruins the hype. Cosmetics are fine but when they spoil big stuff like lore such as this or future content that's when it goes too far.
---
Not really... Unless you also think the swamp boat is Haddonfield 1.5 because there's a big vault off the boat.
---
Nice assumption. I'm not on pc and I haven't messaged people to harass them. I've gotten messages though, it's not that big of a deal.
---
They can also widen the doorway and staircase
---
I'll have to try it. Just from my recollection the entire side bar to the left disappeared. No bloodweb icon no shop or character select none of that stayed.
---
Not really, no. I think the people saying she is must be either survivors or just high as a kite lol
---
I think that the deadzone isnt the problem
---
Are hatch standoffs even a thing anymore?
---
What a cutie! I hope you will continue drawing things from dbd, Steve maybe?
---
‚ÄúHah you caught us, we were really trying to bully you by... running a terrible perk?‚Äù
---
Honestly some of those tome 4 challenges make it look like bhvr has no idea what actually happens in their game.
---
I'd say put a vault spot that forces a medium / slow vault. Just put some shit next to it so you can't angle it to be a fast vault. There's a few spots like that in the game already.
---
I suppose not really, the hatch is pretty much fine as it is.
---
2018 Halloween hooks: *Covered with disgusting vines and flowers that wilt away when you hook a Survivor.*
---
2019 Halloween hooks: "Lol let's put some pumpkins underneath it and call it a day."
---
I get that they had to make space for the charms but the new hooks are seriously lazy. Likewise with the new gens which they literally just put a few pumpkins on. You couldn't have covered it with the pustula plants or something?
---
It‚Äôs an advertisement for their cosmetic store, it‚Äôs not even really an event.
---
Nah I‚Äôm just gonna look at leaks
---
Pretty sure a killer can bodyblock the hatch by standing on it
---
How to get spotted 101
---
How often do you see that happen? It's a waste of time for both parties when you can just close the hatch and kill them in end game 90% of the time.
---
Haha thanks! Just got the game in the Halloween sale so I'm new to the community üëå
---
On Valentines day I message a survivor to go on a date with me. I make them dinner and buy them a gift. We hang out in the basement and enjoy our meal, after that they search the chest to receive the gift I bought them. But the true gift is the noed I am saving for endgame. I will make sacrifices in their name and blood will flow in their glory.
---
TIL that some people are fine with 2 free kills deriving from absolutely no skill.
---
Legacy are the prestige cosmetics of 2016, the year the game was launched. It's impossible to get it now so its pretty rare
---
They been saying this forever, until then I‚Äôm free to do as I please
---
You never said the words currently or bug. You simply said if it was through hatch it doesn‚Äôt count. That‚Äôs you giving incorrect information. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt with this. If you typed it wrong, specify then next time. Or just accept that you were wrong instead of changing your answer. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt with this. It‚Äôs been days.
---
Make it 30 seconds, i could easily get myself a glass of milk and be back at the game within 60.
---
Also makes it shorter than some survivor perk timers.
---
Are you on PS4 too?
---
The tier list doesn‚Äôt say anything about her lunge, the fuck you mean?
---

---
I guess he likes the killer
---
What are you smoking
---
I faced you the other day haha.
---
I can't say either which one of those. Mostly I'm just cringing hard from this cursed image of self-caring rank 1 David stuck in my head
---
That's a fair point, it's not like it really does anything besides from prevent bodyblocking for a prolonged period. You could do the same for survivors to prevent trolls.
---
Waaah*
---
Because nobody runs [Iron Will](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iron_Will), plain and simple. It‚Äôs a *severely* underrated perk that has the additional benefit of hard countering the Spirit. So many survivors are meta whores (can‚Äôt function without their DH/DS/Adrenaline/BT/SC/UE/P3 Claudette‚Äôs) who refuse to think outside the box and try a less meta perk.
---
And as for tunneling, you can think it's toxic all you want. But you have to remember, YOU were the one that got caught. You have a litany of exhaustion perks to chose from that help you in the chase. you HAD insta heals until now when they nerfed that because it was so op. Not to mention pallets and flashlights that can be used by you or team mates to help. If you get caught you have no one to blame but yourself. Just like in killer, if you let a survivor run you around for 10 minutes and wonder why all the gens got done. You still have nobody to blame but yourself. You have certain tools you bring with you to help with certain situations. if you can't make them work, then you were ill equipped. The killer shouldn't have to show sympathy for you if it's his/her's goal to get you out of the game.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and can only record 30 seconds of gameplay. That‚Äôs how it works, in clips.
---
you might have seen a piece of clothing that is the default survivor clothing with blood on it, that you get from the 'prestige' system.
---
Legacy clothing is a version of this that you got if you'd prestiged before a certain patch when levelling was changed to be easier.
---
Yep. That's BHVR in a nutshell.
---
It's almost like this entire feature was designed to keep people grinding.
---
Oh wait...
---
Apparently, if one survivor DCS while loading into the match, it also counts. literally just happened to me
---
*breaks survivor‚Äôs neck by ripping the head with mouth*

# FUCKING RAW!
---
Its actually strangely adorable
---
Preach üòÖ we're happy that  people liked them üòÅ didn't expect this many upvotes at all
---
Listen if you're gonna be farming eachother I'm not leaving that hook
---
Except if you're in a call with SWF, and you have someone using object, even if they're not calling your location out, you're still not applying pressure to the map or the survivors. These survivors won't care much if they're put into a chase, since they'll probably know what they're doing anyway, else they'll be sitting on gens and you'll be uselessly making your way around the map slowly which will have 0 impact on these people.
---
The only time it is useful is if you're going to stay near a hooked survivor
---
Probably died due to EGC
---
Thankyou! Happy Halloween to you too! üòÅ

This looks like bait or a beta ngl. Behaviour is stupid but they're not *this* stupid.

I wanted the coffee shop Feng Min skin to win so baddddddd it looked really good.
---
How about having the Pig traps kill people when they leave the fucking gates! That was the whole point of her traps in endgame!
---
Ok. Thanks
---
It looks a bit more polished now, but I like the variety in color, it makes it a lot less eye melting.
---
For sure yes, because she's now also easier to learn.
---
Yeah idk what was up with him.
---
Like it felt like he was genuinely offended that we used No Mither. 
---
Logic.
---
Reminds me of how I always played killer exclusively. Most of the reason I didn‚Äôt play survivor was because I was honestly kind of afraid of disappointing my teammates. Eventually I decided to put some BP into Jake and bam, now I play Survivor and I _still_ disappoint my teammates B)
---
Like 16
---
Both could be interesting perks
---
I'm on xbox
---
No, that means he cannot be detected by  perks. He has 6 meters on Terror Radius
---
LMAO don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre good.
---
Please don‚Äôt tbag me
---
Couple of things just to help you out!
---
1) Welcome to the game, first of all.
---
2) When you‚Äôre injured, killers can see your trail of blood and hear you making the groaning noises and everything. That‚Äôs why the Myers knew you were behind the wall.
---
3) When you run, you leave behind scratch marks. They‚Äôre bright red and basically give away your position if a killer is chasing you.
---
4) Always save your flashlights for the perfect moments. Like when a killer is breaking a pallet, vaulting a window, or picking up another survivor. It is the best and easiest time to use your flashlight as there‚Äôs a small amount of time where they can‚Äôt move their camera to look away from the light.
---
You fell victim to the classic trapper blunder. This man gives me so much anxiety in matches.
---
You should not be biased on a perk to solve x problem 
---
She has no feedback therefore during a chase, totally luck based.
---
play killer sometimes
---
2 survivors are free and can finish gens to initiate the end game collapse which would cause the game to end. Who is keeping who hostage, the killer who resorted to an admittedly dirty trick or the 2 survivors who refuse to do gens and progress the game? 
---
Thompson house is a bad design and the killer is taking advantage of that, I agree the killer is a trollop and we can criticise him all day but let's also admit that the survivors who are not trapped can make this go away but they choose not to. Therefore the free survivors are freezing the game.
---
Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
---
As a killer main some of these seem to force me into a playstyle that is super unfun for survivors to go against. Like no one escapes the endgame, you either wait for gens to pop then NOED down 3 survivors after a gate is open (super crap) or you wait for gens to pop, NOED all 4, slug, and open the gate yourself. I'm sorry but 60k bloodpoints is not enough to make me play that way. Doing the challenge in tome 1 for 1 sacrifice during EGC i ran NOED and blood warden and felt like an asshole. Screw doing that to 3 players.
---
Search 4 chests with plunderers. You know that sounds kind of tame but if everyone is trying to do it it‚Äôs gonna be real annoying. This is just gonna make the game turn into a farming simulator. Killers and survivors just trying to complete the challenges are gonna he messaging each other before game and shit
---
 Pig doesn't need buffs 
---
Change my mind
---
Except not every runs instas every single game, sometimes teammates will never help and sometimes they will unhook right in front of killer. How is me not having a "deny save" option my fault? How is the saviour being a complete dunce my fault?
---
&gt;I'm glad a killer is stuck in a horribly imbalanced state
---
The devs have recently been using country names for upcoming killers/chapters. Pretty sure "Sweden" means something entirely new.
---
ohhh~
---
I was thinking the later ones would get pretty hard. People blew through the first page in one night.
---
Nasty fuck killer challenges are one thing, but if you're a survivor it's gonna feel like you're playing against the other survivors. SWFs are gonna be a must.
---
Waluigi is too sexy for dbd.
---
Still better then testicluar torsion
---
***Power Glove when?***
---
Who said anything about tracking? What are you even talking about?
---
I know the second level is supposed to be released in November 13th but I can‚Äôt remember the other ones, and BHVR also stated that the dates are subject to change so not 100% sure
---
No shit, I‚Äôm saying how you mentioned how the survivors were holding the game hostage yet saying that showing how you are hypocritical and it seems you still can‚Äôt understand.
---
He has 6 meter terror radius but can be reduced to 0 with monitor and abuse
---
Yes however you lose immunity to spine chill and prem
---
Ok thanks mate
---
I‚Äôm not. But this map is still broken which is a bigger issue than a sore loser being a jerk
---
Pretty active
---
Go stomp in some mud and i think she also had a bandage on her right foot.
---
When the flair was originally not shit post/meme my comment makes more sense, or is that difficult to understand?
---
Scratched mirror Myers with another add-on that slows him, but he doesn't stalk. Really just a masochistic build
---
It's like the fog got thicker and thicker over the years.
---
Okay, good. :) And always take them on walks!
---
I don't speak code, can someone with more brains than me translate?
---
very active as killer I get in games in about 15 secs.
---
Not with those ashy chalky ass deformed feet
---
If someone could photoshop a cancan dancer leg onto him that would be swell
---
Oh wow thank you so much!! I definitely didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to the tutorial haha I really appreciation the advice because I want to get better at this game and not be a burden on my team lol
---
I play PS4 and I can find killer matches instantly, not even a minute of waiting, on survivor tho it takes 5+ minutes and sometimes 10+. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm only rank 13 killer and rank 4 survivor?
---
Nice, I think I'll pick it up after work.
---
So I'm genuinely interested in your recipe, also how you molded them.
---
If possible, please enlighten me senpai
---
Thanks for the reply, I am going to pick it up while it is still on sale.
---
A pretty lobby doesn't make you money. duh
---
Thats wicked fast i tend to have 5 minutes waiting time üò± what region are you in?
---
Your welcome, and that's understandable, due to you saying that you looked like Michael Myers who needs to go to the barber. Without a doubt your cosplay is really good.
---
Yeah, it may be different there. Either way it‚Äòs quite an annoying bug.
---
ITS BLOODY RAW!
---
Are you going to the Olympics with those mental gymnastics or is it just domestic for now?
---
You'll improve faster when you struggle, but if you want the easy way, sure.

---
I play a lot of killer,  are there any that are difficult to play on console?  I know people used to say nurse was garbage on console.
---
~~legion deserves it~~
---
Not what I said nor advocating; it‚Äôs a very strong perk that has saved me (sometimes even mid chase) against the entire killer roster with some careful movement. It just so happens it‚Äôs extra good against Spirit (for those survivors who struggle against her, specifically).
---
damn but I also depends on were u are and from texas central time right. ownis 9 am and I'm currently playing spirit in a lobby so its fast the longest is 3 min for me but NAT type could do something with it as well when myns is actually open I get in games faster vs moderate
---
This isn't even mentioning that iron will has a fairly common bug where it will only count as rank 1 iron will I've noticed. Still hear cries of pain but about half as loud as usual... My main issue with her is that she's just too easy to play for how oppressive she is and her design allows virtually no counterplay. To counterplay her you need VERY specific adding which is the case for no other killers ingame.
---
C
---
:WeSmart:
---
Sound events. The OneShot thing in the header is misleading, that just means to play a sound once.
---
This killer has sound events for Basic Attacks, wiping off the weapon, some sort of status toggle "crazy", whatever the fuck "abs" and "das" reference in this game, and some sort of charged ability that can be cancelled...But since the "charge" events also has the word "mod" in it, maybe its part of an alternate ability from an add-on. You'd have to look at other killer sound events to know what is or isn't normal though, because I don't either lol.
---
You are wrong.
---
You should post this on r/Oinkers_
---
That was great
---
No terror radius at command;
---
Slows down the game thanks to her traps;
---
Easier to do mindgames with, because she is short;
---
Those 3 things are really good at high ranks.
---
Now, why should they buff Her and not Clown, Trapper, Leatherface, Legion or Doctor?
---
That sucks I'm sorry.
---
Lol, are people seriously angry? C‚Äômon guys, don‚Äôt take yourselves so seriously! I think this tier list effort is kind of sweet, actually. Gives you all a little collective memento of this Halloween.
---
Btw, its totally correct too guys let‚Äôs be real.
---
Yeah, it takes me about 10 minutes to find one as killer but then again that was 2-3 months ago. But yeah, like you said, not a deal breaker at all!
---
Eh, worse things have happened. Game is still fun, at least.
---
You don't really get any feedback as a survivor, but when it happens to you as Myers it feels like some three stooges slap fight bullshit.
---
Umm good question lol. Most likely yes.
---
There were 3 pestula petals tho
---
Im not so sure orgasmic is the word you looking for. If it was the word you were looking for, ill repeat myself.
---
W H A T
---
5 minutes for survivor? I have to wait around 15!
---
Aren't jokes supposed to be funny?
---
I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so funny about this scene. I also don‚Äôt see how someone would think of this when thinking of trapper catching someone at the shack via trap.
---
we were only able to get one done
---
&gt;While we understand that expectations are high, we want to reiterate that crossplay is only available between PC versions of the game for the time being. 
---
I can't contain my hype of a possible crossplay with consoles.

---
‚ÄúRuin the game for other players‚Äù.

Play some games as killer versus 4 man SWF sometime.
---
Fucking awesome! Nice job!

Q&amp;Q,head on, inner strength, and ds is the best way to bamboozle the killer in a chase
---
Lie, the top person had 36k, each event gen gives 3k. So he‚Äôs still above 32k. At minimum 2 were done but it looks like 3 were done.
---
Cant fucking agree enough with this! xD
---
it's michael myers. like half of his face and his knife. &lt;3
---
I don‚Äôt know if it was intended, but thank you for pointing it out I enjoy this.
---
Inner strength doesn‚Äôt do anything in this build lmao
---
Not a lie. but I see there is no point in arguing.
---
I felt like it was for the last a couple of weeks of slugfests, but recently I‚Äôve been getting tunneled more so have to bring dstrike instead.
---
Or you know play both sides and realise that they both have shit aspects to them? Not defending this play style but in sick of this them vs us mentality
---
Awww, Nurse made a cute ribbon for Demo. Now it is a cute zerg like killing machine.
---
I don't think that's what the developers intended by that point. Right underneath the bullet in question, I believe those ARE errors in design.
---
I always look at that picture when I complete the gen in that house lol.
---
I‚Äôm just showing you the clip. The rest of the scene has nothing to do with anything.
---
Literally just the ‚ÄúYou will never get this‚Äù. You said you didn‚Äôt know what Borat was, so I was providing you the scene as to which the phrase came from. That‚Äôs all. Lmfao.
---
Well at least 2 were done, just stating where you were wrong
---
Rather then BT I bring it instead. It's used very often
---
The survivor cannot go down the staircase, the only way out because The Doctor is preventing them from moving
---
HybridPanda makes a weekly DbD news series called shrinewatch where he also goes over the shrine, so replacing the shrine means that this week's video is already outdated.
---
What's really sad is this is so true. I just want to oink in peace.
---
If you're injured you can heal yourself in a locker
---
https://youtu.be/7eKv4BEujFU
---
I think if they add a drop to the loker room downstairs it‚Äôd be fine. This is my favorite map and I‚Äôve never witnessed this. IMO this is pretty much a free game for the two other survivors but f for the killer and other two
---
Calm spirit stops screams, Iron Will stops grunts of pain.
---
No it was 3-6 meters
---
So does Michael no longer have a terror radius when he‚Äôs in Evil I, or am I misinterpreting the update?
---
eating all the candy, somewhere... not in this picture tho... :|
---
Yeah hopefully they change these up due to feedback, I was sweating my ass off trying to get 3 chests in one game.
---
well done
---
So you prefer going against the new players. You aren‚Äôt even at high ranks. Only way to get better is to practice and learn
---
Undetecatble means no terror radious though 
---
Applies to a Killer's Stealth Mechanics. When a Killer is Undetectable, the following effects are applied:
---
The Killer's Terror Radius is removed.
---
The Killer's Red Stain is hidden.
---
The Killer will not have their Aura revealed.
---
The Killer does not trigger the jump-scare sound effect that plays when starting to move after standing still for a moment.
---
The Killer sees the smoky screen visual effect, indicating stealth.
---
Stop being so salty, you lie someone calls you out and you start being a twat
---
I never dodge or dc
---
I know but I don‚Äôt know why you yourself think of that scene in that movie specifically
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been trying to learn nurse on and off for like a year on ps4 and I‚Äôm a little upset about the changes. But honestly I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad. There‚Äôs a cool down of only a few seconds now. Compare that to spirit that has a cool down of 15 seconds and it‚Äôs nothing. Plus some of her new addons are fun. Last night I tried using that addon that makes nearby survivors scream when you blink and it was so helpful, like built-in infectious fright but you don‚Äôt even gotta down anyone. And I know you probably don‚Äôt need it but I think making the plaid flannel addon common can make playing nurse so much easier, I used it and it helps so much. Not gonna lie I crutched on three blinks hard before but now I crutch on plaid flannel lol. But yeah I still think she‚Äôs a beast and the most broken killer.
---
Everyone else is still fanning themselves on their fainting couches. They'll be here in a bit, but let them recover from the shock first.
---
Making Spirit visible while phasing would be an enormous game-changer. It would make it possible to loop her, whereas now her air pump noise is equally loud at 1 meter and 5 meters away from the survivor.
---
If more people are queuing survivor then shouldn't be a need for killers? If so and I'm queuing as killer shouldn't I get in a lobby faster?
---
Everyone playing wraith today
---
PC.
---
Probably because it took killers a while to come to consensus that she is high tier, and casual survivors are more just annoyed with how often they have to face her.
---
The fact that you absolutely NEED a perk (iron will) to play against any spirit who isn't blasting power metal while playing makes the killer complete bs imho, anything that FORCES a specific perk/item just to have a chance shouldn't be in a game.
---
Then there's the beads and the standing still "mindgames", but those are far less of an issue to me.
---
It's my understanding it will run you $10.00 usd
---
Active for me now.
---
If you mixed this with that glitch where people you're healing slide away, that would be beautiful.
---
i guess i remember things a bit differently but it was rather quickly when i was still playing the game
---
That looks like a boner
---
Starts now
---
Well, it ain‚Äôt active on the switch. 
---
But then again, we haven‚Äôt gotten the mid chapter update either.
---
Where did you hear that he still has 6 meters of TR? Undetectable means no red stain, no TR, and no being seen by OOO, Alert, etc.
---
Xbox does it too.
---
Meant killer. Not enough survivors for the amount of killers at your range of rank
---
?? 
---
Myers scratched mirror is far from his best add on
---
Tombstone has a considerable disadvantage. Some games the myers might not even get enough stalk to win. 
---
Prayer beads has nothing but advantages. I'm a killer main but I play survivor frequently as well. Spirit is fine. Her add ons are what make her busted.
---
Literally the same thing happened to me going to the same country lol
---
That was so good
---
Is it? Are there more people queuing all day all month long?
---
Just me again on my "alt" I see this one was a big success too
---
Have you been before? Ireland is lovely.
---
No these cosmetics have been known for a while. It's the Day of the Dead collection r/quityourbullshit
---
3 slots, choose the slot you want (position) and equip it
---
Pig mains given best stealth in the game but all it dose is make you depip............
---
What???? It‚Äôs a player base thing. Think of it logically. If survivor queues are long it‚Äôs because too many people are queuing for survivor and aren‚Äôt enough killers and vice versa. Like in the day for me survivor queues are quick and at night they‚Äôre longer. Just how it works
---
Nurse can still be oppressive. She‚Äôs still extremely powerful
---
Swear to god im gonna smash my head into a wall.
---
If he got 0 terror radius, it would get mentioned in the patch notes.
---
For example if a Wraith goes invisible,but has the add-on,in which your TR doesnt get silenced, he still gets the undetectable, as he is in ,,stealth mode''
---
I'm kinda surprised at how much they nerfed instas. Was it that bad as a killer? I can't say I've ever had an issue as a killer with insta heals
---
Unbreakable can either be useless or change the entire game. I‚Äôve seen one unbreakable completely change the outcome of a game. It‚Äôs situational, but in the right situation can save your entire team
---
She‚Äôs balding!!!
---
Perfect üëèüëèüëèüëè
---
Both NOED and Insta heal have counters. Granted insta heal requires you to either be able to insta down or use a perk.
---
But NOED you just cleanse the totems.
---
Thanks for the exact quote! This is good news, and although I love her to death Spirit is *clearly* overtuned. (Yes, I run Iron Will, no, it should not be a requirement to facilitate counterplay.)
---
Hotel : Trivago
---
It‚Äôs a common glitch. Seriously we need to do something about it cause it happens to my friend a lithe time
---
&gt;at high ranks.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Like rank 20.
---
It legit just started lol
---
Bingbong is best
---
Haven‚Äôt tried, I‚Äôll update you when I put the whole costume on üòÇ
---
Crouching doesn't take too long and you can bait it.
---
Announcing her presence it's not a big deal because you can pretend to go in a direction and then switch to the other and that's a hit most of the times.
---
Survivors will waste time taking off her traps, even if it's at their first try.
---
If you can't down 4 survivors by the end of 5 gens and so put traps on their head, means you are doing something wrong.
---
There is no other killer that has a better stealth, she can turn her terror radius off without giving HINTS unlike Wraith. Yes you can compare her stealth to Ghostface, but he has a cooldown if they spot him or he hits a survivor.
---
People: SHIRTLESS MEYERS!
---
BHVR: pantless? Alright!
---
I‚Äôve seen people mention they‚Äôre having problems with it, here is the response I got from BHVR.
---
Keys are the equivalent of moris since they do the same thing, win games faster. Neither moris or keys were touched.
---
Man i hate killers that camp, we get it you're bad at the game lmao.
---
Is that where you play? :)
---
Wait what does OoO mean
---
"He moaned this high"
---
Pig could be made so much better just by reworking her shit add-ons. There's roughly 4 that do some variation of "increase chances of triggering skill check on trap boxes" or "increasing penalty for failing skill check on trap boxes," neither of which are worth a damn above rank 15. 
---
"Disables Pig's ability to see trap boxes, but lets you see survivor aura while removing a trap" wtf is that, that's useless!
---
Instead, the add-ons should be stuff like increasing the distance of her dash attack (with corresponding increases in charge or cooldown), increasing Pig's speed while crouched (Right now she moves at 3.6 m/s iirc, it would be easy to have add-ons that increase that speed to 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1 (which would still make her slower than the Hag), and some fun shit like an ultra-rare add-on that lets Pig activate all traps which are currently placed on survivors (restoring her awesome end-game pressure).
---
No it's been there years and if someone insta heals I'll just chase them and hit them again and if they get away then good on them it disappears anyway xD
---
Clown only guarantees hits when the Survivors are greedy as shit.
---
Trapper either sets up too long, or he sacrifices rank to use a late game build.
---
Doctor has one of the highest skill ceilings in the game with little reward. Finding Survivors as easy as he does isn't special when high tier Survivors don't hide in the first place.
---
I didn‚Äôt notice it and they said the 31st at 11am the blood hunt starts.
---
The only thing worth mentioning imo
---
You could strike me down and hook me as much as you want.. Well can't hook me more then 3 times but still
---
Nice! Time to level my Nancy
---
U win. At dbd and life
---
tru but it's like when the exit gates are open, no one is leaving and they expect you to chase them to the exit gate so they can "sneakily" save their friend.
---
1000 extra for hooking and when gen finishes
---
Guys, have you read Spirit's tips while loading a game? Devs had a different idea about playing Spirit. For example that "Use the husk to block survivor's path", who does that?
---

---
I thought Sweden might hint to a sci-fi-horror killer because that's where the CERN Supercollider is located, but then I remembered that it is actually in Switzerland.
---
almost instant queue as survivor and maybe 1-5 min queue for killer. 4man swf takes a bit longer but thats expected
---
Yes this does suck indeed! I'm lucky as I play PC too so not having the events synced, it works out better.
---
I'd say they're either having a bad time getting the patch verified or performance/stability issues... I pick the latter as the menus are poor for switch as it is, only adding pumpkins and archives will make this menu worse.
---
Anyone have any idea how we are going to even see them charms? Bad enough on PC, will just be some blur added to your survivor/killer lol.
---
Oh thank you
---
He needs panties like any other anime schoolgirl
---
ok this is epic
---
Same, god damn it!
---
At least you are saying she is not the worst.
---
I don't agree with the rest of the things you said and already gave my opinion on it
---
Queues were always like this. They change every day and between each update. It‚Äôs just how the player base works. Can‚Äôt have games if not enough people are playing
---
The sad, three-eyed horse at the Asylum is turned into those awful horsemeat meatballs.
---
1000 for every hook/gen, changes to 3000 if you play an offering. You can only use each hook once I believe.
---
The entire post. Just looks like an instagram post.
---
Also, the meme makes no sense.
---
personally i love how competitive red ranks are. if youre into that then you‚Äôll enjoy it. you dont always get the best teammates but waaay better than purple and green people lol
---
you cant tell me anti-hemorrhagic is better than styptic now.
---
Faaaake
---
I have seen exactly 1 RBT kill with Pig, and even in the midgame, her traps lack a real threat, considering that you have 2:30 to actually remove the damn thing, and 9/10 it comes off in less than a minute, and that‚Äôs assuming the trap ever gets to arm. 
---
As for her lunge, you can potentially mindgame pallets, however you also give a warning before actually lunging making it effectively useless as an actual ambush. 
---
As for actually buffing her, I‚Äôm not hearing reasons not to. Her crouch is objectively worse than Ghost Face, who also can instadown, her lunge shouldn‚Äôt be telegraphed at all (It‚Äôs fucking called Ambush, why does she roar before it?), and the boxes shouldn‚Äôt be shown until the trap is actually armed. Just because RBTs CAN explode before the endgame doesn‚Äôt mean that they actually ever will, but at least you can make it take slightly longer. You aren‚Äôt exactly giving valid reasons that she doesn‚Äôt need a buff.
---
So yesterday I had to get 4 phase hits for a daily ritual, and I needed to break 6 generators for the Archives. My Spirit is really awful and I was playing on speakers, but I just ran her with Pop, Overcharge, Brute Strength and BBQ. Killed no one, I just focused on getting phase hits and breaking gens.

Poor Jason.  He just wants to be involved.

yeah you are right, but they are still the equivalent. Devs said they will touch keys and moris in the future though.
---
Inner strength is eh. It‚Äôs a nice idea to slap on that build but I feel like the 8 second wait time doesn‚Äôt really do anything since head on has a 3 second wait time. If they were equal I could really see how it adds to the bamboozling but since it doesn‚Äôt it just seems like an excuse to stay in lockers but at the same time act like you‚Äôre being productive.

Yes a Creator Creates a Meme or Video to attract an audience that enjoys there work to his or her platform. And how does the meme not make sense. You must not play DBD

Meanwhile my 4'11" self can't cosplay as anyone.

Don't let anyone tell you you can't cosplay Mike because you're a woman.  I see plenty of dudes cosplay as Amanda so there should be no double standard.

I'm really happy they added it and everything, but could they not given us a little heads up?

Time for me to prestige David!

I have been playing PC a bit more with the event, maybe players are doing that with no event on switch atm.

Played on switch lastnight a little, matchmaking was nice for several games then I hit a hefty wall of sitting for 40 mins until I gave up.

Incompetent survivors, probably all T3 Claudettes

The next like level of challenges got leaked, some of them are pretty difficult

Adorable BUT is the clown pretending to be Jason?

Ye. It's the sad truth

You‚Äôre right! They need to make it so that Killers can bring map offerings too!
---
......... oh wait
---
Just to clarify anyone that reads this comment, body blocking is not reportable or against the terms of service, what this guy is doing in the video is holding the game hostage by body blocking which is reportable. If you body block as a survivor or killer for an actual reason (blocking hook/ blocking vaults or pallets respectively) it's not bannable. I have no idea what the other dude is trying to say I just wanted to clear up in case anyone thinks body blocking in every way was bannable
---
Fing is playing mario kart
---
Yes, it does suck, because if you attempt to do it at any other point besides at that 1 second of opportunity, it never works unless the killer is rank 20. Amazing fucking gameplay!
---
What game or movie is Ash from? ( please dont downvote me to hell for this ;-;)
---
Its more of a side-grade. Hem syringe got put in the dirt but syptic just got its uses changed. Now its more of a single use item for yourself/ghetto borrowed time if you basement dive.
---
Instead of using it for someone else to negate a killers chase it is more useful in chases or to be altruistic, perfect rework imo if not maybe overnerfed to 8 seconds.
---
saying cosmetics dont take dev time is stupid is what im saying. im surprised people are okay with the amount of MTX in this game.
---
Because the person looping should know how many gens are done. It is pointless for them to ask and be surprised.
---
If played right (Which funny enough is not how hes intended) he can be annoying and works much like legion. He wants to use his no terror radius to injury as many people as possible with thanatophobia, it's annoying plus some folks dont like hump scares I guess. I for love him and dont get why they cant handle a little poo in the pants...
---
Piano music time
---
All gens done, door opens I don‚Äôt see camping.. just trying to get the kill
---
Live a good life not a long one as a wise Ash J Williams once said. Go with your heart jefe
---
&gt;I'm kinda surprised at how much they nerfed instas. Was it that bad as a killer? I can't say I've ever had an issue as a killer with insta heals
---
I was surprised with the extra mile they went with Syringes. From 8s on PTB to 16s.
---
I love it, but it has to be entirely black to get the authenticity. Great job nonetheless!
---
I'm bad at the game, too. But I don't camp. I stay near and check gens around it but I don't literally stand like that.
---
Oh, I see, then your original statement is correct.
---
He doesn't but then it becomes completely holding the game hostage and it's entirely bannable
---
She hugged me!

I‚Äôd also like to point out this comment from not_Queen regarding cross play:
---
&gt; We are a long way from full crossplay support. However, when we get there, we are hoping to have better controller sensitivity and options which should make the feature more fair for console players. For some console platforms, it is even mandatory to have a opt-out option for crossplay. So don't worry üòä
---
Buy who you want. If you want Ash, get him! Some survivors have better attributes (smaller, quieter, dark clothes) but a good player will do fine as any survivor. 
---
I love me Ace, but he has poor perks like Ash so you'd just be playing him for his quietness while Ash is Ash Williams and is cool by default. 
---
Basically don't worry too much about the noise, or even size for that matter. All survivors have the same base mechanics and that's what matters.
---
No real punishment, no accountability. They will keep doing it
---
I have been running thanatophobia. I'm trying to prestige him though and I dont have many other perks to help with that. Monitor and abuse probably doesnt help when I'm not stalking either.
---
YES! This is the Pig buff we have been waiting for!
---
Should've edited some crows in

&gt; I‚Äôd also like to point out this comment from not_Queen regarding cross play:
---
Very interesting. Thanks for sharing it!
---
well addons vs addons gf is generally speaking better than huntress as well, aside from possibly insta down
---
What‚Äôs wrong with flip flop
---
That‚Äôs such a bad argument. She‚Äôs been out over a year now, everybody with more than a months experience knows how to play against her, it‚Äôs the fact that there‚Äôs little to no counterplay. She hits you once, and phases to catch up to you. Mind games at a vault or pallet is 50/50 at best, or even better she collides with your character and it‚Äôs gg. Even a bad killer with a decent headset will stomp people with her. She‚Äôs so incredibly easy to use, I‚Äôm the most average killer in the game and spirit is the only killer than can carry me to rank 1 and keep me there.
---
Monstrous doesn't have a stupid requirement or terrible downside. It's pretty straight forward as far as perks go.
---
*No, I have no idea why I'm trying to defend a garbage perk. I just like it's flavour haha.*
---
As a killer main, I guess I dont really see it but when it happends holy shit it like a fucking action movie.

Thats cheap af.

If you play any killer other than The Shape I dont know what you guys are doing with your life TBH

Just because doors are open doesn't make a difference, it's still camping lol. It's even worse when they down somebody and leave em there waiting for the other one to die lmao.
---
Object of Obsession, a survivor perk that makes it so when you look in the killer's direction, you see their aura and reveal yours to them.
---
It was a bane of all the stealth killers, especially when used in a 4 man group, where only one person takes the risk and tells everyone else where the killer is.
---
This patch, stealth killers got Undetectable on their abilities, making them immune to aura reading
---
Nah you're good man, Ash is from the Evil Dead franchise. He's basically one of the biggest badasses in film and has faced off and won against things way bigger than any of the killers in this game.
---
Idk man. Maybe the other survivors got them broken already before I got in the chase
---
The event BPs (hooking, in your case) are not in one of the capped categories. Otherwise, they'd be fairly useless. About 3K a pop, they'd max out a single category and then you wouldn't get any more.
---
Fair enough.
---
Ah yes very fair and balanced
---
So if Pig is crouched, the OoO can‚Äôt see her, but does she still see the OoO‚Äôs aura?
---
We dont get banned for changing ini files? Do we?
---
The other survivors left you up there by not opening the door to end the game
---
I had the same bug
---
Oh! I've heard about that game before, makes me wanna check it out now lol
---
Always camp it out, or use them as bait. Always do what‚Äôs best for you!
---
I think the 8 seconds to for counterplay on the killers side, cuz if its 16, then if u wait 16 seconds it could be the syringe
---
Oof easy new wallpaper for my phone.
---
Her glass shards glow up when she phases. It's very hard to see but it's a feature. I think I'll post a meme about this on reddit so people learn about this fact.
---
Archives and 2X BP?! That's a pretty juicy update.
---
While I don't argue the engine has a lot of problems, The Outer Worlds uses it and it looks pretty decent.
---
You sound salty as fuck there.
---
True3talent has some good vids and has been loving ghost face, might be worth a look. I dont have any meta perks on him yet and been seeing some good SWF get thrown off by ignoring the stalk and just whacking them. Hes become one of my fav killers just because of how often I catch people with their pants down metaphorically speaking üòÖ

Yeah it is. Pubg mobile wants like 25 for the pass which is outrageous. Those guys will charge you money for temporary cosmetics.
---
Thank you for the clarification

Lmao, get your Goofy outta here Bro ü§£. Dude go subscribe to a serious reddit thread. Were everything is Completely laid out for you and the creators don‚Äôt want to be credited for there work. Your playing a game based on Monsters and survivors that play to survive in another realm or dimension and your going to critically try to find holes in a meme that‚Äôs designed to make you laugh. Thanks for your input tho

I played every wednesday of this fck game and the only one I missed the shrine of secrets with only important perk I needed (RUIN) gets refreshed...I'm frustrated. I hope they put the yesterday's shrine on next week or I'll be every more mad. I understand they refreshed it for rift's challenges but at least put it back the following week c mon
---
No you will only get banned for modifying ENCRYPTED game files, it‚Äôs the same kind of situation with all the custom UI mods you‚Äôve likely seen on this sub-reddit, they aren‚Äôt tagged for easy anti-cheat to check so you‚Äôll never get flagged.
---
His big appearances are in the movies but if you have Netflix I'd suggest checking out Ash vs. Evil Dead which is what DBD Ash is based on. It's a great show and you don't even really need to know anything about the movies to understand it
---
I'm not using profanity am i the only acting outrageous now am i?.
---
Borat and his other movie The Dictator were mediocre at best with the occasional hilarious moment.
---
I'm still laughing at "You are HIV Aladeen" five years after seeing it.
---
I love using stalk and just ripping people off of gens. Hes incredibly versatile if I want to sneak around the entire match I can. I can also just come out them. Definitely one of my favorite killers.

BHVR literally just confirmed that she IS statistically overperforming. It's now a fact backed by their numbers.

You're that kid that annoys the teacher by finishing all the tasks way too fast and then there's nothing to do for you anymore.

I really appreciate that! Yeah this was me finally getting all the pieces together and taking a picture. I 100% plan on being dirty as hell whenever I go out somewhere.

one time i got a 4 man kill just from egc

It‚Äôs a nostalgia thing for me.
---
I watched that movie with my synchronized swimming team ages ago, and they quoted the damn thing all the time. Basically to the point where it‚Äôs been seared in my brain forever.
---
I swam with the same team for eight years, so we were all really close. Kinda fell apart after my accident (Was told I couldn‚Äôt swim anymore), and when we all went off to college.
---
So it‚Äôs memorable to me. Lmao.

Love all the idiotic suggestions that basically would turn this house into a balanced landing OP nightmare with countless safe pallets.

Hey, news flash: this can be done in any basement as well, and this isn't some super common thing.

Who press your buttons today lol.

Thank you! I appreciate that.

Yeah I‚Äôm wondering this too, last night I was crouched but could still see the OoO

It was datamined weeks ago and they did tell us yesterday
---
There's a bp cap? Do perks like BBQ also get capped, or do those just multply the capped earned BP?
---
Honestly, a vampire killer is such a great and easy thing to do, why not?
---
Revoke his license! He is a fraud!
---
No
---
Only if you're Ace ;)
---
Hopefully OP sent this alongside the report for this player. We need to get these bad killers out of the community.
---
Balance isn‚Äôt a penance process
---
Only if you‚Äôre not in a chase. 
---
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs lotta people complaining about her 
---
there is literally NO indication that she‚Äôs phasing during a chase 
---
Therefore luck based - and there are still some no brains defending her: ‚ÄújUsT lEaRn hOw tO pLAy AgainSt hEr‚Äù like yeah just let me grab my magic 8 ball and see if he‚Äôs going to tell me if she‚Äôs phasing or not.
---
Happy Halloween üéÉ
---
Nah, they'll hopefully nerf iri hatchet as well. Omega blink just got deleted. 
---
Tombstone and Pig ultra are fine, even if Tombstone is very frustrating to face as a survivor and has not much counterplay.
---
Multiply the final bp scored, otherwise it wouldn't help if you capped it during the game
---
Huah huah ha
---
BBQ for killers and WGLF for survivors are the only 2 perks in the game that let you score more than 32,000 BP. Every other perk that says it gives you BP only helps you reach that 32,000 faster.
---
For some reason I still have not bought the Halloween DLC. It's the only one I don't own other than the Legion DLC
---
Killer is about 100x easier than it used to be especially as they continue to nerf survivor perks and items. Get over it.
---
I personally love using stalknjust to remove the red stain while I'm getting looped in jungle gyms, it adds to the mind game so much, and if you stalk mid chase most survivors want to reveal you and in doing soo bump into stuff very often. Hes absolutely great, and I hope they some day add derpface ad a cosmetic.
---
It multiplies at the end in game the max you can get is 32k but post game you can get like more than 100k depending on offerings and perks
---
Don't disrespect the trapple like that
---
I'm a killer main but I do play survivor about 3 out of 10 games. I can tell you this. Whenever and I mean whenever there is a way to cheese a killer, it spreads like cancer. For example. I seen pallet vacs. The weekend of the flashlight buff that was so op they had to fix it with in 48hrs. Insta pallet saves again fixed in 48hrs. Infinity loop spots, guys on com telling what perks the killer has when they die. The whole mettel of man crazyness. I play for a month or 2 then some new way to cheese killers comes out and boom that's all you see. I came back about 2 months ago and now it's the DC meta or Dcing to so swf gets hatch and 4 man running insta heals. It's always something that gets out on how to cheese. There are more examples I have but my point is that killers have a challenge ahead of them when a method of cheesing them gets out. If you don't understand why insta heals med kits can be OP then I spot a survivor main. Yes you will run  into camping pussys and basement bubba's but that is not exploting survivors that's a bad killer and a low brow strategy. I come and go in DBD and it's always the same. Killers are not allowed to win or do good or even have fun. There is the I must take advantage of any way to cheese the killer meta.  I to have fallen to that side of thinking when I get camped first hook. Now I see the way it is. Some SWF can't take a loss it hurts there ego or they are embarrassed they got killed and they use any excuse to join cheesing cancer there is out there so they feel validated. For example you run adrenaline. Derp. Derp. I use it to counter NOED. What about the killers who agree that NOED is Op. So they don't run it. So now there is 4 man SWF with adrenaline and that is a challenge to any killer game. Now add on 4 man insta heals. Then the DCing for what ever reason. So let's keep bitching about NOED and bitch about the que times because who wants to play killer when they know the cheese meta and they don't want to play. Que times are long because no one wants be killer when shit like 4 man insta heal games. I still play killer. I don't use NOED and I don't camp and I don't send flame messages and no what my reward is? Dealing with explots and getting nasty messages in 75% of all my games. Then I play survivor and get messages by people I don't know telling me unfair Intel or Dcing first hook so I get stomped in a 3 man game. Survivor rule #1. Every nasty thing I can do I will do because the killer is a enemy and any exploting or cheesing or flaming you do is fair and a master stat. Sorry about the rant but yeah. boo to NOED. It's to strong. Boo. Spirt is Op please nerf.....
---
I actually am (: but jokes aside on point cosplay just wow, like it alot
---
Just got to prestige 2 with her and I am super underwhelmed by red blood on red pants. Idk what I expected.
---
What time were you on? Games, pacific time zone, were non-existent from 3am-5am.
---
I love Ace! He's my favorite. Best boy.
---
It‚Äôs a different dev team, so no it doesn‚Äôt take dev time
---
üòÅ
---
Dedicated servers?
---
Don't worry, play any killer you have :P
---
Is jsut that using The Shape during this event feels so right for me, spooking people around the block, staring...
---
BP from archives, bp from event offering, and a bloodhunt? Remember when they were worried about the "economy" and all the ebony mori's generated through it? XD
---
Ty for the fast reply ^^ now I can fix my blind Quentin's hair
---
I hate her red pants, that's why I bought the ones on her alternative skin
---
Nu not my boi
---
Anytime I step into my own traps I feel like the Samination Trapper.
---
So TLDR.
---
‚ÄúOur stats that we refuse to share say Spirit is OP so we‚Äôre gonna giganerf her as soon as possible‚Äù
---
Crossplay should be between all platforms (optional obviously) maybe queue times would be faster, also don't say pc is gonna be better than console because this game doesn't have a high skill gap like most fpses do
---
WOW. Thank you for sharing this. Guess I'll just stop even caring and trying to progress to later levels. I can see like five of those requirements to be doable. The rest are either almost impossible or impossible at all.
---
I would much prefer if they made it 5x more actions but remove the bullshit "in a single trial" requirement. It will make everything as challenging but at the same time possible, you'll work for it and eventually you will unlock it sooner or later little by little. Right now it's not even worth a shot.
---
Also some of the survivor challenges are extremely pro-swf. Like how do you expect to loot 4 chests or do 4 gens on your own? You can ask your friends to not touch gens/chests without you but for a solo player it is totally impossible.
---
The other thing that troubles me is that these challenges will make the toxicity levels skyrocket. People will try extra hard to complete them, it will ruin many many games. People will lose their minds if they were really close to doing the challenge but someone does something in the game that messes with them and it will make people really mad.
---
Overall I like the challenges basic idea, but if THIS is the way they are implemented it WILL ruin games. It's really, really bad.
---
It's a bug
---
You have the stats to back up that argument? Because BHVR have stats backing up the OP's claim and not yours.
---
Never said they shouldn‚Äôt buff the others as well. In fact, Leatherface has something in the oven right now apparently. My history will show I‚Äôm 1000% in favor of completely reworking Legion, and buffing Clown and Trapper. As for Doc, haven‚Äôt played him recently enough to comment on his current state.
---
I didn't see they said anything yesterday, I just remember when the patch was postponed they said, ''no bloodhunt has been announced. Please don't get your hopes up till we announce something, so I thought it wasn't happening. My bad!
---
Anytime I say "no one should be forced to use a specific perk to counter a killer" I get downvoted because "You can counterplay Spirit by using Iron Will"...
---
Downing and picking up the same person within 60 seconds of being hooked isn't necessarily tunneling, is the point.
---
Deliverance right in front of me within a 60 seconds crawl of an open gate and I have to let him go. Or body block me so I have to down, but I have to slug him even if it's a bad play to slug. Or a guy that was unhooked beelines to a gen that's at 90, so I can't leave him to repair it. If I approach he hides in the locker next to it. The correct play is actually to eat the dstrike, which against a good survivor just resets into a new chase.
---
None of that is tunneling. It's good survivors abusing their extra chances.
---
same, ffs
---
Hex:pocketsand. I had a little giggle at that. Double bp is live so that's probably where that extra came from or they may have raised the cap too.
---
Go away Zenyatta
---
Except I don't do that. I was just trying things out. So no, it wasn't warranted.
---
what
---
Apparently Greta Thunberg entered this thread.
---
I mean... the details on the pumpkins are FAR superior, the animations moving into the lobby are actually nice, the overall 3D/animated nature of the lobby is definitely better.
---
These pictures definitely don't tell the story what so ever. The lobby we have now is basically the live action version of the other 2 if we're comparing...
---
Probably for D√≠a de los Muertos (Nov 2nd)? It feels very thematic with Latin American celebrations of the Day of the Dead, but I‚Äôm only guessing
---
I actually watched all ten minutes of this, not for the spoon killer, but for the study of one man's slow descent into madness, then ballistic rampage, then pained acceptance. It's like the five stages of grief.
---
How does this have anything to do with dead by daylight
---
Actually Myers is right to be stunned via pallet, i think he's definitely been stunned from less and a pallet is like 4x whatever I'm referencing. 
---
Freddy could in the past versions but he isn't tied to his lore powers post rework as we can see him while being awake and i think that's where it's hinting at, If players are sick long enough they become broken leading to eventual death, Not many illnesses can do than in a span of like 40 seconds or so lol
---
What do you mean? I killed a survivor that way last time I played. Just put the bear trap on their head BEFORE all gens are done.
---
PS4 has like, 50x more survivors than killers. It's more fun for then to make those sick Twitch juke montages than it is for them to get rekt by framerates/play Spirit exclusively.
---
I hate playing against calm spirit, hits feel like you are slapping a piece of meat
---
In the live Q&amp;A they posted yesterday on YouTube Not_Queen told everyone that a double point Blood Hunt would be active from 10-31 11am till the 4th Monday on all platforms, she stated this in the beginning of the live stream.
---
In my opinion it is different, in a lot of ways.
---
Gameplay for example, you are going to be able to loop/360 easier on console with the FPS being lower, making it a lot more simple to trick killers.
---
The FPS increase on PC also improves gameplay in a lot of other areas too though obviously.
---
M&amp;K is just outright better for killer compared to using controller on console, but this can also reduce comfort, what you prefer overall, I always go for comfort haha (I still use controller on PC when playing survivor)
---
There can be some toxic chat post game on PC, even for making 1 slight mistake, just wanting to have fun unhooking instead of escaping, or even when SWF you may get some toxic comments too, killers also get the rough end too, survivors crying about camping, tunnel, even camping gens lol. So be prepared to either ignore this or join in and not take it to heart, just move on to the next game.
---
Overall I enjoy both sides, I feel console is more casual, but the performance on PC and the more competitive edge keeps me playing both, you will learn more on PC overall, just with the chat and seeing people's complaints and what people class as a GG.
---
It's very cheap on PC too! :D
---
Toopoortoaffordaqualityheadsetsoit'sa5$pairofdollarstoreearbuds master race.

I don't see why this scenario is so hard for people to believe is possible. 2 downs in at least one minute and 59 seconds is very possible. In face since games last and average of 9 minutes or so it's bad to not get that many downs. Especially if you're Billy or Myers or another snowbally killer.
---
 No
---
If your in a swf four people could cleanse five totems in literally no time at all. Even if you‚Äôre playing alone most randoms with cleanse a totem because it‚Äôs free points.  Shit, most of the time you spawn in next to a totem.  One person almost never has to cleanse all five on their own. Plus, if a killer has a hex perk that‚Äôs one less totem that can be noed.
---
‚ÄúBuT yOu HaRdLy RuN iNtO sWf!!!!!!‚Äù
---
I don't think "fun" was on their minds. At least I keep bringing cakes.
---
Okay here is the argument. Her entire power forces survivors to guess which 1 out of several paths/ tricks that the spirit is using and if they guess wrong they get hit. "Is she pretending to phase or is she moving to where I am?". Sure without add ons she loses her insane distance potential with duration or movement add ons but her chases are still fucking insanely quick. With BBQ you can still start chases fairly quickly. 
---
Shes bullshit and I love/ hate it. I play her whenever I get bullied lmao. 
---
I'm not the person you want to ask about balance because I always get downvoted but I really think you should be able to hear her phase when in TR. She might be stood still and phasing, giving her the same mindgame as before and still potentially getting her a hit but at least if the survivor guesses correctly she has a recovery on her power now.
---
Also her add ons need to be tweaked slightly. Except prayer beads. They need to be thrown in to the atmosphere.
---
How bout, no
---
**that just sounds awful to have experienced. Sorry bout your unfortunate history, lad.**
---
I love the pipe, I just wish it had different sounds.
---
And Frank the leader of the Legion is from Kenya.
---
I will never understand what people like about Borat movies because they sound boring to me.
---
oh we were never worried about it, the devs were
---
Can anyone that plays on Switch confirm this being on the Switch too? 
---
They say all platforms but I'm skeptical..they haven't even updated their Twitter bio to include Switch as a platform lol wouldn't surprise me if they forgot about it.
---
That would force people to olay survivor even more and end up affecting queue times worse. You might want to rethink that logic.
---
That's also a valid option! It was only 10 around Halloween sale
---
What? I don't see how a no perk challenge is relevant right now.
---
Na rancor actually needs all gens done, found this out the hard way when I took it for the kill one survivor daily
---
Wait, if you were to scream non-stop on the hook, you won't be sacrificed. Big brain survivor moves right there
---
Why do you care so much what they‚Äôre saying if you‚Äôre only doing a daily?
---
We'll be facing TONS of Moris once people get to the kill 4 survivors in one match challenge. It's not gonna be pretty.
---
*I'm pretty sure that man has never been to medical school*
---
no downside to flipflop its a great perk to punish sluggers great to run with DS because I always get slugged using DS
---
They tried to put him on the cover of vogue but his legs were tooooo long
---
What's wrong with ruin and bbq
---
I don't think it does. Closing the hatch powers the gates and doesn't trigger generators being completed, for example bitter murmur doesn't trigger on the hatch closing. Rancor's description says you can kill when all generators are completed. I did a quick search and seems that Rancor doesn't trigger off the hatch closing. 
---
If they were trying to give me the points it wasn't much help because those first two gens were basically done by me on my own.
---
You can use the hook multiple times, my swf party was hooked on the same one like 5 times lol
---
Nerfing clown.  What.
---
That's exactly it, hardly any counter play even with the most optimal team. I personally don't mind omega/beads/mirror/etc any of the add ons. But I guess if enough people are complaining...
---
Pig does need a buff. She often doesn‚Äôt even get a chance to hit someone while crouching because of the loud growl noise she makes.
---
Hag and Clown are solid mid tier picks at the moment and don‚Äôt need nerfs. Myers is perfectly fine as he is, and while the Spirit does need some changes, it‚Äôs mostly her add-ons that are the issue, not the power itself. These changes are just straight up nerfs.
---
Today I passed by Ace cleansing totem, I said ‚ÄúHi‚Äù (just me being silly), then when he was done with cleansing he said something like ‚Äúhai!‚Äù. xD. Just sharing.
---
Bruh my main build is like
---
Rancor
---
Spirit fury
---
Predator
---
And lvl 1 noed as i have no other good perks lmao. Or should i switch it for franklins?
---
It actually looks really good, so I couldn't even trll. Looks like you used just the right shade of red, too.
---
ash his perk flipflop+ds is good because if you get slugged because ds you can still punish by most of wiggle being full already
---
Swap enduring for NOED and you've got the killers I face lol.
---
Good argument.
---
i dont really think this game is at a point of realism anymore with a lot of joke cosmetics that are out.
---
you have your opinion but i like to see content creators be rewarded in game with a super cool skin
---
And somehow the game would have taken $200 from you, even though you weren‚Äôt sure what you bought.
---
I agree, I even really enjoy using the feather offering to play as Myers for a game, and I hate playing against Myers too lol. Idk why I haven't bough it yet, just haven't been struck with it yet I guess.
---
true you cant get hit when your on it :)
---
Some people who play this game don‚Äôt understand what nerfs and buffs are.
---
Then take my upvote. Because you're one in a million.
---
I feel like this is because their powers are arguably some of the easiest for a new player to use/solve a "problem" for them. This isn't to say the killers are bad or even necessarily noob killers, but Doctor is great if as a killer you can't ever seem to find survivors (especially in early game) as his field does that for you, and Bubba lets you instantly end chases on reaching melee range most of the time instead of them having to deal with the whole second half of the chase. There are definitely good players for these killers, but they also just naturally draw new players.
---
Excellent work. The head-tilt just brings it all together perfectly.
---
only 50% of the recovery bar is converted, it really should be 65-70% to be made more viable
---
Direction baiting only works on certain loops that‚Äôs favorable. Because she also has audio for crouching and uncrouching, the survivor can also abandon those loops for a more favorable. You can punish people who stay in your favorable spots, yes but that‚Äôs rare to see people do after a certain skill gap. 
---
The time to take off a trap in itself is negligible and does not divert attention off generators enough to be considered stall-worthy. Especially when it‚Äôs the first box they search and have visuals of every box without Rule Set 2. The addons that give more skillcheck miss punishment is a non factor as well because unless you‚Äôre running off meta builds like Huntress Lullaby or Unnerving Presense, you can‚Äôt count on survivors missing skillchecks past the same skill gap. 
---
Wraith has an objectively better stealth because he at least has addons that enhance his stealth benefits (while wraith also needs a buff that‚Äôs a wholly different topic) 
---
Ghostface has a much better stealth because his TR and Red stain are gone while he is stealthed, can instant crouch, can be used at command on loops, and can be lethal because it exposes your target and his addons can enhance the aspects of his power without being counterintuitive. Faster recharge, faster stalking, faster crouch speed,  and even longer mark time or revealing who breaks you out for longer. 
---
Amanda is passable as a killer. She can perform well only when the situation is favorable for her, despite her drawbacks. She‚Äôs a product of older killer design and compared to any killer who does anything like her who‚Äôs been modernized like Ghostface and even Demogorgon, the fact she still has all these clunky mechanics means she‚Äôs not worth using versus any other killer.
---
there is no way to tell how many totems are cleansed though? how am i supposed to know the blendette that just vanished into the shadow realm cleansed a totem in the middle of butt fuck no where? i assume there is one left after i cleanse 4. aka, a waste of time
---
It's meant for those people, if you dont want to be spoiled dont do it, simple.
---
Sounds like you want No Mither to me.
---
from what I know, yes. haven't had a chance to test it yet, but that's how it worked with old Freddy. If it works like that, the survivor will also know the direction of where you are (the perk icon will light up, but they won't know your exact position)
---
What game is Feng playing?
---
I legit only use ruin all the time. The other three are all swapable
---
Read the Plague's backstory again. She does *not* think of her illness as holy, you couldn't be more wrong if you tried.
---
Really? Seems fairly reasonable to me. Just trap strong loops and act kind of incompetent and then boom- Trapped survivor.
---
They should have left everything as it was imo
---
Like why the fuck are they so loud for. Like I get it, it hurts but my god shut up.
---
That's a very specific reference I am not familiar with.
---
I just spent a bunch of cakes yesterday!! So I guess. More cakes today!! Lol
---
I'm not complaining about it I'm saying if you want to play that logic then the same can be said about noed. I think both should have been left alone.
---
This image plays AWAKEN MY MASTERS
---
I mean you could make  one of these with survivors too, I don't see the issue in running perks that are good
---
That explains why they have so much trouble anticipating players using strong stuff to antagonize each other.
---
"You really think people would be jerks and do that?" - BHVR
---
I guess I should clarify; I don't dislike the map itself (personally, I  like the layout of it.  Tbh I like most of the coldwind maps).  I just don't like the Thompson house itself since it's so 'linear' and contained.
---
Just run franklin's demise.
---
Have you got the pics and years mixed up or are the devs just making the game look like shit?
---
My bro wanted me to draw Jake T-Posing over Ghostface. Mine looks no-where near as good as yours. :)
---
I mean, it is four people against one. Just think: four survivors pick Ormund, Haddonfield, Coldwind and Red Forest. Killer picks....MacMillan? The Game?
---
Boom, 4 potential maps that suck for the killer.
---
I really hope not. I love playing Spirit and I love how you have to get into people's heads, so I'm on board with the "ONLY remove prayer beads" thing.
---
I watch a lot of DBD streamers, yet even many of them are unaware of this fact.
---
A lot of people complain that spirit's "mind games" are just a coinflip, there is no real skill involve, and I do slightly agree. I'm not defending spirit, I do think she is too strong compared to solo survivors.
---
Who uses enduring and spirit in every killer lol
---
That would be pretty cool if they were just accomplished as you went. but since I normally choose and achievement and hunt until I get it, the selecting beforehand doesn't bother me too much
---
Holy shit someone else now show to counter her. I thought I never see the day

Instead of repairing generators you have to put together random furniture with Swedish names that aren‚Äôt related to the product whatsoever
---
This is why people bring DS and Unbreakable. So now you can't win, either you get DSed or they stand up by themselves
---
as a fanboy, pantless is ok for me.

So we should just let survivors escape and lose the game. Nice idea
---
I got 2 ebony moris last night, it's crazy
---
Omg i loled at 'blendette' xD

Tell that to amputees with phantom limb pain.

So take the thing that makes each killer viable and nerf it to shit, because you think it's too "oppressive"?
---
Bold strategy.
---
this or speed the recovery up
---
Ace has a really good perk for farming items. Ash has absolutely no good perks. Ash himself is cool though but Daddy Ace is also really hot.
---
Also don't forget to use a Haddonfield offering for maximum Halloween.
---
Cost was a repost apparently.
---
Gets DSed
---
You obviously didn‚Äôt read the entire thing. This isn‚Äôt biased towards either side, I‚Äôm just saying that BOTH need to chill the hell out. Not sweating doesn‚Äôt men you won‚Äôt lose, just don‚Äôt be an ass about the event hooks/gens.
---
Nothing is changed on my end and I even have rivaturner enabled showing the GPU usage. In some maps it even lowered the usage.
---
Even at remotely high ranks survivors are going to see trap placement from a mile away, you have to be really clever about your traps. Trapping on the go sometimes works but there's always a big risk of someone seeing you put the trap down. Rank 20-15 you'll probably not have much trouble but everything beyond that and you're pretty fucked. Better Trappers than me could probably do it because when you're good at playing Trapper you're good at herding people where you want them to go but most people who want to complete the archives won't be a 500 hour Trapper main
---

Bingo. Most of the time it seems like a waste of time since the speed nerf. These days I just run Iron Will and stay injured unless I come across a helpful teammate or a medkit from a chest.

Exactly but why chill, I should just not try??
---
Sorry for earlier repost, Literally couldn‚Äôt find this post until now
---
That‚Äôs an opinion. And even more of a reason to stop pushing it if it‚Äôs true. 
---
The last streamer pack you can barely find anyone still active. Adding guaranteed dead content doesn‚Äôt help this game. Spending cosmetic development resources on something lore specific would be a much use of time and effort.
---
Okay
---
I wish there was a *hug killer* emote ._.
---
New nurse be like...
---
It's very slight, you have to be staring right at her. Even if you can it essentially just removes one variable she can still be phasing but not moving or phasing ahead or phasing round
---
You said you are either god incarnate for winning so much or the killers power is boosted. My point is that plenty of players win without any add-ons or perks, across all killers/survivors, and even make it to rank 1. That doesn't = OP killer NERF pls BHVR.
---
Nice bait.
---
The official DBD discord is a cesspool.
---
If you have the perk to counter it then why are you complaining.. Noed is definitely not easy to counter and no I don't they can look for themselves, don't spread misinformation to try up your 'argument' its trashy.
---
I beg to differ that the game is more survivor sided than killer but I get wrecked as surv as well since I don't know how to loop :/
---
I dont know what that means dude
---
you already can know when the up/down vote below 90%
---
Watched otz yesterday, he closed the hatch with rancor and it didn‚Äôt proc on the obsession.
---
The double is added up on a different screen, normally the score can only reach 32k 8k for each of the 4 categories you can score under.
---
Solo survivors are pretty shit until high ranks. Survivors need a strong group not just one
---
Go with Ace, not because he is quiet but because he is hot
---
Holy shit, no way.
---
But yeah, she has a discord server full of guys, and they're all just air to her. She'd also make constant suggestive *jokes* when we would play, like telling us she'll go get water, moaning a bit and expecting a reaction. After a couple hours I told her to go fuck herself, and I think I still have the conversation somewhere.

P.s. Red ranks arent fun. So if you want to hit rank 1 survivor or killer prepare to get sweaty.

Right! Thats why I usually play SWF.  Its not like im always winning or always losing. The game just feels unbalanced in some ways. People are telling me im wrong and yada yada, but im not sure what makes their experiences so much more valid than my own. I keep trying to get new people to play but the learning curve is so steep, most my friends give me the side eye when i suggest we play. Idk. I was legit, jus sayin
---
If she isn't phasing, then don't walk away from the pallet?
---
Only start walking away when she starts to phase.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre definitely right. The way it was paced it sounds like a computer text to speech type thing, but obviously it isn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs a voice actor.
---
Known problem
---
They gave it away with PS+ so I bet a bunch of people are playing because they had one friend that played and he convinced them to try because it was free.
---
Art by me. I know Batman(The Batman Who Laughs) can‚Äôt join DBD but he could be a pretty cool killer character.
---
May I ask where you got the blueprint for the mask?
---
This feels like a scene from a movie. a true hero... :(

There‚Äôs a post like this one every other day, and people try to get a rise out of others like this for whatever reason, look up some tutorials or something once you learn the loops and what not you‚Äôll see why I say killer isn‚Äôt op
---
Growing pains. The game is very survivor tilted, there are just a lot of bad habbits that need to be broken.

I once had a trapper ignore every survivor in the game and hint me down. They then face camped me as soon as they caught me. I assumed it was because I was Jane and people hate certain characters. 
---
In the endgame they pointed out it was because my sexuality was on my profile and I "deserved it" and what I am is "disgusting". I reported them but I doubt anything got done about it tho.
---
It's amusing that the choice that Jake made here is the exact kind of choice that Kramer would spare you for and turn out to be the hidden solution. In Kramer's traps, it's doing the egotistical act that most consistently results in death. Mostly. If he feels like it.
---
insta-heals no longer exist (for better or worse), thats a thing
---
they're very rare now, most people just slug last 2 for the 4k
---
That's my understanding too. I never saw anything yesterday about a bloodhunt.
---
Google
---
What platform I haven‚Äôt really noticed anything different
---
Sure thing! Free plans here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2828079/makes
---
It should be 100% to a max of 50. That way instead of having to recover to full before getting half wiggle progress, you get half wiggle progress after half recovery but can't gain anymore
---
Double bloodpoints on Switch as well ;)
---
Dude, I felt like it was only me and one other person online at 4am PT. haha  I am rank 5 so maybe it was you. I just forgot the username. haha
---
I called it quits at 5am PT and fell asleep.
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs definitely telling you to throw the game, isn‚Äôt he? If players chilled like he‚Äôs suggesting everyone does, every player will get more bloodpoints and even the killer. Playing Prayer Beads, with Ruin and NOED definitely increases the chances of survivors disconnecting and decreases bloodpoint gain.
---
The ol‚Äô razzle dazzle
---
Funnily enough I‚Äôm actually a Fredward main, I just use the Myers flair because he‚Äôs the first killer I grinded to Rank 1 with, so he holds a special place in my heart
---
You gotta go with who you like the best-it‚Äôs how you‚Äôll have the most fun, I main Jane who is loud as fuck and you can hear her across the map when injured but god dammit she‚Äôs adorable and my favorite so I just deal.
---
Prestige 3 claudette. Basically they are supposedly good af at the game xD
---
It's taken me 3 or 4 machines to get it off the last like 5 times I've gotten it on my head.
---
As a Former Pig Main and Spirit Main now, I approve of this message.
---
#buffpigguy
---
quick question, have you ever played hag, cause this does not improve her map pressure at all and it would completely ruin her ability to down people
---
is there any way to get HD pic on the top? it looks pretty cool
---
Omg. No that is NOT my intention l. Omg damn its like not even that big a deal! And now some guy is harassing the shit out of me.
---
Congratulations but you missed the point.
---
Three days?  What the fuck.
---
His chest is a mouth now?
---
I get your point, but that many offerings don‚Äôt show up regularly. In fact it‚Äôs very unlikely to more than 2 map offerings. Also, some of those maps are strong for some killers. It depends on the killer/build and on how the survivors play. There is a lot of randomness involved in this game.
---
Fixed killer hitbox on stairs btw
---
just read the text or listen over again lol
---
Q and Q?
---
Honestly can‚Äôt wait. It‚Äôs going to do so much for match making
---
SORRY BUT IM GOING TO PRESTIGE WITH HUNTRESS I GOTTA USE THAT OP SHIT
---
Leatherface is the most vanilla killer that has not much going for him, how come nobody complains hes underpowered? Billy does what he does much better
---
Denying the flashlight save, let alone downing the other player in the process is always so satisfying.
---
Yeah I know but those stats are spirits with strong addons and spirits without addons, what if they nerf only her addons? Would she be OP statistically? What a I mean is i hope they dont nerf her mechanics.
---
I actually don‚Äôt praise the ones that put in very little effort to put something together. Not everyone deserve a cookie.
---
also if you think an addon is too powerful for the shape, SUGGEST A CHANGE TO THE ADDON, nerfing a base character cause of an addon makes absolutely no sense
---
Rank 8 or so
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt want to get into the toxicity of red ranks though.
---
Awww ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Just ignore him, this game can be very frustrating trust me so I understand why you posted this, you can also try playing killer for a bit to put your self in a killers mind, that can help you survive more.
---
On the flip side I almost got my Steve to p3 and the bloodied cloths are awesome
---
Am I the only one annoyed with the ghostface, legion and default survivor costumes? I could make them with what I have on my wardrobe
---
Yes, a friend showed me like 2 seconds after previous comment
---
This is a good step
---
&gt;status set: crazy
---
**jack torrence...**
---
I never cared about either. But 3 survivors escaping hatch with a gen left is a bit ridiculous. That's like a red mori.
---
They aren‚Äôt unplayable but they basically have no power outside of injuring. tracking is nice tho. I like to play em, especially with an ignore the obsession stbfl build, cus you can triple hit people if you want to waste time.
---
She soo pretty. Too bad she has the mind of a 8 year old.
---
If the sarcasm was as obvious as you are implying, why did you feel the need to edit out that line?
---
but keep one thing in mind is the optimization check in with people who have regular xbox ones if that what u have but If not i know from a one x perspective the game is smooth for both survivor and killer
---
I have every perk on my Feng but. I still run Q&amp;Q head on inner strength and rotating 4th perk for whatever Im feeling
---
It's like explaining color to a color blind person with NOED post. They can not understand that just do bones. The devs even gave a perk with a free heal state if you cleans and more bp for cleaning . I thought for sure that NOED was done. Nope. Still kicking and screaming about "why should I cleans though?" NOED is easily to counter and is just lazy not to do totems.  I don't like insta heals but that's because I like mid tier killers. Pig. GF and I luv trapper. Against a Spirt, Nurse or Billy instas are not a big deal but then i start playing as those killers then I read on Reddit. Spirt and Nurse OP please nerf.
---
Low rank: KILLER OP!
---
High rank: SURVIVOR OP!
---
Guess the mid ranks are the way to do.
---
Have you checked the rift page? You should open the battle pass menu in order to get the rewards
---
Same reason why MCote went out of his way to get Bill, a Valve owned character, on consoles. 
---
I mean on its own it seems weird for the devs to waste so much time and effort to add a FREE platform exclusive character when no profit is involved?
---
Unless of course Bill was an obstacle that prevented the success of a much larger goal like crossplay.
---
thanks for telling us the inches were the nine inches of the knife and not of something else.
---
Pantless Meyers is literally the best thing that has ever happened to this game... Objectively
---
I just had to make this meme, don't really care what ppl say. It's just I really hate this whole battlepass system which binds players to the game and makes them grind more. I'd be totally fine if it only was the archives for extra lore or some small bp rewards and achievements. 
---
I really thought Bhvr was different from other companies in that regard. Again sad to see the battlepass in this game.
---
I have a one x so that shouldn't be an issue
---
Nothing wrong with either.

I'm not saying it all stacks, I'm just saying that a blood hunt on top of all of it is a ton of bloodpoints.

No she just does it for fun :)

She does such an amazing job on everything she makes!

I would love to see some screenshots of this. Interesting af!

Watch vids &amp; streamers. Pay attention to their movements
---
I never facecamp. Except recently during the rift challenge with bubba. I feel dirty
---
Still kinda new to this game. I haven‚Äôt seen fixated before
---
I once had a spirit with prayer beads, amulet and ebony. I laughed hard when she did not get a 4k, me and a jake escaped
---
This... This is too wholesome ;_;
---
No it isn‚Äôt but it doesn‚Äôt change how we grew up. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad or boring movie but it doesn‚Äôt live to the hype anymore imo
---
People consider it a nerf because you cant just insta a downed survivor in the killers face anymore but other than that its functionally still the same
---
Fair enough
---
Servers are still enabled which probably means limited amount of available lobbies for people to join. Depending on the region devs might have added fewer slots.
---
Survivors do dc. I know thaaaat. But I havent seen it at this level on a killer since legion.
---
Can say the same to killers complaining about insta heal being too lazy to carry on chasing for one more hit.
---
Whichever skin you prefer
---
Yes, Question answered. And the hag will teleport facing the player and can easily land a hit if the hag in question was expecting a trap to be triggered. 
---
Additionally By definition it improves her map presence AND pressure. There is also an addon which increases the time her traps last once triggered in addition to her seeing where the survivor is running while not knowing where she actually is
---
It's off topic, but this comic gives me the vibe that tinky winky absorbed all the other teletubbies Agent Smith style and I don't know how I feel about it.
---
If you have calm Spirit when ur hooked the sacrifice process immediately begins. Normally it waits until after you‚Äôre done screaming

Did you read the challenges?

The definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over. Then expecting different results. *I don't do totems then I'm mad NOED killed me. Hold their hand and walk them through why and how they can counter NOED and you will still get but I don't want to do totems or why should I do totems. Lol fucking so many dipshits out there.
---
I just dislike when people say that 'downvoting proves my point'. I've known people who say stupid things and get downvoted, and then put that as a terrible attempt to look right, when they're still completely wrong. If you get downvoted super fast, its either because theres a good reason or trolls.
---
Clearly though, your comment is most likely right since youre now getting upvotes.
---
I wish I had every perk on her. I really miss my bond...

Laurie and Myers had a daughter

That‚Äôs good and all but when does og ghostface come out?

What are devs
---
They also said that they‚Äôll be sharing some updated stats soon.
---
He would indeed. Could have a chain power that has an extended reach. My favorite comic
---
Most people play survivor. For the game to function well, there has to be 4 survivors per killer. For the best queue times, queue as killer
---
This event is absolutely underwhelming and a spit into the community's face. They kept postponing and promising like they are going to change the world here and we ended up with a quickly mashed together 'event' and some shitty cosmetic grind feature that had to be taken down for fixing anyways.
---
It is known
---
lmfao
---
This is actually unbelievable good god
---
you don't have to work on them, I have gotten points while doing totems so ...
---
Honestly why the fuck are they delaying the bad killer buffs? I remember the King saying Doctor was next on the list after Nurse and instead now we hear ‚Äúnope next is Spirit and like Nurse it‚Äôs gimme be a nerf‚Äù
---
If we get to a point where Billy becomes the best killer in the game bc survivors DC against everyone else, I‚Äôm just gonna quit.
---
I miss the spaghetti legs killers got when the kicked and vaulted stuff like 2 years ago, I domt have any screenshots sadly but I'm sure some people remember what I'm talking about
---
Well, I apologise for assuming you were a killer main. You were just defending them so much for absolutely nothing which is usually the way one-side mains act. Nothing negative, they just usually don‚Äôt see things from the other perspective as well.
---
Even all the details on the hoodie check out
---
Noice
---
Lol wtf
---
Thx for the reply !

BHVR plz bring him in DBD! My favorite Batman comic was ‚ÄúDeath of the family‚Äù but now THIS Batman is my new fav. He‚Äôs so cool!

What platform are you on? I‚Äôm curious as to if it‚Äôs affecting everyone.

Thompson house, taking games hostages since 2016

Killers just post more because they spend all their time waiting for a lobby to pop up.
---
Devs: Dead by Daylight is a horror game
---
Also devs:
---
You can use the same hook many times but you only get the point bonus once
---
But if they're as bad at chases as i am, they still get dropped right after lmao
---
&gt;Her counterplay is luck
---
spirit summed up in a few words
---
She spent three days making sure it looked as accurate as possible.
---
Bring him in but instead of survivors he hunts 4 killers instead cause he is super bad.
---
They changed him a small bit with the update
---
Xbox
---
Obviously.
---
I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing THAT Huntress skin....
---
I mean, NOED is still in the game and insta-heals are gone so... xD
---
Deal with it buddy
---
Greta or the quote itself? Both were very viral recently
---
Im a killer main. Like pretty heavy maybe 70/30 and noed definitely needs to go. Its not about one side being harder to play than the other or anything like that its about getting rewarded for losing and about meaningful counterplay. If you are a killer and all the gens get done you lost. Im sorry but you failed your objective, finish your current chase and add that dude to your body count for the match but other than that its over. And JuSt Do BoNeS isnt meaningful counterplay to noed. If you got a notification at the start of the game that the killer has noed then maybe but it just isnt feasible to ask survivors to go out of their way to clean all the bones to play around a perk the killer may or may not have that is just absurd. Thats like if survs had a perk that said if you kill everyone before 3 gens are done everyone respawns and the exit gates are powered unless throughout the game you spend 3 minutes standing completely still. How absurd does that sound? Its the same thing, a reward for failing your objective with a ridiculous method of counterplay. So yea NOED needs to go.
---
This is exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. Like one of the comments here ‚ÄúMost people play survivor, killer should be less time‚Äù Killer takes fucking 10+ minutes at any rank for me. And the devs don‚Äôt address it. Such a large player base and the queue is insane.
---
I was playing on cold tower and the chase must‚Äôve lasted 5 seconds.. I run and leap through a window only to step on the trap instantly. The trapper just looked at me disappointedly.
---

That pipe is such a random cosmetic. To think it was funny seeing Billy hitting survivors with a Cow Leg.
---
I'm sorry, but's he's right and it's not dumb. yes, it's essentially the same result in getting the survivor downed in one hit. But, there's so many other factors in play when using his power. are they running  towards a loop you can't  chainsaw to. are the add ons you brought with you gonna help/hurt you.  Do you even have the time to rev your chainsaw. And from coming from experience, you can definitely juke a chainsaw. verses okay my noed popped i have a few seconds of insta down before it gets broke. and no lie it being a few seconds.
---
Awwwww i wanted to hear a big fucking metallic "WHOMP" when he hits someone
---
Oh you're right, my bad

You should finish reading his post before reply.

I don‚Äôt want to be mean to the devs or anything, but the reading doesn‚Äôt feel natural. There isn‚Äôt much pausing or feeling in my opinion.. or maybe I‚Äôm just a snob

I‚Äôm willing to bet pipe sounds are coming. They added sounds specific to Wraith‚Äôs chain braids cosmetic so it might have just been overlooked.
---
I‚Äôm ashamed off you if you‚Äôre with the blonde and play computer games /S
---
&gt;I just finished the first archive, and i can see that there is three more, so i was wondering, how do i start working on those?
---
It will be added early / mid November.

Hopefully same sound effect too.
---
Gotcha!
---
Is bloodhunt bugged or is Gruesome Gateau offering bugged? Because I was just in a game with 1 party streamer, 1 gruesome gateau and bloodhunt, but only got bloodpoint multiplier from 2 of those.
---
Alright, I can't talk with someone sub 60IQ, won't bother you again
---
yea the straws are so far away for you to be grasping em
---
This is a low rank killer. What do you expect?
---
it‚Äôs an bad perk but it‚Äôs requirement isn‚Äôt really stupid.
---
Quick games. A ton involved mori's w/ insta downs, DC's, a couple of those games went fast because my team would gen rush while the killer would tunnel and face camp me. Lots of variables, but its not impossible to get 14 games in 2 hours.
---
They posted the open dates of the archives in the update patch note.
---
Thanks
---
Nicely done! &lt;3
---
I think they said (but I'm not 100%) that the cosmetics from the rift will come to the store after a minimum of 6 months after the rift ends
---
Just give us a nudge-nudge, wink-wink "Anchorite" costume set for all the killers, BHVR...
---
I really hope it's not pennywise. No harshness to anyone who wants the guy but bleh

Just use small game or detectives if you‚Äôre really struggling. I managed to do 3 in one game last night

This happened to me yesterday, looped a Demogorgon for 5 min with the help of my green flashlight that I found in a chest and got facecamped for it. All while my team didn't complete any gens. F
---
Accurate af
---
Lucky. I rather go against tier 3 Myers rather than iridescent head Huntresses. Actually now looking back at it, I have only gotten 1 Myers from the start of the event to the time I am posting this comment.
---
I love Legion, they're low tier but they're fun and easy to play!
---
It‚Äôs a known issue
---
I am having zero issues with lobby times
---
Man that kinda sucks. Was really hoping they‚Äôd change it up like how you can hear Pigs drill when she swings.
---
Code name Sweden? So Nea really is a killer after all!
---
The Hag can only teleport back to her traps if survivors trigger them, she has some of the clearest counterplay in the game, CROUCH. If you unhook someone and then you both run away and trigger the traps, then you deserve to get hit, that‚Äôs not the Hag camping.
---
Get out of low rank then
---
The spookiest season deserves to have the Spooky Boi to shine
---
As a PS4 player im very excited to be able to play with Xbox players (and maybe switch players) in the future. It‚Äôll enriched the player base and the queues will be much better.
---
I see that‚Äôs your favorite reddit. Don‚Äôt try to throw your dirty habits on me coward.
---
Wow a grammar Nazi. Why I'm not surprised?
---
It matches with the gown outfit. In Halloween 4, he escapes the hospital and kills someone with the pipe. 
---
Obviously, they base it off the original, saying it‚Äôs from when he escapes the Sanitarium, but no doubt the pipe is coming (or inspired by) the kill from 4.
---
When Bill was announced for console I knew they were at least considering crossplay. I can‚Äôt wait!
---
Who would have thought. A slutty version of another halloween costume! Good stuff besides that.
---
Even before it.
---
Just wait till those mouse jukes hit and no one on console can hit or dodge versus PC moves. You think gg ez was bad before? Pfftt.
---
A seductive voice is my kind of shelter
---
He made his choice.
---
That was never a thing people hated Legion for. They didn't like Legion because once he decided he was going to down you, you were going down. It wasn't a matter of speed at all.
---
HE WAS NUMBER ONE
---
Xbox but I think it's a game issue and not platform specific
---
Well, most Rank 1 players cleanse totems, so NOED doesn't come into play. Insidious camping will make sure they de-pip, as many red rank players do not mess around and will simply do gens. He'd get two people maximum.
---
There is the problem of my gender though.  Specifically my beard. ._.  I don't want to have to shave just to play her, although it would be awesome to have her claw as a prosthetic, not going to lie.
---
Thanks !
---
Y‚Äôall love to complain about NOED but run Adrenaline
---
Nice that isn'T "just a typo". What kind of typo?  
---
\-3 Chests in a single trail?   
---
\-3 Chests from the basement in 3 seperate trials?  
---
\-3 Chests in general?  
---
As you see, it's not "just a typo" - This is just not funny anymore.
---
For going against. Freddy.                                                              For playing. Idk I don‚Äôt have Ghostfave
---
All the unhook challenges require them to be safe though.
---
Lol so it 68 days or so.
---
They're not wrong
---
I‚Äôm just saying. This is how that rank is. It‚Äôs full of players who play scummy on purpose and never get higher and people who don‚Äôt know what to do yet because of inexperience. You have to orient your gameplay toward doing shit to rank up rather than escaping.
---
That is even MORE sad.
---
God that foot though
---
Very well done. Ya got a heck of a wife and a heck of a you.
---
Sorry i mean the dumb bitch part, he says the exact words a lot and he loves trapper
---
Yeah I hold it down, select the challenge then when I get into a game lobby it says no challenge selected and I have to do it all over again now it's actually selected I'm not getting any progress.
---
"actually selected" as in finally registering I selected it when I'm in a pre game
---
I've been playing with rank 1 players and I barely see them cleaning totems
---
My flair once again comes in use
---
That made me smile I love that aspect of DBD when you find people willing to play along
---
Jane: ‚ÄúMoans‚Äù
---
Tbh, it looks like the Killer's map awareness big brained you even if it's a distasteful tactic to me, I wouldn't blame him for the dev's level design though. But, say that banister to the left of the doc was a vault, even with BL, does that seem too OP? I think the killer could easily go around the short side and down the stairs to resume chase if necessary, it would prevent situations like this imo.
---
All the Rank 1 players that I match with cleanse totems.
---
&gt;That is even MORE sad.
---
Sad? Would you rather not have it in your language at all?
---
The killer that tunnels most in my playtime is wraith
---
Wow i learn something new tx alote
---
buy Adam tbhüíñ
---
Naw
---
If you like stealth then Ghost Face. I like both of them but Ghost Face is one of my mains.
---
I used to think this too but I bought leatherface and played him he‚Äôs actually really hard and if you don‚Äôt make the right decisions with your chainsaw you‚Äôre fucked
---
r/cursedimages
---
Wym rank 1? Everyone is cleansing totems right now!
---
Not being in the map prob
---
All dead ... they don‚Äôt just know it yet
---
Oh my god, what was that! You'd think he was playing huntress with the distance on that.
---
18. Was 10 when I played a lot but have been degrading since.
---
I would rather have ppl translation it RIGHT, and ppl that actually show enough interest in this game. Srsly, the whole company and this game is just a joke.
---
Meh, some lower ranked Survivors do not know to cleanse them.
---
This man must be a time traveller.
---
Your talking about pre buff ghostface
---
Sloppy, nurses calling, coulraphobia (clown anti heal) , and discordance .
---
But here's the thing, it's better to try for an unsafe one then not get it at all.  (shouldn't be that way I'm just explaining what they're thinking)
---
People are stupid.
---
Queues for killers at rank 20-15 can be slow because survivors rank up much quicker once they understand the game. Legion is imo the worst killer in the game rn but you can still make it work. I‚Äôm not good at perk names in English but  STBFL, thrilling tremor, pop goes the whizle and Thanato would be a decent build at higher ranks. If you think you still need some practice and is at lower ranks, ruin, bbq, brutal force and spirit fury may be more effective.
---
Nice to see that skin on Jake - and nice that you payed and then support the devs
---
Freddy is stronger but Ghost is more fun imo
---
I quite like it. Feels fair as both a Survivor and a Killer.
---
Oof. That‚Äôs sucky. I haven‚Äôt had that issue but I have had the one where my dailies change on me constantly. Hopefully they figure this stuff out.
---
For me it's been that way forever. Just jam out for a bit or read while you wait
---
Now ... that might sting a bit
---
If only he was a "decent" killer.
---
Boobs
---
Why's yuri?
---
I wonder if maybe they are wanting to do a licensed one like from buffy or Dracula and are looking to obtain the rights?
---
The real question is why are the players toxic? Both roles are guilty of this.
---
Portuguese translation is full of typos too
---
Myers has always been Mid High.
---
Sabotaging, pallet drops, body blocking, flashlight saves when pick up. Not enough chances to save people? Flashlight saves are possible but they need skill, and I don't see why you need more ways to bully a killer anyway, they are weak enough already
---
I used clay. thank you :)‚ô°
---
I run this a lot. It‚Äôs surprisingly stronger than most people think. Give it a few games before making a judgement. It sounds very niche but I get it off most games.

survivors have been reading what the killer has been doing and adapted with every nerf that has been thrown at them. However, the moment the killers get one tiny little nerf....

Whats even the point of bringin a TOMBSTONE with a ebony
---
Once AGAIN it's not that. Lolololol, jesus do I need to post the message. He literally said he doesn't pay attention to the killer ones, he did this for a daily.
---
Am i? I feel like I've just burnt a newborn that belonged to a mother of two miscarried children
---
I haven‚Äôt been on since the update but are people glitching this or something? The levels seem absurd.
---
That's what I wanna know lololol. I ask and he said he wanted to make sure he got his daily. Like um, a daily is one kill. Haha.
---
Its some sort of bug. I played a game and its now normal. No clue why it happened.
---
I hope so. I put in a ticket yesterday, so we'll see I guess.
---
&gt; holy heck what the hell do I do
---
play dbd
---
We already failed No Nut November before it even started thanks to him
---
Feel bad why? Those rank 19 claudettes will be in the corner attempting to self care for the entire match, 0 gens will be done and you'll die on first hook.
---
As I said originally, this is just a rough representation of where killers fall. I don‚Äôt feel very strongly about most of these killers. Michael has always been very mediocre in my experience. He only shines when survivors aren‚Äôt very good. But that‚Äôs just my experience with him.
---
Let‚Äôs agree to disagree
---
Downvote me all you want but im afraid they see her as a way too strong killer which isnt that true tbh, i remember legion nerf hammer when they were annoying and ofc was necessary but the mechanic and playstylw just isnt the same, i hope sonething similar doesnt happen to spirit.
---
There isn‚Äôt any point in installing it. Maybe besides doing the archives
---
&gt;Playing killer. What is going on ? On PC
---
Two events happening at the same time. Killer population increased.

Drop the single trial subtext and some of these become doable. Shame BHVR doesn't actually play their game, otherwise they'd understand all they are doing is contributing to either encouraging people to farm or just outright not even trying to complete the archives.
---
I feel Michaels high mid. And leatherface is more low mid or mid. But we can agree to disagree.
---
I wouldn't think Furtive Chase is *that* bad... (though, I despise losing all my stacks because the obsession kills themselves rather than losing my stacks because I didn't manage my hooks correctly)

Ok... well coming back tomorrow then

Players from rank 20 to 16 aren't affected by matchmaking. You can end up playing against any ranks.

Right so my 28 days of good ol American grinching begins... I‚Äôm gonna need a pilgrim outfit on clown

Well, I guess I'm not completing them then.

The person on twitter who posted it did mate. I thought the same
---
It's dbd, there is always issues
---
That skin glitched on me last night and it looked like my Myers was wearing a mini dress lol
---
Your goal as Myers has always been to get out of Tier 1 ASAP. If you ran Monitor before the change you  should still run it now. Only difference is you don‚Äôt need it with scratched mirror builds
---
A little skin goes a LONG way ;)
---
Not that I don't believe everyone on the internet with everything they say, but can I get a second person to confirm this one?

If it doesnt count as a protection hit just repeat the chorus one more time

Gotta tell the demogorgon you fucked up
---
I like it. I'm not listening to an audio book, I don't want to just stand there and wait for him to finish talking even though I was done reading the paragraph 30 seconds ago. It's a hell of a lot better than not having one that's for sure.
---
This. You're better off playing solo survivor than with the toxic morons in the dbd disc.
---
Yea i'm getting this too
---
this except for when i know im about to prestige or dump into a new character i wanted to play when i was new. Like i saved up 600k for the presumed haloween sale on ghostface so i could buy and play him with actually good perks
---
So we're getting the iconic movie characters legion in DBD, wonder how they'll play.
---
This is a great idea!
---
I... I can't this is too much
---
time to draw him doing the marilyn monroe skirt thing
---
this is a TRUE bro!
---
Hmm, that's a nice idea actually but I think that it should be an addon and not normally. Sort of like a tracer round addon I'm thinking.
---
I tried to minimize the survivor interaction as much as possible, but with some killers' powers and perks i just couldn't come up with a way to put the onus completley on the killer for the achievement. It's the same with the hag's traps, the survivors have to trigger them and they could counter it as well, or like with Myers if the survivors let the obsession die on the hook, it's over. 
---
I'd also love to come up with challenges based on the character's behavior in lore, for instance with the Pig, use a mori on someone who removed a RBT within the last 60 seconds, stuff like that!
---
Until devs fix it, this will happen to every single player that completes their level 1 tome. 
---
Not surprisingly, this has been posted already:

---
I'd totally play as Ghost Face, and have a tea bagging party with all five of the survivors.  Then I would Mori Bill, and have everyone else photo bomb the picture, post it on here, and see how long it takes everyone to notice.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty viable strat in the end game and this specific situation. What if the killer left looking for the other survivor, possibly not finding him. Then the remaining survivor gets the unhook and the heal on the downed one, assuming they don‚Äôt have unbreakable.  
---
Then the healthy survivor can block the killer for her to take a hit and they get a 3 man escape.  
---
I don‚Äôt agree with facecamping, but you don‚Äôt want to know how often I‚Äôve left the hook, because I feel the need to be a ‚Äúnice‚Äù killer only for the unhook to happen 1 nanosecond after I leave resulting in me getting bodyblocked.
---
YES!! I AM!
---
Oh I wasn't sure if it had been seen. thanks for enlightening me
---
Until like a week ago I had never used a mori or addon above yellow quality. "What if I *need* it later?" 
---
Started making it rain with Tombstones and Tufts of Hair because I hit 50 on Myers and want to prestige him, but don't want all my shit to just get wasted.
---
Thompson house is surrounded by 4 safe pallets that can be looped multiple times and connect to each other and other jungle gyms. The map is also extremely big which makes it hard for most killers to apply pressure. 
---
It has nothing to do with corn.
---
I'm not high rank or anything, but I have noticed there's not a lot of Pigs for the past month or so. Really sucks imo. She's like one of my favourites. Can anyone explain what's up with her?
---
just let people play what they want and be nice, it really isn‚Äôt all that hard
---
no in almost any scenario its better to be off the hook, even if you get farmed for it the other person got points for it. If you don't get off the hook you just got the other guy downed for free and now there is 2 people on the hook instead of just 1. If you get farmed then its just unlucky
---
Dude you sound like a child. Stop being salty and chill out.
---
Yay, killers a just pouring the moris in every match now.
---
&gt;When is that classic ghost face skin coming out? Is it already out?
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt have access to my PC so I can‚Äôt play for a while but I absolutely love that skin and can‚Äôt wait to see it.
---
Any Wednesday from now until you see it in-game.
---
So he gets in his Toyota Corolla and mows down all the survivors? This is the update I‚Äôve been waiting for.
---
i left my wraith at level 30 just because his perks are shit
---
Me or him?, lol.
---
I wish it was 100% but sadly it isn't. There's not only BHVR and Kyle Gallher but also license holders, legal issues and money stuff involved. All the shit that makes licensed characters so hard to deal with.
---
I'm not saying you are completely wrong and in the end of the day I hope it all works out, but we can't be totally sure it will.
---
Thank you! And I know there‚Äôs a bug with the achievement stats on steam right now, but the hatch achievement was released with the stranger things chapter so it having .2 completion isn‚Äôt too out of the picture
---
If the leaks are right it‚Äôs coming out on the 13th
---
Decisive light definetly will take some time to do, flahlights are fickle and killers got used to facing walls when picking up people when possible.
---
Why only 3 days that not long enough
---
It is possible. It‚Äôs just easy for a killer to simply look away while walking. If you could just blind them by shining it on their head and not their eyes then it‚Äôd be completely broken.
---
About 2 weeks from now
---
Go try out prayer beads spirit. You‚Äôll get the same lack of sympathy from me.
---
Steve is the best acapella singer in DbD
---
yeah they are deployed and it's like playing a shooter, missing all shots and still getting headshots. best time ever for 5 inches killer mains
---
You added in Jason but not leatherface, arguably the goodest boy here. I feel offended. 
---
Have a downvote
---
SWF teams stacking instaheals are a real issue. It is very easy for them to pile on and heal a friend that just got downed, and it synergizes way too well with Decisive Strike. The unhooked person bodyblocks for someone else, triggers Borrowed Time, then takes another hit further down the line, goes down, you leave them slugged to wait out the DS timer and guess what: their SWF runs by, quickly jabs a needle in their ass and they're back up on their feet at full health. That's a lot of the killer's work instantly and easily negated. In some maps and against skilled survivors, you just don't have that kind of time.
---
I am of the opinion that killers also have some very bullshit addons and/or offerings. Prayer Beads shouldn't exist. Iridescent Head's existence offends all my sensibilities. Ebony Moris need more limitations. All these things throw the game balance out the window. But, of all things, OP is comparing instaheals to NOED? False equivalence my good dude. Pre-nerf instaheals exist in a realm of bullshit completely separate from NOED.
---
wait
---
but...I only had 2.6k before Ruin
---
I THOUGHT I WAS SAFE FOR A FEW WEEKS AT LEAST COME ON
---
Indeed thank you for noticing.
---
Nope, no lag on other games, 25 mb/ps download speed.
---
some people completed everything last night, if you have the correct perks you can get challenges done in one game
---
Unsafe unhooks should deduct one instead. If you're at 0 it stays at 0 but if you have 3 and do an unsafe you go back to 2
---
Funny regardless of how mean it is
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but you‚Äôre wrong and it is dumb. It‚Äôs a huge waste of a perk slot. Also you‚Äôve forgotten NOED activates at the end of the game, when pallets are basically gone for the most part and there‚Äôs lots of dead zones. It cripples the user when they could have had a better perk to generate more pressure during the match, to the point where they might not even be in an uphill situation having to use NOED in the first place.
---
This meme is referencing a thread that was making the connection between the ‚ÄòSweden‚Äô code name datamine of the next killer and Pennywise. 
---
The speculation has been teases by the devs. None of its been debunked. How could you debunk the DBD art director posting a Pennywise drawing or MCote laughing nervously when asked about Pennywise in an interview?
---
I don't advise you go barefoot to a convention tho
---
We have 2 months, the rift stays open way after the Halloween event is finished
---
I'm rank 8 and I've faced two rank 15+ killers back to back. I'm a solo queue survivor.
---
Looks like I'm about to ~~break the law~~ hide in a locker
---
Stupid  dog, you got me hooked in the basement!
---
Ignore him/her/them.  Long story short Nurse was reworked to require a timer for each blink in order to recharge them and people think she's garbage now.  This is despite there being plenty of players who still make Nurse S-Tier, and add-ons that bridge the gap in her difficulty, like the one blink add-on that makes her no longer the slowest killer in the game.
---
This isn't much of a counter, if you see the glass light up it's just "hahaha prepare to die loser, get Gud" it's a counter to a single mind game but does not solve the main issue with her
---
its worthwhile for the first survivor escaping to wait and force a hit because it reveals to the rest if the killer has NOED.
---
Likewise, having the killer walk up and hit you can be worthwhile because it buys others more time to escape.
---
However if you‚Äôre the last survivors then yeah you only stay because you want the killer to see you escape. Thats pretty lame.
---
Awesome and fun video!
---
A dangerous game of roulette.
---
I have no idea what they could give him, he doesnt have advantages against pallet looping, window looping or any chase abilities.
---
I think a mechanic where he needs to rev the saw multiple times to have a timer based evil within 3 type insta down saw mode could be cool, make it break pallets fast during that mode.
---
I want to bitch and moan about dedicated servers as a Survivor main, but I bet the BS is equally distributed between both sides (';
---
My tryhard skin for her is the noble robes
---
I‚Äôm curious, why don‚Äôt you have the game if you‚Äôre on the sub? You‚Äôre not sure whether you‚Äôre gonna like it?
---
No, Pig is terrible because of her terrible power that's literally useless after last generator pop, and she has nothing to help her in chase besides certain loops with her crouch ability.
---
  She has basically a worse billy loop cancel that is easier to do, only works certain loops (just like Billy's Curve) but it's pay off it worse.
---
    Pig is by far the worse stealth killer imo, at least Wraith's ability you can use the entire game, and doesn't rely on RNG.
---
 I could go on but what I'm saying is perks that give off your location are not of pigs concern at all, crouch lowers your moment speed and terror radious, therefore you will have no map pressure and gens will be popped quickly. Big needs a real buff, and this "buff" as stated by previous users isn't unique to Pig. All other killers have this buff.
---
They did. Maybe try reading the devs notes?
---
david could have opened an exit gate and let y'all die from the end game timer
---
They need the rights to it. I'd buy it the same day it came out if they did though.
---
Where the hell is our cursed/blessed timeline with OP Pig that can move at 115% in ambush mode?
---
To me, it's like For Honour: it's a very interesting game to watch other people play, but I have no real desire to play it myself.
---
When did you stop playing? Before Gf?
---
This is the majority of Ghostface players. Give people a killer with no terror radius and what do you expect to happen.
---
Goodbye.

That was absolutely fucked

Yeah I had that idea but she unfortunately only had a couple days to do this.
---
Much thanks!
---
She‚Äôs so happy!
---
This is exactly what I do. I'll stay and wait to buy other people time, but if I'm the last one left I'll just go. I never bm or teabag, it's simply a strategic play to help my team.
---
She‚Äôs really proud of what she did.
---
Or maybe their numbers are skewed because she‚Äôs the only viable rank 1 killer that‚Äôs easy to use and can stand up to SWF? I really hate these arguments. Dbd is so flawed in so many ways, and would require a complete gameplay overhaul to actually be close to balanced. SWF vs. solo is like playing two different games. The solution is so simple yet they‚Äôve never even acknowledged it: add voice comms, buff the shit out of every killer. That‚Äôs all that needs to happen, yet they continue to be a mess of a studio while we sit here and argue about nonsense.
---
I think NOED should be alterred in a way to let survivors know when they no longer need to worry about it. Similar to a hex totem being cleansed.
---
But
---
"ReWaRd FoR fAiLiNg" does not apply. The dev's intended vision for the game is 2 dead/ 2 alive. This can only be acheived with a Key or by powering all gens.
---
Yes, technically they did fail the obj, but it'd be like asking someone to run a 5 minute mile. You know damn well most people can't do it and will fail. 
---
The survivors obj is to not be hooked. But 999/1000, they are going to fail. Dead hard rewards you for "failing" to juke the killer, but that doesn't matter. *the odds are stacked against you*.
---
I think walking backwards probably scares people if they dont know if you have noed but if they do then ya they're just there to tbag, I agree with you though if everyone is safe just leave
---
iconic
---
I need a mask tutorial so fucking bad lmao
---
I get the feeling. Well, have fun lurking! Don‚Äôt hesitate to HMU if you ever wanna try it out.
---
My last 4 attempts for 4ks app have been denied due to DCs. It feels pretty shitty and they need to count a DC as a sacrifice. Inversely, if a killer DCs you should get escape points along with a handful of points on the other categories.
---
The killer that doesn't wait the minute when she clearly should deserved the punishment of ds 1
---
Holestly while flashlights are unpleasant for killers, you shouldn't automatically equal it's users to toxic salty players. Sometimes your strategy doesn't either as killer or as survivor. Not everyone DC straight after that, it takes a special mindset which can be related to using a flashlight but not directly for sure.
---
I'm babbling of course, but when you unfoundedly accuse people you do an input to the toxic atmosphere yourself.
---
Thanks for the offer, I'll keep that in mind.
---
wait. this is actually real?
---
I dont think John ever wavered on that philosophy. It was Amanda and Hoffman who just wanted to kill people.
---
How many months ago was this clip? 9 or 10? There's not even Devotion levels
---
His reveal mechanic is completely busted and makes playing against him feel unfair and frustrating.
---
They probably tried hard to break you out, didn‚Äôt even have the reveal start, got frustrated and left.
---
This exact thing happened to me. I messaged them and told them to just do gens. They could have the win. I don‚Äôt care. They said ‚Äúno‚Äù. They simply refused to play the game properly. Survivors are way more toxic than killers but still, this move that OP posted is diabolical.
---
Additionally, if you're playing on a newer television, you might want to check if it's set to game mode. I dunno if that helps much, but maybe it will help with the visual delay.
---
And how do you know that guy would do it? 
---
It‚Äôs like saying every Mexican works at the cartel or every black person is a gangster or every whit person is a racist lol.
---
I love doing this, but tbh I have fell for before also.
---
It was probably fine from his screen
---
Making walls transparent and other such cheats was what I was trying to refer to as game files.
---
I wish Halloween was more of a thing in my country. Enjoy your games!
---
Feral frenzy would be 2 seconds maybe oneü•¥üòÇ
---
Alot of people are also plaything this with their friends and if you pick the wrong killer your going to have a bad time
---
Hilarious. üôÑ
---
I didn't forget that it happens at end game. I thought we would all know that. That's why i didn't mention it. and  trust me, you don't always run out of pallets. There are plenty of games where it's end game and they still have quite a few pallets left to use if need be. and you must of forgot about windows and lithe huh, or lockers, head on, and quick and quiet. which are all perks that can be used to get to a pallet or the exit gate. And I'm sorry, Billy already has plenty of pressure on his own. And how is it crippling if it isn't and uphill situation. If you manage to get even a 3k without noed active, then you didn't even need a 4th perk. It's all situational. But noed is one of the few perks that can turn a match around that IS an uphill situation. Just because there's a chance a perk can't be used isn't gonna stop a killer from running it. suvivors sometimes don't get a chance to use ds or adrenaline. doesn't stop them from running it does it? those are perks that could of been replaced with something else couldn't they? You see my logic here?
---
Getting too many dcs after the bloodhunt started.Hate the devs even more now lol.
---
Yeah i can tellüòÇ
---
I mean, I don't want to make excuses, and I don't want to be like "ACTUALLY IT'S THE KILLER'S FAULT" but I usually walk forward as the killer swings to ensure I still escape, cos the amount of times I've given a free hit, fucked up the distance, and the killer's picked me up and killed me, just means I can't trust them.
---
The few times I do make the killer whiff it's cos I WAS gonna give them a free hit but mistimed my running.
---
Can't excuse people who wait and don't even give them a chance, though.
---
Just one more thing anything on the forums mentioning pennywise and the code name it‚Äôs deleted
---
It's usually a week
---
Yep, Spine Chill definitely catches him in Tier 1 now.
---
https://youtu.be/m0dXWlnEoAU
---
Lmao Completely repair 4 gens yourself Wow Some of these are BS or surely will be changed
---
Suck it up butter cup, most swfs suck anyways. I hate killers that Dodge if they see a swf, like actually get better at the game instead of cheesing you're way to rank one.
---
I think there is actually a problem with save file corruption on behaviour's end that is affecting queue times.
---
I have over 1200 hours play time. My killer is rank 17 and finding a match takes me about seven minutes give or take a minute.
---
My brother has just over 60 hours playtime.  His killer rank is 17, and he takes between 20 and 30 seconds to find a match.
---
We use the same pc,  have the same game installation, and are set to the same region. I expect that either corrupted save files that 'used to' cause data loss are now just causing really long matchmaking,  or behaviour is giving preferential matchmaking to some players for unknown reasons.
---
That isn't how they should work. 
---
Egc should start at the last gen done, with that kind of change.
---
Yep. This knowledge only works on super-safe pallets, where there are no high walls. (Loops like the pallets behind Thompson house).
---
Other than that, goodluck guys.
---
The survivor‚Äôs objective is to survive but completing 5 generators then opening an exit gate. Yes they have a lot of crutches like dead hard that i agree are unfair however none give such a lopsided swing like NOED does. And most of the time its just moot like if you didnt get many hooks then 4k at the end because of noed you still will most likely depip or safety the only difference is now the survivors also depip or black pip so it just spoils the whole game, both sides lose.
---
You don't HAVE to listen to it.
---
I can't tell if basketbomber is acting like Borat in not understanding something and trolling you. Or really is just lacking personality.
---
Nah, I'm fine.

"one of these is not like the others" Looking at you Billy
---
Dont be afraid to share your works with your friends by interests. I am sure we will like your costume &lt;3
---
Unpopular opinion. Most people who tbag at the start of the game are easy kills. Tbag them back
---
It's undoubtedly implied. Especially considering the overall tone of your message to begin with. "If you don't want a mori then don't bring an item." 
---
Ok then, I still don't bring an item in  but cheesy ass noobs tunnel right off the hook to use the mori anyways. Especially more so someone who has a daily with a killer they never actually use. You will get tunneled to death no matter how many hits other people take for you. Half the time the killer won't even bother hitting the rest until the dude that just got off the hook gets moried. And all for what? A green key with aura reading addons? Cool story bro. You ain't fooling anyone. 
---
You're a petty ass bitch and that's all there is to it.
---
This post literally needs to get on the front page.
---
-20,000 BP, I‚Äôm in debt
---
I get your point but I have no idea what walking backwards has to do with it
---
aaand you can go back to the closet where you came from. Cheers :)
---
They seriously need to change the fact that you lose Second Wind if you get downed. You wasted time healing someone and getting hooked, if the killer is tunneling you, Second Wind is completely useless.
---
Evil Within 4: The Shape begins to breakdance towards the survivors
---
I like to run calm spirit to let the killer know the TE R R I B L E violence that is happening
---
I would be impressed if he lost
---
So cute!!!
---
What about Legion mains?!
---
I've played pig for a long while when she wasn't a totally joke. 
---
&gt;How much have you played pig or even killer at all? The movement slow isn't that big of a deal, you can still cover areas as big as any other killer almost as easily.
---
I truely wonder how much you have played Pig because not only is that not true, your walk speed decreases quite severely and its apperant, real Pig mains know her Crouch ability is used an form of loop cancel and or to counter Borrowed Time.
---
Hitboxes are fine
---
It's just latency
---
Dedicated servers will fix them
---
And other myths you can tell yourself
---
does anyone know if the kill all survivors in one trial for the archives is a mori or just a sacrifice?

Go play Leatherface then. Level him until he has full perks and do as you wish with him.

Only time I ever face camped was because it was the last guy on his first hook, didn't want to risk him yeehawing away.

So, I‚Äôve dc a substantial amount of times, yet nothing has happened. The one that needs to grow up is you, if you don‚Äôt want to do something you shouldn‚Äôt feel like you need to, or worry about what others think of you for doing it. People like you saying it‚Äôs against code or whatever is your opinion, but someone can leave a game if they please. I promise you they will never enforce it to an extent, business reasons.

---
okay, thank you
---
Escaping isn't necessarily a win, unless that's your goal. Pissing off the killer is a win. Looping him for four gens is a win. Getting five safe unhooks is a win. Breaking every totem on the map is a win. Sabotaging hooks near a chase is a win, and so on and on and on.

Of course, I get extremely mad when I get NOED'd or tunneled to death, so.

I have both and Freddy is more fun to me. I love the mind games you can do. Fake teleporting to gems... and god nothing feels better than seeing a cocky survivor try to loop a fake pallet. You‚Äôve won that chase and they have no idea. It‚Äôs amazing lol. 
---
But to be fair I don‚Äôt really enjoy stalk mechanics. I don‚Äôt play Myers or ghost anymore. Especially since you can get knocked out of it on ghost and then you‚Äôre just a m1 killer with no power.
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúwhy am I not surprised‚Äù lol oof
---
Haha, great pic
---
Letting the last person escape out of hatch isn't fun
---
Stop spying on me, you memeing son of a bitch
---
I like the drip effect
---
Just get better at killer
---
Then she's running Stridor, and she never loses you. GG
---
Before anyone says anything, I do play both sides. I just prefer survivor because I find it more fun to *be* chased than to do the chasing. 
---
When you slug you are literally stopping this person from playing the game. You wanna tunnel, proxy camp, camp your totems, fine. But if you‚Äôre gonna kill me, just fucking kill me. Just laying in the ground while the rest of team is off doing God-knows-what isn‚Äôt fun.
---
I did! But it was covered by jeans and shoes, because closed toe shoes are required at the axe place.
---
Prob is ultra rare are not close to rare, imo they shoulf reduce the odds for ultra rares in the bloodweb
---
I completely agree and hope this gets met with good reception. Every time I say Spirit is blatantly overpowered and has very very little, if any very situational counterplay I get met with downvoted and getting accused of being an entitled survivor main (which I am but my opinion matters too)
---
I‚Äôll shout out Fungoose. A educational dbd streamer that I think everyone should watch. 
---
If that doesn‚Äôt peak your interests he has about I think it‚Äôs 7k hours into the game plays both killer and survivor. 
---
He usually 4ks as a killer and when he has his killer to P3 he plays with no addons.
---
Trapper still doesn't have his bear traps  :(
---
I personally enjoy ghost face's play style alot more. Nothing funnier then seeing them react when the stalk meter fills up.
---
I'm just annoyed that I can't get insta ques on killer, so I'm finishing all the survivor stuff first lol
---
Im not saying you should let the last survivor escape, that‚Äôs a different situation. But when you have two people slugged on the ground and you‚Äôre just running back and forth between their bodies, that‚Äôs not fun for anyone involved. The killer loses the ability to gain chase points and the survivors on the ground are literally unable to do anything but wait for themselves to bleed out.
---
Hey, yeah my other online games work fine and I checked my ps plus which is still good, I eventually managed to connect after just trying and trying, I think you're probably right about the servers just being too overloaded, thanks for the help!
---
You kinda can, like if I am just fucking around I can use insidious to sneak into their range and just kinda hang out and then make them crap their pants. But it's not helpful or good or reasonably doable.
---
...and add the timer reduction add-on back.
---
When the event gets over,you wont be able to get more serum and what,you think the event is gonna last 70 days ? Lol

Like what the fuck is this shit, did they break it in the latest update or something
---
And possibly make the new Rule Set No.2 do something like injuring a survivor if they fully search the wrong box.

Whats NOED'd?

Yeah,it was supposed to look like that fanart!

Overwatch truly is the most toxic game on the internet.

Accurate representation of DbD's quality throughout the years

I've heard this a few times and never really seen it in action, I guess I never knew where to look, because now I know to look at her thighs lmfao, at least on base skin or people running prestige. 
---
I think the large ones on her shoulder could be brightened a little, but that's me
---
Oh man, good luck. It's difficult when people are all fighting to get the unhooks. Should I tag as spoilers though?
---
What is slugging
---
Idk League is kinda worse but Overwatch can be pretty bad
---
Check the streamer or are you afraid to be wrong? and btw, You don't loop ANYONE at red ranks for 5 gens. Stop lying to yourself,  you are at green ranks, you have never seen reds
---
Sucks to suck
---
Halloween costumes shouldn't be about boobs. That's why mine are well tucked away. I'm not trying to be a sexy boob Myers.

Everyone‚Äôs opinions is relevant!

Nicely done!

I have the "what if i need it later mentality" also but then i think how the hell am i gonna know when i need it lol.
---
her new hair is soo much better, and it has physics, mean while this one looks so poorly modeled it's like they didn't even bother to try and make it somewhat decent
---
Leaving people on the ground instead of hooking them
---
I don't see a flashlight in that hand to justify a face camp...
---
No, as long as you don‚Äôt say what it actually is, it should be okay
---
Nah when spirit is at a pallet if you look at her the shards around her glow when she uses her power. Pay close attention
---
10/10
---
That‚Äôs not that bad. I rather be left on the ground so I can crawl to a new part of the map.
---
now i know where huntress hides her axes
---
As I was reading this post I entered a lobby with 3 claudettes and you inspired me to switch to claudette too üòÇ
---
No mither counters slugging
---
Depends on the type of slugging. 
---
Like for example if you slug someone because someone‚Äôs around or you know someone‚Äôs around is fine. Basically strategic slugging. 
---
But I believe you mean the Slugging where one survivor is down the whole match.
---
Do you even know what a vacuum pallet is?
---
big f
---
Alright, sweet
---
No One Escapes Death. It's a totem perk that turns a random "dull" totem into a "bright" totem, and enables the killer to one-shot survivors. This perk activates when the Exit Gates are powered.
---
The only way to stop it from triggering is to cleanse every single totem on the map (depending).
---
It doesn't go through perks like Borrowed Time, Mettle of Man, or other things that prevent the dying state when hit. At least, not as far as I know.
---
It's just a huge pain in the arse and a bit of a crutch for bad killers, while making skilled killers even more overwhelming. Since I've yet to ve matched with anyone who knows every single totem spawn on every map, I've never seen NOED be prevented, and even running Small Game 3 I still can't find every one of 'em myself.
---
I mean it takes quite the trained eye to spot a claudette
---
These are awesome! Do you have a recipe on how you made them?
---
The killer ones don't seem that bad, but a lot of the survivor ones could definitely go with having in a single trial removed 
---
Like completely repairing four generators in a single trial with dark sense
---
&gt;When the event gets over,you wont be able to get more serum and what,you think the event is gonna last 70 days ? Lol
---
The Serum will remain in the rift until it ends, in 70 days...
---
I did that last night, but holy shit they do not make that process painless. In my opinion anyways.
---
Yes let‚Äôs drag race into this totally serious conversation
---
yeah, that's not always an option though is it? why waist my time chasing a full health survivor, instead of going for the easier kill.  what if it's endgame? what if it's the last survivor and you have no kills? what if the survivors been a douchecanoe tbaggging, clicking flashlights and has object of obsession and you want them dead? by all means, tell me why I shouldn't go for the easier kill if i think i can get someone out of the game faster. Beside the obvious "tunnelings not fair for the survivor and toxic" cause if your close to death, or a teammate farmed you infront of me. I'm not gonna show any mercy if i don't feel like it. I'm not on your team so why would i help you get away?
---
3 days...? That‚Äôs all we get??
---
What the fuck.
---
Typical "Wah, killers should stand in the corner and weep while I do gens" post. Grow up
---
I‚Äôm just using an example even a fool couldn‚Äôt even deny.
---
Is it on badham? I always assumed it was just one of Nancy‚Äôs sketches.
---
That's awesome! Well done! Happy Halloween!
---
Like 400k idk what to level.
---
What? I looked at the challenge, isn't that enough?? Lol feels bad man, I did this too with the "hook 8 survivors" task. Got a 4k and it wasn't activated. 
---
Thankfully I got another 4k next match.
---
He's being a salty troll, but he's right. Once endgame has started, things change. It's now viable to chill near a hook to guarantee that kill, especially if one is down right next to it. He had two secured kills for sure, all he had to do was not leave.
---
This is awesome, I wanted to be Leatherface but I couldn't find the right mask. Or a cool chainsaw like that. So I became a 6ft tall female Myers.
---
They removed that years ago and i also could have looked that on google. Do you know what intellectual honesty is? 
---
You are not at red ranks, you are nooooooot lol, why do people lie so much in this sub? every time there is discussion, it comes out i'm arguing with green ranks that pretend to be red ranks without knowing shit about killers
---
I didnt think I could get more erect on my weekend off
---
Can you agree with me the only thing that needs nerfed about spirit is her beads
---
oots√§ tos emmiepie oots√§ tos emmiepie
---
I mean a survivor mistake can easily mean you ever even had a chance to play the game at all in the first place, whereas killers tend to need multiple mistakes to really be prevented from winning, and there is nothing that can happen to prevent them from playing the game at all (ignoring swf on comms who don't let the killer find them).
---
Uh, slugging is done too slow the game down to give the killer a better chance of winning. If you're slugged, that's 1 person not doing gens already. Somebody is going to come save you, that's another person off gens, if the killer can find that person too then it can really be the turning point of the game. Killers don't slug because they want you too bleed out slowly and not have fun, they do it because it's strategical. If you hate that, that's fine, but it's still pretty childish.
---
Now hum.
---
Lmao! Bubba got skittish.
---
Slugging is strategically the right decision if you‚Äôre playing to win in some circumstances. If your game fun is so badly ruined by being slugged there is a perk for that.
---
How could you run from that bait?
---
Funniest shit I‚Äôve seen all day
---
Since when the entity is this cute.... something is not right.
---
A lil pipe jab for those exposed survivors.
---
Slugging to bait a flashlight is fine, but other then that, Slugging is absolutely terrible. YOU'RE the one who needs to grow up
---
all bloodhunts last long like that, at least if I remember it correctly
---
Lololol ok ok i have definitely had that happen to me. I mean, i have had a lot of things id consider "cheap" happen to me, but ive also won by escapeing in some pretty cheap ways. Id say the only thing that REALLLY bothers me is when people hook ya and then stay there.....OR my personal favorite, being unhooked on my second hooking right in front of the killer just to be cut down and killed. Ruin is annoying but theres a weird satisfaction from finding and destroying. Honestly i apologize if my poat came off as baiting or whatever, it really wasnt my intention like at all. I just started playing not long ago and thought reddit would be a good place to talk about it. After all the feedback i was thinking of not even playing it anymore because idk man ppl keep messaging me on psn and thats like a first for me and not something i wanna deal with. But i genuinely like it and after talking to ( some ) individuals im thinking maybe im just better at being the killer than being the survivor.
---
&gt;why waist my time chasing a full health survivor, instead of going for the easier kill.
---
So you‚Äôd rather wait 60 seconds in front of locker in fear of DS and allow gens to be worked on instead of chase another survivor or apply map pressure?
---
as I said in (), the perk icon will light up
---
People wait to make you walk to the exit so that the other survivors get a bit more time.
---
Oh, you didn't? What did you think walking backwards meant then?
---
Except killers can close the hatch, so Slugging the 3rd person is an absolutely shitty tactic only tryhard assholes do
---
Except for when they don't
---
I earned 1000000 but I spent them on my new killer - Ghostface. Now I'm going to spend all my BPs on Michael and Freddy
---
Way to kill the immersion sheesh. Glad I play killer and not survivor. I don't pull this type of shit I just talk shit in the end game lobby then dip LOL I don't ruin the fun
---
Looks great but call me old fashion I love the regular white more.
---
If you didn‚Äôt teabag me and flashlight click me all game and other bad behavior nonsense and aren‚Äôt doing it at the exit gate I appreciate the last hit and will let you go. If you were a tool the whole game I am definitely going to hook you at the end. 
---
Mostly I am just happier if people leave instead of waiting and just end the game.
---
Freddy is probably more fun, but Ghostface is my main. Just like him better for some reason.
---
lol aww thats so mean.
---
leatherface isn't THAT scary
---
I'm pretty sure blocking does nothing other then letting the troll know that their attempt worked. The comment will still be there
---
This sub had some of the weirest opinions on things. I watch good killers play Pig and she's really solid, but then looking here you'd think she was in the dumpster. It's super obvious who the "hold W" killers are when I hop on this sub, and the only people with any sense on the matter are downvoted to oblivion. Too funny.
---
and then he got decisive striked
---
i think that‚Äôs appropriate
---
BBQ and ruin at the same day, 3.3.1 before Halloween, blood hunt
---
Ok sorry if this rotated but I tried posting this image and it ended up this way.
---
the volume seems a bit low compared to everything else, but it may be his personality. guess they couldve gotten the guy from Darkest Dungeon
---
Yeah, just play whichever side you like. I'm right there with you with people unhooking me as the killer os a couple feet away.
---
how does one complete the challenge of using plunderers instinct and searching througj 3 basement chests in one game?? is that even possible?

The frame rate on consoles has died since the update it goes to a measly 5 fps when you lunge attack

---
Yea its not grossly in favor of survs really its just some maps have god loops but if they take that out it would be a lot more fair
---
Well, they're going to change these to something that you can actually complete, right? Otherwise, these are one of the most rare/unrealistic scenarios I've ever seen.
---
I Know this on 2018
---
I'm voting for you.
---
4k render of his "Smartface" mask looks great
---
Ooh so coool!
---
They just suck at matchmaking. I have never waited less than 5 minutes for a killer match and it's rare I wait less than 1 minute for a survivor match. When I'm playing with 3 friends it's not super uncommon to wait 5+ minutes for a match. This is all typically around the same time.
---
Love the jake in the reflection
---
inner strength encourages people to cleanse totems and is faster than healing with self care its pretty time efficient and completely counters sloppy butcher. I've run this so many times and it works wonders to escape basement hooks easily with the right perk setup. try it out sometimes its a super fun perk
---
That's not always the case either. what i was saying was, you can wait out the ds depending on long you've been chasing them. Or you can risk taking the ds and start another chase. Or there's the 3rd and worse option of going for another survivor in fear of the ds. either way you are waisting the killers time. Putting someone back on the hook can take another survivor AWAY from a gen to go for the save. then if you find a gen another survivor is working on, then that's 3 people NOT doing gens.
---
I can't play this weekend but good hunting to all of you!
---
THANK YOU you‚Äôre a legend for finding that
---
I think maybe with the new ‚Äúcross-play‚Äù feature coming (as in ONLY Steam and Windows), there might be some upcoming changes for that.
---
Thanks for the detailed response! Now I can understand more why people need it more. While Nvidia Freestyle will work on PC, colorblind players on console have no fix. Hopefully this gains more notoriety and the dev‚Äôs‚Äôll say something! Good on you :)
---
Apparently, someone already figured them all out from PTB, and listed them here! The level 4 ones match up so this should be correct.

Dude get ur corneas checked wtf

I've also had killers look for the hatch first, so they know exactly where to drop me.

Then whats the point on removing your current serum after 2 weeks when the event ends ? Your not making sense.Its literally writed in the game this

&gt;Then whats the point on removing your current serum after 2 weeks when the event ends ? Your not making sense.Its literally writed in the game this

You misread it, buddy. Its 2 weeks after **the Rift** ends.

Or they can find the hatch before the killer or use a key to open it back up, something tryhard asshole survivors do

Don't worry, the Devs said they are looking into reworking Spirit.
---
0/10 feet not hairy enough
---
is or is that not pressure?
---
Most people (me included) that dislike NoED do so because there‚Äôs no totem count shown anywhere, so if you queue solo (which most people do) yo have no way of properly countering it
---
Interesting! Definitely love this now I can finally use my keyboard and mouse with my Xbox progress !
---
Nah, dude. Killer is normally kinda difficult. Surv is hard for me cause I'm just bad at it.
---
This is kinda perfect, considering i just had a survivor message me to complain that i was an asshole for killing him because he was going for a challenge. Like damn dude, if you want to boost get a private group.
---
Read the edit, i misread the post sry
---
Who camps like that? Pathetic
---
I love it!
---
I did and still and happy about this. Hopefully this means lower queue times and now I can finally use my keyboard and mouse with this game while still having my progress for Xbox.
---
This is how I would personally buff No Mither:
---
1. You make absolutely no sound while injured or leave blood
---
2. There‚Äôs not a symbol that tells the killer you have No Mither
---
3.You can run 5% faster through the whole match. No exhaustion or conditions that have to be met
---
4. You can pick yourself up if the killer leaves you slugged
---
I feel it‚Äôs fair considering you are basically a one shot the whole game
---
Love the clown cosmetics! he always looks the coolest!
---
2033: The game ends
---
Imagine Wayne June narrating the lore. That would have been so cool.
---
So if Survivor uses a key, they're an asshole.
---
If the Killer holds a game hostage to get a 4k, that's alright.
---
Good to know asshole
---
Pig was mid tier on release but every major change to DBD since her release has indirectly/directly nerfed her.
---
Yeah, some outfits cover more skin, so seeing the shards is harder.
---
This feature was never mentioned in the Shattered Bloodlines Spotlight, so I guess it was never meant to be a big factor to consider.
---
Im not sure about the progress, I would guess it would share between Xbox and MS store, but not a 100% sure
---
Love it!
---
Just half brain dead survivor mains that downvote everything when they can't teabag it or flashlight click it.
---
ReSpeCt tHe 4%!!!
---
Yea I agree with you on this but this is a situation where the right strategy would be to camp. Maybe not face amp but I get staying pretty close to the hook because he‚Äôs assuming he has a 3K game right here. If he leaves to find the other they could be right around the corner and get the unhook and heal.
---
Oof. That's a good point. Well if it's anything to go by past game pass on PC games have kept my progress it would be annoying if I had to redo the progress and rebuy the dlc but I guess I'll find out when it's done installing.
---
The Guy from DD would be epic, I give you that
---
You know what works better than worrying if a killer will respect their precious 4% in the first place? Not getting hooked. Lol
---
Edgy teens

2033 Nea returns and kills the crapper, now..... Dead By Daylight: chapter 3
---
LeaksbyDaylight said sometime in Novemeber I haven't checked exact date recently bit it should be there
---
The boxes almost always are near generators and take 12 seconds to search. That‚Äôs a whole 12 seconds that a Survivor isn‚Äôt on a generator. It takes 80 seconds for a Survivor without a toolbox to complete a generator. In most cases, the hat comes off after the first box. That just removed 1/4 of your power, and saved you 12 seconds, in exchange for functionally nothing. At least with Demogorgon that 12 seconds comes with a cost of giving him information, and leaving yourself vulnerable, while also giving him a boost to his map pressure. 
---
Also, I‚Äôve gone against Red ranks at around Rank 8, and managed a perfect game. That‚Äôs not because Pig is good, however- That‚Äôs because I‚Äôve played a lot of Legion who is arguably worse and I knew how they thought. At this point, Pig can‚Äôt even make use of her signature perks, has next to no actual pressure, since until it actually arms, an RBT is just a fancy hat, and a lunge that is somehow louder than Demogorgon‚Äôs. Even as a stealth killer she can‚Äôt compete with anyone except maybe Wraith, since Myers can tier up and score oneshots as well as grab people off generators, Ghost Face has on demand TR loss and the ability to quickly oneshot someone if he‚Äôs sneaky, allowing for early game snowballs, and even Wraith can enable PWYF, even if his power is pretty bad. Pig is only better than Leatherface and Legion, and both of them are in line for buffs and add on tweaks, while you argue that Pig should remain in her current, weak form. She doesn‚Äôt have to be Spirit levels of strong, but she should at least be able to compete with Myers and Demogorgon.
---
Be sure to share that info when you are done :p
---
Exactly. People need to stop worrying about this "code of honor" shit I keep seeing that a lot of people here have.
---
i'm sure it's a graphical oversight
---
Yeah, then there should be no shame or guilt
---
Fortnite bad
---
Seriously tho one one is disconnecting to prevent your basement challenge. That‚Äôs literally just what red rank squads do all the time.

Yeah and players still don‚Äôt know you can flashlight burn the nurse..
---
Even if there‚Äôs no symbol, the killer will know once you get downed instantly. That‚Äôs why I suggested adding a downed timer to add a little bit of confusion and give you the opportunity to revive yourself if you manage to escape the killer. I‚Äôve played this game for 2 years and not once have I been in a game where a survivor revived himself with this perk.
---
So our only hope is to hope Behavior just fixes/patches the game? Downer... he spent a lot of money and hours on that game just for it to become utterly unplayable.

I doubt it'd be as easy to notice this small detail when you are in an actual chase in an actual loop, maintaining an actual distance from her while walking around

I really appreciate your ideas, but since they don‚Äôt solve the existing problems, I think they should be additional challenges people can take on, either as steam challenge or even in game challenge that unlock small cosmetics etc. Either way they certainly can make the game and challenges more fun.
---
The gates are open, there's one downed survivor on the ground right there that can be picked up as soon as the other survivor is sacrificed, and there are still two other survivors on the map. Why leave the hook and risk losing the 2K? Because of some dumb code of honor shit you've made up?
---
Yeah
---
If the only move you can possibly make will murder two of your teammates, you are not holding the game hostage. The killer is literally holding them hostage and trying to force you to kill the hostages so you can escape.
---
Leaksbydaylight correctly predicted that the Halloween skins would be released yesterday. The leak does have a November 2nd date for these skills.
---
Pig is an annoying killer and shouldn't be buff periodt. They ways camp their boxes and makes it near impossible to get it off without dying
---
I'd say yea. I got it when it was free on ps plus and I'm still playing it pretty regularly and enjoying it.

I did play Friday the 13th for a while and enjoyed it, but since I started playing DBD, I very rarely play Friday the 13th now. If ever.
---
I stand corrected- couldn‚Äôt remember any dates of the cosmetic collections beyond Halloween and Ghostface.
---
Stuff like that happens every other game. No big deal
---
It's camping, but camping isn't inherently bad. At this point in the game, the killer was being smart. Why leave the hook when the gates are open and you've got another survivor dying in front of it ready to be picked up as soon as the one on the hook is sacrificed and there's two healthy survivors still hiding somewhere on the map?
---
Claudette is the best main in my opinion, shes the only character I can hide in plain sight with and not get caught. Just had a game where I kept popping a gen then hiding in the bushes to waste the Hillbillys time and the other survivors got 3 gens done while he kept looking for me, literally 3 feet away in a bush. This is in high ranks as well.
---
Its been alive since launch and debatedly only gotten stronger
---
I think people accidentally being able to see Tome IV was a good thing. It will give devs a lot of of feedback and hopefully they can adjust it until December 18th (unless postponed). A lot of them are nearly impossible for solo queue players. 
---
We don't even know what waits for us on Tome II and III...
---
What about when.... she has a cosmetic on?
---
It came out in the ptb *weeks* ago and everyone on the pigs subreddit already knows about it.
---
There‚Äôs like four pallets surrounding the house. It could easily become an infinite.
---
They specifically said they have no timeline on Spirit, so I‚Äôm not sure why you think she‚Äôll be changed next. As far as I‚Äôm aware, they have said that Doctor is next on the priority list so he‚Äôll probably be changed next.
---
its the challenge right to the trapper challenge where you have to catch 2 survivors in bear traps in a single game.
---
its a "single trial" challenge and in my language its saying 3 basement chests in one game..
---
Dear god you are way too mad, too. You seriously think they disconnected to screw someone out of a challenge? You are projecting 
---
And lol at thinking that just because a squad hasn‚Äôt disconnected against you that it would never happen
---
I- can't- handle the cuteness... quick.
---
*T-bags last survivor.*
---
Ah... much better.
---
Both Michael's Scratched Mirror and Tombstone decrease his movement speed immensely, pig's aura addon removes 3 of her traps which are built in game slowdowns. Prayer beads has 0 downsides whatsoever.
---
Legion can actually be good. Try them :)
---
This happened to me too, but with the survivor track. I can do killer challenges, but not survivor challenges. I put in a ticket but it‚Äôs still not fixed and my friends have all done the majority of the challenges. :(
---
Can confirm had the same thing happen to me last week was hooked got smacked while been saved sprint burst went off and speed from getting hit at same time and went absolutely flying like this
---
He got the n word pass from detective Tapp.
---
I'm hoping this is true. Fuck the spirit
---
Of course it‚Äôs not a thing. No one is thinking that much about other people‚Äôs challenges
---
I mean I takes less than 4 second to break Line of sight. From any point on that map
---
2034: BHVR finally developes gamemodes and fixes the infinite loading screen glitch.
---
agree
---
&gt;This is a meme post right? Even in red ranks you def do not unhook 3 people. Maybe 3 unhooks with gates at 99, but no fucking way do you, as a single person, get 3 unhooks in EGC
---
The team would have to completely rekt a killer by doing all the gens with the least amount of chases possible, hope the killer doesn't DC and then toy with him to trade unhooks. All within 2 to 4 minutes max before EGC runs out.
---
The pipe mori is funny though.
---
Finally someone who can get the mask proportions right
---
Ok.. that was out of nowhere and completely inaccurate
---
I think it's also because a lot of the time you don't actually know what you're up against. Like  if you saw the survivors perks and stuff (not saying you should be able to) you'd probably pick better add on's and stuff If you thought you'd be in for a challenge.
---
This.^
---
Once everyone is broken and not cleansing, all she has left is her M1 attack since vile purge can't do anymore damage. If you can run effective loops and just keep away from her you'll win.
---
Thanks for your very detailed answer !
---
You can say either, troglodyte
---
Imagine hating killing your self to let another person live I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre so selfish
---
Those are not short but censor bars 
---
- keep that in your mind for a sec
---
Or Claudette since he was a smooth talker
---
I guess because there is absolutely no negative to them for doing it, so why not? Anonymity turns people into absolute arseholes, just cos they can
---
Excellent music choices
---
Pallor mortis never looked so good...
---
Turned out much better than mine! How did you manage to do the mask, that was what held me up
---
as a ghostface main i am offended but also amused
---
I don‚Äôt really have fun using Mori‚Äôs but I don‚Äôt play Killer to rank up like I‚Äôm sure some do.
---
I have more fun in the chase against people to see what they do, cause I can run the killer around as a survivor but sometimes I can still learn things playing Killer.
---
We both know we won't do any work.
---
Why do you care so much like who cares if they camp hatch if they know someone is being chased I rather have someone get away then no one at all and I‚Äôm actually a survivor main but go off :)
---
At least she has hair, kate is almost always bald when shes doing an actionüòÇ
---
I always switch to doctor whenever I see a blendette squad. Usually ends up with some DCs, but it's worth it.
---
Something to be learned is that Bills generally have good intentions, but poor video game skills.  Tbh he shouldve taken a hit at the beginning of the chase instead of when he tried to
---
As real as it get!
---
Not going to lie, I miss it too.
---
Yall too cute at rank 16 ‚ù§
---
Ohh here we go with the psychology 101 'projecting' babble, you sound young. Def a survivor main if you honestly think people aren't that petty. Survivors are underpowered also in this game, am i right? And yes in my year of playing this game it happens to happen when I could be doing a challenge that they disconnected right in time for. Putting 2 and 2 together usually equals four buddy.
---
they better fix the fucking frame-rate on console first
---
If we got a meh dlc of Carson like Ethan in payday, I honestly wouldn't complain

Not even just lunging I find killer unplayable on xbox right now i get like 10-15 FPS I‚Äôm even getting big stutters as survivor

I just noticed this after a few matches now that the bloodhunt is going on. I get X number of points (after bonuses, bloodhunt, withering blight, offerings, etc.) but not all of those points end up in my bank. What's going on?

How easy she is, how little info she gives off, how much info she has when phasing.

Bottomless Myers: Activated

---
I bet he dc'd
---
I‚Äôve played against them consistently, but that was a particularly good game. Trapper just needs a few tweaks and he‚Äôs set, while Clown needs a buff to his tonic. Then again, they could just buff all 3.

well at least the mask was made by the cosplayer and not the same mask i see in almost every frank cosplay that people bought off amazon

Not so easy is it?
---
Seems legit.
---
What's weird is I was doing the 2 survivor variant and, despite saying "in a single trial" I was able to do it over two (I fucked up my first match got a d/c the second one)  
---
I don't understand what it actually wants to happen in a single trial. Maybe it just means it doesn't track hook states and only complete sacrifices?
---
1v5 mode confirmed!

Funny and original title, seriously can‚Äôt wait for this meme to die. They didn‚Äôt say that their game was the best game ever, they simply took a little pride in their work.
---
Literally same thing happened to me on that map; i just hope the reports do something
---
Myk got two cosmetics. one is the knife he killed his sister with as a little kid in the original Halloween movie and the other is this hospital gown from The Rob Zombie Halloween movie I think? No new mask unfortunately, I would fuck with the beat up mask from the 2018 movie!
---
Z walls should have never been created. its the reason why this game is so survivor sided and unbalanced. killers have no way to counter it
---
what I'm trying to say is that they aren't gonna do a graphics update. The game runs on unreal 4 one of the best looking engines out there, and we still got these meh graphics which already run very poorly on the framerate side. They don't have the right people to actually make it look good while also running well.
---
It really is like that sadly, I dont mind not getting shards because we get them from playing matches, but fo the people who want the lore, rip in pieces
---
LOL, classic Bill.
---
the guy in the back is the real legend
---
This is 100% wrong. All the things you listed apply to your total bloodpoints post trial, it even says that in the description
---
Regular or Pro, because I'm on a Pro and it's better than ever!
---
From the input method I saw I'm guessing he's a console players and sadly on the base Xbox and PS4 it tends to have random ass frame drops. So he was probably getting maybe choppy frames ?
---
I was originally going to do Bark at the moon instead of Evil Eye, but Bark at the Moon got copyright stricken on youtube. So I had to find another song and evil eye fit well
---
I dont see how this is going to cause this, survivor might lose a few games cause their teamates are doing challenges but thats about it. people who dc would have dc'd anyway
---
they probably wanted to keep her intentions a mystery. they want her unpredictable. hence why she gets passive phasing and no vault animation.
---
I mean...

But yeah lore isn't a huge thing for me in most games, I play for the rewards and the challenges and progression more than stuff I cud just look up on youtube or listen to.

Who, Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen?

you forgot to delete this one
---
Back when the game came out around 3 years ago if I'm seeing this right...
---
Okay, so you're saying the game does the wrong calculation when showing you your results, but the correct number goes into the bank?
---
lmao i knew people would be upset about it XD
---
For sure man, I think these changes could work! That and make Prayer Beads a red add on.
---
its called latency not bad hitboxes
---
You are very, very wrong.
---
I‚Äôd love to do this to you and see how quickly you change your tune.
---
Thank you. This guy is like frothing at the mouth over toxic survivors
---
lol that dead hard.
---
Iron Will is indeed her only counter and I run it in every build because of her. 
---
Here's the problem: Stridor counters Iron Will. Meaning she has no counterplay whatsoever at that point. I've had pretty good results against a regular Spirit lately, but as soon as I come across one with Stridor (which is becoming more and more popular), I pretty much die instantly because there's nothing I can do at that point
---
Not to mention, Fathers Glasses will also counter Iron Will without needing Stridor. And then of course there's the issue of 4 people being required to run the same perk every single game because it's the only way to *maybe* counter one killer.
---
I only ever hit three, the fourth is always too far to get to.
---
If I‚Äôm understanding you correctly, this has not been a thing since the initial patch that came after spirits release.
---
frame rates in lobbies seem to be terrible but once i load into a game it seems to be better!
---
There's 3, a knife, screwdriver, and a broken pipe
---
Skipped leg day too wtf
---
I pity you, mate.

so many levels and still rank 11? how even

Yes, but you failed to use the proper rules of grammar in how you used it, it‚Äôs not formal. There‚Äôs plenty of ways to word things, but you need at least a fifth graders education to know when and where. Lol you‚Äôre not very bright for being ‚Äúover 18‚Äù haha
---
They did a reverse freddy, so they could either finish it by reworking her to the ground, or keep her same playstyle but make her weak as shit, like a baby legion learning how to play Dead by Daylight. I would take the overhaul and rework to make her 100x more skillful and have a less toxic playstyle then "Stand still to win LMAO"

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dpt9qx/withering_blight_event_bonus_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Why? Because I play a character that I enjoy playing and am good at?
---
Yep. Love this event. I have been trying to escape for an hour and I had three killers DC in a row. First two DC'd the second that all the gens were done and then the third one DC'd when I cleaned their hex totem early in the match. I haven't played in a while and I already want to not play this anymore.
---
One requires the survivors to repair 5 generators. The other requires the killer to allow the survivors to repair 5 gens. Against better killers that leave you no time to spare, cleansing 5 totems will mean the death of the team, and if they then have NOED? That's just unfair. The number of Spirits I've run into running NOED + Ruin is just ridiculous. Only times I'm fine with a killer using NOED is if it's a low-mid tier killer, like trapper, wraith, pig, doc, clown etc., as they need all they help they can against good survivors.
---
90% of your time.. so gens can be done in 12s?
---
Hit skill checks lol
---
Killer most definitely is overpopulated right now. You have the bloodhunt for start, then the Halloween event, and then just nearing end of the week/ rush hour time. I always go in with a killer build in mind but forget about the wait time and just use my farming survivor. With the addition of the archives, though, I might power through the killer wait time as I‚Äôm so close to P3 Ghostface.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch
---
Have you seen the Legion cosplays on here man? Too simple doesn't exist on this sub, go ahead and post it

And I'm a beautiful princess

After completing some challenges I believe you unlock some of the "memories" or voice recordings pr whatever they are.

This is pretty good, actually made me laugh lol
---
She‚Äôs basically Nurse without as strong map control. Totally invisible when moving, can go through walls, fast, yet without the cooldown or prediction skill Nurse requires? Especially with Prayer Beads? She‚Äôs too easy for the average person to learn, unlike Nurse, who I feel you earn the right to be godly with.

They replied to mine and said they‚Äôre looking into it. I‚Äôm on console so I just sent a screenshot. That was yesterday though. Sad.
---
If you don't facecamp I'm either body blocking him to the gate or hitting you with borrowed time any killer that doesn't facecamp here is a fool
---
Define design, because if you mean power design and how they function, yes they are trash. But if you mean how they look and how they are designed like that I disagree because they are really cool looking
---
But killers can't abuse the game! /s
---
Important to know that this glitch would happen for ALL exhaustion perks. Happened to me when I ran balanced landing and again when I ran dead hard. Also happened to a friend running balances landing, and to another friend running Dead Hard. For me it somehow triggered when I got hit through a pallet I was stunning the killer with. I wasn‚Äôt injured yet and so the sprint brush it gave me bugged and thus the glitch happened. I managed to correct it when USING my balances landing. I figured the exhaustion would cause it to stop and it did indeed fix it and remove the bug. That being said I believe adrenaline would also cancel it out. So it appears that the only way to stop it is to down the survivor (good luck) or for them to give themself exhaustion. Stopping, healing, unhooking, and doing generators or totems never caused mine to stop. Only triggering exhaustion did.
---
Ehmmm, thanks for the unreasonable and incorrect dislikes?
---
No, when did they ever say that? You can do most challenges with anybody though
---
No. They stated that challenges would be to use specific perks and specific characters. Some perks include the teachable ones. You could use any character for brutal strength if you had it unlocked for everyone.
---
I‚Äôve literally lost two ranks because I‚Äôve gotten tunneled and camped non-stop, I wish I could get a killer like you.
---
Think they ment non-DLC... there is a botany knowledge (claudette) one is well
---
You‚Äôre taking this as the most serious conversation you‚Äôve ever had. I found something funny on Twitter, and posted it here, then when people asked why people are being dicks, I explained and got flamed for it.
---
Yeah just go into game files in your steam directory root folder and switch out some of the read files for the older ones and bam, you now have vacuum pallets and old decisive. Ez game.
---
But seriously, i necro'd an old hard drive and uncovered some seriously good videos, so im going to upload them gradually to clesr up space on the drive.
---
Nobody is getting them
---
How? My Max was 60k
---
You‚Äôll get 500 bloodpoints for a ‚Äúsafe unhook‚Äù. It will pop up on the left side stating that it was Safe hook. If you are getting the bloodpoints for safe unhook and it‚Äôs not counting for the challenge then it‚Äôs bugged.
---
Well 2 reasons. First, sportsmanship, which is something that if you don't get you shouldn't be playing with other people. The games progression system even removes pip credit for camping because of this. 
---
2nd, who cares about a 2k? Is a mere 2k something you rank as having worth that you wouldn't risk losing? Bait the rescue, go for them all you pussy. Play the game.
---
Guys be careful my spine chill is going off, the killer must be near
---
this is still an issue, in case ya were wondering :I
---
WTF a post that is not an unfunny meme template. I hope you get to the top.
---
That's not what the post says x'D
---
It actually happened to me multiple times. I just go make some tea
---
I just go into phase and don't move.
---
got it - I thought they meant that those perks would be unlocked for all characters if your challenge required it.
---
the switch doesn‚Äôt have the Halloween event

I know right haha, you can hear me laughing my ass off just at the end there, such a perfect interaction and its so funny how we did the same joke with no queues from on another at the same time. Golden.

Spirit is easiest killer to use, shouldn‚Äôt have lost that
---
Like 7 times out of 10 the right play when she stands still is to move on to the adjacent loop, whether she's phasing or not.

We know that's not the point.

I mean with Skyrim, a wooden plate is pretty valuable if you know how to use it properly.

There's a challenge that requires Claudette. What made you think you wouldn't be required to use a specific killer?

Yeah. If he didn't do it until endgame then he's not an asshole. It still doesn't feel good to be facecamped as a survivor, but I can understand why it's happening in this situation

You dismiss the 'projecting' talk above as babble, but then admit you don't know what it means? Regardless of if it applies or not, that's a fairly ignorant way of looking at things, don't you think?
---
Well yeah you're taking the bait like a donkey with a carrot.
---
Yeah definitely. As a survivor, it‚Äôs shit but playing as both killer &amp; survivor myself I get it. Hooks are obvious bait especially at this point in the game.

Happens all the time. I don‚Äôt know why though.

No, the game was pretty good after that though, and fang made it to the end

I thought everyone knew this? Its very helpful actually.
---
Mega-blowjob form.
---
Save The Best for Last says otherwise.

Well that one says specifically use Claudette - this doesnt say use the trapper, it just says the perk. I thought I read somewhere that if it required a perk it would be unlocked.

I don't know but I had never seen it before today but now I've seen it three times.

See this kind of shit is why I ended up maining Amanda for pretty much all of last year. I think April Fool's was the same day as Easter or something so I just dicked around jump scaring people and farming with whoever caught on "just for the holiday", only to end up never playing seriously again until like the beginning of this year.

---
You know what you did and you standpoint.
---
I found what often helps is to make the sounds with your mouth while you play,
---
Stridor doesn't increase footstep volume, but footsteps are pretty loud to begin with.
---
It's been a good 7+ months since I've played so I'm not sure about the atmosphere now, but when i played killer i almost always just messed around with the survivors lol. We would run around the map together, farm points, pick people for sacrifices, then I'd murder them. Good times.
---
Not really but okay
---
I would say you probably have not played killer long enough to learn anything but if you don‚Äôt enjoy it anyway then you do you.

This should cost 4 maybe 5$
---
Is there a reason this video needed to be a minute long? Cut off the first half and nothing is lost.

You are so lucky lol. Mine gave me various mental breakdowns. Most of the time I end up sulking in the basement and yelling at the survivors to just leave me alone.

I am not like other people. I cannot do killers
---
Ah well in my opinion IT cant be more lame than legion or clown lol
---
I like flip flop. It‚Äôs not good, but I like it
---
Because Myers is a killer in the game and killers murder people?
---
I noticed this but im 99% sure it's a graphical bug and not an intended feature
---
Is it possible to learn this power
---
Yeah, not anymore, because they fixed it
---
Playing as a killer definitely help you to become a better survivor because you can learn how they think and make choices. What‚Äôs the look of their game so you can hide and loop better. If you don‚Äôt enjoy, then it‚Äôs perfectly fine not playing killers at all.  Also, killer queues are in many cases shorter especially in higher ranks because it become much harder. If you ever want to play killers again, just bare in mind that you don‚Äôt need to kill everyone or even one survivor, just take it slow and do whatever you can as you improve. Don‚Äôt think of gens as a timer till you lose, it‚Äôs just a timer of the duration of time you spend in this match, take your time and do your best.
---
No one said anything about escaping, It's about her camping you clown.
---
Yeah, because they fixed it so now it‚Äôs not broken. Glad we‚Äôre on the same page.
---
You need 5 seconds to lightburn nurse and wraith. Even with Wraith is hard but at least he also needs 3 second to uncloack. Burning nurse is a waste of time and really hard to pull off because of how fast she can gain blink.
---
I would rather have original killers than another licensed killer
---
That‚Äôs the only thing I can think of, I went to buy the game like 3 months ago but decided against it because it looks like a worse version of fallout 4, and fallout 4 is garbage if you don‚Äôt mod it. I realized I always mod my game to remove scraping from the game entirely, I don‚Äôt like looking for junk just to get +20 damage on my gun. All my settlements start completely cleared out too, once I realized how much bullshit time wasters are in the game I honestly couldn‚Äôt fathom looking around for boxes of paper clips while also trying to fight off or play with others, also no npcs so fuck that. If 76 launched with npc settlers and you had to fight and raid each other‚Äôs settlements then the game would be awesome, I looked back at Todd announcing this game and I remember saying out loud ‚Äúhe saying that like that‚Äôs what we want‚Äù ‚Äúall the people are real *applause*‚Äù ‚Äúokay so no settlements and no quests with depth, how is that good again?‚Äù
---
Sounds like you got bullied when you played the first time.
---
Check out some streamers or youtubers to see how they play. I know there are a few streamers that will explain what they are doing when they play. Take this knowledge and use it yourself and practice in game.
---
Made with prayer beads
---
I just want to see that belly wiggle :(
---
&gt;I was only pretending to be stupid  
---
Don't.
---
Looks great! Happy Halloween!üéÉ
---
I've gotten mine... seems weird that a few wouldn't get them. Hopefully they fix it soon.
---
IIRC there's one in tome 1 that originally said "Kill all survivors" in the PTB but it was changed to kill all survivors "By any means" meaning sacrifice, mori, bleedout, etc. 
---
I still think it's badly phrased and would have worded it as "Sacrifice or kill all survivors by any means" so there's no confusion.
---
No no, I never got bullied. It was just traumatizing and horrible. I know that I am the kind of person who cannot do things that people say are easy.
---
I understand that, its been a long time since I felt any stress or anger when playing survivor, even when I get steam rolled or camped, but somehow killer makes me feel in the spotlight and I dislike that, but I figured its like when I started playing survivor, each game felt important, but now that I have experience playing survivor I just goof around and dont mind losing games.
---
Also, not everyone likes the opressing feeling of the first person view killers have, you feel much more limited than when being a survivor with the fresh 3d person view. Many times the perspective has made me lose a survivor that just croutched in a spot and its frustrating.
---
So I am forcing myself to play more killer, not only to gain more experience (and seeing both sides of the game), but also because I like hunting the game's achievements and I feel like if I do it enough soon I will no longer feel as stressed playing it as I do now.
---
Original killers tend to have original and new powers while licensed ones have recycled powers, im looking at you ghostface. 
---
Yet i would still love playing as him. 
---
I wouldnt really care if the next killer is original or not, a new killer is a new killer
---
I heard about this it's not reliable
---
That sounds immensely luck based.
---
I find that 7.1 headphones give me a huge advantage in this game. LG Artimis 933s vs regular headphones, huge difference.
---
Damn that looks dope
---
Remove Endurance, give it another effect. Make it easier to activate / use.
---
You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong at all. Enjoy the event and don‚Äôt let ignorant childish people bring you down
---
The next chapter is licensed
---
I hope no one thinks I'm serious lol
---
Tried that, the guy threw up and lost stamina instead, but hey, cured the poisoning
---
No one mentioned the hidden message... unfortunate.
---
Adorable, but where's the clown?
---
I'm going to explain the comment then delete this 
---
Youre either new, or fucking ignorant as hell lmao. Almost everybody knows the Halloween map is terrible because there's an infinite, especially with balanced landing. It even puts stealth killers, including *spirit* waaay down because for some reason you can hear their little pitter patters loud as hell
---
Not to mention
---
&gt;I was only pretending to be stupid 
---
&gt;Don't.
---
It wasn't that deep regardless, and you should go find something else to do with your time besides being an asshole on a joke that in no way affects you
---
She didn't stand a chance you filthy toxic survivors. Haha
---
This is a joke post mate
---
That clown cosplay though. That was on point!
---
No insta heals are complete utter bullshit and have no counter
---
I like indie maps period, ironically it makes me feel less trapped if it feels like a building rather than a gated hell dimension
---
That's the guy who banned my first dbd account and wouldn't unban it lol.
---
You saying that makes me think about the Doctor and how similar that seems, but then again one of the logs mentions the Doctor and what Vigo did to him.
---
Michael, you gotta get outside, man! You're as pale as a vampire!
---
Source?
---
Filp flop isn't bad vs good killers because they will always take any chance to slug
---
Oink
---
Flip-Flop is good, but situational and Buckle up is okay but even more situational.
---
Why did i get downvoted tho i just said hi.
---
Not a bad Cheshire Cat though.
---
The killer isnt called killer for no reason.
---
Entitled people ffs
---
No its the top tier
---
*99's the last gen with adren, pops a syptic, pops the gen, get hit by noed*
---
Freddy is the best killer in the game. Ghostface is a tier if you can master his instant down
---
Yep, and how ironic it was that he was experimenting on the doctor like how the doctor experiments on survivors.
---
Something tells me this fact will save a lot of lives in the long run.
---
^ behavior please
---
I mean I get it but the bad faith that ppl have in game companies is bc they refuse to tell people if their reports were consequential
---
A lot of people talking about his cadence and all I can think of is how I crashed at the end lmao
---
When the mors ambito daily shows its ugly head
---
Or just bring Spine Chill. If it lights up then it's still in front of you. If not, it's already phasing, ready to smack your ass from behind.
---
I know, I am hoping for an unmasked on of her, she looks insane.
---
Almost cost me the game that did, really threw me off.
---
Looks awesome, happy Halloween!
---
Why did you post a picture of an empty hook?
---
This would be me if I didn't have to share my ps4 with 2 other people.
---
Believe me when I say I feel you. If you feel like you want to play killer again at some point the best advice I can give you is to check out streamers or youtubers play killer, I definetly started feeling more motivation to play killer after watching cool guys like Monto, Omhwrecker, Otz and others have fun with killers and the most helpful was seeing them have bad games and just moving on or just making jokes about themselves or talk trash in the end chat.
---
I have Ruin-Thanato-Coulro-Sloppy
---
&gt;Fallout 76
---
just the idea of playing that pos is scarier than everything in dbd combined
---
Not the last couple
---
I think that would have been better used on a P3 Claudette.
---
i completed number 2, and not only that but i was ringing my bell while moving
---
&gt; Almost everybody knows the Halloween map is terrible
---
Correct, which is why it would be funny to play Michael and actually use an offering for that map, cause it's Halloween right now. I'm sorry that was too hard for you to understand.
---
Pipping is a WHOLE different story, they seriously need to fix it.
---
But under the current system, you can get no kills and pip, or get a 4k and depip. It's silly
---
Oink!!
---
I didn't. I had class to get to. The only thing I cared about is the possibility that BHVR found it to be not grindy enough, and updated the numbers to keep people playing longer.
---
That's slimy.
---
Alright, if I may, the general problem with spirit is you can't see her when she uses her power and prayer beads op correct?
---
It depends who gets to the thread first
---
I don‚Äôt like ruin, it‚Äôs more of a distraction/stressful for me to use because I‚Äôm constantly trying to maintain the totem, I‚Äôd rather just know where the survivors are working (thrilling tremors tells me what gen someone is on when I pick up a survivor and discordance shows me when 2 or more start working) then chase them away from gens.
---
Probably a little bugged considering how small they are on survivors
---
Or a p3 of ghostface
---
unfortunately, as much as i agree with you, that doesn‚Äôt seem likely. for one thing, the mask is their identity. also, without the mask they just look like survivors (that was actually the central concept of their trailer) and it might get confusing. regardless, though, i agree fully that unmasked legion would kick ass. they already have the faces, they really would just need to fix the hair
---
Tsk tsk tsk
---
I have no idea what you mean by "win as killer." Winning is what you make of it. I main killer and never do I give one care about how many kills I've had unless it's for a daily. I don't care about ranks or pips, either. Make your own fun.
---
I've been saving up for his Santa costume. I'll have it fully unlocked by December.
---
Trappers usually try to lead you into their traps like a sheepdog would, often its best to just stay the hell away from the side of the map they came from or you know there are traps.
---
Dont be a sheep, its often better to just take a hit and run to a guarenteed safe loop than to let him herd you into a trap and instantly end the chase
---
It's almost as if the killer was doing the only thing you can do during the endgame unlike the rest of the trial were the killer has gens to protect
---
Hey thanks
---
Same problem here I noticed this a moment ago haha

I got into the game because of Achievement Hunter playing it and thinking it looked fun, which was notable because I generally don‚Äôt enjoy horror games.  Played through 2017, stopped in early 2018, and came back to see a much improved game about a month ago.
---
I like it OP
---
&gt;I'm sorry that was too hard for you to understand.
---
From what I've seen I never said I *didn't understand it*, the joke is *the map is horrifying*, it being *halloween has nothing to do with it*. It being funny because it's Micheal doesn't suddenly make it horrifying lmao
---
The irony is insane, and it genuinely makes me question if you're autistic if you're failed to get that
---
At least I‚Äôm not running Insidious
---
I have been playing since the beta but stopped for a while. Just recently got back into it because most other games are boring. I play alot of clown btw.
---
Those hairy arms ü§§
---
Damn spirit got that booty
---
HAPPY OINKS
---
Playing the game in a way that is to your advantage is being bad sportsmanship?
---
2K is better than 0K. Yeah, they could have baited a rescue, but there's nothing wrong with what the killer did in this situation.
---
Thank you for your continued service
---
¬´Just gonna tippy toe over here, yup¬ª

*BREATHES HEAVILY*
---
Boop the snoot!!!
---
Why does it matter if a woman wants to look sexy/slutty? Most of this sub probably went with a scary/bloody outfit but no ones running around going ‚Äúwho would have thought. Another guy trying to look scary.‚Äù
---
My favourite killer is the wraith! he was the first one I learned how to use! I've only been playing for a little while, as I only own a switch, but I'm loving it so far!!! 
---
I got into the game by watching Wade (Lordminion777) on youtube because my partner assured me I would love it. She was right!
---
How does this shit still work on people? lmao
---
I used iri+belt to get the 4kill in one game Mission for the archive (because I can't for the love of the entity get a 4k on any killer) and the surv telling me he was disappointed in me hurt more than the toxic meg going ape :'( had to confess my sins
---
Waiting on that guy that posts the twenty other discussions with this EXACT same title.
---
I did!! But she didn't like it :( she stabbed me and ran away.
---
Eh, proxy camping endgame is perfectly fine imo but straight up facecamping is still pretty bad manners.
---
My favorite killer to play as is The Hag! I love going up against the clown though - I think his character is very unique. I got into the game a little over a year ago when it was free on a PlayStation Plus deal (I also play on my computer but don‚Äôt have DBD on steam). I‚Äôve been playing religiously ever since I got the game haha. 
---
Ps- I love that you‚Äôre paying back the community like this. It‚Äôs a nice change to see from all the ‚Äúthey‚Äôre toxic‚Äù posts.
---
Instead of cleaning his blade, he takes a joint
---
But they already have the rights to the character, the only thing they didn't have was the actor's. If he allows it I don't think there's much stuff in the way
---
Does it really count as camping if you‚Äôre too dumb to not set off her traps?
---
it is somewhat, but you have to go for it either way. it's a challenge for a reason
---
Nothing excuses exploits nerd
---
His foot looks like a knife lmao
---
Wat
---
I was making fun of you saying that 15s (cleansing a totem) is 90% of your time as survivor. Which is hilarious
---
I always do bones and get extra BP and emblem progression. You have no excuse to not doing them
---
Yeah the expectation that once you've been defeated by your opponent and your games over, that your game actually ends...such an absurd feeling of entitlement huh?   Totally not like basically every other video game known to man lol.  Expecting your game to be ended when you've been defeated isn't entitlement it's common sense.  The only entitled person in this scenario is the selfish killer using their defeated opponent as inanimate pixels while they continue playing their game.
---
most ingame currency is non refundable. That being said, the haloween characters are gonna be 40% off in a few weeks ingame, albiet your paying double what you would now for less
---
"Just die to EGC!" 4Head

Myers and it was free on PS4

Is this Xbox specific or account specific? I'm on both PS4 and PC? I haven't UNLOCK on my PC one but I got all 3 of the first 25 Auric cells back on PS4. Should I wait for the PC unlock then?

This sub loves upvoting the most mediocre shit lol

Not going to lie. I‚Äôm not someone who DCs but I‚Äôd DC just to get this charm lol.

I'm having a similar issue on PC

He was entirely reworked a while ago

"Oh, then come as close as you like"
---
1. You ignore clear and obvious sarcasm for absolute no reason.
---
2. You then accuse me of something when it's your own damn fault.
---
3. Accuses me of being angered by it.
---
Nah dude. It's you. You're just another part of this absolutely toxic community and just like everyone else in this cesspool, you're blaming me instead of just owning up that you fucked up. Even when taking responsibility for one thing, you still blame me. 
---
Nah. You deserve every toxic killer and survivor that comes your way and may every killer you get be over 400 ping.
---
4 survivors on Discord with 2 syringes, a flashlight with two batteries, a key. Haddonfield offering with Balanced Landing on everyone.
---
Higher rarity of items, offerings, and add-ons will be more common.
---
Ooooooh Spicay!
---
I‚Äôm Michael Myers for Halloween
---
And yet survivors continue to be toxic. I personally rarely DC, but there‚Äôs definitely circumstances to Dcing. How bout the survivor mains that complain about killers rage quoting actually play the other guy for once. Gosh like I know it‚Äôs a dick move but some survivors deserve it
---
Not really because then the killer doesn't lose the offering. You're better off killing yourself on the first hook.
---
I think because saving requires precision and you can't  waste the opportunity, its a guessing game if yhe killer pulls this trick

I think the courting is going in the opposite direction, but regardless, I'd like to see something original next.

Ahhh okay, thanks man
---
Haha, yeah that's exactly what he does. It's you and put you into dream world. I'm a newer player so never played him before he got reworked but apparently he did a few months ago.
---
Don't make it fast, gotta keep it reaaal slow
---
Could a sworn it was a few months ago to a year they changed it, well if I'm wrong I'm wrong.
---
You can‚Äòt get every cosmetic without paying, I just bought the pink hair nea head to complete my great cosmetic combo lol

Good job on the grind

Most likely canadates;
---
#1; Vigo because his name is Scandinavian (if it‚Äôs a first name witch it is) aka ‚ÄúSwedish‚Äù he was also seen/described as going ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù
---
#2; Jack from shining as he starts as a normal guy but goes ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and may need to ‚Äúcharge‚Äù his own crazy meter to 100% or may ‚Äúcharge‚Äù through a door/pallet/window.
---
#3; pennywise, because it‚Äôs been requested a lot and devs seem to hint at him often. Maybe makes people ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù but honestly I don‚Äôt see this clown coming to dbd if only because ‚Äúit‚Äù and ‚Äúthe entity‚Äù are basically the same character.
---
&gt;both feed on emotion fear/hope
---
&gt;both can shapeshift
---
&gt;both appear as giant spiders to humans
---
&gt;both can inspire others to kill for them
---
&gt;both come from another dimension outside our own
---
&gt;the fog=the deadlights 
---
&gt;both keep their dead victims in floating vortex portals 
---
&gt;both are referred to with vague names ‚Äúye entity‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äù

So true, I‚Äôd settle for a babydoll mask
---
BBQ, Nurses, Sloppy, and Hex Ruin
---
Must DC 10 games within 1 hour to receive this charm.
---
Ich can‚Äòt get higher than 8
---
Ya
---
I'm having this problem on PS4 also.
---
I think it's just xbox
---
If you ever decide it is worth it, it‚Äôll make you a much better survivor ü§ó
---
Yes I'm so glad it's going from Oct. 31th - Nov. 4th.
---
Any tips to get higher than rank 8 as survivor? Still struggling (devotion 1 level 60, got the most good perks)
---
Yeah and now he's super stronk
---
&lt;3
---
Now the real question is, can we do anything for the sake of lore?
---
And by that, I mean dbd community forgive me for my sins but I must face camp as basement bubba for the free hooks I may lose my sanity, but the lore... the lore is the only thing that matters for me. The story is too important to let go off. I can tryhard as the disgusting spirit I am, but the fast bubba hooks I need to do it...
---
Yeah he got a major rework. Imo he's at least a top 5 killer now
---
Not possible anymore, thank go
---
Cap‚Äôn crunch
---
1. I didn‚Äôt ignore the sarcasm. It didn‚Äôt seem like sarcasm to me at all based on the context.
---
2. That‚Äôs completely true, and I apologise again, but I still don‚Äôt understand why it was such a big deal to you?
---
3. ‚ÄùAccusing‚Äù seems like a bit of a strong word here, no? To me it seems that you were angry, from the tone of your comment, so I wanted to know why you might feel that way. That‚Äôs all.
---
I‚Äôm not blaming you for anything; I immediately owned up to my mistake when I realised it. I genuinely didn‚Äôt know I was wrong, and when I found out that I was I took complete responsibility for it.
---
Play killer. Lol watch what survivors do and steal their tricks
---
DAMN right!
---
I've got Myers to 40 and still haven't seen bbq. 
---
Then I get a daily to play a killer I never play and it's on their first blood web =/
---
absolutely disgusting, makes me so sad ;-;
---
I‚Äôm obviously having a laugh at all the people who say nurse has been nerfed into the ground lol
---
M&amp;A / Ruin / BBQ / either Pop or Franklin's (if they are running flashlights)
---
Oh right i forgot every totem is lined up right next to where every survivor spawns! Bud please, the time is spent looking for the totem. Try finding every totem on a map like lerys or under ground complex on solo.
---
What are you meant to do in a situation where the survivor is in the basement, You unhook your random but there's traps all around him/her while she's coming over towards you due to being Notified that someone's been unhooked? Do you just run without setting off traps bud? Do you use Lightning breathing, First form, Thunder clap 8 fold? Are you immune to the traps? Are you working with the killer? You're making little sense.
---
Fellow NonCamping Bubba says Hi!
---
Also Yeast?? Like Diane Weast??
---
Thanks so much for holding the contest for the community, OP! Glad to see friendly faces around here. ^-^
---
My favorite killer my far is the doctor. I just love the sense of control you have over the difficulty of the match and how you can change elements of the map like fake pallets or worrying about screaming. Really fun for me on both sides! 
---
What brought me into the game was that it was free for PlayStation Plus last year. Once I upgraded my PC I bought the base and all the chapters to support the development of the game further and love just running around screaming with some friends after a good day of work!
---
Its rng your not lucky enough but you will get eventually so keep at it
---
Shitpost comment
---
I miss the desaturated colours from 2017. Also 2017 Halloween theme best theme.
---
For when you fucked up but have Lithe
---
wish they put more muscles on his legs tbh
---
99 gen, heal, then pop it. Sure if the killer comes back before finishing healing then pop it
---
Literally every baby killer that was too lazy to deal with insta-heal -.-
---
Maybe if devs wouldn't implement another infinite jungle gym reeeeeeeeeeee!
---
Detective's Hunch, Sprint Burst, Prove Thyself, Adrenaline. Fuck all those totems
---
I am hoping the DC husk system will band-aid fix Tactical Disconnects.  Nothing sucks more than slugging a Dying Light obsession to keep him off gens (Since he's not affected by the perk slowdown) and not hooking him (since if he kills himself on hook, Dying Light deactivates) and he simply DC's and you lose your perk.
---
So, the important question is. When are we getting more pictures of the cat?
---
Also cool stuff :)
---
Just like the ghostface leak Freddy leak stranger things leak and saw leak
---
I hope they dont nerf her base kit. I think imo she(spirit) should get changes like the ones mentioned in bricky's latest spitit casefile like remove bumping or changing beads.
---
Probably didnt want laurie.
---
It's cheaper to buy individual characters if your arent planning on getting them all.
---
Shit
---
Numerous options here. Flashlight the traps away or crouch to the hook. Run borrowed time to keep the survivor safe off hook. Have sprint burst to get out real quick or dead hard and just take the first hit. Don‚Äôt catch an attitude bc you can‚Äôt counter play a hag.
---
It remains part-way done.
---
Wraith all the way man
---
I got them on my PS4. But this makes me worried for my PC version as I haven't unlocked the battle pass for that one.
---
Trust me dude the ranks are shit im constantly deranking killer ( about rank 7) because i bet full rank 1 lobbys or ranks 20 players with decisive deadhard adrenaline and borrowed time.
---
Well if you‚Äôve payed attention to the blood points tally post trial you‚Äôd notice your bonus blood points are applied before the withered blight points are applied.
---
Surprise
---
They should make it "After taking a protection hit or taking a hit while injured, gain a token. Upon receiving 3 tokens, the next time you would be put in the dying state ignore the hit." plus the typical once per match and the same aura reveal thing.
---
If you dc you're a bitch.
---
Ask, and you shall receive:
---
Ashe the kitty! https://imgur.com/a/6uuvbn7
---
What else is he supposed to do?  Give them the free hook????
---
I‚Äôm new on PC but I‚Äôve played the game a lot on ps4. I transferred over less than a month ago and would be open to joining y‚Äôall since I gotta find people to play with.

Prestige is probably going to be what I do next, maybe legacy. I plan to do the ultra toxic purple hair at some point as well

Yeah those killers just want to be spoon fed bloodpoints cos they're too shit to get enough points even if they lose. This is literally where 'nerf insta heal' came from it's ridiculous and now it's useless yet they're still allowed NOED to be untouched..

Your gonna get steamrolled until you work out her blinks, might be a bit more doable with the reworks now and the baby add on's

---
I love this picture. Amazing cosplay and shot
---
Oh shit u right, guess I gotta step up my game. Forgot to teabag before unhooking too, yikes on me
---
Buckets and platters work a bit better but the wooden plate works in a pinch.
---
It‚Äôs all rng I‚Äôm afraid
---
Newer to the game, is it really worth it to run both lullaby and ruin?
---
I normally wouldn't have a problem with it but my internets really picky so people can connect just fine when I'm the host but connecting to someone else as a survivor leads to me being unable to move at random times during the match, it's strange cause this is the only game I've had the problem with.
---
I'm a pig main sadly ;-;
---
Yeah I love the survivor mains who tunnel 24/7 and use all kinds of scum to their benefit. Doesn't help that streamers sometimes teach them these "tactics".
---
With enough stacks, Michael has 0 TR until tier 3, where all 4 stacks gives 16m TR.
---
the game has a pretty steep learning curve. switch around between killer and survivor to see all the perks and status effects. gradually you will become more familiar with the common ones. i have almost 800 hours in the game and i still don‚Äôt know them all by heart
---
It is almost like projectiles cause completely different perception when latency is involved.

I don't have fun playing as the killer though
---
\- My favourite killer is Ghostface. Unfortunately his power is kind of broken at this moment and most of his addons doesn't make any sense, but I like him. Because he has 0 terror radius I had many many fun moments and good laughs by jump scarring survivors :D
---
\- I got into the game because of twitch streamers. When I saw the first dbd stream I thought that the concept is very interesting and fun. After I played the game during the free weekends and didn't like it, but I was keep watching the twitch streams. I thought that it is kind of game that is only fun to watch... During the last free weekend I tried it again and am addicted to it ever since.
---
Thanks!

You can't stop my unhook tbags, they're a part of who I am

Huntress's power was leaked several months before her release. Kate was in the files for a while before her release. Hag's daily and power description was leaked before her release. 
---
So no, leaks are not only for lisenced content.
---
She's notified on destruction idiot, She would reach you to replace them before you even get to the random, You'd be grabbed from the hook+ usually she comes post unhook so borrow time doesn't proc idiot, you're greatly overestimating sprint burst, dead hard works for 1 hit, i'm sure she'll just give up after that huh? It sounds like you play against shit hags tbh
---
I played fo76 before fo4, I picked up 4 when 76 was having a terrible time with server issues, but I couldn‚Äôt get into it. I think it was because no matter what I did, my progress wouldn‚Äôt show to others, which is the appeal to me for 76. Basically if I made a cool settlement in 4 no one could see it, but if I make a cool camp in 76 randoms could come hang out and you can make connections because of it.
---
76 has its problems for sure, but damn if it isn‚Äôt a fun game to play with others!

Also only killer rank 11, I already know the most tricks

Yup even if you don‚Äôt like the killer or an add on suck it up an play, don‚Äôt be a baby

If you receive this charm for Disconnecting it's permanently equipped onto all your Survivors/Killers for a set amount of time.

Why is pig so D U M M Y  T H I C C

I only camp when i get genrushed
---
Yeah, if you really hate the killer that much just kill yourself on hook, at least you'll get some bloodpoints out of it
---
Sorry I meant to say hinted at every licensed chapter has been hinted at
---
Now we only need you to rip a tree in half :D
---
Look at the perks for yourself. BBQ and WGLF say they award the points post trial and are the only two perks that say that. Everything else doubles your points in the trial, and in the trial you are capped at 32k maximum bloodpoints.
---
Haha perfect
---
You look great!
---
Or maybe I‚Äôm just better than you? I learn how to counter play the killer instead of just calling for unnecessary nerfs. Name calling doesn‚Äôt make your point any stronger by the way. Makes your argument look weaker honestly. You out here acting like hag is an S tier killer and can‚Äôt possibly be outplayed. Please continue it‚Äôs quite hilarious.

I'm guessing one of them called you for Tunneling or being toxic after the game?

---
*sweats*
---
Only viable outcome you have which will punish the killer is to DC. If they don't care about ranking up then that does nothing sadly. I get they want some risk/reward parts on maps, but something which can be abused like this needs to be changed somehow to give an out, even if the best result is you still take a hit. Also report these people.
---
You're suggestions don't work you idiot lol The only way it would is if she didn't warp to you, That's it. No one is saying she's S tier but the idiot this comment is directed towards. Her changes are more buffs to other aspects of her kit than a nerf in any regard. Why do I always get you kids .__________. can hold an argument for as long as it takes you to figure out you're facing billy

man, i hope they add this. It just looks super cool.
---
Coming from you..
---
What's your highest rank by any chance? 18? The counter play is crouching as long as you don't need to do anything other than a gen around that hex. The hag knows that we can crouch over them so she patrols around her totems and hooks, If you were to unhook a player- She would rush over to you guys (never being too far) And you will not be able to escape fast enough whilst crouching to avoid a sub par hag that planned on camping. I'm actively going against the camping play style everyone BUT the Reddit community seems to hate, They apparently love camping campers to the bone and would of probably veto any suggestion that makes a killer viable outside of hook camping. Especially the ones like you
---
I've never noticed this. But I have seen her hair like up all in the same direction for a second when she starts phasing
---
That‚Äôs true, I play solo and that would be really helpful.
---
Do you know the meme where there are two hands holding each oder. These is the dbd version of it
---
Shouldn't have gone up there with multiple people then
---
It's wasn't OP it was the same level as NOED therefore the same logic applies.
---
There‚Äôs something about those legs man, I wouldn‚Äôt mind going against this bad boi anyday
---
As a spirit main, this thread was gold.
---
Can you explain why it's so bad for killers? I don't understand.
---
yea i can barely understand it myself
---
Much appreciated! I‚Äôll have to look him up! Thanks man!
---
Bub if you are taking your sweet time admiring tiny details on spirit's body to check if she's phasing then by the time you notice the change it's already too late.
---
Plus this changes on different skins.
---
The mask came from Wish.com but looked a little on the cheap side.  I cut out the mouth (teeth and lips) and did some paint washes over the entire thing to give it more definition.  Hot glued black fabric (still see-through) on the inside of the eye holes.  And, some blood splatter of course.

The "Leave" button
---
Garunteed pip for survivors you mean? And yeah this would be amazing. Though killers would do just so people lose items still in that case... Once that's fixed the give up mechanic would be nice
---
I mean if a killer feels like they‚Äôre being bullied enough to DC I doubt they‚Äôre gonna do survivors a favor and open the doors for them lol. they‚Äôll still DC regardless.
---
The survivors probably wouldn't leave; especially in red ranks
---
If I'm tilted enough to want to DC then I'm not gonna go out of my way to open the gates for the survivors, can't imagine many people would
---
i was literally trying all day, finally paid off. clown eventually got me...not even salty!
---
I get spirit is good but you know what I hate more trying to have fun with a killer not as good as spirit then get cussed out and had shit said to because I‚Äôm trying to have fun, spirit is a necessary evil I believe something could be done to make her a tad bit harder to play but for the most part I think she should stay the same because once I get to rank 3 or so it becomes quite hard to rank up sometimes
---
Can someone confirm this?
---
Awww duck
---
That‚Äôs bs man
---
Really it's crossplay with steam? I just spent 10-15 mins looking for a survivor game but when I play the steam version it usually only takes 30 seconds max
---
Your reason was that you don't "win." I provides my own experience. I am not trying to talk you into anything.
---
No no no  no no no NO! This isn't a Wholesome community!   
---
Player 1: Got a flashlight?   
---
Player 2: Yes   
---
Player 1: Give it to me and I'll flashblind the killer after I tbag him.   
---
Player 2: Sure.
---
Yea i mean guaranteed pip for survs and then when they escape they get to keep their items.

Just a thought. Like if i get gen yanked by a prayer bead spirit i just kill myself on hook just thought itd be nice to have the option as killer to give up.

Maybe just wear it for a few days next year

Well I‚Äôd rather just dodge the lobby completely than kill myself

It's really not that hard to notice on safe loops. This knowledge is useful to use against Spirits who fake-phase pallets that are dropped.

People chirp premonition and sprint burst saying how there's better perks in their respective categories. But sprint burst or premonition would have saved him here where spine chill and dead hard failed him.

---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be suspicious- don‚Äôt be suspicious‚Äù
---
Couldn't even link it smh /s
---
Try to make friends with other survivors around your skill level. Makes it go way easier
---
It is, because most survivors spend a lot of time in the game initially trying to find the totems, and no one is doing any gens. if they cleanse one there's a 50 percent chance it wasn't ruin, and they don't know which one until they start repairing a generator, which can buy you some time. By the time they have cleansed the other one, everyone has been hooked once or twice. But you can also get unlucky and they cleanse both totems early on. Still you have NOED as a final clutch since most survivors never cleanse all totems. 
---
Of all the games I play as survivor , I almost never see all totems done unless I'm the one who does them.
---
This has been posted dozens of times to this sub already
---
I was pondering why and it‚Äôs possibly because the crushed can relates to her and that particular moment rather than a full looking one. She crushed a can with her powers during testing so the crushed can probably makes more sense.
---
I get that but it just seems unnecessary lul
---
i'm dead lmao
---
I meant they wouldn't leave until they max out their bp if the killer could open the gates like op suggested
---
I'm actually surprised no one did either, Have to say it freaking awesome, lol. The Cosplay is amazing to though!
---
Two types of protection hits, only one counts
---
You should ask people to loop you around here.
---
Everyone‚Äôs confusing ‚Äúcamping‚Äù with what we‚Äôre seeing here. The usual camping is after hooking a survivor, the killer doesn‚Äôt leave the hooked Survivor. This is usually a bad strategy and bad form because everyone else can freely work on generators while the killer does nothing but guarantee a kill but doesn‚Äôt even get as many blood points from it as they could‚Äôve. It‚Äôs bad form because that person on the hook isn‚Äôt even getting to play the game.
---
Now compare that to this: the game has been played, generators are all done, doors are open. What‚Äôs left for the killer to do? I know survivors want the killer to leave so they can all escape, but if you were in the killer‚Äôs shoes, ask yourself: where would you really go? It‚Äôs hard for survivors to accept that, because they want that hope of winning, and it‚Äôs crushing when it‚Äôs taken out of the survivor‚Äôs hands and the killer is in complete control of that survivor‚Äôs death. I hate it too, but I understand it. The game has been played and he‚Äôs making sure to secure that kill. There‚Äôs no generators to patrol. Just you.
---
That being said, if I‚Äôm the killer, unless they were toxic or VERY challenging I‚Äôll leave the hooked guy and patrol for fun. If they make it, it‚Äôs fine. As long as mostly everyone had fun.

It's really only useful on safe loops with no tall walls, where the pallet is dropped.
---
If the spirit isn't glowing, then just stick to the pallet.
---
If she starts to glow, it's time to walk away and hope for the best.
---
While I don't play as killer much i've hit Rank 2 survivor before even fully understanding the game and certainly not knowing of the reset which is why I haven't bothered going for Rank 1 since. It sounds more like you just haven't played against better killers.
---
I understand hes at wrong but we dont know if op provoked that.
---
Alright let's see, my favourite killer is by far Mr. Myers because I've gotten the best jumpscares playing against him. The times I've screamed my lungs out because I didn't see him until he smacked me are the best ones in my opinion.
---
Besides that, I love that his power can vary a bit. It's not always just standard Mikey, it could be a jumpscare Myers or a tombstone one that can Mori your ass without needing hooks. Makes the games a lot less repetitive.
---
Can't remember how I got into the game, I think a friend started playing so I bought it and joined in which was a little over a year ago. Been watching some streamers to try and get better but I still play like a potato sometimes :D
---
Great to see someone having a lot of positive experiences with the game, I wish there were more positive players :) Also, what is your favourite killer?
---
u/Peanits Thanks for listening, dad.
---
That‚Äôs the worst possible thing they could do to it.
---
W8 when did ruin appear?
---
If you mean the Myers and Laurie ones, they aren't currently on switch due to it not receiving the archives update yet, as the skins' files are stored in the update build itself
---
Some other skins do make it harder to check the shards, while the P3 skin makes it easier to notice.
---
How? If it functions like that you have to go after the rescuer
---
Bless you for this
---
I opened four chests in a single game when I was doing the first chest game. If you have the perk to see their aura and burn the coin to get an extra chest it's easy. Just check in chat beforehand to make sure no one else is running a similar quest.
---
Hey buddy, you just blow in from stupid town?
---
Moris specifically need to be ax'd hard, it's really BS that Green Mori can let you kill anyone after the first hook, but at least with that it's only one time, Purple Moris are total bullshit.
---
Keys need a rework or the only key that should exist is the key to open dark locks, it's kinda bullshit that they all don't.
---
There really isn't a good way to stop DCs though.  Like yeah, bans can happen but I can't imagine that being a permanently good solution given all the scenarios in which DCs are just natural occurrences.
---
Although there is more than a few occurrences in which I would be OK with people DCing, the one that springs to my mind is I just had a game where I was bleeding out on the ground for over 2 minutes after getting hit while the killer looped the last guy.  Shit was agitating.  I would give anything for a "PLZ BLEED OUT FASTER" button.
---
I‚Äôm putting on noed every game because events like this bring out nothing but toxic swf‚Äôs in every single rank
---
Not really
---
I think it counts if you work a gen together. Also, I don't consider a teammate that loops the killer the entire game shitty.
---
........
---
Idk but this has been happening to me for many months
---
This is the most self-righteous "suggestion" I've ever seen. In reality, this suggestion is terrible. Guess I don't have a "positive IQ number."
---
I'd be perfectly OK with DBD going into a "Water color" esque texture for it's backgrounds anyways as that is what they are, just some textures and lightning need upped.
---
Why didn't she just dash towards you?
---
Yea bro that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt think hag needs a nerf cus I only play against bad killers. Or maybe like everybody else but seemingly you I don‚Äôt see a problem with her. Btw i run hag a good bit and believe it or not she‚Äôs not super oppressive! Shocking I know. There are plenty of other killers I prefer over her bc they are better.
---
Evil Within 4: Terror Radius can be heard as if the killer was right behind the survivor. Lunge distance gets increased by a flat 2 meters. When The Shape gets within grabbing distance, press M1 to suplex the survivor, killing them instantly, adding a 25% bonus applied to all bloodpoints after the match. Evil Within 4 lasts for 120 seconds, or as many seconds as it takes for everyone to DC.
---
But, and I could be wrong here, I highly doubt there's pine trees in Babylon.
---
I was all ready to rant about Spirit, then legit laughed out loud when I opened this thread.
---
Well done!
---
Imagine being that poor Bill. Just heading towards a gen and a chainsaw wielding maniac falls on your head.
---
"too lazy to hit" fucking omegalul. Are nurse and legion players too lazy to loop now too?
---
so then the inner eye charm on the right side of the screen is just for doing the epilogue then?
---
Most of the time it's both
---
It was already endgame. There WERE no gens. Let a killer have his safety pip.
---
I highly doubt that the entity really cares enough to take the surroundings of the ruin when it could just stick it in a foresr
---
But it isn't much of a nerf to anything but camping, She usually has to stay close to her traps to properly warp to them but to allow her to move around the map while being able to land a hit/down is a much stronger kit that being reset every time someone walks over a trap. Also I didn't say she was oppressive, I'm pretty sure that term was reserved for the super fast "The Shape, And the clown that can chuck 5 gas canisters at you with only one being needed to confirm a hit. She's just one of the killers whose build works players into a camping play style. It isn't as bad as say- The Cannibal but I've already spoken on him in addition to how the plague can throw up on players while keeping pace. Essentially powers with little cool down and high spamability would be considered oppressive while i toss killers who have defaulted into a camping play style into the mix for more potential.
---
I unlocked bbq ages ago. Saw ruin way more than I ever saw bbq and managed to get bbq on 3 killers (I own all at around level 40) and today I bought demogorgon and got it literally level 1.guess I found my new main
---
Not to brag, I played 2 matches and only scared 3 crows total. Guess who made 3 laps around Lery's while counting number of crows scared in next trial?
---
Would that not be horrifying to you?
---
Taking a hit while injured is just being downed, and you typically need to be downed 3 times to be sacrificed, so taking 1 protection hit would on average activate MoM. That would probably be too strong.
---
I started playing nurse because of her rework and this has been pretty accurate to my experience
---
It's a recipe for sugar cookies taken from the internet, we just mixed the dough with the food colouring and cut out the triangles

---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ This is the best !
---
Cool, then I assume we'll adjust noed to work forever even if the totem is cleansed. And ruin doesn't go away until 2 minutes after the totem is cleansed?

---
I was a hard survivor main for over a year.  I started doing killer dailies because they kept popping up.  I started liking the BP...then I started liking playing killer.
---
Now I'm a killer main.  Because of my past I'm a friendly killer main.  I go for 8 hooks and 4 survives.  I end up with around 56k BP per match without offerings, dailies or challenges.
---
How
---
I like it, it's simple and recognizable!
---
‚ÄúI get it, it hurts‚Äù is probably the understatement of the fucking century
---
How is this meme relative. It‚Äôs not a choosing option.... 
---
Now you could have Pop or Hex: Ruin and it could slightly be correct...
---
Same tbh. It's been happening to me right after the event started.
---
I don't want to believe that I only started to question it after I saw Michaels challenge
---
Damn people were really upset about my comment. It was just a joke peoples.
---
Is the archives only on PC
---
Never knew Ash was a Russian. Thanks for pointing that out comrade
---
Maybe no hook nearby, trying to confirm kills in the endgame isn't terrible, not that face-camping is good, but in this situation if there were no nearby hooks, why take the risk?
---
*Squishing sounds* ‚Äú... so is that it?‚Äù
---
You have to unlock it from the rift now and wear it as a charm I think.
---
I've had tons, luckily i seem to always hook them first. Every now and then though i see people disconnect but it's too random to be on purpose.
---
I don't mind playing killer I just dont want to do all the their challenges in each level of the archives. Just looking to know right from the beginning if skipping killer challenges only makes me miss bp and rift shards. If that's the case, I'm okay with missing out on that to not have to play killer
---
The Rift fragments from the current Tome can only go towards the current Rift. For example if you maxed out the Rift without doing the challenges and then started completing them the Rift fragments would be wasted. Likewise if you waited until the new Rift opens and then did the older challenges.
---
That's such a sick play lol
---
Haha, thank you! I like your sense of humor.
---
Thanks! Couldn't find a jumpsuit anywhere so i just used what I had and bought a plastic knife
---
There's even one where you have to sacrifice 3 survivors during Endgame collapse with NOED in one trial. These are ridiculous even for hard challenges.
---
It looks like everyone gets the 1k when a gen is done, regardless of if they brought the offering
---
Dude, are you okay? I've been DC'ed on for most of the night, but you seem extra on-edge.
---
A lot of women prefer a big man.  Ride the wave and play your cards.
---
Claudette is a survivor only charm :(
---
You do know you get penalised for staying in close proximity to hooked survivors for scoring pips. They weren't doing themselves any favours.
---
Yes, and i hate it, just for a very little charm, they removed it from the big vials of the skin.
---
Happened after a match, on restart it went back to normal.

No, it's all platforms, except maybe Switch. Not sure, I don't own one.
---
They updated the Engine in the update which has caused changes to some cosmetics, even his hair looks different now.
---
That‚Äôs why I asked, there‚Äôs no archives on Switch yet
---
1 killer per 4 survivors
---
Same.
---
JAKE LOOK OUT HES BEHIND YOU OH GOD HE CANT HEAR US HE HAS AIRPODS IN
---
There likely won't be for a while.
---
Your corpse paint does look bomb as fuck though mate.
---
Ohhh, okay, i understand now, thank you !
---
Dang, hopefully I can watch the lore stuff online
---
Not true when you say 'or', I've had a couple bloodwebs that have had multiple event stuff on it, only had one petal at a time, but have had multiple items
---
Umm what‚Äôs Jason doing in there last time I checked he was having his own party üòÜüòÜ
---
True, but there‚Äôs always the chance she‚Äôs just faking a phase. Sometimes that is enough to make a survivor make up their mind one way or the other.
---
Ah, burger king myers cosplay. Tombstone them all ma boi
---
Favourite Killer has to be Trapper but unfortunately I refuse to use Ruin so I hardly get good games with him. 
---
I got into the game watching Huntress gameplay &amp; then won DBD in a rafflle via Sattelizer's stream. 
---
Thank you for the giveaway!
---
Demofaceon
---
The Archives aren't fully released until December 18th, but I'm sure you'll be able to find the Tier 1 audio logs.
---
DS already does that but allows them to slug
---
My favourite is the Clown. Always happy whether he gets pallet slammed or when he down a survivor.
---
\*Shrug\* I suppose I'll join. Thanks for the chance!
---
My favorite killer is The Spirit because of her mind game potential and jumpscares that add to the experience. I'm also super into things like the Grudge, who she happens to be based off of. I'm not as good with her as I am with other killers but I enjoy playing her the most.
---
I got into DBD when I was browsing around for a new game that wasn't another MMO, low and behold it happened to be a horror game, and thus my interest in DBD was born. I started out on PC before my computer turned into a potato, but I missed being hooked so I bought it again.
---
Why is nobody commenting on the fact that the latest update broke the shrine of secrets? The current shrine is supposed to have Hex Ruin as part of the 4 teachable perks, the update changed it to a new set of 4 perks, I'd spent the last 2 days grinding out as killer to get Ruin as I really cba to grind the Hag, I reach 2000 shards, go to the shrine and it's a completely new set of perks. Waste of me time. The devs don't know how to implement an update without breaking other areas of their game. They haven't even acknowledged it, all the sites state that Hex Ruin, Thanatophobia, Dance with Me and some other perk are all currently in the shrine but they're not.

---
Cosplaying as a pedophile, the ultimate flex
---
Nothing that op could have possibly done would warrant using an exploit like this as an equal reaction.
---
Delet this
---
Hmm considering that all the survivors were alive and you managed to keep her running until gates were opened, it still seems like a survivor win. True, she might have gotten you, but in the long run getting 1k from all those perks didn't do her much good.
---
Aww, I wanna see his dreamscape! uwu
---
I laugh everytime.
---
Because this post isn't about the shrine???
---
This needs to be the next survivor!
---
Please don't flashlight Freddy Pupper
---
myers is def one of my least/most favorite killers at the same time. He's so cool, and I love his powers, but then i get stabbed lmao
---
Hey come on now Scott‚Äôs not that ugly
---
Completely agree with you. The guy was a good sport in the end. Obviously I wanted him to leave so I could unhook in time. Had he hung around &amp; never left, he would‚Äôve had 2 guaranteed kills right there which is understandable.
---
What pants? Hehe
---
You can take me to your basement anytime dude. Take my upvote!
---
Really good job!!!
---
Even then, someone dying on hook with exit gates open is 500 points, which is more than normal, where you get 200 points regardless if they get saved or die, though you still get the 200 if someone gets saved. So at worst you lose 300, but even just starting a chase is 400 points. Getting kills is only good for reducing the amount of players who can work on a generator, which is obviously irrelevant once the gates are open.
---
If you're just camping to make toxic survivors mad then fine, that's just part of the circle of toxicity and there's no rules against it. But the game is built in a way where playing "by the survivors rulebook", to a certain extent at least, IS actually the optimal way to play killer from a gameplay perspective.
---
I don't like going vs tryhard and/or toxic swf either, but pissing them off certainly won't make them unequip their meta builds anytime soon. I'm just playing for bloodpoints and I'm having much more fun (and points) than back when I cared about actually getting kills. I still get just as many 4k's, but the occasional 4 man escape really doesn't bother me at all and I'll still usually have upwards of 25k points.
---
And as someone who mainly plays pig, I'm really liking the new patch with instaheals gone and OoO not triggering when crouched anymore :p

Freddy at age 6, already sacrificing for the entity.
---
Myers is definitely one of my favorite Slashers.
---
Jake! Watch out! Oh wait he cant hear us, hes got airpods in!
---
Every time I do a Nurse daily I get *that guy* that has to send a message saying ez after the game. I'm sure my console Nurse with one perk and no add-ons was a tremendous challenge for you, random jackass survivor.
---
Claudette‚Äôs die first if i find them
---
That is fucking excellent, good job!
---
I'm a fuckin hero in my book, she only focused me the whole match so all they had to do was gens and get me off hook but I guess it was worth it for her
---
They're just gonna slug you anyways. This is just like "haha you can't touch me til you find one of my other teammates", terrible suggestion. Negative IQ.
---
God I still cannot believe how fucking useless that perk is. 
---
At least Insidious has some meme value and it's good for a certain playstyle (even if that playstyle is shit)
---
But Monstrous Shrine is literally useless. You don't even use it for Basement builds, that's how horrible it is.
---
sick, you even built the walls and pallet!
---
I've seen some people cosplay as Dwight, Bill, Nea and Feng
---
The timer for current ds works perfectly well to stop tunneling. The suggested version is bad. Say the killer doesnt tunnel but instead gets looped around by someone else, or just generally doesnt get a hook. They go back to the survivor they last hooked like 2 or 3 minutes later and get d striked for no reason. Super dumb. There is nothing wrong with ds. The nerf it got was perfect. It's still an amazing perk.
---
Look dope, I just really want a blighted demogorgon skin
---
OH YEAH! that one video of them healing?
---
Big feet, er big er... hands or whatever they say
---
Leaked Micheal cosmetic
---
Yeah points from the event tally up to your total score which is why you get over 32k in points now
---
Idk man, they're so shit they give you an extra health state, like they're so bad they change the game, Like omg they need to be buffed
---
#**Putrid Serum is only available in the free track of The Rift. A total of 60 Putrid Serum are available this year, allowing you to earn up to 6 Hallowed cosmetics (or two full outfits). Putrid Serum will remain in free track for the duration of The Rift. Any unspent Serum will expire two weeks after The Rift closes.**
---
Oh for sure, but he still got kinda messed up by the pallet considering he should have definitely downed me there
---
Wait a fucking fuck-
---
Should we point him to r/dadbydaylight as well?
---
Its in the free Rift track, which is the battlepass like system they added into the patch. Its in the archives section
---
Sorry guy inserted wrong text it‚Äôs supposed to say ‚Äúthis is how salty I am about people talking about nerfing my keys or my syringes (junkie) because I play and‚Äù
---
I got dbd on a steam sale, and got two dlcs, ghostface and Leatherface, cuz i love those characters.
---
Ghostface and Billy are my favourites at the moment, but i havent played all the killers yet.
---
That and there were several pictures from a few months ago
---
Minor bit of constructive criticism- the legion mask has a bit of a big forehead, if you could someway cut that off, it's a perfect mask. Otherwise a good 8/10!
---
It‚Äôs better that you got BBQ. You could always unlock Hag then level her up until she gets Ruin for free, but you can‚Äôt do with BBQ as you need to buy Bubba with real money.
---
Beat me to it...
---
we could still play if you wanted to!! no party necessary, I just hate queuing in alone :))
---
When you're trying to go for the achievement:
---
Then don‚Äôt look?
---
Its Burger King Myers
---
A full on representation I love it!
---
They don't even were carrying flashlight, they melted your eyes pointing at them with lightsabers.
---
Ruin now exists forever and bbq and chilli lasts for a minute.
---
Aka only prestige if you want the bloody clothes
---
How do you rotate him like that on console?
---
i mean, why would you fixed something that's not broken?
---
Legit the oldest trick in the book, every killer above rank 10 knows this shit
---
It should be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fucking camp pallets in general learn to loop‚Äù 
---
Camping pallets is the worst thing to do. It gives the killer soo much more advantage.
---
Funny, laughed. Have an updoot
---
in what way is it not a buff when it was a direct increase to her plethora of abilities?
---
exactly !!! but it's even sadder when they do it against a tier 1 myers cuz hes so slow
---
take my goddamn upvote
---
For killer run bloodwarden but it will still be hard.
---
Also, sorry it‚Äôs on it‚Äôs side, it‚Äôs not supposed to be like that.
---
Ah, yes. Karate Myers
---
You need to run more loops. =D
---
they dont need to be buffed or anything, they are and were perfectly fine
---
Stridor trumps this anyway. Cause Iron Will reduces grunting by 100%, making it zero. But Stridor raises it by 50%. Bringing it back up to 50% of grunting noise. I use stridor on Spirit and you can tell who is using Iron Will or not bc they are much quieter. It actually throws me off sometimes because someone will be really loud so I think they are next to me but they are farther away so I miss.
---
So that's why the update was delayed smh
---
Just in general. You can make a pallet last up to a full minute but instead you give up that minute. Especially at shack pallet lol. 
---
Early throws of shack pallet or shack pallet camping feels bad lol.
---
Even if he moved at 115%, just not being able to lunge is a huge drawback to killers. You can literally run around a rock against T1 Myers and it will take forever for him to hit you twice.
---
&gt; I would fuck with the beat up mask from the 2018 movie
---
bless the person that would have to endure that
---
Yeah, I'm fat, I am cool with it.
---
Tombstone and an ebony? That is some massive overkill, especially during bloodhunt lol. Surprised he didn't pop on NOED over Dying Light (Idk why he ran Dying Light, he wouldn't be hooking anyways. Unless he forgot about it's rework)
---
New Killer concept; LarryLavekio's dog
---
How is multiple survivors escaping through the hatch before all the gens are popped or instantly recovering a health state not broken?
---
Can someone explain what charms do? Are they just cosmetic or do they serve a purpose?
---
Format backwards
---
Perfectly fine is an over statement, they were so shit omg like they made an m1 killer waste no time at all, XD
---
Pro tip for clearing the second challenge:
---
Wraith always starts the trial invisible.
---
Good luck!
---
I thought this shit was in slow motion at first XD
---
I just love the idea that anyone with a positive IQ would agree with op because the only people who do are probably their SWF group. OP seriously thought people would agree with them.
---
Unsafe pallet. Need to look for a better loop.
---
