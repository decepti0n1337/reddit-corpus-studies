Oops, I meant three times!

---
Yeah very lucky haha 
---
I do my best
---
Yeah, that's another upside of monstrous shrine
---
It depends. What is ‚Äúwinning‚Äù conditions? Get a 4k as a killer or escape as a survivor or just a pip? Imo it doesn‚Äôt worth it, but for some people it does. Camping, tunnelling, gen rushing, looping are just strategies(although I don‚Äôt like to call them strategy, they are). Yes they are boring, yes they ruin the game for both sides(as a fun perspective). I even witnessed a survivor hiding the whole game, did nothing and escape(I was playing survivor as well). When I said most undeserved hatch escape, he was like ‚Äúescaping is the most important thing, sometimes being selfish is ok‚Äù(I don‚Äôt exactly remember what he said). It is clear that ‚Äúwinning‚Äù condition for him is to escape. Personally I don‚Äôt care about escaping or get a 4k. It‚Äôs nice to accomplish those, pipping is enough for me. But it definitely doesn‚Äôt worth ruining others game to ‚Äúwin‚Äù.
---
I went through the window because it was my only option of course she would've anticipated that, also I can't run with my camera looking behind me all the time especially in such a crowded house.
---

---
That's my entire point, i didn't know who the killer was at that stage so I couldn't have anticipated it
---
They nerfed it. Not just a revoke. Look at those percentages!!!  The perk is garbage even more now. I think they saw what would happen with a sloppy butcher and 24% than and said ruin it is
---
I was joking bout how creepy Legion looks in this screenshot, I really wanted to look like this tbqh lol
---
Adrenaline is such a kick in the balls for killers. It's like when you're about to beat the final boss and suddenly they change form.
---
"just to be sure"
---
It does, they work on gens 50% slower and the skillcheck regresses the gen by a decent amount. Check out the guide dude, it'll teach you how to play freddy better than I can.
---
Where the slowing generator perks outside of an iffy devour hope, than which is terrible and of course ruin which only sometime. Works at higher levels?  I guess the new plagues perk is meant to take ruins place by blocking certain gens for a period of time. Sort of works like ruin. Blocks it for probably the length of time it took to find ruin or less.
---
Picture looks like he's straight-up punching her in the cooch
---
The first five times you play against a killer it will tell you tips about them. After that though its a guessing game until you get your tell in game.

I know. I am a Freddy main. I just can't wait for his rework. It better be good. OR AT LEAST DECENT! 
---
What a find!
---
I always figured it'd be cheaper to get the MTV characters because they're cheaper it's why we got Quentin and Remake Freddy 
---
It's not a waste if you use it. You could say all hex totems are a waste if survivors immediately seek them out. Just different play styles. I'm not trying to put you down for playing differently than me,  I'd appreciate it if you'd show me the same respect.
---
True. Both killers are also the only ones with hooks and wires piercing their thicc bro arms
---
Yes please.
---
I think plague is pretty bad tbh, her sickness doesnt do enough and she has to go out of her way to get corrupt purge.
---
Yeah I get it. Majority of the time the killer gets more kills then 1 because of what I did, people just not leaving when you see someone go down in one hit and I know it's not always like that tho. I just personally think noed is fine, it has counters and the end game is pretty rough for killer as it is without it so I understand why people use it
---
Article #376 To Be Exact
---
Legion was an off brand scream, a bunch of murderous teens with innate masks. I doubt we will get scream
---
Nope. Yet another way the devs fucked Freddy over.
---
Or just go after the one who unhooked instead of the person who had no choice in the matter...
---
Yes, let‚Äôs add more RNG into a game. That screams balance 
---
Oh yea buddy, and Blood Warden with that is just noice
---
Wow ok thanks for the in depth response
---
Nah. It's a great mechanic, and it's working exactly as intended. Nerfing it would make cleansing dull totems less attractive, and the average match would go even quicker. 
---
Have never actually caught one of his streams so I sadly can't have an informed opinion on him. However from what it sounds like he's using "sweaty" as more of a description of the game state than trying to denigrate the other players.
---
And that's perfectly fine! This game is intense, it causes huge swings in your mood in seconds. So to be playing in a more relaxed manner, and suddenly realize you need to put on your big boy/girl pants because shit is getting real is definitely when someone has to get "sweaty". 
---
It's when there's this level of scorn that the other players in the game are "wrong" by playing in a manner that emphasizes winning that I take issue with.
---
That was the argument i used against cannibal but here we are.
---
why is your vault on Q?
---
If this makes survivors DC, then I will get it
---
Porn is great.
---

You have to get 12 hooks for 8k sacrifice. You got 10.
---
Stop making a chopped up corpses look attractive. Good work though.
---
I'm gonna be real, that's a terrible example. There was no interplay between him and them in what he just explained.
---
The entire team quit after he used their critical mistake (hookdiving the obsession) to put them all in a bad spot, and the only person getting anything there was the guy on the hook.
---
I don't think he should have held back in this instance, especially if he brought a Mori. Everyone knows when the match starts what's up.

Interesting, I have a few killer messages. One of them told me I'm on his "shit list" because I abuse pallets.
---
Motherfucker, there's 8 pallets on the map. I'm gonna use them as efficiently as possible.
---
He isn‚Äôt a strong end game killer, that‚Äôs why all his perks are designed to help his end game. 
---
I almost always use it with Lithe - when Lithe ends Dance with ends as well :D It may be ultra strong on Lery's.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt use it, it‚Äôs abandoned. 
---
I dont play killer alot, but when i do i only kill people who use flashlights excessively. Its nice to get a break from the toxic killer games that our community provides so i like to give people a break
---
I can't decide what's better:
---
The thicc severed thighs or the Adam keychain 
---
I see that you figured it out! I wrote back. :)
---
There are plenty, no worries!
---
This video certainly made me a lot better at playing killer. I didn't realize how many tiles I was running in the survivors favor until watching this. 
---
Yeah, there's still over 100 left.
---
Hahaha üòÖ my bad
---
Im trying to be a bit cryptic since I have a lot of potential paths but I definitely like the potential idea of a pier! Im glad you dig it! I appreciate it :)

Thank you so much!

killer blind does not equal drop
---
Idk why huntress isn‚Äôt at the top. Could you imagine: four kids find a cabin to rest after their car breaks down. They enter it and all seems at ease. One eventually finds a little trap door and finds tens of corpses of skinny little girls attached by the wrist to the wall, a few ones that seem alive but close to death. There‚Äôs not enough time to think about that though, because there‚Äôs footsteps overhead. 
---
Insert super tall butch lady with rabbit mask and hatchet attempting to comfort one of the crying survivors. She goes back up stairs. The people try to comfort the kid and end up freeing her. The rest of the movie goes with them trying to escape throughout the forest. Obv three get killed in gruesome and inventive ways. Maybe a animal trap that hangs one in the air until she catches them, maybe the other one get killed by getting a hatchet thrown against that pins them to a tree, and then getting the hatchet dragged through their gut, etc etc. the last survivor and the girl both get a truck and riding on the back of it in a Texas chainsaw massacre scene . Huntress chases after them, huffing and letting out little sobs. She tosses one last hatchet and hit the survivor in the chest as they ride away and she collapses into tears. We‚Äôre left with a scene of the survivor and the little girl sitting in the back of truck, unknowing if their going to survive, as we fade into darkness.
---
I really like thinking about huntresses movies. Like, they‚Äôd just be so badass.
---
I wish you the best on your project as well! It can definitely be daunting but just pushing forward will make great things for both of us :)

Thank you for sharing.  I was playing about half of these correctly but it‚Äôs very good to know which I was doing wrong and how to do them better.
---
2017 Freddy was kinda messed up doe
---
You got it Spoony! Definitely hoping to get this all wrapped up in the coming months. Sooner hopefully than later. And that would be pretty nifty xD "Impossible" dream but never know!
---
Feck off pimpboy, wasnt asking you xD
---
I still have not buy Feng :'( and no Lithe on weekly temple
---
I know, but I clearly timed it right, even getting a blind after he had started to turn. I have been playing for quite some time and this entire thing felt off; I know how to flashlight save
---
I agree I could have won games if grabs worked 
---
Also we deduced he had surveillance. In fact, he only had surveillance 1
---
Just got back from work and saw all these comments. I appreciate you all providing your thoughts and support! It's been crazy putting this altogether but the passion from this game, the devs and the community are just major pieces of inspiration pouring into this everyday. I will definitely try to be posting some more updates in the coming week and would love some more feedback to make it the best it can possibly be :)
---
Thank you everyone!
---
I'll take that as a no then. I'll just do it when your not lookin then
---
When it's a genuinely good Billy, but they still have Ruin and instasaw... ZZZ

We need enough time to make it to both doors and hope lasts 120 20 seconds so it must be improved. It‚Äôs a great perk but not where it‚Äôs at now timer wise
---
He didn't plot against his father so much as his father was delusional and ordered him to essentially sabotage his own empire.
---
A Trapper film would work best out of all of them imo.  It would be about some of the miners, having to deal with an increasingly delusional boss and his disturbingly sociopathic son. The brutality builds up until the workforce is sealed inside the mine, with the protagonist narrowly escaping the estate

It's time to stop

I had to play some Spirit for rituals. She's only level 1 but I just run Rancor on her. It's so fun

Am I the only one who thinks that Auric Cells shpuld be rewarded? Not a lot, like maybe brown ranks get none, yellow 5, green 10, purple 20, and red 50. Thismay be too little, just a base tho, and honestly, how hard can that be to add to the game...?

Well since you've shown you have no understanding how words work or what "nerf"/"buff", "freaking out", "ranting" actually mean I guess we can call it here. Because the only thing that's silly here is trying to get through to someone who has their own made up definitions for things.
---
dals
---
You have a strange definition of ‚Äúwell.‚Äù Doing gens and escaping is the survivors job- by doing that more often, you are, objectively, doing better than when you were more concerned with how impressively you could taunt the killer.

---
I've played other games where players think you should let them win but none are as bad as Dead by Daylight. The amount of times I've sarcastically said "So I'm not supposed to kill as Killer?" and gotten people genuinely tell that yes I shouldn't kill as Killer just makes me laugh.
---
Games like Hearthstone or Town of Salem you might ocassionally get people who want you to take pitty on them or grant a mutal win. (In the case of ToS people will often lynch the Jester or kill an Executioner's target before killing the last Mafia Member / Townie so that more players can win.) In Dead by Daylight it's considered the norm by some people for the opposing player to just give up for no reason other than you said so.
---
It sort of is
---
"I consider myself above the average person."
---
yeah, at the time you also couldnt see freddy during transition and the lullaby (still is) was not directional, you literally got a free hit as freddy so the slow down they showed was a way to give you some sort of fair chance.
---
\-So you want to make it almost impossible to wake up? The 2 primary ways of waking up are generator repair checks and healing skill checks.  Removing these would be ridiculous
---
\-Letting an invisible killer just be able to grab seems pretty bad.
---
\-If Freddy gets those buffs would likely have to receive some nerfs.  Yes he is the weakest killer but the difference in Kill Rates between him and most Killers is only a couple % points. Statistically he is only a tiny bit behind the majority of killers.

Yeah üòÇ I had to!

How come Purple Flashlights are in here?  I thought they were still OP according to Killer Mains
---
Dear God
---
Thanks.
---
Yeah you play survivor and you know....try to survive and the killers get pissed off and salty at you for it.
---
Sorry but I must have missed the part in the tutorial that said after 2 pallets I need to stop running and let the killer get me.
---
I've never gotten a message from a killer. But I have gotten 10000 from bitch survivors.
---
I've been trying to do a level 14 daily with the Huntress, obviously sucking, and been stuck in the game for 15 minutes because they won't leave. They just want to teabag and act like they won the super bowl
---
I would just use your main with a farming build to get all the BPs you can, and then level up whichever killers you'd like to unlock their teachables. 
---
There are tons of great perks, just depends on the builds you want and what your style of game play is. 
---
Gen grabbing without beads only works on potatoes aha. Sounds like he‚Äôs another shitty killer crying survivors are op.
---
Ruin almost mandatory 
---
bUt He'S tHe MoSt BaLaNcEd KiLlEr

I am glad someone feels the same way I do about it

Yes but you have to think the potential they might have, if say, they weren‚Äôt taken and show is them trying to cover up the murder
---
yes. i am l1 right after and it just makes the sound of an insta but nothing happens but the medkit disappears
---
I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt put her at great
---
Part of being a better scrub-tier killer is knowing when you are getting outlooped, and then walking away to go get the other, probably more poor looper teammates doing gens.
---
But man when you juke a tbagging, flashlight clicking b-hole and they DC as you pick em up. Fucking better than sex lol
---
Yes
---
&gt; almost impossible to wake up?
---
This some dramatic fucking shit you have right here
---
Also, I never said that I'm removing waking up with gen repair checks. So stop fucking being disingenuous. And healing is replaced with sabo checks
---
&gt; Letting an invisible killer just be able to grab seems pretty bad.
---
What? Do you know that Freddy has a terror radius? You might not. Hey, just so you know, Freddy has a terror radius. If you're by the hatch and hear it, you shouldn't jump in.
---
&gt; If Freddy gets those buffs would likely have to receive some nerfs.
---
"if you do what it takes to fix Freddy then please make him trash again so that us survivors can have it easy"
---
So the show could expand on that
---
you have to plan ahead your path - make sure youre ALWAYS looping pallets, and if not, then you‚Äôre running to the next pallet or into a jungle gym to loop. try to use pallet stuns / killers breaking pallets to give you time to break line of sight and sneak away. 
---
Oink
---
what if he smacked you with the balls on his chin and then gave the clasic peter griffin laugh
---
Ok?
---
Replicate it in game and submit a support ticket to the devs.
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
---
If you're talking about that, that is a ping issue. That commonly happens when a survivor is disconnecting and you try to grab them, they're "lagging" so hard that you can't grab them. When they disconnect like that, their ping jumps to 999.
---
About that bit about insta-heals being taken out of the game: maybe, just maybe, the survivors shouldn't be as strong as the killer.
---
i don‚Äôt understand why flashlight clicking is toxic, i‚Äôm just saying hi to the killer ;_;
---
I got mine with Judiths and got lucky because of the 2 last survivors only one had enough for me to stalk them and his teammate healed him off slug in front of me so I morid her then the meg sat next to me because she thought I would let her live and I killed her too.
---
NOED and adrenaline are both fine perks they don‚Äôt need any changes. 
---
A ranking system that actually sorts players of relatively equal skill into games with each other IS the reward. The only thing adding rewards on top of that does -- especially if they're exclusive -- is bring on an avalanche of bad players tagging along with better ones to pip high enough to get them, which defeats, let's see, the entire purpose of making ranking up harder?
---
So because they get gen yanked they Dc and magically the gen completes and they run off? 
---
Noed bad, gib upvotes 
---
That's how you're supposed to play anyway. Down the unhooked Survivor and chase the farming Survivor.
---
Sure, the guy gets his DS if you pick him up but he's going to get picked up anyway since you just slugged him for the other guy. 
---
Slugged Survivor can't do gens. The guy you're chasing can't do gens and someone who's going to heal him can't do gens. Let's say it's SWF so they know he has DS so they don't go to heal him. He *still* can't do gens until you pick him up.
---
Literally, the only downside of hitting him first is that the farmer gets a few second headstart. But just because Sprint Burst gives people a few seconds headstart doesn't mean you can't catch them.
---
So much wrong with what you posted:
---
-So only Survivors with Tool boxes would not be screwed or are you now changing the entire game to allow Sabo as a default action? Removing the 2 primary ways people wake up is just absurd.
---
-Yeah, because a Terror Radius will let you know if you are in grab range or not, rolls eyes.  For a smart Survivor though nothing would change. They would just sit there until the Freddy hit them to make sure they get the hatch and avoid be grabbed.
---
-Fixing a character that is only a tiny bit weaker does not mean gigantic changes, it means slight changed like changing the transition time from 7 seconds to 6 seconds, not making it ridiculously hard to wake up.  Won't even mention making it super hard to wake up would make Freddy even less fun to play against than he is now since many find the look on the screen of the dream world super annoying
---
Same here, I love the no mither and resilience combo. I think no mither should give you 100% bloodpoints 
---
Yeah, I have an art account on instagram @mokachristina 
---
I know what youre talking about, it's usually due to a disconnect, either way, it is still a ping issue. If you start the animation and you don't get the pull, it's a connection issue. 
---
The last three times on Mt Ormond, I haven‚Äôt spawned in the killer shack. I feel cheated now.  
---
Which then leads the question of why is this not hotfixed, why is reworking chase mechanics not a high priority, why is this not reportable.
---
The base chance for unhooking yourself (without the deliverance perk) is 4%. Respecting the 4% means that the killer will let you live (or doesnt down and rehook you if you catch the survivor in the act of unhooking him or herself.)
---
Well yeah because they have spawn points. My issue is that no other spawn point is being used
---
Very nice! I really like this ^_^
---
Claudette, but make it fashun 
---
Above my pay grade tbh but it's an issue. It's really not okay

Except I did. But I replied to a specific post.

Try reading comprehension, it's a great skill.

This type of stuff isnt recent. Its always happened, whether you have encountered it or not

Anytime I now close my eyes, all I can see is this picture and laugh

Yes actually, I found a trapper doing it lol
---
lmfao you're a fuckingidiot
---
&gt;And as a separate issue, how the fuck are devs still allowing totems to spawn with their dicks out right in the open in killer shacks?
---
Devs are literally fixing this right now. It's ok to not know stuff. Don't feel bad.
---
This is what I replied to, not your wildly unbelievable OP. 
---
I HATE CAMPING ASS KILLERS ITS FOUR PEOPLE IN THE MATCH BUT YOU INSIST ON STAYING ON JUST ONE PERSON NOT YOUR OBSESSION, NOT THE PERSON DESTROYING HOOKS, AND DEFINITELY NOT THE MAIN PERSON UNHOOKING OTHER SURVIVORS JUST THE ONE PERSON WHO RAN INTO YOU BY ACCIDENT I HOPE YOU ALL BURN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!  
---
Indeed it does!
---
Oh the ironing.
---
lmfao you worthless piece of shit survivor main
---
it literally just happened a 4th time
---
anyway drink bleach
---
Someone has sand I their vagina lol
---
Just out of curiosity, what are you expecting then from a survivor you gave ~~head~~ hatch? If a ty or a variety of isnt good enough, then I have been insulted on many occasions and have insulted even more people...
---
How could you post something so controvercial yet so brave?
---
do you need help with the bleach? where are you?
---
dae misogyny lololol
---
he was a slugging machine. being healed didn't wake you up, adren didn't wake you up. and healing off the floor took forever. He was basically kitted out to just hit people down, and slug them until it was a 4k. 
---
Breakdown, Deliverance, Decisive (new or old), and self-care, but you never get hit even once the whole match.
---
I hear ya man it‚Äôs rough. 
---
Good stuff how about you do one for Huntress or hag
---
why are you so mad that you're cocking a handgun because someone said a perk is bad?
---
I genuinely think that Dead By Daylight might have one of the most consistently dumb communities I've ever seen.
---
Not everybody in it, obviously, by damn the vocal minority is loud, and damn is it stupid.
---
Until you get a free hook...?
---
They look awesome?
---
And if MrGrand2-0 doesn't like it, he can post saying to chill!
---
Let's get this train chuggin!
---
Tue
---
Yeah, they're really there to fluff up the bloodweb, and pay themselves back when you use them. Compare that to the brown mist offerings, which do all but nothing.
---
But I'm glad they exist. If there were no "throw-away" offerings, people would naturally horde them, waiting to use them until they "really need them". Then, 200 hours later, they've got 15 of every offering and are still going into trials naked.
---
so easy to counter survivor, now you can stop crying killer? ty
---
You do raise a good point. Maybe, I was hasty to judge based on how survivors in current red ranks feel and how they could become much better and that would be nice. To know the skill level of my team was equal or close. However, I still would like to see seasonal rewards, even if it was just shards or bloodpoints. (No one needs a bunch of cosmetics pumped out every month and they already supply a ton of content and cosmetics.) Especially because the new system will require players to step their individual skills up if they want to get to and maintain red ranks. Meaning that players, most likely, won't be able to carry their bad team mates to ranks they don't deserve like they can now.
---
Yeah man, how dare you do the objective! Survivors are so OP, you should start on the hook and 4% yourself off before you can do a gen. Lol.
---
I mean I definitely wouldn't sneeze at rewards either, but first I'm desperate for them to get these crouching, terrified morons who couldn't hit a Hex skill check if their life depended on it out of my games. 
---
I look at the survivor in embarrassment like ''You didn't see that..''
---
Yes. The killer can do that, it is the only way to counter the window.
---
However, if the killer does that, the survivor can run away, and gain a massive amount of distance, to the point that its not worth chasing them any more.
---
Not likely lol, no one hides in lockers. You will just be wasting your time.
---
1, 3 and 5 aren't needed, whats the point of a faster transition if you already cant do anything (assuming this suggestion comes live). 2 and 4 are nice buffs but they could use some tweaking
---
I'd imagine it's easier to fix with dedicated servers, than fix it now and then probably solve it later again anyway
---
NOED and Adrenaline are both situational perks that dont need to be tweaked
---
You mean template so we can repost it for more karma!!!
---
Freddy. Much more of a dominating personality; where as David is like ‚ÄúI can take any amount of pain!‚Äù
---
Slightly less awful.  He didn't slow himself down as much when transitioning people and his lullaby range was a bit smaller. Most notably being healed when downed and popping adrenaline didn't wake survivors up.
---
He's never been good; annoying or frustrating to play against, but not good.  At the end of the day he's always been a base movement speed killer who has to wait 7 seconds to do what comes naturally to other killers. He's never been able to defend gens, totems or hooks well and has never had anything that helps him win chases.
---
Yup, happens to me all the time unfortunately.

---
Yeah, in a game like this you have to think about the psychological aspect from the other side. As much as you can be good at looping every single pallet and piss off the killer, they can make your game suck at very little cost to themselves.
---
Lol end game builds arent his strengths and the 7 seconds matter little to nothing. Not surprised its your first time playing freddy 
---
how about no lol. blood warden is cool rn so no need for double the time, and the hatch is a must-have because I don't think any survivor would want to do 3 gens, all by themselves, and then open the exit gates. The killer knows exactly where they are the moment they finish the first gen and then It's game over.
---
Not sure I want come bbq and chili.
---
Servers?
---
Contrarily, it never says you have to be nice to someone because they wasted a lot of your time. These are people you're okaying against, if you don't want someone to hard you personally, don't give them a reason to.
---
As a killer I have a tonne more respect for any player that actually knows how to run and juke, more than the dime a dozen that can run circles of knee high debris because there's a pallet there.
---
Oh you wanted it thick huh??!
---
Yeah it's better when all gens are done now because the other 2 gens that dont do as a survivor give you stacks now too
---
I just think it is cheap, as a survivor main. Just like killers think ds is cheap.
---
His name is Scottjund, definitely check out his streams if you're interested. Super helpful and pretty entertaining 
---
Yeah, I guess. It's just cheap.
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted. I play on xbox and the red ranks are just nonstop Billy Billy Billy Billy Billy... At first I took a break from the red ranks, currently im taking a break from the game in general (cause I always nolife events and burn out after, not just cause of Billy). I was so happy when they introduced the Spirit... killers with mobility are the problem, or rather the lack of. People always talk about how killers suck because their power doesnt shut down loops, but if they gave every killer a ‚Äúcharge 3 seconds to sprint ability‚Äù everyone would be more or less viable and certainly played alot more. The amount of time you do not lose walking across the map and the amount of pr√©sence or mappressure you could put out is crazy. But naaaah, just give one killer insane mobility and top that of with an instadown lol...
---
I guess because one is a limited resource while the other can be used every game if the killer wants.
---
That said just looking at the perk objectively it's not worth a slot to me outside of Freddy games or specific, memey builds. 
---
FaCe CaMpInG iS jUsT pArT oF tHe GaMe.
---
I can hear the beautiful snap sound of that gators trap now. S W E E T B L I S S 
---
Until you're being chased right when the exits are powered and the michael one shots you... I don't thing noed is op by any means, I just thing it is cheap.
---
You are supposed to drop chases as freddy and only chase when you know that you will have it easy. While not chasing anyone try to get rid of pallets and put the most people in the dream world you can. Class photo excels at this.
---
Freddy isnt an agroo killer, he needs strategical play and a good defense to succeed 
---
Technically every perk rewards you for nothing, but I see what you are getting at.
---
I think we'd be more likely to get the millennial garbage, but I think most people would prefer no ghostface to that.
---
Anyone else run in to an issue following the advice for killer shack? I‚Äôve done the moon walk in to shack, but they are camping the window and medium vault and I can‚Äôt get a hit from the doorway to the window before they are through.
---
The no glasses throws me
---
I like it. Great Idea! Also, there would be no speed boost and no totem I assume?
---
OG
---
I know I just like to plug his yt b3cause I feel some people don't know that Scott is Damn. Took me awhile to find out myself
---
I just got cancer from reading that, thanks.
---
Still better than playing against nurse 20 times in a row after rank reset.
---
Sorry the memes cancelled because i don't know how to spell
---
You know this is probably just because players can edit their rank and not get banned for it. Your rank is stored and read in/from your Steam achievement stats, which is really stupid imo. I think they'd be pushing this idea more if your rank was saved server-side like the rest of your savefile so it was much harder to edit without the risk of getting detected and banned. 
---
THE ROOF OF THE KILLER SHACK SENT ME OVER THE EDGE HAHAHA
---
3 is a must actually
---
Killer dictates how to game is run. All survivors can really do is run and hide
---
Take the intense halogen off, genius
---
*Changed Freddy so that he himself can‚Äôt enter the dreamworld*
---
when i tell you i SCREAMED 
---
With a 50% chance of a hex totem being instantly cleansed or impossible to cleanse, we have achieved *perfect balance*.
---
Why would you not just edit your main post and add this to it? 
---
id agree with freddy being weak if people didnt stack double block addons, tunnel survivors and then complain about how shitty he is after using 10% of his power
---
how do you all act like Healing is possible for everyone? It only is if you use Self Care or have a Med Kit and you can still wake up from Gens or by other people
---
If you really enjoy this game go ahead and buy leather face a.k.a  ‚ÄúThe Cannibal‚Äù and unlock his teachable perk ‚Äúbarbecue and chili‚Äù  gives you a lot of blood points
---
What you mean with they have spawn points?
---
The HEX Totem will ALWAYS be in the same area on EVERY single map in the game, its a bug right now.
---
Nothing to do with the spawn points of the dull totems...
---
It's actually the complete opposite. Survivors dictate how the game is run, all killers can do is react. If 4 survivors hop on separate gens from the very beginning and the first survivor found is a decent Looper it's basically a GG. 
---
I never said they shouldn't.
---
If you however meant that your point is insta-heals make survivors just as strong as killers, that's a rather vague statement that has no real quantifiable value to it that I could readily identify. I'd have multiple issues with that statement. First, what does "strong" entail, exactly? If it means strong in a sense of competitive balance, are you arguing the balance should favour killers, and aim for 3-4 kills as an ideal, instead of 2? And if it isn't about balance, which of the killers do insta-heals make the survivors just as strong as? Just any killer with any perk, add-on and offering loadout? Regardless of the players, even? Regardless of how many survivors have an insta-heal? I have personally hardly ever seen a full lobby with every single survivor bringing an insta-heal, for instance. I think that's quite rare an occurrence indeed.
---
And so on. So if that's the point you are trying to make and discuss, I'd need more than that initial statement. If your point is insta-heals are BS and should be reworked, well, I think so too. My point was just that Moris are also BS and should also be reworked.
---
You're gonna go down but you're 1 of 4 people on a TEAM, act like one. Run bond to stay away from teammates. Or have Kindred so your team knows whats going on. Run Empathy so you know where to stay away from to not get steamrolled. Run OoO to keep them at a distance (best paired with bond). Bring a toolbox. Use exhaustion perks to stall just that bit longer. Open Handed with any of your aura perks makes it all work that much more. All valid things to do. Remember, there's 4 of you if you're not a coward. 
---
He DC'd when he saw Legion

No one said he was bad he‚Äôs an easy killer to play that takes 0 skill to use with high profit

---
I‚Äôm a former pre 3 pig main (switched to spirit cuz I like her design)  
---
Some pointers I can give you:
---
Don‚Äôt tunnel survivors with an entire rbt on their head. Sure, it will guarantee their death, but traps will slow down generator progress since survivors are focused on getting their hat off, and that‚Äôs how they are best used
---
Also save one rbt for after the generators are done. I have gone from 1k to 2-3k by punishing altruistic survivors who try to stay in the game to help out that one survivor stuck with a trap countless times. However if you run NOED survivors will leave their friend behind out of fear so don‚Äôt run NOED. 
---
Pig is a very fun killer, and also sorry for the run on sentences in this post I‚Äôm half asleep making it.  
---
Hope I helped. 
---
Yeah true, When I first found his channel I saw a lot of people commenting on his videos calling him Scottjund and I was just soo confused 
---
I don‚Äôt really think Frank forced them to do it... in a way. From the beginning he was a sociopath, a manipulator, and I think he managed to get that evil out of them, one way or another. Joey was probably the easiest as it said he was ‚Äòimpulsive‚Äô so Frank could easily bring out some sort of ‚Äòevil‚Äô in him. Julie was, like you said, madly in love with Frank and she would do what he did, making it easy for Frank to get what he wanted. Susie‚Äôs story was probably the scariest. She was the popular girl and got roped into doing things she never wanted to do before, but I think she snapped once the entity got to her and her friends at the store they robbed before they were taken by the Mist. If none of the others had any evil in them, the Entity wouldn‚Äôt have taken them.
---
S-should I still get DS?
---
It was a match where killer was bugged standing in one spot attacking endlessly so we all just screwed around lol
---
Add another panel where the guy survives the fall but exploiting a bug. 
---
Don't worry, the subreddit seems to have a warped perception of what exactly skill is in this game. I've been downvoted in the past for saying survivor requires no skill other than in chases, DbDC *is* the chase, doing gens is just holding M1, skill checks aren't hard, etc.
---
You are completely correct and don't let this sub tell you otherwise. I've noticed the same thing. Going against a killer I can loop for all game doesn't allow me to do anything else and therefore I don't pip, it's the disadvantage to simply being good at the game and a caveat of how the ranking system currently works. 
---
Some people don't get the whole "Know thine enemy" philosophy. I'd be scared of survivors if they weren't usually so pigheaded. 
---
MY MISTAKE YOURE RIGHT. RIP MY MORI DAILIES.
---
I try to initiate a friendly farm game to get that one, ngl. Sometimes I can get Survivors to mess around at the end of the match when the doors are open too. It usually works, and considering I have never leveled Trapper in my life, it's pretty much the only way I get that daily.
---
The top two, honestly cannot agree more that they should have movies. God they should give them a short movie eventually just for the community. I would honestly pay a lot of money for a decent quality one. Wraith and hag especially.
---
Should've been lettuce-head hag, not trapper
---
alternative facts: DS and flashlight aren't toxic, survivors can be toxic/your skin is as thick as a tissue.
---
That‚Äôs why I just tell everyone I have deliverance to let me unhook someone and to not unhook me unless I‚Äôm struggling
---
Personally its not fun as a killer either, people dc in the beginning simply because I found them fast and then the rest of the match is boring
---
Legion lol
---
When You Start Your Sprint Burst You Get A Few Frames Where You Can't Be Hit. It's A Bug That's Been Around For A While &amp; Seems To Want To Stick Around.
---
Also, No. You type how you type, I'll Type How I Type.
---
Survivors are the reason the game isn't as successful as it could be. No mither is toxic.

How you look thinking this meme is only upvotes for the joke and note the obvious effort
---
All of those give you a huge warning before you get oneshot.
---
DH is the only one that doesn't but anyone can find the hex before they get three hooks.
---
Noed is the only one where you just have to guess whether they have it or not. (Or just assume they always do). Finding and cleansing 5 totems by yourself isn't a reasonable thing to expect someone to do every game. It just takes too much time.
---
If I want to *assure* that noed will not activate I will have to *at least find* all 5 totems. (Regardless if they are cleansed already) Even if I cleanse 4 totems I can't just assume my teammates have found/cleansed the last totem. Imagine all 4 Survivors needing to find all 5 totems so each of them, individually, knows that noed won't activate.
---
The only solution to this is to at least add a totem counter. (Similar to the gen counter).
---
When I first started the game a year ago it was cool reference site but it's very outdated and it doesn't take into  effect all the changes that have occurred with perks and killers
---
Operation Health is basically a 3 month period...
---
There are perks and items that help find totems, as you should always assume a killer has bbq you should also assume NOED. 
---
You're not being punished. If you could unhook in that situation, every killer could just stay and wait with you on last hook, planning to smack/chainsaw you back down.
---
Do you really think the killer is gonna leave you unattended while you still have the ability to unhook yourself?
---
Is that Dwight!
---
I think this is very much how it should be in DBD. I would leave the innate perks the same, but the teachable versions should all be nerfed slightly.
---
This would make for a much more interesting meta, and a lot of crappy perks now might actually be worthwhile when you were playing their character. It might actually make diverse types of builds worthwhile, rather than silly gimmicks. The current system we have is "Are you joking around? Here's a half dozen silly builds. Are you playing seriously? Pick your exhaustion perk, heal perk, aura perk, and utility perk."
---
I miss the moonlight offerings even though they gave me an aneurysm
---
What about if I have dead hard? What about if the hatch spawned directly in front of me? What if the killer just isn‚Äôt thinking and decides to run off and kick gens/pallets for more points?
---
I love your use of color! It's very dreamy.
---
Gotta admit, I took the bait knowingly and without regret tonight to tunnel and Mori a guy with an Ochido username. I may have only gotten 1k. I may have displeased the Entity, but that finger is mine now and the children are safe. 
---
I'm already following you! I try to watch whenever I can! Thanks for sharing your creativity with us. 
---
Lol?
---
\*Reads first line\* Definitely an August PS plus player, no but for real tho no time is worse then mid to late 2017, From my experience Killer is boring as shit because im too good/survivors are trash, i play ps4 and i can still consistantly 4k as nurse and huntress, survivor is my problem, like what you said at the end, they are all fkn stupid and the killer tunnels me because im the one making them angry for running them around for so long.

You played using your brain. Don't apologize.
---
If I had a dollar for every time I get salty messages for dc'ing when it was my modem going out. 
---
Depending on how they implement dedicated servers, lag switching could still be a problem.
---
Look at PUBG for example, where a lagging player can shoot someone at their position from 3 seconds earlier, and the victim scratches his head wondering how he was getting shot by the same guy after putting 5 layers of cover between himself and the shooter.
---
If BHVR does it as badly as Bluehole did it, lag switching will be as powerful as ever. Hopefully they are smart enough not to do that.
---
Forcing Survivors to take a perk for a perk that the Killer may or may not have is an unreasonable argument.
---
Killers complain about DS but you can just take Enduring and then you can eat every single one *and* it's still useful in other ways. Yet, DS is still getting nerfed.
---
There are no items that allow you to find totems unless the totem counts as one of "The Killer's belongings." I can't bring a map and a specific add-on every single game.
---
Looking like a snack...
---
Can it retract and extend?
---
Honestly I just recently hit rank 1 and I was excited at first then I realized all I was getting was long ass cue times and toxic survivors :(
---
As a killer main:
---
1. I can counter dead hard by standing right behind you while hitting you.
---
2. If hatch spawns there I would not let you go till struggle.
---
3. At rank 5 or so you can't use deliverance when you are alone because (almost) every killer knows that deliverance exists.
---
Was a bitch on season five, I‚Äôm gonna make it right, give me a generator and I‚Äôll repair it how you like 
---
Working on that currently, I‚Äôm attempting to fix a string around the end to pull it in.
---
He‚Äôs comin‚Äô
---
Tonight yes. Not usually though. I just switched to killer. 
---
Just chase them out. They only want attention. Only ignore it when you have other priorities, if you lost just chase them out. You can only depip once per game
---
Soooo... always
---
I'm a winner!
---
No you're not.
---
I'm less of a loser!
---
There you go.
---
Sounds like you get hooked a lot üòÇ
---
Sure. You could also have an instaheal ready, or crouch the swing with Urban Evasion.
---
Go stabby-stab some Claudettes.
---
More like how killers on this reddit look telling solo survivors to just get all the totems
---
Most if not all of the story-driven ones are.
---
IF YOU ARE UNLOCKING A GATE AND SOMEONE RUNS UP AND STARTS T-BAGGING, EMOTING SPAM,  SHAKING SIDE TO SIDE AND JUST GOING CRAZY NEXT TO YOU! THEN MAYBE THEY HAVE A DAILY TO OPEN THE DARN THING SO GET THE HELL OFF OF IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DAILY! 
---
IT TOOK ME 4 HOURS OF PLAYING A SURVIVOR I DON'T MAIN TO GET THE DOOR OPEN! EITHER WE JUST NEVER MADE IT TO ENDGAMES BECAUSE RANK RESET PUT ME WITH LEGIT POTATOES! OR BY THE TIME WE GET GENS DONE, OH HEY KILLER HAS NOED, RANCOR(NOT RUNNING OBSESSION BUILD BUT STILL END UP OBSESSION), MORI, FACECAMPS, TUNNELS, I GET FARMED, 5 BLINK NURSES, ONLY 3 PEOPLE LOADED IN, EVERYONE LOADED IN BUT SOMEONE DCED BECAUSE THEY GOT FOUND FIRST! 
---
LOWER RANKS, OMG DO SOMETHING! IF YOU WANNA HAVE A FUN TIME TURN BOND ON AT LOW RANKS AND WATCH THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS CROUCH HIDE AROUND THE DAMN MAP! I WAS WATCHING THESE TWO AND I CLEANSED A TOTEM, GOT CHASED BY KILLER THROUGH 1 GEN AND THEY LET ME GET HALFWAY THROUGH 2ND STAGE BEFORE MOVING FROM THEIR HIDING SPOT!
---
Better hope you have agitation man
---
It was 110
---
My theory is this
---
The entity was only after frank but when the others followed him they were unintentionally taken as well and they were all accidentally fused into one body
---
The entity probably thought oh well that was unexpected but I‚Äôll just have they go after survivors like this out of curiosity.
---
The entity likely didn‚Äôt see that coming and thought of it as a happy little accident 
---
I think the devs should look at all of these posts and decide to change NOED back to how it was on release to show everyone that they are listening but don't want to do anything about it.
---
I agree this is a good suggestion 
---
Sorry, no one can beat Myers Jackson. Cool tho.

This pic never gets old 
---
2 pip celebrations are oversaturated
---
Console Casual Nurse Player here.
---
Nurse isn‚Äôt that hard on console.
---
&gt;And perks that counter perks are what make the meta.
---
What meta (Since, as you said, counter perks make up the meta) perks do people run for the purpose of countering other perks? Meta perks atm are Self-Care, Exhaustion perks, Adrenaline, DS, BT. None of these inherently counters any Killer perks.
---
Killer meta is BBQ, Nurses, Sloppy Butcher, Noed, SpirtFury+Enduring, Ruin, Whispers, Bamboozle.
---
Any other perks would be considered off-meta. No one takes these perks to counter other perks. They take them because they counter Killer/Survivor mechanics, not their perks. The *only* perk that counters Survivor perks inherently is Sloppy Butcher countering Self-Care.
---
&gt;there more than enough second chance perks for survivors
---
Perks that aren't directly related to noed are irrelevant to the discussion. I never argued that DS is balanced or Adrenaline or any other "second-chance" perks.
---
&gt;Noed has counters and it is fine the way it is.
---
Another bad argument. Just because something *has* counters doesn't mean it's balanced. You have to define the degree of counter (is it a soft-counter or hard-counter? How hard does it counter it? Does countering it effect other aspects of the game? (Such as cleansing and or finding all 5 totems taking an ubsurb amount of time for each Survivor to do individually)). I can use that argument structure for any perk.
---
DS/Adrenaline/Exhaustion have counters and are is fine the way they are. :)
---
Ever gotten one with devour hope as well? 
---
i think they're talking about help when playing as her, not against
---
Rainbow Six did this. Spent three months with hardly any new content to fix the game:
---
\*Bows\* 
---
God this is such a bad meme
---
It‚Äôs true lmao
---
I used to think that was a valid answer to noed but it just takes way too long to get all 5 even with small game
---
Turning a game around? Killers can‚Äôt do that. A Hillbilly just chases a survivor... but a survivor finding a purple flashlight, or getting an infinite loop spot, having adrenaline, BT, DS, that‚Äôs all turning the game around. Killers game changing ability‚Äôs can all become obsolete. NOED or Ruin? Can be taken away. Their ability‚Äôs? Aren‚Äôt gonna turn a game around UNLESS a survivor fucks up, but that‚Äôs not the killer turning the game around is it? Please tell us a way in which the killers can turn the game around, if a survivor has to make a mistake for that to work well that‚Äôs not the killer doing anything is it.

It‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre survivor friends, and they‚Äôre waiting to find out who you‚Äôll go towards first so that person can tell the others.

There is no arguement because noed is fine xD not my problem if cleansing 5 totems is just far too difficult.
---
But can you see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
---
*Touches chest sensually*
---
If I get my 4k stack of BBQ I let them all live. 
---
Only real viners will get this
---
It depends if youre playing solo or w friends, if you can communicate the number of totems at all times its a lot easier than doing all of them by yourself.
---
Is there like a guide or something?
---
I wanna get all the totems on the map, but without some guide, I'm sure I'll never find it.
---
Thank You for telling me and I appreciate that I'll make sure not to promote on here 
---
I posted it cause it‚Äôs a legion which is a hard killer to double pip. People also post about their trophies all the time, dumbass.
---
I think the removal policy is "excessive self promotion." So you should be fine.
---
Either way it takes a while, i think it‚Äôs around 50 seconds just to maybe counter a perk that might not even be getting used is ridiculous 
---
Ooof, to me shes super difficult. I cant master the length of the blinks and mostly end up swinging at walls or completely passing the survivor
---
I agree
---
I agree. But ppl will say ‚Äú underpowered killers get a pass‚Äù 
---
A 4.5 second stun everytime we kill a survivor? No thank you.
---
Actually, something I noticed is the killer dailys are way easier than the survivor ones. Kind of weird to think about 
---
and?
---
They should make a skin for the trap and this be the first skin for it
---
What‚Äôs ‚Äúez game babykiller kys unnstall‚Äù in translation?
---
Nice
---
When you hear the ding and think it's a totem but it's actually a phantasm trap
---
I think self healing gives survival points, you have to heal someone other than yourself to get altruism
---
Yaaas, You lose so much of your points and 625 for the dc doesn't cover it at all. Hell I had games where this SWF group dced after each one I downed. 
---
Sadly there is a lot of momentum lost when you run bbq and they dc before hook because a lot of times it's the only tracking perk you have so now you just have this chase they led no where and very little clues as to where anyone else might be so it's like restarting the game from from the start only this time they have fewer gens. So I'd be okay if it did prompt an aura even if it's not their first hook. To combat the whole "Imma dc so my buddy can find hatch, with no risk." and make that kinda play less rewarding.
---
Pretty much what had happened to me after I was playing a game as Wraith each person I whacked disconnected instantly. 
---
That's a pretty cool perk idea. Incredibly useful for those who don't hide at all and prefer to juke. 
---
I'm not having any issues around rank 15

If 60 out of 80 seconds that a gen takes isnt a long time I dunno what you're talking about. What this means is that it suffers the same problem as old decisive where you literally cannot pick them up. If I had the unlimited time decisive due to chase and down I would body block super hard for the unhooker. If the killer found me in the 50th second of 60 seconds now I can do an entire chase without losing it if I stayed close enough on purpose and if they do manage to down me I will for sure have it.
---
It's a bad idea to make it not tick down in chase or when you're downed. It still gives you an extra hook state. It doesnt matter if you cant do gens because it means that you get 4 hook states if you play it right.
---
I gotta say anybody who suggests this far of a backsep on a needed change clearly only plays survivor.
---
I can help if you have any specific ones ur checking?
---
Here. I'll go ahead and have that from you. TIME TO DIE, FRANKLIN
---
No. We're normal fucking people.
---
I don't think he does, I think he's just not aware of the 'abuse near infinites and point through every window', 'hookfarm, disconnect, and whine', 'everyone dresses the same with instaheals', and 'disconnect to deny BBQ and award hatch'  schools of thought.
---
Don't mori me or my son ever again
---
I feel like people who say this have never been able to accept that DBD is about fun not really serious, I literally do not understand people who get offended by something so minor as some ctrl-spam, honestly most of the time I just take it as a "bring it on bitch", the game is more fun when you're not getting offended on purpose. 
---
Blame Comcast. 
---
Don't fucking tell me what to do.
---
If only she didn't stand like a mannequin now...

Feng is the cutest survivor and you should always give them hatch, don‚Äôt Change my mind.

double pips are oversaturated content.

also legion.

I would imagine once someone is plucked out of the timeline they're just gone from our dimension period 
---
Why would I change your mind if it's literally mine.
---
Well damn, would you look at that. 
---
I scrolled through to see if it was posted recently. And I didn‚Äôt see it. 
---
Should‚Äôve scrolled a little more. 
---
Thanks for letting me know. 
---
yup...when im solo Q survivor people don't do gens, all run from killer at same time in same direction, or loop killer back in chase to hook right as some other chumbawumba finally comes to unhook.
---
This cosmetic would be what it takes for me to go back to a Claudette main
---
Crouch 100% of the time so people think you're a survivor 
---
If it's a true camping bubba in the basement, he'd just leave your body downed for the timer for DS and just follow you crawling away, does waste time though but I think camping Bubbas wouldn't care :P
---
Omgg same xDDD
---
Clearly, we're looking at a Survivor main who doesn't remotely understand our subcommunity. (Don't care if that's not a word)
---
I honestly think you just get downvoted on sight at this point. You think your name might be getting in the way any time you do say something agreeable?
---
Im having the same problem but with both surv and killer
---
the way you type is gunna give me a fucking aneurysm.
---
I don't know if it's clearly, but this post is definitely underinformed.
---
OP, do you want to weigh in?
---
You're implying I care lol. Virtual currency means nothing to me.
---
I was having the same problem as killer. I just sit in a lobby and sometimes one other person will be waiting with me before leaving.
---
I already said it in Discord, but I'll reiterate. 
---
You blow me out of the water with your videos 
---
Very nice work
---
Bad Manners 
---
How long is it taking you to find lobbies and what platform are you on
---
yes

The whole Doofenshmirtz mixed with Squidward face should not work as well as it does

I have a screenshot of the Google image I found it on and I clicked the link to a pinterest post I'll shoot him a message though (idk how to link it honestly) but you can google search dead by daylight claudette and dwight and it pops up
---
Great idea! Why didn't I think of that! "I am a bot"
---
Crows shouldn't be alerted by killers at base, I think. 
---
This is actually awesome
---
Lol I would love a crossover
---
Bots are killers (typically doc) that stand still and constantly swing. What they‚Äôre meant to do is trick stupid survivors into running into them and give them points. It‚Äôs a huge issue and is ruining the game for me. 
---
one sec
---
That's a mimic, run!
---
I did know this part, but I guess I don‚Äôt get whether it‚Äôs an actual person doing it or some kind of program? I‚Äôve never come across it on Xbox in all the time I‚Äôve been playing. 
---
Doc and Feng Min. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely unique. Which is not something I can say about most of the perk ideas posted on this sub.
---
No he ain‚Äôt
---
He‚Äôs only good with certain add ons and perks
---
Maybe instead remove the hindered and do a 4/5/6 second slow to 105/100/95% to the killer after sacrificing. Then they cant catch the next survivor immediately but the killer doesnt have to give up all chase capabilities. 
---
Regardless, it‚Äôs a massive issue on PS4. For example, last time Puppers streamed PS4 with viewers he got a shit ton of bots in his match. He had the luxury of being able to play on PC as a backup but most PS4 players don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where most people, me included, are quitting the game because of it. 
---
Unique =/= good. 
---
Perk idea depends on OPs intentions with this idea. 
---
It's not nerfed.

Oh of course, it should not be happening. It can‚Äôt possibly be fun. I‚Äôm just trying to clarify how it works.

You're an idiot

They changed this.

I literally just got a 2pip with legion right after your earlier comment

Couldn‚Äôt the hindered effect slow it down to that rate too though? There‚Äôs no specific rate I don‚Äôt think. For example huntress‚Äôs yew seed concoction isn‚Äôt as bad as the clowns bottles.

clip and report it with users name post game, thats all you can do

Dead hard still exists
---
I used him with TOTH, Distressing, Ruin and Sloppy Butcher. Smiley Face Pin and the Green Movement Speed addon.

I always upvote spirit art

Swap Billy and spirit, Swap Hag and Michael.

Also what I feel like I always repeat because nobody understand it. Freddy is a good killer, B tier at worst.
---
Prove it. 
---
... This better be for killer.  And even if it is it wouldn't be that good
---
I don't go to that much of an extreme, but if I see two people and one of them is Adam, I target him over the other person. 
---
I just get tired of it when I get 10+ minute queue times. It‚Äôs ruining the game more than legion ever did for me.

It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing. It‚Äôs still shitty, especially since I have 10+ minute queue times.

Don‚Äôt argue with this guy, it‚Äôs common sense at this point.

I REALLY HATE HOW PEOPLE TAUNT AND DISRESPECT THE KILLER AND MAKE HIM DC!!! YOU'RE KILLING THE FUN FOR EVERYONE PLAYING WITH YOU! WE DIDN'T SIT IN A LONG AS LOADING SCREEN JUST FOR YOU TO TAKE IT ALL AWAY FOR YOUR DISGUSTING ENTERTAINMENT!
---
Have you tried killing them?
---
Interesting idea, but I don't think they should/would incentivize slugging. Spending the match on the ground tends to kill the fun for survivors, and bleed-outs and slugging don't award the killer BP or emblems, only a tactical advantage in the right situations.
---
Whom's mans?
---
If I‚Äôm being perfectly honest I would never use this perk.
---
Doing gens, u?

It's a known issue they're currently working on in the PTB if I remember correctly

Dude, it's uninteresting and doesn't contribute to the sub. It says it right there

Is it supposed to be hard? Nurse is S tier bud
---
oh, cool. thanks, i didn't know, thought maybe i'm just a trash killer and OG survivor
---
Hag and Kate/Jeff
---
But... if you don't pip up, doesn't that mean you were not, in fact, good at the game that round?
---
OFTEN I FEEL UNREASONABLY UPSET WHEN I PLAY AS SURVIVOR AND TELL THE LOBBY THAT I WILL USE BPS IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING GOOD TO USE FOR THE TEAM. THEY AGREE BUT THEN THEY USE ESCAPE CAKE RATHER THAN SOMETHING COMMUNAL. AITA?

I'll do what I want tyvm

This is gold üëå

hes going to listen to everyone else commenting and just write him off rip
---
*edits comment*
---
Nice edit my man, way to make you seem more of an asshole
---
Perks should not counter someone trying not to get tunneled. With the heavy DS nerf it shouldn't be affected. 
---
I honestly don't understand why he wants you to take it off. Does he not like it? Does he think it's broken or something? 
---
Who knows.
---
They aren‚Äôt good perks or add ons except sloppy and ruin
---
I just checked your original post.
---
Legion DOES NOT require tunneling. If you tunnel with legion you are doing something wrong
---
Great summary tbh. A lot of hypocrits (kinda including myself sometimes). It‚Äôs just how it works
---
We'll make it.
---
FUCKING STUPID SURVIVORS THAT UNHOOK ME AND HAVE WE'LL MAKE IT BUT DON'T FINISH THE HEALING BECAUSE THEY FUCKING HEAR A HEARTBEAT AND ARE JUST PUSSIES AND THEN THEY DON'T TAKE A HIT BECAUSE THEY ARE RED RANK JUST CAUSE THE RANKING SYSTEM IS FUCKING STUPID AND NOT BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO MANAGE UNHOOKS AND SACRIFICE TIME
---
Complaining about something doesn‚Äôt really make you toxic tho... also what killer complains about dead hard? It‚Äôs probably one of the easiest exhaustion perks to counter. 
---
Borrowed Time
---
DS has a stun. Enduring affects stuns. By definition, Enduring should affect DS. Too bad, bad luck, if the killer just happens to have a perk that softens the stun of DS.
---
ARE YOU ON PC OR CONSOLE? I HAD A HUNTRESS HIT ME AFTER HITTING THE PALLET WITH THE HATCHET. I WAS SO CONFUSED. PING WAS GREEN. I WAS NEA BUT I DON'T TEABAG UNLESS I'M TEABAGGING ONE OF MY FRIENDS TO BE FUNNY.
---
Hope. Hope and adrenaline give a huge speed boost when exit gates are powered for a decent amount of time. Leave the killer in the dust. Sprint burst along with them both just for the meme
---
Who's complaining about DS after the heavy nerf it's gonna get, outside of toxic people?
---
Is there a link? I can't seem to find it. I find a bunch of questions regarding if there's a guide, but not the guide itself. 
---
You know instaheals? It was an exact copy of those, except insta-repair
---
I like hope. But 157% is only for 5 seconds. Then it‚Äôs 107% for 115 seconds. 
---
&gt; Last Laugh: No-one ever expected you to have a trick up your sleeve. Upon being sacrificed, or killed, the killer will receive the hindered effect for 4/6/8 seconds, and each survivor will obtain a screwdriver/a hunting knife/a 12 gauge.
---
Dead hard is incredibly easy to counter by either not lunging at someone who you remember has it, or being fortunate enough to have their i-frames end before your swing animation ends, idk why people think dead hard is DS levels of good... Like it's good but... Ehh... 
---
Moris already have been nerfed. If you nerf them even more it`s like a kill animation not worth an offering. Most of the people forget that you loose map pressure if you have a hooked survivor instead of a dead one.
---
I agree, they normally should, (‚ÄúIn real life‚Äù) but they‚Äôre servants of the entity so makes no sense for them to fly away imo
---
Exactly this.
---
Assuming everyone is toxic is a pretty toxic thing to do.
---
So, you would run a perk that implies losing? Oh wait, a perk that makes you even more toxic after leaving the game? Good shit bruh, cant wait to get it in my Xlaudette P3 but using dark cosmetics coz I can give more cancer but since im rich I can give aids too
---
Billies give me hatch 80% of the time though 
---
Adrenaline causes exhaustion right? So to use both sprint burst and adrenaline would require you to sprint just before the last gen pops? That's pretty hard to pull off without communication, and even with
---
Perfect Haunted Grounds spot :)
---
I mean you‚Äôre not wrong
---
Yeah, why not! It's not mine
---
I like frank too although I wear the moldy mask and some orange clothes for him.
---
Personally no i don't
---
Toxicity is ill-defined, and complaining isn't the same as enacting toxic behavior.
---
I'm inclined to believe the guilty believe all are such. I'm not going to put that on you though. Reply if you've got anything to refute.
---
True, but at least you can hide from Nurse. She has, naturally, some of the worst tracking in the game (stealth has always been key). But legion could see where everyone is after one stab, theoretically. So at least it makes some sense, the stun also stops seeing people.   
---
With nurse, she guts people fast, but lets not forget she also screws up a lot too (at least, at first). To me, I can kinda see why it keeps her. Not to mention, she has a huge amount of remorse herself, so that alone could be a nice snack for entity.   
---
It seems to like hope most, maybe that "Kill to help them" mentality is, by itself, naturally hopeful? 
---
A long time ago we had common and un-common map offerings 
---
Who's bitch this is?
---
DBD friends with my friends is mostly "queue up-&gt; disconnected from host-&gt; reinvite" and repeat. I relate. I don't see why it's so hard to make it so that we go back into our party. :\\ Most games have that. 
---
Okay 2010.  Will do.
---
Oh, if this has water, I'd love to see a lighthouse. Imagine the potential for mind games and loops. 
---
Hey! 1/100 games, you'll be fast as fuck for a moment.
---
 God forbid the killer hits you and you tear ass straight through the unopened exit.
---

---
Spectator mains soo toxic \s
---
Part of the bs hit is ping related, but I've been hit by very questionable distances even on green ping. Ateast on launch the killer actually had to make contact with their swings.
---
And it failed. 
---
It worked IMO.
---
Yay, Legion Love!   
---
My favs have been Legion, Freddy, and Trapper - so it's nice seeing some of them get good respect.   
---
Heck, I don't even mind fighting legion as much as some killers (cough, NURSE, cough).
---
Not making it in the first place would balance it. 
---
Nope, survivors still exists
---
Survivor shaped hole in the exit gates
---
Not a pig main but I know a lot about her.  
---
Pig is strongest in the late game since the RBT's auto-activate when the exit is powered. As such I'd recommend not using any RBT's until you've hit 1 gen left.
---
As long as 2 survivors at least have a RBT on their head all survivors left should generally stay in the trial due to the need for altruism. As such you're basically guaranteed a kill after exit gates are powered if you have 2 RBT's deployed (though often you'll be able to snag more.) The reason it's two specifically is because if you're facing good survivors then if only one person has a RBT on them the rest will leave so the survivor can get the hatch. While I don't approve of a hatch standoff if this happens you have a massive advantage in that scenario since the survivor is on a time limit.
---
during the game, try not to tunnel a survivor with a RBT on their head. That's not to say don't check jigsaw boxes for people working on them or snag a hit if the opportunity arises, just that a Survivor with a RBT on them will likely not be doing gens, so if you are chasing someone else in the meantime that severely hinders the survivors ability to do gens efficiently.
---
Crouching should be done whenever you're searching for survivors or don't need to get somewhere quickly. Make sure to obscure yourself behind cover when approaching a gen and listen for survivors working on it. If you hear survivors working on the generator and there is plenty of cover then try to stand up and grab a survivor off of the generator. If there isn't much cover then go for an ambush and usually you will be able to snag a hit. You can also use the ambush to contest a pallet really well if you have addons that allow a fast crouch or find yourself in a position where crouching does not hinder the chase.
---
As for a more indepth perk discussion, *Hangman's trick* is utterly useless but *Surveillance* has some limited usage. **Make your choice** is a great perk but only on killers that can move quickly (Hag, Nurse, Hillbilly, ESPECIALLY Hag.) As for builds, **Discordance** might be decent if you want to go for grabs. **Iron Grasp** can be used if you want to see some RBT deaths as you can just carry survivors far away from Jigsaw boxes (though I wouldn't personally recommend this as its mainly a meme strat.) An endgame perk like **NOED** or **Remember Me** is essential (though blood warden isn't as good since she basically has built in blood warden with her RBT's.) And the rest would be your standard killer fare. My personal build I run on her is: **NOED, BBQ &amp; Chilli, Unrelenting,** and **Iron Grasp**.  
---
As for Addons, **Combat Straps** is suprisingly good (especially when combined with **Video tape**), allowing you contest pallets with ambush much easier. **Face Mask** and **Slow-Release Toxin** are probably the best for RBT effects since Blindness will obscure useful information from the survivor and Exhaustion prevents the use of any perk that gives run speed (dead hard, Sprint burst, etc...) While you might be tempted to use *Rusty Attachments* they aren't actually that useful since most survivors will rarely heal someone with a RBT on their head, as there is little incentive to do so due to the time limit. **Last Will** is always useful because of the obvious benefits of having an extra RBT.  **Tampered Timer, Crate of Gears** and **Jigsaw's Sketch** are among her best addons since they increase the lethality of a RBT exponentially. You also get the added bonus of keeping survivors out of the game for longer due to increased search times and box amounts.
---
Hopefully this is a good enough explanation. Hope you enjoy the killer! (I sure do\~)
---
I can't tell if this is a shitpost or if OP is a moron.
---
Legion 
---
It's not really an opinion matter. They listed goals and failed at meeting those goals. Their is a reason developers don't dedicate all their resources to 1 thing.
---
Most if not all have it. I‚Äôve kinda gotten used to it at some point but I mean how hard could it be. I‚Äôm no game designer but when literally every game has this feature I would imagine it‚Äôs not that hard. 
---
I have yet to see a real counter argument to that though. It always boils down to solo survivors don't like when their team doesn't get totems, but that's not really a reason NOED has to be changed.
---
Take the headset off from your head and make coffee
---
At first, of course, but after years in the entity‚Äôs grasp, she likely has a full leash on her devastating powers.
---
I‚Äôd never considered that point about hope, however. Then again, I feel like her humanity and remorse may have eroded away over time.
---
this so great
---
It may blow up your mind but when you play as killer and press certain button you gonna swing the weapon you hold. Not only that if survivor is near you it hits them.
---
STOP DISCONNECTING, YOU CLEARLY SUCK AND YOU'LL JUST GO AGAINST BETTER KILLERS!! YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED TO DOWNRANK. 
---
I like the rework, but don't know how the numbers affect the game. It stops the tunneling part.
---
They should rework noed so it is stronger however they should also add a dull totem counter. Currently noed is strong enough to be a dick slap to one survivor however not that impactfull to the others simply due to how quickly the gates open. If the devs do this then much like how decisive is going to heavily reduce tunneling from killers or farming from team mates, NOED would reduce genrush by survivors, and because the dull totem counter would apear regardless it would force them to decide if they want to cleanse totems or go for the faster win risking noed.
---
I mean, Carb tuning guide could easily be a purple if not a pink, and primer bulb could probably be a green.
---
Also, he‚Äôs meant to eventually get pinks, seeing as they plan to give every killer 2 pink addons, the same amount of purples, etc.
---
Yeah, it doesn't do anything except buy you a few more seconds to run away. That save would have happened with or without the halogen LOL.
---
You forgot Nea &gt;:D
---
Nice I just hit 1,500 üò¶
---
I like when people tease the mori animation over my body while I‚Äôm in dying state a hundred times before actually killing me. It‚Äôs rather relaxing. 
---
Are you ok with survivors using DS then?
---
Of course. 
---
Imagine thinking it‚Äôs any different there
---
There is multiple dev teams one of them works on bugs and exploits the others work on new chapters for the game
---
Ew lol
---
It¬¥s moment like these when I realise that I¬¥m waaay too fascinated by virtual mass murderers and their relationships.
---
Also wouldn¬¥t it be funny if the devs somehow confirmed a homosexual relationship in this game for example between Evan and Trapper with cosmetics or something.
---
I play on xbox and I can constantly get 4ks with her. I actually started feeling bad and brought the  last to the hatch past few games
---
Shit, tf you do to her?
---
I do not act toxic!  That is... that is my **LEAST** favorite thing to do!
---
Gotta love Sims :P
---
emm are you silly nea is a survivor you cringe normie 
---
By far my favorite one lmao 
---
Bitter Murmur, Blood Warden, Nurses Calling, Tinkerer, Make your choice, Thrill of the hunt, Rancor, all those are perks which punish the survivors for doing their objectives.
---
Rank 1 on PS4 is the same, almost every game is a Billy with mostly the same perks (BBQ &amp; Ruin being the staple) It gets so tedious. One little QOL change I'd like to see with Billy that I don't think would effect him too much is to make the noise of his chainsaw directional. For a killer that can cover that much distance so quickly it would be nice to know which direction he is coming from. 
---
*NYS DED‚ÄôARD*  **INTENSIFIES**
---
Yep it exists 
---
I never realized how satisfying a slow motion hit sounds :D
---
Didn't you hear? The killers decided to trade Trapper for her.

Gotta love an adrenaline &amp; self unhook!

No. I'm busy.

I feel like Huntress should be in a tier called "tries to be motherly but accidentally kills you"
---
What region are you in? I have played for 1600 hours + on PS4 &amp; I've only ever ran into 3-4 people doing this
---
Id change self care to Iron Will and for the 4th perk slot id use Borrowed Time or Unbreakable. I personally hate self care cuz holding m1 for 40 seconds is just boring.
---
Ok hag is clearly smiling wtf you make bad tier list holy god geez
---
How should they rework it so it is stronger? It already increases the killers speed making it harder to loop then and gives them a one hit down. The only way it could be stronger is if as soon as it was active all survivors teleported to hooks. Right now it is in a okay state. It gives players that can't apply pressure to generators an extra kill or two at the end of the game. While it is frustrating at times to be the one caught in the end it is just the way the game goes sometimes. However, they should not buff a perk that rewards a player to failing to protect the objective.
---
Can we ban posts of this exact totem spot.  Someone posts a new one every single day and its getting old
---
You think it only buys 10 seconds lol. Nice bait.
---
This absolutely seems interesting. It‚Äôd definitely need some thorough testing done on the number of course. But I‚Äôm a fan. 
---
Playing specifically to ruin someone else‚Äôs experience doesn‚Äôt seem right to me, for either side. 
---
Bait? 9 times out of 10 it only buys them a few more seconds of chase before they‚Äôre right back down on the ground again. Personally I don‚Äôt recall a single time when someone struck me and actually escaped the chase.

Meanwhile, i've never used noed ever, always felt cheap and suddenly i had a made up honor code not to use it.
---
Well good on you. You‚Äôre probably a good survivor. Which ‚Äúgood survivors‚Äù are better than 90% of survivors. Haha. 
---
Thank you, luckily I recorded every single game. :)
---
It would be interesting to know the conditions of taking the game hostage and the conditions of being immersed tho.
---
Really? I feel like it's the complete opposite - people who complain about crutch perks/meta usually stay in /new and get negative feedback and criticism from the community. The people in this sub are usually nice, helpful and scoff at toxic behavior. If someone complains about, say, Legion they do it in a funny way or just make delete Legion/disconnect memes.   
---
  
---
There might be a slight tendency to criticize DS because, let's face it, it's a tool for toxic SWFs to abuse, and in certain cases (like when every survivor has it) can ruin a game. If you look at what's most popular it's fan art and memes. This community is so nice and friendly.
---
Why would you want that, then you could only play him 8 times a year :/
---
If that‚Äôs the case, can we have the match end immediately when all four survivors are slugged and none has No Mither or Unbreakable?
---
What rank are you? I run DS all the time and every time I use it I gain *at least* a full minute of extra time if not more before I'm downed again.
---
The only time I'll go down fast again is if they're running Enduring.
---
Jokes aside, why yall think every perk needs some requirement before activating. I wouldnt mind getting stunned for a bit just to play vs a surv with 1 less perk
---
It sometimes might let my Sprint burst or adrenaline go off when I d strike, or make the killer go after another team member. Not all the time but it's definitely possible. The skill check being kinda hard under pressure is what kills it tho I agree.
---
I hate when my ruin gets destroyed the first second of the game
---
It's annoying because some people do flaps to say "don't come, killer is near" some use it to say "come get me, I'm safe" 
---
I usually sit around rank 8 on both killer and survivor just because I don‚Äôt play a lot anymore. But I have been rank 1 on both. I do play on PlayStation though mostly, so maybe it‚Äôs different on PC. 
---
They shouldn't make it stronger but they could easily give it something like Bitter Murmur's effect so you can see where Survivors are when it activates.
---
Why not post these in one big thread instead of spamming them individually
---
I play killer. The clue to my playstyle is in the name.
---
In all seriousness though the concept of winning is flexible in this game. I've played survivor, got sacrificed and still pipped with a decent amount of BP. That's a win in my book. Conversely it's possible to escape and not pip.
---
Imagine complaining about Dead Hard in 2019.
---
Just don't lunge at someone who has Dead Hard.
---
Machine gun builds with it WERE op
---
I guess, I'm not a fan of fan art or memes so I never look twice at those posts, but even DS I don't care about, because it doesn't matter to me if I get 0 kills or 4 kills, I have my own fun. 
---
Maybe I'll nose around the non gameplay/discussion posts an see if there's a friendlier side to the sub I've missed. :)
---
Well, that sucks. I have recoreded every single game, however, I was so triggered I forgot reporting ingame tho..
---
But thank you for your reply, I will do this from now on. :)
---
Or just continue to use NOED because it's not on the same level of DS anyway.
---
Basically, if the Survivor is new and didn't know what they were doing they might not be banned.
---
If they knew full well that they're just trying to waste your time they will be banned.
---
They weren't trying to win but just trying to waste your time.
---
That's what the support team will look at and if they determine that they were griefing then they'll most likely take action on that player.
---
With this perk specifically, or just in general?
---
With this perk, it‚Äôs the name. ‚ÄúLast Laugh‚Äù. It implies that there‚Äôs been some kind of back and forth exchange. A chase would simulate that back and forth.
---
In general, no I don‚Äôt think every perk needs a requirement to activate. I only like requirements in two situations. The perk is either very powerful (something like Spirit Fury) or very niche (like Diversion (though I do think the timer for that needs to be way smaller)). 
---
There's no point in this because either you unhook yourself and get hit almost immediately or you get stubborn people that will do nothing and end up extending the game by an unneeded 2 minutes.
---
It actually never stacked I don‚Äôt think
---
For me this happens when I use my shortcut to launch the game. Starting the game from my Steam Library fixes this. Doesn't work for everyone though.
---
I mean sure, if the survivor is cackling evilly to themselves and talking about how they do it just to upset someone, then it‚Äôs malicious. But if they‚Äôre not, I don‚Äôt see how that has anything to do with what I posted earlier. 
---
I mean there will always be people complaining about other players using the strongest tactics, that might not be the most fun to fight like Bayonetta in Smash 4, Conqueror in For Honor, The Direct Hit in TF2 or the Scar-H in CSGO. But to be honest, everyone has the rights to use to strongest tatics, characters and weapons in order to win as long as they are available to everyone to some extend.
---
If you actively restrict yourself from using these however, just to make sure your opponent has fun playing as well, I would certainly like to meet you in real life because I think you might be a nice person to be around, but I would not like to have you on my team, because  if I want to win and you refuse to swith to BT,SB,DS or OoO because you want the killer to have fun you will have to leave my Lobby.
---
If you disagree with me, that¬¥s fine, we¬¥re all humans and we can all have opinions, but this is my stance on the topic. I¬¥m also a rather casual player, but I usually try to win as well and I will use to tools I have in order to do so.
---
Holy shit this was in the back of my mind the whole time but you actually did it, you made the meme you madman.  Truth is out now.
---
The perk is actually decent if you're hooked near the corners and use a hook distan offering
---
&gt; I can actually hear Michael coming

---
What. Ooohhhh Nooooooooo...
---
&gt;I do play on PlayStation
---
That's probably why. I play console (xbox) too and most players are absolute garbage outside of high red ranks. I play this game on and off and get rank 1 on both sides when I do play. It's crazy that even at rank 1 you still have people who have absolutely *no idea* how to play.
---
Survivors who drop pallets instantly, hide in lockers, play immersed, fail ruin skill checks (or even just skill checks in general).
---
Killers who get 360'd (to be fair the framerate is garbage), constantly try to mindgame on safe pallets, never break safe pallets, face camp, don't understand Survivors have 3rd person cameras.
---
I was in this LFG SWF party recently and a rank 1 player didn't understand why the Killer kept dropping me to hooks while I was the obsession. When I said he's dribbling for my DS they had no idea what I was talking about.
---
It's crazy. Maybe new ranking system will change that?

Lorewise this perk doesn't make sense. These perks you named do make sense though. Killers should kill that's why they learn new tricks. Through teachable perks they become more experienced and efficient at killing and hunting survivors through sacrificing bloodpoints to the Entity. They are entitled to use every mean to stop the survivors from escaping. Survivors on the other side have a variety of perks that increase their survivability and gain them through the same principle because their objective is to survive not fight the killer. This perk, even though it's an original idea, doesn't fit the lore of survivors. Yes, a spiteful survivor that learns how to hinder the killer is a very interesting idea. Imagine if the stun took place if you manage to kobe off a hook while the killer is near you. That would discourage facecamping. Maybe for fairplay's sake the Entity could stun the killer if he's near a hook when a survivor kobe's from the hook. That would make more sense. 
---
Good thing I run small game

Machine gun builds were wack

Grab Bond (first choice) or Empathy. I personally run aftercare, but the set-up makes it hit-or-miss.
---
Youre going a bit extreme there mate, i understand where youre coming from and ive been here in dbd since release, killers *have* been underpowered since release and they did whine but in good taste, the dude up there is a minority, the game lately though the "killers" as a group have been quiet and a lot of them openly vocalising that the game is in a good state, a lot of dedicated killer mains waited years, years to get anything close to balance, dont forget vacuums, insta BNP, all 4 insta DS, healing speed feom wounded to healthy in 2 seconds etc. Its just been how it has, tbh IMO theres nm to complain about anymore except bugs exploits and noed and maybe nurse but they arent urgent like all the others.
---
Just feel good man, some people are sooks but remember they are individuals, this sub needs to stop dividing people into killers and survivors.
---
They cant anymore but it stems from the time infinite loops existed and etc, some of the older players still arent over it.
---
I run Small Game and get all 5 Totems at the beginning of March. Bye bye Hex's, bye bye NOED.
---
Got robbed of a hatch grab the other day. Very unhappy. 
---
Being farmed sucks. Being Mori‚Äôd after being farmed sucks even more. Play however you want. You‚Äôre not being toxic. You‚Äôre not even being unsportsmanlike. 
---
I will say that this happens to me, I‚Äôll probably be extremely frustrated. If it‚Äôs happened more than once that day I‚Äôll switch to another game entirely for a while. It‚Äôs an all around bad experience that leaves a lingering bad taste in my mouth. 
---
(Farmers are also why I play swf most of the time. At least if I get farmed then, it‚Äôs all in good fun.)
---
I'd like to see Killer Perk popularity but you'd have to wait for all Survivors to die and that'd be a pain in the ass.
---
Huh, am I going to be on the killer side for once?
---
Noed might be slightly out of balance, but not by much. It allows everyone a chance to play, takes up a perk slot and is useless for most of the game, and has ways to counter it. While I never had much problem with either perk, DS had much more potential for abuse. A Nerf to ds doesn't somehow mean noed must be nerfed.
---
You find somewhere in this reddit an already made spreadsheet. Maybe search it and use it as your basis.

---
Hehe BOI!!! 
---
You already know I love it!
---
But there is counterplay to some extent to all of those perks. Just a stun when you kill someone? Bs
---
Then run bitter murmur and NOED if you are having a hard time tracking survivors. I do not see the point in buffing a perk that is already pretty strong and rewards bad plays.
---
I think this is too situational. Only places this would help somehow is if youre getting moried in the exit gate and the killer could get you because youre downed
---
Yeah waiting would get tiresome after a while. However, I *could* make a column for the survivor perks that were the most common for each match? 
---
It would be worth it

---
Alright wrestling god
---
You're right Jaxton Wheeler and Porter was abit hot but it's lacking chemistry and not a bareback scene.
---
I actually believe sprint burst is the worst haha, it doesn‚Äôt help you in chase (for which I use exhaustion perks) and people using it tend to not run which wastes time
---
No it's not holding the game hostage. If you hate having to look for survivors just use a tracking perk like whispers or spies. 
---
A perk that is only useful after you die... Is this a joke OP? What use is this to a solo player?
---
I'm aware of one or two, and read them over to get an idea, thanks for telling me anyway :) 
---
Mainly, I'd just like to contribute my own for more diversity, and possibly with an element or two that differs from the rest, which is why I'm looking for suggestions ! 
---
Yes mawma!
---
Just use NOED, it's their fault if they don't cleanse dull totems üòé
---
Thank you
---
Holy shit, someone needs to try that in KYF
---
DO WHAT I DO. I PUT THEM IN "STUPID" PLACES. AS IN SOMEWHERE THEY WOULDNT EXPECT BECAUSE ITS STUPID RANDOM WALK WAYS. DONT PLACE AT GENS. TRAP PALLETS AND WINDOWS. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE IN A CHASE. 
---
fuck yes
---
Fair point. She would be trying to keep the kids healthy but she would get them sick since she vomits all of the time and doesn't know what a antibiotic is.
---
True, it's DS all over again
---
Ain't it funny how in the comments no killer ever is a noed gamer? :\^) 
---
I wasn't trying to defend the perk idea, I was more being objective to the comment above, but you're right
---
No. You work smarter not harder. If i dont manage to get anyone and the gens are rushed its pretty fair to noed. 75% of the time I don't let them do all gens. Either I get no one and they finish 5 gens or I get everyone before they are done. I want atleast 1 person for BP in a tough match. I never know what anyone will bring. So i use noed as a last resort. 
---
Just because you can prevent it from coming into play doesn‚Äôt make it balanced . You waste a lot of time finding AND cleansing totems by doing so (time you could use by doing the primary objective). Then there is still a chance of the last totem being very well hidden and that perk still activating.
---
Getting down voted btw
---
Forever the ‚Äûpleb‚Äú king of virgins
---
um, um, no, just no. Most Adams who wear Deliverance are trying to do the unhooking achivement. Did you try to do it? It takes sooo long even if you play Adam all the time, especially when you want to not troll with your careless unhooks, just to farm Deliverance activation. I am slowly doing the achivement, and gosh, I haven't seen my poor main saboteur boi for like ages.
---
It is not like every Adam wears that perk anyway, especially outside doing the achiv...
---
But, another thing is the reckless, trollish farming Deliverance activation. When on killer, if I see you doing that, Adam, be sure I will find you, and will facecamp your first hook stage hard.
---
It‚Äôs literally the easiest perk to counter. You can eliminate it before it even activates. 
---
I don't have a killer main as I find all of them to be fun and as for survivor I main nea 
---
NOED is fine balance-wise, it mainly gets you one kill at the end of game, unless it's coupled with other endgame perks to a complete end game build. The issue with noed is that it can be used by bad players to secure a kill (or two if the survivors try saving against noed), to which the survivor can't do anything except hide (LOL). I have said it before and i will say it again, noed should be completely reworked and split it's current effect to bloodwarden and remember me (during bloodwarden survivors are exposed, each RM stack gives 1%speed boost when the gates are powered). 
---
The perk would light up when you're far enough from a hook 
---
I think that if they‚Äôre not touching any gens at all for an extended amount of time, then yes it‚Äôs holding the game hostage. Like the other dude said, everything that needs a report out of game also needs to be reported in-game as well. 
---
Exactly, Doctor's power is now completely useless. It just wastes your time when you want to get them mad. Sometimes you manage to shock somebody and block him from vaulting a window/pallet but it must be a potato or you;re extremely lucky(basicallly for me it;s like counting on headpop with Pig).
---
He's the most addon-reliant killer in the game. Without addons his power does literally nothing. He really needs rework, even more in Freddy IMO.
---
Depends if your a team player or you look out for yourself. 
---
A tracking perk like Bond or Empathy could be good to give you information on your team. Alert is good for information on killers. Botany helps with over all healing times. We'll make it is good if you make a lot of saves and want to get your team right back in the game. 
---
Stake out is good if your confident around a killer to get the tokens as it bypasses ruin and speeds up gen progress slightly. Unbreakable if you are gonna run killer a lot and may get slugged, Tenacity falls in the same bracket. Distortion hides you from killer tracking perks and gives you information on what the killer has but can be burnt out early game, whereas sole survivor comes in useful end game if your likely to be the last person alive. Lightweight can be good to reduce scratches if you are often in chase so you can slip away easier, same for Quick and Quiet which is useful for jumping in lockers at a sprint or vaulting.   
---
Basically a lot of perks can be useful as you have a strong build it just depends on your chosen playstyle. 
---
bUt i DoN'T wAnT tO UsE Non-MEtA pErKs
---
&gt;Also make sure you open their steam profile while recording.
---
Not necessary because devs will get this info from the logs, which is why sending the footage without reporting in-game is useless and discarded. 
---
She has a very good map control, she can be in many places almost at the same time. So, you know...
---
I KEEP GETTING MATCHES WITH SURVIVORS WITH FLASHLIGHTS AND TEABAGGING AND I END UP KILLING THEM ALL BUT BYE THE END OF THE GAME THERE ALL MAKING JOKES AND SAYING GG LIKE DECENT PEOPLE. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS RUB MY WIN IN THERE FACE BUT THEY ARE GENUINELY NICE PEOPLE. WHAT THE HELL MAN.
---
&gt;I doubt they will get banned for hiding. Its anmoying but its why hatch exsists technically they arent doing anything wrong
---
Except at 4 gens hatch hasn't spawned so the objective is to do a gen no matter what. You can slowly move from one gen to another while making some progress but ignoring them completely is holding the game hostage (after a certain amount of minutes).
---
Easily baited out as well, and no real benefit in chase. Sure, you can position yourself but I manage to position myself too without the perk. Maybe at end game when there‚Äôs not a lot of pallets left but I don‚Äôt see a real benefit in the use
---
Bingo.
---
I'll try and get us a license for this beautiful ship we've got here.
---
Toxic Tuesday and toxic Thursday are the best fun. 
---
Nothing beats a toxic teabag after a pallet stun. 
---
If we just avoid people who do the flap, people will learn that doing it will mean ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come near‚Äù. Can then be used for camping and deliverance, and you don‚Äôt risk death from multiple meanings
---
Sounds like I need this build
---
I have to disagree, the perk is literally useless in it's current state on the ptb. The only thing it's good for is memeing the killer with deliverance right after being hooked. 
---
It's fine for a perk to have counter play, but the should be an opportunity cost to doing so. The counter play of the version that does not lose time when down or chased is to ignore the unhooked person, if they body block, you slug them. Opportunity cost is that you dont get to advance their hook state and lose a little bit of progress in your chase, but that's fine because for them to body block super hard theyll just spend the whole match being a slug since they willingly throw themselves in front of you, which is not sustainable since it requires someone to constantly be picking them up which is actually more ideal for you than hooking them.
---
The current version has almost no opportunity cost to counter play. If the survivor gets unhooked, you can tunnel them, and if the survivor is at least alright at the game, they Can run until it has almost no time left and the killers counter play is just to wait 10 seconds. Perhaps the worst part is that the better you are at the game the worse this perk is.
---
Look at sloppy butcher for a perk that's good in this regard. Counter play is to not heal, unless you have to, but you have an opportunity cost of being 1 shot if the killer shows up. You wont be able to run as long. 
---
And if that still isnt enough for you then the other solution I can think of is to make the time you have left to use it increase while being chased and continue to decrease when downed.  This solves my problem where even if the killer plays into your decisive they can go unpunished and also solves yours because a survivor who body blocks will not get in a chase for long and thus will not gain much time to use their decisive. 
---
what who the fuck complains about dead hard
---
You must love really simple enjoyments
---
I‚Äôm going to enjoy head on I think, although I do like the idea of putting it on a timer instead of exhaustion.

I kinda want a Paul Heyman esk Spectre following around survivors yelling at them, as he yells it fills up a gauge like Mikey Bois EW, then at Max you trigger it to become ol Bork an take em to suplex city.

Mori is three F5's.
---
thanks for the imaginary rules very cool
---
&gt; I just don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôd play in a way that you yourself wouldn‚Äôt like to be on the receiving end of. 
---
Because there are a lot of people who don't think or care about the people they meet or interact with; they only think about themselves. That's true in life in general, but even more so in multiplayer video games where it can be easy to forget/ignore that there's another person.
---
I saw it as a meme on twitter I didn‚Äôt know it was a porn lol sounds like a funny ass scene 
---
And I do it just randomly but usually I'm in SWF. I wish we could come together as a community and make it a thing. 
---
oh yes, even tho I meant having him as survivor but that works too, an F5 and then a Kimura Lock until Bracc breaks the survivor's arm would be a better moriüê∏
---
Someone once pointed out that they suspect many killer mains are real sociopaths. No, not the kind who'd openly commit a crime but functional sociopaths who have little regard for other people's feeling and have little remorse if they hurt others 
---
Since they can't empathise, it's impossible for them to put themselves in other people's shoes. And this game both attract and amplify these kind of personality types.
---
One day I decided I would never take this game seriously again. Then I proceeded to change my main to Ace. And everything changed.
---
I had a Huntress do this to me half an hour ago at rank 5. Arguably someone who‚Äôs put time into the game and understands what a dick move it is. 
---
ps4 survivors are wack Asfuck
---

I'M PRETTY SURE YOU MEANT 2 SECONDS.

---
Fun fact: Explaining a joke makes it 35% funnier.
---
it makes me uncomfortable 
---
Did they elaborate why having a permanent exposed-like effect on a survivor is toxic for them as a killer haha 
---
It's that ugly shit - Ochido.
---
I would be perfectly fine with NOED if the killer only got the speed boost OR the instadown, not both. Just instantly becoming like 3 times better at killing because you failed to stop the gens from being finished is too much.
---
i love u
---
Omg haha, I love doing this to greedy survivors who rush to the hook immedietally just for their WGLF stack. Disgusting players! Let me hang for at least 30 second before you start running. 
---
I've never seen that before, how peculiar. 
---
I hope it gets taken care of, of all the games to be infested with bots this is the last one I would assume to be. The very nature of the game demands both sides interact with each other. What little points you CAN get from a bot like that can't be worth it. 
---
No Unnerving Presence?

Latency, client side, the nurse was in range. On your side it was different.
---
Combined with the fact that it'd take a month to earn shards for rank rewards AND how grindy earning shards the regular way is; I can't imagine them losing any money if they gave as many as 1,000 shards for Rank 1. It'd only let someone purchase a single item of the cheapest cosmetic sets and it'd take over two months for it to let them get something more valuable. Anyone who would be willing to wait two months probably wouldn't have spent real money on the non-Auric Cell cosmetics anyway.
---
I wish it broke hooks permanently like sacrificing does, but alas it's only 3 minutes like sabotaging.
---
Except that killer is the only one who can play in scummy manner and not get punished for it. To begin with the power level is just not on survivors' side. Survivors can teabag all they want but at the end of the day, it doesn't affect the killers ability from playing. Camping and tunnelling OTOH completely prevents one party from fully participating in the game. 
---
IN THE NAME OF THE FOOKIN' PEAKY BLINDERS 
---
Doesn't count if they DC or let themselves die on hook though. 
---
This changes nothing for me ill still use noed on shit killers at rank 1 like doc traper etc but i dont use it on good killers billy huntress spirit and wont start now. 
---
I dont understand why this is a issue if i play a bad killer why would i hamstring myself more sure im running noed  but u were also able to loop me alot more and it took me for every to get across the map thats the trade off 
---
Damn that must have been so good as Hag, imagine if you were using Mint rag as the time
---
He just thinks it's not good I think
---
Which it isnt. Pretty much all flashlight addons except for batteries are bad.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
I encounter way too many who don't flap when the killer is still there and then I simply run into the killer because I think it's save -_-  flap when he's there! It's not that hard. 
---
Oh ho! 
---
I think at minimum the time for respawn should be 5 minutes.  Still a very useful perk for the killers that immediately come back and down the previously hooked survivor.  They don't understand that it's ok to get more than one at a time.
---
When will people just start cleansing totems instead of complaining? 
---
You disgust me.
---
When I play Survivor I see self-care as an utter waste of time, especially with Sloppy. I run Empathy and Alert so I can keep full map awareness and it saves my ass a lot, but it becomes frustrating when I watch someone self-care at a distance while I'm cranking out 3/4's of a gen.
---
As a Killer, please bring self-care, the longer a game goes the more it tilts in a Killer's favor.
---
"WHB KART TE JUZ BIK TH TOP" 
---
"Why is your voice like that?"
---
...my voice if fine shut up...
---
Specifically this one, if a surv takes it to have his last laugh then go ahead and have a blast dying to annoy the killer, while my gameplay will be easier cause i wont face fully kitted surv. No adrenaline with selfcare and exhaustion plus somekind of iron will, one of em must go away.
---
* Use whispers and crouch just as it turns on.Crouching 24/7 and trying to find survivors without whispers will take a lot of time since Pig runs about 25% slower while crouched.
---
* Crouch at pallet loops and use your ambush.Not all pallet loops are ambush-able,but a good example are the Autoheaven ones.If you can find a person,go into kyf and try it out.
---
* You can use her rbts in any way you like.I personally use them early game to discourage survivors from doing gens.You don't really use them for killing,just slowing the game down since survivors have to spend time going to jigsaw boxes and searching them instead of doing gens.
---
* Even though Pig can ambush at loops,there are some pallets you have to tank in the face,plus she has to break dropped pallets because it's impossible to ambush at them,so Enduring and Brutal Strength are very good on her.Also as I said before whispers is essential if you want to sneak up on people without wasting a lot of time,and your 4th perk can be anything,the better choices though are aura revealing perks such as BBQ and Nurse's Calling.
---
* Her perks arent all that worth it.They're good on some killers but only in very specific situations.
---
If you want to learn more I suggest watching Psychoscorpionz over on twitch,most certainly the best Pig player and one of the best killer mains in general.He doesnt use stuff like ruin/tampered timer and he doesnt tunnel,very fair player.

Shoot ok you got me :((
---
 A lot of time my ass, totem spawns suck and you can always run small game. Gens get done too fast in this game so there is no problem with perks that slow the game down 
---
If they did, it might've been a question that was ignored.  I've asked on their livestream a few times and nobody responded.
---
What about the old yellow flashlight? Or shock and muddy splinters
---
Keep laughing while i keep gettin kills
---
Daddy lesnar? Fucking ew
---
Would be better as a buff to calm spirt considering it already does half of what this perk does.
---
I‚Äôve seen balanced landing, dead hard, borrowed time, deliverance and general looping called toxic a few times on here. For all the times I see survivors called ‚Äòentitled‚Äô then see killers wanting survivors to literally run in a straight line with no speed boost or loop in a chase. The hypocrisy is incredible and I genuinely can‚Äôt believe people can say ‚Äúomg ur so entitled‚Äù whilst also saying these things are OP or toxic. 
---
Not just killers though. This sub is mostly filled with awful opinions from players who just want their side to be made as easy as possible to guarantee a 4k/escape. The game is in its most balanced state its ever been right now, but I have no confidence in the devs that they will not fuck it up with more unnecessary nerfs or buffs. 
---
There are two ways to effectively use her reverse bear traps.
---
1) is to save them all until about 2 generators done.  This way when the exit gates are opening, they can't leave and it extends the end game against alturistic survivors.  
---
2) Try to always keep 1 trap on a survivor or two.  This extends the early/mid game because those survivors will not be doing generators.  Don't bother chasing survivors with the RBT when using this strategy, you can attack them but don't chase.  You'll need to be pressuring the others that are doing the generators during that time.
---
Its best to read the survivors and decide which would be best.  Although do try to always keep at least 1 for the end game.
---
Her Perks are decent.  Surveillance got buffed and can help you with immersed survivors.  Make Your Choice is really good as a trap tool for any altruism; just make sure you're not too close.  Hangmans trick is very situational, but CAN be good but only on certain situations.  It is a lot better on Trapper though since it affects traps re spawns.
---
The best use of her crouch is to uncrouch when you are almost at a generator but still out of sight.  Your terror radius doesn't begin until after a few seconds of your uncrouch and you can use that to your advantage.
---
Her ambush I find is extremely useful for when Survivors don't want to leave that one pallet.  If it is a short wall you can bait the jump and hit them on the otherside with the ambush speed.  Experienced survivors will probably just run away if they see you do this though and may not work.
---
Nonono, my experience is invite 3 friends, wait 30 mins for a game, dont get one, restard lobby, try again, eventually get a game, get dodged at rank 1 because killers at rank 1 are really bad, so are random survivors, quit the game go play stardew valley, get bored of starydew valley go to bed ,wake up and go to school, rince and repeat.
---
But i do think hes good in the right hands, dont get me wrong.
---
I just thought it was cool. And to show that I made this myself 
---
Though I don‚Äôt understand why there is a bunch of white garbage at the bottom when in the photoshop editor there isn‚Äôt so that‚Äôs a mystery for another day. 
---
I've never done a window grab in my whole killer playtime, even though I'm sure it's possible (I've seen it in videos from the current patch). I'm at the point of just lunging at everything, assuming a grab is gonna fail on principle.
---
Sorry, too busy being slugged to handle a second objective atm.
---
see. thats your fault. face campers can easily countered by just doing gens and not unhooking
---
holy fuck, this took dedication! 
---
I'm a Calm Spirit gamer so screw your Doc :\^)
---
Lol yes I know. I‚Äôve only made a few saves and the one time so did I was hunted down immediately and camped while my team did gens. The one time I was rescued I was taken to the basement and face camped. 
---
Maybe you should start with actual oc instead of a repost 
---
This is awesome. Good job. I want one!
---
Moral of the story:Killer is already easy af,and you're boosted for using dying light and a mori :)
---
As a former killer main, I only call out toxicity when a survivor is teabagging, being a prick or complaining that I was hook camping after bodyblocking me from accessing a hook. However, most of the time I just report people for actual rule-breaking.
---
How so? They are very different perks.
---
Still tier 1 a so I pick Brutal Strength instead.
---
Exactly
---
Nothing, that's the point. I even LIKE Survivors bringing Self Care. They slow the game down by themselves.
---
I used NOED and hooked all survivors in a game. While the exit gates were open. They were at them. All it took was blood warden, downing everyone and carrying them away from the gates.
---
Strangely enough we were able to do four gens 
---
That's why I like watching Tru3 - if he's dominating a match he starts going easier on the survs. But he probably played his game long enough that he doesn't care about rank.
---
"gens get done too fast" you fucking wot
---
not really strange
---
Agree with everything but the last part. While spirit is lots of fun to play as for most people, she is really fucking powerful and really not fun to go against. Inside of a chase spirit can easily track with basically no counterplay. In her ptb people called her low tier when she was already quiet powerful. She got slight buffs and now everyone pretends as if she was unusable before, in the meantime the little counter play she had is now lost. Players keep saying instasaw is BS, meanwhile others still want to buff spirit despite being the 2nd best killer in the right hands. Just my opinion.
---
why are you playing as freddy
---
I think we‚Äôre going too deep, so was I 
---
Adrenaline requires you to make it to the end game to be useful. We'll make it is useful if you're getting in books and lasts long enough at T3 that I can heal up multiple people.
---
While you're not always gettingthose unhooks to trigger it, you're less likely to see end game - especially in solo que where you're at the mercy of RNG teammates. 
---
quality shitpost
---
Not gonna change it but pls spare us Kate Densons üòÖüòÖ
---
So you still used both blood warden and noed?
---
[Reminded me of this.](https://youtu.be/vCSP1THD9cA)
---
yeah i was a bit of a prick
---
Nope, there's still plenty left!
---
I main survivor and I'm used to killers camping and tunneling with ruin,sloppy,noed and op addons and I want to thank them for not playing like an a-hole.What has this game come to...
---
I WANT TO KNOW ALSO
---
Care to explain?  I think this would make fighting him a battle of the survivors skill,  not the killers lack of add ons or viability. 
---
Third option: Enduring III
---
I think it would help with that,  and make him stronger. 
---
At the end of the day, tunneling and tbagging is just bad sportsmanship 
---
If you play to win it's not worth going out of your way to do other stuff but gens. Getting brown toolboxes from chests, sabo a few hooks but not being able to be around to finish them when the killer is about to hook someone, waiting for the flashlight save only for the killer to be facing a wall or be just a tiny bit careful... I just don't really like that the decisions the devs make even though are there to balance the game they do it in a bad way. Take the wretched shop infinite for example. Instead of making it a much weaker tile they just made huge dead zones around it. Once I had a billy bamboozle the window for me but the time I got back to it it went down in front of me.
---
"But we are initiated, aren't we Claudette?"
---
Thus this sub's obsession with No one escapes death continues.
---
What rank are you at?  Not to sound sarcastic.  At the higher ranks ,  he is really bad,  as he is just a basic killer who relies on high tier add ons and bloodlust,  because of how many pallets he eats and his lack of power in a chase,  unlike stronger killers like Clown,  Billy,  Nurse,  and Huntress. 
---
What killers you face would be small but nice to see
---
Yeah, but Legion is more than one person. Frank and Julie are psychos, and Frank is manipulative af. Joey and Susie seem fine though.
---
But we're considering this with the assumption that they're free from Entity's grasp, right? In which case, the ones that could be redeemed are: Pig, Wraith, aforementioned half of Legion, pooossibly Trapper. The rest are fucked up beyond comprehension.
---
I was unaware of the cloaked speed,  so that is totally my fault.  But what about the changes break the game?  I think it helps with the games original idea of killers having the upper hand and being noticeably more powerful than survivors,  so survivor takes more skill and killers aren't always destroyed. 
---
Oh no, whatever will I do?
---
*Laughs in Devour hope
---
The fuck you mean "oc". This has been reposted more times than I can count. You can even see the white bar at the bottom from where you've failed to crop it correctly.
---
You're trolling us right?
---
Wraith's in a good spot right now, he's a solid mid-tier Killer with some very nasty add-ons.
---
With these buffs he'd be OP. (Well not the movespeed one, IIRC at base he moves at 126 or 128 while cloaked, so that'd actually be a nerf) 
---
What about hitboxes and pallets?
---
I agree with most of your points (especially the cosmetics,  great job devs)  but not the one about survivors doing gens in unsafe locations and only needed one more hit  with sprint burst not being meta.  
---
While you do get a hit off of the gen,  what about afterwards?  And sprint burst is still meta,  as I see it constantly in games. 
---
Just like u can with DS
---
A lot of perks are situational or ping dependent. I run Lithe myself, and as you know running it, there are maps where it's far less useful than others. Same for Balanced Landing. See Dead Hard for ping. I think it's ultimately about what you're comfortable with that meshes with your play style.
---
Almost no one I play with runs Alert or Empathy, but I can use those to Quarterback a team with Killer location and watch how a chase is going.
---
I appreciate there are a multitude of perk loadouts when one wants to go off Meta, or isn't a Runner or Gen Jockey. It adds variety. But Entity save me from Self Care time wasters. 
---
Had something kinda like this happen to me but I was a killer I had thrill of the hunt and ruin the stream went for it it let me know hit him off of it got him down put him on a hook gets off the hook can't find them on look someone is touching my totem look who it is hit him get him down on hook for the 2nd time so I am busting a gen on the other side of the map he gets unhooked go over because guess what? My thrill of the hunt went off made it there to late his friend was smart and took the hit for him so now it's broken there both running the same way we'll guess what one runs towards the main building one goes to the side walls of the map get him down pick up DC ok go on get two others they DC not long after feel bad for the 4th guy give him gens so he can go through hatch watching him do gens gets it done leaves says thank you but then OMG TUNNELED WHY WHERE YOU JUST GOING AFTER ME turns out they where all with him that's why they also went for the DC lots of trash talk back and forth says he can go back and show me proof and that I am wrong and that he says he didn't keep going to the same spot shows clip ends up being wrong calls me a lier says I didn't have thrill of the hunt even tho you can clearly see i did then bans me from chatüòÇüòÇüòÇthere was much much more but boi was i angry like shows proof of himself lying and pretends it still didn't happen that way AND HE HAS A CHILD I FEAR FOR THIS WORLD 
---
They're farming, they all run Hex: Thrill of the Hunt and will be also be constantly readying-Unreadying (constantly tapping it) in the pre-game lobby.
---
I've had it so many times that I literally know when the killer is afk botting or not.
---
If they do that ready unready thing for a full 40 seconds, you know it's a bot, sometimes even when there are only 3 players in the pre-game lobby, they'll consistently be doing it.
---
It's most probably to farm because high ranked players then start to farm in front of him.
---
Yep, I'm thinking the same thing. Legion was, and has always been, an accident (and should be removed).
---
This. 
---
I'd remove his built in Windstorm though, since he'd now actually be able to surprise people by using his power and he wouldn't need to rely so much on the speed boost for hits.
---
Im just saying i dont believe you would get banned for it whatever the rules say. 
---
Usually at rank 1 but because there matching is aids i get rank 10s sometimes, but yeah i understand that and comparing him to a 4 SWF with flashlights ds yeah no chance but as i said in my experience ive done well on him
---
Why don't people want to run Small Game? When I had trouble finding Ruin when I played Survivor some dude on this sub said Small Game and that's what I did? Is it bugged?
---
we need a new survivor with the name kyle. that will teach him!
---
What about him? I got em p3  play him everyday
---
Does it annot you on a... *spiritual* level?
---
They are nor the orginal poster...
---
At the higher rank he isnt bad, he is midtier, no offence but if you struggle with the game maybe try improving
---
I think it‚Äôs an issue with latency when that happends
---
No thanks. If I DC cuz the killer is being a piece of shit to possibly deny them bbq and chili, then they deserve to lose it
---
Get good? Theres an exploit that makes flashlight saves near impossible and im supposed to get good?
---
Why do you do it? Doesn't make a lot of sense.
---
Wow! A 4.5 second stun for being bad!
---
Is Tier 1 not worth using?
---
When a killer is being an ass/playing toxic I sit in basement and spam the pointing emote to avoid crows. It wastes their time and hopefully ruins their day. I'm petty
---
Hey she looks alot like the new survivor
---
She looks cool as hell
---
R/titlegore
---
I once got flamed after game by a survivor for using NOED even though it was rank 2 lol
---
Here comes the trapper
---
Lol who needs an excuse, what will they do, cry "-rep" on me?
---
He's kinda under powered. having to pull some into dream to hurt them makes sense for his character, but it makes him kinda bad. 
---
But that's my opinion.
---
Oh wow! Someone doing a fun little gimmick perk is apparently suggesting it should be in the game! I don‚Äôt know what the hell your problem is, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm a god damned developer adding this to the game.
---
or just break the totems???? 
---
NOT REALLY FREE IF THEY SAVED THEIR PERK FOR THE OPTIMAL TIME TO USE IT, IT TAKES UP A SLOT AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE-HELL I APPLAUD THAT USE OF IT.
---
I'd like to see the amount of times Survivors hello tbag or goof around at the start of the game.
---
Not very scientific and you wouldn't be able to count games where you start alone, but I'd like to know how many Survivors are secretly soulless robots.
---
If the DS users you've been facing only get an extra 10 seconds then you haven't been going against very good DS users.
---
I prefer to not have things binded to space
---
The best horror movies are the ones with a short basic and easy to understand story thats why we keep hearing About the more older horror movies ( myers Freddy jason ) but stuff like the canibal and pig and many others are left behind because there story Goes realy deep and you have to look for hidden details in order to know the story better
---
Freddy is my best killer by far. Easier than billy for me
---
Was that comment necessary? I just replied to a comment and i will from now on report people, who do not touch a Gen for 30 mins+, if the devs do not punish them, fine with me. But atleast I tried.
---
This game was not fun at all and I think nea thinks so too. She even disconnected, so do not tell me she was trying to do the objective.
---
2% faster movement after first gen finished? 10% faster when all gens finished? Thats broken
---
You know what would be much easier to implement, and generally better? Stacking time penalties for DC'ing. 15 minutes, 30, full hour, etc. Considering this game's matches consist of 5 players and have no drop-in, someone's decision to DC straight up ruins the whole match (or ends it, if it's the killer). There should be a 0 tolerance policy for this shit, and I have no idea why there isn't.
---
FORGET YOU, MY WINDSTORM ABD SWIFT HUNT WILLL NEVER DIE
---
I feel like the absolute worst players on both sides, and by worst I mean toxic, occur between ranks 12-5.  It's a real slog getting through there because everyone thinks they still have something to prove.  I've had so many relaxing and fun games at rank 1 or rank 18.  That said, red ranks in general aren't much fun after a while because I swear every killer and survivor is running the exact same shit and every killer is billy and nurse.
---
Where can we find the other new stuff? 
---
Then you seem to be a toxic survivor, if you are not doing any Gens while the hatch is not even spawned.
---
Guess nobody reported you (yet).
---
i'll take the immersed p3 claudette with all the meta perks and a purple flashlight, please.
---
satisfied_thanos.jpeg
---
Yeah but still, you have to slow the game down just a lil bit.
---
I don't see much sprint burst nowdays so it might be you. Afterwards you chase them and need one more hit. 
---
Bruh we memed i know how to get great skill checks
---
Here it is: https://youtu.be/0LusX_1PUm0
---
lol u fuckn normie 
---
There should always be at least one person doing gens. Even when I play by myself. When I go to unhook someone and see another survivor going for the save I immediately go look for a gen. 
---
I get reported a lot, never banned :)
---
It is a joke. Because I‚Äôm not actually suggesting this. People take these fun little edits so serious.
---
SAME
---
He did so we decided to meme until someone found it
---
Yeah but despite the community's beliefs, most killers don't run NOED. Yet I face 2+ adrenaline pops every game that the gates get powered. Maybe I should start running it then. 
---
And most bring ebony Mori.
---
They nerfed their potential bump 
---
TO MAKE YOU FEEL VAD AND TRIGGERED, WORKING AS INTENDED
---
Decisive, wiggle escape/not reaching hook, hatch escape, stepping on own trap, killer letting you escape to heal others. All those can happen, although last one is usually me as killer. 
---
People are saying that he's no longer among us - fair enough, plausible.
---
But, why not have quotes from anyone else? I agree, they added a lot to the atmosphere of this game, and their lack is disappointing, to say the least. 
---
\&gt;self care and deliverance being crutches in any way, shape, or form 
---
In the words of makemebad35
---
What the fuck
---
Survivors should just have an unspoken rule where you do at least one totem per game and then if you see another in your travel just do it. I get it‚Äôs hard for solo survivors to know how many have been done but if everyone does at least one you have a better chance of them all getting done
---
;w;
---
I think ond Lerry's or the game it's useful because no bloodbath. 
---
It's just ingraved trauma from a few years back. The good old times when survivors could heal behind a dropped pallet in 2-3 seconds with We'll Make It.
---
That's fine but only being able to hit a survivor when in dream makes him kinda hard to play
---
Not looking for arguments. Just trying to offer an idea and hear people's opinions. I don't really care if they change it.
---
What if they changed NOED so it is bound to an un-lit totem that becomes lit when the doors are open, rather than picking a random one that remains like it does now. 
---
The survivors could get it on the first one but they won't know if they got it, keeps the incentive to get all 5 but leaves a chance to not have it activate if you miss one. 
---
U wot m8
---
YEE (and i cannot stress this enough) HAW!
---
On console she‚Äôs F
---
Dead Hard is a counter when you dont expect it. I have stood right behind survivors and done a lunge and hit them at the end of DH.
---
IF YOU'RE PLAYING LOW RANK YOU CAN TRAP WINDOWS OR PALLETS PRETTY FREQUENTLY BUT THE HIGHER YOU GO YOU HAVE TO START DOING RANDOM SHIT WHICH IS WHY TRAPPER ISNT THE BEST
---
I‚Äôll have to attempt this one day though she‚Äôs only level one for me. 
---
After thinking about it, I might use it now.
---
Because it's literally a reward for being garbage. Like NOED, it rewards failure. That's stupid.
---
Can I actually ask what bugs and exploits your experiencing ? My games are fine unless people are mistaking a bag host for bugs. 
---
Hmm gen tapping is a *meme* ..
---
I thought I knew what words meant bit maybe I don't.
---
Gimme operation health please
---
This damn game felt like you were a new player in league of legends playing against challanger smurfs
---
Every time i cought someone they literally walked in front of me sabotaging every single hook within half a second however thats possible, not even talking about all the emote spamming and Teabagging and just general disrespect. Fucking hell just let me play
---
People take them seriously because this subreddit is always suggesting stupid shit to add to the game.
---
lol "killer mains probably know more than survivor mains" any killer main that is good wants it removed too mate
---
It really depends on your team. If they know what they are doing and have the right perks/items gens can pop pretty quickly. Let‚Äôs not front and act like they can‚Äôt be done fast. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a problem because survivors don‚Äôt really have anything else to do besides gens if they aren‚Äôt getting chased 
---
Comments perfectly reflect the mentality of this community.
---
Fun idea op, I'd meme around with this on surv.
---
I wouldn't mind getting hit with it as a killer as it would get a chuckle out of me. 
---
Yeah, but tbh idk what they can do to make him better in a chase
---
Make it so its strength depends on the amount of dull totems on the map.
---
1 totem left: current effects
---
2 totems left: 20% longer gate opening time
---
5 totems: survivors moriable (common you need to be pretty stupid not to do a single totem when this perk exists)
---
If the killer is running any other hex perk then the total amount of dull totems will decrease.
---
Then from now on just see my perks as fun little edits. And if you disagree with them, we can talk about how to balance it in the comments.
---
A crutch is a feature that aimulates skill and prowess without the knowledge of such things, preventing players from learning these skills. In those two perks it's teamwork and come on you literally have empathy and borrowed time that you block out because you can't make use of other people...
---
I love how you just said 'i like it', and got downvoted for it... Jesus what a cesspool of a community. Have my upvote at least. 
---
I like it just not the name i fell like hex names are always over the top yknow like devour hope ruin stuff like that 
---
Agree to disagree, Swift Hunt and the new Windstorm are amazing on him at their uncommon rarities and are fairly easy to find. As long as you run bloodpoint modifiers of some kind every game, it's not too impossible to fill out your bloodwebs every game and replace add-ons. If you have BBQ &amp; Chili it's even easier to replace your stuff.
---
Even without add-ons, it's not too hard to mindgame loops with his built-in old Windstorm and even his base power synergizes really well with map control and tracking perks like MYC, Nurse's Calling, Bloodhound, Surveillance, and Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
He has 1000 hours
---
10/10 would like to see this in the game

Oh good. I can finally get rid of all these nurses 
---
Personally feel anyone over 10% in radius of a survivor should walk away from a match with 0 BP. Give them pips but no bps, they eventually run out of addons and cant level new killers or their killer in general. Harsh? Maybe but camping isnt justified unless someone is lobby hopping to find you as a killer specifically to be toxic 
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be more serious
---
Yeah, I can definitely see that. Seems like sometimes it's better to just take botany knowledge or bond (or both). 
---
Yeah, I usually just run bond and go about my business, and if I come across another survivor I go towards them so they can heal me
---
\&gt; I never run Self Care, Adrenaline all the way

Hey, I like it. 
---
It lets people who aren't the best players be able to at least contribute a little to the team. It's something of a counter to Barbecue, since they can't get right out to where the other teammates are, and could have a little bit of playability if you're willing to make the ultimate sacrifice early; Have a team-mate you know is being chased, and the awareness no fellow survivors are close enough? Killer has hold of a fellow survivor and is taking them to a hook?  Stop struggling and try to buy them a little time. 
---
More likely than not, someone who isn't trying to use the ability strategically is just going to wind up annoying the killer a little. Especially with people being hooked the third time, instead of having their timer go down. Oh no, you're slightly delayed.
---
Only downside I can see is that it might encourage slugging mentalities in killers, which of course.. isn't very fun. But even with that, you've got some perks you can use to counterplay like adrenaline or the one that lets you get back up that I'm blanking on the name of. 
---
Maybe it'd be a little better for them if it went with your numbers for the Obsession, but anyone else with it the effect is maybe cut in half?
---
That would also make it so that it's got it's own danger - increased chance of being the obsession.  I'm assuming moris/headsplosion/bleeding out wouldn't trigger the effect, just sacrifices?  In which case, again, you have plenty of counterplay available if you are that afraid of it.
---
I like how this is a joke, yet people are somehow taking this perk that literally requires you to DIE and complaining that its OP because it gives the equivalent of a pallet stun
---
SWF group 
---
Seems they have by passive aggressively downvoting me without reply. 
---
and for high rank survivors : LET ME OUT. LET ME OUTTTT
---
This 44 bout to go off 
---
We still have over-powered Killers and under-powered ones (I guess ony Freddy is considered to be UP right now). Useless perks still come in insane numbers. Useless items/addons haven't been touched. But yeah, the game got noticeably better balanced, which is good.
---
not pre-nerf. not 100%
---
Moris fall under the ‚Äúkill‚Äù category, cause that‚Äôs what the action is called. Thanks for the feedback.
---
Are you on PC or Console? I always see the data tracked on PC. Might need to do an experiment on console for my own sake of knowing most popular killer and such.
---
Also, as a side note, I'd suggest either banging these games out fast or waiting like a month after the Plague comes out. That'll be a huge data skew as everyone tries the new survivor and killer and their perks.
---
the survivors at rank 1 are all immersed claudettes these days though, it's gross. all the good players are deranking to avoid the terrible rank 1s so you're more likely to have a harder game around rank 8 at least.
---
they need to make it harder to get to rank 1 because the emblem system had kind of spoiled it. rank 1 is the new rank 10.
---
Quality shitpost.
---
Yeah theres nothing bad about a 30 hours player getting an impossible match up. Flawless logic
---
While this is good balancing, I would prefer if the game just cancelled if it was a 1v1. It just changes the game too much when there's only one other person you're facing or when you're alone. 
---
Oh deer
---
You know I want a video game tattooo, just don't know if I want it to be DBD
---
Susie is that you?
---
My first video game themed tattoo was the renegade and paragon symbols from mass effect. But I thought why not get a dbd tattoo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Your comment clearly says that you absolutely have no idea on what you are talking about. It's not easy to cleanse all the totems. 
---
Interesting idea but it'd be great if these came with some reference art. 
---
Wow. Sociopaths. Lol. I don't have much to say about that. But I will say that I 50/50 both sides these days, and I've been camped quite a bit. Here's my take on it.
---
 Sometimes I feel like a lot of survivors have **only** played this game. I've been juggled in fighting games with no way to recover. Spawn killed in shooters. No way to participate in the game since you respawn and die immediately. Enemy champ gets fed in DOTA, nothing you can really do besides die. Know what I did? I got over it and got into another match. Because not every match will be like the ones I described. This isn't me saying "git gud" either. This is me saying that some people don't know how to let things go. If being "unable to participate" in a game affects people this much then I hate to see how they cope with actual problems.
---
Oh and anyone who would call someone a sociopath over the actions they do in a versus multiplayer game probably has a weak understanding of sociopathic tendencies. They probably don't understand empathy either.
---
JASON
---
I was going to get one but the Tattoo shop lobby wait time was way to long.
---
Wait, Billyboy doesn't start with an H...
---
Only time camping is allowable, in my opinion, is when the gates are open or when their teammates are literally right there. I'm not leaving if your teammates are playing dumb, sorry. Same with tunneling. If someone unhooks you when I've only walked five feet away, of course I'm going to go after the injured person, that just makes sense. 
---
On the flip side, there are definitely people who focus their entire playstyle around camping and tunneling and I don't understand that. It just doesn't seem fun. Though, admittedly, some builds require it (specifically dying light, sorry obsession.) I'm glad Decisive Strike will help with tunneling now. 
---
Also, what annoys me even more than someone camping me, is three teammates circling me to try and save me. Like, no, idiots, go do gens. I usually kill myself if my teammates are playing stupid like this. Otherwise, I spitefully chill on hook for as long as I can, just to insure my team gets as much time to do what they need to do. You may get a kill camper, but you're not getting a lot of bloodpoints or pips, sorry mate.
---
The most underrated perk set up is Ruin, Overwhelming, Unnerving, Lullaby with Iridicent Button And Stolen Mural Sketch. Tag someone and watch as the sudden spike of skillcheck failures fly on the screen. 
---
Only thing in that list I have even a slight issue with is balanced landing. But only on certain maps like haddonfield. Can make certain loops on a few maps damn near infinite if not actual infinite.
---
Though it‚Äôs not toxic, that‚Äôs dumb.
---
Are they going to release a unranked queue at some point? I feel it'd help chill some salt with people.
---
Like I don't give a shit about ranks at all so in some games I run perks just to mess with killers. Like running Small Game and kill all the dull totems so when the gates go up they got no NOED. 
---
But it also sucks that I might get grouped in with a bunch of tryhards because I'm not running the best builds 24/7 and playing to win vs playing for fun. I don't care if people want to tryhard, just don't force me to be involved in it. 
---
Rubbish perk. 
---
This is so true lol. 
---
I definitely understand it‚Äôs a guess if your team did a totem. I just don‚Äôt know why we can‚Äôt try to push that as a way to play so more people do it. Just work as a team and do 1 totem at the minimum and if you find one without going out of your way then do it too 
---
Youre wrong, his name is short for Hill William
---
&gt;I do it all the time and never get banned
---
You are just getting lucky because most people can't be bothered to take the time to report someone. Eventually you will come across someone who properly report you.
---
OP itself had the perfect opportunity to report someone but because he didn't know about the in-game report requirement, that person went free. 
---
I actually think it's overrated. Like 10% of the time it's useful healing you mid-chase or off the hook. 90% of the time you are already healed, nowhere near the killer and now exhausted. 
---
Although against Freddy waking up is pretty useful but Freddy players are incredibly rare too. 
---
Darn :f 
---
I‚Äôd argue Trapper or Amanda are the most balanced. 
---
Sorry but they look god awful.
---
Sorry but they look hideous.
---
Well, I did this chart thinking in a 1VS1 KYF game. I wish I could play in KYF with only one friend
---
I'd be more on board with this if camping wasn't such a terrible strategy that only gets rewarded when survivors pick up the idiot ball and hook rush you. Yeah, you can't do anything when you're camped. I get it. I've been camped. But the other three people have a basically free escape if they focus on gens. 
---
There are a lot of games where you can't "participate in the game" due to the actions of your opponent. People need to stop acting like DBD is unique in this department.
---
I sent a DM with my address! I hope to get one!
---
This is beyond science 
---
Make your choicenon hag.. that‚Äôs evil. Love it
---
eeeeeee tell ppl in chat that when I flap it means hunter is gone out of the area
---
Needs to be put in the game immediately. 
---
What if my answer to getting tunneled and camped is yes?
---
I mean if I can get the killer away from my team and waste his time at the cost of my survival specifically with camping I¬¥m happy. 
---
As for the killer side, if somebody gets unhooked right in front of me when I just left the hook 3s ago, I¬¥m sorry but you are the easier target so what do you expect me to do.
---
Call me an entitled killer main all you want, but thats my opinion.
---
Current?, i believe it got changed so its only counter to tunelling  in the game 
---
All you need to do is cleanse 1 totem each with one person cleansing 2.
---
If you really hate it so much. Run small game. It's that simple.
---
Or even better? Don't be stupid and reckless just because the gates are powered?
---
You are supposed to be doing your lover, dummy!
---
I'm convinced that most of this sub consists of Rank 15 survivors, or people who are boosted.
---
I'm not saying every killer in every situation is garbage, but the amount of, "No, I will NOT adapt my playstyle!" baby rage is just too much.
---
Yeah, killer mains can be whiny as shit too, and I don't think any of the perks survivors have make them "toxic". If the whole team is DS'ing off my shoulder because they're always going someplace far away from hooks, I might get frustrated, but that's just how the balls rolls.
---
I like both, but disc makes noise which is sometimes really helpful (like knowing to break a chase). It's also handy right at the start to tell you where multiple survivors spawned and works on decommissioned gens. They can even work together if you really want to have a gen control build...(although I'd only think about that for killers that can do chases really well)
---
H
---
Yeah true it just kinda made me stop caring as much about the bloodpoint offerings in the web as much as items or add-ons. 
---
That's implying I'm the killer in this scenario.
---
Beat build would be a huntress lullaby build as long as you have that and can hit your hatchets you should be fine
---
The map is Suplex City. Perks?
---
German Suplex - he just straight up plants the killer into the ground as soon as he sees them, stunning them until the match ends. 
---
F5 - activated ability where he puts the killer on his shoulders and hooks them.  
---
Roid Rage - seeing the killer fills him with rage, and he instantly disconnects from the match while still keeping any bloodpoints earned.
---
Yeah it sucks that pallets hit killers from miles away
---
So *edgy* .
---
Yea adrenaline is really powerful, but also situational and requires to actually do your objective to get a one time reward. Often it also gets wasted since you were already healthy and not getting chased. NOED on the other hand requires you to fail your objective in the first place yet you get a huge reward. Also if the survivors cleansed all the totems that just means you STILL had around 3 extra minutes of time before gens got completed.
---
I've no idea why people react to Noed as if it's a win-switch.
---
I play both sides, and usually use Noed on my Trapper. It's literally just a last-ditch effort to get some hooks when the survivors are poised to escape.
---
People talk about it as if it isn't a Hex perk. Do you know what happens when I'm playing Survivor and Noed comes on?
---
I find the totem, and break it. No more Insta-down stalemate.
---
Do you know what happens when I'm playing Killer and Noed comes on?
---
Either I get a hook or two, or my totem is broken and the survivors get out.
---
It's a perk, and not only is it there to help the Killer, it's also taking the place of any other potential Perk. The whining over both Noed and DS is absurd. Does it feel bad to get one-shorted, or to get DS'd? Sure, but it's not as if there isn't counterplay.
---
Y'all need to chill out.
---
Disgusting
---
Yeah... "gEn rUshIng Is tOxIc!" Ok, if you aren't chasing me right now, am I just supposed to sit on my ass? No, I'm going to do what my role as a survivor is.
---
Wonder what rank they were. 
---
When I was learning shit, I knew about the hatch. I knew it opened when you were the last one alive. I also heard something about it only opening after some number of gens were done. I found a purple key in a chest and ended up being the last one alive. 
---
I spent probably 10 minutes looking for the hatch to open it with the key. Super immersed as a rank 19 level 5 Meg. Again, I thought the hatch was always somewhere, but only OPENED when the right number of gens were done. Surely this magical key would bypass this.
---
Instead, it only spawns when a number of gens are done and will always open if you're the last alive and it has spawned. Lesson learned. Felt bad after the fact when I went to google to learn about the hatch mechanics. Found out I just wasted 10 minutes of the killer's time for no reason. 
---
Ewwwwww overwhelming presence
---
They can't keep a survivor party together until there's dedicated servers. So, hey, maybe expect it over the summer.
---
That's all you have to do. 
---
Depends how the match is going. If I manage to get a down before first gen, I'm off to patrol gens. If gens are done or being done near hooked survivor, I'm patrolling. 
---
I only tunnel if I need to remove someone from the game. It's the best choice realisitically. Instead of hitting a person twice, and unhooked survivor is one smack away from another hook state. Sure it sucks for the hooked survivor, but as a killer it is much easier to win a 3 v 1 than a 4 v 1. 
---
Say 3 gens have been done and a fourth and possible fifth is on the way. You need to remove 1 person asap. If people are more relaxed with gens being done I spread the damage to maximize the blood points I gain. 
---
Tl;dr. Tunneling doesnt give much blood points but can help swing the game in your favour. 
---
Tunneling one person down if need be then avoid doing so the rest of the match is a very common playstyle.  
---
Too afraid of needles lol
---
PRAISE THE SPIDER GOD
---
The thing with 'Gen Rushing' is it IS a problem...but it's not a survivor problem, if that makes sense. It's a balance problem. Like you say, the goal of survivors is to do gens and escape. If BHVR found ways to add additional survivor goals or to balance timings on gens, or maybe give killers other tools to help slow games down.
---
So at the end of the day I understand why killers don't like 'gen rushing', but they should be looking to BHVR instead of survivors for solutions. 
---
\*NOED intensifies\*  
---
After match:  
---
"meh you camped me"

lmao

Now your totem is gonna survive 5 seconds.

r/theletterh r/theletterd
---
This comment cured my cyst.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea. I couldn‚Äôt decide on a single perk I would like so I just got the icons. 
---
Only if you think the current pip system is a good one, which most people don‚Äôt.
---
If you get chased for 5 minutes while your team mates do all the gens/gates you‚Äôre definitely the MVP, but you‚Äôll get just 1 medal and de-pip because you never had a chance to do anything else.
---
Toit
---
*CINDERALLA, CINDERALLA* 
---
*ALL I HEAR IS CINDERALLA!*
---
Of course I love it. It‚Äôs my job to loop the killer while my buddies gen rush them for that sweet 4 man adrenaline then if the killer does get me (usually that sweet noed because my friends were being doofuses and not cleansing them dulls) I‚Äôll take my face camp like a champ if it means my friends escape.
---
Neither does getting banned for salt
---
very informative thank u
---
Oh got it, didnt saw the 1k hrs lul
---
Oh I know, but this take on it... the immature kid in me keeps chuckling at it 
---
Where is this from?
---
What's the song?
---
You can do whatever you want and play however you want, it doesn't change the fact that NOED is just a lazy perk if you use it as a crutch outside of some EndGame builds like Freddy's.
---
You'll never get better at the game, which is fine if thats what you want, but that is not something to brag about, its pretty sad.
---
*People are never going to be happy about losing* YOU, not "people". This game is not a competitive game so it doesn't matter because you're supposed to just play it as long as you have fun and even then what does even "losing" mean? For some people it is depiping, for others is not getting a 4k, for others is getting less than 3k, etc. You are building your own jail around you.
---
If you are so worried about what other people have to say about the way you play maybe you unconsciously agree with them.
---
He's not Rock in Fast Five sweaty though
---
It‚Äôs the exact opposite for me when I play nurse, I‚Äôm a foot away after teleporting and I still don‚Äôt hit em
---
As a person who plays both sides I recon looping and the 'toxic' perks are okay, theycare annoying for sure but don't make me wanna DC. The thing that really gets me is face camping or taunting the killer
---
The Billhilly.
---
Needs a buff, not strong enough 
---
It's not necessarily op, but really badly designed. Gives no benefit to the user and would be super fucking annoying to the killer. Because unavoidable stuns are really interesting and fun gameplay. That's why ds was changed.
---
This just about sums up the whole fucking game.
---
You can pry NOED for my Piggy builds from my cold dead hands. 
---
Instadown build: NOED, Rancor, Devour Hope, &amp; Make Your Choice. 
---
Endgame build: NOED, Remember Me, Blood Warden, &amp; Fire Up. 
---
I would agree, but idk since console doesn‚Äôt have post game chat üòÇ
---
A guy doing a Tetris song.
---
Then the servers shut down cause now nobody is playing killer anymore
---
I mean if I feel like they have I‚Äôll just check on them when their hooked.
---
Wait a week, and you'll be a loser again! New achievements you won't have!
---
O o p s .
---
Too bad there aren't two perks the tell you where they are... OH WAIT
---
dOeSnT cOuNt WhEn SurViVoRs bABy rAGe
---
Hex totems are either out in the open or spawned 15 feet from survivors. Hopefully the next patch fixes some elements of that.
---
A killer version of Hope and practically just as meh. No thanks. 
---
for me, shadowborn makes all the difference for nurse on console. for whatever reason, her blinks seem to make more sense and the frame rate issues are less of a problem with it equipped.
---
Cringe normie xd lol jk dont tell the principal this is pretty funny guys XD
---
&gt; Well if you play well survivors should not get all generators done.
---
The best killers in the world still have games where they tryhard and 5 gens still get done. 
---
Yup! I was definitely going to try that. Vision is a bitch lol
---
Killer/survivor perks used, as well as which maps were played. Maybe also frequency of mori's used?
---
The words that i wrote dipshit
---
If you just didn't put "(OC)", I would've taken this post better, liar! 
---
A strange game, the only way to win is not to play
---
Best killers in the game still sometimes fail. What a shocker.
---
How y'all look when you say it's too hard to find totems when they spawn in the same spots and you refuse to use the 2 perks made to help people find them.
---
I mean, I just play how I enjoy. People get so hung up on 'winning.' Like, if I run a killer for five gens and die for it, I'm fine with it because it was fun to do. If I sit on gens and don't see the killer the entire game and survive, I consider it a bad game because it was boring.  
---
&gt; Best killers in the game still sometimes fail. What a shocker.
---
That sounds like a balance issue ü§î
---
You are trying yo buff the already powerful side of him. Whats the point in giving the dude a free hit at the beginning of every chase when he already does that pretty well. This buff wouldn't make him any more viable. Wraiths main weakness is his m1 nature. In short he gets looped a lot and cant do shit about it
---
Neither of us are wrong. Idk why I'm being down voted for a legitimate strategy lol. Imagine trying to win in a game
---
Spoken like a true survivor main who has only played rank 20 killer lol
---
I disagree with that. A while ago I went up against a LF who actually did nothing but facecamp from start to finish of the game. Our entire group instantly recognized this and just started doing gens and hiding when he got close. However, he was still able to kill two people on hook before all gens were done, and ended up killing me when he found me opening an exit gate, resulting in only one person was able to escape. 
---
Best case scenario is 10 seconds with survivors that you can kill blindfolded. 
---
Decent survivors can capitalize on DS to the point where you've wasted 1-2 gens once it's all said and done. Then there's the surprise DS.
---
You get punished for winning a chase, which is frustrating and obnoxious. Now it will punish killers for tunneling, which is awesome
---
It's really not
---
F for our trooper
---
Legion player is insulting me lol
---
The devs are currently balancing the game to be a lot better than it used to be. My point stands: Enduring should affect DS' stun. Too bad for the survivor who happens to be unlucky enough to use DS against a killer who runs Enduring.
---
We stand together!
---
The legion legion, United and strong
---
Freddy should have been the seperate low tier "Just don't"
---
The meme we needed, but not the one we deserved. Thank you OP
---
Yeah I gave up on Self Care as soon as Aftercare came out. I'd much rather find my teammates and know exactly where they are and what's going on for the rest of the game. 
---
I see what you mean tho I guess I just can't relate :/
---
&gt; but that is not something to brag about, its pretty sad.
---
It's also a non-competitive videogame. I'm not bragging, but I'm also not concerned with people who want to lose their shit and try to claim some type of moral victory over the fact they died in a game that literally no one cares about, stat wise.
---
I'm also not saying that balance shouldn't be tossed to the wind, simply because this isn't an e-sports viable game, but people have offered up a multitude of ways to counter NOED which lots of people do at the higher ranks. If you want to dig your heels in and claim you shouldn't have to, that's fine. Complain away.
---
Or invite you over to watch some "videotapes"
---
I was thinking that his power would work similar to the Huntress/Trapper/Clown in which he can only carry so many. He would have to find more once his were used up. I‚Äôve wanted the exit gates one for a while and I don‚Äôt even really play Killer, I‚Äôm a survivor main. I just think it‚Äôs one aspect of the game that the killer can‚Äôt really affect expect with that one Freddy perk. 
---
As a killer who runs NOED, I‚Äôve never had all my totems cleansed before the last gen. And that‚Äôs with most of my games having 4 survivors still alive till the end. Finding the active totem after NOED triggers is the only strategy I‚Äôve seen work
---
What other perks do you like to run alongside shadowborn? 
---
Imagine getting rank rewards at the end of season, might give some incentive.
---
OC My ass
---
Just gonna leave this here so I can find this again
---
He is if you don't have good headphones.
---
Add me. Halthus23. Idgaf what people do and I've never been able to do kill your friends. 
---
I mean, gens get done super quickly by groups so  it's not like having a second objective for survivors is super bad. 
---
Because when i try to outplay/counter them, they try their best to pull out that sweet moonwalking or staying out of the chase bull crap. Not everyone will do it, but even if 4 out of 10 do it, it's still feels like shit.
---
I get the want to compare NOED and DS, but I would argue that while Adrenaline exists, NOED is fine. When all four survivors completely ruin any semblance of end game pressure by healing to full, it makes me much less inclined to complain about a free one-shot down perk.
---
Notice I never said NOED was OP or that you shouldn't use it, what I said is that I find it a lazy perk if used as a "just in case" perk, because that makes you dependant on that pretty strong perk to win.
---
Another reason I never jump on the NOED bitching bandwagon is because I don't see it THAT much, I find a lot of killers that don't use it because they don't need it, and can use that perk slot with any other perk that enhances their playstyle.
---
Managing the rhythm of the match is very important for killers, and endgame is something that you want to handle differently than early, mid or late game. But if you run the "just in case" NOED, you'll never worry about endgame because whatever, if they get the gens you have NOED.
---
I myself run NOED with Freddy every now and then, but because I have an endgame build with Remember Me, Fire UP and Dying Light, so I play basically perkless till endgame so I'll probably get to endgame with 4 survivors not on death hook. There I think NOED won't hurt you getting better as a player.
---
My point is: play however you want, but if you want to get better at the game,  crutch NOED is preventing you from learning.
---
Death is not escape an. 
---
I remember the good ol days when there was like 2000 people playing and everyone understood the struggle meant don‚Äôt come.
---
Because that means you need to actually start using your brains. We can't have that.
---
What is everyone‚Äôs definition of winning? Making it out alive? I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all had games where the most useless survivor makes it out piggybacking on the work of others. 
---
If you‚Äôre playing right you‚Äôll pip up or safety pip. Just freaking play and you get rewarded but people are greedy. Survivor objectives are boldness, altruism, objectives, survival. Those 4 emblems are broken up into smaller objectives with one of them being escaping alive. 
---
Killer objectives are deviousness, sacrifice, brutality, and hunting. Stop people from doing gens (and this means stopping people from getting the door. Survivors can still get the hatch and you get good amount of points since they don‚Äôt get all the gens), literally hooking people and sacrificing them to the entity, stopping people from helping each other, and chasing them down. 
---
Two of the major objectives result in ending the survivor‚Äôs run if done well. Some survivors can do everything right but unless they make it out alive they won‚Äôt be satisfied. As a killer I feel no sympathy and as a survivor I‚Äôm tired of hearing the bitching from other survivors. Also some killers feel like the game wasn‚Äôt good unless they got every last person. Just play
---
üòÇüòÇ I tried it the other way and I just looked weird 
---
Finger guns for Ace is the only option!
---
Someone should tell that second Dev Team that with every bug they fix, they give us 5 new bugs..
---
Did you also put this in the Assassin's Creed Reddit Forum?? xD
---
And I was saying they shouldn't be mad about adrenaline because they have an answer for it. Both are strong end game perks that counter each other
---
Exactly. I don't see what the big fuss about DS is anyhow, because it gives you 3.5 seconds to run away and in most instances they get downed a few seconds later anyway. So if anything it's more of an "inconveniance". And if not, the killer just drops your ass all the way to the hook or purposely make you miss the skill check.
---
I mean, I got to Rank 1 as Nurse without NOED, then the next month I got back to Rank 1 with Spirit. I mention this, and people then complain that I use Nurse. I learned a long time ago that it's pointless to play a game in a way to make your opponent happy, because they'll rarely be happy that they lose, and someone will always want to start a fight.
---
I just use NOED every now and then because I can, and it might help me secure a kill on a killer who sucks at pressuring gens, especially if the survivors know what they're doing.
---
And despite the first thing I said, if people aren't being dicks, I do actually try to ensure that all of us are having a fun game. I don't tunnel or camp, and I try to make sure everyone gets hooked at least once before actually trying to get someone killed, though this may change if the survivors are stomping me, and playing in this manner is just a handicap.
---
I just get kind of tired about all of this circle jerking over certain perks and builds being OP, UP, and the hatred thrown towards the people who use them. Honestly, no one cares about DBD. No one is going to care if you get 0 kills all knight, or 4k every match. No one cares about escape rates.
---
People can make the criticisms and pleas for balance, but all of this fighting needs to stop, because it's pointless.
---
This sub doesn't know what it wants. On the one hand people agree that gen rush is a problem. That survivors can get gens done too quickly. But people are also complaining about NOED and that clearing totems will take too much time for survivors. 
---
I just want more bloodpoints man
---
Not really seeing as bamboozle and trapper can completely destroy, call it situational if you want but its also very situational a survivor is running BL on Haddonfield
---
it is totally dumb that trapper can block off those windows permanently unless survivors want to trip them with their feet
---
I mean the OLD ones, which has like 4 seconds of use
---
Well, I mean out of all of them the only one I could see being your friend is The Spirit, because she was never inherently evil. She was a normal person with a normal life until, y‚Äôknow
---
Consoles are now getting Bots?  haven't seen those in over a year
---
I cant find the friday bug report threads and this happened on ps4
---
You know I don't really understand the influx of Ru Paul memes on this sub. But I can't say I'm not happy about them
---
Wraith is in a perfect state at the moment imo wraith is what killers like LF, Freddy, tapper get balanced around easy to pick up with moderate power 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs a completely understandable scenario. I‚Äôd hope that Behavior shows more leniency/sympathy to new player infractions on stuff like this. 
---
The chase is the hardest part of playing survivor and it will take time to learn how to loop the killer. It's really just practice that works best, though you can look up guides on youtube. Just search survivor tips or some such thing.
---
I'd suggest trying to play a bit stealthy until you get the hang of things. If you hear the heartbeat, get of the gen and *don't run*, but walk or crouch away. I don't know what survivor you play, but in general, it'll get easier as you unlock new perks as well. 
---
If you can, play with a friend or a group of friends. Especially if they have experience. They'll be able to run the killer for you and give you tips as they watch you play. Even if they're not experienced, it can be far more fun to play survivor if you have someone to complain with lol. 
---
Unless you're face-camped on a hook, you always have the chance to do something else.
---
Lol what is legion doing on this tier list? they are a survivor.
---
We aren't cysters tho. So I don't ever want you talking to me. 
---
It's not a joke? OP is in the comments arguing about it.
---
I really don't like punishing someone for running a perk and using it the way it was intended to work. I might slug in specific situations, but not as a, "fuck you" to someone just playing.
---
yes im saving bp for jane, she‚Äôs a queen
---
both too early.
---
I‚Äôll give it a shot! 
---
Why do I know this video? Why? I‚Äôm questioning my life choices.
---
Rank 1 will stay shit until they add end of season rewards. Couple hundred thousand bloodpoints is all they would have to do. It's mind boggling that they don't have these feature already. I have both my rank 1 achievments (they're not even hard to get, you just have to grind it out for a month) so why would I subject myself to the torture that is 4 man SWF flashlight t-bag squad/nurse and billy bros at rank 1. No thanks. These days I just pop the dc every few games or so as the killer is death hooking me.
---
GOD I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. I KNOW KILLERS NEEDED SOME BUFFS BUT GODDAMN THIS IS GETTING OUT OF HAND. STOP NERFING SURVIVORS GODDAMN IT.
---
only too early, the only reason it can be too late is if the killer turns around. you can get late flashlight saves if the killer is a 4head
---
I think Thrill of the Hunt would be okay, but it's fine as is. I like having it as a buffer where they could break Thrill of Hunt instead of the totem I'm actually trying to protect.
---
As mentioned, that Haunted Grounds would be overpowered, unless the time is severely limited. Think about it, five totems means five minutes of the exposed status. When games can go anywhere from 5-15 minutes, that's too much time. 
---
(Plus, on a personal note, I like running Haunted Ground with other hexes so that all five totems light up, and there's a 2/5 chance that they don't get an actual totem I want to protect if they get a totem.)
---
Spirit. They nerfed decisive into the ground
---
Maybe you can stop seeing posts about the shittiest possible totem spawn when it's fixed
---
When you try to justify cheating...
---
no
---
I have a bloodborne and bioshock tat, idk about getting a dbd one
---
I think it beats eating it when there's no hook within juggling distance. Plus people running DS are often also the ones teabagging and clicking flashlights. At that point I got negative sympathy
---
This sub is extremely toxic, because they see everything else as toxic. Using DS is 'toxic', using NOED is 'toxic', hitting someone on the hook is 'toxic, gen rush is 'toxic' etc. Everybody expects the game to be played by their own made up rules. Survivors expect killers to not tunnel, not camp, and not use certain perks because otherwise they are seen as toxic. Killers expect survivors to not gen rush, not vault constantly and not use certain perks for the same reasons. People were complaining for WEEKS that Legion was weak and useless and now I only see people complain about how Legion is too strong and too powerful. People say that gen rush is a problem, and that survivors get gens done too quickly, but also complain that clearing totems to counter NOED takes too much time for survivors. Like, how does that even make sense? It's just ridiculous.
---
Yeah, it's a real *bitch* to use your eyes.
---
Don't hate me for this, but why the D for Spirit and Clown?
---
you don‚Äôt have to wear the head :D
---
I don't mind letting them win, but it's boring, in my opinion, to just mess around. So I play the game as per usual, and if they get the exit gates open before I down someone, I usually let that person go, or if it's the hatch, I don't mind letting the survivor take it. 
---
As survivor, I do enjoy killers like you though, haha. Always good to have a farm game every now and again.
---
Depends. It's bad depending on the situation, but if you time the transition and mindgame it knowing the survivor sees you twice during the transition, you get a free hit to star the chase. Don't start the transition on someone you intend to chase at max range. 
---
I agree that Spirit has the potential to be the second best killer, because just like Nurse, she does not have realiable counterplay. She does have more counterplay, though, and her ability can be to her own detriment much more so than Nurse's. I subscribe to the common(?) notion that Spirit takes Billy's place on the ranking sheet given competent survivors, since those would be able to consistently do well in chases against Billy, but not Spirit, not consistently.
---
I do stick by my impression that PTB-Spirit did not have this potential. Precisely because she had reliable counterplay. You were always able to tell whether she was actually phasing or not, by watching her character model, or making 8 meters of distance - so the entire element of fake-out phasing did not exist (same for fake-out vaulting, by the way: in the PTB, Spirit phased through the vault, so you could actually tell whether she was vaulting or not). Likewise, due to directional phasing sound, you could actually play around her phasing reactively in the PTB, whereas now, without directional information, you can mostly only do so predictively. That's a major difference and made her ability a much more potent tool, and notably so in chases. She does have more audible footsteps now, but once you hear those, it is regularly already too late.
---
Ikr? It's a game and I'll do what I want, better yet, if I never interacted on social media platforms no one could tell me shit about anything I used in game. 
---
Because his weapon doesn't have a one hit down. Yes he is good without Noed but Noed makes him even better and there is no reason why a killer or survivor would want to run less advantageous perks.
---
Hummm hum hummmmm xd
---
YOUR ROLE IS NOT A COUNTER TO A GAME MECHANIC OR AT THE MOST IT SHOULDNT BE. SOMETIMES I CAN STOP THEM IF I FIND THEM FIRST AND THEY DONT KNOW WHERE IT IS, AND IT PUNISHES MY POINTS WHEN THEY LEAVE THROUGH IT! NOW I ONLY GET GOLD IN DEVOUT AND IN THE NEXT PATCH ONLY SILVER. JUST CAUSE A MECHANIC I HAVE NO COUNTERPLAY TO. 
---
Just as a heads up, anything regarding separate info for SWF vs Solo is impossible until maybe dedicated where they change how connections work. At least if they were smart that is when they would change/fix that oversight.
---
Right now, any SWF group is basically broken up once they join a killer lobby and there is no tracking of who was SWF before or after the game. That's why SWF has to reform after each game; the game doesn't know who was what so it assumes everyone is solo.
---
Am i the only one who thinks that ALL perks and items for killers and survs are fair use as they are in the game.
---
Eat some gingersnaps
---
The only time I do that is when survivors are being dicks. Teabagging, mostly, and being overly altruistic to the point where they're all hovering around the hook the moment I hook someone.
---
 But at that point it's not camping, it's just not being a moron and leaving a hook that is swarming with survivors.
---
Survivors aren't meant to be powerful like the killer.
---
How y'all mf look when you bitch about NOED every 5 seconds when you simply counter itü§∑
---
Plenty of people care! Just look at this post lol
---
Not justifying it at all I'm just saying he probably wasn't lagswitching because he couldn't catch her but because she was being toxic, thats not supporting his actions just saying tjat the lagswitching doesn't inherently mean he's bad, he's just being toxic back
---
There happy now that I had to clarify that for you
---
Images that you can hear
---
Holy shit are we agreeing that both sides can be toxic on this Reddit? Damn
---
Dude, I was joking. No need to be an ass.
---
While No Mither's a terrible perk, it's still hilarious to use with a sabo build, the Killer's gotta wait time either hooking you or just slugging you and then letting you pick yourself up. 
---
I really hate it when that happen, and also why does some time the map have like a dead area like this ?
---
THIS IS A VERY GOOD IDEA AND MORE PEOPLE SHOULD DO THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK MOST OF THE WIGGLING SURVIVORS ARE ACTUALLY SMART ENOUGH TO REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE.
---
Knew it was gonna be Monto's video before I even clicked, wasn't disappointed. 
---
Now that's just too damn easy lol
---
A lot of her addons feel pretty 'meh' tbh. She's probably pretty low down on their list of things to work on though, so I doubt we really see any serious changes to her any time soon :(
---
When blood warden is up and u stand by the exit gates
---
YOU PRESENCE IS THE COUNTERPLAY , YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT YOU DONT HAVE TO HIDE WHILE SEARCHING, WE HAVE BW FOR GATE  BUT HATCH NEEDS THEM TO BE THE LAST ALREADY - JUST SHOULDNT HURT YOUR SAC MEDAL IS ALL
---
If it was a joke maybe don't take answers to it too serious? I joked aswell obviously :)
---
Yeah I love having the grab animation show up for like a solid second and then just randomly change into a hit animation. Especially when you're playing something like Jumpscare Myers or Spirit. Extremely tilting shit.
---
Not me. I love playing killer but I basically feel bad in every match I do to well in. I like to do well, but I almost never try to go for 4ks simply because I know survivors really love that good old hatch escape. Sometimes I'll give chase and stress them out to make it even more exhilarating for them. I just want everyone to have a good time, that's the whole reason we're all playing.
---
Same thing happened to me except the rest of the dudes team starting roasting him and calling him a worthless teammate for not doing any gens. It was a good time.
---
Or use anti gen rush perks like ruin, and the new one coming out. If you don't use good perks that may be why you get gen rushed.
---
IF IT DIDNT HURT MY POINTS I WOULDNT CARE IF THE LAST ONE GOT AWAY, NOW I WILL HAVE TO SLUG THE 3RD AND MAKE THE GAME LAST EVEN LONGER, SORRY EVERYONE ELSE I WANT TO WIN.
---
I play killer at rank 1 and Ruin isnt necessary,I can 4k without it,noed or any op addons.If noed was instadown only on the first hit after all gens pop then it wouldnt be a crutch,but now it is.Adrenaline isnt.Mori's end the game way faster compared to keys,and if you tunnel and mori people(what most people do with moris)then they wont even have time to do 2 gens for the hatch to even spawn.And I think 24 second self care and 15 pallets per map is balanced,not 40 second self care and 8 pallets per map.Call it however you want to,I call it nerfing because they get weaker every patch.And thank you for personally attacking me and calling me a little shit,really appreciated.Shows how nice this subreddit is :\^)
---
I've started playing a couple months ago but I have an understanding of survivor perks that I see a bunch and are useful. Self care, adrenaline, decisive strike, sprint burst, balanced landing, boil over,borrowed time, calm spirit... I mean there's still more but that's what I see. Oh and we'll make it is great for any healer build you're running 
---
You mean they are without Mori even after all the nerfs? For me it feels like I don't have 2K as killer only if I played really bad even without tunneling
---
What would stop the person you save from abandoning you if you go down? It's basically a suicidal perk.
---
It could be a meme perk if it specifically only puts you into the injured state, i.e. won't down you. Then it would be usable with No Mither (free heal for the saved person and you're injured anyway) or the very rare case of 2 people hooked in the basement and you have Deliverance (unhook yourself, save + auto heal).
---
Also mildly "counters" Make Your Choice (the killer will have only 1 one-hit target).
---
Still a meme.
---
I'm saying that's why all the nerfs are happening.
---
I started running sloppy butcher as Doctor. I would injure somebody and put them in tier 3 if I see somebody working on a gen thanks to Restraint. I would then go there and do the same. A lot of people bring self care and this one tactic (along with juggling survivors) has really helped me to get more kills than I normally would.
---
It has matchmaking servers and ones to store your savedata
---
He's probably one of the people who abuse SWF this way. Whenever anyone posts about it you'll get responses like this from those guys. 
---
People take those unhooks or i get chased early on
---
I guarantee that‚Äôs exactly what he said in his language of spaghetti. 
---
Ah, nice. So not fixed then, lol.
---
But shouldn't both sides be balanced without obvious extremes (like Ivory/Ebony mori are and DS were)? 
---
Well... he was cheating to be toxic, she merely sat down fast a few times...
---
If you expect it then cleanse the totems. Bada bing bada boom, problems solved.
---
I dont know why but rank reset did not do anything to me. Like it took 2 pips but that's it, I stayed at rank 5. Anyone know how that happens?
---
i typically run ruin, bbq &amp; chili, shadowborn, and nurse's calling. i'll occasionally switch out ruin for whispers, but i've found the bit of extra pressure ruin gives you is more helpful.
---
Damn those are pretty good points it was kind of a silly idea 
---
Upvoted for DBZ meme
---
I think so 
---
I really hope we get some DBD action figures in the future
---
5 totems bud. 
---
And with those black voidful eyes, he stares at the cores of our souls. O_O 
---
Well, I won't deny that there are an awful lot of dickbags out there who love to taunt the killer because he got beaten. I've had my share of games where I go balls out 3 blink Nurse and score a 4k by being ruthless because my previous game I was slam dunked on as Myers with non-meta perks, and got teabagged / game held hostage with opened gates.
---
shaketh my head.
---
you foolish survivor mains... when shall you learn that your days of looping are numbered. hallowed by thy name for in due time lord mcote will bring his massive cock crashing down upon thee. you laugh at us now... but just you wait... you absolute FUCKING cretins. soon we will have ALL your crutch perks... adrenaline... borrowed time... especially that WRETCHED DIVERSION... SOON FILTHY SURVIVORS. the END for YOU draws NEAR.
---
the fattest /s
---
‚Äú(Killer)‚Äù
---
To be fair, you can right anything off when you simplify things to that level.
---
Cheating is bad, though yes.
---
Holy details!
---
As a cluad main, I can say that it do be like that. 
---
(I don‚Äôt actually hate NOED users, if we survivors want to genrush then we run the risk of encountering NOED, I play killer tons when I don‚Äôt have someone else to play with, so I know what it feels like to get genrushed and Bm‚Äôd. I can understand why killers bring it. &lt;3 to all the killer mains who put up with us survivors out there.)
---
Stake Out (because I'm lazy about focusing on hitting greats,) Hope (situational but helpful,) and Deliverance (wanted the unhook achievement and it grew on me.) 
---
Tinkerer, Pop Goes the Weasel, Mad Grit, and Rancor. They're all mid-tier perks I'd say, and mostly situational, but I love all four dearly. 
---
I am the big dumb.
---
Same though. I‚Äôll do unreasonable petty shit if I see someone DS. Like I‚Äôll hook em and then camp them til they die lol. Then I‚Äôll let the rest of their friends escape. 
---
My beautiful Puke Queen, soon you shall be mine
---
*places hand on screen and caresses it slowly*
---
Bring Small Game and try to remember where the totems that you found are at, hopefully you'll come across one that haven't seen yet and it's done.
---
Sure it's a pain in the arse but it's expected that most killers used noed. 
---
Dissapointment of the faithful.
---
WE WERE ROOTING FOR YOU
---
I like that analysis but now i like to imagine he got swole just watching them work lol
---
Maybe not tho, I mean survivors STILL have hope to get out alive.
---
Thy increase vault speed!?  Interesting 
---
I have to agree.  Survivors have all the tools they need to handle Noed, they just don't want to use them. 
---
I refuse to bring in a perk to just counter another perk that they could not have. The issue isnt really finding them either, it's the *time* you spend doing the totems.
---
Hnurse
---
Legion would be fun, but people would say they‚Äôre a bad influence
---
Those guys suck, even at high levels they touch your HP bars butt
---
Absolutely amazing craftsmanship and attention to detail! Do you plan on doing other characters as well? :D
---
I don‚Äôt think it will be useless at all, just not as good and more situational. I will actually start using it after the change to say fuck you to tunneling and camping killers
---
When players are assholes, we all suffer
---
Honestly not a bad idea. Combined with deliverance and it could make for some clutch plays. And I feel like "Don't look back" sounds like a much more suitable name lol. 
---
You could say Leatherface is smiling too, but then there would be no one in the ‚Äúmmm meat‚Äù category. ü§î
---
You're missing out. Lonesome Road is an incredible experience.
---
Haunted Grounds on Freddy is hilarious when I have a Class Photo add-on. Many d/c's  
---
Sure. Let all the 4 survivors spend enough time to go around the map searching in all the possible totem locations and then at some point magically assume that not even one totem got missed out. 
---
Back when a Brand New Part was super strong, there was a test that a KYF group did where survivors finished all the gens in \~2-3 minutes. They were also running No Mither and Resilience and all started on different gens or something like that. 
---
Recently, I know Puppers did a test on a single generator with four people and a similar set up and it was done in like 15 seconds, but that obviously wouldn't effect the whole game since the Brand New Parts were used up. 
---
I have no idea.
---
That's not memeing. That's exploiting, whenever I see a survivor do this on my gen and I'm survivor I miss skill checks on purpose. 
---
Yeah, I see that. It‚Äôs just that if the killer knows how to counter it then it loses a lot of value and takes up a perk slot. I‚Äôm my experience every time I was the obsession I would get led ton the ground for 1min after unhooking myself with deliverance 
---
I think a good balance would be to require 2 hooks before a mori. 
---
Ok true but when was the last time you played against a killer (in rank 10 and above) that doesn't use NOED? 
---
Pretty much every killer I go up against has NOED, hex ruin and BBnC.
---
It's expected.
---
I can confirm as a bill main that this is true..... unless NOED, then we go cause we know it's not worth it
---
Sloppy Butcher is so good because it now take a survivors even longer to heal with the recent(not that recent) nerfs to SELF Care and general healing 
---
Aside from that BBQ, Ruin and Monitor and Abuse, Nurses or Haunted Grounds are pretty meta
---
Honestly Nurse is the only adept I still need and even after the reset playing at rank 10 it makes me want to die.
---
*Survivor gets downed near you with your flashlight *
---
*you pop out of nowhere*
---
‚ÄúIM ROXXY ANDREWS AND IM HERE TOMAKE IT CLEAR‚Äù
---
Actually, NFL, I kinda like the idea of adding a counter to small game to indicate how many totems are left with out it actually telling the location.
---
play against me. I dont use it, Bloodwarden FTW
---
That was rank 10 AFTER rank reset, a nea with 4 teachable perks. AND she disconnected after getting found, so nope that was clearly an experienced survivor.
---
But yeah, new player shouldnt be banned tho. 
---
I mean, in my opinion it's easier to do in high ranks, where your teammates are good at running the killer and doing gens. At that point, you should know, more or less, where the totems spawn. I usually don't have an issue finding five throughout the course of the game. Besides, it's extra points, eh? 
---
Even if the totems don't get cleansed throughout the trial, when someone goes down to NOED during endgame, it's not hard for the other three to either leave or find the totem. It's people playing stupid when NOED is active that gives it so much power. And that's my opinion as someone who plays probably 70/30 survivor/killer. 
---
Survivors literally have nothing else to do!? 
---
It doesnt reward Killers for not patroling Gens, it punishes survivors that dont cleanse totems 
---
You can adapt my hidden blade design if you want, might need some tweaking to work over hand instead of under but it'd be worth a look.
---

Blood Warden is scary when it activates haha 
---
Ick.

I used to be a Freddy main
---
I can‚Äôt NOT upvote Jojo.
---
yep, Love the "oh shit" Moment, the teabagging claudette realises shes dead :D
---
Bbq &amp; chili/whispers, shadowborn, monitor &amp; abuse, nurse‚Äôs calling. 
---
If I‚Äôm not doing that well, I‚Äôll put ruin and stridor/something else for monitor and nurse‚Äôs. 
---
How's that a balance issue, both sides should have a fair chance at winning. If it's only one side winning once they get good then that sounds like a balance issue to me.
---
Even the best players sometimes failing to win isn't a sign of an unbalanced game, on the contrary actually. 
---
Randem?
---
I can't mori the shit out of you without getting closer.
---
That's not how you use this meme
---
As someone who plays a lot of both sides, I'd say borrowed time is toxic because it incentivises survivors to kill their teammates and make unsafe unhooks. 
---
You get 4 kills in matches too
---
Spirit is a tonne of fun and decisive is getting a heavy nerf so definitely go Spirit.
---
Self Care isnt worth running anymore with the healing debuff.
---
Sprint Burst forces you to walk everywhere you to use it properly, wasting an insane amount of time.
---
Boil Over is absolute trash, it's a perk you run when you have literally nothing else. 
---
Calm Spirit is only useful against two killers and isnt that common.
---
Also guys let‚Äôs not make this comment section a war zone he was obviously joking
---
In Haddonfield, Hex totems used to spawn in the center of the street, completely unobstructed. There were two separate spots where this could happen. Might as well just break it yourself.
---
I strongly disagree, it‚Äôs not the best whatsoever
---
Well said!
---
Are you saying rng as in traps spawn location? Otherwise put traps in less obv. spots. Sometimes a random trap in a random pathway will help out, in fact that trap usually gets on person trying to take the round about way to the gen cause your the trapper. Personally I like to put them in strong loops and then just chase through weak ones, better in the long run.
---
Pig and Trapper were actual psychos before the Entity, though.
---
You mean you gotta slow the game down 'just a bit?'
---
Ugh tea. I was so sad.  At least I have another asian cyst to root for. 
---
Leaving comments is really baffling. Not only can you turn your profile comments to private, but you can also just manually delete comments you don't like. If anything, someone with an open profile is a salt collector that wants those dumbass survivor comments.
---
They love answering softball questions and ignoring the pointed ones.
---
I like Iron Maiden the most because people hide in lockers to get out of the doctors electricity
---
I read it like a sigil, starting at the top.
---
Is not escape an death
---
I need a mori which would allow me to kill myself, DC'ing is not cool 
---
I find it funny that so many people complain about NOED, yet there is absolutely nothing wrong with a survivor meta that completes the game in 6ish minutes. I personally am tired of seeing most survivors running adrenaline, self care, dead hard, and 1 other perk, often prove thyself or sprint burst. Of those 3 of them reward a survivor for being bad and getting hit. (Mind you, this is your own logic)
---

I personally never use NOED, but it can get pretty infuriating that you can completely dominate in a match as killer and still lose if you play low tier killers against very good survivors. It's understandable why some killers will use NOED, it only annoys me when I see a high tier killer running it, especially Billy.
---
The gays‚Ñ¢ are invading.
---
JK we've always been here.
---
I mean you'd still hear ppl crying in post game lobby, but you can always leave before they say shit if you're killer ;)
---
My only complaint with Adrenaline is it proc'ing when unhooked, that some BS right there and maybe the fact it wakes you up from Freddy's dream world.
---
Self care isn't good after the healing nerfs, you waste too much time esp. if someone is running sloppy butcher. It's better to do gens and get healed by teammates instead.
---
Consider running iron will insetad of it, or botany + medkit with bonus charges. Much more time efficient.
---
Could be that they tried, but their tests ended up giving normally sighted people a huge advantage with CBmode turned on. Who knows.
---
Quick question. How many of them started off with toolboxes or was it just the one person? 
---
That‚Äôs what I thought! I asked this in a swf group and they said someone was bullshitting me lol 
---
Good survivors will save their DS if they know they cannot loop you afterwards. But REALLY good survivors will always go down where DS will be a problem for you
---
The quickest are when the killer DC'd on the match start haha
---
But probably the fastest was a AFK Killer, maybe 3-4 mins for gens
---
Spirit is better
---
Adrenaline and balanced landing are pretty much 100% takes on survivor, anything else can be substituted out but those two are ridiculously good.
---
For killer it really depends on the killer for most perk, but hex:ruin sloppy butcher bbq&amp;chili are really popular, other stuff like nurses calling and Hex: No One Escapes Death are also really popular even though I don't personally use them on anyone.
---
Yep. If I feel like they're gonna say some shit I just leave. No point in interacting with them anyways. 0 good can come of it but a lot of bad can. 
---
And he simply tripped on his internet cable a few times
---
Trapper was a mass murderer, but he did it all for his father, which is some explanation at least. 
---
Pig was a drug addict, emotionally unstable, and manipulated by Jigsaw. I believe that she could turn out alright, albeit with some intense therapy.

Less than 5min, i was looping and stunning piggy on haddonfield. 
---
This was Swf so the gens were done quickly and i got camped when she finally downed me so i just killed myself after everyone else left \^\_\^ 
---
ha i still remember the days you could mori without having the hook a survivor. So mori's have been nerfed.
---
I love how most of the posts on this community are complaints about perks. Perks are fine. No one gets to decide what you can or cannot use.
---
The only thing I think we can all agree on is that Freddy could use a buff and Legion a rework.
---
Yikers... I guess you've never seen a really good survivor using DS huh? Not some guy who takes it just to piss you off, the guy that takes DS cuz he knows he can personally ruin your entire game with it
---
This exactly. I've noticed that it's more common for all 5 totems to get done in a swf since they can coordinate. 
---
in solo-que, it seems like nobody counts on their team to do totems so they don't even bother and just hope for the best. 
---
So you dont play by the rule:  T.TV = mori :P
---
I mean, really all I‚Äôd be suggesting is ‚Äúchange aura colors to blue/white/etc,‚Äù not to change them all individually. Survivors and generators intentionally have the same aura color (as a potential hiding spot for things like BBQ,) and should not be able to be separated, but they should at least be able to do something like that.

ds is meh as it makes you the fucking target of killer ire 
---
Instead of tracking other survivors down for more kills you would rather camp and secure a single kill. As soon as that one person dies the others are free to just walk out. It's a valid strategy to ensure you get the points but Doesn't make you any less of a bitch for doing it. Go big or go home.

These are the 4 horseman of soloQ. You'll see her aura when you're hooked, self-caring through sloppy butcher in the corner of the map and then urban evading to unhook you after you hit struggle and the killer comes around since you will die after 6 seconds and he might as well stick around to ensure it.
---
Its on purpose, so you cant see the killer, just like the killer cant see you when you complete a gen.
---
Damn on PC I couldn't even tell they did anything survivor is instant

Incredible work! Love the details you put in the clothing with blood as well as the bloody hand!  The mask is also super detail. Nice work :)

What you're telling me to do is literally the equivalent of telling Killers to run enduring to counter decisive. 
---
Liar, this is a repost.
---
I feel the same way, since I started playing dbd it has bothered me so much .\_\_\_\_\_.
---
yes, thats how it is.
---
Either "waste" that time or deal with NoEd

---
Blood points Cap at 1m
---
i spend a good chunk of it on killer for addons or trying to clear perks on the blood web so i dont have to waste even more after getting plagues teachables unlocked. 
---
its close to 1.5m to unlock teachables 
---
I'm a main billy, and I'm always giving hatches lol
---
Damn, I wish I was playing in your games then. I can count on killers running NOED about 85% of the time. Especially at higher ranks.
---
Could it be a licensed killer? or are they done with licensed killers 
---
So then I guess we both agree. The difference between you and I is that I don't believe that's a healthy perk to have in the game.
---
For the killer? Nothing.
---
For survivors it's pretty bad since the heal speed changes. You waste too much time using it.
---
did the hatch icon show up? 
---
The best is survivors givw away free salt every time they see you. How nice of them
---
I‚Äôve literally never met a more sensitive group of people in my life. Even when I put on default Dwight with no items, I get dodged.
---
Yeah but they deserve it. They are good so they deserve it. Anyways you don't necessary have to pick up DS anyways
---
Alright buddy... alright. You think whatever you want
---
Yeah I understand their intent and it would work if killer mains could be reasoned with. As it stands, this will just cause even more dodging if my assumption is correct. 
---

---

---
I think time is not really an issue if just every survivor on your team took the time to cleanse a totem when they see one. It shouldn‚Äôt be just one guy getting all totems.
---
If I cleanse 3 totems in a game and get killed by noed in the end I know it‚Äôs not my fault because I did my part.
---
Maybe they should introduce more perks that activates like noed or have dull totems have a secondary effect so that people want to cleanse them. 
---
I ruined the 420 upvotes... I have shamed this post... I accept my fate of getting downvoted... 
---
It's really hard to tell if he says "it" or "he"
---
Pretty sure they‚Äôre done.
---
As a killer main, every totem I see when playing survivor is quick free bloodpoints so I rarely get NOED‚Äôd
---
Exactly, also, with perks like dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed time or decisive, you have no choice but to camp, they can easily escape, that's why they want you to chase them...
---
Ive been saying long time now, im betting money on it. Chucky! This summer a new movie arrives, they will come with a big name.
---
Unless you have a NOED, which is usually cleansed if they dont get out, you shouldn't..
---
They said if someone comes to them and wants to do it they will big they won‚Äôt go looking for licensed killers. Besides there custom ones are much cooler concepts imo
---
Not having dedicated servers is definitely part of the problem but I hitboxes are still terrible in green ping lobbies. 
---
looks like Behvr better buff their NDA 
---
For the billionth time, NOED is the counter to adrenaline, not decisive. Run enduring to counter decisive.
---
Borrowed Time does not. We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever does. 
---
Thanks. Yeah it's my special blood mix haha
---
Thank you 
---
I know! Hotline Miami did a Kickstarter for theirs. Behaviour should do the same 
---
She is absolutely horrifying. So disgusting well made too. Makes me want to puke though.
---
Usually have no issues getting a killer game, can take ages as survivor though. Especially with all the dodging.
---
he's\*
---
I see your point, but I also think that your teammates not clearing totems is not the killers fault, but the fault of your teammates. There IS a counter for NOED, but no one ever uses it. They rather complain on the internet about the perk. I usually play solo so I have Small Game equiped so that I can easily totem hunt. But it makes no sense to me that survivors are complaining about killers using NOED, because other survivors refuse to clear totems. That is simply not the killers fault. I do however think that the game should show you the count of how many totems are left, just like how you see how many gens are left. That would make it more fair to solo players. 
---
üëçüëçüëç
---
I've found legion to be crazy good at gen blocking. Pick three close gens run overcharge and discordance. And as long as you time chases to be short they can never complete them
---
I knew someone who would dodge if they saw anything DbD related on someone's psn profile. Like if they took a picture of feng and made it their profile background he'd dodge that lobby because that was a sign that they play DbD a lot.
---
I needed some good new to start my day off. Thanks
---
You literally just said that killers playing well means 5 gens shouldn't be done, now you're saying they can?
---
Is that card board and electrical tape? xD
---
There were a days when BNP instantly fixed a gen without consuming a toolbox and without a skillcheck and it was nerfed twice so what prevents devs from nerfing Mori twice if it's still OP? 
---
BHVR makes the worst possible. It's a bit of their magic touch.
---
Pretty much it's the killers last play. I wish survivors couldn't crawl out the gates it would make them a little less fearless. I play survivor too so I know how it is lol everyone just waits by the door until you force them out. They go for that save because why not? If you are close even if you get hit once you still get out and by the time they catch up and down you, you fall right out the door
---
How much longer does it take to heal with self care?
---
Same. I get dodged all the time as survivor, I literally never dodge a lobby while I‚Äôm playing as killer. Such a cowardly mentality to have. 
---
&gt;As a survivor, especially if you're playing solo, you cannot cleanse all totems at high ranks.
---
[Who said that?](https://media.giphy.com/media/sanoHrtWDN5ew/giphy.gif)
---
I‚Äôm a rank 1 solo survivor and this is just laughable man. It‚Äôs not difficult to do totems throughout the game when you spot them as you‚Äôre running to generators or avoiding the killer.
---
&gt;The combined time to cleanse all the totems is much longer than an entire gen, considering the time traveling between them
---
This is just not an argument. If you‚Äôre dedicating time only on totems, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. You should be spotting the totems throughout the game as you run around the map. 
---
It takes 14s to cleanse a totem, that‚Äôs 70s for all 5. 
---
It takes 80s to repair a generator.
---
Don‚Äôt know what to tell you other than, if you‚Äôre only running around looking only for totems, you‚Äôre not a good survivor.
---
&gt;And frankly, you just don't have that time to spare unless the killer is extremely inept.
---
You do have that time to spare if you were decent at wasting the killer‚Äôs time in chases. Killers who run NOED are typically bad. If you can‚Äôt outrun a bad killer, maybe you deserve to die to NOED lol.
---
It is very possible your definition of "playing well" and the developer's definition of "playing well" are different. While the game mechanics themselves don't reward it, the pip system definitely seems to reward balanced, "thematic" gameplay. Maybe this is the developer's ham-handed way to get survivors to do a little of everything. (They could just make Bloodlust a little more deadly, perhaps by tacking Exposed to the third level of it.)  
---
I suffer from it, too, on occasion. I use detection and mobility perks to not get caught in the first place. It hurts my Evader emblem because stealth is never worth as much as a chase.
---
I agree. But they‚Äôll get tired of it before long I‚Äôm sure. 
---
I like to bragging about me outskilling people :D so no Mori
---
P.S.: outskilling with Legion /s
---
Get good scrub.
---
Oh no you can't dodge. Oh nooooo
---
im pretty sure i was in the testing because the killer kept leaving as soon as everyone joined, couldnt get a game for like 10 minutes 
---
I heard "is" or "it's" not "he"
---
Im pretty sure BNP always consumed the toolbox prior to the form we have now which only completes it to 25% vs 100%
---
I got a watercolor Hylian Crest. It's on my shoulder tho, and sometimes I forget I have it.
---
I never said I was talking about you personally? I am talking about the hundred of comments and posts every day of survivors complaining about how unfair NOED is, while turning a blind eye to DS. Like I said, it's just hypocritical. 
---
It‚Äôs live right now.
---
No that's false. It's not you do you. If the gates are open and you have someone on the hook where do you think you are gonna look for survivors? They are either at the exit games or unhooking the survivor. Why the actual hell would you ever think that you are randomly gonna find a survivor if you go looking for someone when gates are open.
---
If you once actually caught somebody, GJ you found somebody who was playing their first game ever. 
---
Not trying to sound hostile, it's just common sense, why would they be anywhere else than gates or unhooking survivor.
---
&gt;Nine times out of ten survival friend group is just a bunch of people having fun on our about as coordinated as a bunch of headless chickens. For the most part they only give out small little bits of information but other than that the coordination is kind of shitty.
---
Well yes, but then we can't really have an argument for anything then if we assume the people we're talking about are potatoes. In that case Noed is great against either of them, as they probably aren't going to do totems anyway.
---
&gt;camping seems to work on the most considering they all throw caution and coordination to the wind and foolishly come at the killer like suicide lemmings.
---
It's less about being foolish as much as it is about being bored. When the killer camps nobody is playing the game. The guy on the hook is bored, the guy camping is bored, the survivors only holding m1 are bored. Most of the time it will be more fun to try to go for the save than to boringly finish all the gens with 0 action and quietly leave via the exit gates. For most people there is no fun in winning if you haven't earned it in any way. Camping removes the fun component of the match, that's usually why it works.
---
Maybe you should instruct your teammates to cleanse totems? It's not the fault of the perk if survivors have bad teamwork.
---
It is like if you stand at pallets while Myers stalks you. Should you be upset that Myers had unlimited tier 3 or a tombstone piece? Or should you be upset that your teammate played improperly and now the team suffers for it?
---
If your teammates do not cleanse totems that's on them. You have the ability to cleanse totems and if you suspect NOED you should cleanse more than 1. Blaming the perk saying it should be nerfed only shows to me that you and your team is too lazy to apply counterplay.
---
It‚Äôs more of a mindgame thing, some people laugh it off and play through and others get mad at the thought of it and start to tilt, it‚Äôs how I‚Äôm even remotely ok at smash and shooters.
---
Doctor with Overwhelming 
---
LMAO at outskilling with Legion :D   made my day, happy friday!!
---
How does borrowed time not incentivise unsafe unhooks? It literally allows you to unhook someone and get to keep that recently unhooked person unhooked long enough for you to get the safe unhook points and points towards you emblem.
---
Was trying to think myself. I feel like no matter what they'd have to be super broken considering how strong his addons are now. Surely you would see something like Spirit has in Yakuyoke Amulet, which just makes every aspect of her power better (so like, a BETTER Carb Tuning Guide somehow). As far as really unique addons? Maybe one where the Chainsaw doesn't make a sound until you're in a chase/inside a certain radius? That way it's not completely silent Billy but it's damn close. See how OP that is? 
---
&gt;Well if you play well survivors should not get all generators done.
---
That's not how the game is designed at all. The game is designed, with the exception of Nurse and Hillbilly, to allow the survivors to escape. NOED helps with that, but often by only granting one extra kill if altruism isn't a factor. 
---
More like twice a week
---
Is it my turn to post this next week and claim it as mine?
---
No problem, hope the rest of your day only gets better! &lt;3
---
Yeah that's true. There are many times you simply cannot afford to get DS'd, so you can just leave that person on the ground. My other biggest problem with DS is that you can't run an Obsession perk as killer without obscuring who might/might not have DS. Sometimes I take Save the Best for Last, and I have to leave the guy on the ground even if he may not have DS, just because I can't tell and it's not worth losing in that manner
---
Ok. You play against constant 4 man swf and say it's not frustrating that due to the communication they always know where you are and what you are running.
---
Yeah my bad, it only was nerfed in such a fashion:
---
Instant 100% - &gt; not instant 100% - &gt; not instant 15-25%
---
Still, the point stands
---
I'm just gonna assume this is a troll account or you are new to the game
---
This is the most lgbt game community secound only to over watch. Why? I have absolutely no idea.
---
Just turn NOED into a perk designed around preventing survivors from holding the game hostage and I think there wouldn't be much reason for a killer to DC at all.
---
Points incentivize unsafe unhooks. Borrowed time just is an extra measure to protect your unhooked teammate. You appear to forget that if somebody wants to unhook for points, they‚Äôre just gonna do it. Also borrowed time is increasingly rare as of late, most teammates aren‚Äôt actually considerate enough to run it. I‚Äôm not gonna complain about teammates being nice and running it for once 
---
Right? I think the most triggering was a hag who hooked me at the hatch and said ‚Äú I‚Äôm so sorry for the DC‚Äù which happened at the start... I knew it was sincere, they were nice but all I could think was ‚Äú not sorry enough to give me hatch...‚Äù ahahaha MEANWHILE  I drop the last surv on the hatch only to pick him up .5 seconds before the door flings open. So that game was a weird one idk why that escape mattered more to me then but maaaan did I want it.
---
Cleanse you totem boi
---
Yes? I can have a different opinion? It's not like I was the one to say the first thing, so I'm not contradicting myself.
---
The killer can be playing well, the survivors can just as well play better than them and win. These two are not mutually exclusive.
---
Wraith, coxcombed clapper, the ghost, ebony mori 
---
Usually franklins too, cause screw your styptic 
---
It's only a win-switch if survivors are complete potatoes and throw themselves at their hooked buddy without cleansing NOED or... ya know... just leaving.
---
PSA, people: if NOED is up and you don't know where its totem is, *LEAVE.* You have NO RIGHT to complain about NOED when you know it's active but stick around for altruism points anyway.
---
Hello people of the fog. I made a little video called "Fast and Furious - Hillbilly Drift" and i would like to share it with you. It would be nice if you could give me some feedback/constructive criticism. Please let me knowwhat you think. Have fun playing and see you in the fog.
---
U 2! :) 
---
Yeah. Some nice survivors lets you hit them all 1 time before running out which is nice. But actually standing at the gates with full hp and waiting 1 cm away from the door, refusing to go out the door before you run at them is just straight up BM and annoying. I usually just go ALT-TAB at that point.
---
I used to be downvoted for saying that. How times have changed!
---
I didn't say I would run around aimlessly looking for someone. If I had just hooked someone,  I would have some idea of where survivors would be so I would start  between me and the hooked survivor while checking the gates.   I run whipsers most of the time so its not a crapshoot. I don't enjoy camping the hooked guy, so I don't. 
---
Devs said NOED is fine. That's your excuse :^)
---
I'm really excited for the decisive rework, I bought it a while ago but realized I couldn't hit the skill checks (PS4) now after the rework goes into effect I'm going to start using it.
---
i hate this only because i will get dodged every time
---
So is DS just in general. Get looped for 2 mins, go down, DS, back to another 2 minute chase now you can finally put them on their first hook. Guess what 
---
? 3 gens are done and you have yet to find your second survivor. While 2 are working on a Gen and the third is going to unhook. Coming from a survivor main BTW
---
I've never been this scared before in my life, thought it could be cool to show you guys hehe. It's on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwIqH49l8Vg&amp;feature=youtu.be) aswell for the ones intrested :)
---
Christ I was just talking about Big Time Rush the other day with some friends.
---
Talk all the shit you will camping like that is effective (somehow) and it‚Äôs honestly fun to just knock someone down, drag em to the basement,  then wait in the corner.
---
Personally I whip out legion if I wanna annoy and piss people off.
---
If I wanna sweat and 4 man Hillbilly is my boi.
---
Chill. Playing against 4 stack SWF teams isn't that bad. If it scares you that much then you aren't a very good killer.
---
Is everybody just going to ignore the fact that OP is an insidious facecamper? 
---
My wait times felt longer but my lobbys were all full when joining like it said they should be. My biggest complaint was that my pings have been MUCH worse. I used to be able to find double digit green pings more frequently. I assume this is because of the batch match making. 
---
Solo survivor, PC. 
---
Nope, in fact I love it and use it in all my builds. But people just don't value finding totems highly compared to a free endgame heal or a get out of jail free card... and then they complain when Ruin or NOED screws them.
---
So make Noed into a perk for something that is bannable? No
---
I demand pics of this is all void.
---
lol right? i thought for sure xbox live must‚Äôve been having some issues with how long it was taking me to find lobbies and how frequently i was seeing killers dodging and dc-ing. nope, it‚Äôs just bhvr being bhvr. 
---
Tsk tsk, only if there in a party/ full group of same characters 
---
Taste
---
Legion is so funny, everytime you play them you get called and I quote 
---
‚ÄúFucking tunneling loser‚Äù 
---
I dunno why, but i get called it a lot and I laught, a lot 
---
DS is garbage now, spirit.
---
That sounds deep.
---
All it is is either a physical or software switch that prevents the sending of packets. Since you are the server this means everything you do while packets aren‚Äôt sent is valid. You can move around and none of the survivors can‚Äôt see you 
---
Please explain how it's worse? I don't get your logic.
---
You thought it was bad ping but it was me, *Dio!*
---
another bhvr scam so people couldnt dodge swf groups
---
Franklin's, Enduring, Ruin, and Spirit Fury, all on Trapper. Screw your pallets, your flashlights, and your progress. 
---
Wtf lol, it‚Äôs a 1v1 game mode??? Not the last survivor. This would be a separate game mode. Learn to read before you get huffy in the comments 
---
As Killer, this makes me smile. 
---
Like to yell, "TURN DOWN FOR WHAT?!" or "Leeeeeeroooy jeeenkins" on my way down from time to time.
---
That happened to me as well on the swamp. I checked everywhere! Eventually I gave up and just walked up to the killer.
---
Didn't know it was actually bannable. I need to start reporting people who do it from now on then...
---
This would be fine if SWF wasn't a hard counter to multiple perks. If you wanna run something like devour hope or third seal or knockout etc, why shouldn't you dodge lobbies and try to get a group that isn't immune to your build?
---
Console P3 nurse main here. The build I run is BBQ, Ruin, Shadowborn, Predator. I personally find that tracking can be hard with the frames on console. So as long as you can hit your blinks, you just need to know what direction they went when you do miss. I personally am trying to get make your choice and i will probably put that over ruin or something but that's my opinion. Also it's fine to run nurses on her, but i personally don't. Survivors usually assume you are running nurses and will run across the map to heal. Sometimes they're dumb and you will catch people healing but i think it's better not to bring it
---
It is aimless running unless you are running to the gate because thats where they are. Theres no reason for them to be anywhere else. And if you do that. Welp you just wasted ur time because they are gonna run out.
---
Can't speak for console "killer mains", but I personally don't dodge anything. Even if I get wrecked I'm getting blood points. Dodging is just a waste of time and you may dodge one lobby to get a four stack of breakdown users. Which is more annoying to me than anything else because I refuse to run hangman's trick.
---
‚ÄúCAMPING TUNNELING N‚Äî‚Äî‚Äú Sorry I‚Äôm on the same map as the hooked survivor.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm sitting at close to 900k. Planning on funneling them all into Jane since I mainly play survivor. 
---
Sure, but she didn't cheat to be toxic like he did is what I was trying to point out. Still, don't mind seeing bad sports hanging on the hook like this Nea obviously was.
---
But I have a sister...
---
All you're missing is at some point you need to edit in a pause and a NANI
---
Put your trophies on friend only. 
---
Killers will now see the lobbies filled up with 4 survivors instantly (regardless they are playing in SWF or solo). 
---
bhvr idiots whatever u do will still gonna dodge or disconnect on swf groups
---
Guess I‚Äôll start using all my ebony moris every game then.
---
#SURPRISE!
---
I now know it's not, but I thought it looked like a boner at first glance.
---
Don't patronise me, sweetheart, with all that bullshit about sensitivity.
---
Your experiences do not invalidate mine and don't make out that im defending toxic killer behaviour either.  Its a weak person that purposely misrepresents someone else to hell.
---
Same haha
---
Everyone have  stupid relatives
---
Ah thanks for clarification. I don‚Äôt have BBQ and Chilli and tracking perks are generally great (Especially on huntress) so rancor is appealing 
---
You're a fucking weirdo
---
Yeah it's pretty essential for me. Either i miss and they disappear or i hit and they fly away and i fatigue and I can't find em. If you haven't already seen it, watch ardetha's nurse guide. He plays on PC but I learned nurse from that video it's really helpful
---
Do some people really check trophies?
---
I wonder how much gayer the DBD community has to get, before they finally give us our drag queen killer.
---
I dunno about y'all, but I am ready to *slaaayyyy*.
---
Nothings changed then, it's always assumed a defeat is due to swf
---
You know it bb üëâüòéüëâ
---
&gt;ample of people providing you with a method of counterplay that is very clear and not reliant on exploits but you not listening?
---
Have you read anything I've typed? I cleanse totems. I don't usually play SWF and have no way of communicating. I'm not blaming perks, I'm blaming people crying because others aren't playing the way they want/suggest, which is exactly what YOU are doing right now. 
---
Unless you actually start reading what I've said and want to participate in a discussion instead of addressing things that no one has said, I think we are probably done here.
---
Ah. My idea for NOED would be making it an aura reading perk that reveals survivors once an exit gate is open or the hatch is available. No exposed status or hex. Just a way of making people leave when they can instead of drawing the game out longer.
---
Obviously this isn't anywhere near to a perfect idea, there's a lot of problems with it but it's just what I thought of 
---
David with his black shirt and beard + urban evasion = literally a shadow straight up
---
I only play this and Overwatch. I already knew I was queer, but I didn't know I was a stereotype.
---
Is this live right now? I‚Äôd expect many killers to dodge because they don‚Äôt know about this change
---
Lmao try to play against a squad as a non-meta killer
---
P3 Claudettes be like
---
Urban Evasion or Iron Will.  Strong perks for hiding.
---
And it's still more nuanced then that. You can't just make games take twice as long and say "that's that" or everyone is gonna be getting 4ks in every game.
---
Not saying you implied that, just using it as an example.
---
I was kidding. Just seems like people post "traced" in every fan art post.
---
**Dead by Daylight** - Now Playable

Yikes. This was already the case for me on PS4 and I was hoping survivor queues would get better. Guess I‚Äôll keep practicing as killer. üò©
---
Clown
---
Jfc why is this so funny
---
Yo, is your name a creepypasta/Channel Zero reference?
---
"There's a counter to gens being done too quickly, just kill survivors before they rush them".
---
Just because one role is "at fault" when either of these things happens doesn't mean it's bad game design.
---
Horrifying
---
I do. Huntress and Myers. Don't use Ruin, or NOED. I'm not very good as Huntress but that's cause PS4. Still get 2 kills pretty frequently as her and 3 kills almost always as Myers. 4 if I'm really trying. 
---
Honestly? None of them. Once you learn their tactics, they aren't that hard to figure out--It's more of a matter of what kind of a player-killer you're going against. If they're higher-leveled, then I find that I spend less time doing gens and more time losing my tracks so they don't find me while I'm heading to one.
---
Possibly
---
It sounds like you're playing a different game than everyone else. The game the rest of us are playing is one where the survivors repair generators and escape.
---
Cue the new ds change
---
Dw they'll just dodge legacy/p3/bright clothes.
---
God forbid we have a challenge in this game.

Killers that dodge because they think the lobby is swf ate the worst. Honestly, it is the most privileged thing ever. Your rank means nothing yet you try to protect it with your life. Dodging your own lobby for any reason really fugs with the survivor players because even solo we are sometimes waiting an absurd amount of time for a match and then we start all over because you want to play an easy game. 
---
He's a killer who's kind of hard to master and do well with, though. And takes strategy and positioning over muscle memory twitches like nurse and billy.
---
A lot of people are angry that this poses a challenge for them, and want freddy reworked so their games can be easier.
---
Oh no, -rep AND called an asshole? My life is ruined
---
Must be a nooby dwight a true Dwight main knows NEVER to leave the locker if he waits long enough the crows get bored and leave
---
People that actually want to enjoy the game with a friend? What incel would tunnel someone for not wanting to share their private details online? Must have quite the poor home life.
---
Why don‚Äôt we all get our own theme songs?? Lmao
---
like 99% of reports, absolutely nothing man
---
Thanks! I‚Äôve been messing around on how I‚Äôm gonna get the mechanism to work 
---
 People who use Descordance be like: Dumasses 
---
I lobby dodge the second I make a lobby, don‚Äôt wanna risk any SWF joining.
---
Oh wow that's pretty good actually, DS sounds good to me now.
---
How many charges does it have
---
Ooh you're on console. Nothing to brag about then lol. 
---
The obvious answer here is Legion 
---
Can I lick the pus on her leg
---
A better solution is to turn Moris into something other than an instant-win offering.
---
If they only worked after the second hook, they'd still save time and make the game more interesting. 
---
Lol Kate‚Äôs are safe don‚Äôt worry
---
I dont but I've been meaning to get an Instagram going again. 
---
Yes. People always have there is a lot of information in them.
---
For example you could check my trophies and see my first 4k on PS4 was 6/21/2017
---
If you are a new player, bad or insecure like these people you would probably see that and want to dodge me because it says i've been around since almost the beginning. (On console)
---
Cue the Leatherface insta chainsaw
---
Because it's an absolute joy to face some 4-man SWF.
---
Just a little worried, unsure how the report system works on the dev side 
---
\*Proceeds to launch Legion\*
---
Ok, I never really played him to much and didnt Learn the strats for him.
---
You saying everyone is in agreement with you is false. Theres literally comments in this thread saying freddy doesn't need a rework.
---
You're overestimating your own opinions.
---
Ok, thanks 
---
I just like my rainbow jacket and bright red hair üò≠ 
---
This is usually the only kind of thing I'd dodge for. If I've played you in the last hour and you were a toxic piece of shit there's no way I'm holding myself to that again. That, abed the occasional group that all slowly switch to P3 Claudette because at that point you're just advertising that you're up to something
---
It's not about challenging vs not challenging. it's about SWF being a hard counter to so many things that it shouldn't be.
---
Why bother putting a Trapper trap by a hooked survivor?
---
Why bother running perks like knockout?
---
etc
---
Learn to read. "I think" does not mean I was stating facts. Didnt say everyone was in agreement.
---
You're making a problem where there isn't one just to argue and its pathetic.
---
I just play them my usual way and try to humble them by beating them anyway without resorting to the babytactics like camping.
---
*"If I don't see 4 Dwights, I'll just dodge the lobby."*
---
I really wish you could change the colors of certain things, namely scratch marks, for me Blue shifted maps are the worst
---
You can‚Äôt be reported for camping you‚Äôre fine
---
That might just be the map, finding the hatch on the swamp is a huge pain in the ass.
---
That's what happens when you get gen rushed.
---
Not every game gets genrushed. Even efficient swf can be slowed down if the killer is good and puts on pressure. By allowing survivors to gen rush, you're rejecting the viable counterplay that is to apply pressure and slow them down.
---
"Kill the damn survivors".
---
So instead of balancing the Fact that playing vs SWF is rigged (they share Information over Third Party Software which normal Random Groups cant do making Hex Perks or Information Denial Perks (Knockout Third Seal) useless) they just hide the Lobby so Killers can\`t avoid games they cant win but still get punished like it was a normal Game vs Randoms... sure
---
I‚Äôm a killer main you lmao. Nice try though. 
---
Agreed. Even Legion is actually really weak. The fact that you can actually stop yourself from being downed using a relatively quick action that doesn't even involve skill checks means that they're more than manageable. 
---
Whether or not a killer is actually annoying depends on the player, not the killer. 
---
Then you have people who find you annoying because you aren't going to let them win. 
---
Survivors outside of your terror radius would be better
---
No, I just see a post like this at least once a week. It gets old fast. Especially when this isn‚Äôt even that bad; sometimes the posts show a rank 10 killer can‚Äôt all rank ones or something, but if you average out this game it‚Äôs literally like a rank 13.5 squad vs a rank 16 killer. Not completely fair but really not that bad.
---
Most KYF lobbies haven‚Äôt been that fun for me. I‚Äôm pretty chill and the only reason I‚Äôd do a KYF lobby is to practice flashlighting, looping, and builds.
---
However it seems that most KYF lobbies are just excuses to show off how good you are (killer mains). So it‚Äôs boring...
---
And if you‚Äôre better than the killer than you‚Äôre gonna have to argue and defend yourself. 
---
I don't hate him, but he always makes me paranoid.
---
Like, so much so that I'll spend the next 8 games reflexively checking loops, windows, and tall grass for bear traps, even though I can tell the Killer is Legion, Amanda, Hillbilly, or etc.
---
But that‚Äôs getting changed now, and let‚Äôs be honest, the likelihood of 4 survivors landing current DS in a match is much less likely than a killer getting 4 kills via ebony mori. 
---
Actually, moris are a direct counter to the new DS. 
---
Inside would be too broken 
---
The only pussy move is a killer becoming scared of their prey and fleeing from their lobby.  You don't have the right to play killer if you're going to turn them into pussies like that.  
---
I don't hate any particular Killer, just the ones that tunnel or camp.
---
They make me wonder why I play Survivor.
---
Rest assured, he hates you too 
---
What do you mean who cares? Who doesnt care about having fun in a game?
---
She's going for that BT save.
---
&gt;the survivors at rank 1 are all immersed claudettes these days though, it's gross. 
---
I'd say that's moreso in the later half of the month.  Since ranking up is so easy, even potatoes (i.e. urban evasion coma patients) can make rank 1, but it does take them longer.
---
&gt;they need to make it harder to get to rank 1 because the emblem system had kind of spoiled it. rank 1 is the new rank 10.
---
after emblems were initially out and it was really hard to pip, there like 20 survivors total at rank 1 and searching for a lobby took ages and ages.  If they make rank 1 mean something, it's going to be the same few people playing together nonstop and having to wait ages for games.
---
This is a casual game, if rank means nothing as it does now, that's why that's the case.
---
Please, you know he's using a blowtorch on those Marshmallows. 
---
Yeah so instead of fixing the cause why Killers hate Playing vs full SWF Groups (cuz they are toxic af) they hide em so Killers can\`t avoid it...
---
It would work like the outline when using Legions power. It‚Äôd highlight people in your line of sight.
---
Okay, then you thought wrong. 
---
&gt;didn't say everyone is in agreement
---
You said you think everyone is in agreement, which is the same thing.
---
You're getting defensive and trying to deflect because you got called out. That's way more pathetic.
---
Escape is not an escape.
---
They don‚Äôt even ban people who outright cheat. 
---
You‚Äôll be fine. 
---
You say that like they actually look at reports.
---
If you're ignoring totems then you simply cant complain about it. 
---
And right before the instadown, the screen pauses and you hear "To be continued"
---
You can dead hard over his traps :) 
---
If they slug you for a full minute and don't go do anything else, then they're punishing themselves more than the DS would have.
---
Idk about you but the trapper looks like one hell of a daddy to me
---
L m a o
---
Do you go to stores and ask people to debate you because that's the vibe I'm getting bb.
---
It's toxic to me because it's an absolute waste of time when you could have been doing a gen or something productive. Every selfcare I've seen has been someone getting off a hook, running to a corner of the map, self caring, then runs back to a gen. That means from the moment you got off the hook to the moment I downed someone else you have achieved nothing and what should have been a gen is now like +20 seconds on a chase. Just don't run it even if you have to do chases injured, literally a waste of time and will lose you games. Only niche is where you're three genned or end game.
---
I want to get Corrupt Intervention teachable as fast as I possibly can. That perk should hopefully mean that I don't have to run Ruin to buy time for my setup phase. 
---
It's interesting that you're replying to so many comments but have no thoughts on the one I left about how SWF hard counters killer perks
---
also wow you have an axe to grind, yeesh
---
I agree: hide all offerings, hide clothes, hide items. It should just let you know you‚Äôre in a lobby and it‚Äôs ready to go.
---
I'm in love!! That is so incredible. Please tell me you'll do more and share with us. I would love to see The Plague or Spirit! 
---
Well done!
---
Theres no debate lol. You were wrong and got called out, that's that.
---
You deflecting and denying and trying to invalidate is just a cherry on top.
---
Keep it coming, it's entertaining. Your next post will be more or the same.
---
unpopular opinion i hate playing against leatherface because ps4 survivors are over altruistic as fuck
---
I‚Äôm on console and my pings have also been MUCH worse over the past couple of days. So bad that it got to the point that I just shut it down early. 
---
I rarely use them. But when I do, I *want* to use them, yeah? 
---
Theyd have to try spinning, I'm told it's a neat trick.
---
I'm a killer main and play KYF to be better as survivor, it kinda helps. But when you're better than the boosted "god pro player rank 1 huntress with Insta down hatchets + mangled effect add-on" who just happens to be the party leader you have 3 options:
---
1: Don't say anything and get kicked;
---
2: Defend yourself and get kicked anyway;
---
3: Defend yourself, not get kicked but the party leader tilts and will always bring a mori, camp and tunnel you in a KYF match, and when that fails too, get kicked
---
Or switch to your best killer and equip an Ivory Mori just for them. 
---
I didn‚Äôt fail to understand what you said. Borrowed time is also a powerful perk that can change the outcome of a match drastically and it, like nearly any other perk, is only as helpful to your team as the person wielding it. Hell, even Bond can be used to sandbag your team by bringing the killer to teammates during a chase 
---
okay, but they're a severe game balance issue. even if adjusted so you have to be two hooked first
---
Haha yep!
---
Playing devil's advocate here, you won't get better as a killer unless you learn to play against higher skilled players. I understand dodging high ping players though. 
---
Ah so the more blood on the character the more prestiges. Ok thank you
---
Its her hunting axe... Lol
---
You are awesome!
---
Well if there's 1 guy with a public profile you can always check their friends :/ people can dodge 4 man private profiles. 
---
I doubt this was intended as a lobby dodge prevention feature though. This is just what was going to happen anyway with how they explained the bucket system. This is just a heads up so that people who usually dodge 4 man SWFs won't be dodging every single lobby when the patch comes out.
---
I HAVE IT!!!
---
I just played killer and the survivors didn‚Äôt come all at once, 1 came, about 7 seconds later 2 came, and about 20 seconds later the last one came
---
As dickish as it sounds, I like to teabag the person getting Moried. It's just like... "I know I'm next, but I'll give the killer a laugh while I'm at it."
---
okay, I thought I was crazy or something was fucked on my end. "glad" to see it wasn't
---
SHIRTLESS DAVID
---
I've done some more in 1/6 scale and some other female killers. Have posted them here or you can see my Instagram @candlecovepirate #blackcabincustoms
---
&gt; you want to play an easy game. 
---
this applies to SWF as well lmao
---
This build is garbage. Figures only a console player wiuld think this is what meta legion is.
---
I'LL BUY IT!!
---
SWF doesn‚Äôt hard counter any killer perks anymore since dead survivors can no longer relay the loadout. You mentioned third seal and devour hope, what do either have to do with being vulnerable to SWF? They‚Äôre both hex perks and neither will last long no matter who‚Äôs in the game. It makes Knockout less useful, sure, I‚Äôll give you that.
---
I know trust me that really pisses me off when I haven‚Äôt been hooked once the whole match and as the last surv, immediately die on first hook even with deliverance. I run dead hard with deliverance just for the first hit the killer makes if I unhook myself. But yea it sucks how you don‚Äôt even get a chance if your the last one alive and on a hook for the first time.
---
THATS A GOOD POINT WE FOUND HIS TOTEM ONCE CAUSE I STARTED RUNNING SMALL GAME BUT WE LITERALLY GET ALMOST NO CHANCES SINCE EVERYONE CROWDS THE DAMN EXIT GATES. I NEED A TEAM TO COMMUNICATE TBH I ALWAYS PLAY ALONE N DIE. 
---
WHY ARE SURVIVORS SO QUICK TO ACCUSE YOU OF CAMPING AND TUNNELLING? BITCH, I WAS CHASING OTHER SURVIVORS ACROSS THE MAP BOTH TIMES YOU WERE HOOKED. AND I ONLY CAUGHT YOU THE SECOND TIME BECAUSE YOU CORNERED YOURSELF IN THE CHASE. 
---
Yea I get why they implement it but swf just gives you a huge advantage. I had a game against a 4 top swf, where one survivor with TTV in there name, I went back and watched the vod of the match. Whenever I hooked the first survivor that saw Ruin he just called out that it was next to where he was hit. Then I just watched as his buddy hopped off a gen and trotted over to it to pop it then went back on the gen.
---
Or when I was trying to mind game his buddy on the killer shack and he just called which side I was taking because he could see me from the hook.
---
Neat.
---
This is disgusting 
---
That‚Äôs unsettling üòï
---
Trying to get my killers back to rank 1 but I literally have had 3 games with 1-3 survivors DC'ing. In a row.
---
I don't see anything
---
What is this?
---
*inhales*
---
!A CROOSOVER EPISODE?!
---
I think legion is fine anyone else agree with me no just me okay.
---
If they're hiding then they're not doing anything. Utilize better tracking perks, there are plenty of strong options now. 
---
I don't think it was that bad, they probably had to seach up stuff like leprosy victims, sores and acid burns.
---
The people who designed Dead Space Necromorphs looked at car crashes to design their enemies! That's something I could never have the stomach for.
---
Oh, sorry, I misinterpreted because I don't associate cosmetics with difficulty so when I read the thing about a challenge that's just where my mind jumped right away
---
&gt; More experienced players will expect traps around hooks anyway, you can run bond, etc. Those things can be countered even without a swf.
---
SWF is A LOT stronger than the perks offered in the game. By an order of magnitude.
---
You can expect a trap, but you wouldn't necessarily know where it is 
---
and bond wouldn't be a counter to either the knockout nor freddy thing. at least not in the same insane way that SWF is
---
If you know the killer has a mori then you can play more safe/use more resources to stay alive longer. 
---
Moris are already stupidly overpowered, they don't need a buff.
---
Stop crying and run NOED
---
Until the mid chapter patch in 6 weeks when they open it for testing again for whatever balance changes they bring out. The new killer and survivor will most likely hit  the live games this coming Tuesday. 
---
If you can see a survivor healing themselves an you don't go heal them, its you wasting time, not them. It's usually faster to self care than to hunt another survivor down if you don't know where they are already.
---
I love legion‚Äôs design too. The silver lining is McLean said on his stream that after the next chapter goes live they‚Äôll work on legion and talk about their rework. His reasoning was he wanted people to be excited for the new chapter. 
---
Lmao
---
Why should I believe what a random streamer says?
---
If he says to jump off a bridge should we do it?
---
No one "should" do anything as long as it doesn't breaks the rules lol. What's wrong with you people with all those rules and shit? I mean you can follow them and respect 4% run only bad perks etc but that's your problem.
---
She just needs majorly working on for console. She needs aim assist to ever be viable on console like she is on PC, when the frame rate drops Everytime you hit from a teleport it makes her near impossible to play.
---
She‚Äôs like the one killer on console you KNOW you‚Äôll never lose against
---
I've seen a lot of people dodge Legacy/p3 so I'm basing it off my experiences.
---
I havent been using bond in a while, does the sleep prevent aura 
---
reading now or something?
---
Pls no 
---
Hey, it‚Äôs not like we are joining your game because we want to. Blame the devs not us
---
I don't usually play killer, but when I do I sometimes end up camping, mostly because I find being a killer super stressful and I have somehow convinced myself that I have to be absolutely amazing at being a killer. And also for some reason, my right hand (which I use to use the mouse because I'm left handed) starts shaking really badly for no discernable reason, most especially when I'm chasing survivors and using powers.
---
they just need a thing in the lobby that shows who is grouped together, easy counter.
---
They communicate with each other and they felt It was ok, but if you watch his live, they'll get mad, saying It's unfair lol
---
&gt; hey dodge because 4 P3 claudette with flashlights is not fun.
---
rarely happens
---
i just run enduring spirit fury bbq and ruin, then i just play stupid aggressive.
---
Is BNP really part of a genrush build still? I feel you get way more mileage just using a yellow or commodius toolbox with add-ons like sockets or instructions.
---
&gt; I havent been using bond in a while, does the sleep prevent aura reading now or something?
---
I mean in terms of range. In SWF no matter what you know exactly where to get woken up. Running Bond you'll probably have to still find them in the range first and then get their attention. It's a big difference 
---
I see this is going nowhere as you clearly chose to ignore the main point of my last comment. 
---
True,happened to me as a killer, 2 gens left and 1 guy alive, hatch never spawned, like the hatch icon to the right of my power wasn‚Äôt even there
---
No clue, the real counter is simply not tunneling 
---
Awful at the game, arrogant, and dumb. It's there's anything redeeming about you? 
---
Being Huntress on console is hard as aiming with controller fuck precision. The fact that the other guy managed to get 2 kills shows that he's pretty good. Honest to boot as he admits has not good at playing her. 
---
&gt; Him: How should they rework it so it is stronger? ...  The only way it could be stronger is if as soon as it was active all survivors teleported to hooks.
---
&gt; Me: They **shouldn't make it stronger** but they could easily give it something like Bitter Murmur's effect
---
What don't you understand? He asks how they could buff it. I tell him how they could buff it. End of story. I never say they *need* to buff it or they *should* buff it.
---
Props!
---
But that doesn't really condone the gutless cowardice of DC'ing before the match even begins. 
---
I didnt think it could be worse, but man car crashes are traumatising...
---
But then that
---
1) defeats the purpose of the new load in method
---
2) doesn't address the issue of SWF hard countering killer builds
---
Not really, slugging is often an effective strategy
---
I didn't say that they are in the clear if they dc against it, I just said that it shouldn't be hidden.
---
I mean if you get tunneled off hook and morid, I can understand why they'd dc. If they aren't having any fun in the match, why stay in the match?
---
If I was the killer and I saw that I would run away 
---
YouTube it's mid day people are at school and work right?
---
You forgot to put me in the last tier
---
/u/title2imagebot
---
The crosses axes would look sick. 
---
Do you always whine this much? 
---
Oh nah bro you'd want out.
---
Why bbq on doctor ? He's the master tracker ,why bother using bbq ? Farming I suppose?
---
Unlucky cause my nurse has 35 at p1 50 lul
---
Actually just lvl 50 p0 i never bothered prestiging her
---
I know that was a extreme example you just know from their outfits and names when it is gonna be a bad game.
---
Its also right after rank reset and that always screws up queue times
---
Don't know why you got downvoted,it's a game mechanic that's here to exist ,the devs said it themselves
---
Killer can't see you if you do a gen 
---
Surviours can't see the killer when they hook someone 
---
Amanda‚Äôs head is tilted right. Her body is tilted left though.
---
Ps4 killers? WACK
---
Killer lunged through the pallet and landed a hit the milisecond the pallet hit the ground, knocking him back through it but the hit still counts. Perfectly legit.
---
The same goes for being Killer. Sometimes I am looking at a gen a bit away and when it's completed that animation plays and if there is cover nearby it just looks like the survivors got sucked into the void or something. They are just gone.
---
Except noed almost never gets disabled unless it‚Äôs swf
---
EA ruins everything I love. They started with Dungeon Keeper and never stopped.
---
I know this my come as shock to you but not everyone plays this game 24/7 no lifing it trying to be number one killer. Some of us just want to have fun. It is not fun when 3 survivors are circling you all game. While they alternate one at a time do a gen.
---
Her without her costume, yeah. 
---
Both are crutches. The problem is one is being merged and the other isn‚Äôt. 
---
The ptb is closed.
---
Its closed.
---
You couldn't afford her 
---
the way the describe the match making system now, I think its what causes it.  As it waits for 4 people to group up before searching for a killer lobby. So if someone leaves a lobby, the lobby is screwed!  So it doesnt search or pick anything less than that.  unless I am reading it wrong? 
---
I also forgot to mention I generally run breakdown with deliverance.
---
This is me and my friends when we play dbd. We actually have a game called ‚Äúkobe or die‚Äù where we all bring luck offerings and you either have to kobe off hook or die because no one will go for saves.
---
&gt; I do play as SWF sometimes too, but I can't deny It's unfair tho.
---
Same, and this is really all I ask of SWF players but most of them have meltdowns over this obvious reality being pointed out
---
oh, when did it close?
---
I do not agree with the freddy point at all. I main freddy, and if I'm chasing someone and another survivor is in the dreamworld, and I see them waking up, I have a lead on where they are, and the person that woke them up are. Even better, I use monitor and abuse which allows me to get close to survivors before they start hearing my heartbeat, which I love because I'm getting two people to sleep for the price of 1.
---
That‚Äôs what breakdown is for. The first one anyways. The second point, who cares. No one cries about it if the last two people get hooked at the same time and they both struggle the entire time. 
---
The point of a Mori is to be an awesome bit of flair, showing off a killer's style and brutality. That's the only intended part of their design we can be sure of.
---
Legion players in a nutshell
---
F
---
Trust me, they will. If you camp the pallet and know the baits that they will try to get you to do to vault, they will be forced to break it. Clown is garbo lmao
---
It‚Äôs within line of sight, probably within a range (which I forgot to include). It‚Äôs not an aura you can see through walls or something.
---
She was my flair and now SHE'S GOOOOONE.
---
Oh well, I got the Yuhua one now, so I'm more than happy.
---
Ehh, some people. I know I burn those offerings when fucking around with killers I haven't played since they got removed.
---
Huntress is definitely taller than 6', seems like 6'7" or so .
---
Great figure though, very cool
---
Why spaghetti? That's spanish not italian.
---
It really is strange how us gays seem to flock to dbd lmao. I've seen people streaming this game in drag on Twitch. Honestly living for it.
---
Billy, when I see one I just want to dc.
---
My experience has been either all four drop in at once, or they drop in one after another.
---
have you watched jojo's bizarre adventures? the main villain's power in the third season is to stop time. everyone and everything is frozen and they can't do anything, nor do they realize that time is stopped while the guy who stops time can move around, harm them, whatever he wants, really.. that is about the equivalent of a lagswitch in dead by daylight. everything that happened in stopped time takes place at once when time starts moving again
---
Yeah!!! Fuck your teammates guys!!! 
---
Honestly idc about enduring working for ds. But working for head on is just stupid. 
---
Bill HillyBoy, owner of the Bigbill Billydome
---
Maybe the guy was hungry and forgot the Spanish language was a thing. 
---
Show them the picture that BHVR shown that explains what are invalid reports, because camping is a invalid reason.
---
Aka it‚Äôs a bitch move to secure a kill after you didn‚Äôt kill anyone all game 
---
She's talented, she's unique, I'll give her that. She had the nerve to show up to the trials with no shoes on, I'll give her that, but the letter H? I don't see it.
---
She's just the 'untress.
---
Short answer to that is absolutely fucking nothing
---
Bait the chainsaw. Get farmed. Use ds. Run the leatherface for a bit. Most leatherfaces who camp can be baited when the have the chainsaw revved. Or you can bring ds and deliverance. 
---
My mate got a big trapper down his arm. I dont know his u/, maybe he'll see this and recognise my name.
---
I repeat - if NOED is up and they're on the hook, they are **dead.** You wanna let their death be in vain, be my guest, but I'd personally rather take my 5k points and leave than get my ass slapped and whine to the killer.
---
If you don't play the game 24/7, then your rank should reflect that. That's why the game has a ranking system. Selectively playing against teams, in my opinion, will inflate your rank and you'll be playing against tougher and tougher teams you won't want to play against. If you get rolled, you get rolled, there's always next match, you can't win every game.
---
I got, is death not an escape.
---
I think their power comes from the snowball effect of killing one survivor. Even without a mori, if you have 2-3 gens left and kill one survivor, you just might have pushed the game towards your favor enough for you to get more than 1, even 2 kills. 
---
I like the cool down idea, but I thought it should work on a generator basis. Green mori remains unchanged, but ebony mori would work like this:
---
You can kill one survivor by your hands at base, for each generator activated, you gain the ability to kill another survivor by your hands. If a gate is OPENED, you gain the ability to kill all survivors by your hands even if they have not been hooked.
---
Name checks out i suppose
---
Self care helps killers. They‚Äôre wasting 20+ seconds not doing objectives. 
---
Yeah it is and gen tapping isnt an exploit
---
You are reading them wrong. It doesn't take 4 at a time. It takes let's say a 1,000 players every 30 seconds (example). Then finds the best matches between those 1,000 and throws them in a lobby together. Once those 5 are in a lobby and one survivor leaves it, will be maybe anywhere from 30sec- 60sec for the game to even start looking for 1 new survivor out of the next stack of a 1,000. These are all numbers I made up but that is how I understood the new system works. So if one person leaves it resets the que  as if you just hit the join lobby button.
---
Yes it is and it's not a meme (I can do it too!)
---
But enduring getting hit by new ds would make the stun last ~1 second, even less maybe. A face camper wouldn't even let you use it on them (if they're good at facecamping/playing a killer who has a face camp advantage) and someone who tunnels will just run enduring. 
---
as someone with just over 200 hours, I'm likely one of those survivors (or killers).  I personally feel I rank up too quickly.  In the last reset I was able to hit rank 7 as survivor.
---
Personally I wish ranking was a be more refined 
---
The ranking system should prevent a large jump in skill though, from addition to calculus as you put it. Sometimes you'll get a rough match or two because of the rank resets or experienced players coming back after a long break. 
---
well he did dc... for a few seconds
---
Because human skin is salty
---
Also a Nurse main here, do you prefer Predator over Bloodhound? Cause I use BBQ, Ruin/NC, Sloppy, and a tracking. (usually Bloodhound)
---
Perk slot locked is a pretty good perk
---
I think I notice it more with SWF groups, and yes after a reset too, where a couple are more my rank but then bring their skilled friends in who intentionally try to get me to follow them, then just loop me endlessly.  
---
The only think I've learned is to avoid that loop (so I guess I did learn something) but not how to counter the loop.  
---
I got it, no worries!
---
Glad someone else also busts nuts with Daddy King and Papa Park
---
But in every match you had the option to counter NOED by destroying totems but there is no counter for DS present in every match.
---
The game already knows what you are planning to put in that 4th slot.
---
What‚Äôs that?
---
Oh man this one is going on the popular page üòÇ
---
I lobby dodge as soon as I open the game, I don‚Äôt want to risk creating a lobby where a swf could join

‚Äú...best killer sided map imo.‚Äù That isn‚Äôt an opinion lol. That is a fact.

To be continued

The matchmaking doesn't take into account SFW. There are many people on here that will tell you how often rank 12 killers get put against rank 1 survivors because of SFW.

---
I know your (re) not a normie because you make memes..
---
Your ability to catch survivors depends *mostly* on the skill of the survivor, not your own skill. That's like someone suggesting to "outplay" a legion. All the survivor can do is hope that legion fucks up, outside of that, there's almost nothing you can do.

Agreed. The game was so much smoother before all of the engine "upgrades" and animation changes.

Then don't keep doing the gens with others if after the first time cause then it's just your fault after thar.

My game freezes for a split second whenever a perk activates, it‚Äôs weird. Whether it‚Äôs my adrenaline or the killers NOED when he hits someone with it.

Eh the mental disorder is why, he'll always have the mind of a child  so he'd probably just adopt whatever the people around him did

Dedicated servers coming over the summer, so that'll fix it. In the mean time, we just have to deal with it.

Offtopic, but nope, for huntress for example it is not.

Lerys is also good for a lot of Killers. :)

And dont forget wrotten fields :D

No it‚Äôs complete garbage, rest in peace brand new part

Looks like licensed DLC is on sale too.

No, ''tis Jesus Adam

Thats not a random steamer though? He's a Fog Whisperer and pretty sure he went with the others to BHVR Studios and learned all about the new killer.
---
BHVR fucking boomed me
---
I liked the original pip system better where it was based on getting as many bp as possible in the trial atleast for the survivor side, for the killer I like the emblem system as a mori counts toward a pip even though you won't double pip.
---
I *can* blame them. It's gutting when I bring my only mori to do the daily and all 4 DC on first down, or before I've even found them. Bonus points if I get the mori daily for Doc or Legion, then it's almost guaranteed I won't get it done.
---
I hear you. Hopefully it‚Äôs accurate though. And hopefully that means the 19th for the Western Hemisphere. 
---
Maybe, I‚Äôm no doctor, let alone one capable of handling the mentally disabled.
---
I love the "Basement Time" points in the end &lt;3
---
OMG Ruin so OP please nerf 
---
Trapper is ramrod straight. His head isn't even tilted forward. 
---
I dunno, I just see that some people save, some people don't, and it would be easier to power level if I saved up
---
Differently viable
---
Killers don't actually complain to survivors about gen rush, it's complaints toward BHVR with how fast matches can end if survivors focus on them exclusively!?
---
&gt;Ugh Bhvr's mind
---
FTFY
---
Lately I keep telling myself that there's a new hero coming out in a week or two and im going to be mad if i spend them. At the moment there is 500k bp's seriously burning a hole in my pocket but i just keep reminding myself this. Have a goal and then remind yourself what your workimg for when you want to spend them on.
---
It doesnt punish you, you just dont get as many emblem points or bloodpoints as someone who got in chases would. Although if you are in the terror radius slot and dont get seen you still get emblem points and boldness. Why should you get rewarded for chases if you didnt get in any?
---
I guess but I can‚Äôt help but feel a little bit of sympathy for those that do dc on potential mori‚Äôs. 
---
Well shit. Looks like it kept updating.
---
You can read more up on evader [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Evader), but I feel like a few of these figures are outdated but it still helps understand what the emblems want you to do. Stealth does award significant points to evader but it demands you to spend some time very close to the killer.
---
To be honest I have never used bloodhound on nurse. I've used it on other characters with good success but i feel that predator is more useful because they don't have to be injured for you to be able to track them. If you are good at tracking during your missed attack/fatigue then maybe you won't need predator, but i do lol
---
My fastest match as a killer was 1:50 also was playing myres that is a extremely rare and once in a gamers life time thing too bad I didn't record..
---
If you didn't do anything wrong, why the hell are you so worried?
---
I play the game as usual; Michael Myers with M&amp;A, B&amp;C, Ruin and SB
---
Unless there is no new killer coming I spend them as soon as I get them.
---
I don‚Äôt spend them unless I can complete an entire web. I also don‚Äôt spend unless I have a reason to. You can get up close to a mil, and then only spend when you may possibly exceed the cap in your next game. I usually hover around a million, drop to 750k, and then that will give me a few games before I need to spend again.
---
It will probably go on sale during Easter. You might fund that DLC could be on sale too during this period.
---
Thank you OP very cool
---
( This was a request ) Last chart meme I swear
---
You can save for new Chapters so you can get the new perks day 1.
---
I only play a few games on the days I do play, and it‚Äôs just for the fun of playing. I already have a decent amount of perks for my killers and my one serious survivor, so I don‚Äôt bother even going to the bloodweb most days. It‚Äôs a good way to accidentally save up points; just forget about it.
---
Gotta prestige that freddy tho
---
Wrong. You can slug the survivor or dribble them. DS is being nerfed within the week also.
---
I‚Äôm just worried that it‚Äôs some robot doing the report stuff and I would get beaned 
---
I just want to say, saving is nice because if you spend as you get them, you will burn items/offerings you have got in the bloodweb. If you save up, you now have a stock pile of things to use. While grinding and using up all of that, you can save again. Good way to ensure you always have items on a certain character. Plus 1 mil bp is pretty much 3 free teachables
---
I forgot about easter coming up soon, thanks! Do you think I should get the DLC's aswell?
---
/u/TYSoFly, if you're using Discord/Teamspeak crutches, doesn't that make you a baby surivivor?
---
Boy. Who taught you how to spell "Deny?"
---
To add to this, this is possible in DBD because they use a peer to peer system where the killer hosts the game on his PC so the killer is in complete control if they decide to cheat. Some people don't go full out lag switching but do download tons of data while in a game. This makes the survivors jittery and rubber band into walls, backwards into killers or just stop moving which gives the killer a huge advantage. 
---
Explain your view of why it is an exploit pls
---
Okay. Good for you.
---
How?
---
How about a petition to get you some more English lessons dude? Its spelled deny
---
Just cause you're team isn't coordinated you can still cleanse the totems. Just run Small Game when you play solo, you don't always need meta perks to win.
---
That hatch shit is honestly ridiculous. 
---
Jack with windbreaker suit here, can confirm. Cosmetic is cool, talent sucks.
---
i swear one day im gonna get the silent build you wont hear me get HIT or hear me IN PAIN or hear me WHEN I VAULT, i'll be the BIG STEALTH
---
and self care ofc because i suck at video games
---
Because spirit is cute
---
Decisive and noed aren't even an equal perk, with the decisive rework anybody could d strike you and you wouldn't know unless you pick them up, meanwhile noed is legit one of the easiest things to counter. You guys just want "equality" with perks
---
We'd have proper balancing for it already if there was less denial over their advantages, BHVR has no incentive to change anything when their majority demographic pretends like there's no problem. 
---
What other competitive game on the planet gives the host the power to avoid people based on their appearance in search for an inferior challenger?
---
I do, I'd prefer not to play against an opponent boosting their party, it's nothing personal. 
---
200% canon 
---
I enjoy playing against swf honestly, its more challenging and more satisfying once you win
---
They say they won't be touching Trapper for a while (since they already gave him a few buffs and QOL changes) I don't see any point in discussing possible buffs when we don't know what the meta is going to be for when/if they ever decide to give the Trapper some more love.
---
Because you are exploiting the fact that the skill check cant spawn when you first tap a generator. By continuing to tap it you make it never possible to get a skill check, therefore exploting a mechanic to avoid "difficult" gameplay
---
&gt; 4 P3 claudette with flashlights
---
What a hyperbole
---
The reason DS and NOED are bad for the game is because they reward mistakes. Franklins doesn‚Äôt do this, but I agree that it‚Äôs annoying af,but far from being toxic to the game
---
Who doesn‚Äôt use a third party program for voice chat in ANY game? The game is not ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù around lack of communication. The only people who would utilize an in-game voice chat would be solo people. So why would they bother spending money and resources implementing one? Last time I checked *‚ÄòSurvive With Friends‚Äô*is an actual playmode, *‚ÄòKill solo survivors with no items or bloody/bought clothes‚Äô isn‚Äôt.‚Äô*
---
I did that the other day when a hag brought only hexs to a match. I figured she would have noed so i got rid of every totem and it turns out she did have it and didnt have a totem to use it with. A nurse had one too. I didnt cleanse any totems but found the noed one shortly after it acitivated. The survivors think if we remove noed they won't die anymore or something lol.
---
And the Re4 chainsaw controller
---
Hell yeah brother.
---
Yea I need it so I can be T O X I C, then proceed to get facecamped for my efforts and complain about it on Reddit...
---
Why isn't it? Especially if other hexs are active. 
---
Hey, thx for the reply. I think I get what you say, but my point is that I try to avoid being seen at all. I like playing "ninja-style" and therefore I was wondering why you HAVE TO be chased to get more points/ higher emblems. You obviously have to manage both (being chased and hiding) to get Iridescent. That is what I dont understand. Why it has to be the combination? If you did exceptionally well in hiding OR chase, then why will you get less points than being okay in both? I hope I could clarify my point of matter.
---
oh wow what a fucking surprise, you're totally wrong
---
big oof
---
In my experience, hexes are completely worthless against SWF. If one finds it, it's immediately swarmed, especially if it's Ruin, and they can cover ground four times as fast to find it. Third Seal is doubly as useless and knockout is almost completely useless.
---
On top of that, they all immediately know what killer I am when I find just one. If I'm chasing one, it's guaranteed that the others are working on generators, even in my terror radius. After I hook someone, the hooked person can say "Oh, he's coming your way Dwight.", "There's a trap on the pallet next to me/at my feet", "Okay, it's completely safe to come unhook me".
---
This game is not balanced around SWF. If you run into one as a killer, the clock is against you twice as hard as it is usually and even little mistakes can cost you the entire game.
---
Thanks!
---
Too much potential for trolling, would be a bad addition despite his nice it could end up being.
---
This comment doesn‚Äôt have nearly enough downvotes
---
&gt; The game is not ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù around lack of communication
---
It obviously is, otherwise why would there be perks like Bond and Kindred and no in-game method of comms?
---
I am right there with you. I have tons of cosmetics for my Meg and I always get caught. Lol! I am surprised I don't get more messages that say "ggez" 
---
On topic, how does one tell if killer has bbq&amp;c? 
---
Can't wait to get more hatemail when I DC due to survivors wanting to tbag and taunt at me while I'm sucking ass as killer.
---
&gt; Who doesn‚Äôt use a third party program for voice chat in ANY game?
---
Why do you keep avoiding the questions I'm asking you? *This game isn't balanced around voice comm*, while CoD or Battlefield or Overwatch or whatever game you might mention absolutely is, and they have baked-in chat programs for and because of it. 
---
&gt;The game is not ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù around lack of communication.
---
If you're acting dense than this going to be a waste of time, but if you really need examples of how coordinated voice-comm undermine certain perks and mechanics in DBD because nothing is coming to your mind right now, then just ask.
---
Matchmaking won‚Äôt fix rank issues, trust me rank 1s 90% of the time play like rank 15s. Until the new rank syste, comes in (and hopefully makes it harder) we‚Äôre gonna get so many potatoes.
---
*Cleanses 2 seconds into the match
---
In a 4 man SWF I‚Äôll still use bond, it‚Äôs real-time information. I‚Äôll use kindred when I‚Äôm playing solo.
---
No joke, i had to do a double take to make sure it was the same name. Isn't this the person that had a semi-tantrum on a NOED post because survivor mains get on his/her nervs or some weak ass excuse like that?
---
This didn't really address any of my points in any way at all
---
Shit I gotta dodge everyone now
---
Where are my testicles, Summer?
---
Dbd is far from being competitive 
---
Maybe for you. 
---
This was awesome. I‚Äôll have to try this build sometime...
---
An inferior challenge or a remotely balanced one? SWF straight up nullifies a lot of killer perks. It's a massive advantage for the survivors. Enjoy the survivor queues. 
---
Thx for the hyperlink, apparently there are some multipliers for hiding well, even more compared to the chasing ones, as far as I can see.   
---
I guess the reason why I didn't get a higher emblem is simply the fact versing the pig, which do not have any terror radius in stealth-mode. So maybe the game let me accumulate points in that category cause it didnt even realize me being hiding. 
---
If this assumption's true, then there's the question why there isn't any exception for cases like this.  
---
But thanks anyway for your help. :)  
---
If they go straight to a survivor that is a decent bit away after hooking someone they likely have it. That and if they look around mindlessly after hooking someone it‚Äôs pretty likely. 
---
So I ask you, again; if you are getting yourself easier matches through Discord/Teamspeak/PartyChat, doesn't that make you a baby survivor?
---
Rune
---
Decisive strike doesnt reword you
---
uh no Adrenaline should not wake up survivors
---
You can choose not to boost your squads with third-party apps that unambiguously give you competitive advantages and easier matches. Solo survivors are playing the baseline survivor experience, SWF + Discord are getting lesser challenges. 
---
Damn, 5 minutes too late
---
Honestly. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even bother reopening the game because it kisses me off so much to get stuck on the loading screen
---
Until dedicated servers are out, I will remain humble and not BM the Killer.
---
You might end up magically on a hook 10 seconds later.
---
Devs also thought legion was ok to release into the game, they definitely don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs best for it 
---
You did fucking awesome. I do wish I could play against you as you are a good sport
---
Yeah honestly it depends on the situation anf how ballsy youre feeling. Cant be mad at someone leaving when theres noed, but it feels so good when they clutch a noed play
---
Go to the wiki.
---
Neither does a redditor.
---
Thanks man, you sound like a fun killer to go against :)
---
This is so so adorable! I feel really down and this cheered me up. Thank you!
---
IRL there should a girl that looks almost identical to meg, and she is one fine lady
---
Oh, well I thought I helped explain it, that they're trying to avoid a boosted party and get a balanced match. It's like in Civ 5; you can turn up the difficulty if you want an extra challenge but it doesn't make your AI opponent smarter or throw new mechanics at you to learn to counter, it just gives boosts your opponent. 
---
Depends on the skillgap, as always. I'm pretty sure there's a skillful enough survivor for any Nurse player, prove me wrong
---
BTW I think you need NOED on any killer, thats exactly skillgap defence which isn't required if you win before all gens are done.
---
But, any kind of Exposed is good on Nurse, you just need to think if the conditions suit for your skills/gameplay preferences
---
I've never been so scared EVER. Thought it could be cool to show you guys. It's on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwIqH49l8Vg&amp;lc=z22dv1xa2rfiihfmiacdp4350mrcejkhs15p32o0ustw03c010c) aswell for the ones intrested :)
---
The worst is when they face camp but feel the need to keep hitting you while you‚Äôre on the hook. Congrats on continually hitting an immobile player. That‚Äôs some big micro penis energy.
---
But not steps:(
---
They said they are trying out a new system so idk
---
If you're toxic to the point that for me, I'll get a better feeling out of you dying than doing well, I'll camp. Rare occasion but that's the only reason I'll camp
---
I play normally because I‚Äôm not lonely and don‚Äôt get mad when people play with their friends 
---
üëåüèæ I was thinking the same thing
---
The hooked survivor is the objective once the gates are open. It entirely depends on which killer I'm using. It's just asinine to leave the hook if 2 survivors are uninjured and able to go for the unhook and I'm on a killer with low mobility and no one shot potential.  Hillbilly? Sure, I'll leave the hook. Spirit, I'll probably mind game it and then leave it. I mean, if I'm in that situation, I fucked up a long time ago and that last kill is probably all I'm going to get against non-potatoes.
---
Yeah that's my thoughts exactly. I thought about gen based lock too, but I just don't like the idea of killer depending on gens done, besides it's how Rancor already works.
---
But yeah, thats an option too
---
LEVEL 11, RANK 19 KILLER, RANK 17 SURVIVOR. PC
---
im facing rank 16 killers who are LOADED.   
---
Sorry i disagree. I play doctor a lot and ran iron maiden for like 20 games. No one ever went in a locker. Good survivors just dont bother. Like ever. But when head on comes put then maybeeee haha
---
Thats my thoughts
---
Ok
---
When you're running a loot build but you only get a Broken Key with beads.
---
If you want to use Noed whatever man power to you. But blaming it on hatch is pretty dumb, just because a surv brings in a key doesn't mean they even get to see the hatch. Theres a decent chance they'll be killed long before that. If you're so against the key then simply "tunnel" that surv.
---
Guess they know I‚Äôm never taking it off
---
Myer's posture is so straight he has an undefined slope.
---
I've literally never used noed... 
---
&gt;bringing a gun to a knife fight 
---
I feel like that's a bit of a hyperbole.
---
Yeah sure they'll be a bit harder, but it doesn't change the fact that indiviually they will be just as bad. If you know how to apply pressure and do chases well you won't have a problem with them.
---
Me: my time has come
---
Random: we must find ruin 
---
Killer lobbies take a lot longer than they should to find and survivor lobbies are instant... but they were that way before too. Idk why people are celebrating when half of the game now unnecessarily takes a lot longer to play than it should while nothing else changes.
---
How about we just use what's in the game and stop making up fake rules for the other side to follow?  
---
    
---
The same as the old days when the kid would say "you can't choose M. Bison, and if you use Ryu you're not allowed to throw fireballs."
---
What did you use to make this? Also how difficult is it to make something like this?
---
I'm fairly sure the report button in-game actually isn't connected to anything. Imagine sifting through the torrent of false reports of killers "wall hacking" with nurse's calling or BBQ, "face camping" cheating, DCs, etc.
---
The only way to legit report someone is on their main site and you need to upload a video of it. Even then it usually doesn't do anything.
---
My killer matches a few days ago were instant. Now it takes me a solid few minutes to find anything. Also it's awesome that they release this around rank reset where everything is chaotic enough as it is to obfuscate results
---
*Laughs in Nurse*
---
Sooner or later they'll have to sort that out.
---
What? Lol
---
Sure.  its the same deal.  Just Karma farming with no effort.

Thank you ,‚úîÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

---
Everyone is arguing that Decisive is getting nerfed so Spirit is the better option. I think the change to Decisive will be a good one.
---
Go Spirit because you can get Decisive through bloodpoints whereas you don't get that option for grabbing a mew killer.
---
Baby killers I wouldnt really say so. Dbd ranks really only depend on time played not skill as much. I am not a great killer by any means but play a fair amount. It's fine if you get run around and outplayed and lose against good solo survivors and duos etc. But with a 4 queue some of them are too good and they just bully you :(. 
---
A base figure, paint, clothing to match, some sewing skills, access to a 3D printer, paint, brushes, glue, modelling paste, spare figure accessories. They take a while to do but I've been making custom dolls and figures a good few years now so you get the hang of your own style and skills

Billy‚Äôs chainsaw sound is buggy as hell, sometimes you hear a stuttered sound sometimes you hear nothing. Also leatherfaces chainsaw sometimes is absolutely silent.
---
Now there are going to be idiots who dodge because they think it‚Äôs swf
---
I never said they couldn't. In fact, the point I'm trying to make is people on both sides can play well and still get to a point where the other side has finished their objectives. The person I'm responded to said "Well if you play well survivors should not get all generators done." and earlier said that NOED exists to reward you for failing your objective. If anything, we agree, because I see NOED existing as a way to help if circumstances lead to a killer playing well and still having a chance to do something when gens are done. 
---
I also agree that it lets killers who play poorly to do the same, but there are plenty of perks on both sides that facilitate that, and some of them aren't even good. Basically, I hate the argument of "It rewards killers for not doing well."
---
Well I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure you will always getting more points in it if you get chased. In order to get alot of points if you stay hidden is to pretty much always be in the terror radius and never get seen. I get what you are saying and you can absolutely get rewarded for "ninja stule" you just have to spend a very large amount of time in the terror radius while hidden. I got way to track it would be using diversion and getting a ton of the pebbles. I believe its 45 seconds per pebble so if you can manage to get 3 or 4 pebbles you should be pretty good.
---
I think you just got use to high ping
---
&gt;bringing a gun to a knife fight
---
&gt;&gt;I feel like that's a bit of a hyperbole.
---
It was an analogy, I'm not really trying to equivocate the value of a gun in a fight compared to a voice app in a video game, just trying to show that denying that you're giving yourself easier matches when you use third-party programs is silly, since the examples of how you're getting easier matches should be obvious. 
---
&gt;If they aren't that insanely hard then what's the point of dodging them?
---
They're less fun to face, so there's no reason to if you could get a group that the game can balance for instead. 
---
If that ain't a feel and a half. 
---
This happens as a killer sometimes. If I'm playing huntress and someone unhooks from really far away I would like to see them so I can aim. With that huge black hole on my screen I cant see shit.
---
My reason for dodging as killer is that me and 3 survivors have been waiting for the final survivor for 4 minutes and it's clear we've fallen off the matchmaking machine.
---
Repairing gens are the most boring part of the game, most people would agree that interaction with the killer is the most fun part. If the killer doesn‚Äôt take part then it‚Äôs a boring game. If there was no killer and all we did was do gens and leave, no one would play.
---
Get rekt buddy. Gimmie that purple flashlight and say bye to that white ward.

&gt;they are less fun to face

Since we're talking about in-game advantages now, do you think people shouldn't be notified when the killer is using an ebony mori/broken add ons/top tier killers prior to the match so that they can dodge them?
---
Franklin's gets rid of items, which are unnecessary advantages for survivors. Especially good for getting rid of overpowered items, including ones like purple flashlights.
---
I am Gud tier maker :D
---
lol that killer is pathetic for tunneling you so hard and still not getting you, nice job w the jukes and mind games lol
---
Yep that's the one, sad that people listen to bad folk like him that only help increase the hatred one side has for the other.
---
I don't see Myers though.
---
Oh I thought her name was hickey Mickey

I think it is because you get an effect. Like mangled, exposed or exhaustion. It's kins of annoying.

---
Exactly! I just don't understand what the problem with implementing one is. They can always just buff killers again if they think its too strong. :c 
---
I totally understand where you're coming from. However, the power is all in the killer player's hands as they are the host and dont share the host specific responsibilities with anyone else. Lobbies shouldn't be killer dependent for this purpose. In the mean time, playing killer should come with an understanding that you're potentially screwing others out of a good 5, 10, 30 minutes of their time while you go virtually unaffected. 
---
Also, my experience with swf's has been the opposite of a clear win. I find that killer mains sometimes exaggerate the advantages of swf's. When I do swf's it's to have a good time with friends. Not beat the killer to a pulp by having a flawless 4k escape. 
---
Lastly, I've had many experiences where I'm only swf with 2 people and still had a dc. Very crude.

---
you strip an ethernet cable, find the the solid orange cable and put a switch on it (a simple toggle switch). Connect that cable between you computer/console and the router/switch. The orange wire is the negative receiver of the cable. To put it simple, a multiplayer game is a server with machines connected to it. Players machine announce to the server what they want to do, the server make some calculations and "announce" the result to the rest of the players.
---
When you open the switch, you make this communication very slow and the server struggles to hangle it. It also depends on the configuration of the server, it doesn't work on every single game. Since DBD makes the killer the host of the game, it is pretty effective. Most decent servers will just kick players with a too high ping.
---
The humour just seems a bit random. It doesn't really have much base and it's used to seem quirky or get easy laughs (Sorry if I explained that poorly)
---
Thank you for the very well thought out response! I found that I was indeed just trying to go for kills rather than just trying to down survivors and patrol gens. So I did resolve to facecamping. 
---
I never realized that there was so many more bloodpoints for doing that, as I made the mistake of thinking kills earned the most! 
---
So thanks for the help! 
---
I have no problem in them doing that, i supported them as much as i could when they acquired all the rights to the game and started going down a better path, but Jesus Christ if they want to make money through dlc i hope they never do something like Legion again, from the barely tested power to the fact there are 4 of them for no other reason than for 2 of them to be reskins with not even unique voices or something. The next killer seems they have actually learned something from the shit they got, so i am more than hopeful.

I, a Rank 12 Survivor, got matched with a Rank 20 Leatherface today. They only had one add-on and a tier one BBQ.
---
They didn't get to hook anyone the whole game and quit immediately after it ended. :(
---
Ah yes I found out how to jumps  windows
---
BBQ and Chili, after you hook a survivor you get a massive blood points bonus and all survivors outside of a certain radius are revealed to you for a few seconds. It makes things annoying real quick, especially with the killer it was given to, Leatherface.
---
&gt;Since we're talking about in-game advantages and enjoyment of the game now, do you think people should be notified when the killer is using an ebony mori/broken add ons/top tier killers prior to the match so that they can dodge them?
---
I wouldn't disagree with better balancing for Moris, the ebony especially, but they're part of the game and they're (presumably) accounted for in balancing when they look at kill/escape ratios, so I see it differently from using tools that the game doesn't support or balance around. There's always going to be characters or perks or items that you'd prefer not to face, so we can't avoid them all. I also don't think it's as necessary for survivors to dodge a lobby, since it's 16 perks and 4 offerings versus 4 perks and 1 offering. The killer has the advantage against any survivor, but it becomes harder to counter loadouts when there's 4 people who can coordinate and there's a very high ceiling on survivor gameplay because of it. 
---
Iridescent Button Legion with Kim Wilde's 'Kids In America'.
---
That is all.
---
You'll get a warning before you get a ban
---
What if for every totem cleansed, 1% action speed when the survivor is healthy.
---
A feng min has joined the chat
---
But they're getting easier matches in the process. So you're just trying to enjoy your night, getting yourself easier matches, and the killer is just trying to enjoying their night and get easier matches.... so why are they a baby and you're not? 
---
Swf is also a part of the game now, even tho it wasn't part of the original design. But then again, neither was Nurse or Legion.
---
You don't see a double standard here? If the killer chooses to dodge something they don't have much fun against, then it's fine. But the opposite is not? 
---
That would suck üòÇüòÇ
---
Onomatopoeia
---
So what you're saying is that you think dbd is flawed because everything "apparently" depends on the survivors, and that killers can do nothing, and all survivors who get downed, do it because they are bad?
---
I got hit with a rank 7 killer today, me being rank 15, so, yeah I'd say its fucky
---
This is based on the [fuck chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b0mm94/and_as_by_popular_demand_the_killer_fuck_chart/) created by u/CynthiaArts

---
Can explain?
---
That's not Trapper
---
David is that you‚Äôre stuck with no mither.
---
Oh boy, a 5% action speed bonus if I cleanse all the totems in the entire map! That's even better than prebuff tier one prove thyself!
---
Oh might be op
---
I don't even know where to start with this comment.
---
How about, first off, the main issue with game health is that there is a lack of people willing to play killer right now. It's not an issue with survivor grievances, despite you wanting it to be so badly.
---
Secondly, it's not that it's a slightly more difficult match, it's that SWF subverts game mechanics and balance and renders various killer builds untenable.
---
Third, BBQ is not a reliable aura reading perk, especially when you're hooking the second to last person
---
Lastly, slugging is something devs intended and DCing for that reason is toxic and against the rules
---
Because people hate SWF because they're playing with their friends. Cut the bullshit, it's because they commonly use voice comms and you know it.
---
I think that's why the reports are almost useless. Too many false reports
---
I can't say I didn't see this coming... I'll be sure to use no mither even if it's my only perk.
---
No matter how many updates come out in their favor you will never strip NOED off their userbase.  All the balance in the world won't get them to cast aside their safety net.  Most users rely on it for their downs.  You can always see it coming too when you see how horribly they play chases.  You just stop halfway through the chase and go no way can I trust your totems lol.  
---
Hah, jokes on you, I always look around like an idiot.
---
OP asks for a discussion then when someone states their opinion, OP says "wrong!" then eventually starts insulting and swearing and does the "if you don't like it you can get out" argument.  So really what you want, OP, is an echo chamber...not a discussion.

---
&gt; Swf is also a part of the game now, even tho it wasn't part of the original design
---
Yes obviously SWF is part of the game, but voice-comm programs are *not* part of the game. It's great that they say they're balancing around SWF, but they are NOT there yet, there's clearly still perks and mechanics that are undermined by it, and using voice apps are still unambiguously a competitive advantage. Maybe we'll get there eventually but if you currently agree that we're not there yet than it's a moot point to make. 
---
&gt;You don't see a double standard here? If the killer chooses to dodge something they don't have much fun against, then it's fine. But the opposite is not?
---
It's a false equivalency, not everyone can have fun against every perk, item, or mechanic, so you can't allow every single player to screen their matches. But allowing survivors to dodge opponents would completely phase out certain killers, or at least exacerbate the hierarchy. You'd have to pick Wraith or Freddy every time for any player to get a match. There'd be even less variety, and they wouldn't be able to design or sell new killers unless they were bad enough not to get dodged. This can't happen with survivors since every character plays exactly the same, nobody would be forced to pick Feng or Jake or something just to get a match. 
---
To answer your question, in general no, I don't think it's fair that one side gets to screen their matches and the other doesn't in a competitive game. In the context of Dead By Daylight's design, and the nature of how loadouts work(16 vs 4 perks, 4 vs 1 offering)it makes more sense, and I don't it makes any to equivocate this between the two sides. 
---
I couldn't count the amount of times I had killers complaining that we as survivors were "gen rushing". So yes they absolutely do
---
How do you mean nearly? Does it go up stairs/steps?
---
When you are halfway up the hill in certain maps, you can shock survivors if they are on the ground. There can't be a higher height difference than that.
---
It's so helpful for killers and gives so many bp you should just assume they all have it. Just like nurses, assume everyone has it and don't heal in the terror radius.
---

-30 and you got +10. Oh boy, time to ruin the idea of you thinking you're good.
---
Way back when, things like odd bulbs and intense halogens would let you get a save in a far less than a second and would barely use any extra charge from your flashlight. Now, bulbs and halogens eat your flashlight charge in seconds, and flashlight saves have been nerfed with a reduced pickup time from 4.3 to 3 seconds. It's just much better to not even bother with them anymore. You can tell who does and doesn't know how to use flashlights properly because of these changes. If you see anyone running those old, nerfed add-ons, you can be guaranteed they don't know how to flashlight save or blind the killer effectively. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing more jump scary than when you finish a gen and instantly have a whisper quiet chainsaw being jammed into your back
---
You lose emblem points if you camp though, no matter what time of the game you're doing the camping.
---
You outright lose score if you're too close to a hooked survivor.
---
If the exit gates are open and I've got someone hooked, I'll usually try to play defense somewhere between them and the exit gates, or at least one exit game if I can.
---
The closer you are to the hooked survivor, the worse your score at the end of the game. And besides, if they try for it and you're good enough at killer, you can usually catch them both, and then you've got two hooks. Playing defense somewhere that's not right next to the hook baits them into going for the unhook, in my experience.
---
yep, its basically a free borrowed time at the Endgame 
---
Great now I want Rambo as a survivor... I mean killer.
---
Only 2? Do you play like 2 hours a week?
---
Survivormain 
---
I think that is interesting, as I have done the same with Thrill of the Hunt acting as a buffer.
---
Though, I always feel a bit of anxiety because we currently can't tell which totem is being done, so we instinctively protect it as best we can. The elimination of its own totem will make sure that any active totem on the map is the real deal, and you won't have to worry whether or not they broke the one that matters to you. If they are working on it, you go after them. Especially if the amount of totem breaking time is adjusted a bit, so that its just a bit longer so you have a better chance of protecting.
---
Haunted Grounds adds to this playstyle. A survivor will never know you have this perk until they break the totem. And if they do, you have an opportunity to knock them down if they commit. Realistically, you won't be able to have more than 3 active totems with this change. Because one will go to a Haunted grounds perk slot, and if you add thrill of the hunt, then you can only have a maximum of 2 active totems. So at max, that would be 3 active totems for haunted grounds to work active on. That's 3 minutes, which is not long at all. And there are times totems get popped simultaneously.
---
The thing is, in practice, these things work differently than we imagine. For example, when you run haunted ground, how many downs do you get in that 60 sec window? Probably 1 at most, if your like me. The icon indicates to the survivor they are exposed, and they scatter like roaches. They don't bunch up like idiots. The same happens to Mikey in Tier 3. People don't even save, they wait until its gone first. Which means, Haunted grounds can have an added benefit of slowing the game down, just a little bit. I think in practice it will make Haunted Grounds much more practical, instead of a "maybe I can get lucky and get 1 down". I mean, it takes an entire perk slot, it should have more benefit. And survivors really should be apprehensive about how and when they pop the totem. The game should be centered around anxiety and apprehension, its a horror game. The lit totem shouldn't be looked at as an arcade item that we run to like a pac-man bubble.

Who knows? Just about everyone who is consistently good with flashlights.

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b16m9s/slug/eimcsoz
---
Moris are part of the game and they're accounted for in kill/escape ratios. Discord isn't part of the game, you're downloading a third-party program that gives you an easier match, and that's a pretty big false equivalency with using items like Mori or BNP or Medkits that make the match easier. 
---
You missed the point. His point is that people do SWF because they just want to play together, not to make your life harder.
---
Imagine thinking flashlights are op 
---
Exactly, thankfully out of the many killer games I've played this has only happened on one occasion. I talked to the survivors post game and they tried everything they could to do to get off hook, so assuming they were telling the truth it wasn't malicious.  
---
But if we go back to pre-nurse gameplay it was one hell of a ride to play killer (all hooks sabo'd, only the basement available miles away from the downed survivors)
---
Pathetic? After that long, you're basically committed as you're probably losing without pressure. At that point, might as well practice my chasing against a good runner. 
---
If I manage to get them, I'm letting them go....for 2 reasons. 
---
1) Killing them will probably make them toxic in the chat afterwards about how bad I am for "throwing the game by tunneling and being pathetic"
---
2) allows me to actually say gg and say it was a fun chase. They might even give me pointers afterwards. Always willing to learn how to be better. 
---
This happened to me only once. Letting them go might not have changed their chat afterwards, but they were friendly about it.  Not only did I get better at chasing, but I learned a few things about looping that I didn't know before. 
---
I've had times where I'm working on a gen and then someone gets downed, they DS and keep the chase for an extra 15 seconds, then get hooked. Thats 20 seconds saved and I wouldn't have finished the generator I was working on if she didn't have DS
---
And? That doesn't make my point less valid.
---
Survivormain's are considered to be more toxic than killermains, would you agree with this statement
---
NOPE!  Learned that the hard way.  Even if they are on the world‚Äôs tiniest incline the shock will not touch them and will instead burrow through the earth beneath them.  Thank god none of the survivors are wearing platform shoes, otherwise Doctor would be fucked!
---
Finally the Killer The Teacher has been released!
---
Considering all the nerfs survivors have been given, it's clear that they were (if not still are) very powerful. 
---
Salf care is trash wtf im crying
---
Nevermind, turns out longer queue times aren't because of rank but because of BHVR's new system. Sucks to be me I guess.
---
It's pretty simple actually. Drag Race is made/for/by The Gays
---
And DBD is a horror game, which is a genre traditionally really loved by said The Gays. The overlap is natural!
---
*frick
---
And people say this is a killer-sided sub. Hardly.
---
It‚Äôs beautiful,,,
---
These are the tier lists I didn't knew I needed, thank you op, very cool
---
What about not being able to unhook someone if the killer is in X range within the hook? doesn't apply if the player is using borrowed time.
---
My love for drawing girls with long flowing hair influenced the creation of this mini comic
---
You've probably never played as Killer, spent the whole match trying to get 1 kill and then get teabagged at the exit...it's not a great feeling and really doesn't make you want to play again.
---
They can‚Äôt stop people dodging lobbies can they, well, unless they have some special mind control built into their next patch. 
---
Would it bother you if every time you vs'd a certain killer (eg hillbilly) they just tunneled you to death and smacked you on the hook until you died?
---
Would you start to call hillbilly's toxic, or just tell yourself "don't take it personal"?
---
True, it could only work with a prechosen list of songs or ones submitted and reviewed :(
---
Well this isn't technically true. I just had a survivor try to do the hill rock glitch to hold the game hostage and even though they hung out there the whole game I was eventually able to convince them to jump off by shocking them over and over. I guess they found their scream more annoying than the joy from attempting to grief me, or they underestimated how long I was willing to sit there and spam them back with noise.
---
By that same logic hiding in lockers when the killer has bbq is an exploit

Even though the Spirit is dead, Amanda is dead too (her bullet wound on her neck healed somehow). But this is cute too.

Looks like you'll be playing me quite a bit then. I don't lobby dodge SWF but if you're part of a flashlight toting, P3 squadette please don't complain about Franklin's and an Ebony Mori.
---
I have legit almost never used an addon on her, cause they feel so meh and I never know if the addons have an effect or not, so why bother?
---
He was a camping leatherface as well D:
---
No, a bit more than that. It just doesn't happen all that often.
---
I don't think BHVR has to exclusively focus on only one aspect of the game. There's plenty BHVR can do to bring solo survs up closer to SWF level without actually buffing SWF/weakening killer.
---
 
---
Congratulations. That's the joke. 
---
My brain thought Brock Samson for a second, then I wondered whether he'd be better off as a killer than survivor..
---
I'm ok with waiting 1-3 minutes for a match as survivor,  but the ping has been ATROCIOUS.  I haven't had more than 2 matches with less than 200 ping.  
---
I've gotten used to being hit through pallets anyhow.  
---
I think it does, NOED is never a factor if you bother with the totems, that's just the fact of the matter. It's not some unstoppable force, it's easily dealt with, even more so if you play with a friend and can co-ordinate but I'll get rid of multiple totems even when I'm playing alone. 
---
People just play against it wrong, especially if the game is as much as a stomp as players make it out to be since, if that's the case, people should have multiple hooks left before dying so that's plenty of time to find the hex totem if it's active. The problem is that most players will go for dumb saves or just straight up leave and then cry about it afterwards. 
---
I've just said it to another person and I'll say it again, the true power of NOED is it's ability to punish gen rushing without preparation. The active part of the hex is easily dealt with.
---
Really? I would‚Äôve gone with a killer
---
Thrill of the hunt has a totem counter on it that works the whole game. 
---
Why can‚Äôt small game?
---
Yup.  Not had more than a couple of matches with under 200 ping.  
---
jup 
---
An actual 5 stacked Devour Hope that didn't get cleansed? Truly this is fiction.
---
Probably more. Haven't actually seen it since it came out lol
---
didnt take 2 days, did it 6 hours after the reset lol
---
I mean if you count the entire bus...
---
Doesn't appear to be live on PS4. Survivors still load piecemeal and get stuck with three in a lobby. At least they were last time I played (about 12 hours ago)

&gt;This on our list of discussion not in our priority tho but yes this is a discussion that we will need to have with our design team. If you are using a macro ( that make your click faster ) all that I can say at the moment is, it is at your own risk.
---
Lol. More than half the time I play with friends its without voice. Swfs biggest appeal is knowing you're playing with friends who often share your own skill level, will actually help you and wont just DC bc whatever. Voice or not, if you have a decent team, the results should be close to the same. Or at the very least the game wont be utter chaos and stupidity. 
---
In solo the odds of getting a decent team with our garbage ranking system and matchmaking is at cancerous levels and ggez for the killer. That's the real reason killers dont like swf. Trust me when I say, voice doesn't save bad survivors from themselves lol. 
---
BBQ. Ruin's a pain in the ass. I only run it for the sake of having enough time to set up. 
---
The new system will throw you in a game. It‚Äôs this or no game with long waits
---
I prefer crappy matchups 
---
Yeah, shit your pants first, then go to the toilet..
---
\&gt;&gt;Outstanding move
---
It's better to just buy the DLC.
---
It only costs two dollars more and you get both the Survivor and Killer as well as additional and unique cosmetics for the Survivor.
---
Generally if I cant get to a gen it's because you guys were so close and every time i move to a new gen you're right there again with the killer. It's easier with swf because you know when the chase starts since you may not get hit for a while.
---
BBQ IMO. It‚Äôs ALL about the double BP. Plus it‚Äôs a major boost to aura reading witch can sometimes slow the game down just a lil bit more than ruin. But ultimately it‚Äôs your choice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I usually get the first hit because they always underestimate how short out lunge is. It with Sloppy and Nurses works literal wonders. I still haven‚Äôt gotten Predator on her. I stopped leveling when I got most of the metas to 3. I don‚Äôt even level for addons. I wish I had more watches...
---
This will work to our advantage
---
I would honestly prefer that if they were to implement a totem counter, it wouldn't be a perk. Just another bandaid fix like ruin is imo. 
---
This completely defeats the purpose of the ranking system then.
---
And that. 
---
Oooh, yes. This is dope.
---
No because that's what lockers are designed for, aura hiding and hiding from the killer, the gen was not designed for gen tapping.
---
Useless. 
---
TRUE. I NEVER PLAY KILLER BUT I HAVE SEEN HOW SURVIVORS JUKE SO I PROBABLY NEED MORE PRACTICE BUT IN THE MEANTIME I'LL CONTINUE TO RAGE AND RANT ABOUT NOED. THANK YOU

That actually happened to me. I was about to kill the last guy and he dc'd and then messaged me telling me he won because I didn't kill him. I was like "dude... You definitely lost more than I did" and he just wouldn't accept that. 
---
I see you are a man of culture
---
take a longer shower
---
If we're talking add-ons? Iridescent Head and Utility Belt. Gives you 3 instadown Hatchets. Combine with an Ebony Mori for maximum pain. 
---
Save it for the final gen when the killer doesn't have to patrol far distances.
---
It doesn't mean you're wrong, but geesh you're coming off angry for no reason.
---
You're not entitled to the item, lil' baby survivor 
---
Thanks? 
---
Hasn't changed on xbox it seems
---
What did you do to get facecamped so often? 
---
You can't lose if you never play.
---
If Killers could close the hatch then Killers would complain about immersed Survivors just hiding for 20 minutes in the end game.  Trying to do gens when you are the only Survivor left is basically impossible. Might as well hide in basement lockers for basement points, stealth around to build up boldness points, etc
---
About the same as Ochido‚Äôs ‚ÄúLETS DO DIS‚Äù when he loads into a game, so around 200 Decibels?
---
Why not just have that as the terror radius? That would terrify me anyway.
---
The nerf to self care was the dumbest thing imo. The perk was perfectly balanced. Now it's just more m1ing. I rarely used it. Never found it to be a great perk and it's not hard to find other survs if I need a heal. 
---
As killer I took nurses calling. I still think it's one of the best perks. Loved it on Myers and my Spirit. Nerfing SC was to quiet the baby killers bc they all insisted it was the reason they were bad. Welp they still cry and now I'm seeing more whining about adrenaline even though we still have freaking *recently* slightly buffed noed. 
---
Feng Min is bae
---
My take on it is that the developers want everything to be rewarded, but you need to be able to do everything to consistently pip, which is pretty reasonable tbh. 
---
The problem is that in a lot of individual games you don‚Äôt get the chance to do everything, you end up being the team evader or you happen to be left alone to do gens, so it doesn‚Äôt matter how well rounded you are, you‚Äôre still not getting rewarded.
---
For the rank up system to properly reward well rounded players it would need to be able to analyse performance over multiple games, but that‚Äôs probably impractical.
---
Might be controversial, but maybe they could reward survivors based on game length? Killers already get points in Gatekeeper for game length so it could be fair, though I can already hear people crying about encouraging genrushing.
---
It's also so ridiculous because you literally just have to do some totems. Like I know it's a meme but it seriously isn't that difficult to do. 
---
Nothing will happen behaviour know that most reports are false they probably only keep it in the game so those type of people have a way of feeling good about them selfs 
---
In other words, people prefer playing survivor on PS4, and people prefer playing killer on PC. 
---
Probably has to do with skill caps and effectiveness of killers on different platforms.
---
But isn‚Äôt balanced landing mediocre since some maps don‚Äôt even have drops?
---
Taking a hit for an injured survivor. So bodyblocking the hook, tanking a a hit then unhooking, cutting in front of a tunneling killer and my favorite jumping in front of billy‚Äôs Chainsaw 
---
You dont need heals at any and all times. I play injured all the time. There are a lot of times survs waste time healing in a corner when they should be gen rushing the last two gens. Adren is also great if you've been hooked and camped after the gates are open. It's like a free bt. 
---
All my friends laughed but I've recently gotten them all hooked on adren instead of sc and we all get fun and good plays with it. Survs can heal eachother. Never understood why you needed a perk for it. (Uh. Bc you dont)
---
Mummy confirmed next killer.
---
every killer boycot bhvr dlc
---
nobody give them money
---
they think they will force us to play against swf groups
---
Also, if you rescue a teammate from a bear trap.
---
Absolutely, as Killer it's important to be able to snap to Survivors that try a last-second juke to the side, and with a controller you can't really do that.
---
Yeah, how could you ever succeed without having to play with 3 perks after the first minute? 
---
Anytime you get hit when in close proximity of an injured survivor grants you a token. It also grants you a token if you are hit while body blocking a killer from a hook. 
---
The way you read isn't correct. If you were injured and the survivor you saved with BT took a hit with you close to them then they would gain a token. If you were to block a killer from hitting a survivor you just unhooked then you would gain a token.
---
Saving survivors off the hook is another way to gain tokens. 
---
Have my updoot 
---
OH GOD OH DAMN
---
I‚Äôve had moments where I‚Äôve just get downed again afterwards because the animation for getting downed takes longer than the animation for getting back up from adrenaline. By the time the animation for getting downed finishes and the getting up animation plays, the killer‚Äôs successful hit animation finishes and they just hit me again. 
---
A plan for the Trapper to be taken into the Entity's realm at the end after nearly being killed by MC, as in a "The Killer is still alive" clich√©. Maybe Benedict could appear in an after-credits scene where he investigates the ruins of the original estate and disappears.
---
Nobody said anything about voice comms making bad survivors good; bad survivors will be bad no matter what. My point is, voice comms gives every survivor advantages they were not meant to have, bad, good, or inbetween.
---
Can we have Stephanie as the next licensed survivor with Robbie Rotten being the new killer pls?
---
When you try and tell someone to 'cut the bullshit' when you completely misunderstand their point, you probably shouldn't be trying to justify it. 
---
The validity is irrelevant if you don't understand what you're replying to in the first place.
---
It‚Äôs almost certainly more because killer runs at like 20 FPS max. I say this because while it was bad before, the engine update made it that much worse and before the engine update I didn‚Äôt really have any problem with survivor wait times. Truthfully killer wait times at rank 1 used to take a minute or two whereas it‚Äôs been damn near instant for me since then. 
---
its a piece of cake to make an escape cake
---
I think /u/nolgeek said it best.
---
&gt; It doesn't mean you're wrong, but geesh you're coming off angry for no reason.
---
In my words, I don't really care if your right or not, because you sound like an asshole.
---
ew xbox :)
---
Doesnt change anything, swf or not 1 person over 180 ping and I'm getting a new group of survivors. 
---
&gt;reports do nothing because I've been reported so much but I'm also not cheating.
---
It's as if you won't get banned if you aren't cheating. Reports only flag an account for review. PUBG on the otherhand bans you anyways and will fully ban after their investigation if you were cheating.
---
Lmao i love how all the comments that say they play freddy just fine and hes viable get downvoted. That's a lot of players who are staying bad lol. 
---
I am 90% sure you need to actually grab the survivor for it to count, similar to the ritual.
---
It is a lot easier to do if you trap pallets in a concentrated area and simply push any survivors towards it. Someone is bound to not see the traps and give you an easy grab. 
---
#W a n t
---
Crying about Adrenaline is just sad. I feel like if you play enough you can find your strengths and weaknesses as a Killer and with specific Killers. You then choose perks to shore up ypur weakness and either focus early game, midgame, or end game. If you let them knock out all the gens, they earned that Adrenaline and you better have an answer. NoEd works for that. Cleansing totems works for countering NoEd. It's a circle.
---
I've been doing it for a few years already, so it certainly doesn't get boring for some of us.
---
I love it when the survivors have a horrible time in my game. Ebony should be standard
---
Short answer, no. Does not go through floors
---
Long answer: sort of. There is a small area above and below the electricity you shoot out that can still hit survivors. Give or take a meter above and below
---
He isn't talking about rank, he is just one of the people in the sub that think "SWF god tier, plz keep away from me" and wants an added reward to even consider playing with them.
---
Too soon.
---
Usually in the few weeks after a chapter release.
---
Only way to balance solo and SWF is by nerfing SWF values; either the points they gain or their movement/heal/repair values. 
---
People aren't okay with "why punish me for playing with my friends lmao", so you get punished for not having friends to play with.
---
Alright
---
Reporting does nothing in this game, 100% sure the devs don‚Äôt even look at it. Played against a guy who was lag switching and my whole team reported him and next week we played against the same guy and upon starting the game he had downed two teammates. It‚Äôs a joke so don‚Äôt worry about it 
---
I sandbag the bloody Claudette every chance i get
---
Its an exaggeration chill.
---
Very creative. I am proud of you.
---
How do you know the killer has bad internet?
---
Yeah easy upvotes for whiners and super downvotes for anyone who says other wise.
---
Yeah but what we prefer and what they give us are two different things. If the counter was for everyone no ed would be pointless because there would be no totems left
---
An attempt was made.
---
If you get hatemail it means you are usually just playing to ruin other people's fun. Like, do what you want, but playing because you want hatemail usually means you are just not fun to play against. It just sounds kinda obnoxious and not all SWFs play to be shitbags.
---
That was a disgusting amount of windows right next to each other lol. Still I would've found a way to fuck that up. Nice running!
---
I said I feel some sympathy for those that dc when a killer brings a mori. It‚Äôs the equivalent to dodging SWF in a way. I‚Äôm unsure how that affects what side I main but alright I suppose.
---
Some time between the second coming of Jesus Christ and the release of Half Life 3.
---
(I think they said they were only doing x1.5 events now)
---
But just to clarify, as the video says this only applies to Medkits right?
---
Immersed Claudette detected.
---
 A.k.a. doing gens,you?
---
Yes 
---
The ranking system isn‚Äôt perfect as it sits now and the update won‚Äôt fix it either. It‚Äôs hard to score a life and death game that‚Äôs actions. It‚Äôs not like a FPS or battle royal. It‚Äôs a group of 5. And it‚Äôs a 4   V   1.  
---
Sounds like a job for MLGA
---
I got chased for about ten mins with one gen left (only me and another survivor tho, this was before closets hid auras btw) as soon as I got downed, guess which closet they were in? The basement. Two mins into my chase I saw them walking towards it and I knew there was a gen right next to it too! I died first hook.
---
I mean comeon the game wouldn't be anywhere near as tense come endgame and funny shit like this wouldn't happen.
---
I have this problem **constantly** whenever I try to heal on PC. It‚Äôs infuriating! 
---
*mild confusion* 
---
:/
---
For trapper, I've always considered the honing stone to be the most powerful add-on in his kit. It removes the independence of survivors escaping traps and forces another survivor to waste time running to him to help him out. 
---
The stitched bag is probably his next best add-on in my opinion as you start with 3 traps which helps reduce the amount of time you waste setting them. Also allows you to be more efficient with collecting them
---
Wraith wise his best addons are, in my opinion are his shadow dance add-ons. Help increase the speed you transverse environment and allows you to break pallets super fast. Can mind game survivors into dropping the pallet early with your power then breaking the pallet immediately. Basically brutal strength for free.
---
His ultra rare that allows him to see the repair intensity of gens is super strong in my opinion. The information it gives is great. Allows you to apply pressure to gens that survivors are working on the most.
---
Just a small tip on Hangman's trick if you ever do this (in case you're unaware): It applies to hooks that get destroyed from sacrafices, making areas of maps that are bare in hooks more reliable
---
Oh so you want borrowed time when it first came out only without tokens and it was one use?
---
Fair enough. Could you tell me the worst parts about it so I could improve?
---
Oh, in my head I thought you meant ALL totems were effected by Haunted Grounds. Actually, just hexes is interesting, because it also adds this layer of ‚Äòdo we really need to cleanse that? If it‚Äôs just Ruin, no probably not but there could be a hidden devour hope.‚Äô (I doubt most survivors would think this way since I still see people mindlessly cleanse any hex they see even if they should know it‚Äôs haunted grounds but eh.) 
---
You‚Äôve actually somewhat turned me to your side. I do like an idea to punish survivors for breaking the hex. But at the same time, I like having all five totems lit in meme builds which would no longer be possible lol. Even if it isn‚Äôt haunted grounds, a perk that somehow punishes survivors breaking hexes could be fun to play around with.
---
I said this is a thread a few weeks ago and I‚Äôll go ahead and say it again. But it‚Äôs really not about protecting rank at all and it‚Äôs not because I want ‚Äúeasy games‚Äù. It‚Äôs more-so deciding between taking the chance that the SWF you‚Äôre going against is a super sweaty and toxic group or the kind that just wants to hang out with friends and dick around and just the thought that it could be the first group makes me dodge if I‚Äôm just trying to chill and play the game and not put on billy with complete meta perks and insta saw. It was always for my own sanity and enjoyment that I would leave knowing that I‚Äôd get another lobby pretty quickly. 
---
Obviously with this system you just gotta take it on the chin unless you‚Äôre willing to look up everyone‚Äôs friends list every single game (I‚Äôm not) but if I‚Äôm getting into a lobby that has 4 toolboxes or it looks like they might all be about to run insta heals I‚Äôm still going to nope the fuck out the lobby unless I‚Äôm feeling quite sweaty that day or want the challenge. I know it sucks ass as survivor to wait forever to que because getting dodged, even as a solo, is just a complete waste of time and it happens multiple times a day for me when I play survivor but I want to enjoy my games and not have a 4 man d strike toolbox squad that makes me want punch a hole right in my monitor. And I know that‚Äôs a rare and extreme example but it‚Äôs groups like that that completely ruin it for other groups that aren‚Äôt like that. 
---
Darned Freddy and his frank mixtape
---
When you‚Äôve been in a chase for 5 minutes, but your 2 idiot teammates can‚Äôt pop your adrenaline in time because they‚Äôd rather heal sloppy butcher than work through thanataphobia. 
---
Adrenaline pops on hook, but they just hang around the exit gates.
---
Fucking wonderful.
---
Derp I do run that
---
Now these are the memes i come here for
---
You are supposed to eat human with Chili dude.
---
DBD: Live Action is looking great!
---
I know, right? And he didn't even get to tell us what it does.
---
Yep. The Legion are just a bunch of Hunter mains. Explains why it takes multiple hits to down someone.
---
I can only imagine he tried to fix it by diving at it head first
---
You're gonna need a crowbar...
---
not my voice btw (i know im bad)
---
I feel like it would be cooler if he looks up in horror and you hear Entity croaks. Either a freeze frame or cut to black cause this is probably a low budget film like all other Slashers lol.
---
Play as the Doctor, BBQ and Chili, Distressing, and a ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù Add-on (larger terror radius in treatment mode). I have easily collected 100k bloodpoints at the end of a solid game.
---
spirit annoys me so much 
---
Yeah no.
---
Well how about you just plain use BT and forget about Adrenaline at all? People like to farm anyway, so that would at least ease the pain my ass.
---
Playing injured is possible for sure, but from my experience most R5+ Killers have a pair of ears, thus making many situations unneccessarily complicated.
---
It's supposed to be this way. You survivors got the same  thing with gens. It hides the killers next move because that is what it's supposed to do.
---
I mean if we do it still is in spirits favour as you can't gen grab with a pig ambush, though silent ambushes at pallets would be pretty strong
---
I'd probably just suggest this add on makes it so the roar is at the end of the ambush instead of currently.
---
More like news for the Franklins killers. Now you are going to have less time to prep for items
---
sure I guess you can call it that
---
It‚Äôs usually Nurse for me. Unless you are talking about LFs with Sloppy then yeah they always have noed but that‚Äôs just cause they are a LF.
---
BAC
---
I use legion ALOT and gettig tired of using him because of all the DC‚Äôs
---
I would say either legion with BBQ or Doctor with BBQ. 
---
Legion you get more points overall due to maxing out deviousness and chase from his frenzy power. The issue is that due to the difficulty to actually down and hook someone with him without add-ons he can be a less secure way to gain points
---
Doctor gains a lot of points with his shock therapy. You have a higher chance of winning the game and getting a 4k as the doctor which will win you a lot of points. 
---
I would still say Legion though is the best for points. He is much harder to play and if you vs a talented team of survivors you are going to have a hard time hooking anyone.
---
Spirit advice;
---
- Use your power to mind-game survivors. When being looped stand still and see how the survivor reacts. Some survivors stop moving whereas others may abandon the loop. Some even walk towards you allowing you to get a free hit. If you see hem not moving or just walking then quickly change into spirit move then hit them. Since survivors cannot hear you phase while in your terror radius, they have to guess if you are. 
---
- Listen for survivor whimpers if you are using phase while chasing an injured survivor. Is a dead giveaway to their location.
---
- Watch videos of killers like tru3talent or fungoose play spirit. They both are really good with her. Im afraid I dont play sprit so I cant offer many tips with her. 
---
Her most powerful addon is the prayer beads though. The inability for a survivor to hear you phasing to them really does make the game much more difficult for survivor.
---
That would require me being GOOD with him in low ranks (8) and not be looped forever lol 
---
Dont really think it needs another buff. It kinda got a pseudo buff when the mending action came out
---
last time i got chased for this long they fixed 2 gens before i got hooked. then they came to unhook me while the killer was chasing them and i died.... &lt;.&lt;
---
yes sir it is
---
At what rank is this. Nice running the killer around but he definately ran the wrong way around that jungle gym.
---
Personally I think this would be more cute if Susie was the one who said fuck, but I like Huntress for this too.
---
I thought survivors could here me phase ? I know I can when I‚Äôm against her 
---
Robbie Rotten killer when?
---
Like the idea of that toxic haze perk. Sounds good for jumpscare myers
---
Fucking thank you, so many people I know shit on Freddy but don‚Äôt realize that he‚Äôs one of the best at map control and slow down, and even less seem to realize that Freddy is made substantially better if you don‚Äôt stomp around in tall grass.
---
My build is Ruin, BAC, Enduring, Spirit Fury or Bamboozle or something else that like.
---
They can hear you phase when outside your terror radius. They cannot hear you phase inside your terror radius hence mind games work really strong with spirit. 
---
With prayer beads, it removes the sound of phasing for all survivors even when they are not in your terror radius.
---
Well at least I earned 8K points...... 
---
\&gt;"My brother did it!"  
---
Lol  
---
\&gt;"I bypassed the ban by getting another account and got banned for no reason!"  
---
Double lol
