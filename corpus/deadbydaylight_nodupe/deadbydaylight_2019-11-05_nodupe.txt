Lmao I love that response.

"Well I didn't like that you took it off."
---
Piggy just wanted to give out festive party hats

---
Survivors shouldn't be able to bring keys to matchs and can't get it just in normal chests, but sure you can plunder it.
---
By running a cat5/6/7 cable from the router through the wall to the desktop?
---
I really think your misunderstanding what a router and modem do here my guy. A router, going through a cablebox to get your connection is not wifi at at any point.
---
That would make it feel far more grindy. I don't know why you'd think it would make it less grindy? Also is this idea just for survivors or do you agree killers "have" to use one of their own perks and fill the rest or can't teach them. I can't help but feel slightly angry about this idea lmao.   
---
As someone else said it would destroy a lot of creativity with builds in the game.
---
Can't stalk with the good mirror
---
just a random thought, isn’t the alchemist actually vigo?
---
My friend likes to use Better Together.
---
I made sure he'd stop using Better Together.
---
1 mistake?
---
You literally need to get smacked twice, hooked, get smacked for a 3rd maybe even 4th time if you're healed
---
You had 3-4 chances go get away my dude
---
Franklin's I choose you my boy
---
Then the Nea comes...
---
Because there are only three total survivor players at bhvr
---
Omg the brand new part and insta-heal just got nerfed. Leave SOMETHING for the survivors. Jeez.
---
Killers already have Ruin, Noed, Devour Hope and purple insta-kill add-ons. They're not hurting for perks. You just got to play them right.
---
Wouldn't say he's lost
---
I don’t see Claudette
---
Basically ***hard***
---
This comment, 100% my thought on it too.
---
Jokes aside Triple Jump would actually be a pretty legit perk. I could totally see it being reworked to be based on 4 / 3 / 2 tokens (based on level) for a faster vault.
---
I feel like I'm the only one old enough to get this reference
---
I can think for myself thank you.
---
.....gives me a reason to use him. He out of the rotation of killers I use now. Trapper. Hag and Pig or GF.  News flash. I also own all the killers. Imagine a person who does not main one killer and switches them out so I can enjoy all of them.  I imagine you being dipshit in IRL.
---
I can’t afford a pc so I have dbd on Switch. My friends play on pc so there are barely any games we can play together that are on both systems. I’ve been watching videos of dbd for years where youtubers and twitch streamers play with their friends and goof around in custom matches and I’ve always wanted that but it’ll never happen for me because I can’t afford a pc. Honestly, I don’t think it would ruin the game either if players can choose to play cross console or not. Even if it’s just enabled for custom matches, that would be fantastic. If the community still wanted it after custom matches and there weren’t any major issues, then ranked matches should be enabled also. I hope that sometime in the future they enable this because I just want to play with my friends.
---
Sorry for the long rant. Well done with the meme!
---
Absolutely. Wake up too, sorta
---
The only way to nerf swf is to add comms for everyone, as an ingame option, add queue according to the language u speak, so u can actually communicate in the game, make pipping for survivors much much harder so potatos wont be able to get to rank 1(its a buff for solo queue rank 1 survivors), cause right now theres no defined skill for rank 1 survivors, there are lots of very sweaty players and lots of potatos and u cant balance the game around rank 1.  then u compensate those changes for killers. 
---
Its a very bad change cause u have to rebalance almost every aspect of the game and some killers suffer from communication much more than the others.
---
 As for me the current system is pretty fair, u can just play spirit or ghostface and just dont bother about swf.
---
Jeff looks a lot older than 20 to me.
---
Personally I think both BBQ and WGLF should be reworked completely. 
---
With how many killers and survivors we have in this game already, it is quite a grind especially for newer players or people who have not been playing since the start and gradually levelled survivors. So IMO both the BBQ and WGLF Bloodpoint bonus should be added into the game *by default.* 
---
It really sucks to have to run BBQ if I want good BP gainst on Killer and limiting my perk slots, and it really sucks having to run WGLF otherwise Survivor BP gains are really bad. Both of these bonuses and the conditions to activate them are healthy for the game, they promote non-camping, non-tunelling playstyle and altruistic actions from Survivors. 
---
BBQ can then stay an aura perk and WGLF can get a rework.
---
He's been my killer main since he came out. I always felt he was strong, but now people seem to be seeing what I saw when I picked him up
---
**Is this an out of season April Fool's joke?**
---
He already has a killer-styled name, looks like a hulking guy, and while similar to the trapper, he still manages to go in a very different direction. Plus, that guy was pretty scary in 8mm
---
I think they all get that but the issue is just PC vs console a PC player has an advantage on the console player do to graphics input lag and just overall experience with some games it's not a bad idea but could overall make some people leave and yeah you could just turn it off but depending on how you do it you could restrict some people from playing with others
---
As someone who played in the vanilla experiment as survivor I can tell you right now - survivors won almost 90% of the time. I think I died in literally one or two games I played as survivor, it was THAT bad. One of the biggest reasons I could identify as to why this was is because a lot of the survivor gameplay is playing around/ guessing what perks a killer has. Not having to worry about nurse's/ bbq/ ruin etc meant that the gens flew by without pressure.
---
And on to my last point - not having to worry about NOED was what sped the game up significantly. As much as I hate going down to NOED and I think it's cheap, I saw why its existence was necessary in the vanilla experiment. It's something that passively slows the game down even if people don't use it.

Yea bro, map pressure is you patrolling the gens as a killer.  Certain killers have better map pressure than others. To name a few, The Nurse because of her blink, Freddy because of teleportation, The Spirit because of her disappearing, The Hillbilly be ause of his chainsaw and run, The Demogorgon because of his... guess you can call it teleportation/traveling. Their special powers help to get them where you need to be for protection. So it could give survivors a real hard time.

Those easy AF skillchecks certainly are scary

Thanks much! And I understand your pain brother. However, have you tried rocket league? If that's on switch like I think it is, Rocket League has full crossplay functionality. That's what I currently play with my buds on PC.

ok zoomers

Thanks for the advice! I’ll check it out!

PS4 and I believe all platforms: Calm spirit negates the hook pause when first placed and immediately starts the timer. (Calm spirit negates the scream while on hook which shaves off around 4 seconds on the hook in total)

And other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself
---
Why haddonfield tho? they were saying they got Shelter woods with BL which is one of the maps with the fewest balanced landing spots (no hill tiles can spawn)
---
Thank you
---
Just highlight all 5 totems on the map and the killer can choose one of them to be lit up by looking at it and press the control button just like freddy/demo teleports to his gens/buttholes.
---
The perk is not active until the totem(s) are chosen.
---
Finally, some people are so compelled to say the story and lore are good when it's pretty mediocre.
---
Didn't one of Ash's perks do that already? I can't remember what its called Buckle Up I think? Doesn't it do something like that?
---
There is a perk like that. It’s called Buckle Up and it’s a unique Ash perk. It allows you to determine how far they have recovered by the intensity of their aura.
---
Right yea I'm not denying the inherent advantage of PC, but every single game that has ever implemented crossplay that I'm aware of has an option to toggle it on or off. I think most even have it off by default. There's no downside if it's optional. If you didn't want to use it, then you'd have the same matchmaking you have now, if you turned it on, then you'd have a much wider playerbase to match with/against. I don't really see the negatives for either side. If console players don't enjoy the extra challenge then they can just press one button and it's like nothing ever changed.
---
Where is the sound ? :(
---
You smell like a salty survivor main, actually you reek of it
---
I mean without the key same results would've happened, problem is they were too bad to even get value out of it, but mediocre survivors who would normally get killed at 3 gens in could just get 2 escapes
---
Steve could lose everything he cares about, get the ever loving shit kicked out of him and still somehow show up and kick some mythical creature's ass cause it looked at one of his friends funny.
---
What do you think?
---
As a dbd streamer I fully supportcross play!! Auicker lobbies means more games means more bp and more fun!!! I'd hate that xbox ps4 and switch couldnt talk to me after match but I guess they could join the stream!
---
She legit bugged out on the hook. At first I was like, “what a dick move!”
---
I'm going to give up now. Qs for killer take wayyyy too long. And I always get killer dailies.
---
But then you could literally just infitnitely counter moris, which would be ridiculous. It should be one time use. I really like both the other perks though.
---
I LOVE JERSEY SHORE DEAD BY DAYLIGHT CROSSOVERS. This gives me life. Thank you.
---
I want the serum to be aquired through blighted generators giving the generators and the event a purpose other than some bloodpoints.
---
Scoob!
---
Seems about right
---
Keep leveling it.
---
This was super helpful! Thanks
---
&gt; so I have to play another game to get 1/6 piece of the completion bar
---
And then the remainder gets added to the next bar.
---
^ the people who've seen it
---
To what level?
---
just keep leveling, eventually it will show up
---
the spirit
---
this is cool
---
&gt;To what level?
---
Until you get it.
---
YES, LITERALLY EVERYONE WHO DOES ALL THE CHALLENGES ON THE FIRST WEB WILL SEE THE 4TH LEVEL
---
Those 2 DLCs are paired up with the console's Special edition, which is the only console release version. There is no base game for console. Lullaby of the Dark is a free dlc for all platforms that isn't included in the base game, requiring a download from the platform's marketplace.
---
Ok thanks!
---
I have had too many swf who came to fight, fly through gens in 4 minutes, all to stroke their ego say gg at the end and it just feels... insincere and sarcastic.
---
I just keep my chat window closed unless it was a legit fun game and I know the players are gonna be cool to talk to.
---
It’s RNG. Basically you bought the possibility that it will show up, you can get lucky and get it right away or get it last
---
While it’s never been confirmed by the devs or in game, the Survivor’s Blight cosmetics may hint at that. Alternatively I believe the Alchemist left his notes and Vigo found them, so whatever time is present in the lore is when Vigo and other survivors were learning about the Blight (Like Dwight, Claudette, and Jake), but I’m going off of memory from a QnA I honestly couldn’t say for sure
---
 Yes but it was really weird, the killer had to leave the game because it did not end ...
---
They’re trolling... I hope
---
Not necessarily, I had a game of slowdown Freddy where everyone was injured and on death hook, I had 7 stacks of DL, no gens had been worked on...and they left with a key
---
And if Behaviour did it properly maybe they could implement some form or fashion of end game chat across the platforms! I'm assuming it would be difficult, but I think it's possible with some crossplay chat functions rocket league has. Sorry to rope you in with everyone on the meme! xD
---
I wouldn’t play any other killer if I had this
---
This is clearly someone's diarrhea.
---
I don't like it. Sounds like you get free information on where the survivors are when one highlight disappears.
---
Wow I leveled my hillbilly to level 27 (from level 1)and still haven’t got it looks like I’m getting the latter
---
Still works on Xbox, unless there was an update last night
---
I think it's dirty on Ghostface personally. Usually by the time you get close enough to hit them they're on their way to somewhere safe since you have a terror radius.
---
I assume its a way to prevent boosting or sorts. if a killer can get a 4k in 3 minutes, then the team probably bad, hence why they got killed.
---
Same goes for survivor. If they can get the gens done without the killer getting any downs, the killer wasn't good enough and was too easy, hence no pip.
---
Both are flawed though, as killers can run OP shit and just have everyone DC, and the survivors can just gen rush in 5 minutes and adrenaline out.
---
Also, I tried to look up your stream but to no avail. What's your streamer name?
---
I will mori you
---
did you happen to get this guys username?
---
I don’t think he is offended just tired of the same meme
---
Ketamine Shugoki? You’re here too?
---
UwU please mori me Daddy
---
You should do what I do. After one sacrifice, if a bear trap is ticking I block a box. We'll play a game of 'is this your box? If so you're dead'.
---
3/4ths of the time they will D/C.
---
There are no plans right now AFAIK, and old legion was horrible for the game.
---
I think it's used better here than in most situations. I know I'm explaining the joke, but I like that the meme's caption is same as the bloodpoint scoring event verbatim. Usually it's not that explicit, which gave me a sharp nose exhale.
---
Just finished a game on The Family Residence (Spirit map) and there was a hex totem nearby the main building that was behind some debris and it was unable to be cleansed. Both my friend and I couldn’t cleanse it and we had to just power through the Ruin. This was on Xbox if that matters.
---
I mean to be fair I only play survivor so I am definitely biased. 
---
Infinitely countering Mori's isn't too bad in my opinion, the killer would just have to hook you two more times as if they didn't have a Mori. This would be powerful but considering it takes up a perk slot and is VERY situational I don't think it would be overpowered. 
---
If it was only one-time use you would probably be downed quickly and then Mori'd anyway. And considering how situational it is to begin with, I really don't think it would be worth the perk slot.
---
The killer was using an addon called "Iridescent Stone" which causes any survivor that disarms or sabotages their trap to go from the healthy state to the injured state. You can not go from the injured state to the dying state like this though.
---
Console? Because that’s my issue, it’s just invisible unless you’re both standing a foot from eachother and memeing
---
Ace "Fidel Castro" Visconti
---
This is like telling someone to walk their trash to the trash can instead of throwing it. It's gonna happen either way, changing the literal method doesn't make any real difference. Challenge or gens, you get serum for cosmetics. Now, whether that's more or less, that's worth talking about, but the minor distinction in how it's acquired isn't.
---
They’re literally tunneling
---
TOO MANY COOKS, ToOoOoO MANY COOKS
---
Bruh not the shit up
---
best meme
---
This is an old picture
---
That means that the survivor that unhooked you did a bad play is all. They shouldnt of unhooked you unless they knew he was on someone else or he should of taken the hit.
---
I clicked the mood music and was not disappointed. If LF was wearing headphones I really hope that'd be what he was listening to.

My issue with the Spirit is OP argument is that even if they need spirit into the ground a new OP killer is going to rise up and then be nerfed because of shitty survivors complaining about them. This cycle will just keep going until no killer stands any chance. The game should be challenging on both sides
---
Thanks. I don't own Ash, so I forgot.
---
iirc they said they plan to rework him again but was no timeframe.
---
Is it tunneling? Ive never playded as demo but from i see by playing against them when they go into the upside down they take forever to come out. I get in theory that they are immediately coming back to the hook after an unhook which is typically someone trying to tunnel the injured survivor, but with the amount of time that it typically takes to travel through portals i personally feel like it's a fair enough.
---
Add flashlight clicks and you've earned yourself a facecamp
---
no
---
It's because most gamers aren't funny and simply observe others laughing at something that is supposed to be funny, then steal that joke and repeat it ad nauseam.
---
It might make it easier, but would the devs go to such lengths just to sell cosmetics when they could sell...other cosmetics?
---
I read the post. That's why I included, he was visiting his hometown when Legion commissioned the mural.
---
Pretty much the reason I took it off.
---
Steam has been a bit broken recently and some really common achievements have gone to very low completion rate, so something similar might be happening here.
---
it’s not modifying the game so the developers have no reason to ban you.
---
but like, then people trying to VC with randoms get fucked over, and I don't want to be *that* guy.
---
What do you mean, "how?"
---
I seriously love this clip.  Not just for the ridiculous symbiote-possessed acting, but because it's fucking Shocker of all people that Spider-Man is completely raging out at.  Not Green Goblin, not Kraven the Hunter, not anyone who actually has a personal beef with Spider-Man or is even an actually bad person, but Shocker.  The guy who is literally just a petty bank robber with a college degree and way too much free time on his hands.  It's like Superman going full Injustice finishing move on Condiment King.  It's hilarious.  And also the perfect metaphor for online gaming rage.
---
It’s a addon and you played that badly anyways.
---
Personally I hate both perks. 
---
Adrenaline for being a spit in your face while youre chasing a survivors and the last gen pops. Yes its their reward for completing the objective, but hey, im here trying to complete my objective too and you just sprintburst to Africa from me being healed, like «lets go for round two, loser». I dont have time for round two anymore. 
---
NOED for being an ez unfair win for a killer who didnt do well during the match and is chilling in the endgame. It just hurts to be punished like this for doing your job. It shouldn't be only because survivors didnt cleanse one damn totem that is sometimes unreal to find, especially if youre not connected and cant really keep track on their number. Its as much a spit in the face as adrenaline is. 
---
I play both sides equally and never ever use those filthy perks because I know what a pleasure it is to come across them.
---
Pig's ambush counts as a normal attack for STBFL now, doesn't it? It was patched out IIRC.
---
I think that's specific to Vigo, though. I think most survivors and killers are given their specific role that they stick to, though somewhere in the lore, it's specified that the entity might offer the survivors a chance to switch over (permanently or temporarily) if they're getting hopeless, as a sort of relief.
---
I kind of want Vigo to be in the game, as both a survivor AND a killer, just at different stages of being in the entity's realm. There's already timey wimey shenanigans happening (Killers + survivors from all sorts of eras, multiple of the same survivor in a trial) so would be a neat nod.
---
Why, so you can dodge the lobby?
---
How do you sarcastically say gg
---
Especially at low ranks
---
Y know sometimes I’m trying to hide from a Myers stalking me or from a ghostface, or trying to dodge a hatchet, or trying to avoid falling on a trap, crouching is a useful thing to do as a survivor, it’s not toxic
---
If I don't move she can take phase and come directly me, or hear my breathing/injured noises. Walking doesn't work when she can hear my breathing and injured sounds, sparkling legit does nothing but tell you when you are gonna die, slow vaulting can only work so many times, she can see you're scratch marks.
---
She can see everything while using her power dumbass, just bc you can't see the survivor doesn't mean you have no idea where they are, all of you're "counters" you listed can be beaten by one thing, headphones.
---
But there's no co-op Killer mode, so if you want to play with friends, it has to be as Survivor.
---
*High IQ*
---
😂😂😂
---
Travelling doesnt take that long, if you wanna tunnel as a demo you can easily do it and theres nothing the hooked survivor can do against.
---
I dont see a lot of killers doing that, so it doesnt seem to be a big problem.
---
Thanks!
---
I probably sound abit hostile but this is like the 10th time it happened.
---
I think I was the survivor.  I was confused af.
---
Wut??
---
The 90s Spider-Man cartoon was the shit.
---
I've only gotten a key escape once in the last few months, but damn if it isn't frustrating
---
Outplayed
---
Because thats all I face lol
---
youre  a "i love when people send me hatemail so i can be a dickhead and pretend it's them not me" kinda guy huh
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
His sentences gave me a stroke. 
---
He told you to be quite but if he wanted you to be quiet he would shut up himself. 
---
Idiots mate.
---
I always sorta saw it as we the players are trapped in the game, and l we control the characters actions by inhabiting their bodies, which is why there can be multiple of a single survivor, multiple consciousnesses inhabiting the same meatsacks, and why players can switch between survivor and killer. However according to Vigo we shouldn’t be able to switch at will, the entity decides who we play as, but of course for the sake of gameplay we get the choice
---
No, so I can smack them out of their hands. I don’t like bothering with Franklins unless I see at least three items.
---
I mean the issue is that survivors can be really shitty and not go unhook you, which is the exact reason I bring it
---
Spine chill is good for Spirit, Myers, Ghostface,Pig, and Wraithe. Quick and quiet is good for every killer, dance with me is good for every killer. I'm just trying to help man. If you don't want to take perks that can help you against Spirit then don't. Just quit complaining when she wrecks your face lol. The are already talking about nerfing her what more do you want?
---
Yup
---
Not so much on billy or huntress, as the whole point of their ability is to avoid M1
---
"Git gud noob lmao get rekt kid"
---
then turn them off when you play killer and turn them on when you play surv?
---
So Toadette with Peach crown is Peachette.
---
Boo with Peach crown would be... Peachoo. Peachoo... [Pichu](https://www.smashbros.com/assets_v2/img/fighter/pichu/main.png).
---
Which are free cos the best Blendette cosmetic is her P3
---
As a killer player, I personally apologize for all those people doing to you, but not all killers try to be that type.
---
Only when he moves. I kinda want to try just waiting at a locker and opening it when they get near to fuck with them now.
---
12/10 on the meme format!
---
Spoiler most of this community probably uses mediocre headphones that are no fucking help when playing spirit besides bass boosting a vacuum
---
Scratch marks are delayed a little and the spirit also moves grass
---
It pisses me off how big of a fuss people make over this stuff. Pig traps suck to begin with. Sometimes I'll get trapped a second time and think "aw shit, round two", but I never thought it as toxic.
---
These cosmetics are not handed to you. You earn them or buy them. If you pay you essentially skip the grind. Does this confuse you?
---
You can to tier 2
---
No I don't struggle against spirit because I run spine chill and play stealthy. If they can't find you they can't kill you. But I'm only at rank 5 survivor right now, maybe it gets harder. You don't run a perk because you encounter something every game. You run a perk in case you encounter it. Same idea as running decisive. You don't get tunneled every game, but if you do you have a perk to help you out.
---
Try and get 2 perks per bloodweb if you can.  It'll increase the odds of you finding the perk you're looking for.
---
It would be incredibly easy to finish it you where she to do it in kyf. The long is to be a challenge
---
I don't disagree. The grind is so very real.
---
white text on a white background
---
yikes
---
That's literally impossible.
---
If no gens have been worked on, the hatch doesn't spawn until there is one survivor remaining, and it spawns open. For 4 survivors to escape with a key, 5 gens must be complete.
---
And that’s why Steve belongs on the list of harasses.
---
Gotcha. Okay, thanks. I'll have to pay more attention to that!
---
3 survivors were left
---
Ur thinking of scratched mirror
---
Killer Rule #13 clearly states if you have OoO you will be camped hard.
---
 Its like when a rescue happens and the unhooked survivor gets between you and the rescuer because they have DS. You eat the DS and rehook, its not tunneling if they asked for it.
---
Yep and the cycle dreadfully repeats. Unless...you pay with real money. Dun dun dun. Maybe thats the true horror of their halloween event.
---
thats it, im getting me mallet
---
Yeah and do these killers know how to apply pressure without ruin doing it 100 percent for them? 9 out of 10 times I play a spirit, shes using ruin. She doesnt need it at all. But the vast majority of killer mains will tell me she does. I'm convinced most killers dont even take the time to learn map pressure bc ruin is such a passive crutch. 
---
I'd much prefer they tone down perks and rework maps accordingly. They are just too game changing and it's annoying.
---
Post this on the doodoo forums
---
OwO beat my head in. While your at it, eat me whole and be my vore daddy UwU (I'm so sorry)
---
Hope would need all of No One Left Behind added to it to be usable. Adrenaline is actually meta.
---
Shit meme please your brain. You shouldn’t have to verse PC players in any semi competitive game. And this game doesn’t have a big enough playerbase for you to be able to opt out of crossplay.
---
Lithe is still good, but there's a lot of weird situations with it:
---
- It activates after you've already used something that gives distance, and that alone SHOULD have been sufficient, meaning the speed boost gets wasted if you stick in the same area.
---
- Sometimes you'll want to make use of the speed boost anyway, and actually you'll end up running somewhere LESS safe, because you wanted to use the speed boost.
---
- If it wasn't sufficient enough, it was probably an unsafe vault anyway, and you may end up getting hit even with Lithe
---
- There are some situations where Lithe can make you break chase entirely, usually when the killer is forced to vault to follow you, but those places are usually very strong to stay in to waste the killer's time
---
- This is a different story when combined with Dance With Me (and even Quick And Quiet) which can very consistently allow you to drop chases, but then we're comparing 2/3 perks to 1, and also sometimes wasting the killer's time in a chase is what you want.
---
BL is less consistent map-wise, but opens up another avenue to create distance that you didn't have before, meaning that the speed boost will likely never be wasted if you manage to use it.
---
I still run them about the same, but I tend to find I "waste" Lithe quite often when I do take it.
---
A random edgy version of Mario from a creepypasta
---
Pwyf Wraith is a strange thing for new players.
---
Like. Your chasing me and but not hitting me then running away? What. Then suddenly hes running 600 miles an hour.
---
Ironically, survs towards survs can be saltier than killers on survs.
---
Good survivors outplay bubba no matter what add ons you run. He's literally the worst killer in the game. In fact, if he did get a 4k, he would have had to seriously outplay them. Go complain about something true like how busted Spirit is.
---
I'm sure they will make some changes to her soon, I'm not so short sighted as to say she couldn't use some changes. See you in the fog :)
---
I’m kind of legit mad that this will never happen. It would be such a fun idea. His power could be to effect you with a growing title card of your name that would get brighter and brighter.
---
I'm pretty sure it does nothing.
---
Any killers randomly get booted for no reason tho?
---
Really? All the killers I go against (try to) match the highest rank in the group.
---
1) You replied to a comment about 4 survivors escaping.
---
And
---
2) Still impossible. For the hatch to spawn with 3 survivors alive, 4 generators must be complete.
---
Perhaps i should of took a second look
---
The puppet's name is Billy. The mastermind's name is jigsaw
---
Nea’s mori: I will shit nea out of my ass and she will mori the killer.
---
Dedicated servers are on. That's not the killers internet
---
The only justification for deranking is to train a new player in SWF, and even then, you'd better offer yourself to the baby Killers you style on after if you get too sweaty.
---
Why would they put a perk in the game called insidious, where you have to stand still to active it if they didn't want you to camp a bit here and there.
---
Yep. Can't remember if they at least had their one perk or not though
---
That's like saying "since we have polio we should also have measles". How about we fix them *both* instead of staying miserable.
---
Because that's worked out so well thus far.. and we should give them three more years in the hopes of it working out better..
---
The devs have proven to be incompetent for totem placement. Trusting them to improve it enough to actually be effective is insanity. 
---
The killer should control where their totems are placed. The killer knows a good spot when he/she sees it. The devs CLEARLY do not.
---
again it depends on the pings on both sides.
---
I dont have an account so you can post it there if you like, just make sure to link it here.
---
There was 1 gen left but none of the 3 were worked on, I’m just stupid with words
---
It would appear someone doesn't play both sides and thus does not understand core game mechanics for both sides.
---
Poor guy.
---
Little confused? Did you make a whole outfit or...?
---
That actually made me lol irl, good job
---

---
My account got banned about 2 months ago for criticizing devs

"Leave SOMETHING overpowered and unfair!"
---
Same! I was hella confused
---
Yeah but the whole point of adding this mode would be to separate casual from "competitive"
---
I was solo so for whatever reason matchmaking put me where I didn't belong
---
You right.
---
You clearly don’t understand that killers don’t have enough time as is.
---
That's sort of like saying "the killer brought a mori so we just didn't get hooked." Nobody is going to be able to keep the gens at 5 realistically at any high rank.
---
SWFs now matchmake at the highest rank above them and the Rift means more people are playing Killer, so with a 1:4 ratio needed, Killers have extremely long lobbies. Even then, though, an hour is insane. I've heard up to 30 minutes.
---
I feel like this subreddit peaked when that one guy was making a new meme format with dbd characters every day. Zombie hugger or something like that. Those were outstanding.
---
hahah i'd say try it xD to bad i can't test it out for you.
---
Found out what's in Susie's Mixtape
---
You have 64 days to grind for them and another 2 weeks to decide what to buy if you haven't.
---
Map RNG is part of the game design at this point. There's some maps that are just really survivor sided and others that are killer sided.
---
Heck, your specific killer choice/opponent can luck into bad/good maps for them too. I played Doctor for a daily earlier today, and rolled into The Game (without using offerings), and then 2 games later I did a Myers game for another daily, and rolled Rotten Fields.
---
Yeah I do solo as well. I get put with single digit ranks (I'm nowhere near that good) and the killer is always close to their rank. Weird.
---
Nope its confirmed real.  I got this glitch after completing my level 1 challenge set myself
---
It was funny when at first with pennywise because that's how the argument felt. Then it got funnier with a guy drawing the characters like trapper meg,claud,etc as the meme. Anymore after it got stale.
---
It just really is that rare
---

---
DS can be used in many ways if you know what you are doing. DS can be force used by jumping into a locker, it can be combed with 
---
unbreakable to be invincible, Spinechill can be used to vault faster ig, but thats so minuscule that its not worth a perk slot unless you base your entire kit around it. 
---
If you still call dbd a horror game you dont know what you are talking about.
---
I am "bitching" about spirit bc there is no counter play at all. Listing perks and scratch marks is a flimsy argument and i have yet to hear anything but those 2 things come from people like you when they say spirit is balanced.
---
you cant run, she sees you, you cant walk, she hears you, you cant bring iron will bc a good spirit or a spirit with stridor can still find you easily, you cant loop bc you have no idea where she is or if she is even using your power.
---
Spine chill "Counters" one thing with spirit, congrats you now know when you are going to die. What are you going to do when the spirit realizes you dont fall for the standing still mind game? 
---
Lets say you are on one side of a pallet, and the spirit begins to phase. What do you do?
---
Yup, sounds like every Ghostface I've ever met...
---
No I mean the devs. I got that glitch too. I hope it was intentional just to fuck with us
---
I can also confirm it worked for me on day 1 of the rift being out
---
If they did, you can no longer use hooked teammates' bodies to block hits, making it a minor Killer buff. Even better, farmer punishment.
---
Favorite perk, so nutty on Hag.
---
it matches up with a leak from ptb where people saw all 4 levels of challenges so i think this is real
---
This guy probably disconnects because dying is delusional
---
This is just a "but what about" argument, just because moris are broken doesn't mean keys aren't
---
Its either an Xbox thing, or a non-OCE thing.
---
Not on console
---
Yikes
---
There is just an inherit division between people who play survivor and people who play killer. They both have different wants and needs from the game and it conflicts and causes tension that escalates.
---
well it depends on the match. The Entity prefers the killer hook survivors multiple times and ultimately sacrifice them and inversely the survivors actually attempt to escape and not just let themselves get caught and die. The killer is punished if they let the survivor straight up die by either letting them bleed out or killing them outright.
---
I changed my name to LiterallyToxic after a trapper face camped in basement with insidious. It’s infectious. Once I saw it from killers I took it back out on them. But spamming messages is child’s play, immature IMO. Once games over then leave and be done.
---
If that had ever happened to me, literally even once I would agree with you. So the spirit stood at a dropped pallet, phased completely, looked away from me for a second or two and then unphased on the same side of the pallet? I'm not saying it's impossible but I've been playing this game for a long time and I have never once had that happen. What is much much more likely is the spirit will fake phase or will phase to the other side of the pallet to check for collision. I think you have worked her up to be this boogeyman that she isnt. If you are going against a spirit who is that good then they would probably kill you regardless of who they play.
---
Um...Nurse and Huntress aren't base-game.
---
Bringing a red key is like bringing a red mori, There’s no shame losing to that.
---
I second this
---
but 2 escaping the hatch is quite easy
---
Moris are equivalent to input drops on second hook, although Survivors can sometimes die on their first hook. The Killer still has to catch the person twice.
---
Keys are instant wins tied to a location the Killer will lose if they try to defend while also applying pressure.
---
Who goes into a match as killer and immediately begins looking at the sky?
---
All the balanced landing games out there: *Haddonfield offering time yall*

You just have to memorize which ones have been used that's about it

Blessed now, this subreddit has become.

you do you man, just don't expect people to be helpful 😊😊
---
Literally $20 DLC easy from me.
---
God that naming convention is so weird. Peachette is a combination of Peach &amp; Toadette, so she got the name that combines their two different names.
---
Bowsette is a combination of Peach and Bowser, so her name is... a combination of Bowser and Toadette? and now Boosette? oh lad
---
I didn't know the Demogorgon played DBD
---
I mean i also havent been trying either. Ive been running a item finding build to get up my items on my ace.
---
You can play on all maps regardless of the dlc you own
---
Eh. Mostly Ghostface, Legion, Freddy and Hag with others thrown in occasionally
---
I don't think this is just a dedicated servers thing. I'm playing on ps4 and even against a killer with green ping I have been getting these horrible lag spikes when they use their power or swing at a survivor.
---
Say what now?, How come I dont get these survivors when I'm playing ghostface
---
Oh right, green ranks
---
Cool thanks, I was wondering cause I got the preschool map like five time but no other maps like it
---
Ok
---
Yeah, it should be Peacher and Peachoo by the original formula, but Bowsette's charisma was so powerful that now she's the ringleader here.
---
&gt; Its not paytowin
---
I agree.
---
Got nothing to do with them attacking, you genuinely lag around and get stuck on invisible walls now, you get lagged back through windows and vaults, its a dedicated server issue. No idea what your issue is.
---
Lmao suzie gang just got a nice mask
---
If a good spirit plays a character that is actually counterable and interactive then im fine with dying. 
---
You have no way of knowing where the spirit is or what she is doing, you are obi not good if you honestly think being rank 5 means you are "Doing somthing right". The ranking system is easy, if you are only rank 5 after playing for a long time, then like... that kinda just tells people you have no idea what you are doing
---
First? lmao i have posted this 3 times so far and never gotten anything from it.
---
I think it depends. If you have the skill of a rank 8 but managed to get lucky and have some great games and get to rank 4 and it's way too toxic, dropping back to around ranks 6-8 is kinda ok. Still wouldn't advise it, it's good practice
---
That's why, even when I do lose, I try to send a nice message instead.
---
Thanks
---
Wow so I’m not the only one who has thought this while playing the game...
---
If someone tries to bodyblock while you are carrying a survivor to the hook don't swing unless you are 100 percent sure you will hit. If someone has just been unhooked and jumps into a locker they are baiting you to pick them up so they can decisive strike you. And the biggest top-notch USE HEADPHONES. You can hear survivors breathing and footsteps, you can use this to track a survivor even after they have blinded you.
---
Is there something wrong with your eyes?
---
I honestly should record myself playing, the decisions I make are so questionable. As long as we can laugh at ourselves, we’re doing alright!
---
It was fun and games were still winnable. So everyone, everyone could blame them.
---
Is fire up really weak? I never tried it but it seems pretty negligible imo
---
You had to escape to get all the serum though, it was well balanced.
---
All maps are playable without DLC. The only thing that DLCs unlock is the characters specifically.
---
Just take the L
---
Yoink
---
If the killer take out one survivor quickly and win based on that, then it is a successful strategy for the killer. It is the survivors job to don’t let their teammates die so quickly. It is like if you are playing a traditional pvp game and complain “they always kill our healer first, such bad sport tunneliers”. No, it is survivors job to protect their teammates if they are on last hook.
---
Learn tile and pallet spawns, knowing where to avoid is key.

That is pretty amazing. lol
---
How is it like a Mori? Please elaborate. 
---
Bc for the key to actually work, 1) get some gens done. 2) be the lone survivor 
---
Meanwhile with mori(s) all needed is a hooked survivor. It stunts the opposing side more compared to a key.
---
Oh, but the probability isn't so simple! Survivors tend to spawn and work together, so any time you see 2 survivors in the same place it's 50%!

"toxin that gives survivors the shits. Can smell shitty survivors"
---
Me and my buds accidentally made a streamer get mad at use and threaten to use a Mori against us because we got unlucky and queued up against her twice and we key escaped.

My friend unboxed a pink key both those games and used it to help 2 people escape, robbing the killer of 2 kills.

My main david
---
I agree. Because SOME of them it hurts their ego. SOME are embarrassed their SWF just seen them get owned. SOME feel that it's everyone but their fault they got hooked. Did you ever ask a person why they DCed? I did and it's always a fault with other players or legit want to screw the killer over.  Toxic players by definition. They see the killer as not a other player playing their role but a person who is upsetting them.  Misery loves company. Reply to every message AHAHAHA. Project that shit right back if you must.  Honestly I don't read anything anymore. Unless I see GG then I leave.  Even if the killer camps me or tunnels I don't care. I'm not going to tell them what to do or waste my time. Some days I don't know why I play this game.  In my opinion this game breeds bad behavior or way too much us vs them.
---
Balanced Landing is almost OP on that map considering the fact that two or three gens are either on a second floor or right next to the stairs. You can get several gens done without being hit once. But that balances (pun unintended) out with the nearly zero BL spots on certain maps. I wouldn't say simply using BL on Lampkin Lane is toxic, but having a four-man SWF that all bring it and burn Lampkin offerings is toxic.
---
It's not cocky to do an unhook near the killer when you have Borrowed Time, it's just playing the game normally.  Them not guessing you didn't click the right perk button for the situation before the match doesn't make them dumb either.
---
Y'all really just posted this after deleting my tier list for this rule. I feel like that one kid who gets the whole class in trouble
---
I just faxed a non-camping SPEED LIMITER bubs. Get his scrub 😋
---
It’s funny how people use “X bad” to criticize people who circlejerk or repeat things but this thread has multiple SPiRit bAD comments
---
To use a mori you need to get a hook, and then down a survivor again. This is just playing normally, but you get to completely end a survivor, or worse, all survivors, once they've been hooked a single time. You don't have to play any differently or do anything special, you just prematurely finish someone off.
---
To use a key, you have to get enough gens for the number of survivors in a map, meaning you either need to survive long enough that you're one of, if not the last person, or you need to do all or almost all of the gens, either way, it's far from simple, and FAR from "instant win."
---
Then you have to find the hatch, which is really NOT easy when it's closed. Survivors, unlike killers, can't just walk around all over the map anywhere, seeing all over the ground without consequences. You have to play a very specific way around the map, and while searching for something, you give up a lot of information about yourself, or.. you're not working on the objectives. So you either have to play really weird, searching around locations you shouldn't be, or you have to actively not be helping your group once the time comes. Your chances of getting caught while searching are very high.
---
On top of all of this, if you bring the key in, the killer can see it in the lobby and choose to tunnel, or use franklins, completely denying the key's usage.
---
Anyone who thinks these two things are the same is absurd. Key's are fun mechanics that should maybe only exist in chests, that allow for an escape that might otherwise be extremely hard to get. If anything mori's are far far far closer to an "instant win" if we're going to be in any way reasonable.
---
Tapper, too. He has a holster. Actually, doesn't Meg's L4D skin have one, too?
---
You can use it on the tree in the middle and the basement stairs in the shack.
---
I quit this game like 5-6 months ago because the toxicity just got to be too much for me. I'm finally getting back into it after Stranger Things and it seem not much has changed, if anything it's gotten worse
---
I can already see the title: "Game Over"
---
“You’re a pussy bitch and you’re lucky you made it out alive.”
---
Learn the difference between safe /unsafe/ ultra safe pallets. Gauge how the survivor you are going against reacts and adjust accordingly. Some will camp pallets and run after they drop it, some will play around a pallet to varying degrees of skill and success. Learn who you can trick by mind gaming and who is better to kick it and move to the next loop or drop the chase entirely.
---
When you say win in a video game context, it implies I pay, and this will make me win the game. Paying to win cosmetics isnt winning. It's just getting cosmetics. It's the exact same fucking thing as buying an item in the store you just have to actually earn it. Or you dont. Because it doesnt matter. It's just cosmetic. Therefore it's not pay to win. Its pay to participate. Because you dont win. You just get something that you may or may not want.
---
I'll say this again. In case you missed it. please take the time to process it. Buying a skin in the store is not winning. It's a skin. You paid for it to look fancy. All it does is feed into your vanity. That's the exact same fucking thing that the rift and battlepass's and all this shit people complain about is. It offers no advantage to a video game and is only there to make you look cool than your friends and random people you complain to online. One last time. You do not have to do ANY of this to enjoy the game. The archives is there for challenges and you do this for free. I'm going about my happy ass way not buying this rift. I just dont care about it. It's just fucking skins. That's literally all this shit would provide. Its pay to participate. Not pay to win.
---
If you dont like it, dont buy it. It does nothing to hinder your game experience unless you are just an incredibly vain player who has to look fancy to which then I feel sorry for you.
---
Nerf the damn things
---
I feel like the main point of killer isn’t to get kills insanely fast, but to entertain the entity by toying with the survivors for as long as possible before killing them
---
gg
---
He's alright. The killer that is suprisingly good on console, at least far better than they are on PC, is Leatherface.

Tips differ from killer to killer but for general tips:
---
1: don’t rely on perks to win the game for you
---
-don’t rely on ruin and NOED to win the game for you, using them is fine but you have to be able to play without them.
---
2: limit yourself to 2 hexes
---
-this is just my opinion, but it’s hard to play a game with only one “permanent” perk, so I’d advise not using more than 1 or 2.
---
3: don’t get cocky or down
---
-games can often take a very quick turn (survivor takes down haunted grounds, you get gem rushed and two gens are done in a minute). More often than not survivors will test their luck and make mistakes. If you get cocky you won’t win, and if you let the survivors win without a fight you most certainly won’t win.
---
4: take the hit
---
-this is for DS and pallets. Just take the hit. For pallets, once you break it, it’s gone for good, so more often then not it’s better to just take the hit and chase them for an extra ten seconds then to leave them down or avoid them. For DS, they can’t get very far anyway, so just take it and find them again. It’s not tunneling, it’s playing smart. 
---
5: don’t just use meta perks because people say they are good
---
-Most “meta” perks are good, but to use them you have to make an entire build around them, which means sacrificing perks you like. Perks play a role, but you can use bad perks and still be a good killer. Use the perks that work for you and don’t let people say it’s bad.
---
That’s all I have for general. I have more info for huntress and plague specifically if you need it
---
My god, the childishness is bad on PC, I can’t even imagine Xbox!
---
That's because NOED is a perk requiring no skill.  I have been facecamped to death by a killer who got no downs for 5 gens due to NOED, and depipped as a result. Not once or twice, but many times.  All of the survivor perks you mention require strategic gameplay to use effectively.  NOED rewards you for failing to play correctly the whole match.  It shouldn't even be in DBD.
---
There isn't really any second chance perks anymore for survivor. You activated DS? Try not to tunnel. Adrenaline popped? That's just a reward for the survivors for completing the gens. Exhaustion perks? Those are basic perks to extend the chase and are not "second chances".
---
Noed doesnt even work so yeah
---
And now you’ve become the very thing you swore to destroy
---
Have you been on the sub in the last week? This is everywhere...
---
Lol nobody disagrees. It's probably the most glaring issue in the game
---
Many thanks, and happy cake day :)
---
Cancer
---
&gt; is that if you DC for any reason you are the cancer of this game
---
I'll DC whenever I want to, thanks. Quit policing me please. I almost never DC but if there's a killer with aids internet or is just being a toxic douche with mori there's no point in wasting my time.
---
Swf- single white female
---
I mean most people would watch your streams and point out from a killer prospecthow they predicted your movement and try telling you how to better yourself or vice versa, plus you actually get tips on how yo learn killers and survivors
---
Ruin is incredibly powerful, and as a result it can be removed from the game.  It is intrinsically a gamble.  This is why I prefer skill based perks like Pop Goes the Weasel, but some killers really prefer to win through luck on occasion.
---
Only if you didn't fill it up to the markers/checkpoint
---
Same. Anytime I load into a lobby and see it above 150, bye.

Because they both circumvent the objectives, and end the game prematurely. Killers don’t have to force 3rd hook stage to kill, and survivors don’t need to finish all their objectives(the gate and some gens if part of the team is dead). Mori completely counters ds, one of the strongest survivor perks. Yes, with a key in play, the killer may still be able to kill some survivors, but can easily depip or black pip because of the escape. Same can be said about mori, it is true that it will be a hatch game most of the times if the killer play properly, but some survivors will still have chance to do gens and hook safe or even get the hatch. So yeah, both greatly reduce the chance for your opponent to rank up.
---
They have already gutted the flashlights,brand new part, and now insta heals. Key should be left alone. 
---
THE GUTTING OF THE OTHERS WAS 100% NEEDED. leave keys alone.
---
YO CAN YOU SEND ME THEM
---
Wouldn't be useful to people who have played huntress enough to actually use iridescent head
---
'he is speaking the language of the gods'
---
It... doesn't, actually. I went and cross referenced everything literally everything the community at large knows about pipping; that is to say, everything BHVR has ever released on the topic. There's nothing at all that suggests what you're saying is true.
---
what the FUCK is up kyle, step the FUCK up
---
I'm a bit skeptical this is possible, and if so it's certainly rare.  Exhaustion perks that extend chases are fair and every survivor should run at least one.  Survivors are the only players who can be immobilized and taken out of the game, they need strong evasion tools or DbD would not even still be a thing because it wouldn't be fun.  There are enough exhaustion perks to choose a playstyle and keep things interesting.  These perks are well done by the devs.
---
Just bring Kindred.
---
Dude yeah, alt-tabbed to a hook. It was only 1 minute!
---
I've got a feeling ur a salty killer main disguised as a survivor,,,
---
Ok kid
---
Why
---
I think it is true that mori is stronger than key because it counters da completely. But other than that I think they serve a similar purpose and have similar amount of influence.
---
Thank you I appreciate you being levelheaded. And okay I can see what you’re talking about, I had forgotten about the pip factor
---
Erin Harson would get three kills as a survivor.
---
There's always a way to just play survivor or just play killer and get to the end of the tome/the next level.  However, if you want all the lore from the archives, or if you want all the rift fragments to make leveling up your rift pass easier, you will need to do both survivor and killer.
---
I'm just imaging the God father screaming "Who are you speaking too?"
---
How I got it too. I don't know why I was worrying. They should change it to not DC for 5 games. Lol 75% of this community would not be able to do it. Dv away. You know who you are.
---
So basically you drew Claudette tapp and Adam reimagined as white/asian
---
Oh I didn’t know people on PS4 could be toxic, it’s usually just Xbox  /s
---
Saw: I want to play a game.
---
Gordan Ramsey : GET OUT OF HERE YOU FOCKING DONKEY!
---
Lol 😂 yeah when I saw it I was like uhm what the heck, is this a cryptic message from the entity or something lol
---
If the killer doesn't find them, if the killer doesn't know they have a key, if the killer doesn't know where hatch is when they know they have key, if the killer doesn't have franklin's because they brought it from the lobby, if they aren't the one that had the key and died, if they can find the dead guys hook to get the key, etc etc etc etc. And this is all stipulated on them getting enough gens done and having enough people die.
---
The list really goes on. It's not completely broken or over powered, it takes some effort to pull off, and I've watched plenty of people get into matched with keys, only for us to escape normally never having seen the hatch, or for them to die first without ever seeing enough gens done.
---
I could see some people wanting some changes to it, but we have far more pressing issues, and given how often they "fix" survivors, Mori's are FAR more of an issue, and need to be addressed next. It's tiresome watching the same killer main style posts hit the top of this subreddit day after day. Once something is fixed, it's on to the next thing killer mains hate, rinse, repeat. With the list of things that are actually broken, or just the fact that mori's haven't been touched, it's really lame watching these comments.
---
Its always the bitch in the short shorts
---
&gt;An experienced killer can chase an injured survivor through two safe loops, break the pallets, and after 60+ seconds of chasing that survivor they are finally at risk of being hit while moving to the next loop.
---
An experienced killer doesn't chase a survivor this long, problem solved.
---
Looks like his actor to me.
---
Not from a jedi
---
It's not meant to be used to camp
---
The visual is just wrong. It's just trying to bait you.
---
rework keys and moris would be welcome
---
Yeah exactly. Like any killer is going to seem overpowered if you don’t know how to play the game on either side. I’m under no illusion that yeah Spirit can feel really unfair to play against but what can they seriously do to her without ruining the killer. I’ve seen some suggestions about a directional phase sound and not allowing her to collide with survivors in phase which sounds good
---
Good luck with Demo! He’s a lot of fun and the best way to play him hasn’t really been figured out so there’s a lot of room to try random shit and it might be good.
---
I think (could be wrong) that you can go to Xbox dotcom and under settings allow messages from friends only. I hope that works for you because I know how toxic kids are there, regardless of how kindly anyone plays. 
---
It’s like this game is CoD lmao
---
Doing something that's not fun for everyone because you have to interrupt EVERYONE'S good time, not just three peoples', is really tryhard and probably not worth doing.  Hatch is an almost fully symmetrical mechanic, killer and survivor equally can hunt for it.  Killer has more mobility and no reason to hide so it's often easier on killer.  Sometimes teammate is waiting on hatch, but who cares?  When a survivor escapes me as killer, I know they had a good time.  It doesn't make me mad, nor should it.
---
at that point gates are already powered so at most one of those three survivors should die..
---
against the hag and huntress
---
I think it’s so you can no longer hit the bodies on the hook so you don’t have a cooldown as killer. Minor killer buff.
---
Not much you can do to stop a determined tunneler. You can offer up hits and try to bodyblock, but short of killing yourself you can’t do anything more helpful than gens.
---
As I read it, when hatch closes and it shows all gens done, does survivor get the points for the gens being done? Either for bloodpoints or for the pip system.
---
They should add a second variation of lampking lane to make it harder to get the infinite since there is a 50/50 chance of getting haddonfield. Kinda like how they did with shelter woods and the temple
---
I would pay up just for him to be the REAL freddy
---
You think it's impossible to loop a killer without an exhaustion perk? Pallets and windows are the only Evasion tools you need.
---
Your “yup” got downvoted? The hell?
---
But the perk is kewl
---
ESPECIALLY AS HUNTRESS

As a killer, it's boring and I prefer chasing.  If by "killer mindset" you mean "mainly derives pleasure from frustrating the ambitions of others," then I guess what you say is true.  But that's not why all people play killer, some people enjoy the more interactive encounters this game provides.
---
It does seem that way. Maybe people don't get as upset because you can counter traps fairly easily.
---
It's cocky in that they are only doing it because they believe they will be safe, if they really considered outcomes they wouldn't make brazen unhooks. 
---
It's a thin line between cocky and overconfidence.
---
Keys fuck up territorial killers like trapper up so badly
---
Holy shit, someone was able to acknowledge that someone else had a point on this sub? I haven’t seen that in ages
---
Yikes.
---
So i was playing Meg with Spring Burst on a Macmillan Map against a Myers. Myers had just exposed us and i ran triggering Sprint burst. At the same time the normal visual que to the exposed status continued to flash, but even more odd was that Meg now was sprinting around like 3 x the fast for a good 40 secs, until expose ran out. It was the funniest thing i've ever seen. I thought i was lagging at first, but then others said i was zooming around on the map.
---
That’s what I do too, not much fun to sweat hard against new players

---
Hiding? Dodging?.........oh so you're challenging me?
---
I don't run perks that assume failure. Same reason I only forgo Unbreakable, Flip Flop, DS, and Second Wind. I'd rather have perks like Sprint Burst, Alert, Prove Thyself, etc.
---
It's ping, not the hitboxes.
---
I guess I would.
---
It’s more about the killers view and frankly the game doesn’t care how survivors experience it.
---
Isnt the simple solution to destroy the portal?
---
Oh wow thats a yikes
---
Well, they have ruin so they are ruining the game, it does make sense
---
Yeah. I usually just try to have fun with the game. Bit harder at higher ranks. Plus I've been busy so i haven't been able to play much and its fun to see the new things
---
Totally has this happen before.

BP wise it gives you the pressure event worth 250 survival BP
---
I don't know about rank, but I assume not since the killer powered the gates.
---
What’s that homeless guy doing on the right?
---
You can only loop a killer for multiple gens if the killer makes mistakes.  The killer is faster and if she manages to rarely break line of sight, bloodlust ensures she catches you even more.  If you're a first percentile survivor and you're regularly looping killers for multiple gens, then loop on.  It's not really how the game is played for most people, and I'm sure you can confirm your teammates rarely pull off this feat.  Even with Dead Hard, multi gen chases are very uncommon.  Especially because good killers don't overcommit.
---
*Vibing, my dude*
---
Yes. A lot of people.
---
He's telling you to buy a pc.
---
Yeah I know, but sometimes its literally the only resource that you have and you have nowhere to go, or also to correct mistakes during loops
---
Sounds like a garbage buff to an already useful perk
---
Props to you, this is amazing work! This is the kinda shit I like seeing in the dbd Reddit❤️
---
I have been stuck at rank 8 at survivor since reset. This will be the only month so far I probably wont make it to rank 1 because of how awful my teammates have been. Working with the killer, however,  is a rare thing. I've been playing since launch of this game and have 4k hours in this game and only experienced survivors working with killers on 2 occasions.
---
I'm in the red ranks atm and I can tell you that you don't get there by not looking out for yourself. I don't do what you mentioned but I've had it done to me many times. I don't mind if they're injured and I'm not. I can take over the dog walking for a sec, but I hate it when we're both on our last hook or something lol
---
Fair enough. You do you buddy, I can respect that.
---
Dude, #nerfdevs2019 amirite?
---
Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
---
that’s kind of a bad excuse for a broken mechanic ngl
---
#truth
---
*sadoinknoises*
---
Devs are OP. They totally need a nerf
---
Best advice...play all killers and play survivor.
---
you fucking nailed it LMAO read this in his voice aswell
---
waaaaait, how is it used in the last 5%? 
---
you can literally have a 3 gen going at the end that could delay the game for a while and end in a 4k but if one persons dead, all three people could escape
---
pretty broken
---
Everything’s broken nerf hooks
---
Not telling everyone you finished Level 1 on the Tome and got a super secret never before seen or heard of sneak peek of the Level 4 challenges?
---
Not a true shitpost.
---
You're telling me nea isn't a killer?
---
great reasoning on keys not being overpowered
---
This is actually one of the best films I have ever watched. Nicholas cage as a surviour!
---
What
---
Not a joe skin, it’s a frank skin
---
keys and moris are literally the exact same thing, also moris have been nerfed, not saying they don't need further nerfs
---
thats the dumbest thing i ever heared, instaheals was a 1 time use item that destroy your medikit, a green madikit was a lot more dangerous since can insta heal many times, you have perks like Inner Strength from Nancy that insta heal and skip Nurse calling aura reading skill, or Steave that insta heal every time gets unhooked and no one has complainned about them, as killer i never had troubles having to do 1 extra chase or hit wich only means more points for me, killers are inmortal beings and there is many of them that can oneshot you, but get insta heal1 time to get 1 hit more its too much ?? now thanks to this crying baby killers, Survs got nerfed and pink item that cost 7000 points and destroy your medikit that cost also a lot of points has become garbage that none want use, because even self heal at lvl 1 or brown medikits heal faster than the pink healing item.
---
I don’t think there working with the killer but I feel like their just being toxic and playing only for themselves and end up screwing over their “teammates”
---
Idk but both of my cat were laying together and one of them decided to lick the face of the other who wasn't in the mood to be licked and it gently bit the licking cat's mouth which caused her to make the exactly same face as the meme cat and it stood like that for 10 seconds staring eachother. That alone gave me the best laugh on the whole day.
---
Unoriginal and spam.
---
Personally,i hate having to waste a perk slot just so bp gains on survivor aren't complete garbage.
---
The bp gains from bbq and wglf should just be rolled into baseline and the perks should be reworked.
---
Bbq would be fine, and plenty powerful if it just had the aura reading component.
---
Wglf could give some bonus or other per stack.
---
Altruistic action speed would be fine.things like unhooking,healing,untrapping,exit gate opening....whatever.
---
Spam? This is far from it
---
&gt;baby killer can't even loop shack
---
Lol. It's literally only good for Storehouse and some dropdowns, nothing else.
---
bade bith bematic
---
I've never had any issue avoiding the spirit. Then again I pay attention to the game and see when she uses her power rather sit around crying on reddit that it doesnt set off a giant neon orange beacon when she uses it
---
It’s basically the same thing as the 20+ other ones but a change of killer...
---
Anything for Rin
---
You can critique Beads Spirit all you want, but calling a player shit for running it is more a reflection on you than on them.
---
I can actually side behind that. What’s really the point of seeing them pre-game??
---
doesnt matter. play for myself not for defend killer getting 4k or whatever. if not fun, DC. simple as that.
---
That means Julie is Papyrus
---
If a killer can see whatever items im using in a lobby. Then I have every right to know when I’m going up against someone with a mori. 
---
The problem lies in the developers not being strict enough on people who intentionally DC. it’ll never change if people feel like they can always get away with it.
---
lmao this “what about” on every comment is hilarious
---
yes both are really dumb and unfair
---
Completed, waiting for the video at this point.
---
lmao yesterday I queued up to play killer, started a ranked game in Rainbow Six, finished it and when I came back it was still searching for a lobby.
---
I kinda expected one of these jokes, give it a nea cosmetic and call it a day XD
---
2000 IQ plays
---
same fam lol
---
I dunno about you guys but I do well as wraith. Even SWF seem to forget his lunge after he uncloaks, and if timed right it's great at ending loops.
---
100% man, so happy other people recognise this film
---
Dude, you got so fucking lucky. Any farther on that open and the light would have sold you out. Congrats on that sick escape though!
---
Killers shaking and crying rn.
---
How does this happen. Like when you que does it just give two killers.
---
And then they dc after being downed first lol.
---
It‘s a real pain. They better start punishing disconnects soon because it‘s getting really old real fast.
---
Same bro
---
Alright let me put this down simply for you. If you pay for the cosmetic you skip the grind therefore you win by getting the cosmetic by skipping the horrible grind to get it. I can link you the dbd wiki if you are still having trouble understanding the rift pass.
---
I don't know what kind of participation trophy bullshit you're on, but you've gone off the deep end with this. Part of this game is dying, and it's not up to you as the survivor to decide how you die. The sooner you realize that and stop being a crybaby, the better.
---
Ruin, Hahnted Ground, Discordance, and Maybe Spirit fury or enduring to eat pallets?
---
DC is cancer. I got a 45ping. And had 3 games in a row as killer with DC's. Switched to solo and guess what. I got hit no fair DCing. Thank you to the killer who stayed and let me farm btw. DCing should be ridiculed. 
---
You might not unless bad internet but you know who you are that I'm talking about. I can't wait to see what BHVR does to show a percentage of your self fail. or maybe stick you in rooms with klllers who DC back. I don't DC at all. I come from fighting games and they show your DC percentage so I can declined your sorry weakness. Bring on the DV. Unlike the people who DC boo boo face I'm stronger and allergic to dipshits.
---
This is big bait
---
Maybe for you, but not for the rest of the community.
---
At first I thought he could see through that small opening behind the locker and the wall.
---
People forget how terrifying trapper is some times you let your guard down for one second and *snap*

I’m NOT saying these are the best but these are the ones I have on my killers
---
Wow this is actually a much better answer and I'm sad I didn't think of it.
---
I absolutely love this meme format
---
I enjoy thanatophobia and pop, her map pressure is bad, need to slow the gen progress
---
If that other survivor was Laurie and on Xbox, that might have been me lol
---
I'm gonna find an excuse to use it on any Killer and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
---
Spirit is so fun though
---
Ngl it’s weird at look at, but it’s also really fascinating to see how many babies can be in one egg sack
---
But dying unfairly and in such an unfair way? Any other video game would have taken away the ability to do stuff like this.
---
A lot of killers already scream swf is OP so this would prob make it worse lol
---
Had this happen the other day when playing Myers on PS4. A Steve was running around crazy fast for two minutes and couldn’t for the life of me catch up to him. Luckily he dc’d after that.

M&amp;A + infectious fright let’s you sneak up, then get more info from infectious when you down. Considering how well she can snowball, it’s a pretty nice combo
---
it’s not the fact that she’s strong, it’s the fact that she has no counterplay
---
This is brilliant. Thank you  for this.
---
The "don't cleanse meta" is outdated I think. 
---
People have sunk into one way of thinking.
---
Do you guys think that the devs should do more balancing for this type of stuff? I mean the meta for perks for both survivor and killer is always the same, for ages. Sometimes I really wish they'd buff other perks up to the strength of meta perks, instead of having 60+ perks with so few really being part of the best of them.
---
I mean at least Exhaustion perks are all decent and all for slightly different playstyles, but for so many other perks you're just locked into the same shit.
---
If someone tries to body block a hook, pretend you are going to a different one. Then moonwalk and go to your original hook. They fall for it everytime.
---
Even if this was as wide spread as everyone claims (I feel like it really wasnt) there's a quite obvious fix for it: allow people to carry 2 empty vials to every match. That way, if one got filled, the other can start progress. Then there would be no point to suicide.
---
It’s a staple just like sol ring.
---
Try your best to listen which side you hear ratcheting and what not that's about it
---
PWYF loses a stack with demo's M2 because it loses a stack on any offensive action. Not just on M1s
---
That rank matchup tho.
---
Had something similar happen today. Playing wraith, I get 2 dc’s and a sacrifice with 3 gens left, I find the last survivor with every intent of killing them but as I’m chasing I feel kinda bad. I mean half their team left em in the wind. So I pick em up and start wandering around the map, eventually she gets the gist and stops struggling. I stop, she struggles free, and I follow her around as we search for the hatch, happily bing binging on my bell. Eventually she gave up and pointed at a hook. After game chat they said that they didn’t wanna waste time but they appreciated it.
---
i do it everytime before prestige and drop it all in one character
---
Arthur did nothing wrong!
---
If you find 2 survivors in 1 place you have a 100% chance at least one of them is not the obsession, meaning crisis averted anyway right?
---
Ehhh I won’t say that. He wasn’t a hero.
---
*watches the survivor get to another safe loop*
---
Me: Aw shit, here we go again.
---
Its funny how all "op" killer stuff is like 1 thing per killer. But sirvivors have like 9 for every 1.
---
Okay? They’re both broken. Don’t touch one of you’re not gonna nerf the fuck out of the other equally.
---
It is balanced it’s just those are the perks that outperform more. 
---
I just wish we had more variety.
---
A single quick crouch is usually seen as not toxic. It's when you spam it that becomes teabagging.
---
Camping wouldn't be as bad if survivors didn't swarm the hook and do fuck-all while he was being camped.
---
Yes, being camped feels bad, and having no killer to run around is bad, but complaining that you can't do anything about it is kinda dumb. You do gens if someone is getting camped, if you decide to swarm the hook you're just feeding the idea that camping is a good thing to do, because you just netted him 3 more kills
---
100,000 years is pretty quick compared to Killer Queues.
---
The problem is when the surviviors are so bad that they either suicide on second hook or don't unhook each other even when you're clearly not camping
---

A lot of streamers seem to do that lol it's like fungoose with ruin. He has to break down the exact number of seconds it adds etc every single time lol

---
Lol
---
Welcome to this sub. Endless reposts of memes that were funny for a second but progressively get worse and unfunnier for some quick karma.
---
Huntress for the outplay potential for both sides.

Yes, you will notice that when phasing there will be a side of a generator where you can't get close enough to kick it that will be the survivor blocking you

A good perk build for Any killer is, A finding survivors perk, A gen slow down perk, And two perks that help you out in chases, Imo

As a killer main who constantly struggles with like 10-20 min que times, I’m second hand angry lol. (I’m pretty new, only just got rank 16, so that’s why long que times)
---
All the thirsty megs make it impossible when they loot a chest first minute in the game
---
Except trapper grabs.
---
literally unplaying, fix now BHVR
---
True, but going by salty Survivor logic, one misstep getting them hit by a Killer who isn't anywhere near them or counting as a full down seems like it would be infuriating. When I think of someone toxic, I don't think of someone who'd go "I made this mistake; it's not the Trapper's fault."
---
The movie make's you sympathize with him, so he is technically the protagonist, which fits the definition for the word hero ;)
---
Ds because it's the only actual decent perk on the build
---
&gt;fought a highly trained Russian guard
---
Fuck that scene was stupid though.
---
I like the idea that the entity is just lazy and sets up matches for entertainment tho. To be honest I think it would confuse new players as to how everything came to be but still it’s a clever idea.
---
That poor killer, Gg wp, good bye gen slowdown
---
Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
---
Okay, yeah, so that's just farming, instead of some elaborate self-farming loop.
---
Well, for one, that's incredibly ironic considering you're playing SWF and using comms on discord. That by definition is not balanced
---
And second, shitty dedicated servers have nothing to do with balance :)
---
He literally has to do that if he wants to win. Nothing unfair about it.
---
Extra relevant - no stacks lost on a Tombstone Myers’ mori
---
That's the Toybasher Experience. I've been using a stopwatch to time my Ruin and over the past 25 matches it has an average uptime of 23.4 seconds. Fuck me I guess.

Oh yea, straight up murder is also not offensive apparently lol. Forgot about that
---
Yes, police. This comment right here.
---
I play survivor and Killer, when I'm playing killer and I spend a little too much time chasing one survivor (No longer then 100 seconds trust me) the gens go by within a flash, When I'm playing a survivor my teams like: Yeah guys, Keep working on hiding and cleansing dull totems
---
He did both wrong the start and then he did all the wrong things at the end. Protagonist is not equal to hero. And his actions are not of hero. His actions were  the consequence of his environment but then again, a person given an adversity could either step up or break down. A hero is when treated like Arthur Fleck, still chooses to work for the better
---
I was worried it would do the exact same thing except with the roles switched. Lol.
---
I can do whatever I want. I just wanted to point out how they went out of their way to do that and in the end I got what i needed.
---
Unfortunately you have people everywhere sitting around justifying their scummy disconnecting behavior by saying "Buh, my power might have went out!" or "Buh what about loadscreens crashes, I get those 90% of the time!" Or maybe some more understandable things, like insta-hatchet Huntress (Simple fix for that, though)
---
Reality is, this is the only game that I know of that doesn't have backfill where the devs actively defend the right to disconnect. let that sink in for a second; the devs who balance the game think that disconnecting is fine. Until they do start to punish people for it, it's really just sad that people will just disconnect instead of doing what people have to do in other games: be not toxic/shitlords and actually play a game through, good or bad :)
---
Personally, I think if an addon or an offering is so strong, like insta-meds where, or Mori's, they totally should show. However I do not think a green Mori should be shown, for example.
---
ok boomer
---
I’d gladly be their friend uwu
---
new to the game and to this reddit, but shouldn't the killer have at least some level of advantage on 4 survivors? Obviously it needs to be fair, but the whole intimidation factor was part of the game I thought
---
Damn your wife is big booty Jane. That’s hot

---
Nah the entity was just fucking lazy at putting her back together.
---
Survivors can outplay the killer even if they aren't making mistakes. 
---
Breaking line of sight means you lose chase, so killer doesn't get bloodlust.
---
I'm usually sitting at high purple ranks, eventually hitting red just by playing a decent amount. Not even rank 1.
---
Dead Hard equipped or not, its extremrly common to loop a killer for atleast 2 gens before going down if you get chased first.
---
I’m far from that lol. 
---
Thanks for the idiotic response mate.
---
For me Survivor takes 5 minutes or less and killer is about 10 minutes. From what I’ve seen in other posts, I’m pretty lucky. Not sure what’s going on

Get spirit for the perks, then play billy, huntress, or nurse.

Jokes on you, I AM your dad. Enjoy the ban son
---

---
Perhaps, Then people may start using Mori's after hooking the survivor twice as you'd be into a bit of a later game, then DCing early in the game would help the rest of the poor souls who loaded into the game hoping to survive the killer
---
yeah but how do u feel about the one where u unhook 3 ppl during endgame... in the SAME match? will even 0.1% of players be able to do it? they should at least change it to NOT having to be in 1 match.

lmao? They had like 3 seperate stages of testing the dedicated servers in the PTB and they were still far from being a final product, theh were near perfect for me but Americans had it really rough, now they have been released, over a month ago, and Australia has had it incredibly INCREDIBLY rough. They have had time for testing and shit, this isn't an issue of me being impatient, its the devs being fucking careless and failing to address the issue, all i want is a simple "yes we know its an issue, we are fixing it, temporarily we are disabling the dedicated servers". At least on P2P i could play the game properly without deadhard failing, i could loop properly, no "safe" loop is safe atm, NONE OF THEM ARE SAFE, its completely broken the game, been over a month and the devs have failed to address the issue. If you think thats impatience sorry to tell you but you ain't that bright.

Half of the rift? Cries in level twenty

okay so i went up against what was 100% four baby survivors. one of them died on first hook 5 gens left but they did pretty well the rest of the match. meg was chilling doing gens and having fun. sacrifice the others because i already got one and it wouldnt be fair to her. so anyways i was looking for her hatch and she wiggled out next to the structure she was on. i was worried she was going to sit on those logs but she figured it out :)
---
I do feel like that one should be nerfed down to like, 2. 3 is a little excessive, but I can definitely see the situation where that comes to play.
---
Yeah everyone can...
---
Yesssss, I still give hatch though!
---
To be fair, it’s not an excuse, friday the 13th had zero issues when dedicated servers where added to console version, yeah Friday is a dead game now but even a game with half the money this game has did dedicated servers
---
Nurse was fucking mid at best.
---
It’s definitely a glitch. Happened to me against Trapper. I let him hook me because I didn’t want to cheat or anything (We all got out anyway) and it went away, but idk how it happened

i would be pretty happy if both were completely removed
---
I have 2 ~ 3 min survivor queues and 10~15 min killer queues. People on both sides are having problems. It's not a one or the other thing.
---
Anyone else notice how that dude just speed reads through the whole thing?
---
Why though? That perk is only useful for the first hit (hitting a healthy survivor). But legion’s power is pretty much getting everyone injured so that perk isn’t as useful
---
well I cant
---
That's just a killer problem in general
---
Whenever I play prayer bead spirit they dont die. They DC.
---
I agree with your points, if Mori's were nerfed than I believe Unkillable should be single-use. But considering how rare it is to get Mori'd by Rancor or Devour Hope and how common it is to get Mori'd by Ebony's and Ivory's (especially in red ranks) I think this perk needs to be strong. Maybe it could have some caveat where it only works against Mori offerings / add ons but I think that would be a bit too convoluted.
---
It’s been posted 20+ time I can see it.
---
Imagine all the survivors and killers attempting to do these challenges and making an overall unfun and toxic environment for these. 
---
I mean the one  you listed just boils down to: Put on NOED
---
He thinks it gives it extra distance, like nurses blink, it doesn’t.

Yeah right lol. Most of em couldn't figure out a cheese sandwich.

What's the point of a crosshair/path that gives reduced accuracy?

i mean you're not wrong
---
TIL Everything is always the survivors' fault
---
I think the cooldown on instinct is way too fast.  I'm All Ears, as an example of a killer aura reading perk, can only trigger once every 40 seconds at its best.  I think it should at least be 80 seconds of cooldown.  Instinct would still tell you of the existence of bbq, Nurse's, Ears, Bloodwarden, and others, but this way it doesn't rofl at killers who have aura builds.  It would also help to differentiate between the purposes of Distortion and Instinct: Instinct tells you about the killer's build and occasionally their location, while Distortion can be used to become a ghost savior when the party is at its moment of most dire need. Both to buff it as a sidegrade and complement what I was saying about Unkillable elsewhere in this thread, consider making it another anti-obsession perk.  Killers can sometimes tell the difference in auras between survivors, and killers will generally choose to chase not-obsessions before they chase obsessions.
---
Hit and Run is hard for me to think about.  I think I'd need to see it in action in order to develop an opinion of it.
---
What, you’re going to tell me that people don’t think camping and tunneling is a ‘legit strategy’ on this sub just because the Devs said it’s not a reportable offense? I have a lot of comments to show you
---
Honestly I'm insecure about my connection and have been weirding out people by asking what my ping is.
---
maybe I should stop phrasing it "hey pal, how's my ping? Is it a good ping? Tell me or I'll camp you!"
---
This is an awesome tip, I'll be trying it stat!
---
LMAOOO
---
i was in a game where 2 people escaped with 2 gens left because of a key. if they hadnt had the key, MAYBE one wouldve escaped, but not likely. it was literally a free escape
---
You're a hero

o k   b o o m e r
---
Ok, im glad you can, I can't and I havent seen it posted. Don't say "everyone can" when literally not everyone can.
---
All I'm saying is I ain't ever seen a survivor point at a hook and sympathy give me a kill if I have a bad game as a shitty low tier killer
---

Guess play something that's fun for both sides?🙃

Remember -- She's trying to kill you.

&gt; But dying unfairly and in such an unfair way? 
---
=
---
I don't think that there's an easy solution to this. IMO this sort of thing is just part of the nature of the game -- a game where you have only 1 life -- there will always be annoying ways to die as survivor, and there will always be annoying BS you have to deal with as killer (e.g. pallets, "loops", stabby stabby, etc).
---
You can't really stop people from playing their own way: some guy might afk in lockers all game and then try to hunt the hatch, some killers might face camp. All you can really do is build in systems to discourage things that you want to discourage and encourage things that you want to encourage. Having the hook progress slower while the killer is close by is one such example of well-designed encouragement in action.
---
.
---
&gt; people who get camped are wrongfully punished by it with depipping
---
This is also something that I've been thinking about.  Sometimes your allies screw you over by sprinting across the map, leading the killer back toward the hook, and unhooking you 10m away from the killer. Sometimes your allies screw you over by circling around the hook, preventing the killer from ever leaving, as you bleed out to entity progression. Sometimes the killer just AFK's there in front of you. Sometimes you just straight up get unlucky as all hell and get found in the first 10 seconds, eventually leading to a fast death. Maybe you get straight-up mori'd. Etc etc. Only thing I can think of that would maybe help alleviate such things without completely reworking the game from the ground-up is some ability to participate in the match in some meaningful way from beyond the grave to prove that you deserve BP and don't deserve to lose a pip. But I don't think that BEHAVIOUR will ever end up doing something to that effect.
---
Doing God's work my man
---
Me neither, that's why when I'm playing as survivor and I sense that a killer has had a bad game, I do that, maybe we'll meet in game one day and I could give you a kill
---
StBfL mainly shines when there are at least 2 survivors together, as it makes it much easier to change targets quickly.
---
True, imagine the pain and suffering that killer will have to endure when he can't get you to that SHITTY Halloween hook
---
It’s common sense to do this ? Hag, Freddy, Nurse, Hillbilly, can all get back to an un hook far quicker the. Demo can.
---
This. If I see someone that's clearly struggling to even loop (usually dwits) I try to give them the hatch.
---
The problem is when they wiggle out over and over, get pissed and just sacrifice them
---
This doesn't apply whenever I hit red ranks. There's no reason to give them that
---
funny enough it was confirmed that the entity is partially controlling the killers, that is what the red stain is.
---
I mean it gets tiresome playing hag all day.
---
Its me :O)
---
Old news OP.
---
Take my upvote brave wave.
---
Theres 16 other killers
---
That’s much more rare than hitting a healthy survivor
---
Same logic we scape of a killer with mori, moris are fine
---
Stop.. use the search button please
---
just very slighty. it may go a little further off then usual, but not an absurd amount
---
Your making me feel bad
---
I personally think that anyone escaping with a key should be able to be grabbed like old hatch stand offs. it’d make it so you don’t have to tunnel someone with a key just to make sure they don’t get the escape, and while it isn’t an insanely high level of counter play, it’s certainly there
---
It's useful because of the staggering draw backs of feral frenzy. Sometimes it's honestly better to just use your basic attack rather than risk the fatigue and you can still chain attacks at high speed with STBFL. I can hit twice and down efficiently, something I can't do with their power.
---
It’s probably the vocal minority and there are situations where camping and tunneling are appropriate
---
Oh what you deleted because I’m right that’s it’s been posted 20+ times wow.
---
It was an idea they mentioned a while back but they couldn't work on it until they sorted out dedicated servers. Next time there's a Q&amp;A I'll try to get a question about it in
---
Make ebony mori for 1 survivor. Make a key only allow 1 person through the hatch and it shuts again.
---
I've had games where the killer got kills off of one hook. Or even NO hooks in the case of Michael's addons. No one is calling for nerfing Moris and addons because they're consumable. 
---
People only want to nerf survivor items and add ons. It's the ONE thing that is ALWAYS consumed when used unless you get an addon of equal rarity as the keys. so no different than a Michael burning two purples to get his infinite insta mori
---
You don't want hatch escapes? Kill the survivor with the key.
---
Dude I’m level 12 and only have 3 challenges left lol
---
Cheers man, good advice! In a queue myself haha
---
This is the exact same shit on the front page, why post it again?
---
Looks like someone failed no nut November. Wrong type of penetration ghost face.
---
As if some challenges is gonna fix queues. I finished all my challenges in two days, most people already have finished them as well. It would maybe speed up queues for a day or so.
---
Well if they hook you then hey, You've lost the game, Move on, if they let you have hatch then Hey, free points, thank them and then move on, Some killers are nice, some killers have had a bad day and want 4k's

Wouldn't really call it a meme. To me, Slender is at the same level as FNAF is at being a cheap jumpscare simulator with boring gameplay but good ambiance. Also just like FNAF, no one over the age of 12 cares about it anymore.

Happy cake day
---
This is incorrect, Pig's Dash Attack is specifically *not* a basic attack, and doesn't trigger any gaining or losing of stacks of STBFL.
---
Removed for spam
---
Yeah because that's exactly what I was saying good job man
---
Move the cursor over the killer/survivor, hold X and move the left stick.
---
Use at your own discretion...
---
I agree. kinda how it works on rainbow six siege
---
It's not difficult to figure it out. The excuse "won't be horror anymore" is dumb. After you play x amount of time the horror part doesn't even apply, it's just art design at that point
---
I don't play any other horror game, they actually scare me, even if loving horror movies. Why this game doesn't apply the same thing? Is an online game that after a while won't take long to get used to and stop scaring you, especially when you see people looping the killer (aka the "scary" part of the game)
---
So at least balance everything out to actually be fun for everyone
---
Its not everyone's good time. It's 1 person's time that I don't even care about. Because I'm trying to kill them. It's also not balanced between the 2. Survivor can be sitting at it waiting for 3rd person to die when you hook them for a free escape. Or they can wait at an exit gate until you leave, to have on average, a free escape. (the exit gates typically spawn too far away to watch both and still be close enough to stop them from opening).
---
I don't care if they had a good time when I'm killing them. I care about if I had a good time. I'm not toxic when killing them, and sometimes I have sympathy when someone DC's early. That doesn't mean I won't go for a 4k in a fair match. That's like telling a survivor to not do more than 1 gen because the killer would feel bad if you finished them.
---
Objective and facts are literally the same thing lol
---
My fellow rare boy
---
There’s one where you have to 4 gens in a single game explain how that works
---
Tuning Guide and Primer Bulb.
---
Look, it was a great film, and I absolutely sympathize with Arthur, 100%. But I have to get this off my chest (the movie has resonated with me and I’ve been bottling this up for a while so here goes....) 
---
I don’t think the third death in the film was the actions of a hero. The third, immediate death. I won’t go into spoilers, because I’m on mobile and I don’t know how to mark spoilers on here, but that wasn’t heroics, self defense, etc. It was hateful, cold-blooded malice. And look, I’m not going to say “hurr durr incels mad” because Arthur was a byproduct of this society (there’s the word) and it isn’t necessarily his fault he turned out as mentally unstable as he was in the film. But! (And it’s a big but) his actions are not justified, and the third death in the film solidified that for me. 
---
Look, the first two deaths I wasn’t cheering for, but I didn’t really feel bad for them. But the third guy? You just don’t... do that to someone. I’m sorry, but it was cold. Very, maliciously cold. 
---
Just my opinion, though. Fantastic film.
---
That hex that netted me 6 4k games this weekend because people didn't see a ruin and assumed it was haunted ground. My devour hope rarely gets cleansed unless there is a nancy with inner strength or they finally cotton to it when they're all on their death hook and exposed.
---
He cuts some of the time off the front end of a chase by sneaking up, which can get you an early hit. That and he's good for patrolling gens because people won't run before you get there. In the chase he leaves some things to be desired, unless you're running Shadow Dance add-ons to fuck with people, that's always fun. All things considered, a killer's power level is usually based on how their power helps in the chase, which Wraith doesn't do much of. His power is more to cut down the time between chases.
---
this is so #relatable because i also rip off the head of my food 😂😜😳
---
Last night I went against a Trapper that did this. He hooked a Claudette in the first minute and immediately facecamped her. He did it to everyone he hooked. I don't mean patrolling, I mean standing still right in front of the hook. The best part?
---
Not only did I still manage to save 2 people right under his nose, but my teammates knocked the gens out fast. Last gen popped while I was being facecamped on the hook with the Trapper shaking his head at me. Gates are open, all 3 people come to help unhook me, Trapper tries to swing at someone and hits me while I'm still in the unhook animation, I sprint burst towards the gates with Dwight following to take a hit for me, and the Trapper DCs.
---
It was so funny and satisfying.
---
I don’t know mate I do agree this game is not scary In the least bit but I’ve seen people claim that this game scares them all the time... 
---
Probably just rare 1%ers though.
---
It also does it on the sacrifice 5 survivor challenge. Just started it had a game where 2 dc 2 sacrificed and I only needed 1 more the next game. its kinda sad that people quit after being picked up for the first time.
---
This. I play survivor and killer both in purple ranks, and when I play killer, survivors swarm the hook to get the rescue and act surprised when I pull them off and get a free hook, or just a free hit on 2 of them before the unhook. When I play survivor and get camped, my team does nothing but run loops around the hook then complain in end game chat about how killer was camping. 9 times out of 10, its at least one survivor that doesn't understand that them looping the killer right by where I'm hooked means that I won't be unhooked, then they blame their 10  IQ plays on everyone else. And when I'm legitimately being camped, they just sit there and point at the killer with 5 gens left and waste all the time I spent on the hook. 2 whole minutes of free gen progress wasted because they thought pointing was a good way to punish the killer for camping. Its absolutely mind boggling to me
---
This is what I have been talking about. 3 survivors have minimal if any chance of finishing all generators. 2 survivors have zero chance. A reduction to generator completion time for each survivor killed would keep the match more balanced and challenging throughout. 
---
However, this change needs to be made in conjunction with 2 other things.
---
1. Base generator completion time is increased. 
---
2. Generator completion time in coop is slowed down. Currently 2 man is around 50%, change to around 60-65%.
---
This is to extend the early game for killer.
---
damn, really gon call my clueless ass out
---
Do you have nothing better to do other than being rude to people online? 
---
Nothing I have said is wrong, prior to like 5 minutes ago I hadn't seen any of the posts on the sub about this, a friend showed me this on snapchat and I posted it thinking others would want to see it. Literally not everyone can see it like you say, but whatever. I deleted the post because after seeing all the links that someone else posted, I felt that the purpose of the post was already made. 
---
So sure, in that way you're right, it has been posted many times. Sorry that I never saw any of them I guess.
---
I don't care much about slugging.  But a lot of killers have complained about it, and my point is they can just not do it.  I personally don't bother with it because I don't care about the 4k much, I just want to feel like I did a good job and have fun.
---
The same thing happened to me and I love playing nurse. Yeah it’s bugged I believe.
---
i think NOED and Ruin needs to be reworked, Ruin probably after they tweak a little bit on the generators times, Moris are completely overpowered and so are keys, although not to the same degree, i wouldn't mind if both of them were removed completely or reworked, but i really can't see why you have a problem with Devour Hope? 
---
i mainly play killer and although i love the perk and think it can be really powerful sometimes, it's a gamble that only works in 1 out of 5 or more games and after the first down you can be sure it will be found within 1 minute MAX, after i got to rank 1 i was never able to more anyone again with it, so i think DH is ok?
---
Snap twice in a row on one hand as fast as you can, that's about as long as it takes.
---
*Lmao this is so spot on.*
---
Repost, from like last week
---
Or sometimes immersed Dwights that crouch around the map's edge for the whole trial.
---
Platform: PC 
---
Type of Bug: Gameplay and Audio 
---
Description of Bug: When fatigued after using your second blink there is an unexplained movement speed buff that occurs while fatigued. Once out of fatigue the Nurse slows down to what seems like a snail’s crawl for a few seconds before being able to move normally again. In addition, sometimes you are unable to use your blinks despite having charges left in your power bar which causes the animation and the sound for nurse charging her blink to bug out. 
---
Steps to reproduce: I unfortunately do not know the steps to reproduce the movement speed bug while fatigued but as far as the animation and sound bug that occurs when using your power, it would seem that using your second blink too quickly causes the issue. 
---
Specs: Nvidia GeForce 1060, 500 gb SSD external hard drive, Windows 10 OS
---
Am I the only one that doesn't understand how keys are op? They are pretty rare, and rarely usable in matches. What is even the point of bringing a key if you'll lose 20 to get 1 to work?
---
Thanks for stealing my meme
---
Does pig avoid it with her ambush?
---
The thing is, with this build it doesn't matter whether or not they drop the pallet on you or drop it early because it's pretty much the same amount of time to break it.
---
The point is you just downvoted me because I simply stated that it’s been on here +20 times. 
---
So I have to comeback when I’m right to spread it in your face. 
---
That’s it really just to give myself satisfaction lol. 
---
And then you probably thought I’m just an idiot and an ass until someone showed you otherwise.
---
What's SWF?
---
Repost and over saturated content
---
I don't have a problem with Devour Hope, I run it in my builds most times because it's the only way to get the kill by hand dailies because I don't play killer often so I don't have a stockpile of moris.
---
I included it with the others because it's that kinda perk, ya know?
---
Hag too :(
---
Right, A swf team sometimes is a nightmare on it's own, Like imagine playing trapper or Ghostface or something, in a swf team they tell eachother where you went and where you put your traps and what not, Now imagine everyone being a swf, Welp, Time for the survivors to become a lot more organized
---
Even better idea, let's not.  Seriously, why do people hate on moris and keys? They're just little bits of flavor to break the monotony and add some unpredictability and slasher-flick kills to the game.   
---
As someone at rank 1, I rarely see moris and almost never see a key-hatch escape, and I have no idea why this community loves bitching about both so much.
---
I always wanted a Killer v Killer gamemode ever since Ghostface was added.
---
As a survivor I think I would simply never want to have voice chat on in a game like this if it wasn't with my friends. Even the simplest of callouts like "Killer is leaving, killer is here, killer is coming back" and so much more make a massive difference in knowing what you should be doing, where you should be, and how to effectively do the gens in a way that you're in 0 danger from the killer. But there are a lot of survivors I see that, for the most part, I'd just never want to see or hear.
---
The devs have enough problems with balance, do you really think something with a very vague notion on how to even balance it like this would work? Maybe if they balance the game around this and then release the comms alongside it in a balance patch, sure.
---
This even invalidates perks that specifically help you as a solo survivor, like Kindred - a perk that should really be baseline itself. I guess my point is, while playing solo sucks infinitely more than SWF, and solo's get punished by both their teammates an the killer for not being in one, it's not as simple as you make it out to be to fix.
---
Their way of balancing the killer lol. To be fair, i was killing a bunch of high ranking survivors when I all I had was a naked killer at rank 19 lmao.
---
That’s how I feel and I’m not sure how to combat that especially since you are a 1 man army.
---
You're absolutely right, but I would extend it to observing that most people in *humanity* are not funny.  It just so happens that gamers are much more likely to be connected to a means of communication that propagates memes.
---
It's probably not full gens. Still pretty hard.
---
Please stop. You are really embarrassing yourself. 
---
The challenges would not fix queue time. Sure maybe they’d quicken it for a day, but the challenges soon run dry and everyone goes back to playing their preferred side. And no, there are not only 5 people, there are thousands.
---
And I know you might be saying “b-but let’s just imagine there are only 5 people!!” Okay, how far should we take this? For the sake of argument, let’s say two are killer mains while the rest are survivors. One of the killers just only does the killer lore and never touches survivor. So now there are only 4 players and no game ever starts. Plus it isn’t as black and white as you make it seem to be. What if 3 of the players only play pc while the other two only play console? What if one of those 5 players stood playing for half a year? What if..
---
My point: If you’re going to make an argument using numbers then use REAL numbers, not some you pulled out of nowhere. 
---
P.s. nobody cares if you’re a killer main. We’re not going to suddenly bask in your “wisdom” and praise you just because you play more killer than survivor. This still would be dumb either way.
---
Yes she’s still good. Only ppl that are suffering really are the omega blink users and the 4 blink users really. If you are use to just doing 2 blinks she’s still amazing. It’s just instead of catching a survivor in 5 seconds you get them in like 10
---
It's more along the lines of "If the killers can weaponize polio, we should be able to weaponize measles".  Can't remove one without the other.
---
&gt;How about we fix them both instead of staying miserable.
---
Because they're fun, not miserable?
---
How would you suggest fixing them?  They're already at an incredibly weak state compared to launch after the nerfs and added perks.
---
I think I did go a bit too forgiving with the cool down for instinct but I think 80 seconds is a bit too long. I intended it as a way to help discover what perks the killer has but I didn’t originally realize how much that would all entail. Overall though, I don’t think it’s nearly as important for survivors to see the killers aura as it is for killers to see survivors aura so a relatively short cool down makes sense to me. Maybe 70/60/50.
---
As for Hit and Run, obviously it’s an alternative to Lithe/Balanced Landing. I can’t decide if it would be better or worse than the two. I think it would be worse in the way that it’s much easier for the killer to play around it but it would also force killers to start respecting palettes a lot more since if you do land the stun they stand a decent chance of actually losing you. That ones tricky.
---
The episode with The Spot or the first Michael Morbius one were weirdly my favorite.  The show seemed weirdly good about making obscure villains way more interesting while kind of dropping the ball on some big name villains (Venom and Hobgoblin were kinda lame in the show).
---
If someone tries to farm off hook in front of you STBFL makes it a guaranteed down without unhooking
---
Currently I think putting every killer on Billy, Spirit, Freddy, Nurse level would be a good start. I was incredibly disappointed when they nerfed Nurse. I genuinely think she was fine when you faced her off against SWF because she had enough power to keep pressure on them *despite* their constant knowledge of her location.  
---
So far killers with incredibly high mobility as well as at least some chase pressure are the ones who can actually manage to draw a tie with a moderately communicative swf. So mobility is the main thing I'd focus on adding to other killers, that way they can apply pressure around the map better.  
---
Obviously no solution will be perfect, but balancing around the minority of survivors (solos) is just plain dumb.
---
I usually run We'll Make It and Aftercare because I've had pretty good luck with safely unhooking people, but it never fails, every time I try the Deliverance/Breakdown combo I get hooked first 100%. It's like a god damn bad luck charm.
---
Litterally, Like in a swf team someone tells someone else who the killer is, Now everyone tells someone who the killer is, if you're, for example say pig, Now everyone will start looking around them and checking everywhere so they dont get jumped, If that turns to everyone in the game then uh....Plus the only 'scare' part of anything is the surprise you get from a stealth killer lmao
---
NANI
---
Like I said. Dead Hard is not used for dodging hits, but for distance. You almost got this survivor, but they use dead hard to get to the window and create another loop, or create even more depending his skills in loop rotation.
---
Huntress has it a bit tough because they can dead hard an extremely well placed hatchet, or get around the corner. Simply baiting it isn’t enough most of the time.
---
This, or a *clickclickclick* of a flash light. God I hate flash lights.
---
Me, a killer main with very little care for real plays: a safe pallet loop? Well, I might just go ahead and break that!
---
It's a bad luck charm
---
What?
---
I'm a pretty average red ranked killer, but give me wraith with no addons or perks, with me drunk, and I'll smash rank 15+ survivors while browsing reddit on a 2nd monitor.
---
Throw me in with a team of red ranks solo players with good killers and meta perks and I'll have to work for the 2k.
---
Rank is not the end all be all, and there are totally people that don't belong in their rank (in either direction), but rank is generally a good rough indicator of skill in most cases.
---
Yes
---
This, monstrous shrine, insidious.. it goes on..
---
Maybe it's just nostalgia but I really like its version of Venom, though he doesn't compare to PS1 Spider-Man Venom, this shit always cracks me up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDSCeKKXp9I
---
Agreed other than ghost and Myers I still shit myself sometimes lol
---
Lmfao as soon as I read "As someone at rank 1" It just felt condescending.
---
Imagine a King Boo Killer based around paintings. Instead of hooking survivors, he traps them in paintings, then other survivors have to get one of a couple special flashlights located in the Basement/somewhere randomly in a trial, and then shine the light on them like the Dark Light Device from Dark Moon and Luigi's Mansion 3.
---
It is full gens. You have to completely repair the total progress of 4 gens. If this goes off the same logic as Second Wind too, then that means you can’t have someone help.
---
I love playing against the Trapper, especially with my SWF. We just play to have a fun time, so we all lose it when someone gets trapped or gets peeked by GF or the like.
---
Right!?, I agree, And although I sound like a massive killer main while I'm saying this (I'm not I play both sides I promise :( ) Killers NEED to be buffed, a tiny bit, so they're actually intimidating
---
👏👏👏
---
Guess I’ll just tell all those random teammates to sit in a corner and sit on their hands all game
---
No I downvoted you because you're acting like an ass, saying that everyone can see it and that you can see it, so then it must not be news. I never said that it hadn't been posted, just that I hadn't seen it, which was true at the time.
---
Anyway, I don't care enough anymore, I've already deleted the post and its not worth arguing any longer.
---
Oh, they'd definitely need to do an overhaul of the balance before releasing it but either way, the fact that some survivors have such a massive advantage for no other reason than that most killers are designed to face solos is a huge problem.  
---
A callout system would be fine to. There's plenty of games that have a Voice, Text Chat, and Callout system it wouldn't be hard for them to implement all of those with mute options.  
---
Hell, even Dark Souls has a voice chat option (no one uses it, but it's there)
---
Not trying to make the game easier at low ranks, just trying not to nudge toxic killers into the low ranks instead of providing a real reason not to use toxic strategies.
---
Ruin is rough for noobies, but the typical response is "run around like a chicken with their head cut off" instead of "sit and git gud at skillchecks". I think if it was a core mechanic, the latter approach would come more naturally.
---
Mostly, I just think gens are too damn fast, and ruin as a perk is a terrible bandaid to that problem.
---
wheres kate...
---
probably add a timer just like with the exit gates?
---
probably not so long
---
Plus even if you’re a survivor main a buff to all the killers means more new and refreshing games not the same 2 or 3 killers every game. 
---
So it’s like happiness for everyone. 
---
Also buff all the weak or not used perks as well.
---
See, even though I disagree with OP, I gotta play devils advocate for this one as well. I don’t agree with you. 
---
“Hero” is such a glorified yet subjective word. Arthur is not a hero, in this sense, because he mercilessly killed people that - in my opinion - did not always deserve it. That’s not heroism, that’s blood thirsty. 
---
However, in a movie like, say, The Dark Knight (on the theme of Batman) Bruce is not a law-abiding citizen. He’s a rule-breaker. He doesn’t care for the law, he plays his own game how he sees fit. And yet, he does so in a very - almost objectively - just way. It’s not legal, but it’s fair.
---

There are honestly a lot of different perks that work very well with Myers and make him very fun to use. I've got a list of good perks to use right here for ya:

First of all, in order to get perma tier 3, the only way to get that is to equip the Ultra Rare addon: Fragrant Tuft of Hair which is his only addon that gives you infinite tier 3. I'd also highly recommend equiping the Rare addon: J. Myers Memorial. This will help since it takes longer to get to tier 3 with the Fragrant Tuft of Hair equiped.
---
My current build with Myers is BBQ and Chili, Infectious Fright, Monitor and Abuse, and Pop Goes the Weasel. I usually equip the addons: Dead Rabbit and J. Myers Memorial (or Memorial Flower) with this build. With Infectious Fright, Monitor and Abuse, and Dead Rabbit, I can I go into tier 3, down a survivor instantly, and immediately go to another survivor who screamed and revealed their location to me in my terror radius. If this is not the situation however, I can use BBQ and Pop Goes to hook a survivor and see the survivors and which generator they're doing with BBQ so I can go to it and kick the gen to regress it faster with Pop Goes.
---
Other perks that work great on him are as follows:
---
* Hex: Ruin (What killer does this not work on?)
---
* Bamboozle (Myers can vault windows faster than other killers, this can definitely be a benefit to that ability)
---
* Discordance (When two or more survivors begin working on a gen, Myers can sneak up on them with his smaller terror radius and get some good stalk on them)
---
* Thrilling Tremors (Similar reason to Discordance, only when you pick up a survivor you see which gens are being worked on so you can either go stalk them or combine it with Pop Goes the Weasel and kick the gen that's being worked on)
---
* Brutal Strength (Unlike most killers, Myers needs to respect pallets so that he can get stalk off of survivors. This perk will help so that he can break pallets fast and still keep up the chase)
---
* Corrupt Intervention (At the start of the game, Myers has pretty weak map pressure which can cause him to fail his early game, so this will help to narrow down the gens and area Myers needs to patrol. It also doesn't have the same random RNG as Ruin so that's a plus to it as well)
---
* Enduring + Spirit Fury (For if you love Myers' tier 3 ability but hate respecting pallets)
---
* Remember Me + Rancor + Blood Warden (Again, it can be easy for Myers to fail his early game. I'm not saying you should always run these perks forever because it's good to branch out more and discover Michael's true power but a solid end game build can be fun. Just hit the obsession with Remember Me to add on seconds to the door opening time, kill the obsession with Rancor in the end, hook someone who you find struggling to open the door that has more seconds added on to it to block the exits)
---
* Nurse's Calling (Good on any stealth killer)
---
* Save the Best For Last (Good perk on any M1 killer in general)
---
* Play With Your Food (Faster movement speed + instadown ability = very fun and very deadly)
---
* Dark Devotion (Really fun perk and can throw survivors off when you hit the obsession and then go to others in tier 3 with 0 terror radius \*wink\*)
---
* Fire Up (Again, Myers vaults windows faster, but imagine combining this with Bamboozle and Fragrant Tuft of Hair \*wink again\*)
---
Said that with Dedica- oh... :(
---
Fucking repost
---
The edge of the map is their locker
---
I get cleansers in purple ranks as well
---
PrestonKorn you are a bawdily bent gut-stretcher!
---
Facts
---
I imagine after the second time they would wise up hence the difficulty ad bp great idea.
---
If you have the DLCs this is a strong build.
---
Hex:Ruin - Slow the game down (just a little bit) so you can build up your stalking to tier 2-almost3
---
Pop Goes the Weasel - One of the strongest perks in the game right now, helps you to stall even more, you can knock of 25% progress of a generator after hooking a survivor
---
and pick 2 of the following:
---
Infectious Fright -  Strong snowball perk, makes all survivors in your terror radius scream if you down a survivor, it works with Tier III instadowns. Detection Perk.
---
Discordance - If 2 or Survivors work on a generator it will be highlighted yellow and you will get a sound notification.
---
Thrilling tremors - if you pick up a survivor, generators not being worked on at that moment will show up white and will be blocked for 16 seconds
---
Surge - You should down people a lot and with this you can regress a lot of generators at once if their placement is favorable. All generators in a 32 meter radius around you explode and regress for 8%.
---
Surge and Tremors is a great combo. Generators effected by surge are already regressing and this can't be stopped for 16 seconds with means another 4ish% of regression guaranteed on top of the 8% from surge.
---
PgtW works well with Discordance or Thrilling because they let you know which generator to rush to to apply the 25% regression.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The strategy is to stalk up to almost tier III asap and start downing people (don't be afraid to grab some people in Tier I if the opportunity presents itself).
---
Once you have started downing Survivors keep their progress in check with PgtW and just keep on hooking and kicking generators until they run out of hook stages.
---
If survivors keep looping you in higher ranks, you could switch PgtW with Bamboozle for extra fast vaults in tier III and window blocking, but really good Survivors won't fall for that once they know you got the perk, esp. if they are on voice com.
---
There are tons of tutorials to learn how, just search "how to moonwalk in dead by daylight" on youtube and theres really good videos
---
Obviously ur right, she was so mediocre OMFG (sarcasm)
---
This is pretty common advice, but 99% your stalk meter, so you can quickly fill out the last percent and have your Tier 3 on demand.
---
I used to like it, but now I don't think it's worth it on killers who can't preserve stacks when attacking the obsession. Ignoring 1 player the majority of the game allows them to do essentially everything with impunity.
---
Automatic DC tbh.
---
You literally just reposted my meme.

Yes. Tell me how it’s a joke.

These are the real challenges, I got the glitch that sends you to tear four and decided to get a full list because i couldn't find wind anywhere else. You can confirm against the others that are in a couple of other posts if you would like.

With light weight so I don’t see the pixel of orange leading elsewhere I’m assuming?

If these changes were made, my Trapper playtime would absolutely go up.

Funny.still a repost
---
Dad mobile sounds lit
---
I will definitely keep this in mind! I have every DLC except for spirit, so I'll work up the characters you suggested
---
Its rng. Using an odd bulb doesnt care about rng tho
---
The game has some great jumpscares and panic moments, imho.
---
Only yesterday I actually got trapped by a Demogorgon using Cruel Limits. Suddenly the exit window I had in mind was not avaible anymore and I got downed. Still great fun.
---
Just make sure to grab the obsession from the trap.
---
Love it. 😂💕

Welcome to r/deadbydaylight.
---
good, good game.
---
You get points for struggling now, so it will be worse now.
---
A killer with a huge lunge (T3 Myers, pig, Billy) are probably gonna just beat you down through windows. I've gotten some pretty questionable hits and for me, if I down a survivor through questionable hits, I try to just leave them.
---
Unless they're toxic. You play toxic, you're liable to get multiple spankings.
---
I could've been much meaner and said "Stun the Killer after exiting a Locker" meaning you HAD to use Head On
---
You can still use Pallets and Decisive Strike as they also give the "Killer Stun" points.
---

I just find a survivor and don't chase. Then place the trap in an obvious position they can see and nod my head like crazy. Most of them realize I'm only there for the challenge / daily and help me get it
---
I'd say Myers, Freddy and Clown are the most willing to kill indiscriminately going off of their backgrounds, so they're probably favorites.
---
I’ve jinxed myself, I just now got my first hate mail ever. The person said “u would need an op killer lmaoooo”. Frikin this is only the fourth time I’ve played as Ghostface sheesh.
---
I have to agree. I only make use of bamboozle in shack loops. Window vaults are not that strong in the newer maps so bamboozle feels like a waste most of the time.
---
I played him since the last reset and he got me from 15 (sigh) to 10. And he is great fun to play.
---
But I can already see that I will struggle the deeper I get into the single digit ranks.
---
A rework is in order.

Thank you :D

Don't give the devs ideas on future level 4 challenges.
---
New theory, will see the nectar things with the new killer.
---
Know I want a chapter with the joker as the killer and Arthur fleck as the survivor his split mind is being abused by the entity.
---
I always get trapped at the exit gate. When I get the switch in my sights with no trapper around I get over enthusiastic and forget something as basic as to look for a trap. Every time it happens I internally scream “you know better than this!!”
---
Yes, BHVR needs to keep taking away mechanics that have been in the game since launch, entirely!!! This is how you sound
---
I don't complain, but isn't it wasteful to trap the same survivor? I once had a pig blow 3 traps on me, and one of them was on my death hook - i guess she forgot it was my time to go.
---
Both his red addons should be baseline, also he should start with all traps on him like Hag.
---
Okay but people who try to aggressively heal you and spam emotes and fast vaults when you’d rather just do the gen are worse. 
---
Especially when there’s a single gen left and I’m running adrenaline lol. Like if I don’t get off a gen to get healed after 5 sec TAKE A HINT

i agree she needed a change but what they did was too much

Hero is a good person that does more than the average. You can twist it around but thats the main gist. Law is not equal to good, Law is equal to order. Laws have the idea of good but it has been twisted countless of times in the favor of bad thats why its in the middle. Batman aims to do good disregarding the Law. He is still a hero. Hero is not subjective its always points to good, what is good is whats subjective.
---
They need to at least change the NOED challenge. The rest, although incredibly difficult, can remain as long they change the NOED challenge.

Looks like you might have to wait a couple weeks but at least they are working on it.
---
Tunneling isn’t optimal tho
---
I've never had someone successfully use no mither against me lol, everytime I see someone using it I think ty for making yourself 1 hit all trial for me
---
Moris already got reworked. The key issue time and time again is tunneling/camping making it unfair. 
---
Keys need reworked addons, but purple and pink only serve on purpose, what could possibly change?
---
That explains a lot. I play on PS4 most people are assholes
---
ooo thank you so much!
---
This is actually brilliant.
---
I actually just found this a bit ago, I couldn't find it before which is why I made a post, I sure hope so. I have quite a bit of money on my microsoft account I could throw into DLC along with getting it on gamepads.
---
150 is a joy for console playera
---
How is it not better to eliminate a player early? If you can have one hook from each of 3 Survivors, you gain nothing outside of BBQ stacks, should you have it, which don't affect gameplay.
---
If you hook one Survivor 3 times, the match is MUCH easier for you now. Only BT and DS actually get in the way, and only Make your Choice changes matters to better favor rotating.
---
#Disconnect Four Bitches!
---
*Killer Master Challenge* 
---
While using **The Doctor** have 4 survivors **disconnect** from your match.
---
* Complete this challenge in a single trial
---
50k bloodpoints, 5 shards. Gives a disconnect symbol charm.
---
Idk if Nurse is good anymore since I hardly face her at red ranks which idk if its a good thing or not because since her absence the Huntress has been making a major comeback and competing against the spirit for the most overused killer in red ranks.
---
Well, then you're an asshole, aren't you? How about articulating an opinion if you have one?
---
I made it to purple ranks last night for the first time too, it was surprisingly easy to get there. Then my first match I go against a 4 man SWF and get gen rushed and no hooks and they knock me back to green. 
---
Apparently it's an elite club I'm not allowed to enter
---
Well you're obviously wrong otherwise there wouldn't be an entire post and some comments disappointed that BHVR listened to that part of the community that cried over a secondary objective. Stop acting like this game is all rainbows and hugs and when events come everyone become gremlins and decide to be toxic just for the sake of it. People are toxic, events or not.
---
Yikes it was a joke.
---
He kills any intruders of the castle and was in charge of the executions in the past.
---
Took me to prestiges to get it to show up on trapper but eventually got it P3 lvl 42
---
THIS. 
---
Every good nurse main I know hasn’t really had a problem with the changes. To be honest, they could all consistently get 4Ks with even just her base power. I think she’s still top-tier easily, and her add-ons are way more diverse and interesting now.
---
I have been seeing an influx of Ghostfaces
---
and killers should expect for survivors to loop them because you know...WE WANT TO SURVIVE.
---
**No kidding, I had a few killers tunnel and camp me because I looped them for too long.**
---
It's actually Booette and it's already a thing
---
STOP
---
That’s way too powerful. You do understand trapper’s traps are way more powerful than hag’s right?
---
Okay but hatch doesnt spawn for 4 surv until all gens are done. A killer isnt playing well by that point
---
Moris are cool though. Like, I know they're not fair, but the game would be much blander without each killer getting to let loose and kill in a cool way
---
[Nice Repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dpd0nn/guess_youll_die/?st=k2lcqx6w&amp;sh=0e56c88a)
---
Then there's the Red Rank SWFS he's probably referring to that let people hang until last second saves before the next state or death and maximize generator time etc. Some games the survivors seem omnipotent haha
---
#There is another.
---
No
---
What did he say?
---
Also, it seems as this sub is composed of 90% boomers that have never used reddit before. One can't make a joke without being dragged to hell with downvotes, like, come on, man..
---
It still isn't that reasonable considering you need Head On and not everyone wants to buy a character for one perk or hope that it's in the shrine.
---
Some of these challenges look pretty difficult to complete, for example:
---
"Unhook 3 survivors after the Endgame Collapse has begun. Must unhook them safely. Complete this challenge in a single trial"
---
"Sacrifice 3 survivors during the Endgame Collapse using the perk Hex: No one Escapes Death. Complete this challenge in a single trial"
---
"Hook 5 survivors in the basement using the perk Agitation. Complete this challenge in a single trial"
---
"Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement. Complete this challenge in a single trial"
---
A lot of these can result in very frustrating close calls where you almost get it, then someone barely gets away or ruins your chance. We'll have to see when they release :P
---
DOOR STUCK! DOOR STUCK!
---
I’m curious to see how it goes honestly before any changes to the actual objectives are made. 
---
That being said, I feel like 60k of a reward isn’t really that substantial given the difficulty and time investment of these challenges. By comparison, kill-by-hand dailies give out 60k and they’re very easy to knock out in a single game.
---
I did it for him as a tribute until he gets back
---
Why does everyone on reddit reply with a post that they think will make them sounds smart and get them upvotes, but in reality it just makes them look like idiots?
---
I’ve never actually tried trapper. I’ve played every killer except him. Is he fun to play as?
---
yeah, definitely some tweaks. I tried playing her last night and it's just awful, The recharge wait time for her blinks and her slow movement speed is disgusting, idk how she could be so bad in chases
---
Take a break.  
---
That's my advice. I have a rule, if I have 3 frustrating games in a row, i take a break. Do something else for a few hours, maybe a day or two. You'll come back relaxed and ready. It might not improve your gameplay, but it'll help your mental health my friend.
---
Stolen meme you minge
---
And she has a racial advantage because she straight up blends in with the environment while everyone else is white as hell.
---
My idea would be maybe only two lockers on the map designated for iri heads only. Each locker gives you 5 iri heads for a total of 10 in a single match. The thing with addons like these for killers is that their suppose to be op/match defining addons. However doing this wouldn’t necessarily nerf the addon itself because obviously a good huntress can get max 2k from the addon and then have to use reg. hatchets to finish off last two survivors who are on final hook or however they would decide to use their iri heads. Still would be pretty op but would also add some sort of balance to it. (Maybe even 5 lockers designated for iri heads and the first two hatchets you get are the iri heads next 3 are normal. So killer doesn’t feel like they have to spend all their iri heads in one go) then again I mean idk. Still pretty new to the game lmaoo
---
I've seen many suggestions for how Trapper should gather his traps but one thing's for sure; forcing him to walk across the map (especially on massive maps like Red Forest) just to be able to *use* his power is stupid. Trapper is the only Killer in the game who has to "gather" his power (yes Killer like Plague have to get parts of their power around the map but they're still playable without it), and is also still the only Killer in the game who can have his power **permanently** removed from the game. (Well, not "permanently" but for a long period of time.) (Yes you can remove Hag traps but you need a specific item to disarm them, and you can't sabotage them like you can with Trapper's traps.)
---
I've seen a lot of suggestions to let Trapper get his traps from Lockers and I think that would be a good compromise. It would add more use to lockers against Trapper and would give him some more use with niche perks like Iron Maiden. It would also mean that he'd still have to change his patrol routes and spend time gathering traps but he'd no longer be forced to walk across the map to get his power. Of course getting his power from lockers isn't a flawless idea, and there could be other options to use.
---
As for his pink addons: I have actually personally suggested that Iridescent Stone should be baseline. Thing is that adding these addons to Trapper's base would be an insane power boost, and require a lot of work to make sure it didn't feel unfair. (Not least of which being that Trapper would need new Ultra Rares.) Yes Trapper isn't *insane* with his URs and it's not like we're proposing Iridescent Heads or Fragrant Tuft of Hair be baseline, but it would still be really strong and can't just be implemented without tact and grace.
---
Trapper needs a lot of work is just the point. His lack of buffs beyond "can place traps faster" is aggravating but understandable. Reworking him wouldn't be as hard as Freddy but it would still require work.
---
Dediservs aren’t on console
---
Why only 2 traps?? When Amanda can carry 4?
---
Also, picking up traps shouldn't be like finding needle in a haystack.
---
And third placing traps can take time but it shouldn't be such a huge animation that anybody from across the map who can see you can spot it. It should be like you drop the map with a subtle a movement and it sets it self up in 3-5 seconds.
---
i can't wait to play him, i am still in the unlocking teachables phase which is so damn hard now that 2x bp is over :( sadly he doesn't have good perks so i will level him only after i finish with Ghostface, plague, trapper and huntress. They are the only ones i have left
---
You talk as if the spirit can see you while phasing, isn’t also guessing where you are going, or when you’re standing in front of a pallet waiting to slow vault and the spirit phases wrongly to the other side. Ok dude, simple, that’s the nature of her power, people who played spirit need to adapt to it and it’s not easy on them either. They don’t get information like other killers do about the survivor. That’s a huge downside too. And guess what, this spirit shit show only started to emerge after the nurse manage to get nerfed to the ground. A few weeks back nobody would be saying oh I much rather face a spirit than a nurse. Nobody gets free hooks or kills or escapes. When the spirit first came out, nobody could use her because no killer mains feel comfortable not seeing the survivor in a chase. Now that the killer mains learnt how to handle that, it’s the survivors mains time to learn.

there is one big issue I have, recharging of blinks stops if you are charging up a blink, it fucks with my timing so much.

thank you, it's glorious :') do you think he'll add this one to his collection when he comes back or ignore it since he didn't comment on it?

Detectives Hunch is on the shrine right now
---
This is just a repost of an older shitpost tier list except remade onto an uglier tier list format.
---
laurie? girls a survivor for sure but she ain't no fucking freak of nature like those 2
---
What's your rank?  
---
Anyway, I try to alternate with survivor here and there to mix it up. I've also been running Ruin and Devour Hope. Typically, they can't find one of the two which makes for an interesting game.
---
Thanks. I did take a break for a few months and my game improved. Maybe a few days away from the game won’t be bad
---
Let’s be honest what could the be trying to come up with originally
---
He is, but his power takes up valuable time, i.e fetching unused traps, resetting sprung traps, moving traps to new locations. It could also just be more effective in general, and like the guy in the picture said, the RNG thing is pretty dumb.
---
Yeah same for me. Survivor queue times are much worse than killer.
---
That would be nice. Help with the grind
---
No you didn't.
---
Yeah... this is why I switched to Corrupt Intervention...
---
I honestly find him incredibly relaxing to play, and he does also feel very rewarding when played well. But every now and again you just place your traps in a location where the Survivors never go, get genrushed to shit, or (heaven forbid) go up against that *one asshole* who's running either Object of Obsession or Saboteur and just have to shrug and go "guess I lose" and DC.
---
Trapper is a character entirely based on player v.s. player skill as opposed to cheap bullshit gimmicks which is why I love him, but he's a huge feast-or-famine character and sometimes you'll just get cucked by bad maps or lucky survivors. Nothing will make you want to smash your computer faster than getting fucking Gideon Meat Plant when you bring Tar Bottle for the 5th time in a fucking row.
---
I was rank 7 as killer but I slipped down to rank 9, though my Survivor rank is 4. I do get a lot of good survivors but it’s also because of my own slip-ups. I feel like I’m in a funk and I can’t snap out of it.
---
I’m the next step of the evolution: *loses* “GG 2 EZ 4 ME”
---
That's life!
---
I love when people just don’t understand jokes.
---
thanatophobia, they either spend the game with 16% slowdown or they cleanse alot more.
---
I understand the killer pain
---
Nurse is fine and still the best killer in the game and Spirit desperately needs it. As long as they stay the course of balancing things on both sides with the updates I'd say this is healthy.
---
you'll have bad days.  and yeah, just take a breather, watch a movie, an episode of a TV show, or if you're having it rough, try survivor, just do something different.
---
thats it..thats the sub..
---
I have over 2.3K hours on the game, so I might be overestimating the average skill of a player. Still though.
---
Oh, so he requires a bit of prediction and luck? Good thing I excel in both of those. I’ll give ol’ Mr Chuckles a try.
---
Yeah, people are stupid. I find they do better in red ranks, but you’re always gonna get potatoes. Sometimes I get to watch my friends (that are normally good at the game) make dumb decision after dumb decision and then laugh when they get tilted
---
Trapper is very different to Pig. The thing about being able to carry two traps is that it makes such a massive difference in your ability to deny loops in a chase and just generally keep map pressure high.
---
Do agree that the hitboxes for traps (in general, not just for picking them up) are bullshit and that the animation is rather ridiculous. One of the big issues with Trapper is that he's a pseudo-stealth Killer (need to be stealthy with your traps) and he's so "pronounced" with his presence. Survivors can see traps randomly spawn on the ground and instantly know "oh it's Trapper." And anyone who can see you will see your 3 second crouch animation while you place a trap. This is helped somewhat by bringing Whispers but that's one of your 4 perk slots, and people can still see you while out of Whispers range.
---
Tinkerer, bruh
---
Save some pussy for the rest of us please
---
Didn't say equivalent of 4 generators.
---
I can agree with increasing base time, even if it's indirectly, such as limiting toolboxes to hook and trap sabotage, but directly acting against SWF seems both tricky and controversial. Or you just mean multiple Survs on one gen?
---
Thank you, maybe I’ll take a day or two off to clear my head
---
Bruh me
---
'Killers sorted based on how loud their pussyfarts are'
---
Mods: "This is an affront to our glorious prophet McCote. It must be purged."
---
He’s a killer main that complains about everything survivors do what does he know
---
It's 3.5 more seconds.
---
What would his weapon and mori be? They could just make a Waluigi skin for Michael. I think that'd be appropriate, albeit not sure if they'd add the laugh.
---
I was thinking a bit different on certain addons
---
1. I play both sides equally when I can (though the wait times on killer often prevent me from playing it an equal amount to survivor. This makes sense given the game can't function without more survs than killers)
---
2. Anyone who tries to discredit or validate an opinion based entirely on what they or someone else "mains" is just showing that they're too narrow minded to think of a game from more than one "side".
---
Do me a favor and come back with a proper argument.
---
It's not a solution, but really just try to skip the post-game chat. You can try to compliment all you want, but people will still be toxic. Adjust your messages in steam to only friends and hopefully you can also do the same in consoles. No matter how GG I think a game is, I just really try to avoid the chance of a toxic post-game chat. It can really ruin the game for me.
---
Pretty much. Do you know what you said? You implied that keys are fair because they can offset the unfairness of a mori. We hear it all the time. “It’s fair for S to have X because K has Y”. Yet this is only true if the use of X and Y coincides. Otherwise it’s just doubly unfair. Look at the OP. The framing is that survivors often do not care about whether the killer was fair or not, they’ll still use the unfair shit they brought in. Similarly, killers often don’t care whether the group they’re about to face is going to be super toxic or not, they’ll bring and use the mori anyhow.
---
I can't remember where exactly but a Dev or someone said if a challenge required a DLC perk they'd put it up on the Shrine for a week during the rift if someone didn't have it already.
---
So yeah sort of unreasonable but eh.
---
Another repost
---
Maybe swap him for Myers. Same principle, less weird stuff to try to juggle.
---
Or Pig if you like crouching.
---
It can be, but I agree with the principle. It doesn't have to be exclusively used around hooks.
---
why on earth would I lie about something so stupid.
---
He’s definitely on par with the wraith right now and if you think otherwise then you’re delusional. He’s nowhere near as good as other killers and that’s not okay
---
&gt; They HAVE to die to the EGC.
---
Um, no, you can just hook and sacrifice them for it.
---
Thanks now I'm imagining meg fucking slam dunking trapper
---
The only thing broken for the old legion was the exploit with the deep wound, otherwise he was very fun to play.
---
They shouldn't have reworked him. They should've added some counterplay to his ability, like he cannot hear survivors in frenzy and survivors can hold the DP timer while running and force legion to apply multiple deep wounds and they would be fine. But they chose another way and made him the most boring killer in the game
---
Should have a side effect of Slippery that makes him lose traction and slide a tiny bit when stopping his sprint, like he does in some of the games.
---
The amount of times that has gotten me killed in the Super Mario Galaxy games smh
---
Use an alt account and tell them to use feng until they're used to skillchecks. Technician helped me and my friend a lot when learning skillchecks until we could consistently hit them
---
Not really…it makes people play like potatos not really funny to have them tbh.
---
You can try to press into them, which is a major reason people want collision during phase walk removed.
---
It's even worse when the person on the hook just kills themself immediately. I cant even be mad, honestly. It's not like they get anything out of staying.
---
Same here, happens mainly when I just put my ps4 in rest mode and then play again the next night. Or when I switch from survivor to Killer. Now I actually close the game and turn off my ps4 at night, and if switch rolls I close the game and restart. That seems to fix it for about 5-8 matches.
---
You mean impossibly hard or more unrealistic right?
---
Yes you’re biased. So it’s not happening. Things like unbreakable, decisive strike are all one time use only. A perk like this definitely falls into the same category. This is clearly not an exhaustion perk so it should be allowed to use repeatedly. Imagine having decisive strike, unbreakble and this. So the killer can’t tunnel you, can’t Mori you, can’t even leave you on the ground. You might as well just become the entity.
---
Ok, your rank is definitely high, so ignore my advice with Ruin/Devour Hope. I'm at Rank 14, and it seems to be a good place for me. Being merciful helps with keeping the rank low.
---
At the moment, I'm thinking of having a second account and play killers that I'm not familiar with when I'm having a bad time. I could just go easy with the survivors if I notice that they're new.
---
You don't really understand that term, do you?
---
I'm sorry pls don't hurt me
---
If you look on OPs profile it’s just a bunch of repost
---
You can complete the first page, at least, just with Survivor challenges, but if you want fast Rift progress, you'll have to get the Killer quest XP, too.
---
Tru just whines nowadays. I stopped taking him seriously when he tried to claim clown was stronger than huntress
---
But you have to get hit in the first place.  2% speed is more than enough to make many currently not infinites infinites.  Especially if vs a 110% killer.
---
Does shred still give stacks to it &amp; does the shred recovery benefit from the reduction% too?
---
Idea: Mulan cosmetic for Feng.
---
i really like your art style!
---
People invest their egoes in their performance in games, and when a game is unbalanced, they develop certain expectations or frustrations.
---
Survivors pretty much control matches, so when they lose, it's their fault, and that hurts to know, so they retaliate. Being at risk of that also makes them hostile in general.
---
Why not, easy kills, you can’t always have corrupt purge up
---
Looks good except the corrupt purge, but thats as a person who has never played or gon eagainst The PLAG
---
It's a crap shot, but you could talk to people in the lobby to find out who is doing which challenge.
---
Make it three traps and remove the downed if already injured part, and I'm sold.
---
What is the point of this post?
---
Nobody with an ounce of intelligence believes survivors shouldn’t gen rush.
---
Gen rushing doesn't exist.
---
Camping doesn't exist. 
---
Tunneling doesn't exist.
---
All that exists is strategies that can be good or bad depending on many factors.
---
Play your own game and don't let anyone else tell you what way is "right" or "wrong".
---
Killers - bbq, ruin, noed, and nurses. Why not add that in. Lolololol.
---
I originally wrote it that way. I think it'd be really cool in loops, but I wanted stuff to be realistic to implement, too.
---
Tks bro
---
It makes me feel really happy when I see the “we’ll make it” icon shows up
---
Am I the only one rooting for Jason
---
Tks mate
---
Bricky. He plays a lot of different games, but you'll find a lot of videos of him playing killer
---
I'd say Legion is better than Wraith, Doctor, Clown, Bubba and Demogorgon, but that's just me. I think Legion is a solid and viable mid tier killers. If you disagree with that then so be it, you're entitled to that opinion.
---
Otzdarva and Fungoose
---
Play a different killer or swap over to survivor or just play a different game. Run meme builds and just have fun. You don't have to sweat every second you're in a match.
---
Also, get thicker skin. It's a game and not that serious. Quit making it serious and you'll have more fun.
---
Or you realised too late that your situation is genuinely impossible to happen, as the hatch will never spawn with four survivors until all generators are done.
---
I'm more inclined to believe this version.
---
My rule of thumb is, if you got 4 gens before I get one hook, I'mma face camp lol.
---
I mean if you don't want to auto-lose you need to. And then you have to hope they have an add on to keep it or you need to tunnel the guy who picks it up too.
---
Yeah just report them if you're sure it's breaking one of the rules so a mod can check on it.
---
That’s on the team not the player for playing how they want to play,
---
Never assume dear it makes a ass of both of us
---
Interesting. When I was rank 18-20, I thought it was a good idea to lure killers to other players as a distraction. After playing for a while though, it seems better to lure them away from other players/gens, so the survivors can keep working on the generators.
---
This is why survivors complain about spirit, they dont want to change any of their perks
---
They are on switch.
---
I mean it makes more sense to heal someone BEFORE finishing the gen than after. Soon as that gen pops killer will be on their way and an injured survivor is pretty easy to find if you have a general idea as to their location
---
When they run half way arose the map so they can use self-care while the killer has sloppy butcher
---
You overestimate your own skill, things like "fully complete 4 gens in a single game" are outside of a players control.
---
Fuck prestige it's a horrible thing to do with no real benefit outside of cosmetics. It should never reward any real advantage because it's not a fun thing to do since it takes so long to do and to recover from doing.
---
&gt;Run Cut coin just to be a jerk
---
Tbh though out of all the offerings the killer coins are my least favorite
---
I mean, it's not like "reporting" does anything.
---
And even if it would, checking how many games you have played with another player should be trivial.
---
I mean, its a low tier perk. It shouldnt be buffed, nerfed, or removed. If they wanted to rework it into a different punishment for survivors not working totems, thats fine too.
---
I think the idea is that he can stack it way easier since it works with his power, and once stacked up it's really good. You could just run up and hit them in FF, then fatigue and chase them again, but the fatigue is like 4 second. FF could get you a hit through the first loop, but using STBFL could instead make sure they don't make it to the second one.  
---
  
---
Never tried it myself, but I've seen a few legions run it. Interesting idea anyways.
---
Ah terribly sorry. My stream is gzmo12 I was super into a chuck palahniuk novel when I made my reddit name :)
---
No it wouldn’t lol
---
What about a thing / shape-changer whose special makes him look safe. Keep the heartbeat (maybe?), give him an ability to look like any random survivor until one is sacrificed, then he looks like the most recent deader whenever he changes.
---
Hell, give him a win condition where he gets ufo parts if he kicks a gen that's already been advanced (but not finished) and with enough of them, he can build a personal ufo in the basement.
---
Nah. You almost always (I've seen bloodwebs without a single one, or two) get a pink node every level at high levels. 
---
Since Billy has no ultra rares this means you get an ebony mori every level.
---
Are you Satan? &lt;3
---
Instal DbD on an SSD and you will load to the lobby before anyone else and never see anything in chat if you don't want to.
---
That's fair. Can't say I don't disagree with prestige being worthless and not incredibly fun. I'm just trying to propose some possible ideas.
---
Can't be offended if you're dead.
---
How the fuck
---
I truly dont understand the problem people have with her. I dont think shes braindead like a lot of people say and she does have counterplay. Stop vaulting towards her or running towards her when shes standing still, pay attention to the shimmer she gets all over when shes actually phasing, etc. I agree with Tru3. The only major issue is Prayer Beads, they need to revert it to how it used to be.
---
Good for you. The discussion flair doesnt belong here.
---
matchmaking aims for +/- 6 ranks. This is, unfortunately, matchmaking working as intended...
---
Imagine putting enough stock in Youtube comments to try and reason with them
---
Can you use items found in chests?
---
Vittu
---
The community of this game is horrible. Just played a match as legion and got accused and reported for cheating. Want to know how I was cheating? I had no cooldown while swinging while I carried people. Guess rank 7 twitch streamers consider that cheating for using mad grit
---
This exactly. Idk why people have such an issue with her. She really does have more counterplay than people think but it seems like everyone just wants to bitch.
---
You got advice and I wasn't being rude. Like I said before, get thicker skin especially if getting advice YOU asked for gets you so worked up to the point of making assumptions. 
---
Maybe you should go hug a tree instead or try adding some more air to your artificial safe space bubble that you live in.
---
I just don't understand why you can't use the hatch... it baffles me!
---
There was... a lot wrong with old legion. I'm not saying current legion is perfect, but some of y'all really like to overhype how bad they are right now.
---
Having at least one other game I'm interested in has done a lot for my longevity in DbD. Some times you get a string of bad matches and you just need to take a break and let the desire to play build again.
---
Opens your chest cavity and screams into the abyss “WHERES THE LAMB SAUCEEE”
---
Don’t act like this is the communities fault. This is every single event. Do special gens, special hooks, profit. Now you just play and do the pretty gens for rewards. 
---
Even Hallowed Blight was just holding M1 on something other than a generator.
---
The developers just can’t think of anything but holding M1.
---
how was your shit?
---
No because  you  don’t apply even pressure if you tunnel good survivors then you will get owned because the other three will be doing gens
---
I can tell ya it isn’t always the matchmaking. It’s the toxicity or harassment.
---
we can discuss his shit
---
I don’t mind people who use Self-Care. 
---
But HOLY FUCKING SHIT. People who use Self-Care while the killer is chasing someone else instead of unhooking me. Even better: Sloppy Butcher. They spend all that time healing. And by the time they’re done, the other person gets hooked too, the killer finds the Self-Caring survivor who’s about to unhook me, they take a hit, unhook me, get downed, I get downed 10 seconds later. End of the match. 
---
Apply the same scenario to repairing the last gen. They just spend 60 seconds to self-care instead of helping me finish the last gen. 
---
Like. Why. Why do people do that?
---
Stop fucking reposting shit.
---
Good point, but in my experience finishing the major objective first works out better for everyone.
---
I hardly ever see a killer rush to a freshly completed generator, neiter do I do that when I play Killer myself.
---
It’s sad cus I killed 2 without tunneling or camping with 4 generators (other 2 were dead hook) still left so I wanted to be nice because there is no reason for me to kill the last 2 survivors. I thought letting at least the last survivor was proper killer etiquette. Guess not lol 😢
---
It's also just amazing how terrifying that must be for Shocker, who didn't see any of the buildup. Just one day, goofy wise-cracking Spider-Man is absolutely going to murder you with his bare hands.
---
Look at his profile. Nothing but reposts.
---
cause they didn't take it??
---
it's funny....?
---
its your time... I would stay away from the fog from now on if I were you.
---
So we're going to nerf keys like we nerfed insta heals now are we? What about those moris killers are running? Or NOED? Keys only work if survivors are on basis for a win or close to anyway. Moris are straight up bullshit, and NOED gives dog shit killers an easy 1-2 KC (yes I know getting totems is a combat, but when you're playing with 3 other randoms, that's literally impossible).
---
This community is so confused on what they want, that when they get it, they cry about another thing. Keys are fine.
---
Lol just stupid people not reading up on things. 
---
I got called a hacker for having fake pallets on Doctor. Also I had bbq and some survivor didn’t know what bbq was lol.
---
If you're near multiple survivors you can get hits on all of them much easier, and it means the survivors you do hit dont get as much distance because you can start moving again much faster after hitting them.
---
Again at top rank play there all good loopers and know when to commit to gens so tunneling with get you Owned
---
It feels special, right?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/druzud/frametime_and_framerate_issues_after_hardware/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
God forbid survivors to try surviving
---
lmao you really are thick aren't you? The stranger things PTB had the dedicated servers in it for like 3 days and they got removed, why? TECHNICAL ISSUES. They were not ready then for a global release and they certainly arent fucking ready now. Like i said, for ME, in AUSTRALIA, during the PTB they were perfect, but now in Australia, im getting what America got during the PTB, an issue they CLAIM to have resolved before releasing it to the main branch of the fucking game. They had their time to test, internally and through its playerbase, they had MULTIPLE testing phases and every time the results came back that they were good in some places and trash in others, so they delayed release. What about this do you not get? THEY NEVER GOT IT WORKING PROPERLY SO SHOULD HAVE NEVER RELEASED IT AND THEY STILL HAVENT TAKEN THEM BACK OUT! Fucking morons man i swear its like smacking your face with a damn brick.
---
Don't we all let this slip away a lot?
---
I never played to be toxic so I just played and after playing him enough I just got so used to him I could do better and get more consistent kills.
---
I was playing as hag yesterday and I was trying to do a daily mission (teleport and hit) so I was just chasing the last survivor around for a bit, hoping she’d trigger a trap. After I while, she wasn’t anywhere near my traps so I downed her and she landed a pretty far away, not even facing the direction I hit her.
---
the joke is about a Rift mission, which is to heal two survivors with the Perk Empathy
---
...the switch is a console.
---
Make a video using it on nurse. Checkmate ;)
---
&gt;Get thicker skin for what reason though?
---
After going over other replies to you, I didnt say anything different than what was already posted but I'm the only one you wanted to call rude. Obviously you have paper thin skin if what little I did say got under it badly enough to assume what I said was rude.
---
&gt;imply that I take this game too seriously 
---
It's not an implication. It's a direct statement based off of the things YOU posted. If you're not having fun with the game and constantly losing and it bothers you to the point that you fell like you've hit a wall and can't win... you know... things YOU posted. Then quit trying to be such a try hard and just have fun with the game or find a different one to play.
---
It was quite a while back tho. Maps got brighter (all survivors were Blendettes at the time, lol), some killer animations got sped up and I’m not sure if pallet vacuums were still a thing.
---
and if the surivor even thinks about not being injurged for 20 minutes just give the plague a gun
---
I killed a Dwight because I had to kill someone during Endgame and I knew I'd never have the chance again but I liked him so much
---
Stop being a shithead. This guy is on Xbox and there aren’t dediservers on Xbox
---
I meant 2 survivors (or more) working on one generator in general. Not specifically SWF.
---
A generator takes about 84 seconds to complete standard solo. This is reduced to 44 seconds with 2 survivors currently. Less with 3 etc.
---
Maybe it wouldn't be needed with an increase to gen time. It's just, in all honesty, when people complain about gens popping so quick at the start of the game I feel it is usually down to survivors working on gens in pairs. 
---
The main problem I see as killer is that the only real challenge is competing against the full squad of 4 survivors, and this is only really a challenge with a coordinated team completely focused on working on generators. In this scenario, the survivors can get the generators done faster than a good killer playing fair can get all the hooks. Specifically if the hooks are evenly spread over the 4 survivors. It only goes the killers way if they are not evenly spread and you happen to find one survivor more often than the others in which case you get an early kill with a gen or two left to do and take control.
---
In contrast though, 3 survivors or less do not get gens completed. Will not get the generators completed. Try all they might. They can't. They are wasting their time. I know I will kill them all. I know they have no chance, and it is boring.
---
its decent
---
most of the time its worst
---
all the survivors are 10 ranks better from you
---
Bbq, nurses, when a gen pops, whispers (cannot see but know their area, and Micheal has shit he can see threw walls lol. Their are tons. But it's okay, we will act like I'm lying. Yes they should be stronger, but we should also have perks to give us a chance at survival as well,  because you see just as your objective is to kill mine is to survive.
---
I don't get it, I go up 1 level basically every match, why does it take that long for you?
---
Is my system bugged?
---
Oh god another person that dislikes jump scares especially cheap ones &lt;3 
---
Do you hate the conjuring series as well? Lol.
---
All the killers can break the physics of the game if you work hard enough. Don't blame players, blame the game. Ya'll toxic ass people need to chill. As a survivor main I have to say, survivor mains are the worst and most toxic players. All ya'll ever do is complain! Maybe you should stop being a baby and take your own advise. Grow up. Just move on to the next round like the rest of us.
---
They are all situational, and you don't see auras every time a gen pops unless you run bitter murmur, and even then it's within a certain radius of the popped genny.
---
But that applies regardless of what happens. Killers are one entity and Survivors are four, and with few exceptions, Killers can only hinder or attack one person at a time. They invariably must sacrifice their time.
---
Altruists make for easy picks when pursuing just one target, and tunnelling doesn't include camping. Once one person is hooked, you can pressure others.
---
You're also suggesting absolutely braindead tunnelling, to the point where you'd apparently be bodyblocked by other Survivors. Obviously you'll take convenient nearby hits; you just CHASE your main target, who will logically be the weakest looper.
---
Survivors also can't fight. You say "they'll be ready" like they don't still go down in two hits or less, or like cleansing against Plague is a good idea.
---
If I was in this situation I’d be scream crying with my friends asking me if I’m okay when we escaped. And yesterday heartrate would be over 100 bpm
---
I think 8:2 is a little much. It's already hard enough dealing with 4 as a single killer.
---
Maybe something like 6:2 would be better, with who-the-fuck-knows how many gens
---
Just use the shroud of separation, except nobody ever uses that.
---
a bs one thats got u salty hehehe
---
That's exactly what i'm saying. Why do you think i put quotation marks around competitive?
---
That's what I meant,  and those are all perks they run. Bt only good when killers are camping,  ds only good when killers are tunneling, adrenaline only good if we do all 5 gens,  like they are the same situational? Soooo.
---
Well, at top play Killers barely have a chance, anyway. It doesn't matter if they tunnel or disengage; SWFs are broadcasting the Killer's actions to their team.
---
jigly improbable not imposible, but you have to do it within 2 weeks or so at the same time you have other missions of almost the same degree of improbabillity.
---
I would buy this game in a HEARTBEAT if they added a Shining pack.  It just seems like a natural:  Jack as the killer with his axe, Wendy and Mr. Hallorann or Mr. Ullman as the victims, and part of the Overlook and the Hedge Maze as the map.   I'm actually rather surprised they haven't already.  Maybe it's a rights thing.
---
No game sense whatsoever. Doesn’t matter the rank, the average survivor is just shit. There are average shit survivors and then really good, above average survivors. There is no middle ground. 
---
I classify being a good survivor by being able to loop the killer well. Any monkey can hold M1 on a gen. And b4 “running in circles isn’t skill” most people who say this are killer mains that go down in 20 seconds as survivor or throw pallets way too early. Being able to take unique pathing in chase to lose the killer is something I don’t see many do. Just the average vault the window and throw the pallet during bloodlust. No moves taken to cycle between jungle gyms and preserve pallets.
---
*generic git gut response*
---
Timing is strict. They made it once that no matter when in the pick-up animation you blind them, they would drop the survivors, and it was during the time when pick up took ages and flashlights were amazing
---
Many killers quit the game until that got changed back. After a few hours from this patch, finding a survivor match got impossible
---
Ok, I get it you are angry, but instead of being stupid, try to think. Just few seconds won't hurt
---
They haven't released them yet. They are still doing tests. Only on switch there are servers, probably set on a Nintendo agreement or something, but other consoles doesn't have it and as far as I know, neither Europe have them.
---
Especially in Australia they have to run tests for servers, due to its location. So, dude, just be patient and post feedback, not rant.
---
I'm the first one to shot on BHVR when they do something like I did shit on them for the battle pass, this ain't the case tho chief. They have potato coders so it needs time to replenish bananas and keep them working on it. There's a reason why they postponed it to fall
---
Anyone know if console will get dedicated servers, and if so, when?
---
Kill rushing KEKW
---
"I'll Tier 2 for you sweetie!"
---
-stalking noises-
---
Nurse is still the best in the game, the nerf didn't change her ability to ignore obstacles and looping. The only thing the change hurt was people who couldn't play without her busted add-ons.
---
Trapper is currently my main at red/purple ranks and has been for a while, you can get absolutely shit on by SWF but its still the most fun ive had with this game in a long time (especially basement trapper). 
---
He def needs some help though, its so disheartening for you to trap 3 people almost at once and all of them get out near instantly, have no default bag. I think he should also be able to reset traps instantly (when out of a chase) instead of having to pick them back up and put them down (theyd have to fix the weird shift in the trap placement when it traps somebody though too)
---
It looks like shit
---
I feel for my friend. Every time she decides “hey I’ll try this again” she gets found first. Meanwhile I run deliverance constantly and rarely get found first. And I play aggressively most of the time.
---
By aggressively I mean accidentally running into the killer and then crying as they chase me until I get downed.
---
mate you're just taking the piss, fuck off if you are gonna be a cunt for literally no reason. Trying to get something that fixed that has made the game unplayable for over a month and you're just being a twat.
---
Also the battlepass is nothing but good, bonus BP for just playing the game and littlr chibii like charms? How is that fucking bad? Fuck outta here.
---
The same thing already happens with doctor’s screams, but yea, you vomit too often for that
---
holy shit that's spot on. The text was good but the narrator needed to respect periods.
---
Expressing salt after a bad game would be my guess
---
When I plan to give someone the hatch, they forfeit that by not struggling. I commend those who always fight.
---
As a huge Malcom fan I love it! However, I can't let the first perk name for Malcolm slide. It's Krelboyne not Crowl Boy.
---
Spirit became already popular before the Nurse nerf. Mostly because she is easier to get into than her. 
---
And Devs are trying to balance things out etc. Even though they don't address gen speed directly and try to shorten chases instead with map changes/reworks, or getting rid of problematic tools like instaheals. Playing Killer has become much more enjoyable over a couple of months. 
---
And how fast I get a Lobby as a survivor is fine currently compared how it used to be. A little bit time dependend. Normally I have fast killer and slow survivor lobbies in the evening, while it's the other way the rest of the day. Back in july we even had a long time period where killers always waited for an eternity, because we were lacking survivors.
---
Was it PWYF it didn't stack for? I remember pig's dash being nerfed for something recently. I could be very confused though.
---
The walking dead died when carl died shit show now
---
Considering how long the pickup animation is...
---
Just no. There was once a time where what you said is exactly how the game worked. Everybody hated it.
---
I’m quite sure it would end up like in every single game ever - people won’t use it anyway
---
Oh heck sorry I'll fix that
---
Do you play on xbox? I do that frquently as long as the killer isn't toxic and I'm not doing a daily. Sometimes I also don't do it if I literally have 0 escapes after several matches.
---
I know it's because I don't have any stuff for the trapper, because I don't really like him, so I don't invest into his bloodweb, but his power feels like a burden. Starting with one trap, and having to walk around the map is ass. Meanwhile the hag gets 10 Phantasm traps with no add one and are easier to set in chase. Plus they active from a pretty far distance even without add ons
---
Oh shi- I saw that post before let me...
---
*I can't find it.* F
---
What did you do while taking a shit? Sometimes I play hearthstone or if I’m listening to music I’ll shit and listen.
---
Don’t forget to wipe your ass mate. 
---
How long have you been taking a shit for? 
---
Have you ever had to shit so badly that when you shit your butt feels good. Same goes for pissing. 
---
Did water spray you?
---
I don’t think there is an effective way of using no mother =P
---
They need to completely rework the perk imo
---
I liked the story but the "scary part" was meh. I prefer creepy movies, that make people "stay awake" at night for the creeps they got. Thoughts that are imprinted in your mind and feel something watching you still
---
That kind of movies are good. Those jumpscares ones, that are so trendy recently, are thriller at best.. I haven't see a decent horror movies for so long, the best ones are still the Japanese, and actually french ones too I discovered recently
---
This kind of fear never got me much on this game. Just at the beggining, then after 2 games I just saw the killer getting looped and all the "magic" got destroyed instantly
---
Gosh, I wonder why...
---
Original creators must be sad seeing your profile
---
What do you want them to do? Remove Swf? Like I get it can be annoying but learn to counter that shit. I mean I play swf and, let me tell you, we get our asses handed to us. I survive better on my own but all my friends are high ranks. So, it isn't all swf. Can't blame the many for a few.
---
Me: SAY SOMETHING! 
---
Michael: *Breathing*
---
Me: Ahhh 2018 reference love it&lt;3
---
As a trapper main i approve this message lmao
---
Me too! ^_^
---
You made it out like killers can see survivors 24/7 when in reality it's only when certain events trigger it, and aura reading perks aren't even top tier for killer.
---
And? All OP said is people hating on dedicated servers and you replied they’re not on console. They’re on switch which is a console so the hate isn’t exclusively PC. People forget this.
---
I laughed out loud, ngl. I could understand if it was EGC and he was camping to secure a kill, but to immediately facecamp in the first minute of the game, facecamp every single person you hook after that, fail to kill anyone, get genrushed, and then DC after failing to get a kill yet again?
---
I went ahead and bought it on steam and my experience was a thousand times better!
---
One of the few times negative karma should be given out.
---
I still have de ja vu on my blood web for feng as the last perk thats on the bloodweb for her
---
I'm being a cunt when you insulted me when I just tried to explain? Of course I'm not gonna respect you after you do that, what you expect?
---
I see, so you are okay with a f2p system in a pay to play game but cry about tests for dedicated servers. Ok, I can ignore any opinion you have on anything
---
As someone who plays killer and survivor I think the real problem with keys is more the way they feel to play against. As a killer it’s just so frustrating as it seems keys become stronger in a game the better the killer plays. Killers hate them because it’s when you’re dominating a team and feel you deserve the 4 man that the key comes into play and lets a few survivors have a free win.
---
I also disagree with your point about the hatch being easier to find for killer as while it may be easier to find if survivors stop playing the objective and just look for hatch then its almost impossible for the killer to find them as long as they play it safe. Survivors get a warning the killer is near where as as far as he knows they could be anywhere. It doesn’t matter how long it takes them to find it because they can just hide whenever they hear the heartbeat and the killer will never find them until they eventually find the hatch.
---
No backsies!
---
It's 1xp per second. 500xp takes 500 seconds which is significantly less than 600 seconds (ten minutes). Matches absolutely do not take 20-25 minutes between unless you only queue during off-peak hours as killer, and if so.. idk what you expect.
---
"You let this survivor go and let me die? Reported for teaming" excuse me, im quite sure i was the killer and I get to choose who gets mercy and who doesnt. Not my damn issue that you dont like it and see it as reportable. As far Im concerned, any person who reports me for teaming are just salty and think they are right in some regard.

Insulted you? Na mate stated a fact, if you took offence thats on you, also means my fact was just that, it clearly had some truth to offend you. But regardless what you were trying to explain was wrong, im assuming you have no idea just how many times or for how long the dedicated servers have been tested for. The fact of the matter is they were not ready for the live branch of the game, they said they will not release them till they are ready thats why they were delayed till AFTER the Stranger Things DLC launched on the live branch, and even though they openly admitted they weren't ready, they still released it to the live branch. Thats the biggest issue, they KNEW it wasnt ready and still did it and now refuse to fix it or give us any sort of updates on the matter.
---
Also the fuck you talking about F2P system in a pay to play game? What you don't like that you have to pay for the pass? Aww is big baby gonna fucking cry? Considering the pass is the same price as most good cosmetics, and you only need to buy the pass ONCE for the rest of time as long as you don't spend your auric cells, its a perfectly fucking sound investment. Skins, bonus blood points, some story/lore, what is not to like about that? Should we buy it RIGHT NOW even though the game is still very broken and they refuse to fix it? No, but is it a good way to support the devs? Yes, and theres no issue with that. If you don't want to spend $10 just ONCE for the rest of time, and get cool things, don't do it, but just because YOU DONT LIKE IT doesn't mean its a bad thing or make my opinions invalid. You are proving my point about how thick you are mate just stop while you can.
---
Most likely not but if they tapped into horror comics that would be cool. 
---
But I don’t think there’s much of horror comics and i don’t think they are that popular if there’s horror comics. 
---
But from interwebs bone doesn’t look like a horror comic so most likely not. 
---
But in dreams within dreams scarecrow from batman would be a cool killer.
---
hollup. the timer stops when the pig is near you?
---
I would honestly at that point just be pissed off, and then scream crying as he chased me and I felt real fear.
---
I don’t even want to go to an open exit gate and look, because I know the survivors will be teabagging the second they see me.
---
It should, but you're approaching the issue logically, which is wrong. You're supposed to approach it like a survivor main. So, everything is tunneling, everything is camping, and everything that doesn't hand you a free win is unfair.
---
Ayyyyyyy Xbox master race west coast best coast
---
They don’t want Viable killers. Viable killers don’t allow survivors to have fun stomping killers. That’s why they nerfed Nurse, and now Spirit. Billy is next on the chopping block.
---
I like Moris because then the game actually feels like a horror game. Seeing that first person being morid just stops me in my tracks and completely changes the way I play. Main objective: survive...
---
I mean even if that wasn’t a problem the killer would still down you. 
---
The fix doesn’t seem needed and out of everything in the game I think this should be the last thing on the devs minds. 
---
Unless UNLESS of course I read everything wrong.
---
Oh yeah I forgot
---
I would love to see the perks have the "lore" text and the actual effects separated because now I have to read through the text to get to the effects
---
Yeah, killers don't feel very dangerous otherwise.
---
Both of my teammates escaped at least

Description. Soooo I have the perk We’re Gonna Live Forever and I will get all four stacks, but the BP don’t get added post trial or at all :/
---
Steps To reproduce: I’ve noticed that this usually occurs when I add any offering that increases BP on a single Category such as the Fragrent Primsose Blossom which gives me more Altruism BP, but it’s occurred with other offerings and even without any :/ 
---
Reproduction rate: It’s actually happened quiet a bit, and it’s not exclusive to one survivor, it’s happened to me with David and Claudette :/
---
I run the one that increases the time to search the box and the one that punishes you for missing a skillcheck. it can be deadly because most of the time you will down them near or during a box but if they land skillchecks it doesn't do as much.
---
Damn your whole account is just reposts...
---
Im still waiting for bloodpoints for getting camped to survival category
---
I’m sorry don’t take this as an insult but what did you do? 
---
I just saw a poor hatchet throw and a good deadhard while getting the exit open. 
---
Seems kind of like a normal type game.
---
I haven’t thought about that comic series in years. It’s pretty great, and is nostalgic
---
The real situation where keys are frustrating to play against is when survivors ARNT on the basis for a win. 
---
The killer can have two survivors dead and two more on death hook with two gens left. In this situation the killer is dominating the team but if they have a key the two survivors left get a free win.
---
This is so frustrating to go up against as the killer as with two escapes you probably won’t even black pip even tho you had to work your ass off to get to that point.
---
Keys are not fine.
---
And right before you get hit, baby feng destroys haunted ground in distance...

*Spoiler* No they fucking dont

I reckon Windows Of Opportunity should show fake pallets in a different aura tbh.

Give the perk a buff to make it viable at all
---
The doors were next to one another and I was just glad to be able to help my homies escape
---
Ok bud, take a chill pill
---
and it tastes like shit.
---
I don’t see a video sorry
---
Its the timing. You wanna start flashing them when they are hoisting the survivor onto their shoulder. I recommend going into a kill your friends and trying it a few times to get the hang of it.
---
I'd honestly rather the option be available but unused, with the game balanced around it than unavailable and the game balanced around a lack of communication despite outside communication being prevalent.
---
Ahhh well congrats mate! 
---
I do think bvhr shouldn’t let doors spawn by each other. Especially with a god huntress or just a average billy.
---
Wack, thanks for telling me, uploaded from pc, guess I’ll try again on mobile
---
You're sick!
---
&gt; Well, at top play Killers barely have a chance, anyway
---
And you want to make it even harder for killers, interesting
---
Iv made a lever throw from further than that before 😂 felt amazing
---
No that’s not toxic at all. 
---
You can’t be mad at that, I thought you where going to do some toxic shit but that’s not it. 
---
Even if you where toxic I’d give a slide due to giving GF a taste of his own medicine.
---
Yo I really dig how Laurie looks! Don't get me wrong, all of them look great, but Laurie just looks above and beyond imo
---
If you submit it to BHVR on their support forum they will definitely review it, and that can result in a ban.
---
But just clicking the button in game does nothing, submitting a ticket with video attached is a way to get someone banned if they do something that ACTUALLY breaks the rules. 
---
In this case, no ban will come from it lol.
---
I mean to an extent this is literally the case. If no one is doing a gen, why leave the hook and give a free rescue, especially against a SWF that are going to coordinate the save. It’s a two way street, survivors can’t blame the killer for not playing the game and then not play the game themselves. Do gens and apply pressure to the killer, and force them to leave. No killer walks into a game with the mindset of being happy with one kill. If the killer is so desperate for a kill that he’s going to hard camp, then yeah it sucks for the guy on the hook but it’s also a boring game for the killer. If everyone else leaves, he’ll learn that it’s a bad strategy and adapt over time.
---
Err..... NO.
---
Using the spirit, naw
---
The killer should be able to hea people getting in and out of lockers
---
Definitely not toxic, you can see the ghostface trying to go for the weaker survivors when you were body blocking him. I’m glad you guys escaped because campers are no fun.
---
I’ve been finding a lot of the Halloween items in chests rather than my bloodweb.
---
The teabag was for Meg to let me heal her but of course they’re always skittish
---
I mean yeah at that point you're going to take the hit anyways and if you want to hide in lockers to consider running Head On (as big as a meme it is) to prevent being grabbed.
---
Would it be nice to take a hit instead of being grabbed? sure as you could still be chased while injured if you exited while Healthy.
---
Is it a big priority? not really.
---
Did I understand the OP? I don't freaking know.
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
I will never understand the BP rewards in this game. It doesn't make any sense. Usually i wouldn't care because the game itself is fun but it is so dependent on grinding and leveling and getting bloodpoints that it just feels messy in that regard.
---
He’s sick for doing something a human does regularly... lol what.
---
Pairs are strong, but toolboxes are stronger. It's most efficient for Survivors to work on gens alone with Mechanic's toolboxes, barring Prove Thyself, which isn't meta (or a perk I've ever seen used by anyone else).
---
Killer is a challenge in general. It's basically a continuous time trial, except coordinated teams make the time something like 5 minutes.
---
But yes. The reason the top-tier Killers are who they are is because of how vital mobility is. Nurse, Spirit, Freddy, and Billy all place well because they can compensate for Survivors spreading out.
---
And yeah, 3 survivors slash that factor. It's not COMPLETELY hopeless for them, but the genspeed is the least of their weaknesses when down a player. Matches easily snowball after one kill by the 3 gen mark.
---
I mean yes i want the Xeno But, we've had enough Licensed characters for a while
---
Fuck it ill gladly take on every game as a swf if it means we can finally balance around optimal play.
---
Jfc is there a way to hide specific flairs? Tired of seeing this 100 times a day 😫
---
 So, I some how managed to glitch Dbd and instead of being referred to the 1st level of the archive, I am referred to the 4th level. I attached picture of what the web looks like, but I also have screen shots of what each challenge requires. I can type them out or attach screen shots of all of the challenges. Lmk!

No. I don't. Why are people illiterate? I tried my best to make it clear that this was a raw concept for discussion, NOT a suggestion. There's a Suggestion flair. I used the Discussion flair. I mentioned that this would require counterbalances. If you're not going to read what I'm saying, don't @ me.

&gt; Blight hooks work the same for killers except theres 4 base.
---
Uh, no. Not at all.
---
"**NOTE:** During the Event, **1 default Cankerous Hook** and **1 default Cankerous Generator will spawn on the Map.**"
---
Just because I chose who gets to die or live doesn't mean I'm teaming up with them.
---
This is such a heartfelt post!  I'm still sorta new to the game myself (had it about a month and a half now).  While I'm not too put off by the times I do see extremely immature/toxic behavior or comments, because it's in any community honestly, I do wish there were more people with your kind of attitude.
---
I've been branching out and trying to play more killer recently, cuz when I first tried it I was so dang awful.  It's always a better feeling tho, when someone says that they enjoyed the match or even tries to give you tips, versus saying something rude or silly.  I try not to worry too much about winning or losing and really to just have fun with the match, and react to what's happening.  Whether that means goofing with survivors if some teammates dc for no reason, or just trying my best to spook them, some people just can't have fun if they aren't winning I suppose.  Anyway, have a great day! :)
---
Alright this has been posted about 20+ times mate a lot of people know. 
---
(Not trying to be rude or sound rude)
---
Oh ok zoomer
---
I got the notice and it stated “US players only”
---
Yikes in Australian
---
&gt; or items for it
---
Imagine getting a character to P3 and all perks. With the same 2-3 phrases (at best) for purchase. Horror game, no doubt.
---
I have also got this glitch, and literally posted about it just now also. The challenges are a lot harder which I’m glad about
---
Browsing reddit while waiting for a match but forgetting to get ready
---
Literally every 2 minutes or less this gets posted
---
does someone know when they gonna drop the ghostface skin?
---
Because it’s a master challenge and they copy pasta the sentence for every master challenge.
---
She most likely hid on the outside of the shack you closed hatch walked over to the doors heard Meg crying on hook after she was sacrificed which is a new bug in the recent Halloween patch and someone used a key on the hatch, no bbq because she was too close
---
r/cursedcomments
---
A cool trick you could do is when someone’s running away from you that you caught in the corner of your eye is to have your back to them and then use the ability to go get them. 
---
That way they think they are safe when in all reality they aren’t.
---
But those are all if you were forced to play as a tunneller with Survivors being buffed per death, right? Because my point was kind of that tunnelling would be DIScouraged by this mechanic, since you want to deny them that buff until they're all near death.
---
And again, this would need to be counterbalanced. Killers are already the weak side. The idea is that a large Survivor buff like this would have its own merits, but ALSO allow a large Killer buff that expands their gameplay options.
---
Oh, it happened to me, and I didn't know it was happening to a whole bunch of people.
---
Template for the marge Myers?
---
I just roll my eyes and let the toxic players not get to my head
---
You go first no you go first no you go first no you go first.
---
Legion gets stacks easier than pretty much any other killer, and once it's max stacked you play more effectively as a pure-M1 killer than chasing with your power.
---
And if their team is just staying injured, well it sucks to be them. That just makes your game easier.
---
Yeah, ghostface is so inconsistent that at this point I don't even understand how breaking him out works any more
---
I dont like the killer challenges. It promotes unfun play. I main killer and i dont wanna have to play basement bubba until i get lucky enough to 4k or throw the game to pull off a cheeky NOED blood warden combo. These arent challenges, they arent testing your skill theyre testing your lucky and your willingness to play like scumbag.
---
So by your logic moris are a free escape?
---
On ps4 there is n post game chat
---
Why does everyone play this again and again?
---
XD the man himself. Thanks for telling me.
---
Yeah I saw your post about it. It’s a strange glitch but I’m thankful it exists. Now we know it will be more challenging to complete the archives and have a good reward for it.
---
I like it more the Japanese version more since it has a proper storyline. Is creepy more due to her backstory than her look alone
---
Not many American horrors are decent, I liked a lot stuff like "Rec" for example, that is American I think. That kind of movie, "found tape" style is interesting if well executed. Of course they exaggerated and made a fk ton of trash movies with that style but there are also hidden pearls too
---
That's why maybe dbd is lacking. I get more scared as killer than survivors due to very limited FoV while as survivor I can see whatever is around me in few moments. There's a reason why the scarier killer is Myers, I think. He doesn't really jumpscare you, he just look at you from afar and when you notice him, it's creepy how he stares at you without doing anything flashy.
---
Just looks at you blending with the background and shit your pants. Which is still pretty rare to happen on itself. I wish for some Arachne Killer, to make survivors feel fear, crippling sounds around you for her movements, you cannot hear where she actually is while the sounds get closer and closer. Starting to hear more clearly something cracking while she slowly come out from a window and jump into you making you run
---
Since you can't make a real horror experience like Outlast, at least something like that would make it more fun. The best games I had were when I actually had no idea where the killer was and started to be paranoid
---
Like for movies, even here that feeling is very rare to experience. I'm already totally immune to horror movies, at least get that feeling back on this game would feel so great
---
I was to late to do this I always said that “now all of China knows you’re here”
---
that's the situation where the key is actually useful.
---
When there is only 2 survivors and gens left the only chance for them to escape is to have a key. 
---
Saying that you should be entitled to a 3 or 4K 'cause you killed  the two other survivors is kind of bs.
---
If you know one of them has a key, then you know what to do and at what moment.
---
The hatch appears when x+1 gens have been repaired (x=survivors still alive). You have to slug before it happens.
---
No No Mither May.
---
What kind?
---
What was the player’s name from the killer? I literally played against a huntress and had a similar experience.
---
Of challenges?
---
i feel like roblox is a really underappreciated game, as in its a really great way for people that wanna make a game to express themselves.
---
I dont really like the game since im very picky on certain visuals, but i think the people who create shit in the game deserve a little bit more credit

---
Spirit was fine. She has counterplay. What needs nerfing is SWF. Spirit is the only killer that can beat red rank SWF.
---
Just give the man all his traps at the start of a match.
---
There was one for joining 5 survivors in the basement in a single trial, having all survivors step on bear trap at least once in a single trial, stuff like that
---
How do you opt in?
---
Prayer Beads*
---
… the point was to remove the hatch standoff
---
Given it takes 14 seconds to take down a totem, its certainly people spawning too close to a totem.
---
Current legion is not bad, you got the wrong idea. He is just dull, especially compared to what he really was. He feels too slow even while using frenzy and his power isn't threating. He is just an M1 killer who can land a free 1st hit. 
---
Old legion was extremely fast, the vaulting speed, the contrast between 4.4 speed and 5.2 and survivor speed vaulting was astonishing. All chases felt really fast, even though it took some time to down a survivor. Old Legion had issues, like moonwalk exploit or that he was impossible to juke. This could be balanced still, like giving survivors more chances to break chases and, like I said above, stopping deep wound timer while out of chase and running. 
---
I personally barely used an exploit and I miss old legion's stab stab gameplay.
---
Much harder than kicking a gen 2 times
---
Very well thought through, but not from an equal standpoint. The teachables alone are just hhh. No stun and deep wound? No... better to just leave it at deep wound, and up the timer by 1/2/3 seconds respectively
---
It happens but isn't really lag switch, just McDonald's wifi quality connection
---
I've been used as a weapon too some time ago. Was funny as hell

It is weak. I post it here because it makes breaking pallets faster, but is not worth a perk slot at all per se.

LOL I play on pc and xbox, recently I got into a match against a huntress and the game was glitching everywhere. I saw a dwight attached to the hubtress like yours.
---
I do believe they done did become your beaten sticks. Them last survivors best be getting up on out a here.
---
Honestly we need a pinned post for it at this point because people keep refusing to use the search function.
---
Literally anyone is aware of it by just opening the archives. You haven't managed to do anything. Devs managed to glitch it, not you
---
They’re repeats of previous challenges, but they’re a lot harder. One they reuse is for the trapper. As the trapper you have to trap 4 different survivors in the same trial. In another challenge you have to kill 3 people in the end game using NOED. All of the challenges in the last level have to be completed in a single game.
---
LMAO imagine snooping on somebodies profile because they beat you in an argument hahaha thats pathetic mate. I have negative comment karma because thick morons like you dont like to hear the truth so my shit gets downvoted. Its that simple. Move along with your sad life now.

You know I have to ask since I haven’t taped into the Japanese or Swedish horror market yet. What are your personal favorites?

I’m always down to watch more good horror and it seems you may know some good horror movie so have no idea about. I love gore, I like horror movies with good story and actual genuine scary shit is amazing. Which the more you talk about it is something I see lacking very much in American horror movies and maybe just most horror movies. 
---
I don’t care if it’s in another language as long as I can watch it with subtitles. Raw was a interesting movie I’m not sure if it classifies under horror or thriller. But it was a French movie I believe and I watched it with subtitles.
---
I won’t go out of my way to make sure others are having a good time. I just focus on my own gameplay and try to optimize it. I appreciate your effort to make the community better a lot. I remembered when I was patrolling my 3-gen and won based on that, and i was accused of camping the event generators. I try to explain my strategy and she told me it wasn’t a 3-gen, when I literally let go the other two gen to ensure the 3-gen are secure. I understand he/she probably had some tough games in a row, and could have met killers that purposely guard event gens, but anyway, after that I just wrote gg wp and leave the end game chat immediately every time.
---
lol. True. I thought i was losing my mind.
---
In a single trial? Who the hell do they think I am? Jesus? I probably cant make this miracle happen.

I've been finding the same old bullshit in chests during matches. Brown toolboxes, brown med kits, a yellow toolbox (which is nice but I want my spooky boys.) I've gotten 2 of the lunchbox med kits out of chests but yay for these rift challenges  and a mori every game so I never get to keep them.
---
There's 4 boxes base highlighted in a big white aura, you failed to search all of them. (unless Sketch/Plan Added boxes or Letter removed boxes)
---
the rapid beeping while near an exit gate should be enough to tell you leaving with an active RBT is a bad idea.
---
Not to mention the fact that your just asking to get flamed
---
Who asked? Anyway just message them it privatley or link them to the thousands of times this has already been posted
---
I'm a little stricter. If you wiggle while I make sure to pass hooks while looking for the hatch, you die. End of story.
---
are u blind? look in the left corner and you will see the Devil-may-care skin for JOE
---
I could care less if they want to flame me. I'm trying to be a challenge ;) I cant pull it off unless I deranked or something and let them power the gates then happen to catch them. It just seems like that particular challenge is going to create toxcitity.

---
&gt; But those are all if you were forced to play as a tunneller with Survivors being buffed per death, right?
---
No? If I'm not tunneling, this buff still apply. As I said - if there's no slowdown because of the first sacrifice, there's no reason for me to do this later in the game.
---
Just think of it: I play the Pig with no slowdown perks/add-ons. And I try to play in a way that doesn't feel "unfair" to survivors. So it's naturally to lose some/most gens early. All I'm hoping for is to get a natural slowdown after my first sacrifice, to get that snowballing effect. This change would ruin my playstyle... and to adapt to that (I'd still like to win some games, you know) I'd need to play in a much less fun way.
---
That's what Id call punishment get camped if u want to make bold plays like that. How else suppose to punish them spank them? lol You want to do that on first hook of the game then punishment is u get camped seeing how likely they are to do the exact same thing. Bro I had a billy today facecamp me first hook reving chainsaw I didnt tbag or flash light nothing I didn't cry like a bitch sending him a message I moved on

Of cause only licensed killers are requested, original killers are, well original and never seen before, so they can't be requested. Sure there are fan concepts, but the licensed ones are just better known.

Sadly it really depends on the atmosphere of the comments. If everyone is circle jerking about something and you actually have a different opinion it’s not usually going to go well. Even though logic would tell you that’s the perfect time to discuss differing opinions online because it’s important to make sure everyone knows that the “entire dbd community agrees with this” statement is actually wrong. The reason I don’t like toxic circle jerks is because when everyone is perceiving the subject at hand to be black and white, right or wrong they’re usually over correcting to the point of being wrong themselves. lol even on this post opinions are so far the other way not too many other people  dare to discuss why they disagree in fear of the downvotes. I like Reddit a lot for the realistic reviews and instructions of things but I don’t come here to listen to what needs to be nerfed or not. Far too many biased players to tackle to make it worth it. One day I said “I main Freddy and he seems pretty powerful with his rework” and I get a good amount of ball busting from people I’m fairly certain don’t even play as him because theyre focused on living out the meme. I guess it’s some sort of basic human instinct for affirmation but I see a lot of people on here throw out their brains or own opinions to trade it for the “since you disagreed at all you’re now the salty survivor meme and I’m the guy who called you out. Damn I’m fucking killing it on this internet thing” and I just can’t help but cringe. Sorry for the rant. Have a nice day
---
Yes you can
---
Honestly blood warden and remember me will have to be used like honestly. And rancor possibly
---
Unpopular opinion i prefer licensed characters to original characters.
---
This guy is right. The moment the killer does something toxic when its unsolicited you can do whatever your heart desires to them.
---
Yeah. If you can just get blood warden to activate then it could probably be done if you are lucky.
---
I don’t get where the ghostface hate comes from— I don’t find he over-performs at all
---
Well the point of the build was jump scares 🤷🏽‍♂️

Ugh... Markiplier?

Shouldn't have to call it. Pay attention to your screen.

And probably bunch of other stuff I missed. I’m really not sure why everyone complains about her.
---
i got called tunnelling trash by someone who kept trying to bodyblock me? i don't understand what goes through some peoples' heads
---
How do u punish someone who Tbags tunnel right? so bold unhooks clicking flash lights beginning of the game your punishment is get camped as they are likely to do it again seems pretty logical. Fact is don't be a prick then send a msg crying if u tbag n get tunneled don't send a message to the killer bitching either keep it moving or apologize.

Plus, you have to account for that fact that changing this would increase queue times. So it is working as should be atm.

The only people I ever report (and I doubt it does much) r people who dc as soon as they go down and deny me my stack of bbq 😂
---
It's not a blade, it's a shard of glass, and it'll most certainly annoy your unsafe-hook tunneling ass! LOL!
---
I personally want to get rid of moris, keys, insta heal (fixed), and no-ed.  Also spitit needs sonething changed about her, but idk what.
---
Broke: spitefully sandbagging the random then finding out they're actually rank 16+
---
Woke: giggling in the voice call as you beeline toward your rank 20 friend while you're being chased by a ghostface in stealth mode.
---
Wasn't tinkerer either, neither of them had perks to reduce their terror radius
---
If it works, why not?
---
Why is there a one clown limit? Lol
---
I was playing for hours grinding blood points and I’d have a dc almost every game, I didn’t even tunnel, camp, or anything. Sometimes survivors can get a little upset over losing a chase
---
Yea I have had similar issues with pc uploads
---
Yeah, which is why it would separate the idea of "sweating for a 4k" and just dicking around
---
At least make it no grunt in tier 3 ugh
---
Maybe change your build? Some low tier killers can do just fine without hex perks.
---
If you play killer and join a match you broke proper killer etiquette.
---
/s
---
The people that complain about Myers and Ghostface are the people who stare directly at the gen while repairing it instead of focusing on their surroundings for some reason
---
Even on Plague?
---
Since every killer plays with ruin the majority of the time, survivors have memorized almost all of the totem spawns. I know it's the first thing I'll do when I spawn. I'll totem hunt. Yes, some of the spawns are totally crap and need addressing, but even on the reworked Freddy map I've memorized nearly all the hiding spots. Same with Hawkins.
---
"I will be with you wherever you go, Russian. You shall NEVER BE RID OF ME!!!"

He probably hasnt played in a while so he went thru multiple resets. My guess
---
Homelander is too op!
---
Nicolas Cage Or Joaquin Phoenix
---
At least he's only bad at a game instead of you, who's bad at being a decent person. Interaction speed Wraith is not a serious build.
---
Cos some games the last gen pops as u down ur first survivor 😂
---
There's always the next game. Eventually you'll get it done. I don't think you need to "plan" for EGC sacrifice. Just play your normal game.
---
Some killer just want to watch the world burn
---
I just want the Babadook and the Miner from MBV.
---
It was actually a fix to this complaint they added a while back... which doesn't work because nobody looks at their hud, apparently.
---
If you lose to a camper at any level your group is just bad be them randoms or not even with ruin it's not hard to just get gens done in the 2 minutes you have before they die if you dont gen at least 4 done it's because the survivor get dumpstered off the bat and you are going to lose if you get altruistic anyway I have no hatred for killers who camp me and or my team even if I'm the first out it's a garbage tactic and it only works because survivors have 0 respect for killers. I have no pity for survivor teams who lose to camping
---
i see more trapper camper than bubba.
---
everytime i go against trapper. 50% chance he will camp.
---
encounter this thro out rank 16 to 8
---
wraith and even huntress also camp, the different is, the higher the rank, the smarter they camp (snipe) you.
---
Honestly, if he wanted to go with STBFL, PWYF, Pop, and Whispes. Hmm...
---
No no, that would be crazy...unless
---
Behaviour said they won't make a killer that can disguise as a surviver...sadly
---
It doesmt work well I assume. Everyone escapes and one person dies. I think when they realize they are going to lose they say screw it I'll atleast kill one guy.
---
She's the second best killer at worst because of spirit.
---
Please explain why do you think she mid tier

Many killers have a good chance to get 2-3 kills based on Ruin uptime and map RNG; key is barely a factor when it comes to anything except 1v1 EGC. If you don't get 2 kills before there's 1 gen left, a key is not what screwed you over that match.

I don't find it to be toxic.

Billy has surpased his limits

I mean it should be a throath grab I agree but is this worth mentioning at all?

Knowing your enemy won't let you to lose from oppents

Otz showed me the art of STBFL and Im forever grateful
---
Dang.
---
Yup even if I like a lot spiders haha
---
Well I don't know Sweden movies but the last Japanese one I've watched is sadako vs kayako. Yeah sounds bad for the "vs" but doesn't fall to the same category of classic "vs" American movies, like megapiranha vs giant octopus
---
Isn't bad, it's creepy but also have a lot of break times to catch a breath, also is a sequel of sadako serie (the ring). Ju On serie is fine I think, I enjoyed them but like sadako is more like a serie
---
If you're also interested in manga, junji hito works is fantastic too. Very carnal horror stories, just don't watch the tv series, and it can really shake you up.
---
Back to movies there is Climax, which is a nice horror movie I watched some time ago. The cabin in the woods is nice even if is more a parody of recent horror movies, mocking classic tropes. Eli is also a nice one!
---
I forgot many titles since I've watched them long ago and i have shit memory about names and movie titles haha sorry
---
There are many pearls and I suggest to check it out french movies and Japanese ones too, they are the best imo, only few American ones actually are good but in the other hand, American ones have the best action movies
---
Back to the game, yeah.. I'd like to see more killers linked to phobias, since there is demogorgon now, they can create semk-humanoid killers too, that can really creep you out
---
I think he ran up with driver in 5sec before  he gets his pants on
---
This meme format stopped being funny the first time it was posted here.
---
Wat did I just watch
---
Nah, not falling for the bait.
---
Because I know damn well that you’re aware that the spirit is unfun uninteractive and boring for the other side, while also having no counterplay, and takes 0 skill to learn. All you need are a pair of functioning ears.
---
You haven't beat anybody in an argument.. I was curious since you were so angry, spouting bs left and right
---
Your "truth" isn't the truth. It's just your opinion and entitlement, i explained why they are probably making these choices. You didn't like the answer so started insulting and saying you were right and they should do what you say..
---
That's sad.. probably the people you talked with before were right as well but you are too dense to understand when you're wrong or entitled for something. Just chill dude and think critically
---
You get reddit bronze for the effort.
---
Maybe he was relying on the killers hand book to protect him.
---
does the same thing for me
---
please stop, we dont need anymore posts talking about the challenges or showing what they are. we already know, and we know its hard.
---
His name is Evan
---
What dodo you mean
---
Yeah, I think that when they were writing Trapper’s backstory, they wrote in mines so that they could at least use a miner cosmetic if Harry Warden didn’t arrive later on.
---
I agree completely. Play how you want to play. I don't ecpe t anyone to change their mind for a stranger on the Internet so why listen to the messages? Do I find camping a hook fun? No. But like if I see you within 10 meters before the hook animation is even finished don't ecpe t me to ignore you
---
Sadly?
---
Keys and red mori are just pure bs
---
Well camping exists. Tunneling is something that I've never fully understood. Some people have different explanations and reasonings for it. Gen-rushing is just playing the objective.
---
Camping is most definitely a thing though. Sure, it's not against the rules and the killer can play however they want (as can a survivor).
---
Sadly, it's the only way of bringing the point across. We told dozens of people to use the search bar upon removing their repost and some of them still demanded a list of previous posts until they accepted the removal. :/
---
Well i would love to see it, but if the developers from BHVR said they are not planning to do it i find it sad.
---
The nurses ‚nerf‘ is barely noticeable like 95% of the time, her addons though were truly overpowered. The spirit hasn’t been touched but definitely does need to be changed, for the same reason old legion needed to be changed, lack of counterplay. It’s a multiplayer game, if the killer is just standing still, they shouldn’t be able to trick the survivor into moving away from a safe location. 
---
As a billy main, when and if they change him, I’ll accept it was for the best. Just because not every killer can get a confirmed 4K based on the individual killers skill (or by just having a decent pair of headphones as spirit) doesn’t mean they don’t want viable killers. Almost all killers are actually viable and able to play with a decent success rate
---
I know ash being a hero character he will have the plot armor and all that but they made Freddy almost NEVER use his power and it wasn't a case of “I am the best and no one can beat me, no matter what” that that the difference.
---
he use it on nurse on stream :))
---
I really wanted you to just put a portal on that dead David. Put an asshole on the asshole.
---
itd easier to get stacks, and after you get 7/8 you just chase normal and take everyone one by one
---
Well, it's not. Season 9 was great and so is S10 right now.
---
This is frigging excellent 👍😮
---
Cause he’s cute and funny
---
Literally has nothing to do with supporting otz bud. Just a rated comment on his video
---
Just another trash killer with no skill! Also the reason why I will never again be a rank 1 survivor, the higher you go the worst it’s gets with random survivors getting more brain dead the higher you go and same for killers... green ranks is where it’s at!
---
‘*They don’t make viable killers*’. We just gonna forget how they propelled Freddy from dogshit to almost god tier?
---
I'm very confused by this comment.
---
So we just have to get 1 survivor to constantly look towards him and he'll freeze xD
---
Very cool. Wish the game would lmk somehow. Only saw (lol) three stations this time AND the only other time I’ve played pig and both times nothing happened... Had literally no idea what to make of it.
---
It's pretty nice for getting a gauge on where the killer is and how much long you have to work generators.

Freddy is not god tier now though. High mid tier, a good place to be, but not SS tier
---
It's probably because not many people are playing on game pass. Everyone who has the game on PC is playing through Steam, which doesn't (yet) have crossplay. The Windows Store/Game Pass version is its own environment with its own playerbase. In an upcoming patch they plan to add crossplay between Windows Store and Steam, but for now the game's just kinda dead up there.

Sure, obviously, but skilled bushwomen are still a pain in the ass especially with Iron Will

FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS GODDAMN JUST GET OVER HERE DWIGHT
---
Mm mm. Mm mm
---
...how. Would he be like King Shark from suicide squad or just a regular shark
---
But he still needs to find the Obsession every time he wants to stack up again, and frankly, he's better off using a Windstorm add-on.
---
Wow, fuck. Is there any word on _when_ they plan to put that crossplay? For now, this really sucks and puts me off the game. But at least that makes sense in terms of "why."
---
Only if we can get the actors likeness and voice
---
Spirit is one of the best killers in the game but like the nurse she is not easy to learn. Plague becomes overpowered if people cleanse but high skill survivors will realise this and won't cleanse, leaving you to chase them as an m1 killer, just because a guys broken doesn't mean he can't loop you.
---
Overall, spirit will leave you with a far better result than plague if you put in the time to learn her power, I would recommend using stridor and predator with her for your first few games to help track survivors in phase walk
---
me too i stared at it for like 5 minutes racking my brain then finally gave up and checked the comments
---
Well something to keep in mind. The Devs have fixed (IMO) small game. So it doesn’t prox hooks, making that perk not only viable, but making totem hunting 10 times faster than before. Pay attention to after games to see if someone was running small game or if the totem spawn was shit.
---
What is the spirits reliable counterplay
---
Pepsiman!
---
I wish the mods would go thru here and actually do their jobs and pull these constant reposted memes down, I’ve literally seen the exact same memes get post over and over again by different people 2-4 times or more. Remember end game meme?? 
---
Also I’m really starting to dislike the constant post about a certain streamer filling up the hot section of this subreddit with its kiss ass fanboys and you have to scroll thru it all and most is all the same bs kiss ass fans glorifying one guy, when you don’t see anyone as a streamer get the same on this subreddit.
---
Yea but I highly doubt he will receive a quality of life change soon, BHVR always seems to not give a shit for trapper.
---
**I think it is**
---
Have you tried revealing Ghostface?
---
Fun concept. Balance isn't really there but there are some cool mechanics
---
I saw hexy play this it was fucking hilarious
---
Meanwhile an injured survivor can walk up into a trap, get out of it in 2 seconds and still get adrenaline on top of that Lmao
---
Made games on roblox from before, writing their scripts and creating models is actually a really difficult task. Now I know fuck all though
---
I just got the blight torso that I missed getting last year, so that and the ornate trapper mask with the bolo machete. When ornate was glitched out of the game I used Iron Chuckles and hollow flesh and iron torso. 
---
I just stick with the bolo machete since im not a fan of the horror trope metal stacked on top of metal weapons lol. What do you use?
---
why the fuck did you get downvoted for explaining what it is to someone who asked? this subreddit is toxic ffs
---
&gt; The thing is that it doesn't work
---
Do you really think they got to red/purple ranks playing some other way and then decided to start camping? That's naïve.
---
&gt; whoever used this strategy would be an asshole
---
That might be one of the reasons for them to play this way, actually
---
It’s called: adapt to new situations.  
---
Old nurse was S tier. A good nurse will always get a 4k if hatch rng isn’t against her. I don’t understand the complaints.
---
The saddest part is that all the toxic people, with basically no empathy, will most probably not even read this. That's how bad this community is. What I try to do is, I say gg in every single game no matter happens, even if I get facecamped or tbagged. Now as a survivor I would tell the Killer that he could have played a bit fair, and then say gg wp and leave. And as a killer i would tell the survivors to please not bm and then say gg wp. My idea is to make them feel bad, and then understand that there is a person behind the other character as well. IDK if it works or not, I can only hope.
---
One time I played a bad huntress, and I only got 2 hooks before all gens were done. now all 4 of them were tbagging hard at the exit gate. One made a mistake and somehow I downed him. I picked him up and they all left. Now I could have hooked him and then hit the hook like most Killers. But I decided not to. I gave the guy the hatch, Coz I understand that I didn't deserve the kill anyway. And you know what, the guy said thank you to me later. Maybe I made a bit of a difference
---
spirit probably could just do with a slower power regeneration.
---
Try it on Leatherface
---
Tea has been spilled sis
---
*looks over saw chapter*
---
Yeah...
---
Y’all would want rng gone until you realize it helps you get those kills. Rng is often worse for survivors over the killer
---
For the Hatch to spawn, All gens need to be done. 
---
If all survivors are able to group up at the hatch without you getting them I don't know the hatch is that much to blame for them escaping.
---
Trapper needs some love. I'm on team "should start with all traps then should have to go around and pick them up afterward" camp, though.
---
How most people play swf
---
ye i know.
---
you can only play if you do something besides actually playing. waiting times are at least 10mins. and those fckn dailies appear and the next seconds its a different one. yesterday i didnt even replaced it and it changed nontheless AND I couldnt change it. also i waited 15min for a killer game and once i had one the sound ingame died.
---
Despite him being their first.
---
Not to mention getting SWF groups where one asshole will follow you around just to spring your traps, or alert everyone to the trap locations.
---
Jeez just use mori
---
Hey from what I have seen on this subreddit only survivors can be toxic! Not killers! /s
---
Seriously though when they do play toxic they always have an excuse instead of admitting to being an asshat. "You flashlight saved someone!, you were looping me!, you had DS!" The list goes on.
---
Doesn't help that the devs have done so little to alleviate camping or tunneling coupled with the past year of nerfing survivors. Hope they can look into changing mori's and some killer add-ons someday.
---
The problem is that it's not even a discussion anymore, nor is it trolling your obviously to dumb to be trolling. It's the delusional sense of righteousness at this point that many people from generation Y have, you are so sure that you're right you don't even know when to stop when the other side is retreating...
---
I'm not angry why would I be angry at a guy probably halfway around the globe that could keel over and die tomorrow and I wouldn't even loose 1s of sleep about? I just feel pity for you that you still don't understand... and you probably never will... have fun with your entitlement problem good sir. Oh right, you weren't complaining for you, you where complaining for all the other people... right!
---
Try to google: "Profanity and Honesty" maybe then you'll understand although I sincerely doubt it...
---
Just stop
---
He can be, just understand that most of the time 2 or even 3 gens will get done while you’re setting up traps. 
---
You’re trading map pressure for zone control basically
---
OG&gt;Licensed.
---
It's very frustrating, especially cause they get a notification that the rescuer has it and most of the time, these people still run in panic while someone else is being chased lmao
---
man, check for similar things before posting. this has been posted every 5 minutes all day
---
Not even give you the exit? I know has the killer I’d down them for the points but let them crawl out.

\- Cypress Mori = no hook needed, gates powered or last survivor alive.

Who's downvoting all the comments on this post and why? There's people in here just saying that they want a nice community for the game they love who are getting downvoted, is someone really that dedicated to being a douche?
---
You'll be fine since you're technically only 25% done
---
I suck at survivor, can you give me the best build you can think of for a new player. I want some perks to work towards
---
Surely it's just bad game design if you make something work in a way that allows people to ruin it?
---
They are PS4 players , what do you expect
---
I never said you couldn't punish it. I just think it's funny that a killer facecamping first hook is somehow still the survs' faults. Y'all are severely twisting my words *and* the original post.
---
I'm gonna be honest, Bloody Coil could easily be base kit. For the amount of shit he has to go through for traps, the ease with which they're wrecked is ridiculous.
---
That and how having a nearby ally means a trap does basically nothing are the two biggest pains I have on him.
---
Most of us are rank 1, but rank doesn't hold TOO much weight. Someone can be rank 1 for the first time vs someone who's rank 1 with 5000 hours. The juggling survivor pressure only really applies when I'm playing a bad killer (legion for example) but there are times the milisecond you try to switch targets the rest know because they're on comms and already hiding. If you haven't encountered the super optimal bullshit good on ya.
---
Omg!!
---
That makes sense

It super nice to find the obsession first as Legion. Play iridescent pin and stolen sketch book. If you manage to find the obsession first and hit everyone else + hit the last person twice, that's already 4 tokens ( 5 when you down them ). Legion best killer to use this perk on. Even Pig and Demo profit of this perk so much.
---
To op : 10 minutes spent in a match give you 600 xp (600 is the cap)
---
Pretty much what i do if there are more than 2 dc's
---
Afterwards i tell whoever didn't dc to report those who dc.
---
We need more pure people like this guy in the DBD community
---
He also shouldn’t have to pick up a trap just to put it back down in the same damn spot. Why can’t he just rearm that trap there and then?
---
Yeah console matchmaking is dookie butter
---
A regular shark
---
Yeah 1.9.4 was the worst patch ever.
---
A hag trap in the middle of shack will catch anyone going to the stairs (with in reason)
---
I didn't reply becuase I didn't see the notification but that's probably what I'd have said
---
can i switch to cucumber?  so I can use sprint burst instead of DH?
---
Only one of those is a QOL change (Rng), the others are buffs. NEEDED buffs, but the two aren't interchangable
---
There's challenging, and there's frustrating. Spirit, as i saw a correct comment somewhere, reminds me of the old legion. He wasn't as much of a challenging as he was frustrating and unfun
---
Well you can just start walking away from the loop...? If she is phasing and you're not injured she will think that you're still at the pallet, overwise you got time to get to another loop, wasting the killer's time. It worked several times for me at least
---
Ok boomer.
---
Yeah I mean we'll make it heals you in a matter of seconds, even if the killer was coming back to the hook it would be better to get healed instead of running around being a one hit target that leaves blood on the floor and makes so much noise
---
I edited that in a few mins ago. However, a lot of Spirit builds don't use Stridor, so it isn't necessarily a shoe-in, which makes Iron Will still quite good in general.
---
No.
---
Do you want half the player base to kill them selves and move to Friday 13th instead?
---
i just like that theyre there whilst levelling a character.  
---
made my bloodwebs so cheap for levelling ghosty
---
Mine too. She said her “brother was bigger”. What ever the hell that means.
---
Legion should be faster while using his power without slowing his base movement speed and keeping his vaulting speeds low to make room for counterplay
---
Also his terror radius could be a bit lower
---
That would make him not Billy/spirit/nurse tier but on par with Freddy, huntress mayers 
---
Its not a competition who is fine and who is not, its about game balance in general, all killers should be around the same power level to mąkę room for variety
---
Yeah I know, crazy
---
Camping isn't toxic. Nodding and hitting survivor on hook is toxic. 
---
It's the same as calling palletlooping or flashlight blinding toxic. It's a part of the game that cannot be called toxic.
---
Why the hell are you guys down voting him? He's not wrong, finding less than 150 to 140 ping killers is rare for me too on PS4
---
Yes lol
---
Please I just want to have this game fixed:(
---
Noed is fine, moris are fine.
---
Because unlike other streamers, hes funny, he's original, doesn't complain too much about everything and loves the game the way it is.
---
Challenges: *are challenging*
---
Reddit: “despicable.”
---
Those things exist. All do. And just because its a strategy doesnt mean its a viable strategy. Tunneling wastes time depending on the survivor, camping only confirma a kill, you dont gain rank from it and you usually derank cause genrush is a thing. Just because its a strategy doesnt mean its a good one. Also letting someone tell you whats right and whats wrong based on your opinions is good, but dont force your views down their throath. Cause camping is bad in my opinion and I do tell that you dont gain anything from it, but no1 is stopping you. My point being, if you camp, dont fully follow this advice: 
---
&gt;Play your own game and don't let anyone else tell you what way is "right" or "wrong".
---
Listen to peoples critisms towards you and make your own understanding of right and wrong, cause at the end of the day, you arent the only one who bought the game.
---
I've encountered a Myers in Tier 3 wit the same strategy, I was the first one, he did it to everyone, and at the end being a rasist in chat.
---
I agree, trapper should be buffed, but still, he's a pretty good killer. I run it with hex ruin, whispers, blood warden and noed.
---
I start trapping the totem hex to gain time, and I trap every pallet. They usually take a lot of time to destroy the totem, while I build up many hooks. They can't disarm every trap and chasing are really fun. Plus, if they get to open the doors, noed and blood warden are freakily hilarious.
---
its sound like a pain in the ass to complete
---
credit to [u/The_Wheat](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Wheat) for the clip
---
I wish the devs would buff weak killers I’m so tired of going against the same 2 killers all the time :(
---
Let's be honest, you kinda deserved that one
---
Hatch spawns when there's last gen remaining with 5 survivors, so if the killer doesn't kbow about the key he will patrol the gens and suddenly everyone is gone while two people were dead on hook
---
PaIn oF bEiNG A KIlLeR maiN.
---
I expected to be able to play a full game with, at least, a single DC before someone's third hook. Not a full 4-man DC the moment I outplayed a Dwight who failed a loop, got hit, then got outplayed at killer shack, and his friend failed a flashlight save. Am I not allowed to play the killer I want to play, just like how survivors are allowed to bring in 4-man SWF in comms with full meta perks that make *my* life impossible?
---
Values would more likely scale 30/40/50% to keep in line with the status quo
---
I think the best Idea of an og killer is the slender and for a survivor the girl that he brings to the forest.
---
Dude, staring directly into someone's face while they are on the hook is toxic. You can try to justify it all you want but all it does is make you look like a noob who can only get one kill per game.
---
Just a story I’d like to share. One of the first times I played as Huntress (for a daily), I was harassed by a SWF, one person in particular. I’ve played countless games with them as survivor before this experience but now, every time I see them show up in a game, I remember how toxic they were and want to quit immediately. One toxic experience can ruin countless games and it’s nice to see someone standing against that sort of behaviour.
---
&gt; So we're going to nerf keys like we nerfed insta heals now are we?
---
Yes. Why are you implying that the insta heal nerfs were unnecessary while complaining about moris? The insta heal nerfs were *very* much necessary and a step in the right direction. The community is not confused on what they want like you're saying, it's just that your beliefs don't 100% align with the reddit hivemind this time, not to mention that different people want different things and most of them have absolutely no idea what game balance is. Oh and btw, you don't get to complain about NOED when adrenaline exists, I'm guessing you very conveniently forgot to mention it?
---
Absolutely, let myself get cocky because it was a easy game haha
---
I would definitely not say it is a better Ruin, it has pros and cons. The RNG on Corrupt can suck big time, leaving you with a really terrible stack of gens far away from each other at the end of the game that you cannot defend properly. And depending on the survivor spawn they can just ignore the locked gens and do one of the open ones because sometimes it spawns quite close to them.
---
Yes they do, survivors have to use 3 addons instead of 2 which is 50% more expensive. Whenever someone says "some group of things is stronger than some other group of things" it means that he's talking about the averages of the 2 groups. U cant just take the strongest addon for survivors and compare it to one of the weakest of the killers. What about comparing styptic agent vs prayer beads?

There was literally a guy I played against a lot who's name was facecamp killer. He streamed it all too. And he would spend hours hundreds of hours getting one kill and facecamping and only attacking people trying to save them or after the person died. Thing was he was decent in chase so you would get caught every now and again once and the game was over. Especially when he played bubba.
---
no, I'm not selfish trash. it is just funny to me to say stuff like this for a game.
---
You should meet my SWF team, then. Nobody goes for the rescue, because everyone waits for someone else to do it. Then the one person who decided to go when I'm on 60% health runs onto the killer, the other one leaves gen too late, and the last one self-cares even though the killer isn't near me - and by the time they finish, the killer already returned, so I end up dying on my first hook.
---
Unless I pick up a quest for unhooking survivors. In that case, everyone saves everyone ASAP, to the point where you have 3 people running into the hook.
---
Well yes but no. I have killers coming for freshly popped gens literally all the time, even on high ranks.
---
"You are one ugly mother fucker"
---
Ah yes, enslaved urban invasion
---
I agree but tbf dinner cat is a good meme
---
Use Blood Warden, it helps. Also play someone like the Hillbilly or Leather Face. The chainsaws really help getting around the map and catching up with survivors.
---
Why else bring bond?
---
Its a totem you have to break in order to do gens first. Plus, it gives everyone a 10 percent speed burst.
---
Console players are Bad
---
Game is designed to be toxic-inducing.
---
Theres a study that shows that angry people spend more time playing the game to get a sense of retribution.
---
&gt;it doesn’t work if you use it to avoid getting hit
---
Imagine using the perk that’s supposed to give you invulnerability to take a hit ...
---
How else do we farm salt for my salt shaker
---
Chucky just wouldn’t work. You either have him be doll sized which makes him impossible to see or make him normal size... and what’s the point in having Chucky if he isn’t a doll
---
Pennywise I dunno I just don’t see him fitting the DBD theme
---
Xenomorph / alien I really dont think BHVR will do, they said a while ago they don’t want aliens or monsters, they want to focus on humanoid killers. Granted they did make demogorgon, but I believe he’s the exception, no way could BHVR pass up on a deal with Netflix and stranger things.
---
Honestly I really want more original killers, BHVR has an amazing design team that creates some very unique a characters and I love seeing what they create
---
But what does Pot of Greed do?
---
Welcome to the DbD community. Try playing with random people on the Discord.
---
Can't fix what has never worked.
---
~~I love this game but it's so broken for many reasons~~
---
Mad because bad, that's literally all I here. People like you are why everyone hates survivor mains. You make us look bad.
---
EXTRA THICCCCC
---
DoWnvOte beCausE iM a ShIT suRviVoR mAiN
---
Hi my comment isn't related to this post but I wanted to ask a question how come when you unhook someone the killer hunts down that person specifically but doesn't hit anybody else in their path?
---
I fucking hate it when people use self care against sloppy butcher. I can literally repair an entire gen while your dumbass is sitting in the corner of the map, touching yourself for about five minutes
---
Compare him to any killer released these days. If you want to remove infection you give Plague a massive power spike. If you want to take off Ghostface's shroud you need to get right up close and reveal yourself to him with instincts. If you want to stop Demo's portals you have to make yourself vulnerable to detection and unaware, and even then he gets a chance to use them first.
---
Trapper has more setup time and way less payoff than any of them considering his traps are essentially worthless if he isn't within 10-15 meters of them. He has to collect his power which is a downside harsher than any other trapping killer, and survivors can literally destroy his power for the whole match. A snap across the map is nothing as a consequence, it would be perfectly fine if the trade off for removing a trap was needing to heal afterwards.
---
I wish that was the case. I'm new to the game as a killer main, and at rank 16 I'm going against full 6-10s SWF groups. I'm sitting here running the worst rank 1 and 2 perks and being told "GG" after they have people camp my traps over and over. It isn't fun. =/
---
Honestly I hope they add Jack Torrance. It might not make sense but I bet they could make sense of it.
---
Ultra rare means nothing, I get more Ebonys on my killer bloodwebs than Ivorys
---
They could even license it and Evyns could get paid for it.
---
Sell Charms for killers that when equipped change the killers chase music.  Easy money for Behaviour.
---
Who would win?
---
A perfect 3 gen start or 3 survivors who plundered a piece of metal from a chest?
---
Ahhh "it's a friend! Oh shit it's legion!" Classic
---
Hard no
---
If you wanna proper thank them, go leave a nice comment on their steam! It will be a nice addiction, between all the “noob killer” and “ez jukes” comments.
---
Went from 20 to 1 as Pig only. If you're good enough you can win with every killer at every rank.
---
Now that’s a real killer
---
Trapper is probably the only killer I don't play just because he feels like he has way too much prep for a *CHANCE* at decent payoff. I'd welcome these changes any day
---
So I’ll be the nice one and tell you that we have seen this before! Many people have posted this before but once you complete the first one it shows the rest
---
it is
---
I mean there’s no real reason every game has toxic people just gotta ignore it
---
“The ongoing lawsuit between original Friday the 13th scribe Victor and director Sean Cunningham, however, could keep Mrs. Voorhees baby boy buried indefinitely.
---
Miller won a lawsuit last October that granted him the rights to Friday the 13th, but Cunningham and Horror Inc. (the company that owns Jason Voorhees) filed an appeal. Late last week, word came down that Cunningham’s appeal has been approved, meaning any immediate plans Miller had for a reboot will have to be put on ice.”
---
“Cunningham has withdrawn his appeal. This could pave the way for new Friday the 13th films, as potential investors would be weary of a property that carried potential baggage.
---
It turns out that Cunningham’s appeal was only withdrawn for technical reasons, meaning Jason’s current master has a choice to make: Spend another half decade in court pursuing a case he might lose (again), or come to a fair settlement with Miller (I think most fans are hopping for the latter).”
---
Tl;dr : The screenwriter for Friday the 13th, Victor Miller won the rights to the franchise but Horror inc and Sean Cunningham are still opposed to it, making any future production difficult until it’s all ironed out. Everything F13th and Jason related is on complete freeze until further notice
---
the hate comes from the reveal mechanic being finicky at best and non-existent at worst and not allowing you to get a fair chase before being exposed and then, with no terror radius or red stain to attempt to mind game at non-see-through pallet loops, go down. 
---
it makes any pallets that aren't completely see-through basically into a "where's the ghostface" guessing game where if you guess right, congrats you did it and you feel no satisfaction because you only guessed and got lucky and if you guess wrong, you lose and you feel cheated.
---
it forces survivors to camp pallets as thats the only counter to a killer who you can't see is coming at all until the very last second. and camping pallets is boring, not interactive and wastes resources on maps where pallets might be sparse. (its especially bad on Lery's) 
---
its basically the same reason people dont like spirit although nowhere near the same extent since there's actually some semblance of counterplay, despite the counterplay being a bit boring.
---
Its cause most people who play want to be like the big youtubers like Noob3 who are slightly toxic. Thats because Noob3 plays against killers who are new and or low rank like 20 or 19.
---
I dont think people should be treated in that way. I always pay respect to killers if they are nice back. However youll always have one toxic guy.
---
Lmao ,no they aren't, keys are straight up bullshit too, it's automatic loss for teritorial killers, not to mention that they guarantee escape in the end game. Id gladly take a rework for mori's, if keys do as well.
---
It’s a multiplayer game which means you should expect every personality around and the one that bleeds the most in life is the ugly.
---
The other day I got blinded, and didn't drop the survivor. Felt bad, so I turned and looked directly at the Feng giving her another chance. She blinded me AGAIN, and I STILL didn't drop the survivor.
---
Worked the third time though, but it was fuckin weird.
---
It feels like Second Wind. Either I jump three hoops for this thing to work and I just survive anyway without ever using it or I “activate” the perk after it’s become useless to me.
---
Why not run sloppy and save the best for last and stop relying on a crutch like noed?
---
How man survivors (and killers) dc make sure to include ranks (bonus if you can include who they were playing as)
---
Entity always gets bitches
---
Done
---
A zombie would be fucking awesome tho. Infecting survivors when theh die they could help you. No collision with those zombie survivors. If the survivors dont wanna help fine they can leave or come back. Killer power also does something that helps throughout the game...
---
Very nice thank you
---
90% of the time. I stopped using it.
---
Small game because every killer ruins ruin at hitting great at 3am
---
Empathy = knowing where is killer, who is chasing and where are those stupids selfcaring in the corner
---
And one exhaustion perk to run the killer
---
I made [this suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b1fu3u/memento_moris_are_op_plez_nerf_clickbait/) a while ago. Nobody liked it too
---
Okay, what's the counter to a Spirit who happens to be running Stridor, then?
---
I mean, entertainment as a metric of success is valid, it is a “game”. You can “win” by running meta addons, meta killers, mories, camping hooks, tunneling survivors, there are countless ways to lock the gamestate and secure a 4k. But it’s a game, and nobody’s having fun.
---
It seems silly that a 4k can result in an ent. displeased, but in the context of the objective of “fun” it makes more sense. In getting a 4k so early, you have to be hard slugging and pressuring survivors into not saving each other, an arguably un-fun or anti-fun way to play the game.
---
She is broken by her base power actually as she doesn't give any information which you can use to counter her in some way. You can predict Nurses blinks for example by checking where she looks at but when a Spirit phases near you you don't hear anything so you can never be sure if she is phasing or not.
---
but I have resilience tho (I usually let people heal me tho lol)
---
Oh... well, we found the red spy
---
Trapper is low tier/ignored, wraith is low tier/ignored, pig is low tier,  bubba is relatively low tier/ignored.... these are facts
---
Legion isn't GOOD but far from being a Bing Bong Boi killer
---
and comparing nurse to even the same tier as freddy even, is complete nonsense
---
Ghostface and Freddy are actually pretty solid killers. On console, potentially the 2nd and 3rd best killers in the game behind spirit. Pig is OK too. Michael mid tier but always fun. Leatherface yeah sucks. Demogorgons I didn't even bought him. So boring and doesn't seem effective.
---
Unlicensed don't forget Legion, wraith, trapper, clown. Some of them might be fun but you're probably not going to win so much with them.
---
Thats very sad dude! But wow you seem to be very good in this game when you get those ranks so quickly with no meta perks (i guess).
---
The main problem is not only that 4 people are insulting you when you play killer but also that survivor if they die they had no "good game", because everyone feels like he deserve to survive/win. Usualy when I steamroll 4 people I give one of them the hatch and in about 10%-20% of times other survivors (who died) are insulting me that I killed them and spared the other guy. 
---
But sometimes people are also nice: 3 days ago I 4k with Spirit for the Tome mission and people in the chat said very nice stuff like: "very good spirit, very difficult to loop" and so on! I have to admit its the first time I read THAT positivity! Most of the time I am the one who tells people that they did very well so it was very suprising and heartwarming to hear something like that. What I am trying to say: Dont give up this community because of those toxic people! There are many great people who just dont talk and a few great people who even talk and brighten your day!
---
What I recognized myself is that streamer-games dont show the true toxicity of the game! Most people are very kind to streams especially to such sweatheart as Otzdarva. So it might surprise people afterwards (like in your case).
---
Also sorry for my english, not my first or second language!
---
Every time I see "baby killer" I just picture a super toxic P3 Claudette
---
Sounds like a game I had against Myers.

The issue with that is it makes him even MORE SWF counter focused.   As a single person can't just snap his traps alone unless they have someone else with them to heal them, or have selfcare (as snapping his traps will eat through a medkit like that).
---
And it's a far higher price to pay at that time.  You can pop GF's shroud from safety potentially, and can punish plague for going for an infected pool by making sure that infected pool is in a far off corner of the map where going there will cost her a very significant amount of pressure.
---
Bloody Coil is far too strong an effect to give to him innately (It's an ultra-rare for a reason), but Trapper's bag just lets Trapper be more flexible in his trap holding, and pick up steam a bit quicker.
---
Imagine being so bad at a game that you have to post about it

Yeah, I'm aware. My point still stands. I didn't say survivors should be nerfed, I said that Spirit shouldn't be. Fact is that even red rank solo players are often competent enough to best subpar killers on most maps. As long as people do gens and don't go down immediately, most killers don't have sufficient map or chase pressure to win. 
---
I'm not saying that you should 4k all the time. But I view the argument that "all killers are viable at all ranks just git gud" to he highly disingenuous, because it disregards fundamental game mechanics of DBD. 
---
Also also, don't most people play survivor anyway? More people are already playing surv by design, and if there are super negative balance changes for killers, it will impact the game far more negatively than a small survivor nerf, which, by the way, I have not advocated for.
---
Lmao someone was salty at me because I was using Oblivious with trapper lol
---
Slippery would be nuts especially paired with triple jump. Imagine how many times you have just barely got hit at a pallet or window.
---
The other survivor who was with me was my friend and he said on his screen I never moved from the entrance and the killer walked straight up to me and downed me haha, I’m guessing some sort of connection problem
---
&gt;All the killers in dbd have something mystical about them, and cannot be explained rationnaly.
---
What? The only ones like this are Nurse, Spirit, Hag, and Wraith, somewhat. The rest are really easily explained.
---
I wanna draw a smiley face on him
---
hillbilly is literally walmart leatherface and they still added bubba, this is the dumbest argument against pennywise
---
Thanks, I did not understand how she could have hit you from that distance ! :)
---
Ever thought about ignoring people who do this? Or just replying with GG?
---
Yes it would be.  If you know how to loop you'll just be beating up on babykillers who don't know how to counterplay it yet.  Also as others have pointed out your teamates will be worse anyways and they run ruin throughout most ranks since it works at tier 1.  You'd be facing NOED almost every game up there as well.
---
Or, you can snap Trappers traps while injured and do a bunch of them, and risk him coming after you. You don't have to heal after every trap.
---
Any killer can counter to SWF if you're able to snowball. It's just easy to snowball with Spirit because you can woosh on top of survivors heads and smack them. But if you know what you're doing and have some decent setup you're gonna be fine unless survivors team is godlike and you aren't. But that's PVP for you, skillgap matters.
---
P.S.: Oh well, maybe not any killer, Legion is in a really bad state.
---
Survs spawning near an open gen still is good for you, you only have 4 gens to patrol. If they spawn next to your ruin there isnt anything you can do.
---
If 4 people are able to escape with a key the killer most defiantly isn't playing well.
---
I always thought a Xenomorph killer would be a tracking killer. I would say every 30-60 seconds he can send out a pulse across the whole map and a survivor will be impregnated with a baby xenomorph. After that they would send a pulse about every 5 seconds that the Xenomorph could see. The survivors could get another survivor to take out the tracker, or they would have to find a medical bench, which would spawn around 4 to 5 times across the map, to take it out. He could also crawl and reduce his terror radius either to 0 or 8 meters. Also, the map would be the space center and I have some ideas about that as well. Firstly there would be vents, but any time a gen is powers parts of the vent is cut off and other parts open up. This would cause a lot of chaos on both sides, and would also make the chases feel like a real horror movie chase scene.

2 traps? Yeah, definetly. Downing injured survivors? Not so much.
---
Because it flat out is extremely powerful.  You'd need to make tokens decay fairly fast on it to be balanced (Token decaying every 15 seconds or so).  A lot of window loops are designed so that the killer just makes some distance each loop, but not much.  This would completely bypass this distance the killer gains by that third loop.

Ok, when your playing Hag, and your on Coldwin Farm, or Yamaoka Estate and they are in Wheat/Tall Grass and you can't see over it cause your shorter than a 5th grader, I can understand not seeing people.

Before, did you play via Xbox game pass (PC) or on console (Xbox One or PS4)?  
---
Because I am playing on PC via Xbox game pass and queue times are 15+ minutes for both survivor and killer. :(
---
Dude don't fall for her shes a Ho.
---
Got her titty out'n'shit.
---
Shoulda kept you’re head on a swivel ya goof!
---
Trapper is addon and perk dependant.  You need to have at least 2 traps, and Ruin / Corrupt Purge to have a bit of time to set up. Otherwise the trial will go too fast, and you'll rely mostly on luck to have someone step in a trap  and turn the game in your favor.
---
But when you have that, well, he's really strong. Probably the best for 3 gens strat. How many times I've seen 4 gens get repaired in a blink of a eye, but the last one being hell for survivors, and you can push that to the exit gate.  
---
Trapper is the king of late game. 
---
One thing that isn't discussed often though, still the same over the years, is that he's the most vulnerable against SWF with audio who can warn their friend about trap placement. He should get buffed against this, so that solo survivors don't get f\*\*\*\*d. But it's the overall problem with DbD that the devs fail to understand.
---
The devs have done a lot of updates and changes to killers recently, being a bit more bold in their changes. Hopefully they will give some touch up to some killers who need it quite desperately.
---
no key is not strong.
---
For its the other around. I used to get survivor lobbies instantly. Yes. Literally instantly. Killer lobbies on the other hand took around 20-30 minutes during the day or 10 minutes during midnight. Since they introduced dedicated servers  my survivor lobbies take 5 minutes on average and killer also 5 minutes. Because I am a survivor main the additional 5 minutes kinda suck but keeping in mind that killer games are now possible for me without waiting forever its a trade off I like!

There is ranked, therefore its a competitive game mode.

Please leave my ghostface v-v he's my last un-nerfed killer.
---
Dude calm down
---
First of all i didnt say that other killers didnt need help, it was a comment about legion so i said my thoughts about legion specificaly
---
Second of all i said legion with my changes wont be nurse/spirit/Billy tier (a tier) but maybe will be Freddy/huntress/hag/ mayers tier (b)
---
I do realise other killers need help but this wasnt a comment about them - i Play all the killers respectively and know about their current state
---
I want a locust with a head stomp  mori. I'd pay 30 dollars for that if the head actually popped.
---
Im fed up with all of it :/
---
I dont know, people treat walking like the ultimate counter to spirit mindgames but tbh she can find you either way, you move grass when you walk over it so you'd have to avoid it and if you're injured you're dead.
---
Survivors also make noise even when they're not injured, the breathing they make can be picked up by any killer but specially spirit since she kinda relies on sounds to get the counterplay thingy out of her power, and its worse since now they're begginning to use stridor so that is pointless aswell
---
I dont really mind if the killer is based around guessing (though to me it seems like a super uninteractive mechanic) but when the killer can take the guessing and mindgame out of her power by using headphones then we have got a problem since her power becomes: "Press m2 to get a guaranteed hit".
---
I totally agree that the community is toxic, it’s so rare to find a good killer, whilst also playing with good survivors who don’t just gen rush etc as well as finding a killer who doesn’t tunnel. I guess I always appreciate a sound killer more as it’s so rare. Especially if they show mercy etc
---
*BRUTAL KILLER*
---
if you have 4 survivor get out by key. you play very bad. hatch does not open until 1 survivor dead + 4 gen done. if 4 survivor is up, thats mean 5 gen done.
---
I'm not talking about it's impact in the game, im talking about the fact that the ms boost is not big enough for creating new infinites, 7% extra for survs is basically a extra meter every 4seconds which is definitly not enough. That being said 2% is basically nothing in chases which means that it probs wouldn't even be used for its downside
---
i've never even thought of the xenomorph as a killer but now i want him dammit!
---
I played the shit out of the bloodhint during Red ranks and I don't know whether I was just lucky or not but I've seen a healthy mix between Billy, Nurse, Myers, Spirit and Freddy. Yes. Fucking Freddy. And I'm not talking about Fake Pallet Freddy. Yes, I had them too but most Freddie just had the normal Dream Snares.
---
Like I said I don't know if I was just lucky with my killers but red rank isn't a pain in the ass as people say. Or maybe I'm just overly good. I don't know.
---
They could have made it cancel the pickup animation ... instead it played the hole thing then stun survivor drop.
---
The single biggest part of playing killer is applying map pressure. People go on about game slowdown all the time and how it’s so important and why hex: ruin is so good, well the single best way to slow the game down is to apply map pressure, make sure none of the survivors are on gens, always get right back into a chase after a hook, go after the gens with multiple people on it to stop multiple people from doing gens with your time, be efficient with your chases, keep the downs rolling, slug if you need to, etc. learning how to apply map pressure will take time but certain killers like Hillbilly will teach you to do it more so than others.
---
Second most important thing is learning how to chase, because faster chases means faster downs which means less people on gens, that’s map pressure, feeds into the first point. Ohtofu and Fungoose are both informational YouTube channel that have a lot of guides for playing specific structures and in general you can absorb some of the concepts they teach for specific structures and apply it to all chases. Stuff such as moonwalking, playing pallets, when to double back, when to commit, these are all things that will come with time but if you keep them in the back of your head you will be a better killer.
---
His terror radius skills are pretty powerful. It's practically a walking insidious.
---
I run deliverance to counter camping. If I’m being facecamped a random will trade with me and the cycle continues. So I run deliverance instead so nobody has to die trying to save me. And if he picks me up again I have ds. If he slugs I got unbreakable.
---
Hes not op or impossible to counter in the slightest. He has really strong mind game potential. The only thing thats a bit busted is his revel mechanic
---
It's not a legitimate strategy. Lol Strategies take time to think up and involve a plan. Camping is not that. Camping is waiting for the survivor to kill themselves so you can get an easy win. If anything it's a pussy tactic.
---
Same. Just like when I do survivor with the others they all just fucken T bag at the gate! It annoys me to no end. It's so rude.
---
Big no. Legion played well is a terrifyingly good killer.
---
Some people just like to blame everything around them when they lose in a video game, they just feel like the killer isn't allowed to win and they literally should get a jail free card each game rather than getting sacraficed for making mistakes. Ignore such people, I usually write gg and move to my next game, since argueing with them is literally a loss of braincells while trying to explain them that they're at fault for losing.
---
Aren't they little cuties?
---
Its an okay idea. But i feel like they should add it as default. Not as "pay to use said track"
---
Shouldn't have clicked that.
---
I think a better implication for this would be have all actions move slightly faster if a killer is staying on a hooker survivor for to long. Just like survivors are punished for hiding while their team does everything.

My problem is no terror radius + insta-down ability. Yes, I do pay attention to my surroundings, but I don't always spot GF. And it's not just him. I find the proliferation of no terror radius + insta-down options to be problematic in general. Hopefully they won't keep adding killers that have that option. If it's limited to just a few, we can probably live (or die) with it.
---
tru3 was best and have fair gameplay on bothside. in survivor, he never use flashlight, very rarely use instant heal. he very rarely slugging, almost never camping ( except exit gate open ), but never facecamping. isnt like other streamer that try hard to win ( otz with slug , puppy with facecamp, etc ).
---
I play overwatch. I've heard terrible shit. But something can still be toxic and not break the fucken game play for you. I do find it toxic because it's just rude. It's like rubbing it in peoples faces that you've won. It isn't good sportsmanship. Doesn't hurt my feelings but I don't find enjoyment in making other people feel like shit because you find it funny.

· Iron Will: That is actually countered by stridor, and it seems like spirits are beggining to take it so I dont know about that one
---
· Fixated: Walking faster is useful but the problem is not that you're not quick enough, is the fact that even though you are doing something that is supposed to make you sneakier and harder to find she can just look at the ground for blood trails, or grass moving, or just bumping into you, or just hearing your character make sounds.
---
· Standing Still: Again, unless you're standing on grass or something like that if you're injured you're dead since you'll leave blood pools, and you'll make sounds, and she can bump into you
---
· Crouching: The same thing as walking
---
· Using your ears: You can only hear her phase either if you're super close and you can pick up the sound that she makes when she starts shaking and going into her power or if you're far away and you can hear the whooshing sound, either way the problem is not that you dont know when shes phasing, is that you cant really do much about it
---
· Map knowledge:  ?  I guess that means knowing the places in which you can stand in the middle of a pallet or just quietly vault a window, either way its a 50/50 and its not very interactive in my opinion.
---
Either way, I like her design but when you give a killer the ability to get a guaranteed hit (phasing next to you) you obviously need to give that power a downside, the "downside" was that she didnt have a lot of information on your position and you didnt have a lot of information on hers, so it was based around who could make better reads and try to outsmart the opponent.
---
But when you give her a million tools to track you down then these "mindgames" lose all value, right now if spirit has her headphones plugged in and her eyes open you're getting hit, and thats kinda lame
---

Cause hiding and doing 2 gens just applies more pressure on your team mates cause you dont take a chase ever
---
I must admit that I play more survivor nowadays, but mainly because playing killer can get very disheartening. I always try to play far without BM, unless my oponent takes it upon themselves to BM me. In that case I always adopt the "talk the talk, walk the walk" playstyle. 
---
You teabag at every pallet drop? You better be very good. (Will never camp the hook or tunnel though, but I will make sure you won't make it to the end of the match) You proxy camp me on the hook and hit me every time you pass by me? You better make sure I don't escape when I get saved. 
---
I try not to let past toxicity get to me in next matches. But if you are going to be toxic with me in the current match, you bet I'll try and make your match miserable.
---
I mean i personally prefer their original killers.  I tend to find the licensed killers pretty boring compared to them with a few exceptions (pig &amp; myers)
---
I actually disagree with rancor, while I don't think it really needs a change since it's not popular it sucks to do well but get morid cus you are the obsession and nothing more. I love using DH cus when I mori people it feels like I have earned it
---
I, so to say, git gutted and can get flashlight save 80% of time when killer messes up/allows (doesn't looking at a wall) me to do it.
---
I believe a win is a good game with some cooperation on both sides eg. a killer hooking twice before mori or last survivors not wiggling and hoping for mercy. In my opinion these are the best moments in the game it’s like I could but I’ll get to you later. Same to you have a nice day.

You didn't say survivors should be nerfed, but you did say the following.
---
&gt; Also, wow, 2 killers out of 17 MAYBE can counter SWF. Don't you see a problem with the majority of killers not being viable at high ranks? 
---
Which those 2 killers are I'd assume Spirit and Nurse and considering you're commenting on there being a problem that 2 of the killers are viable while the rest aren't means there is clearly some sort of balancing issue. Are we looking in the direction of buffing every killer to at least be on par with Spirit/Nurse meaning 15 killers getting varying levels of insane buffs to keep up, or are we looking in the direction of getting those 2 problematic clearly above the rest killers in line with the rest, alongside looking to balance out the also clearly above the rest survivors?
---
I'll just quote your chunks of text and break it down one at a time for simplicity sake as to why I'm referring to.
---
&gt;Yeah, I'm aware. My point still stands. I didn't say survivors should be nerfed, I said that Spirit shouldn't be. Fact is that even red rank solo players are often competent enough to best subpar killers on most maps. As long as people do gens and don't go down immediately, most killers don't have sufficient map or chase pressure to win.
---
You never said survivors should be nerfed and you were arguing Spirit shouldn't be nerfed, that's true. However  if we're looking at competent red rank players, we should be looking at the competent red rank killers as well. You can tell by playing survivor when a killer is bad and when a killer is good. I've played against many pigs who do NOTHING to try and shorten a chase. They'll hold forward and bloodlust an entire chase and just the other day I had one who literally tried to mind game me on the killer shack pallet from the other side of the shack, I had like 5 seconds to react to her. By at the same time, I've played against many pigs who were authentically good and using their stealth and lunge effectively to 50/50, to get close and get quick hits. Same people are the ones who will actually double back on shack window and such and yet the pig is supposed to be one of the weakest killers right now. Those lower tier killers are just less consistent and more victim to good survivors then the higher tiers, that's it. But then it all loops back to if you want to compare low tier killers to optimal survivors, then you should be comparing it to optimal killers who would be playing the higher tier killers.
---
&gt;I'm not saying that you should 4k all the time. But I view the argument that "all killers are viable at all ranks just git gud" to he highly disingenuous, because it disregards fundamental game mechanics of DBD.
---
Unfortunately as I did just explain the, "all killers are viable at all ranks get good" argument is true. Some are simply stronger and as a result more consistent, but none of them are so weak as to be completely unviable. Personally I don't find killer very fun to play because I don't like needing to level each one up for perks, but I've gotten to I believe it was rank 6 I believe 2 months back almost exclusively playing Doctor with my main goal being just to simply give the survivors as fair and fun a match as I can give. I would rarely ever return to a hook when a save happened, I would only hook the same person I last unhooked if I happened to run into them two different times, I would even try to avoid camping hooks after the gates were opened. I still got a 4k most matches, double pipped I don't even know how many times without trying and most of these matches were done within the first like 2 generators. You can literally M1 to a 4k most matches on a 115% movement speed killer literally just by knowing basic shit that a killer benefits from knowing like when a pallet is unsafe, when to double back on a loop, etc. Sure when I played Huntress, Nurse, etc. I got much more consistent, faster and easier 4K games but never have I felt that it was impossible for me to get them with Doctor.
---
&gt;Also also, don't most people play survivor anyway? More people are already playing surv by design, and if there are super negative balance changes for killers, it will impact the game far more negatively than a small survivor nerf, which, by the way, I have not advocated for.
---
I'm sure more people play survivor anyways, yes. It's much more relaxed an experience then killer I feel and it has SWF so groups of people can play together. The point is that people argue shit like what I said when it's just incorrect. Most of the complaints you hear from people coming from purely biased bases. Like I said, I've heard many people say killers need to be stronger because it needs to be more fun in general so more people play killer since you need them to play the game, but the underlying comment is in short, "Buff killers." While in reality the opposite is true. You need 4x the amount of people playing survivor then you do killers, because you need 4 of them in a match. For 100,000 people to ply you would need 20,000 killers and 80,000 survivors for everybody to be able to play at once. Yes you need killers to be able to play, but the part that gets people to play shouldn't be you're just going to get fucked if you play survivor so you might as well play killer instead.
---
Also just to add on, that's one example of someone being clearly bias to one side. I've heard many people argue things that clearly come from their bias towards killer or survivor with it all basically coming down to, "I just want an easier win."

You're saying Ghostface is good but Michael is mid tier ? Michael is powerful, I'm not a good player and I still does 4k 90% of the time I play him. The problem with licensed killers is that their powers are not as simple as the normal killers which is kinda annoying, Hillbilly has a simple power and he is powerful while Ghostface has a power description with 5 paragraphs and it's complete shit anyways. Pig is not that great either
---
Does the devs know his songs?
---
People just are like that. I consider it a win if I get a decent amount of bloodpoints even if I die but other people just want to escape.
---
The hag looks nothing like the neighbor’s kids, she looks way better than them
---
If these changes are ever made I'm never playing this game again. Trapper is already so powerful!!
---
I on the other hand like Rancor because it forces you to be stealthy while also giving you a chance to still escape if you do so
---
When I play Survivor I consider having a good, fun game with over 20K points and a few WGLF stacks a win, regardless of if I die. 
---
As Killer so long as I get over 25K points and my BBQ stacks i’m happy with 2 kills. I’m generally quite merciful and won’t tunnel so sometimes I end up losing kills but I aim for points and fun games.
---
The rule of thumb I use is that if I gain a pip I win and if 1 lose a pip I lose. I consider a safety pip to be a draw

why do i care so much about people innocent or not? it is only crouching and standing btw. insta blind and spam it to the killer is toxic since it is ruining killer gameplay. crouching and stand which is called TEABAGGING is not toxic since it is not ruining killer gameplay. post chat?depend on the chat. it is toxic if flaming, shaming, etc. but if you lose hard as killer and survivor said GG :) and u butthurt, you got a problem.
---
That's true, but the matchmaking atleast toned it down somewhat a bit, like I remember running into rank 4, rank 8, rank 10 and a rank 16 when I was like a rank 16 killer and started out, it seems somewhat more balanced with the SWF group with such ranks being matched with the highest rank of the group's killer if possible, or a high ranked killer in general. Though it still can be a painful experience to play against with your rank survivors when they all communicate and manage to do some certain plays.
---
Just gonna say most people won’t watch it I barely click a 30 second video anymore. But yes a variety would be nice also changing it so mori is only possible after struggle stage hook would be nice too as I always feel like a dick doing it after one hook.

I have two win conditions weather i am playing killer or survivor  
---
Did i have fun?
---
Did i pip?
---
If the answer to either of these questions is yes then it's a win for me weather everyone made it out or not. Personally i think people take DBD a bit too seriously I've had some very upset people come by my stream just to give me shit for them having a bad game (don't be those guys)
---
I also think people take tbagging and killer nodding WAAAAY to seriously, i like to think of it as a bit of ingame banter, survivor just dropped a pallet on my face? Tbag? Noice! you know you got me! Killer nodding like a mong because he just mind gamed the shit outta me?? EZCLAP well played. People need to step off the ego train and have some fun!

The game’s code couldn’t handle 2 Lauries in 1 game

TTV means thay are a twitch streamer(twitch TV) They get salty as they are probably live and they are embarresed that you made the look a fool in front of their fans by beating them
---
I thought the point of the game was to work as a team?
---
The pig is the only one that isn't. Sure the pig got nerfs, but the devs didn't 'come for her'. It was purely a result of making endgame work, which she definitely took a hit. But it was unfortunate that the pigs meta playstyle was to fuck everyone over at the very end of the game.
---
I'm sure they are trying to work this out in a sensible way..
---
Oh - the other 'nerf' on her was a bug that they removed, and people went nuts about it lol.
---
Agreed! It has definitely gotten a bit better but I also get it still happens since you can't stop people from SWF 4 stack
---
So your telling me that gameplay is toxic? You know, items that you get in game are toxic? That isn't true because they are also part of the game. I'm starting to think your one of those killer mains who hates stuns and flashlights. And if this is all the case then why should I care about a killer who let's themselves get blind or stunned because they're bad?
---
I've been getting views. But I usually put a topic as well to engage conversation. I just wish they had a better method. Currently the blood web method is nice and all, but you only get so many. It helps with the challenge of getting rid of problem players early. The se ond method is devour hope, and we all know how that goes.
---
I love a tactile strike.
---
I feel he needs a rework, his power is just to easy to counter by just dropping pallets early like a noob. There is plenty of pallets and with the current gens speed you still easily escape.

Rework takes time so before that you can give him small buffs like, faster reload(the base one is goddamn awful, when I play without the cork I feel super clumsy), maybe flask of bleach and one of the feathers base kit? His slowdown after throwing a bottle makes his power almost pointless at a lot of loops.
---
I don’t mean the perks working together. I’m talking about independently. Basically, I’m asking if you can kick a gen after it explodes with Surge or if you have to wait for someone to touch it
---
It is a common mistake
---
Only normal for people using coms in a game that was never meant for it. Sorry, but if you have to follow a killer around instead of doing objectives, for the sole purpose of gaining intel, you bad. Learning where Trappers usually trap and knowing to avoid key spots or preemptively checking those spots is a lot more skillful than "JOE! He trapped the Cow Tree! Don't come over here, yeah he's headed to the killer shack. I'll get these then get those!"
---
Well hope I'll manage to finish it, the rewards are sick af
---
I will say this: his perks are designed for the endgame; Fire Up is pretty much pointless, Remember Me got nerfed (still could make for some clutch plays though), but **Blood Warden** is a perk that can change the entire outcome of the game. That being said, he may not be top tier, but I can’t recommend enough giving him a try. Dump enough points into him to unlock four perk slots, and roll with whatever you have; I all but guarantee you’re gonna enjoy it.
---
As someone else at rank one, I see both keys and moris pretty frequently. Especially during and after events/bloodhunts.
---
I love it, all the time they could be running away and they chose to waste a pallet... and stand there acting tough? I'll take it!
---
Ugh.
---
The thing is though, Michael F. April did a really good job on the dead by daylight soundtrack and the devs might not wanna just swap out the music he created for their game for some other person who started making music for the game years later. Then again, it'd definitely add more to the experience and it'd be a breath of fresh air and something new to refresh the game. Me personally, I'd love the addition, but I simply don't see it happening.
---
Yo when I started playing DBD I played for like one and a half months only trapper and got to rank 6. I don't think he's underpowered when you get a feeling where to place the traps
---
I don’t want to argue but the pig has only  ever received one buff since I got the game and that was oblivious crouch. They keep nerfing her for similar reasons as they did freddy a way to hight low rank kill count but a low high rank kill count.
---
i gthink pumpkin head would make more sense then a xenomorph cause he is more controllable
---
I am a killer main, I made the mistake of playing with my friends.  Spirit is stronger than most of the other killers and my reason for DCing is valid against the blueberry bitch.
---
Totally deserved.
---
No matter the reason, you should never be toxic to other players.
---
969th upvote.
---
no you wrong. i play both side but mostly as survivor. insta blind wombo combo is toxic, thats why dev rework it. it ruin the gameplay because it is INSTABLIND ( which is killer cannot see for long time with combo blind ) . sad for low tier killer.but tbagging is not toxic at all because it is not changing the gameplay.
---
Pain reliever has awesome guides for that
---
If surge pops while someone is on it then yes because it counts as if it was tapped. Otherwise you have to wait until it's tapped.
---
Ok thank you
---
That bad of an experience with Head on?
---
I mean they have Billy and Bubba and one is just a direct rip off of the other
---
Teabagging is harmless, I get teabagged when I’m killer, let’s not act like it’s an awful thing
---
Fair enough. And yeah with a screen pop and bang.
---
They will stay, but they can only be bought for auric cells afterwards. These days showing dedication isn't store skins it's bloody stuff you get from prestiging your chars.
---
I won't say the store skins are bad but they are only gonna single you out and make killers spot you easier, Pink haired Nea's, Blue haired Feng's or anything that makes you stick out like a sore thumb you can spot a mile away, those chars can't even hide when they try... the dark red from bloody gear has a natural camouflage in the game so it helps to stay on the downlow if you need to!
---
Yeah, you're right. I must have misread the offering because i swore there was 4, but i was wrong.
---
Well its funny
---
Its a fair point and i'm not denying she has taken hits and she likely needs some help now. But I just find it funny the way people act like shes been targetted and bullied with nerfs, when the uproar only came in after EGC and every way you look at it something in her build had to change. EGC was put on for killer QOL too. So you can see why they pushed it through. 
---
But legion nurse and spirit are completely different. They have been targeted for reasons like being broken or being op (apparently)
---
I pretty much never get to play against a LF:( And my name is "Mori me leatherface" so its quite depressing. In my experience only low rank Bubbas camp tho.
---
You certaintly meant to say "game design", haven't you?
---
The game engine is capable for much more. Hell, they can make DbD auto-chess if they want on this engine.
---
I agree, but not all. For example, my build is M+A, Nurse's, BBQ, and Ruin. I'm thinking of trading out Ruin or Monitor for Stridor, though.
---
They all brought medkits.
---
Alrighty then pussy boy. You can't have it both ways. Either get good and quit crying online or find a new game to play.
---
Ok i went yes, yes, yes until you said "keys are fine". Everything else? Great points, this? Not so much
---
I was referencing the movie smartass The franchise is called saw
---
You do understand they probably were doing a gen while contributing to the team even if not by healing? Also did your friend have kindred? Cause if not, you are the asshole.
---
I love playing Trapper too but I feel like this one is a bit difficult to justify. Not every map is good for every killer. I really don't want certain maps on Myers/ Hillbilly whereas others are much better. Trapper and Hag both do extremely well on Haddonfield and other killers do not etc.   
---
I think the dark traps are already very strong and don't need to be more transparent, because that would make it impossible to see them in grass. I definitely think he should not have to spend all the time picking up and resetting and should carry two traps at base. But the dark traps are fine to me.
---
And because you get teabagged as a killer you must teabag as a survivor. Gotcha.
---
This way of thinking is the reason that toxicity refuses to die in DBD.
---
_"It's OK to face camp, killers do that to me all the time!"_
---
and it smells like shit
---
Depending on how you play, M&amp;A can be good, but overall Distressing is better since it'll give you the bigger TR all the time (and the BP from deviousness and Doc. Carter is one devious SoB), the doctor doesn't really benefit from being sneaky and the 10% vision you get from it is lost during chases as well.
---
read again, i said it was 6 months ago. not now lmao. people who take tbagging and nodding killer as toxic is try hard gamer that consider win is absolute and cannot take a joke on games.  
---
imagine when play survivor and stun killer, start tbagging which is saying "you not getting me now" or "LMAO" and killer start fill with rage.  
---
or either way when survivor down and hooked, killer start shake their head which is saying "you cannot escape" or "not today sir", and survivor going mad about it.
---
This is me but with Bond - no one is safe 😂
---
So repairing 4 gens is possible? If you use that logic, all of these tomes are possible- and you shouldnt have to run an entirely different build for a single tome, all the other tomes just need one perk.
---
Otz doesnt tunnel that often though until he gets pissed at a survivor which is rightfully so usually. And otz is always trying to be good sport too. Also otz doesnt facecamp as much either or at all of what I know.
---
Thought as much
---
Will look him up, cheers
---
Bubba's or trapper's basement seem like the only way to go :/
---
no, you can't because the gen is already damaged
---
He's fast and intimidating. That's about it.
---
In the words of another user on this sub, when commenting on the Pig's RBT: "It's almost like making a killers power based entirely on RNG is a bad idea." 
---
Now the Trapper can still control WHERE to set the traps, but you get my drift.

So what you're saying is SWF shouldn't be able to communicate? Interesting, I thought it was the point of it. Besides, this strategy is easily counterable by moving traps, not putting all of them at the same time at the beginning and just playing Trapper normally. If your traps get spotted by survivors, you bad.
---
Call down, Karen.
---
I second that.  Pain Reliever has some amazing DBD content.
---
I mean hey, it's not a reddit meme if it isn't painfully overused amirite?
---
I consider a safety pip a lose aswell because who ever I’m facing they’ll probably pip (unless it’s an afk killer) while I didn’t. 
---
But yeah, pretty much this.
---
and killer gets -1 pup while the two survivors get +2 pip.
---
The killer should let the survivors do all but hook them both at the end.
---
Tier 5, T O M E  4  L E A K E D
---
Baby michael is thw holiest creature of this earth. Omg I want a baby demogorgon made too. Imagine how cute it would be.
---
It was warranted us not helping the player if anything it was lack of doing anything when we could see their aura while we were on the hooks
---
I always thought destroy dick december instead dont dildo december
---
great cant wait for more posts about tier 5 being leaked
---
We would need a whole clip to proove he wasnt doing anything. Words hold little weight in text form.
---
I'm sure we'll get 2 within the hour.
---
It's the same misplaced sentimentality that keeps Ubisoft from buffing Tachanka in Siege. All available characters should be viable choices in a competitive game.
---
I want them to add a killer that has fire was a main power, that would be so damn cool
---
I’d say Demogorgon has the best 3 gen strat, since he can do it with ANY 3 gens.
---
I literally just addressed that part in another place on this very same thread. Where I said that that one is the only truly impossible one, because it says "COMPLETELY repair 4 generators in a single trial" meaning if someone even so much as taps one, you can't get it by that description.
---
The point of tomes is to run different builds. Get out of your little sad comfort bubble and try new things.
---
Why? It´s more fun when they cleanse. Then you can actually use her power and have a fun game.
---
I don´t wanna spend the entire game chasing broken survivors and M1ing.
---
 oh yes he is. he is going super tunnel when seeing key. he is going super tunnel if eat DS. he is slugging the survivor almost all game. this is only my opinion btw. i just dont like when player ruin other player gameplay because they disagree about something ( key, DS, flashlight, tbag ). only killer can ruin the game btw, survivor only follow the flow except gen rush.
---
&gt;Teabagging is harmless
---
Yeah you are bm'ing a killer. Its harmless but you are being a complete asshole. And it is an awful thing. You are not being good sport.
---
*sCiEnTifiCaLLy pROvEn bY PC sUPrEmAciSt ReEseArCHeS*
---
Some people really overestimate those 38 second chases.
---
I’ve never really noticed it too work but that might just be me
---
I have the, did I have fun? Did I get 4 stacks on my bbq? As killer, to me, it’s way too stressful to 4k every game- I HAVE to make light of whatever comes my way.
---
As survivor... if the game lasts’ longer than 5 minutes for me. I don’t give a shit if I escape as long as I got to actually play rather than go down super early and tunneled/found after each hook.
---
It really sucks, they should change it quickly, DBD would only benefit from getting the playerbase boost that the Game Pass gives.
---
Not sure if the game is on sale now, but it will be 50 percent off on Black Friday for sure if you want to wait until then.
---
End game builds are a thing. I think it can often be obvious when someone is using NOED too (bad player or lack of identifiable perks during the game that make an end game perk build obvious). Taking totems is something decent players will do if they can see that (or they will at least memorise where they all are along the way). If I'm playing with friends and the game has been so easy that we have the ability to take the time to find all the totems we will absolutely do that. It's saved us from getting downed to NOED more times than I can count.
---
Ok dude , who is buying consoles in 2019 exept casuals , tell me
---
The faster recovery is the difference between the survivor making it to the next loop or not, which is a huge time save.
---
The shorter your chase time the faster you start to snowball and apply pressure.
---
You didn’t have to write a whole essay, a win is whatever any considers a win, an escape even if you de pip could be a win for some people, running the killer round and dying with just boldness points could be a win etc. It just depends what people go for and are satisfied with
---
yes, there is some shitty personality gamer that make them happy when he ruin other player day. you know, that kind doesnt like you happy . typical "when i sad, you should sad too"
---
peepeepoopoo
---
Fixated isn’t for walking faster, it’s so you know exactly where Spirit can trace your steps and you can mind game her. She only has so much time to track you.
---
You’re acting like all Spirits use purple addons and Sloppy Butcher to track you every match, they aren’t.
---
On second thought, have you even played as Spirit?
---
Yea, but it's the only other way to do a mori. Which isn't all too helpful if the survivors actually scour the area. That hex totem has to be tucked away,  and even then, after they notice you have one... goodbye.
---
Nobody has time for Ruin but it seems to be a main perk lately. And if that perk isnt ran then NOED surely is on there.
---
Well he gets 0 terror radius with no red glow through out the game, it’s very hard as a survivor to see how he’s trying to mind game you
---
If hillbilly sees this comment, I want u to know that I appreciate it.
---
The most I have waited for a match is about 15 minutes. I would say after that amount of time, you should restart the game and try again. No, waiting 3 hours to be matched is not typical. There would be uproar if that were the norm.
---
The Xenomorph in particular, and the chemical it derives from, is actually supposed to be the pinnacle life form. Something that goes as far as even conquering the metaphysical and supernatural in some of the old lore.
---
For example, a hive of xenomorphs that was contained in a Wey-Yu facility on Earth managed to psychologically torment and influence a group of religious fanatics into not only worshiping them, but releasing them [where they proceeded to conquer all of Earth in a short period of time], all in a way that could be described as "telepathy" and/or even mind control.
---
I never get the point of this negativity. I always say “I love you &lt;3” whenever a killer gives me the hatch because they never have to.
---
Just bought it, really want to play before the halloween event is gone :D
---
Ah yes, the daily swap glitch. Doesn't it only happen with sabotage rituals?
---
Sir, this is a Wendys.
---
I’ll proximity camp but only if I get t-bagged and hit with multiple flashlights
---
No shit
---
Demogorgon is really good. His Shred should be underestimated. Lol even Tru3ta1ent gets hit by it when playing survivor and is surprised.
---
Huh? Yeah I'm aware.
---
i understand hating camping but, when it comes to tunneling, id rather play better than fair, especially when a single down can mean me winning etc.
---
kids these days smdh
---
That's the thing though Ghostface's power is easier to counter than Myers'. Myers' tier 3 is hard to avoid at some point and he stil has better gen defense and map control than Ghostface imo
---
I'm not trying to say Demogorgon is leagues ahead of Freddy - they're like literally within one spot of one another.
---
I am also a bot that parrots Scott, however, so take that as you will. I just agree that Demo is consistently slightly better than Freddy.
---
I've tried restarting a couple of times. I can only assume it's a population issue with the Windows store version given it's a new release on gamepass. Guess I'll just have to give it a miss until cross play with Steam arrives. Shame was looking forward to it.
---
**ITS A TRAP**
---
We also have a nurse
---
I don’t mind face campers, most of the time I deserve it.
---
wait why does he have a pipe?
---
Devilishly evil 😈
---
honestly
---
I was Michael and I killed two survivors and realized one of the last two were afk. I had the David farm heals off of the afk Dwight while I farmed downs and hooks right when I was about to sacrifice Dwight and let David escape the Dwight came back and ran away. We spent five minutes looking for him. I was trying to let them both escape but Dwight didn’t get the hint and ran evertime I came to a gen. He eventually DCed and I let David go.
---
Oh. I missed that part of your post. Yes, I think most PC players are on steam. So that is most likely your issue. I would suggest you contact gaming support and maybe you can get a refund. No point in paying for a game you can't even play.
---
that is more fun with a scratch mirror myers the only scary part of praying beads is that it still is in the game
---
Oh, thank you :)
---
Xenomorph would literally just be reskinned Demogorgon, but with a tail.
---
I completely agree with you, I've been playing since the release of Michael and yes SWF always made it worse but at the same time I understand wanting to play this game with friends in voicechat it's just so fun. But yes most of the time they are toxic and it's just fucking annoying.
---
That's what I keep telling to survivors that I didn't save though they decided they should insult for not trying to save them while there was NOED and the killer camping in front of them. When I die and I got 20-25k I'm not mad, could've had 5k more points but whatever. One time this guy did nothing throughout the whole game and when we were only two remaining he just hid to wait for me to die and get the hatch. In the end, he only got 11k.
---
So yeah I agree but I think this game just convolutes toxicity from survivors to killer and from survivors to other survivors which is definetly a problem
---
Unless if you have a 3 gen
---
Play as the killer and then baby them till they get it, never making it unwinnable but giving them a taste of what the game is like.
---
There really is no reason to get 4Ks really. I don´t want to rank up, ranking system gives no rewards anyway and I would rather stay around mid ranks where I can actually have some fun instead of having to sweat every game against high rank survivor groups.
---
You know you beat them anyway, giving the hatch is the least I can do to make them know it was a good game.
---
As much as i would love to have an outlast chapter i dont think we could for the simple fact we never see miles or blakes face. I would love the chick with the sythe as a killer tho
---
Preach
---
except i did indeed win the argument? LMAO ENTITLED? BAHAHAHAHA BRUH, i say the things i do because they are the truth, they did indeed have plenty of time to test the dedicated servers, they did indeed get enough feedback to make a judgement call, they did indeed make a bad call, a mistake, and they did indeed ignore the feedback and issues and release them to the live branch when they weren't ready, thats the devs fuck up, how can you not understand this? And you call me dense... Theres a reason we have a testing branch for the game. The devs rushed an unfinished broken and have broken the game in doing so, the live branch of the game is NOT a testing branch, you do NOT released unfinished products there for further testing, they also didn't say that they were still in testing when they released them to the live branch. So tell me again, given everything i have said is proven fact, tell me how my truth isn't the truth? The devs released an unfinished product for no reason, we have a testing branch and they had gotten feedback on the servers, they ignored both those things and released them anyway. Why? Probably all the little shit cunts that have bad internet complaining so to shut them up the devs released the servers, RUSHED to release them. Im impatient? Na i was perfectly fine waiting for them to be ready, all you had to do was the leave a lobby with anything above 60 ping but no im the impatient one.....this guy talking all his shit without anything to back his claims, go run your mouth somewhere else.
---
Yeah, I imagined it was because you were doing something else, but I would have done it anyway because I really wanted to explain him that everything he said was wrong.
---
it will work with walking nurse
---
if you are mindful of the killer it can be an A tier perk
---
you can: know where every broken pallet is, know where the killer is, and know wich gens are regressing
---
the only problem is that it doesn't really work against wraith (since he breaks most things in stealth) and is very inconsistent agains any other stealth killer 
---
I need to confirm, but I think it should light up agains stealth killers even if you can't see their aura
---
Still cute, never forget D'Artagnan.
---
I can just imagine Trapper seeing a survivor and just fukin YEETING a trap under their feet
---
This is usually how I play when I have a Mori daily. I just want the one kill. The rest go free.
---
Their idea of fixing or buffing something is waiting 3 years before they do a rework, rather than actually making small balance changes to the things that need them because they're incompetent :)
---
I was speaking overly simplistic.  There are smart ways to cleanse and it does give me, as killer, another way to go after them.  I was honestly speaking more of survivors that cleanse immediately after unhooking, near other survivors where I'm active, in dangerous areas, or anything that screws over their team.
---
I had one game once where two survivors were in the basement and the last gen was done.  One sick survivor was on the door that was within shot of the killer shack.  Survivor cleanses up top and runs into the basement to unhook both survivors.  I downed three of the four survivors with one vomit wave.  The other smartly choose to run out the door.
---
I can feel this image
---
I love him. Actually I'm upgrading him and I'm considering to buy him an outfit. He was my first you know, and then I left him. I'm must make up for him.
---
This, specially because OP don't have the 9k shards yet
---
Can we talk about how Dead Hard is completely useless now? It seems like it's more often players get exhausted and hit than it actually works like it's supposed to.
---
He is not in par with the wraith, that killer is weak but fun to play legion is a piece of shit in every aspect
---
When i played the killer gave me mercy but killed the other guy
---
Demogorgon better than ghostface and Freddy but not in this game, not against rank 1s lol
---
Bloodlust would work with this template too
---
then ambus will work with all perks, like noed. yay
---
Spirit just needs an addon rework and cosmetics rework since it’s those that are most broken
---
It means the post/reply in question is meant as sarcasm.
---
/s means sarcasm :p
---
I think stunning a Killer 4 times a trial is very unlikely. It isn’t impossible, but Killers either are gonna have to let you, or be an actual potato themselves
---
I just want the Alchemist.
---
Game pass on PC. Get it on steam, I played all night last night and had instant queues as survivor!
---
Not to mention that slamming a pallet on a killer could be seen as fighting back...
---
Oh thanks
---
Billy top tier lol I thought that myth was dead.
---
No problem.
---
How y’all mfs look dc’ing because you don’t like the killer 🤡
---
Every Killer would slug then. It happens a lot, that the Survivor is inside a pallet-area. In SWF Groups this would be abused a lot. Sure theoretically it doesn´t make sense, that the Killer doesn´t get stunnend while the Animation is playing but for sure this would be way to strong for Survivors.
---
I don't see why some of the others can't make sense
---
Y'know I'd say the exact opposite as a red rank player who mains all 3 of those killers.
---
I guess that would be op :D ...maybe not being able to throw while in a chase?
---
After he let you farm enough pips to double pip...
---
2 weeks after we got the archives, i don't remember the exact date.
---
But like 15 of those killers can literally be countered the exact same way, using loops which has nothing to do with perks. Basically if they choose the other 15 you basically win as long as your team isn’t trying to kill you, you don’t need perks to counter these killers.
---
If you see a lot of the good streamers, they never respect pallets. Almost any good killer will try to swing through a pallet unless it's unsafe. Plus, Head On is so great if you're in the right place at the right time. 
---
It'll be challenging, for sure though. Lower ranks it'll be easy.
---
WHAT CAN I SAY EXCEPT "I strongly agree".
---
You're walking around going for the unhook when SNAP.  You have stepped in a trap.  Desperately you try to get yourself out but to no use.  It's your 5th try and you hear the terror radius. You can see him coming for you, another trap in his hand. You got out of the trap! 
---
Unfortunately for you Trapper got too close so you Dead Hard only to still get hit and fall to the ground. Exhausted
---
OwOwOwOwO
---
&gt;I like Stranger Things
---
The BIAS was found.
---
Usually not one to be a fan of lagfest posts but this is worse than anything I've seen personally.
---
Also, my first down was a similar hit, just less extreme.
---
Who dat?
---
Oh i am sure he is strong and fun to play, i was just referring to teachable priority. The problem is that even with lv 15 i might have nothing to work with, and it takes so long to get to 40 that i wanna get it over with and then enjoy being able to compose builds for all killers
---
Otz is looking for you

...Liking a show does not exclude me from liking Scream and NOES. I'd say I like the two of them even more than Stranger Things. Weird argument you're presenting here. Reddit icons and "bias." Cool.
---
OoO in general is quite problematic. It needs some changing.
---
I fuckin love otzdarva, he is such a wholesome god of dbd.

Survivors to other survivors... reminds me. I was playing a match with my SO the other day and we had an obvious second duo with us who... would ONLY save each other. ONLY help each other. I'm like wtf kind of point is that??? I got so fucking pissed I pallet-sandbagged one of them because they were sandbagging my ass while the killer was chasing me.
---
When my SO and I play together, the most we coordinate is who is saving who to make sure people are getting saved, and giving a heads up to who the killer is. We try to play fair, and also help out the other 2 with us. I never understood that match. Ugh.
---
Usually if I get unhooked and don't hear the terror radius (depends on killer tbh) I usually let them heal me under hook. People who run this perk are gangsta tbh
---
A regular shark.  There could be an aquarium map where he swims and survivors do genes on catwalks above tanks.  He could jump out our the water.  On all the other maps he could just T pose and hover around.
---
I wish
---
No you cannot.
---
This is one of the best comebacks to a dumb comment I've ever seen. I'm stealing it.
---
I think Legion is underrated but he's not a top killer. Everyone would agree with that.
---
Nurse is trash on console. Basically unusable.
---
I said in 2 places now that yeah, I agree that the 4 gens is impossible. That's the only one I think is, though. The rest are simply challenging.
---
4 basement sacrifices is EZ running a basement build.
---
Nope, overcharges works only if you kick the gen. Same as Pgtw
---
And add
---
Worst comes to worst, go in the basement so they don't get chase/altruism points. They'll win, but miss out on a lot of points.
---
How did you post an image into a text post?
---
His tier 55 machete looks dope. I really want it
---
I'd love to see that in the game it sounds like a awesome character
---
They still haven't fixed the trap setting animation too
---
True
---
Freddy can also have fake pallets, yes it's add-on, but it's really satisfying to see a survivor drop one and see them shit their pants. It's the only reason I ever play Freddy tbqh. He can also teleport to a gen or fake teleporting to it to really fuck with the survivors. Now that I think about it, I should play Freddy some more.
---
Keys are so unbalanced, it basically takes 2 gens, the endgame collapse, and the exit gate opening of the table. Unless they try to get the others through the hatch, they're gone before the endgame
---
Observer is the Micro Machines guy, confirmed.
---
5m. ago when I played her and wiped a 4-man SWF team with one hits...  
---
But yeah, you actually need skill to apply the disease fast and efficient, have fun with no-skill Myers and The Ghost Face...
---
DotA 2?
---
Lol. To be fair I do usually try to avoid the gen he's doing on, but sometimes it's just the place I know there's a pallet and I just run to the glowing gen like "hey bringing an angry chainsaw man to you lots of love. &lt;3"
---
Traps should have a timed interaction as difficult as Doc's (obviously, without the shock and everything)
---
I’m really not sure but I have thought the same thing for at least the aesthetics of him, his figure, the whole nine yards. I’d personally like to see Jason himself come to the game. But you know ... with the lawsuit and all, that won’t be happening any time soon. 😩
---
Yeah I’m interested too
---
Either would be dope
---
Tachanka is an interesting case in his own right but this isn't r/rainbow6.
---
In regards to Trapper he doesn't have the same "meme status" as Tachanka, so there's no "keeping the meme alive" justification to keeping him weak. The closest we had to that was Freddy and I mean... yeah he was buffed.
---
Yeah I swear half my matches people are just allergic to healing or something
---
Fun is good. :)
---
And I laughed at the wikipedia entry for dbd, where they point out, that the game has a bad reputation for a "volatile" playerbase. xD
---
I mean so is Demogorgon. The Entity could just fool the Xenomorph into thinking that it is a Queen. If Weyland Yutani can control them (doesn't end well) then The Entity can too.

So basically you tunnel

I totally don't want to offend you, but I wonder if you are the freddy that I encountered yesterday haha 
---
He REALLY was trash camper and tunneler, but I kinda feel all your points would be his excuses to his toxic playstyle.
---
Anyway, you are right, some SWFs are so extremely cocky, they snowball their game into easy 4k and then proceed to callout killers as if it was their fault that they got their 4k handled on silver plate by survs.
---
Will try, thanks. I would like to try other methods before reinstalling because my internet is crap.
---
You want a medal ? You can be lvl 70 or devotion 5 it doesn't change anything, if you think Ghostface is a good killer overall then you clearly haven't played him enough in 4,5 out of 18 of those months. He has no map control, no gen protection and a very low lethality. He's even more terrible on console. "Every killer is good in good hands" doesn't mean all killers have the same natural capabilities hence why tiers exist. You can make 4ks on old Freddy while not doing 4ks on Nurse, it doesn't change the fact that Nurse is the most naturally powerful killer in the fact. But if you have more experience with Freddy than Nurse then yeah you will have better results on the former.
---
Ghostface and Pig are probably the worse licensed killers (if we exclude the shit mess that is Bubba) depending on their lethality, map control and gen protection, which directly comes from their weak powers. Demogorgon is really good since the pallet buff, not a top tier killer but in high middle I would say. Pig needs a buff either on the crouch and rush or the traps.
---
Where did you read that?
---
Why do people wanna BM so much? It ain’t cool man it ruins the game for some people
---
In game if you go to the news tab
---
After reading my title again, I would like to change it to: "Why do SOME people consider..."  
---
Never a good idea to generalize. :P :)
---
I'm impatient so I applaud it
---
yeah i just ran around the edges of the hospital a few times
---
People like you always crying about NOED smh
---
I know right it's so anything, how many times I've played with 3 stacks and they weren't helping me like seriously those people are cancer. It's like playing Overwatch where there's a 2 stack in the team and the healer only heals his mate.
---
NGL I watch Otz play Trapper so much I see a Trapper now and think "Ohhh I am fucked" because he does it so well. 
---
Admittedly, it would be nice to not trigger your own traps, though.
---
I feel like the Babadook wouldn't fit in at all: It's not a slasher monster, it's closer to an allegory for depression/grief, or hating your child. It would lose everything that made it special/unnerving if it was dropped into DBD and forced to be pallet-looped and teabagged.
---
Ik. But putting Jigsaw in the title instead gives it more attention.
---
Guy in Blight cutscenes and in The Hunter story. Presumably Benedict (the one who wrote journals and little entry to the bio)
---
Yea but waiting out the killer queues is not worth it (at least for me)
---
You say it like it’s a bad thing that the killer can’t tunnel you or slug you haha. Tunneling and slugging completely ruins the game for survivors.
---
Yea it can't be good for the newer players constantly getting stepped on by experienced players.
---
The most obvious example of Behaviour "not balancing around SWF" is Object of Obsession. Object is a perk that's in *desperate* need of a rework since it's nearly worthless in a single-player environment but literally game-breaking in a SWF environment.
---
I was dicking around with a friend once and we both equipped Object of Obsession as a meme. (He literally named himself "I'm running Object" on Steam and I equipped the 👀 build [Object, Dark Sense, Kindred, Deja-Vu] because I was bored.) We literally ran into a Wraith who, after about a minute of playing, just gave up and started repeatedly ringing his bell as he walked around the map. We asked him if he was deranking in in the post-game chat and he flat out told us "There's two Object of Obsession users against Wraith. I'm not going to be able to do anything this game." Object shuts down so many Killers it's ridiculous, and the only downside of "makes you easy to find" is rendered completely mute when you're playing in Survivor Team 6 and are the LAS (Laurie Asshole Strode) Drone.
---
Also the fact that it's incredibly easy for a semi-competent Survivor to loop any non-Nurse / Spirit Killer for 5 gens, especially if the other Survivors are using toolboxes and Prove Thyself, but that's another issue entirely.
---
no i'm on desktop.
---
Don't forget he is also 1/17 killers whose power is directly countered by both the luck and sabotage mechanics. Can you imagine if both of those tools were actually viable for survivors, trapper would be in an even worse position.
---
Any time I'm in a game as killer and 2+ survivors DC the moment they go down for the first time, I let the survivors farm. Feels good.   
---
Doesn't feel so good when you go into your next game, kill all 4 and get shitty toxic messages at the end though.
---
How2Trapper:
---
1. Equip Tar Bottle
---
2. Get The Game
---
3. Cry
---
Thats very true
---
I got this by slugging a survivor after all the generators were done, then I just opened an exit gate myself to trigger the collapse.
---
I'm sure people will suggest NOED + Blood Warden but it's easy enough without. Just be willing to slug.
---
Even without the actual exploits, legion was still in a real bad place, but alright, have a good day.
---
He made a post last week comparing Ruin and Surge
---
What about Predator?
---
My name is Lawrence Gordon, I'm a doctor.
---
I see, lemme check
---
what time were you playing? east coast time and I play on Xbox.
---
I can assure you I do not tunnel. I hate having gens getting done so I stick to gen and map pressure to keep the survivors on edge and try to break them up so they can't gang up on gens.
---
I just played my normal game (no endgame perks). Got pretty competent survivors, so they did the gens, but 3 of them were on death hooks. Was lucky(?) to get 2 of them.
---
This is so frustrating.  I don't killer main but I spend equal time as both killer and survivor. They ONLY times I have ever DC is do to ridiculous amount of lag.  I am trying to get my 4K challenge done in the archives but since I have unlocked it I have had at least one person DC in every game.  Sad part is now that I am facing red rank survivors it happens more than ever.
---
I also thought for opening the hatch with a key to be a lengthy process with a noise like cleansing a hex but idk
---
what we REALLY want is dedicated servers fixed, after than Pinhead and Pennywise can come on in. Chucky would be great but he's a tiny doll, would never work, maybe Tiffany could work (Jennifer Tillys Character from bride and seed of chucky) but she doesn't have any powers, chuck is pretty much impossible for a game like this. Xenomorph is cool but how would that work? He'd be like a speed 3 million hes so speedy and what would his powers be? We know he can jump like a velociraptor so like, jumping over pallets? Would he be able to plant an alien baby in your stomach and have that power be similar to pigs traps? How would you get rid of the alien in your gut? Or would it not be able to and its got a timer and if you don't escape by then the baby will explode out of you? Similar thing with Pennywise, these killers seem really cool but how would they work?
---
not a problem u just mistime it
---
this isn't 2016 where people don't have to time pallet drops and flashlight blinds correctly to get the save
---
More often than not when I go up against Trapper my thought is less "Oh no I'm gonna have to be careful about loops" and more "Oh boy free Boldness points!"
---
If you're having trouble then honestly dude just run NOED and chill till the EGC find 1 dude and face camp
---
If the killer let's me farm and get the exit gates open, they can do whatever they want with me at that point
---
"I agree that using BBQ and ruin makes the killer too strong" -uses stridor on spirit a perk that has no counter-
---
This isn't even the half of it. \^\_\^
---
I dont think its the internet cuz i already played on 2 different networks, same problem.
---
No, SWF should not communicate because it’s unfair.
---
Furthermore, all survivors should start on a hook so that killers can 4k every time.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk
---
Five gens to zero in one minute because of dcs holy fuck
---
Isn’t the undetectable a buff? Someone running OoO won’t see you but the perk will still light up, right?
---
You know how you little you care about them complaining? That's how little we care about your complaint
---
Spine chill used to be pretty good against her, as it works against her spooky form and not the husk. But with Sloppy butcher, Stridor, bleeding and visibility add-ons, etc. There's just no hiding from her anymore. Your best bet is just to run mindgames at safe loops and buy as much time as you can. Which is no fun.
---
We already had a chainsaw killer before bubba but they still did it
---
Yeah honestly why isn't this a thing? I find it so strange that if you're super close to a trap the aura just disappears. Makes picking them up a pain sometimes.

Must be a bug of some sorts, i kicked gens normally and got it, may you have to use brutal strenght? There is a couple of challenges that require it

One of the challenges require Brutal Strength, make sure you are doing the correct one.

I saw lots of these "M1 bugs" when I had UI scale not on 100% in Windows settings (doesn't matter if you're playing fullscreen or windowed)
---
With dedicated servers I feel like power activation is less reliable than on p2p build, sometimes I have to press button twice.
---
?????????
---
As a survivor main, both Myers (without tombstone) and GF are fun to go against. The only time GF (and Pig) is UNFUN to go against is when they camp hooks by crouching round a corner, but that's a problem with players more than the killers themselves.
---
And when I DO play killer, I play GF and nobody ever complains. I've had a few people kill themselves on hook immediately, but nothing more than usual.
---
I don't think he's as addon reliant as other Killers (Wraith and Legion exist) but base Trapper V.S. Bag / Setting Speed Trapper is like comparing Leatherface to Nurse. He gets such an insane power boost from the setting speed and extra trap addons, which indirectly leads to the other big issue that a huge amount of his addons are completely useless.
---
100
---
The best reason to dc.
---
Yes, while we’re at it Decisive Strike should instantly mori the killer and Borrowed Time should have an infinite radius.
---
I’m just suggesting ideas here man, you don’t have to have a go at me. If you disagree with me, sure, we can have a conversation.
---
Yes it is.
---
Nope. Cosmetics arent free therefore you can pay to win them
---
This comment is honestly very profound.
---
You can't expect much from sub 4 ranks.
---
It's the second one from the beginning, maybe I'll just do it with Brutal Strength lol but with these rank 20 wait times it's a slog
---
Small game can help find totems on Lery’s and the new map so not the worst
---
His voice reminds me of Daniel from amnesia, they should get the ancestor from DD in the future, it would make a great adition
---
This. Spirit is frustrating, but I'm okay with it. There's some counterplay to be had. But prayer beads removes her one downside. Making her all positives.
---
A possible trap balance I've seen here some time, was that the maximum traps addons are completely reworked, and the trapper can always carry 2 and starts with 2. Next, the traps don't lie around, they are all in lockers. He can reload them there, like the huntress, yet there is a global limit for how many he can take from lockers. Basically a trap pool wich can be accessed by every locker. This would also solve the proplem that survivors know who they are up against, during the introduction scene.
---
Sry have i missed something? What's "the hunger story"?
---
do most perks have a counter tho? how does one directly counter save the best for last, nurses calling, whispers, etc? Stridor is most certainly off meta. I could easily use bbq, ruin, and stridor but I’m nice and take one out. I don’t see why you find that problematic :/
---
Botany knowledge is the better pick. Useful all match to counter sloppy and no conditions need to be met.
---
No really I’m serious I just worded it wrong
---
Dude. I wish someone would write this
---
4th post I’ve seen of this.
---
Petulant cowards, the lot of em.
---
I just wrote it dude
---
I'd say he's much more perk dependant than addon dependant. The good thing about his power is that it still retains danger and lethality without needing addons to make it usable. (Legion.mp4) All of his addons make using his power easier as opposed to making it stronger. The issue is that you need those addons to make the power easier to use because it's already far more difficult and time consuming to use it.
---
I pretty much couldn't play my P3 Trapper until I got Ruin 3 on him, which resulted in me doing about 150 Bloodwebs to try to get the damn perk. But that's another discussion entirely.
---
Your map pressure, the wormholes, are your best tool. You can even use them in longer loops, since the time to place one is so low, it doesn’t waste much time in a chase. I’d recommend running some form of generator progress tracking perk, such as Surveillance or Disturbance, as this will further augment your map pressure ability. Obviously, shred is good, but never underestimate the value of the classic lunge. You can’t move the angle of your shred once you launch it, so it’s really only best used in right corridors, that is until you become skilled enough to the point you can predict the Survivors movement patters. 
---
TL;DR: wormholes, man.
---

Iron will is a thing?

taste of my own medicine? bro, posting about a funny game is not me responding to someone’s post and telling them I don’t care. stop caring what I type and go back to browsing.
---
Yeah, they really need to do something like this.
---
it's honestly a quality of life update.
---
Y’all would want rng to stay until you realize it loses you those kills. Rng is fine until you get 3 Survivors who escape their trap on their first try.
---
 Bruh you’re trying to bring back the old useless gf ,gf is weak without his power and his stalk is kinda useless atm because it either you can stalk or not stalk at all due to dedicated servers and losing progressing when being revealed  is BS in my opinion.
---
If you think about it if dbd were to put these in there might be some copyright issues with the original soundtracks owners.
---
I see where you are coming from. I routinely use Bloody Coils, Iridescent Stone, Honing Stone, the trap dyes, setting speed and the bags. 
---
I don't bother with the slower disarm / sabo, harder to escape, status effect Jaws, etc.
---
Specially cute
---
well it says “completely repair” and if i half-repaired a generator it still counted toward progression in tome 1 by half
---
 "DCing is fine as long as it's not excessive" - DBD dev  btw
---
Doesn’t matter if it’s outlier. You balance the game around the best.. and what’s the best? A RRSWF with full meta using map offerings, keys, flashlights and what have you.
---
Right now only 2 killers have a chance at beating the best. Out of 17. The game needs balancing.
---
&gt;Run Small Game
---
&gt;Run Slippery Meat
---
&gt;Run Saboteur

Unlock tiers
---
that’s the survivors fault if anything, not urs. If they 3 gen themselves then hide, they bitches.
---
Yeah that would probably be a better solution
---
You can’t say “I think using ruin and bbq makes spirit too strong” when you are using stridor as well as ruin. Like wtf. My survivor build isn’t strong, I think DS and dark sense is too strong, so use DS, BT, SB, IW. Like seriously bro😂😂
---
Unlock Tiers
---
I want an April fool's thing where they just switch the character models so that you have 1 survivor and 4 killers.
---
The rule is, at least last time I read a statement by BHVR about it, was that if you dont touch or attempt to touch a gen in ten minutes, then its holding the game hostage. Do with that information as you will.
---
Why is casually enjoying a recreational hobby inherently bad?
---
Yeah the wording is a bit confusing.
---
It makes Iron Will useless
---
Trapper is the only killer that I never get upset facing against as a survivor. Anytime I get caught in a trap or one of my allies gets trapped I just laugh because we screwed up and fell prey to what should be (in theory) one of the easiest powers to avoid.
---
Yes.
---
Yh but it’s not like you need BBQ when you have knowledge.
---
I like to use ruin, stbfl ,pop and i have a free slot dpending on how i feel. The thing with the demo is that it has food map pressure hut it relies on the player being smart enought to create that map pressure with the portals. Its mich more open to mistekes than freddys teleport, while mich more punishing than nurse or billy. Portals need to be placed smartly in places where you KNOWZ they are always goibg to be contantious, offer you an advantage or be cleansed before they become useless. Secondary to that is placibg them somewhwre hidden to suprise survivors. Using as a pseudo hag with MYC rarely works well. 
---
Now the shred is an ability that can shit of LONG loops. Ones that there is a long wall or somthing to stop the survivor from just turnibg a cormer to evade you. Shirt loops are  pigs department. The shack is a deathtrap againts demo, if you vault the window you will be hit.Also good is acting like you will pounce but when they start to run erratically or zoned away from a pallet just cancel it and m1 them. Here is where stbfl might realy good as well.
---
I opened the door myself to activate End Game and then just hooked them.
---
Since you are such a sensitive snowflake i will stop with joking to not offend you any further
---
I was just saying making a perk counter a specific killer and just his alternate power mind you - wont make the perk balanced - it would be just a big fuck you to the killer
---
If you want to make a perk more powerful - make it show safe palets in green, mindgameable pallets in yellow and trapped/blocked windows and pallets in red 
---
Its such a niche perk that people with these changes wont use it anyway but it could provide with some variety for people who dont jerk of after winning the game with bt,ds, bl/dh and adrenawin
---
Problem is, traps move when used for some ungodly reason. The shift a little making them useless. This is also why is one of his iridescent stone addon is even more useless.
---
literally the only tracking I have is what I get from rancor, which is useless if I’m in a chase, and stridor.
---
Strider counters iron will
---
I mean dead people do usually go inside a coffin.
---
Freddy is good, but he can’t beat Red Rank Survive With Friends.
---
None of the license owners own any of the music what so ever. They can’t just illegally put music in their game unless they’re trying to get fucked
---
Excuse me? Stridor COUNTERS IW completely
---
100% this, also if you can learn to jebait the shred most survivors won't go for vaults/pallets leaving them open to a normal M1 lunge but it depends on the survivor, Gorgon not really a top tier killer but he is a lot of fun to play.
---

I watched a few seconds and you were refusing to engage in the slightest chase even survivors were injured and had nowhere to go. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if you got banned for holding the game hostage.
---
"Funny l" story dude 😂👌
---
The checks in the maill baby
---
Keys definitely need a nerf. They require the bare minimum amount of skill to use and are basically zero risk for an instant reward, especially considering add ons amd ward offerings. 
---
The only two changes I want to make to keys are make the tiny bastards actually goddamn visible (console player, no graphics settings), and make it a full on interaction rather than just yeeting the hatch open and jumping right in. 
---
Keys have far too little risk for how much reward they give.
---
And before anyone says something, I think Mori's are stupid too and need changes just as bad as keys do.
---
Literally just destroy them, close hatch, watch gates. Easy
---
Not as wraith LUL
---
From what I skimmed over they were actively trying to the gens, however you never committed to a chase as you knew they were pulling you away from the gens so they could finish them. Hitting them and then going back to patrolling the gens and forcing them to heal and start over is not them holding the game hostage.

Definitely something with your mouse though, I see people on this sub complaining about controllers not working and people relate. But none of us have ever had mouse problems like this
---
Wow.
---
I agree, but I have fun doing these, except for the noed. They should just remove the noed part and make noed rounds not count towards the challenge.
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with dead by daylight
---
Never happens in other games, I tried different mice and the problem persists

Nurses Calling: Self caring away from de killer ( its easy to know if he has it) 
---
STBFL if you Are the Obsession you Can bodyblock a teammate to reduce the Stacks
---
Whispers is not really a perk that needs a counter 
---
Stridor off meta? Spirits alwahs, always use it in high ranks
---
Im thinking it'll be with other people, not equivalent.
---
&gt; It’s a multiplayer game, if the killer is just standing still, they shouldn’t be able to trick the survivor into moving away from a safe location.
---
Ghostface, Pig and Wraith can do that.
---
&gt; Just because not every killer can get a confirmed 4K based on the individual killers skill (or by just having a decent pair of headphones as spirit) doesn’t mean they don’t want viable killers. Almost all killers are actually viable and able to play with a decent success rate
---
It’s not about getting a 4K. It’s about actually having a chance at beating Red Rank Survive With Friends. When you balance a game, you balance it around the best.
---
It does because this meme is actually spammed by everyone, myself included.
---
I don’t understand why you aren’t hooking anyone?
---
The "problem" with the Trapper is that he still performs well (according to devs) despite all his flaws. This gives a reason for devs to push him low in the priority list and not give what all in all are QoL changes rather than buffs.
---
Can’t get 4 sacrifices if someone fucking DCs out of spite.

Here is the [source](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/719/CPIDC1XE8JBT.jpg) on the average party size. I'll throw in a bonus [source](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/771/II0BH5BS6HP0.jpg) for survival rate by party size too. Both from the community data request post. I don't hate SWF, and I don't want it gone. When I said the above I was paraphrasing what Tru says on a lot of his videos. I do agree to an extent though. This is coming from a person who plays mostly survivor these days, and who has enjoyed playing SWF with many people. It causes a lot of problems. They need to do something to normalize performance between solo queue and SWF, because the current state of balance is ridiculous.  
---
As for Spirit, playing at red, ranks I see her every other game. There are 17 killers. What other ranked competitive game can you ask the community at large who the most powerful character is, and get a nearly unanimous answer? Can you imagine if something like this happened in League of Legends? Well it did, and his name was Kassadin. IDK if you are familiar with the game, but when he became recognized in the same way that Spirit is, his ban rate topped out at 99.52%. When a character becomes recognized by everyone as being the most powerful, they are clearly in need of a change.
---
Interesting concept but would eliminate the map offerings or be ruined by them
---
You won't feel the same when you rank up lol.
---
There's really only 2 problems. The first is that the game itself portrays the killer as an evil thing and the survivors altruistic regular people just looking out for each other. Because of that there's a natural tilt and hatred for killer and a strong camaraderie amongst good folks to fight against the bad thing. The second part is that killer naturally gets more BP and when you're new that's what you're in the game for. So anything the killer does that costs the survivor BP gains tilts them. This causes toxicity. The first thing can be touched on by having a separate chat in the beginning of the game killer can be a part of. The second thing can be addressed by fixing BP gains.

I'd LOVE to see a vampire.
---
Yeah, but imagine if someone really WROTE it... 
---
/s :)
---
Your comment exudes rank 15 killer energy that can't play without noed. Theres a reason no one runs noed at red ranks
---
Question: I'm thinking of getting either Legion or Plague, which one should I choose and why?
---
Don't know the name but it was one of the first nurse-tweaks streams on the ptb, when he was trying out the ultra rare where you move at 4.2, I think.
---
The best part is if you were in red ranks you would have depipped
---
You also know you are facing Freddy before seeing him. Same with Plague and her fountains.
---
Can’t have perks that are specific to 1 killer. Plus what is “ walking over the plank” do you mean a pallet?
---
I just listened to Legion's track, and let me say, if I heard that shit while being chased by a group of edgy teenagers, I would definitely not be having a good time.
---
In time, you will know the tragic extent of my failings...
---
Meme formats are used here all the time but it still has nothing to do with the game
---
Archieves.
---
A trapper who knows where to place traps in a chase is unstoppable. He’s a very difficult killer to balance out against survivors and buff for himself.
---
Honestly id  be down with the xeno. I think itd be a really. Ool addition. But I dont want that to come at the cost of getting an original killer. We have had too many licensed dlcs in a row right now. Give it a little break
---
Oh boy, they are gonna fight back in higher ranks, you will experience that You Are the victim
---
Oh. Darn.
---
saying selfcaring away from the killer is a nurses counter is like saying “just don’t get injured” is a counter to stridor. that’s dumb. bodyblocking with one person is situational, and definitely not a reliable counter. I genuinely question where tf ur getting ur info if you think stridor is used by high rank killers and I don’t get why stridor needs a counter but whispers doesn’t?
---
Yes he was refered to as The Alchemist but currently there is no proof that Vigo is The Alchemist in the Archieves and cinematics.
---
Yh but there’s always 2 sides to a story. But in this game we never know. Survivors are always camped and tunnelled, but killers never camp or tunnel them. You can’t expect some good feedback as you wouldn’t admit to camping or tunnelling so bit of a pointless post
---
Personally I play Ruin, Haunted Grounds, SWTBF and BBQ.
---
Demogorgon is all about pressure. He is a killer that can have apply a ton of pressure around the entire map, and you need to build him that way. I don´t like PGTW on him because it takes time to go kick a gen. After hooking you immediately see a survivor with BBQ, so you can portal there, which makes even inactive portals amazing because survivors don´t even know they are there. Active portals let you know themselves, and scan often, applying map-wide pressure is great when you see some survivors trying to close your portal next to a gen, immediately port there.
---
STBFL is godly on Demo and I just cannot imagine playing without it. It makes him stick so much better to survivors and end chases more quickly, which again helps with being able to port somewhere else ASAP and disrupt the survivors there once you down your target. It also helps so much against cocky greedy survivors who swarm you thinking they can get away with it. 
---
Ruin and Haunted Grounds are just great together and allow you to often get an early down easily, which helps a ton. Down a survivor early, hook him, make a portal there (inactive), go away, as soon as you hear the unhook you can portal back and chase the unhooker, and again STBFL helps you sometimes catch both here.
---
Shred is used well in longer loops, and around corners where they cannot see it coming. You also bait pallets SO easily with it, you see them trying to heal/wait near the pallet, just ready Shred and they will so often drop it and allow you to break it. Don´t respect pallets. Shred is also amazing for mindgames, when you ready it survivors start dodging left and right in anticipation and you can just not use it and close the gap a lot more easily, hitting them with a basic attack. When STBFL is stacked you can often use basic attack and then Shred immediately thanks to the lower cooldown.
---
I can see replacing Haunted Grounds with MYC, but then I would probably replace Ruin with Corrupt Intervention to help me create a portal network around the open gens more easily. I found Whispers meh with him as it often distracts me from focusing on the entire map.
---
Try to always keep 1 portal on you so you can place it ASAP and go somewhere if you notice survivors closing an important one across the map or something. He takes practice, but he is easily a great killer.
---
I really like playing Trapper and have been using him a lot lately, mainly due to the Rift stuff. It's really satisfying when you catch survivors. And I typically do pretty well with him (except I got completely wrecked by a SWF group yesterday...).But he can be really cumbersome to play as. 
---
First off, he needs to start off with 2 or 3 traps by default and I think there should be a couple more to be picked up strewn around the map. Second, I actually am ok with the mechanic of the traps being able to hurt the Trapper himself, but it's a big problem when I want to pick up a set trap so I can place it somewhere else. It feels almost impossible to line up correctly in order for the option to pop up to pick up a set trap and it takes forever to do it. I think you should just be able to say, hold down the button (R1 on PS4) and just walk over the trap to pick it up instead of how it is currently. I also think the red outline should be changed to white or something like the other killers (like Plague/Pig/Freddy) POI instead. It can sometimes be a little challenging to spot them, especially when around a gen.
---
What if the skillcheck for this perk got smaller/harder each time it was used?  That way there is some form of punishment and avoidance of infinite mori attempts and it rewarded, well, skill I guess, while also still remaining strong?
---
I mean...they all eventually got hooked.
---
He talks slow. I READ FASTER THAN THAT GUY TALKS
---
Well coming back to the topic if you have Obsession perks its okay if you focus on the other survivors, maybe they were just angry because you Were playing spirit.
---
Fix: You Silly Survivor
---
Thank you got the help! I will definitely stay away from buying bright outfits/hair! Especially since my play style is “stealthy”
---
Look he’ll turn red any second now... any second.... SEE RED! No wait that’s blood
---
That is a much better fix i shall do that
---
Oh I agree. It's not 2008 anymore and the gap between the power of a console and a PC has been bridged. I'm just curious as to the mentality of people who enjoy video games casually being bad.
---
Just so i know, they are not meant to be doing that? Its a big rule book and i havent read it all yet. It is annoying when they tunnel cos it happens alot recently to me.
---
yes, because he would be OP, but that would also not be ok.
---
I think the aura reveal should be removed from Babysitter, and instead when you unhook someone both of you don’t leave scratch marks and bloodstains for a short time
---
I really like to play Ghostface, but When ive been playing against him I only found tunnelers and teabaggers that bought him just to be toxic and unfair.
---
Clearly I am the offended, special snowflake here.
---
While the idea of green safe pallets and yellow unsafe pallets is a nice idea, it’d be too hard to implement because of the varying degrees of safety and depending on how you run the tile.
---
I think the fake pallets (Doctor as well) and blocked windows (Surge, Bamboozle) should be shown in a red aura. The perk, although by no means a strong meta perk, would allow for more situational awareness without needing to be close by.
---
You are delusional. The "you're not as tough as you think" comment could be said about you because it has no business being here.
---
I didn't have to respond to this ? You didn't have to start this comment either. 
---
Anything you are accusing me of can be said about yyou if you didn't felt like arguing then simply don't start something that can only lead to an argument, it's just that simple.
---
You can't atm
---
Laughs in Spirit
---
do you guys have a video where i could listen to the english version ? because the french one is pretty great, he's taking is time and might even too slow XD
---
Tule of thumb. I pip. It's a win. I depip. It's a loss
---
Is not the action, but the reason WHY you use it.
---
Crouching, just like words, are harmless by themselves. It's the context in you use them than can be harmful.
---
Crouching to hide? - Harmless
---
Crouching to salute? - Harmless
---
Crouching to thank? - Harmless
---
Crouching to taunt? - Toxic
---
If you don't have the ability to understand that, then I feel pity for you my friend.
---
A lot of people bring Green Moris for dailies, but some people are far too quick to assume "tOxIc EbOnY" and ragequit.
---
Still remember the one time I went up against a Clown running Instadown Bottles who hard tunnelled and Moried someone off the hook. After that he farmed with the rest of us and told us in post-game that he had a Mori daily and really didn't play Clown, and was henceforth okay with playing scummy for the daily.
---
Funny thing is there was one Nea who DCed on first down while Laurie and I were farming with the Clown. This was before Decisive Strike was nerfed and she was the only person running DS so... don't know if that says anything.
---
I don't see it for me but okay.
---
The other day I had a Bill unhook me with We'll Make It and then run *away* from **me.** I had to chase *him* to try to get a heal from him.
---
Bill players are weird.
---
Okay this is my last comment, anything you’re accusing me of can be said about you, if you simply didn’t respond nothing would hav happened, this argument isn’t worth either of our time, goodbye
---
What is the source of this meme format? It just popped out of nowhere for me.
---
Well, they have the Halloween theme.
---
Such a great killer perk
---
Then they should've pressured gens instead of healing. The time it would've taken me to get to a hook was time for them to complete the final generator. Instead of doing the objective, they decided to pick each other up. The Nea, Claudette, and Adam each could've been one of the three gens, but prioritized healing. In my mind, it was more to halt the survivors from completing the objectives by any means necessary more than dragging the match out of spite and amusement, and there's also prioritizing which gens to complete in order to avoid being locked down in a three-gen situation.
---
When you face russians for 5 matches in a row, trying their hardest to win with the strongests items, addons and perks possible(which is ok)..BUT on top of everything they tbag, spam flashlight with the macro and insult you FOR NO REASON in the end game chat, well.. 
---
Bubba and his chainsaw will become your best medical advice.
---
Last comment as well. You are repeating yourself, don't feel like arguing ? Don't start an argument. Simple.
---
I just looked him up, holy crap the Legion chase music he made is absolutely perfect.  This would bring so much life to the game and would make each killer much funner to go up against.
---
With trapper, I either get the easiest 4k of my life or all survivors escape, it seeems.
---
Wow you seem fun to play against
---
Like others have said it stands for "random number generator" which most people use as a synonym for any luck-based mechanic. The idea is that most luck-based mechanics in video games are calculated with a random number generator.
---
Essentially imagine it like a dice inside the program that's rolled every time you do something. This is also why some people will use "RNG" interchangeably when discussing tabletop games and other things that rely on luck.
---
The way they can fix this is make the generic chase music play for the first 2-5 minutes of a match so that people aren't immediately spoiled as to what killer they were up against. Then after that the Killers primary theme takes over the chases from that point on.
---
Imagine dcing against basically the most balanced character in the game
---
I agree, when I play against trapper I never get out of traps but when I play him everyone gets out instantly
---
Bloodwarden helped me get mine on my lvl 10 Freddy lol
---
oh, then that wasn't you, I play on PS4. Anyway, you sound too inteligent and reasonable to be that guy ;)
---
My freddy found me in the first, like 20 seconds of the match (my bad, he must have seem my rush for the Plunderer Instinct challenge box, which I saw at the start of the match and my bright clothed Claudette never helps - can't resist being fashionable though :P).
---
Then he was around the hook (like, 15m proximity) till almost second stage when my friend unhooked me (unsafely, but that or getting another hook stage, so whatever).
---
He tunneled me of course, got DSed, got even bigger tunnel-vision then.
---
Back to the hook, he again was not moving further than 15-20 meters.
---
I was 2-man SWF, but other 2 ppl seemed like another 2-man (identical event-clothed Jakes). I think they also got triggered at that moment, left their gens and came to check what is happening. Again, someone unhooked me totally unsafe at the last seconds, and again, I was downed there. 
---
In the end, all 3 other survs, my friend and those twin Jake guys tried to bodyblock the hook. I could tell they were, as I was, extremely triggered by how it plays out. Too bad they snowballed the rest of the match for themselves as it didnt work, me dead on hook, 2 slugs and one injured.
---
Then Freddy proceeded to do the same playstyle for one of the Jakes. Since they were short of one person, but still on 5 gens to do, even ignoring the camping didnt help much.
---
Anyway, when I msged the freddy, he told me 1. no gen was poped at the time I was hanging, so he felt he had enough of map pressure 2. that was my teams fault they bodyblocked the hook and got slugged 3. I need to accept he cant ignore the fact someone does unhooking when he is nearby (duh.)
---
So you can see he kinda used all of your arguments in the most twisted way to excuse his bad playstyle ;p
---
Dude I know...it’s like one big run on sentence. He can take just a LITTLE bit more pause in between sentences and it would make it significantly better
---
HIT THE FUCKING FIX BUTTON BHVR OR DELETE THEM
---
Again I think people are seriously overreacting. Behaviour are dumb but they're not stupid. My guess is that the level 4 challenges are placeholders that they made with the existing challenges, and they only did it to create the design for the level 4 web.
---
Stridor is fucking insane, completely counters iron will. All you need on spirit is tracking perks and you’ll still be OP. Yet you have tracking perks but also stupid perks that are not even needed. STBFL and ruin on a spirit. All you need is shadowborn
---
Have my upvote, sir.
---
Pokes head up: heelllooooo
---
I gave you an upvote, don’t worry &lt;3
---
A sure way to die on second hook.
---
Will definitely be getting them as Switch already does, we don’t have an ETA tho from what I can tell
---
Console experience.
---
You cut that out. 
---
Right now.
---
Meh, it's 1500 survival points, the hardest emblem to fill.
---
What do you guys think of a pirate themed killer?
---
Had a game against a Wraith where it took me a solid 3 seconds to drop a pallet and another 2 to vault it because he went around, least guilty feeling DC I’ve ever had.
---
What about Jon Rob? He's doing great work too
---
Honestly, i’d be beyond fine with any of these options
---
Her meta play style wasn’t endgame pig, it was a good one, but her traps were always better used as stall
---
I personally find it fine but I'm a shmuck who watches YouTube videos at 1.5x speed.
---
An option to slow down the Observer's narration would be nice I agree.
---
Jack is able to tear down walls (with cooldown) with his axe. If he tears down a metal wall then we can say the entity infused his axe with power. The basic weapon is the axe.
---
If we’re talking about game villains, i’d love to see the big guy from Outlast make an appearance, or the doctor guy, I think his name was Trager
---
Very that
---
Had a game like this a while back, we were against a Myers who didn't seem to know he could stalk so he was still in EWI  and I looped him the entire game, and I had Bond so I got to see one of my teammates just chilling there with a medkit, found out later it was an instaheal (Before the chance) so I guess they were just looking out for me. After the Myers finally caught me the final gen got done and he facecamped me the rest of the game, if one of us hadn't found a flashlight that was, I still can't believe we all made it out like that.
---
I assume they mean with like art or an animation to go with it? I don’t really know
---
It’s more op against sloppy butcher
---
Damn, idk how balanced that would be, but combine that with unique chase music and I’d be terrified to go against him.
---
*what’re you gonna do, knock my block off?*
---
Eh. Well I hope you enjoyed patrolling gens down to the last one for 20+ minutes.
---
I think survivors used to hear his cloak flap/footsteps when he was super close ( at least those were what I noticed missing )
---
No sacrifice 3 survivors with noed
---
my friend was able to see the tome 4 web
---
Actual cannibal Evan MacMillan
---
Thats still there tho ?
---
Toxic. I like it
---
Also hag and trapper traps in certain proximity to pallets can make a pallet red - this would make the perk more versatile making it a more viable choice
---
Also its not that hard to implement because its based entirely on tiles they are in - they would just need to give a tile its respected pallet colour and we are done here
---
Seems just like the pig and demo mixed. :/
---
most likely she was beginning her phase and people had already disapeared off her screen. the spirit model will still turn tho while phase is being actived, but not when fully actuve.
---
Chucks most likely won’t exist in the game he would look absolutely ridiculous
---
Where my [Automaton](https://youtu.be/6eRzBNzVohc) killer at?
---
This is literally the pig mixed with demo.
---
Sounds kinda fucking broken
---
I’d rather take a hit then get magically teleported back into the locker into their hands...
---
Yes, but a whole new killer since BHVR hates Piggy
---
Oh the fuck do they don’t. Roblox uses dedicated servers, which means constant bullshit from shitty clients
---
Well yea of course you always do good at rank 14, but hey, just don’t tunnel and I won’t care how you play killer
---
Some controls work but not all of them
---
At least I don’t sound stupid
---
Alright I want you to open a new tab/your browser, search “define offset”, read what comes up, read what I said, and read what you just said, and then have a good think. If you did it right, you’ll see that not only is that what offsetting means but also that your third sentence is a rephrasing of when I typed “S has X...”
---
I understand if I’m still getting out, but if I’ve already hit the ground and the animation has gone so far that I’m not even touching the damn locker anymore, then it shouldn’t be able to just reset like that.
---
Or just play an actual game against Trapper and this will happen
---
Meh, not really but hey, you do you buddy. Survivors lol
---
Running for your life!
---
Hmm. If the internet latency benefits the killers hit box I think it’s unbalanced but I don’t know if u have a brain
---
Nope. I actually explained why. Go ahead and read if you can. :)
---
don’t worry, you need to repair for the total progress of  4 gens. so if someone taps one of your gens, just tap another.
---
No TR/stain + increased speed + ability to attack in this state = won't ever happen
---
You either need glasses, or you need to retake 3rd grade English. Read what Peanits said again.
---
" [If they are making no attempt to down anyone](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/521124/#Comment_521124) "
---
OP was chasing, slugging, and hooking multiple survivors throughout the match. It's not their fault that the survivors refused to commit to the generators and keep running back to heal their teammates.
---
Also, that dev post is in reference to an entirely different killer whose power lets him literally prevent survivors from doing their objective. That's a massively ridiculous false equivalence.
---
Not that hard to counter honestly but I totally get why some don’t like her. And a lot of people use her because of how toxic the survivor community plays.
---
They could request permission.
---
E
---
I mean it will be similar to pig where you can hear before and there is a charge up. Plus it's similar to shred, it can be easily dodged
---
Wdym?
---
Whats up with the otz meme uprising? Nothing wrong with it, just asking because i like them
---
That’s always great, I love doing that In basement trapper build
---
It’s not requesting permission, it’s paying them a fuck ton of money which they don’t have to waste on some music
---
I see this now. Again, killers doing get emblem points for generators. I’m going to link you something to help you better understand how killer emblems work.
---
r/expectedtf2
---
Yea scratch mirror is pretty fun too, but again jump scares 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I used him because he's probably one of the best trappers but I know he's just a nice guy and a fun streamer to watch. I found his videos when i was trying to learn how to play killer and he's just super informative and fun to watch, thus memes.
---
Its not, it never is with wording like that. And thats far from the only problem one. "Loot 4 chests in a single game" is another one that raises serious questions.
---
Guess it depends on the price. I mean  I can imagine it would be that ridiculous. The Halloween theme is one of the most iconic horror songs ever, and they got ahold of it.
---
https://archive.deadbydaylight.com/manual/score/
---
This will tell you how your emblems work for both survivor and killer. The amount of generators left doesn’t affect your emblem progression as a killer.
---
Oh, I can read and you are still wrong.
---
It would only be pay to win if the paid part had some crazy stealthy cosmetics (it isn't) or if you get 'for example) claudette with glasses and those glasses gives the "bond" perk so you have an extra slot.
---
Getting more cosmetics isn't winning the game, it's fashion. Youy get to lose ... in style.
---
They're just mad you're not with the PC master race.  &gt;!it's a joke, calm down snowflakes.!&lt;
---
Touching 25 crows while using calm spirit should be a challenge on chapter two.
---
If i see a baby dwight point at crows while crouching next to them i know who will get hatch.
---
I have a concept for a survivor that can go with The Captain. His name would be Kaiden Lancey. His backstory would be that he and his father were out near the beach and Kaiden began to explore. Kaiden stumbled upon a thick mist and the remains of a ship and was never seen again.
---
His perks could include:
---
Waterlogged: When activated using the activate prompt if the killer is in a 10 meter radius the killers speed will decrease by 20%(rank 1) 25%(rank 2) 30%(rank 3) This perk has a 60 second cool down and lasts 25 seconds.
---
Quote Kaiden- Ive had expeirience out in the ocean with my dad. Hes taught me a lot I just hope it doesn't go to waste. (Waterlogged)
---
Courage: When survivors are in a 20 meter radius from you they get a 10%(rank 1) 20%(rank 2) 25%(rank 3) haste effect while working on gens, sabotaging hooks, and searching chests.
---
Quote Kaiden- The beast is coming without light well never make it out of here. (Courage)
---
Worthy call: You call upon a survivor to link with you. For the whole trial you can see each others aura and get a 25%(rank 1) 30%(rank 2) 35%(rank 3) bloodpoint bonus for you and the other survivor when near each other. (Makes you the obsession)
---
Quote Kaiden's father- Were not so different you and I. We can work together to gain more ground. Basically teamwork but better. (Worthy call)
---
Hope you guys lile the quotes.
---
You got gamer'd. GiT gUd U wAsTe Of HuMaN sPaCe

Oh god damn it. Cruel Limits, not Surge.
---
When the huntress wants to use you as a hatchet
---
I brought an ebony mori on legion, and a laurie disconnected when I hit her with frenzy. She didnt even know I had the mori
---
Yeah..
---
That fucking happened.
---
Otz is just wholesome and while he has moments when he curses a lot, he still keeps it rather cool and while being a killer main, doesnt want a killer powercreep unlike tru3ta1ent for example
---
And i dont mean this in a bad way, i watch tru3 a lot, but he wants  a really competetive shape of the game which can be unfun
---
Keep track of all the times you go against a red rank killer that has noed. Noed only activates at endgame and leaves a perk slot open where you could run a much more useful perk, especially for trapper. If you need NOED to get kills then further down the line survs at red ranks will give you a bad time
---
Usually this kind of people don't have other achievements to brag about. Like exhausting intellectual job and stuff
---
Most people will likely say to buy something thats better then both of them. Beyond that plague for effectiveness.
---
Plague is more effective then legion but can be a bit boring.
---
Legion sucks ass but is fun. Ever stab 4 survivors in 30 seconds?
---
yeah, I’m fine with Spirit being strong but like you I just want to actually feel like I can outplay her.
---
Whether you love or hate NOED, you have to love this meme. 10/10 would meme again.
---
Well if they were to have the music they would have to go through a whole legal thing with the creators and have stuff signed so theres no legal issues.
---
one thing I noticed about Otz was that even when he's like "FUCKING DEAD HARD" or "This is bullshit" he's smiling and having a good time, it's really changed how i play the game, i try to just enjoy myself more thanks to him
---
Be happy you’re close to a server then. That’s how long works my dude. The closer you are to their servers, the lest ping. It’s not luck. Me being where I live (far away from most servers for any video game company) 150 or less ping is AMAZING.
---
 I never understand why people do this, i play more survivor than killer, yes, but, come on, i already lost, why i would also lost the bloodpoints? (And the time)
---
"I think he is off me" sounds like "I think he is AWPing"
---
"Bro, dont peek mid, he's got an awp"
---
That's all right - i am just a killer main so i know this by heart, you dont have to i understood your point
---
But knowing behaviour its just too much work to expect from them
---
Ruin, mad grit, agitation, and any Aura perk. Kind of a meme build but I can't try it out
---
IDK if this would be too op of not, but if a healthy survivor escapes the trap, they should be inflicted with something like Mangled or Exhaustion, or even similar to Freddy and Clown where they get slowed down.
---
I watched a few minutes (couldnt be bothered to watch 24 minutes) and he was just hitting survivors and going back to kick gens that barely had any progress, even if that survivor had no loop nearby which meant easy down.
---
The killer power is irrelevant, doctor just makes it easier. Anyway, the post is there and you interpret as you please.
---
I guess, I don’t play Killer too much but I’m middle ranks and I never once thought “ I wish this chase was shorter” 
---
Cause most of the time they don’t even make it to a loop.
---
&lt;3
---
They don’t have the Halloween theme song. That’s their own composition not the original song or the newer version
---
Alright let me break it down so its easier for you to read.
---
Pay - Real money
---
To  - skip the grind
---
Win - cosmetics
---
Everyone here is making the silly mistake of using the negative connetation of pay to win symbolizes that you pay money to win competitively. But they forget that I am actually using the word figuratively.
---
So I had an idea all the way back then about and undertale DBD AU but I didn’t know how to present it, so all our cool programmers, get to work.
---
I think they mean like a full story lol
---
Remove her collision while phasing too.
---
Are they? Didn't notice it the last few times I played against him, maybe I had an audio issue or something, same session I had a trapper with no terror radius for me ( Nothing aiding him in that, he just didn't have a terror radius for me lmao )
---
It will be unfair and its a dick move because most console players use the controller and you just pop in like WHATS UP FUCKERS NOOBMASTER42069 UP IN THIS BITCH WITH MY 70 DOLLAR RAZER RGB KEYBOARD AND MOUSE WITH MACROS.
---
Nurse is still the best killer.
---
The game has a lot of stressful moments and there is more low tier killers the high tiers - but people tend to forget its only a game
---
I guess its easy to forget when people can assault you for no reason - but this is why we need people like otz - positive killer mains that show us that failure can easily be seen as improvement
---
This argument is making me lose brain cells. Reddit is about sharing shit from shitty games, dumb moments, toxic plays, and whatever else. The fact that someone is calling somebody out for something that people post regularly on reddit shows how upset you are the post because you are that dumbass who OP is talking about. OP, post whatever you want, the stories are interesting and hearing how people act in game makes me feel hate people but that’s part of why I am here anyway.

Pig and her head trap removal things

Hell that's why i like Noob3 also, he's just a fun guy to watch who has fun doing what he doe.
---
So how does that work with the movie costume releasing? That seems to imply they would need 2 seperete license or else they could infringe on Soneoneelse's likeness rights
---
It sounds identical, and you know just to have that tune costs money. Hell, they could redo the other ones themselves too. I wouldn't have a problem with that.
---
Same
---
You are right,but the problem is that it is not entirely clear when you should start flashing them because you must do this in the middle with end of animation hoisting. It should be a clear state (like when the killer has just put the survivor on his shoulder) and not in motion.Maybe the killer's eyes should start glowing to give a better sign.
---
It wouldn't be so problem the small window you have to achieve it if it was clearer when the animation ends. Same with pallet stuns.
---
SWF good, spirit bad for some reason?
---
It would be so nice if you could.
---
Thank you, when I saw how thirsty he was for the others I knew I had him easily, just predict his movement with the red stain too.
---
You also have to look at where Tru3 came from. Before DBD, he was competitively streaming The Culling. Granted it had a much smaller playerbase, dye to I was able to play duos with him time to time or id wreck him in solos and he would do the same to me. It was competitive high ranking game that took a lot of skill to play. More than DBD. But they are different games. Tru3 is very competitive so wanting to see a competitive are of the game is normal. As is wanting a casual experience from a casual gamer is normal. It's all in the background.
---
True, for its mori it would probably it stabs you with the blades, pulls you up then using the second mouth pierces through the skull
---
Gonna cry?
---
*RUN*
---
You do, her shards glow when she is phasing
---
Traps do not rearm by themselves. The only way to have a 30 second rearm timer is to equip the red Iridescent Stone, which will reopen a random closed trap every 30 seconds.
---
And you repair the gen 1 frames before he hits you and get NOED.
---
Aside from the rest of the responses regarding higher ranked survivors, which I agree will change your consideration significantly, I understand your base reaction to the killer side completely.  My first few times experiencing killer when the game came out left me feeling a bit wretched as well.  I had never had such a gruesome, one sided encounter.  Idk if you like lore or are into the actual backstory, but looking at each killer's background and how they came to serve the Entity will shed some light on why they do what they do, and it actually made me feel a bit more in character when killing.  
---
That feeling you have definitely goes away with more play, so as u/Meindtricks said, enjoy it while it lasts.  It's like you're the last shred of humanity the killers have before they go totally into darkness.
---
&gt;I'm not obligated to commit to chasing survivors
---
Actually, you are because its your objective to chase and hook survivors. If you are just defending generators, you are doing what peanits said in my understanding.
---
&gt;each of the generators was close to completion at various points.
---
The moments I watched two of them were turned off and you were kicking the only gen that barely had any progress to begin with.
---
I think its Xray attack in MKX is basically that. It looks pretty cool.
---
Are you injured while using it?
---
Yeah it is, that's where I got it from. But I was thinking a bit different.  Like how plague picks you up to vomit into you its similar to that. 
---
In MKX you were prone before you got vored
---
Or they don’t run it because it gets broken faster than ruin and from my experiences gets broken before the game starts or at least that’s what it feels like.
---
Yes and it still won’t work
---
Hmmm
---
Or the trapper choking out someone like the nurse
---
Ok.
---
Even though Chucky is my favorite slasher, how would that even work? You wouldn’t be able to hook anyone because of the height.
---
You see her shards glow when she is phasing
---
Pig moves slower when in stealth mode. Demogorgon has a TR before he can charge his lunge attack.
---
Na that’s incorrect, man.  All gens have to be completed for hatch to spawn with all 4 survivors left.
---
Exactly this xD
---
I did mine using no mother and got it, but that’s weird and you need to go to DBD main webpage and submit a support ticket then.
---
Ah whoops I misread, it says sabotage time and disarm time.
---
Wait why would that be useful. Almost all survivors don't even sabotage them they just disable it.
---
That is some really bad logic there. Just because YOU personally didn't have a bad time doesn't mean that others had a good time. Please go to the dbd official forums or the Steam dbd forums and just retroactively read what people were saying during the time of last years event. Also, if what you said about BHVR not taking risks is true, then we wouldn't have so many license characters. They wouldn't have had dbd on so many consoles and mobile variations. If they were not taking a risk then they would have never implemented dedicated servers. So please stop with the, "I had fun and I play dbd a lot so I must be right."
---
He’s so much better than envy lol
---
Sounds like something a casual would say
---
YMMV of course. Since Haunted Ground, my experiences have been that they don't tend to try and cleanse it until they get exposed and realize what Totem it is.
---
Steam\SteamApps\common\Dead by Daylight\DeadByDaylight\Content\UI\Icons\Banners
---
Thx I think the crawling thing would be cool but at the same time I feel it’s already similar to the pig so I was also thinking we could replace the pounce (although it does fit with the creature) with a secondary state of mind called: Hunting Prowl. 
---
While in Hunting Prowl you still crawl around at 110% movement speed and all your senses are drastically increased except for sight. You will be able to hear survivors much more loudly and you can detect survivor auras within 10 meters or so (I don’t know how far that actually is and the only reference I have is Micheal with monitor at tier ll). You are unable to see beyond 24 meters while in this state. You have a second action in this state, you can Scream, the radius has a 30 degree cone and if a survivor is within 20 meters of that scream’s cones radius Killer instinct (that being the thing you see that tracks survivors when you stab someone in Legion frenzy) will trigger for 5 seconds.
---
Yes, but the only reason they did Ash was because the more recent series put him in the spotlight again. If that series didn't exist, they probably wouldn't have picked him up.
---
No but it’s super easy to break em all by yourself. Have 1 gen get completed, use the aura to get to a totem. Use your map to find another one, break it. Rinse and repeat a few times, and get back on gens.
---
Why so long? Survivors is always long but killer is instant everytime I play!
---
I had a version of this, a teammate who wanted to heal me but I was trying to do the archive challenge of passing skill checks under This is not Happening.
---
I should have probably said before the trial started.
---
Ok y'all, this is a MEME there is legit no reason to be butthurt because your main is on here.
---
That is also amazing, I think both of those could work.
---
In french he literally stops at the end of each sentences for THREE SECONDS. It's unbearable.
---
Still skimming through it but immediately here's what I'm noticing:
---
* Your Infectious Fright is allowing you to make better informed decisions on where people are and when to pressure gens, which from the survivor's point of view might look like being a dick because they don't see when you're popping several auras after every down.
---
* They're not even attempting to try to stealth past traps. Like, I get the appeal. Constantly burst your traps so you have to set new ones. But in this specific scenario they're shooting themselves in the foot and probably wondering why nothing productive is happening.
---
* The survivors snatched defeat from the jaws of victory with this one. I know people like to act like a 3-gen strat is unbeatable, but they went into this with all 4 survivors remaining. In the time span that this took, even monkeys could figure out to split up 2 and 2 and put pressure on the two opposite gens. It's a ~44 second repair time. As soon as you see a killer go into damage control mode and break off of chases easily you have to exploit that. Instead I just see haphazard repair attempts scattered on all 3 gens. 
---
* If this was any other killer besides Hag I might be convinced this was drawn out longer than necessary. But given your options are shitty chase potential into areas with no traps or go back and defend the gens I can't blame you in the slightest. 
---
* Jesus that entire ending basement sequence was a fucking clown fiesta. I don't think they could have played that more poorly if they tried. 
---
I will freely admit, I love it when I can get a good 3 gen stack as a Doctor or Trapper. The feeling of slowly exhausting pallets and items is rare war of attrition in a game where people expect to be in and out in 5 minutes.
---
i think he was just salty because he couldn’t run me for 5 gens while his rank 20s genrushed.
---
Definitely the problem with Jason is that the only way he would ever put survivors on hooks to be sacrificed is if his mother asked him to. I hope the devs would realize they need to put that in his backstory.
---
At red ranks yesterday I had 7 2 man swfs that used keys to get out of a 3 gen it’s not that rare
---
 Yo it’s the 5th where my archive challenges at?
---
Neither of those are licensed killers though. That's my point. There's no issue when they aren't paying for a licensed character.
---
I want herobrine from Minecraft....
---
99.9% of the time there is not a legitimate reason to d/c. The only people that d/c are mentally juvenile people or people who can't figure out how to have fun on a 'potentially' lost game.
---
i mean the soundtracks fit the old killers the first but they dont fit really the new killers like spirit, nurse, plague ghostface, clown, hag
---
We got detectives hunch last shrine, I really want stake out.
---
I did it on first try while not even injured. Just had perk equipped. So it's kinda strange.
---
do you know how fast survivors do gens, especially without the pressure from bbq? sorry u find my personal preferences stupid.
---
Tunneling 1 survivor is the optimal way to play the game anyways. Despite not being very nice.
---
Known of, yes, but well enough known to make them a good financial bet? Debatable.
---
Hi,i am a xbox player and i recently bought the premius pass for the archives and i can't receive the auric cells from the pass ,please help?
---
Wha.... No.... Stake Out is in the shrine now. O.O
---
I use dh to counter those kinds of SWF that only rush gens, it works really well
---
Why did your comment get so many down votes lol
---
Depends in the rang
---
As much as I do when I agree it's not really a taste of your own medicine. It kind of just makes you come up with a massive hypocrite who doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
If you don't care about the subject don't comment on it. Commenting on a subject and saying you don't care about it just proves you care about it.
---
I would rather have his default chase music as hooked music. (Phase 2)
---
That's how the game is literally always
---
"Go look at steam forums to prove that I'm right and you're wrong". The community crying over stuff like that is always right ? Alright buddy, go check the steam forums when Freddy came out, everyone was crying about how OP he was when he was already the worst killer in the game. People will complain no matter what and there's nothing you can do. And buying well known and flourishing licenses isn't taking a risk, it's literally the opposite. You know that people are familiar with it and will probably buy it no matter what. On the other hand, an original killer you have no idea how the community will respond to that. And how is it a risk to add dedicated servers when the community has been asking for it for years ? 
---
And I never said "I had fun so the event was good", I said that my friends shared the same experience as me. And people on this subreddit mostly agree with that statement. Stop twisting my words to make it fit into your agenda. This discussion is going nowhere so let's agree to disagree.
---
I remember when sabo was permanent, you could literally make Trapper powerless.
---
Demogorgon is strong. Michael is pretty strong aswell, pig is garbage.
---
I like idea 3 best. Knowing that thanataphobia does mean fear of death I would make it give penalties for each death (7-10% for each death)
---
Dude, you ARE wrong.
---
The phrase “Pay to Win” implies some kind of mechanical advantage, such as faster reload, more grenades, etc.
---
Paying to get cosmetics is generally NOT “Pay to Win”, it’s paying to get a cosmetic.
---
Claudette can have an advantage depending on her clothing, for instance being almost entirely invisible to the Killer on a dark map. By and large, however, her BEST ones are the prestige skins. But if you were talking about it like this, THEN the Rift would he pay to win.
---
Just simply paying to get comsetics, serum, cells isn’t enough. There isn’t really a strategic advantage here
---
I feel like there are a lot of players who are as pure as this guy, but none of us find each other because the overall community is so toxic. IMO we should make our own subreddit/steam group/discord server of the pure players. just an idea.
---
Same here, was the easiest Challange ever
---
Get plague. Her perks are better for killers in general
---
The pipe is a different cosmetic outside of the outfit. You are able to buy different weapons and different torsos and heads if you dont like the full outfit
---
All I need is borrowed time, please!
---
hope we get nurses. I'm a Survivor main but all I need is nurses to complete my GhostFace build.
---
*cries in trapper main*
---
+
---
I will tell you this, I give honest feedback and truth about my game play style.  If I'm getting my ass kicked and gens are popping like crazy I will proxy a hooked survivor to at least try to get a sacrifice.  
---
If I am facing a really obnoxious trolling tea bagger, useless pallet flash lighting survivor I have face camped them, Mind you in doing so I don't care about the result of the match as a whole I simply wan't to return tool bag behavior.
---
I was thinking about environmental traps that can be spawned randomly on the walls and killer has to lure survivors into those. Maybe he can teleport between those like Freddy/Demo, but unlike Demo you can't choose their placements and maybe you can teleport from any place to your trap but within 32m radius reach so you wouldn't have a clusterfuck of teleportable traps on your screen.
---
Traps would be able to immobilize the survivor if not in TR and hurt/slow down them otherwise.
---
Something along these lines I guess.
---
i dont see this stuff on the store for xbox
---
Blake, you are being argued with by a half dozen people and yet still sit there arguing it.
---
Yer wrong, go look the phrase up. Stop arguing
---
it's not worth to use two perk slots just for reduced fall stuns
---
I believe you can use a keyboard but the mouse won't work even with an adapter
---
If you can stall them for long enough a few seconds is all it takes to save someone from a hook, or give your team a few extra seconds to look for Ruin, etc.
---
If you are looking in the microsoft store you wont see it. You have to look inside the dbd store
---
Was it on the Halloween map ? (Lumpkin road or idk how it's called in English again) 
---
Because I played huntress this morning and a similar situation happened.
---
Don’t say that about my bing bong
---
Learn to loop. It's an essential skill for any survivor since avoiding chases for an entire match is nearly impossible. Also learn common perks in the meta that will help, learning what good survivor perks to use as well as how to counter good killer perks can be a great help.
---
Also same. Just have to have the perk equipped, even if you do it while not injured, that’s how it went for me. 
---
If you were running it though, I’m not sure why it wouldn’t work
---
Yeah complete opposite of my game play lol.  I like to seem like I am EVERYWHERE and keep the survivors on edge and panning there camera while working on gens.  Gives a better chance at miss skilled checks.
---

---
ah alright then
---
You're taking the word out of context. Try dividing the word so its easier to understand for you. Read my previous comment where I broke it down for dyslexic readers.
---
i know you darn
---
&gt;Reply
---
I remember being chain blinded by purple flashlights even when facing the god damn wall.
---
Fuck off Meg!
---
"big issue" 
---
Nice.
---
I upvoted you feels bad man
---
Kinda lets survs know who the killer is right off the bat tho
---
He means a progress bar, like when you are opening gates or doing a gen.
---
Great logic there. Oh we have more people on one side so we must be right. Yikes.
---
That’s how they teased Legion and nothing about their lore, power, or visual design had anything to do with the blight/serum so I’m doubtful we’ll ever see a killer that specializes with the serum, plus it’d be weird having a bunch of skins that resemble a killer’s base skin.
---
I'm saving this, I need answers
---
I think I can live with a brown and yellow add-on being near useless until they get changed. Most brown and yellows addons are.
---
In tome 1 only challenges with lore pieces attached to them was required to be done in a single trial, in tome 4 only challenges in the middle will be like that i think
---
1. Make his traps like Huntress hatchets, carry 2 or more and refill from lockers in ADDITION to the ones spread around the map.
---
2. Give escaping a skillcheck thing where if you don't get it right you inflict stuff like Mangled or hemorrhage upon yourself.
---
3. Injure healthy survs, down injured ones.
---
4. Give him the ability to reset traps without having to pick them up. 
---
5. Change outline of traps to white 
---
6. MAYBE make it so he can't trap himself, or just make it a shorter stun and easier to pick them up without having to be an inch away.
---
Did i miss anything? BHVR should see those suggestions!
---
You monster....
---
On a serious note, why?
---
i want otz to adopt me
---
Part of Idea 3 works (collecting a weaker token upon a survivors deaths), but really it just needs a numbers buff aside from that.
---
Huntress power has to be picked up also.
---
I like idea 1, but the decreased cooldown by 32% for hitted and missed attacks is insane. This is basically unrelenting and stbfl in one perk but without the obsession PLUS the survivors get a penalty. That seems way to op
---
Cause I'm the rare circumstance that they DO have the ability to sabo traps then your fucked as most of your traps will be out of order (traps respawn after a long 3 minuites)
---
#\*HEAVY BREATHING INTENSIFIES\*
---
Well but so does the Pig. I know probably not as quick buuutttt
---
All I want is The Creeper and Pyramid Head. Then I am done.
---
I just dont find that cool man :/ as a red rank Killer dominant player, it's really annoying that I go out of my way not to bring NOED or Moris and survivors can still get bs escapes on me. Dont even get me started on hatch spawning at 5 gens left lol
---
Let them complain, if they want to be an object of obsession i'll obsess the shit outta them
---
perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
It would cool but I don't see that happening. It would require changes to the basic hook mechanics that are universal to every killer.
---
Imo the original killers are pretty boring and uninspired. Cosmetics are shit too because you're playing first person.
---
I spend a fuck ton of cosmetics on other games but I can see myself. There's legitimately zero point to buying skins if you yourself can't enjoy them.
---
what? i don't think you understand what they said because your reply makes zero sense
---
Yes, thank you.
---
i personally prefer myers with his his standard costume his costume in my opinion looks like garbage
---
Only way to counter object is to tunnel and I mean tunnel them very fast, it gives them way too much info.
---
Everytime he laughs it makes me smile cause its such a good laugh
---
My perkbuild is Ruin, Bbq &amp; chili, enduring, Spirit Fury
---
I almost win every game with this build since i am pretty good with it's power 
---
Ruin (can be replaced with PGTW) : Just helps to slow the game down ( just a little bit). You dont really have to defend the totem but you can if you want (it spawns right next to a survivor almost every time anyway)
---
Bbq&amp;Chili (or discordance) : You can teleport to a survivor working on a gen if you see one wich REALLY helps keeping up map pressure
---
Spirit Fury &amp; Enduring: Amazing combo to end a chase fast for almost every killer so why not use it for demo too? 
---
This perkbuild is also pretty good for other killers so just give it a try, trust me.
---
I've always wanted to see an original ice/winter themed character
---
I like that he can get trapped by his own traps.  Like sure I hate when I step in them when playing him but it’s soooo funny.  Also fun to hook the last person and step into your trap while the Entity takes them.
---
WELL MYERS DOESNT LIKE YOU EITHER!
---
Most of the top tier killers are OCs.  (Other than Myers) so I'd rather them make some OCs for awhile
---
Why didnt she just leave😂😂
---
That was painful to watch.
---
Good idea also. Would be neat concept so both music makers get some love
---
Was hoping for a salty dc.
---
Oh? I usually use them as a way to review my gameplay (see where that survivor I lost went, which gens they were on first and whether they stalled before going there, if there were other survivors hiding nearby while I was chasing, etc).  
---
If you camp the streamers out of the game early you can't get a survivor perspective on that match.
---
I want a real ghost. Spirit is a joke of a "spirit". I like her best during her passive phasing but other than that split second, she's more like an invisible zombie than anything.
---
And her waluigi noises just add to ruining the immersion of being a vengeful spirit.
---
You know, bit of a radical idea, but why not have the Trapper get his traps out of lockers, like the Huntress?  He places a trap down, and once it's triggered or sabotaged by survivors, it disappears.  He goes back to a locker to get, say, 2 traps by default, more with add-ons, and also benefits from Iron Maiden.
---
OK I'll try that, being called a tunneler is far better than 4 messages saying I'm a shit killer.
---
Tunnel the obsession
---
Now this. Does put a smile on my already smiling face
---
The frequency varies
---
Cause she's a dick
---
Tunnel them hard. They will come for the rescue since it's usually an altruistic SWF.
---
I just leave every game where I see Object. Couldn't care less about ranks and every game I played against OoO was a toxic SWF that made the game 0 fun.
---
I mean if you heard the terror radius music they usually present in the video then it might ruin the mystery of “Who is the Killer?”
---
Depends
---
Only time I ever bring a mori is against a toxic SWF I requeue against, or against a key.
---
I try to be fair, too. Don't touch the key, I won't mori you until death hook (for the extra BP) or at all and will probably end up giving hatch. But fucking hell there's nothing more infuriating than when you're about to down someone, round a corner with a lunge and they're flying down the hatch.
---
So if im the only one that says 1+1=2 and everyone else says 1+1=3 then that means they are right? Stop with this sheep mentality.
---
No, Bill
---
how to be an idiot 101 THE ULTIMATE GUIDE
---
It needs the ability to climb over/up walls, let it only pounce from a wall/object mounted position. This will keep it from being too similar to the demogorgon. 
---
When it's in chase, give it a tail lash.
---
And when a survivor stuns it with a pallet, there should be a small change to injure the survivor with blood acid spray.
---
He is a very luck based killer unfortunately. You either get no-one caught in traps all game or you get more traps than m1 hits
---
just work through it it makes you better at the game
---
Oh okay
---
I mean, like, I want 2K words worth of this. Your writing is good, and you really captured that in-game dread and I would love to read more
---
Iri button punching the air rn
---
Why are you booing me? I am right
---
yup not as toxic as dbdl like i don’t get any msgs but the amount of campers is bad
---
Question because I'm not really getting it. How does Object of Obsession counter the trapper?
---
The only thing I can think of is it lets you see where he's placing the traps?
---
I can definatly still here it when i play as him and against him. But its quiter now than it was on realease. And thats good, because it sounded like a fucking jet turbine there was nothing stealthy about it
---
Facecamping killers are every bit as craven and cowardly as DCing survivors, you can't change my mind.
---
I don't think it should be walls. Let him insta destroy pallets, and have a limited number of pallets he can destroy even before they're thrown.
---
Bubba is Leatherface.
---
Is it just me or did you edit a spooky face on the top left corner?
---
That’s sounds way more balanced than breaking walls, but not nearly as scary.
---
Legion has one
---
Legion, clown, trapper, bubba
---
&gt; Anyway, BHVR have confirmed during their last livestream that Spirit was statistically overperforming, she is officially OP by the numbers, in addition to being absolutely unfun to play against. Rework is coming. Good.
---
Based on what? The fact that people quit and you only have spirits hunting 1-3 survivors per match? That’s not overperforming. That’s survivors not wanting a challenge.
---
&gt; No, you don't only balance the game around the best, not if it ruins the game for everybody else. 
---
Yes you do. Competitive games require balance around what the top killers can do and what top survivors can do. And right now, almost nothing beats the sweatiest RRSWF.
---
And I realize the nerf is coming, whether I like it or not. But this needs to be said: there is a reason only 2 to maybe 3 killers are played in red ranks. Spirit was out for a while, and no one really complained until Nurse got nerfed.
---
Who’s getting nerfed after spirit? Billy? Ghostface? How come nothing is being done about DC’s and SWF?
---
just to update you i decided to report him
---
How do you know so much lore? Am I missing something? (Im somewhat new) is there a way to find lore outside of the archives collection??
---
I’m not sure about spirit fury enduring combo, demo can just shred through pallets with his ability which is what I usually do if I get that chance
---
Nope you have no clue
---
well all this talk about keys n I’m like ehhhh balance moris at the same time and I’m down but only if they balance both at the exact same time
---
After being sabotaged I think it’s the same as hooks.  3 minutes?  It is affected by the hangman’s trick perk to make them usable again in 10 seconds or whatever.  But since almost no one really sabos much it’s kinda a wasted perk slot.  Unless you want to try to kill every survivor on the same non basement hook.  I’ve done it and it was funny but not really a good strategy
---
Leatherface, Clown, Doctor, Legion, Pig, Plague, Trapper and Wraith
---
I love killers who do that. I usually do that if it happens, with a little toxic. I down them, bring them to the hatch, close the hatch, let them open the gate, down them then let them go
---
Did you have a stroke while typing this?
---
He is fast too fast
---
Tunneling as well. There's nothing worse for me than when another survivor unhooks me in front of the killer, and the killer then proceeds to chase me instead of the other guy. Happens far too often.
---
Imagine that :o no it uses the first one selected I believe
---
That’s a big oof, thanks for letting me know
---
Isn’t the Demogorgon straight up just the Xenomorph? Think about it:
---
It’s a 9-foot quadpedal/bipedal humanoid monster with its most distinctive feature being its head/mouth. It is near invincible and cannot be killed by normal means. Despite having no eyes, it can still perfectly see it’s prey by unknown means. It is highly carnivorous. It’s defeated by a girl. It reproduces by attaching some kind of weird creature to a victim’s face to impregnate the victim. Victims are stuck to walls for safe keeping or devoured. Offspring start off like slugs bug soon grow limbs and become quadpedal.
---
I can’t just be imagining things here.
---
I mean for them to readd now for the flashlight stun ... I know back then the game was terribly balanced towards survivors and that updated made it even worse but now it should work.
---
That's why I like it
---
*Sad Bubba noises*
---
How in Sam Hell would Chucky lift a body up onto a hook, though? 
---

They haven't gotten that far in the thinking process after three years, they got as far as giving Meg cornrows.

Um what?
---
Everyone dc's because of thier own mistakes or of hopelessness.
---
Right ? I mean a killer main was arguing with me about how keys are more op then noed, cause he lost a match where he got 1k instead of "probably" 4k. For me you can't compare those two because survivor have conditions to use a key with a hatch, but noed, well, you just need one dull up.
---
The survivor perk **Stakeout** would be extremely broken and I’m sure other survivor/killer perks could combo... maybe not make it map wide but just make it slightly bigger and it could be balanced.
---
Funny video, but this isn't pain. Pain is playing against an optimal 4-man SWF with Leatherface that instantly pops your Ruin.
---
"Take this two foot long screwdriver"
---
I need this.
---
And the ratio
---
Is "Who is the killer?" A real question? Every time I load into a game, the loading screen drops a tip for the killer I'm about to play against. Like every time.
---
I killed them all...slaughtered them like animals...
---
Dice are the og rng.
---
Allow me to clarify, if this was a perk, it would be fucking busted.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ds125w/just_got_the_legion_any_tips/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Idea 1 is like a better version of fire up so it wouldn’t make sense to have practically the same perk, idea 2 is too complicated for devs it gave me an aneurism reading it, idea 3 would probably be prolong the game and just have survivors holding m1 all game because there’s no counter besides doing the objective so I believe the gens would go faster because with thanatophobia now, they have to heal and then do gens to counter so they waste time healing especially with sloppy butcher and then go do a gen but paired with nurses and ghost face they’re fucked and it’s an endless cycle of hitting each survivor and them healing so PERSONALLY I think thanatophobia is in a great spot if used right.
---
wtf how did you know I was playing with my Willy
---
Which is why this perk totally sucks. Team won't have any idea you have it. Even when you mention it in chat that you want to be left on hook to use the perk it gets ignored nearly every time. Legitimately this perk would skyrocket in viability if they made it clear a person on the hook could freely unhook themselves. Rest of the team could ignore you and get things done.
---
At high ranks, obviously you get rookies, but at lower ranks is where you'll find the most tryhards. People who facecamp you for having a flashlight, or blinding them etc..
---
There's a sweet spot, right around the 9-12 range where people play the game properly, and as long as BHVR keeps their broken ranking system that allows you to de-rank, and punishes easy wins, I'm going to stay there.
---
I'm pretty sure variables that can cause so basic biases, like number of DCs are already taken into account by the analysis. It's like, 101 statistics. 
---
No offense but when BHVR, the company with all the data, says that Spirit is overperforming, I'm trusting that more than my fellow redditor two-minutes analysis.
---
As for balancing around the best, I often see this argument and it's a big no. DBD is not your run of the mill competitive game, it's a completely asymetrical pvp experience, it can't be balanced like Overwatch or LoL. So of course they will need to make sure the best players can't do broken shit with the tools they give them, but no, making the game almost unplayable for 90% of survivors to counter the "RRSWF" is not a given. The current killrate is around 50% overall (so 2 kills/game), closer to 60% around rank 20 and to 40% around rank 1, which is pretty balanced.
---
I play both sides at purple and red ranks consistently, and yeah, the RRSWF is an outlier, way more than 2 killers are viable in most games. Of course it's far from perfect, weaker killers clearly need to be buffed... but Spirit also need to be nerfed.
---
If no one gives a fuck why get salty. And what I’m saying is why do they give a fuck?
---
Im pretty sure I've read somewhere on here that these have leaked already. I booted up dbd after completing level 1 and it showed me level 4, figured I'd get and upload the challenges as they are now.
---
Omg yes lol so annoying
---
We got a good player who is humble in victory and gracious in defeat. I have never seen Otz say "man they sucked" when he beats survivors he always says gg and that they played well evem if they didnt
---
Skins and game deigns are different teams at bhvr you do realize this?
---
Consider blindness add-ons or 3rd seal (weaker) you see the object at the beginning of the game and you can blind him (easier with snares) he'll be outta terror radius cause of Freddy's dream state and you'll see him while he's looping and mindgaming and he won't see you, still tunnel though or else every pallet you drop (snares are better anyways) they know every mind game you do behind tall walls the looper knows, every teleport/fake teleport you do they'll know the angle and approach.

Honestly, if it was easier no one would be playing killer on higher ranks, simply because survivors would become even more cocky than some swf already are

Trapper has to go all the way to the trap, pick it up, and walk back.

There is a simple way t work around that, keep the original themes for Trapper. They could be "his" themes.

* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...). These posts must be submitted as a fan-made concept, including at least two of the following things: character background story, teachable perks, killer power/ability, new unique gameplay mechanic (similar to Jigsaw Boxes, Bear Traps, ...), map concept art/layout/aesthetics.
---
Killers are so unique. Why aren’t we talking about the fact that survivors are all skins lmao
---
I just want Jack the Ripper, ‘sal I’m sayin’
---
Nope, no way. And that's a good thing for the killer. Might trigger exposed.
---
Used it with stake out and just hit them regularly
---
Oh man did I get a group good last night. 3 survivors had just finished a gen and were heading my way as I stood behind a big boulder. I lunged and stabbed one guy and everyone dipped in a different direction.
---
Apparently the devs said Chili _does_ work, it just... barely does. Like, it's a 3% increase to acceleration or something. 
---
It's very bad.
---
It didn't count for me yet. I had three 3K with one dc after accepting the challenge. Unless it did and I didn't go into select the award lol thinking it wouldn't of counted.
---
Hate when survivors Teabag in exit gates. Ive always wanted to be able to lunge and grab them out of exit like you could hatch
---
Try playing against 4 No Mither with Resilience powering through generators and tell me how that goes. They do gens faster and you can't slug which means you have to waste time hooking them. 
---
or 4 No Mither saboing hooks.
---
You know what? I'm big dumb-dumb 2000, and you're absolutely right. Someone with OoO would still be picked up by the Wraith, just not the other way around. For some reason I had the notion that the perk would be more or less deactivated while the killer is Undetectable.  
---
That said, however, with the recent buff to all stealth killers, it's not as likely that people will be running it.
---
It isn't just bloodpoints that they lose. It's heavy pip weight on "hunting" I believe. But they get 55 points for hitting a survivor, and -3 to -7.5 for each 10 seconds they're near a hooked survivor, based on distance. Which is practically nothing. It takes 120 seconds to die from first hook. So in theory they can lose more points overall, but that timer stops if there's another unhooked survivor nearby.
---
Yeah the only cool one was the nurse and wraith. A guy with a chainsaw, a guy with bear traps, a clown, and a japanese girl ghost. Pretty bland.
---
Same exact thing here. LOL!
---
I mean pc users can use a controller shouldn’t console players have the same thing they can do?
---
I don’t get those tips anymore. I usually got them when I got the game. I think the game gives these tips to new players to give them a sense of counterplay I guess
---
The demogorgon is a creature that in the show is following the the orders of a more powerful being. It's easy to assume that it's the case with demo and the entity
---
Honestly, I absolutely adore trapper. I love setting up traps and playing the patient game with him, but he needs work. He is the poster boy of the game, the developers need to stop neglecting him and give him a second look. He gets stomped on towards the purple and red ranks. I’d love to use him more but his kit is too punishing for the current meta.
---
oh man the babadook sneaking up directly behind you and doing the sound would be terrifying haha
---
Those damn Jakes...
---
With Freddy all you have to do is look on the bottom left corner of the screen. With Plague all you have to do is look at all the fountains across the map. With Pig all you have to do is look at all the jigsaw boxes around the map. It doesn’t really matter all that much if he has special hooks.
---
If it glows, it goes
---
It’s Slippery meat lol
---
Him*
---
Yea as far as if they could even manage to implement it properly I'm pretty pessimistic as well. They definitely need to do an operation health so the game can just run in general. But I can hope!
---
BHVR: **Ah great! You found a easter egg!**
---
Mesh it with no Mither so the user is 1 shot the entire game. 
---
You want ur wall hacks? Prove you deserve them. 
---
Also object should not work when on the hook or in dying state.
---
Well, in performance wise yes, but if you get iridescent unbreakable you won’t be able to get 8K in survival, in this game I got all iridescent but the unbreakable one, bc I used DS right in the gate to escape
---
No, you're not answering my question. Would the perk itself just make the terror radius map wide the entire game in your mind? Because that certainly is not how it would work
---
Deliverance is absolute total TRASH.
---
First, you need to unhook someone BEFORE you yourself are hooked, which is totally unlikely unless you actively TRY for it...meaning you aren't doing gens or anything constructive just camping for that first unhook.
---
Second, it's ONLY useful on your first phase.
---
Third, you're broken for a full minute even at perk T3, meaning, again, most people go hide or locker hump for another minute of wasted time.
---
Furthermore, this perk has been broken since day 1 and does NOTHING if you go the entire match without getting hooked, and the ONLY time it could actually do what it's meant for (unhooking yourself for a quick broken run to the exit hate or hatch) doesn't even WORK because you're forced through every phase immediately. 
---
Pretty good slob so far.
---
Obsession escape+ killer grasp escape with DS+ struggle+healing
---
Damn. That was nice ngl
---
I wouldn’t call it a “nerf” to Nurse XD

---
You’re not the only one my man, but yeah, due to the lawsuit, I don’t see it happening any time soon. I personally think that if the devs of Friday the 13th were able to lend out the rights to BHVR and have Jason as a killer, they’d do it. It’d be more recognition, why not? But like I said, I don’t see it happening any time soon if at all.  😩
---
Dang. did women hurt you or something? lol
---
He has the weirdest boner....

Yeah i know but i would have to see it in practice to be able to think of any good changes for the perk

Normal Tuesday night for Evan MacMillan.
---
Killers lose Points when they stay near a Hook after 10sec ... camping a survivor is not a strat you do to win a game \^\^ its just toxic
---
Survivors seeing him set traps will just spring them the second he steps out of sight, SWF can say where his traps are, he has to pick up a trap to re-set it, pulling a survivor out of a trap leaves it unset, his abilities are quite map dependent, and a tar bottle can either fuck hon further or help him a lot, again depending on the RNG of map choice...
---
Bad bot
---
As a survivor main, they were a disgrace. This video cracked me up though 😂
---
Just because it was an easy game, you have the right to be toxic to other players. What you got is a perfect sample of punishment for assholes
---
Or maybe we want N E W  O R I G I N A L  C O N T E N T

I’ve never understood camping in any type of game. Is is a legitimate strategy? Like, honestly, what do these people think?

Now that is terrifying

All totems are highlighted, if one suddenly isn't it means survivors are over there cause they just broke a dull

This killer sucks to play against so he should stay where he’s at. A non swf can easily be destroyed by a good trapper and swf will always be able to destroy him even with buffs. Lower ranks especially a buffed trapper will dominate survivors who have no experience with each map and loops.
---
Dying alone, easily forgotten.
---
I smell a legion from the trailer.

TBH, imagine if they could do that, where legion could take on the disguise of a survivor and lose their terror radius and attack until they put the mask back on.

I don't think they want you to know to balance out why survivors don't get a totems cleansed counter. How I always seen it.

They dont need a lore reason for jason to put people on hooks. Jason was shown to listen to orders in his head in freddy vs jason

The two are not mutually exclusive. It can still be a bad idea, even with descriptions.
---
There's very clearly more people here who main survivor than killer, which is fine. No idea why everyone is so sensitive about it

I think it’s really cool to have a game with almost all the killer icons.

you're so lucky, i get atleast 2 messages every round

Wait, are any OG killers that come out free?

Especially when he decides to screw with you and slowly walk towards you once he's close enough.

That's just how the Auris works.  It constantly doses the Observer with just the right mixture of caffeine and cocaine to jitter him into a pocket dimension—out of sight, out of mind.

"bad idea" and busted are two different things and it's pointless to even talk about it unless you have a conception of how the perk would work, which you didn't because you don't care
---
Hahaha jokes on you. 
---
*I did all the dulls*
---
They're saying to have them highlighted so that the killer can choose their totems at the start. I have no fucking clue why you think that means they are highlighted the entire match

Pig is my main, I literally do worse with spirit and billy than I do pig because that’s how much I play her. She’s so fun to use, I love her
---
&gt;I swear to god I have to look behind myself just incase some chuckle head is following me and breaking my damn traps.
---
fucking this. trapper basically has no power if you go against a swf where one of them takes it upon themselves to disarm all your traps while the others do gens.
---
Nice plunder the hole build! Ace=best
---
Hasn‘t to be Deliverance, maybe just luck and seconds wind
---
It will probably never happen. It I want Jason.

That's one of the things that bothers me most about DbD.  If they all quit I get a depip.  I have posted here before suggesting some sort of safety pip for the killers when all the survivors quit because that has happened to me a bunch recently and feels terrible.
---
SR-71 is faster

How would Pinhead attack people, though?  He doesn't actually get his hands very dirty in his lore. He lets the forces of hell work for him.

I'm not talking about the cosmetics themselves offering advantages to competitive play. I am talking about the way you "earn" cosmetics. In which you pay to skip the grind.

Yeah exactly... that lurking madman...

Yea I mean how would you react, I had a time challenge to unhook
---
Especially on ps4
---
Beehive traps that allow him to portal through or nearby when triggered.
---
All jokes aside. Why don't people watch their surroundings?
---
Can I ask why? Like, I get the meme and that you can pair it with resilience but why play handicapped
---
What did he say
---
Killer and Survivor interactions are my favorite parts of this game. Sure it can get competitive, but the emphasis on that is too heavy. I like playing killers that can look like they're having fun just playing the game like Pig and Ghost Face. Most consider it taunting but it's just about having fun. I'm willing to depip to joke around with survivors for a match, really lightens the tension.
---
High risk, high reward. I like it. ...Wait, wouldn't that make Oblivious a POSITIVE effect for them? Since they're not hearing the terror radius, ergo, aren't in it, they can't be exposed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good idea, but it doesn't do anything for Freddy. I say Freddy because Myers becomes undetectable, which also removes auras.
---
Infectious Fright, too. Put that on a Myers in Tier 3, along with Iron Maiden.
---
I did this the other night as killer and someone messaged me and told me if I didn’t kill them she would report me, lmao.
---
Fair. Just make it permanent exposed then
---
You forgot "Big Brain Trap Placements"
---
Whomst the fuck!? I've never heard her called that before.
---
Hasn't that changed now with him being "undetectable"? I thought the purpose of giving killers that effect was that aura reading doesn't work on them?
---
It's for equal rights for men an women lol
---
Your wrong I litterally  made this from a gif and my cellphone filming the tv
---
Looks like the players who are playing as the survivers keep Disconnecting right before being murdered, causing the game to end without any kills it looks like.
---
I mean, there's nurse, wraith, demogorgon, and hag. Not all of them are affected as badly, but...
---
I always though a Dr. Jekyll,  Mr. Hyde would be cool
---
Well first I used it so I can learn to play without having self care, then I started using it with this is not happening, resilience, and balanced landing, with resilience and this is not happening I finish generators really quick  and it basically counters ruin really well and I can usually last a while in chases even with the broken status. idk why I use it but I’ve grown to like it

Man I've been waiting forever to get the two killer glitch that would be so fun

Because he literally said that the parks are not active until they are chosen,if there was a limit there wouldn't be this line dipshit. Not to mention highlighting through walls to choose sucks cause you can't tell what's covering it until you get there
---
An otherwise beacon of light on this sub that can get flooded with toxicity and vitriol, thank you for sharing!
---
As soon as the killer is done giving the survivor that extra lift to the shoulder, right as they can move again
---
Seriously I shouldn’t be able to go take a 20 minute dump and come back to the same loading screen.
---
The last part about it "not working if you're never hooked" is a problem that "activates when (un)hooked" perks (Kindred, Second Wind, Breakdown) will always have. I think it's an inherent trade-off you take when bringing the perk though. Self Care will never be used if the Killer never hits you, but chances are you'll be hit at some point.
---
I do agree with your other points though. Particularly that you don't get to try to unhook if you're the last Survivor. I understand that most of the time unhooking yourself as the last Survivor would just mean that the Killer would down you on the spot, but the option would at least be nice.
---
I think that the trapper should only be able to trigger their own traps if they're carrying a survivor. Since the trapper walking into his own traps is technically a stun, the survivor is dropped into the injured state.
---
I wanna see new original killers, all these licensed killers are getting tiring. I wanna see cool new designs and powers.
---
Two of you went for the hook right away, do a gen or something.
---
Probably the same reason they replaced his setting animation when the trap preview would be misaligned - spaghetti code.
---
If there is 2 survivors left you should at least farm hooks and hits
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
&gt;Thought the skins would be coming out with the Rift but they didn't, someone on the discord said the 6th but idk does anyone know for sure
---
Skins don't have release date. They will arrive when they arrive. You can check leaked dates and expect them to come at that date but don't be disappointed if they don't.
---
How does that one raise serious questions? That should be extremely easy.
---
Okay, sure, still not the definition of pay to win. You gotta use correct terminology, or else someday in a situation more important that video games, you might imply something much worse than just "BHVR implemented payed gameplay advantages"
---
&gt; Because he literally said that the parks are not active until they are chosen,if there was a limit there wouldn't be this line dipshit.
---
ooh temper!
---
So you think that killers would just not set their Hex perks so that they could track survivors who break totems? Because that's what this would mean lmfao
---
it is but a very toxic and no skill tactic
---
I waited til ghosty was gone
---
I'd settle for it not being so random based on maps. It feels terrible when you use a darkening add-on and you end up on a map with white floors.
---
No he got the oblivious buff for when survivors are asleep
---
Because you then have to learn 10 or more different musical cues for the same distance instead of the current 3, on top of the terror radius adjusting perks. Special flare is ok sometimes, but it does make it harder to read terror radius. Michael isn't much of a problem because he's either tier 3 or monitor and abuse, and demo is so loud with footsteps.
---
I'm I the only one who feels that a swf on comms with a OoO on is just overkill? It feels so cheap. Like your swf squad literally is playing on easy mode. I played games with a member running it and telling Intel of where the killer is. Yeah we escape 9 out 10 games but it's boring. Idk. Please don't @ me with derp derp the OoO gets tunneled.  That's the point. Kind of like choosing to cleans or not against Plague . You kind of have to chase them to even have a hope to stop gens.  I guess find it kills any suspense when I play swf and OoO is being used . I leave after a game or two if a guy has to run it. Hits me right in my sportsmanship.
---
Carrying more than 1 trap by default would be a huge change. You can't play him without a bag addon and still be effective.
---
Yeah I never used self care. I have a David build of BL, DH, Resilience, and Spine Chill. I’ve tried NM but just didn’t like always getting 1 hit downed. I’ve learned to loop pretty good and use BL then into DH it get out of chases easily but I think Spine Chill is my crutch. Too many Ghosty bois
---
I play in both sides, but I take my part for this satire:
---
- Rule #10: In any circumstance should the Killer never EVER dodge or leave a lobby, because it’s considered as Disconnecting and should be punished. No exception.
---
- Rule #???: All Leatherface killers are campers. No exception.
---
That could be a client-server issue with the new dedicated servers - from what I've heard they're a bit messed up.
---
Good luck in the fog!
---
*"Oh? You're approaching me?"*
---
So you expect killers to persist in futile chases where the survivor is luring them from the objective?  Considering the survivors were either on their second or final hook as shown in the basement, I made an effort in chasing them (you can even see it in the bleed-out meter being either more than quarter or half-empty).  Also, you likely don't know this, but against killers such as Hag, Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Plague, or maybe Myers, chases can end very quickly, so while you assume I didn't chase anyone, it's likely because I didn't have so as I ended them quickly.  
---
You told me to let them win, and secondly, as killer no matter how much progress there is on a generator, you kick it. You don't just ignore it. Considering you're only going by the instances where you watched the video, your argument is invalid. Answer this; if you're so adamant on me, the killer, not doing my objective, why not question the survivors not doing gens? They're saving each other, but they didn't think smart enough to have 2-3 people on the remaining gens separately, then turning the pressure back on me and potentially winning. Instead, they prioritized healing over escaping.
---
Nothing like a good bit of backstabbing between friends.
---
Spicy take of the day I prefer original killers
---
If they nerf the viable killers they have to nerf the survivors too. I’d personally say generator repair time increase. Idk though
---
If you have two teammates DC on you, you can bet I will be this Huntress.  ♡♡♡
---
I'm not sure actually, didn't think about that. I think I'mma check it in a custom game.

---
Out of all the killers nothing, to me, beats the satisfaction of multiple traps being walked in to at once; especially if you have the add-on where they go in to the dying state when they escape. It feels glorious.
---
I just don't see the appeal in slugging and stuff for 24 minutes instead of moving onto another game all so you can feel like you won
---
Yes you can get into the game, but you can't get into games because lobbies are so long
---
Also have to concider how insta downs work with it
---
Killer: Dr. Zomboss  
---
Survivor: Crazy Dave  
---
Map:  Your Front Lawn

Slippery and Triple jump would need nerfs. Slippery should apply the bonus speed for 40/50/60 seconds after being hit but remove the bonus burst of speed you get from taking a hit. And triple jump should only gain tokens in a chase. A 50% vault speed increase is pretty huge especially if you you cant make a vault straight through a window and need to come from the side.
---
They are coming tomorrow.

None of their powers are directly affected by luck or sabotage.
---
Luck directly affects 2 things: chance to escape hooks and chance to escape Trapper's traps.
---
Sabotage directly affects 2 things: breaking hooks and breaking Trapper's traps.

If it can cleans it must be dead

*no gens are done, and the killer is confused as to why he can't use his pop goes the weasel...
---
Yeah sorry i meant Dweard. I only ever play as Dweard since i got the code from a streamer giveaway so in my head dwight always looks like Dweard :p
---
Yeah I love the voice but he appears to be incapable of meaningful inflection.
---
It's basically like trying to have a fair bicycle race when your opponent is driving a dirtbike.
---
I kind of do that. I don't even care if I lose. I want that person to remember that it's always a risk. Besides I usually do get them out of the game fast. So does not bother me. Accept when I'm in a swf squad running it. So boring after a few games. Killer is on them. Just do gens. Not my preferred way to play.
---
David did same thing to me yesterday - hoped in a locker right in front of me and immediately DC after I opened it.
---
Nice one Max! Lol
---
Yeah and they definitely don’t like a killer whos power is looking at you during a chase and then one shotting with t3 lunge.
---
Bloodwarden rarely works for me but when it does..mm
---
I used to play on PC. My first survivor game I crashed as the killer hit me. It was either bubba or Billy, becaue I heard a chainsaw. I might try to play killer later today though, see if that works.
---
&gt;You told me to let them win, and secondly, as killer no matter how much progress there is on a generator, you kick it.
---
lol 
---
I take it you aren't very experienced.
---
Idea 1 is probs the best, even if the numbers are too high. a 32% cool down on everything you do while stacking with other perks is just madness lul.
---
Idea 2 would just bring back the slugging meta, which no one wants.
---
Idea 3 isnt bad tho, it would help combat gen rushing and buy the killer some time in the early stages of the game (which is when the killer needs the most help imo). I would worry tho that stacked with ruin or PGTW it could make the early game too long. Balancing that one would be hard because put the values too high and the survs dont have much of a chance if they arent a well coordinated team, but too low and the perk is useless like it is right now.
---
The dude has a minute on the hook, I recognize a farm build when I see one.
---
Very cool Kanye!
---
don't own cheez it, nice try though
---
I used to play Nurse quite a lot, and I have to say she feels way clunkier now. Not being able to use your power for information/traversal without really suffering feels pretty bad. Also, against decent survs on maps with LOS breaks it's incredibly punishing to miss with the way the cooldown works.
---
To be fair, cosmetics are pretty much only made by graphic designers, not programmers. Bhvr putting more or fewer skins out wouldnt affect the base gameplay at all.
---
The point I was making is that. The ability for a killer to differentiate hex totems should have been available when hex totems were first introduced.
---
Also can we make the aura a different colour? I find it almost impossible to find any traps on some maps.
---
execute order 69
---
I just read that in that squeeky hello voice... well done
---
You... cannot possibly have as much time in this game as you claim to.
---
How are any of these perks toxic?
---
It’s the second best Dwight head so I can’t fault you
---
Thank :)
---
Whenever someone has OoO against a trapper they'll usually just stealth behind him and kill any traps they put down immediately or they'll be around the map doing it things watching you put traps down to go disarm them when they're done with whatever they're doing
---
I was thinking more the voice from family guy but that works too lol.
---
Assuming a worthless perk, yes it could happen
---
Wake Up, Up the Ante, Overwhelming Presence and Hangman's Trick
---
It was a joke. People that run these perks typically do it to fuck around/not take the game seriously.
---
Potential sniper
---
I personally would love it if the alchemist became a killer
---
After I completed level 1 and opened the archives for some reason level 4 showed up for me. Idk if someone else already posted it, but I have a few images of the challenges here:  [https://imgur.com/a/6Hru9pU](https://imgur.com/a/6Hru9pU) 
---
Sorry for my english, I'm from Brazil :)
---
That’s a great addon combo, but it doesn’t need to be base. It’s more for a fun stealthy build. I would say that the yellow or green Windstorm addon should be in his base kit instead.
---
Why do you think Tru3 wants to powercreep killers? Besides the fact that he thinks Spirit shouldn't be touched, I tend to agree with him.
---
I run basement trapper for fun a good bit. I can't remember the last time I didn't have a DC happen. The challenge itself is not what makes it impossible. The ragequitting community does.
---
Why was the killer missing so much
---
Ah okay. More reasonable. Still don’t see what the issue with that is lmao are you really that scaredy-waredy of the big bad killer knowing where you are?
---
Changing the meta that much would require a massive rework of just about every mechanic in the game. I agree with you, but this won’t be happening any time soon.
---
Yeah but you made a connection which wasn’t even there you just pulled the first thing that came to mind instead of saying “would be better if they made them different colours” plus I think it’s better to not know which hex is which cause then you won’t rely on them too heavily
---
Ancestor from DD for entity 2020
---
Any game without some combination of ruin/noed/toth is a good game.  Small game has become a mandatory perk for me lately.
---
You get blood points and it's the easiest way to get rift currency. In the rift, you can get the petrid serums to unlock them hallowed blight skins. Plus, a fun challenge.
---
No, they all cost money. So I’m confused by his comment.
---
I have no idea. I am struggling at rank 12 with him to get decent momentum going in a game way worse than I do with any other killer right now that I have leveled up. He is a challenge to play outside of potato ranks. I assume a lot of the complaints are from higher rank survivors who struggle because they don’t pay any attention to what is happening around them.
---
Claudette was afk, was going to give her hatch but she left too. Idk why they DCed since I'm playing Legion, no ruin, and am pretty bad at killer. Just wanted the rift challenges done feelsbadman
---
What're ya gonna do with those pies, boys?
---
Yes, it happens to me sometimes. I also play on full screen. Tell me if you find the fix
---
I get that I just really dont see the point of wasting your own time instead of just hooking who you get, I would rather get a new game going where I can earn more points than slug and waste time in a game where my points are already full in half the categories. If it weren't for the end of them throwing themselves at you, you would've wasted all that time not picking people up for no reason cause at least 2 of them should've escaped.
---
Imagine disconnecting against legion lol
---
Plenty of competitive games have dailys and a battle pass. Nearly all of the ones I can think of, in fact.
---
Why should they? And no. A build doesnt need either to be strong.
---
It honestly needs a massive rework. There's no way to make it balanced for solo play without it being OP in SWF, and likewise no way to make it balanced for SWF without making it trash solo.
---
The biggest problem with Object right now (imo) is that it goes completely against what the Obsession mechanic has become. It and Remember Me are currently the only two perks that actually rely on you tunnelling the Obsession, with Dying Light being reworked and Decisive Strike specifically *penalizing* Killers for tunnelling. I'm very happy that the Obsession mechanic has been turned into one of (for lack of a better term) "saving the best for last" as it creates a lot of fun "final girl" moments for the Obsession who has to consider if it's worth playing more risky and potentially dying so their allies don't suffer as much. Tunnelling isn't fun for anyone and this take is far more exciting. But again with that being said Remember Me still encourages tunnelling, and Object is the "tunnel me daddy" perk that comes with practically no downsides for such a huge upside. Hell with the new Obsession mechanics being the Obsession is often a boon for Survivors.
---
Lol as soon as you get past potato ranks you will feel the intense fury of dealing with optimal SWF groups and the siren song of camping and tunneling....
---
Its not unintended if it literally says in a single trial on every single one of them and they are all master challenges because they give 60k bp
---
Toxic survs deserve this ALWAYS
---
All green addons should be base. Or all yellow, excluding bone clapper.
---
The perfect character for this game
---
I usually see this play only when they know they have their decisive strike up so they can’t get slugged
---
Even though you get banned shortly after, it really would be tons of fun
---
Got two survivors in the basement as trapper last night, got accused of camping in end game chat because they stepped in traps I left at the top of the stairs.
---
My thought exactly. I completed my rift challenge in another game but had to play so fair to the point I felt like I was farming, BC they started giving up and I was fed up with DCs.
---
That's completely your  fault. You should have been looking around
---
So do I. Always said he’d be cool in the game
---
I'd agree with the triple Jump changes; I originally wrote it that way. I think those Slippery changes are too harsh - sit has to compete with some really good perks to be usable at all.
---
I mean he makes a decent amount of sound with his stomping and flappy cloak sounds...
---
For the archives, I played it safe and did all the challenges before completing the level, but what happens if you complete the level? Can you still do the other challenges?
---
Because it's not that I'm pissy about getting a second opinion, it's that his second opinion made me out to be the bad guy who's bannable because I didn't play by the survivor handbook while I was inexperienced for not engaging in chases that evidentally lured from the gens, which makes no sense because as the killer, I'm supposed to stop survivors from doing gens by any means necessarily. If slugging, locking down three-gens, and capitalizing on the poor plays of a group of idiot bitches nets me a 4k, so be it.
---
# BOTTOM TEXT

Does the windows 10/Xbox pc app servers connect with steam servers? I just got the Xbox games pass and downloaded the game, but I can’t get into a match for the past 30 minutes. Is windows 10/Xbox app on pc a waste of time/money?
---
I get that you're a killer main but if skill levels are equal it is significantly harder for survs to ruin a killers game compared to a killer ruining a surv game. Heck a surv is much better suited for fucking over another surv with a well timed body block.
---
I'd also argue that Killer perks are much stronger than surv perks so youd have to have 2-4 survs running toxic builds/playing toxic to impact the game as much as if the killer is toxic.
---
But yeah I'll give you that if 4 survs run BL, DS, Ad, HO on haddonfield with purp clicky bois it's probably not going to be much fun for you... unless you're running Franklin's and other counter toxic perks.
---
I want Marcellus Wallace
---
Misread the comment
---

---
Pretty hypocritical to whine about being insulted when you made the "did women hurt you?" comment first. And it's not MY definition, it's THE definition. I dont have any control over what the hell society at large uses to identify something. And by that logic, all the OC killers in shop right now are pay to win because buying them skips the "grind" of collecting shards.

What rank were these guys that they'd all just sprint into the basement like that?
---
I mainly play Bubba. I know he isn't great but he's funny so I play him. Are there any ways to conquer seemingly endless loops? Should I break off or keep on chasing? I have all killers so all perks are options for me in case that helps. 
---
Another question is are there any reliable ways to get adept killer? I've been trying for a long time and have yet to achieve it
---
That you can't hear over other survivors grunting, generator sounds, and that one idiot who keeps blowing skill checks.
---
Thats not bloodwarden
---
The idea is that if you’re selected, they’ll assign you to play either altruistically or unaltruistic
---
All my killers mains: look directly up if you are about to get flashlighted. This will often save you from dropping the survivor.
---
And this is why survivors need to stop doing this at the exit gates.  
---
Just. Leave. The. Fucking. Game.
---
He might of had scratched mirror
---
Because here's the thing...some of us don't want to settle for less and if the survivors wanted to get out, they should've found a method of doing the objective. I did my part in stopping them from doing the objective, but considering all four lived, they could've popped any of those gens and escaped. In addition, they didn't even bother to crouch over the traps; they just gave me more opportunities to hit and ward them off.
---
Probably "A Nurse's Calling" (Nurse Perk). Also "Enduring" (Trapper Perk) together with "Spirit Fury" (Spirit Perk) is a pretty common combo.
---
Hexes were absolutely not meta in 2016-2017.  Deep Cleansing was an absolute bitch of an achievement to get in 2017.  You’d get the occasional ruin but it wasn’t meta.  It was getting more common by the time I stopped playing for a long while back at the start of 2018, but the original totem placements were considered so bad it wasn’t worth running a hex perk most of the time.
---
This doesn’t mean I disagree that it’d be nice to see something else be run here and there, but at the very least hexes haven’t been meta for 3 years.
---
Holy shit you fucking killed him dude
---
Complete disagree. Some of their originals are interesting (Spirit is brilliant visually, Nurse is pretty neat, Plague has a great design), but the licensed killers are why I play this game. Myers is still bar none the most clever concept they've ever made. Seeing how they implement killers I'm already familiar with into this game is the most interesting thing about it.
---
As soon as I upvoted this I got the message that it was trending
---
I’m bad
---
Two of them were Rank 6 and the other two were Rank 9.
---
Isn't enduring a Hillbilly perk?
---
Finding folks is often about not letting them know you're approaching. I usually run Dead Rabbit and Monitor &amp; Abuse to keep a small terror radius, and approach gens by walking kinda sideways so I don't proc Spine Chill.
---
Discordance can sometimes help especially in the early game, since every yellow generator will have at least two people on it. Yet it's also useful in the late game, especially if you've been guarding three nearby generators.
---
If you really, really have trouble, you can consider Whispers. This'll let you know if somebody is nearby, so it's useful in the early game and very late game when someone is going for a door, say, and you need to know which one.
---
No, bubba is.
---
Give the new Detective's Hunch a try.  I used to run small game too, but the new Detective's Hunch is one swell perk.  I've had much better luck clensing all the totems using it because you can see what's left that your teammates didn't get.
---
I'm protanopic colourblind, so I already have a good hunch as to how knackered my eyes are. All of the red auras in the game are near impossible for me to see.
---
[deleted]
---
Is this a kink shame thread?
---
For the runner, things like balanced landing, quick and quiet, etc would be great! Borrowed time for saving off the hook. Not super sure for the gens, maybe just bring in tool boxes?
---
Hope that helps a little! I am pretty novice so there are probably perks I did not think of :)
---
Bruh moment #79
---
if youve ever played other games you know that the best builds will always be similar cus theyre simply the best. you take away exhaustion's/ hexes people will juts start running the next best thing nothing will change. you dont know what your talking about.
---
I did this to a couple of Survivors last week as Huntress! Maybe it was me
---
That is blood warden but it’s not blood warden in the video. The exit blocker appears for the killer when they get close to the exit but the survivors can still leave
---
Lol thanks for confirming your troll status bro.  I'm not stupid enough to fall for your shit just warning these guys you're here to start shit which can clearly be seen by how non starter an issue this thread was yet here you come picking at it lol.  You're so transparent man.  Go fish elsewhere.  If I see you on one of my threads I'm just gonna blow up your spot so they know not to waste their time.  I'm so over indulging trolls lol.
---
I personally don't know how you can have the heart to kill the other survivors as ghostface after Mori'ing one and having the others rush to pose for your selfie.
---
I'll probably catch some hate but low ranks. I'm a trash survivor, I float between ranks 10 and 15 and ghostface is deadly in that bracket. When I play him as killer in red or purple though he definitely doesent feel that oppressive, I have to really sweat for those 4ks.

Examples of how this can be solved.
---
If you ask me, I'm all against any perks at all. I sometimes play vanilla loadouts with my friends in KYF and this is fun. The game itself should be balanced around it's vanilla version (with taking some perks, items and addons into account) but it should never be balanced around perks and addons, forcing players to use them to win.
---
Epic
---
He does a ritual and trades places with the survivor, possessing them until the survivor (now stuck in the Chucky body) has to go find something or do a skill check in order to be able to trade back and be able to do gens again. While traded, Chucky in the survivor body can attack other survivors and hook them. Rituals count as being hooked, and normal hooks while traded count as being hooked.
---
The OG killers are better ,change my mind
---
I think disturbing the house on Big Pantry unlocks the challenge. I played it as survivor, it was the only map I had to play to get the challenge.
---
Their oc is usually supper cool
---
It never really fixed itself., just kept happening. When I got disconnected it would give me the error "You've been disconnected from the host." Never happened when I played killer though... so no idea what was going on
---
Feng's technician perk for missed skill checks, alert is also a good perk for stealthy survivors as is iron will.
---
&gt;  If I see you on one of my threads I'm just gonna blow up your spot so they know not to waste their time.
---
wow the hero Gotham needs
---
okay, my epic gamer friend. keep acting like it's totally reasonable to whine that something is broken without even knowing what it is. that is the big brain shit we crave
---
Maybe because every build on red ranks includes at least on of those perks? This is not good, when out of hundreds of perks in the game, only 10-20 of them are used.

Deliverance has a hidden passive where the killer is 10x more likely to find you first and tunnel you down when you equip this perk.

---
What’s the point.. in forcing ourselves to go against a killer that is no fun to go against...? People play games for fun and if the killer takes away that fun then I simply won’t play it. RIP Spirit but I’m different 🤷‍♂️.
---
I agree that it helps the killer win the fastest, but it doesn't exactly make the game fun for all parties. So from a design perspective, it isn't a great outcome.
---
Hhmm ... how strange of them.
---
You guys obviously haven't seen or heard of TheEntityLeftHand. He's a trapper only content Creator and he 4k's almost every game.
---
&gt; you guys

what do you mean "you guys"
---
&gt; I'm not letting you have easy bait anymore
---
Literally Aquaman. What a godsend
---
Well, yeah, in general, you can't just buff Survivors without giving a counterbalance, like I mentioned. Killers are already on the weak side. ANY Survivor buff would make that worse.
---
But this particular buff would impact people who rotate like you do LESS than tunnellers, which is the theme I'm trying to establish. Alternations that don't affect every playstyle evenly so that they can have balancing or positive reinforcement effects. Actually calibrating them is a whole other issue.
---
Exhaustion perks will always be strong. It wastes time of the killer and time is a killer's most valuable resource.
---
Hexes are basically gambling perks. Very strong when they actually get to work, but useless when the totem spawns in a trash spot. I think they need to be reworked in some way.
---
Should I try to play Legion or just wait for a rework? I love the idea behind the Legion but in purple ranks, survivors are running the Meta and it's hard to learn them.
---
I don't agree with you. Back in 2016-2017 players were much worse than today and they struggled with powering through ruin or finding it on purpose. Also there were much less slowdown perks and thus people had to use ruin, unless they wanted to be genrushed.
---
camping is lame as hell, but i'm kind of tired of all these survivors basically asking the game to be a bully simulator. any time a killer does anything its "toxic behavior ruining the game" but survivors running around infinites and super safe loops,with adrenaline and OoO in 4stacks, spamming flashlights and tbagging is all fine. Just admit you want to bully the killer, never lose a chase, and escape every single game.
---
Cheeto
---
one runs object of obsession to keep tabs on the killer
---
Some kinks should be shamed, change my mind
---
Is the awful strategy dying? Because that's what this would buff.
---
Is the awful strategy tunnelling? Because this would directly nerf tunnelling.
---
Lol gaslighting bro nice.  Also again I'm not doing this with you as previously stated lol.  You can't troll someone that knows you're trolling.  Move on and hopefully you find people that don't know how full of shit your account is.  But again I will ruin your fun anytime I see you randomly so consider a new burner account or something.
---
Doesn't the survivor get the short end of the stick with the slown effect, since they get a blurred screen, and the effect lasts until they leave the cloud? (and for 2 seconds afterwards)
---
Take Play with Your Food, find the Obsession, get your three stacks, then unleash them on the other survivors. If you're lucky then the Obsession will come in to attempt a save, in which case you can refill your stacks for a second attempt at a full wipe. Bamboozle is also an option, although obviously not nearly as reliable as being flat-out faster.
---
As for the killer Adepts, there's really no method that is both reliable and legal.
---
wait... DIO as a new killer?!
---
I know what I am talking about and the situation you described is still good, as meta will change and this will be healthy for the game.
---
I’m gonna go with legion is just annoying. Not over powered, just annoying.
---
Demo is mid to low B, I dont understand why you think he's that good. His power is extremely predictable and his portals end up being very survivor controlled since he cant reset them himself. Freddy is better than Huntress and Hag, he has some of the best meta perk synergy with his power and add ons. Huntress is way too able to get fucked over by not being on a good map than any other killer as well as having inconsistent hitboxes with her Hatchets.
---
Ghostface is a standard M1 killer and thus benefits the most from the same perks as almost every killer in the game like Save The Best For Last, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Ruin. But Discordance and Nurse's Calling are particularly good on him
---
[This](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/killer/) is a good list for everyone. The top 5 or so rarely changes, so perks like Pop or Discordance will always be good. Clown, Hag, Plague and Spirit are killers that have more than 1 great perk for beginners, otherwise each killer usually has one great perk.
---
Personally I would highly advise getting Pop, Discordance, Nurses Calling and Save the best for Last as they are very useful on most killers (if you already have BBQ and Ruin obviously)
---
I had this,  but the killer took me to the hatch and slammed it on me then went afk for me to die to the collapse
---
Make sure you're using T3 Whispers. At the lower tiers, the radius is so large that all you're being told is that at least one survivor is in your quarter of the map. At T3 the radius is small enough to actually navigate by.

If we're getting Nintendo R34 characters as Killers, all bets are off and we should just jump straight to getting vori'd* by Bowsette.
---
*That's not a typo: I know what I wrote.
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure the devs were going for something else when they made the perk it just was one of those things (like many things with the game) that look/sound good on paper but fail to live up to expectations in practice.
---
They were going for more than “hard mode” they were going for a unique and interesting way to play at a disadvantage but also wanted it to be a “risk reward” perk but failed making it so.
---
So for the most part you are right. This perk right now is a “hard mode with no advantage perks” but I do not think it was traditionally meant to be that way
---
Same for exhaustion perks, though. They should have any drawback at least, because currently they give too much for a little price. I'm not saying the need to be killed, but something has to be done with them.
---
Hexes are also a problem, as they are extremely strong on certain killers and against weak players.
---
Wasn't it bricky with his case file video?
---
This is funny because it only shows the top used perks for killers and your argument is no killer in red ranks use NOED. This still hasn't proven your stance
---
It's definitely yet another Catch-22 for Killers, but this idea was never meant to be JUST doing this. Killers are limited in general, which is why the top tier ones are the highest mobility, and they can't be buffed too significantly because of how hard they snowball from one kill. If a system like this were in place, the snowball principle would lift a bit, and it would be more acceptable to give Killers some similarly-uneven improvement, such as fast-travel points around a map.
---
My philosophy here is that buffing is better than nerfing, but to balance a buff you may need a prior buff. The trick is to make each buff affect different situations differently to even up imbalances.
---
when does the blight event end? i checked the official page and it said nov 1st but i played yesterday with it on.

well how would you balance them? :)

I hate her, she's gross and making your character constantly vomit is gross.
---
Damn I want that DeathGarden mask, on PS4 though.
---
I didn't know they counted lol. Would've been so nice if I was doing that one.
---
I try not to DC because I like ranking up even tho it resets, but I will if there’s a hag guarding their hex ruin and hooks. I don’t play that game.
---
I don't like playing against the plague and I don't like playing as the plague. She's a good killer, but she could really use changes to make her more appealing for both sides.
---
tell me why they would buff pig and plague when they are both viable killers in mostly every aspect
---
I'm glad it's not just me. The guy has the right tone, but he's gunning it so hard he sounds like text-to-speech and I had to turn him off.
---
The flashlight has utility outside of that, also you don't permanently disable the cloak or blink of Wraith and Nurse when you burn them, which btw takes a decent charge of flashlight, nor do you permanently break hags traps, she can instantly reset any destroyed trap unlike trapper who has to wait a few minutes.
---
As far as Demogorgon, that's no different then being able to wake up against freddy, take your head trap off against pig, cleanse against plague, reveal ghostface, snap out of it against Doctor, etc. Killers need some kind of way to circumnavigate their powers so survivors don't just die.
---
Luck and Sabotage are baked in mechanics in the game and personally I see them as 2 of the biggest "why does this still exist" things that are remnants of launch dbd that the devs have no idea how to update. They were decent when 1/3rd of the killers were affected by it, but now it's 1/17 and all it does is punish an already struggling killer with it's outdated mechanics
---
Yep - text states "by any means possible". When they DC, they die. Easy, peasy.
---
Remember this when you get to that challenge.
---
Anddd ...PS4 again what a surprise
---
Boil Over is killer on console.
---
Which is still wrong, because it's the speaking that needs to take more time, not the pauses.
---
what specifically do you not like about plague? i happen to really enjoy plagues mechanics, how it makes survivors choose between two options, makes each game different
---
That is literally what I did today
---
Ghostface can be knocked out of his ability by looking at him, which mitigates his ability to ‚stand still‘. Pigs dash has an audio cue and can be dodged at a loop with proper visuals, and the only use-case I can think of for wraith to stand still is either for bodyblocking a window/pallet or maybe standing completely still to be invisible to camp a gen/hook/Exit gate, the former actually requiring you to be moving ahead of the survivor and is more interactive than anything the spirit does, while camping anything while invisible will be detrimental to your game more often than not. 
---
Spirit has no counterplay, unless you’re running either Iron will or spine chill, but someone shouldn’t have to run a perk to counter a single killer. You shouldn’t have to run urban evasion in case you’re facing Hag or small game to counter trapper
---
A lot of killers can deal with red rank swf, assuming the player has skill. Namely Huntress and Freddy beyond the top 3. but almost every killer can be used and used effectively at red ranks, just some will suffer a lot more against swf. I do think a decent amount of killers could use buffs/reworks to make them more viable and fun to play, but that doesn’t mean that nurse and spirit don’t/didn’t need nerfs
---
Ya your just wrong demo is def not better than either of them Mid tier like Michael
---
Also Detective's Hunch will store the information to a map. So if your map can track killer belongings you can see the aura of the totems with the map after the first Detective's Hunch proc.
---
I love that, except for the survivor being impregnated randomly, as that usually had direct intervention from the Xenomorph. That's why I was thinking of something to do with the eggs, but maybe it's something like the xeno could send out a face hugger, and then would have to control it to go and get a survivor, which would make the survivor struggle to take it off, which at that point control would go back to the xeno and he would have to go track that survivor down and hopefully catch them. In a sense it kinda works like the trappers trap.
---
I like your suggestions. 
---
I don't agree much with corrupt though. I'd prefer if it blocked all gens, but only for 60 seconds. Would be really nice, although it is not that balanced.
---
They probably recorded different sounds so that it didn’t sound like Billy’s saw
---
I'll admit, Otz taught me to congratulate a good Dead Hard instead of tilting.
---
But you’re not supposed to receive obvious sensory stimulus that tells you when she’s using her power mid chase. That’s why it’s called a mindgame. You’ve got to get inside the head of your opponent instead of just reacting to easily observed action. It’s why you can’t make a guide for spirit because what you’d be doing is making a guide to mind reading.
---
Spirit counterplay is not as simple as stochastic unpredictability, it’s conditioning an expectation in your opponent and then undermining that. Remove confidence in their decisions and that’s how you can win. You won’t get it every time, as you shouldn’t in a fair game, but perks like lithe, dead hard, and quick and quiet help a lot.
---
I believe the answer is yes. You keep whatever perks you already had but if you want any more you have to unlock them from bill
---
Check out Bubba's gameplay in 2017 and you will notice his saw sounds differently than his saw sounds today. I'm so triggered, I liked the old sound
---
It's not karma, that player was just stupid
---
it was hard to get what  you mean as you didn't specify that you're talking about a console
---
yes, you have to lvl bill up now
---
Pls upvote
---
Do you take everything in its literal sense? When you say you are dying of hunger are you actually on the verge of death? Ive already proved my point that good Killers dont run Noed, an opinion that is shared by respected members of the community, but keeping living in your bubble and have fun getting bullied vs swf
---
I mean Plague is good with certain Builds, Ones that force survivors to cleanse like Dying Light, Thanatophobia, Pop Goes 25% of the Generator progress and Ruin. If you don’t run builds that force them to cleanse what does Plague really have? No map pressure with looping a M1 killer with no power until the endgame where everyone cleanses to be at full health. Pigs dash is good for stealth for also for mindgaming pallets but majority of the time, You’ll rarely use it because people will run away if they see you using this mindgame, The RBT’s are alright I guess, They stall the game out unless the key is in the first box, So its more RNG based on whether the trap buys you enough time or not. Personally, I wish the priority list for reworks/buffs should be:
---
1#Bubba, 2#Legion, 3#Clown, 4#Doc and maybe a little Myers buff.
---
That's all true. I'd even say not to bother having traps scattered around the map, but rather spawn into Trapper's supply over time. What other Killers have to go scavenger hunting before they can use their power? Huntress when she's out of hatchets, I guess?
---
You're

cbX Z Z
---
I hope people realize you’re joking
---
I’m not saying Ruin wasn’t good, I’m saying hex perks in general were not meta.  I wanted 100% achievements on this game, Deep Cleansing was a painful process in 2017.  Regardless of whether or not the actual perk was good, people thought hexes were bad.
---
https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/144512942757290983/ (General gist: early 2017. ruin itself is good but hexes are useless in high ranks)

https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1489992713691076459/ (General gist: late 2017. OP complains about ruin, both survivors and killers respond saying how hex perks aren’t strong.)

---
2017 was the year I played the hell out of this game, I know what I’m talking about here.  I came back a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how common hexes were, not just ruin.  They were starting to gain traction when I stopped, but they’ve gotten popular since.
---
Spirit Fury, Enduring, Monitor &amp; Abuse, STBFL, Discordance, and Pop
---
Personal favorites for specific builds/playstyles are Surveillance, Thrilling Tremors, Infectious Fright, I'm All Ears and Make Your Choice
---
EDIT: On the topic of Discordance, I'd recommend you actually keep it level 1. It's probably the only perk in the game that gets _worse_ as you level it up currently. The aura is highlighted for 8/10/12 seconds across ranks 1-3
---
The thing they _don't_ tell you is that that's only after they _stop_ working on it together, and ever 8/10/12 seconds it will refresh and give you another notification. At lower tiers, you're getting more to-the-second accurate information and more refreshes, so it's actually better to keep it at rank 1 than 3.
---
Thx. 
---
Yeah, I really don't think anyone likes running ruin, but right now the other substitutes are mediocre.
---
It’s a bug
---
I've gone up against ghostface as a new and inexperienced survivor (doubt it means anything) and you need to have the middle of your POV on him.  Have you been doing that? It could also be dedicated server nonsense.
---
Technically the Survivor does get affected by the slow for longer, since the effect lingers for 2 seconds after they exit the cloud and they're also affected by the blurred vision. But the problem still stands that you gain very little distance by throwing bottles at a Survivor mid-chase (outside of trying to deny loops) and are in fact *losing* speed if you miss.
---
But Clown has his own massive list of problems.
---
Have been told this alot, and that i dont win if they DC, cause they are not DC:ing cause 3 is downed and one is dead, but because im noob XD
---
[Wow congrats you know how game development works.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqkpw9/wow_congrats_you_know_how_game_development_works/)
---
Well the power effect on a survivor is either put someone else in the dying status or you get out into the dying status. It's the epitome if a free down. Not to mention that entire time the survivor can't do any objectives
---
Making an OG killer would be easy. They still have Old Freddy's data, some people liked Old Freddy. Slap on a buff or new component, since you're fitting the Nightmare theme I guess he's the Sandman, make a spooky dude with a sand aura.
---
The NEXT OG Killer might be tougher, but they teased Alchemist, right? Sounds like they already have something in mind.
---
In general, I’d say perks that allow you to get information on location (Nurse’s Calling, Discordance, Thrilling Tremors) and gen stopping perks (Pop, Ruin, Corrupt Intervention) are good on GF. He has doesn’t have much map pressure, so being able to slow down gens is a must, and location perks mean you can get your stalk on. 
---
I’ve also started using Play With Your Food on him, and I like it. Actually, running that with Furtive Chase results in absolute chaos and it’s really fun.
---
Even if that was the case, it begs the question of why he was trying to kobe off the hook when there was someone right next to him.
---
Exactly that’s my point it’s nearly impossible for the survivors to win in that situation because they don’t deserve to. They’ve lost the game but they’re handed a free win even tho they’ve played badly because one of them brought a key. That’s what’s so frustrating as a killer is when you’ve sweated your ass off and deserve the win and then you derank because two escaped.
---
They originally throught Hillbilly was the closest we'd get to Bubba, though.
---
&gt; The Culling
---
Man, I miss that game.  Shame the devs just couldn't listen to the people actually playing their product.
---
I cant edit posts or I would change it
---
It sounds dumb but I really cant pinpoint it. I hate being constantly injured and super loud, it takes away from so many aspects of the game that I love. But if I cleanse, it will almost definitely end in 1 or more of my teammate's demise. Again, cant pinpoint exactly what makes her unfun to me I just notice a pattern of my crippling depression increasing with each game I play against her
---
So you 99% tier 3 and popped it point blank range and they called you a hacker because of it?
---
He thinks there's nothing wrong with Plague/Corrupt Purge either.
---
&gt;Mr.Envy AND Jon Rob  
---
FTFY
---
i love plague. fun game mechanics, she’s very different than other killers &amp; she requires some good game sense to counter. she practically forces survivors to think together, which is a good thing in my opinion.
---
not the easiest to counter but not the hardest, reminds me of the huntress with a twist.
---
Wouldnt it just be 1 perk slot?
---
It's okay buddy, I knew you weren't going to get it... But I can try can't I?
---
Didn't even google the thing I said did you? ** shrug ** stay a stupid git your entire live while acting entitled... I'm done!
---
Bruh I didn’t say it was great I said sometimes. It’s more situational than a ton of the stuff in the game.
---
The people who point out the people who are discussing spirit are more obnoxious than the actual Spirit discussion and its getting repetitive. Stop trying to get karma with shit we already know.
---
AO3?
---
Yeah, if i notice someone deliberatly drawing my attention or is a strong looper i just leave and go for a less strong person
---
If they dropped all the cosmetics at once it’s less likely that they will all sell well, if you space them out then people will more likely get the new ones as they come because they don’t feel like they’re spending as much money and they want the new ones more because they’re new, 
---
like if ghostface was released alongside the Myers and Laurie skins about half the people who normally would pay for cosmetics would buy gf and the other would buy Meyers whereas if they release one killer then killer mains have one choice, either be patient (good luck gamer) or just get the Meyers skin because “i like Meyers anyway and I’ll have money for ghostface when he does come” 
---
TLDR: money money money
---
Yes, you are clearly hacking the game. The survivors had every right to complain and you should probably just uninstall your game now..
---
I'd ignore you and go for someone else
---
Thank you to those who upvoted, this was my first ever post on reddit and I’m glad I got some attention for it. Second, to those curious as to why this happens, I don’t know why it happens, all I know is that the game seems to read 5 people are in a lobby but fails to recognize there are multiple killers in the lobby. I don’t know though, I just play the game. Thanks again for the responses, however, people keep talking about a multi killer game mode and I’m not really for this idea because it doesn’t feel like it would work as well as we think it will. If we disregard killer combinations like Myers and nurse (because tier 3 Myers lets the nurse 1 shot people) or how totems would work, or how multiple terror radii would work, auras, multiple of the same killer, getting hit by 2 different killers, and the insane tempo that survivors would get through gens if the maps stayed the same, (whether the gen count increases or not) the killer side will have a clear advantage from this and larger maps will have survivors at an advantage. Will I think it could be fun? Yes, (also because killers on coms makes swf groups equalized) but it has to be done right, and I don’t think BHVR is capable of that.
---
That sounds completely pointless imo.
---
Honestly, everything you just said is definitely accurate. And I love playing against killers which match what you just described... but plague... no :(
---
1. It's not a win by definition, 2K is obviously a draw between the killer and survivors.
---
2. You could call it a win if 3 survivors escape the hatch, but you need to sweat your ass off against a good killer player for that to happen.
---
3. Vice versa, if they managed to do 3 gens, they weren't playing that bad, so I don't think you really deserve 4K handed for you. Especially if you derank in that scenario, which means 3 gens were done quickly and you didn't hooked those two fellas who escaped twice. Otherwise it would be Brutal killer.
---
Hatch appears in borderline to draw or one survivor is left scenarios for killer.
---
At least that's my opinion as 50/50 player.
---
P.S.: But honestly why would you even be disappointed when you are depipping as killer?
---
every 2 weeks, next one is on the 12th
---
No? It's two perks
---
As a character in terms of balance she's fine. There was a saying I've seen of "Damned if you do, damned if you don't" and I do feel it fitting for her, it's actually good to have a character that is dangerous if you do anything. What you do *matters* which is fine.
---
Me personally, she is the character you are heavily advised to loop 100% optimally as you are broken for almost 100% of the trial. I've gotten a better more optimal looper against Plague. Being able to be chased for ages while injured is super fun and more heart-racing if anything.
---
She isn't super engaging in chases like Spirit, Nurse, Billy etc which can lead her to be super boring but for me the chase is enough. The only thing that needs to change is how she gets points in game cause you can 4k every game and barely get Ruthless, Merciless is almost impossible unless the survivors cleanse, which in my opinion is the worst option of Cleanse Vs Not Cleanse.
---
Says the guy (one of many) complaining about skins being released and acting like that's the reason for a character not being rebalanced/buffed. Go look into a mirror once in a while.
---
Ah excellent! Thanks for the heads up.
---
Honestly I don't think it's too bad. The spawn rate of add-ons in my experience is much higher and at higher rarity for killers because it's designed around losing the add-ons. If you kept them you'd be up against red adds like every game.
---
The point is that bill would be the only survivor you don’t have to level for his perks, I’m fine with having to grind if the traffic is a free skin that was pc exclusive
---
What's that?
---
It would also help if it could somehow be activated on the struggle phase as well. That way, getting saved off the hook wouldn't be, as some complete dipshits I've played with have called it, "wasting the perk".
---
I somewhat agree. I've noticed Envy doesn't really take his time on his music, it's good but I think his music could be better if he took more time on them instead of trying to pump them out every day. Jon Rob on the other hand seems like he takes his time to get it right.
---
Aww cute
---
Snance get back to your totems!
---
&gt; Ghostface can be knocked out of his ability by looking at him, which mitigates his ability to ‚stand still‘
---
Not if you are on the other side of a wall. Then you have no idea where he is.
---
&gt; Spirit has no counterplay, unless you’re running either Iron will or spine chill, but someone shouldn’t have to run a perk to counter a single killer. You shouldn’t have to run urban evasion in case you’re facing Hag or small game to counter trapper
---
Spirit has counterplay. I’ve done it, I’ve seen others do it. It’s possible. 
---
&gt; A lot of killers can deal with red rank swf, assuming the player has skill. 
---
Not if the player actually cares about winning. Then they’ll either play Nurse, Spirit or Billy.... aaand that’s it!
---
That would be one of the ways to make Chucky work. I know somewhere in this thread that someone stated that the devs don’t want to make any killers possess survivors.
---
I went to the LeaksByDaylight Twitter and it said the Ghostface skin would be released on November 13th tho
---
Welp. Lol that is indeed your fault 🤣
---
I healed 3 times with inner strength, used DS, escaped as obsession. I don’t remember how exactly I got it but I did haha
---
I do that all the time when I have enough of the bar left. It‘s funny to see if you kobe off or not
---
Yeah I hate the Hag's that put like five traps on one hooked survivor lol
---
I mean, couldn't have liked the old sound that much if it took you 2 years to notice it...
---
I will def remember that Ty!
---
I'm sure he remembers it as well LOL
---
All killers get benefits from slowdown perks - Clown's Pop Goes the Weasel, Plague's Corrupt Intervention. These perks are *far* more reliable than Ruin.
---
Killers that use regular M1 to down survivors get gains from Myers' Save the Best for Last and Plague's Infectious Fright. The former makes them far more lethal when they're being crowded, or if they're chaining a melee hit into *something else*, while the latter allows for fast snowballs on the smaller maps.
---
Debuff killers get strong benefits from perks that either highlight or create survivor groups - Legion's Discordance, for example, and Ghost Face's Thrilling Tremors. Doctor's Monitor &amp; Abuse is also handy because it allows you to get much closer to your targets - meaning a shorter chase as well as a greater chance of snagging multiple survivors at once. Save the Best for Last can also help here too - the faster you recover from a hit, the faster you can use your power again.
---
Fast-moving killers, and killers that use their powers for an instadown, will want to focus on tracking perks, or ones that improve their power. Leatherface, for example, makes unparalleled use of Myers' Play with Your Food.
---
If thinking around your power is too much, there's always the option to just play as a regular M1 killer and take Billy's Enduring and Spirit's Spirit Fury, a strong combo that's basically about disrespecting all pallets.
---
No, people have been calling her that for a while
---
Idk if I'm stupid or not but what's fatigue
---
I think hes talking about when you browse reddit to pass time in queue and realize that you didn't even queue yet
---
Dude, they modified the subtitles cuz otz it's an educaded guy F
---
It's like r/comedyhell but funny
---
We all suffered through the no hit runs with the madlad Otz, it was beautiful
---
***You're already hooked.***
---
they did eventually and released "The culling origins", where they went back to the original release version of the game and started over.
---
Had to remind us during November SMH my head.
---
It‘s a bug, even with a not exhaustion perk it‘s possible to be 150% fast for the rest of the trial (happened to me yesterday lol)
---
IT IS GOING TO BE TOXIC!!!!! That week is going to be full of DCs (hook five survivors in the basement....hook all four survivors in the basement....do everything that makes people DC for each rift web item).
---
If someone calls you a cheater, they are probably less than 14 years old, probably shouldn’t worry about what they have to say about you. Play the game how you want to play it not how everyone expects you to.
---
To be fair those are just suspected, basically the Public Trial Beta has updates that contained the skins that were leaked, alongside a projected release date, however this info wasn’t officially published by BHVR so they aren’t actually beholden to the schedule, they can follow it if they want but they never promised anything actually except that it would drop on a Wednesday. I’m waiting on nov 20th for pig skin but I’m trying not to get too hype, the Meyers skin and Laurie skin dropped on time I believe so maybe you got your answer
---
Go to swamp, go to the big boat in the middle (if you get the right map) as killer or survivor, done
---
Yeah,I've had that. People are just and sometimes at getting the survivor, and I just find a good loop and camera angle and outrun you with no pallets or perks. At that point, I just wait for them to leave and work on a gen near them. If they come back I bring them to same spot and repeat... I had one game the other day, person clearly didn't know what they were doing as Ghostface, and I looped them and they didn't stalk or even stealth or mark. and we never had anyone on the hook. I feel like him him, it's super easy to hook people!
---
DCing is currently excessive.  Fix please. - Player-base
---
you’re a trendsetter!!
---
OhTofu's [Structures guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QYjInzLeM) has a section on the Shack loops, but the whole guide is definitely worth your time.
---
I mean, kind of unrelated but imo NOED isn't OP. It's poor design maybe but a NOED killer isn't going to do very well against competent survivor players because they're playing with 3 perks for most of the match, and when they finally get the perk up all survs need to do is open a gate. It's used a lot more as a "I want at least one kill no matter what" then as an actual perk and no meta builds run it for that reason.
---
How amaizing! The new balance patch is here then XD
---
Maybe their placeholders
---
Swf with OoO shouldnt exist, but the devs would rather nerf less important and less toxic shit first because....its the dbd devs.
---
Freddy is especially weak to OoO due to no terror radius. It takes away all the mindgame out of any loop and has no counterplay, but things without counterplay are perfectly fine according to the community unless its spirit who is the one exception.
---
Otzdarva had some success recently against this kind of build with freddy. Check out his video
---
Been about a half hour lately
---
Don’t @ me but when everyone is playing Spirit because The Archives tells them to, Im probably gonna DC left and right 🤷‍♂️
---
cry more
---
Hex ruin or noed is a staple for basically any killer build. Same with lith/sprint burst/dead hard
---
2 janes did this to me and they were following me around everywhere trying to stun me. Still called me a tunneler
---
Honestly looks like a lag switch, but it is dead by daylight so
---
Now, i used to be one of the people who would shout "DONT CLEANSE" at every situation, but ive learned that its not about not cleansing, you just have to do it at the right places, go off to the corner of the map, or cleanse near a finished gen, it takes plague like half her corruption just to get back to where everyone is
---
Pretty much everyone knows its broken, but survivor mains here downvote people to oblivion for speaking the truth.
---
Probably the same people who thought the original mettle of man was balanced
---
Yep and one of them claimed he was a Mayer’s main and there’s no way to do that without add ons
---
Bloody hell
---
Yeah but at that point nobody still played it, so it's still dead, as far as I know. :(

They aren't placeholders because its already in the game. You downloaded them at the midchapter update. They just need to unlock the content for us to use. They are definitely the challenges.
---
They're a crackhead then and probably don't even have Myers tbh
---
true, its shut down now. but they went ahead and tried. made it free to play and release 1 so that everyone could see what all the fuss was about.
---
I main her. I really enjoy playing as her, and going against her if the person playing her is sorta good.
---
It’s Xbox and there’s potatoes on every platform
---
It is sexual and that’s the point
---
No one in my swf uses one. And while I agree I feel like it should just be more variety in the exhaustion instead of DH/BL. Hex's are fine though.
---
If I win too hard for any reason, I feel bad and let someone go.

Which is probably why I haven't passed Rank 10.

I know what he means. But I’m genuinely asking why does it actually take that long? Cuz it does and everyone says that mostly. Is something wrong with the game?!
---
Loki in Smite, too. He's got an abysmal winrate, is considered pretty widely to be the worst character in the game, and has a playstyle that's entirely unfun for new players to face and meh for experienced players. Yet they refuse to rework him because "duh he's iconic we don't want to change that!"

Says the guy (one of many) complaining about people making jokes about skins being released for a weak character. Go look into a mirror once in a while.
---
I'm pretty sure that one "you have to fuck the killer at least once"
---
If you say healing for 50+ seconds is better than just running adrenaline and doing a gen for that time I suppose you are right
---
I love how much cute Laurie and Michael art I've been seeing, it's this niche I never knew existed.

There's a 0% chance of it happening, although I do hope they make their own individual killer music at some point.
---
It’s been taking me around 20 mins to an hour, longest que I’ve had in the past week was 1h 15m.

Whazzzuuuuuuuuuuupp!!

He doesn't play survivor and he doesn't seem to care about their end. He doesn't want tweaks on killers that aren't OP, but are the farthest thing from fun to play against. Plague, while weak in a chase is just such a pain to play against. Everyone is one hit all the time, or they cleanse and make Plague OP. When Legion sees you, you're dead and there's nothing you can really do about it. Spirit tries to mindgame you, you have to guess what they're doing. He's fine with killers that are hated, not because they're OP, because there is no counterplay to them. I understand why he wants killers stronger - especially in the past, they were very weak. Infinites were truely infinite. But at this point, killers are pretty strong. They definitely need some tweaks here and there, but a new killer can still get an easy 4K against equally ranked players. I don't see him wanting unfair buffs on killers that are strong, so he clearly is fair and wants balance, but I can't agree with some of the buffs he wants, because they make the game less fun for survivors.
---
What are periods if not signs to keep talking?
---
nice!!
---
I did. It was my last game of the night and i was doing my daily of unhooking 2 people as claudette. I was rank 5 and had literally no perks on claudette but yeah i really tried. Otz was playing the doctor and halfway through the match was just memeing around with the last two people who survived
---
It's not as if Spirit isn't every third game already
---
Definitely not the target subject matter there.
---
Yes, Because when you literally have no feedback on where spirit is which is worsened by an addon that removes any form of counterplay (which is guessing which is luck based) Clearly its YOUR fault for dying to that, Clearly your not skilled  because you got totally outplayed by the pro spirit player! How could you lose against an invisible fast moving blueberry that can hear you and see your scratch marks while you have literally no information on where she is! Yes We are just bad even though they are running a bad addon /s

This is the only reason I want Myers. I don't think I'd ever play anything but BK with Monitor and Abuse.
---
Yes, Vommy Mommy. I'm a sinner. Please cleanse me with your holy stomach acids.
---
Nothing like fucking over your teammates!
---
It's fine to say you are impatient.
---
Not even a remote chance are they "within one spot of one another."
---
After the rework, Freddy is one of the better killers in the game, and you have to play in a very specific way against him. He catches people out CONSTANTLY, he can teleport TO GENERATORS AT WILL, FAKE OUT TELEPORTS, he has snares, FAKE PALLETS WTF, and for his size his lunge is literally basically the same as demogorgon. Don't even get me started on how powerful falling asleep is in general with fake pallets, snares, negative effects, buffs to freddy, etc etc, and how it's automatic. Playing against him is a constant game of cat and mouse, where distance doesn't matter, getting hit resets any tactical wake up you've done.
---
Demo has absolutely none of that. His teleports are based on something he sets, and can be disabled easily, setting them near generators is a guarantee they will be disabled before anyone does that generator. He's also enormous and his color stands out from across the map. He's easily spotted, and he can't hide behind anything during a chase.
---
Demo is a mid rank killer, while Freddy is one of the better in the game currently, only outpaced by broken mechanics (spirit) and OG killers with one shots and wall hacks, and he's got far more mechanics to deal with than any of them, so the survivors are always dealing with him unlike almost any other killer.
---
Hell only take Norwegians IIRC, he already has one in his apartment and is willing to accept another he said
---
So if you're injured when there's still more than 2 gens left you should just do gens?also what if the killer has Franklin's?
---
English is not my first langage (it's not really even a second langage) and i find him speaking slowly
---
I’m not a newbie you fuck I’m making a joke
---
Ah now I feel stupid. Had a survivor teabag every time I fatigued cause I'm a bad nurse. Realized they were in my lobby in another match brought that add on that let's me blink once but walking nurse and another fatigue addons to help with a side of rancor cause Ik he had ds. Ate the ds and mori'd him at the end, it was a good ending for me not him
---
It may be a guessing game but it's still better than Spirit. If you see a pattern in how he jukes, you can try to read him like any killer. You can't really trust red stains anyway.
---
I’ve seen the opposite. Probably because I only play killer
---
Identity V lets you unlock alternate chase themes for both sides.
---
Just sayin'.
---
I didn’t know it was a think a streamer said, I apologise
---
I always preferred Puke Princess, but no foul on the Vommy Mommy crowd.
---
There has been no confirmed plans for the legion to receive a rework, they are reworking other killers true but legion might take awhile to get on their list. As for playing legion there not hard to learn as it’s pretty straight forward I say go for it once you leveled them up a bit as to not get bullied by the survivors. Good add ons are iri button and cold dirt in my opinion
---
Well, I googled "Mr.Envy's" to get to his youtube channel, and let me tell you that I did *not* get what I was expecting.
---
I'd agree if the queue times weren't already horrendous.
---
I haven't been playing DBD lately and switched to Enter the Gungeon just because every time I try to play it's like 10+ minute wait to do anything.
---
That'd crank up the queue times even more and I probably wouldn't even fire up the game  at that point.
---
You could anticipate where they're going to BE rather than where they are now. Not saying that condescendingly, just saying it because a lot of people forget that a long term gain is better than a short term benefit.
---
Silly goose
---
You're correct, my apologies
---
I want spirit lore...
---
It's a nice bandaid fix but considering it applies to the entirety of the screen it makes the game look like a bad trip a lot of the time, which is annoying. It's especially bad on Freddy and certain orange-ish maps. If you have an NVidia card you should try NVidia Freestyle instead, it allows you to "grade" the colorblind filter down to only like 25-40% which keeps the colors from getting _too_ disgusting while still changing the reds to magenta slightly. I've found 45% to be my "sweet spot" where it's visible enough without affecting the rest of the colors too too much.
---
Most games against her are boring tbh and I haven't played enough to find out if she's fun to play as.
---
Check your comment that you made 2 comments ago, now apply that to this. Good-job.
---
It’s a lost battle anyways.. not gonna force myself to not have fun while playing a game.. 🤷‍♂️
---
Counterpoint: it's kinda hot
---
That’s a very dangerous territory to walk into for two big reasons. 
---
One: since survivors are all able to do everything equally now, giving small buffs for the things they all do enforces a survivor/skin meta. Healing faster is very important and some survivors if given perk related extra buffs for no reason means survivors will feel disadvantaged for simply playing a character they like. 
---
Two: DLC survivors. Depending on how these survivors “passives” are in terms of strength this will cause a feeling of Pay to Win/Play for a survivor you ultimately have to re-grind EVERYTHING for. It’s not like killers who are already varied in their power and playstyle.
---
I beg to differ, mine gaming is incredibly fun
---
No no I get it. The point is that it's kind of the *only* way to use Clown's bottles, which is a dumb limitation which doesn't need to exist for an already mediocre power.
---
Yeah because I made myself sound VERY smart
---
You right... it’s almost like she’s chosen all the time because it’s an easy win or something 🤔
---
Make bag add ons base kit and that's probably enough tbh
---
Because the tunneller procs the buff earlier, and the remaining 3 players are still healthy. You only need to down someone twice tops to finish them, and the buff doesn't fully compensate for the missing teammate.
---
Hey friends, 
---
Does buying the rift grant me any auric cells upon purchase? Or any auric cells I get for the rift is from leveling it up? Thanks.
---
Sure just tell me what perks you have on the survivor you play the most and i can come up with a decent build for them with the perks you have
---
Our ghost face brother
---
Because both ranged killers are female, Vommy Mommy and Hummy Mummy, I can't hate the name.
---
But the animation is not complete, i.e. "normal" play has not resumed. If you're done with the animation before M1 is clicked, then you're definitely scott free. Same concept as the windows. Just hitting "vault" doesnt automatically mean you're safe. Your model needs to clear the range of the weapon.
---

---
&gt;escaping traps shouldn't be down to rng
---
no!!! please don't gut my OP crutch perk slippery meat!!!! u___u
---
Imagine if loitering in the exit area gave you a mini Blood Warden.
---
Yeah I get that, but I also wanna have fun while playing a video game... only thing I can do is hope she gets fixed prior to the surge popularity
---
Gen boy could run detectives hunch as well to find those totems, could be good. Backup boy could run a looting build to try to get keys and spice up the game.
---
I think the sentiment is directed more at appreciating DBD staying true to its roots instead of trying to be competitive when it really isn't balanced as such.
---
Yea it’s not the spirits fault or the one controlling her even if he has bad internet, this is all dead by daylight s fault they need to provide a stable connection all around like big platform games do
---
We talk about trapper every day here, trapper and Otzdarva
---
Exactly. Seems like it takes 10 tries when I play survivor and it only takes one try when I play killer lol.
---
You have to level it up, but you get back what you spent on it when you reach the last cell granting tier
---
But it was me, *DIO*
---
You said using 2 perk slots for reduced fall stuns.
---
He has literally one unhooking perk, and not even a good one.
---
I mean... with one set of archives per chapter, and the fact that we've started with trapper, its going to be a looooooooooong time till then.
---
Here comes The Trapper
---
You're gonna step into his traps
---
Smh my head
---
I aspire to be a wholesome killer main just trying to have fun like him
---
he doesn't use the secondary power button so it should be that imo so you don't have to pick it up again ever if you wanna reset
---
The riff of his last legion one though 😱
---
its really as simple as making his bag base kit, thats his main problem.
---
That’s ass I’ve tried survivor and it boots up real quick
---
Well, to be honest I fell ambiguity about this perk. I'm mostly survivor main so probably my point of view about this is not accurate, but I do feel like most of the time this perk rewards killers that can't handle a chase and need a buff speed + instadown. I know when you see noed you're supposed to just open the door and quit asap and if I want to counter it "jUsT rUn SmAll GaMeS", but yeah lol still irritating  to see a match of 0k becoming 3k because yeah survivors did try to save teammates
---
 Empathy and WGLF
---
When will Chapter/Level 2 of the Archives unlock? I looked at the patch notes and couldn't seem to find it.
---
Yee I’m pretty sure somebody said defensive strike and I’m pretty sure it became a small meme or something
---
My issue with the Plague is that she's broken on a conceptual level - the second aspect of her ability is so deeply unfun for survivors that it's become "meta" to not cleanse against Plague, which is also unfun because it's like spending the whole match with NOED active.
---
Really depends on the question you asked. I could probably give insight about it.
---
Right, because Sprint Burst will always activate before Balanced Landing so if you run both, you will never get haste from Balanced and will only receive the stagger reduction. So 2 perk slots only for stagger reduction
---
Survivor is a lot quicker for me. Only takes 5-10 mins in a solo que while in a swf usually takes 20m.
---
Tbf I'm an Ochido fan. I watched Ochi waay before Otz and even to this day I'll go back to watch the parody videos. **THAT BEING SAID** I'd say Otzdarva is my second favorite youtuber (next to Dukesloth) and I think he's by far the best person to watch when trying to become not just a better killer but a better DbD player as a whole.
---
I watched Ochido not for tips (because he never meant it to be that way) but I watched to see how wacky things could get and to see his funny edits. Idk man, he wasn't for everyone and now he's irrelevant so someone's happy.
---
(1 of 4 I guess)
---
Tbh the main problem is just that he has to pick up his traps. Imo just give all his traps baseline to his bag and rework trapper bags to something else. Once they are down they can be picked up back up as usual
---
If you're not being chased or rescuing someone you should be doing gens no matter what unless you have time to heal with your team without getting behind on your objective
---
Ah but you see one stalkyboi stands big and the other crouches small so they’re completely different characters!
---
I believe it ends on the 9th or 10th, It wouldve ended on the 1st if it didnt get delayed
---
If you spawn next to a generator, is there a good chance that that is a perk by the killer? I feel like as soon as I work on a generator I spawn right next to the killer pops up immediately. Or is it just bad timing?
---
i mean, it is only 90 seconds, maybe could say itd injure the Face of Death-ed instead of downing, think thatd be a bit more balanced?
---
nurse too!
---
You should repost this, deserves more attention than just 60 upvotes
---
Now I want to see Bowser as a killer also I would use green machine that would be really funny
---
As an aside, I wish more challenges were killer specific. I think only 2 were?
---
Again, I agree that it’s poor design. A perk that either does literally nothing or allows you to get free kills is stupid beyond belief. At the same rate though, if the killers running NOED sometimes you just have to realize someone’s gonna have to be left behind.
---
I didn't know I needed this
---
&gt;That locker play is so old it just never works anymore.
---
I mean it still works sometimes to buy a few more seconds usually. But if you're doing it you're already kinda like "I'm going down so might as well hop in and out of the locker to maybe buy some time and for memes"
---
You're contradicting yourself. 
---
Cheapest license to obtain.... because it isn't as largely followed as so many other options.
---
Each of the first 3 films has grossed (to date) about $12-14M each since the late-80s. However, more recent films, like Judgement, released last year straight to video, didn't even break $500k. Total gross for the series,   only $48M.
---
While I'm sure there are plenty of fans out there, the numbers don't crunch for a widespread game release that will sell well due to people being familiar with the characters.
---
The Evil Dead series got a HUGE boost from the 2013 reboot, which on its own grossed $54M, far outshining the Hellraiser series with a single film. Add the Ash vs Evil Dead series popularity feeding nostalgia for the original films, their choice for him as a survivor made sense. Total gross boxoffice for the franchise, $154M.
---
Halloween (2018) grossed $254M boxoffice,  $13M domestic. The entire franchise has grossed $618M boxoffice.
---
Scream franchise, a mere 4 movies, $603M boxoffice, and the TV series has been running the last three years as well.
---
Stranger Things. 'Nuff said there. No brainer, obviously.
---
Freddy (A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise) has grossed $448M boxoffice.
---
Now, some of these numbers could be adjusted for inflation, but many of these earlier films cover the same time periods (or earlier) as the Hellraiser originals (late 80s, early 90s), meaning the inflation adjustment is moot, excepting later films. Given that the latest Hellraiser film didn't even make it into theaters, you have your answer.
---
You've got a small, dedicated fan base, but not enough of a widespread following to make it a financially good decision to develop a new killer in DBD around.
---
I doubt they’re going to go in order though. They just wanted the first time around to be some of the first characters created. So who knows when she’s gonna have hers. What we need is for Miss Piggy to take her 15mins of fame... I miss the rollercoaster of emotions not knowing if you were gonna get the trap off or not
---
ngl her mori kinda turns me on ;) 
---
She could come into my room as I sleep and puke down my throat anytime
---
I got cussed out for facecamping as Bubba when all gens were done and gates were open. I didn't even use Ruin. But no, people want to get nasty when I'm just confirming a kill vs a stacked out survivor team. There's a time and a place for facecamping.
---
wait, he did a whole stream of just Ghostface?
---
Honestly I’ve learned not to get discouraged but those swf who teabag and flashlight click the entire game really make me rethink my life choices
---
I think the Wendigo from Until Dawn would be a pretty neat killer, although at this point it’s probably too similar to the Demo from Stranger Things
---
Target rich environment
---
There are no perks that spawn you by a gen, its just common sense as a killer to pick a gen far from themselves to walk to since survivors generally spawn relatively far from killer. The only things that influence where you spawn are the shroud offerings
---
yeah honestly if it's 5 gens left and someone dc's like that, I'm also dc'ing (unless there's party streamers or something)
---
I'm sorry 3 man 5 gen isn't any fun and I just wanna play the game
---
2% is quite large especially if combined with hope making you 109% speed. Nearly faster than spirit and huntress and fast enough to loop 115% killers several times around 1 pallet late game. Even without hope 2% goes a long way at loops when you cut corners.
---
Yeah to see wether ghostface is viable or not. Look on his youtube to see the score. He lost 0 times during the entire stream.
---
I feel like an idiot, I CANNOT get Mechanical Obsession to trigger with my killers. Is there a secret? I smack the same gen twice, but it still wont pop.
---
The thiccest killer is clown boi
---
Good bot
---
You're entirely discounting skill. You're given debatably 3 of the best killers in the game, even with Nurse's nerfs, for free on all platforms. Plus nearly everyone universally agrees that Spirit is one of the top 3 hardest killers to learn to play properly, along with Nurse and Huntress, so it's not like you can buy her then get carried, you have to know survivor gameplay pretty damn well.
---
Is that a hijab 
---
My main if this gets released
---
Oof that's what those things in the survivor's lobby are
---
Otzdarva actually made a video using Freddy against an object SWF group.
---
Look his channel up if you're interested.
---
&gt;!Sorry I'm a filthy mobile user that doesn't know how to post links!&lt;
---
I mean, it's pretty useless in you're a solo player lol. Definitely op for a SWF that doesn't really even need it normally. But I have no friends who play DBD so I have never been able to use it other than to get myself tunneled haha. Maybe that's what they call 'balance'?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ds11xe/level_4_of_tome_1_all_killer_and_survivor/
---
I love Otz more than anything
---
You literally just put blood effects over a screen shit and tilted it
---
Probably new players who bought the game cause they’re stranger things fans
---
Shut up, normie.
---
The only reason I wanna hit red ranks is so Otz can kill me
---
NO ONE ESCAPED
---
Exposed.
---
Prayer Beads.
---
Ebony.
---
Plague is fun to play as, and go up against. I enjoy playing her and seeing whether the survivors choose to cleanse or not. Usually makes for a unique gaming experience. 
---
I will definitely go against her over all the damn Huntress mains in red ranks recently.
---
Ah, yes, Empathy. Very clearly an unhooking perk, because it lets you find the person that you just unhooked. The person that was, literally, right on top of you, and which you saw exactly which direction they headed towards afterwards.
---
I, too, only ever equip that perk when I'm doing an unhooking build, so that I can know the location of the one survivor who's location I already know.
---
A thorough and informative list. Thank you!
---
ofc Ghostface is viable lol what was the impetus for this?
---
Also, did he stalk even once?
---
I was on 12 attempt in a row I think at some point. Maybe it was 9. I don't remember, but it wasted so much time that somewhere I gave up and accepted my fucking fate.
---
You actually have to play the game.
---
Yeah the question and the dc make you not want to play the game.
---
How long will the Withering Blight event last?
---
Anybody see what the level 4 archives look like. I did and they make me scared, I’m not very good when it comes to challenges.
---
I swear I click on these just to find and upvote you.
---
Exactly. Addons are supposed to have an upside and a downside so that you can customize to your needs, or throw off a survivor with how your killer now plays. All upside addons are dumb.
---
The thing is he due to dedicated servers it is like that it’ll be fixed in due time but the stalking me will be made impossible due to the time given to hit the person , if the person there is a good player he would already planed a route to lose or loop the killer and by the time the killer does that it’ll be gone or maybe be hit at last second . The reason of him stalking really quick might be due to addons
---
Quit it. You're denying your teammates altruism points.
---
If only there were some stage between standing Survivor advantage and utter hopelessness.
---
Of course, all survivor mains get depressed when they have to play anyone other than baby Wraith.
---
Yeah but now spirit doesn’t have fun because you DC’ed and neither will your teammates
---
Farm build? These were just the only decent perks on my load out plus WGLF encourages you not farm
---
I haven't ever really seen anyone complain about either of these two, save for GF's reveal mechanic being buggy.
---
People saying she has 0 counterplay
---
Fun fact- Detectives Hunch adds the totems for free without the need of red twine :)
---
I was *SUPPOSED* to go to northern california this weekend to get some nightscape photos of the recent fire damage... until I got fucking sick and had to punt the trip. Soooo I figured why not channel that frustration and redo our favorite clown? I was never really happy with my [first attempt at the clown](https://i.imgur.com/906xtj6.jpg) - I liked the IDEA of the spider-like legs, but didn't realize until i posted it and you guys pointed it out... that he looked like he had tiny baby legs.. and I couldn't unsee that haha.

**Next up**: Still planning on leatherpapi 
---
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
To answer some common questions:
---
&gt; "Are you / when are you going to do X killer?"
---
Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including Demogorgan and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen.
---
&gt; "Are you going to do the survivors?"
---
No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight). And no technology exists capable of making colors bright enough to accurately depict like 98% of Min's outfits. 
---
&gt; "Can I use this design for a tattoo?"
---
My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.
---
&gt; What equipment/apps do you use?
---
Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved. 
---
&gt; What else do you work on?
---
Quite a bit - I'm also working on hashing out a [Fallout series](https://i.imgur.com/OjxZuoT.jpg) similar to this one, working on two seperate sets of tarot cards (one based on my [own designs](https://i.imgur.com/kwbBgl2.jpg) and one based on [hiphop / rap artists](https://i.imgur.com/Fky8eva.jpg)), regularly doing pieces based on Ari Aster's films [Hereditary](https://i.imgur.com/bm1gcmO.jpg) and [Midsommar](https://i.imgur.com/Vf5PIhP.jpg), and I'm also a [nightscape photographer](https://www.instagram.com/davecarender/)... so I stay busy. 
---
&gt; Are you making stickers / prints?
---
Yes. The plan is to do both once the series is finished - stay tuned, or check my IG for the latest about it. 
---
More of my work can be found on my IG at: [@gopencyprep](https://www.instagram.com/gopencyprep/) give it a follow.
---
Yea but this was just the first time they did it, I fully expect them to release more character specific challenges. You gotta start somewhere.
---
I've been having this problem too, Ps4.
---
No idea why you got downvoted into the dirt. In the last couple months I've improved from green to red ranks and the killer queue is always instant while the survivor queue takes an average of 15-20 minutes.
---
Last time I remember having a long killer queue is when I was rank 17-20.
---
I've been having this problem too.  Ps4
---
Ohhhhh, that looks a lot like paying to advance the Rift because it's so grindy as to be impossible for anyone with careers or families!
---
We'll see if I'm right.
---
r/Feelswholesome
---
Me too, Ps4.
---
Yeah I see what you're saying and I agree too, so thank you for that ! Just I feel injustice in those situations and in other forum I feel like I'm the only one feeling that ? cause it can be counter, but I mean... in a map like swamp lol I think I just find once a hex totem.
---
videogame logic is best logic
---
Ad a solo player I find the killer tends to just tunnel me or be really sweaty thinking it's a tryhards SWF lol
---
You think so? I don’t want to bug people by posting this again
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ds34eq/please_just_break_pallets_even_pretty_new_players/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Trapper was my first Main and I struggled to 4k with him, not that all the survivors always escaped, usually it was 2 or 3 killed. now, I’m in red ranks, and it’s usually hard to not 4k with him. I don’t even use Ruin on him, Otz has taught me so much with Trapper it’s supernatural
---
That just makes using a mori worse than hooking. I don't think spending 7k BP to be worse is very fun.
---
You forgot the part where I have less gens, because 4 people were alive for longer, repairing them at full speed. If proposed buff doesn't make 3 survivors more efficient at repairs than initial 4, then I'm in worse situation than tunneller.
---
Anyway, it doesn't feel like this discussion moves anywhere. You definitely think making game more sweaty is the way to "solve" tunnelling. 
---
Have a nice day in the fog
---
Yea, I think the survivor ones are manageable but the killer ones... 😬I guess they’re called Master Challenges for a reason
---
I literally enjoy playing against pretty much every killer.  Also, I'm not even a survivor main, only play survivor when friends are on. Why bring toxicity into such a chill thread? We are all disagreeing with each other but being respectful.
---
That's definitiely a thing on some website.
---
Debatable and also varies from player to player and is very situational.
---
This isn't nearly as skewed as people have made it out to be. Hope is a very powerful perk in the hands of a good survivor. 7% movement speed is *a lot*: it decreases your speed disadvantage by almost 50% against regular killers, and 70% against 4.4m/s killers. It enables you to significantly prolong chases, and often to convert any distance you make into enough distance to make it to an exit gate.
---
Hope is more consistent than Adrenaline, not being as dependent on the timing of its activiation as the latter is. Hope is better against NOED. Hope is better when in the Deep Wound or Broken state. Hope does not exhaust you, retaining access to your Exhaustion perk(s).
---
In solo-queue where you cannot coordinate the activation timing of Adrenaline, I think that there is actually an argument to be made that Hope is the better perk. Adrenaline obviously has a bunch of other benefits (such as healing you up from the ground or off a hook), but they are less reliable. In a lot of cases, your Adren will simply proc while you are on a gen and at best you get a health state out of it, in exchange for being exhausted.
---
I only condone this if the hooked survivor is a toxic cunt. Cause as someone who plays both. I’ve started meeting the worst of both. Face camping sucks 100% of the time. And if you’ve played fairly, then the killer is a bitch baby. 
---
However, if you were a tea bagging dick, then I will make it my mission to tunnel/sacrifice you and only you. Funnily enough, I used to be the dude who tea bagged but now I see how annoying it is from the other side. 
---
Also gen rushing and tunneling are valid ways to play a quick game. Be stealthy/sneaky going around corners and diligent to check gens and it’s not a big deal as either. However, for me I like to pace the game to get more points so I’m cool with just stabbing changing course or simply watching from afar.
---
It’s already out
---
I first saw it on a Not Otz video.
---
This outfit was released this past weekend.
---
0–0
---
Can you run a styptic agent and an instant heal syringe together so that you'll be invincible until the heal takes effect?
---
WHUT
---
What’s freddys pill bottle?
---
Maybe nobody wants to play Quentin to unlock it?
---
Cap your fuckin knees, I will
---
And that's the problem with keys. The killer is playing well and then loses to chest rng.
---
In regards to point 1, you are literally saying that a number of killers shouldn't be allowed to use their fucking abilities
---
in regards to point 2, they do need to work on spawns because all 4 spawn together way too often without an offering, but I think the opposite would be worse for the game. All 4 survivors spawning at totally separate points on the map and hopping on a separate gen is essentially a loss for the killer unless they have Corrupt Intervention or maybe Ruin
---
I always do gens and sneak around because I'm bad at looping but if I'm injured I want to be healed so I always run a med kit but if the killer has Franklin's self care is really good
---
r/unpopularopinion but I think this is a slightly decent perk, I just have no exhaustion perks.
---
I'll have to try this tonight, because I thought you would need either the rainbow map or red twine.
---
She absolutely destroys solo players, which is why I hate her more than Doctor or Spirit.
---
Even though most people have gotten the message that cleansing is dangerous, you're still afflicted with the broken status effect, so you go down in 1 hit, which is really tough because nobody can loop forever, so you die anyway. I run Iron Will in like 80% of all my games, and the sickness effects reduce its helpfulness.
---
The thing that really irks me is that you get punished for doing anything altruistic, because the infection spreads. They should make it so you can only become sick by the actual killer's vomit.
---
Well keys are really rare in chests. I had ace in the hole and plunderers instinct and all I got was green keys.
---
 Just finished the 1st Tome.  I need one too, gemme that Tome Machine!  I like it :D
---
This may seem silly, but have you completed the first challenge?  You have to start on the top left.
---
Didn’t think of that one
---
IMO it’d be much fairer if you got, say, the speed boost from the start of the game, but the totem was already lit. The exposed would still wait till exit gates.
---
Well, there's Redhead's pinky finger...
---
lol that's what i call "BINGO!"
---
Just to be sure, But this is Marge Simpson about to YEET right the fuck up before some dubstep drops right? Honestly this is some quality shit, not gonna lie.
---
There’s no guarantee that most of those effects will even occur in the match. The exhaustion part is decent if you’re in a self, but not really good enough to take up a perk slot imo
---
Guilty as charged. My first killer game I played as demo and I got one hook.
---
I can feel them resisting a purely human looking character. Even legion had to get masks and hoods to make sure it was easy to recognize. But I can't think for the life of me they could make Jack look like a killer (minus the axe and dirt). Maybe post-freeze?
---
That would make sense
---
Biggie smalls
---
No one should be kink shamed, unless degradation is your kink. In that case you should feel very very shameful you naughty person.
---
HEXes are just annoying. I may sound biased, but they are fucking horrible. I hate to deal with hexes, as I am never lucky at finding them and I fucking hate using them as killer, as they are random based perks and if they are destroyed you lose a perk slot, but they are too strong to be ignored. They need a rework, honestly.
---
I was talking about people who say that the archives will get survivors and killers playing the opposite roles and consequently lead to everyone “understanding” each other.
---
I don’t ever teabag when I’m trying to give the killer hit points. But whenever I try to give them hits they always  try to catch me off guard and kill me
---
Predator
---
:(((((((
---
I've only been playing Huntress for about a week so I'm still learning all the intricacies, but something that has happened several times now is that I got survivors to vault a window right into my face and had a hatchet ready for that but the hit didn't register, and I know for a fact that it connected with the direct center of their character model and I didn't hit the frame of the vault or anything. I reviewed my footage to make sure. 
---
Does anyone know what causes this? Am I too close to them or something like that?
---
there's one video where he calls a survivor trash on stream and in the comments of the youtube vod he apologizes for acting that way. we stan a self-aware king
---
He plays survivor just as much as killer, I think it’s more the fact he always comes up against strong swf and obviously gets a tough game although with survivor even if you have a tough match it’s nowhere near as bad as killer - I play both Killer rank 5 and Survivor rank 4 but as a solo survivor and solo (obviously) killer I can say 100% that killer makes you work harder but survivor is more consistently fun.
---
I think the game is in a pretty good state atm in terms of balance, maybe small adjustments to Spirit audio cues, Plague and Freddy as well as Borrowed Time and Object of Obsession - I think keys and hatch need a rework too, unfair for a killer or survivor that’s had a really good game just to potentially lose out on a pip because of rng.
---
You're the one getting offended. All they did was use different term to describe exactly what the player just said they like to do.
---
Proximity camp the basement if you want to proximity camp the basement, but dont get butthurt when someone calls a spade a spade.
---
Vigil just isn’t a good perk, and it used to be good before they made some changes to how exhaustion worked.
---
People meme on him because he looks more like Gollum from lord of the rings.
---
If you spin around enough in his hospital gown, it eventually becomes a flat plane of cloth around his neck, like Jupiter's rings. It's not perfect, but it keeps me going.
---
sure, but what is compelling you to find fault in a post that is literally flaired “shitpost/meme” though
---
You can replace urban evasion, you can't crouch faster than the killer so it doesn't make that much of a difference. If you don't want to leave scratch marks walk when you hear a heartbeat and it does almost the same as urban evasion.
---
If you really like urban evasion you can change calm spirit, it's godlike against doctor and infectious fright (plague teachable where you scream if she downs a survivor near you) but it's mostly useless in any other case, no one really runs spies from the shadows.
---
It was the "kys" that got you suspended. I don't think it was deserved since you're talking about him killing himself in game. But you should have just the littlee bitch boy be a little bitch boy and not messaged him at all.
---
He eats your heart like a Cuban if you get hooked 3x
---
Advice on getting the 4K challenge? I mean I’ve gotten 4ks before, it’s more about increasing the chances with the right build etc. warning, rank 16 killer do not going to Spirit/Billy faces off.
---
Who's butthurt? I typed 2 words and you're writing me lil love letters about it, I think you're the one who's butthurt here.
---
They aren't too strong to be ignored, except maybe ruin but that isnt strong it is just required. All totems also have a fixed spawn so they wont work against good survivors.
---
That would actually be super awesome, and even though I hate the invisible characters I’d have to let that one slide
---
I got called a cheater the other day cuz I was playing sniper doc and I kept shocking a guy before he'd run to really obvious windows (The super safe ones in the barn on farm) and I also had BBQ, Discordance, and the ghostface one where you can see their auras when they vault windows. He said I had to be hacking because my shocks were way too on point lol. I was playing on console too, which just makes it funnier cuz who the hell can hack DbD on console?
---
Gotta wait for the next 3 sets of challenges to be unlock able.
---
When using the "Pustula Petals", you still get the bonus if you die?
---
Right ? Right ? But you gotta collect those BP...
---
The entity keeps him in constant "need to peepee" mode.
---
It's still a kick in the gut to have your music get stripped from 80% of the killers.
---
It’s impossible to tell who is SWF and who isn’t. So if I see an object user that doesn’t play like an outright potato, I’m probably gonna lump them in with a SWF team. Object can single handedly Ruin the game for Any non-Spirit killer.
---
I don't understand why they stay, especially if no ones hooked and I had a bad game. It's annoying when i've already accepted my loss, but my time is wasted if I don't chase them out of the exit gates to watch them teabag.
---
Please BHVR, Mr. Envy and Jon Rob make good stuff
---
Huntress has really whacky hitboxes, especially with dedicated servers being implemented. It’s also not uncommon for a survivor to be hit by a hatchet that clearly should have went past them for the same reason
---
Baby Freddy here, could use some advice!
---
1) I've been running BBQ, Ruin, Pop, but not sure about 4th perk. I originally ran Noed, then switched to Make your choice, and while it feels pretty nice i wonder whether there are some better perks. Save the best for last? Franklin's? Something else?
---
2) Any good addon combos apart from double ropes, brush+swing chains? Any good build using black box? I don't really like fake pallets since if you get a map with bs loop you can shut it down with snares but not pallets. 
---
3) I've seen a lot of streamers pushing survivors in specific direction since it's "weaker loop that way". Is there an easy way to learn which way is weaker or is it something that comes with experience? Should i not think about that as a freddy and instead think of optimal snare positions to shut down loop altogether? I've noticed that once survivors see me place snares they tend to abandon loop asap even if they haven't looped me even once there.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Hell nah. Brown sack should be base kit. A fixed time instead of... oh I hope he doesnt get out of the trap first try... well shit, time to move that trap.
---
Have you thought about the leatherface chapter?
---
I can already see the master challenge: sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement while using the perk insidious, must be completed in one trial.
---
Pinhead/Samara from The Ring
---
You really think people look at flairs?
---
*laughs in devour hope*
---
Stealing a line from N00b3, The only time your gonna use an exhaustion perk is during a chase, and if your in a chase no matter what you can’t get exhaustion back, and if your not in a chase why would you need to get exhaustion back faster
---
 [https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us) 
---
Have you tried contacting support? I don't know of any other way to help, sorry.
---
Then consider yourself lucky, because almost every single person I know who was killer and experienced the glitch got hit with a ban not even a day later
---
GF: Ruin, Nurses, Sloppy, Thanat. Don’t stalk, get as many wounded as fast as you can, then creep on them healing/doing gens. Chase as little as you can, break mid-chase to hit targets you see. Keep them guessing where you are and it will stall them well.
---
Exactly my queue times. But apparently if you don't conform to the majority you are being downvoted. Toxic members / reddit I guess. I bet they are the same who DC everytime they are hooked.
---
You want to swing an axe at Evan MacMillan
---
But you don't have one cause you're not a killer
---
I play on console so dedicated servers are a nonfactor 
---
&gt; It’s also not uncommon for a survivor to be hit by a hatchet that clearly should have went past them for the same reason
---
yeah i also used to think this but after playing her a lot i just think this is bullshit now. and i think the people who say this don't play huntress at all
---
Green, Purple and Red ranks is always instant for me. Haven't played in grey ranks for months though so I can't say.
---
Survivors on the other hand it's 10 minutes way everytime.
---
Think about it, pennywise can literally do anything! His balloons could float around the map and if they touch you he teleports to you or maybe the balloon drags you to him... or possibly instead of being hooked your characters eyes could glow and your character floats like in the sewer scenes 
---
Plus sense he’s a bit of a psychedelic villain maybe jagged each generator the players teleport to different parts of the map
---
Ruin is necessary, Wraith is very susceptible to early game pressure, and Corrupt Intervention is not as helpful because he can move around the map easily.
---
BBQ is one of the best perks on him due to his mobility. The rest is more of a flex spot:
---
Make your Choice is top tier for the same reason. 
---
You can pair Ruin with Haunted Grounds if you want, helps secure more hooks early game. 
---
STBFL is a good choice too since you will be M1-ing pretty often. You can pair it with Infectious Fright too.
---
Spirit Fury+Enduring is great since he has pallet breaking add-ons while stealthed and it allows you to chase easier (one of his weaknesses).
---
Sloppy Butcher+Nurses Calling is a great combo too if you want to sneak up on healing people.
---
His add-ons are what make or break him. Use either Bone Clapper or Coxcombed Clapper with Ghost to confuse enemies and sneak up on them better or add-ons that make him quicker around the map.
---
Idk why I hate toxicity in games yet I come back. Why do I do this to myself?
---
It is killer makns are just getting more entitled
---
Paulie Esther was talking about those challenges and suggested they may be changed before release. That seems realistic cuz some of them are just stupid.
---
Still better than vs a Spirit imo.
---
I thought I was crazy for wanting them
---
I’ve thought about adding the grudge (I think she’s the same as the ring) like when she’s the villain add TV sets everywhere and if you linger too long in front of a screen she crawls out and goes after you
---
It's just so funny to me becuase farming is mostly for the survivors anyway imo. Like I get 40k for a bad game as killer (with bbq) so I don't really need to farm lol
---
But yeah that David was really dumb tbh. I hit him once and he used his speed burst to run straight into a wall.
---
"kill yourself" shouldn't be said for any reason.
---
That's the joke
---
There's a big difference between a mother/father and a mommy/daddy
---
He's commented on posts here before.
---
Yea but what if they aren’t running an obsession perk.
---
Try looking at the survivor when you hit them.
---
I don't know how you missed so many times and this isn't supposed to be BM.
---
Judging by the downvotes, they don’t
---
Same for me, I feel like garbage when it does happen to me yet I can’t think of any other game to play lol.
---
I see what you've done
---
&gt; though in regards to chainsaws I do feel that a free instadown any time as much as you like is kinda bullshit but I'm not gonna get into that argument
---
This is a big yikes. It is not bullshit lol getting chainsaws is not easy
---
&gt; the issue is 3 survivors down in less than a minute followed by the only person still standing DCing and then the other 2 DCing.
---
If this happens it is because the survivors massively fucked up. What rank do you play where this is actually an issue? This doesn't even happen in pure rank 20 games
---
Doesn’t mean that survivor has an obsession perk.  Just means someone does.  I’ve been the obsession without an obsession perk many times while my teammate has DS.
---
&gt; but he is also right that you can easily waste time doing it in some cases
---
This is something you can say about any killer's power
---
Damn, i'm quite surprised it sounds so short.
---
Do you have any idea if legion's lunge during Frenzy is of similar length ?
---
Had someone sabo all my event hooks. Needless to say, once I found them, I saboed their life.
---
Oh well I guess I’m wrong then. Still I feel like DS doesn’t help very often.
---
"Coffin" a more balanced and better game then dead by daylight ever was.
---
Yeah I think its because the banning system is automated lol. I just wanted to let him know if he actually tried to give playing against the nurse a go he might get something from it.
---
Exhaustion perks are a crutch. You don't need them to loop a killer for multiple gens.
---
David and Ernesto De La Cruz!
---
You don't get to assign me an opinion, especially if you intend to fake nice afterwards, and especially when you're cropping what I actually suggested to fit your argument, so yeah, I am done talking with you.
---
They’re scary 
---
EDIT: I feel most of the survivor ones are manageable except for the one where you have to unhook three survivors in the endgame collapse within one trial
---
Uhm no. I've played ghostface the way the devs intended and the way tru3 showed it. The results were obvious to me. I don't do shit just because some big streamer does it, however I do watch streams like otzdarva's and tru3's to see what I can improve on. If the way they do it gets me better results then it must be better than what I was currently doing. Ultimately I think having a balance between tru3's gameplay and stalk may  be better but there is no need when you 4k 6 matches in a row. 
---
I dont get this anti-streamer mentality either. I watch streams like orzdarva's regularly to improve my trapper play for example. Nothing wrong with gathering information from different sources lol. 
---
Rank 5 survivor aswell and rank 1 killer atm. Dont know why you brought up rank but ok.
---
Funny thing is I was gonna let the last guy escape :/
---
It's well known anyway that survivor have all rights to anything
---
Mig-15? Try sr71 blackbird friend
---
One time I was playing Huntress and these two survivors started running around at the exit gates as a way to make fun of me. So I decided to start doing some target practice on them with my hatchets. The injured one didn't think it was time to leave after getting hit with one. I hit him with another hatchet. He went down. I picked him up before he could leave. Hooked him right in front of the gate. Everyone else was either dead or already left.  
---
That's what his dumbass gets for not leaving.
---
*crikeys
---
God tier
---
You’re rank 16, tbh you can play M1 Nurse and get a 4K vs newbies at that rank. Just play whatever.
---
No mither with iron will counter stridor
---
Also this shouldve just been a damn meme/shitpost but somehow it turned into a tru3 hate conversation again.
---
Give it some time, there's a lot of little issues throughout the game. Lots of balance tweaks needed, although it is so much better than it has been in the past. Dedicated servers crested it's own issues. Instadown hatchets, prayer beads, killers with no reliable counterplay (Legion plague and Spirit), Myers stone add-ons that let you morie people immediately on the spot faster than a normal morie without needing to have hooked them first, balanced landing creating infinites, OoO, Aim assist pulling your swing to the side when you don't want it to, matchmaking (red/purple rank SWF matching with green/yellow rank killer) salty disconnects, players holding the game hostage (not a big issue anymore, but it can still happen. I'm glad you're enjoying it, it's a great game, but we need to keep pushing the devs to fix the issues that remain. Keep praising the devs and keep reminding them it still needs work, and eventually we'll end up with an even better game.
---
interesting, didn't think of that... could totally give it a try!
---
Chapter XIV: Untitled Goose Chapter
---
Get good man. You can still double pip even if you get sacrificed. All you need is to max out chase and objective points. Which means if a game is long enough you can get it. That’ll require you to loop the killer. You just wanna play right, go find the killer and play with him. Carry the team. Honestly people who dc needs an automatic rank reset - To rank 21 where it’s all the trash people who dc because they can’t afford a slight disadvantage. Cry babies in other words.
---
Wait for the next set of challenges? Or don’t rush the challenges and be stuck waiting for who knows how long. We have two months to get there. It’s supposed to take a while.
---
We stan a Jane cosplay
---
For me it was only one game lol
---
Looks like ass tho kinda in game. Half it glows and the other half doesn’t. Might be my settings tho
---
Pretty sure you can send a ban appeal after that. If you didn't intentionally cause it and/or made it happen multiple times there's no reason to get banned for that other than getting an automated ban that's obviously without good reason.
---
How do I use rusty shackles as Hag? Been playing hag a lot around ranks 10-7, usually do well with range and trap setting speed add ons. 
---
But I am so used to the sound notification you get when someone triggers the trap when you aren't using rusty shackles. Whenever rusty is equipped, the only notification you get is the teleport prompt appearing at the bottom of the screen. It usually takes me a second to use it, and by then the survivor is long gone. 
---
Is there a secret to using this addon? Is it only good with mint rag? TEACH ME HOW TO SHACKLE, MIGHTY HAG MAINS.
---
Its not the size of the boat, its the motion of the ocean
---
I don't see why they wouldn't go in order.
---
Getting a Chainsaw isn't easy, except, you know, when people bodyblock and ride people's asses before starting revving up.
---
This is purple-green ranks. The freshest example of this, which is what happened a bit ago, is I work on a generator, hear the Huntress coming, get up and start crouching away, get a little bit away before hatchet comes flying and should by all accounts have missed as it was behind me and a good few feet past me before it just downed me, I get hooked, then the Huntress walks around a corner, hatchets another survivor, walks around a building and hatchets another, and then the last guy just DCs, then the other 2 DC.
---
Vigil unfortunately became less and less useful after the exhaustion nerfs. 
---
Pre-Nerf? Oh yea, this thing was strong. Getting multiple boosts of speed during one chase was super common if you ran this. Especially on some of the stronger window structures.
---
However, what also really killed it? When the patch hit where Exhaustion is cleared by being hooked. While that was a needed change it rendered Vigil pointless. 
---
The only reason I could see running it is with Sprint Burst, so you can worry less about having it on cooldown. I'd argue Fixated is a better solution instead though as it lets you also get pretty silly stealth plays at tall walls.
---
I call her the Bubonic Babe
---
Boob
---
Otz is awesome but for the the best trapper around and truly also an amazing streamer is Lefty (Theentitylefthand).
---
He talks really slow ngl. I usually finish reading before he finishes speaking at least. Maybe I just read fast idfk
---
I've always wanted to know how the entity got ahold of a demogorgon, like did the mind flayer just say "fuck it" or was there some sort of fight?
---
Playing the patch yeah, they changed it so that the purple one overrides the other because it's not necessary.
---
The eternal tortures of the entities realm. Poor soul...
---
Since nobody's actually explaining the term, "Looping" is running in circles in a path that passes by an undropped pallet. Killers aren't that much faster than Survivors, so while they'll steadily get closer, you can keep them trapped in that one location for a while until you have to drop the pallet to break away.
---
Higher-level players know where pallets spawn, so they then race to the next one and repeat this.
---
More accessibly, you vault windows faster than Killers, but if they're close, they can grab or hit you while you're vaulting, and you want to be directly running at the window, if possible, because there are fast and medium vaults (both will alert the Killer if they're far away).
---
Beyond that, you'll want to pick an exhaustion perk that suits you. Meg has Sprint Burst, which is very basic and activates without you wanting it a lot. David has Dead Hard, which is popular among better players because it lets them finish loops they otherwise wouldn't. Nea has Balanced Landing, which is probably best for a beginner. It gives you a speed boost when you fall from elevated terrain, even a very short distance, but that makes it map-dependent. If you have Feng, she has Alert, which activates on window vaults.
---
I don't even need to reply to this becuase he was spot on  but I will say this (4000hours PC)
---
Archive of our own. It's a fan fiction site. Hit and miss with the content, because inevitably most fics devolve into people wanting to bone Michael Myers but occasionally you get some gems.
---
The claws give information to survivors, especially when playing solo. When they're twitching, the obsession is being chased, and this usually means free time for the rest of the folks. It would hurt survivors to lose this - it's essentially a free perk for everyone.
---
Trager would make a great killer
---
Yea that requires a SWF and for you to literally throw the match at the end
---
&gt;toxic
---
&gt;smart
---
Should I tell them?
---
2 iris and a silver is not enough to double pip at my rank, not that I particularly care about pipping.
---
yes, the loading screen only tells you who the killer is if you have under a certain amount of times playing against that killer, iirc. after that it's a mystery.
---
What name do we pick then?
---
I just want Terminator tbh :(
---
🤔

---
&gt; I've played ghostface the way the devs intended and the way tru3 showed it
---
I do too and do just fine with it. Like, I love how it is just inconceivable to you that you're just not doing it optimally 
---
&gt; Ultimately I think having a balance between tru3's gameplay and stalk may be better but there is no need when you 4k 6 matches in a row. 
---
Who cares if you just get 4Ks over and over and over if you're not even playing the killer's power? What would be the point of playing any individual killer if you're just going to M1 everyone the same way like an NPC? Again, it is hilarious that it is inconceivable to you that you could get 4Ks using the power if you actually learn how 
---
&gt; I dont get this anti-streamer mentality either.
---
It's not "anti-streamer." Tru3 is just boosted and refuses to learn and convinced an army of players of this nonsense about Ghostface. I thought the same thing until I took time to learn maps with Ghostface and how to invest stalk properly. Tru3, and I guess you as well, refuse to
---
&gt; Dont know why you brought up rank but ok.
---
Just to say that I have enough playtime to have a decent idea of how many Ghostfaces are played
---
Finally someone who thinks that it’s fine 
---
I don’t speak English as my first language but I live in Australia n Ye I think it’s fine too
---
The rift creates lousey games where you or your teammates play like potatoes to complete a challenge or vice versa for killer
---
I don’t know man, unrelenting is pretty overpowered. Who needs BBQ when you can have a build consisting only of unrelenting.
---
This perk hinders the user and helps the unhooked
---
I'd just make it a part of the base kit, as most tunneling is caused by the unhooker hiding and unhooked being so easy to track.
---
Just give Steve something else
---
You’re looping every pallet, you juke a hit, you’re opening up the exits gate nowww. You have just survived the Trapper!
---
Edit: got in the moment i posted it
---
They started with Claudette instead of Dwight so they aren’t going from the start. Also if they don’t go randomly then it becomes predictable and you don’t get the same rush of emotions when you find out that your favourite killer or survivor is getting more lore when you weren’t expecting it
---
I don't give a shit about tru3. I give a shit that he convinced thousands of people of his ridiculous opinion on Ghostface
---
For me, SWFs would be solved if I could just sell back or skip bad offerings in the bloodweb. I don't mind getting occasionally curb-stomped, but it does mean I probably just spent some good addons, and especially during events I'm running out of the decent ones. (Fuck you, petals.)
---
And I'm not talking moris or whatever. I've repeatedly run out of Dead Rabbits on Myers, even using all my Black Wards and BBQ and all the BP offerings. Never mind if I'm trying to level someone else up for teachables.
---
Losses to SWFs are ok and unavoidable, but they eat my addons at a rate I can't replace, leaving me less ready for the next round. I really do feel like if they took a look at BP income and spending in general, it'd feel a lot better for everyone.
---
Man the new Vigil buff looks hella fresh
---
Myers? Definitely not. If it’s gonna one of these two for some reason, it should be Ghost Face.
---
baby survivor found
---
Is it ridiculous though? Works better than what people were doing and he ended op flawlessing a whole stream.
---
Love all of these
---
... Wait, for real?
---
I’m perfectly fine with losing. I’ll play iri heads, moris, prayer beads, whatever. But if someone dc’s 20 seconds into the match the game is just...not fun for me. Even if the rest of us escape. 
---
I dunno I just feel “the killer just went easy on us” or “we got carried because it was iron works” and then when if I die it’s like “well this was a waste of time”. Nothing about the match feels good. I’d rather just take an L and go to the next match.
---
You haven’t heard about the new add on that makes hatchets bounce
---
Technically speaking yes, based on the Valentines day set he got awhile back. Got shipped with the Nurse and canonically ripped her heart out of her fucking chest like it was Mortal Kombat.
---
I feel like the entity stole it. Or found a stray one, as there are multiple ones
---
Most gf I’ve vs camp people instead ._. Then hoping to expose the person who is saving 
---
Even vs a gf who had insidious today
---
Okay boomer
---
Precisely, people aren’t actively wanting to play that role they just want to get the challenge rewards.
---
Are you having a stroke
---
Well they're the dumbest idiot on this game. Surprisingly no one has called me a hacker for doing this yet
---
Maybe, still the idea of a battle between two mysterious nightmare creatures from different dimensions is cool
---
I mean I guess that’s fun and all, just at least stay at rank 10 and above. People who go below that usually are trying to be competitive. And you can’t DC just because you don’t like the killer AND try to be competitive. Above rank 10 who gives a shit, it’s a meme show up there. But don’t penalize your team mates who want to be competitive simply because “eh spirit too strong”. Which she is strong but she’s definitely fun to go against. Having to actually pay attention while looping a killer vs going brain dead.
---
Yes, it is. Seriously, if he actually bothered to try and learn he would do fine. But he refuses.
---
Oh yeah, I'm aware. I just separated my like of his work from my dislike of his personal life. It was a shock when I heard it, but he apologized and he moved on so I did too.
---
I will admit it might not be right but believe you can like someone for there work without liking what they do in their personal life.
---
Well, I’m obviously speaking from a killer perspective. There’s this particular group of survivors who automatically charges towards you because they have DS to protect their friends who unhooked them. Granted this is an altruistic and legitimate playstyle. But You see, your sorry ass is the only person I have information on so don’t whine and beach if I come after you again. Now you have the DS and you’re dead on hook. I don’t care. Because from my perspective, it’s optimal. You’re the easiest kill. 
---
This isn’t the case where “oh I’ve been looped by this survivor for two minutes and I’ll have accomplished nothing if I give up my chase”. That’s dumb cuz this is obviously a strong survivor and it’s easier to deal with him if his teammates is injured and he has to deal with them. 
---
Since the topic of discussion is about having perks that pisses the killer off, tunneling is to be expected. I’ll rather sacrifice him ASAP than to have him teabag in my face at the exit gate. 
---
I’m rank 1 spirit plague ghost face main. Seen many toxic survivors and SWFs and the only way to deal with them is to optimize your game. Sometimes it means tunneling. That’s just life in DBD.
---
VidZarg is right! It's the moon shining through the branches!! Lol I never noticed before. For a clearer view, [here's the original](https://i.imgur.com/8PMkn2D.jpg)
---
For a second I thought that was Blood Warden, I was wondering what everyone expected her to do lmao, I am not the brightest
---
We don't know what the Jane did. It could very well be the case that she might have intentionally done something to screw the Fend over, and it was just sweet revenge. Or the Feng was just being a complete asshole.
---
Lol @ that entire response
---
Evidence: that’s how killers work? Pay to win @spirit? 
---
Some killers are debatably worse than others, but people play them because they like them. Why doesn’t that logic follow through with survivors?
---
And yes the game is “balanced” as is so small buffs for survivors would change that balancing, but having all the survivors solely be skins is pretty stupid, especially when the original post is asking for more differentiations for the killers... which are already pretty unique among eachother
---
If i could recreate this meme, i could stack Dedicated Server, tunnel, camp and prayer beads. /r/whoosh
---
r/UnexpectedThanos for balance
---
The only thing that gets banned in my part of town is the accuser's ability to message me. You can't hack the console versions ffs
---
I’ve gotten two rift fragments from a single game with no challenges??
---
Dumbass award for peak dumbassery. Entirely her fault.
---
basically papidwight and his swf.
---
I wouldn’t call it griefing, more just annoying.  The only argument for griefing I can think of is denying the hooked person their struggle points by constantly interrupting it, which is kind of dickish but isn’t game breaking.  That being said the sound effects repeating would get old fast...
---
If I get all the free charms and the buy the pass, i'll get the premium charms too?
---
Nah.
---
i think we need to wait for nea's archives before we make any rash judgments about her (obvious) murderous intentions
---
Wow it's weird seeing how many there are now
---
Just.. run iron will?
---
Oh so she not broken?
---
do yourself a favor and take that stick out of your ass
---
Nah get better lol
---
[https://i.imgur.com/eRdjKJz.png](https://i.imgur.com/eRdjKJz.png) truly the greatest build
---
Why the downvotes for an honest question? 
---
I still have to finish all the challenges and I’ve no idea what you’re talking about yet, so I’d actually like to know the answer to this 😅
---
Where do I go to buy skins with putrid serum? I don’t see any option to buy either putrid serum on the store. Am I just stupid?
---
Ah, a man of culture I see. I wish all survivor mains could be more understanding like you good sir. If survivors could do more than just complain about the killers and ask for constant buffs to survivors the game community would be much better.
---
Michael goes to t4, seeing all survivors through walls, he evolves to t6 giving him 130% movement speed, once he hits t6, the entity gets scared and let’s michael leave.
---
Relax relax. Its the game. That is a known bug. You get unlimited sprint burst if the killer hits you at a specific time if you have DH, SB and BT. 
---
Happened to me so many times and happened against me a few times.  r/bugbydaylight
---
DCing number one in my opinion...but not a fan of any of them.  Don't see the point in teabagging and camping is just not much fun but might be justified on the odd occasion.
---
I'd like Dance with Me or Window of Opportunitky
---
No, not even close. She's just very powerful if used right.
---
Once upon a time, killer queues use to be instant and survivor lobby wait times were 10+ minutes.  Those days are sadly long, long gone.
---
What rank are you?
---
Yes. It is
---
Random Jack off that assumes that anyone that has an issues with instadowns, people DCing, and people not being allowed to play a match for more than a couple minutes clearly doesn't play killer found. Seriously, dude, I've had this game since launch, get off your toxic shit.
---
I'm a survivor main but I agree I love skill checks for some reason idk
---
Deserved it for that stupid head on.
---
It does? That would be great! I’ve heard that apparently dcing works for your trophies... would be nice if the devs could make it fair for the challenges as well.
---
Welcome to DbD where survivors get shit for BP so half the playerbase would rather sit in 30-60 minute queues just to get 60k a match rather than 5 minute queues for 5k BP after being tunneled out by tryhard OP killers who sat a fucking half hour to do that.
---
That is impossible without challenges.
---
You need 1600 xp to get 2 rift shards (800 for 1 shard)
---
A single game can net you 900 xp (if we count in the bonus daily xp)
---
It's not that I refuse to, it's just that I don't see any merrit in doing so. Winning is the objective of a pvp game. I win, I've achieved my goal. Every now and then i'll play with memebuilds but if I were to go full sweat mode you bet your ass tru3's method is the one I'm gonna pick. (if playing with ghostface ofc). It'd be more fun if I stalked thats true but as seen with nurse's base power nerf the devs dont want killers to enjoy their time in the game anymore so I choose to win.
---
Nurse isnt particularly weak now but... it changes the level set.
---
Before I was a fair nurse: With bbq, I see no auras, I'd still leave the area...go unreasonably far away to give people a chance...Some idiot unhooks a survivor and urban evasions away...I'd ignore the wounded survivor and chase one of the other two remaining survivors instead of tunneling. Now it's all about punishing mistakes with a straight face.
---
Dead Hard on dedicated has been 50/50 with exhausting but still going down before it was only 25/75
---
Spies is nowhere near as good as whispers tbh and I very highly recommend getting discordance. It is a top tier information perk on literally any killer
---
She has a telltale when she’s phasing, her shards glow and little particles fall off of her body. And if you are red rank but you still think she has no counterplay then you aren’t red rank really. As a rank 1 I have no difficulty countering her and it actually feels like an intense chase rather than going against people moonwalking. It’s a different feeling. Similar to old nurse, she’s still strong but the old version was fun to go against. Instead of whining about it and agreeing that DCing is the only thing to do, spend time to learn ways to mindgame her. Use your brain, it’s not hard to get into the mind of a killer. Especially if you play killer. Maybe that’s why it’s easier for actual red ranks. Because most of them play both sides. But yeah just keep that mentality and drag your team mates down with you
---
I meant shouldn’t gen rush when the killer is camping.
---
My Killer queues have been much shorter than Survivor queues and both my Killer and Survivor are rank 1.
---
He is the cutest dbd let's player. So it is unsurprising
---
How can anyone say shes fun to go against. You can pay all the attention you want theres no way to loop when it's a game if let's hope I walked the right direction.
---
Well, it’s fantastic, and a lot of people didn’t see it, so I think it would be fine.
---
I play on Xbox and notice that nobody talks.  Ever. Is this normal for everyone else?  I’ve been playing for a couple of months and literally have never heard anyone talk or send a group chat.  The only communication I get is when people get mad and send toxic messages which I enjoy, 😂😂😂
---
Claudette was also in the base game though? They could still be going in order of release.
---
Its working well for me. But i do see videos of people that dead hard with nothing happening other than receiving exhaustion
---
Probably something about having an audience makes them feel a need to flex.
---
You forgot Nea.
---
Nea killer 
---
Comedy achieved
---
i dont speak russian so thanks for telling me - i believed in her innocence and thought it was just having a little bit of fun - sadly i cant report her anymore, but i am glad you told me and proved me wrong :D
---
No sir.
---
He seems OP to me. His reveal is buggy, when he's revealed, he gets a free counter-reveal he absolutely doesn't need, and he NEVER loses stalk progress, just the ability to stalk briefly (which will recharge in chases).
---
Exactly! I’ve never DCed, had a blue screen once or twice... but even if it’s just 10k blood points, imma stay and take it.
---
And anyways, I don’t wanna be that jerk who abandons their teammates just becoz...
---
Anyone else waiting for the 2nd lvl Tome?
---
Looping counters most of them right off the bat.
---
What's interesting is most of the time when I play against spirits is that you can tell that the person isn't that good, spirit is just easy. So many times I play against them I just think,"wow I would destroy you if you were playing literally any other killer". And even worse, these types of people with this kind of power are encouraged to sweat. I see spirits who go out of their way to tunnel or play scummy than most other killers. Good headphones is all you need to play spirit nothing else.
---
You don't need Blood Warden, anyway. It's just 1 sacrifice.
---
David King has arrived
---
I absolutely agree with you on this one, it's been too much.
---
I'm running Rancor for it. NOED is probably better, but I'm also greeding for Adept Spirit since I unlocked her.
---
Had this happen but with hillbilly. I chainsaw sprinted into the exit area and got the last guy, who had well enough time to leave just decided to stand at the entrance waiting to teabag....... They had full health too, God it felt so good.
---
Trust me it's no better for people playing him either. I hear the music sting, I flee across the Atlantic ocean, cross ten European borders, trek across the Russian plains and bury myself a thousand meters beneath the Ural mountains and I still get revealed.
---
God you are awful
---
Haha
---
As the light fades look at that exit gate and tell me...do you have any regrets?
---
If there were a Killer in this game that could "pull" Survivors close (like Strangler from Last Year) I would absolutely love it.
---
Its also the most vicious troll build and counter to pre-nerf nurses. 4x no mither sabo and a rainbow map tears 110 and below movement speed killers a new one. 
---
I had a game where I downed an ace and david in the very corner of the map after they dropped hooked. theyd crawl away and when id go for a new chase they drop those hooks again or hooks in other areas. I still won but it got reallllllllllly dirty.
---
I remember loading into a game against plague when I had iron will, self care, botany knowledge. I was sad. The end.
---
Well, the Rift has Killer-only challenges, so that's also skewing the info, but yeah, I wish WGLF did something in-game to make it more viable.
---
The only OP Killer left is Beads Spirit, though.
---
That might be true, but then if that’s the case, there is nothing the devs can do to change the mentality of players who lack empathy. What needs to change is the community outlook and emphasizing fun over 4k/escaping.
---
Yes sir
---
Totally deserved. Don't be an asshole, just leave.
---
sarcasm I hope?
---
I meant using it with PWYF could be really good
---
Just played a couple games with my buddy and the games we had were: Spirit, Spirit, Spirit, Freddy on The Game and a Nurse. Yeah, we did not have a good evening tho.
---
honestly, its a cool idea and all, but you'd instantly know what killer it is based on tr. kinda ruins the 'surprise', imo
---
This.
---
Flashlights require strict timing but have more chances.
---
Pallets require specific possitioning but always work (preferably by canceling the pickup)
---
It just makes sense. It's how it works in Identity V and it feels WAY better
---
Run doctor, take distressing, unnerving presence, and take the two highest calm series addons. BOOM might as well be map wide. Iridescent button is also map wide but the other effect is the only thing it’s good for
---
400 iq
---
True but you didnt really specify its purely your opinion. If its your opinion thats ok but you are still wrong.
---
Triple jump would be really fun for looping builds
---
If that isn't love, I don't know what love is. 
---
&lt;/weird al&gt;
---
You can also let survivors bleed out.  The hook isn't the only way to make survivors go away.
---
Must be nice, I'm at rank 13.  At this rate, I will never reach rank 1 before next reset due to waiting for lobbies.  Which is a bit ironic considering how so many people want to avoid red ranks
---
I think it would be better to have facehuggers and chestburtsters be the hook mechanic so you could make the Xenomorph’s mori be where it stabs the survivor with its tail, then throws them down and headbites them. That would be sick
---
Yeah the text will have a period but he won’t pause at all. It feels so wrong...
---
idk m8 literally everyone was angry and making fun of the devs because they delayed it once, probably why they didnt delay it again
---
Best no0b3 video period lol
---
Hope all you want, nerd.
---
Maybe if you guys didn’t fall on the sword for this guy so hard core and not have acted like dickheads from a previous post I wouldn’t be his way! But since you all act the same about this guy screw y’all and him!
---
There are videos by noob3 and puppers telling you diff flashlights and timings. Eg. if using purple flashlight, shine only when the survivor is hoisted up and touches the killer’s shoulder.
---
That’s just like .... your opinion, man
---
I've seen killers lie about farming but this is the first time I hear of survivors lying about farming.
---
Which is kinda weird considering they're the ones that benefit the most from farming...
---
This is nothing.
---
Wait until 3 people leave a solo player to die on 1 hook, and then all DC because you didn't let them save.
---
Oh really? I was under the impression that the only killers that really benefit from Discordance are the phasing ones.
---
Please make him male for cough cough reasons.
---
who the fuck cares if the community wants it rushed? EVERYBODY knew they werent ready to be released, including the devs. They werent going to lose players for wanting to properly finish a product before releasing it.
---
You shouldn’t have the right to blast all this bs OTz spam memes all over a subreddit about a video game, yah he plays it, but every other post has been nothing but this guy and keeps getting worst and many others have said the same thing!
---
they are just bad survivors. if they know they are playing hag they should crouch when unhooking. flashlights also destroy traps
---
Yea we all been knew about the tells... old news.. what I’m saying is despite the tells there’s next to nothing you can do. If you’re at a pallet and she stands there you also just stand there, when she eventually phases you can either run away creating scratch marks for her to see and appear beside you and kill you, stay there so she can just get an easy hit, throw the pallet down but the odds are she was going around anyways, walk always slowly but if you’re injured she can hear you and by the time she walked around the loop and comes out of phase you’re a whole 3 steps away... so yea there’s no outplay it’s like if you’re on a gen and the killer traps you in a corner(we all know which types of gens I’m talking about) or you’re doing a totem and they trap you you can’t do anything but take a hit... that’s exactly what it’s like. Also what is wrong with you.. this post didn’t directly attack you or say anything about you, not once did I say you’re a shitty human being or anything this was a general post about my opinion on Spirit yet you, of your own free will and choice, come here and start getting upset and rude... no ones forcing you to reply, see this, or engage but here you are “you’re not actually red ranks” “drag your team down with you” like just because you have the “im not like other girls” mentality and enjoy playing against Spirit doesn’t mean everyone else feels the same, your opinion isn’t law your experiences aren’t universal and your beliefs aren’t fact, get over yourself. You could continue to have a discussion with me if that’s what you please but don’t start getting toxic and rude, because I’m not featuring that. Why don’t you have a little bread and maybe you’ll calm down. Thank you.
---
This was my same idea. Good job
---
You can see my perks.
---
How soon are the level two archive challenges supposed to be available? Finished the first and I'm already itching to be able to progress in the rift faster and get more lore unlocked
---
As a killer you should try and not camp the hook or tunnel people off hook. But really there are limits to this, playing the perfect hook everyone 3 times thing usually means you lose. 
---
Also your Hag, she camps its what she does. Id just accept that
---
They are going to hate on you and be shitty to you whether you are nice or not a good half the time. So just play to win and fuck what they say.
---
She’s mainly who I play and I do agree when people say that you should cleanse in certain situations. Try to cleanse towards the end when theirs 1 or 2 gens. Make her waste precious time by getting corrupt purge. And if she does get it, if you can try to go where there walls or go indoors cause it’s difficult turning the corrupt purge through corners. She’s definitely not the strongest killer without corrupt in loops but what I do is I try to infect survivors and then go for them later on where their not in a good position.
---
That's what I was telling my friend when this happened LOL
---
here is the joke
---
laugh
---
I know she’s still with base but I mean like on screen beginning to end she’s like 3rd I think..? You could be completely right though, I won’t claim to know anything about their strategy so im not saying they aren’t going in order I just figured they wouldn’t be but who knows
---
On Hag especially you're not responsible for folks stepping into your traps. They should know it's you, they know they shouldn't run, and if a recently-hooked survivor pops a trap and you smack whoever's in front of you, it's on them.
---
They don't want to adjust against Hag. They want to make you an M1 killer again. Might as well not use your power if there are so many restrictions on it.
---
I was playing as killer on xbox last night and this survivor was running super fast around the map the whole time. Is there a speed hack or some sort of exploit I don't know about?
---
DC tags that only match you up against other DC players, and those Dedicated DC matches earn no BPS for other player DCing. You get tagged as a DCer by some law of avg, 2-3x a day, 2-3x for every 4-5 hours of game time (some arbitrary amount). If you pay long enough without DCing, you can lose your yeah and join normal games again
---
From both the killer that knows you're here and the survivor on the hook you're swarming, you're not helping your friend, fuck off.
---
Peak-a-boooooo
---
I'm on console and when I play spirit it is literally the easiest 4k and merciless win ever. You don't even need to use add ins and shes still WAY to easy to play, I main survivor and when I go against her I already know I'm not escaping because she doesn't take very much skill at all and shes a difficulty "hard" killer. Nurse is op and she takes time to learn how to use but spirit... spirit is way too easy to play.
---
"the kids at school bully me because of my christmas sweater but mommy said im a handsome boy"
---
Yea, I mean it seems obvious but I realized I could curb some bad behavior but leaning into his strategy a bit.
---
If they give us pyramid head he better be better than fucking nurse.
---
I want his M2 to be destroy vaults like pallets or something godlike....
---
I'm gonna need him to rip someone's skin off movie style for the mori as well!
---
&gt;Actually, you are because its your objective to chase and hook survivors. If you are just defending generators, you are doing what peanits said in my understanding.
---
Wrong. Your goal is to stop the survivors from escaping the trial. Defending generators is actively preventing their escape. They can always bleed out from being slugged.
---
First of all no one will want as killer to go against sweaty SWF, double of 0 still 0 so getting 20k(40k) but 0 satisfaction of 2k is not worth 30k with 3/4K second you want to deny at all SWF if it isn’t in that Q? If not they can still Q as duo etc, what about 3 SWF? How do you get the 4th surv? So many things don’t make sense here.
---
Its ironic because people on here use to struggle to play her and always asked for tips.
---
She cant be that easy to play because many low rank spirits are garbage and get looped endlessly. Billy is far easier to play and can be far stronger. I see more billys dominate games than spirits. What im saying is its not like you pick up spirit and you’re guaranteed to win.
---
Ive faced a number recently and I’m able to hold my own for quite a while. Once you have experience as survivor and spirit, you can predict what the spirit will do next and what they think you’re going to do next. The ones ive faced dont exactly stomp a team, only killers that do tend to be Billy and old nurse.
---
Having said that, I do agree she is overused.
---
Survivors dont like a killer who can get them at a pallet. Thats why they hated nurse too. Theres no safety net.
---
However consider what its like for a big standard m1 killer, who cant do shit at safe pallets but follow the survivor around knowing full well that unless that survivor makes a mistake, they’re never going to get hit.
---
Its easy to see why people are choosing spirit. Shes not as tiring to use as Nurse but has a good opportunity to hit survivors. Survivors cry spirit has no counterplay and its just 50/50, but how does a killer feel with all the safe pallets in the game? Theres no mindgame for them and no counter play.
---
Why just nerf spirit? Why not buff the shit killers, and balance some of the god loops in the game to make other killers fun to play too.
---
Nobody enjoys picking a bottom tier killer, having no chance at hit a survivor at one od the many safe pallets or good loops, and gets stunned and then has to watch some toxic little scroat does his butt dance. So instead they pick a killer who has an equal chance of getting a hit.
---
The worst are the ones that are literally just a blank template (Ex. the Stranger Things girl with a whiteboard). Like what is even the point aside from karma whoring?
---
Only the finest Scottish comedy for my sub par memes
---
sounds decent to me
---
Ho Li Fuk
---
Lol I feel like dbd is like that bad boyfriend/girlfriend who treats you like sh*t, etc but I keep coming back for more because "maybe this time it'll be different" or "they're not always like this." -_-
---
You need to be able to crawl on walls and ceilings undetected.
---
She used to be very good. Her addons were the problem in my opinion. The nerf is over the top. Yes, insane nurse can still make her work but thats about it. She was high skill high reward and theyve increased the skill gap and lowered the reward.
---
Otz isn’t that wholesome, he just actually has a bit of patience and restraint and doesn’t fly off the handle. He berates survivors quite often.
---
I'm Rank 2 but that's because I've been playing with Trapper I could have made one if I only play with my spirit
---
She got shafted lmao
---
Funeral suit please
---
Don’t Dead Hard Dedicated Servers
---
They could if they would just use cloud saves. I dont think cloud saves from cross platforms exist except for destiny.
---
Cause that’s an infinite with a 150 now with a 110, probably new player.
---
Won’t you get banned?
---
Yea that’s what I’m banking on. And I wasn’t even trying to start an argument over Spirit I was simply saying when the surge of Spirits come it’s not gonna be fun but people came here and started getting upset 🙃
---
This is all I see with ghostface now. It sucks because I dont play him that way and he is possibly my favorite killer to play. I took a break between the time he came out and demo came out and I'm just thinking wtf happened?
---
no. BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why we recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons.
---
Ive been able to play 2 out of 7 games. And during queues I have been able to clean my kitchen.
---
clearly not an og player, the real ones can get their whole leg out before exiting.
---
30-60 minutes because everyone wants that easy BP :P
---
They get so "mad" because it produces this kind of reaction in you. They didn't like the outcome of the game and wanted to lash out. You made yourself available for it. There were alternatives.
---
What rank are you that you have long queues as killer on PS4? I find matches almost instantly being rank 8ish
---
Theres not a single space ship on that list but a cheetah is lol
---
I saw it on a certain... *cough* artwork...  *cough* community... before Otz used it
---
The biggest "problem" on Spirit is how easily she can cut loops and chases short and there's no counterplay for her phasing unless you have Iron Will. Her phasing is also often used as the common "mindgame", we all know how that works. So you're basically becoming a skilled killer just by standing still at a pallet or sometimes even the killer shack. And if you were to buff other killers, it would make their concept shit. Nobody complains about weaker killers, except for Trapper since he really really needs a buff, they're all fun if you know how to play them and when you say you run into many shit Spirits on low ranks, then you haven't experienced the red ranks with her. They might be shit as well, but they at least have a bit more common game sense and can adapt to survivors' playstyle unless someone who is rather new to the game.
---

How long is successful attack cooldown? I want to understand how much time does Save the best for last saves, but can't find any info on basic or 8 stack attack cooldowns.
---
Tier 2 comes out the 13th. It's two weeks between each tier
---
I hate to be that asshole but I ran Bubba with NOED and just slugged a survivor as the gens ended and then opened the gates and hook camped like a twat. I felt terrible and that's the only kill I even went for because I knew what I was about to do was scummy XD
---
13th now :p
---
This is so cool uwu
---
I am aware of that but still, I don’t even have the ability to get so mad that I want to lash out at someone over anything that happens in a game, complaining about it? Sure, but telling someone to die is going overboard
---
Damn I made a post about this right after the Archives dropped. Should've went with a meme...
---
THANK YOU! ❤️
---
Yall know if you disturb the birds on the swamp house or boat....you get the rift challenge instantly
---
I wish it was always like this.
---
Wh... Who the fuck ever said that?
---
Discordance gives you a whole lot of information every time it pops, and technically even when it isnt.
---
If discordance is on then you know where at least 2 people are. If you know where even 1 other person is (say you're in chase) you likely now know where everyone is. The moment discordance goes off it tells you one or both of those guys are likely coming for the unhook and you can cut them off.
---
Or if it's a gen you are trying to protect it can tell you to drop chase and go there, or if it pops at the beginning it gives you direction, or if you run it with pop goes the weasel it often tells you what gen to use pop on, the uses are endless.
---
Yes some killers such as Billy or nurse may capitalize a bit more on it due to their mobility, but that information is vital even if you dont have time to commit to protecting the gen.
---
&gt;She was already bad
---
You're playing on console I assume? The nerf was way over the top that goes without saying, but I do think that people are over-exaggerating how bad she is now. 
---
Good Nurses still stomp games. And I think that most of the people complaining that she's useless after her changes weren't very good with her *before* the changes.
---
Soooo. Would you drink from it?
---
thank you
---
Dunno about this third party, but you're handling this the wrong way. &lt;shrug&gt; Anyway, good luck.
---
Good evening he said!
---
Shes still the best killer in the game, she just actually has some limits when using her power
---
they would be able to do pinhead easy they can make him a little like Freddy
---
He never DCs. That was just in one video trying to use Monstrous Shrine. The survivor still Kobe'd off basement hook so he DC'd. But at that point, there were only 2 survivors alive. He was right in their face when they unhooked. So they lost the game at that point.
---
Him DC'ing literally costed only him points. Those guys kept the points. So if you really watched the video and was still asking about the nature of the DC, it probably just made you look like an asshole.
---
I have no idea what you mean by handling but alright
---
&gt;As someone who bought the game it is their right to do with it as they wish.  
---
&gt;This includes DCing
---
End-User License Agreement
---
I don't understand, was Ghostface ever even thought to be weak? He's always been pretty decent, buggy as he may be.
---
Really good analogy actually ! 
---
Oh :( it feels bad that you had to do it to enjoy the game a little bit more. They are some great guy around actually congratulating you for playing well, but it’s 1 guy over thousands so yeah I understand why you did it.
---
She used to be the Best yes, In the right hands she is still the best, I’ve gone against 2 nurses since the rework and our team was floored in 3 minutes 5 gens. Thing is to just adapt and change your play style.
---
Well i think the lesson here is to run borrowed time kids. time saves lives
---
There should be an option to play like this in custom game
---
Yeah what I’m kind of trying to say too
---
maybe bhvr is trying to teach u responsibility
---
where was this information and why didn't i know this sooner?
---
this is so cool
---
Honestly when i kill i did use to main spirit and i do think she needs some changes ( nothing drastic . For example no collision,injured sound being non directional and maybe a vaulting animation. Oh and just change prayer beads for crying out loud) . Although I didnt stop playing her becuase of the complaints I just forgot about her. Anyway people get upset when someone complains about spirit becusse we saw what happened to legion and we dont need another gutted killer
---
Not a hag main but I've had some pretty good games trapping gens. You can pull survivors off the gen bc they won't know theyve triggered a trap. However if youre at higher ranks survivors will probably catch on and start crouch walking to gens. Otherwise trapping a loop is also a good idea, they wont know when theyve triggered the trap and you can use that to mindgame. Otherwise it's not really useful if they trigger a trap at loops if youre not actively chasing them.
---
Rusty shackles also has good synergy with mint rag, you can teleport to any trap on the map. Ive played protect the totem with thrill ofthe hunt and pulled a couple people off.
---
fact
---
If you threw this on Etsy or something I would totally pay 20 bucks for one of these
---
Base is about 2.8 seconds on successful hit
---
Fuck that, there's a difference between making us play the original and free killers and making us have to play DLC killers we don't have. I don't give a damn about playing against a Spirit, but the free content will be locked by DLC, when there's already a section of this content being locked by a battle pass? Fuck that.

But if the survivors are good they will 99 a gate so that the timer doesn’t start and when everyone is safe or there that’s when EGC starts but for this you have to open it, and then still mess around all before the timer hits 0.
---
I know theres been some instances of survivors having permanent sprint burst after some kind of interaction from the killer. Definitely a bug, but from seeing all the videos, can't say for certain what triggers it
---
Keys and mories are on the same level of annoying/boring for me. Alot of the changes you mentioned to survs were needed but I agree with you on some thibgs( like MOM . God that perk didnt diserve that). In any case we better stop before killers that dont play survivor come here to downvote us
---
It should last till November 10th
---
Substance Scanner seems like Bloodhound. Nice Night For A Walk seems like the old version of Predator.
---
OoOo, I like all of these, they're all good! and aren't overpowered or underpowered, very welldone! Even as a survivor main the traped totem seems like a fun one, you'll see it and joke to your friends like "watch this explode and twat me in the head"- and then it does lol

I should probably do that.  Especially because even when I escape from NOED-reliant killers, I'll usually depip.  I remember doing gens and never even getting into chase with a Bubba once because he was so bad, he couldn't get close enough to initiate.  So I "chased" him for several gens but got no points for it.  Then he facecamped my teammate to death with NOED.  I would much rather this not be a possible playstyle in the game, but I guess next best is to do totems for points and to punish bad behavior along the way.
---
November 12 or something
---
For stealthy use spine chill so you can urban away early and have a counter for stealthy killers
---
Substance scanner is kinda a carbon copy of bloodhound from the wraith
---
They touched upon that a bit in the stream I think. But also to be fair you can get Spirit for shards so technically you don’t have to pay money...
---
I'm pretty sure it was Monto that first called her vommy Mommy
---
I usually enjoy playing against plague ... unless I've just eaten. I think it's kinda fun trying to stay healthy for as long as possible during the chase. She can also make for some tense moments when the corrupt purge gets involved. One time I had a plague after me with the corrupt purge, and I was injured. She's too close, no walled structures to save me. I see my life flash before my eyes. Just as I'm sure I'm about to die, I feel a great power well up inside me. Is this ... ultra instinct. Right as she finishes charging it I 180 towards her, and go into a wild 360. She spins around to match me. I duck. She overshoots. She spins back towards me, I reverse directions, dead harding through the last of the purge and making it to a pallet. That was one of my finest moments. Maybe I'm a little bias towards plague after having a few great moments playing against her, but then again it's because of the way she's designed that I was able to have those experiences.  
---
Sometimes I'm a bit disgruntled when I load in against a plague and I'm trying to do a healing/stealth build for fun, but that kind thing adds variety to the game. I find the strategic choices you get to make as survivor are meaningful, and the mechanics are reasonably consistent and fair. Because the plague builds up momentum either through making everyone broken, or by gaining access to the corrupt purge, I find that the mid-endgame with plague is often tense. I think part of the reason I like her is that I play mostly solo queue survivor, and she is just in a solid spot balance wise to play against for solo queue red rank matches. She is usually right in the middle of most tier lists. Not too weak to see play, but not overbearing against solo queue players. This tends to make matches close, and I often see the tide of a match swing greatly off of singular good plays.

she could be in mid phase and hear either your breathing or see the grass moving; you are not silent even uninjured
---
she can also just literally collide with you by accident lmfao
---
honestly the only counter is going to the spirit player’s house and vandalizing their headphones
---
Bro, let them. I’ll make more memes just to spite them if I have to. Already have some in mind tbh. 😆
---
I love this style. It looks great.
---
That would be like having Leprechaun, but he could again use magic and levitate the survivor I guess.
---
Recently I have been getting into killer matches immediately but have had to wait a couple minutes to get in survivor matches.
---
Conveniently forget that I said your teammates aren’t going to have fun :/
---
I love doing this to people :)
---
Play PC lol killer ques are faster than survivor now
---
It's 1.5k points either way. Why do they owe you the points instead of using the perk and getting the points for themselves?
---
You don't have to read it, but if you break it they can ban you... so... you're still wrong.
---
I like going against Mikey. Unless he only pops tier 3 on me. Then I get sad.
---
Ok got pop tje weasel from the shrine and ive gone through 20 bloodwebs and still don't have it. Im not complaining im just waiting. Probably gonna be another 50 webs for me.
---
Yes, but if you don't play the game everyday, or if you take long breaks from the game, or if you're a new player, the shards option isn't exactly in your favor.
---
Yeah I was trying to think of one. Maybe something like “The Survivor will gain a temporary speed boost”
---
I do, but just a lil one!!! OINK!
---
Yea this is definitely swf challenge
---
I agree spirit is annoyingly easy, the worst feeling is being hit by noed when you’re about to escape a baby spirit. Feels so cheap 😤
---
You can still get her from shards so yea it’s not base game but you don’t have to spend money to unlock her
---
I'm genuinely proud that I managed to farm about 50 Will o Wisps and about 30 Lunchboxes
---
I read the 13th.
---
Thanks I kinda joked about the “cursed” part but I do enjoy the idea of perks that come with upsides and downsides; it can make for more varied and interesting gameplay. :)
---
You've got to understand that there's 4 of them and only 1 of you, so if sacrifices need to be made for the majority to have fun, well my friend you are the minority.
---
Guns??? Hahahahahahaha! No thanks.
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
F
---
That’s true, fair point
---
Thats weird. When I queue up as killer it takes me 15-20 minutes, as a survivor it takes me roughly 3 minutes. Im a new player, rank 17 killer so that might be a problem. I hope that when I rank up into the ~13 ranks the queues become shorter.
---
If theres no hex ruin then there is an extreme possibility of haunted grounds. This perk basically exposes all survivors when cleansed. Being exposed means everyone is one shot (basically michael stage 3). Yeah, it could be devour hope or something but unless you know for a fact it's better to leave it alone. Haunted is a spirit perk so if theres no ruin and a spirit then it's safe to assume its haunted grounds.
---
If you go after this logic, you can apply this to survivors as well, it's not fun to repeatedly go against the same killer over and over again, it's repetitive and simply boring and not fun. Plus, I can't think of a single map with this many safe pallets, it just sounds like old Blood Lodge, but this has been emptied out so hard. There are many killers you can have fun with and still get kills, like I said, it's just the way you play them. 
---
Killers can easily avoid survivors' gimmicks such as pallets and windows by picking up Spirit since she can outplay these things without any effort. Survivors on the other hand can't do that, mostly because of not knowing who they will go against, they can only guess to go against a Spirit.
---
I guess most of us dont like console because the community was built on pc. Then all of a sudden these 14 yearolds got their hands on it and started bitching about everything. They released the game when many of its bugs and glitches still needed to be fix; now their resources are split between 5 different areas.  Anyway back to the point. I think certain aspects of spirit need changed like addons. And maybe her base kit. Fathers glass suck imo but prayer beads are broken. Builds like gen grabber spirit are insanely fun to play but not fun to play against. They need to find a happy medium. The sword thing is also kinda crazy. You go so far so fast that survivors don't have any chance against you.
---
&gt;So you get a kick out of denying other survivors altruism points
---
No, I get a kick out of earning 1.5k survival points for myself. It's also not my fault if teammates play stupid and rush to the hook right away.
---
I don't even run Deliverance except maybe like one night a month, but I genuinely don't understand all the hate survivors give to other survivors that Deliverance off the hook.
---
Yeah, man...I've seen this posted like 4 times today. LOL!
---
OINK!
---
Ah. And you can’t forget the good ole “if you kill 3 people and the 4th person gets away via hatch, then you still lose and all the survivors win.” 
---
Shame on you for playing Spirit. Reported. Enjoy your ban. Go [Redacted] 
---
/s (just in case you can’t tell)
---
Well that doesn't make sense because if I am to assume that I am spending my own money then its contradicting because you had to grind to earn that money so essentially I earned the fruit naturally.
---
I feel like the general concensus was that he was weak. He's not a killer I see often anymore. A lot of people bring up the fact that getting him out of stalk is buggy to say the least but I've had no problem with that whatsoever. Myers is still the better stealth killer when it comes to stalking power but the way tru3 uses ghostface it seems like a 4k is guaranteed.
---
Solid work!!!!
---
Oh yeah, forgot to mention NOED, that's another point of course.
---
Idk if you know, but dead by daylight doesn’t have voice chat. Idk if u mean that, or you mean sending party invites though.
---
That’s because same thing applies... should I force myself to not have fun for them..? Also a hefty majority of survivors don’t have fun against Spirits anyways and they either DC or give up on first hook so they already weren’t enjoying it. Besides I’m just getting them closer to hatch 🤷‍♂️.
---
Yeah, it's a bug. Though, I haven't seen the bug remain after throwing down a pallet or when you stop running before, so?
---
What if it was similar to the saw pig, the xeno has to put the facehugger on your as your on the hook, when your off you have to find something to remove it or else it impregnates you. if so you die from chest burst!
---
*boop*
---
Hard Target + Object of Obsession = infinite knowledge.
---
God I love it when Vommy Mommy bathes me. UwU
---
why you get triggered by this? is a fcking game brah, enjoy it.
---
The circlejerk against him is trash
---
Use Surveillance as your fourth perk. On Freddy, it is a godly combo with Pop and synergizes so well with his gen teleportation. Hook a survivor, see which gen is being worked on with BBQ, teleport, kick with Pop active, and surveillance lets you know when a survivor hops back on. It’s very effective.
---
I prefer Surveillance to Discordance because you’ll get more use out of it, provided you keep kicking gens. It’s unavoidable. Smart survivors will be able to figure out when you have Discordance and will stop working gens together for the most part, but there’s not a good work around for Surveillance as available gens dwindle.
---
Ok I think this guy had dead hard, dude was zooming lol. Hope they can find a fix for it soon.
---
He’s faster when cloaked but otherwise he’s just as fast as the trapper
---
I would just ignore him if he didn't have such a pull on the impact on the development on the game.
---
He is when he's uncloaked
---
O I N K
---
😆 dkm
---
His gameplay vids are full games from his streams idk why your so salty he even has edited vids too on his main channel, he just noticed his player base likes his unedited gameplay more
---
"Nice tunnel" INDEED. IT WAS.
---
They already have the terminator as a skin in DG
---
Never t-bag at the exit gates. You don't know when you can avoid the bloodwarden.
---
Bruh I can loop trapper or clown around the fallen down silo with the infinite wraith catches up to me and no I'm not talking about him being cloaked either
---
yes he is only when he is not using his power tho
---
Epic broseph
---
You talking out of cloak? If so he probably seems faster since Wraith has legs so long they make models jealous, which makes him taller, and a shorter killer who we'd think be faster like Legion is the same speed. 
---
In cloak he is definitely faster. That's part of his power.
---
Ah, well atleast we'll get it without pass next year then.
---
More? It's better if less were, it wasn't fun playing level 1 trapper at purple/red ranks
---
Yup, Xbox! Have this happen quite often. Total bs
---
you're gen-tapping w/ruin, no
---
Why can't I view this community?
---
Does it even exist?
---
Do I exist?
---
yes
---
I didn't know calling you stupid took effort on my part, just because you type a paragraph doesn't make your point any better. If you need to run empathy to follow a survivor you unhooked to heal them, maybe you shouldn't be unhooking survivors. 
---
P.S.: not once did I call OP toxic, so take a chill pill and double check who's jumping through hoops.
---
Dwight's reminds me of a few 'ugly Christmas' sweaters, but if I had the opportunity I'd wear that all winter!
---
Dude I can loop trapper or clown around the ripped over silo in coldwind 3 times using that one window but not wraith and of course I'm talking about uncloaked
---
I've got a fun build: sprint burst, spine chill, lightweight, iron will. The idea is to work on a gen somewhere that has line of sight blockers, then vanish by the time the killer gets there.  
---
How it works: The spine chill gives you early warning that the killer is coming (36 m), even if they have a reduced terror radius. Scratch marks last 10 seconds by default, but on most textures are usually indistinguishable after \~7 seconds. With lightweight they can be gone as soon as 4 seconds. Most killers take 7.83 seconds to travel the full distance of spine chills detection range. When the killer gets there they know the gen was being worked on, but they don't see scratch marks so they figure you are still there. They usually search the area, start checking lockers, the works. Meanwhile you are behind a rock 20-30 m away grinning like a fool. You only need spine chill and lightweight to make it work, but sprint burst can get you more distance, and iron will lets you do this more consistently while injured. If you really want to have some laughs take the pebble (diversion), and just after the killer leaves, you throw the pebble at the gen.
---
Yeah, I’m aware we played like shit near the end especially with the guy with the most skills bailing but I’m trying to focus on the rage being childish, trust me, I hate myself just as much as this dude for that but I’m focusing on how I wish we could be better with salt
---
I know all that but what I forgot to mention is that the killer placed like 3 traps around the hook as well and I’m not kidding when I say I was doing a pure background support build. Sadly, it seems the other guy was doing so as well based the perks that popped up in the endgame, he had the same perks as me, but he seemed confident he could do it so I just waited around for them needing any support but then yet again nothing happened so I just stayed behind the tree waiting to see the icons change so I would know wether to take action or not
---
There was just really poor communication in this group
---
They all got wigs. It’s why they occasionally go bald.
---
Not really, but nothing really is
---
oh fuck. Atleast both are correct
---
Yall getting triggered by stupid pixels doing squats in front your face?! and then whine about it? lets better talk about weak ppl that cant handle dumb shit like this. If u cant handle this (which is stupidly dumb) i got bad news for u in life
---
That's because you came a year after dbd was released on console! Its was a hellish nightmare at first. 10% is a large number. Of the what 70 something perks in the game? I do think something needs to be changed i just don't know what aside from addons.
---
I swear to the entity that if you buy it from the shrine it doesnt show up for like 30 levels.
---
There are a lot of bad matches, but then there are good ones too. The great matches are fun enough that I'm willing to sit through a lot of bad ones.
---
@ my fellow survivor mains: don't do that. Don't teabag. And if you see a teabagger, please flame the shit out of them. Thanks.
---
I posted this before editing. Sorry. I had this on my clipboard, but updated it in a text document. It's now updated.
---
The health state obviously lasts for more than a couple of seconds, and Adrenaline can come in clutch in a multitude of situations even outside of chases, such as being slugged and it healing you up again, or healing you on a hook, and it excels when used in an SWF environment where you can coordinate the timing of its activation... but I agree. Adrenaline is often seen as the best survivor perk in the game, and I think that's a stark overrating. I think it is much more important to get to the end game in the first place, than to have perks that can potentially come in clutch once there. Adrenaline being as impactful as people make it out to be is very situational - much of the time at best you get a health state out of it, while being put into Exhausted state, taking your Exhaustion perk away for much of the end game. Such that Adrenaline can even be to your detriment, if you get into a chase after it procs. Especially of course against NOED. And if we do talk end game perks, Hope is the underrated Adrenaline counterpart.
---
Play With Your Food and Object Of Obsession are probably the most underrated perks in the game, since both are actually kinda OP (even after the indirect Object nerf that is the Undetectable status effect), yet most people sleep on them.
---
Thats what you call the power of clutch perks
---
Oh yeah. The dude with the finger fetish.
---
That's... kind of the Terminator's thing...
---
In brackwater swamp yes
---
If they start doing real ones, Zodiac and Texarkana Phantom would be cool too.
---
Let me start by saying, I'm not the same person you've been talking with in this chain.
---
I think the person you're talking to isn't referring to finding someone with empathy *after* they've been hooked, but using it to find them ***before they've been hooked*** (AKA while they're still in a chase).
---
When using empathy as part of a hook farming build survivors play somewhat along these lines:
---
1. See survivor that got hit
---
2. Immediately stop working your gen and follow them around in a chase
---
3. Wait for them to go down and hide super close to hook to make sure none of your teammates can possibly beat you to the hook
---
4. Rush the hook to secure your points (or Archive objective)
---
Obviously there are other, legitimate uses for Empathy and someone running Empathy doesn't mean they're farming, but it actually is a really good perk to run if you're trying to farm unhooks like it's your job.
---
Going off of the Day of the Dead look and cultural history. It's a mantilla, not a hijab or dupatta.
---
It cannot be used with that perk. I put that in parenthesis.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Yup, you're correct. That actually already occurred to me. Now mind you, level 1 Empathy isn't very good for that purpose, since you're probably too close for it to matter. But, the point stands; Empathy actually *is* an unhooking perk!
---
But, considering that Bhikari never pointed out this obvious fact, that doesn't really change my argument that they have seem to have no idea what they're talking about, and are just trying to justify their nasty assumption.
---
Oh 
---
No offense to female Muslims and mantilla users
---
Financially fuck yeah mate. Sorry but you’re wrong.
---
idk it seems like a fun video. I’ll check your channel later.
---
Insidious in gf? What a waste of perk slot, yeah i've seen some gf who camp for stalks and can be optimal but just not fun
---
The only things I can think of are either:
---
A: you accidentally didn’t start the challenge (make sure you did)
---
B: you let go of the button before the kick finished so it didn’t register
---
C: the game is bugged (most likely).
---
Reguardless I would be pleased to just know if a effort was put forth or not or they just said good enough. The music is the only remaining piece that would capture the atmosphere.
---
Wait what
---
The original list was my original one. I revised it, but forgot to copy it to the clipboard. Fixed now :)
---
For some reason it just works. No stain and terror radius while being able to hit people without having to go through an animation first is better than wraith imo. His ability to crouch just makes it all the better
---
I find spirit to have a good power, BUT there is little to no consistent counterplay, other than just hoping that they are or aren’t phasing,  land Iron will isn’t an actual counter, it’s a perk, and having to bring a perk every game just to counter spirit is not fun
---
It's not technically dodging if the game is loading dude. The word you were looking for it quitting lol. And it's sad you won't even play the game when the killer uses Mori. Players like you make this game the toxic five nights at freddies cess pool it's become.
---
Right, I do that too whether I admit it or not, but I have never and will never tell someone to kill themselves based off a game
---
We did play shitty near the end and we did communicate poorly but in our defense, as soon as the first guy left (he was higher rank and had at least 100 hours, the rest of us were pure rank 15 with between 30 and 50 hours, me being right over 50, with that little experience it’s a bit hard to do anything besides what you intended with your build. And sadly the two of us were pure support builds (I checked our perks and both of us had perks only specifically for being medics, I chose to be the backup medic)
---
We have Dance With Me in the shrine what
---
If you dislike something what are you doing to mitigate it? Whine? Doesn't help. Slam out gens while the killer wastes his game standing next to a hook. There's your answer.
---
Same thing for killers, if a survivor is doing something you don't like, say looping the shit out of you with balanced landing on haddonfield, go chase someone else and let this survivor either waste their time camping the house or move into a less advantageous position for you to catch them at.
---
That's the shrine right now.
---
Why is everyone having a different shrine than me ahhhh
---
Nah not the ones you mentioned, but got autohaven 3 times in a row just now. And the cornfield map twice in a row.
---
Are you telling me it's not Ruin, Thanato, DWM and StakeOut
---
Yup,  you're correct. That actually already occurred to me. Now mind you,  level 1 Empathy isn't very good for that purpose, since you're probably  too close for it to matter. But, the point stands; Empathy actually *is* an unhooking perk!
---
But, considering that Bhikari never pointed out this obvious fact, that  doesn't really change my argument that they have seem to have no idea  what they're talking about, and are just trying to justify their nasty  assumption.
---
\[copied from an adjacent reply\]
---
Had he recently uncloaked? He moves at 250ish% speed for a second, which lets him catch up and start closer than those two can. The other thing is possibly them using PWYF.
---
Do different consoles have different shrines wat
---
The biggest incentive should be "it's fun to play this role". Right now that's not the case (at least as solo)
---
The level 4 challenges look fun tbh
---
Lol That’s not me. I play trapper because I’m bad. Why get looped forever when I have a thing that makes them stay still. I haven’t used a Mori yet. I have the “last survivor” one but lets be honest, they are getting to the hatch or the door. And if I down them, whats the point of the Mori at that stage? Just BM?
---
...it would just work with Wraith as well. If both Wraith and Ghostface sneak up on someone they're both going to get a free hit. This makes no sense. The animation of Wraith is offset by the speed burst he gets out out invis.
---
You don’t have to lol. Just trying to reach my partner status but my average view count is like a 3 lol.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Are will o wisp better than the regular flashlight?
---
Check the news section ingame
---
That's what I'm saying. Unless it's different for each platform or something. I just checked it. I also bought bbq earlier this week so I could get the 150k bloodpoints.
---
Ohh, boo hoo, Mori bad, I want live.
---
Just deal with it, Mori is an offering like any other and dodging lobbys just screws over four other people.
---
I tip my cap to you fine sir. That’s way better!
---
If you can see them crouching around behind stuff hiding poorly, and/or standing out in the open pointing at you, that's how you know.
---
More than once...

Its not the initial hit, its the ability to activate his stealth with the snao of a finger during chase.

Dude I'm not a scrub I'm so aware of all of these thing I was the obsession he came out of cloak and hit me (so no bloodlust involved and he already lost speed boost I was also the first person he found) then I vaulted that window and he caught up to me in no time
---
So your basically asking to be downvoted
---
If you'd play him like that and try that with wraith youll notice a big difference.
---
I kinda hope it gets known -&gt; bhvr will have to hotfix it
---
No. They're just kind of a "limited edition" version of normal flashlights.
---
The only difference between them is that the Will'O Wisp has a orange coloured light that when shone on a surface shows a drawing of a "ghost".
---
I always get different maps. Multiple times in a role though without offerings.
---
Idk if it’s cuz I’m on console, but I’ll just like stand and signal “come here” then point out the exit gates like I want him to escape with me and be my pet killer.
---
Tea bags as thanks work too imo
---
Woah man, stop getting triggered by pixles on a screan that make words. Jeesh, people like you should really stay away from toxicity post. Leave the communication to to the people who can handle it. At least I can tell someone off withought telling them what to expect in their own life.
---
I have mentioned this here before, but imagine being able to grab them by the leg and drag them back in if not fully out. The animation exists already in Wraith's mori.
---
Exactly. I was wondering if she was truly bad or if I was just really garbage with her. Creeping and hitting people all match actually still ranks her up. But just enough to either not pip at all. If lucky, you might pip. But it's a very slow game at that point as well. And that's assuming you have ruin on that will last.
---
Lots of killers love playing m1 killers because even on safe loops you have a chance. If the survivor is better than you they'll win if you're better than the survivor you'll catch them. Obviously there's gonna be shit maps, it's impossible to make every map work well for every killer, but they're in the process of reworking maps to have more pallets that are less safe. On any of the new badham's or hawkins I love playing wraith, pig and trapper, at rank 5. The only people that hate playing m1 killers are the killers that aren't good enough for their rank, and they fall back on spirit. Spirit is so appealing because she's easy mode. Easy mode doesn't mean it takes no skill, it just means that it doesn't take as much skill as any other killer. If a spirit doesn't know how to play killer they'll lose, but if they know how to play killer they'll do way better than they deserve.
---
Moving on from a skill perspective here. Spirit simply isn't good for the health of the game. If a single killer is hated by so much of the community that many would rather dc than play that game there might need to be some changes. And if that killer is so commonly played that other players decide it's not worth playing the game anymore there's a big problem. This doesn't necessarily mean that the killer is very strong, merely that they aren't good for the game. A perfect example is old legion: Old legion wasn't a very strong killer, just heavily annoying. It took away the game aspect of it and made it a "just run until you drop" type match. This wasn't effective and legion often got only 1 kill but no one enjoyed it. That isn't good for game health. Spirit is running into the same issue, she's not fun to play and it's causing the community to dwindle. If she is widely regarded as unfun to play against by people that main both sides, then there's an issue regardless of actual strength and/or skill requirement.
---
Tome challenges. One of the last ones is to get a 4K.
---
Easy to expect that until November 13th when the second set of challenges drop. Probably more after, but who cares.
---
Just have fun and move to the next match.
---
Ez Pz
---
Hard.
---
Hold crouch and move camera up and down to nod.
---
If you have an item you can drop it in front of the killer as sign of peace/thanks from what I've seen.
---
As a killer main just being thanked through messages is enough to make my day tbh
---
You will have to grind it out. It seems like bbq is a gem to get in the bloodweb.
---
I’ve seen, still not feeling much of the concept overall unfortunately.
---
i dont think shes as bad as you think she isthe one thing im glad about with the cooldown is its right after you blink and not after your fatigue if it was after you fatigue then the nurse would equally as bad you say she is
---
Okay, I understand selfcare alone is pretty bad, but add botany and your team can be considerably more efficient, as you’ll heal about 12% slower than they’d heal you, but they can still do a gen
---
I got caught once at an exit teabagging.
---
Totally deserved that hook.
---
She is terrible. I mean I tried to make it work, but I'm sure the survivors weren't going as hard as they needed in the paint.
---
competitive doesn't mean unfun though, look at at games like r6 siege, if you die its your fault (most of the time) and that's what he wants, being able to punish bad plays. I think his view is fair imho, he plays both survivor and killer and explains as survivor what could/should be done, and that you want to balance games for top players first and the average player after, not appealing to people who get angry because billy's chainsaw injures people too much or ghostface etc
---
Thank you it helps a lot i want to get into drawing dead by daylight character’s
---
Now paint it!
---
Maybe I'm missing something but why is Monitor so good on Pig and Ghost Face? They can already completely get rid of their terror radius so isn't making the terror radius smaller redundant?
---
I didn’t mean two full bars, just two fragments cuz I almost had one (and it wasn’t my first game of the day)
---
Sometimes you have a kill daily - that's when I use the Cypress Mori.

Well I know she had a certain map pressure that I could use to my advantage even without add ons. Now she has lost that map pressure unless your on a small map like the doctor's map or the pigs map.
---
Really?! Thank god they got rid of that.
---
Me when I try to get some event items on the character I have all my stuff on
---
It's still the same for me, but I did hear it changed briefly on accident, maybe you saw the leaked version of this weeks?
---
You don't find that those limits hinder her in any way?
---
Okay hold on
---
I'm getting an Invader Zim vibe off this. I dig it.
---
Alright buddy
---
What does removing a Terror Radius in a chase do for you?
---
I’m devotion level 1 so far, most of my points go into stockpiling for Feng and trapper or getting other survivor’s and killer’s perks to ram into Feng’s and Trapper’s bloodwebs.
---
I only have a 48 or 50 Dwight, 25 or something Meg, 50+Feng and Trapper, 38 (or was it 40?) hag, 23 or so Doc, 3 huntress (or... was it 13... damn, can’t recall, I’ll go with 3 for now), and no one else has been given my bad touch. My trapper has the most perks of any survivor or killer so far with majority of them at level 3 (thank you, shrine, for the 3,000 shard price perks)
---
This hurts to know I must level an old man from a game I got the sequel of just to modify to hell and back via workshop addons on steam (Wario bloater and smoker shaggy with a princess peach witch and Blue Scout Ellis) if I want his perks I already have unlocked.
---
This is so true that I never, ever rescue the first hooked survivor anymore unless they're already a few meters away. Seems like every rando game I play is all altruism but I want to win.
---
Wait mobile doesn't have it? Or am I getting wooshed. Shit this is how it happens
---
Why would the free skin be pc exclusive?
---
This is peak irony
---
I drop an item in front of them if I have one on me
---
Yes this could work
---
It's simple my man, just subscribe to him. YouTube will gladly stop spamming your recommended tab with Otz videos and will also NOT notify you in your subscriptions tab. /s
---
Yea the worse your rank is the longer its gonna take as killer
---
Heard him on a podcast. Dude used to donate all the money he made from streaming to charity before he realized it could be a career.
---
Accurate.
---
that’s not really reliable. You have to be fully staring at her and not to mention it won’t work if she has any cosmetic with clothing on. If they just took away collision while phasing and nerfed prayer beads for Spirit I would feel like it’s a lot more fair while facing her
---
Can you imagine the ancestor narrating the chases and skill checks? "Mortallity clarified in a single strike!" "Patched up, if only to bleed again..."
---
I know resilience changes vault speed but does spine chill also? I didn't think it says vaulting in spine chills perk
---
As in it was given for free after it had been exclusive to pc for so long
---
Obsession Build: If you are running OoO, you shouldn't be running any stealth perks. They have a lot of antisynergy.
---
Stealthy: Iron Will makes it so you don't care if you are injured, but Fixated and Bond makes you want to heal. I would swap out either Iron Will or Fixated. Replacing Iron Will with Sprint Burst has synergy with Fixated and it'd make a fun "move faster" build.
---
Nancy: Aftercare makes you want to not be hooked at all costs, but Breakdown and Second Wind only work if you get unhooked (or does it also work if you unhook someone else?). Not to mention, running Empathy and Aftercare together is redundant. You could run perks that increase healing speed instead to synergize with Empathy and Second Wind. I'd suggest We'll Make It, Botany, or Pharmacy.
---
Adam: Breakdown and Deliverance seems like a fun antihook combo to run while Saboing hooks.
---
*mutters under breath in British*
---
Wth is waterlogged
---
Yeah, that's one of the problems, you never know what killer you'll get to go against next, you can just assume and bringing Iron Will every game could also be an unnecessarily wasted perk slot.
---
&gt;But, the point stands; Empathy actually is an unhooking perk!
---
I guess I'm supposed to be confused that you've switching to proving their point? But yes all 3 of us now agree that if you're farming unhooks, empathy helps facilitate that.
---
Same when I started the game
---
But... you’d also have to grind the money in this case?
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
(My shrine) [https://imgur.com/gallery/rgTUHxU]
---
Hey ho
---
I play on Xbox and saw YouTube Videos who survivor and killer had perks tier 4.
---
How is that obtainable?
---
Mori’s are a problem. However, i think looking at as “we lost insta heals so they need to lose something to make it fair” is kind of unhealthy. Let’s fix as many problems as we can on both sides because they are problems not to get even.
---
Yeah but I want to sit back and enjoy the lore, not feel like it's being rushed, especially when it ISN'T a tense part like all of trappers stuff so far
---
Immersion is more annoying than looping... Change my mind.
---
On PS4 it happens all the time to me, either I keep my points or lose them. Then this also happens, I keep my points and lose the item I was carrying or lose both, it’s really weird and it happens allot because people still DC like crazy or the game is booting them.
---
Yeah this game has a seriously addictive quality. I can rant about any number of things in the game (bugs, toxic players, long queues, unbalanced shit), but I’ll still go back and queue up the next match.
---
u/oshea5000 made this
---
The survivor cant know where you are. If you break line of sight while making a maneuvre to catch them by surprise you'd be surprised how effective it is. Also you dont have a red stain so you can spook them from behind corners and stuff.
---
Finally some viable spirit counters 🤪
---
Ty btw
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ds5hk5/why_did_i_do_this/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Bruh it's because of the achrives but some days there are just a surplus of dick killers playing and that's just life.
---
Nope. Each emblem is seperate, the quality is what matters and highest is 18 for iri.
---
Then again, impossible for you to get 2 rift shards without daily xp cap.
---
There is no way to go over 600 xp cap (otherwise player would afk in matches to farm xp)
---
You kinda asked the point I made. The reason survivors don’t have any passive stats is that it’s a balancing nightmare. The devs already have a hard enough time pulling Bubba Wraith Legion and Trapper out the shithole of low tier, Imagine being disadvantaged solely because the survivor you like who was on equal terms before now is less useful because another survivor has some much more useful or interesting buff. 
---
It would be nice to have survivors do something unique that doesn’t immediately put them at some meta-listed variants of power but just going with buffing them for being them is not the play in the long run.
---
I used No Mither to finish the challenge in the time where you need to hit great skill checks with This Is Not Happening so I think it has a use
---
Yep. Nothing more annoying than looking for immersed survivors. I used to use Whispers as a mandatory perk at one point when there was no end game collapse and still use it at lower ranks.
---
Ruin, nurses calling, bbq, sloppy
---
I have heard about people losing items when they shouldn't. Seems to not be a widespread bug but a consistent one for those that experience it.
---
Ruin, bbq, nurses calling &amp; overcharge if you have it tier 3
---
Are you suggesting it’s Vigo the Carpathian?
---
This community throwing around the word toxic needs to stop. That’s not toxic behavior at all. It’s just quitting or leaving ahead of time to save myself from a shitty experience. Moris are just a free depip for everyone involved. I only see killers use Ebony Moris when they’re mad after getting piledriver the game before or aren’t confident in their abilities to 4K a SwF. Except I was solo q. And then I check the guy’s profile after and it’s just screenshots of endgame screens with him 4king us Ebony Moris. That’s actual toxicity.
---
OP thought they were mori’s but it was just the killer shrouds
---
He still got a black pip though so that'd count as a draw.
---
Oh so he stole it from my Facebook post LOL. He's clearly got my Instagram watermark on it but I'm glad to see that this was posted on here yesterday after as I posted it on the Facebook
---
Ways I've seen:
---
- crouch and nod
---
- place the item in your hands on the ground (like paying for your gifted escape)
---
- boop the snoot [Pig mains]
---
- express gratitude via post-game chat or a DM
---
Some survivors seem to think only of themselves so farming to them is letting them win
---
I want the spirit chapter I can’t wait for it
---
Wait until rank reset day and then try again. There will be much more people in your rank range playing on that day, and once you get to like the 12-15 range at least you should find games much much quicker. At purple and above you should find them quite fast based on region
---
I’m used to people considering survivors different. What can I say?
---
Never do corner gens
---
follows the same rules as multiplication of negative numbers
---
You don't know where anybody is in a chase once they break line of sight, heartbeat or no. Removing the red stain is useless because moonwalking exists, and also they recently changed it so you cant see the red light through walls anymore.
---
To be more specifc, I have all the docs perks except overcharge. I play a lot of hag so I only got him for monitor.
---
I checked your other stuff and I gotta say you're one hell of an artist! Just super frickin' well done!
---
It's Viggo Mortensen
---
Pro-tip: never go to rank 1. There's no benefit and it only gets more toxic and unfun. And this comes from someone who's been there a few times, the first time on purpose for achievement the others accidental
---
To be honest links are all well and good untill you start blowing up women for their hands and some marine biologist has to beat you up for it
---
You gotta go through a lot if you have perks you haven't upgraded then upgrade them
---
Not deppipping every game sounds not impressive. You can do same on a lot of killers
---
Thanks for the answer, I thought that challenge was for a later level. And yeah I’m having more fun just leaving during loading and finding a new game than staying in. Not gonna wait 10 minutes for a 5 minute game lol
---
It's even got my Instagram  watermark on it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Ahhh yes. The good all "It in every game so get over it." Thank you for that input. Hey everyone TEABAGGING IS IN EVERY GAME SO THEREFORE IT MEANS NOTHING. Thanks. Thats like saying because the minnimum wage being too low effects everyone so therefore no one is allowed to complain about it... ok fellow gamer.
---
Entity bless! I just found it
---
His detection seems really inconsistent at the moment and that bothers me personally I like him as a character though overall
---
It's the most important thing
---
That’s fair
---
Fair point
---
The wiki says the following:  You are fuelled with an unexpected energy when saving an Ally from a Hook within the Killer's [Terror Radius](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Terror_Radius).    
---
While it is flavour text, I expect it also to have some truth in it.
---
Tbagging is just instinct for me now
---
A combination of new players who are Stranger Things fans are playing him and that his power gives an audible notification when someone is near his portals so it is easy to zone out just running gen control while waiting for a survivor to go near his controlled points.
---
Tea anyone?
---
Once you learn that rank in DBD doesn't mean anything, every game will be casual. DBD doesn't need or even could handle separate queues.
---
It's exclusive
---
No we do not? Are you on Switch?
---
Yeah, that explains it. Forgot the devs don't give a shit about us 😂😂
---
Would make a great hex totem tho
---
IDK if you should blame the last person for leaving too, they probably were solo and just got screwed in 30 seconds. Correct me if wrong though.
---
for a while uh? someone where is failing all the skill checks
---
my idea for the obsession build is to reveal my location to the killer and basically disappear, wasting the killer’s time and allowing my teammates to do gens, so i thought stealth perks would do well in that context?
---
stealthy: thanks! i’ll swap iron will for sprint burst. 
---
i actually forgot that fixated only works when healthy.
---
nancy: my idea for this build is to use empathy to activate second wind (you have to heal someone else first). i use breakdown to see where the killer is coming from so i can dash away after the unhook and activate second wind. i’ll probably also bring a toolbox. aftercare is gimmicky but i plan on basically becoming a gen jockey/healer after my first hook. i like aftercare because i feel like it works best with the idea for this build &amp; the aura reading abilities that my teammates gain could be helpful to them. 
---
maybe i should’ve explained my uses in the original post, oops..
---
Oh shit, I'm sorry man. Just looked like a repost. That sucks he stole your OC without crediting you!
---
Or you can just message them when the game ends?
---
Or having 2 penalty reduction addons on hillbilly and bumping to recover faster
---
Your welcome random citizen
---
Stop spamming your shitty meme
---
Why do you constantly surround yourself with injured baby Survivors? Also, similarly to pretty much every Killer, you gotta listen closely.
---
I wish I could get Leatherfaces, non-m1llies, fun huntresses, Wraiths, Trappers, New Nurses, Demogorgons, Myres, Legions, non-bodyblocking-pigs, but N o p e... let's just play the unfun killers :/
---
Burger King Myers
---
Alright I’ll give this a shot
---
Is bloody coil the downing add on or the injuring one?
---
i would be perfectly fine with them removing both mori and decisive strike.
---
Yup, my bad
---
Not sure why I didn’t think of this. Good idea thank you
---
Responding with a immature insult to actual, but inconvenient, history? I'm not surprised.
---
Gun control has historically been used for anti-minority racism in the USA. You can lie about it or pretend it never happened but it did. Democrats were also pro-slavery before it was outlawed, and feminists afterwards repeatedly expressed white supremacy beliefs...
---
But sure, keep thinking the left is aaaaaaalways for civil rights. And that progress was ONLY caused by the left... lmao
---
sweet, let me know if it does the trick.
---
It is. you're supposed to do the challenges on the side, not base your entire game off of it. just bring a shiny, you should have like 40.

That's not true. Survivors consistently use dead hard for dodging AND distance. I use it to bait hits all of the time or save myself from looping mind games. And it's good against spirits phase, nurses blink, pigs lunge, etc.
---
We get it already!

Now I feel dumb

Ill just take your word for it.

What do you mean Nea is just a totally normal girl who likes to step on cats
---
Ok but wasnt this exact same meme posted like.. earlier this week? Comon people
---
Object of Obsession.  
---
Survivor perk that let's you see the killer &amp; lets the killer see you while you are X meters away from killer's terror radius. Can't remember exact numbers off the top of my head.  
---
For more useful terms, refer to the [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary).
---
Tachanka became a meme because he's comically bad compared to the other operators. You could compare him to trapper because in a sense they're both relics from an earlier stage of development that the devs have at some point tried to buff, but have given up on (giving Tachanka a face shield on his turret, and changing the sabotaging mechanics so Sabo-ing a trap doesn't break the trap for the whole game, etc).
---
Ehh they should just nerf mori's and make them not secret. then add more secrets so we can know what the shit we're going against.
---
Fatigue not a stun if that were to be implemented
---
Can this please be oversaturated content?
---
Hes on console which are still peer to peer
---
She’s got the bitter beer face
---
"camper and tunneler" after I downed someone instantly after the unhook but before re-hooking I  downed another 2 of his freinds. Repeat, I had 3 people downed at once "camper and tunneler"
---
Hag be looking like a wither skeleton
---
That what I meant thank you for telling me
---
Console is still peer to peer and lag switching is definitly on the player not the developer.
---
And yes, I do. my acc is is steamcommunity.com/id/SlayingAces
---
Yes, I'm banned, but I play on a friend (steamcommunity.com/id/Shmocky)'S account
---
W r o n g. Wrong
---
the best way.. especially if it’s demogorgon or piggy
---
Good idea, but I honestly think Feral Frenzy is a fine power for the legion. It just should be lethal and more fast
---
I just got threatened to be banned lol. All I did was win a game as Myers that I was AFK for the entire beginning of because I had to answer the phone
---
That's awful, but I have heard of that happening before.
---
Not sure if you read the post but I had a swf try to trick me as the killer. It didnt work out for them but it was really strange and toxic
---
Oh, so they’re percentages of survivors sprint speed?
---
Had this happen when I brought an anniversary party cake I had laying around on my dwight. 2 gens popped killer DC and I lose my offerings and get nothing
---
Yeah, apparently it's a Switch thing, oh well, no BBQ for the killers and I can continue being a good Stealth survivor, as we also don't have Halloween event, nor Pig buffs, because BHVR doesn't give a lunging fuck about the Switch release I guess. 
---
Buuuut this is also cool because now that means we have 8 potential perks to guess at
---
keep coping and seething. your veneer of irony and acting like you dont care is so obvious ur not fooling anyone
---
i always get temple of purgation.. fortunately it’s my favorite map.
---
No there is a database that shows it, survivor run at 4m/s while killers run at something above which in % is that 115 and 110
---
Unless they trade items
---
Right stick pressed left and hold then rotate left stick clockwise twice. You get a feel for how your character reacts to your input. You have to make sure it’s fluid movement or you’ll just spin your camera and stand still and get smacked. 
---
FYI it’s only like 30% effective and I usually still get smacked. I have the best luck against Billy to dodge his chain saw
---
If you’re the last survivor and you’re just sitting at the exit gate waiting for the killer to walk into view yeah there is something wrong. It wastes time, if they’re going to escape and end the game I’m not trying to walk across the map to the other exit gate to watch them just turn around and walk out I want to get to the next game ASAP.
---
I do a slow t-bag or two and drop whatever I’m carrying as an offering.
---
If keys are op then nerf moris.
---
Yeah, possibly. It would all take ALOT of testing to see what would be balanced and fair. Numbers here are just place holders, the main idea I wanted to get across was the team based element in his power.
---
That’s just how people are sometimes. People get mad and want to blame anyone but themselves
---
Maybe if they made blood visible as base kit BUT removed collision then that would be fine.
---
I actually didn’t know that. No I feel really dumb.  I never get party invites either tho
---
Makes sense then, thanks
---
That’s awesome! :) I love it.
---
So take away all mind games so you can easily win?
---
Don’t let it get to you. If you play Killer you are supposed to kill.
---
I don’t see her giving us choccy milk, so yes.
---
Stl maybe?
---
Same tho and flashlight
---
I’m not sure why you made an edit about getting downvoted with that opinion. If you said you’re a big fan of Roman Polanski or Epstein because you’re able to separate their personal life from their work, that’s your prerogative, but don’t expect people to praise you because you’re proclaiming willful ignorance of crimes and despicable things just so you can enjoy some media.
---
The farm, Macmillan Estate, and Autohaven all have like double/triple the amount of individual maps as the other realms so you see them way more than the others
---
"no form of cheating is allowed"
---
I don’t DC, I just restart game while it’s loading. How is their experience shitty when all that happens is they’re sent back to the menu? And when sometimes leaves during loading and I see the killer played some sweaty shit I say “glad I dodged that one” lol
---
There aren’t any rules to staring contest tho except loser blinks
---
This shit made me laugh thanks
---
They don't work together as using either of them deplete the medkit on use, so you can't use one then the other in succession on a medkit.
---
Also, if you have 2 people run medkits (one with each add on), what would happen is the syringe would just heal the endurance effect off and you would still be injured. It's like Adrenaline against Legion. If he hit you with his power and you have to mend when Adrenaline activates, it only heals off the orange bar and you end up injured
---
Are you an EU PC player by any chance?
---
I could get behind giving her a sign she's phasing and making prayer beads a pink add on but she absolutely should NOT get a stun after phasing. Would make her horribly unfun
---
wholesome
---
You can purchase the premium pass at any time and it will retroactively unlock everything you would have so far. 
---
So if you’d like, you can play the free one a while and once the Rift is close to closing, take a look at your tier progress and decide if it’s worth it. If you like the rewards, buy and you’ll get everything “earned” so far. This can be nice if you’re not sure how far you’ll get and such. 
---
Also, if you unlock all Tiers and have premium, you will earn your Auric Cells back, which you can use for the next Rift if you wish.
---
Old news OP, you search button
---
Don’t forget bubba
---
Backwater is really weird, it has reminded me to not recover in a corner due to those pesky corner hooks
---
Situational awareness helps with this. Fake a pickup, grab the survivor and block the drop prompt from one end. A survivor at a pallet isn’t always a down if the killer plays smart. It’s just clunky how you can get smacked with a pallet and have no reaction.
---
The funny part is that even if you try to blind him, he can't blink.
---
I believe it's called brain damage. Seek professional help.
---
As long as there's a trap cap. Also assuming you mean one or two of those changes at most and not all of them.
---
Oh for sure, I totally understand why I get tunneled with it, I do the same thing lol I just don't tend to run it because of that lol
---
Wow, what’s it with this sub and reposting the same stuff over and over and over again? Congrats, but users found that like an entire week ago. Please stop posting this.
---
I just re-read and saw that so i elaborated a little more in my post
---
Delete this post rn so only we know
---
I don’t even need to win, I’m just gonna staring at him forever 💓
---
No way any of them would be able to smack you, only the killer should have that ability. And yes, you would be able to body block Julie, but she would just keep going for it, so unless you want to stay with her forever, then she will do so eventually. Either that, or she’ll pick another pallet in a set amount of time. And I don’t think it would actually hurt the killer, as the legion have their own walking animation, separate to survivors. It might be confusing to survivors but, after awhile I think it would be obvious as to which one is the actual killer.
---
Make it so he starts with 2 traps by default and slightly increase the trap setting speed. That’s all he needs really.
---
The game is terribly balanced, all survivors arent on an equal playing field (some are louder/quieter than others, some blend in better than others), you dont know what you’re playing against until you load in nor do you know what map you’re playing on, insanely broken and game warping add ons and offerings (iri head, moris, keys, toolboxes), unbalanced maps that have been in the game for years (haddonfield), game mechanics that are complete jokes (sabo and bloodlust), meme tier perks (slippery meat, monstrous shrine), killer powers that rely heavily on RNG (Pig RBT/Trapper trap, etc.
---
This game is not competitive in the slightest. Thinking it is remotely competitive and expecting it to be is ones own fault.
---
You play games to have fun. Having people mocking you is not fun.
---
Lost 60k bp as a survivor earlier because the killer dcd just as I opened the door. Was not happy at all.
---
It’s not what you wanna hear but it’s very true.
---
If you insist though, always check your emblems post-game and see where you did the worst. Reading the scoring can often give you the insight you need to adjust and improve to those sweet reds and golds.
---
I say good.  Fuck your awful perks
---
I play Claudette and I got tunnelled whole game, why? Because of the challenge. I bet you.
---
imagine if it was myers
---
It's almost certain a rights thing, but the concept would be awesome. Shame they'd have to buy rights to the characters first.
---
it could be haunted ground. when the killer is running huanted ground, two totems are lit up. If someone cleanses it, all survivors are exposed for  a minute which means that they are one hit.
---
I knew you'd answer something like this.
---
Actually it's more like I had a feeling it'd be you based on this comment.
---
Ah yes, the thing everyone sees and has already been posted 100 times
---
😉
---
Nice I have brain damage because of actions in a video game. Anything else Mr, Reddit Psychologist?
---
Benedict literally was the one writing notes last year about how he found Vigo's Journal.
---
He'd have to remove his mask tho, can't know if he blinked, that's kinda like cheating to me.
---
I feel like it could be Benedict. 
---
His fate is unknown, and he does seem like the kind of person to put this together.
---
Lol sometime you miss click or something else... sorry if it’s not really logical I just make quick random ass memes 😂
---
Does he? All ive seen is his YouTube killer vids, maybe the algorithm doesn't want me watching survivor lol, I'll have to look at his survivor gameplay and tweak my opinion there.
---
I think there are lots of issues, but none are game breaking. Instadown hatchets aren't fun to play against, but they're not game breaking. That applies to most issues I have with the game.
---
*High five in Doctor mains*
---
It was 5th before they delayed the Archives
---
Last year was the same Blight event. It had notes and a cinematic which showed us more lore.
---
To be fair, not every pallet is worth breaking immediately in a chase as not all pallets in every situation create situations like this. Doesn't help the huntress kept trying to charge up her hatchets because that also slows her down.
---
Yeah, it’s deff interesting. My whole idea here is to move away from power only used to injure survivors, and to give it a unique twist that would also give the killer some form of map presence. As well, I think his power as a whole doesn’t really play into the lore of the killer, making the legion only a single killer, instead of what they are which is, well, Legion lol
---
Every plague related thread I’ve seen in the last week has had someone mention “vommy mommy” in the comments.
---
I dont much care for t-bagging but i would like add that this is a game. You are supposed to be able to escape real life and have fun. Getting mocked isnt fun, ergo people get mad that their fun time that is supposed to give them a time off real life is getting spoiled
---
Imagine having all those perks on at once
---
Yea, the cooldown time could be worse, but I find it funny that they try and fix some killers and just completely break them. The only one they actually fixed and made more powerful was Freddy. He can actually apply map pressure. The rest, they "fixed", but took initially what was good for that killer in the first place.
---
I don't think it is. Can you post a link?
---
YES✋🏻
---
Nah bro it's just megs new special ability
---
She's zooming
---
Can I gift a friend a certain character by using in game currency to buy it?
---
\*hjönks menacingly\*
---
Fair enough, YouTube has just been showing me his killer gameplay lol I'll have to lurk, he's just not my favorite DBD streamer
---
&gt;Just had a survivor escape while their timer was in the red and about to burst. Wtf
---
He escaped through the hatch and RBTs always worked like this.
---
 No you can not. They have to purchase it themselves on their account.
---
https://youtu.be/l230trT1czo
---
Yeah i saw it several times, should be costom perk items.
---
That feeling will subside when a rank 5 Nea with Decisive Strike, Deliverance and Dead Hard T-bags you after dropping a pallet on you. Enjoy the easy prey while you can, its gonna get a whole lot tougher
---
I play both survivor and killer and am generally a legion main. I find him very fun to play. The key is to apply map pressure using your frenzy. It makes survivors waste time trying to mend and heal.
---
Always good to keep your mind occupied while waiting.
---
It's unavoidable when you release two kits that are similar imo. There is always gonna be one that is just better to play. If they really wanna buff trapper they should try and make him more unique. Him and Hag are just super similar rn.
---
Wtf
---
Thanks for the advice. Good thing I dont come crying to you.
---
#ENOUGH
---
Uh, hatch?
---
Mobile doesn't have the animation ):
---
92. holy fuck
---
If you put the trap on after the last gen was done they can just walk out as the trap never activates. If you put it on before the last gen was done they are only supposed to be able to escape through the hatch. Must be a bug.
---
Yes, because pre-rework Freddy, Leatherface, and Pig are all top tier and creative Killers
---
well it is an all time classic
---
I don't expect to be praised for my viewpoint friend, I just would like it to be understood. I know what he's done, I don't condone them but I didn't bring them up because that was objectively not what the conversation was about. The enjoyment of "some media" was the whole point.
---
With the scratch mark idea you can use lithe, quick and quiet, lightweight, and dance with me so you can vault through a window and have the killer lose you
---
I plan on it. But it needs to be sturdy. Right now, the rails keep popping off and im having a bit if trouble with a couple other areas. Its a pen holder (hollow on top) but also has 2 slots for sd card and 3 slots for micro sd.  
---
Ill probably sell a cheap one right off the print bed and a nice one fully painted.
---
&gt; but against a spirit you actually have to think and look up from your phone
---
This exactly!!!!!!!!!
---
Head traps don’t activate if you put them on after the gens are done. It was a nerf but not nearly as bad as this sub makes it out to be
---
I love how this was downvoted
---
Ah, so if I play the free one and buy the prem later I will unlock all the prem stuff I would have earned instantly? I'll likely do that then, thank you.
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about lmao that wasn’t a head on, he doesn’t even have the perk equipped.
---
OP is talking about gates. I know you can get hatch. That has always been the case and has never changed
---
The only DBD players I’ve watched is Hexy (who doesn’t post on YT as much), Noob (who hasn’t posted in forever), and Zubat (who seems like an absolute god at the game). Started, True yesterday, Monto today and I’ve seen Otz once before. 
---
Who is the best DBD player to watch in terms of entertainment? Zubat seems like the best for skill, and I really like Noob.
---
My pc is great actually, I just think paying $10 for a pass that mostly gives me charms to wear on my belt is dumb. They don’t even have cosmetics for each character, just a handful (and not even the most played ones).
---
Nice locker juke, apparently latency had the last laugh though
---
Issue is, killers have yet to have any of their equivalent of insta heals changed.
---
What if you replaced the cam with when ur carried, 1/2/3 survivors see the killer
---
You should read comments before you comment yourself to avoid looking like a 4head
---
Two questions about emblem progression:
---
- If two survivors are working on a gen together, do you both split a pool of Lightbringer emblem rewards? Or would you get the same amount as if you were to do a gen alone?
---
- If ruin is active, and you simply get a "good" skillcheck, if you keep working on the gen (without gaining progress because of Ruin) do you still get Lightbringer emblem points?
---
Just stop, you are so insanely blind and conceited it's absurd
---
if you want exceptionally boring and vanilla challenges that is certainly an opinion you can hold
---
*grins back*
---
Past what evryone has said here from being a very 'fun-time' guy and being a sort of teacher he started showing up in my recommended about 2/3 months ago. I've always watched certain DBD youtubers yet never got an otz video recommended till recently. Dont knwo if its just me tho but that might be a thing
---
Instead we got ear-rape level lung cancer coughing.
---
I'm rank 5 and played a game with 2 rank 3 survivors yesterday. Both of them stepped in traps a minute in and then disconnected. Red ranks are the biggest crybabies in the world.
---
Oh, okay then. My bad, sorry about that
---
You'd be best served by sending that footage to their support site.
---
Posting it here *might* turn up something that you've overlooked, but if the best the community can do is to tell you it's "just a bug" then it's better for everyone if you show it to the team that can actually do something about it.
---
PI is awesome
---
Facts are hard. Sorry.
---
NA PC player
---
Would be nice, but have to see the two in practice to see how it would work
---
Or having stacks of unrelenting and STBFL on demo
---
All the have to do is nerf prayer beads. Give it like a 10m radius.
---
Yeah the demo lunge is really good for inaccurate exit tbags. I helped a Quentin learn that on a first time playing demo
---
I guess this Piggy didn’t get the memo for her “update” to her traps...
---
Nea Will Become the Tank
---
RIP
---
Maybe, I'll probably finish out the series first before any more reworks - this one was more a product of being sick and not feeling like coming up with new ideas haha
---
Here’s the thing though, atleast at high ranks, its pretty much impossible to pip, win, if you don’t get the 4k. The pip system basically wants you to 4K to get the W in the upper red ranks. My experience as survivor is that I’ll get a pip as long as I play well in game. If I get a couple of unhooks, a couple of good chases, and atleast some gen progress, I am going to pip. Meanwhile, when I play killer, if I two hook everyone, get two or three sacrifices, I am not guaranteed a pip, cause if generators get done too fast, I get no gatekeeper. As well, there are two emblems associated with killing survivors, and if I don’t get a high enough of a score in each, as well as adding fast gens, then damn, I lost.
---
Yes, go to insults when I'm just stating facts. There is plenty of rounds where I have openned all 5 chests. You should stop. You're the reason this game is bad, because the players are bad.
---
Jesus fuck I’d rather have a survivor loop me for 3 gens than spend that time just looking for an immersed blendette or some shit
---
Lol you look like a 4head commenting on everything the guy posts
---
Her trap was activated already.
---
Yes, so long as it’s before the Rift closes, which is counting down at the top of the screen somewhere. That way, if you discover you are playing often enough to warrant getting the pass, you can get it guilt-free. 
---
Complete enough and you get enough cells for the next pass too so as long as you’re a consistently active player, one pass purchase will get you each premium rift/season. (:
---
Her trap was activated before the last gen had even popped
---
Grow up and stop crying for useless shit, like it or
---
not, people will keep teabagging at exits. You’re actually promoting that people keeps doing what annoys you. Is up to you to make a big deal out of something as useless as teabagging. It reflects how u handle situations in life. You’re welcome.
---
I love it when Claudettes are helpful. As one, a lot of people don’t think so. Most Claudettes without self-care don’t generally bring empathy, which is good to have sometimes (I do depending on my mood)
---
Then don’t spend $10 on the pass?
---
To clarify, the change to Pig is that her traps are not automatically active when put on after gens are finished. Previously traps were considered active when placed after gens were done and would pop in the gates. Now, they have to be put on before the final gen is complete to be active an pop in the gates.
---
In your description, the trap was active which means it was placed before the final gen was finished. This means it would have popped in the gate and the information given to you by the survivor is utterly wrong
---
Ah yes, we havent seen this before
---
There still needs to be a win condition that allows you to keep them if certain parameters are met.
---
If you would have read the post, it was at the exit gates not the hatch. I watched the survivor walk out of the gates with an activated trap
---
It would give killers some more control over their perks and be a fun benefit.
---
It was a bug then. As long as you put a trap on before the last gen pops it will activate.
---
You quit during loading because you are a gigantic pussy. This forces 3 survivors and a killer to wait through an extra long loading screen, load into the game, get disconnected because you quit, go through another loading screen before you can leave the lobby, search for another lobby, and wait for everyone to ready up hoping there isn't a gigantic pussy in this lobby as well.
---
what?
---
My favorite is when you trap a window and a survivor fast vaults it and goes right over it
---
Vacuum pallets :(
---
That's a buff for Spirit absolutely not if that's all you're suggesting that's an uneven trade.
---
Well yeah, that's why you cant find a match. It's common sense that a week before reset you wouldnt be able to find a match at the lowest possible rank.
---
Wasnt talking about you was talking about the other guy he replied to
---
I love otz but thata mainly because i find him just fun to watch. Noob is probably the most entertaining
---
The only time i can understand facecamping is when a survivor gets cocky and tea bags after 1 pallet stun
---
After I posted it I felt like there might've been a perk with a similar benefit already. I mostly play survivor so it was easier to come up with survivor ideas.
---
I'm glad you actually like them though. :) I'm all for more varied gameplay.
---
Thank you for the information. I'm still confused on how they managed to escape though. A bug no doubt
---
The awful strategy is tunneling and I meant nerf
---
You clearly dont like the guy, why comment on his posts instead of just ignoring them? You were all over him in another post I read earlier
---
&gt;If you would have read the post, it was at the exit gates not the hatch. I watched the survivor walk out of the gates with an activated trap
---
I rather trust that you are just mistaken. 
---
A) The trap was put after the 5h gen which means it wasn't active.
---
B) The trap was active and he escaped through hatch. 
---
C) You just encountered a bug that has nothing to do with how Pig works.
---
I know. You just look like an idiot for replying to them like that. And it's obvious you didn't read my post fully
---
Then it's just one more out of a million bugs in the game right now. Your options are take the risk it will happen again or just don't play pig. Sucks.
---
You're completely missing what I'm talking about
---
Man this is the dumbest excuse not to buff an underpowered killer
---
if this was the case then it would have been impossible for her to still be alive until the point she left through the gate unless you were chasing her the entire time
---
Iridescent head intensifies
---
What do you propose? IMO there are some addons that if you’re competent whatsoever basically read “you get a guaranteed 3-4k” so deaths isn’t a good metric
---
Where’s deliverance?
---
I didn’t buy the pass, I’d just like to see a better one in the future.
---
The game exists for a while now doesn't it? there are a few things that i find odd in a game this old, like DC with no real penalty, ranks don't mean much, weird reward system (it feels like instead of playing the objective we are playing to try and farm as much BP as possible) and stuff like that. But if it only gets better with time i guess there is nothing to worry about. i basically want to still play it a year from now, it has so much potential.
---
There's always been a pretty standard amount of toxicity from what I've seen. Dead by Daylight has one of the most toxic in-game communities that I've personally come across, though those out of game and on this subreddit, youtube, etc tend to be a little better I think.
---
DC's are painfull
---
And I'm commenting on something irrelevant to your post so I dont really understand why you're responding to me saying im an idiot? You've gotten your question answered, it was a bug
---
Tiny tbag
---
I meant that I want a killer and survivor I can buy with shards, and not something I have to buy with money.
---
1. That’ll be far down the line considering she’s not a base killer
---
2. I haven’t really been seeing any Trappers even though he’s the center of the archives so chances are it won’t drastically increase the people playing her, and even if it does chances are they will mostly be baby Spirits
---
3. Back to 1 by the time it does come she’ll be nerfed severely since they’re already talking about changing her soon in the last dev stream
---
i think they should buff the doc first honestly
---
I replied to them literally one other time today, and I think that was the first time I ever even replied to a comment of theirs. It is weird as fuck that even stuck out to you. Do you have some personal interest in that user?
---
You sound so dumb. I wasn't mistaken and several other replies to this post have made it clear that what I experienced was a bug. Her trap was put on before the last gen had popped, activating the trap.
---
But if she would of left then her stupid self couldn't of gotten hooked lol
---
standing still takes so much brain power I can’t even comprehend it. Definitely a mindgame, the most skill based mindgame
---
Left behind?
---
Any killers and survivors that are BHVR-original can be bought with shards.
---
Many other games have come before this and established a norm for what to expect. The devs know this. This being their own first time isn't an excuse. The Rift is poor and we need to recognize that or it won't get better. BHVR is a company, not your friend.
---
I’m new, I know this is a reference to haunted grounds, but in general, is it a good idea to cleanse any dull totems you find on the off chance the killer has No one escapes death?
---
Also is cleansing totems even worth it if it notifies you they have thrill of the hunt? (Unless they also have something like ruin?)
---
From the other comment of yours I replied to it seems like something funky happened with that particular trap
---
I'm actually really hoping the next killer is original.
---
That what i like to happen but they complaining about she has no counter play to her or she to easy to kill everyone and she is not fun to play against or they can make it a Ultra rare but i do not know what they will do to make her fair to play
---
Lmao love how you try to turn it on me when I'm just stating a point to you, shows your intelligence.
---
She can still fake this out by going in the phasing but not move.
---
&gt; And it's obvious you didn't read my post fully
---
almost no one did, and almost no one ever does here
---
After testing it, you can grab them by standing on the left-most part of the entry, otherwise youre blocked off
---
I have 3 of those perks, 1 isn’t reachable because I haven’t bothered to level them up, and I use the 1st two constantly because it’s a good build
---
Entertainment would probably be the likes of HybridPanda, Otz, No0b3, and AaronPlaysTV. There's also a few streamers who are pretty entertaining and great at the game like FunGoose, who is probably my favorite DBD content creator right now along with Tru3Ta1ent and Otz
---
Yup I feel your pain and don’t burn anything worth ah shit anymore because when I do, shit like this always happens and you get no points! But I’ve had other people tell me I’m wrong and that you keep your points but I think they are just special...
---
Mods should be deleting this shit, like the 10 millionth time ive seen it
---
Chests are real mvp
---
OP knows it themselves. Try to be more positive
---
I'd use nurses over deerstalker tbh
---
The other day I tried to boop the snoot of a piggy and she got mad and downed me so I took matters into my own hands and booped it with a locker door :/
---
What? I'm "turning" it on you because it is so odd to prescribe some kind of motive to me for commenting to a user a grand total of two times.
---
Not having a vaulting animation is really big brained
---
I wasn't chasing her. I had went up to the exit gate, found the beeping headtrapped surviver stood there as the timer was about to explode and then watched as the surviver escaped, impossibly
---
Use the best counter: super immersed Claudette.
---
Second best counter: uninstall.
---
^(/s)
---
As an NA player I haven't noticed much difference but my EU friends have complained about it constantly.
---
I guess so.
---
Dude, this happened to me last night! I was fucking around with huntress (literally never play her, only have her at rank 22) trying to get a feel for how to play her. Totally expected to take a fat L and was fine with it. I did manage to hook a few people but all the gens were powered and I hadn’t killed anyone. I saw an injured Steve run towards the exit gate and followed him to see a nea and a Claudette hanging around the exit gate teabagging. I managed to hatchet the injured nea and hook her. I play on console and have messages turned off but I bet that player was super salty. But, ya know, just fucking leave if you hear the killer coming.
---
Lol literally all I was saying is you were all over him earlier, and I saw another post here and go figure you're on him again, is it too hard to be mature and just leave it?
---
Uhh... I’m just a fast reader but it doesn’t seem like he is...?
---
Well TIL you're able to kobe when alone on the trial. Guess because of the 1 escape?
---
Go ahead and do it. You won't see me ragequit like you pussies. Disconnecting against spirit mid match is fine. Fucking entitled little baby.
---
It's a short post. Not sure why anyone would reply without reading it fully. I couldn't understand if it were paragraphs of ranting but it takes seconds to read the post fully. I tried to make it as too the point as possible.
---
Ah I remember someone making that name in one of the Plague discussion threads when she came out lol
---
All over him? All I said was that they consistently say dumb shit. It was one sentence. I'm starting to think you're an alt
---
You cannot get over 18 exp for emblems alone. It only counts your highest level emblem.
---
I’m not sure what happened if the xp cap is 600 though. Maybe the cap just doesn’t count for fragments, because I’m fairly certain that I didn’t get the daily bonus.
---
Or maybe I did get the daily bonus anyway somehow. I don’t remember what the time was, so it coulda happened I guess
---
Also, you’d have to get super lucky in order to last 10 minutes by being idle.
---
Yeah almost every time I unlock a new entry and try to listen to it crashes
---
I main Freddy as killer now but when I started I learned with Billy. I have played a fair amount of all the free killers, recently picked up Ghostface. He has a steeper learning curve I think.
---
No concept/suggestion questions are allowed in this thread per the rules
---
Finally, now I can ward off all those megs that keem breaking in my house.
---
Someone replied with information on why this is wrong. It seems my issue was a very strange bug. :/ It's a bummer too cus it'll probably happen again and I really like playing pig.
---
Right just like the fact you’re wrong mate lol.
---
We need an increase to the amount of BP we earn for actions. Killer with a shitty game can still earn 25k with no hooks due to Stacking perks that give BP bonuses. What do survivors have? WGLF which you need to farm unhooks which means your team has to get hooked (bad). Double the points for gens, skill checks, and chase escapes for survivors and it will encourage new players to play survivor to help the grind of the blood web
---
Okay. let the pathetic battle for the last word begin.
---
Yeah, I hate that struggle vacuum because SO many killers risk it and I'd get out of their grip but because they can hook me from pretty far I end up getting hooked even though I shouldn't. It sucks.
---
Lmao you're hilarious dude. Keep ignoring the obvious thing I'm stating to you and try and put it on me, must realize you have no defense so you're here trying to deflect it.
---
&gt;You sound so dumb. I wasn't mistaken and several other replies to this post have made it clear that what I experienced was a bug. Her trap was put on before the last gen had popped, activating the trap.
---
You came to this thread complaining about her mechanic being changed instead of asking what happened:
---
&gt;It's been a while since I've looked at what's been done to her but head traps timers don't mean anything in endgame collapse any more.
---
So you were probably mistaken or encountered a bug.
---
Oh okay. You mean the shards that they make almost impossible to collect enough of to spend on an entire character? Lol

im so upset because someone said an unpopular opinion... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AGAGGAGAHAGAGFAHAHgqsudfs9ofnaf
---
I don’t get the *a sign if she’s phasing* isn’t she meant to be a **mind game** killer, so would that beat the whole point of her power
---
Basically Hellpriest (pinhead) Lol I agree.
---
These hoes ain't loyal.
---
What obvious thing are you stating to me? You are extremely invested in me and this person who I have only commented toward twice *ever* and both times only because they gave a user wrong information
---
That's playable, but at that point why not run a medkit? Green medkit with selfcare and botany heals you in like 8 seconds and with charge addons you can heal like 6 times. In this case you end up using selfcare for the durability and can become outclassed by streetwise.
---
The item slot is less valuable than a perk slot in your loadout, if you want to be time efficient with your self healing use a medkit with speed addons and botany.
---
Right, my main issue with camping is it is often the survivors fault. A lot of teammates are too dumb to actually lead the killer away instead of leading him right to the hook, often right before they unhook you directly in front of the killer and you just get downed again anyway.
---
And no, looking for a survivor you know is near the hook is not camping, its the hooked survivors teammate being a goddamb idiot. If you get spotted you run away, so you become a distraction and your team can rescue
---
Ugh, the Hellraiser franchise has been grossly mistreated ever since the third film. Most fans hold Hellraiser 1 &amp; 2 in high regards as does the rest of the horror community.
---
There is a a reason why Doug Bradley is an iconic name in horror and why he’s in such high demand a conventions and expos.
---
And not to mention, most of Clive Barker’s work (novels and novellas) are critically acclaimed by the likes of the horror king himself Stephen King, one of those is “The Hellbound Heart” which is the basis for the film Hellraiser.
---
The image of Pinhead is synonymous with Horror.
---
To your first question-- yes. Generally speaking, you should cleanse basically every totem you find. The trick with Haunted Ground is that if you're playing against a Spirit and they don't have Ruin, it's a very safe bet that any lit totem is going to be Haunted Ground. However, most savvy Spirit players are familiar with this logic so they run both. And very few people run Thrill of the Hunt without another hex perk. It's basically a waste of a perk slot without it.
---
10 min do pass quickly (even faster whem you dont think about it).
---
Also the cap is counted for the fragments. (If it was higher, people would've finished the rift in less than 10 days without the aid of archives)
---
That would be cool if you could gift items though not gonna lie
---
Did your daily ritual happen to be wasting every pallet on the map?
---
Just delete prayer beads and that's all
---
Well they had to push the update out before Halloween xD.
---
This is a shitty(pun intended) idea. I love it.
---
yes, how’d ya know
---
Lol that you can just move on instead of being a dick to people? And he gave him the correct information based on the post, he didnt scroll through the op's comments. You went through the comments and decided to be a dick instead of just not responding to it, he didnt explain it was the gate and the other guy commented based on that. Not invested in anything just telling you you dont need to be a jerk and responding to you trying to somehow act like you're in the right.
---
If I hang out at the exit, it's because I think that I can potentially distract the killer somehow and buy time for my teammates to escape. I rarely run BT, so I'm not an ideal endgame rescuer.
---
&gt; Someone replied with information on why this is wrong.
---
yeah it was me haha i figured i should be more helpful
---
I want OG killers.
---
It is, I use it on myers and get constantly accused of wall hacks lol
---
Would main tbh
---
I do ok when I face her.
---
Did you read what I said? After gens are done, this is basically your only shot at getting a kill, and therefore, BP, if you haven't already. I don't often get to the end phase when I play a killer I'm comfortable with, but when I do, I guard my hooks because once he gets unhooked the games basically over. I think this is much more fair than any NOED play.
---
When I need a medkit, I find one to about 75% (ya I‘m a lucky boy)
---
Power description plz.
---
Awesome thank you! Didn't want to fuck it up and not be able to killer challenges
---
PepeHands
---
On flat outdoor maps, he can still 3-gen regardless of what gens are left over.  His map pressure is higher than any other killer's.
---
I’m finding it hard to rank up cause I’m doing just as good as I would do when I was in purple but cause the bar is higher it’s annoyingly
---
Get up close &amp; breathe really hard.
---
&gt; Lol that you can just move on instead of being a dick to people?
---
oh okay well that's where you're wrong. being a dick is my whole shtick
---
&gt; And he gave him the correct information based on the post
---
no, he made an assumption 
---
&gt; he didnt scroll through the op's comments
---
Which is literally what I commented to point out to him. there was like 5 comments at that moment and it takes 2 seconds to see if this was addressed. 
---
&gt; Not invested in anything
---
lol okay guy
---
by the way, you said I comment on everything he says, but this person has commented like 50 times today and I replied to them twice
---
&gt; to somehow act like you're in the right.
---
...I objectively am though
---
No offense, but the doctor looks like E.Gadd from Luigi's mansion and I can't get over it
---
I would too. Maybe with sloppy butcher. I use nurses on a lot of my other killers.
---
To be fair. When every entry. Has three word... sentences. It's better for us. If he spoke them faster.
---
Yeah I jut needed to restart the game apparently, when I got on it put me on the 4th tome and I guess that screwed things up when I went to the first one
---
Also, you don't even mentioned exit gates in your post. 
---
&gt;Pig might as well be useless now. It's been a while since I've looked at what's been done to her but head traps timers don't mean anything in endgame collapse any more. Just had a survivor escape while their timer was in the red and about to burst. Wtf
---
For all that I know you were just looking at the hud and saw that survivor escape.
---
That stat applies to 4-man SWF.
---
In my experiences, 3 tokens is easy but they will wait a bit in swf to unhook until its gone
---
Hopefully you run that Nancy perk then? The one that lets you see all survivor auras when someone gets downed. Thats a perfect perk if you want to commit to gens as much as possible.
---
I like the general idea of having an above the average perk with a negative twist, similar to corrupted bonecharms in Dishonored.
---
Lol you're right that it was a bug sure, you're also right that you're a dick so good luck with that. I talked to you pretty nicely and you're still a smartass.
---
How is that a ghost face problem then?
---
All the survivors are just skins of each other since at certain levels(30,35,40) you can unlock their perks for other survivors to use.Most people use Claudette first because of her darker skin and clothing she blends in with the environment but I would advise against that because that wil hurt your chasing potential later on.
---
Most killers require a certain level of skill but Wraith,Leatherface and Legion tend to be easiest to use,but they're the weaker killers because of the low skill ceiling.Also grab the BBQ from the shrine of secrets if you don't plan on buying leatherface because god knows when it will come back again,there's about 1.5 hours left until it's gone.
---
It doesn't say so, but it works, at least, it was working in the summer - no changes were done I believe
---
I look like this when I sit on the toilet lol
---
Vigo, Mori's son
---
Using anything during these events: Prayer Beads Spirits
---
Otz's advice was STBFL and two-stab people in frenzy to build up stacks, then find the next person, rinse / repeat until max stacks. Should I do that or just apply map pressure and get stacks passively?
---
Don't listen to the naysayers. 
---
Use Mettle of Man with We're Gonna Live Forever. They go hand-in-hand with how they work and you can not only get a fuck ton of points, but you also get MoM stacks. 
---
The easiest way to use MoM is to hug an injured survivor who is being chased and take a hit. The most important detail is that the other survivor is **technically** in a chase at the same time as you **before** you are hit. Protection hits are a bit finicky, but as long as you're both technically being chased, they're injured, and you get hit, you'll get a stack for both perks.
---
That’s an ungodly long heal
---
Believe me, on purple to red ranks, the killers you're most likely going to run into are: Spirit, Nurse, Billy.
---
Ther is almost no variety concerning the games, plus your average BBQ &amp; Ruin combination.
---
The biggest problem of high rank gameplay is the repetitive and sweaty gameplay, every match is the same, everyone in the lobby is trying their best.
---
The last few days I was like: "Oh, I could play some games to calm down. Well shit, I'm on a high rank as survivor and killer lobbies take forever. Fuck it, I'm playing Rocket League." I can't play this game to chill anymore, I gotta do my best not to die in the first 2 mins into the game.
---
Idk and honestly, idc
---
Just wanna see a punishment for dcers
---
Ever been in red ranks?
---
The Plague or Adiris
---
I love that some survivors unironically argue that the killer is in the wrong for this. It shows what survivors don’t play both sides.
---
Too many survivors playing, not enough killers
---
My dude I'm in my 20s. 😂 Gtfo.
---
I strongly disagree
---
Its probably because they don't want the first pass of cosmetics to go on dlc characters that some people haven't even bought.
---
Do you mean the opposite?
---
Good I wasn't wooshed
---
Not just Nurse, also Legion.
---
&gt;  Also they must be in your head if you went and checked their comments lol.
---
I checked because I wanted to see if I really did reply to them a lot today. I did that because you said I replied to everything they said. Turns out that was incorrect.
---
Anyway, have a good day, DecutorR. (we all know it's you)
---
I call her “My Least Favorite Killer to Play Against”
---
It’s a pretty fitting nickname
---
Because of the video you submitted to Http://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight.
---
You also jave to keep your chainsaw revved the entire time they are hooked
---
What would you replace for sloppy butcher?
---
I think we can all agree on that
---
A 360• spin would make it more epic
---
Tuning Guide + Thompson's Mix Billy is so nice~
---
Sometimes I miss the old Tinkerer, regardless of the stupidity of speed charge Billy and Machine Guntress.
---
Haha ok there man, love how you think I'm him cause I'm calling you out for being a dick, it's hilarious
---
Yea, I play ambulance Nea (We'll make it, borrowed time, empathy and Spine chill) and facing the Plague is kinda depressing.
---
To dodge mori if you want to be that big of a weenie, just kill yourself on first hook. That way at least the killer loses the offering and you don't waste everybody's time
---
It sounds sexual.
---
I'm in.
---
Do you think he needs one?
---
Will NOED overwrite one of the trapped HG totems when the gates are opened if they are still active?
---
True that especially when potatoes start cleansing against her but when they start cleansing I’m like fuck it so I just do it too
---
Ds is karma? Literally nothing the killer could do against you
---
lol, we call her "Karen."
---
&gt; And I even went against a Cut Coin....like who brings that offering?
---
There's a "Open 4 chests in a single trial" and another random chest opening challenges in The rift right now, so that's why.
---
You’re the reason I’ve been getting to phase two on my first hook more and more recently
---
?
---
Trapper is one of the most balanced killers we have. He really does not need a rework.
---
No. Noed only triggers if there is a dull totem remaining on the map.
---
I’ve noticed that too but I don’t really mind tbh
---
Just stop being so popular then Otz 4Head
---
Her character just really grosses me out, I can’t do vomit and hearing my character vomiting sets me off, I don’t cleanse unless everyone else is but I’m tempted to DC every time I play against her. I never do though
---
Also I love that you keep editing your posts to add more once I've already responded. Keep thinking I'm him, just shows you know I'm right and cant think of anyway to defend yourself for the way you are :)
---
Vacuum pallets were removed, only makes sense these other vacuum examples should go too.
---
I think It does work like that now you get the endurance and the heal after 16 seconds ive seen two people do it in one game
---
I’ve clutch found medkits saving my ass a number of times with it.
---
I remember playing the game and I got camped a lot and my teammates save me and I escape leaving one person behind, I say sorry but they get mad at me and next game they just block my way to the escape door and let me die.
---
Clown looks like a sad panda.
---
That’s a pretty spot on Joaquin cosplay tbh.
---
Yeah I reckon reddit can be quite spooky especially for someone of your caliber
---
Ya I understand. Like the other guy said tho there isn't any real reason to get to rank 1 anyways and in general it's less fun for both sides.
---
Rank 20 is a terrible shitshow. It is known.
---
Vomit doesn’t really affect me but I think she’s fun to play against unlike other killers... *Cough spirit Cough*
---
OP got put on the hook JUST before the last survivor was dead. Meaning OP was able to be given the oppertunity to Kobe.
---
As the Legion always said: "Degenerates like you belong on a cross."
---
Pretty sure that’s an Add-On for Legion.
---
Too bad the game isn't that violent.
---
Rank reset is coming, so anyone who actively plays is a high rank, and anyone who doesnt is a low rank, you dont really have many in between
---
&gt;There is a reason for this and it is to prevent literal old school facecamping and Trapper placing traps directly below hooked survivors. They created a radius around the hook that also affects hooking animations. And your desire to have killers hook from directly in front of the hook would be broken. I know survivor mains want literally every second chance in the universe, but the killer caught you. Get over it. The wiggling mechanic is 99 percent to prevent you from being basemented from anywhere on the map.
---
Remember when Survivors had to unhook from a single angle and they changed it to swivel hooks?
---
So if we remove "hook vacuum" then what? They make it so Killer can hook a Survivor from any angle and all the time and effort making the animations results in the same thing anyways.
---
Steve here. Thought the ghost face was still mid-chase across the map. Made for good meme material though :')
---
I have, but only once and only barely (rank 4). The number that the devs published are averages of the whole playerbase so if it doesn't apply to your rank (based on your own experiences) then you can safely ignore it. But 4-man SWF isn't a significant part of the overall population.
---
Yeah i saw it several times, should be costom perk icons.
---
Thank you.
---
I got a basement 3k yesterday just because people would not give me the chance to be ‘good’ and leave the vicinity of the killer shack. XD
---
Bill 1: RUN BILL, SAVE YOURSELF!
---
Bill 3: WHICH BILL?
---
Desire for pre-Entity killer skins ***DRASTICALLY INTENSIFIES***
---
When we first found out about them I was like "meh sounds lame" but I surprised by how well you can actually see them. I don't care for them too much on my hooks though because I always think they're a survivor trying to sneak around me
---
Yeah I'm not looking forward trying to kill all 4 survivors. I don't like using moris.
---
Number 1.  Y'all need to get off his fucking balls.  He's not great, not cool, kinda ugly as a matter of fact, but you sheeple slob his knob like it's go8ng out of style. 
---
  Realize, streamers and such are NOT the "zomgwtfbbq awesomesauce".  They need to inherently build this lie because NO ONE would watch a show they know sucks from the get go.
---
Their "performances" are all highlight reels...tye average "youtuber" for Dbd plays for 5-10 HOURS to get enough footage for a 12-15 minute "funny moments" video.
---
Furthermore,  alot of these are still FAKES.
---
See Ochido for reference, as most of his videos are totally staged (both surv and killer are playing WITH him) to make him look like a god.
---
Secondly, I'll take the time to point out the sad commentary of how America has degenerated from staring at the idiot box OR playing videogames into STARING AT A VIDEO OF SOMEONE WHO FAILS AT LIFE PLAY VIDEO GAMES.
---
Get a life of your own, for fucks sake.
---
Is anyone else having ridiculously long killer queue times?  I'm waiting about 10 minutes for a queue to pop for killer, but insta-queue survivors.
---
Am I just unlucky, or are there tons of killers playing?
---
Doesn’t the syringe heal you two health states? So, wouldn’t you be fully healed? Adrenaline heals only one.
---
Yeah her only counter to survivors is her ability to not be read is a mind game. You want all killers to be easily looped and stunned with no variance or challenge piss off.
---
What's the point valuing it though? So far all I've seen is that when you're at higher ranks as killer you sometimes get games faster, survivor is instant no matter your rank.
---
Why does rank matter when BHVR can't incentivise increasing it?
---
I can't figure out what you're trying to say here. It is borderline incomprehensible
---
It’s one of Backwater’s many... quirks.
---
Op probably means the “no” nodding piggy did before she picked op up
---
Cringe
---
i mean sort of, if you wait till rank reset there will be more mid level players, but they will be the same players that were high rank, the rank system is not very indicative of the player level, so really rank doesnt matter
---
why did you edit your comment ? lololol
---
Yes, it happened to everyone.
---
iri heads, prayer beads, every mori,  Insta saw, Pinky finger, exhaust addons ect
---
Just to claim why I wouldn’t want to get into a match with you, but I’m just joking no hate at all
---
it sucks that toxicity is never going, and it'll always be that way. imo, I'd say it's to do with certain killers being statistically weaker than others. take nurse, for example. survivors hate going against her because she isn't easy to escape vs. now take leatherface, who is probably the lowest tier killer atm. survivors love vs'ing him because, put simply, he sucks. and because of this, they feel like they are good at the game, and entitled to berate the killer.  there's only so much mindgaming you can do as killers like leatherface, and at the end of the day, you'll probably lose more than you win. and due to the nature of most of this community, you'll be insulted more than you'll be complimented.
---
also i really wish you put 'toxicity breeds toxicity', for no reason in particular lmao
---
k thks
---
I’m not a guy and it’s fun BC every game won’t be the . Anyways , obviously others will disagree but I’m with otz , new is fun old is boring . Every game since the challenges , have been hella fun on both sides . People are weird and just are sensitive or just want to be “right” but anyways have a great day y’all . I’m loving these funny , non meta and weird quirky challenges ! I’m not repeating myself if some one else tries to argument or concur. 🤷🏻‍♀️ lol but love this game
---
Just a small tip, it's not a good idea to not use the pallets like that. It's better to run through the pallet, then run around the area the pallet is placed, that way you waste a bit more of the killers time and you have a higher chance of stunning them :) 
---
(ex. If it's between a car and a rock, run around the car a few times before dropping it.)
---
Imagine if the Demo had an addon meaning it could summon demodogs instead of placing portals, and they would attack on sight. That'd be interesting but pretty OP.
---
Dead by Fortnite? :3
---
Uhm... Ok? You realise this is just a meme right? It's from history channel's forged in fire. I don't think streamers are "awesomesauce" either, they're just people like you and me. If peoole enjoy watching someone's gameplay and/or commentary what's wrong with that?
---
that's awesome! I love the Vommy Mommy
---
They were both reworked recently, now syringe only heals 1 health state over 8 seconds
---
In that video's case, its a meme making fun of him glitching from both hitting through the pallet and his SF activating at the same time and cancelling the animation, thats not an actual perk tier or anything
---
For both the killer and their teammates
---
Actually they made it 16 seconds when it hit live.
---
it’s funny because i was being tunneled all match, and ran him for five gens. but thanks, ig.
---
Blighted Demogorgon. That'd be fucking awesome. Maybe one day, but I doubt any licensed killers will get blighted outfits.
---
BC that barley happens . Unless you’re a person who always runs endgame perks 🤷🏻‍♀️ which is not the case in red ranks
---
Removed for party thread /r/dbdLFG
---
You’re playing a dangerous game giving people this knowledge
---
Because there isn't.
---
What is going on with the switch!
---
I’m all good for waiting on an update, but I’m getting worried because BHVR has been ignoring the switch lately. They stated that switch halloween update is eta. I have no problem waiting, but they are giving no information. The newest update, day of the dead cosmetics, is stated to be on all platforms. Every platform except switch. I’m hoping someone can shed light to this problem incase I’ve been missing something
---
That could be a fun thing to do. The killer could catch on and ignore you until it's convenient after the first time though. Atleast, that's my experience.
---
Yeah. They should change it, but that's how Fixated is right now.
---
I'm going to be honest, I didn't know Breakdown had an aura component to it because I still have Jeff at level 1 from when I bought the Legion DLC. Replacing Empathy with We'll Make It could be good idea, though.
---
Maybe, lol.
---
now we wait for the inevitable to happen to this poor, wholesome soul
---
Yeah, I usually hover around the green and purple ranks (I only play like an hour or so a day,) and you're right...in the purple ranks, that's pretty much all I see. Maybe a random Ghostface or Myers thrown in the mix, but mostly the 3 you mentioned! I mostly play survivor, but when I do play killer, I like to mix it up. I'm only a rank 15 killer, and rarely play the same killer twice in the same day because (like you said) it's boring. Killer lobby wait times are ridiculous! I usually do laundry, dishes, or play with my dogs while I wait to get in a match! LOL!
---
I was gunna say he reminds me of Colonol Sanders
---
I don’t see why it’s karma. She hooks you, you 4%, then you DS her. I don’t get it??
---
# Patch 1.8.0
---
&gt;Added the ability to unhook a Survivor from all possible angles. Also known as "Swivel Hooks".
---
Remove "Hook Vacuum" and basically time and effort will be put into the same thing for Killer.
---
You'll still be hooked.
---
Doesn't matter if your struggle bar was 99.9%.
---
Lol I’m done
---
Im entitled for wanting to have fun and not let the killer have theirs because they decide to play unfun... you know the golden rule is treat others how you want to be treated, and this game is just filled with sociopaths and unempethetic people.
---
Thanos
---
She went in and out of stealth which is her version T bagging
---
I knew about that patch change. I alluded to it in my comment. It looked like you had an issue with my comment, but I understand you now, sorry.
---
Omgg haha Ive done that before it gets so frustrating especially when you know you hit it
---
I run buckle up all the time, Its good for a solo player such as myself to know when I can safely pick up a survivor if the Killer slugs them. It also pairs well with the Syringe, Take the killers attention, Pop the syringe on the downed survivor applying the 8 wind up for the instant pick up and I get a stack of mettle of man. Thats a steal!
---
same. I started as p1 level 20 myers. Got to level 45 before i got it and level50 before tier 3
---
Oh, my bad! And I completely relate, I play Claudette and Nancy for the most part and I get tunneled a lot as Claud.
---
Someone suggested changing prayer beads from no phasing sound, to a map-wide phasing sound. I thought like that sounded fun and would maybe fix the issue people have with it. Other than that, I think that if Spirit turns while phasing, the husk should turn too just as a slight indication of what she's doing
---
I'm dubious they'd add challenges for dlc people may not own
---
I actually completely agree with everything you’ve just said, although in terms of how much progress the game has made I mean I’m enjoying it way more than I did last year. Spirit fury should be 4 pallets, rather than 2 and bloodlust shouldn’t buff more than once, anything more is just overkill. Spirit’s phase should have the audio cue when inside her terror radius (not sure if it’s meant to make no hiss or if it’s a bug) and I think it would balance out the mindgame potential around pallets, rather than just standing still and making a 50/50 guess whether she’s really phasing or just standing still - although I still think Spirit is made out to be way worse face than she actually is.
---
Bad matchmaking + low population + trolls + splitting playerbase is a recipe for utter disaster.
---
As long as you do it before it ends, yes
---
How dare you run an in-game mechanic
---
How dare you not stand there looking pretty and let the survivors win
---
Your comment is useless
---
No way u ran him for five gens ur pallet points were not maxed Nd u dropped every pallet lol
---
As long as you buy it before it expires in 63 days you’ll get everything.
---
i would love to see these as icon packs
---
I was steve yeah.  I was thinking “why the fuq is he cloaking?  Is this a new add on?!”
---
I'm going to miss a decent chunk of the hallowed blight event cause I have driver's training Monday thru Thursday and I work Friday through Sunday for an entire month (I paid the $10 for the premium thing too \[FML\]). Can I get an F in chat?
---
Dude, sick fanart
---
Someone is gonna think ur being serious lmao.
---
I like their original killers. They all have charisma and I like playing them. Ghostface (partly), Legion, Plague are my favourites. Doctor is scary and awesome, Nurse's design is brilliant. Same for the default killers. Wish devs treated some original killers better (legion)
---
it does have them lmao
---
You can just sacrifice them on a hook, works too
---
I want to have BBQ somewhere in my build for bloodpoints. Where would you put it?
---
Another Spirit nerf thread disguised as "balance change". While you're at it, why not just delete her from the game. That would be so much fun to play against right. 
---
No other killer should get a stun for 2-3 seconds if they don't successfully land a hit on a survivor. The hell out of here with that nonsense.
---
And her 15 second recharge should be standard for the power for killers like Ghostface and the Demogorgan.
---
Outplay her, or get rekt. Those should be a survivor's only options.
---
i doubt you read the previous comments, but this wasn’t to brag about skill. i’m rank 4 because of my altruism and the ability to perform objectives. i am NOT the best at looping, or chases, but go off  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Did you happen to have me as killer?
---
Anyone notice the perk at the very top left?
---
Wait people are calling Plague “Vommy Mommy?” Tell me when you find out who came up with it so I can give them platinum
---
I need it because rank 20s don't heal
---
I have it when I use light theme, but not on dark theme. I'm not gonna sacrifice my eyes to the entity for a medkit though :(
---
at 0:09 you can see the pallet drop scoring event trigger on the left side, the bar shows you have obtained less than 4000 boldness.
---
You sir, are a liar.
---
otz really did make me feel a lot better playing killer. I’ve always used both sides as I get easily bored as playing one side, but being a killer on the high ranks made me feel like I didn’t deserve to be there. ever since I started watching his videos, though, I’ve really had a change of perspective. I feel so much more relaxed now, and I don’t stress over losing a survivor or two. if you’re reading, otz, thank u :P
---
He broke her heart. Dwight's got the impact.
---
Fuck you too, you little shit! Get out!
---
Huh, that could be viable for Pinhead with his hell chain things. It'd be hard to balance though, can't just have him pulling survivors over objects during loops and stuff.
---
Lol I like how you humble brag about them being 4k’s. Just slide that in there despite it not being relevant. I see you. I dunno if it got better. I switched to survivor. I’m sure the queues get better as the day goes on. But this morning I sat for an hour with an unplayable game. 15mins, DC, 15 more mins, DC. It was super frustrating.
---
Minus the fact that her ability is completely broken
---
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. OP was doing 100 percent the right thing. If they were playing this way while 5 gens were still up you all would be right, but when the last gen is almost complete and the loops on the map are extremely weak, this is the right way to play them (with the exception of the one pallet that OP camped)
---
My wittle bing bong man!
---
It's called Underperform it's a killer perk but it has no effect. It use as a reference for developers.
---
I'd love if they added custom soundtracks as an addition for the Rifts, same with custom mori animations. 
---
# SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
---
Did you at least wipe before the SWF team you faced  wiped the floor with you?
---
An all-time classic.
---
I’m kind of addicted. I already hit rank 37. I have been playing every moment I can spare. I am learning a lot. Honestly the best thing that helped me with playing survivor was playing as a killer and watching what better survivors do to me. Lol
---
the only consumables that expire after the event is over are the petal offering the special medkit and flashlight stay in your inventory tho
---
The Legion theme he made kicks ass and fits really well with their background. I'd love to see it in the game some day.
---
Maybe there's not many survivors around rank 19 playing atm
---
&gt;I don't know why pressing E (the unfair and OP juke) is bad but pressing A or D (the "fair" juke, apparently) is good or fine. 
---
Because pressing A and D do not make you invulnerable. You have to outplay the huntress by reading which direction she is going to throw, and juking the other way. It opens up a massive, compelling series of mind games.
---
Last time she threw directly at me, so I dodged left and she missed. Now will she anticipate that I will dodge left and try to lead left, so I should dodge right? Or will she expect me to anticipate she will aim left, thus she will aim right and I should dodge left again?
---
If you read her incorrectly, you are punished by getting hit.
---
Dead hard has none of this depth. It is exactly as you are describing spirit, the survivor has 100% of the power in the situation while the huntress has nothing to work with. Unless the survivor massively misplays and blows dead hard while the huntress holds up her hatchet but does not release it, they will get a free dodge of that hatchet throw 100% of the time with no opportunity for the huntress to outplay them. They are literally invincible for the entire time the hatchet could hit them.
---
Huntress has a loud, distinguishable audio cue with every hatchet throw. A survivor who is strong enough to be a threat will know not to press E to win until they hear the huntress's HA! hatchet release. If a survivor is somehow baited in this manner, they are just bad at the game and all of this conversation is irrelevant because they will get beat anyway. That isnt fun and engaging gameplay for both sides, it is just hoping your opponent is bad and losing the exchange of that hatchet throw 100% of the time if they are not bad. After the 500th time a survivor gets a free dodge in a situation like this with no counterplay, it gets a bit irritating.
---
If dead hard gave you a boost of distance that you could use for a dodge, but didn't make you invincible for the duration, it would be a much more engaging and fun perk. And it would still be very strong for being able to dead hard for distance at loops. The huntress could bait you to dead hard in a direction and throw the hatchet where you will land and still hit you.
---
And all of this is just talking about dead hard fucking over ONE killer. Think about the bullshit that is dead harding over trapper traps. It can turn an already lackluster killer's ability into a detriment for him. You can dead hard through a trap and if the trapper tries to follow you he will have to step in his own trap. That is just beyond stupid.
---
She does look like a Dwight
---
I think shes honestly a great killer and very underrated. Apart from the obvious top killers like nurse, spirit, and Billy, I would say shes up there in the ranks
---
You didn’t run him for long at all, it’s obvious bc there are so many pallets up, you had 3k boldness.  You dont run loops optimally at all, you ran so wide. So no way you’d last even2 gens
---
I started the game as a survivor main and I hated playing against the plague, she was my least favorite by far (I hadn’t even met spirit yet lol) but after playing the game more and more I realized that she’s a very unique killer with a power like no one else’s, and I grew to like her more. Now I main plague and as survivor I love going against her, it makes you play more as a team, are we cleansing this game or not? And adds more to the game imo. But that’s just my 2¢
---
Legion’s mori is my favorite because of survivors fighting back.
---
Well I’m in the 10 percent... I’ve been playing for like 2 months and Only been up against her a few times... just started playing on the killers side recently
---
I hope so, would love another non licensed
---
I want you to know I’m using Hummy Mummy from now on.
---
How do you kill only one person with a ebony mori? Also this gameplay was horrible to watch
---
DBD is now on game pass for PC, am i able to play with people on steam or do they need to play on game pass as well?
---
I’ve never seen his
---
looks great, the colors are so clean
---
Oh for sure. If anyone's seen the cutscene for him he roids up with blight juice at the end. I think he's almost definitely our new killer and this is the teaser for him.
---
MarbleTheNeaMain and getting self-righteous over a meme making mild fun of survivor load outs: name a more iconic duo
---
Baby blendette. Holy shit are you bad at skillchecks. If you can't be helpful to the team then hide in the corner for the rest of the match.
---
Just look up all the Moris mate.
---
I love Mykie! (And our own Mikey)
---
Scary stuff
---
Then would you like to explain to me why you can’t hear her phase and why she leaves off a husk, or that the survivors can’t see her vault a window, and that the husk acts as if she’s standing afk like then
---
I may have, who were you playing?
---
I’m a noob 😩
---
Just sounds like current affairs in the game already. Entity tentacle/claws are all over the place. The Narrator seems to be referring to the Blight.
---
I mean it probably doesn’t help but you won’t really sneak up on most good survivors anyways.
---
BHVR take notes
---
Absolutely beautiful. Stunning. As a Killer main, I will find a way to sing this as a melody and make it my donation sound when I start streaming.
---
Haven't finished all of tome 1 but I only need to do the BP challenge.
---
Ahh that’s pretty guud
---
I play better... but have you ever started laughing when you miss a skill check in it just makes it worse because then you just keep missing them. I literally cannot stop laughing every time I missed
---
At lower ranks a lot of people run spine chill and will know you’re in the vicinity anyway.
---
What are the rules of the drinking game?
---
Wah wah spirit bad let me ruin game for people playing spirit wah wah
---
&gt;nothing sexual about vomiting 
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
He's a troll guys...
---
I didn’t know that was the rule I’m pretty new to Reddit as well
---
Survivors wear loud bright colors and they are meant to hide and survive. 
---
Some will play as Batman, others like Robin.
---
aha ha
---
Am I allowed to just enjoy my first Mori in peace.... sheesh
---
You broke the rule of not following the Survivor’s Guide to Playing Killer handbook.
---
It’s the swallowing noise she makes when you cancel her power that really drives me, I can’t help it.
---
OK boomer
---
Just saying but idk why the picture was turned sideways :(
---
Who tf finds immersion fun like it equates to playing a shooter game but never shooting just hanging out in the spawn till someone wins
---
this horrible game play was definitely not showing off
---
Thank you!
---
Well it can be used for crossing up someone by blinding them and running behind them
---
I have been told I'm hacking...on an Xbox... When I'm playing as Freddy since I'm good at figuring out gen hopping and chase ending.
---
this game’s fanbase is a nightmare. you post a video with faults, and suddenly everyone is an expert.
---
You ma’am*,are a liar and can’t take a joke
---
And I’m assuming the main thing you were trying to show was the mori so why was there the other 2 minutes 55 seconds of footage
---
Where is this photo from?
---
He is indeed in Identity V. Always humming a tune as he hunts. But I would also buy a DBD Jack the Ripper DLC if it came out as I like the look of the persona.
---
Because I felt like it
---
Trapper used to be a member of Rammstein confirmed
---
The answer is going to depend on your platform and timezone. Bear in mind that 4 survivors are required for every killer, so killer queues will inherently be longer. This becomes more of an issue if, say, you're playing at 5am local time on a console.
---
Theirs always urgency when the entity is around
---
I guess that's a reason, but I've never seen a survivor do that. Most just flashlight blind me then run away in a straight line
---
I was with a friend who said “oh there’s Myers near me” during the the first few minutes of the match, but I had heard the heartbeat before. I said to him “I don’t think it’s-“ and I run straight into a bear trap I didn’t notice. I yelled and said ”But I thought you said Myers?!?” It was lovely
---
Cool, well then that’s just a poorly edited video made to poorly show off something that didn’t need showing off
---
Bless
---
The smart ones use it to give you the slip. Only a dumbass will run away from you in a straight line.
---
Wait he’s Jack the Ripper? I assumed he was based on him and that he wasn’t the actual guy
---
Legit all low ranks get salty over everything
---
Oh you used OP add-ons?  HACKER
---
oh you BBQ? HACKER
---
Oh you head-on'ed me?  FACECAMP
---
Oh you looped me for too long? FACECAMP
---
You seem pretty triggered. Are you OK?  are you usually this upset about strangers posting whatever they want to on a public forum?
---
I mean it doesnt bug me that much, but technically its one more thing in the game with no counterplay......but that doesnt matter because its survivor sided.
---
Bring lightborn? Why thats as ridiculous as saying bring iron will! ;)
---
You are I’m just letting you know to look them all up....sheesh
---
cursed_toolbox
---
Guess I'm playing against dumbasses then since they all either run away in straight line or keep standing there trying to double blind me
---
Looks great
---
Are you suggesting it’s Carpathian the Vigo?
---
Didn’t see that coming did ya?
---
Oh 👌
---
They do activate during end game but only when put on before the last gen was finished.
---
I would just play survivor and bring in any coin offerings you have. I think plunderers would make it less likely you get them though because they're the equivalent of a yellow item, you'd probably get purple or pink items instead.
---
How rude! baby Dweet is a hero, but what do you expect from someone playing Quentin
---
Guilt? When they're doing that? Nah.
---
You teabagged too. Im guessing you did it during the match too? The Neon Nea players tend to not be kind.
---
Either way congrats on the no counterplay strategy. Who needs skill when you have a situation against a killer who can't win no matter what.
---
I love it, looks incredible!
---
Only level 3 is good if its a strong flashlight. Levels 1-2 are pretty weak.
---
Level 3 is so much fun though when they try to blind as you break the pallet, they’ll hold it on you as you walk towards them then whack, free hit.
---
&lt;3 Mykie and Jeffree Star!!
---
I remember that movie his name was Harry joyner.
---
 I feel like the trapper kind of already has his place though since he has Miner skins.
---
 Besides the fact that he used a pick axe Harry wasn't a memorable villain.
---
I went back to base Hag for this reason. Also, because wearing that skin murders my frame rates on console.
---
Never T-bagged the entire match I’m one of the rare survivors who don’t t-bag after literally everything I do
---
Outside of "Metal of Man takes a lot of skill" when first released, this has to be one of the dumbest statements ever made on this sub.
---
I frequently call Dwight’s man childs. But find myself feeling horrible for being mean to baby dweets when playing killer.
---
I'm pretty sure hes going to end up being a survivor
---
Are you on Xbox? Cause I may have faced this same guy...
---
If the killer gets an early hit and actually has ears they will just use sound to follow you off of your moaning. Making flahslights at pallets only useful if your healthy
---
r/downvotefarmers
---
Because what else is there? I laugh at myself when I make mistakes and video games because I don’t take them that seriously. I also don’t take myself that seriously. I love to find the humor rather than to be upset about unimportant things.. life’s weird enough
---
Just a simple icon on the bottom is fine like Kindred.
---
Lol that sounds fun actually. I enjoy making weird funny builds. So I'll probably get it as a teachable then hope I get the tier 3 on one of my killers.
---
I do as many gens as I can and start looking for the hatch ASAP. XD
---
Free 250 bloodpoints for a blind that the killer can’t look away from or prevent. Gives you time to move in a direction the killer might not be ready to intercept as long as they didn’t hear you.
---
You should run Kindred.  
---
That way you can hate all three teammates at once.
---
I wish there was more gore when facing chainsaw killers, like big boy bubba. I'm talking visual dismemberment, dangling tendons. none of this fake blood squirting bullshit.

There's only 3 perks seems fair to say gg ez
---
Thank you, I'll give that a go! :)  (Holding the button longer)
---
I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say that there are literally 15 items that aren't event currency or blank spaces on the 70 tiers of the rift **(Free Tab)**. 9 of those 15 are charms. 4 of the "free" cosmetic items are re-textures of already existing cosmetics. That leaves 2 items that are new and original.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
For the **Premium Tab** there are 45 items to be earned (out of 70) that aren't just earning back your cells. Out of those 45, 19 are charms. Out of that 19, 8 are reskins of other charms in the rift. Out of the remaining 26 items, 14 are retextures of already existing cosmetics. Only 12 cosmetics are new and original.
---
**Keep in mind that these are single cosmetic pieces that I'm counting. As in I'm actually crediting the devs with making 3 cosmetic pieces for the Blight Nurse (1) outfit alone.**
---
Just loot chests, you will get them decently often from chests in my experience and you can gift the non spooky items to other people if you don’t want them
---
An 8 bit DBD sounds fun
---
But as killer you go against survivors with the same perks anyway, its normally going to be some variant of the same 8 perks every game and they are enough to carry a team vs most killers, spirit included.
---
Spirit can be outplayed too, you just need experience and then you can easily guess their next move.
---
Ive played spirit though. Most survivors either dont move at all which makes them easy to hit or they blindly run into the open. They dont know how to bait a spirit
---
When they keep doing stupid shit like that I just consider it a hatch game. Do as many gens as possible to maybe get the spawn up before I become the last survivor and dip.
---
I guess bp is a good reason. All the survivors I've gone against just run in a straight line afterwards so I guess they just don't know that you can try and hide
---
Downvote me because I'm not gonna baby shit editing
---
Yeah a good amount of them hear that flashlight blinding at pallets is a thing you can do but don’t know what the actual purpose of doing it is, so they don’t take advantage of the blind to misdirect the killer
---
KILLERS CANNOT USE ANY PERKS OR ADDONS!!! now just let me equip my DS, balenced landing, borrowed time, purple flashlight with odd bulb and a haddonfeild offering. (joke BTW)
---
Tbh I read it in my head faster than he does.
---
Yeah that's about the best option for a plague nerf, but I would still argue she's just not fun to play against at her core. It would make it better, but it feels like your team is running no mither without the benefits lol
---
If the survivor is better?
---
I dont get this. People try to make out spirit takes zero skill but what exactly do survivors do at pallets? They run in a circle then press space bar. Thats it. It takes zero skill lol and enough of the pallets are safe enough that killers will not get a hit. You dont need to be better than the killer to loop for a few pallets, you just need to be adequate at the game.
---
Go commit stop
---
That‘s the point I‘m unsure about. They have the „Stats“ of yellow Items but are of special rarity. I‘ll try a few games without it to check!
---
Do you run Plunderers or not?
---
I've been a accused as hacking with freddy because I faked a teleport when apparently "you can't cancel teleport" (was not running class photo)
---
I do
---
I mean, I only started playing like 6 months ago, but having seen the state the game was in just before I started, it's clear the devs are really trying. I hope they can fulfill its potential.
---
Yeah. Surprised they haven't realised what they're doing wrong though. I wouldn't be surprised if they get camped and/or tunneled for doing it
---
When you do legion are you doing them all separate, all in one photo or only do frank/susie/julie/Joey?
---
Me: "I never get to use Unbreakable, I guess I'll take it off and replace it with an aura perk like Alert"
---
2 games later: *slugging Plague*
---
Alright! I‘ll take it off for a few games the next time I play to see if I get any and will try to compare (even though the sample size will be very small)
---
it's extremely sexual
---
Affirmative. BBQ and Chili cannot read a survivor's aura if they are in a locker.
---
A buff would do. A rework really isn't needed as it's still relatively easy for an experienced trapper to get kills.
---
I think it was more the letting her crawl close to the exit before actually picking her up.
---
