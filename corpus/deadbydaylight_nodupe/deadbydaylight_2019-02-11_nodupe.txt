Y'know, I was surprised, too. He's an *absolute fucking unit*.
---
---
---
I enjoy games against them sometimes. I hate going against leather face way more. He makes me scream lol
---
Gv it
---
You can hope all you want but I will take a fun game over a legion where there is close to no counter play 
---
Made with mematic
---
Thanks!
---
Pretty sure the people who actually get offended by Tbagging are the same people who take it personally when they get flicked off in traffic. 
---

---
Like, is it meant to offend you? Yes. But it’s funny, doesn’t actually personally attack you, and just makes them easier to catch. 
---
"good enough" I take issue with that. As I've been rank 1 on both sides I know how it goes, there's so much a survivor can do to limit a killers information now. Half the time I go back to the hook there's already 2 people there swarming/I'm racing someone for the unhook. If there are no survivors to find away from hook, none will be found. It's not a fringe case is my point. 
---
*clears throat* “Shitpost.”
---
They introduce an update to feng’s model that causes the game to crash when loaded in, and then promise to release bunny cosmetics one at a time in further updates
---
*sobs softy*
---
Probably a bug. I got linked to the killer somehow one time and every time they picked someone up/swung I ended up warping away from my generator, ended up a decent distance from it yet still doing the action and getting progress.
---
Don’t forget when he proved DS was turning all the frogs gay. Pretty sure there’s a high chance it’s actually just Ankle on an alt

Bother Meg and Feng, a man can dream.....
---
I just do not understand how survivors that play this game do not understand that camping isn't reportable. Their either really new to the game or just don't pay enough attention to the new changes and rules of the game XD 
---
Thank you! I will definitely keep painting.
---
I, for one, can't even tell the difference... and to be honest I never look at their heads, rather at other, uh... parts... :D
---
really?  Clown is far stronger than Doctor in competent hands.

Thank you

Leatherface: **ZA WARUDO**
---
I played against a legion that was fun today. She kept chasing Claudette on the swamp, I kept bodyblocking because I had iron will. In the end she caught up with me when the doors were open, hooked me, let someone save me, let me get a lamp then walk out. She said she was happy about the teamwork and that I took hits. It really nice game even tho I didn't do a single gen. Probably the only nice killer at rank 1 and she was playing legion.  
---
How come you guys don’t just wait until after the event is over to do these runs? (Genuine)
---
&gt;Survivors that DC against a legion aren't being toxic, they want to have fun, and legion is not fun, therefore they DC. 
---
Killers that DC against SWF using DS and Instant Heal aren't being toxic, they want to have fun, and DS + SWF is not, therefore they DC.
---
See how this works? 
---
Sounds like the Tinkerer perk to me, especially on a Billy. I’m on PS4 and havent noticed anything like that but will be on the lookout now. (:
---
I
---
Hate 
---
Leatherface 
---
Too
---
You just gotta remember he's slightly slower so you gotta start running as soon as he's coming for you. 
---
Ranking system is fucked. 
---
Definitely tinkerer.
---
In Windows, search for and open View advanced system settings.
---
Click Settings in the Startup and Recoverysection.
---
Remove the check mark next to Automatically restart, and then click OK
---
^ tinkerer for sure. Its nice to see people stepping away from meta builds.
---
I actually wanted someone like legion, a straight up human just killing people. There all technically human but you get the jist. 
---
Only when I use bloody party streamers 
---
Should be standard that if you take something on the internet and post it as your own content without giving any credit, it’s considered plagiarism. 
---
It’s not reddit exclusive either, if you went to high school(or middle school)you should know the concept of plagiarism.
---
Just ignore and move on, get you a nice salt scrub in then head out to the next round. Gotta keep that bloodpoint economy going!
---
Because once you get in a chase, there's no counterplay. He can moonwalk, just hit you after he stabs you a few times with frenzy, etc. etc. and you go down and there's nothing you can do about it. 
---
Where's my mommy doesn't work because when you level a killer up to 30+, you begin to be able to unlock teachable perks, which are just your killers perks and makes other killers be able to learn them. Perks cannot be linked to powers because of this. 
---
Let's play is outclassed by Tantophobia, Sloppy Butcher, and even Thrill of the Hunt.
---
I hear you is useless. You can already hear people cry in pain. If you want to make it louder, just use Stridor. If this perk is suppose to reveal location or something, you need to elaborate on that. Even if that were the case, you hit them, they're right in front of you, you know where they are.
---
As for the actually killer, you haven't explained enough. Is there a limit to how many traps you can place? Is it like fire, or is it something that makes fire when a survivor gets near it? If so, how are the traps triggered. WHAT DOES BURNING EVEN DO?
---
Overall, these ideas need some major fleshing out.
---
Legion fan I see? 
---
*B E G O N E*
---
What I meant by good enough was that you understand the game enough to know when it is necessary to strike down someone recently rescued and not hang around close after you hook and chase down the same person until he dies then move on to the next for the entire game
---
Shit, I haven't played in a while so I didn't know they changed Tinkerer.
---
Well... It made me shit my pants multiple times against the Billy.
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
Everyone hates that feeling ...
---
No I don't, I was doing Ninja Wraith and was pretty much just following them and what not because they legit were being altruistic asf and were saving instantly so they were pretty much not giving me any chance to move to another part of the map to hunt someone and what not. 
---
Just don't be the one to get tunneled :forehead:
---
Good old fashioned Source Filmmaker, friend. 
---
There are a few people out there that upload models for use in the Steam Workshop. I use Mark2580's models most frequently. 
---
I've never heard of this before today! Thanks tons! SUPER AWESOME
---
Indeed there is as you know, but I didn't care to resize any of these guys. 
---
I mean like your windows screen brightness ot may be brighter than what ours is set at because I used to brighten it up to see in darker areas better but it always washed colors out on my screen. Or your monitor displays darker colors a bit brighter there are many things but on a regular TV it becomes dark to see where you are and the blood also blocks the view but that's the same with borrowed time aswell 
---
I think this is more of a shit post
---
 Noice my dude.
---
Pretty much. The character could be considered their solution to balance around SWF. As absurd as that might be but remember, this is Behavior we're talking about. 
---
Did u remove the post because my mans said the N-word
---
Btw I’m the wraith ,the surv send me the pic while she was t-bagging her while mory 
---
Honestly that's what makes this game fun, anytime you can recapture your early days of playing this game when everything was terrifying and not just a bp grind. Thanks to all the killers who go for the scare!

He’d literally laugh at decisive strikes because he’d know that’s the only one you have
---
Unless I’m missing the point they can just do the gens and get out? He’s afk anyways
---
I hope this is a sarcasm
---
Finally a post showing nurse being awful to play against and not just a bunch of sobs complaining and pandering for likes about legion
---
Literally has /s in the title...
---
THIS is high quality comedy. 
---
You are a disgusting demon and I hate you for giving more power to the only killer in the game that makes me piss myself. 
---
Seems like every other game is just a crashed loading screen over the past few days of the event. Really sucks :(
---
My bad op didn't noticed
---
This game feels like the purge episode of Rick and Morty sometimes 
---
You could also use the coin to make more chests with this too
---
This is why you run Pharmacy. At least you'll get ONE item that isn't fireworks.
---
Rank has no benefits
---
I like legion.
---
Let's be honest here, Dwights tend to do this to their fellow survivors.
---
So he had it coming. 
---
I thought the Spirit and Huntress had decent backstories, but yeah Legion’s is just awful. If the entity is taking every random group of angsts teens, shouldn’t there be like 100000 playable killers right now?
---
I spent $3.18 on Bloodstained Sack and also $20 of auric cells.
---
r/DeadMeatJames
---
Legion can still be juked. Depending on the jungle gym and if you're using add-ons that extend the duration of Frenzy (the ones that add movement speed don't seem to do anything noticeable). Legion still has to respect a pallet. I know the shack can still be annoying if you don't have both add-ons that extend duration. 
---
Legion can be countered. It is actually possible. Sprint Burst just hard counters Legion. As does Balanced Landing and Lithe to a lesser extent. Survivor Mains make it seem like they have zero options. 
---
So we should not use any Perk? Whos it to say which perks are "allowed" and which not?
---
The Post's point is that Claudette could escape but preferred to Flash during mori, and on top of that provoke a little more not once but for the second hit too. And then Justice is served.
---
lol I think OP means she uses fire as magic or whatever and didn't want an OP killer, you wouldn't be happy and neither would I if her traps were infinite or she could burn survivors and actually down them with the fire.
---
imagine unlimited fire traps on generators and each time you touched it causes an insta down nobody wants that.
---
Both your comments are wrong
---
At rank 15, that's where some really good killer and survivors are,  at rank 1, it's people who are trying to be good. Otherwise you have swf at rank 1. Swf is getting carried if you're not all good. A way to depip is to kill yourself on hook and not touch a single gen. But that's I'll advised.  Get better and it won't matter where you are in rank. You win some,  you lose some
---
No ego was hurt in this case. Just someone that was too aggressive and got what he was asking for. 
---
Also i am not a Killer-only player, i play both equally.
---
big cute
---
I said legion was a brainless designed killer the first day (because I was specting something like a "cloner" killer), and you guys called me hater
---
Balanced Killer. Great Game. IncelSimulator.exe has stopped working. QUICK SOMEBODY HELP DELETE LEGION BEFORE ITS TOO LATE
---
No problem, it's pretty easy to get those two confused. "Kill all four survivors, or kill all four survivors with an add-on?"
---
Pretty sure Legion's power lies with stalling the game using Thanatophobia and even third Seal on occasion to make the early game hell. 
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
What a fucking prick 
---
Or the endgame rework
---
They could be in lockers, hiding behind gens or close. Keep that in mind.  And while it is true that there aren't rules,  I appreciate someone who cares enough to think of others feelings. Personally, if BBQ procs and I see anyone,  I'll sca-doodle-daddle tf over there.  Idc about the unhooks or anyone escaping because of it
---
If you have Myers, go for Evil Incarnate. If you get Evil Incarnate, you'll also be granted the 4-mori achievement. Also since Tombstone Myers doesn't feel as bad as a regular mori, there's probably less chance of a DC. That's how I got the 4-mori achievement, by getting Evil Incarnate.
---
Hue.
---
Then you haven’t played against one who exploits everything. Or you aren’t someone with some level of skill looping who can’t counter legion and it’s frustrating. 
---
The thing I'm saying is that we have literally no information on how these fire traps work or what being burned does.
---
Also, how does this resemble Huntress? Huntress throws things, this killer places things, more like Trapper and Hag. At least that's what I assume, because the description of the power still lacks information.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This is a repost
---
No me and the rank 3 were duo queueing, that’s the lobby we got. And it was an instant lobby. It’s not like we waited 10-15 min for this game.
---
Are they based on popularity? I usually get Nea, Meg, and Claudette dailies though I never really play them. I've never gotten an Ace or David daily, and I pretty much only play David 
---
Isn't the Meat Plant from the third movie?
---
CAMP THAT TRAMP
---
Oh that’s sad, but, have it your way!
---
SWS is pointless as it still takes 3 hits total to down a survivor, use something else like reduced mend time, faster cooldown or faster movement.
---
I think so. The pig grinder ans the freezer are from the third movie. The bathroom is from the first and second movie
---
Because he counters all of the survivors mechanics to survive, Looping? nope, pallets? vaulted, windows? vaulted, hiding? nope just hit someone with deep wound and you can see everyone in your TR.

I've played against legion, it's all a matter of baiting him into using frenzy and exhausting him to the point he can't use it as much.
---
Yea, I didn't say I appreciate someone who doesn't camp because it shows that. 
---
I was saying anyone who feels some sort of way enough to make a post about it obviously cares a bit. 
---
And you only gimp yourself by not camping in certain situations. 
---
Two survivors have to be off gens in order to get the save.  Go for the ones constantly making pressure. It's smart. Certain situations, yes, you need to camp. But it's rare
---
Try using them at vaults when the killer goes through one 
---
You clearly gained the speed boost that comes with being hit it’s just the injured animation didn’t play until after you were far away 
---
I feel like people would notice if there was a noticable 100000 homicides.
---
I feel attacked
---
I got one of those today too lol he said he's reporting me for camping which I didn't I just searched the area around him and then no one saved him after I left and then said I body blocked because he saves someone from the basement and I met them on the stairs then hit him but since he couldn't get by me and had to take the hit said I was getting reported for it lol
---
I just told him good luck and let me know how it goes
---
Using them at vaults while being chased is effective 
---
I feel like the least popular survivors/killers get featured in the dailies more.
---
And my guess it's community popularity as when there's pig daily for me, almost everyone else plays pig that day. 
---
It's an exploit because it completely fucks over the chase mechanics and there is no counter to a moonwalking legion.
---
There are lots of counterplays to 360s, BBQ and Bodyblocking. Therefore they are not exploits.
---
Also I'm neither a kid nor do I play CoD. So if you want to insult me, please think of something better.
---
The only time I “camp” is 1) if I know a survivor is by the hook. The amount of times I have two survivors trying for the unhook at the same time. right in front of me is dumb, especially at rank 1. Even when this happens though If I down one I don’t sit around I just hook the second guy  
---
Or 2) exit gates are open and far apart; normally if this happens I’ll settle for a 2k or a 3k 
---
Wait if this is a discussion then what is there to discuss? Everything you said is completely true lol
---
Blood warden, spirit fury, these are the perks that make me scream and poop my pants.
---
Ah I could see that
---
Because people with varying opinions will likely comment. I wanna hear what they say
---
I’d rather they fix the game tbh. It’s not a Bad idea at all, I’m just sick of all these new cosmetics when the game mechanics are jacked up 
---
The guy is a meme but highly entertaining, would recommend anyone and everyone to check out his stream and join the Mo Fugga U! 
---
Technically it's let me out 
---
&gt; It's an exploit because it completely fucks over the chase mechanics and there is no counter to a moonwalking legion.
---
There's no counter to a body block not unless you use Billy, Nurse, Leatherface, Legion, and maybe Clown (not unless they're blocking a door way).
---
&gt;  its about moonwalking legions who force the bleedout timer to go down even when they're right behind a survivor. 
---
I don't even need to do that with Legion, breh. I could just break a pallet or look away for a second, and then follow the blood trail with Blood Hound and your piddly ass is still going to go down. 
---
There's no real counter play to DS not unless you use Clown with Enduring or they fucked up and got downed close enough to a hook. 
---
&gt; Also I'm neither a kid nor do I play CoD. So if you want to insult me, please think of something better.
---
You certainly act like a child. You're crying about someone using a Killer you don't like and using a strategy you don't approve of. As if the Killer has to play by your made up rules. Undoubtedly you cry in other online games if people play in a way you don't approve. 
---
No you didn't you twat. You go round reddit pretending to be things you are not. Like a chef who thinks adding a tiny amount of water to a hot pot ruin a the dish. Twat. 
---
Fun Fact: If I'm not mistaken this is the Mike Tyson as the Special Referee match and at one point during the match half of Shawn Michael's ass is exposed for a few seconds.
---
Guess old Freddy is on the train to nope town.
---
The fact that you think Leatherface is bottom tier shows you do not play him. And if you want I can explain why freddy is so bad.
---
* Cannot protect hooks/gens/totems
---
* HAS to use his power on people to hit them.
---
* How long the power stays on someone is RNG, and shitty RNG as unless you constantly juggle targets it can be extremely hard to keep multiple people in the dream state. And juggling targets has a host of problems.
---
* Not really stealthy at all.
---
* Power does nothing for him once a chase starts.
---
Now lets be fair and look at his upsides:
---
* He can use the falling asleep period to make some sick mindgames, assuming there is no Lithe, Sprint Burst, Balance Landing, and that the survivor just doesn't put distance between you and him the second they fall asleep.
---
* You make people fail skillchecks
---
* You can track someone who is out of your terror radius.
---
So all in all, Freddy has some o.k. upsides, but his downsides are too much. Can you still win with him? Yes. Is he better then any other killer? No.
---
"You become obsessed with one Survivor.
---
Each time a Generator is completed, the Obsession sees your Aura for 5/4/3 seconds.
---
Each time a Generator is completed, all Survivors' locations are revealed to you for 3 seconds.
---
Once all Generators are completed, the Obsession has the Exposed  Status Effect and the Killer can kill the Obsession.
---
Only one Obsession per trial.
---
Unique to The Spirit until Level 40, at which point its Teachable version can then be learned and taught to the other Killers."
---
so every time a gen is popped killer sees everyone's auras and the obsession sees the killer
---
Hey look at the bright side, you are not only justified but also obligated to report them to avoid this happening to you or anyone else again. You've even got evidence.
---
I just hit them and keep chasing my original target. Thanks for the free Sloppy Butcher proc, Obsession-sama.
---
God. Ace is so sexy.
---
So glad to see Tapp used instead of Adam
---
You wouldn’t say gentlemen if it’s just you and one other person 
---
It's ~~real~~ new to me, dammit!
---
It's exactly the opposite for me, if I'm soloing a generator 80% and another survivor comes up to help I get so nervous about missing skill checks with them watching lmao.
---
Meg Main, Big Pain.
---
I love this
---
This sub is nothing but garbage 
---
I’ve had this happen to me before... next thing you know someone is hooked, so I go to unhook the survivor and it turns out to be them. Did a couple crouches and ran away. 
---
Hag, Spirit, and Trapper are mine. Hag and Trappers traps make me hate running around and Spirit just shits on me.
---
Shouldn't the Pig also be Steel type?
---
Wish I could remember what their username was though. 
---
This is a superior version of the Gillette ad format
---
I wish :(
---
Look at the video. Your source should be good enough quality to see.
---
I include the killer :P respect all around lol
---
Unless you play survivor without DS, Self-Care, Borrowed Time, or any exhaustion perk, you really can't say anything.
---
Yep. I always stay in a match when other survivors DC. It's unfair for everyone but I'm not going to gimp the killer out of points just because they did.
---
Thanks bby
---
Behaviour should have a system like this, where they put these kinds of assholes together and don't let them play with anyone else. Enjoy ruining your own games, you dicks.
---
The player below you has two exhaustion perks, and one of them isn’t adrenaline. How some people make it to the red ranks I will never know. 
---
Seriously, I had a match that would have been a 4-Iridescent Emblem but the last survivor DC’d when I found them
---
Everything was fine except the Mori.
---
he forgot frank’s
---
Btw you could have just ignored ruin and hit greats?
---
No problem.
---
Damn.
---
I mean, it sucks when you're 1 of 2 left or even just the last one but it's better not to make it worse. There's enough of a rift between survivors and killers as is (that's just how the game goes) without people deciding to fuck it up further.
---
Even if the killer decides to kill me off the bat, it at least proves to them that not everyone will be toxic.
---
I'm sorry to hear your iridescents were taken from you. It's extremely unfair and childish.
---
original respawn timers? try no respawn timers
---
those were "good"? days
---
I've never find against one!
---
They’re likely only being that obstinate to get under your skin, which clearly worked. 
---
who downvoted me? upvote if you think its you!
---
What a degenerate insulting people who have counter opinions 
---
why so salty?
---
I'd actually argue Trapper, as that combined with a tar bottles can make Macmillan maps an absolute hell to go up against, since the mist covers a lot of the ground.
---
Upvoted for the trith
---
Had a teammate throw a firecracker at me at a gen... only to proceed to do the gen with me. Like... ok?
---
Yeah and this sub trying to normalize DCing just because it's legion is a bad thing. I'd hate to load into a game and have my team just quit before it even starts. 
---
This man may have -10 points but he speaks the truth
---
Plus balanced landing still reduces your stagger from falling even while exhausted. 
---
Good shit. Survivors piss me off
---
Same. Camping is boring and I'm not too bothered about whether or not I get a 4k as killer. I'll look around for them and if they get the hatch, gg.
---
Billy is godly with NOED
---
This ace should learn  good placement at the gates. 
---
I suppose that's some usual things at rank 20 lobbies.
---
If it was me you would be tbagged and i would be out with your salty tears on my ass.
---
The problem is, SWF can easily cheese the system by having their lower-ranked buddy make the SWF lobby and invite everyone, ensuring that they get a lower-ranked killer than they should. There's also been a way to glitch the system going around, that I obviously won't tell how to do here. The devs need to make SWF match up with a killer who matches the highest-ranking person in the group's rank, but then I'd fear that they'd all just derank (like some people already do) just to be able to keep going against lower-ranked killers and get easier matches. 
---
The producers wanted to play a game... But the game went on too long causing audience members to dc. 
---
Lithe has great synergy with other perks, like Quick &amp; Quiet and Dance With Me.
---
*Runs Lightborn almost 100% of the time*
---
BOLD OF YOU TO ASSUME I CAN BE STOPPED.
---
I force myself. Especially when it's a doc daily.
---
Is that some sort of elf in an Elvis Presley suit guarding an evil tinker bell?
---
Must've been a hell of a match!
---
I never said it wasn't necessary, not even once. OP said that survivors don't adapt, I disagreed and provided 5 specific examples where survivor gameplay was drastically changed to show that survivors adapt all the time to nerfs.
---
It's called "Spencer's Last Breath" 100% worth the BP
---
Honestly. There are times where I’m clearly following someone, they’re in my sights and they’re running and I don’t hear the music
---
Some killer games are really unfun. Just like some survivor games are really unfun. 
---
If you can't take swf then maybe killer isnt dor you. You need to learn to use their communication against them. Swf is never going away and asking to only face solo survivors makes you a killer with training wheels. 
---
Cosmetics are over priced. Chapters are perfectly priced. Change my mind.
---
Legion isn't even like free win for the killer. He's just annoying. People think Legion is auto loss or something. LEGION IS BEATABLE TRY IT OUT INSTEAD OF DCING PEOPLE
---
yeah agreed! i just thought that 99% of the killer games would be unfun bc i only ever saw ppl complain about bm survivors lol so i strayed away for a while. 
---
Spine chill is say is a strong perk but maybe just cause I'm bad at this game. 
---
I’m a spirit main (but I also play survivor so I’ve had it used against me) and I genuinely think rancor needs a slight nerf. It should be exposed status or only be a mori, but not both.
---
This starts to bother me now that I can loop a killer around for at least 2 gens.  Whenever I do this, I tend to get hard camped then tunnelled.  This is BS.  Why do I get punished for playing well?  It's like the developer never considered how petty some killer mains are and it ruins the enjoyment of people who want to play well.  So now unless I get down in 10 seconds or less, I can be sure to be hard camped then tunnelled.  
---
I feel that once you're hooked, you should respawn somewhere on the map instead of relying on your mate to set you free.  Because at this point in time, killers are just petty all around.
---
true lol i guess everyone just plays like a try hard during events including myself 
---
I actually enjoyed reading this, very detailed too.. enjoyed using my imagination xD good work!
---
Perk: Furious five
---
First five minutes of the game all survivors have exposed effect 
---
*teabagging flashlight spam tapp*
---
Well, he's definitely got the zap zap, but I was also thinking of how his power makes the survivors go crazy and start seeing things, screaming, etc.

Im level 8 ma dude and going 7
---
O rly?
---
Plunderers and ace in the hole makes me cream
---
Well I mean events are easy for killers cause survivors tend to not be so worried on gens right now. Though you are doing it with the pig so I’m sure after the event you will still be doing good
---
Entity Displeased
---
Bro why tf Hag got pink hair
---
thats when the yeet you out and hook you
---
That wasnt a tbag, that was healing.
---
Is technician really that bad? 
---
How absurd of him to use a synergistic perk build
---
Oh my that's real 
---
Anyone know the time saved by using prove thyself? Been using it since the patch but curious as to if it's worth it.
---
Just do a gen and a 1/2. 2 saves and survive for 9mins. That’s a pip already.
---
To you leave my nea alone you
---
That escalated quickly.

Its like they have a sort of detection radius or something. I'm noticing this as well when playing with smaller terror radius killers or other perks, the chase music doesn't seem to register that I'm actively chasing someone.
---
He's not fun to play as or against.
---
Herman Carter: wonder years edition 
---
try to get 2 gens
---
2 unhooks(or full heals)
---
And get chased for around 2 mins 
---
should get you 1-2pips most of the time 
---
Spine chill + p3 Claud is possibly the strongest combo in the game tbh. Just kinda boring gameplay and goes widely unnoticed. (Lul)
---
*Flashlight clicks from behind pallet*
---
It’s just my opinion 
---
Awwww, Meg looks so cute!
---
You're right about that, I was just exaggerating. There would still be hundreds or even thousands of legion-esque killers by now, though, especially since the entity can take people from any time period or dimension it wants.
---
sure, but seems a bit random/pointless du just put it here, without opening a discusion or asking a question 
---
Does it matter if you get hit or not?
---
lmao did he DC at the lantern because he didnt get it?
---
This is like the time the David DCd because he didnt get his WGLF stack. I should be mad but it's just too funny.
---
not that much, but its better if you dont, unless its for "Protection" Points
---
I wish, he went to pick it up and then just died on the spot so after the shock wore off Feng picked it up
---
Ahh now that’s satisfying!
---
Games are so short in DBD nothing is being ruined. 
---
From a killer's perspective, iron will and borrowed time are as strong as adrenaline.
---
Also OoO is busted with comms. 
---
Hey now it isn't one of *those*.. looking at you r/dbdgonewild
---
wow that's so sad
---
Its just the "thing" to say Legion is unfun. Something a popular streamer or two will say and the community will eat it up. Other things you'll find everyone say are the words "toxic" and "to be honest"
---
You can get rank 1 without good perks. Perks dont carry you to rank one. Just spread out the points.
---
Instead of doing 4 gens. Do 2 and get 2 unhooks. get chased a bit and heal and grab lantern and totems. Boom pip. every game. I got to rank 5 without selfcare 
---
Sounds perfect to me! 
---
Poor mr. Bing bong &lt;3
---
It’s not holding the game hostage because they do die after a few minutes. It’s scummy, but not holding the game hostage.
---
Yeah you're right but let's be honest about it . Red Rank vs Purple vs Green. You can run into good players anywhere. Red difference between purple and green (outside of hardcore dbd houred people) isn't a big difference.
---
you know how many times a pig is right behind me or any killer is and lithe doesnt activate because "Im not in a a chase" or when pigs can sit atop of hatches
---
&gt; Who is us? The oppressed killer society you are the leader of by chance? 
---
Do you know what this is? this is called a straw-man. I never claimed to be an oppressed killer. You're the one who brought this into the argument because it's easier for you to argue against.
---
I used "We" as a royal we, as in people who have a similar playstyle to my own.
---
&gt; I am a killer myself and have heavily started to enjoy the role again after the major survivor nerfs and you know what? Never have i felt even an ounce of enjoyment in being focused on killing or ruining someone's fun in some way -like slugging someone as Doctor to find the last person alive.
---
Then congratulations, you have a different sense of fun to my own and others and you don't have to play in that way. Telling me i can't play that way because it dosent line up with your own sense of fun is asinine.
---
&gt;In the extreme case of slugging, i only do it to deny the other survivor the hatch if i feel like they don't deserve it for being an ass to others and/or me, the slugged person then get's the hatch. Also i can do all that, get 1 or 0k and still have had fun n the end.
---
Cool, once again that's fun for you, not me. You play how you want and i won't say a thing, but if you actively tell people the way they play is wrong and they shouldn't do it that way, you're being an annoying douche trying to conform everyone to *your* way of playing the game.
---
Yup. Red ranks are a ducking sweat fest and you have to play scummy as fuck to escape because most killers just facecamp and tunnel the shit you if you the instant you loop them for more than 5 seconds 
---
yeah shout out to u/JamesAJanisse

---
No, but you’re a cunt for doing it and deserve all the toxicity you get 
---
Two people working on a generator start to finish at the 90% speed(.9 charges per second) without Prove Thyself will take 44.44 seconds to complete the generator.  With Prove Thyself they get to each repair at 1 charge per second and complete the generator in 40 seconds.  Though it may also be worth noting the 4.44 second time save is also time saved for the other person as well effectively being 8.88 seconds saved for the survivors overall, per generator completed cooperatively.  With 3 survivors and no Prove Thyself, it takes 33.33 seconds to complete the generator, Prove Thyself takes it down to right at 29.63 seconds.  That's only a 3.7 second time save, but since it's time saved for 3 survivors it is collectively 11.1 seconds saved. With all 4 on the same gen, it would normally take 28.57 seconds, down to 25 flat with Prove Thyself; a collective 14.28 second time save.
---
How good that is, is debatable but that's the numbers.  The bloodpoint bonus side of the perk is pretty good too though and makes it substantially easier to actually max out the objective category.
---
Definitely one big list, but instead of synergy and situation make it general vs killer specific, such as agitation being killer specific because it’s terrible on some and good on others 
---
Ironically, it's the opposite on pc. Tutorial is stuttery and drops hella frames.
---
Everything except legion and nurse I consider balanced. 
---
As for fun I’d say everyone except legion, pig, doc, a really good nurse who just insta 4ks, Freddy, and certain clown load outs.
---
So basically billy, wraith, Meyers, hag, trapper, spirit, and huntress I consider fun to vs in almost every situation. 
---
You just dont know how to use him he isnt bad 
---
That's pretty un-gay of you to forgive me, watch yourself
---
This same chart applies to Fressy also. Only issue is they nerfed him to the ground like day 3 or so?
---
Self care situational? 
---
LMFAO 
---
Prove thyself is definitely not that strong, and pretty situational. it requires all survivors together to maximize it's effectiveness, and grants a very small bonus. Most of the time it'll be two maybe three people working on the same gen together, meaning you save like, 4 to 6 seconds respectively.
---
I also think premonition deservses to be a fair bit below spine chill. Premoniton is a cool down perk that pretty much tells you "yea the killers somewhere on the map". It doesn't really give you an accurate representation of the direction of the killer due to the wide range. Compared to spine chill which has no cooldown, and you can tell if the killer is coming, or has just walked into range for a second while chasing based on how long it stays active.
---
It shows the aura of where they were at the exact moment it triggered I think, technically? So you can’t see them moving but you still see where they were I’m not 100% on that but I believe that’s how it works.
---
Yes! It didn’t work for me as well. It’s been like that  since like the legion update. 
---
You can only use it when injure [situational], but since you are almost always injured at some point, I'd put more with DS.
---
toxic cutie cunt !!!!!!!
---
I like Billy, Huntress and Doctor the most probably; Nurse, Hag and Trapper are always kinda "eh" but not bad, everything else is neutral and Legion is way below everything.
---
I hit the skillcheck and it stops but the perk stays lit up and I dont get free. I had my buddy knock me down and pick me up over and over and I could forever use it but couldn't free.
---
I would agree with that at least,  in a way it's no fun for anyone , and should be stop/reported but doesnt happen every game 
---
This happened to me, I just ran to the other exit gate and it popped
---
I just never really got the appeal of Dead Hard, even if you dodge the hit now you have exhaustion and they'll just catch up in a moment anyway.  I have better luck using Urban Evasion with Sprint Burst, and just scoot around the map til I need to dash.
---
Nah. Its a valid way to play the game. However, for bp sake I suggest putting them on a hook.
---
How do you mind game him? It seems like there’s just no counterplay at all...
---
Another P3 Pig! FAMILY!!
---
As different killers (not legion) I've seen the same rate of DCs - DC the moment they load, get downed, get trapped, get hooked - that I've seen people DC vs legion when I solo queue. Despite people saying it is okay if it's legion, I don't think it's that popular an opinion. People are just doing it for whatever reason and legion is a handy scapegoat. 
---
Not really, your perks are to get you a good item, and you got an item you can probably use that exact same game. Or escape and keep it.
---
Following this thread for wraith maiming purpose
---
Though every killer has the potential to also be really unfun:
---
Iridescent Head or Exhaustion Huntress
---
Exhaustion Clown
---
Instasaw Billy
---
3-gen Doc
---
Omegablink or extra blinks
---
Literally any green/purple add-on Spirit
---
Myc-Mint Rag-Shackles Hag
---
etc.
---
Doesn’t it reset on the 13th? This’ll be my 2nd reset and I didn’t pay much attention the first time cause I was still spanking new.
---
the host has to be killer for it to work
---
&gt;dead hard stronger than adrenaline
---
If you're thinking of using this list to decide your build, this aint it chief.
---
I mean the real reason is as a counter to doctor if you fail a skill check. But even then, if you’re rank 12+ you can make those skill checks.
---
I have legit been in that situation with 2 people trying to blind me and a downed survivor getting healed by the 3rd. 
---
Legit waited in the corner and cried until they got the 4th up and left. 😢😭 😂🤣
---
Almost any other healing option is better. People use self care because his convenient, not good.
---
dunno, are you on ps4? all of my experiments with the swf and matchmaking has it going by the rank of the person who created the swf group not the rank of the best player.....but obviously something else funky happened with you, this is strange indeed, bet that killer felt like shit :(
---
Tbh, sprint burst isn’t that good anymore since you can’t recover during a chase. Mid-tier at best.
---
I would put up the ante in the bottom right. Luck takes a hell of a lot to do anything at all, and it's often not even good when it does.
---
Maybe you should, idk, start tunneling? Theres a reason it pisses people off and its because it works. Just because YOU had a shit experience doesn't mean the game is dead lmao. Have fun with your blackout clone.
---
If you want more elaboration:
---
 BL is inarguably the strongest exhaustion perk in the game after Adrenaline.
---
SC is fucking weak, it's just really consistent 
---
Unbreakable is situational, but it has a higher potential to turn the game around than DS.
---
Person playing killer has to host the KYF for it to work, same with trapper traps (they will float when trapper places them if he is not host)
---
I don’t understand this at all. What broke the totem and what dropped firecrackers?
---
There are killers who wouldn't even hook just slug  and have everyone bleed out. I dont mind if the killers slugs and hooks everyone ...but not hooking doesnt make any sense and that's uncalled for. 
---
I think Huntress is pretty well regarded as a fun killer to go against, minus the ridiculous iridescent head add-on and exhaustion obviously.  I would bet if there was a vote that her and Myers would probably lead the way. I find a non camping Bubba really fun also, I think he’s my favorite.
---
lord forgive me but i did not make that art, but here's the link

[https://www.kisspng.com/png-laurie-strode-michael-myers-dead-by-daylight-slash-5919591/](https://www.kisspng.com/png-laurie-strode-michael-myers-dead-by-daylight-slash-5919591/)
---
No mither should be weak but synergistic
---
Dead hard should be leaning towards situational a little
---
How is sole survivor considered synergistic and weak while object of obsession is weak and situational? If anything, it should be flipped around or they should both be on the syngery side, also they arent weak if used by good players (more so object)
---
Realistically speaking, wglf should all the way at the bottom of weak since it literally does nothing but give points
---
:O NOOOOOO
---
If thats the case I will wait eagerly for your posts :D
---
it’s all good man thank you from saving me from getting roasted from many ppl for one letter lol
---
Yeah, I get quadruple kills with him regularly.
---
MA PULL TH’ETHERNET! 
---
It has been glitched since the day it was released. 
---
Why is We're Gonna Live Forever even on this chart?  
---
Yes, it incentivises hook rescue, but that should already be part of the game. It gives absolutely zero advantage in the game. You can just get 100% more BP's by giving up a perk slot and making 4 saves.  
---
Noe compare it to it's one true counterpart that also potentially gives 100% BP's on the killers' side, BBQ and Chili. Not only do you get all the extra BP's, you get to *see survivor auras* as well.   
---
So WGLF is prettttttttty weak.   
---
I'd also put Empathy a tad higher. Like Alert, it's an immediate identifier of where the killer is.   
---
Calm spirit is also a tad more situational, but will make you a GOD in games with doctor and clown.   
---
Lastly, Urban Evasion is a lot stronger I believe. The face that I can circle objects as nearly the killer's pace means they usually just assume nobody is there and walk away. It's my 'go-to' ability in the game just for that. 
---
Still, people who want to derank an NOT fuck their team over will at least play normally then dc at their end time. Whether they make it or not. So it’s not a huge deal to DC on death hook.
---
Given his nurse on console comment, I THINK he’s just misinterpreting fun to mean an easy game 
---
I regularly get a DC on death hook late in the game so I assume it's to keep items rather than to be salty.
---
I like Spirit
---
You don't keep items when you DC
---
I like nurse
---
Considering your comment, I THINK you misinterpret everything I said because you're definitely in the wrong there. 
---
since the Legion update it's way more often crashes than voluntary but yeah
---
Lol what? You said he’s being dishonest with how he worded things. All I said is I think he believes when people say a fun killer, that they mean one who is easy to beat. No idea why you are acting like an ass.
---
Do you actually hit survivors more than once with frenzy without mixtape or just once then cancel the frenzy and hit em normal?
---
The thing that made it easier was the pallet vacuum change. Survivors have to run the loops crisper than before. The exhaustion perk changes have helped as well. The game is in a better place now ( with exception to  Legion). I play killer and survivor 50/50 and I have enjoyed the game more since the changes.
---
&gt; breaking totems
---
Breaking dull totems doesn't give any progress towards any emblem, only bloodpoints
---
The time window is a bit small compared to some other killers, like hag, you have like half a minute to tag someone after they trigger a trap (and you dont even have to teleport) and still get the phantasm attack BP.
---
Still, you may want to look up your phase walking tracking skills. 
---
Should never have been ported to console imo sounds unplayable from what I've read on here
---
I've done that to the ds survivor before, but never the whole team. 
---
Bloodpoints is more important than any amount of emblem bonus
---
I like turtles 
---
Agree. After she died the movie became wired.
---
Yeah, me and my friends started just saving them up. It happens way too often for it to be a coincidence.
---
Why did I never think of this?
---
That's not an exploit, DCing on the other hand is bannable. 
---
Can’t you also do it by disconnecting from your wifi and reconnecting?
---
very nice
---
Why would they not camp in this scenario
---
When you have good skins but the survivors dont stay to see you :(
---
Where tf was he t-bagging?You mad bro?
---
OP is an unpopular dude apparently lol.
---
Yea, I wish they'd like merge WGLF with We'll Make It, maybe decrease the healing buff a bit to put it on-par with BBQ&amp;C.
---
If you made that, you might consider uploading it to *Wallpaper Engine* on Steam. 
---
[Get it while it's hot!](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/apcxs3/day_25_high_effort_shitpost_time/)
---
Ahhh Noed, yeah it can be like that :V
---
It’s not bad, it’s mid-tier. If you have awareness, you can just activate and get away. I’d rather have Lithe/Balanced where it’s situational, and I can activate it when the killer is on me.
---
yeah looping doesnt work, but imo hiding doesnt work either. following blood stains isnt that hard+deep wound puts you on a timer, so you have to stop sometime and mend.
---
legions design is just frustrating.
---
Lumbago
---
I hate my life
---
Killer has to be host for it to work
---
&gt; Your solution sounds good. Just let them finish and leave. 
---
yeah except they don't. They sit there and want to farm and bully you more. I straight out DC'd a group tonight that tried to do that. I gave them 4 mins to go and power the gates and leave and instead they wanted to try and buzz around me and get me to chase them. Fuck em.. they had a chance, they decided to stay in and be shit bags and draw the game out. If I can go grab a drink, use the bathroom and come back and all 4 of you you in the game.. you deserve the DC.
---
DS is fine, just hit the skillcheck lol.
---
Do you have any idea (pant) how fast I am?  (pant)  **I’M FAST AS FUCK, BOI!!!** (steps into a trap, immediately DC’s)
---
Last time I checked, people find different things fun.

Fuckin hate him and Freddy
---
When meg sees a killer walking over to her
---
Source Filmmaker, friendo.
---
I will still fight to the death that We’re Gonna Live Forever is objectively one of the worst perks in the game.  It LITERALLY does NOTHING to help you.  Using it basically just means that you are playing with only 3 perks instead of 4.  Yes, as an economy perk, it has its uses.  It cuts down on the grind.  But that is OUTSIDE the round.  IN ROUND, you are hurting your team every single time you run WGLF, because you are effectively reducing your team’s number of active perks from 12 to 11.  The only reason it is not the worst perk, when it does nothing at all, is because 1 perk does less than nothing.
---
It's from [this] (https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0) Gilette ad from 4 weeks ago
---
Open this escape. 
---
You did a great job, but my god those player models look dated as fuck. When you take away certain shaders, ambient lighting and post, you’d swear we were playing a game made in 2009.
---
I remember that 3 gen doc...
---
Nice to see a fellow pig! What’s your build?
---
My 2 cents: The nurse is fun to play against because i have a better time juking her. 
---
No jabs at people who don’t like legion, just wondering how “fun” is defined to each individual person. Not easy, no. Easy would be Freddy, IMO
---
You have to be super-uneducated to not understand what plagiarism is. I’ll excuse it if the reposter is like 10 but odds are they’re much older due to reddit having a heavy adult community and a M rating on the game
---
Legit, that was an amazing commercial for a company like that to make.
---
God damn, Nea learned how to fucking pop those Gens with a skillcheck.
---
Cant name shame.

[INSERT MEME OF MERYL STREEP YELLING]
---
honestly I’ve played some games that are just cancer bc people insta dc over being downed or w/e. After so many games its hard not to become one of them. I fight it every day lmao.
---
I don't understand why WGLF is balanced. It doesn't give anything good in game, just bloodpoints after the game. Compared to BBC that gives a bonus ingame is weak as fuck.
---
When you cleanse hex your prestige just go away? 
---
I'm glad you're bragging about that lmao
---
Cancelling Frenzy without any add-ons that reduce that "my hands are dirty" fatigue stun, the survivors gonna get a nice long head-start and you'll end up wasting plenty of time running after them again. 
---
I’m not bragging about it 
---
As a Meg main, I would approve it
---
"Rules for thee but not for me" is basically what it amounts to.
---
If I was that legion I would’ve killed her too just for the raw emotions of betrayal
---
Lmfao, keep telling yourself that, buddy.
---
“Who needs a good game when you have cosmetics?” - someone important I guess.
---
Why is lithe bad? Someone else in the the thread said it was really good. Trying to decide if I should level up for it
---
True, that happens. I've seen it to where survivors expect the killer to have honor, but go ahead with none themselves.
---
Thanks Luigi!
---
Thank you very much! All I can say is practice, if you have the tools! We're all always learning. :D 
---
I don't see anything
---
Honestly, hating people who DC in general.
---
No. It's still an amazing perk.
---
You know he lean AF. Quality protein.
---
He's basically guarenteed his hits if the killer isn't stupid so the survivors just don't have options, and that lack of control is annoying as hell as a survivor, and not only that but it takes the Legion almost twice as long to actually finish the chase so the survivor's options are really just "run in a straight line for 40 seconds and then go down". It's not like Legion is OP but it's the lack of agency om the survivor's part that seriously sucks
---
I'm tqlking about ace in the hole going to waste when you get a firecracker. And plunderers is also quite useless during the event since you'll get firecrackers most of the time with or without it.
---
Thats why the perk slots are wasted during the event. Ace In The Hole is truly wasted, but plunderer's also lost half of it's utility
---
Cosmetic team is gonna make cosmetics regardless of how shitty the game is. That's their job. 
---
It's not like you can take people from the cosmetics team to help program the game. 
---
Borrowed Time is only strong if you are a shitty baby camping killer
---
Splitting up and doing generators is pretty boring for most survivors and in a chase, the is little to no skill involved to catch a survivor.
---
For survivors in a chase, there is no counterplay
---
so theres bot much you can learn from games playing against legion and you wont really improve in getting chased
---
It would fix it sometime. Certain frame rate issues, or rather just lag and connection issues, are host related. Despite the fact skillchecks are client side, that can still cause issues. It's hard to explain, but it's just fucked right now. Dedicated servers would fix movement and other interactions with the game.
---
unless they bait it out at the basement too..
---
I’m trash with flashlight so nailed it
---
what the fuck are you on?
---
I don't know about you but I know from which meat I want his protein. OwO
---
True dat
---
It could have been a Legion or maybe a Doc.
---
Feel diversion should be higher on the list. As long as the killer does not have sight this can break a chase quickly or even prevent one all together
---
Michael is definitely taller

It's harder because disconnecting and reconnecting to WiFi takes time, whereas unplugging an Ethernet cord, then plugging it back in provides instant feedback. If the connection cannot be re-established in a set amount of time, the clients will just assume you left and are not coming back, otherwise referred to as "timing out"

1 in art

1 in gameplay

none of those are bright though

what other currencies are there lol

He sees Freddy eating a kitkat wrong in the corner of his eye
---
Killers pick their games no matter who the survivor is. They have a key? Nope, not this group. 2 of them of Flashlights? Nah, no thanks. 
---
I do get the idea that as the killer, being able to see who the survivors are and what they're carrying is fair. Also, I think not knowing shit about the killer until you see him is fair and adds a little fear factor with jump scares. However, it's not fair that a killer is able to just dip out if they don't like the lobby. I know I'll get downvoted for thinking that any aspect of the game is unfair for survivors, but it's a bullshit mechanic.
---
Frank's Mixtape, and Moonchase.
---
Wow, NOED. I wonder how this extremely talented killer got rank 1 :)
---
It's not only PS4 survivors. Trust me.
---
Encouraging tunneling is a band aid solution.  That's not going to teach him to be a better killer.  You're just setting them up to rely on a shitty crutch way to approach their games.
---
Nurse and hillbilly are probably the best killers imo.  If only I could just play nurse good I would've Mained her but I fell to legion.
---
If you're familiar with the map, lithe can extend or break chases very well, depending on what playstyle you have and the killer's skill level. BL is also good, but it being near useless on certain maps just makes me hesitant to call it the most powerful.
---
Oof
---
Well I played with legion on some high  ranks ( red ranks) and I would say that I actually had fun with him. Maybe not every game was a 4red emblem 4ks but I had a lot of hooks and not so long and painfull chases. So I would say hes more of  a chillbill killer than swf molester.
---
Getting R1 has always been easy
---
Design is great that for sure but gameplay without Frank mixtape/that other one is rather pain. Everyone compare Legion to nurse but nurse don't need ~80 sec to down someone if he knew how to chase. If only base speed would be a little higher, Legion would be one of best killers even without instadown ability.
---
Why is there so much hate for him in this sub?...
---
Try reading any of the hundred posts that are made daily about him that you just referenced and you'll have the answer to that.  It's been answered to death at this point.
---
Horribly designed killer
---
I've played him quite a bit in rank 1. 
---
And if survivors know what they are doing they squish legion.
---
Just boring, you win chase just basically on a timer to win the chase. Boring for survivor boring for killer.
---
To use his power the "right" way is only good if survivors are absolute potatoes. 
---
Full set of chromosones, lmao cracked me up for some reason
---
Honestly I think it's still a great perk, if you see the killer coming let them hit you, activate it and you're practically halfway across the map. Often they'll just give up, and they always give up on me if it's a corn map.
---
Conclusion: **ONLY** prestige if you **REALLY** want the skins.
---
What??
---
Lol I run the killer around for ten minutes and in that time zero generators are completed. Like what the fuck are you guys doing in all that time?
---
Ehh billy is pretty OP if he has the right perks
---
I was playing against Michael Myers and he had hooked one of the other survivors I got to rescue the person and we hear that Michael is on his way back and the guy body blocks the window until Michael strikes me and he eventually hooks me and no one comes for the rescue.
---
Not always, some people play on potatoes. My bud plays at 4-10 fps
---
Insidious Myers
---
Ya but nurse is unbeatable as well as annoying as hell. She takes some skill but if she’s good it’s gg automatically. Also the point is yes he needs to get fixed but it’s annoying seeing literally every single post on this sub just being people whining about it
---
Probably hiding or waiting for you to start a chase with another survivor lol.
---
Mmmhm. Had to watch that part from his VOD; they're accusing the Huntress of hacking because she's one-shotting them. Clearly haven't heard of Iri heads. 
---
Also said that Huntress can one-shot you if she hits you in the head with the hatchets... Like, what?
---
Lol I mean I will play as survivor and my teammates do nothing that whole time the killer is chasing me. 
---
I edited it and is there on steam however someone else did the base editing all I did was add some minor touches that I like but others may not the original is there 
---
Oh, he’s fine then. Newer players will call hacks ang get frustrated quickly. He isn’t toxic.
---
Was this written by a survivor?
---
You mean like survivors ?
---
I like kate
---
The funnest killer in the game.  I always like to use them when I see Twitch streamers enter my lobby so I can tunnel them down and banish them from infesting my game.  I got all out too, Frank's Mixtape and Ebony Mori.  One of the greatest pleasures in the world is visiting their VOD after and watching yourself whoop their ass and listening to them and their SWF team cry about it.  Watching the hope leave their pasty white face as they are downed and executed and go into that low tone voice that sounds like they're speaking to people at a funeral is wonderful.  
---
I’d move balanced landing above dead hard
---
This is why I run bamboozle, more fun :D
---
I like the hatch in the background
---
Doing gens, you?
---
He is 25% slower or something like that when he charges his chainsaw
---
Yes I'm not the only one! Happened twice the other night, once against a Huntress, than a Trapper. It would also play when I was away from the killer and go stop-start when they were nearby.
---
Money, money is why
---
By body blocking, do you mean survivor blocking survivor, or survivor blocking killer? The former is indeed frustrating as heck.
---
^ He probably DC’s all the time
---
I've been trying to get good at Nurse, she's hard to master, but I got my first two kills as her today, that was fun!
---
I love when the post game chat is positive. It makes playing so much more fun.
---
For me it is shit talking on their streams mostly. I try to watch replays of the game and so much garbage comes out of some swf groups.
---
OP load outs for both sides are considered toxic. 
---
Oh damn, you have the link or search terms? I'm actually really curious about that.
---
Great, now we're using "gay" as a slur. Aren't you the classy one. 
---
i personally think it’s fun i almost always survive against them. i don’t get them often cause i usually get a mix of myers, huntress, and the hillbilly with the occasional pig thrown in. but my friends strongly disagree and i don’t really know why cause whenever we go against them we get a lot done and usually escape, probably just the fact that they have frenzy and the deep wounds can be frustrating since you typically get stuck in a chase and then can’t always mend yourself in time 
---
Derankers 
---
He was being sarcastic lmao
---
I'm surprised that when they buffed her last patch that they didn't raise her camera view while crouched. 
---
I hope you get Franklin's demised 
---
That is the thing. Whenever something new releases in any game there will be the people who say "This is bullshit" or "This is the greatest thing to happen." If neither is true, all you hear is silence. If one of the things becomes true, then you will hear: "I SAID IT FROM THE VERY START! I AM SO SMART!"  
---
Not that he improves himself really
---
#HE’S RUNNING STAKE OUT
---
Please. Why would I feel sorry for this tunnelling POS? 
---
No Xbox. WE felt bad for this killer, she saw me first and never stood a chance. We’re both at rank 1 now and it’s happened again tonight as well. I pray for y’all low rank killer if you get us 
---
I love when I play survivor and people kill themselves/disconnect on first hook. Same when I play killer. C'mon I just saw you, don't disconnect right of the bat.
---
Survivor blocking survivor 
---
Doesn't that make the game more eventful? DCing is a pretty weak move. It's not like they're cheating or anything
---
I feel you man.
---
The fact that you placed aftercare above spine chill tells me this isnt a good list.
---
It’s just annoying like if you gonna disconnect at least wait til I get a gen done first I just laugh it off and hope the other survivors are good
---
He's skinnier than he used to. 
---
Looks decent, but Unbreakable is "situationally very strong"
---
lol this is gonna get the salty Claudette mains riled up 
---
Body blocking is fine but a gaggle of Nea's is just obnoxious.
---
pretty much this.
---
Running as a group is actually bad for genrush. It was always worse than 4 people working separately.
---
David is giving me that “I’ll save you from the hook for stacks” look and it’s making me feel some type of way... down there. 
---
Trapper: Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
Very cool graph!
---
Location notifications and Aura notifications are two different mechanics.
---
op wasn't at least
---
Most of the models were made by the same guy ages ago apart from nea and Jeff, like that cosmetic, so I used it
---
So you say it's worth focusing on the down as opposed to spreading out the attacks?
---
Just nea
---
This post was made by the survivor gang
---
You could’ve moved for one. 
---
well DS rewards for doing well because you still have to loop the killer after hitting the skill check. a noob wont get any use out of it meanwhile a skilled player will.
---
So you’re ruining everyone else’s game?
---
Lithe is garbage just because of that
---
are you blind! that cosmetic is so fucking ugly and i tunnel anyone who uses it 
---
Unbreakable, Spinechill, and Kindred are underrated. Selfcare, Sprint Burst, Botany, and Lithe overrated. WGLF should be at the bottom on the line of WEAK. Putting Unbreakable that low is criminal... :/
---
what a brave soldier
---
Close proximity would balance that out for survivors that are nearly invisible trying to hide. Slowing down a character would still bring problems with the 2nd perk as it can be used as a teachable. Imagine a mini bloodlust stacked onto the actual bloodlust tiers. 
---
The lengths people go to make themselves feel better lol.
---
Why would anyone fight you about that?
---
You asked what to do to win as Legion and I explained. I'm not arguing that killers are only strong with their strongest add-ons.
---
Also chasing backwards not an add-on it's an exploit which is why he is busted.
---
This is so true but the last time I said selfcare is shit I got downvoted to oblivion. 
---
ANOTHER LEGION BAD EPIC JOKE XDDDD
---
The luck and aura reading perks are useless tho
---
Let me in, to the camp site?
---
Rank 1 killer here, it's not balanced even if you're high rank, the game is simply one-sided
---
ANOTHER LEGION BAD POST
---
They should be disabled for everyone.
---
Sick to death of people constantly switching characters in the lobby. If I'm a survivor, this tells me: you're a dick; I don't want you on my team; and so I'm out of there. 
---
If I'm a killer, sorry to the others who've waited 15mins for a lobby but you're all getting kicked out. I'm not spending the next 50 seconds watching some easily-entertained moron flicking between all his survivors.
---
r/veryexpectedthanos
---
I think I like them, but I understand the hate for them.
---
So, when they came out I jumped onto the hate train for their cheesy tactics and said that this was the biggest mistake BHVR did after Decisive Strike.
---
But you know, everyone hates being camped and tunneled as well. Unfortunately these tactics can work pretty well but thats not really the killers fault. More a problem with the people playing that way, claiming it to be "optimal" and "efficient". I'll never understand how people value kills more than fun anyway.
---
Franks Mixtape is definitely ridiculous. The iridescent button? I don't know, I don't have an issue with that.
---
So that being said I try to go the combo stab route with them and I really enjoy that. I use discordance to find groups and hinder gen progress, monitor and abuse to get closer to people and have a bigger radius for the stab combos and stridor to search for injured/deep wounded survivors.
---
To down someone I try to chase them regularly or surprise them with monitor + stridor.
---
Ar they a good killer? I don't know. I'd say they are midtier with a low skill ceiling. Pretty easy to get a pip with though, probably because they hit so often.
---
Say, what are your perks? Did you come up with an interesting build that you enjoy?
---
Around *
---
Lol good joke
---
yes and if they're a god nurse then they deserve to win
---
Me too, or somehow the Hillbilly, I had to be like, what's the original thing, oh yeah a woman, oh, ok, that's a blurry Kate.
---
how do i remove somebody else's post
---
internet of tard bros don't like it, so that's why they downvotin' you, sorry.
---
What do i search to find your upload buddy?
---
I'm with you on boring. I think that describes it better than annoying now that you mention it. Annoying is like the hag. He's just boring to play and boring to play against. I played some games as him and he's either stomping or just getting hard stomped. hardly any middle ground and that makes it sooo boring
---
Probably to create one, yes, but to import one into Garry's mod probably isn't that difficult.
---
Just search for dead by daylight in the steam app wallpaper engine and you should see this 
---
Have you tried playing around with your builds/playstyle? 
---
You could try doing Basement Bubba if you want to derank, just put on insidious as Leatherface, find your basement, camp it. Typically the survivors will escape, but then you'll also get the odd game that turns into a 4k because they all deserve the Darwin Award for going down there lol. 
---
Anyway, yeah, it's really difficult to depip. Used to be a lot easier when they first introduced the badge system, but survivors cried about it so they made it easier. 
---
well stop
---
I’m partly Autistic actually 
---
Nah it was neither actually, first one was Huntress, then a Trapper.
---
If youre being serious rn, why do you joke about autism? 
---
It makes me feel better knowing I can joke about it
---
that's true
---
Lol I remember the perma-sabo days... you were forced to run this perk OR to slug everyone :/
---
At first I *hated* Diversion. I thought it was stupid because it had such a short range, but I grew to love it over time, as I realised its strength as a utility really is something, and it has saved me numerous times.  
---
If I'm playing Adam, I'm throwing rocks.
---
Truly a hero, hope you have told how good you are in his steam profile. EZ DUD
---
I guess you could say he "couldn't handle it."
---
You both look stupid. And since you keep replying ExPLaIn to every comment, I will.  Turning and running around the killer IS a 360, therefore he dodged you. I don’t know how you don’t what he was referring to when he said that. Both of your insults are super lame, stuff I would probably expect from kids in elementary school. 
---
Both of you seem pretty pathetic. 
---
Yea, Nea killed it.
---
It was more like a 90 not a 360 and he never dodged me I’m just boosted
---
Sprint burst is good but I’ve been sacrificed so many times because people refuse to run unless they can see the killer. It’s toxic player’s crack 🤢
---
Your comebacks are still really weak. 
---
Just leave Nea alone, she’s beautiful okay
---
My setup is BBQ, Whispers/NC, Ruin, and Sloppy Butcher. Was wondering which one to use. If I take your suggestion and use both, should I replace Sloppy? Sloppy is useful in slowing the game down.
---
havent got any prpgress towards the event for days, i sure am glad i wont finish the event :)))))))))))))))
---
Literally finna
---
Not a comeback he legit didn’t know how to 360
---
Chasing a survivor=crutch. Survivor logic.
---
Yeah but no mither puts a target in your back. Might as well just go and get hit and don't heal if that's how you wanna play
---
Oh yeah lemme just surf youtube and find that real quick.
---
Yet another downvote.
---
Cat: "Sacrifice them for me, hooman!"
---
Lol, We'll Make it is stronger than Borrowed Time.
---
Adrenaline is stronger that Self fucking Care.
---
Leader almost as good as Emphaty.
---
Balanced Landing is one of the best perks in the game AND is not situational.
---
This must be a joke, right?
---
I don't use game slowing perks, so I have enough perk slots for both. My build is BBQ, Whispers, NC, Shadowborn.
---
But if I were to use your build, I'd swap Ruin for Whispers, not Sloppy. I think Sloppy slows game down more consistently than Ruin.
---
We found the DC'er.
---
In chases it isn’t really that big of a help, butttt it’s great for reaching pallets (except when it decides to launch you 50 feet too far) and escaping the basement where a killer is camping. 
---
Would Monitor and Abuse be better than Shadowborn? I'm leveling up the doctor right now to get M and A on Nurse.
---
tbh, same, even if there is a streamer
---
Give Ace Life Is The Good Life
---
gO pLaY fOrTnItE lUl gOt Em
---
Having someone post a shape shifting killer or a killer that can teleport to lockers for the tenth time is not a good idea from the community, the last somewhat good idea was like a year ago and i can't remember who it was about. Other than that,while some of the ideas here sound more fun/balanced than Legion, those other ideas are good only in a vacuum, where none of the game's flaws or mechanics are taken into consideration.
---
spread out your attacks if you wanna lose, if you want dc's and want to be a cunt, cheeze his mechanics
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
I think your sarcastic but if you aren’t then thanks so much hahaha 
---
I’m more hoping someone just loves it as much as me and know which one it is by heart, or maybe sent it to a friend or something lol hoooopefuly 
---
When you hear the DC noise while the camera is still busy showing you your own character...
---
the killer can be stupid and it’ll be the same result as the best killer main ever when it’s legion
---
oh wow thats just sad
---
How does hiding behind gens work? Doesn't it just show your aura through the gen?
---
For me a streamer is like any other player, I did get a interesting lobby the other day, so all 4 of the swf had streamer links has names, at the end of the match (I got a 4k) they started called me tunneler and camper, and used the streamer card saying it all was recorded and I was going to get banned XD, they o sent them a link to what's a bannable offence XD, at the end, 2 of the links weren't real, and the other 2 were offline 
---
The main benefit from higher FOV is to see where survivor runs during post-blink fatigue. Shadowborn gives you higher FOV, and it's constant, while with M&amp;A you get normal FOV in chase (exactly when you want high FOV most).
---
On the other hand, with M&amp;A you get benefits of lower terror radius (NC will be more useful).
---
So, I'd say it's a personal preference. I like Shadowborn more.
---
Past... rank 50? Past 50 bloodpoints? Past level 50? Past 50 likes? 
---
Maybe you got your games confused, my cognitively sub-optimized friend.
---
I mean, I just run it for the shits and gigs but it really has some nice advantages like these
---
I hope you let him farm and escape! No reason to feel bad then.
---
Indeed.
---
Thanks for your reply! Now I can imagine why people usually sell those models instead of giving their hard work away for free like people tend to expect on the 'net.
---
That’s awesome! I’m pretty sure the Trapper panicked too. He was afraid of hitting and downing you instead of grabbing you off the beartrap xD
---
Sad... i'm seeing DC as a really common practice, from both parts (mostly survivors I'd say). What for, anyway? Is there a k/d ratio somewhere that helps ppl boost their self-esteem? Am I missing something? What's the point of disconnecting after 5 minutes of play because I found you, followed you and put you on a hook? People can't lose today?
---
I wish everyone had the mori from the Hag .....just image a Myers eating a shirless David :D
---
I had that on Huntress earlier, it’s a teachable perk!
---
To take a game hostage there needs to be no way for it to end. For example, you body block someone in the basement and refuse to move. There is nothing at all the Survivor can do to try and escape and thus the game is being held hostage.
---
Inb4 they give it to Susie
---
good boah
---
No one is flirting with David -3/10
---
Honestly, pick your poison
---
As killer you can get less points and it feels unfun for you as its incredibly easy to win
---
As survivor, you're put at a stupidly unfair disadvantage if they're running Ruin, BBQ and Chilli, or Whispers. 
---
Its so annoying and anyone who DC's at the start of the match lose all my respect instantly as a player.
---
every billy goes into my ass to chainsaw
---
Botany knowledge, pharmacy, ace in the hole, streetwise/plunderer
---
The counter to bodyblocking is... Hitting the survivor. Like it's that easy. Specifically for hooks, Iron Grasp and Agitation have been in the game since release, and Mad Grit was just released too. If you just mean during a regular chase, then just slap them, then you have TWO injured survivors you can go after. If you think that's a problem, you don't REALLY care about body blocking, you're just one of those people who tunnels one survivor till death, and literally everyone (survivors and other killer mains) hate you.
---
You literally just described how moonwalking legion works: purposefully avoid chases whilst following the survivor till they bleed out. It's literally an exploit.
---
Enduring and Rancor both counter DS. So do Clown and Nurse. You can also just slug, or ignore the obsession and chase someone else, and you can easily juggle them too. Or, hey, just take the hit. It's really not that bad lmao.
---
You call people children, but you're way less emotionally developed than anyone else in this thread. Name calling, and not seeming to understand how a community works. Regardless of whether you agree with it or not, you're part of the DBD community, since you play the game, and if you purposefully do shit that everyone else is in agreement with is shitty, people are gonna look down on you. That's how a society works. EVERYONE agrees that moonwalking legion is bullshit, unfun, and has no place in the game, and if you keep exploiting in the same way, you're going to alienate everyone.
---
'round* 
---
English colloquialism. We do mean "around" but accents, informal speech we say 'round.
---
Aye lad. 
---
I'm a Southerner, and I've always spoken 'round instead of around.
---
  
---
i’ve bought every cosmetic for all the non licensed female characters with cells. also like 40 out of 49 for dwight. one day i’ll have them all ^^
---
as a claudette my blood is boiling right now man
---
I would put it at strong but heavily situational myself, because it's pretty strong to get to a safe spot when you are at an unsafe gen/place
---
I'm waiting for my buddy to bring in the shirtless David model and then things will change my friend, just wait 👀😂
---
This is final destination isn't it?
---
Wait so does my luck perk works on chests? 
---
\&gt;calling people bimbos just cause you get downvoted 
---
why
---
This one got me lmao 
---
upvoted for eric andre
---
well i think it's balanced as long as they're not using noed or ruin. a 'good' nurse can still get gen rushed and juked like any other killer.
---
source: i've learned nurse
---
My mistake, read it as 34metres.
---
dude you have talent.
---
Which kind of painting is this? I felt pretty inspired with yours, so i'll look for some YouTube tutorials when I get some spare time. Looks fun to do such thing
---
You can fake leaving the hook straight away or just try to look in usual places where they would hide behind rocks etc.
---
Face camping cause killer doesn't know how to counter looping or doesn't know how to stop chasing 👌😂
---
was talking about party streamers XD
---
This looks like one of the family photos where Nea is the edgy teenager and Bill is the angry Vietnam grandpa who only talks about war stories and complains about kids on his lawn.
---
Dwight looks like the older brother of Nea who is busy at work and didn’t have time to change clothes for the picture.
---
I want more to this story, carry on 😂😂
---
Ahahah 
---
I personally like to the following in my rotation:
---
- Ace in the Hole, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Botany Knowledge, Kindred, Lithe, Pharmacy, Plunderer's Instinct, Prove Thyself, Resilience, Spine Chill, Streetwise, Unbreakable, We'll Make It
---
Other perks that could be fun: 
---
- Bond, Borrowed Time, Dance With Me, Deliverance, Sprint Burst, Urban Evasion, and Windows of Opportunity. Self-Care is alright but it takes way too long for my tastes.
---
I also tend to use perks that synergize with items I'm using. I'd never use Streetwise with a key, map, or flashlight, Pharmacy with a medkit, Prove Thyself without a toolbox, etc.
---
23/59 decent survivor perks is alright but I agree that they should tweak more of the perks to make them appealing. Some of them like Hope and Dark Sense sound really cool but just aren't strong enough to be useful all that much. I like that they are revisiting some perks now to rework them. Only a few perks have actually been improved in usefulness, but it's a start I guess.
---
There really isnt that many good perks though.
---
It's easier to just DC at the start of the match, because the result is the same and you won't get banned for it.
---
People who DC on death hook are definitely salty
---
what? theyre just healing up before picking you up, makes it alot safer
---
name checks out
---
Adam and Tapp are both gay couples who adopted Claudette and are training her. Adam teaches her how science (how to make an invisible potion) and Tapp teachers her how to be completely invisible since he’s a cop.
---
Laurie and David are the parents of Dwight, Nea, and Meg. Laurie is your regular Facebook soccer mom with the mom jeans. While David is an alcoholic dad who visits the pub every night and gets into fights. Always pushes Dwight to be a man and gives him shit for hiding in the closet, crying his woes away.
---
Quentin is just the druggie uncle from David’s family side. Probably schizophrenic.
---
i feel like that can be said for both sides but more for survivor i wish they would take the most under rated perks and give them massive buffs so we dont see the same thing every game pretty much every killer has ruin  and bbqc and survivors are running sb and adrenaline 
---
Ok, well if you get that it's considered normal in basically the mainstream website of the internet,  shouldn't you get how this is something that is considered a mistake? If this was laws in a specific country,  I could see you having a case for being so upset. It isn't though. You can call it stealing,  but that's not even factual. Stealing, things on the internet at least, isn't a repost. You have to be taking credit. Anyone who does this reposting thing should be given the benefit of the doubt, unless they blatantly say it's their own. Not shitted on because they don't know the rules. 
---
No.
---
Also, basement stairs.
---
Love it 😂 thank you
---
I can understand that someone put their time and effort into it, but I know I'd like my stuff to go mainstream. Someone could repost my dead by daylight gameplay and I'd be happy about it. But if someone took credit for it...well that's different
---
I dont think its overly strong if they moonwalk. You can make good plays because you have to remember that they dont see you and basically have to walk blindly. If you take a right or left turn and dont run in a straight line they can lose you very easily. If the killer tries to see where you went they can accidentally activate the chase again. 
---
My heart was on fire. He had been camping the hatch. And i was injured, so i had to finish 2 gens to get adrenaline.
---
I literally just played against a killer who said they picked legion just to make someone DC, which someone did. When i asked them about it (with no hostility or toxicity) they said "just playing a game, just get over it kid, lol" then left.
---
bruh, if you really think "spartan" would be good for the game you must be a rank 15 legion main that used noed and facecamps but still gets 1 kill
---
No problem lol. I had fun making this. I appreciate your enthusiasm.
---
Personally I’d swap purple all seeing and silent bell, the only advantage silent bell has over bone clapper is reaction time for the survivors (outside of that silent bell and bone do the same thing)
---
its shit now, its like 32 seconds to sc, with sloppy its like 40, legit, i used to rely on sc, now i never run it
---
not what the legion needs, he needs to be removed
---
Can't you accept that BT is a bad perk against Doc? It's like if Doc mains complained that Calm Spirit fucks them up and should be nerfed. A lot of survivor perks and killer abilities have sitatuations where they get naturally countered. BT vs Doctor and Leatherface, Object of possession vs Wraith, Urban evasion vs Hag, it goes on. Doc's power shouldn't be 'fixed' because it counters a SINGLE perk, aswell other survivor perks shouldn't be changed because they counter the killer's (only) power.
---
He buff was half the buff he needed, his old addons were pure trash, now he only has one genuinely bad one (blind warrior mud and it’s useless blind)
---
But his base kit is still very weak even with built in windstorm, he needs faster ms in cloak and action speed in cloak built in, to let him actualy snowball properly and leverage his stealth better.
---
Meg has a innocent look, she's pretending 
---
My whole team every game lmao. Im so sick of it. 
---
And no, don't get mad over BM, you'll just play worse, always think of BM as the survs just playfully fucking around (it also often is). 
---
But...Pizza Dwight?
---
I got fengs shirt and head but that skirt reminds me of something an old lady would wear and I just can't bring myself to buy it lmao
---
#Notallwraithstunnleandcamp
---
It’s just crybabies who don’t understand the game most of the time. 
---
I’m a bit ashamed to admit I’ve definitely spent $100+. I have a lot of Meg cosmetics + cosmetics for the event I missed (hallowed blight) and the current one which I bought the cosmetics for because I didn’t really want to work at getting them through the event. I mostly mess around on the game, so games where I actually survive are pretty rare. In other words, the event would’ve been hell if I actually tried to have fun while playing.
---
lmao, really?
---
And which cosmetic would you reccomend for the ladies, I cant decide between skirt Nea or something on Meg.
---
I think you should put Synergy Dependant instead of Synergistic in order to avoid confusion.
---
The Kate perk that increases whiggle (don't remember the game right now) is TERRIFYING if theres a sabo jockey in the team. I've been on the receiving end. Not pretty.
---
Also I think Spine Chill is better than Premonition, and I've been using premonition forna long time. What made me change is Premonition randomly popping from nowhere when the killer is looking around. It makes you waste time because you think he's coming so you are basically mindgaming yourself. When you realize this, every time it pops it's a paranoid situation "Is he really coming? Or did he just look around?", and fornthe entirety of the cooldown you're left vulnerable.
---
While Spine Chill basically gives you like a discount aura reading ability, since you can tell how the killer is moving by how the perk pops. No cooldown, so you know when the killer is coming and when he's looking around: if it pops on and off intermitently he is close but not coming your direction, if it stays popped more than one second he's coming. It also gives a nice boost to repair speed, which makes the perk much more visual when repairing gens and lets you commit to a gen in certain situstions
---
Spine Chill is a bit more difficult to use because you have to be aware of it and needs a bit of reading understanding to get its max potential, while Premonition is much easier to use but has a lot of downsides compared to Spine Chill.
---
I don't play for kills. If I got 4 BBQ stacks, had some fun chases, grabbed someone off a gen (Pig main here) - that was a good game.
---
Teabags? I don't care as long as I think I'm playing good. If I'm clearly underperforming, yeah, it can be tough.
---
So, I think the main thing is to remember it's just a video game, it's ok to lose sometimes, and your main goal is to have fun.
---
And which outfit is your favourite. I am also keen to buy something with money, but then the game pisses me off super hard with crashing or some bug and I change my mind.
---
Yes lol. I spose though that high cut that shows her thigh makes it a little less senior citizen-ey. 
---
Like omg match it with her cardigan cosmetic or one of the long sweater jersey cosmetics and you'll be like holy shit I've turned feng into an old lady lmao
---
Im at 8 +100 points with about 2-3h playtime per day
---
( most on killer because of the survivor q times)
---
Tar really doesn't do much aside from grass traps.
---
We all know the real counter to Legion
---
Id literally rather be Insidious camped by a LF or destroyed by a god Nurse than have to play against a Legion. 
---
If its a Spirit and theres no Ruin theres NO justification on Earth for you cleansing a lit totem.
---
Perk: The Dragon Scroll
---
Looking at a survivor causes them to be teleported onto a hook, entering struggle phase instantly.
---
the thigh highs skirt is hella cute on nea
---
I got 6 coins for Ace and Huntress. Likely to get the 7th coin by Wednesday, but no way be able to get all 9 unless I'm playing all day everyday. 
---
With that said, the long lobby wait times makes this less achievable. Hopefully they will compensate this by extending the event until the end of the week. 
---
Cancel Frenzy works better than multiple hits with frenzy, but only with add-ons.
---
Maybe playing killer is the secret to getting it done sooner... you might be on to something lol 
---
It is isnt it. But then I would have to buy the mean streets jacket too 😩. My shards, but better than buying legion I guess.
---

---
I really like this channel for DBD funny moments, but they speak english intermittently but it's fully subtitled. 100% recommended.
---
I really hope so. They've extended past events for less. 
---
Or if your following a survivor to the hook and he unhooks in your face, you target the unhooked to punish the bad play, now he has an extra health state because DW wont tick down if you chase him.
---
BT did not need a buff.
---
Sounds like you need to work on yourself as a person. Try to figure out shy you feel like shit when you "lose" and work on that.
---
[https://imgur.com/3fVflOc](https://imgur.com/3fVflOc)
---
lmao I want my tasty 1000 bloodpoints. 
---
anyway if I don't cleanse it, then someone else will and I'll lose out on points.
---
Same!
---
then hit the person who's unhooking??? bruh?
---
and spine chill is underrated, not worth using over more meta perks, but still useful vs pigs/wraiths/Myers and it hard counters spirit
---
Honestly there’s not a TON you can do. Sometimes you just need to remember that in the end it’s a game. If you feel yourself get triggered at all, just go take a break for 5-10 minutes before hopping into your next match because when you go into a match feeling triggered you’re no gonna play at the top of your game.
---
Alternatively, if you feel yourself getting triggered you could try some meme builds and have some fun with the survivors. The best way to get into your head that not every game NEEDS to be a win, is to play builds where you’re not meant to win, but you get to have fun with it too so it’s not like you’re just standing still all match.
---
if used right it can turn a 15 second chase into a 3 minute chase if a survivor uses it to garentie a pallet/window when they otherwise would of gone down and then continue the looping from there.
---
I'm on the gen while the survivor loops the killer into me. I have no interest in playing distract the killer because that ends up with me on the hook with no rescue while the survivor who threw me under the bus is free to escape, doesn't happen at the the 10+ ranks.
---
Guess higher ranks just expect us to play chicken with the killer when my perks arent built for that
---
1000 BP for potentially killing your teammates and yourself. Seems like a good deal.
---
Appreciate the offer but im good
---
IMHO, probably a combination for ego/rage.  To be honest, a few weeks ago I DC'd intentionally for the first time as survivor because I was fed up with a Freddy tunneling me.  Combined with a not-so-great day, I decided I had enough and wanted out, even though I'd be missing out on BPs and derank.  It also doesn't help that I get aggrevated from toxic SWF teams while playing killer.
---
Dark Souls 3 has a system that pairs banned (not perma obviously) players together when online
---
I mean the few killers that you can find probably do not want to deal with a squadette in the match they finally found
---
As a killer I just hunt them for a while, hook everyone 1-2 times, and then let everyone escape. Most of the time you still pip, and nobody has to be salty.
---
This reminds me of an ancient meme from this sub that could be a sequel to this one.
---
Survivor: * flashlight clicks once*
---
Killer: **COWABUNGA IT IS**
---
I don't understand how people see this as an ok thing to do...
---
perfection 
---
Specialized builds just arent good though is the problem.
---
Q&amp;Q can make for some interesting mind games, but at you use it the killer adapts making the perk lose value. BT is pretty good, but provides no personal utility so isnt great for solo queue. Well make its fast healing is nice but the time gain isnt relevant enough to make it worth running, yeah it doubles your heal speed, but half of the time you spend healing with it is not going to be a lot of time. Dance with me, is kind of a memey stealth perk and doesnt work without synergy which is a huge negative. Diversion is literal trash. Bond is an alright perk, team knowledge is conveniant but not usually game changing. Empathy is the same story. Perhaps the worst thing about most of these perks is how situational they are. Well make it most of the time saves maybe 20-40 seconds, but can save minutes occasionally, for example.
---
Paying attention is hard isn't it?
---
Yes, the **great** ideas from this community like:
---
- Buffing Legion's Speed to 115%
---
- Buffing Hag's Speed to 115%
---
- Underpowered AF Killer that Shapeshifts into a Survivor (only with like 40 variations)
---
- Overpowered AF Jason
---
- Freddy Rework ideas that are always the same shit that will actually help nothing but make the Killer even more gimmicky
---
- Either compleatly busted OP or stupid gimmicky UP perks
---
- OC Survivors do-not-steal with variations of already exsiting perks
---
- Jack-Of-All-Lockers Killer that uses and abuses them for doing literally nothing.
---
- Removing Legion's Double Stun (WHICH THEY ACTUALLY DID AND WE ALL CAN SEE WHERE IT LEAD)
---
And many, many more variations of the same shit. This community is almost as out of touch with the metagame and the actual high level of play of this game as the developers sometimes show, except this sub doesn't have the ability to change jackshit (THANK FUCK FOR THAT).
---
don't see why your geting down voted, the info from rancor is why its so good on spirit/hag/Freddy the instadown mori is a bonus to them
---
Weak btw
---
100%
---
Some survivors are annoying 
---
Go for the one that surely has 2 health states? Sure.
---
If I'm not camping and a dumbass loops me to the hook then unhooks with no nearby gate in my face I shouldn't be punished for their bad play.
---
Ever have someone who disconnects when you hit them? Fun times
---
spies from the shadow are better that whispers imo
---
well if you hit them while they're unhooking then you'll get a quick down afterwards 
---
that's your bad play
---
when did he get buffed?
---
Did you end up cleansing the totem?
---
I think synergistic and situational shouldn't be each others oposites. Take for example sole survivor. It's indeed very synergistic, but you aren't gonna tell me it's not situational
---
Its going to get rought I watch a few streamers and they say "gg" and or compliment them. Then they make it a point to even come in streams to harrasse them. Few streamers you can tell after weeks it gets to them.  They only time I have seen anyone get banned was on ps4. so my tip would be start a new game or buy some spackle and paint for the holes in your wall.
---
I don't remember the exact time of the video because i had it recorded for a while now, but depending of how close it was to rank reset it should be around 10. It definitely is not Rank 19 or something, also you would think that after the Flash and taking the First Hit she would leave, no reason to stay or provoke at that point.
---
Just because the players know that doesn't necessarily mean the devs know that.
---
Devs don't get a lot of time to play their own game. The In-House Meta is usually different then the one out in the "wild".
---
So, it's ok to cheat/exploit the game?
---
Cause that's what it is when a survivor DCs to give hatch to another. You're using a game mechanic in an unintended way to give an advantage to your teammate.
---
this is in the case where they are far enough ahead that you cant go for two easy swings
---
It's what I was thinking, in that scenario I had been farmed by a david was going to be my 3rd hook.
---
How is that guy supposed to know you're there
---
I’m straight but also want David daddy open me uwu 
---
ohhh you mean the ultra rare situation that occurs in like 1% of games
---
ok
---
Because we either spawned together, or worked on the gen together. I'm not complaining about the survivers who have no way of knowing. Im angry and salty about the ones that do know and that do it every game.
---
Theres already plenty of runners and loopers and people not on the gens. Don't drag me into running with the killer
---
I didnt say "tryhard". Other dead guy and me were point farmed by a david and last guy was getting stuff done. 
---
Lithe as a concept is a decent perk, but the fact that it only works when in a chase, when chase mechanics are already dicey and inconsistent, makes the perk terrible. 
---
And when you get chased you go down within 10 seconds. What rank are you?
---
To be fair, you can just equip Franklin's Demise rather than just avoid a group of survivors for having a key and map or 4 flashlights. That's what I always do, at least. Even then, I think that many games against SWF survivors end up being pretty interesting so I see no reason as to why I'd want to avoid. People shouldn't be able to be this picky considering that it's an online game :/
---
My favorite type of survivors are those who try to be toxic and get owned by the killer, then miss their decisive strike and rage DC.
---
I’m pretty sure he estimated rather than kept a log.
---
Myers is a really fun killer to play imo. As is Freddy.
---
Hey Laurie doesn’t look like a goat in this
---
True my issue is every legion I play proxy camps a hook and if you are not in SWF at least one or two people dont do gens and just wait for legion to leave and he never does.
---
At this point if its legion I dont even go for the hook save. Sucks but otherwise the legion gets 3 or 4ks and continues to do it.
---
That my friend, is because legion is bad 
---
I was never seeing jojo references in DBD
---
This is v cool, nice one!
---
I run super heal Claud, Purple med kits, WMI, BK BT &amp; SC to tank hits in case I can't get to hook fast enough and my team didn't have BT
---
I wish it was just some. 
---
I just make silly meme builds and have fun with it.
---
Same. Every time the killer has rancor the game just has to pick me as their obsession...2 days ago I was playing with my brother and we went against a Billy with rancor, me being his obsession. He chainsawed me and picked me up but a Kate came out of nowhere and got hit. He then decided to drop me and go for her instead but my brother popped the last gen at that very moment so he rushed back to kill me :') Also had a rancor Billy who slugged me for 2 gens, standing over me to wait for the mori...and then he noed the remaining 2 survivors too :')))
---
Thin line between love and hate.
---
Just had a killer do this in one of my games a few days ago, people fuckin suck. 
---
The other guy got downed and immediately picked up on the other. Side of the map 
---
You are the problem. Gtfo. 
---
moonwalks, legions who stare at the floor, etc.
---
Bloodpoints can be spent to get you better (or worse) perks depending on RNG.
---
The gist is to find 3 gens in a section of the map that are relatively close together to lock down and patrol them.  So, when it comes down to the last 1-2 gens, the survivors are forced to that section of the map, making it very hard to complete the last couple to power the exit gates.
---
When I say broken I mean I thought it literally didn't do anything at all. That's what I heard from a Trapper friend and a couple streams anyway but I have no idea if that's just hearsay.
---
Pretty hot save.
---
I figured, but this is the first game I've ever played that causes this, and ive played plenty of super fast paced fps's
---
/s? :D
---
I'm glad I gave up on this event before having a mental breakdown trying to obtain the third coin.
---
that's a cruel thing to do 
---
In that scenario yesterday it was the david who was hook farming could and was construed as working with the killer. So I equaled the playing field. So yes it was seen as a grey area and you know that grey areas are a matter of opinion. Calling it a exploit is your opinion as it was a altruistic dc and not a rage quit.
---
Cruel? Yes. Funny? Also yes. ;)
---
That’s on wallpaper engine hmmm
---
There is only one TRUE dirty Billy challenge; NASCAR Billy. Map permitting obviously.
---
No
---
Cross reference this with the amount of Legions and Spirits you face.

* Autodidact ---&gt; garbage

* widows of opportunity ---&gt; terrible unless u're a new survivor,

than this might be an amazing perk.

* self-care best survivor perk... sits lower than dstrike or dead hard or even shitty balance landing?
---
this list is so bad, this is for sure a low rank survivor list.
---
Rotten fields + hillbilly + double turn add-ons = Driftbilly
---
 Ez Pz. Sounds like a baby killer. You rolled that mother fucker
---
I really doubt it this time. The problems at the start were fixed fast and the longer you have to grind the less money they will get. 
---
DH above SB, ok
---
Because you're just impatient. I have yet to witness a true infinite loading screen. They all eventually finish loading. 
---
That convienent timing.
---
I didn't know that people ran Alert, is it worth it?
---
God imagine needing to heal. This comment made by No Mither Gang.
---
I said stop commenting.
---
It is not an opinion. DCing is a bannable offense, not a tactic. I'm done with this discussion...
---
I get the joke
---
Probably pretty close to $100 perhaps, $10 here, $5 there, it soon adds up over time.
---
I probably buy a cosmetic as a way to get me to play that character, for example, this weekend I got the Scoutmaster Hillbily cosmetic, so I could equip the steering add-ons and play drunk scout master billy.....
---
what
---
I haven't seen a single good idea for new game mode. So... no.
---
Watch people doing the flying glitch and getting shot down by Huntress
---
Lagswitch
---
but we need bugfixes and reworks too??
---
The Windstorm/Shadow Dance Combo is easily my favorite. Means I don't have to waste slots on Iron Maiden or Brutal Strength. Not that those are bad perks, but they aren't great for Wraith.

the links didnt work

never happens to me, not when i heal nor when i get healed.
---
Survivor running me to hook, pallet slams me near hook *unhooks* whilst I'm behind the pallet
---
it happens plenty
---
that literally never happens to me probably because i don't camp 
---
r/woosh
---
PlayStation, don't think it has that feature. 
---
I really like the monthly resets. It gives you a good goal and something else to play for. 
---
This comparison makes no sense. As a good killer you're still fully capable of downing survivors and keeping pressure against SWF. As a good survivor, you're going down to Legion just as fast as a bad one, and that's what's shitty about Legion. When survivors complain about Legion, it's because it's genuinely unfun and not what DbD is about. Killers complain about SWF because they're bad.
---
Tbagging, flashlight clicking don't hurt your ability to play the game, like Legion does. And if the survivors really have no skill, then even though they might DS you, they won't last long. 
---
Keep practicing because I always Max my Deviousness Bloodpoints by the time i've Sacrificed at least 2 Survivors.
---
this one time i was loading into a killer game when my pc crashed. i turn it back on, start dbd and suddenly my killer rank is 3 pips lower. who knows anymore.
---
Daddy! 👍🏻
---
Legion is definitely not properly implemented, but I really like the idea behind the killer(s) and I think they look really cool. 10/10 would buy the Susie blue hair DLC again. 
---
or just remove legion, problem solved.
---
I like Nea.
---
Are you really a Spirit main? If yes, then why are you complaining about SWF?
---
This doesn’t even make sense
---
Those add ons tho lol
---
who needs selfcare when youre a killer main?
---
Could be that it’s just human nature to be frustrated with yourself when you feel like you’re coming short of where you should be.
---
That sounds really fun.
---
Doesn't really help that much when you're being chased already, though.
---
Imagine being someone who can't run the killer around complaining about people who are capable  and might bring the killer near to you... Maybe the person who's being chased has no other place close enough to go than the place you are? But no, he should get hit or go down instead of disturbing you.
---
I feel like the third one would benefit more the 32 meter killers than the lower ones,simply because 26% of 32 is over 8 meters,so it would be like a monitor and abuse,while 26% of say 16 (tier 2 miers) would barely be like dead rabbit,unless it applys BEFORE monitor and abuse,in which case it would be good on most killers
---
I'm not condemning or condoning it. That's just the way it is. I don't de-rank, but from the perspective of someone who does, that's the easiest way. 
---
When I see someone DC as a killer, I only laugh my ass off. Because I am a Doctor main and every single salty survivor who DCs only brings me joy.  
---
I think I need to start playing Legion to get more of such "fun".
---
thank for not taking the game so seriously and happy cakeday
---
Yea,it would make infinite tombstone myers more powerful and catapult him to S tier probably (cuz let's be real,a 114% killer that can mori you at any time if he gets near is not fair)
---
I proudly DC when I get tunneled or feed. Those players and their "experience" can go fuck themselves.
---
again and? i already said bhvr should increase the penalty for dcs, go with the overwatch aproach every dc keeps reducing the exp you gain
---
Nurse could chase like normal killers,doctor wouldn't lose speed while on shock mode,legion would be impossible to dodge cuz 140% movespeed,wraith would become sonic after an uncloak,myers with tombstone,etc.
---
You should've made the tunneled survivor the pig. Still great tho!
---
I  totally agree
---
Had this happen, just saved a dwight, saw another get hooked, turn round, gates sealed, with dwight on the other side &lt;.&lt; so i try to lure killer away, get caught other person is unhooked they decide to leave (cant fault em for that, killer hit em) made more annoying as i found a rainbow map in a chest which i died with, really shoulda left when i had the chance
---
How did you know I had we'll make it on my Quentin?
---
Pebble time 
---
That's it I'm getting me mallet
---
I get dc hooks when the killer is face camping 
---
Because it is another perk taken by chad survivor mains, like Borrowed Time
---
Maybe you were misunderstood. I’d say it’s a good perk to use because survivors gain so little bloodpoints so WGLF helps with that. BUT obviously when we’re talking about how the perk helps objectively, it does nothing. 
---
Gonna get 8 today. Don't think I will get the 9. Played for 2-3 hours a day last week
---
I tried that once. 2 DCs at the beginning. Figured I'd just kill the other 2 real quick. 
---
First guy I hook, put in basement. He manages to yeet himself off. So obviously I couldn't kill him after that. Killed the other guy then found the hatch and rev'd chainsaw until he finally showed up.
---
What i do as a killer: IF i see a survivor going to farm his ally i will ignore the unhooked and tunnel the farmer,if i'm playing with a mori they will be the first target,and if they get farmed afterwards i down both if possible
---
Against good survivors, they don't. A good Nurse is almost guaranteed not to lose, but a consistent 4k has not been my experience playing as a Rank 1 Nurse, Rank 1 survivor, or watching some of the best players when they stream as Nurse.
---
Even if you're hooking survivors fairly quickly, one after the other, that doesn't stop 2 people from being able to crank out gens incredibly fast.
---
Currently at work so can't check it out right yet. Personally I prefer edited gameplay (how the youtuber monto or no0b3 make there content) mainly cutting a 15 minute game down, getting rid of the boring bits of gameplay I don't need to see someone do an entire generator. Not much for montages. They're never all that impressive as anyone can cherry pick their best moments and make themselves seem halfway competent in the game. Just one guys opinion on the whole thing do what you want and makes you happy.
---
It’s not griefing it’s just a dick move. 
---
When you see the toxic David get downed, use ds, downed again, then dc. 
---
Kono Dio Da!
---
I'm pretty sure they answered in a QA during a stream that it is griefing to bleed them out like that
---
If you want to know the most fun and unfun i can tell you the 2 to watch out for
---
Most fun (albeit dangerous for health): jumpscare game myers
---
A myers with 0 terror radius that has wallhacks but is just barely faster than nurse,winning purely off of surprise attacks,thanks to the game he can see most of the map all time
---
The most unfun: Worldwide game doctor
---
A doctor with what feels like 6000m terror radius with add-ons and perks to make escaping almost impossible,add the fact the game is so small and you will be there for atleast 20 minutes
---
I don't think I've ever seen, I don't know, Zubat or Marth (when Marth still played) get anything less than a 3k and hatch, or a 4k when playing Nurse. There is no such thing as a good survivor when you're a good Nurse.
---
If you don't camp, tunnel and use moris like a douchebag, please expect GGs from survivors. Those kind of killers are rare and awesome. 
---
What?! You mean the novelty of a 2v8 that comes up every few weeks with various handicaps introduced by most of the community to keep it "fair, fun, and balanced" doesn't appeal to you? 
---
I agree with you completely, I'd rather the already small community (on console anyways) not be divided with some other spaghetti code second game mode. Rather just see tweaks and different objectives added to the core game.
---
The horizontal axis doesn't even make sense. It can't be a scale if they have nothing to do with one another.
---
Hmm...Overall I agree with a lot of this. Deliverance being the by far most situational perk but also potentially not that weak if you hit that sweet timing right.
---
One thing that bothers me tho, is how "low" Distortion is in comparasion to other perks. Especially when I take a look at fucking Alert.
---
I understand that Distortion heads more to the situational direction as it requieres the Killer to have certain perks for Distortion itself to make sense. Regardless of the fact that you see ANC and BBQ literally every game. Or atleast one of both.
---
But seeing perks like Botany and Distortion being lower than Alert triggers me more than I expected to be honest. Sure, they've buffed Alert. But the fact that it's overall function is so extremely niche shouldn't cause it to be around the top 10 Survivor perks. Not at all.
---
Once being chased you won't have that much from Alert anyway if you ain't at a very mindgame-heavy spot while the Killer does some extremely random movements. Sitting on a gen just to see the Killer kicking another from several miles ago doesn't make it better either as once you've done the gen you're currently working on, the other gen might already been degressed entirely, or atleast almost, which makes it atleast equally efficient to head for a gen that might be in closer proximity. Even tho this depends on the Killer and Map, obviously I won't do all of those 4 gens on Azarovs on one side against a well-equipped Doctor or Hag.
---
Meanwhile Botany had probably the most absurd power-spike in DbD perk-history with the healing-time requiered not just being increased by 25% but also the total med-kit charges being buffed, caused it to improve much more than just those 13% it appears to be. While also buffing med-kits overall, which's nice considering how dominant toolboxes used to be.
---
I mean maybe I exeggarate, but I just think Alert shouldn't be that high in comparasion to other perks.
---
*ascended ace* : "unhooking to have them take a hit with borrowed time"
---
Why pig may I ask?
---
If you farm off someone who didn't want to get farmed, you are a cunt. The person who quit the game was right in doing so. 
---
Holy crap. How lucky. I'm so jealous right now.
---
But NOED is a dull totem until the gates are powered and no one will risk it to go back in and search the entire map for that one lit totem knowing that they gonna get insta downed.
---
Don't worry about it, let the sweaty boys be salty.
---
Already probably bored of the game. Pissed at the meta. Or bad idk
---
Well, I am not telling that this is safe. Althought the Killers mostly jerk around the hook, so a quick run for pair of totems you remember is ok, unless you are playing against a Nurse.
---
I had fun against Legion once, they stood still while we did whatever all match. That was fun!
---
What was that?
---
That requires a chest still to be up and in range. Looking for a remaining chest is probably more time consuming that healing immediately with self care if out of a chase.
---
Playing against him: Run around things when he's about to charge.  
---
Playing has Billy: Start with short range chainsaws and then move to medium, far distances, get on top of the survivor and chainsaw him, remember that you can aim freely before it charges.
---
Finished two days ago. Played every day since it started knowing the goal was 300 points pwr day. Playing survivor helped speed that along so every day I pushed a little bit past what I needed.
---
Still feeling burnt out on the game though. Probably will take a break until the next chaptwr.
---
the chances are very very low, but if you do get banned then the devs can’t and won’t help you.
---
It's not ruined ... it's just higher difficulty. If you can't handle it then you're a filthy casual and you didn't deserve me in your game anyway 
---
still bad get a pc
---
As a Doctor main, I’m used to this, I’m usually friendly to the 1 or 2 survivors who were left in the dust
---
&gt;The counter to bodyblocking is... Hitting the survivor.
---
And you neglect the fact that the injured Survivor -who is being protected by the blocker- gets away...
---
&gt;ENDURING and Rancor both counter DS. So do Clown and Nurse. You can also just slug, or ignore the obsession and chase someone else, and you can easily juggle them too. Or, hey, just take the hit. It's really not that bad lmao.
---
Yeah, we're done here. Just another dude running around with this false narrative "You can counter it with Enduring!" When no, you can't. Not unless they're literally nowhere near more pallets or windows in about a 20-30 meter radius. Rancor, okay, is kind of sort of maybe a counter... That has tons of downsides to it like being forced to ignore the Obsession until the end game, or just hit them once and chase someone else. You guys always seem to think that's fine -for some reason- that if the other Survivors aren't the Obsession DS and getting chased, hooked, and killed that that's totally fine. It's fine that someone else is being pursued by the Killer because a douchebag has his crutch perk that literally lets him get away for free.
---
The rest of the nonsense doesn't need to be addressed because it's been addressed a million times before and people like you are essentially Flat Earthers. You reject inconvenient facts in favor of some nonsense that only you and a cult actually believe. 
---
&gt; EVERYONE agrees that moonwalking legion is bullshit, unfun, and has no place in the game, and if you keep exploiting in the same way, you're going to alienate everyone.
---
Really? By "everyone" you mean you and a bunch of crybabies? Just like when "everyone" agreed Freddy was OP and was un-fun an should be nerfed, right? Nah son, you can cry all day and all night over Legion and I doubt Behavior is going to bend over backwards yet again for you crybabies. 
---
Had a game against a Nurse at Rank 1. Potato gets pulled off a dull totem and then DCs because "dOn'T wAnT tO pLaY aGaInSt SwEaTy TrYhArD nUrSe" The thing is the Nurse wasn't even that good and also had a really shitty build (using Thanataphobia instead of Ruin lol.) It's just that 3 players against Nurse on a fairly shitty map isn't exactly a fair fight.
---
Everyone agreed to report the DCer.
---
Every perk is a "crutch" because you aren't forced to run perks and it makes your game easier. Are you going to tell me not needing a second teammate to raise your health state isnt a crutch? BBQ especially is a crutch because **it literally tells you where people are**
---
might be fake, dont care.. i just wanna kill
---
That signal recently changed. The jumping jacks like that meant at one point to come and save me. The signal for camping was to press like you were attempting to try and jump off but letting go before actually completely the action. So that your arms were up in the air for a longer period of time. So really it is still pretty new that people are using the jumping jacks motion for camping because thats not what it was before. 
---
Everyone I know uses jumping jacks (the quick motion) to signal its safe to come and save now. 
---
PC
---
And remember, being annoying increases your chances of getting camped.
---
Usually if two guys DC out of the gate, anyone who stays leaves with lots of BP and a pip.
---
It got buffed. Unlimited range, no cooldown. Saves my ass every game.
---
i literally never said that. i'm just saying that noed is a crutch because it rewards bad play, but with bbq you get rewarded for good play because you hooked someone 
---
that's not true though??? what??? you let the gens get done and it's rewarding you for being bad...
---
Lithe will never be top tier simply due to its buggy nature.  Windows are the most common place janky bullshit happens and lithe already can't consistently determine whether you are being chased or not.  
---
Ah ok. I’m not a movie buff at all.
---
concept wise they are great
---
gameplay wise they are a unsalvageable train wreck, Deep wounds is a broken mechanic, its just not possible to balance in is current state and you cant fix moon walk without trashing legion
---
This Nurse would *not* get out of my hand lemme tell ya
---
That’s after 2.5.0. Never had problems with windows until this patch. They should be fixing it though.
---
RNG can be your friend.
---
i like to imagine that there's at least one person on this subreddit that is good at killer and doesn't blame their failure on survivor perks
---
Bad advice sounds like he's encouraging you to hard tunnel and play scummy.  Just play your best every game and make intelligent decisions in chases and you'll win the overwhelming majority of your games.  There is room to play killer at rank 1 with integrity and still fuck up your prey.  If you destroy survivors in 5 games straight then get your ass kicked in one rough one the losses won't really sting as much.  Everyone loses sometime.  Important thing is not to let it tilt you or encourage you to play in a crutchy rank 20 playstyle of tunnels or camps.  
---
they remodeled her legs, nice ! 
---
No im saying it allows you to see when someone is nearby not doing anything in particular and then you can go over for help. You assuming I was talking about sprinting all over the map was absurd and insulting 
---
Tbf some suggestions aren't that bad, STBFL rework, and HG were both community ideas
---
honestly I wish the devs had the PTB up more to test insane changes more often, partly to see if some only look broken on paper, and secondly to demonstrate *why you shouldn't give a good hag player 115%ms*
---
I’m guessing you don’t play killer
---
It reaks of baby crutch in here.  
---
The point is that you need no skill in order to get kills as Legion, since his chasing ability is super easy to use. Also, at least Nurse doesn’t make me waste have my game getting healed, since that’s what Legion does. That’s why he’s unfun to play.
---
I'm not sure why you're picking me to have this argument with. I'm not disagreeing that SWF is a necessary evil. When I play survivor, I play SWF. Playing solo is boring.
---
It also, coincidentally, happens to be a massive pain in the ass when you play killer &amp; a 4 man DS SWF crew is a thing of nightmares.
---
its useful to know if she made a wrong turn or if you lost her
---
Lol Legion "main".  I don't know why but that concept is funny to me.  As if there's any real tactics or strategy to master with that noob machine.  He's great for killers that don't want to have to out the time into learning killer, that's about it.
---
its not camping *when the survivor literally loops you towards the hook*
---
Until 2 or 3 people are running it and nobody does generators bc they want WGLF stacks and the killer gets a 4k with 5 generators left.
---
I think what he means was that they were bugged for the longest time now. It looks dark and incredibly hard to see on the killer's screen but looks the same old copper brown trap on survivor's screens
---
Who do what
---
Big facts. 
---
Realistically, what else is Legion going to do? They either slash you twice while in Frenzy and chase your ass down (which wastes time), or they use the Frank's Mixtape and slash you three times and then your ass goes down (which still wastes some time). Would you prefer they just slash you twice and you go down like Nurse? 
---
Wiggling is meant to be useless in most situations, it exists so that killers don’t get greedy for hooks or if your team bodyblocks or takes hits so you escape. You already lost the chase, the killer can’t be punished for downing you and carrying you to a hook. 
---
But working with the killer is a-ok? Yeah k bud. Perfectly fine if some guy gets the hatch from a dc when the killer is working with a survivor.
---
Liquid or solid?
---
You know what? As someone who loves bloodpoints, using WMI, and **not sacrificing a slot perk for something that doesn't give me a tactical advantage**, I really like that idea.
---
 1.Uncivil Behaviour
---
Be  respectful towards other users. While arguments are bound to happen, do  not harass or insult other users; attack the argument, not the person.   Don't be offensive for the sole purpose of being offensive. 
---
Excuse someone notified me you printed my art on a shirt and claiming credit? How dare you 
---
uuuuh then keep chasing the person that you were chasing?
---
I think the objective is unintrusive but the point gain is painfully slow.
---
It also still randomly refuses to activate if you are in a chase.  And windows are the most janky and unsafe means of evasion.  
---
Territorial Imperative is not F tier. A lot of people go down there during a trial.
---
BBQ is not S+ with how many counters it has
---
Ah yes, you realise that killers actually ARENT favoured, so you just insult me. You can say I just need better map pressure and more skill, but it doesn't change the fact that survivors can do whatever they want. They only get caught if their potatoes or unlucky. Go back to playing big brain meg buddy. We get you are a survivor main.
---
I don’t remember the last time a huntress actually hit me with her hatchet.
---
What about Michael?
---
Yesterday I played a games 2 surfs disconnected from before I even downed them. It was *right before I hit them*. As soon as the game ended, I mourned with the last two survivors who I completely demolished
---
LOLLL YOU DO NEED BETTER MAP PRESSURE AND SKILL.
---
I have over 3000 hours in this game. I play killer frequently, namely Huntress and Myers. Dear god.
---
Technician's situation is when you're drinking, but I think it should be higher. Allows for getting a cheeky gen while the killer is near or chasing someone near.
---
Plebs who can't afford licensed chars 😂😂😂😤💁
---
Waiting for you find someone that got banned from moonwalking with Legion if it's an exploit. But I'm going to wait a while probably.

I like my 'Express Trip to The Rape Dungeon' perk build. 
---
It’s technically both ... depends on how you say it
---
[removed]
---
2 different people said that in post game chat. They only bought Legion to farm that: "sweet, sweet DC's" and "just to fuck with Survivors xd". This was at Rank 2.
---
You couldn't let the illusion live a little longer, could you?
---
BT is a strong perk. It should be in your SWF build if it isn't. 
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
yes it is in my SWF build because it is strong, but it doesn't need nerfs. it punishers campers and tunnellers. i like it.
---
it depends on where you're looping at and how tall the killer you're playing is. if they can see you during the loop your only real option is to make them drop the pallet and move on. also if you try to mind game a lot you might want to not mind game and see if they mind game themselves expecting a mind game and run into you.
---
I personally think monitor and abuse is good on all killers except doctor and wraith. Everyone benefits from a smaller terror radius
---
Impractical Jokers. It’s the show where all the Sal memes come from
---
I can’t stand that
---
Dude I got complaints about running Iron Grasp once, and god help me if I play Doctor or any of the other "unfun" killers. I used to try and play as honest as I could, but survivors blur the line on whats alright and whats not all the time and I realized something: almost every strategy that is deemed scummy by the community is just a strategy that gets results.
---
So yeah, play scummy if that is your thing.
---
Does it give you an actual indication now, or is it just birds flying away? Because I hate like, VAGUE BIRDS FLYING IN THIS DIRECTION!
---
I feel like this has to have been from presents obtained during the winter event.
---
They kinda do, but that's often client-side graphics.
---
I've found that small game has become increasingly valuable. Most times the killers I see are running ruin, noed, or both,  and small game is such a great counter to it
---
As much as I hate moonwalking Legion, reporting won't do anything as it's not reportable. But I hope people who DC against him get banned a few days to learn not to ruin other people's games just because they don't want to play a game. You're ruining even more the game as you crush every bit of chance the survivors had to win.
---
Calm down, nowhere in your comment I could find a hint to that
---
oh im not low rank lol i've tested it with low rank friends, i have 93% achievement completion in the game lol i play this game waaaaay too much  :)
---
My question is why run ds in KYF?
---
Lmao imagine thinking time = skill. You sound a Mercy one trick. This is over seeing as how you are using caps now.
---
That and loading into a 3 man game 
---
why tf would they play it on console if they have it on pc lmao? give me 1 good reason to play dbd on console over pc.
---
In addition to what Master-Windu said, this game isn't about "how many times can I make the killer have to catch me before I get hooked?". 9 times out of 10 after getting caught, you're meant to get hooked.
---
You disagreed with the claim that this reddit wasn’t sided at all, and made the claim it was survivor sided. You proceeded to “back this up” with “evidence” that turned out to be 2 surveys where around 100 out of the 90,000 people subbed to the reddit had voted. When I pointed out that such as small sample of people isn’t good data all you said something about how a great number of those accounts are inactive, which is true except you failed recognize that there are clearly more than around 100 active members on the sub seeing as some posts get around 4-6k upvotes and a great number of people don’t upvote or downvote stuff at all.
---
TL;DR, you made a poor claim with bad evidence and stuck by it to the point where there was nothing else to say except for plainly and simply disagreeing/telling you that you’re wrong.
---
so apparently there is no correlation between time played and skill OK it is clear you are brain dead
---
Yikes 3 v 1 is a easy win for killer unless hes bad and you must be rank 10 or higher to think that you are a god 
---
Yes, i had presents from the winter event, i just opened them recently and every single box had a mori in it.
---
And those scummy strats can be easily countered. But they still get results because survivors would rather complain then do so. And as I realized that, i became aware that i had been convinced that what I was doing was somehow wrong because it forces survivors to play in ways that are outside their comfort zone. Do I hard tunnel and camp? Only when it suits the situation. But no longer do I feel bad about it.
---
By the way, the majority of us think you are an asshole.
---
Where do you rate diversion ok this list? 
---
let her enjoy kate’s butt in peace.
---
I be flossiiiiinn' lol
---
If that's how you have to crutch out your kills babyyou do you.  Some of us can just play efficiently in chases and maintain constant pressure of survivors and gens which is nice because I get to play like a rank 1 at rank 1 instead of your baby 20 strats.  Games should be fun and competitive for both sides.  Playing your style gives them no chance.  I like to thoroughly demolish my survivors in a clean fair game.
---
Yes, and disconnecting during the match, unless right before death hook, affects your teammates ability to escape, and is therefore a dick move. 
---
TBH, some things need to be updated, technician is one of the strongest perks, if you are trash at hitting skill checks, diversion is good if it's a 4 man with pebble. If you do end up making a new version of this, try to think of perks from their 'strongest' and 'weakest' times, THEN decide where they belong, I'm assuming you did this off you're personal experience. Good list though!
---
how dense and stupid are you lmao
---
810 to go. We can do this. Good luck!
---
You actually grounded out the entire event? I applaud you. I just got 3 coins and decided to get Huntress’s cosmetic and take a break from DBD. 
---
Wouldn't make it threatening anymore. It kind of gets rid of the purpose of NOED. A perk I'd like to see is one that only applies the exposed effect on survivors when they are exhausted
---
Sorry but I wont heal myself, others will
---
This comment was made by the bond gang
---
Yesterday I was found and killer twice because the killer had no heartbeat or chasing music when he found me, anyone knows what's up? killer lagging? it was extremely unfair and cost me both games.
---
"Sprint Burst being way less controllable than the others with no advantage" Sprint Burst's advantage is also it's downside: it activates whenever you run, with no proc condition like other exhaustion perks.
---
repost?

You wouldn't even have the option to destroy is would you?
---

WISH I COULD GOLD THIS COMMENT NOW  
---
Gotcha. I havent been on reddit in a few weeks so I didnt know it was already posted. Oh well
---
You're a mammoni, Pesci.
---
Because sometimes the "baby" strats work. Never do I need to facecamp anymore (unless the poor lad has the misfortune of being hooked right next to an open door), but sometimes patrolling when I know they are around or "tunneling" the unhooked is the play to make. I'm not "resorting" to anything, I'm making a play and it often works out. What you deem to be a lesser playstyle ultimately is an *unoptimal* playstyle that you should pull out every once in a while to catch people off guard. there is nothing toxic or scummy about it, there really is very little a killer can do nowadays that is. If rank 1 survivors lose to baby strats, looks like they are babies. Now, you want to talk about lesser strats, resorting to ad hominem, no matter how indirect, is usually not a way that helps your point in an argument. 
---
And nope, I play on PC, and Pinochet is only in my name on Reddit because it easily gets a rise out of people, and I think that's funny.
---
this is the wackest list ive ever seen in 4 billion years
---
i couldn't hook anyone to it, but i managed to get the vessel from it.
---
You don’t play survivor much do you? Killers for the most part are able to catch you very quickly and down you relatively easy (if they’re skilled) but DS adrenaline sprint burst instaheal are all in response to this. Survivors need these perks to stand a chance. You wanna continue this DS adrenaline sprint burst instaheal etc meta?
---
I for one would enjoy seeing some variety in the perk slots. 
---
Huggs&gt;Death

OMG if a killer gets 3 stacks of DH they get even more protective of the totem.  My SWF teammate cleansed a DH when they had 2 stacks (we were like "we already cleansed HG, get that thing!). And then I went over to heal then after they cleansed.  She hit me and eventually downed me, then face camped me the rest of the game and my team survived (it was my first hook).  At the end she says, "cleanse my DH and you get face camped.". It was the funniest shit in the world, because she was hitting me on the hook the whole time.  Hard not to die laughing when killers do funny shit.
---
inb4 gets deleted immediately for over-saturated content because it is
---
I just want it to stop hurting my irl eyes :(
---
If you absolutely want to insist that there's no viable build but meta, then you're building your own walls. I've never run adrenaline or DS and rarely miss them. There's plenty of great perks (q&amp;q killers have to constantly check widows etc. Even if they don't hear anything until you use it; that's pretty good value if you know what you're doing) and your complaining that some aren't game changing is ridiculous since DS/exhaustion perks aren't either (they just consistently help which is enough). 
---
The game isn't limiting your playstyle; you are my dude. 
---
Drop a pallet on him, if he vaults a window or pallet immediately vault back the other way they will miss the swing, if he follows you run, if he follows you backwards get back in his line of sight, if he hits you and leaves mend.... legion isn't fun to play against but he isn't that good either. 
---
Depends on how good your 360 is or your juking
---
Nea’s teammates left her behind after missing all the gen skill checks making her tonight’s big loser 
---
I have learned that the hard way as well, I always make sure to read the text at the bottom so i don’t get sucked in... I have my meg with SB3 and i honestly surprise myself with how frequently i can use it. Even using it twice in a single chase, but in this case i was just watching for traps. I don’t usually sprint with Trapper unless I’m in chase. 
---
Okay dude I gotta say you made my day. I work 20 hours straight on Mondays and that theres gonna have me chuckling all day so thank you xD
---
or you could just delete it
---
Hope higher than Distortion? Wild. 
---
Then maybe you’re just a noob survivor. And yes he will probably down you eventually, but you can waste so much of his time in one chase forcing him to have to hit you with his ability every time that your team can gen rush and legion becomes useless. You all get so pissy because he’s easy, but the point is he’s still terrible and if you dc on him you’re just not good at survivor. I’d take a legion over a decent nurse any day
---
Dribbling is one counterplays to DS. I am saying it is not consistent because it's situational. Therefore it can not be said that DS is countered by dribbling.
---
Or you could go fuck yourself? This is the internet my dude, nobody actually gives a rats ass about anything. Everyone's going through the motions
---
80 hours last 2 weeks got all coins
---
The number of survivors escaping the nurse had diminished over time. Probably because the wanted a closer look
---
People who dc before first hook are definitely worse.
---
PC.
---
he had NOED though, that's his second chance after ruin, he didn't need to DC
---
I don't do that kind of shit ever, anyway, so it doesn't really concern me
---
Would shadowborne and or M&amp;A help with her crouch FOV? Is there any other issues besides character specific ones that you think would help her?
---
Lookout Nea the cherry picker is right behind you. 
---
O o f
---
Bodyblocking, or taking a hit for someone, is an intended mechanic. There is a perk that gives you bonus bloodpoints for taking hits for people. Just saying
---
Honestly the salt like that isnt that often. Just gets posted more then not. I mostly have a lot of great conversations post game chat. 
---
The only reason why im not nea main is because i can't betray ma girl Feng... u know... feng main big brain
---
Please make this for every killer
---
Altruism left the chat
---
Of course there’s some killers you see more than others, but I see all of them at rank 1
---
How do you play this game with such bad knowledge of obvious power levels

imo Prove Thyself should be higher on the strong and synergistic side

I’ve gotten to the point when I queue up with friends that BT is pretty much a required perk. It’s really hard for me to not see a time where it’s still marginally more useful then let’s say deliverance (for me at least) or Q&amp;Q. I rarely venture out of a limited perk pool, just out of the fact that there’s not much choice for me to pick between that warrant a perk slot. 
---
That flashlight is obscene
---
My point isn’t that some are better and you see them more because that’s a given, I’m asking since some people see that as a problem what do you think is keeping those less used killers from being used as much. Is it just a character problem or game problem
---
Hmm....maybe they add a Killer with beartraps.....naahhh thats too unlikely
---
Also says it’s oddly fast for kills, I mean....is it really odd that kills come much faster with an ebony mori?!
---
It’s 16 seconds for a friend with no items or perks to heal you base, self care makes it 50% speed so 32 seconds and then sloppy butcher further increases that by another 8 at tier 3. 
---
NOED
---
No One Escapes, DARN
---
W..w...w...whaaaaaaat?!😲
---
Didn't know THAT about the walls! I've been aiming it 😂 
---
It fucks up the game for everyone else. The Killer probably can't +2 pip because they didn't get all the sacrifices required and the survivors miss out on opportunities to unhook and run interference. 
---
Where did you read "good"? Lmfao
---
Yes so does the legion, immersed teammates and just in general antimates. Yet you don't bully them do you?
---
It’s such a good show. Add it to my favorite game as a meme and you’ve got my upvote for life.

Then you’re worse than him. Because you just screwed you’re whole team because you had a single matchup that you’re choosing to not have fun in. You’re the kind of person that makes this community seem shitty. What do you think when a killer dc anytime there’s a claudette or items? Do you dc on leatherface too? Why give up items and offerings and bp just to be a little bitch? 
---
Understood, I'm just being a jackass c:
---
Agreed, I’ve seen way more nurses on console lately. I don’t give them the kill necessarily, but I will be sure to open a gate and leave immediately (as long as no one is in danger.) People who stick around to rub it in are childish. 
---
And bring back insta-blinds and old BNP.
---
is there a source post about this? id love to read it
---
I like the meat shoes

you clearly care since you're crying about being caught reposting and stealing

I was a bit confused before I saw the Kate in the top panel.

I am at like 250/500 but have been cucked out of 400 coins at least.

You know the loud noise and indicator you get from survivors missing a skillcheck? Spies gives you something similar to that. When a bird is disturbed by a survivor and if you are within range of that disturbance, you will hear a loud noise and a unique crow icon will appear. 
---
I will warn you to lower your volume....some survivors just love to disturb the birds and thus spies will constantly trigger explosion sounds...
---
Meg girl best girl.
---
This is so high quality, please, never stop.
---
Totally thought you wasted T3 one hit away but the Mori happened
---
Somebody toucha my spaghet!
---
He just requires a different playstyle at a higher level. You have to take different routes so they don't see you coming at them cloaked from a mile away. 
---
now for a very special punishment for the ultimate teabagger
---
I have no prove but I play him at rank one and you can play him actually pretty good(if you have good addons and perks). 
---
It'd be pretty badass but he'd essentially be the wraith with a shoulder cannon. 
---
what do you mean?
---
16 (seconds) * 1,5 (50%) = 32 seconds ?
---
You got some nice maths dude.
---
And the rank of Sloppy Butcher doesn't affter the Mangled since it's just a status, it's 20% at every rank, only the bleeding effect increases.
---
I’m more impressed the entire didn’t take any of them lmao
---
So what do you use ? Got any Videos of your gameplay ? Would be interested in that.
---
These are the ones I can remember 
---
The nurse was pretty easy. She had NOED. I found it in the corn field and kept juggling through who was on the hook (would hit the person who unhooked them and then it would just cycle through) I think they were SWF. I made it out. 
---
The Billy got us all. We were in Springfield and he had Ruin. I found it in the upstairs bedroom of the house in the corner (almost missed it). There was a way too slow Claudette and overly altruistic Feng. We got maybe 2 gens done and I was hooked 3 times
---
Trapper was pretty decent, a lot of people got in his traps. We got down to 1 gen before I died on hook
---
Hag was horrible she ran ruin and hex the third seal. I got put in the basement and no one came for me
---
Wraith was pretty fun, I figured out he had BBQ so if there was a locker I would hide in it when he hooked. Made it out (can’t remember if others did)
---
I just played 2 different Myers games
---
1st Myers was good, 5 gens done and I was the only one who made it, he had NOED
---
2nd Myers has TOTH and Rancor/dying light and we only got to 1 gen before I died. He had bad bad lag. Last person got the hatch. 
---
Yeah already doing that. using every cove I can find when I move around the map but good survivors still see you early enough to run to the next pallet / loop 
---
The only great show on TruTV. One of only 2 good shows (I do enjoy Adam Ruins Everything despite some issues with focus on the topic at hand). They should pretty much just rename the channel TruIJ or ImpracticalTV or something due to the sheer amount of reruns they do for the show.
---
I can’t play right now but when I have time I will post it on this reddit. 
---
They could easily pull resources from one to the other. Whether it’s the actual people or just funding. And it ends up just being coding; those guys didn’t go to school just to code clothing 
---
What a roller coaster holy shit
---
If only she had a bright red outline when he finished that stalk off on her. Some wasted stalk but it's worth it on someone like this. 
---
Choo choo motherf*cker.
---
i only dc on legion and the other killer that doesn't exist. like, no thank you sis.
---
My proudest fap
---
Don't have Bubba, plus camping would make me feel too scummy, I'd sooner go afk and let people farm (though I'd probably still pip)
---
I've tried something like that with survivor, like not touching any gens, doesn't always work though
---
wraith is good and hag is good sweetie
---
I'd suggest breaking a chase when you get them to blow a pallet or hit them once too. Theyll waste time healing and won't have anywhere safe to run next time you see them. 
---
I'd check out some of Monto's builds. They use some rare add ons usually, but they're effective.
---
In general, I'd say anything that increases speed boost out of phasing is good. Also, the most effective wraith strat for me has been phasing mid-chase just to get that speed boost again after chasing the survivor down. 
---
Ooooh. Thank you for that info!
---
I got two 3Ks with him yesterday at rank 1. I didn't use like master class add-ons either. he's lower tier, but unplayable? nah
---
he does have some issues tho that causes him to be lower tier
---
his ability still causes frame rate issues for instance and like you said he's very loopable, more than any other killer, and his flashlight weakness is kind of unnecessary I guess, but I rarely have that hit me so it doesn't feel like a true problem
---
Yeah, I had a Nurse run five blinks yesterday, which is already strong, plus she was *good*. It was obvious that she played a lot of Nurse and knew how to use her blinks. She still ended the game with only a single kill, when she probably should have had more if not for console issues. 
---
Brother of Soggy Maskguy
---
Don't forget the actual value of Spine Chill being one of the two vault speed increases in the game alongside Resilience. That's really the main draw of the perk.
---
What if he turned invisible outside of a chase but you’d still hear a terror radius. And it was 32 m. As soon as you attack, you’re uncloaked automatically until you’re outside of a chase again. 
---
Oh and you’d have heat-signature vision outside of a chase but scratch marks do not appear. 
---
Hill Williamson*
---
words can't describe
---
Or he could put down teleportation spots that he can switch between so basically the mint rag version of hag 
---
How dare ya not call no mither the best perk. FeelsBadMan /s .
---
Why is this template more popular here than on r/EricAndre or r/TheEricAndreShow
---
What’s your gt?
---
Following the killer with a flashlight the whole game, that's why some killers camp. It's not even effective it's just purely annoying to chase someone and some other guy is following you, trying to blind you everytime you down someone. 
---
I'd say majority of the F tier is okay, you just have to make builds around them. 
---
Gimme that Huntress Lullaby and Overcharge, I can make a nasty Doctor build. Territorial Imperative and Monstrous Shrine can be good for a basement builds.  Thanatophobia is good on Legion and anti-heal builds. The Third Seal can be good for slugging (though not as good as knock out.) And unrelenting is good for new killers, so that'd probably be the only one I'd toss in garbage tier. 
---
Nurse actually takes skill though
---
nvm just made the account you have to be a troll
---
A nurse can be countered by hiding and knowing how to juke her. Legion is just unfun and a bitch to deal with. 
---
did i ever tell you the tragedy of Wraith the wise?
---
Shaggy is the new killer. Too strong to be a survivor
---
Get you some, Hagetha.

**Give us bunny feng** 
---
A hint was dropped to us a few weeks ago. It was the flag of Mali in Africa.
---
Another clue was dropped awhile ago in one of the dev streams telling us that the killer comes from the oldest time period within the game. This places us more or less before world war 1.
---
people are speculating that its a vampire based killer, based upon the folklore of the area.
---

we already have freddy
---
I always farm with survivors who have to deal with a DC as long as they haven't been playing obnoxiously.
---
But I feel like there's some cognitive dissonance between "Tunnelling, face camping and all the other game-ruining shit killers do is valid" and "DCing is the worst thing ever because it ruins people's games." IS RUINING GAMES BAD OR NOT? I'M GETTING MIXED MESSAGES HERE.

I've been able to make him working by using his cloak to track people endlessly and get free hits when the time is right. Chases are basically 5 seconds long. Once I get the first hit I go straight into cloak and break line of sight before tracking them down and surprise hitting em again.
---
Nevermind I'm dumb on the maths I deserve everything. u/Brandon_la_rana :)
---
Sloppy Butcher Mangled status is still the same at every rank though.
---
Y my pp big
---
Again, I've seen some of Zubat's streams where he's Nurse, and a good survivor knows how to juke him around the environment, especially jungle gyms, to waste enough time for two generators to pop, and when he hooks them, two others are still cranking out those gens while someone else goes for a rescue.
---
Using the argument that some survivors aren't good isn't necessarily a good one to point to Nurse being way too OP, though I will agree that a Nurse with 3 or more blinks is completely busted; 3 blinks should be the max, and maybe only achievable with a Very or Ultra Rare addon.
---
All in all, I've faced plenty of survivors who can prolong a chase long enough to where I'm losing too much time, and it's because these survivors know that LoS is absolutely crucial, yet so many are always trying to do normal loops.
---
Let me also be clear that I'm not saying juking a good Nurse is easy, or that it will even be possible to completely lose them. That said, it is possible to juke them long enough so that they start rapidly losing control of the game.
---
Blessed by the entity
---
I think a second objective would be the best route too, something not too long but enough to give killers a reason not to rely on ruin all the time. 
---
Clown is my favorite killer and his chase is really good but map pressure is definitely a weakness of his so I just try to set my perks up to help with that and try to force a 3 gen. 
---
It’s hard to balance because you can’t have killers being good at everything but if you leave out something key they will struggle unless they have an instadown which helps out a lot. 
---
I have to do it a bit early because you saw what happenes to my fps when I tier up lol
---
Might not mean you're a good killer but it does make your job easier, don't it?
---
&gt;some of us jack it in traffic.
---
I uh... I don't think that's a good idea.
---
Deja Vu is super useful for new players.
---
YEH IKR PEOPLE REALLY DO BE HATING SPIRIT
---
The Point is that you stated that DCing at the end to Rank down is a waste of time, while in reality it is the only acceptable logical way everyone who isn‘t a big douche would do it. So by saying this you definitely encourage douchy behaviour.
---
You yourself not doing it changes nothing.
---
Saying that sacrificing time to not fuck over your teammates is a WASTE of time is not exactly an outstanding move.
---
When I use Tombstone piece just save my Mori for someone who is a good looper or toxic lol
---
reasons to keep playing dbd
---
Did you just say Dead Hard is better than Sprint Burst????
---
woah, this looks sweet
---
I know I didn't even get a bbq stack. But I really wanted to punish her for being an asshole
---
That’s not bad. I kept hearing especially with deranking that people want more variety but at least from the comment in here that doesn’t seem to be a problem but this is definitely not a great sample size lol
---
"Should"
---
you can control when your BL activates but you can totally waste your lithe just from looping at shack
---
Well, it is, when it works. 
---
As the killer it's definitely funny but it's also scummy as hell, ya just ruined the game for three other people. 
---
If you do it right in front of me, I will take that free hook
---
&gt; need to fix chase detection
---
Agreed, but in the meantime, have a hotfix for Legion. Make the bleedout proximity or chase based. 
---
Yeah, pharmacy and botany knowledge is so much better, I'm glad that I've avoided the trap of taking self-care.
---
Bill with an Assault Rifle vs 99 Killers
---
thank u for the suggestion. true suggested that survirours start with claudette. i was wondering what to start with as a killer. pig sounds great but i would need to buy the dlc too. i have been playing wraith so far and it isn't too bad yet. 
---
i have been following true since like a year. definitely like his content. I will checkout tyde time too thanks. 
---
Yes, because your green medkit and Bond are going to heal you so well when the Killer has Franklin's Demise and the potatoes on your team are all dead.
---
But it's true. What I said is factually correct, which is the point all along. 
---
Jake looks super confused.
---
Wasn't me then :/
---
Again. By saying this you imply that not being a douche is of no worth at all.
---
Which is not a fact but an opinion.
---
nice to meet you, Wraith with Noed. I hope to face you really soon. I will break all the totems making you tonight's big loser
---
Nea has been found guilty!

Let's give it everything we've got !

IT'S PUUUNNIIISSSHHMMMEENNNTT TTIIIIIIMMMEEE !!!
---
Well you basically stood there for the trapper to stand in his own trap when your adrenaline would hit. 
---
You are pretty much at fault for it. Being down you could have seen who was doing what and prepared for it.
---
???
---
Buffed Alert is God tier. No cool down, infinite range. Unless you're facing Freddy or Tier 1 Myers it's amazing.
---
Yeah. I really depends on the time of day, I think. My last 2 games were both Billy’s. One was Gideon’s and we all made it out. The 2nd one was Macmillan and he was a bit of a tunneler and definitely a proxy camper. 4 gens done (he had ruin and I unhooked someone who was hooked right next to it.) I got hooked in the basement and he never left the area. A Dwight came to get me and he got chainsawed down and I got hit down and rehooked to die. 
---
I just finished a game with the huntress but she was rank 5 (I was with a SWF group I guess. 2 rank 5 and 1 rank 2). This huntress was a camper, but she didn’t want to deal with DS so instead of just dribbling the person, she slugged and then followed them around to hit anyone who came to get them up. I stuck with doing gens once i figures out what she was doing. I found the hatch but showed it to someone else and went for the last guy on the hook. She got me and slugged me until he died. She then hooked me and I tried to Kobe but didn’t and then just let myself die so they could get the hatch. We got to 1 gen. We could have done all 5 with how this huntress played. 
---
Last time I did his daily I got ONE fucking chainsaw hit. While blinded. On the last survivor teabagging at the exit. And he was too far from the brambles to crawl away soon enough. He laughed his ass off in chat. I suck so badly at Billy.
---
I stopped using it since the event started and haven't regretted it.
---
The fact you think Autodidact is garbage and Self Care is the best perk tells me you must be low rank ;)
---
Wraith is pretty decent if you just wack on, a windstorm and swift hunt he becomes very good in the hands of decent players all you need to know is how to run tiles and apply map pressure he's probably one of my favourite killers to play just because he helps so much vs immersion 
---
I was against a SWF as a newly prestiged Spirit, so all I had was HG at rank 3, but no other hex perks, or even any other good perk to use as my 4th, so I just stuck with HG.
---
Get into match, approach a gen with 3 survivors, and suddenly HG blows up and I down all 3 in about 20 seconds, then find the 4th one trying to unhook and get a 4k in just under 2 minutes of the game starting.
---
Post game was like, "FUCK YOU JAMES, I FUCKING TOLD YOU IT WAS HAUNTED GROUNDS".
---
Died for all mankind.

phwoar boiiii

When the killer sees you
---
Bottom text
---
Also dont stay together if everyone spreads out it negates chain stabs
---
It's okay man, but just like, word of advice for general life stuff, it's a good idea not to say things like that last sentence, because it's kind of concerning.
---
But I get your anger and what you're trying to say. Sometimes it really does feel like a certain type of killer is out for your blood. It probably isn't true, it sounds like confirmation bias at play.
---
isn't that the old map offering for Backwater Swamp?
---
That was amazing.
---
Take fake gold 💰
---
now I also understand why u think self care isn't good, u must be one of those boosted swf monkeys who relies 100% on teammates in voice chat...
---
plz git gud and learn to play with and without swf. if you play with random teammates, u won't find em all the time unless u use perks like bond or similiar things.
---
How do you keep your totems safe? I’m tired of blinking to my DH every 10 seconds.
---
Oh thank you!
---
True but this is mostly from personal experience, since I don’t invest as much time in survivor I’m really low rank on survivor
---
Feng was being a toxic bitch
---
Feng died immediately after
---
I'll be honest the xbox one x does pretty well running this game at 60 fps, at least in my experience. Survivor games are a crisp 60 frames, and killer is 60 frames *for the most part.* 
---
Sometimes frames will drop on certain maps as killer, but it's certainly not nearly as bad as it used to be for me. I first played this game on the OG xbox one and that was just an absolute dumpster fire. 
---
Maybe i haven't seen it as you're describing. Most often people DC in thw first 20 seconda after billy does his thing. I don't think I've seen someone DC after the hook but on their way. Denying bbq trigger, sacrifice points etc. If you've legit played and dc during your death animation sure it doesn't really matter.
---
I’m not sure about Xbox or PC but the “DLC Locked” characters are free DLC on PS4. 
---
So technically yes they’re DLC locked but every PS4 player and maybe other platforms can unlock for free. 
---
Nah, not most of them.
---
I’ve stopped using it entirely because the time it takes to heal yourself is too great. You’re taking yourself out of the action while another teammate may be getting chased and you need to focus on generators as much as possible to maximize everyone’s chances of escape. I personally think you’re way better off finding a teammate who can bandage you. It secondarily provides cooperation bp because 1: they’ll heal you, and 2: you’ll probably work a gen together. I replaced it with Prove Thyself, which further synergizes the team heal strategy. 
---
https://youtu.be/rbWUl-EgmjI a good example
---
What the fuck
---
It's so satisfying to kill teabaggers as a killer. 
---
Ooh, an add-on for me and the nearest tree after I play a really awful killer round... :(
---
Dare the shape prepare for knife rape.

Ive seen entire teams get slayed 4K by a killer camping at red ranks....I cant blame anyone but us survivors for being dumb.  Of course others called them trash and other insults a end game chat...but hot damn, it worked.  We got all gens done too...Almost like a bait and switch tactic. Camp 1 or 2 and slay the rest....ah man... :(
---
epic
---
Balanced landing always gives you a fall recovery reduction time too, so even when the perk isn’t active, you may be able to evade a killer because of the static bonus. 
---
Exactly, but 
---
&gt; People who DC on death hook are the worst. Like just wait the extra 8 seconds and get your points
---
is what I'm replying to, not the 20 second DCs.

Prestieg her and you might get legacy /s
---
Magicians don’t ever really reveal how tricks are done though...outside of that show with the masked magician years ago! (Which on a sidenote I’d highly recommend if you like seeing tricks get revealed, it was awesome). Carbonaro is definitely real I think, as in the marks are not in on it similarly to IJ. But both shows do certain things that are “staged”. Carbonaro does edits in a manner that you can’t see how he does a trick, and with IJ hell the entire presentation of an episode with an ongoing scoreboard isn’t real. 
---
When you are running only Thrill of the Hunt without other Hexes cause you just want BP :(
---
 i guess it could be: make your choice, devour hope, haunted ground and anything that will help you to track survirors, BBQ for an example
---
If u like him get him 
---
He was meant to defeat the DCs, not join them.
---
Have to buy leatherface or hope it appears in shrine which is not a common occurrence 
---
I kinda like to think that she ran away after she got put back into reality and was transported to the realm of the entity but now she just a shit load of bandages over her shoulder cuz she doesn't know anyone that can help her and now that bullet is just free flowing inside of her not to mention her shoulder is fucked up cuz again she didn't put a cast on so she's kinda fucked but she's alive
---
Ok clearly I’m not very well versed, but I think the intent behind my points stands that one example is bad admittedly
---
First thing I tried. Did nothing
---
Why are Nea mains always the worst
---
Practice nurse more it should reach end game if u can play her
---
Kindred is definitely useful if you're solo survivor. And since that's how I normally play it's stronger for me than as listed here. It's very useful when you have a camper.
---
tbf, if the weapon touches you during the animation and it doesn't hit that would be pretty bs on the killer's side.
---
It is so weird that Tombstone Piece is way better than its ultra rare part. 
---
From leather face
---
You get rewarded for quick chases, but only 4 chases will get you a bad chaser emblem. Your point isnt to just to kill survivors, you're supposed to entertain the entity. That's the whole lore behind this game.
---
When I see a baby nurse I think of the movie Gremlims... so cute,  until they are not! 
---
Just buy leatherface?
---
I do (mostly when I have nowhere else to hide or if there's one by a gen I'm working on...I'll hide in it so that when the killer leaves I can continue working on it)
---
Do you want BBQ &amp; Chilli? Because LF is how you get BBQ&amp;C.
---
Just play a killer enough to get the perks you need... 
---
Clown
---
Of course it's not necessary to fully charge! I often use a quick tap throw instead of a normal melee. Charging is only needed when the ranged is, but having quicker charging time means you spend less time slowed if charging is needed. 
---
Most people hate slugging in general
---
You also have to level him to 35 and unlock his teachable then you have to find it in any killers bloodweb that you want to use
---
We don’t do that here. We do that there, besides this rock, do you see these scratch marks?
---
It’s definitely possible to survive on a group of randoms. You just have to hope some of them are not complete dipshits. It’s luck of the draw unfortunately.
---
*laughs in decisive strike*
---
Can you help me with what are the best DH builds? That and Thrill so they assume its Haunted and you can protect it? Or just DH and hope for the best?
---
If your target has a normal number of chromosomes you really should only go for max-charge unless you in an area where they cannot dodge.
---
I hate Claudette but I gotta say... when I play against a Claudette in my lobby with the designer glasses and everything.. then I’m just like danggg girl you got swag
---
The Hunter
---
Also on top of just getting to pick what you wanna use, Balanced Landing will always give the Landing stun reduction even if I’m cooldown which is good
---
Glad someone beat me to it. 
---
Pharmacy is a teachable perk for Quentin Smith, at tier three you open chests 80% faster, and the noise chests make is reduced by 8 metres.
---
The big thing is that the first chest you open will *always* contain a Emergency Med Kit item, no matter what, allowing you to heal yourself with it if required, but also being a valuable tool in healing teammates too. It heals at 135% the normal heal speed and has enough charge to heal you once fully, and even a second time if a survivor has partially healed you (but had to bail due to a killer or something), it can also be used to heal teammates faster than usual 
---
It's important to point out now that one of the most important things you can learn as survivor (in my opinion) is how to manage your time well, a team that manages their time is insanely powerful, you generally want to spend as much time as possible progressing the main objective (the generators)
---
Being able to heal yourself with the medkit over using self care frees up valuable time you can be using to do generators or heal other teammates, when playing survivor there's nothing worse than being close to victory but all that progress is lost due to survivors healing themselves for 32-40 seconds (A generator takes 60 seconds, so they literally could've gotten 2/3rds of a generator done in some instances) In situations where you HAVE to heal yourself, pharmacy saves precious time for both yourself and your team.
---
prestige doesnt give you better drops or perks it just gives cosmetics. imo if you have claud at all perks dont prestige her because that would be such a waste
---
The fact that you're implying Purple Flashlights are somehow special, or that BNP and DH are worth wasting a perk/add-on over to deal with is hilarious.

You're likely to get flack for calling out gen rushing because "ItS tHe ObJeCtIvE" but it'll be by people who complain about tunneling even though it's the killers objective.
---
Going to have to try that! Thanks!
---
We're pointing out that the perk is only strong against people who camp and tunnel, very relevant to the topic.
---
Absolutely *barbaric*, have this upvote...
---
I mean I like the story (some ppl will disagree) but game wise I don't really like playing them unless I just want to be a meme and get ppl to Dc 
---
General opinion is that LF is a below average killer, but you can still do well with him and he has some of the best killer perks in the game (BBQ has been meta since release, and his other 2 are at least average). 
---
I’m pretty sure it increases your rate of greens, or at least less brown... unless that’s just for killers. 
---
If it’s only cosmetics, then it’s just stupid to prestige.

Because in order to coordinate that kind of abuse, you'd need to be swfing, but bhvr doesn't currently have the tools to determine who's doing that, so they couldn't implement a system to monitor and punish those that chose to game the system in that way. 
---
🙄
---
yup
---
Personally I think Spirit is a lot of fun to play, plus Haunted Grounds and Spirit Fury are pretty good perks
---
no
---
What else do you need besides Pizza Dwight? 
---
You have to kill all 4 survivors. Previously merciless victory was when you killed all 4 survivors in the previous system this changed recently with the new pipping system a couple of months ago.
---
Honestly, if im against a swf team ill camp. And its not cuz im salty, its cuz swf groups are fucking dumb and it leads to me getting two or three more downs as they try to rescue their friend.
---
If survivors dont want campers then start punishing them correctly.
---
Best DBD video ever. My best 5 minutes spent. Thank you!
---
3 guys dc punish those 3 players for dc, doesnt matter if they are swf or not
---
And others want to use every trick in the book to make sure they win and make the killers life hell for a good 20 minutes.
---
I'd still rather play against the legion than Leatherface 
---
I wanted to do that but I thought it was too close to Huntress
---
stop crying about that they cant just giveaway something they spent money on too
---
not worthing save your bp
---
Just checked what tinkerer does, it was that for sure, really unlucky to proc in the middle of my chase.
---
Three don't need to dc, in a 4 man you could rotate one person dcing and the other 3 farming bloodpoints and they could basically keep their rank static while soaking up bonus bp in perpetuity, which is not how the game is designed to work.
---
Yeah, this happened to my brother, his plan was to get picked up and then have the trapper walk forward into his own trap.
---
Just go to Narnia ;)
---
So basically punish those playing for fun because some people try hard lmao. Sounds like a great game.
---
Sure DS is annoying but not as annoying as NOED when a shitty killer gets a 4K when his skill dictated it should've been a 1K but bc he had NOED he gets 4K.  Tru3 said it best.  NOED makes it so you don't have to learn the killer.
---
RUSH B
---
&gt; It is unfair to want SWF removed or moved to a different game mode and camping and tunneling still be okay.
---
You can't equate these. Camping/tunneling is legitimate game play. Just becasue it sucks for one person doesn't change that. Using third party comms is game breaking. For instance, once one person knows where your totem is everyone knows where it is
---
Everyone on this page thinks the other team is unfair...
---
A typo :|
---
Yes, it is a waste of time in that it takes longer. Which makes it faster to DC at the start. It seems like you're playing semantics just to push a point. 
---
You get nothing for the d/c, except losing pips. Unless you want to quantify something as the potential to improve a little bit at the game, but that happens so gradually that I think this argument would be a stretch to say the least. 
---
This is not a response to my argument at all.
---
O my god he has a skin
---
No it's not. Because no matter what you will disagree. Killers think survivors are all toxic and unfair, Survs think all killers are toxic or unfair. Let people have friends.
---
bbq/ ruin/ thrill of the hunt/ discordance with the doctor on the game map would net you a hefty post game amount 
---
You know this sub is a killer circle jerk when this gets downvotes lol 
---
Like you never saw some Spanish or German in chat?
---
But I agree, we're not known for our multilingual skills
---
Well Agitation doesn’t increase wiggle time so the real question is about iron grasp. And it adds 8% (if memory serves right).
---
Oh really? Good to know thanks for the advice I have 160 of those but always used purples. 
---
You don’t have to play nurse to get nurses calling, you can just play a different killer and put the points into her
---
I play SWF almost every day. I'm just not dishonest about it.
---
Congrats
---
Fengs for sure. They make the least mistakes imo
---
Borrowed time less situational than self care? Self care shouldn’t be on the situational side at all
---
This is just amazing. You flat out don't care. You know that you're being dishonest about all of this and you just don't care.
---
Yea because  it is totally fair to be toxic to one side but God forbid the other side gets toxic too.
---
Their attitude about this is evidenced by Shroud of Separation being a killer offering, and shroud of binding being a survivor offering.
---
I said some people play for fun and don't deserve to lose XP because others try way too hard.
---
Yeah.  I don’t think Adam is nearly as bad as the rest of the crap like Laff mob, which is possibly the worst show of all time,  or the talk show the game show abomination lol, but I can only watch IJ and Carbonaro as well. Hack my life used to be ok but now it’s annoying.
---
Its shitty when a shitty survivors loses a chase and gets a free pass because of a perk that doesnt help survivors learn anything other than hey I can hit a skill check. Neither should be in the game but at least one can be prevented from working.
---
Yeah! That's a good way to go. I didn't necessarily mean you have to give the kill. Let's just try to be polite and at least end the game without wasting anyones time. 
---
* Some people play swf without comms
---
* Some people play with comms but just talk like friends meeting up with eachother and don't pinpoint every location of totems, generators, pallets and the killer.
---
I really don't get this exaggeration that every swf is some elite squad of the best survivors that never make mistakes and bully killers. Just play them and gain experience to better yourself and overcome them easier. You can also dodge the lobby, but you're only gonna effect how many games you get to play a session if you dodge every swf.
---
Alright thanks, btw is killer queue time always long? I always wait like 10min
---
Every game that goes to powered gates is going to have camping and tunneling. To say that it's only good against bad killers is just low IQ whinging and not on topic at all.
---
Or killers find non swf groups...
---
People really over exaggerate the infamous death squads. There is not nearly as many of them as some people say and these players often make mistakes (just like any other survivor)
---
What you described here looks more like inability to put out pressure.
---
What confuses me even more is you statement on Hex: Ruin. Better players can just work through it rendering it pretty much useless.
---
This really seems more like a salt/rant to me
---
Wtf five blinks??? You mean in a row before having to recover?
---
It’s a perk (Spies from the Shadows) and it isn’t very good either. There’s hardly any crows on most maps.
---
I prefer to play vs swf at least vs swf I don't have to worry about survivors dying first hook and the survivors being complete 4heads you actually get something resembling a challenges vs a good swf 
---
Pleb
---
Sorry you got to witness that! I also got hit with pretty much the same treatment. It sucks the fun out of the game but we gotta stay strong. It's just a matter of practice, I'm sure. Others have done it!
---
Surprisingly ive come across so many really really good ones on ps4 recently, like out of nowhere. 
---
They didn't drop the flag of Mali. It was Paulie Esther, a content creator and fog whisperer, who tweeted the flag of Mali as a first 'hint' to the next chapter. Thing is, that he might just have referenced the internal name for the next chapter, because it's very common for the devs to give chapters internal names based on countries. Legion was Kenya or Spirit Haiti e.g.
---
I hate it with a passion. Such a bad map.
---
Legion. Playing against him is a real **thriller**
---
:)
---
That does not happen every game. It absolutely does not happen enough that you can't gain experience. This is part of the double standard I mentioned somewhere else.
---
I could also say that you can't gain experience a a killer if you have to play against people abusing mechanics. How is that less true? You can't practice, say, finding survivors naturally if they use comms to optimize in a way that the killer cannot.
---
No matter what, _never_ quit the game! When I started out, people would T-bag and keep juking me, and only when I played Nurse would I have people messaging me telling me how trash I am. It awoken a fire inside me, a determination to see the game through, because even when all four of them were at the gate mocking me, I could use that as an opportunity to practice my blink strikes since they were fine sitting there until they got hit. Now I’m a force to be reckoned with at rank 4, and the messages calling me trash have stopped and in their place are messages of me try harding with a top tier killer. The irony. 
---
Also happy cake day!
---
Tbh there isn’t anything they can really do about that unless they make it so you can’t be in a party and play. I don’t really think that’s a good idea because some ppl are just playing and not being super competitive while in the party. 
---
Maybe they could put an icon over the swf group so you know 100% that it’s a full swf or just a two man so then you could try to use certain perks or add ons to help deal with them
---
Bro ur using like 2018 meta
---
its 2019 now, get with the program old man
---
Yea lmao
---
From games that I played as killer against swf, sometimes there will be that annoying partner that follows anyone getting chased and flashlight save them every chance they get.
---
If I'm dead on hook then please just hook me so I can move on to the next game.
---
Continuously slapping me onto the ground just makes me mad because I know I've already lost but I'm being held hostage because of a sweaty killer. This usually leads to angry post game chat which could have easily been avoided if I was just allowed to move on to my next game.
---
Privet, kak dela?
---
Out of my two years playing ive never had anything like that happen.
---
Yes, but I thought it would be nice to try the perk on the killer that it was designed for. Plus she's a really cool looking killer and one of the few that I actually find frightening in concept.
---
I mostly added that to make it so people couldn't complain that they can't see him before ripping them off of stuff tbh. it doesn't make much sense it was more for a balanced idea rather than just a full buff ya know?
---
My favorite killer to go against is the nurse because she has great map pressure 
---
Unless you're having trouble maxing your Hunting, you're not getting bonus BP. It just makes it easier to fill up that 8k Hunting. The only things that give you bonus BPs post-trial is BBQ and WGLF. Everything else just helps you fill that 8k. Good news is that it applies to Hunting actions immediately and cleansing it just removes bonuses from future Hunting actions if  that's what you're actually using it for.
---
I've run so many non-BBQ BP perks to try and get bonus BPs and learned this after a few tens of painful games with perks that weren't really good together. Then I just caved and got Leatherface because the Shrine is allergic to BBQ.
---
Glad to hear! Around what rank is this? I'm only about 10.
---
Then magic for next season is out of the question, I wonder if it's a vampire or, cultist or werewolf.
---
Omg this is adorable!
---
Nah they should embrace DbDs toxicity and force everyone to read what people think or look away until they leave the end game screen. :)
---
&gt; if rude messages are a reason why you're quitting then good riddance lol
---
&gt; 
---
I hope you are camped in every game for a month for making an asshole statement like that.
---
That's not how it's calculated. It indeed requieres 32 seconds, but their wording is quite fucked up in that regard.
---
Selfcare requieres the doubled time in comparasion to a normal heal because it's just 50% as fast. Meaning half the speed, double the time requiered. Like, when you're commonly running at 4 mph, you'll obviously get 4 miles done in one hour. But when you're running at 50% of the speed, which's 2 mph, you'll need 2 hours to run said streak.
---
Play a killer that actually takes skill to play
---
I'm relatively new to killer so I don't have that many perks and have been playing other killers like leatherface or billy for teachables and experience. but I was running the block and shirt addons when I was playing him mostly.
---
Like the wise ass said, this game isn’t noob friendly. The game is super competitive and the community makes it in which the game cannot be fun for any new players. Even if you have played over 1000 hours but still get killed by someone who has 1001 hours played they will feel as if they just won an Oscar and their father came back to their lives.  They are the type of people who will talk shit post game either on the game chat (PC) or in a DM (console). I play both killer and survivor. Both have the same amount of time put in them and I still get the occasional survivor/killer that is salty over any small thing. The game in its current state is not good for newcomers. It is better if you find another game that is more user and friend-group friendly. Cause if there is one thing DBD players hate more than their life it is SWF
---
Eh.... I almost never use that because I just about never vault unless I’m in chase when the killer can clearly see me. But I understand the appeal. 
---
Solution to your #2:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4ykv03/how_to_turn_off_intro_scene/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Had the same problem, hope it'll help you too :D
---
Yeah there is toxic shit on both sides. I've seen lots of trashy behavior before. 
---
I am having a lot of fun with totem builds as specific killers.
---
Trapper:
---
Perks: Thrill of The Hunt, Devour Hope, Hex: Ruin and Remember Me
---
Addons: Iridescent Stone together with either honing stone or the addon that decreases the chances of escaping traps and increases the time it takes to complete an escape attempt
---
Playstile: at the start of the match, you go over to your totems and if you're lucky, they are enclosed by 3 walls/props. Place a trap next to the totem.
---
On it's own, the trap disabling already gives a notification, but I use thrill of the hunt for the extra time it takes for them to cleanse the totems.
---
After your traps are placed, you go looking for the obsession to get some stacks. At the start of the match, you shouldn't wory about breaking chases to protect your totems, however, after some time, random traps around the map will be set.
---
So this build pretty much works around the idea of survivors standing on a trap that can close at any second while cleansing the totem.
---
When the last generators are about to be powered, it might be a good idea to place a trap at each exit gate. Same thing applies to the gates, there is a decent chance that traps will snap back shut while a survivor is opening the gate.
---
Hillbilly:
---
I don't enjoy hillbilly all that much and find that SWF abuse the inability of hillbilly to get to all totems and getting easy downs. To get maximum killing potential, I'd say: equip the engravings, this increases your speed and might allow you to chainsaw targets cleansing your totems before they realise how fast you're approaching.
---
Perks are Thrill Of The Hunt, Devour Hope and maybe Ruin together with a perk of choice (4th hex perk not recomended)
---
Nurse:
---
I hate nurse, but pretty shure that you can get a good totem protect build with Ruin, Devour hope, thrill of the hunt and addons that increase your blink distance
---
Hag:
---
Perks: Thrill Of The Hunt, Ruin, Devour Hope, Make Your Choice
---
Addons: Mint Rag and Cracked Turtle Egg
---
Playstile: place a trap at your totems, don't trap loops because you want to linit the amount of active traps to not accidentaly teleport to the wrong trap
---
Mint Rag allows you to teleport to traps that aren't triggered while Cracked Turtle Egg makes sure that you have enough time to teleport to traps if you weren't imidiately able to.
---
Your first hook is usually a survivor you pulled off of your totem.
---
To pull someone off of your totem, firstly, this build is more powerfull if your trap doesn't get triggered because if they trigger the trap, they will most likely not touch the totem. Thrill of the hunt will give you a notification. Take a few moments to look good at the direction of the notification to see what the situation is. First thing you should look at is: is my trap triggered or not? If not, just teleport to your trap and try getting a hit, don't commit to a chase, just place a new trap. If the trap is not triggered, you need to thing carefully. Traveling to a non triggered trap is a learning experience wheb doing it for the first time. Usually when a survivor triggers a trap, you automatically look at the survivor. If the trap is not triggered, you will keep looking in the same directing. If you were at the south side of the map and a totem got touched at the north side of the map, you will have to look to the north to teleport to the trap. After teleportation, you will still face north, but the totem might be east or even south of the trap, so make sure you know before teleporting what direction the trap is, so you can imidiately start rotation after you teleporting so you can grab the survivor before they realise whats going on.
---
After catching a survivor, place a trap by the hook. Make distance from the hook so make your choice can activate. If they trigger the trap, don't imidiately teleport, wait a few seconds, most people will do a panic rescue. When you get the unhook notification, teleport and swing at whatever you can see. It doesn't matter who you hit: borrowed time doesn't activate (I think), the rescuer has the exposed effect and the rescued is injured. If the trap didn't get triggered, the only thing that changes is that you have to rotate yourself after teleporting and with this one, I am sure that borrowed time doesn't activate. This is a very fun build, but before I used the cracked turtle egg, I often got overrun because I couldn't teleport at all traps within time. With cracked turtle egg, you have a bigger reaction window
---
Spirit:
---
By far my favorite devour hope build
---
Perks: Devour Hope, Thrill Of The Hunt, Ruin, Monitor and Abuse
---
Addons: Prayer Beads and Mother-Doughter ring
---
Playstile: unlike the trapper and the hag (and like the nurse and hillbilly), this build doesn't require any setup. You just play normally untill you get a notification. Wether it's a totem or a generator notification, you are able to go quite close to your target before you go into phase walking. The mother doughter ring allows you to quickly do to the totems and the beads make it so that they have no way of knowing you're near untill it's too late. 
---
The whole game will be you pulling people off of totems and gens
---
What's Xbox?
---
Entity follows the same patterns every time so you can almost always decide what the entity takes.
---
For those that don't know...
---
It will always take the 2nd perk immediately after your first (no matter what pick). If not, it will start with a perk always after pick 6. If no perks available, it will start with the furthest item in the ring, then it will spread from there. 
---
In event of multiple paths, it will choose paths that go further out of the ring. If you ever cut it off, it will start over by picking the furthest thing on the ring. 
---
If it would take an item that would cut off ALL other items, it will instead start at the end (it can never take the last item of a bloodweb). 
---
Knowing this, he picked North Green, Mori 1, Mori 2, East, then Monitor and Abuse. This started the entity down at Insidious. He has all the time in the world to pick up the rest as the entity works its way at that bottom section. 
---
 I don't really get the point of this post.
---
The DC is shitty, but I don't think your being fair in your campign comment. In the end game there is literally nothing else you can do. If you walk away from the hook at the end game you are gonna lose the hook. It's why the end game is dogshit.
---
BBQ is by far the best BP Perk, but those smaller ones still do make a difference. I rarely max anything. Deviousness maybe here and there. So lets say you have a good game where you get 6k points in hunting. With a BP perk thats 8k (maxed) and means you got 2.000 points extra. 4000 if combined with BBQ. 
---
Honestly they should change the description of the achievement. There is just a ton of little things in the game that just need quick changes that would take a couple of minutes to implement. 
---
Red ranks. Theyve kind of come out of nowhere it seems. 
---
This feels like a personal attack lol, maybe I need to git gud. 
---
When I first started playing Killer, I played a lot of Billy, and did well with him. So I thought I was a good Billy and leveled him to 50. Turns out I'm actually the hottest of garbage. 
---
BBQ was added as an incentive for killers to go hunting, hence the aura. WGLF was added before that, as a trade-off sort of perk.
---
If WGLF is gonna get a buff, then it's that you get a token for healing someone a health state as well. 
---
If they can think of different take on magic, why not? It's not like we don't have killers with similar powers/themes

---
Lol fav time this happened was when I was doing a daily for a killer I never play. Got stomped on by these guys teabags flashlights all full meta ds strikes and stuff. I admitted defeat by taking the last person to gate so they all got out. Still got harrassed in post game. 
---
Had a daily on myers so loaded him up and Got the same group. Didnt run eboni but ooooh boi... ran lerys map with my jumpscareboi.
---
4ked them. Post game was like "im sorry. We were just playing!" Lol
---
Just run calm spirit if its messing with you that much
---
Yeah it sucks on both ends too. It's only 20 secs of m1 for a surv and then boom you are mostly safe and then it's just camp town for the killer. Really hope we get some better end game soon.
---
Needs more stab wounds. 
---
I was going to write a paragraph but I realized anyone who thinks some killers need 175% movement speed wont understand.. your 107 hours means nothing, it doesnt add any authenticity to your suggestions or anything
---
Orphaned babies could be replaced with Waluigi and everything would still work
---
edgy and orange man bad
---
Here's my suggestion
---
 
---
Don't play legion :)
---
I don’t really get the point of your comment. 
---
You agree the DC is shitty, but don’t agree that the camping isn’t also shitty? She failed to get more than one kill because she played a camping game, constantly trying to force a 3-gen situation by not leaving one area where three gens were closest. Then she went for a camping endgame and it didn’t work out, but it probably would have if I hadn’t had a firecracker. Shitty strat gets a shitty result. 
---
I've had 6 sacraficed in front of me in a single game &gt;-&gt; 
---
It's not considered a good perk on anyone. It's best on Legion because he keeps people injured effortlessly but the time the perk saves the killer is pretty insignificant.
---
Yeap I had a game where 3 people dced with 5gens up.. I stealted around until the killer stopped patrolling then worked on a gen to 99% then finished a gen next to it quivkly running to pop the 99%. Then had to loop till I found the hatch. I get left alone alot lol its just a new challenge mode
---
Whats the solution then? Yeah ranting is great and all but how would you fix it? You cant just not let people play with their friends.  You cant just swf dodge cause in a few months you won’t even be able to tell its swf anyways.
---
If you’re struggling to get momentum during the game, try injuring multiple people or leaving the chase earlier if you know it’s a good survivor or a tough area with many windows/pallets.  It’s okay to struggle some games and absolutely stomp others. It’s gonna happen... there’s always another match
---
*She’s running Iron Maiden*
---
Oh yeah if you have literally no other option with opened gates and you don't have an instadown then sure, but there is plenty of people who will camp even when there are many other, better options with gens still up. You are taking one example and trying to apply it to every situation.
---
People who rely on camping as their main strategy aren't good at the game, and the perk shines best against them.
---
I once went on a spree as as Nurse with BBQ and earned one million in five and a half hours.
---
So, if you were to go all out with BBQ each of your six hour days, you'd theoretically make at least seven million.
---
omg yes someone pls do this
---
Can someone provide me the original screen cap of this?
---
wow
---
Whoops, that 175.5% was a mistake, I meant 117.5%. Thanks for bringing that to my attention. 
---
Also I used my hours to easily tell people that I'm not experienced at the game, but also not a total newbie who is talking out of his ass. I did not intend on using it as an argument for anything.
---
The thing is nea never dies
---
ironic your username has haha in it since you can't tell light hearted banter from a serious comment
---
Oh yeah that one. I thought it was called something else for some reason
---
I had a chuckle when I saw that 175% movement speed for not 1 but 2 killers.   Zoooom zoooom zoooom.....out of their minds.  I keep telling people, its not perks or powers...the biggest problem with this game is the map designs. 
---
I'm sorry my dude... I promise I will never do it again &lt;3 It was a one time thing it didn't mean anything to me
---
You are a God amongst men
---
i was in the heat to call her a hacker lol i didnt even mean it
---
thana/sloppy/nurses is a good combo 
---
Yeah except they DC like little bitches, wait till dedicated servers to start spamming those.
---
I’ve seen clown and wraith both like two times out of last 1000 games.

---
I agree. I forgot to adress this in the post because I have a garbage memory and currently am sitting in my bed on mobile (its 22:30 where I live).
---
do you think we're complaining for them to do anything constructive yet
---
They're not going to change the pig this much any time soon.
---
It would literally take the devs over a year to  do this. We are still waiting on Freddy changes that were promised in 2017 and they also said they're still working on Legion.
---
Plus they're doing new killers. Pig isn't going to change.
---
I get it. I'm not super worried about getting 4k games - I just want to feel competitive and not feel like I got the run around. As killer, I don't mind letting someone go either if I'm trashing the survivors.
---
My games seem to be taking longer, which I think is a good thing. It means that I'm able to slow the survivors' progress a bit. I just feel like I really fight for even one kill sometimes.
---
New Killer: The Escaped Psycho Killer with a Chainsaw and a Hook
---
I agree. 
---
grats have fun during reset \^\_\^ 
---
I love the jeans. The top adds some cool tattoos. Not a fan of the head, but i have that too.
---
That's what I do. And since I'm and ace main (big brain), I loot the boxes and usually find a medkit.
---
David is my dad. So anything to make him hotter is a +
---
Why do you want to make RBT more deadly? That's not what they're supposed to do. The only change devs should do is to check the code for keys: to ensure correct untrap percentages.
---
Rip Ace.
---
Can we also have a "surprise hit" score for hitting a survivor right after standing up? Her deviousness points are still too low since most of the time you can't use the dash
---
Sometimes sticking around is the right thing though, so that way the killer is going after the others at the other gate. 
---
I agree, though. Don't be an ass.
---
IMO as a Rank 1 Myers / Hag Killer main, DH is the least worrisome of perks. I get baited once, maybe twice depending on the situation. My terms of best to worst exhaustion perks would be.
---
Sprint Burst. The ability that lets you be anywhere with no risk. A gen with no pallet or window support nearby? That's ok. Just sprint to one. This wastes the most of my time as I lost an initial hit and they can go back to gens with no issue if I don't pursue.
---
Lithe. Nothing worse than chasing a survivor and they jump through a window moving lambo fast in a jungle gym. Aaaand now they are gone. This wastes my time if I didn't injure them. If I did it will keep them off gens a bit.
---
Balanced Landing. It's come to the point where if I see a survivor waiting for me on a ledge I just ignore them. They are baiting me to waste my time walking around and up the hill or stairs only for them to skrt skrt away. That's why I put this lower than Lithe.
---
Dead Hard. You get a measly 5m. I will catch up to you. I already stuff survivors because I assume they have DH if I haven't seen them use an Exhaustion perk yet. Sometimes they get one more loop on a loop, but that's a pallet wasted and 10 seconds at best. Rarely, more pallets wasted (I'll just chase on a gen instead) so now DH is only good for getting to windows which won't matter unless it's a T-Wall. You are also injured which keeps you off of gens and makes you play more scared if you decide not to heal.
---
Thank you! 🐻❤🐥
---
Why it happens?  Because this game is made with spaghetti code.  Literally have crashed out of 6 out of 10 games today from the beginning loading screen.  And this "Complete" game has been released for over 2 years and still feels like an Alpha test.  Actually, it's quite embarrassing how this shit has been going on for so long without a peep as to how they're going to fix it.
---
Queue dodge obvious swf stacks whenever possible. all they do is depip you and eat up all of your time.    
---
Watch Scott jund's how to run basic tiles video and especially learn to master the killer shack loop. 
---
Play nurse and Billy (though I maintain Billy is only really good with insta-saw add-ons and top tier perks.  Keep a clock in your head after you hook a survivor, leave the hook, patrol a gen or 2 and then start heading back.   
---
Also, camping doesn't really work but tunneling absolutely does and you should do it at every opportunity if you want to win. This game is already heavily tilted in the favor or survivors, you don't stand a chance if you further handicap yourself by playing suboptimally to appease entitled baby survivors. 
---
Urban evasion honestly avoids more hooks than DS. Hiding is the real op skill in this game 
---
We need to remove all things that hinder survivors even a little bit
---
I would be OK with with a heal boost tbh. Seeing the killer's aura might be OP idk
---
I was happy getting rank 10 for a survivor, my lord that’s amazing
---
Well one reason is because if you have a Team of Sabos you have a place to hook people since the Basement Hooks can't be destroyed.
---
It’s pretty clear that I’m saying I’m glad her camping didn’t work out, and I’m thankful for firecrackers for helping me perform the end game save. 
---
Finally, someone gets it
---
Pharmacy &gt; Self Care
---
By extension Pharmacy is up there as one of the strongest perks in the game.
---
Lol no worries. There’s no special achievement for reaching rank 1. I’m only rank 6 as survivor right now, highest i’ve been as survivor was rank 5, honestly I think it’s a lot harder to get to rank 1 as survivor. 
---
Lol k.
---
Thanks! Appreciate it! &lt;3
---
They should just remove hook in general,I feel. What's the point of a wiggle feature when there's always a hook near where I get downed.
---
If the killer commits it is a chase extender, only it's a beginning chase extender to run yourself to a loop rather than mid chase extenders where you usually end up injured before using them.
---
The “charge” addons you’re thinking of affect how long you must wait once you press M2 until you throw the hatchet, not the rate at which you charge your shot. 
---
This is incredibly useful because you can get hits in at times you would otherwise not be able to do, because the survivor would be able to get behind something while you are in animation.
---
Hiding is the best way to beat legion? Am I hearing you right? His power literally shows you where ANYONE nearby the person you find and hit with your power. Wrong on that one, mate. 
---
good god. 
---
Glad to hear. Keep training and sooner than later you will be able to rip some tbaggers ass. Or maybe not, we are not supposed to be awesome in everything lol
---
New Killer:chef
---
Me too
---
Why doesnt this have more upvotes?
---
Look I don't really care anymore I just think it's a messy post.
---
Firecrackers are awesome but they are easy to counter (just looking up ir hitting someone cancels out the blind). They are fun though.
---
Stay away from the basement during chases??
---
It's not difficult my guy. 
---
why doesnt this ever happen to me 😫
---
Agreed basement is OP.
---
I suggest a survivor tower that leads to the DbD version of heaven. It'll glow white and have clouds outside with a golden exit gate in the distance. The killer cannot enter the survivor tower but the floor is made of glass so the killer can still see the survivors teabagging at the golden heaven survivor gate.
---
Yeah but killers have advantages 
---
There are so few things that let you see killer auras. 
---
Like... the key add on is very rare, works on a small distance, and eats up key charge super fast. 
---
Object of obsession puts you at a massive disadvantage just to see the killers aura. 
---
Alert is probably one of the better ones, but only works during a break action. 
---
Kindred lvl 3 is hardly ever used and only works if the killer is near the hook. 
---
Other than that, there’s a single killer perk that lets the obsession see the killer, and it’s mega dangerous for the obsession when the gates are powered. 
---
It really doesn’t feel OP to me given the killers have perks to see survivors auras when they hook someone, when survivors are healing within range, when survivors finish generators (two perks that actually do this function), and they get to see these survivors many times a game as well. So I have no pity when it comes to aura reading. BBQ gives tons of extra bonus points AND reveals survivors. I see no reason not to give something similar to survivors. 
---
Friday the 13th has one of the best themes on PS4 … if you're into horror. I would love a DBD theme. 
---
I love how nurse is the one killer on both console and PC that will get legit hate for being good. With those same people being the ones calling you a trash tier baby dolphin a month ago.
---
I saw an animated wallpaper for Freddy on the engine workshop it looked cool so check it out 
---
You don’t care, but you care enough to still comment?
---
Your comments are messier than my posts, buddy. 
---
This please, why can killers even m1?
---
I think you did the right thing 
---
Rude messages are definitely not the reason I play less lmao. I see many people in the community bring up that toxic players message them and that it’s DEFINITELY unnecessary. 
---
I play less during events because of the way BVHR sets up this events. It makes survivors not even play the game. They want their event shit and if they don’t get it, they disconnected.
---
**SO**, what I’m saying is they need to bring back how they used to do events. Keep it with you get something when you finish a special gen. 
---
**You have a nice day.**
---
Ok as someone who actually understands killer and isn’t one of these whiny survivors I can give you facts and not just cry. Legion is low tier, he’s bad. He can secure hits really well when using his ability but it takes four to down so he wastes a lot of time. Technically you can hit without using ability but he’s super slow without so he can’t secure his downs. Right now there’s a bug where you “moonwalk” (literally just walk backwards) and it cancels the chase so it starts their bleed out timer while you’re still technically following them. Using franks mixtape makes it take less hits to down a survivor with your ability so people get grumpy that it didn’t take 12,000 hits for them to get downed. Even though he’s bad survivors hate him because they’ve developed a meta where it’s all about loops and adrenaline/deadhard/sprint burst where you get the killer to follow you and loop them eternally while your team does gens. Legion doesn’t follow the meta because he’s and angsty teen who doesn’t give a shit. So basically he’s somewhat bad, but because survivors can’t follow their meta and actually have to hide they cry about it all the time and think it’s not fair. You can still beat legion easily by just partial looping him and forcing him to only ever hit you with his ability and waste a lot of his time while your team does all the gens. In other words he’s pretty easy to beat overall just usually one person gets a bit screwed and because survivors don’t know how to adapt and just learn how to hide they are all crying even though he’s bad. 
---
If your matches average 12 minutes which is about the time I noticed mine take and get 30k bp per match which is really easy to do with bbq, you would probably get around 900k blood points per day 
---
The leave button is for leaving. You're the one adding conditions that don't exist. DCing isn't even reportable - BHVR tracks the percentage and if you stay below ~30-40% it's not even a ban.    
---
The reality is being first found there is a huge chance you simply sit on the hook for 2 minutes until you bleed to death or proceed to be unsafe farmed or get tunneled. Maybe 5% of my games I'll be solo with a 3 man swf loaded in - only time I can expect to see some plays and excitement. The rest of the time it's everyone for themselves.
---
You can't even process that even if DC was an insta-ban I've been keeping my percentage low but simply loading in, finding killer, then suiciding on hook in less than a minute per game. What are you gonna do - ban shitty players too ? 
---
The real problem is BHVR can't decide if they want an immersive horror experience where urban evasion nea is too scared to unhook you or a competitive assymetrical team game that's all about saving your teammates. 
---
Guess you are a nut job after all... 
---
You can’t use statistics to make a claim about human behavior without accounting for the human element. If you can’t see that then I suppose there’s nothing else I can tell you. 
---
Ok I don't understand the memes cause idk what y'all talking about I'm being honest I need some help
---
I just give them hatch if it's going to be a big production to find/down them. Walk to a corner of the map and go do laundry or something. 
---
Yes. 
---
Buy Legion DLC 9k Shards &gt; Then you can buy Susie for cells/shards
---
Don't buy dlcs with cells. Only buy skins with cells or shards otherwise you're getting a bad deal. Always buy the chapter bundle if using money to get dlcs.
---
Don’t like the bear trap rng, her lunge makes a dick load of noise, and I honestly just thought Amanda was a bitch in the movies 
---
-And then as you start to Mori one of them, they ALL quit at the same time and tell you to *kill yourself lmao* in post-chat.
---
I mean, I guess because anything referring to the president is inherently political, but generally speaking, I don't really factor the fact he whines so much into why I dislike him; there are policy and philosophy reasons for that.
---
I always hide in the locker afterwards. The killer would come back and see an empty basement and will leave and then I'll EV out of there 
---
That's fair enough, I hate exploits too, i think a vaulting killer is horrifying which is great in my eyes which is more what I was referring to.
---
Technician is way underrated on this.  The fact that it suppresses working-on-gen ratcheting noises is really its strongest benefit.
---
I've done something similar, though it was a different scenario with the killer camping the hatch and 3 gens left. I just popped all three so they had to decide whether to go for a door or stay at the hatch. Got the hatch in the end ;)
---
It only takes one example to contradict what saiyu said.
---
&gt; Pretty much everyone can agree that generators are done way too fast and most killers have to rely on Hex:Ruin to even have a chance at winning.
---
I had a match the other day where I found and downed my first survivor very early on. They were within basement range so I took them there and during this time two gens popped. Going to the basement added some extra time but not much, so those gens pooped very quickly, and a third was near completion when I found it. I wasn't running Ruin.
---
So yeah, even though it was kind of my fault for the poor basement choice, gens can go insanely fast if several people attach to a gen right away. This like never happens though. I feel like the only killers who need it are ones like Trapper
---
&gt; Firstly, to help Freddy with the chase I would buff his movement speed to 120% or 117,5%. This change would also help him patrol the map easier.
---
This is just really ridiculously fast. His main issue is that people can use healing to break out and his transition is too slow. Fix those two things and you'r gravy
---
&gt; Backwater Swamp (Both of them): The hatch and Hex totems are a nightmare to find on this map. The solution is to not make them that.
---
Well it shouldn't be a walk in the swamp to find them
---
It’s almost as if... *thats the point*
---
but the clown is an incredible meal too???
---
I dunno. I like the eyeball perks. I have terrible geographic memory
---
It truly is. 
---
Fuck, Marry, Kill: Survivors.  GO
---
And other funny jokes you can tell yourself
---
I'd take Hag over that honestly.
---
Get over NOED if every other suvivor has decisive strike
---
The last event be like 
---
Don’t you love how survivors want you to take the game however they want it? Like all flashlight tbagging flashlight clicking perk abusing and eternal loooing and they’re like “wow you’re bad” then one of them gets hit once and they dc and cry like they are literally the elementary school bullies who someone stands up once and they go home crying to their mom
---
Boner killer, maybe.
---
From the moment you are in a killer lobby you can invite all players, killer and survivors, into a chat party or group messaging (if their privacy settings allow it) :
---
Hold PS button for quick menu
---
Select Dead By Daylight...Currently playing with
---
Select Chat in Party or Send Message.
---
You can select who you want to add or select all. If you just want to add the survivors you can.
---
I would not like it forced personally. It is possibly the most toxic I have played. Many players have specifically changed their general privacy settings that affect everything just to stop receiving bad messages from this game.
---
The patch was intended to decrease wait times by making killers a viable option during the event.
---
The problem is survivor is still way easier to earn coins on even after the patch so it didn't increase the number of killers. Not enough killers=Long wait times to get a killer.
---
Playing survivor right now is like queuing as DPS in a MMO dungeon finder. Killers are the Tanks. 
---
it wasnt a Patch to magically decreases wait times, it just increased the Killer rewards
---
And this matters to my argument how exactly? I get the first paragraph but I never said anything about banning anyone. You are the one claming that so if you could point to that in my comment I'd appreciate it.
---
WGLF is the best perk tyvm
---
Don't confuse being a nut job and being a dick. I know you know the difference.
---
If you can't see criticizing me but not the parent comment isn't a major double standard then you're beyond fucking hope
---
Just say it. Just say it's a double standard. You know it's true
---
Don't forget the rookie mistake of running along the edge of the map. Pretty much ensures you're dead. 
---
Imo survivor is way easier. Im rank 1 on both right now and I got to rank 1 on survivor purely messing around using no mither
---
It's an incredibly important feature they should be adding to the game. I'm not colourblind so I can only imagine how you must feel :(
---
"Slaves to an outdated meta"
---
According to this "We're going to live forver", a perk with 0 actual gameplay benefits is "B" tier, better than about half the perks in the game, including Small game, a perk that not only helps you efficiently prevent **NOED** but is also an effective counter to two of the killers in the game as a bonus. 
---
Also according to this, Self Care is a better perk than Borrowed Time, one of these perks allows you to waste 32-40 seconds healing yourself, and another one of these allows you to perform saves that would be impossible without it. 
---
A big takeaway from this list is that survivors that voted on these put themselves over their team which certainly seems like a reliable source to base my beliefs off of.
---
Does Julie still come if I buy with shards?
---
Lol 
---
What do you mean ? 
---
Please don't tell me you think wraith is OP ^^
---
I've been maining Dwight long enough to actually hear the locker door noise in my head when I look at the second pic.
---
I like your stuff. Keep it up! It's original and cool! :) 
---
I honestly have no idea. Maybe they forgot to change the text or just didn't care to? Maybe it was an unintentional change? Who knows.
---
Anyway, here's the guy's post about if you want to check it out.

---
No Mither should be 1st place
---
I see. You seem to be under the impression that TR and stain somehow pass off as aura reading abilities. They do not. Also, as already stated, Alert only works when the killer performs a break action. As for Dark Sense, that only works when YOU finish a gen. Meaning you’ll probably use it no more than twice during the match if you team knows how to focus gens. Otherwise it’s only useful in the endgame. 
---
While I’m glad you agree WGLF needs a buff, I’m making my buff suggestion to counterbalance the only killer perk that performs the same functionality as WGLF (potential 100% more bloodpoints). Whereas now you’re adding in killers need more more stealth, when stealth is already built into the kits of killers who need it as part of their main power. Hell, level 1 Myers completely trumps all aura reading abilities as a base power. That’s an unnecessary buff for killers, whereas I’m trying to balance out aura reading. 
---
Just spin on that bitch. My mouse sensitivity is in the stratosphere just for playing killer
---
Getting hanged and dipped in tea.
---
Just use urban or calm spirit
---
Except they could also not. People don't bring add-ons like Iri Heads because they give a shit about my fun. And the survivors I've gotten in my playtime certainly don't value me over them. If I'm playing a match that will almost certainly end with nothing but boredom or frustration, since that's all Legion brings, and I'm given the option to leave at my will, I will do.
---
DbD is not an e-sport. It has ranks but they mean next to nothing. Games are 5-15 minutes a piece. You will not remember the game where a guy DC'd at the start a few hours later, a frustrating match can kill my drive to play altogether, so I'm gonna look out for myself and DC from games that will likely piss me off.
---
Fuming Mixtape is fucking broken. SEEING the GENERATOR PROGRESS?????!?!? Fucking no skill ass busted crutch addon.

Np... luv u &lt;3 #notgay

P3 Dwight, David, or Ace. 
---
If survivors are dicking aroind instead of doing gens, they are bad.
---
I meant that saying that the first idea is bad doesn't mean that ALL ideas about the subject are bad. In the post I gave two ideas for a reason you know.
---
I know that the totems and hatch spawn at the edges, because I have seen it happen multiple times. Even during this event a Hex totem spawned twice in the corner of a map and I have seen a hatch at the edge also twice. That is where I got the idea that totems and the hatch spawn at the edge, because I have seen it multiple times in the most recent patch.
---
https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
Yup. I hate being two seconds into a game, I won’t event be near a gen yet and all of a sudden “HEY THERE BOI! WANT SOME CHAINSAW?!”
---
Like.... I was crouched and not even running openly. Wtf. 
---
No it's perk that like ds rewards you as player fucking up. 
---
I dont know what else to say to you man. This ain’t worth my time to take a bunch of screenshots or link a bunch of threads so go search through the controversial page on the sub if you really care, I promise it won’t take long unless you continuously deny that the what you’re seeing is a reality.
---
I suppose I’d like to see you in a religious argument if you’re the type of guy who needs evidence for every little thing.
---
I dont have sound on, so I had to rewatch twice to see what actually happened. Nice escape, feels bad for the trapper thou lol
---
&gt; I promise it won’t take long unless you continuously deny that the what you’re seeing is a reality.
---
Holy fuck the irony is actually killing me right now oh my fucking god
---
Really useful against doctor and ruin if you're trying to hit greats with a 50% chance of not getting punished if you miss the skillcheck. I think it's an excellent perk for people who are trying to practice hitting great skillchecks. 
---
I mean, you can see him during the flickers in the dream transition. And if people didn't disrespect Freddy and his dream transition and stay on stuff during it, he wouldn't b3 ripping them off of stuff. Freddy should stay invisible in the waking world and flicker during the transition only.
---
And all loops should have some mind game potential 
---
Maybe you’ll realize you’re simply ignoring the surveys that prove otherwise? It’s quite common for people to do, and seeing as you provided only 2 pieces of inadequate evidence and continue to act as if they’re the prove-all texts I’m not surprised you’re retaliating this way. 
---
If you ignore the rest of my post where I clearly clarify further that the scenario you have described ignores 90% of the situations where people camp, then sure. But if you wish to be pedantic like that, then:
---
&gt;We're pointing out that the perk is only strong against people who camp and tunnel
---
This is the post you have directly responded to. In no way, shape or form what you have said contradicts what I've said. It is still only strong against people who camp and tunnel.
---
That’s like saying DS is a counter to being downed. You aren’t technically wrong but it’s not healthy thinking. 
---
You can't hide when he's in frenzy anyway, if you're in his terror radius it will show him where you are.
---
Uhm you can disable post game chat. Unless they changed it. 
---
ya I agree I do not think it could even be that hard just change the totem and gen aura to a color of the users choice also scratch marks problem would be solved and no one can use it for a advantage 
---
Was gonna say exactly this. I played a couple of games with nurse to see what all the console fuss was about. Shortly after that experiment, I bp farmed with doc and dumped bp in her to level 40.
---
Urban is actually really good as long as you use it to juke around killers vision, not to crouch everywhere you go
---
The community isn't big enough to split up the playerbase. Do you want even longer queue times? Why do you think there isn't a normal and ranked queue separate it's all combined? If the playerbase was bigger I think it would be cool but they will not split up the niche community that play this game it will kill it.
---
If you are in the rank 20 or close it will always take a while, it will get better the more you rank up. From 17 onwards it should be instaqueues
---
NOED was made to reward bad killers, just like DS was made to reward survivors who dont know how to juke or out run the killer.
---
No it’s right, his ability forces survivors to work separately. Like I’ve said, the point of legion from the developers perspective (whether good idea or bad) was to break up the swf loop the killer meta. Legion forces a team apart and forces them to hide not just try to outrun. He can only see you if he A: hits another survivor, so he has to find and hit someone first and
---
B: if you are within his mediocre terror radius. Which means if you are hiding properly you shouldn’t be sitting right next to your ally who is getting chased, you should be somewhere else getting gens done while he takes forever to down your friend. Hiding is the best thing you can do against legion. And if you are too dumb to stay away from your friend? Disperse the blows, while he chases one the other can mend and vice versa. Don’t try to talk shit about things you don’t know anything about. Just because YOU don’t know how to counterplay him doesn’t mean there isn’t counterplay.
---
&gt; If survivors are dicking aroind instead of doing gens, they are bad.
---
They could could have spawned in a poor spot or need to search a chest or something. There are many reasons why someone isn't doing a gen right at the start that doesn't mean they're bad
---
&gt; I meant that saying that the first idea is bad doesn't mean that ALL ideas about the subject are bad. In the post I gave two ideas for a reason you know.
---
And I only criticized one of them. No need to be so defensive. And either way, that's still not a "counter" to my point
---
&gt; I know that the totems and hatch spawn at the edges, because I have seen it happen multiple times. Even during this event a Hex totem spawned twice in the corner of a map and I have seen a hatch at the edge also twice. That is where I got the idea that totems and the hatch spawn at the edge, because I have seen it multiple times in the most recent patch.
---
I never said that they don't. wtf dude where are you getting all this shit? It's like you read the words just fine but comprehend them in the weirdest possible way
---
You clearly don't understand the conversation.
---
Here's the latest story to explain the conversation and perspectives: 
---
I am killer, I find the obsession the first minute (I don't have any obsession perks btw) and get them down in 1 minute.
---
They hit their DS, no biggie I keep chasing them. I knock them down 30 seconds later. Obsession DCs, obsession's friends DC. 
---
I find the last survivor, give them chase points, etc. 
---
"Reported for farming" says the obsession.
---
--------------
---
That is just one example of many salty bitches that DC in first minute and then watch me farm blood points with the remaining players.
---
Nah, Huntress should be free for everyone, the thread says that Huntress originally was a paid DLC for consoles. Did you guys originally have to buy David too (I suppose that would make sense since he's paired with The Huntress...)?
---
Things that are actually obvious: You are not rank one. 
---
nurse
---
&gt; Please read the last paragraph of your second comment.
---
What? I didn't say that totems *don't* spawn there, that's me saying that most don't. Do you understand how those two things are different?
---
sloppy butcher is the best perk for Legion.
---
They don't do that because it's already hard to tell what is or isn't a legitimate DC. I dunno if you've noticed, friend, but this isn't the most stable of video games and the developers at least for now are erring on the side of not punishing people for their game not quite working properly.
---
Hmmmmm !
---
I’d rather just be killed asap tbh, I play a game to have fun and a challenge, points are just a secondary piece for me 
---
The issue you run into with "Hatch Close" Ability is the ability to hold a game hostage. Last survivor can avoid doing generators just to spite the killer at the end after they close hatch and there is still 1/2 gens to be done. 
---
I agree that spending to much time, especially 30minutes which is easily 1 to 1.5 games worth of time at a hatch standoff is ridiculous. Just Hit them and get the game done with. 
---
Please read the second sentence in my last comment
---
If you “having something” meant something then clearly then votes up there would be different and people would agree with you, but as you and I can see that isn’t the case. 
---
You can have all the “evidence” you want but you can’t deny that a number of people disagreeing with you in relation to your initial conversation with me and in relation to the validity of your evidence stands for something. 
---
Those people are not people arguing that the sub is killer sided. Those are people saying that you are wrong in claiming that the sub is survivor sided and that your evidence is meaningless. 
---
This has nothing to do with “the sub”. This is you, and while I’d like to be as nice as possible there’s no way I can suggest that you’re borderline delusional at this point without outright saying it. So yeah, what world are you living in, because it clearly isn’t the same as the rest of us.
---
No idea ;)
---
&gt;  I know you said not all spawn, but some do, which is a problem.
---
Oh my god this is absurd. It is not a problem that they spawn on the edges what the goddamn fuck
---
"No no," The Entity said, taking the fully-loaded revolver from Evil Cowboy with and eyepatch, Rex Murderkill (available in March, *you heard it here first!*), you have to use your lasso and dynamite, bullets will only make her angrier and her graffiti more obscene.
---
I had this feeling to an Bathrobe Ace named Lord Pallet that was flashlight clicking and tea-bagging, I got him in two different lobbies after a game as the Trapper, but the people had bad ping or didn't connect, the third time it was a go and instead of finishing my ritual, I straight-up went Clown with Bleach and Ether 10%. He 4%'d off the hook (which I only realized AFTER downing him again) and he stopped struggling in the basement. I feel bad, but it's harder than normal against guys like that.
---
I think that’s a biiiiiiiiiiit much. I do try to remain as unbiased as possible. 
---
It would be interesting if it were to build. 
---
Like you gain an extra 1%/2%/3% bonus to unhooking with each survivor you unhook up to 4 survivors (when you max out your 100% BP’s). Then by the end you are unhooking with a 12% increase, more than any other survivor perk. 
---
it's just killers avoiding SWF.
---
I love seeing these egotistic bastards getting shit on.
---
&gt; If you “having something” meant something then clearly then votes up there would be different and people would agree with you, but as you and I can see that isn’t the case. 
---
lol this is absurd logic. So you're saying that the fact the guy saying the subreddit is killer sided got upvoted means he's right?
---
&gt; You can have all the “evidence” you want but you can’t deny that a number of people disagreeing with you in relation to your initial conversation with me and in relation to the validity of your evidence stands for something. 
---
It actually means fucking nothing but go off I guess thinking that teenagers on reddit upvoting shit is ~powerful~
---
At the end of the day you simply claimed that this subreddit favors both sides and the parent comment claimed this subreddit favors killers with nothing to back that up and I have something.
---
It's just that killers in this sub love to pick on SWF and I can't help wondering "why?". Do people think devs will delet it from the game? Anyway, that's just the game. 4 man DS is annoying? So is Omega Blink Nurse, Iri Head Huntress, ... and those are way easier to pull of or come by than a 4 man 4 DS.
---
But still killers like to act like SWF destroys their experience, when in reality it's just them being bad against decent survivors. My point is, even though Omega Blink or Iri Head are way more broken or boring to go against than a SWF team, you don't see survivors complaining about it all the time like killers do about SWF.
---
Anyway, it's not like I see you complaining about SWF, I'm just talking about the sub in general.
---
How is it not? If a Hex happens to spawn in one of these edge totems you have to go to the edge of the biggest maps in the game. How is that not a problem? It is frustrating. The hatch is even worse because you have to practically circle the entire map. How is that not a problem? You never explained why it isn't a problem.

Rank 20 nurses are beautiful to juke but rank 1 nurses are good and cant be juked most of the time.

If im in rank 20 nurse.

I think myers is one of the funniest to play with and against. And it represents good what is he doing in the film: Stalk
---
#Cowardly Dog pantomiming intensifies
---
I think 1/2/3% is way too low and if other people unhook it won't stack for you. 50% is perfectly balanced IMO because it's "only" half a second faster but still recognizable.
---
SC is amazing.  I'm not going to change your mind, so go ahead and keep using whatever perk you like.  I was just pointing out what's strongest.  If you have a team that's super altruistic, that can change things, especially with SWF...
---
i mean, you can still see the wraith but very faintly, it sometimes surprises me whenever i catch someone off guard
---
Ah. Yeah that’s true. 
---
Would you say that either of his deep wound options are "fun and enjoyable to play against"? If the answer is no, he needs to change. Complete rework of his power really. The vaulting stuff is fine is my point, its that he can do that mixed with his annoying shit that makes it annoying.
---
all sorted now but thank u!! I’ll remember this for the future
---
sorry should have clarified, you're *supposed* to hide after he's hit you with his power once, like when he's chasing you. It doesn't show your location anymore once you're tagged, or if you're already tagged.
---
&gt; I have to RING. A. BELL.
---
But sometimes we can't tell where it's coming from and sometimes it's silent. That's OP.
---
&gt; considerably slows me down
---
And then you zoom at me! You have to let me zoom first. Otherwise sprint burst was a waste of a perk slot.
---
&gt;  it's my job to kill you. 🤷‍♂️
---
You also have to make sure I have fun. This is why you can't kill one person to get them out of the match until you hook everyone twice. It's not fun for them
---
And you’ve gone off about the whole killer sided survivor sided tangent again...
---
You don’t have people’s actual answers. It was 100 out of 90,000 people. That’s a little over a tenth of a percent. Everyone can see it but you, and get you refuse to address that. 
---
Both of which are true, no?
---
The problem with the pig's traps is you only remember the bad ones on both sides.  The killer remembers the one that gets removed in less than 30 seconds, and the survivor remembers the one where they failed 3 times and died before they could get to the 4th station.  Overall I think it's a lame mechanic because it stop people from playing the game.
---
Who am I? You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
---
has nothing to do with the character, rather the skill of the player.
---
Why?!  Jesus the amount of killers that MUST KILL EVERYONE is disgusting.  Take your pip and GTFO.
---
Fucking biggie cheese is flexing on me. I can die happy now.
---
You mean all my games in red ranks?
---
My whole problem this entire time is the double standard. Of course I go back to that.
---
The parent comment said this is a killer sided sub
---
I said, no it's survivor sided with my low sample surveys
---
One of these is objectively worth more than the other
---
That is a fact
---
yet the community as a whole rewarded one and not the other
---
how do you not understand this
---
I had the most success with Doctor and Haunted ground. They knew all 5 were lit and by the time I got to 3 on DH, they knew it was too late to cleanse anything so the game was over already. Lullaby is kinda overkill if you get a lead. People won’t want to even touch a generator at that point. Plus we need all 5 totems to so just in case someone brings Leader to cancel the cleansing reduction or you can still swipe people who attempt to bodyblock. 
---
I think the biggest issue when trying to rank up as Survivor is feeling the need to be altruistic, sometimes you just gotta cut your losses and leave/ ignore the hooked guy and get atleast hatch gens done.
---
Although I wasnt doing that since I was doing dumb no mither looping builds and going for saves that would kill me (was trying to help randoms get their lanterns) and still ranked up.
---
And I'm on PS4
---
I CHALLENGE YOU TO MORTAL KOMBAT!
---
Simple fixes to bring all the killers closer in line: 
---
\- Nerf nurse by giving her .5s additional fatigue on each blink, regardless of swing duration. Her fatigue is simply not punishing enough to make her anything but the best killer in the game by a considerable margin. Longer fatigue means you actually have to get on top of survivors instead of missing 2 blinks, brief pause, miss 2 more, brief pause, GOTTEM.
---
\- Nerf Billy by giving him LF's movespeed while charging his chainsaw. Chainsaw now has a 5 second power cooldown.
---
\- Nerf Spirit by adding 0.3 seconds to the base activation time for her ability, making short range power usage less effective. 
---
\-Huntress cannot use Iri head + belt. She must chose one.
---
All killers can now be balanced appropriately through general map/gameplay/perk changes. Much easier than trying to buff every other killer up to the same level as the top 4.
---
Your point about the generators could be due to the change in a Dwight perk (Leader, I believe), and I guess a lot of people must be running it
---
You. Are. A. Genius.
---
You kinda answered it yourself a bit there. With some killers self healing can become a HUGE time waster. Sloppy Butcher is most common but for some killers who run Clourophobia, Nurses Calling or Stridor/Bloodhound, anything to cut down time spent healing is well met. I still run Autodidact because I can heal them faster even with my first two skillchecks than they could by themselves. Also nothing feels better than finally getting 5 stacks and just damn near instahealing. 
---
Really appreciate the kind words, bud. :)
---
Some people just be like that
---
Didn't he say it was impossible for anyone but nurse essentially, he's basically saying other killers can't handle gen rush.. if I understand what the man is saying correctly
---
Not running No Mither, Resilience, Dead Hard, This Is Not Happening and just speed running every gen despite Ruin. 
---
Could you please explain to me how Small Game is worse than WGLF from a gameplay standpoint?
---
getting crushed by 2 walls and having her blood be put into spray paint cans
---
I have actually seen more people getting off shoulders with the newest Hook Min/Max Distance thing, but you have to remember that Hook Vacuum is a thing. I can't recall the number of times I have got to 99% wiggle on shoulder only for the killer to just power slide into a hook animation. I usually play killer and Its a little ridiculous how much it accounts for getting those hooks especially with a perk like Iron Grasp. 
---
&gt; What I don't understand is how is it better for a teammate to heal you?  
---
I subscribe to the belief that the longer survivors are in a trial, the worse their escape chances become. Ideally you want as many healthy survivors as possible, sure overall you might be missing a few seconds due to how multiple players on the same generator works, however being completely healed frees up that survivor to be able to do other things, such as distract the killer for longer.
---
Now the issue I have with Self Care is it's considered one of the best perks in the game despite the fact that it slows a survivor down by 32-40 seconds, a killer that's wise to this can use that healing time to their advantage and chase someone else, whereas if they can be healed in half that time by one survivor (or even a quarter, We'll make it is a fucking amazing perk in that regard) which would free them up to be more reliable asset faster, and on top of this, in many cases survivors will use selfcare when it's really not appropriate.
---
I was in a game a few days ago, 2 randoms and myself were alive and we just needed to get one generator done, simple task, one of us would just need to run away from the generator and keep the killer chasing us while the other two speed through the small amount of progress left on it.
---
Lo and behold the two randoms both ran away whenever they were hurt but not being chased and would self care themselves back to full health, the generator that was around 3/4 of the was complete gets back to 0% and I can't do enough progress by myself before the killer finds me trying to actually do the objective while the other two pissed about with their healing.
---
Calling Self Care "the best perk in the game", as many people seem to have done, is a bad idea. Sure it's probably great in the right hands, but in the wrong hands it is absolubtely detrimental to the team. Nothing is worse than "Oh this situation is bad but if that last player is on a generator we can easily survive" just to see them selfcaring in the corner of the map while a generator loses its progress.
---
Imagine not running around the map as a Stealth Ambulance to heal your dumbass teammates with the speed of sound. 
---
This post is brought to you by the Empathy/Autodidact squad. 
---
Fantastic! Does Franklins proc on the chainsaw? 
---
Reducing his sensitivity might help and make use of the fact that he has no cool down when missing in feral frenzy. If you are right next to a surivvor you can spin and spam if they try to 360 you. In most cases your attack has somewhat of a lunge to it which helps greatly catching up to someone running right in front of you. 
---
For viewing, you can try shadow born. Never tried it in feral frenzy but should help you with the constrained view. 
---
Because it's the killer's job to kill - their objective is winning, and winning is fun.
---
Why do survivors have to survive? Just take your pip and get the fuck on a hook.

---
Tbf, you have to grind and spend blood points to use ultra rare add-ons, and then once you use them, they're used up. It's different than SWF, in that SWF is an inexhaustible, free advantage.
---
&amp; it's not really 'bad against decent survivors', it's that SWF survivors can communicate with each other. Even I do it as a SWF. Think about it: you're being chased, so you can tell your SWF teammates, 'killer is chasing me, do generators!' or you pass by the ruin totem &amp; you can give that information out. You can also coordinate as a team. That's not being a 'decent survivor', that's a group of people chatting on a third party system.
---
From a SWF POV you're just playing a game with your friends, but from the killer POV, anything you do is being communicated to the entire team so you don't really have any chance at taking control of the match.
---
I got 3 gen grabs on the same survivor today, playing as freddy. Either that person has 0 idea how to play the game or  I faced a bot. It really screwed over the rest of the team.
---
The vibe I get from Spirit is that she is travelling through limbo.
---
Because they must find the totems before completing all gens.
---
I suppose thats the result of having little to no low rank players left in the matchmaking. Hopefully rank reset might help him out a bit. That or he is going to become a legendary killer by the time he reaches rank 17
---
What level do u have to be to prestige?
---
Why waste a perk slot when self care works just fine without it? There's a lot more useful perks to use in it's place...
---
I’ve been using Alert, Sprint Burst, Vigil and Prove Thyself recently... Super fast gens, always know where the killer is and my Sprint Burst feels like it comes back instantly thanks to Vigil.
---
Legion in general, if it has Mixtape it ends sooner which only makes it better, not worse
---
There's far more useful perks
---
Reset is every 13th of the month I'm pretty sure

Nonsense. People do escape from Legion — I have seen it happen. The vast majority of people failing to escape from Legion are simply not escaping well enough. The reason is because it is unreasonably hard to do.
---
People also do pressure SWFs enough to kill them. The vast majority of people having trouble with SWFs are just not pressuring them well enough. The reason is because it is unreasonably hard to do.
---
It would be hilarious running from a tiny killer I was thinking of how they can make it fair without making it also pointless for the killer that I'm sure is the hardest part lmao 
---
Honestly the worst ones are those fens and neas with neon hair who run shit like OOO, DS, ADR and SC... you know the ones
---
They either make you miserable and teabag amd moonwalk and fucking flex on you so hard.
---
Or they go down after 30 seconds, miss their ds and dc
---
There is no inbetween
---
Pig and Clown mainly.
---
I mean the first part of your comment is unnecessary but if you look at him with a beard he has that rugged appeal going for him. To each their own. 
---
It's on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbEJtgbeOBU) aswell for the ones intrested :)
---
This would be way too easy for the killer if he finds Laurie, which will be especially easy due to her having Object of Obsession. This is actually a pretty cool idea though. I wish they would do mini-game modes with all of the killers.
---
Same here never played nurse before got my first kill this morning and at the institute as well I was only a little proud
---
The point of that point wasn't so much "GEN RUSH REEEEEEEEEEE" but rather "if you don't like NOED cleanse totems instead of humping gens all game ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
---
As somone who plays both Killer and Survivor I understand that generators are the only objective for Survivors and there's little real reason to do anything else. But I also do my duty and remove dull totems and try to be stealthy instead of holding down shift until my keyboard breaks.
---
imagine using self care 
---
Tbh tho
---
&gt;not to crouch everywhere you go
---
This is basically why we complain, otherwise we wouldn't really care :-)
---
Oh my fucking god. So someone isnt interested in playing they just want to screw with people?
---
What killer was that? I might've met one today. 
---
I like this. With Aftercare being out, Wake Up's aura showing should definitely be buffed. It would help you be a shining beacon, leading the survivors to their escape so they don't have to prowl around the trial walls if they forgot the positions.
---
BHVR: Why does everyone use MLGA?
---
Also BHVR: We won't ban people who DC every other match.
---
Thanks! I didn't know that.
---
* Screenshot highlighting that everyone disconnected.
---
Well, you wrote quite a bit.
---
Yeah, Adrenaline doesn’t exist in this convo because if you get to end game, it’ll activate no matter what. Dead Hard is the worst of the four base line though. Fall for it once, and the killer will know to get right up your ass to take you down. Sprint burst is just above dead Hard because it’s once and done. Once you’re in the middle of a chase, you’re not letting them get the exhaustion back for them to use it again. Lithe is good but also map dependent. Use it on Lery’s and you get away decently. Use it on Autohaven, killer is still on you. Balanced Landing is the best however if you are able to use it. Just the fact you get 75% stun regen and a speed boost is good, plus you always get the fall recovery time back, which is good for keep killers off your tail when you drop off somewhere.
---
Sure, exhaustion add-ons do exist, but for Pig/Huntress you’d need to already be injured for it to have it to have any effect. So this renders Dead Hard useless most of the time if they didn’t use it. Especially for pig, considering you need to be in the dying state for it to have any effect (which is why I also believe she is a weak killer). But for Doctor, you need to use an ultra rare add-on (I don’t remember if there’s any others that give exhaustion), but putting them in tier 3 with exhaustion is good, rendering any perk useless while healthy. Clown is a bit different. More so, they’d likely already used the perk (besides fookin’ dead ‘ard), but none the less, you could hit them with the bottle to render it useless, but if it’s sprint burst/Lithe, then it’s not that much counter play since those are easy to pull off.
---
Final Summation: balanced Landing reigns supreme, then Lithe, then sprint burst, then dead hard. Adrenaline trumps all of these though.
---
apparently a majority of the community calls walking backwards moonwalking
---
The idea is to 1. Confuse survivors who are watching red stain, or 2. (in this case) lose the chase TECHNICALLY, so that the deep wounds counter goes down while they follow you.
---
That’s not how that works lmao. Doesn’t matter how good you are if your team blocks windows and wastes every pallet because outside of rank 20 you can’t loop killers around trees 
---
Ahh memories. I remember being a black metal Jeff early on and survivors would often flee gens for a sec until they realised they were safe. Good times.
---
Thank you! I completely understand your position on the grind to P3. I feel like it was worth it in the end because now I have exposure to more rares and can replenish my addons faster. I feel like I've definitely seen you before! Good luck in your games. I'll notify you when you happen upon one of my lobbies.
---
A lot of the time I agree. But there are plenty of times when he killer comes, hits a gen, thinks eh saw u there, walls around the hen, and U UE around the gen our of sight, wasting his time in looking and allowing u to go straight back to working.
---
The nurse game is hard on console, I've only ever gotten 2 k's and dont touch her anymore. I leveled her for her unlockables off of other characters rewards because the grind wasnt worth it for me. Depending on if I get enough points to finish this 2nd cosmetic from the event I might do the same
---
I blured the salty chatlog names except my own. Plus wym oversaturated content
---
Imagine missing DS and blaming you. Also, you aren’t supposed to bodyblock when you’re exposed, that survivor who messaged you is a goddamn idiot. Stealthy does not equal bad. Stealth is an important aspect of survivor gameplay. That being said, prioritizing stealth over doing generators is an indicator that you’re bad. Relying on stealth and not being able to survive for a decent amount of time during chases either means you’re bad, or you just got very unlucky in mindgames. However, there’s no excuse if you get downed that fast on cold wind tiles unless it’s a huntress spirit or nurse. 
---
Because balance.  The 4k equivalent for survivors would be all 4 survivors complaining that they all escaped, but got put on the hook, too.  Do you hear this?  No, because it's obviously massively imbalanced.  This game is and has always been killer sided for kills per game.  Killers average 2.5-3.5 kills per game when comparing across ALL ranks.  Why?  Because killer has an incredibly low skill floor, and balancing an asymmetrical horror game is about as fun as dragging your genitals through nettles.  The game SHOULD be balanced based on average kills per game because each player in the game is represented by one human.  The balance system should make killers average 2k, and survivors survive half their games.  Anything else is just BHVR's bullshit ranking system.
---
Sometimes killers do it when they get looped for long, sometimes just because they want to.. Farm BP, pip? I don't know.
---
You know you're screwed when you see the killer standing still (not dcing) and getting stuck in the middle of a vault. Sure enough, second later you're dangling on a hook with the killer nodding like mad.
---
I messaged him and he heard me. He didn’t think I could fit in there 😂
---
That was painful to read, I know I should have stopped at "whiny survivors". It's not about "meta" it's about literally ignoring game mechanics.
---
This is definitely one of my favorite shitposts on this sub.
---
Im unsure, its possible though.
---
Right, its been forever since I watched it
---
It is a kind of BS mechanic, but when I get 3 min queues in the event I would rather wait than deal with toxicity all game by P3 Claudettes who would ruin MY match
---
Probably because they saw how useless their team is while on hook.
---
Good luck finding an unopened chest now that plunderer's was buffed.
---
thank you!! 
---
So bad survivors. Go on it's okay to say it
---
honestly, this.
---
Because running the perk causes the person to guarantee save and protection attempts.
---
Still needs actual in game advantage
---
just remember youre part of the reason this community is so toxic and youre a detriment to the games life span
---
Why I love Myers, you can have completely different matches depending on addons. Also, why Franklins when you have Fragment anyways?
---
Umm I’m not sure about original (I bought the game back in March) but about a year ago when I bought the game it was free.

It goes without saying 😏

noed is a dull totem unless all the gens are done

This is amazing! This is exactly what DBD needs, some smiles to counter the sea of toxicity. They all look so cute! Well done for this (:
---
It's always the Nea's and the Will-I-Ams.
---
Forgive me for I have sinned, I have started DCing at toxic Survivors or when I'm on death hook with a camping or hardcore tunneling killer :(
---
How do I repent and undo his cursed saltmine inside my heart? I want to enjoy the game again :(
---
The killers aren't the only ones that can devour the hope of the other side...
---
I could have survived a match with a random but all of a sudden after a game with good connection wall I'm on hook and a teammate ttys to save me major lag starts to occur interrupting his save and not allowing him to pull me off hook
---
Thanks - no cooldown - that changes this quite a bit.
---
https://youtu.be/VZFCXvAr-zQ?t=20
---
Is the sensitivity change global, or only for one killer?
---
Fuming's alright in my book too
---
Right. So break all dull totems or at least memorize their locations which would extend the game
---
What's your build?
---
Can't wait for the Freddy Rework :D 
---
At higher ranks I always help the last survivor. It helps me stay at the higher ranks just a tad longer (even if it's just 1 or 2 games) and I hope that it's creating a more friendly community rather than the toxic one it seems to be. 
---
That is actually a great idea. I think that'll make Vigil more worthwhile to run, even not for your team, but you. Imagine another second to Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time, etc. 
---
Freddy Kruger is a master of dreams and nightmares able to warp reality, yet he is in game 
---
I’d assume devour hope at that point tbh I see why
---
Hex: Spawn In The Open Next to a Generator In Front of a Survivor counters nothing.
---
As killer, it's instant queue for me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
But just playing the game isn't toxic. That's silly.
---
Meets an asshole*
---
well okay buddy
---
What I would reccomend is Urban Evasion + Sprint Burst. My favorite combo, personally
---
I've only let one person get hatch without the conditions I mentioned and it's because she genuinely deserved it after carrying her shitty sandbag teammates on her back
---
I like how you recommend Scott’s video on tiles, but then the rest of your post is filled with things he wouldn’t do. 
---
Boil over is still trash, it buys like 2 seconds if you're lucky
---
They will stay in your inventory, on the dev stream I'm pretty sure they are now thinking of just changing event items when the events happens again next year (as in what they do and not the items themselves)
---
They’ll just become unusable after the event ends. Won’t get any bloodpoints from them I’m afraid.
---
I get you. Im running unrelenting, blood warden, remember me, and bitter murmur. As long as you find a good combination of add ons you would be fine like right now Im using my top tier ones like pill bottle and the z block just to waste them before i prestige. Imho dont run hexes, at least not on freddy. Some people may run ruin or noed but ive been getting 4k easily without them, plus theres always the risk factor of it being destroyed early on and even if you do manage to find someone breaking the totem, you still have to wait till their asleep. If you play him right he can be upper tier.
---
It usually happens to me right after I prestige someone and spend points on them before I open the loadout menu, but I've also seen it happen just out of the blue - that always fixes it for me :) 
---
The photo above is actually really weird.. how is that a girly thing?
---
I just came
---
I had a match where 2 people dced after the first person killed themself on their first hook. There were still 5 gens to do and my ruin was still up. I found the last survivor, downed him, and tried to carry him to my totem so he could cleanse it and get the generators done. He kept wiggling off, tbagging, and then trying to loop me around a car. Id catch him, try carry again, obviously walking past hooks, but he'd wiggle off and run back to the same spot. I finally decided to just hook him and he msged me on ps4 telling me i was a noob and i shouldnt play killer. People like that are the reason this game has so much salt
---
ah I see, I'll keep that in mind, thanks!
---
I mean, on the one hand it's shitty to DC and ruin a game.
---
On the other hand, Legion was almost perfectly designed to suck every ounce of fun out of the game for survivors. His skill ceiling is so low you could scrape it off the bottom of your shoe and he has less counterplay than any other killer in the game, including Nurse. He ignores level geometry in a way very similar to Nurse, except unlike Nurse he has full movement control and zero missed swing recovery so you can't even try and juke him. He just turns off all the things survivor do to extend chases or avoid hits and it makes Legion the least interesting killer to play against in the game. Legion's theme song should be "Every Day Is Exactly The Same" by Nine Inch Nails, because if you've played one Legion game you have played every Legion game.
---
tl;dr randoms on the internet don't owe you their time. DBD is supposed to be fun for both sides, even if it is a salty ragey kind of fun as so many games are. Legion isn't fun, so people walk away. That's just how it is. The solution is to make Legion fun. That's on BHVR - not the community.
---
Nea disconnected after getting downed in the first 30 seconds of the game and missing her Decisive Strike, making her tonight's big loser
---
Oh I've done the exact thing
---
&gt;They should just remove the ability to hook in general,I feel. What's the point of a wiggle feature when there's always a hook near where I get downed.
---
This is the biggest lie I often read on reddit.
---
If you play killer you know that in most maps the survivor will hit at least his 6th "grunt" when transporting him to a hook. If someone bodyblocked he would go free.
---
The Game / Meat Plant map often is a nightmare to hook survivors, same for the new map if someone dies on a hook and another survivor is downed by that area, the closest hook will be quite far. 
---
Hook distribution is not as bad as it seems all the time. In some maps hooks are on top of each other, in others you can barely hook survivors. 
---
Very rarely a survivor won't hit his 5th grunt, which means wiggle DS is an option 90% of the time. 
---
Kinda forgot about the range part
---
Maybe just make the duration increase not stack or have an upper limit to how much it can increase a speed boost.
---
That's lame as then aye
---
Did you make sure she was signed in your account because the only thing I see overwritten is rank progress which would usually reset by the end of a match
---
I love getting gen grabs as Piggy
---
I've not seen a single person with plunderers since the buff, except for one person who was running a magpie build and specifically warned us pre-game that they were doing so, allowing me to swap my perk out. So far I've never struggled to find a chest for my pharmacy kit. lmao
---
I forgot about it tbh

[Emblems Explained - "The ELI5 version"](https://redd.it/8bvz68)
---
No no, he stopped __to__ tbag after getting hit
---
You hate urban evaders as a killer? or survivor?
---
If you hate it as another survivor because "I'm too immersed" Id tell you that I use it when I'm near a downed teammate that's about to get hooked In case the killer checks around
---
If you don't like it as a killer then I don't know what to tell you... Its a "horror game" and you're supposed to run/hide from the killer so this slightly helps hiding and I really don't see what the annoying part of it is... First time I hear someone complain about this perk
---
With an escalator for the killer that goes on reverse as soon as thy reach the top, like Tom and jerry heaven.
---
I know right, now when i play killer I can hear the closet so distinctly now out of all the other noises.
---
Holy shit what a throwback 
---
This wouldn’t lead to perk variety at all, it’d just make those abilities EVEN MORE obnoxious than they already are, and more people would use them
---
That was the plan but I forgot :( Thanks anyways! 
---
Well you are right. NOED is for bad killers and DS is for bad survivors at least in my opinion 
---
People are allowed to be bad at certain killers, you know - outside of dailies or the occasional "nope still suck" trial run I haven't touched Billy since I started playing. And man, let me tell you it is embarrassing to be in red ranks blinking/chainsawing/chucking hatchets/whatever like you just opened the game for the first time. *Oof.*
---
Did you hook someone first?
---
I play both around 50% at rank 1 and I hate from both sided for the same reason.
---
Long story short: if you’re good enough as survivor you don’t need it and it only encourages rat playing, poor participation and a giant waste of time.
---
Yup, tried on two seperate xbox's, signing in and out of both accounts. And it seems like my save was completely overwritten by hers. Only difference is I kept all my cosmetics and got none of hers but all my perks/items/addons for every character was replaced by what she has. My shard count didn't change but my blood point count changed to what hers was.
---
&gt; Because running the perk causes the person to guarantee save and protection attempts.
---
If you *need* the incentive of a WGLF token to unhook someone, you're a bad survivor.
---
And yet many people run WGLF *without* borrowed time (or even We'll make it) and "save" the survivor directly in front of the killer.
---
It has no gameplay benefits and its current inclusion causes negative behavior from survivors running it more often than it encourages helping your teammates.
---
Though a friend of mine did bring up a great point. WGLF is the only survivor perk in the game currently that lets you play as a killer.
---
I think the Predator would work quite well. The Alien is a little too animalistic for it to work, and it wouldn't make much sense in a regular horror setting.
---
the hatch closes??
---
I'm not seeing enough movement
---
I love Impractical Jokers so much, I hope the show keeps going forever. 
---
The thing is, I can't imagine what his power and perks would be, I could imagine a great map though tbh. But how on earth would The Predator work do you think?
---
Especially when they dont have ruin! I've had two Michaels do this and both had noed
---
Idk

True and Tyde agree a little on starting survivor. Tyde recommends starting with Meg, Claudette, or David. Meg for Sprint Burst, Claudette for Self-Care, and David for We’re Gonna Live Forever. Meg and Claudette would be easier to learn on since their skills are pretty strong, but David’s WGLF helps reduce the bloodpoint grind a bit. 
---
Play tutorial u will find dwight in locker.
---
Totally agree, the Predator could potentially work, well the Wraith has invisibility already.
---
The Alien not at all.
---
Quentin is practically me in 10 years (minus the methhead look)
---
I had a game yesterday where spies felt like a crutch. It was kind of laggy so I had a hard time keeping chase, but spies would keep helping me get back on track. 
---
I love this for the simple fact it's one of the first three Total Drama seasons
