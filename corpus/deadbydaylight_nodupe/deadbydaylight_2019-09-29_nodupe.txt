Well yeah the fact you can‚Äôt see it is the issue lol. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they release him soon(ish)

I think you are talking about Mac milian estate

Apparently you did all this today
---
The feeling of a 4K after not even landing a hit until the last gen is the best feeling
---
Lol I meant on the games end
---
Also to add he was running ruin, surge, remember me, and fired up
---
Apologies if I sound rude while talking about you. I simply shared my perspective and hearing yours helps me understand more.
---
While I agree with your sentiment, the counter to Ruin is Stake Out.
---
Wait they were actually interested? I have videos
---
Steams up now
---
So is your mom
---
what's sandbagging?

---
i downloaded last week please forgive my ignorance.
---
Survivors have keys though which are equally cheese.  You willing to remove keys from the game if it meant ebony's would be gone too?
---
I mean, you were camping though right? I'm not saying you did anything wrong necessarily to try and secure a kill, but for somebody who says they followed every rule, it sounds like you broke the biggest one of all.
---
Also you need to turn off chat if you can't handle it, I'm not saying this as an insult but you seem pretty thin skinned.
---
OP commented that the Bill actually did have the timer glitch. Looks like killers can see what the real time is but survivors don‚Äôt always
---
Great Value Lament Configuration
---
As a killer main, what is the point of closings hatches? For any competent survivor it just becomes a free escape.
---
Poor Bill :(
---
The Entity was displeased because you failed to save him (Even tho he prob had the timer glitch)
---
Think you were the only one who actually understood the question lol
---
I completely understand your frustration. Because he didn't want to kill me I assumed he would treat you the same. It was when I kept dodging his attacks and then he just kept staring at me that I thought he decided he would be nice and want to farm
---
They don't need to give you anything. It falls under their rules, just don't be a dick and play the game. It's not hard.
---
Where they least expect. nice

Ohhhh good to know, thanks! I‚Äôm gonna check my switch when I can and see

Hey i am Jeff main, big boy is the best

Um..... 38?
---
I'm a Claudette but I'm the type to be seen :)
---
Colored? It‚Äôs just black.
---
How do the obsession perks work? I couldn't understand them. How do I know which survivor I'm obsessed with?
---
I always feel like a POS teammate when someone is getting hooked or needs a body block at the end .... and Rancor is on me. Sorry buddy gotta go :(
---
Keys at least need either most or all of the gens done or multiple survivors dead. Keys are incredibly powerful but nowhere near a Mori imo.
---
Also keys have multiple uses don't take away my shitty meme aura reading keys :(
---
Apparently. The Bill said he saw it still halfway full at least
---
Also would I have to buy the cannibal just to get BBQ and Chili?
---
This happened as well with a 3 man. 2 got into the lobby while the third was waiting in the invitation area. After about 15 seconds he eventually showed up, so i suggest not touching it and hoping they connect.
---
You also miss out on a lot of bloodpoints if you leave early tho
---
Whenever I get salty messages I just start talking to them about random shit like Jesus and the weather  until they realise I just don‚Äôt give a fuck about what they have to whinge about.
---
Was just about to ask the same question.
---
What say you, OP? I'd be down for removing ebonys so long as keys are removed.
---
THE SHADOW!?

Their rule is no griefing but they've given very little to go off to describe what their list of griefing is. If anything they've said more about what isn't griefing.
---
Such as saying facecamping isbt griefing.
---
I think it's interesting that you're so offended at the prospect of wanting to be kept in the loop as to what the actual rules are.
---
that's why i exclusively play billy with speed limiter
---
Yikes short game. Sorry man

I think you need video proof. Idk for sure tho
---
I know, and its good. But my point isn‚Äôt less true anyway.
---
üå≥=bush=Claudette's natural habitat.
---
1. Whether or not they currently exist is completely and utterly irrelevant. Making things work differently than they used to is the entire *point* of changes.
---
2. Why wouldn't they? They just decided to let Freddy ignore Borrowed Time last patch, and this change makes infinitely more sense than that.
---
3. No, no he isn't. That's a big part of why he's such a low tier killer. Once the pallet is dropped, Clown has to break it.
---
Rank is based on emblems which all have different requirements suhc as doing gens, winning chases etc. Don't do well enough in these emblems and you'll depip and eventually rank down. You can gain up to 2 pips per game depending on how well you do in relation to said emblems
---
What is the red thing in the picture? I'm guessing that's what you're talking about. Lol I tried playing killer yesterday for the 2nd time and got in a chase, not 3 seconds later the guy disconnected. Didn't even get to him. Lol
---
Maybe he thought I had that red thing on or something.
---
Insta heals can be outplayed easily.  Entire killers deny them from even functioning at all such as Plague and Legion.  They are irritating but nowhere near as powerful as keys.  It only takes 3 gens to get 2 people out with a key.  Ad a killer you could have them hopelessly outplayed with a 3 or even 4 gen situation they have no chance of getting out of but then well here's my free escape...When you get to red ranks swf groups start playing them constantly.  I can see them in as much ad 30-40% of my games sometimes often last second switched to lol.
---
What the fuck, God why does that exist, oh know I'm gonna have to an alcoholic to wipe that from my brain
---
Keep it a hex perk but make its effect transfer to another dull totem after its been cleansed. Make the time between reactivation 120/100/80 seconds. If there are no dull totems left, Ruin is gone. 
---
Make it a perk that only effects 3/4/5 generators on the map. The survivors have to pick wether or not to start on them early game or have one of their final gens be a Ruin gen. 
---
Make it effect every gen on the map but only for the second half of the generator.
---
[explanation on the ranking system from the wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems)
---
TLDR: you need a certain number of points in Gen Repair, Chase, Survival and Altruism to either maintain your rank or move up in ranks. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to survive.
---
Everyone is talking about blood points and I'm just sitting here trying to figure out why I don't get XP for every game I play. It's annoying because I'm trying to earn iridescent shards.
---
The grind is real so having a main you really like can help you ‚Äúcare‚Äù more if that makes sense. Kate, specifically, has OK perks but the only one I really use is Dance With Me, and that‚Äôs just when I feel like it. WoO is nice for learning new maps though. 
---
The shrine is nice if you know you‚Äôre not gonna buy everyone and level them but of course, you have no control over what shows up too. Not sure what level you are but it won‚Äôt be long before you‚Äôre reeling in shards pretty quickly. I say go for Kate if you like her look and have the shards now. Saving up for 2k shards is a lot quicker than 9k anyway and you can start leveling her right away. The nice part is once you have all your unlocked perks on her, it‚Äôll get easier to get what you want later. My mains are Feng/Nea and they have all perks. I always keep their bloodwebs complete at 95% so when I get a new perk unlocked, I am guaranteed to get it on their next bloodwebs without it costing an arm and leg in BP.
---
You can be bad, and still hit purple ranks. I know I was. When you hit red rank 4, you'll stay stuck there or regress back to 5. I was stuck on 4 for weeks with no pips.
---
Love me some sneaky-boi Myers
---
&gt; Their rule is no griefing but they've given very little to go off to describe what their list of griefing is.
---
Here I'll sum it up for you.
---
Anything you are doing to waste peoples time purely to spite them (Aka changes nothing regarding gameplay) is grieifing.
---
Don't play silly, there is no reason to mori spam but to grief.
---
&gt;Such as saying facecamping isbt griefing.
---
Because that is a strategy, A poor one but still a strategy. Spamming mori is not. It's only purpose is to piss people off.
---
&gt;I think it's interesting that you're so offended at the prospect of wanting to be kept in the loop as to what the actual rules are.
---
I'm not offended at all I'm just not an idiot so I don't need to be informed of mori spamming being bannable because I don't do it.
---
Depends what map.
---
Every killer game I‚Äôve played with 2+ party streamers I‚Äôve let people farm. It‚Äôs a rare drop and they‚Äôve spent it on this game, might as well let them enjoy it. And tbh that‚Äôs when the most stupid things happen which make me laugh. There‚Äôs always gonna be another game I can try hard in
---
Plenty of unsafe and mind game able pallets on The Game. It‚Äôs why I hate playing on it as survivor and love it as killer unless I‚Äôm Huntress
---
I see... I am about green rank, so I wouldn't know too much about red ranks besides how hellish it is. 
---
But I think keys have to stay somehow fro aura readings, and maybe allow opening hatches as an addon. Only problem is, what should its base kit do? Green keys are already useless.
---
shut up
---
Hmm yes the day is made out of day.
---
I've barely even seen cakes or gateaus.
---
Idk I know personally I have long queue times as killer so if I wait for 15 minutes to play I want to play not just farm so I‚Äôve been actually playing but I‚Äôll farm if it‚Äôs to easy and the people seem bad
---
3 gens is all it takes to get out 2 people.  You could have them hopelessly outplayed and 4 genned where there isn't a chance you're losing the remaining gens and they get a free cheese escape because they brought an item.  They're every bit as cheesy as ebony moris.  Keys prematurely end games by allowing early escapes in situations where that would be impossible.  Ebony Moris end games by allowing early kills in situations where that would be impossible.  They're two opposing sides of the same crutch.
---
Wow, you just identified yourself as a prick. Congratulations.
---
Yeah once the endgame starts i just go make a sandwich or something as it ticks down
---
I‚Äôd say that against any killer with a decent movement ability  it‚Äôs a guaranteed lost. Especially if the gates are even kind of close together. The killer just has to keep going back and forth and the survivor eventually has to try and pick one cause of the end game collapse. Unless they have a key of course.
---
So everytime I try playing as killer I get full swf squad with toolboxes, instaheals and keys, all of them with personal bp offerings. Not gonna lie, I'm already running out of moris
---
How come I only get the annoying, you‚Äôre gonna die because of this and there‚Äôs nothing you can do, glitches not the fun t posing one
---
Anyone that isn‚Äôt a stranger things noob
---
Its the thought that counts
---
I mean OP is rapidly coming out of debt, so that's good.
---
I'm 99% sure u wont be banned but u can also try binding to scroll down if u dont like smashing your space button
---
You can do a lot of stuff in this game and not get banned because of lack of dedicated servers its honestly suprising
---
this is why I run endfury
---
Right, but what he's responding to is your comment 'only 2 farming games in 30'. As if people are unreasonable for not wanting to farm.
---
Just enjoy the game and play it as intended. Farming is stupid. You don't need to hoard points. 
---
As a survivor, I'd rather they just hook me and get it over with rather than skipping around playing catch me kiss me! I've got better things to do.
---
In the bottom left corner where the survivor names and states are, [there will be ‚Äúbrackets‚Äù around one of the survivors](https://imgur.com/PeJ0dZM), kind of looks like the entity arms. This doesn‚Äôt help unless you know the name and character. 
---
But there is an auditory warning, a sound will play when you get into a chase with your obsession. Take note of the character when you find them to avoid messing up your Play With Your Food.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure he was just making a joke mocking the guy that messaged you...
---
It comes up in the Shrine once in a while, but other than that I‚Äôm pretty sure you need The Cannibal so it‚Äôs teachable.
---
Oh I wasn't even calling for them to be removed.  I was just pointing out that if you have an issue with moris and think they're unfair than objectively we should be willing to admit that keys are pretty cheesy and unfair for killers from our side too.  I totally would be willing to lose both though in the sale of fairness.  I don't have much respect for moris or keys personally.
---
kinky
---
U got killed by a bullshit ass bug
---
What I wanna know is why your crouching over to the exit gate when you dont even hear a heartbeat, like just run bro
---
Matchmaking needs fix. No game that is still highly played by many people has matchmaking that takes more than 1or2 minutes.
---
I mean by your definition using moris in general is already griefing. I could bring moris every game and facecamp the hook with insidious and mori them right off the unhook and nobody can stop me and it's awful for the player wasting an entire match for them. But that isn't bannable. 
---
Most interactions in the game are mini griefs such as tbagging or shaking your head when you down survivors. Crawling to corners to bleed out for 5mins just to deny people points. 2 players hiding waiting for hatch. All of those waste just as much time, are exhausting to experience, and aren't bannable. 
---
I think bhvr needs to draw a specific line and explain what crosses it specifically.
---
[removed]
---
Or get facecamped by a billy for the entire match after bringing bps because reasons.
---
Still happening even after restarting. Every other match.
---
People farming bloodpoints way easier to do as killer
---
Although its not like the killer queue time is that much shorther without the event
---
Xbox
---
 Recently grabbed the last person vaulting as demo
---
I've mostly been playing killer and I've been rotating them out based on whether I have Party Streamers or not. As killer I try to use streamers whenever I can, but I have only seen others use their streamers or gateaus only  a few times.
---
It never shortens, you see it full all the time. Well at least that was my experience the only time I got it.
---
Ok we will get rid of Ebony‚Äôs if you give up keys
---
You could've tried hiding but that's hard because it's Ghostface not much you could've done there
---
Perks can = overpowered killers. Am I wrong?
---
Of course, it would need to be balanced after
---
Name 1 Halloween movie where Michael Myers didn‚Äôt camp; he‚Äôs the goat of camping.
---
&gt; I mean by your definition using moris in general is already griefing.
---
Wrong. Moris eliminate people from the game a hook early, clear gameplay advantage.
---
New ish to the sub, what does swf mean
---
Im going to use "very imbarassing" as my default reply to salt mail.
---
A bug which causes the endgame timer to desynchronize and show you the wrong time I believe
---
They were probably grinding and wanted that extra BP boost. Or not...
---
Wraith is thinking.
---
"You see this shit?"
---
I mean there's no rule against me slugging everyone and letting them bleed out. So why would mori spamming be bannable? See what I mean? There are so many similar examples that aren't ban worthy to my knowledge. So idk why you're so offended at the prospect of learning what is actually against the rules
---
When Jane falls from a window in lampkin lane and lands on your face
---

Survive with friends, it‚Äôs when 2-4 people are in a game chat and playing together. Really big advantage for the survivors and gets joked about here.
---
Thats absurd, after care is already a pretty decent perk.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a solution so far, I‚Äôd just say attempt to leave asap once gates are open
---
contragulation
---
some survivors have very loose definitions of tunneling and camping though. i just got called both. first survivor died after every single survivor got hooked twice and i never camped. i just had surveillance, so i came back to gens when they started repairing them... oh and i also used a party streamer, but nah. survivors absolutely have to be whiny bitches and insult me and call me tunneler/camper
---
i hate bp events.
---
I detect lies
---
Be gone normie
---
That‚Äôs just not you playing him optimally imo. His portals give him MASSIVE map pressure IF you place them right. Placing his portals near gens and hooked survivors gives him ridiculous amount of map pressure and his shred ability makes the killer shack unviable to loop for more than 1/2 times. 
---
Oblivious status affect is great and can get you some easy hits when your portal is near a gen. Also helps that you get killer instinct when a survivor runs near the portal but doesn‚Äôt start destroying it. End game is great if you have portals near the exit gates as well. Only gripe is for sure that you can‚Äôt recycle old portals once you place all 6 down.
---
*im in this video and I don‚Äôt like it*
---
Hopefully when we get the battle pass next, whatever they're calling it I forgot, it'll contain a built in escape cake for every match.
---
Oh yeah? I've just gained my 97463rd youtube follower thanks to your post, soon our forces will combine and I will become unstoppable. The day of your reckoning approaches.

---
Bruh how dumb you gotta be

Yeah that's my main complaint not being able to recycle through portals hurts they should have at least have an add on that gives him the ability
---
Time bug.
---
I'm like this with Ghostface, I always seem to run straight into him before I know who the killer is.
---
I posted on one of your vids before on YouTube and will say it here.
---
Yours are the best break down and tutorial vids for dbd. 
---
Watched everything you posted for dbd so far as it switched me from someone ready to uninstall to a player who is pretty hooked (pun!) And not playing much more than dbd. 
---
Thanks for what you're giving back to the community.
---
HAHA dam I wasn't sure aye cause I sent him the link to this post because he tried arguing that slugging was cheating so I wanted him to see everyone else's opinion lmao
---
Nah should be standard like the hag.
---
I faintly hear the sound of Mario going WA HOO!
---
Calm down kid, it's just a comment.
---
that still doesn't counter it. Ruin entirely removes the benefit of great skill checks and punishes good skill checks. Stake Out doesn't counter that, the only way to remove said debuff is destroying the totem.
---
Ah thanks I thought the brackets meant that a survivor was in the terror radius since I played survivor when I first started.
---
No it‚Äôs 6 smartass
---
What happened to 4?
---
Pretty sure you do.
---
Pretty sure theres gonna be another one on halloween
---
Yeah it's a stupid add on honestly, just as bad as instaheals
---
How about you get to pick killer or survivor or both. Literally what I said.
---
Before you didnt have to wait 10 minutes min for a match as a killer? My experience as killer as a new player is mostly queue times and crashes.
---
Honestly, all of these actually sound good. I would suggest this if I could to forums if I wasn't unfairly banned rn. :/
---
Imagine complaining about people not following made up rules.
---
It doesn't need to be, but it *should*. This isn't a crazy hard change to implement and it would take a below average perk and make it at least above average.

For keys, I saw a suggestion that it can only be used during endgame, which honestly sounds pretty balanced and rewarding. :)
---
For real, im just playing as bubba i dont have time to wait 15 minutes to find a match
---
During egc, I open the gate until the progess bar hits the first E in escape, go behind something, and wait until the killer checks the surroundings. Then by the time they're back, the gates open and I'm running out. But in that situation, you were practically screwed :(
---

Man that's a great joke congratulations its pretty funny because in no way would a mature person think this
---
wait what‚Äôs the first one?
---
So many lockers and you chose this one.
---
Considering his excitement in getting 1 mil BP, and also posting said achievement, I can safely assume he probably believes that this is a difficult thing to do. Im letting him know that there's an easier way to do it, rather than struggling to play a spectacular game as survivor all the while banking 16-24k bp, he can play a poor game and rack the same amount as killer. 
---
So yes, the answer to your question is yes it was necessary.
---
To be honest, I think the mori should not have a charge up time. Just one click and that's it. Maybe make different keybind for it in case you want to smack any lingering survivors nearby.
---
Insta Heals are annoying as shit but not as game ending as a key.  Here's how you outplay instaheals.  Franklin's right off the bat hard counters midchase instadowns.  I use Franklin's anytime I see multiple medkits in lobby.  When you down them you can often pick them up immediately before they can position themselves and hit the prompt to heal their friend.  You could also always swing at their instaheal friend and they'd drop it anyways.  If I really feel like hard countering it being even a possibility I'll just throw my Plague at them sometimes Legion.  Plagues base kit hard counters all insta heals and Legions base kit hard counters Styptics.  It requires a Needle or bust to be able to get through Frenzy.
---
I know they are aware, but it kinda pisses me off that they are not officially and widely letting us know their awareness. Despite the fact that it‚Äôs such a huge issue, they seem to pretend nothing wrong with their game. Wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the latest hot fix post either. Instead they just retweet the fan art (nothing wrong with fan art itself), and advertising the switch version which is apparently broken too.
---
Hex Don‚Äôt touch my bones:

cleansing a totem will instantly kill all survivors
---
If you heal someone that has it, you can see them, they see you they can see all survivors once they've been healed/saved or vise versa. The perk is fine where it is.

Yes they are very active, unlikely to see results from insults as 90% of the community will be banned. But things such as death threats result in a perma ban. So it depends on what they said.

Nah but Ive been on the reddit longer. Its about a repost not the game.
---
You do yeah
---
Myers Tombstone is wasting your time not mine. If you quit you get no BP but I do.
---
I was using it yesterday and kept my stacks. Let me try another match and I'll come back with results.
---
Edit: Just got through a match with STBFL. You keep stacks if you hit them with Shred. As someone else said, you probably have it confused with Play With Your Food, which does lose stacks with Shred.

I think a lot has to do with the recent surge of newer players, on top of them probably getting constant dailies for killers, such as "kill X survivors by your hand".  At that point, they'd probably feel tunneling was their only option

Spine chill is effected by undetectable, when it says it effects auras.

Either the patch notes, dev stream, and every single source of information is wrong, or someone wrote the code wrong or copy and pasted Myers T1 ability without regard for spine chill and premonition.

Ah, you're right. It only increases the chance for bear traps. My bad.
---
that‚Äôs my first time using urban evasion and i think it‚Äôs so cool
---
I usually balls it if it looks like i can make it and take the hit. The sucky part here is that he had NOED. If he didnt you would have made it out. NOED on a killer with an exposed ability is so pointless...
---
Nah it‚Äôs fine
---
Stake Out is kinda risky though, it requires you to be in the terror radius for 15 sec just for 1 token, and even then there are stealth killers or killers with a smaller terror radius that'll just laugh in your face for picking it.
---
I use it sometimes though since I suck with skillchecks
---
thank you
---
Probably lol

I go for characters, I only go for perks if I dont like the character, e.g. ruin for hag is the only one I've bought from shrine. Other than that I've bought 8 characters from shrine and its well worth it

Red ranks on pc takes 3 minutes to find a lobby

 I'm rank 1 and my survival rate is about 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 matches. It sucks and I hate it but the game won't let me leave.
---
*How it feels when you need one more tombstone kill to get the Evil Incarnate achievement and the last remaining survivor disconnects just to be an asshole.*
---
I‚Äôm fine if you don‚Äôt want to farm but lately a lot of killers are tunneling and camping. Makes a boring game, they don‚Äôt leave and other survivors just do gens and leave.

At this point I‚Äôm not sure about DCs as it seems every single killer on PS4 DCs at the end of the game, no matter if they win perfectly or lose badly. The game probably DCed me after a simple Trapper game I did for a ritual. It‚Äôs really weird as you can see the DC happen as soon as the match ends for every match. Like as soon as you enter that post game scene, the game DCs.

Hopefully the devs fix this.

Unless he has the power to morph into survivors worst fears, I don‚Äôt wanna see it

Ok. Think of it this way; if the action (whatever it is) has no game value and the action is used to grief then it should ba bannable. Of the things you listed only teabagging and flashlight clicking fall under "no game value" and can be easliy ignored or punished. The other things you listed are not griefing, while they may be annoying they have their in game value uses. Just use some common sence to figure out what griefing is.
---
This community is honestly the most clueless and self entitled. The norm now is killers DC at the end of the game and lose their bp cause they think they'll keep them
---
Thanks for completely ignoring half of what I wrote :)
---
Yeah sometimes the timer just freezes for me, the best thing to do is leave as soon as possible, they tried to fix the syncing but ended up making it worse
---
I feel like this could be one of the 4 horseman of the apocalypse. I recently saw a meme about this done with myers.
---
So bubba?
---
Goth plague looks like &gt;!Shadow Sae!&lt; from Persona 5
---
Honestly I bet it's real considering how much they've been fucking up with leaking Ghostface, Ash and kinda Steve and Nancy
---
With the current in-game version, if everyone is affected by After-Care, then the perk owner can see everyone and all Survivors affected by After-Care see only see perk owner, **not each other**.
---
This buff idea makes it so that all Survivors affected by After-Care see each other, period.
---
Seriously? You lose all the points you got in a game because someone is mashing their crouch button?
---
That totem spot is actually hella easy to defend if you wanted to. Especially as a high mobility killer.

It doesnt need that buff, like I said. It's fine where it is.

Im a bit torn on what bhvr should do with spirit, I main her with literally everything on her and I want killers like legion and bubba buffed before top tiers nerfed but I gotta admit she isn't fun to play against, is OP, and does eventually need a nerf to a decent degree
---
Yup. And it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Eh I feel it's both them messing up and some marketing like Ghostface was definitely a mess up considering his perks, ability etc weren't done for Ash it's most likely a mess up too but for Steve and Nancy I feel it was marketing
---
Supposedly if you run back in and vault something than try running out again it gets fixed. 
---
But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a guarantee. 
---
The one time I had the bug than tried to leave to vault I got endgamed before I could see if that‚Äôd  fix it
---
I tried doing this during the free weekend, but the killer queues were almost instant. I didn't know whether to be happy or upset.
---
I mean, it obviously wasn't going to hit you. But you gotta appreciate the effort.
---
Half what you wrote was irrelevant. I answered your core misunderstanding of what griefing is in this game. Asking me why the devs wont compile an in depth list of bannable offences is pointless. Asking me why other people commented differently on another thread is pointless. I gave you my reasoning and to me it's pretty sound.
---
Third
---
Pretty big fuckup if true
---
That was kinda risky tho. If Mr Killer had a brain,(or a working set of fucking ears)  you‚Äôd be absolutely cucked
---
Sounds like a missing texture error. Either BHVR fudged up, the game is glitching, or the install didn‚Äôt complete properly. 
---
Try redownloading it.
---
Definitely not just you
---
Red Moris are a relic of an age long passed, when Emblems weren‚Äôt a thing and a 4K was all that mattered, there are a lot of Pre-Emblem relics that need to be changed/yeeted

I feel like Goth Myers would just be The Crow
---
Dude you literally posted a picture of the demogorgon, no duh thats how we see it.
---
It‚Äôs not a perfect perk, true,  but I find myself using it a lot more especially on my non-main survivors. And the killers I find with small terror radiuses don‚Äôt get played much often but that‚Äôs me.
---
Around the same time I was told it wasn't when I sent a report. So see why I'd like them to be more transparent?
---
Check the leaksbydaylight subreddit and check the post on the forums title ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry pennywise won‚Äôt be added‚Äù at the bottom there‚Äôs people talking about how their posts are getting deleted hope this helps
---
Thank you kindly :)
---
It's completely reasonable, because it happens? I've done it without perks and I've seen other players do it.
---
You on the other hand just seem so hard-pressed to believe you could at all be at fault for your own failure in a video game that you have to blame everyone else and call any opportunity to improve yourself 'absurd' and unrealistic... which after talking to you I'm starting to agree with, sadly.
---
you are signing yourself up for it if you type ""ggwp swf" and check every single players friends list in pregame lobbys. Oc there going to mock you

EZ bps lol

I have "help me farm pls" in my name so I get the message across early lol. lots more friendly games since I changed it!

Can I ask why? I see a lot of hate for him but much of it seems exaggerated or just unfounded.

---
What I wrote is relevant to the point I'm making which still eludes you.
---
I don't think games should give out random bans for things they don't state or previously have stated is okay.
---
I also don't find it to be too rediculous for them to make a list of bannable offenses. They're a company. They could do it in an hour.
---
You however have decided that the point of my post was WHY CAN'T I MORI SPAM ANYMORE, which is why you're wrong. You only want to argue with things that you actually feel knowledgeable enough to argue about which is in fact, none of what this post is about :)
---
True I thought about that as well
---
That‚Äôs petty whiney but you do you man
---
I'm at 900 hours and barely ever quit .. I was outranked and outequipped.  I had no anti-genrush perks with legion and they had urban evasion or some shit because half of their auras never showed. It's not excuses. It's being completely outmatched. If this were csgo and I lost that's one thing, that's a game solely reliant on skill, but this game has factors to it. You can't deny that
---
Really? When the killer closes the hatch I'm not running Wake up I lose everytime.
---
They seem to be off-and-on for me! Sometimes super quick, other times they seem to drag.
---
Dirge x doctor lol forget worldwide doctor this is UNIVERSAL DOCTOR
---
There is def a reason. I used to know him, i was actually a admin in his discord around a year ago. Eli AKA Ussylis is a garbage human being. he is a hypocrite, egotistic, and manipulative.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought until I seen his name ü§îüòÇüòÇ
---
Repost ;( still good though
---
So you‚Äôre gonna be able to call me toxic because my baby nephew turned off my Xbox unknowingly?
---
I mean checking helps me know what to bring, for example ill bring madgrit if at least 3 of them are friends. Is that at least rational?
---
[Watermarks are pointless.](https://i.imgur.com/bsZNzAJ.jpg)
---
Nobody uses it because you lose your buffs. If they weren't lost or, you only lost one aura. It'd be better. It wpuldnt be as frustrating because at the start of the match and the majority of it, you see no one. It's a situational perk that is outshined by far better perks. Even with the buff you want, I still dont think people would use it that often. Theres just too many high tier perks.
---

[Watermarks are pointless.](https://i.imgur.com/fQnjbnr.jpg)
---
They could have all escaped if he just worked on a gen instead of hatch camping!
---
Double BP event means everyone is playing killer since they usually get more BPs
---
[Watermarks are pointless.](https://i.imgur.com/XZFmngi.jpg)
---
Wondered the same thing, either too many killers not enough survivors in que or the servers suck
---
Rightfully so tbh, Especially since most swf are at a disadvantage as they tend to want to save their friends immediately rather than a random who would stay on the gen for a bit
---
I wouldn't bring mad grit, but just say gg and move on
---
Wait theres a bloodpoints event?
---
I don't know him personally but I don't know if that's fair from what I do know. He might not be a perfect person (I mean, who is) but I don't think that's an entirely fair assessment of him. From what I know, he struggles with mental health issues which leads to him doing things he shouldn't do and alienating people (he's admitted as much on Twitter).
---
Either way, his videos tend to be entertaining and pretty good, so that's why I shared.
---
y e s
---
My flair makes me anxious
---
You just told me After-Care is fine, now you're saying it's underpowered like I've been saying. You aren't making any sense.
---
Read the games EULA i posted for you. Technically you should have already read it. It has all the answers you need.
---
Doesn't look like it can be opened
---
Thank you!
---
I've just been crowded and blocked from hooks a few too many times , I don't know of any other alternative other then slugging . But you're right , I shouldn't address it
---
It might occur differently for other people, but here's an example from one of my games earlier today:
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/fitn3rd/video/79681862
---
Say it louder for the people in the back!
---
Pretty sure that's everyone of my matches I'll be the last survivor with someone and they'll get downed and then slugged until I just let them bleed out
---
I expect nothing less from a ghostface main.
---
what do you mean by 4k? I'm new to the game
---
Mostly the first one, on mid rank levels, killers have more control of the match (and you don‚Äôt get facecamped).
---
I didnt say it was underpowered. I suggested a different buff if it were to get a change. It gets outshined by better perks is what I was getting at. It just isnt worth using even with the buff you want. Bond + open handed us far better imo.
---
it makes me more anxious
---
Killing every survivor.
---
He's regular size
---
honestly why not just have it as default. The grind is so tough for new players for no real good reason
---
Nobody‚Äôs ever respected my 4%. I will be shocked if I ever see the day
---
Also the SWF post game complaining that you "camped on hooks" because they made their presence around it obvious
---
that seems overly complicated for a Hex totem, it's also like people forget other Hexes exist when talking about Ruin.
---
Same here. It takes at least 5 min for me.
---
They dont even need aura perks because they can communicate with each other on where the killer is. If they disadvantage themself with altruism that's a player mistake not a swf mistake.
---
That's when you unhook someone when the killer is really close, or while the killer is actively chasing them It encourages the killer to just smack them again wasting a hook state.
---
This comment actually made me laugh, lol. You right. Ghostface mains are petty.
---
Yeah this is better than being right next to a gen and pallet.
---
Pretty much the only actual statement towards in game behavior is one line that says not to harass people. Which in itself is the entire problem and the entire point of what I'm saying.
---
Which to remind you, because you forget somehow after every single comment I say, is that I don't think it's okay for behavior to change their stances on what is and isn't griefing on case by case bases. I want them to solidify in writing what the actual rules of the game are.
---
I don't need to catch a ban in 6 months because they decide that tbagging is now bannable. Or waiting at the exit gate is bannable.
---
Make sense. Infectious fright allows you to easily find more people especially those that feel like using the flicky flicky. Surge however I don't properly know how to use this besides just Downing people in their generators which is basically all you really need to do. Surveillance is probably very good on him along with other stuff Killers because just when you leave there dumbass feels like getting back on the generator
---
Do you loop?
---
did you actually read the post...?
---
Thanks! Now I know what to scream while it's happening
---
[Joke]&lt;---------------------------------[You]
---
Ha
---
Any killer you have bbq on
---
I don't have an issue with you watching his content, and trust me I know more then anyone about his mental health. But that doesn't excuse his behavior towards me and many others in the past.
---
No one is perfect, but some people are much closer to perfect then he is. 
---
But I legit cant pass up the genuine sadness he brought to me as a role model and friend.
---
Once again I don't mind you watching his content, his videos are actually p decent from what I have heard. But I want to make sure you don't blindly follow him. 
---
Remember this, Eli and Ussylis are 2 separate people.
---
I'd be happy to give up keys, they're just as bad as a mori
---
Swf doesn't prevent self care and MORE often than not you catch them by surprise because one friend says they're being chased and doesn't mention how the killer stopped chasing them 15 minutes ago. I play with friends because i find the game better with friends and we do this shit all the time lol
---
Look at it like AUTODIDACT When you get 5 tokens, it's the greatest perk ever. If you can't get any, it's shit. Same with aftercare. If you cant get heals or unhooks, its just not useful.
---
It's not that it doesnt exist, but 80% of survivors are toxic unironically and I really havent seen too much killer toxicity. I don't play survivor all the time, but I play enough where there is no way it is in proportion to what survivors do.  I think it happens because they have a group behind them and feel empowered to do it while the killer is only one person.
---
Did you even read what I just said? You're LITERALY making excuses.
---
Do you know what you do when you're outranked and outskilled?
---
..ACCEPT THE LOSS and MOVE ON.
---
It's not rocket science lol
---
I can dig it, nothing wrong with friends and gaming
---
Just remember that toxicity rarely achieves anything, except maybe to make someone new quit the game so be gentle :)
---
So truuuee
---
you grow up
---
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
---
got ya cheers.
---
I play about 50/50 and it's proportional. Ask any face camping Bubba. Or killers who mori spam. Or hold the game hostage. Shall I go on?
---
Ghost faces last night (australia) were really mean :( and one tunneling fredward.
---
The spelling
---
The lack of spacing
---
The grammar
---
The run on sentences
---
All above
---
Make me angry
---
safe pallets are supposed to be safe, yes clown is a bad killer but clown at least can ignore the initial looping and forces survivors to drop pallets early
---
clown can also end unsafe pallets faster than most killers just by throwing a bottle to one side of the pallet and then looping
---
clown can mind game just as well as all those other m1 killers at tall wall pallets too just moonwalk
---
clown is one of the most unfun killers in the game to go against in the game because he forces you to drop pallets so early so you want him to not only make you drop pallets early but make those same pallets unsafe? what's the survivor counterplay to it, run around throwing down every single pallet instantly?
---
Tried playing as killer today and had to wait 10 mins, whats the reason behind this? Everyone wanna killer?
---
the K meaning kills not thousands, i feel stupid now
---
On all my survivor games the timer was glitched, but none of my killer games had it
---
Grammar much jesus christ
---
No i can‚Äôt  get it to work. wouldn‚Äôt even try til the next update.
---
If you‚Äôre able to get some good hidden portals down near the gens but out of sight, you can usually teleport to them and they won‚Äôt see you until it‚Äôs too late. That element of surprise can be beastly on him. I‚Äôve gotten 2 and even 3 downs this way fairly often. 
---
Once Bloodhunt ends though, I‚Äôll start hooking them all. It just feels cruel right now so I often let them heal up and try again. XD
---
Realatible
---
I can hear this image
---
Anybody got a name? For the sake of science and dbd
---
if you can't comment nice things at all k jk just please stop calling out my spelling i don't give a fuck
---
That could be really cool actually if it like grabbed them like a trapper trap but not injuring them but like it‚Äôs a higher rate of escape and you can‚Äôt grab people out of it
---
You're one of the teletubbies though so like *yikes*
---
I know that these stories exist every weekend, but this was the weekend of Twitchcon. It's been a constant conversation I've had this weekend when I find out I'm talking to another DBD player/streamer.

Hey guy. So I am Bill from your match. I‚Äôm sad to say the timer was at full bar and I just thought you were being an ass trying to take away my totem points. Feelsbadman. Thank you for farming and maybe we can play together sometime :) just dm me
---
I will when the tiny heartbeat i hear leaves
---
Yea I literally uninstalled untill next update
---
They can just some require more effort I did it with pre-work Freddy constantly. The only killer I constantly struggle with in tbh any rank is wraith
---
That's just Nea breathing

I was expecting downvotes and angered ghostface mains but I guess this downvote farming account can go fuck itself.
---
Your focusing on the wrong thing here buddy
---
This is why I pack Deliverance and DS
---
Is this twitter?
---
Each one is supposed to show up at 30, 35 and 40. They stay in the bloodweb until you get them. Probably a bug, I'd contact support.

I'm sorry I just really love the good boy :[

---
I opened the image and Satan unfolded before my eyes.
---
why would you say gg swf just sounds like you are salty just say gg that is all that's needed
---
This is probably the best meme format for that particular situation
---
&gt;shrine is nice if you know you‚Äôre not gonna buy everyone and level them but of course, you have no control over what shows up too. Not sure what level you are but it won‚Äôt be long before you‚Äôre reeling in shards pretty quickly. I say go for Kate if you like her look and have the shards now.
---
Thanks. So you are saying I shouldn't try to save up for her if I only have 2.1k shards atm? I think her cosmetics are pretty cool so thats why I kinda just want the survivor.
---
I primarially main Bill, Steve, and soon maybe Kate. I just didn't know if it was worth grinding for her. I am Player Level 69, so I get 300 per level until level 100.
---
TL;DR - I like Kates cosmetics so maybe I might buy auric cells later in the future for her cosmetics, but I am not sure If I should try to get her or just wait for like deliverance or BL to appear in the shrine.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the same thing that happened to me, was frustrating to say the least.
---
this game has a lot of bullshit glitches for killer and survivor honestly
---
And you don't see a problem with that?
---
I dont think its anybody but the killers right to dictate how they play. Just because it doesnt make sense to you or you would have fun a different way doesn't mean somebody else wants the same thing. Long queue times are annoying, but that doesnt mean I'm gonna drag a game out longer if the survivors can't get anything done. I'd rather just work on moving on to the next game where I'm actually challenged.
---
‚ÄúHey can you don‚Äôt ‚Äú
---
If you drag the game out to 30+ minutes, you're holding the game hostage with your clownery. idgaf if you're doing so to get a 4k or to escape
---
I was the wraith, and I was laughing my ass off
---
I wish I could get competent survivors. They‚Äôre all potatoes
---
I‚Äôve been seeing a ton of Ghostfaces lately, weirdly enough.
---
It‚Äôs an ebony memento mori, it allows the killer to  F U C K I N G  M U R D E R any survivors they‚Äôve hooked during the trial.
---
I wouldn't let it go that long, I'd just let myself die and move on. That's on both sides if it lasts that long.
---
hold up
---
It's a bug
---
That actually scared me though lol
---
But us doing that to toxic survivors make us as bad as them?
---
Every game for me. I just started and had a hillbilly run right at me... Just as I got movement
---
ok
---
That wasn't what I meant. I was asking if it was more beneficial if I am Player level 69 that if I should wait for 7k more shards than to just buy other perks in shrine.
---
I believe I get 300 shards per level. I like Kates cosmetics so maybe I might buy auric cells later in the future for her cosmetics, but I am not sure If I should try to get her or just wait for like deliverance or BL to appear in the shrine.
---
Australia? Oh my god he must've been walking on the roof.
---
Nice
---
It often goes either really well or really horrible. Had two matches yesterday where the spawn was amazing and far from gems and lasted most of the match, followed by a grim water match where it literally spawned directly across from a gen in the middle of the map. I saw the spawn from my starting spot and said ‚Äúwell RIP Ruin.‚Äù Lasted less than one minute. But as I said, I think it equaled our overall in my matches yesterday.
---
no its not anything weird, i just cant send pictures through reddit, You def dont have 2 but i thought you where curious
---
I had a timer that showed 50% remaining kill me today. It's definitely an issue.
---
Depends on the map and totem placement
---
No. Every EULA in all games reads the same way. The company has full rights. What it all comes down to is; Dont be a dick and you dont have the chance to be banned.
---
&gt;if the survivor wasn't able to heal and hide properly during the time the killer was chasing and hooking someone else in that scenario, that's on them. That isn't tunneling and the killer doesn't deserve to get punished for it.
---
you can imagine how i felt at 4 am
---
sent
---
I had nearly the exact same spawn yesterday
---
thats true.
---
So getting characters is more worth than just waiting for like BL or Deliverance in the shrine?
---
Is it usually paired with Bloodhound?
---
Guys, I never said anything about doing it against toxic survivors. Like if they were assholes to you the whole game, go for it. If you wanna be a bigger person and not BM them back, go for it. But I‚Äôm an asshole.
---
Ghostface is fun asf fot the killer and literally terrifying for the survivors.

If you are comfortable with the idea of being banned for anything at any time that's fine. But that leaves us no basis to discuss. So if that's your stance we have nothing further to debate.

I think people actually deserve rights.
---
Respect the drift Karen
---
I‚Äôd rather not have the extra BPS. Just kill me instead of giving me false hope.
---
Happens to me every day since they give me the same three every day so I delete one, get the other, and then once I play a round I get a third one. I‚Äôm really sick of wasting my time on a ritual that isn‚Äôt active or it literally not count certain actions I do
---
Yeah a lot better imo, as if you play a lot you may eventually get all character and shrine of secrets is a waste then. Plus I would only get perks if they‚Äôre are like proper needed. E.g my situation with ruin, had to get it.
---
I‚Äôve gotten the pig nurse or hag every day for almost two weeks. And I‚Äôm never playing them again. I‚Äôm so sick of doing the same shit every day
---
WHY DO A DOG IS A FLOWER?
---
If only it was haunted grounds. Then your set for success.

Cause you dont walk when she phases? After that its a guessing game. Dont go for the predictable path. but yeah she sucks d its all we can do

yes
---
Afk gens?
---
I like to play claudette and I am always trying to heal people and  work on generators.
---
We been knew
---
When survivors leave instead of lingering. &lt;3&lt;3
---
The hatch has always opened with no gens when there's only one person left, it can be seen during normal gameplay once you've done a couple of gens
---
No. I rarely see Bloodhound.
---
It‚Äôs still going to slow the match some, which is the point. It may not be as effective but it still puts pressure on the skill checks, and slow the overall progress. On the flip side, if you can get an extra 3-4 mins slowdown overall as a killer, it can mean tiering up as Meyers, stalking up as Ghostface, placing traps as hag or trapper, etc., which may turn the tide of the match overall.
---
Just my 2 cents
---
Well excuuuuuse me, princess. It's almost like gens are important.
---
It's so stupid when people blame killers for sweating, when if they play chill against survivors with equal skill they get destroyed, bc making mistakes on killers is unforgivable.
---
Give Jane booty shorts
---
161k as survivor with cakes + 4 stacks of WGLF 
---
218k as killer (legion. 4 stacks BBQ. Lots of BPS)
---
Both were legit matches.
---
Is legion a good killer? I just got dbd and my one friend tells me he/she is bad but I see them all the time.

Oh

---
The video promo for the next killer is probably finished (all the material is made in advance), so it's entirely possible someone hit the wrong button and launched it prematurely for a few seconds before they took it back down.
---
You don‚Äôt need to be sorry about that. Any half decent Killer is not just going to let a survivor blind them. This was a utter disaster because these survivors continued to make bad and stupid moves. A killer is not obligated to basically play badly cause survivors think you‚Äôre blind or dumb.
---
It does.

Can someone translate this to English? I genuinely cannot read it with all the spelling errors.

**also I think whoever posted this is too young for DbD as his previous posts have grammar just as bad and make no sense... also he made this on April 2nd this year.**
---
If I want to DC, it's because of a face camp or a true tunnel. If I manage to be unhooked and actually get to DC with a face camp, I wait until it's my third hook anyway. I usually just take the L.
---
your ign i-
---
I just give no hope as a general rule so when I do give someone the hatch or let them escape it is a nice surprise. Otherwise I just try to get the game over with for them and me.

This.
---
Didn't realize it was a gif and got spooked when the eyes moved xD
---
With 3.5 hrs not to mention you might be a purple or red rank lol
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how much slower the game can go sometimes with 5% regression. If you don‚Äôt care about bloodpoints bbq works the same at all tiers. I‚Äôd go ruin but that‚Äôs just me
---
Ok, Thanks

Not if you get a squad who always hit greats or spawn on your damn totem.

Just Over 200k: 5 G√¢teau offerings, and 4 Stacks BBQ. I did 29500 points initially IIRC. It was the blood hunt of the 3 Year anniversary, as killer

Honestly I love your art style! I had saw your comic of you loving to play doctor and really loved it! When I saw your character at the end with doctor in this one I immediately had remembered the other comic
---
Damn, it took you a year to get *one*? I got 4 salt messages within the past 2 days lol
---
[https://imgflip.com/i/3buwrb](https://imgflip.com/i/3buwrb)
---
Yeah i just lost a purple flash light with batteries on the first game with it using the hatch.  Not really mad cuz of the double BP, but im not understanding why im losing it when i escaped?
---
Or they'll just follow you and stalk you with a mori and camp the first hooked survivor
---
That's pretty cool and really fits her, I'd definitely be down for having it used in game
---
I actually want to be able to jump as survivor
---
I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm too nice of a killer or I just suck.
---
I'm newer, may I ask what a tunneler is? This sub scares me because I'm reading about a bunch of stuff that I AM doing and I'm worried I'll get messaged lol.
---
Because most of the time it‚Äôs guys like you who act this way. ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a game, bro LUL ü§™ü§™‚Äù Most of the time if you act like a dick in a video game, you‚Äôre gonna act like a dick in real life.
---
Agreed. I don‚Äôt want stories that have already been told, I want to see some awesome backstories and fun ORIGINAL killer ideas
---
Finally made an account on this app to have a stab.. 117. üßê
---
If I'm in the EGC and I don't find the hatch within one minute, I know the killer is about to find it.  So I just head over to one of the exit gates and wait for the killer to find the hatch.  The second the hatch closes, I start opening the gate.  Decent chance of escaping.
---
Cool
---
This is a bullshit poll without the wraith elephant noise
---
Either joking or new player
---
That is golden.
---
Its tunnel visioning, going after only 1 survivor till you kill them, if you need anything else come to me
---
Very cool.
---
I‚Äôd go for bbq, but that‚Äôs only because I want more bloodpoints
---
Pc players have hope for this, via mods I‚Äôm assuming?
---
Also, holy fuck. This brings me back to my past where I would watch horrific videos where people had comment parties to calm themselves down as a sort of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not alone, we‚Äôre all here‚Äù party. (I was 12, and the cliche kind of 12... luckily I‚Äôve changed to the point you wouldn‚Äôt expect me to be that little shit anymore.)

Hand is a bit too large, face seems pointy/bashed in. I'd try to fix that. Otherwise I dig it!

Maybe it has something to do with rank? When I was in the lower ranks I rarely got salt but since I reached purple/red ranks I get salt pretty often. I feel like the survivors in the higher ranks have huge egos and can‚Äôt handle losing.
---
He literally just said no
---
Pretty much what u/doggo_tacos said. Some people like to complain about tunneling if you go after them once you injure them. I just follow the trail.
---
He's got that gamer neck.
---
it's getting really infuriating, 3 games alone today more than one person has died to the timer going down and none of us had a clue why the fuck we lost
---
That‚Äôs probably it. I‚Äôm not a frequent player so I‚Äôm fairly low rank.

I agree with this

Glad you enjoyed it ! If you got a suggestion for what should come next let me know  !

---
A tunneler is a toxic term thrown around when a survivor is downed multiple times repeatedly, this is often used to justify the survivor running into the killer again or failing to escape the killer. While it is in my opinions n a distasteful practice, I typically leave a survivor who just got off the hook on the ground if I fail to realize it‚Äôs the same survivor before downing them (unless they‚Äôre toxic in which they‚Äôre getting 3 back to back hooks)
---
We had one who hid in a closet with 99% of the last gen done
---
For clarification: 
---
If trap is put on BEFORE last gen is done, you have to remove it before running out. 
---
But if it‚Äôs AFTER last gen is done, you can just walk out.

What would Arnold/Terminator's power even be?

It‚Äôs easier thinking of an ability and powers, then the killer. As it‚Äôs very hard to think based on a backstory.
---
Calm down, kid, it‚Äôs just a reply.
---
All according to plan
---
Y tho?
---
Being a dick in a video game with fake characters isn‚Äôt the same as being a duck IRL but you tried. A for effort
---
Monitor and abuse and whatever else you want really
---
 Unrelenting helps if you miss a stab
---
you got 20k and escaped? what do you mean nowhere near
---
Get rid of unrelenting and replace it with something to slow the game down or track survivors. Also overcharge can be good but survivors who are pretty experienced will be able to land the skill check
---
I look at event offering and items. If there's more than 1 toolbox I tryhard. If there's a scoops Steve I tryhard cuz they're toxic as fuck and like to pretend they're not cuz "lul scoops ahoy I'm so silly" but all that goes out the window if there's BPS. I play GF so I can teabag really fast and people can tell I'm trying to farm.
---
Not sure how it's relevant to OP, but yes, it can. At the same time, certain perks can absolutely screw over certain killers and can make survivors OP in their own right.
---
BHVR seems to balance around the mindset of "If everything is OP, then nothing is." Obviously, not every perk is OP, but there's enough on both sides that if your goal is to escape or 4k, you can do it unless the skill gap is incredibly against you
---
Freddys pretty busted right now so dont worry
---
Definitely haven‚Äôt had a game against me then     
---
:( Feelsbadman
---
Well I ether can go ruin or corrupt intervention which one would be the better choice?
---
Wraith's normal ass hand scared the shit outta me
---
What the fuck kind of logic is this? He‚Äôs saying he wants to actually play the game because he enjoys it, and farming is wasting his time because it‚Äôs taking away from time spent actually playing. He doesn‚Äôt GAF about bloodpoints. 
---
I agree with him, farming sucks. I don‚Äôt care if I get BP out of it, it‚Äôs not fun so it‚Äôs not a worthwhile use of my time.
---
Wow, this is really good, dude!! I would kill for Behaviour to use this.
---
Why? You give them the satisfactions of knowing they pissed you off, they win even more in that situation
---
it‚Äôs a term for when a survivor does nothing but generators the entire game, and doesn‚Äôt help teamates
---
As a Ghostface main, imma say I'd swap Unrelenting and Overcharge for Pop Goes the Weasel and either Discordance or Nurse's Calling.
---
Actually that might be a better idea. Something that isn't a gen so hex ruin or corrupt don't affect it, but can't be toolboxed so you know it'll take a certain amount of time and not be done too quick.
---
Literally only hurting yourself at that point. The survivors get full points still. Survivors live for that shit too. Making a killer dc is like a badge of honor to some.
---
Ruin is rng, if it lasts a few min ties it'll be better than corrupt but at the same time it could be gone within the first 30 seconds. Ruin if you're feeling like high risk high reward or corurot just to be safer with a still decent payout
---
Ruin
---
I would LOVE for them to extend it a few days. I've been DCd from matches constantly trying to play with friends. It's been easier trying to solo queue but I dont WANT to solo queue. I've met and BEEN killer helping other farm BP. But, I've had two farm games where RIGHT AT THE END of the match EVERYONE got DCd and we lost it all. So, needless to say I'm getting about the normal amount of BP as I would during normal days of playing strictly because I CANT PLAY!

Hey doofy, Smell my fingers

Oh no. I definitely have been doing this! Thank you so much for taking the time to explain it to me.
---
Also, if you wear the same clothes as another person or people, don't complain about tunneling, and don't do it on purpose unless they were asking for it OR if they know something important like a totem location, also idk who I'm responding to but I'm trying to help the one was new and who asked

A player who uses claudette with her fully prestige outfit and perks to help her remain unnoticed by the killer

I agree with it but i think it can get a little change. The survivors now have to build the generators and the exit gates to escape.

Maybe a shotgun were he has a set amount of rounds, a headshot could instadown, it could be fun if he could blow him and a survivor up.

Don‚Äôt want to miss future chase songs! I love DBD music and listen to all the tracks every once and a while.

I predicted this, when the speechpolice started going apeshit over "toxic words" I knew that the salty sore loser players trying to deflect their anger over being incompetent trash at the person who calls htem incompetent trash would never stop crying. After they banned all the evil words, basic words like "easy" that are impossible to remove get the incompetent sore losers (because never forget this is why you're mad and reporting, not because you're offended) and now that I'm guessing "easy" is considered mouthfoamworthy by all the pathetic pussified generation if noobkids I guess we came to the pathetic world where teabagging triggers people and even worse people have no shame about being triggered by teabagging and openly crying about it like a fucking woman in public. Just like IRL people get triggered way too fucking easily, gayness all around, I wish anyone who cries about teabagging ever actually experiences something remotely uncomfortable in their life so they can put thing in perspective, you pathetic childish crybaby pussies. The end. 
---
PS I'm gonna teabag every game now just so you fucking pussies might man the fuck up one day, it's for your own good if you get teabagged.

I think spirit is pretty unfair. In a situation like this the survivor is screwed. He either a. Stands there and gets hit, b. Runs away and gets hit or c. Run towards me which is how I got him here. Without iron will there's not much you can do against experienced spirits like myself that with fake phase to see where you go to.
---
*screams in gen grab

he really is, they just run ruin/PGTW or both and we barely manage to get 2 gens

Get rid of overcharge and unrelenting.  Discordance/Crows/Nurses for 3rd slot

Bbq and an ultra rare, easy choice
---
Mostly from gens, and atruism, mostly hid from the killer as best i could tho i did get hooked twice, plus it was a tryhard match for me
---
Where's the doctor tho
---
Replace over charge with Discordance and replace unrelenting with Corrupt Intervention
---
I don't think he needs a re work. He is moderately balanced.
---
And the third perk:
---
Clap Dem Cheeks
---
When activated, your clapping cheeks distract the killer from hearing anything else, drawing attention away from vulnerable, less thicc survivors
---
I've probably sank over 2 million blood points to get bbq on my spirit
---
Stop teabagging and leave it‚Äôs not that hard it‚Äôs 2 minutes
---
Because there is so many benefits to DCing
---
Deny killer a stack and points
---
Move on to a game with higher BP potential
---
Possibly cause a DC chain denying the killer further points
---
Possibly make the killer farm with your team making their day better
---
Get a -1 quick and easy
---
It's a really cool mask design but the face of him would have to be messed up a little so he doesn't look too normal since there's a lot of gaps in this mask, either way this mask looks fucking dope

Poor puppy :(

on console so its not even good killers. They just hook ‚Äúpatrol‚Äù aka camp as him because he innately prevents borrowed time

Bruh you were talking about the whole game in your comment, but yes i was lucky at the end

Very nice. I'm procrastinating doing the grindy Michael and Nurse ones myself.

It‚Äôs a meme

Baba yetu, yetu uliye

Oh ok, thanks.

Watched a vid where the last Survivor was downed and on the killer's back. While on the way to hook, the killer noticed the hatch so he dropped the survivor and decided to close the hatch. Then adrenaline activated, killer hit her but surv used dead hard and run straight to the closed hatch. Used the key and escaped.
---
The entitled survivor mains are downvoting you for speaking sense. Can't play the game normally, can we?
---
I love Michael and trapper oh my god
---
Yeah Ghostface is also my favorite but I play him more like wraith and don‚Äôt stalk and it‚Äôs really fun.
---
Well today it took 20 minutes to find a lobby (as killer) just to have 2 games where someone dc'ed ending the game right when we load in

I took a pretty long break from the game and the first killer i face is a myers with moniter and abuse.... i died

how many companies do you know of that will change a game from working with dedicated servers to peer to peer out of their own pocket... does it make them any money? no... so its either peer to peer to begin with like dead by daylight was or they change it and inevitably limit the games life span to that of the company

What I'm personally playing against during blood event just showcases how chickenshit, toxic, and cheap this game can be just so the truly trash can earn tons of blood points by playing BBQ+Ruin+Insidious and camp a hook with Bubba and a chainsaw with fast charge and acceleration...

Seriously last game I played.

I only feel kinda bad because she was probably under the impression I was gonna give her hatch, but really I was just waiting for her friends to bleedout so I could mori her for my daily. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm not broken up about it, but despite the circumstances what I did was still kinda lame.

Always something with this game!!!!
---
She has the most facial rigs I think? Second being doc/clown
---
My man *NEEDED* inner strength to activate

That makes sense, but the incentive I was going for was the decision if the survivors really wanted to suffer some bad effect at the cost of permanently removing a part of The Statics power. But I totally see your point.

what did you edit this in

"MOM! MOM! THEY ARNT PLAYING THE GAME I WANT"  
---
It should be mutually agreed by all players, the killer and survivors that once the game starts, you are committed to playing it through. Both sides can bring strong tools and if you're going to cry and complain because someone brought a shinier toy then you, then you shouldn't play this game.  
---
People need to grow up and deal with the fact that some survivors will bring strong perks and flashlights and some killers will bring Ebony moris and annoying add-ons. Its the nature of the game.  
---
But considering I am reading this off of Reddit I can hardly say I am surprised.
---
I‚Äôm a claud main and I just work on gens, or loop the killer.
---
TBH Deja Vu suffers from the "why not literally anything else?" problem. There's a lot of perks which I'd love to run but others simply do more. But at least Deja Vu doesn't harm you like No Mither or Autodidact, or indirectly harms you like No One Left Behind or Mettle of Man.
---
A lot of streamers use these, if you want them look up @WholeyeetRye on twitter, they are the artist and these are free to use.
---
Yea but they don't get any points because playing survivor normally gives jackshit nothing.
---
That's every game for me until I know who the killer is. Im so stressed for the first few minutes especially if im on Game or Lery' s.

Why does it take so long to load into a game as the killer??

So if we don't complain then that was our blood point event, but if we complain they will extend it?
---
Calm down kid, it‚Äôs just words.

Happy Cake Day
---
Welcome, friend! If you haven't gotten the Halloween or SAW DLC you will definitely love them as well. Spooks guaranteed.
---
I don't think I've seen a memento yet. But you can just one shot them? That seems OP. Lol
---
Only the purest scientific judgement by cumdump dwight chould of cracked this debate.

Take it from someone who has done 30 games without killing any survivor intentionally( they would kill themselves or dc) I would run bbq chili to get the bp bonus stack along with distressing, and two other perks then I would use offerings that awarded bp  then at start of trial hook everyone once for bbq to max out and then run around slugging people Into Injured state and kicking gens pallets and spamming power (doc shock or plague puke) and try to max out as many, deviousness, hunting, brutality points I can get
---
‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to use‚Äù
---
I believe the word is called ‚Äúskill‚Äù.
---
I love this so much.
---
180 :)
---
Usually I get put into lobbies of people with rank 4-10s, maybe it‚Äôs just time/place thing
---
I only managed to get 2 farming games as killer since this friggin started
---
it's end in approximately 29hours from now
---
Because it's annoying and no one likes be corrected for no reason.
---
I honestly don't care either way and would've probably caught it if not for the fact that it was a meme template. But correcting others when they haven't asked is annoying and I wouldn't do it.
---
Lol when I play swf my buddies and I go all across the map and coordinate our gens to spike together lol. Toolbox and gen rush, anyone?
---
The Spirit got outdone XD
---
I fucking hate flashlight clickers
---
Dwight said gay rights
---
Ah, a man of culture I see.
---
Demogorgon on Ps4 is unplayable because they messed up somehow and playing him gives me 2 fps for the entire match.
---
You might be just as bad as him for playing it up
---
Double bloodpoints sounds like it is the best time to get the game, but it brings out the worst of the community, and the game can‚Äôt handle it all. Hope you‚Äôre not turned away from the game.
---
That's amazing, it sounds awesome!
---
Hiding in lockers will hide your aura from Bbq and chili. Distortion (Jeff johanson perk) will also hude your aura from it.
---
Toxcitity in DBD is heavily talked about. Was hoping this would be something positive, but tbh I‚Äôm not surprised. 
---
I turned off messages because this game can be so toxic.
---
Happens to me every time. Not hit all match, 4 gens all done by me, and occasionally I get some help. And then killer prioritizes me because he hasn't hit me for four generators and then the last gen pops as I'm evading killer...and guess what he happens to have. 
---
RIP TO ME
---
It's against rules if you will try to shame someone so this is done to avoid witch hunt. If it just a screenshot or video nobody cares about names of some strangers which they will eventually change in future.
---
Who doesn't?
---
PC
---
Loading into a game as survivor and killer resets the sensitivity value without changing visual settings
---
J. Jonah Jameson‚Äôs laugh is contagious. Every time I hear the laugh I laugh too. The wheeze at the beginning is too funny.
---
&gt;DBD has had issues with infinite loading screens since day 1, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs getting fixed any time soon.
---
Fair point though it happening 3 times in a row is pretty annoying. 
---
&gt;And at least people getting disconnected before the game loads in means that no one loses their stuff
---
Very good point as well.
---
Honestly that's basically it. After I called him out for not making sense he just said "Don't speak 2 me".
---
Fair enough
---
LMAO üòÇ
---
I knew about the locker thing but sometimes there just isn‚Äôt any around but I did not know about the perk, I will have to check it out sometime thank you!
---
I'm not crazy then! I'm on PS4 and ever since the Stranger Things update (or maybe the one before?) the lines in the images of the offerings seem like they blur together.
---
More of a reason to delete crotus asylum from the game files.
---
'Distortion' to help hide your aura, you can hide in a locker or be in heartbeat range when the hook happens. For hex ruin two options 1 push through it and try for the great skill checks or look for the totem and break it which can be easier to find with 'Small Game'
---
This is brilliant! I'm impressed you made a theme for each stage of the chase too. The atmosphere is perfect. What kind of sample packs did you use?
---
Not a fan of long ques tho :/ I just like the get in and play
---
I really love the idea of the 8 pages scattered around the map, just like the source material.
---
Go in reddit while you wait haha
---
they made him an amalgamation of all the unfun elements from different killers. All packed into one.
---
So I'm playing on some outdoor map in SWF. We start next to one of little hills and it has a 3 man gen on it. 3 of us work and the other goes on a lookout. He says it's Michael and were like cool. Few seconds later I ask if he's being chased and he said nah Michael had headed out way. 
---
I move the camera just slightly to the right and Michael is standing directly behind us out of a fucking horror movie. One of the scariest moments I've ever had in dead by daylight. I may have screamed a little bit.
---
It‚Äôs worth it because you get one-thousand blood points for destroying totems.
---
I hate how trappers always swing at people in traps instead of just grabbing them out of them, idk I guess I play too much trapper.
---
How many?
---
90% of the traffic in this sub is probably just people waiting on matches lol     
---
Like I am now
---
I once found one on Badham‚Äôs that was surrounded by the 9ft tall bushes on all sides except for enough room for one survivor to slip in. If I wasn‚Äôt running small game, I would have never found it. It made a really great hiding spot later on, though!
---
Speaking of pallets someone after the game told me that I wasn‚Äôt a good looper for using pallets?? I basically loop until I can‚Äôt anymore because I‚Äôll be caught and head for the next pallet they said my technique is just annoying and I‚Äôll never be any higher rank if I keep that strat. Just wondering if that‚Äôs just a salty killer because I distracted him for a long time or if it has any real meaning. Thank you btw I‚Äôm rank 7 survivor.
---
Wait who?
---
*Laughs in Make Your Choice Hag not needing endgame perks*
---
Stop apologizing for playing the right way
---
*laughs in Tier 3*
---
I dunno the maps well enough, i remember it was blue with trees and there was a central building with a lot of cabinets and a gen. The match basically came down to everyone trying to distract michael while we finished that central gen. Ultimately i got downed, the other dude got hatch and michael let me go.
---
Right we assume it was tbaggjng lmao, it‚Äôs I‚Äôm the only one on the team with borrowed and I went to go save two people and ended up dying body blocking
---
\&gt;farming
---
yuck, i play the game to play the game, not build currency lol
---
I mean with 2+ streamers I'll go for farms after I hook everyone twice because it's nice to do and at that point the game's mostly played out but it's so weird to feel like actually playing the game is "tryharding"
---
I didnt say anything about being banned at any time for any reason, i in fact gave you a pretty straight forward reason. If you show some common sence and respect for other players you wil NEVER be banned. The fact that you think you may be banned for 'unknown' reasons means you know damn well what you are doing; Griefing with malice intent.
---
Yeah wasn‚Äôt tbaggjng lmao
---
I‚Äôm speaking specifically about the double bp weekend. It‚Äôs a game, bro. And I can‚Äôt imagine why you attract toxic survivors haha
---
Lot of new players probably. This is an easy meme to understand and appreciate by all.
---
Your third point happens to me as well. Last survivor killed or escapes get this (or if you all escape together).
---
When you‚Äôre a team player it‚Äôs hard
---
If you can‚Äôt win without Ruin, you‚Äôre just a shitty killer. 
---
How‚Äôs that saying go again?
---
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre nothing without it, you shouldn‚Äôt have it.‚Äù
---
You are both incapable of reading what I have to say, and incapable of writing messages with errors all through out them. You aren't worth debating. Have a nice day and good luck with your education :)
---
Why is your hat on???
---
Nope. It was a two perk huntress
---
Ah not at all! I‚Äôve had it on the PS4 for a while now. I‚Äôm a little addicted lol but I mostly use my switch because I‚Äôm always on the go, so when it came out for the switch I was so excited to take advantage of the 2x BP. Thought it was a good excuse to help me switch over from my PS4 where I have much more unlocked. But I haven‚Äôt had much luck cause I‚Äôm usually a killer main. Thanks for the reassurance though! I tried telling one of my friends that‚Äôs new to the game the same thing.
---
Would be a Nice addition
---
It might be a useless perk because all totems give 1k blood points, even dull ones. Most people, me included, will break them on sight just for the BP
---
Depends on the survivor really.
---
But also *THE ACHIEVEMENT.*
---
I had a game where I was messing around with the survivors as ghostface just tryna jumpscare them (and let em get some good double BP) and get one down or two but not try and kill someone and one survivor told me I need to actually play the game because it‚Äôs no fun if I don‚Äôt kill anyone. TLDR: you can‚Äôt please survivors ever. BACK TO SPIRIT IT IS.
---
Yea the more bloodpoints means more webs you can complete which leads to more offerings and addons. The worst I ever saw it though was during the Christmas event last year when gifts were on the web. I believe I got 37 ebonies on my clown from that event as I was focusing leveling him at the time. Legitimately every web was seemingly 2 moris from gifts and them just showing on the bloodweb normally.
---
I believe it's called the "wee-wee walk."
---
Yeah apparently dbd gonewild exists and I'm upset I clicked on a link and had to see what I saw.
---
^Not ^typing ^in ^the ^link ^to ^the ^subreddit ^for ^readers ^safety
---
You mean the killers who can‚Äôt kill all 4 without it?
---
Actually what comment above explained is farming. I.e. you farm them off hook near killer to gain easy 1000 points while making them easy target to go down again because they are already injured.
---
Sandbagging is when you deliberately get into the way of a survivor who is being chase to block and slow them down so they will get hit.
---
There‚Äôs only one thing the Entity wants on it‚Äôs team and it‚Äôs disgusting
---
Right now, it‚Äôs only if the exit is available, right? This buff would make it active at all times?
---
Why does he sound like Al from Toy Story 2? Hahah
---
One thing has nothing to do with the other.
---
She can have two perks and have one of those being Rancor.
---
Just say "no" if you are sure she wasn't using it. The number of perks she was using is irrelevant.
---
I‚Äôve gotten in the habit of doing a little pre-setup. I place 1 portal close to each exit and don‚Äôt use those until end game so they don‚Äôt get destroyed. If there‚Äôs time I put a 3rd in the basement. Even if I don‚Äôt hook anyone there it‚Äôs usually a spot they‚Äôre not expecting you to appear from. The remaining portals I place near gens and hooks. I also like tops of hills for a nice view. 
---
My favorite add-ons are the ones that shorten his power recovery. Especially end game you can zoom back and forth between exits super fast. 
---
I‚Äôm enjoying him a lot but he definitely takes some practice to get a good feel for him. I think he‚Äôs my favorite killer.
---
Oh yes, the classic online debate finisher; Grammer!! I hope you continue to grief, i hope it results in a ban. You obviously dont know what common sence or respect is. If everyone was respectful of others and the EULA there would be ZERO bans. Its pretty straight forward: DON'T BE A DICK.
---
Here

https://youtu.be/kqn2REu_AuI
---
Sense *
---
Your idea would just reward the immersed players who do nothing but gens and escape while punishing the survivors who can run the killer for a few/all gens but end up getting caught and left on the hook. High ranks would be even more of a joke than what it is right now
---
Right now, Decisive Strike is in the shrine. I‚Äôd spend my shards on that, because it‚Äôs one of the best perks, I‚Äôve heard.
---
Worst horror movie ever.
---
What exactly has he done that makes him a garbage human being?
---
Bought it first few seconds it was out ;)
---
Science is great.
---
reEEEeEeEEeEeEEeeEeEEEeE
---
(I'm joking. My bretheren can be very.... salty, to say the least.)
---
At that point, they were trying to salvage their pride.
---
Must suck to literally be handed the win (for them, everyone else either died or already escaped)
---
Not a whole lot of playstyles for nurse.
---
I played in coal tower, I think, and my ruin spawned in a box corridor next to the groaning tower. It could not be seen from any angle without going through the corridor and around a corner.
---
They cleansed it in less than a minute
---
Ques will be longer if SWF is separated from solo que IMO
---
La Llorona.   (Lah-yo-roh-nah)  translated means the crying woman. 
---
https://allthatsinteresting.com/la-llorona
---
Heres a quick google search. Youtube will have good stuff too. 
---
Basically story goes. She was a woman who drowned her children in a river and now after death she goes around weeping in search of her children.  She will take children.
---
@Wholeyeetrye on twitter
---
Maybe but we don't actually know unless this is tested.
---
I would absolutely love her. No idea how she‚Äôd play but I loved her look in the movie that came out this year
---
The movie ‚Äú curse of the llorona ‚Äú  does not give a great portrayal. It was ok but it was a subpar movie.
---
A H O Y
---
This is really well done. It fits the Spirit perfectly and would definitely make being chased by her even more terrifying.
---
‚ÄúPlay him like wraith‚Äù. You bing bong the song of your people?
---
Scream is awesome! 
---
Ghostface is really fun to play as for me. I‚Äôm Rank 10 right now and I‚Äôm always getting 3k or 4ks. I know it‚Äôll end for me soon.
---
I play a really dumb build (I think it‚Äôs dumb.) 
---
-Thrilling Tremors (To find gens worked on for sneaky grabs).
---
-Rancor (Helps me track when gens get done, and the obvious, mori)
---
-Furtive Chase (The reduced heartbeat Range has helped a few times, but I use this for Rancor)
---
-Whispers (Self explanatory)
---
I know this build will fail soon, but it‚Äôs fun while it lasts.
---
Some people dont need to know how to pallet save.
---
Go cry more :)
---
Or... you could just SWF
---
True.  It makes me look forward to vsing them again to try and beat them/improve, but fuck all the way off if you vault back n forth over pallets to get my attention to tbag me.
---
I remember I got stomped as trapper one game and I just gathered my traps and put them around the hatch, stood on it and spun around in circles, waiting for them to leave.
---
Not 1 minute passes and 2 neas come seek me out and fuck with my traps, so I naturally seat them and go back to my ritual of solemness.
---
These bitches heal up and come right back.  Leave me 'lone, dammit.
---
Ended up getting one near in the one trap I hid in the grass around the hatch, getting a hook out of it.
---
Very next match, I switched to my Freddy and just planned on slugging everybody and fucking off for 4 minutes, but a Feng min who I had a lot of fun chasing made me reconsider fucking up everybody's game because of asshole neas last game.
---
Quick question, what exactly would the pages be cleansed for? If it was to prevent teleportation, then I feel a 2% repair speed decrease might be a bit harsh for survivors. Maybe have it so that cleansing pages doesn‚Äôt negatively effect survivors, but rather prevents teleportation to that page for a short period (like the Demogorgon‚Äôs portals)? Or maybe have the pages be objects you can place on walls, tires, or other structures and then have those act as a sort of trap that causes the static vision?
---
It's always on the games where you are the only one doing the gens aswell
---
It is a shame stealth killers just aren't all that great :(
---
*cries in oink as bottom tier stealth*
---
I really would like to see Slenderman in DBD for nostalgia. I think he fits perfectly gameplay wise too
---
No killer is going to queue up to play against a SWF.  They will never find a game.
---
Wdym. Feng was definitely close enough
---
Pretty much.
---
Not everyone has friends
---
Same, it's almost like one party is trying to kill the other.
---
*Keep it friendly, gang!*
---
Sorry. Didnt know there was a fucking format to your replies.
---
That's... kind of the point.
---
Where would you rather her get the prompt from, she‚Äôs literally at the pallet on trapper‚Äôs ass
---
Both are 50% off on Xbox right now!
---
Why use Distant figure when you can use Enduring.
---
Why is it so hard for people to think before talking? Showing others flaws in their logic and how to build proper arguements is in no way a bad thing.
---
If I ask how big the moon is I don't want to hear about Jupiter's distance to the sun. Staying on topic and keeping things relevant is imperative for proper communication.
---
Right now the answer the other person posted is useless as I have no way of knowing if they are sure about the "nope" or just remembered her having two perks and based their answer on that. Perfect example of irrelevant information messing up the communication.
---
The Clown, 2
---
*finally gets survivor daily*
---
‚ÄúNice! Survivor is my main role!‚Äù
---
*automatically rerolls it into a mori daily*
---
‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck‚Äù
---
I'm gonna put some pallets in your eye
---
Its the middle of the day for me and killer wait times are long atm. This is fun. What started out as a converstion as to why i think you are wrong turned into a good laugh and some more realisation that there are some pretty silly people out there. Insight into the mind of others i guess. I proved with the EULA, its pretty standard stuff all games have in their EULA.
---
Yes happens so much it's incredibly frustrating!
---
üòÇ
---
I would not queue up as a killer for SWF play unless I was doing a Kill your Friends type of game. I would not bother queuing against a bunch of rando SWF group unless I woke up somehow hating myself that day and wanting to get beat up on by strangers on the internet.
---
Halloween, Saw, and Nightmare on Elm Street I believe. I got Halloween for 3.99 so I'm guessing that's the price for all of them
---
Monitor abuse, ruin, onehit perks like haunted/MYC, sloppy butcher
---
There is still a difference but I've had really good survivors I played with while in solo with everyone else being solo.
---
Good game sense and survivors running perks that will actually help them are the ones who will escape. Survivors running Bond and/or Spine and utilizing them properly are the ones who will esccape or play well to get others to the end.
---
It's so sad when the bare minimum a survivor can do is seen as the most honourable standard.
---
I'm just saying, community shouldn't be so starved for positive or hell, even neutral behavior that anything other than tbagging or ggez noob in post chat is seen in such a divine light.
---
Hate were like this
---
While we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs make clowns exhaustion add on NOT yellow please?
---
Smack people to the ground don‚Äôt hook them and chase them around using your power in combo with attack will award good pts as well oh and you can get an easy 500 pts in deviousness for opening the exit gate and triggering end game collapse
---
Also distressing is a general perk so you will be able to unlock it, just a matter of when
---
OP, there is no SWF problem. The change made it so people can't have a level 20 on the team and 3x rank 2's, it doesn't work anymore because killer will also be around rank 2. Also, the data speaks for itself; solo survivors escaped MORE than SWF survivors, this was posted by the devs themselves.
---
There is no SWF problem. It's a matchmaking issue problem. I SWF with 1 person, we're both rank 5 at the moment. We got put into a lobby with a rank 12 and rank 15. Killer was rank 16 and didn't even have all of his perks for his own killer. Matchmaking is completely messed up right now
---
You have to go into the game files and replace the character portraits, so I don't think you can do it on console sorry.
---
Wow its actually sad seeing the amount of comments that say "that's too bad, that's how the game is, just deal with it."
---
They have the entire duration of the Entity's arrival to escape.
---
Killers are supposed to have collision. The way the Trapper was standing outside of the pallet the Feng should not have been able to get around him but she clearly clips through him. The only way she should have been able to drop it was from the other side that was trapped.
---
Skill checks should be reworked to be how ruin is now. Hitting a great skill check does nothing. Hitting a good skill check pauses gen progression for a few seconds and missing one regresses the gen and alerts the killer. Then you can change ruin to make skill checks more frequent while the hex is active.
---
I mean it's subjective, someone could say that you DIDN'T blur in order to incite a witch hunt.  
---
  
---
Also, steam names aren't unique, so it would be pretty bad if some rando with a similar name got harassed by some assholes for literally no reason.
---
The opposite of looking for daddy/mummy is looking for orphan?
---
That's a thing?
---
REPORTED!
---
Everything is a thing these days!
---
Uhm no we literally just have two opinions and neither of arguments involved either of those opinions. There was never even a debate. Just us talking to ourselves.
---
I'm scared hold me.
---
A better use of your game time would be to ignore the tbagging survivors and deny them points or if at the end game collapse, just browse Reddit for 2 minutes.
---
You want to stick it to em? Hurt his pockets or ego.  These types crave attention, so deny it to them.
---
There there, shhhh, it‚Äôs ok
---
So what's the napkin for that XD
---
This seems so simple and logical haha great solution! Hope this idea gets some attention from the devs
---
Part of the reason matchmaking is bad though is because hardly anyone plays. It's just the truth. I mean it's better to have spread ranks than like 15 minute queues
---
You‚Äôre just unlucky.
---
Each trap has only one key
---
You have just lost a few coin tosses in a row
---
The killer can camp both exits most games and closing the hatch doesn't slow them down if they ended up near it. I understand if it was too easy for the last survivor to escape, but they did not make it more difficult, they made it nearly impossible.
---
It is worse than whispers because the 48 meter range means it gives much less useful information. The larger range also means the effect will activate less often.
---
Whispers already allows you to pinpoint a survivors location but noticing when the perk clicks on and off. Two perks would be redundant.
---
Cause killers have more perks that are worth using.
---
*Sighs.... first time
---
[Here's the youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaGzP3Oyt3c)
---
Just go onto [clipconverter.cc](https://clipconverter.cc) and then copypaste the URL in. Then you can download it as an mp4
---
Is that a console Nurse killing you all?
---
Know the feel dude, I'm in red ranks and now my mates wont play with me cause we match against people we stand no chance against. Its so obvious when we play with someone else of my rank (killer or survivor) with hundreds and hundreds of hours of play and loads of technical skill, someone that should be at that rank.
---
Hell no, this is worse for everyone, including the killer
---
It's most likely the reason solo survivors escape more than SWF survivors is because of the stupid bloodpoint system. Survivors don't care about surviving, they just care about bloodpoints/pipping, which is why I think bloodpoints should be completely removed from the game.
---
SWF with discord communication almost always have an advantage because of communication, so it would make sense they're more likely to survive if bloodpoints were to be removed from the game.
---
Arrival was great. Probably Slenderman's last big hurrah. I don't know about the proxy thing though, depending on how they handle it, like if they based it off of Kate from Arrival, they would just feel like a Legion. Would kinda prefer going in as the big bad Slender himself.
---
Been playing for only like 3 days now and I really hope I'm not unintentionally being toxic as survivor or killer. Had a game playing as killer where we all helped max out our BP for the match and that was super fun. Really appreciate the advice for newbies :)
---
I takes FOREVER to get in killer matches and I constantly get disconnected when I‚Äôm trying to join a survivor lobby. An extension would really be nice.
---
Damn lucky you I been facing with a bunch of rank 1-4
---
Actually, it‚Äôs because they have multiple different options and they can choose their perks around the killer they are playing.
---
I still only use two ‚Äúmeta‚Äù perks on my survivor
---
Wtf guys, why you downvoting me? I posted first
---
I been having a lot of problems tried to start matches as Killer. An extra day or two would be really great.
---
If they aren't helping teammates doesn't that mean its a free kill for you?
---
As a survivor main id say cease existence
---
The thing is, they don‚Äôt need to excuse anything. He was probably joking to mine more salt out of you.
---
If this meme is based on your experience, then they surely succeeded
---
It was pretty damn obvious what they meant with that nope.
---
You could do the same with red and green moris by making it so they can only be used on people who have been hooked twice.
---
I could hear the music when I read the last part.

i already had it, just didn't know whether it was worth it or not
---
You're right,no one gives a shit
---
I've gone through killers from 0-50, Prestiged 1, then again to 0-50, while still never seeing BBQ.
---
It's fucked up.
---
At this point, it might as well be the game's only red/ultra rare perk.
---
*cough* 200+ upvotes *cough cough*
---
Dexter Morgan.
---
i look forward to it, those are the best games.
---
This is absolutely amazing! You should keep working on other killer chase music if you haven‚Äôt done so already.
---
This sounds terrible.
---
People acting like servers gonna fix this stuff lol.
---
You need to remove the stick out of your ass.
---
I'm rank 4 and 9/10 games are chill. Occasionally I'll get a group who tbags and tells me to git gud but it's rare. I can get just as many points by not going full sweat mode especially during a bloodhunt. At the end of the day it's just a game that should be fun, and i'm talking to survivors and killers when I say that.
---
So you can 100% swear on your life and soul (if you believe in such a thing) that that person did not mix things up?
---
I sure as bunnies wouldn't, considering they cannot even answer clearly.
---
It‚Äôs the killer whose face actually moves. That would be enough to get to the first place. Other than her we only get an occasional smile from the clown and a ‚ÄúWHA?‚Äù face from freddy when he misses
---
I want that Battle Pass, even with the game being broke AF.
---
This is rare. We see memes on this sub all the time, but actual talent and quality production of stuff like this is amazing to see
---
Wtf
---
1k is for dulls. Hexes give much more
---
You normally play billy you say?
---
I cannot seem to use him as more than a mobile m1 killer, I have him level 20 and may have landed four saws, pls help
---
This is very well done. I wonder what you‚Äôll do next? ‚ÄòCough‚Äô ‚Äòcough‚Äô Ghostface
---
What does being gay have to do with this tf?
---
Was the part about not affecting vault speeds mentioned in patch notes or by a dev?
---
I literally have no reason to disbelieve them nor do you. We both have no vested interest in wether they are telling the truth or wether they may have mixed something up.
---
Like Jesus dude your kind of comment gets called out with variations of nothing ever happens on stories that seem kinda far fetched. But your losin it over a fuckin perk.
---
I really wish that those campfire animations were used in lobbies instead of standing like they do now. It gives everyone some personality.
---
You can buy him for shards so in sense it can be free.
---
So demogorgon with Tier 3 bloodlust?
---
Bruh thaatsss wiickkeeddd
---
And you need to grow up. Gotta love it when showing others how they are wrong or could do things better is seen as stuck up.
---
Play with your food is really fun if you‚Äôre going for grabs, you move so fast they have very little time to react and you don‚Äôt lose stacks if you get a successful grab.
---
Thanks for the explanation man.
---
Yeah the fear of prayer beads is way worse than having them i feel. 
---
I still they need to look over her add ons again and do some shuffling
---
Except the game has been like this since the new chapter came out.
---
I hope they do I missed most of the event widepeepoSad
---
The thing is, most perks are useless on her. The best nurse build seems to be
---
Infectious Fright
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse
---
BBQ
---
A perk of your choice. Either I‚Äôm All Ears, Haunted Ground, Noed, Third Seal, Ruin, Devour Hope, Shadowborn or A Nurse‚Äôs Calling
---
I might‚Äôve missed some
---
Yeah we are the ones that need to grow up. Not the person being called out for having a foul attitude by multiple people.
---
Hell you even immediately downvoted all of my posts lol.
---
Is your internet good? Maybe they have bad lag and that's why they DC. Went into some games where I had green ping and then it started and the killer had really bad ping spike. People DCed.
---
Console nurses aren't bad all of the ones i go against are actually pretty good
---
Looks like you scooped that escape
---
Awesome dude! Fits well and would love to have it in game.
---
F
---
That's her hair when it's on low because the effects quality is 0
---
he was so sweet in post-game chat too omg
---
Whispers is used to pinpoint the survivors‚Äô location, if you use it just to check where survivors aren‚Äôt you‚Äôre an idiot.
---
I just want to add, I have listened to this about 5 times now and I cannot express how much I love this. üòÇ
---
I have reason to disbelieve them because they couldn't keep their arguement together and instead of clarifiying they posted a "smart" comment which they instantly deleted again.
---
Tell me please how I am "losing it". Because I show common courtesy and continue answering to your drivel? In that case I shall henceforth stop.
---
Sadly Switch isn‚Äôt a big multiplayer platform the best player base would most likely be Splatoon 2 due to the wide appeal vs a dark old 4v1 game like DBD. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the games great but it won‚Äôt appeal to the general Switch crowd meaning long load times even though it‚Äôs recently released.
---
BHVR told us that they are ok with it but won‚Äôt help you if EAC bans you
---
EAC told us that they are fine with it as long as it doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay, but won‚Äôt help you if BHVR bans you
---
My IQ is too low for this
---
Nah,just make survivors take off the trap regardless of it's status when the egc starts.
---
That was interesting
---
I use it to estimate their location well enough to find them most of the time.
---
I seriously don't know why the entity keeps suggesting insidious every EVERY BLOODWEB. I'LL TAKE ANYTHING ELSE! JUST NO MORE INSIDEOUS
---
You want pallets and you want pallets, anyone care what I want?
---
Dont give me that, there are forums, party makers, so many ways to meet cool people to play with so totally disagree with you.
---
Pennywise would be a terrible addition to dbd, change my mind
---
Lol
---
‚ÄúSmart comment‚Äù You mean like everything you‚Äôve posted where you try and act smarter than you actually are? You are fast approaching iamverysmart territory. 
---
‚ÄúBecause I show common courtesy and continue answering to your drivel?‚Äù
---
Yeah sure trying to be a smart ass and getting your panties in a bunch over something that doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone and doesn‚Äôt fucking mater at all is common courtesy.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Yes to this. I dont know why they havent done that yet with the way the game is.
---
&gt;Perhaps it could take longer to activate, but grant a brief killer instinct effect like Ghostface's reveal
---
I like this idea. Your totally right with it fitting in more with his theme.
---
&gt;but forcing a survivor withing 5 meters of you to turn around and lose vision is a bit weird.
---
It also disables item usage and throwing down pallets, so I think this is okay, maybe a bit of a range increase would do it better though.
---
&gt;Either it forces them to turn to your direction which is a free hit every time, or it turns their camera which is countered by just looking at you anyway
---
It would turn your camera, like Hag traps. Also, if you're already looking at The Static, it would still activate the static on your screen.
---
&gt;The teleport would be awful as most would take a 16% debuff to cripple the killer immensely, you'd be a 110% killer with no mobility power about 10 seconds into every match.
---
In *theory* the pages would be hidden from view a little bit, and there's still the bonus generator regression. I personally think survivors would be more deterred from it with the possibility of The Static using addons for it. I see your point though and it would be crippling to The Static. I feel like buffing his speed would make him too powerful though. So although this is a great point I don't have any idea on how it'd be fixed.
---
Thanks for your feedback though! I appreciate it.
---
Problem is way more people are playing killer due to the bloodhunt.
---
Game is smooth/efficient/effective when 4 out of 5 players wanna play Survivor and 1 out of 5 want to play Killer. Queue times are low and everyone is happy.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if, right now, the numbers are 50% wanna play Survivor and 50% Killer. With those kinds of numbers....yikes
---
On the other hand, play as a survivor and find mathches quickly....#WGLF
---
It‚Äôs not just you, i sat in queue for 10 minutes before giving up.
---
Wasn‚Äôt getting the points but it seems to be okay now.
---
All these threads and still the same issue
---
its not optimal but im running we're gonna live forver for farming. Im gonna need all the health i can get. I dont  have nancy
---
Make a few of those as your portfolio and start working for BHVR. I need it in the game.
---
You insidious basement bubba werent you.
---
*cough* highest upvoted post today was close to 8k *cough cough*
---
Maybe it'll be haunted ground?
---
Yes ,please, add that to the petition, this sounds like a great idea! I hope they do see it!! I back this idea up 100%!
---
Legion is low b tier at worst or c tier. He still basically keeps everyone injured all game. Freddy isnt much better than him, sure he can teleport but that alone doesnt make him very good
---
I finally found one
---
‚ÄúJust can't what you wrote stand like that since you  are factually wrong.‚Äù
---
Except I‚Äôm not.
---
‚ÄúFor one I did not immediately downvote all your posts. I downvoted the one comment where you were rude for no reason and told me to clear out my arse and not even adding anything useful to the discussion. Exactly what downvotes were made for.
---
‚Äú
---
Your attitude and format bullshit contributed less than me calling you out for your shit attitude.
---
Also no, you proceeded to downvote the others as well.
---
‚ÄúSecond of all statistically speaking people will always be more vocal about dissatisfaction compared to praise. So more people complaining about me instead of backing me up is to be expexted. I still got a few upvotes which means some people agreed.‚Äù
---
Now you‚Äôre trying to find any excuse to ignore the fact that your attitude stinks.
---
‚ÄúThirdly unlike you guys I never showed a "foul attitude", belittling or making fun of others. I kept it factual.‚Äù Yeah no, you really didn‚Äôt. You just tried to act like a smart ass and like your above us plebeians. You are literally in iamverysmart territory.  You could only go deeper in it now by bringing up your IQ.
---
It would be a lot better if there was proximity chat
---
Mods don‚Äôt work this way all parties would need it installed so it would only be heard by the killer themselves unless the devs implemented a system to install it during loading the match.
---
That sounds really fucking good and kind of scary for the first time
---
This is really nice! Planning to make any more? I'd love to hear a ghostface themed one
---
Even when there isn't a bloodhunt it's hard to find a game for me
---
Well like I said it depends on how many people are playing survivor vs killer. This will be different based on time of day, events, platform you're playing on, etc.
---
The balance team takes away the pigs cosmetics
---
Ohh okay that makes a lot of sense. I mean it should be more specific in the description but that explains why I haven‚Äôt gotten the achievement, thanks.
---
When I see someone obviously do this to fuck over someone, I tunnel the shit out of the jerk off
---
PC player here.
---
Played 2 games as Plague today to knock out my daily rituals. **Both times after around 5 mins into the match, all 4 survivors DC'd simultaneously and the match ends**. Ran the perks:
---
* Corrupt Intervention 3
---
* Infectious Fright 2
---
* BBQ &amp; Chili 2
---
* Hex: Ruin 2
---
Add-ons &amp; Offerings:
---
* Olibanum Incense
---
* Prayer Tablet Fragment
---
* Raven Wreath
---
Found survivors in-game. First game ended when I put my first survivor into the dying state, so I initially thought it was a rage-quit.
---
Second game ended after I had hooked my first survivor, and was on my way to a second survivor.
---
No common usernames that I saw between the 2 groups.
---
Issue started today. Played yesterday without such issues. 
---
Seems similar to /u/InfiresFox where the match just ends after 5 minutes or so (Didn't time).
---
No idea what triggers it, but I'm not gonna go gather more data, considering it'll just fuck over people who just wanna get their BP during the event.
---
Hope this helps someone else looking for answers.
---
I've started using Spine Chill. Not only keeps me chill for the first few seconds but in case of stealth killers, the whole game.
---
Mate, this is amazing. Youve made me want something which I didnt even know I wanted lol. They should add this in the game asap
---
I don't even play killer and it bothers me that totems aren't marked for killers to differentiate.
---
Totems will never be fixed because they are always tied to certain props. Post rework Badham maps had totems that were nearly impossible to find at first, now they are just as easy because people started to memorize which props to look for. 
---
They did try to fix totems spawns by pushing them as much as they could inside these props and putting debris in front of them but then again, just look for the main prop and quickly look at the "hidden" totem location. 
---
The alternative to this method would be making it completely random but then totems could spawn right in the middle of nowhere.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs just missing the IQ comment now.
---
&gt;All these threads and still the same issue
---
Devs already acknowledge the issue, how does spamming the same video over and over helps with the situation?
---
They know. They will fix. Soon‚Ñ¢.
---
This is barely legible. No where in this incoherent rambling is there any substance. May god have mercy on your soul.
---
Whats the point of rolling skies if devour hope exists?
---
Cake
---
Thankfully it‚Äôs one of the easier ones. Just try to get the huntress‚Äô down 100 survivors with hatchet throws farther than 24 meters :(
---
Retail workers are the true victim of these weekend events.
---
&gt;Routinely allows perks to break the game for months or years (Mettle of Man, Borrowed Time, Saboteur, Decisive Strike, and Sprint Burst being the worst offenders).
---
TIL Borrowed Time broke / breaks the game.
---
Your killers and survivors are backwards and this is the fastest method.
---
It blows my mind how uncareful people are on sony. That's such an easy ban and people constantly do it then wonder what happened.
---
Whenever I read the title, I for some ducking reason imagined Giorno's theme... And now I'm imagining a dbd JoJo crossover...Lord help me
---
I'm just going off of personal experience. Most of the time he tends to be the toxic one. Don't know why.
---
Like I have said this post is almost entirely personal. I just can't stand him and don't find him fun at all. I quickly lose motivation to finish the match when I find out it's Ghostface. Like how a lot of people used to quit against the old Legion
---
For me it's like, use my BPS, 3 survivors DC the second I find them. I give baby Dwight hatch after letting him farm a bit but still, this is shit is enough to give somebody trust issues.
---
1.5k for lit totems
---
Whoops. Just fixed the backwards thing lol
---
And dang. Was hoping for something faster. Oh well.
---
I had a friendly killer lobby and a minute or so into exit gates open i realized the progress bar wasnt going out AT ALL so i tried to get people to get out with me. I left. They didnt. RIP.
---
&gt;On Bill's release? Absolutely. It was one of the most overpowered perks in the game at the time, only beaten out by Decisive Strike and Sprint Burst.
---
&gt;On release, it could only be used once per trial, but it applied to both the person using it and the person being unhooked.
---
&gt;It meant that if you activated it in the endgame, both of you got out, period. Literally the only way you could die at that stage was via Tombstone or Bear Trap.
---
Yeah, I know how old BT worked. It was a miracle if you managed to save it until doors were opened. During the trial if any point you went for a save, the very minimal TR would proc BT. Unless you didn't rescue anyone the entire match, just waiting for endgame. 
---
Still, to call it broken? The only reliable tool against soft patrolling killers or hardcore campers.
---
I believe the wording is still the issue, because if we don't factor in survivors killing you, then the third statement "If the killer has seen you, what is your chance for escaping" is answered by the first.  
---
According to the second Statement, the chance of you being seen is 20%.   Because this percentage is lower then the chance of you being seen and escaping we can conclude that either A- The first statement refers to your chance of escaping when seen.  or B- The first statement refers to your chance of being seen by any source and escaping (ie, survivors killing you at least 62.5% of the time that you say was wrong).
---
Factoring out B, because you are saying that is a mistake in wording, statement 2 becomes irrelevant and we can safely disregard it as superflous data as its a given in the question.
---
As seen is a given,  effectively this boils down to Statement 1 You have a 30% chance of escaping.  And statement 2 what is your chance of escaping.
---
Omg that‚Äôs sounds great
---
It is kind of new, so not realy know what to expect. But I‚Äôm excited for the additional lore, DBD has a real cool story!
---
If only one person had it? Sure, maybe.
---
That rarely happened, though. It was broken enough that it was used by 2-4 people in most trials.
---
for how long have you been playing this game to be exactly sure what I'm dealing with here? Also, please explain what do you mean by "moderately balanced"?
---
be happy it's not a ghost face peaking his face across the wall or behind u lol
---
Oh let's keep in mind that I am /not/ running deliverance. So yeah, 4% chance to get myself off the hook, if not she probably would have left me there.
---
I'm not super knowledgeable on the addons but the boots that make it easier to turn are a go to for me. I don't care for the addons that make the charge time shorter as there's rarely a moment where I'm trying to quickly go from 0 to 100 charge
---
TIL about the hanky code xD
---
r/shittydarksouls here is the sub now someone go and post it
---
It's all fun and games until Meg gets a killer ability
---
I think there's one that gives bonus range on your saw swing so I'd take that with the boots
---
When you are talking about someone you use "you are", like in "you are a person". The abbreviation of "you are" is "you're".
---
When you are talking about something someone has you use "your", like in "your account".
---
So, no. You don't write "you're account".
---
What's your psn
---
He isnt farming BP, he is farming salt and tears AND shattered DREAMS !
---
It will just kill the game for the casuals who can‚Äôt hit greats. Devs will sooner just nerf ruin rather than make it baseline.
---
I just feel like one of the most inherently spooky things about him is that he just stands still and then teleports instantaneously, something which couldn't happen as a killer without them basically having Spirit's passive phasing all the time.
---
If you played as the proxy and your power allowed you to have the Slenderman teleporting around tormenting and debuffing survivors, I think it'd create a really unique experience that would still allow for a regular playstyle killer.
---
Really cool comic keep it up and have fun in the blood hunt everyone :D
---
Im complaining about how the demogorgon is such a tease smh
---
that dude is garbo lmao
---
i don't wanna kill them :(
---
super garbo
---

---
Heyy, you still with it? I just got on now.
---
Okay now, I wouldn't go that far.
---
Personally I think they are just in over their heads and don't know how to prioritize correctly. Doesn't help that they backed themsemves into a corner by promising new Killers/Survivors/maps in set intervals.
---
If they just left out one release and set most everyone on the team on problem solving (yes, even the artists etc. since often it is very helpful to also brainstorm with "outside" people) they could already work out the basis for a proper plan (what are known problems, what are wortwhile user requests, what needs to be fixed, how to prioritize, etc) and implement a lot of quality of life changes and bug fixes.
---
Or if they have a plan it's not very obvious and they could just ummm "distribute" (let everyone know) it better. For example with the Epic Store they apparently have a public timeline of planned fixes and features. Sure, it'd  be a long list of bugs for us, but at least we'd know they know and are working on it.
---
He's probably new to the game
---
Removed please post /r/dbdLFG/
---
No happened to me at least 4 times tonight. Just gotta deal with it sadly
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
I just like doing it 'cuz you copypaste the same response everytime. "He is my friend, we do meme battle"
---
Myers is immune to detection perks in tier 1.
---
Cosmetics?
---
Actually, when you put it that way, it sounds a lot better. Maybe the Killer player as the proxy, and Slenderman will appear passively around survivors. The longer he's looked at, the more static and sound are obscured from survivors, while providing various buffs to the killer. Maybe have him slowly close the distance, the less he's looked at, and Slender coming into contact with a survivor will give the killer a notification/show aura, injure them, or teleport them within a certain range of the killer or something. Play a gamble, either look at him and slowly lose your senses, or risk him touching you and suffering from that, or just get off a gen altogether. Kinda like a mix of Doctor and Legion, and seeing as more killers are taking certain things from other killers power, it might not be too far off.
---
Broadly announcing massive cock ups on their end doesn't look great for potential new customers. If you went to buy a game and the first post you saw from the devs was about how buggy everything was it would put you right off.
---
After rank 8 or 9 usually see It on every killer
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ that was a rollercoaster
---
&gt;I guess you don‚Äôt understand how servers work. It‚Äôs easy for a server to make sure a killer has a good connection, prioritize a killer and then bring in survivors with suitable ping. Many other games have solved this problem. Do you work for the devs???
---
Well, I am not using "many other games" as reference. I am using what I saw during the multiple PTBs we had where servers were tested.
---
Yeah it had downsides, but they honestly weren't a huge deal.
---
Yeah they could chase you down and wait for you to bleed, but the effect was still powerful even when it wasn't a free escape because it took you **40 seconds** to bleed out.
---
Sure, you're going back on that hook. You've bought your team *at least* 40 seconds on gens in the process, not counting the initial 15 second timer or the 5-18 seconds the killer would spend carrying your body.
---
Oh, and it's at this point you remember that it only took 70 seconds to finish a generator at that time, meaning it only took a combined 350 seconds of gen time to power the gates. If all three other members were on gens for *just the duration of your bleedout*, they would complete 34% of the objective.
---
That alone is really strong, but when you combine it with all the other shit that was in the game at the time it becomes utterly gamebreaking.
---
* DS let you escape the killer's grasp the first time you were picked up.
---
* Sprint Burst could recover mid-chase, meaning that if you lasted 80 seconds *you got another one*.
---
* Pallet spawns were stronger, and on top of that there was Pallet Vaccum.
---
* BNP hadn't been nerfed yet, so survivors pretty frequently only needed to complete 4 gens.
---
* BHVR hadn't even *begun* to fix totem spawns yet.
---
* Self Care only took 12 seconds, and Sloppy Butcher didn't apply Mangled.
---
* Sabotage still hadn't been nerfed.
---
With all that other shit in the game, *the killer did not have time to deal with BT*.
---
Oh, and on top of that it's a get out of jail free card if you make it to end game without using it.
---
You also failed to acknowledge my primary complaint. Why are we completely cancelling matches when one survivor DC‚Äôs now? To make survivors happy even though they can instantly get in a game? What about the killer that just waited ten minutes or more for the match to begin??
---
And yet I did all four gens that were completed, by myself. I don‚Äôt use self care unless it‚Äôs an emergency. If someone is near me and I need healing, I will go to that person before waddling off into a corner to heal myself.
---
This is fantastic! I think it has great potential normally -or-  This could be an Ai controlled boss monster people fight randomly and instead of fixing generators it‚Äôs a race to find pages or maybe that‚Äôs how you unlock him or something I dunno. Great concept, I think players being blind is cool (but I think it should be ok for them to still move and interact like a blind killer) and the mori sounds great but I‚Äôd also like to see a mori where the player‚Äôs screen goes static and then has a jump scare (like those prabk ‚Äúlook closely‚Äù videos) or just has like a 3D static hand reaching out for the player and getting all the way to you seeing like a rough outline of its creepy face or whatever.
---
Its better, more bloodpoints and sets off on-hit perks
---
This is the fastest way with the amount you have currently the numbers will change if you have the other dlc's characters
---
Whispers so you know when to stalk.
---
Ok but we all vote to remove prayer beads for balancing /s
---
It‚Äôs really that hard to queu a survivor with a better connection when another drops out during matchmaking instead of completely resetting the match?? Maybe my kids should teach the devs how to code??
---
I might add that "Tunneling" is commonly abused as a term and people will call you that even if you aren't doing it.
---
If you find someone, hook them, encircle the entire map attacking gens and patrolling, and he's the first survivor you bump into and attack after you already hooked him, it's not tunneling, he just sucks at hiding.
---
If you hook them, run in a hard circle around the hook within 20m meters to make sure the INSTANT he's rescued you can see where he's going and immediately run after him again with no attempt to go anywhere or do anything else, you're tunneling.
---
Have you ever developed a video game?
---
I run Disco and Pop on GF. I've just been playing him all season so far and I just back in red (haven't got to play as much but it's also easier now b/c of new players). Combo works very will on stealthy and high-mobility killers. If used well it's both more powerful and much more consistent than Ruin, IMO.
---
If people are actually running it a lot, I'd like to find out if the reason is just a snowball effect from all the voices in the community insisting it's required or if they've actually crunched some hard numbers or have some kind of reasoning to back it up. Once again, I'm not saying it's bad, but you only get 4 perk slots.
---
The fact that her ability makes you tired every time you use it , in my opinion, makes her a very weak killer
---
Agreed. Ruin and Thanatophobia is getting annoying.
---
I meant like the effects quality. Not AA The effects quality causes survivors hairs to kinda drop quality bit not when it's at 0 I wanna turn the hair effects off to prevent it from dropping resolution when turning graphics to medium-ultra
---
Not enough bongo drums to fit this game.
---
Did he ever find it??????????!1
---
Shiet, fam, that's lit af

&amp;nbsp;  
---
^^^I ^^^hate ^^^myself.
---
Not really because when survivors die on a hook their corpses disappear
---
You should give him a leather outfit and make his head on fire as well.
---
Only works on lower ranks like 12-20
---
Oh! Sorry - to clarify. Not survivor bodies. Just corpses in general. Let's have a bunch lying around :)
---
and its already a thing too in hawkins
---
&gt;thats what they already do, often
---
How so?
---
This mainly happens on Disturbed Ward and Coldwind maps that I can remember from the top of my head, correct my if you know other maps. Every other map has hidden totems tied to a prop.
---
The devs hasd released some statistics.
---
Ruin was the most used killer perk across all ranks on all platforms.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests
---
Interpretation on why that is is up to you.
---
Personally at mid to high ranks for me when I don't run it (not everytime) but a lot of times gens start popping fast. If I can trade ruin for a hook or 2 and some pallets to get my momentum started its worth using.
---
Otherwise I often find if I don't get that first guy down fast or find multiple survivors and get some hits it results in 1-2 gens popped within the first 2 minutes.
---
Now that is if the survivors are doing their objective sometimes you get 4 randoms all too afraid to touch a gen first.
---
It's like most perks sometimes it helps sometimes it does not but I personally find it helps more then not.
---
Exactly! Some fun could be had with em, scaring the kids.
---
I rank up every so often after taking a month or two off to play other games, any game after rank 10, without ruin is almost an automatic lose, giving the right killer it's not but like 90% of the time it is, so I run it whenever I can.
---
You actually cannot see people directly in front of you as killer if you're looking straight (unless maybe it's a taller character like David), I know because people have gotten cheeky body blocks on me before by doing that.
---
This is why i use spine chill, no surprises for me
---
pretty much any map, except The Game can have totems directly on gens or next to the Killer shack
---
I never understood why people feel like they have a higher output from bps while 2x BP events are up. Or why you would use 4x bps in one match either for that matter. The killer can completely deny you points that match if you're tunneled (and worst case moried), or you can have useless teammates that creates a dynamic where you're left with a low amount of BP. Or the factor of RNG can kick in, and you find no remaining totems, cant find anyone to coop gens with, and other teammates are getting earlier to unhook than you, resulting in just a low-BP game. As far as im concerned you're better off spending one bps each - four games in a row, to average your outcome, instead of relying on all those factors to benefit everyone that 1 game.
---
ok.
---
Maybe when devs back off of the 20-30 minute killer queues that reset every time a survivor rage quits while loading then us killer mains will care. In the mean time I‚Äôm using every Mori I have during this event just to show my salt.

* In whatever line deals with the number of traps that are on the ground at game start, change the number from "5" to "0".

* Remove references to "maximum traps" from any add-on tool tips, since that stat really isn't relevant to players anymore.

There are a lot of things in DBD where it's super simple to *conceptualize* a fix to a problem, but are actually pretty complicated.
---
Anybody can say "please fix Phantom Saw" or "make Dedicated Servers less clunky" or "Fix Huntress hitboxes PLEASE", but actually doing those is damn hard.
---
This... this should not be one of those things. All this would take is simple number tweaks for things that already exist in the code.
---
I'm not an expert here, but it's not my job to be. If BHVR, who **are** supposed to be the experts, can't get this done, I would simultaneously be deeply concerned for the future of this game and very confused as to how we got this far.
---
Never said she wasnt, but the doc, hag, and huntress are available from the start on console. I only know so much as a console player myself, so i wasnt sure to include her or not
---
The game is super buggy from the stranger things update, the amount of people online won't affect anything

Just so it's clear to me, when you say forced to look do you mean the camera is actually forced and locked onto slender man??

It was 2 levels ago that I got Thanatophobia 1 for her for the first time.

Makes sense
---
Just be patient, Legion Buffs are confirmed to be coming, though no date is specified.
---
Legion was nerfed heavily because like Nurse he had no real counter and with the right add-ons could knock people down pretty much as fast as a normal killer whilst ignoring any obstacles. And that's before you factor his game-breaking moonwalk exploit. They went nuclear but it was warranted at the time, I feel they are going to dial him up a little at a time to test the waters and reach a median.
---
BHVR can fix this by making 1 Killer do all 5 gens while avoiding being killed by 4 survivors!

PC BUG: The end game timer bug still hasn't been fixed...just lost another game to this obnoxious bug with ultra rares 30 seconds earlier than should have been the case. Beginning to wonder how other paying customers feel about this "Experience".
---
Yep, if you're snowballing like crazy (the thing that you need to do to win) you'll get hit by decisive.
---
She's good but I have to give it to Demogorgon. His facial animations are just insanely detailed.
---
daaaammnnn Nurse, those thighs dont lie
---
Low ranks give every killer a bad rap. &lt;/3 My boi just has sneak in his heart and he loves to stab, I hope you understand.
---
Keep them coming good sir
---
To be fair, the radius of those feels pretty inconsistent sometimes.
---
I love how Insta-Saw Nurse may still technically work
---
I would disagree with that part. *most* of the time it's due to tunneling. the other lesser percentage you want to guesstimate is bad survivors just running back in to the killer. "why would i go after a healthy survivor" mentality that plagues this subreddit and in-game because snowballing doesn't exist to them. even then bad killers still cry about the nerfed version of DS pretending survivors are invincible. It's not uncommon to see a bad killer say something along the lines of "if someone has DS i will throw the game to tunnel them", same type of person to go on twitch and ask random DBD streamers they're thoughts on "DS being OP" so they can just try and reaffirm their stupid opinion. face any killer who's half way decent and they'll either willingly eat it or just slug you and wait it out.

could affect matchmaking, but they dont have dedicated servers so they shouldnt be feeling any strain
---
Well. I found it. Around 36 minute mark.
---
Thank you
---
this would destroy the game why would a killer decide to play swf
---
That's pretty common for 2 or even 3 gens to pop before the first down if they are playing very well, but you need to keep in mind that doing the gens gets exponentially harder as the number of gens dwindles, provided you can keep it on a tight patrol (keeping them off 3 or 4 close-ish gens).
---
Even if you have Ruin, this kind of efficient playstyle will be nearly just as effective, which is not as effective as people believe. They see a couple gens pop and they get worried, as if the other gens will just magically pop just as fast. What you need to keep in mind is that the same thing should be happening for you, but in reverse. You'll get slow hooks at first, and start getting them faster and faster as the pallets go and the survivors are herded into a smaller and smaller area.
---
Anything that helps snowballing or defending a tight group of gens seems like the ideal choice with this in mind. That's why my favorite perk combo on most killers is Disco + Pop. I even took them (+ BBQ and STBFL) over Nurses on my Mainface.
---
I thought sandbagging was when a Survivor vaults a pallet and basically screws over the other one because they can't vault it yet.
---
I think there must be some form of an issue on their side. I also can't believe that it must take 10+ minutes to find a single game as the killer on rank 12 (my situation). In your case, as the survivor, I believe it is because of those long-ass queues that killers take their plus ultra add-ons, Millenium offerings, and avengers threat level killers.
---
What I‚Äôm saying is I still get that feeling like I just waited 20 minutes to kill people I‚Äôm going to kill people I don‚Äôt want to farm it‚Äôs boring but if I start it and game will be over in 2 minutes I‚Äôd rather not have waited 20 minutes for 2 k bp . most killers probably just want to do just that kill people so they‚Äôre going to even if it‚Äôs ez win
---
Which data? This is the last one I'm aware of and it shows swf having a higher chance and surviving not solo...
---
Yeah, this is big brain time.
---
please start looking at steamlabs https://steamcharts.com/app/381210 as you can see 30,341 playing 32min ago the game has full of players

I never exactly thought of it that way. I'll try playing him like that and see how it goes.

Thanks for your input! :D

Not only are queue times broken, steam went down during my free time as well and I'm sure a lot of people had trouble with that too. They have extended BH's in the past so we can dream

There is also the possibility that the timer goes down, but the collapse starts 20 to 30 seconds early. It basically skips that last bit with no notification ahead of time.

Behavior needs to fucking hire you just so this gets put in.

1) Since you can't place portals next to the exit gate I think you probably can't, but would have to test this
---
2) There is the recovery from your attack, and having to charge it for 1s, but apart from that there is no cooldown

yeah when he get you exposed and u dont even notice him

if they balance around OP killers then they wouldnt be OP, everyone else would just be under powered.

The weapon mace for Billy is really cool but I don't know if the whole goth aesthetic suits him. His cosmetics always seem to have a rugged outdoors feel. Maybe it would be possible for some kind of dirty gothic outfit that could suit him but i'm not really sure.

Regardless, I really like this comic
---
Weird flex but ok
---
he‚Äôs an asshole for using something that‚Äôs in the game? so essentially he‚Äôs an asshole for playing the video game in a way you don‚Äôt like. This has to be one of the weirdest communities I have ever been apart of
---
Yeah
---
You mean the huge variety of Ruin,NOED,BBQ and Nurse's Calling. I mean. ALL of my killers use at least two of these meta perks. Both killers and survivors have these meta perks they use,not only survivors
---
Yesterday I was playing as Survivor and I got 84k bp (no offerings, but I had *We're Gonna Live Forever* perk)
---
I've waited 40 minutes and then I gave up.
---
4 token lullaby is worse than 5 token lullaby change my mind
---
That would also be a solution for long-que killers but bad solution for survivors. I've waited 40 minutes and then I gave up playing Killer.
---
I mean that they pretend that pallets and fast gens aren't messing up games for most killers with low presence. The devs pretend there's no difference between top tier rank 1 gameplay and potato rank 20 gameplay, which messed up the whole balance.
---
Points ain‚Äôt money so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that serious 
---
As much as I hate people who DC It‚Äôs more so them screwing over their teammates and stuff. 
---
People who DC don‚Äôt care that they didn‚Äôt get points lol  they do it so it Denys the killer their bbq stack (which many killers complain about that) they do it because they weren‚Äôt happy with how they were treated. They do it to get a rise out of people (i.e this post baby) and they do it just to be actual shitheads

From my experience it‚Äôs that about 80% of high rank player can‚Äôt hit great skill checks.
---
This is actually so good. Well done.
---
Truth. The real enemy is the Grind and the only meta perk is BBQ.

dont compare"yesterday, once upon a time" to "literally every game"

Personally I think he should have an effect like the doctor where you're exposed progress goes down over time. He shouldn't be able to save you at 99% with how quickly he can stalk. Especially due to how inconsistent it is

I'd download this as a mod
---
Preach the truth! Good luck in the fog.
---
ok boomer
---
Then they can just tap the gens. It's still not so much of a slowdown as to beat actually taking them off of the gens to begin with more often by using a perk that helps secure downs, IMO.
---
Seems someone just wanted to rant.
---
Honestly he's just not fun to play against. Seems like a lot of people share my gripes with him. Thanks for the comment
---
Known issue with timer. Bar doesn't show as moving or moves in chunks devs are aware.
---
Yeah nearly 100% of the games at rank 1 on PS4 have ruin. It‚Äôs a good perk. If it‚Äôs not taken out in the beginning and survivors can‚Äôt find it it leads to chaos with the right amount of idiots. As soon as someone gets hooked it starts to snowball usually. People get off gens to get rescue points in a desperate attempt to get anything especially if they sense this is a loss of a game and nothing gets done. 1 person hooked, 1 guys going for the save, 1 guy is wasting time looking for the ruin they passed 2 times already and the only guy on a gen just got found is how it goes a lot of the time. It especially demoralizes low rank people and some high ranks then they finally get the gen to 10-15 percent only to get hit with 3-4 ruin skill checks in a row and they miss all the great SC and now the gen is back to nearly no progression and oh look here comes the Killer. Lol so that‚Äôs the gist of why it gets used so much. Hope that helped.
---
Just let it go man. He clearly doesn‚Äôt care what you say...

There are no servers that's the problem.

You do understand that it also accounts people that have dbd open but aren't playing right?

My survivor queues are just as long.

You for real rn?

---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Get huntresses to max   
---
&gt; You dont even need to hunt after them cause they cant do any skill checks. 
---
You need all the luck in the game to pull this off. Rank 20 survivors would probably struggle but anyone decent would simply gen tap if you're going to camp your totems, that is if they're close enough for you to protect both. You still need to get tokens and people are going to look for your ruin. So good luck getting a perfect totems spawn, the right kind of survivors, and tokens before they cleanse your shit.
---
well if you take it there won't be any more insidious
---
Imagine waiting 20-30 min to try to kill everyone fast and waste the multipliers in BPS just to sit for another 20-30 min. How does that make sense at all? You‚Äôre saying you have to wait such a long time to play. So why not maximize your points since you aren‚Äôt playing a lot. I don‚Äôt get it.
---
There's invisible barriers around things like hooks where you cannot trap, so I'm certain it's the same for portals since it'd be exploitative. Plus, why would you *need* to trap a hatch? Just close it.
---
If hatch is spawned it won‚Äôt let you place it on the hatch.. however.. hatch can spawn in a portal.

Farming is just as boring as being tunnelled and camped for me. I'd rather just play a proper game even with 4 bps
---
He's annoying but not overpowered. Just wake up as soon as you enter the dream.
---
It's still a shitty move to tunnel someone right after unhook, especially if they seem like a newer/worse player when there's other obvious players around. It's really not a challenge at all if you play that way, not that any of that matters during farm events I guess.
---
repost..
---
Welp. I did. As said though the totem spawn doesnt need to be S tier but its just makes this easier. The survivors I was with were somewhere around 10 and under sooo it was pretty surprising how well it translated it over. They can gen tap it but at the end of the day, its gonna be a long time to gen tap it.
---
The way he complains shows he's definitely rank 4
---
Those effects are called "Broken," but it would be nice if it effected both anyway. Vigil is pretty bad, among like 30 other perks lol, I'm so sick of the same \~6 perks over and over again.
---
Level 11 ooh wee boasting now are we OP?
---
Jesus Christ Bubba what is that?
---
Arrgghh uh eeeeh eh eh *A lethal weapon*
---
I'm not the guy above. I just start by looking for totems right away. It is so obvious that the vast majority of the killers are running ruin. Might as well get a head start and look for ruin while cleansing all the other ones on the way.
---
Ur an idiot. Ppl are rage quitting during the loading screen on ur matches bcuz you brought amori. Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy
---
Touche! Lol
---
So you want to argue with people? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting at. 
---
No one is better
---
Shes aiming horribly
---
I don't see anyone failing to acknowledge anything. We know killer waits are garbage right now, you're not the first or last to point this out. They are giving explanations for it though so maybe stop taking your frustrations out on people offering explanations considering they have fuck all to do with fixing this? Double BP events always cause an increase in killer queues because killers generally get more points so more people spend more time on killer.
---
I always look away so I can hide my tears. Can't tbag me if I don't see it.
---
Sounds like you looped really well and somebody was pissed
---
Please do more
---
I dropped my glasses
---
People don't understand how shitty killer FOV is.
---
I'm tired of it
---
It sucks bcuz you never know what the other side is bringing. And some perks are just mandatory to make the game playable.
---
Distant Figure would be amazing on Ghostface.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was an event going on when I made my first post, this has been a problem for months now. Dropping a match while loading just because one survivor disconnects is just lazy coding. For the money this games takes for stupid skins they can FIX IT.
---
A lot of killers don‚Äôt enjoy being flashlighted or teabagged or taunted  (not saying you did that but I see you have a flashlight). Usually doing those things earns the perpetrators a face camp.
---
They have been significantly worse since they event started though. I agree they should be making sure they fix this but I'd take dropping out in a loading screen over a 3v1 all day long. 3v1s were always boring on both sides.
---
It's a *good* perk, yes. So is, for example, Nurse's Calling. Ruin is seemingly ubiquitous though, along with BBQ (which I get b/c of the double BP alone). People jam it into every build, every playstyle. It just doesn't make sense that something with as little impact is regarded so highly.
---
Your explanation focuses on teams that do poorly doing even worse due to Ruin, but if they are playing poorly the same can be said for many perks. Against proper survivors, it seems to me that it is better to equip something better suited to an actual playstyle and build, that actually helps secure downs to **keep them off the gens** (which seems to be the most effective way to slow gens by far).
---
I'm not saying there aren't nearly optimal builds and playstyles for certain killers that incorporate Ruin, but I do not at all understand why it's regarded so highly, so universally. It looks like it should be niche-meta, at best. This is what I am trying to understand.
---
Happened to me too, jumped right into Plague‚Äôs loving arms
---
More like cry about somebody that left the game on him.
---
I dont know what is wrong with reddit i have tried using it 3 times but it just doesn't work. It's a picture of Dewey saying his real name
---
Yea I do it a lot just to piss people like you off. Seems like you're pretty triggered.
---
Yup, if a survivor taunts and you face camp them, they are more than likely laughing their arse off as you do it because they know it got to you. Also flashlight blinds and pallets or flashlight saves aren't taunts, that's just a game mechanic.
---
Yeah you arent allowed to do that, it says so in paragraph 3 section A2 of the survivor issued dead by daylight conduct and operations bible.
---
How do you think slender man would work? 
---
(This is a genuine question not an asshole on the internet question) 
---
Obv slender man works that the more you see him, the closer he gets or some shit isnt it? Would make for an interesting game if devs worked it properly. 
---
Or whenever you see him your screen gets that white noise effect etc. 
---
I suppose I'm asking, as it was your idea, how would you go about it ref slender man?
---
If a survivor gets a flashlight save or a pallet save, that's well played on them and a mistake on my part, I never see it as a reason to tunnel or face camp
---
I don‚Äôt understand why everyone thinks every survivor is gen rushing.      It‚Äôs literally killer vs survivor, there‚Äôs always a constant advantage to the killer and with perks and stuff it just makes it harder.
---
If you think the game needs to be played as 1 gen completed every five minutes then you need to stop being a try hard killer lol.
---
Getting a gen a minute or two in always happens and it‚Äôs not rushing it‚Äôs literally just how it is as a survivor. If you can‚Äôt get over 1 gen happening or survivors not being dumb enough to die easily against you then that‚Äôs your problem..
---
WHAT HAVE BROUGHT UPON THIS CURSED LAND?!
---
Because few Killers would voluntarily put themselves at the significant disadvantage of playing against SWF groups, meaning SWF groups would rarely get to play and the game would die.
---
Watched this mainly because i'm learning how to use flashlights properly still. So you gotta aim it at their chest not their face...makes sense.
---
I'm also confused. It is on KYF but agreed having leveled up three killers now I've never seen any LF or Freddy perk in the bloodweb... I don't think then RNG can be that bad!
---
I agree that it doesnt justify a rage quit but thats not gonna stop ppl from doing it and like he was saying you end up causing your own problem again i never dc and also find ppl who do frustrating but that doesnt stop them from doing it just like how your saying it wont stop you from using it
---

---
NOED needs a dull totem left on the map to activate
---
100% but sadly a lot of killers get really upset about flashlights. Some even go as far as to waste a perk slot to trying to make you lose them lol
---
Well he was already injured before he started opening the exit gate and in that case noed or not he wouldnt have been able to risk the hit unless he was fully healed and without noed, but the killer did so it was one hit anyway
---
I'm almost always the last survivor standing unless I specifically get tunnelled or camped. I had pretty good hatch success before the change was made to allow killers to close it. Now I'm lucky to escape 1 in 10. Hatch is almost never an option so it usually comes down to ninjaing the exit gates, which is just as impossible against any competent killer. If there was more time you could mind game both gates but EGC will kill you long before that strategy is viable and one wrong move = game over.

You think grinding in r6 is worse

Oof

i love this! it would make the game much more immersive and scary! there‚Äôs something just super fun about having butt clenching music in a butt clenching chase! i‚Äôm excited to hear more! :)
---
I wish they would make it so 6 or 7 gens need to be done and change ruin to only effect toolboxes or something.
---
One time after my squad had finished all the gens, i saw a dull totem and my brain said F R E E P O I N T S, so I of course cleanse it, but when it gets cleansed lightning goes off and someone gets hit the second after I had cleansed it, he and everyone else escapes. Lo and behold the killer had noed and my rank 17 ass saved this mans life.
---
omg i have the fucking game in the pc and ps4 ps4 rank 2 at the moment pc rank 12 im queue right now in both systems lol 25 minutes in the ps4 ... 47 going in the pc 
---
Its just impossible to do any thing...  i cant spend the entire day in front of the pc/ps4 to play 5 or 6 games i was actually able to play a pc game while waiting for the ps4 queue
---
i dislike playing survivor a lot no one of my friends like the game " and im not going to force them" 
---
so just give survivors 2x bp to put them doing the same or more bp that killers and let ppl play what the like i cant imagine any real killer complaining about it

Everyone should upvote it because we need bhvr's attention.

Reminds me of a toilet with it open lol

"lul why you give up on the chase so early???"
---
That‚Äôs a lie, the offering that keeps you from losing your add-ons is also hidden. Either way, no offering is an excuse to rage quit. Especially now that it resets they entire match. In fact it should be bannable if you do it.
---
Especially if your playing against my insidious leather face build lmao.

Yikes!

my hot take is that freddy is S+ tier rn

He‚Äôs my second main...

Could have been a big but i guarentee it opens at 5 gens. It was changed when endgame was added.

There are some bugs that cause it to sometimes not spawn like a body where it should spawn.
---
I've had enough games where no gens are done and it spawns.
---
i was waiting for the dc... honestly that was rough
---
Survivors with flashlights.
---
The game is just overall shit once you reach Rank 5 or higher. Nothing but SWF, camping killers and douche teammates lol.
---
Survivors should get BT and DS. Killer should get ruin and noed.

I also had this one game, found ruin but leatherface was around so I ran off - Came back and he was still around, this time he chased.

3 gens popped because he refused to leave the ruin - I got facecamped for it. Even after a yolo save by a team mate, he slugged me and followed me around ontop of me.
---
Honestly though, I don't care. Camp me once your ruin is gone - Seems real smart!
---
That first hook kills me more than any other hook lol
---
Even if youre running 4 perks to heal yourself theres no reason you should be running around injured if you dont have to. Your blood trail will give away your position as will your characters pain grunts. Even if there is one gen left if it isnt 80 percent or higher you aren‚Äôt guaranteed to finish that gen. Your adrenaline may not get the chance to pop and you might die on hook because of it.  Frankly if you are injured and wont let me heal you or heal yourself youll be left working on that generator alone because im not sitting around waiting on the nurse to hear your crying from 50 meters away.
---
aaand it's fast enough to be able to use it "during a chase" if you manage to lose LOS with the killer.
---
&gt;and no, unless "don't touch me for a minute, even tho I ran into you and you got two other hooks off in that time", "tunnel me down and kill me before I get to the end-game, but actually no, cuz our rules forbid that" or "don't swing too soon, but actually you can't do anything if I'm not dumb and use it for distance" are counters in your book.
---
I only gonna comment on that since I never mentioned anything about tunneling and camping. That's not what happens on my games. Killers "patrol the hook" (didn't wanna say camp) and the moment the hooked person gets unhooked killer focuses on him even if the unhooker tries to get the protection hit. That happens to 4/5 of my games. If I happen to get unhooked and run in front of the killer I blame it on me. I don't expect him to let me be in that situation and I don't get mad at the killer and I am certain most survivors don't so. 
---
And don't get me started about the killer's rulebook. Looping,instaheals,flashlights and stuff. What happens in one side happens also to the other. There is toxicity in both sides. Both sides want the other to play in a certain way and not as the other side wants. You blame one. I blame both. That's all I am saying. Happy gaming
---
You run into the killer and he refuses to down you, because they are "friendly"
---
They down you and hook you and other survivors unhook you right away
---
You go to the killer again, but they won't hook you, cuz that would kill you
---
WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
---
and I'm not ruining the game, cuz farming is the opposite of playing the game. You are the ones ruining the game.
---
I feel that man.
---
Eh. Who cares. Both sides hate each other for some reason lmao. Even in the blood hunt, I won't farm until I have 2 survivors left. I usually try to kill off the 2 best players and let the bad ones dick around. I get a lot of shit when i play killer, but who cares? If the survivors are pissed for the killer playing well without camping or tunneling, then you are playing the killer well. Take it as a compliment to your skill
---
Trying to communicate with Bill. I have no mouth so I must ding.
---
Im about to release 1.3 It's coming along :) It may take me some time to figure out Android OS though. Not sure how themeing works on that OS
---
They changed the bloodweb with the Stranger Things chapter. After lv. 40 you get more perks every bloodweb. On your bloodweb you also had Calm Spirit which was taken by the entity.
---
I‚Äôve been away from the game for a while, I didn‚Äôt know that! Thank you :)
---
Sometimes when 3 perks are in the web you can get 2 of them. Havent been able to replicate it but get it on chance a lot.
---
Litterally only unsafe pallets on that map are the blue/white barrel or the forklift pallets. If you think others are, you gotta learn to run them
---
Not rank 1 and am on console, I'd rather go against any non 1 shot killer, than a 1 shot(excluding GF).
---
I got a guy in a trap at the gate once but i felt generous so put him down and walked away and then came back he was tea bagging...im like "what goes through your head" lol
---
The issue is that would make nurse *even more oppressive*
---
Console?
---
indeed
---
rank resets be like:
---
I got a tunneling bubba, then a tunneling spirit, then I got an iri head huntress and decided to dc and go play killer
---
That's because not connecting wastes time, which wastes more BP than usual.
---
If the game wasn't so damn grindy that you had to sign your life away to level up some characters during these events, people wouldn't care quite so much. As it is, pretty much everyone is more toxic than usual simply because they want/need those bp.
---
My personal teir list:
---
1. Nurse
---
2. Spirit
---
3. Freddy
---
4. Billy
---
5. Huntress
---
6. Ghostface
---
7. Myers
---
8. Plague
---
9. Pig
---
10. Hag 
---
11. Demigorgon (I could see him a bit higher but idk)
---
12. Doctor 
---
13. Legion
---
14. Clown
---
15. Leatherface
---
16. Trapper
---
17. Wraith
---
Damn, didn't realize there we're 17 killers lol.
---
*Trying to find a match as any killer
---
The first part of the power is completely worthless. 
---
* Forcing a camera turn doesn't matter, good survivors will have already taken in their surroundings and will be looking at the killer anyhow.
---
* Stopping survivors from dropping pallets is potentially good but the low range means they'll just drop it early. It also does nothing at windows, so a double LT wall just means you have to abandon chase. 
---
* The deactivation condition is... awful. The only noted way of deactivating your power is by influencing two survivors within 10s, and you can only influence a survivor once per activation. This means that if the survivors split up until you've tagged three of them, your static influence will effectively be disabled for the remainder of the trial. 
---
The second part of the power is fine. The fact that there is no CD or activation time displayed makes up for its potentially disastrous negatives. 
---
Perl 1 is awful. Skill check opacity is just completely meaningless. This perk does less than shadowborn.
---
Perk 2 is equally bad. It's like Fire Up, but the stats are somehow worse and you need survivors to give you stacks willingly. 
---
Perk 3 is blatantly overpowered.
---
Ruin makes the game longer for the killer while punishing all survs.
---
DS makes the game longer for the surv while punishing the killer for only focusing him.
---
I'd rather they just remove toolboxs altogether than give killers ruin baseline since newbies will blow up gens like there is no tomorrow. 
---
&gt;Then again, I‚Äôm only talking about rank 1 as that‚Äôs where I play
---
Do you not just get genrushed regardless? I'm a shitty killer, won't even lie - Hovering around 7-8 but survs will just power through purple ruin with toolboxs.
---
I almost never get my DS procced btw, Even when I'm tunneled I just get left on the floor.
---
You're welcome :) like many people are saying, with the new chapter there is now webs with 3 perks from 40 to 50 i think, and at lvl 50 there are webs with 4 perks and you can take two  again
---
replace it w a screenshot of a facecamping bubba and it‚Äôs perfect
---
the game as survivor is about confirming action : it's useless to let one teamate heals you if you think it's not gonna be fast enough to be full healed before the killer reach you. 
---
Optimizing your play isn't about the overall action speed of the team, but the capacity of the team to confirm their actions : healing someone, fixing one gen.
---
That's why the argument about self care being more optimal than looking for teamates to heal you is wrong. If you self care there is way more chance that you get interrupted b the killer doing so.
---
It's the same regarding your exemple. I can let you heal me while having a healing debuff but we do that we take the risk that the killer reach me before you finish and in addition we wouldn't have complete the gen neither. Big win for the killer.
---
Pc has Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse and Huntress for starters
---
Even if ward is not hidden, I assure that mori is not the only hidden killer add-on. Point is still valid.
---
I would changed it for NOED, but nice meme anyway
---
Is that the first time dlc has ever gone on sale on Xbox?
---
Prestige Billiam too.
---
Spinning a console killer in the corn isnt impressive tho
---
Me as Amanda. Literally sat for ten minutes and didnt get into a game, but get ine within 1 minute as a survivor. D;
---
God no, please don't encourage this.
---
The timer glitch happened to me as well. I was playing against a farming hag and the timer was stopped for me and I was healing myself next to exit gate. They pointed at the exit gate and when I left. They said that I left the match at the last second lol
---
it's understandable if you don't know how to loop
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
thanks for your input mate üëçüèª
---
That‚Äôs how i became a survivor main
---
I was so worried for you, sorry the game bugged like that! Thank YOU for the farming &lt;3
---
Youre welcome!
---
Just cleanse it lmao
---
I care very deeply about the drama between two people I don't know, and who don't know each other.
---
I‚Äôd even settle for open the exit gate as Steve, Dwight, or Adam.
---
Was supposed to come last patch but was riddled with bugs so got pushed back.
---
Feng's 8 Strike Palm performed on the killer to gently place Nea out of harm's way.
---
It used to be like that.. only that survivors intentionally tried to make the killer DC due to it, so the devs removed it.
---
Please make this a thing
---
You're among the few. Anyone I play with doesn't fear NOED until NOED, then bitch about it in chat.
---
Lmao this is great
---
Servers are fine on PS4, but you'll have to wait a few minutes if you're a survivor who is swf sometimes. Unfortunately, this last patch really introduced a lot of bugs to this game, so just beware.
---
You probably just havent played enough to get bored of the meta. Once you've played enough matches you'll start to want to experiment new stuff
---
Ever heard of the Shroud of Separation?!?  Boom. Don‚Äôt bother replying.
---
I know right
---
Kill them with kindness. I like it.
---
I didn't expect the community to react to my work like this ! It can't be the last one for sure, I'm taking note sir ! Leatherface and Ghostface pop up regularly, it seems like I got a direction !
---
uh, no.
---
\*wishhhhhhhhh\* Shamisen intensifies.
---
Thank you sir, glad you enjoyed it !
---
Shroud of Separation's sole purpose is to act as a fake Mori
---
Farming bps
---
Genuinely got goose-bumps, this is amazing.
---
Ok, which killer perks are overpowered?
---
Some killers should really get their own chase music. Spirit is definitly one of them. Together with clown
---
it's like how you ask your dad about something and he tells you "go ask your mom" and you mom's like "go ask dad"
---
looooooooolllllll so the game should change because you don't play it enough? 
---
rank reset used to reset you back to rank 20. no matter what. if you're having a hard time getting back to red ranks, i'm gonna be honest with you and say you really aren't "experienced," enough.
---
And intense aswell! When I was composing it I was like "hmm, how could the chase sound intense and kind of epic at the same time", imagining vaulting windows and stuff, was really funny to make ! Have a beautiful day &lt;3
---
I'm guessing it's just the old vicious dbd cycle. Probably got some bm last game and just started bming as well. Not defending the dude, he shoulda atleast just hooked the dude and moved on.
---
I will admit, I used no-ed yesterday. However it was another match against an all flashlight swf that I had played against in the match before, so I don't feel bad
---
Dude, you think you‚Äôre getting next to no bp as killer without bbq? Have you ever played survivor without a bp boost?
---
I will for sure continue to do some ! My channel was initially Resident Evil focused, but I guess I've found a new jar of honey ! I don't know if BHVR will notice, who knows !
---
thank you sir ! Scary for the first time ? You don't like the OST from the game ?
---
Thank you ! Honestly I wasn't ready for how the community is reacting to this... But seeing how it goes, it's clearly not my last one ! I'm taking notes on what everyone is saying, I don't have enough subscribers to setup a poll on youtube so I'll study the trend a bit to know what will come next ! Make your voice heard !
---
How do three gen strats affect what I said?
---
on  my first day i was turning off messages on the ps4 you must be the kindest killer in the world or the worst  looper ever
---
To anyone wondering what happened:
---
1. Nea and Claudette went into the basement and hid in the lockers.
---
2. Dwight killed himself on hook.
---
3. The other Dwight god downed. I tried him to stop wiggling so I can give him the hatch, yet he didn't stop. Then, this. GG
---
Love it
---
It's been 2 times that my daily ritual comes back to the one I decided to throw away after some times :/
---
Hahaha thank you sir. Been working in advertising for years so maybe that's related :O peepoAsk
---
Do you play survivor or killer?
---
This is honestly the most effective way to prestige and reduce the grind. 650 hours in since December 2018 with:
---
 3 P3 survivors with 53 perks all tier 3(all the perks I have unlocked) atm,other survivors at level 40
---
and
---
P3 Plague,Huntress and Spirit,with 45 perks all T3(all perks I got currently),bubba,hag and billy P1 level 50 waiting to get P3'd, and the rest at level 40.
---
Though keep in mind that I only have hag,plague,spirit and bubba as DLC and the rest are locked for me,but I have unlocked needed ones through the shrine
---
UNIVERSE BRAIN: Get all perks on one unprestiged killer and then one week later decide to prestige him anyways because blood outfit cool
---
Haha this. I've put that in the description if you pay attention Xd
---
If you have borrowed time, or someone on the team does. I‚Äôd say *try* to go for save. If not, then yea just gen rush
---
That skill tho
---
i agree ... the first time i played the game in the ps4 i only played Billie went up to rank 4 before deciding on trying the hag ... that i lvl up for ruin ... and omg it was crap load of  bad games almost no perks no practise etc etc
---
Yeah, I know the feeling. It sucks. Like, everyone's gotta start somewhere lmao
---
I was thinking about that... but I only have funny / trolly things in my head concerning Clown XD
---
Especially now for the double bp event where every damn Killer is like double sweaty.
---
It can only see you if you move lol
---
My first Michael game I was scanning and he was just... standing like 20 feet away. Didn't even notice me til I jumped and blew a skill check.
---
I don't think that will make the difference you think it will.
---
First off if its not even visible until it opens then you have no chance to find it early and take note of its location if you have to make an escape using it. The killer can move around the map freely and faster then a survivor because killer is the one on control. As a survivor you have to sneak or risk being found and not knowing where it is.
---
And having it open when someone is hooked is just silly "ohh last guy is on struggle" and then you just get insta open hatch...
---
Unless you mean he is dead but the sacrifice is not complete before opening then even more killers would just slug then now to stop hatch. No point in hooking second last survivor if hatch will insta open if they don't struggle or are on death hook.
---
Enough killers slug to get the 4k now and enough shitty teammates urban around the map to get hatch instead of playing. With the changes you want to be "fairer" would make both of these moves even more common.
---
The hatch is not meant to be a free escape or necessarily an easy escape it is meant as this last luck based rng sliver of hope of maybe getting out alive. Or forget that and bring a key and gtfo then second the hatch spawns.
---
And yes with your change keys would be almost useless.
---
For sure ! Let me know if you want a specific character's music ! I'm reading all comments since I can't setup a poll on youtube for now ! have a nice day !
---
Also btw you haven't provided a single reasoning as to why a monthly rank reset is a good thing in your view, still waiting on that.
---
I get this every time I'm playing plague. I'm not very good with her but I stream and they like her so I just throw up on ppl. The people who disconnect are losing out on some ez blood points too.
---
Maybe, but right now I'm having fun with stuff like Dead Hard and Borrowed Time, and I'm super glad I got DS from this week's Shrine (you have no idea how often people tunnel at my ranks)
---
There are more people in this game not complaining about being able to rank up to their appropriate ranks than the other way around. If you don't want to get reset to gold ranks, play the game more. I get reset back to rank 10 every RR, and it takes me like 10 games to get back to red ranks. If you can't get past gold ranks, maybe that's where you belong for now?
---
Lithe is nice too.
---
When I'm feeling daring, I run a "silent" build - technician, iron will, urban evasion, and stake out.
---
100% backing this, ridiculous how fast our survivor games go.
---
I‚Äôm scared of Susie now
---
They said this fall so it wasn't pushed back far
---
Uhm because, eventually, everyone would be rank one and there wouldn't be an appropriate system to separate and make fair games? 
---
Didn't think it was that hard lol
---
No
---
Yes, and you can instantly escape. A certain amount of generators have to be done though
---
You should try it! Hag is a really good killer tbh. You just have get used to not chasing with her.
---
So why does it have to be MONTHLY? Why do people who've played in R1 get put back into browns and golds?
---
Wait si chasing is now tunneling?
---
They do a certain amount of original chapters and then the same amount of licensed content to balance out the game.
---
Honestly, in nearly 3 years of using this sub, this is I think the 1st concept I seen that didn't leave me thinking, "This is horrible" due to how weak or strong everything was.
---
Is it perfect? No. But it's really not bad at all.
---
Looking at the perks, Migraine would probably be weak for the same reason Huntress Lullaby is weak which is good survivors realistically aren't going to struggle with or whatever it. I feel increasing the effect would be fine in theory. Distant Figure I feel would need work regarding the numbers and the seeming lack of token fall off. 25% blind and stun resist imo is relatively strong for one perk that would likely stack fully in the early game. Adding some sort of fall off I feel would help a lot depending what the token fall off conditions are. Gripping Tendrils I feel would be too strong though. Pair it with Bamboozle and you can shut down every loop in an instant. Safe pallet loops? You just force the vault once and you get a hit and the only way to counter that would likely be vault a nearby window. I feel as though pallet blocking shouldn't really be a thing considering they're meant to be time wasters and can already be broken. I think the perk as a whole would need a change but to what, I got no clue.
---
Add-ons I feel need a big rework. They shouldn't be outright stat increases such as attack cooldown, movement speed, etc. Simply changing those to things such as more pages, faster teleport cooldown, etc. Would be good. The ones that aren't just, "More lunge range" and such are pretty good though. For example: Look at the purple/pink add-ons. Those are really good I feel. Cleansing causes exposed, teleporting gives undetectable, etc. One of the pink ones is essentially massive lunge range but less movement speed and attack cooldown. That's an example of an acceptable stat change add-on because it gives a strong benefit but causes a big loss.
---
The power seems decent, but not all that amazing. The teleport is nice, the pallet block is okay, no items I feel might be becoming a bit too annoying.
---
Either way nice concept best one I think I seen. Not perfect but it's also just a concept not a soon to release so worth keeping that in mind as well when it comes down to balance/design.
---
Is it even possible to not 4K as spirit ? Unless you let them go ?
---
"So THAT'S where I left it!"
---
"Oh so you wanted Unrelenting instead? What about Sloppy Butcher on Plague? Have you tried Distressing on Michael and Ghostface? You wanted Spirit Fury on Nurse, right? How about Iron Maiden? Maybe just a little Predator? I'll make sure to sprinkle in some Territorial Imperative for you. Oh yeah, can't forget Beast of Prey!" -The Entity
---
Make it a toggle,
---
Because 360 only works against bad/newbie and on console, can confirm, am bad console killer
---
nah didn't say that, talking about actual tunneling when despite running into other survivors giving no chase or not trying to hide, they still look for your ass
---
Oh lmao I'm sorry
---
That would be funny to see their reaction ! Omegashare it !
---
I just want all haha :D Nurse and Plague will be interesting. I‚Äôm looking forward what you will create üòÅ
---
I'm not sure how to do it, any suggestion ?
---
Velociraptor take it or leave it
---
What was your build if you don't mind me asking I've been itching to play Freddy
---
This is amazing! Please continue to make more. May I suggest Wraith or Ghostface next?
---
I find ghostface to be underrated, and he's amazing on the indoor maps. If you play him right the stealth alone will give you a free hit. Super fun to play as, and scary to play against
---
My pleasure if you enjoyed it :D  I need more subs to setup a poll, but for now I'm reading carefully all of your suggestions ! Make your voice heard for what's should come next !
---
"Lmao look he lost me what an idiot"  meanwhile killer has NEGATIVE fps
---
That would be funny :O
---
The Clownening
---
Wait, Joe is white? I thought he was black
---
Are you purposely misunderstanding my point or did you escape from a lab?
---
The issue is that it's a fucking waste of time to play matches where everyone is shit. A game should never feel like work, if it feels like you need to do something unfun to be allowed to play, it's designed in a shitty way. Skill-decay is not significant enough of a reason, it takes maybe half a match to 2 matches to get back into the groove even after taking time off. The problem isn't that ranking up is too hard like you're trying to twist it to be, the issue is that there is no reasonable excuse for the mechanic to even make you play through those ranks again.
---
http://fby.pw/v9rZ.png
---
Very similar to the demo tho
---
Thank you sir ! I can't setup a poll for now on youtube (need 1000 subs) but I'm reading carefully all your comments guys ! Thank you for the suggestion :D bingbong music will be funny to make for sure !
---
Well yeah but i'm not gonna make him black with marker xD
---
Fuuuuuuuuck if I could play as Kurt Russell in his prime I'd have a new survivor to main
---
*Chases person for 30 seconds to a minute*
---
*Two to three gens pop*
---
"Lol, why did you chase them all game, you need to patrol gens"
---
Yeah and with experience ghostface isn't great against red ranks and also larger maps like shelter woods for me are a chore since you have to walk long distances
---
after finding a lobby, the game proceeds to give me three survivors and nothing more.  
---
as they all leave, the next batch of survivors enter, repeating the cycle until i requeue.  
---
finally, i have entered the game as a baby nurse, only to scream in agony as the game has decided to give me the third consecutive cornfield map in a game where i burned a bps and a plaid flannel.  
---
sorry for the rant, that just happened to me.
---
Not imo but in that sense so is Ghostface to Legion and Leatherface to Hillybilly Edit- I did not just put Hillybilly xD
---
"His Perks, GIVE YOU UP, LET YOU DOWN and RUN AROUND AND DESERT YOU, allow him to do all those things."
---
 Body blocking isn‚Äôt bullying... Nor is using items and perks that the game literally gives you..
---
On ghostface
---
A nice early boost.
---
Exactly. The frame rate actually isnt my problem personally, it's that killer sense doesnt go nearly high enough. That combined with the fact that its easier to spin on console than pc since you just twirl a stick makes corn maps nearly impossible most of the time.
---
Same and I wonder what his perks would be
---
I just finished a game where the team flashlight clicked and t bagged because I couldn't hit them with my chainsaw because they were laggy and it looked like they were teleporting, then the endgame time finished and half the team died because of it.
---
I guess it depends if you ever want to get a character to prestige 3. With survivors it totally makes sense since they are interchangeable, aside from how much noise they make. 
---
Man I have the opposite problem: I have all the killers and it has been a *pain* to get them all leveled up. I would say I feel like I've wasted my time but that isn't exactly true because I like playing killer more, so the variety can be good. With survivors I only have Dwight, David, and Meg levelled up, so when I level others up I can get the good teachables from Meg easily.
---
The totem swapping mechanic would only effect Ruin and probably Lullaby. It clearly wouldn‚Äôt be for Devour Hope or HG. But it‚Äôs not like we can‚Äôt change totem mechanics for Ruin until the entire game gets fixed because totem spawns are still jacked.
---
For him in the thing I have idea I could think of a few from big trouble or escape from new York
---
Haha I take notes ! I can't setup a poll for now on youtube (need 1000 subs) but I'm reading carefully all your comments guys ! That's funny, I was thinking about what could be a plague theme when I was in bed :D
---
Words !
---
I haven't seen that yet but it's on my list
---
You did
---
Shhhh tell no one
---
So cool ! Really glad you enjoyed :D which role are you playing the most ? I can't setup a poll for now on youtube (need 1000 subs) but I'm reading carefully all your comments guys ! If you got any suggestion, let me know !
---
Whaaaaaa stop posting on Reddit and watch big trouble in little China and escape right now
---
So do I, and a poor guy I played against had a glitch where it sounded like he was constantly clicking his flashlight, and I though he was being extra toxic so I made sure to get him out of the game quickly because man it is fucking annoying to only hear a flashlight being clicked 24/7. Turn out he wasn't and I apologize in the end game chat and we had a laugh about it.
---
IF YOU'RE GOOD AT THE GAME YOU WON'T BE IN GOLD RANKS FOR LONG. 
---
ffs. 
---
like seriously dude? how do you not understand it? 
---
IF YOU'RE GOOD AT THE GAME YOU WON'T BE IN GOLD RANKS FOR LONG.
---
once again, rank reset exists because everyone would be red rank eventually.
---
imagine saying you're super experienced at the game, but complaining that you can't get out of shit ranks. feelsbadman
---
Because it would be a two gen strat because there's only 7 on each map
---
Thank you so much for the suggestion mate ! I can't setup a poll for now on youtube (need 1000 subs) but I'm reading carefully all your comments guys ! Trapper might be a reaaaaally brutal one, can't wait to take some time to think about this !
---
Pretty good list, only things I would change is have Hag much higher and Trapper a bit higher.
---
Yea that Key Add-On is too OP.
---
You definitely earned my sub. Get it out ASAP and you'll get an instant trapper vote from me haha
---
Because there has been constant whining during this event. What does that have to do with you telling me I should remove the names? One is me, the other is the killer that I complimented. Find something else to be offended by.
---
I imagine you be like 
---
*Hard breathing*
---
Laughing your ass out
---
Issue is being forced to play those matches at all. It's bad design. Don't defend dogshit design. Just because it's not a significant issue doesn't mean it's good design, and all bad design needs to be improved.
---
Are you swf? Solo? Killer? What time is it for right now? All of these are factors.
---
PS4 version is still very active.
---
Same. More than 10 too, and the most I got was 1 person bringing it in -_-
---
The clown thing is true. They said they would only do humanoid things, So Demo and Thing could be in the game. The main problem with shapeshifting is that it‚Äôs destroyed by swf. Also if you shapefshift into a survivor, would your movement speed be 100%? Because that‚Äôs waaaay too slow, but if you keep the 115% movement speed as a survivor form they would immediately know its you.
---
Killer pretty much just has noed and maybe a couple others that O can think of. During my time as a survivor main (killer main nowadays), I only realized how many crutch perks survivors have. I used to run BT, Self-care, Dead Hard, and D-Strike all the time, and then when I tried using a build without those, I was absolute shit. I had incorporated them into my play style, and playing without them was difficult until I started to get used to not having them
---
That's absolutely false, a 2-month season or permanent green ranks after reaching R1 would not cause that.
---
Now you're probably gonna pull the:
---
 "but those changes aren't what I was arguing against".
---
To which I'll respond with: 
---
"I never said completely abolish rank reset or make seasons 3+ months, you made that assumption based off nothing".
---
I agree with this 100%. Being really good at one particular killer and getting to a high rank with them means that if you want to test out another killer you get bullied due to not being as strong with that character.
---
Same and it only ever re rolls it when its a surv one, killer ones always work fine for me which sucks because of the 1 year queue timer
---
Happening to everyone. Trash dev team is trash, all you can do is endure it. Or hey, play something else for a while, like Civ V.
---
I mean, she's more than half-naked, only "clad" in bandages that don't even fit the time she's from, her breasts have unnecessary, out-of-line, over-the-top jiggle physics, and she has a school uniform cosmetic for underage girls, that features a shorter-than-normal skirt, and panties. I find that to be pretty tastelessly sexualized, and insofar it depicts a young girl that died a horrible death, pretty appalling.
---
I also find her sound design to be pretty laughable, rather than haunting. From the "wah"s and "mwah"s to the vacuum sound effect they for some reason thought would go well for her phasing. The glass crackling and entire glass element of her design is pretty cool however. Her body and facial movements are interesting, but also more comical than unsettling. I do like the first-person view of her hands, their animations, and how the weapon was implemented visually and mechanically. Coming out of phase does look cool, though I would prefer if her "phantoms" retraced her entire phasing path that way. I'd also prefer if she'd have the vaulting animation she had had in the PTB. I like the pale blue of her skin, indicating obviously that she's a corpse, but I feel like they should have gone more into the extremes of a corpse aesthetic, which looks a lot more gruesome than she does.
---
&gt; While killers just get buff after buff after buff.
---
Because pallet vacuums, double windows, and Sprint Burst re-activating mid-chase were 100% healthy, balanced, and necessary.
---
The Thing does move pretty fast in the movies and jolts onto ceilings ect and I'm sure they could think of something more intelligent than what I'm saying they're pretty good at that so far. Also The Thing has humanoid appearances too the same size a survivor and would have cool alternate cosmetics.
---
Yea I went to survivor in the end :D
---
Survivors bitching about getting killed, what else is new.
---
Lol 2 months? 
---
Again, if you're having a hard time getting back to red rank within the timespan allotted, you don't belong in red ranks. Everyone I know down here have no issues ranking up. Maybe you should... idk... git gud?
---
I didnt say fantastic, its certainly not top tier. But this is overkill.
---
Did she block the whole time, or did she release you all from prison after hitting you guys.
---
I always freaking take off my Calm Spirit perk just as I get a match against him -.-
---
All 3 of that killer's/survivor's original perks, and the usual 4 perk slots.
---
Sprint bursting 6 to oblivion
---
I‚Äôm with you on this. I‚Äôve wanted Thing sense day one. Btw what we really need is a petition to the THE FLY into dbd.
---
I feel so bad for you lmao
---
@3:51 in "difficulty in videogames part 2" but i remembered it wroung, he said "tough" not hard.
---
Original
---
I got the game 2019... i have em
---
I've had survivors bitching even when they escaped...
---
Carrie confirmed
---
they still tried to pick up a survivor who got unhooked less than one minute ago.
---
Swf shenanigans.
---
Make it 12k and give more points for dc'ing players.
---
3k in each category for killers plus BBQ stack if he didn't get it already and 3k in each category for survivors with 2 We are gonna live forever stacks if he hasn't maxed it out yet
---
The new Legion buff looks great
---
BBQ, NOED and Spirit Fury are all completely broken and OP perks that absolutely can't be countered by getting in a locker, cleansing dull totems and dropping pallets early! 
---
Honestly the only bullshit killer perk I can think of is bamboozle, just because it's so lazy. It literally means you don't have to learn how to run tiles, because you just block the vault. And insidious, I suppose, but that's just a stupid perk from the ground up.
---
Its a problem yes... but it does not need fixing, fixing it would cause problems
---
Again, if you played more, you wouldn't be deranked. Periodt. Would you rather have it like other multiplayer games where you just spawn in with whomever and go from there? Because that's pretty much the alternarive lol. Your problem is unique to you and people like you, not the whole collective of dbd players.
---
We just had this tested, actually. Matchmaking was fucked and red rank survivors were spawning in with gold rank killers and survivors. I double pipped in rank one every time, no problem. I'm assuming if I stopped playing for 2 months and deranked down to the 15 cap, I would double pip each game, again. Would take me 10, really easy, games to get me to green ranks, and another 10 to get me back to killers with at least some type of brain. That's like a day of grinding, and I'm by no means the end all be all of this game.
---
So, if you're having a hard time, then maybe you're at the rank you're supposed to be in. Plain and simple.
---
Does Dream Pallet Freddy with his slow down build count as ruining bloodhunt?
---
Nea, Laurie, Ace, and Feng were all before David
---
She didn‚Äôt lose her collision after hitting someone? That‚Äôs definitely a weird bug.
---
Lol. Basically just stealth stab, not marking. It so far seems to catch people off guard and makes them adapt to facing a different version of Ghostface almost.
---
What problems? And yes it need a fixing, you can't just leave a hole in a wall and pretend it doesn't exist
---
Killer games take like 10 minutes, but survivor games are pretty quick to find
---
From bunny mom*
---
Use "We're gonna live forever" + "Borrowed time"
---
I can't wait for the rework ugh
---
We're gonna live for ever, borrowed time, mettle of man, and prove thy self
---
–ë—É–±–±–∞–Ω–¥–∞
---
WGLF, Second Wind, Dead Hard, Well Make It. Not exactly a farming build but I like the build
---
Wait, there are quiter/louder survivors than others from a game mechanical standpoint? Which ones are the quietest?
---
Idk, I just had a game where a bill saw me stalking him(I was playing Michael) as he was doing the last gen and he just let me get tier 3 and down him at like rank 6 wtf lmao
---
In that case nerf genrushing, remove pallets and flashlight saves.... done. Now you can remove hookcamping. The game is fine how it is
---
Deleted other commented, wanted to add more, imo yes absolutly, the only flaw with her is that her power doesn't fit her lore, but that's it, otherwise she's absolutly amazing
---
&gt;people who don‚Äôt teabag tend to be the least toxic  
---
In other news: water is wet!
---
*PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT*
---
Is not fine at is if people complain about those problems
---
I just don't find it worth the slot over a more tangible effect.
---
mann. wish i thought of putting that over this
---
It only activated if you can hear the killer‚Äôs terror radius. If they killer it‚Äôs far away, the unhooked does not receive borrowed time.
---
People literally complain about everything
---
...Realistically, that‚Äôs literally what‚Äôs going on right now. At the highest levels of play, it‚Äôs Billy or Nurse, every other killer is suboptimal compared to their absolute domination.
---
"just never experience burnout lol".
---
So what would be bad about simply not dropping below greens after having multiple seasons in Rank 1? I always hit it when I play a lot, all I want is to float greens-purples to have real matches while still playing on and off, because I will never be bad enough ever again to reasonably have real matches in yellows.
---
Uhh
---
Nah it won't, dailies also don't give double bps
---
i guess it represents that the circle cannot hold up if one gear is lost
---
Yeah, but is easy to see from the salt from the real problems
---
&gt;Mann
---
*I see what you did there*
---
When i play killer, I almost never see borrowed time or decisive strike activate. If I down someone who I suspect might still have their DS timer active I'll just slug them and try to find someone else. Leaving a survivor on the floor meaning someone has to come heal them is much preferable to eating a DS and having to chase that same survivor again leaving the others to work on gens. If I'm absolutely dominating the game i might just take the DS anyway. I'll usually only ever trigger borrowed time if the survivors manage to unhook once all the gens are finished and I'm being forced to stay near the hook to secure the kill, but if the survivors manage to unhook without me grabbing them they kind of deserve the escape there. 
---
As survivor I'll always try to include borrowed time in my build because it means you have the option to go for unsafe saves if you need to. I'm not so worried about bringing DS all the time but then when I get farmed by a teammate without borrowed time I regret not bringing it.
---
?
---
I just don't see the reason to post this lol
---
I wish I could say this is low rank behavior but...he was probably one of the shirtless myers advocates here on reddit.
---
Gachibass Clap
---
honestly calm spirit isnt even useful if you go against a clown or the doctor. the "intoxicated" and "shocked" event still shows up on the killers screen
---
Sure, but if you follow up the save by aggressively teabagging, or going click click clicky at the killer.... eh, you kinda ask for it. That's toxic.
---
And if you have a macro for flashlight buzz... oh boy.
---
Bbq was on the shrine a few weeks ago so i dont think its comming back anytime soon
---
Thank you for the fast response... and I am glad you told me about dailies too dude coz I nearly played a game as killer (I such as killer haha)
---
I suck at looping but play so much that I rank up still.
---
Will you do other killers? Because i love this.
---
You can't just say why not you need to explain your reasons
---
Sad to say this happened to me too earlier.
---
Thankfully I promptly found the ruin proper and avenged myself.
---
yes, to make it work for Infectious Fright and future scream perks/powers
---
Calm Spirit is always worthy of a perk slot in my loadout. &gt;.&gt;""
---
I mostly use monitor and abuse for the fov but the other effect is nice which is y I chose it over shadowborn
---
I call bill ‚ÄúBilliam‚Äù
---
Absolutely. I feel like if I ever put a level in above 50 without prestiging, that's just a level of points wasted when I do.
---
Regardless of the value of it, a character won't feel complete until they're fully prestiged. And I can always use their bloody outfit if it fits with other store cosmetics.
---
BRUUUUUH how many fucking chromosomes do you have? You have to prove why it's not good, i don't have to prove it's good
---
I play it solely for the BP gain, but I never believed anyone who claimed the same thing until I got the perk.  Most of the time, I already know where I have to go next after I hook the survivor so the auras do me little good. Plus, by the time you get across the map to where you saw a survivor aura, that person is probably long gone.  
---
Even without BBQ, however, the killer BP gain is exponentially better than survivor.
---
WRONG! zeb 89 play both survivor and killer, and play from day one, and he focus when talking to the game balancement, being himself a developer of other games (but thats not important) , is in a group with other red ranks and don't talk only about one side
---
Yeah, but when you mess up a healing skill check, you scream, which is what gives the loud noise notif, you don't scream if you have calm spirit, meaning no notif. It's not the most useful thing, but i like it.
---
You mention hentai yet also mention standards
---
They're both bad IMO
---
Just use a comodius toolbox with speed add-ons and you got yourself a jack of all trades.
---
You get 160 charges + the same speed you get with engineer's
---
Yeah I'm sitting with David with every perk maxed out at p3 50, but killers are all unique so they take far more priority over points in any other survivor.
---
I think as of today I'm at 8 p3 50 killers, only one with every perk maxed out.
---
the entity did take nodes from the bloodweb since release.
---
r/blursedimages
---
Can you make GhostGorgon next?
---
If you talk like this i guess you didn't saw the community in general, the problems that even the developers talked about, and maybe you lost arguments
---
Better watch out, anytime I try to tell people this I get downvoted to hell by baby survivors who think it's the best perk in the game.
---
That would work well with we're gonna live forever, but protection hits also get tokens so mettle of man could work well
---
That doesn't make their opinion unbiased.
---
Anyone who would want THAT for Decisive has very little understanding of game balancing.
---
Play Survivor?
---
I mean, it's not ideal, but some bloodpoints is better than no bloodpoints.
---

If you are lucky to get a game as one

My girl Susie looks great
---
I just gave an idea, not saying how it shouls be, theres definitely better ways than how i said it but right now is keep getting discussed
---
Its fine how it is
---
Can you imagine they scrapped her best animation?! BLADE SHATTERS WHILE HAVING SOMEONE ON YOUR SHOULDER AND SLAPPING THINGS! Why BHVR why üò≠
---
Honestly.
---
I've been playing a lot of killer during the event because playing survivor is just aids lately. Too many survivors wasting time or too many legitimately tryhard killers.
---
I play both survivor and killer and killers have it so much easier. Every time I see killer mains cry about how hard they have it I just have to roll my eyes. They're the ones who control the flow of the game.
---
I have to say, maining killer has been a much more enjoyable experience this bloodhunt, even with the queue times. I don't have to deal with bullshit from either other survivors or killers, I can just do my own thing and give everyone a good time.
---
I think the issue is some killers get so damn immersed they need to 4k or they can't have fun. The game's been out for how long and you still need to play by the book?
---
Probably the same snowflakes with private profiles too. Just an all around embarrassment.
---
If you play killer lol
---
Aww, they're so cute you could think they'd be hiding something.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 too. Idk why as killer it takes 10-15 minutes...like helloooo I‚Äôm the Host!!!
---
The 15 min queues as killer get better the more you rank up? Or its the same at all levels, i have seen streamers get games in like 2 minutes butim stuck forever in ashit lonely lobby.... just got someone from london, wtf is this, there is no people playing in america?
---
Its really bad how people cant look before posting something, its literally posted every few minutes
---
yeah i was thinking of redoing proportions a little bit. Stuff like the hand has to be large or else you cant really add enough detail too it i had some works were i tried doing a more realistic hand size its pretty bad. I had to the noise pointy because if it wasnt then it look like a big bulge. The face looks a lot better up close usually in games pixel graphics are a lot in your face so are able to see a lot of detail. I could totally make the knife a lot bigger doe thats a given  i was thinking about this earlier so thats totally something im planning on doing. The thing is usually when you use 3D models for reference to dont translate that good too 3d from so you gotta add a lot of mass for details. Anyway il give it a revision later today.
---
Hook someone. Use BBQ to scan map. See nobody. Stay in that area. It is usually a logical choice.
---
this is fucking brilliant man, absolutely incredible and i‚Äôm not exaggerating at all, this is something a massive company would come up with
---
But you have longer queue times the more you rank up! You get to play with survivors trying to make your life worse AND have a  25 minutes queue! Isn't that a good incentive?
---
Thank you :)
---
They need to get rid of the perks tiers. It takes way too long to get perks in this game.
---
You can get the hang of blink distance and timing for holding the blink, the only difference between newer and older survivors is how they play which you should be able to slowly evolve to understand over time
---
You can just hide in a locker for 4 seconds to not be seen.
---
Your grammar makes my brain cells vomit, your wrong, these changes you have suggested do not need to be implemented. Case closed
---
They're only crutch perks if you dont learn the counterplay.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
You ever just load into a match with 2 rank 18-20s and 1 purple rank survivor then get absolutely demolished by low-medium rank killer with iridescents? That‚Äôs basically my blood hunt rn
---
Resilience and Spine Chill combine to increase window and pallet vaulting speeds by 15%
---
Sprint Burst + Vigil is not half-bad if you know how to abuse it. Fixated can be added.
---
Self-Care + Botany Knowledge + Resilience to speed up the SC self-heal.
---
Botany Knowledge with Med-Kits in general.
---
Pharmacy + Ace In The Hole and/or Botany Knowledge covers your healing needs, stocks you up on Med-Kits and add-ons, and can potentially give you Styptics.
---
Plunderer's Instinct + Ace In The Hole is not exactly an exotic combo, but underrated insofar it doesn't see much use and is pretty viable. Of course, you could just bring good items instead, saving perk slots (although the killer might then be more inclined to also use strong add-ons, or worse).
---
Lithe + Dance With Me + Quick &amp; Quiet + Iron Will for stealth jukes, particularly effective against Nurse and Spirit. A flashlight is a useful addition.
---
Poised + Dark Sense also for stealth jukes. Adrenaline and Sprint Burst are sensible pair-ups.
---
Open-Handed + Bond + Kindred. Windows Of Opportunity and Object Of Obsession are two more (also underrated) perks that benefit from Open-Handed.
---
Second Wind + Autodidact, since the latter's regression on the first two skill checks of a heal gives you more healing progress that counts towards SW's activation. Otherwise We'll Make It is nice with SW, as well.
---
Inner Strength with Head On and Decisive Strike. Quick &amp; Quiet and Small Game are good additions. Or a map that tracks killer belongings, instead of Small Game.
---
Combined with Brutal Strength and Bamboozle, Fire Up is not awful, to speed up both pallet breaks and window vaults as much as possible.
---
Nurse's Calling + Monitor &amp; Abuse.
---
Agitation + Iron Grasp. Underrated insofar that people mostly only use it on specific killers and builds, whereas playing for the basement can win you games as pretty much any killer at any time.
---
Corrupt Intervention + Ruin + Haunted Ground/Thrill Of The Hunt. Intervention and Ruin are the by far best perks to slow down the early game, which is particularly impactful for killers. The problem with using them alongside each other is that survivors are now traversing the map looking for generators that are not blocked, and are therefore more likely to find your Ruin that way. Haunted Ground and Thrill protect your Ruin and give you even more early game pressure.
---
Thrill in general is underrated, and a reasonable pair-up with Ruin in any meta build. It keeps Ruin alive more consistently, provides tracking, and creates a play for the Hexes that in turn can enable you to create a lot of pressure.
---
Infectious Fright + Knock Out is great on most killers, with Fright revealing any survivor that is around and would be able to locate the slugged survivor more easily. Slugging this way is very time-efficient and puts out a lot of pressure.
---
Play With Your Food, The Third Seal and Unnerving Presence are underrated perks, particularly on some killers. PWYF is great on Plague, Wraith, and Leatherface, Third Seal particularly effective on Legion, and Unnerving Presence is the only flat-out counter to Decisive Strike, particularly so on Doctor. A really tryhard Doctor build uses Unnerving and Obedience, gets a survivor into Madness 3 and tunnels them to death, one after the next. "BREAK THEIR IMPURE BODIES". ...Otherwise, Unnerving can also be used well in 3-gen builds, with Overcharge. Trapper benefits from that a lot. In general, doubling the skill check chances is not bad with Ruin. If survivors are repairing generators in your terror radius, Unnerving literally makes Ruin twice as impactful.
---
This is why I would love an unranked perk roulette mode. Everyone in the game gets a random build.
---
Next year. Monitor and abuse may pop up soon
---
Agreed, I‚Äôm curious why they dropped when absolutely nothing gave away they were nearby except TR (which goes through multiple stories), just confused here
---
Toxic survivors ruin the game for everyone.
---
Mori me daddy owo
---
See, I thought I didn't get xp some rounds, but I could never verify it because I always forget what I started out with. So I thought it was all in my head.
---
Sounds like a terrible bug if true.
---
I agree, especially on killer trying to get them on every single killer
---
Holy crap I never laughed so hard on a DBD photoshop 
---
Kill Me!!
---
Trappy boy is too low
---
Yeah but smurfing just makes the process slower and more difficult overall.
---
I think the face camping one would be far too easy to counter but all the other ones are good. For perks I think that the d.s. One is good but the hex: Ruin change isn‚Äôt necessary because ruin as good as it is it doesn‚Äôt need a buff
---
The Pig would need something similar to how Saw sounds. Look up "Saw 3 pig juicer", this one is my go-to suggestion for Pigs music.
---
Edit: https://youtu.be/mKuls95soHY
---
Its fine on both lol. Ive only been playing for a month and a half on survivor and I have pretty much everything i need.
---
I said those are ideas, the game needs some adjustments, and again, maybe not in the way i said
---
Jeez. And I have been wondering why I see nobody with BBQ in higher ranks and suddenly gens pop anyway. Thanks for the tip.
---
Why do people think that killers shouldn't be allowed to play during blood hunt? Just play the game, get your extra points and stop complaining killers won't farm.
---
I can't be in a chase with all four survivors at once. But, I do need to manage all four at once. How do o do that with deerstalker?
---
The problem is that is run in any game, and is rare to not find it, also is not a buff, as it will ve way easier to found
---
Killers to survivors useing infintes, flashlighting at every pallet, doing the first 3 gens in less then 1 minute, bringing instaheals and gens 
---
Killers that dont play spirit, nurse or billy: pic related  
---
Every counterplay for anything on both sides in this game is a cunt move lol; its just a bad game, fun tho without these things
---

---
As a legion main, i second this
---
As a legion main, i second this.
---
I think it‚Äôs 20 sacrifices per mask, I‚Äôm not sure. It is sacrifices for sure though.
---
because theres a higher volume of killer players, its that simple.
---
Yes, shock a lot to hit them with a load of the effects.
---
that is not at all what my post is saying
---
It's always the ones who wear the Scoops top and the regular jeans
---
It's funny how the blood web is so much better yet the grind back then is nothing compared to what we have now.
---
pretty impressive that you can determine tone and how relaxed or worked up someone is from a single word:)
---
Survivor has a few more than killer, and I almost have them all p3. Trying to get my petks on them takes forever. Its slightly frustrating.
---
You know how you hear the heartbeat in the beginning of the clip, and then it goes away for a few seconds, then comes back on? I thought he was walking under me towards the stairs to come get me. So when the beating stopped for a few seconds, I thought I was out of his terror radius and he was at the stairs, then when the radius came back on, I thought he was already on top of the stairs and  about to come down the hallway. So I jumped down to get a head start so that I could get away. I‚Äôm rank 15 but my cousin is rank 8 as of right now, so we were getting mixed up with all sorts of ranks, one of the other survivors was rank 3. The highest rank I‚Äôve ever been is rank 3 on survivor.
---
Haha! I love you, this is the best response
---
1. They just implemented a new bloodweb system so that you can get more perks quickly. 
---
2. I think the devs (arguably wrongly) try balance the game in a way where people aren't supposed to have all top tier perks on all their characters. 
---
3. Especially for survivor, you really don't need the top tier perks. As long as you have 1 of the 3 decent exhaustion perks (DH, BL and Lithe), the rest aren't too important. As killer you do have less freedom with perk viability, and you need at least 1 of Ruin or PGTW. After that you can mostly choose from the other viable perks but obviously they change depending on the killer as they have different play styles. 
---
I get that the grind in this game is extensive. But tbh the grind is what keeps me playing. I always have a new character to prestige.
---
There is a bug, which I saw 4 days ago for the first time, where you escape and just before the running animation of the escape ends you immediately get the loading screen as if the killer suddenly DCed. In the game summary it says you escaped and Piped, but you get no survival points and you lose any item you were carrying. And in the scoreboard it shows that the killer DCed, this I heard it is a bug and he didn't actually DCed. I have lost 5 flashlights this way. 2 of them were utility ones fml
---
that doesn't sound so bad but im console thanks 4 the offer
---
r/emojipolice your gonna have to pay a fine for that one
---
Yeah but it sucks that I only have 3 survivors with every perk, when a new survivor comes out that I like (example Steve) it takes so long to get every perk on them
---
When he was still around the 9 second mark I totally thought he was DCing
---
* Discussions primarily about games similar to Dead by Daylight (e.g. Deathgarden, Identity V, Friday the 13th: The Game, ‚Ä¶) are considered offtopic and better suited for /r/coldwindfarm or their respective subreddits.
---
That's a pretty good example of why matchmaking is broken. You can lose a ton of games as Killer and then get a merciless in one game and rank up.
---
**Love it or hate it, this is the ideal female form**
---
See that's why I usually run noed. At this point it's the only way to stave off the little boys and girls who are having a minecon at the exit gate and won't leave until the very last second. I'm genuinely glad the endgame collapse was added.
---
And a thousand whole BPs
---
Matchmaking really slow since the latest update
---
More than likely not. There isn‚Äôt even a feature to do that with the PC
---
Using an ebony and tunneling isn't playing?
---
Can‚Äôt tell whose worse here?
---
okok, well since you record yourself you have great material to check how you can improve! and if you ever need more ppl to play, hit me up! always looking for more fun ppl to play with!
---
Traps only activate after finishing a gen. Closing hatch doesn‚Äôt activate any gen, instead they‚Äôre blocked off by the entity and egc starts
---
If you play a lot you will still rank up.
---
Also at the moment because of the bloodhunt lots of survivors are two pipping in farming games so even if they're bad they're ranking up.
---
It's happened to me multiple times this weekend. I'm not longer trying to save people after the gens are done.
---
It‚Äôs either 20-25 sacrifices
---
&gt; Steam was down. Known overposted issue.
---
Lithe, Dance with me, Quick and quiet, Iron Will - this is my go to build when I wanna be silent.
---
Devs like nerfing Pig.
---
The original comment was to not make ruin a hex, so technically in this case no that wouldn't counter it.
---
Yeah and closing the hatch as killer creates unwinnable situations for survivors in the end game frequently so let's say survs and killers are equal
---
well it looks like a bit of inexperience! he replied so you can read his response
---
you'll get your pallets when you fix this damn game!
---
thats one of the 2 parts of the nerf lol
---
Hahaha you‚Äôre such an ass hat and I congratulate you sir!!!
---
Hag is a fair a balanced killer and unlike pig which they like to nerf into the ground for no apparent reason....why you gotta nerf pig
---
PS 4 : after I hit a survivor with my m1 as doctor the vertical camera inverted
---
Match making has been broken for months. I remember being instantly match with players everytime I tried to play. Then they started to screw with regions and dedicated severs now look at this mess.
---
Literally same thing can be said about killers
---
That makes a lot more sense, glad you explained!
---
Big unemployed gamer energy from this one

Traps only activate after the first gen is finished, and the timer stops if they're down, hooked, carried, or in a chase.

Funny thing is it *does* work for them, because most survivors around the camping killer‚Äôs rank are potatoes and don‚Äôt get the gens done while the killer is camping. If someone uses Borrowed Time against them, they‚Äôll just hit them again and continue to camp.
---
They finally buffed pig?! They stopped nerfing our girl guys it's a miracle
---
True. As a survivor it really sucks because I keep losing, ranking up, getting better killers, losing again. It just keeps on going.
---
This is what I expect the meta to be, but not what I'm seeing or the other responses indicate. Do people disagree with this? And why?
---
Literally the only 2 killers that don't need ruin
---
imagine thinking you need to be unemployed to be good at a video game. lmfao
---
She turns into leatherface and downs all in one go
---
I didn't know this was a thing until right now. I looked it up, it's 25 sacrifices. It's a little unsettling.
---
Can vault over pallets, can throw hatchets and of course hatchets give you mending status.
---
Past that, she really has nothing. There's a reason she's considered a weaker killer. All you have to do is pump out gens and not cleanse, and she's an M1 killer at all times
---
The only times I've played against a plague and she's succeeded is when my teammates decide to cleanse. Otherwise, she's fairly weak and just as susceptible to being ran around as any other killer. There's a reason you see nurses, billies and spirits at red ranks, and not plagues
---
I don't count it as an ability if it does nothing but get a free first hit. That just makes her a worse wraith
---
What was the point?
---
You should've just deleted your comment.
---
I'm a new player, using Spine Chill/Bond/Balanced Landing (+Prove Thyself because of bp event) and i hate getting tunneled, chased forever and camped ;v;
---
+ 1 for the plot
---
if they doin gens you know i'm gonna break my fingers struggling
---
Then it is a stupid meme
---
Damn that sucks, hopefully it‚Äôll be abit better now when I get past 40. Went through 67 ranks with doctor to get ruin, same with feng and borrowed must of been atleast 65 ranks
---
Coming from a killer main, flashlight saves are NOT toxic
---
Aw man, that would have been so good if it ended with the [We'll Be Right Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d0apIpKMh8) fanfare.
---
Amazing
---
Wow, I‚Äôm ashamed of myself for not thinking of thisüò™üò™
---
We are talking about a few seconds that it takes to complete counter the perk, what is so awful about that? You don't even need to counter BBQ every single time, but if you want to do that, you'll have to accept that you have to invest some time into it.
---
Are exhaustion Perks, med-kits and tool-boxes "atrocious", because they take a few seconds away from the killer?
---
I don‚Äôt think that would be necessary, the only necessity would be someone who wants it in the game installs it, and now they can listen to it. It does not matter if no one else hears it.
---
Survivor players would install it if their own choice to scare themselves more in a game that technically counts as horror
---
Killers would be afraid of themselves sort of not to mention. Possibly more determined to end a chase faster.
---
Well, I don't really camp so most of the time when I see Borrowed Time activate it's when I'm chasing a different survivor and they run to the hook anyway, or when a survivor sneaks up and unhooks within 2 seconds of me hooking them. In most cases I see it's just a get out of jail free card that rewards survivors for unhooking right in front of the killer. I get that it punishes dick killers who camp, but that's only because it punishes all killers and the dick ones happen to be included.
---
yeah its not optimal, but the smooth experience and kind to the eyes is tangible for me
---
*house gen, tiny room*
---
First match of the day and I get tunnelled by a lag switching clown.  9000 points after the double BP.
---
Fuck this game and the people who play it.
---
I am become uninstall.
---
Yes it does. When killers commonly cry about game mechanics it‚Äôs one of the peeks they mention. ‚ÄúWaah waah every game there are flashlights, bodyblocking, DS, BT, Adrenaline‚Äù etc.
---
He is good boy, must be in some kind of pallet
---
Wat
---
I still cant believe hes unironically policing people about their speech. Like, I understand it, sometimes, I do it too, but I keep it in my head, not spew it out and make myself look dumb.
---
Original clown is much thiccer tho
---
&gt;What is tbaggings gameplay purpose, or flashlight clicking, or sound spamming the killer? None of these are griefing supposedly.
---
Getting the killers attention. Being "bait" so your worse teammates can work on gens is obviously an amazing play.
---
 # OH NAW
---
*cries in dwight*
---
I have this problem and every killer I‚Äôve faced has been an Uber sweaty tunneling camper with ebony Mori, it‚Äôs fucking trash
---
It‚Äôs after *any* gen is finished, not just the first one.
---
***cough cough clears throat cough*** good for him ***literally fucking dies***
---
Throw Spirit in there too lol
---
This happened surprisingly often yesterday. I'm a Freddy main and there were a number of games where the only one to die was on their first hook.
---
No I did that as a test 9 hours later to replicate what is being claimed DBD did.  I published a video then made it private a couple seconds later because I wanted to see if people would get notifications.
---
Bruh all these comments really going after a meme
---
If I hit this button and hear fight music from Naruto I'm suing.
---
Using mori is fine. Tunnelling is not.
---
&gt;so you can 100% swear on your life and soul (if you believe in such a thing)
---
Holy fucking shit how much more pompous could you be? Are you actually so god damn ignorant to your own self absorbed arrogance that you really just said that?
---
I stopped running Ruin for this reason. Running ruin doesn't give you any points, and once I got into red ranks people stopped failing it, so it didn't help me find anyone.
---
Not running ruin will essentially guarantee you can't get past silver generator defense against non-potato survivors.
---
"Rank" in DbD isn't a real rank. A rank 6 killer isn't more likely to kill you than a rank 7 killer. It's an arbitrary false reward system that has 0 impact on gameplay. But for some reason matchmaking cares about it. DbD is one of the very few matchmaking systems where the devs decided to come up with their own out of their ass rather than starting from a mathematically correct system meant to make games fair.
---
Use that to your advantage. Stop running ruin, lose pips, get more BP from faster games at lower ranks.
---
In the words of the best licensed survivor 
---
***Hail to the king, baby.***
---
How is saving your friends toxic?
---
Ikr
---
Oh god that sounds like hell. What killers do you play?
---
I was just expecting the mermaid sisters song.
---
Ace is very quiet when injured,almost to the point of T1 or T2 Iron Will,basically the sound equivalent of claudette
---
If it glows, it's because I'm gonna finger your butthole with it. üòà
---
Seriously, haunted grounds is so much fun as killer.
---
Survivor: Uses top tier well-known perk
---
Killer: Plays around it
---
Survivor: *surprised pikachu face*
---
Fun fact: Black people don't always die first in horror movies. I have no idea where that saying started but if you actually look for movies where the black person dies first, you'll see they're in the vast, vast minority.
---
weak? are you sure you play the same Killer as I do?
---
If you want to get really good 360‚Äôs then turn the Sensitivity up to 100, because (no offense) those 360‚Äôs were slow and terrible and would never work on a better killer. But i‚Äôm not hating I‚Äôm just saying kick up the sens and practice :)
---
I thought i heard something about them being looked at after the nurse add ons
---
Edit: using the correct grammar
---
Is mm still sucky for some people? At red ranks it feels a lot more fair. If I‚Äôm by myself I usually get all reds or a purple, unless they‚Äôre swf. It feels like they‚Äôve made it a lot better. Used to when me and my purple rank friend queued, we‚Äôd always get two brown/yellow ranks and a green killer.
---
Borrowed time doesn‚Äôt work on Freddy when there dreaming right?
---
I like playing Hillybilly, Leatherface, Hag, and Wraith mostly and now I play a lot of Demogorgon too, but he wasn't out then.
---
And neither is tunneling if you go for the kill on someone you've already hooked I'd say your just doing the objective. This is also coming from someone who plays both killer and survivor
---
but we don't want a build that works well, we want points.
---
MoM sucks anyway
---
says offensive comment....
---
‚Äúno offence though‚Äù
---
Aw so sad... survivors cause camping and you also have like 50 seconds to do gens before saving so they dont have to struggle
---
Pigs for the slaughter. This is a cursed image
---
Wtf is that build.
---
bruh
---
Aw yis, much better! Cheers for the tag, I love it! ‚ô•
---
You can literally get the gates open before killers get a chance to check them 80% of the time
---
No mate it speaks volumes about you, reading your comment sis like reading the transcript of an 12th century English Aristocrate who doesn't care about the fact that his serfs are dying of Dysentery and Plague lmao, you are so caught up in your actual aristocratic arrogance that you wont even listen when literally everyone tells you that you sound like a stuck up stick in the mud.
---
Honestly? Its mad funny
---
I also use this build for the most part. If I wanna plunder I run Plunders and Ace in the Hole instead of Adrenaline and BT. If I want another fun alternative build (semi strong) build, I run Head on, Quick and Quiet, Inner Strength and DS. Theres nothing more satisfying than mid chase Q&amp;Q into a locker, heal with Inner Strength and Head On the killer. DS is just for anti tunneling, could be replaced with BT
---
Smartface Bubba is arguably my favorite skin.
---
Is true that i explained myself badly but it is too easy to run over all
---
I do to at times but when the survivors are yelling at me constantly or just being rude I dont like to play it as much anymore
---
The only problem with Hag is that she promotes tunneling and proxy camping which are incredibly scummy ways to play and totally unfun for the survivors
---
If you don‚Äôt use her traps to instantly re-down people off of hook or abuse Make Your Choice she‚Äôs just fine
---
It was just a little chest stabbing, no need to overreact
---
How often do you get facecamped? Just curious. Bloodlust is a fai rmechanic for m1 killers who cant end the chase quickly to be able to catch survivor. People who use decisive often get too cocky and start doing gens right in front of the killer without even healing. These perks make a lot of survivors feel too safe. Though you shouldnt feel safe playing as survivor.
---
Im done
---
If only there were Killers with teleportation, high mobility, invisibility, or high mobility invisibility...
---
Resident evil is getting their own version of DBD.
---
i really doubt that many accounts are sitting idle honestly but you may believe what you wish but in my opinion this games player base has a lot of players  48,205 playing 34 min ago now and im sure for the ppl that are idle there is at least 20000 ppl playing lol
---
Really?? I‚Äôve never heard about that ü§î
---
If FOV was an option, everyone would have it turned up to the max. It literally lets you see more. Super small FOVs (like in DbD) can cause window sickness too.
---
Thanks to everyone who has posted the solution
---
Lmao you are such of bad faith
---
I mean you're basically saying you want to do well with a less than optimal build. I don't see how any well designed game could facilitate that.
---
Really? Do you have a link to it, that sounds awesome!
---
ah yes, always about tunneling üòÇ
---
This new bloodweb update is amazing btw
---
Pretty cool idea. I think it‚Äôs more plausible now that we‚Äôve seen them give the demogorgon animations like his vault where he crawls over it instead of stepping.
---
But they probably wouldn‚Äôt do it still.
---
Actually it is Bubbandauge because I see plagues incense burner. Also, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS UGLY ASS SHIT AND WHY DID YOU BRING IT HERE. ^^^/s
---
I don't even mind Dstrike anymore, at least you can play around it, and I happily down the rescuer instead of the escaping dude to avoid Btime. But Flashlights while picking up a downed person are obnoxious, since you are locked into the animation.
---
Cant use adrenaline if the gates dont power. 
---
::taps side of head:: ;)
---
First of all, is English not your first language?? Second, my grandma could Have made better ideas without playing the game, and she's dead. 
---
Third, I don't even understand some of them bc your grammar
---
I was just trying to give you a couple tips but good luck 360‚Äôing killers that actually have brains at 50 Sensitivity
---
What can be done about camping killers and tunneling killers. Like what can I do about it? The only perk I know that helps sometimes is decisive strike. I have been camped and tunneled relentlessly all day today and it is making me want to not play this game anymore. 
---
What can I do? Are there other perks that help? This is especially frustrating during this event.
---
Nice!
---
Meanwhile, The Wraith was still...the Wraith. Terrible time for killers.
---
I respect your right to have your own opinion and take advantage of my right to disagree
---
Google: Resident Evil: Project Resistance
---
I preferred the hit and run tactics of Old Freddy, but I recognize that new Freddy is much better for the game/players sanity.
---
I really want them to try the Hit and Run tactics thing again though. It could be fun if done well.
---
Remember when the game was supposed to be scary? Spirit is feared, Nurse is feared, you should feel like a raging unstoppable psychopath when playing killer, I get why survivors choose those perks, helps them live longer, but you can watch many top tier killer streams and see that even when playing nurse and spirit, or against them, those killers still rarely get 4ks, and when they do, its as if the world has come undone for those survivors and the killers gave their mothers cancer or some jazz. If getting 2 kills while 2 survivors live is supposed to be the balance we are going for, then the ranking system needs to be addressed, the lower tier killers need buffs. Nerfing the top tier killers does not solve the issue, it worsens it. I can understand 4,5 blinks getting removed, I can understand omega blink being removed. Leave prayer beads, its actually scary, something this "horror" game lacks.
---
Dead hard is so overrated. Baitable, covers less distance than any other speed perk, useless against any instadown. Dunno why people still think it's top tier, I guess because others say so.
---
My husband and I cant seem to get a match going at all. Not with the killers or survivors. We've been sitting here while it's been searching for over 30 mins. Is anyone else having this issue? If so, how can we fix it? Thank you in advance
---
Oh not this dumb rhetoric, of course bodyblocking isn't bullying, why  would it be?
---
Can we use this as a DBD version of the callmecarson/Brian meme?
---
How about survivors don't use brand new parts or insta heal medkits instead of always spamming them during a bloodhunt.
---
True, but now we also have a shitton of new perks and killers. New people getting into the game face a huge grind anyway-back then we didn't have so many teachables and characters to level up. Almost all the top tier perks are teachables,often from various different characters. 
---
The game today would not survive with the old system. When I started we had 4 killers. Now there are 17.
---
It means that i suck at english, but atleast i dont succ like you! I will grief your minecraft's terrain
---
its a bad game if its nothing but punishing to everyone; killers camp because eating pallets and getting looped isnt exactly rewarding; BUT sacrificing someone is! 1/4 of your objective done 
---
survivors haveing to hang on a hook because of a misplay only to get camped and being forced to do Literally NOTHING sucks just as much; you cant even tab out or something on your second hook because buttonmashing is very fun to do (not doing anything is bad game disign even without camping)
---
But thats why borrowed time exists! boom unhooked! and the killer got nothing left but one or two injured suvivors; who are they going to chace? the one that allready has been hooked because getting someone closer to being out of game is the best you can do; on the survivor side you are getting tunneled if they chace the one that has been allready hooked; chances are you are going to go down again not getting anything from the game but the nice view you have from the hook;  
---
(allternativly they knock the rescueing survivor who goes back on the hook; it kills the fun for whatever survivor is hooked at the time
---
;  
---
this crap goes on and on, with perks and killer powers; the game is not rewarding for killers 90% of the time in high rank unless you play meta; but makeing it rewarding for the killer through camping \*kills\* the fun for survivors (and killers to imo) at any rank ; if this is in high rank this also has nothing to do with skill
---
# a game that rewards bullshit is a shit game. period.

You can like Legion, It's no skin off my back, but I hate them. It was advertised as disguising or form swapping, we got *run fast with knife*.that and I just don't like how they play in game.
---
Ok this is well done and pretty epic. And to be totally honest contacting BHVR about this might not be a bad idea. They already contacted the actor of Quentin about his face because fans wanted it so maybe if you will be lucky, they will add this as her theme.
---
What the hell? Are you challenging my main‚Äôs absolute GIRTH? Who do you think you are to challenge the god of thicc
---
Ok now one with starting out trying weaker killers like doctor or ghostface and then getting teabagged by four people with the sweaty loadout and then having to switch to your own sweaty spirit
---
Ah yes, my immature humour strikes again. Just like that Hex strikes at my balls with full force, lusting over my screams of pain and anguish, but pleasure at the same time. Just don't break the Hex, it'll hurt like hell if you do
---
That would be horrible. imagine you wanted to play Meg with Any exhaustion perk, but then you can't bc Sprint burst. Also it would be so overpowered.
---
cause its antifun to play against? its not like it takes any skill to stand in front of the hook

Well it is 2019 and you can be whatever you want!

Yes it's understandable but you come off sounding like an utter prick lmfao that's what literally everyone in this thread has said to you
---
Nice Mr.BingBong..
---
The real question is who hooked who in the basement?
---
What am I looking at?
---
I wondered if the blood hunt had something to do with it. Ive been decently ranking up as the killer but it scares me to do that right now. I made it up to rank 10 and I honestly dont want to go any higher. Ive seen purple and red rank survivors and it just isn't fun. At least in this rank, its a constant game of cat amd mouse and a solid game on both sides.
---
This is Insta karma in action
---
*Incoming comments about tbagging being the most emotionally damaging thing people have experienced*
---
I agree that slurs are absolutely unacceptable. I also agree that it was unfortunate that they didn‚Äôt let you farm when you let them farm. However, they are in no way obligated to let you farm. It‚Äôs always a risk for either side, that your opponent won‚Äôt be willing to reciprocate.
---
Mori sounds kinky af

So do you want us to only play billy spirit and nurse or not?

In most ways it's worth it, but the price is steep and for most it is way too much.

I did, good idea, they said worse but for the sake of the sub i dialed it back a bit.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôve mentioned wanting to look at him, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything any time soon. With dedicated servers and the archives scheduled to release in the coming months, along with new chapters, you‚Äôll probably be waiting a while.
---
Should of just left
---
This is why EGC exists
---
I recently started playing Legion just so I could farm BP faster and I fell in love with them. Running around stabbing people is super fun. 
---
 
---
Against good survivors I can't do anything, though. Every now and then I get a game where I'm utterly destroyed (I'm rank 9, so not the best at killer) but most games I get at least 2 kills.  
---
A rework would certainly be appreciated!
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Relax man were not crucifying just saying your toxic and have a bad ego problem for being rank 10 lol
---
I honestly feel like these are good ideas. What also makes sense to unclog killer queue times, is literally cross platform capability. You think, it has to be in the works. Your game is growing rapidly especially with the stranger things DLC. Now would be the perfect time to hit everyone with cross platform.
---
I'm a total sucker for lore and analysing characters, so this is going to be absolutely phenomenal for me
---
Yeah, he's definitively fun at lower ranks. Especially with the red finger addon xD, tho it's kinda hard to aim at a distance lul
---
 Oh now i know where my utility flashlight with ultrarare addons went üëç Thanks for telling!
---
The hit sequel to "I'm not racist, but..."
---
Look at a wall, or make sure you know where the flashlight is and quickly 180 away from them before picking up, its entirely on you as the killer to know how to counter that
---
The fact that a survivor DCing gives the killers points and not the survivors is so funny. 
---
Balancing in this game is obviously not the best, but I don't think anyone expects it to be!
---
i realize this is karma it just suprised me lmao i don‚Äôt read patch notes
---
I started playing about a week or two ago and I had them day one lol
---
Lol no.
---
Reeeeeee
---
Big whoop, this will probably be broken too and anytime you try to go into the archives it will crash your game and lock your PlayStation down forcing you to restart the damn thing... 
---
Sorry just BhVR lately has really pissed me off with the horrible game performance and bugs...
---
To this day i regularly get myers and freddy splinters despite owning them both for almost a year
---
This is why when I intend to farm I still go full-throttle hooking everyone twice before I start allowing them to work gens. I get mine first so I don't have to worry about it and THEN I let the survivors farm.
---
The toxic comments are just - yea. There's no excuse for that behaviour at all.
---
racist comment...
---
im not racist my dads cousins dog is black

Because killer pays 5x as much and everyone wants that sweet BP payout.

---
Really classy.
---
I'd rather come off as a prick than actually being one, like you are based on your actions.
---
Bubba trying to be stealthy even though he's bright yellow and has a chainsaw
---
Fun fact under his mask is actually another slightly smaller mask
---
150% false.
---
I agree with this. I think the exits should be far from each other. Not like across the entire map far, but far enough where Spirits teleport cant go from exit to exit. Hag's teleport cant reach and such. Great ideas but needs to be balanced hehe &lt;3
---
Funny thing I learned yesterday. If a killer closes the hatch AT ANY POINT it triggers the end game collapse. Happened yesterday, a Nea opened the hatch with 2 gens left, I closed it and Bam! EGC.  I was shocked, but the other Nea standing by that didn't get the hatch was all Detective Pikachu.
---
Good times.
---
You'll get used to purple ranks after a while if you have some solid perks. Red ranks are stressful no doubt.
---
I'm not sure you're noticed but I was doing this on purpose because you were being a bit of a jerk to that other guy. Your most likely a nice guy but nobody really appreciates having their grammar critiqued on the Internet. It's much better to keep that to yourself.
---
Looks great! I really dig it.
---
In terms of egc bullshit
---
You thought the timer was stuck so you wanted to prolong the match and bully the killer. Your intentions were clear. You tried to abuse a potential bug and got impaled for it. Get Nae Nae'd
---
fair enough
---
I am not sure if you are bugged or this totem location can randomly spawn bugged. This location is 100% "cleanseable". Definitely a mystery.
---
Oooh thank you so much.
---
This is why I just play normally and just not death hook people if a lot of BP offerings get burned.
---
But there is free points in finding/hitting survivors, why not even try to get some extra points? Is your ego that likely to be damaged?
---
Do you own Laurie as well?
---
as a killer main i dont get it either hit the unhooker and if you feel ballsy use stbfl perk countered and no ds will activate. its not that fucking hard. (then again i do like playing a bit over avarage killers since they are my favorites)
---
New coka cola vs regular coke
---
yes.
---
Where's Billy and Ghostface?
---
I'm sorry. I might have been one of those spirits that ebony'd everyone because I ran into a squadette on coldwind when I first started playing her.
---
I utterly love this! Subbed and can't wait to see your future works! I'm excited for if you ever get around to Ghostyboi.
---
Same here, it also wont tell them when I ready up and only puts one of us in a game, leaving the other person still in the friend lobby
---
I own the dlc with both characters
---
LIQUIIIIIID!
---
Next patch Spine Chill won't work on stealth killers
---
Oh never mind then
---
yeah you're kind of forced to use ruin and maybe bbq, to not loose time :(
---
Myc, ruin, third seal and bbq.
---
Im pretty new, what is farming?
---
I appreciate having my grammar corrected, internet or not. English is not my main language and is common to make mistakes when learning, so I don't see anything wrong by pointing out the difference between "your" and "you're".
---
I bring insta heal just so I can waste more time in a game, keeps the chase going, more points on more hits. And I get to keep going.
---
BBQ and Chilli actually counters Borrowed time:
---
It rewards the killer when they go to gun down another survivor (specially if they are doing gens)
---
The hindered effect is massive, you wouldn't think it either... Well mid chase anyway or just add 5 extra seconds to each level and make the hindered effect 25/30% instead of 15% reduction in speed as that is the thing holding that status effect back, it is not enough to warrant it in most scenarios, ik that goes against what I was saying but for the duration to occur mid chase and happen consistently once the totem is active It seems really good
---
Yeehaw J3ssi3
---
so you're Not a Killer, but rather a calculator? Thats new :D
---
Thats just not true I just put trapped up to 30 with 800k and i was getting perks. Its reallt not that much of a grind man... just play another survivor who you have all the perks on to finish it off.  Run ‚Äòwe are gonna live forever‚Äô and you get 25% extra per unhook
---
Wait no I cant actually, I'm a console pleb lol
---
Once again, your average survivor main here who really doesn't care about killer QOL at all. 
---
Adrenaline is in almost every game, and it's a perk that's way too strong. Nerf noed, remove it I don't care. Do something about Adren. Why do both sides gotta fucking despise each other?
---
And y'know what? DS is arguably STRONGER now.

Killers do not deserve a guaranteed down at this point of this games life cycle. Bloodlust was introduced when actual infinites existed in the game. The developers were struggling to properly fix infinites at the time. There are no infinites and plenty of unsafe pallets and most pallets are now mindgame-able. So if you're being ran indefinitely then you need to look at where you can improve and stop depending on a crutch to make up for your skill to end chases.
---
I can recommend plenty of top tier killer main streamers that'll properly show you how you can end chases without bloodlust. None of them use it and will even state that it needs to go. And no, the time it takes to gain bloodlust doesn't make it fair.
---
Also before you reply crying about super specific maps that actually favor survivors (cough haddonfun) that map is the problem. Fix that map. That's not a reason to make a mechanic affect all other maps.

Freddy cannot teleport to anything in the end game because all the gens are blocked off.

I just got DS for the first time from the shrine on xbox, I have missed the check 3 times in a row because lag spikes seem to happen every time I get picked up.

WGLF is a dead perk, won‚Äôt get any stacks unless your team is boosted

Really glad you liked it mate  !
---
Dear God, we were so busy asking ourselves if we COULD, we didn't stop to think if we SHOULD...
---
Lol I'm laughing that people like u get 0 points. I already stated I get basically the same points so it doesnt hurt me at all.
---
I think this works, the beacon thing, the exposed effect needs to be longer if he can only have a small number as 10 seconds goes by very quick and if you aren't directly next to them when it happens it is pointless, Iron Maiden has this exact problem and hence is underused, fabulous concept, Mind Games if the most solid perk there if the red stain is not visible as that let's the survivors know what's up, all I'll say is I need more info! I'd love to hear the survivor backstory and perk ideas, but this is a great first concept.. well done my man.

Survivors at the campfire: *Unique things that coincide with their personality*
---
Survivors in a lobby: *Synchronised Bigfoot pose*
---
Yes
---
Been having fun during the blood hunt despite really long queues. I pretty much let everyone go and try to burn an anniversary cake each game.
---
The one thing that has made me smile tho was a game I just had. This Dwight knew i wasn't going to kill them so he kept dropping my dream pallets over and over and it capped my deviousness lol.
---
Found the dcer who leaves when they're found esrly
---
Barely I've gotten -15 for proximity and still got iridescent on whichever badge that is a few times, camping is generally a bad strategy though so good killers only do it in certain situations, smart survivors easily punish campers.
---
It's a really poor idea to hook dive vs any killer, they'll just get a second down lol. If LF, you're a complete idiot.
---
It only gets more tilting when they sprintburst away after.
---
It's great that you can appreciate that. But most others don't. I know you're trying to be nice but it comes off as you think you're smarter than everyone.
---
Don't hide just show em your ass at the pallet
---
Thanks
---
Mate dont get salty that your post did terrible quite frankly just piss off
---
Agreed, but they could cross platform consoles at least. I'm on XBox and it's a minimum 15-20 min wait time for killer. I'm basically becoming a survivor main strictly because I can actually play the game and not just constantly wait
---
I don't dc that shit is for babies. I swear it's like ya'll didnt read the post. I said that it's funny that survivors will get 0 points for this behavior. I still get my points why would I be mad
---
How is body blocking playing like a douche....? So you‚Äôre telling me if my friend will wiggle out with a body block, I‚Äôm just supposed to not do it because that would be unfair to you? Lmao. Some of y‚Äôall are such idiots I swear. And on the same subject, DS and BT are literally anti tunneling perks now. If anyone thinks it‚Äôs toxic then they‚Äôre the toxic ones.
---
How can you main a no map pressure killer? That's the real question
---
Water off a ducks ass bro. No point getting too hung up about it. Its annoying and they will always justify their shit. Good news is if you can see stupid shit coming you can just leave the results screen and ignore the bullshit.
---
This happened twice to me. Once when I was right next to hatch. That‚Äôs 10k bloodpoints I was robbed of?? This game is a mess right now, when there‚Äôs a heap of new people being introduced. How do the devs manage to fuck things up bigger each time.
---
Inner Strength is very, very strong. And honestly totems are so common even with 5.
---
How is it original if you took it from me? Good work Buddy. It's just amazing that you have to repost and take other people's memes because you aren't funny yourself and take full credit. Howbout you piss off and go sell some more porn hub accounts.

---
Take the common offerings and green styptic agent and never let them go.... i beg of you

---
As killer, the lower level skill ~14-20 is less fun then 1-7 are generally players who hate you for existing as a killer and want you to know it 8-13 now that's some good matchmaking.
---
Why were you acting like that? Legit question.
---
Removed salty after game chat
---
This would result in a balanced killer, considering that Legion is useless
---
Same 
---
When I play killer normally, I feel like if i dont sweat my balls off, then I wont get any more than 1 kill at most
---
When I play survivor normally, I feel like I am the only one who knows how to chase a killer around for more than 10 seconds
---
There was 1 point where I had enough. In a length of 10 games, I encountered 8 organized, toxic swf groups as killer (usually 2 red ranks , a purple rank, and a rank 19 or something like that). In the same length of games as survivor, I had about 5 or 6 DCs at the start of the match.
---
Luckily this is gone, but it really sucks when playing the game on either side isnt fun.
---
wow, that actually Sounds pretty funny. would Love to see that
---
lmao that‚Äôs cool, so there‚Äôs no punishment for tunneling, hm slugging face camping but there is for tbagging at the end of the game cool
---
Literally 75% of DS hits aren't even on a tunnelling killer. Killers are forced to run perks too?
---
We basically NEED ruin.
---
I personally don't mind if DBD adds battle pass unless it is like fortnite and they charge 30 dollars every month lol
---
At rank reset they could offer blood points or iridescent shards based on rank (or even auric shards so that players can get cosmetics). Easy solution. Also, since steam keeps global track of achievements, we know that rank 5, rank 1 killer is significantly more difficult that the survivor counterpart. Ergo, purple/red rank killers could get even more rank incentive than purple/red rank survivors.
---
Yeah I am experiencing the same thing. Super frustrating
---
aw no rip :(
---
Lmao
---
A billy using bbq? It‚Äôs a bold strategy cotton
---
Because ya'll worried about gens instead of the extra 1000-5000 bloodpoints you couldve got from doing bones. So you'll be fine.
---
1. borrowed time absolutely counters face camping as it gives the person being face camped a chance to fucking live you moron. what are people supposed to do at end game with no gens to do and the killer is staring at the hooked player inches from their face? And why should face camping be encouraged to "just let it happen"? I know the point you're making of doing gens, that should be the go to against a bubba because his multi-hit chainsaw, but I would 100% rather attempt to bring a player back in to the game so they can at least *try to have some fun* than let their whole match be staring at a hook while they just spam spacebar or mousewheel. 
---
2. instead of mind gaming, understanding loops, when to break a pallet, or when to drop a chase killers will just hold w and brainlessly follow you until they're bloodlust 3 and catch you because they're so fast when they already have a speed advantage by default excluding killers like huntress and they have range mechanics for that anyway.
---
3. I know you're probably a baby player/killer based off these stupid ass opinions you just posted, but once upon a time healing speed didn't feel like complete ass and that's not even considering sloppy butcher or thanatiphobia. dogshit killers cried and cried until healing speed was nerfed to the ground as to what is today and it now feels awful. So now instead of healing someone, people will just rock adrenaline and do gens to avoid that terrible healing speed and in return moron killers who cried about healing speed being too fast are now complaining about "genwushing survivors wahhhh wahhhh" when it's their own dumbass fault for complaining because people will just do gens now.
---
4. DS absolutely counters tunneling, 60 seconds after a hook someone gets ONE chance to get away with a measly 5 second stun and you think that's broken? If you get hit by DS and you're still going after other survivors, you have terrible time management and even if you do get hit by it it's not the end of the fucking world you moron you can just blood lust that person and insta-win regardless. this will 100% be my last reply to some dipshit ass player who has this train of logic.
---
&gt; whole killer games ruined by swf meta groups
---
5. why do terribad killers like yourself pretend that SWF are seal team six cordinated and that's why they lost? saying the dumbest shit like "SWF is an exploit!!!" when clearly killers who are half way decent never complain or have a problem handling any SWF group. have you ever watched a half way decent killer on twitch play or better yet a *good* one? they know what mistakes are being made, they know when to drop a chase, they know how to 3-gen strat survivors, they know how to utilize certain killers advantages mechanics, they know how and where to push survivors in to dead-zones but all these moron reddit killer mains just want to play on auto-pilot with double digit IQ and never lose no matter how bad they play. It's insane the amount of scapegoating that happens when killers lose instead of just admitting they played bad and made mistakes and blame it on "SWF" when in reality you chased one person for 4 gens, tunneled because you got mad with every pallet stun, chased them in to a good looping area, finally got them at the fifth gen being popped with blood lust 3, face camped them because you're so butthurt they ran you, then someone with borrowed time was able to get him off the unhook and the other survivors took protection hits so they could all escape and you got a 0K and left instantly because you're salty trash. Did I hit somewhere close to home? (': get the fuck out of here.
---
Have at it lol. I can't stand it. With how long the queues have been for killer I have been going survivor just to actually manage to get games in since the stranger things dlc.
---
He‚Äôs fun to play if the survivors aren‚Äôt that good but if you find a good team then he can be frustrating to play. SWFs are the same because they spread around the map making his power nearly useless.
---
It‚Äôs a long running joke with the Dbd community
---
How was I supposed to do totems when he's chasing me all game?
---
Especially the ones that camp. ‚ÄúOh lower rank? Cool hope I get some more baby survivors.‚Äù
---
SaltyüòÇ Move yourself
---
Jealous
---
Bbq and chili? Daring today, arent we?
---
Working together so that everyone gets the maximum amount of points. As you can see it doesnt always work out. Even as survivor too so be careful.
---
Yes, because the survivor probably made a horrible mistake and deserves to be punished, not given a free escape.

Well designed games allow for a variety of play styles and options to succeed.

Games that get stuck into the same 3-4 things being used aren't well designed, either because those things are too strong or everything else is too weak.
---
It literally takes 27 seconds to finish a gen with 4 people, I love the survivor mains downvoting me.
---
DS is still OP, that's just it. It is arguably STRONGER than before.
---
People who dc are salty in the comments
---
Please give it to BHVR \* \_\_\_\_ \* I love this so much
---
They broke match making hard, 6 months ago there was never a wait for kills or survivors.
---
Well, that's 4 people on one gen, very inefficient and you can put a stop to it.
---
 honestly it's better than what we had. Hatch faceoffs were way worse. It also makes sense in that the survs already lost the game so it's second lucky roll. 
---
It bites, but also odly enough I found 'asking' the killer to open the gate for me works like 30% of the time, which is better than my 10% of try-harding the gate.
---
I don't really farm, I've been mostly playing like normal. I've only used one mori because 3 people were in my lobby with toolboxes. However I have been using my bloody party streamers as much as I can but I don't have many.
---
As far as I know it pulls it‚Äôs information directly from Steam, so no, they shouldn‚Äôt see you online.
---
It stacks 25% for every unhook? Usually get 2/3 unhooks in a normal game anyway.
---
I made many references, how much did you count? hehe
---
I shouldn't be getting fucked mid chase bc of my teammates mistakes. If it's not my fault I shouldn't bear the punishment for it. It's his fault for chasing the one Nea for 5 gens, not mine for playing soloq with teammates who don't do totems.
---
Ok. So you are telling me that if I slug people because I want to play around DS, I am just not supposed to do so? That I am "toxic"?
---
Survivors do this all the time, they whine and whine about legitimate plays because it is "unfair" to them, and then when killers complain about something, suddenly it¬¥s just "game mechanics" and "legit items". 
---
You do you buddy. Play however you want, just don¬¥t be surprised when people do annoying shit to you if you do annoying shit to them.
---
I don't get why they just went completely overkill on Legion. The 4 second stun time is ridiculous. Hell, Nurse with 5 BLINKS has the same stun time as Legion, and you can't even down people with Legion's power! The only way Legion can be good is if they shorten the stun to 2 or 3 seconds, any other changes to Feral Frenzy are unnecessary.
---
Same thing has happened to me but not with the same killer. I‚Äôve been getting the shape, the pig, and the nightmare splinters even though those were the first 3 killers I bought
---
that.. may be true; ive only got about 300h of game time atm and since double bp  ive been playing nonstop to get bubba and hag leveld for the teachables; reached red rank in both survivor and killer but i dont care for ranks
---
still my arguments stays; the game doesnt just needs tweaking to dicourage certain playstyles (just a rating panalty is not enough; as well as the make a perk to patch it mentality, as meta perks arent worth giving up for a perk that fixes gameplay) but rather base-gameplay changes; and the "meta" has been the way it is for a bit too long (up until now ive only played it once in a while up to like 100 h playtime, starting about a year ago)
---
i dont camp either, as i also like chases and mindgames but at times it gets really frustating, as there is little mindgames in chaseing survivors that runs from pallet to window to pallet flashlighting everytime you break one; the really fast gen times without ruin makes the game just really stressfull for killers (once again being forced to play with meta perks)
---
Oink!
---
Well... That happened.
---
Yeah I'm salty? Because some sub human garbage has to leech to be noticed lol. Enjoy being a bottom feeder, brother.
---
This is really well thought out. I also love how you took the effort to make sketches for all addons and perks
---
New meme format
---
P3‚Äôd my spirit with the blood hunt and as I was using up my puddings, I decided to tack on Stridor. That perk is incredible on spirit.
---
Survivors should be greedy with gens even without spine chill.
---
Yeah but people I play with don‚Äôt get hooked often and usually I‚Äôm not the one saving, and WGLF gives no IG advantage compared to BBQ
---
I‚Äôm hoping this last set of levels is kind to me so I can finally run the perks I want together.
---
I absolutely loved old Freddy.  I mained him through rank 1 and devised a playstyle that really made great use of his kit and kept the survivors constantly guessing as to what my true target or intention was at any given time.  I used him to disrupt and the info you had at all times was invaluable.  I truly do miss him but I am coming around on the rework.  He's still a top go-to killer in my rotation I just had to relearn him from scratch because my old playstyle was built around his aura reading.  He's objectively stronger for the average player now so I understand why they reworked him.  But if you knew how to maximize his old kit god damn could you make some things happen.  I loved him against swf because they never showed any respect to him and would never see it coming when you took control of the game with him.
---
You can make the comic the other way around with killer.
---
Because it effectively heals the survivor for one health state. If someone injured has BT and unhooks someone else, you‚Äôre in a pretty bad spot. The unhooked survivor will try to take a hit, preventing you from killing the other guy. If you try to go after the unhooked survivor (because he stole your free hit), you‚Äôll eat a DS. Also, it‚Äôs pretty goofy seeing the unhooked survivor run up to you and body block.
---
Overconfidence vs Depression.
---
Sounds more of a you problem than a me problem. You got unlucky. Cant be mad at the perk. More or less the teammates.
---
Edit: you'll be fine
---
Thanat? Are you joking? That perk adds 13 secs to a gen and ONLY if all 4 stay injured. It's an absolute joke unless Plague with Dying Light.
---
bubba want da chili
---
Cause he‚Äôs fun, enough said
---
There should be one gen on the map that takes 10 minutes to complete and is a single person generator /s
---
Julie and Susie also lol
---
Someone had to say it
---
This literally happend to me 10 minutes ago and im still trying to get bbq on the demogorgon
---
Wow. I love the effort put into this. I must say though, the movement speed addons would get abused and stacked if they were in the game. And we would end up with something closer to a 120% MS killer I think
---
Make a killer version :)
---
We're basically forced to use 1-2 slowdown perks or get punched by gens.
---
You summed up everything perfectly. When you play killer as ‚Äú4K 5 gens left or I lost‚Äù then no wonder it seems like a chore and the game seems unbalanced. Their expectations are whats unbalanced. 
---
Im trying to force myself to be a killer main too for the bloodhunt because I know it‚Äôd be a lot less stressful and just have a better experience in general but its so boring. 
---
This community is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen for sure.
---
If he didn't have Noed I'd have made it out the exit gate. Bc he had Noed, I died and my rank 17-20 teammates made it out. 
---
They didn't do something and I got punished for it. THAT isn't fair. They need to integrate voice comms into soloq or nerf these pubstomp perks like NOED. I'm happy with either
---
I seriously didnt know there were 17 killers since am a survivor main i legit never thought about it.
---
I believe that was 3 survivors I accounted for.  Which given the expectation for each game is supposedly 2 live and 2 die (even though we all know it's mostly 4-0, 0-4 or 3-1 most of the time) is not unreasonable to use as a hypothetical. Even then if you remove the guy going to the gen if the survivor being chased has adrenaline that basically guarantees that at least 1 of you are getting out. And if it also happens that the 1 that doesn't get hooked of the 2 isn't dead then yes borrowed time essentially guarantees that you both get out provided the one doing the rescuing isn't a total idiot
---
The cannipig
---
Jokes on him I already ate it.
---
"That wasn't very pizza time of you."
---
Is he wrong tho
---
Lightborn is actually truly wacky.
---
Makes flashing take 5 seconds lol. They defo gave it a mega buff.
---
Rofl dude no. With 4 stacks of WGLF the average survivor payout is MAYBE 20k tops. The average killer payout with BBQ is 60k+
---
If survivors made more then more people would play them and your argument about waiting becomes completely moot.
---
Exactly.  There should be exclusive cosmetics every season.  It doesn't have to be "pay for a battle pass" type of thing, but a similar system.  "Hit rank 10, get 100,000 bp.  Hit rank 4, get 200,00 bp.  Hit rank 1, get 500,000 bp."  Make certain add ons/items more rare.  Then, I'd make harder and worthwhile for more skilled players.  Once in the red ranks, deactivate items and add ons.  Hit rank 1, and earn 1 exclusive cosmetic that cannot be purchased, and/or, the option to earn 1-3 bloody outfits for a survivor/killer you otherwise dont want to prestige.
---
The latter would teach killers how to actually play killer, without crutch add ons.  Also forces more interesting game play from survivors without relying on keys, instaheals, etc.
---
1. The survivor toxicity is nothing to do with Bloodpoint gains. It's partly because the survivors are teamed up against 1 killer, meaning a mob mentality can occur, partly because the survivors have no way to fight the killer in game, so they get back at the killer with actions/words that are intended to mock and partly (mostly) because players are not forced to play both sides. You can be a survivor main or a killer main, which means your viewpoint can be limited to one side of the game. You don't care about if the other side is having fun or not. The toxicity is also largely caused by the devs reluctance to do anything to reduce it. They know a large percentage of the playerbase like being toxic and they don't want to push those players away by punishing them. It's why we see no punishment for disconnecting even though it's probably the worst thing about the game right now (though thankfully not as bad as when all those babies were disconnecting against legion).
---
2. Survivors shouldn't get as many bloodpoints as killers. Survivors get to keep their items &amp; add ons if they survive, meaning they don't need to gain as many bloodpoints from each game because they have the potential to save a massive amount of bloodpoints just by surviving and keeping the value of their items. Yes, this makes levelling up slower for survivors, but survivors have shorter queue times meaning they can get into games faster.
---
Apologies for the lengthy post.
---
How the fuck did I deserve to get slapped with Noed? 
---
I ran the bitch for 5 gens. Didn't get hit once. Only got hit bc he got tier 3 Bloodlust and was running Noed. That's not my fault, I didn't deserve to get hit with that. I deserved to escape since I was clearly outplaying him. 
---
Not every single time does a killer down someone, is it bc the Survivior deserved it.
---
Unfortunately Slenderman is owned by a group who obtained the rights from the original owner. It's possible but farfetched.
---
that's why I kill myself on hook against mori's on double bloodpoints because 9/10 I just get insta moried off a hook anyway and it's a complete waste of my time
---
Usually get 1-2 every reset, wish they would add rewards for getting to low ranks cause all I get rewarded with rn is the same killer every match lol
---
I thought at conventions you couldn‚Äôt bring anything that looked like a weapon.
---
Both useless after a while ;)
---
By your logic old DS isnt a crutch bc the Survivior can still die and the killer can still pip. 
---
It gave him something he didn't deserve. It took him T3 Bloodlust and Noed to finally hit me. He didn't deserve that kill.
---
After this stealth buff for killers, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs more then enough for balance. Even now he‚Äôs pretty balanced, and I‚Äôm a GF main
---
Well the survivors earn adrenaline.killers  don‚Äôt earn NOED. At the end of the day both perks are annoying but both perks have counters.
---
Send a ticket to behaviour, good chance you'll get your bloodpoints back.
---
Stop playing this game. Tbagging with perks like that.
---
I did my job keeping him distracted for my team so they could do gens uninterrupted. I did the one job where Adrenaline is a 100% earned perk.
---
This is Fantastic! Would love one for each killer!
---
Then implement voice comms into soloq.
---
doc is the only killer i don't have
---
Well even thinking about it what would the battle pass even include? Skins that are already in the game? New taunts? It does sound unnecessary. I was never disagreeing with you, I was just saying that Fortnite didn't invent it, and if BHVR did end up doing it, it would be there own version that wasn't dumb
---
This has meme potential
---
I have to disagree.
---
One is the fucking money currency of the game that allow you to make your characters progress while the other is one of the best Hero in the game with some of the best Team based feats while still being balanced and fun to play.
---
Oh I know people are playing killer more, it‚Äôs the only time we have more killers playing on PS4 is during a double blood point weekend. The rest of the time, it‚Äôs insta lobby‚Äôs for killer and 10-15min wait on survivor lobby‚Äôs.

I feel like this is EXACTLY what should happen if you're tbagging like a dipshit at the escape gate. As soon as the gate is opened and everyone's safe, if you don't leave, the entity gets you. Really wish this wasn't a bug. Anyways, glad this shit happened to you.

Calm spirit should work against killer instinct.  Not enough screaming going on and a minor additional use would be nifty

Ye the killer brings the mori so they can end the survivors faster, have a higher chance of 4k'ing etc.

I could have sworn this game was on Unreal engine

It's not. You did no gens. And get IT mid chase? Sucks for the killer not op.
---
Killer gets genrushed and 4 adrenelines and nobody does Bones. UNEARNED NOED NEEDS NERF. 
---
Both are BS
---
I wasted 1 mill on myera just to get bbq tier 3 man! All i got was Monstrous Shrine and other useless shit man
---
Did you not see the "ran him for 5 gens" part? I could not go and do "bones" you dolt. I was getting chased All fucking game
---
Chased injured survivor for a few minutes only for them to get insta healed by Adrenaline and escape. Tell me again how Adrenaline isn't a crutch perk?
---
VenomouzElite  u bought this game and the first dlc u bought was leatherface?
---
It's to make the killer guess who has obsession perks, usually DS. I never run obsession perks and have been made obsession lots of times without the killer running obsession perks. Without this the killer would always know who was likely running DS or not.
---
A survivor running an obsession perk only increase their chance of being the obsession it doesn't always make it so.
---
That seems to happen to me on the killer side as well. 1 second I'm getting 4ks full irridescent rating in every category double pipping 10+ matches in a row. Then I hit rank 12 and it goes from this games too easy to "why are half these people under rank 5" and suddenly I've been looped and juked in ways I've only seen in PC tournaments (exaggeration, but still) and left in a confused heap back in rank 13, then another 4k double pip, then immediate wall of seal team six survivors. Don't know why it's tripping me up so much
---
I legit screamed at the top of my lungs yesterday while in SWF and discord with my friend.
---
I was on a gen and I couldn't really see that well because of shit blocking my view really close to me. So when a red survivor runs up to the gen, I don't realize it's Pig (red coat) until she's 2 feet from the gen. I yell "OH SHIT" at the top of my lungs, and it scares my red rank friend across the map so badly that he jumps both irl and in-game, which in turn makes the nearby David panic and run away lol.
---
Took me like 2 minutes for my heart rate to come back down afterwards lol.
---
For MyC to activate, you have to be within a certain range of the hooked survivor. 32m if I remember. Were you near the hook when this happened?
---
No I got a few others just haven't had much time to play
---
What do you think Make Your Choice does?
---
Genrushing is such an arbitrary statement. At this point a gen getting done before everyone is on death hook is genrushing anymore. 
---
I didn't do gens bc I couldn't. I did the hardest job of being Survivior, I ran the killer ALL GAME without getting hit once. I was a jizz blast from the exit gate, if he didn't get T3 Bloodlust and didn't have Noed I'd have escaped.
---
150% this. Had a Billy do this exact thing to me while I was still spinning.
---
Well also you seem to be a LF player, godspeed soldier. Lmao.
---
I'm not the other team. I play both sides equally and enjoy both equally. Survivors have shorter queue times because the ideal playerbase would be 80% survivor and 20% killer, but in reality it's more like 60% survivor, 40% killer.
---
Basic but solid, personally I'd swap fury out for ruin and monitor for nurses but that's just me
---
You fucking killed him dude
---
1. Bc they made it to endgame. 
---
2. They have to work for it. That Survivior kept you distracted while the others did gens. They earned it by helping their team.
---
So toxic that even the entity got NOED
---
And hillbillys chainsaw
---
Opened a notification and it spazzed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
MYC only works against a rescuer and only pops if you‚Äôre not near the hook. Or are you saying it didn‚Äôt work all game?
---
Monitor isn't that good on Billy, since the survivors are able to hear your chainsaw getting close to them. I would run Pop Goes the Weasel or Ruin instead, for generator control. ;)
---
Literally every part of this image makes me deeply suicidal
---
A lot of people want it to be more of a shape shifter that can turn itself into survivors.
---
But if the killer lets the hatch stay open for 30 seconds it‚Äôll close by itself and the rest still have to do the gens... so they‚Äôre fucked if that‚Äôs the case
---
Ngl I would piss my pants at the chase music
---
at this point I only play legion for the aesthetic of a edgy teenager thier power is objectively terrible and does nothing to help you besides a first free hit and a 4 second stun
---
Yeah, so maybe fix the BP and people will be more inclined to play survivor. Jesus how hard is this to understand? I'd play both equally if payout was even.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that? his perks are good.
---
I bet you buy every dlc that comes out
---
yeah it‚Äôs 100% on the unreal engine LMAO
---
Happening to me as well but on pc
---
I've actually seen no moris at all during the blood hunt.
---
I have had quite a few tunneling killers and really awful teammates though.
---
Both NOED and Adrenaline reward each side for making it to end game and you don‚Äôt have to work for it at all, it‚Äôs given to you just for equipping it. Both perks are crutches but Adrenaline is arguably worse since you can‚Äôt counter it (apart from plagues puke)
---
Not going to do that either.
---
Yup.
---
Congrats since you posted this it will never happen again
---
Fuck oathbreaker
---

---
Survivor op please nerf
---
you can,it's just way quieter compared to others,like david for instance
---
OMG. I love that you are doing this. You are amazing!
---
&gt;Killers do not deserve a guaranteed down at this point of this games life cycle
---
I read your whole comment but I should have stopped reading after the first sentence. The game is incredibly survivor sided for all but 3 killers right now. This screams of an entitled survivor player. Most people dont play at the skill level of top tier killer mains and never will, hence why they are top tier. balancing around them for a game with literally zero competitive scene is absolutely braindead.
---
Jeff...lmao.
---
I'm seeing organized mass DC is becoming popular, you guys get this too? Enter a lobby, everyone talks about DC'ing if killer doesn't want to farm?
---
Had this happen against a Freddy. I was laughing so hard that i forgot to struggle and died
---
Uhh what? 
---
Surviviors have to work for Adrenaline.
---
We found a CONDUCTOR OF THE POOP TRAIN.
---
I really hope samination doesn‚Äôt suck this joke dry like he did with killer nea and baby trapper
---
Everyone talking about the characters but I'm just thinking the map would be awesome
---
Is it the name of one of Black Prior's feat but in English ? 'Cause I have the french version so I can't tell.
---
Sup Meg
---
Well... something needs to give. Bc bad killers like this don't deserve any kills no matter how scummy they try to play.
---
People still run it a lot, especially on the Plague and on Legion
---
What‚Äôs good
---
I can definitely see how the BBQ aura would be amazing on the spirit. I main Hag so the aura reading definitely isn‚Äôt great-especially considering how slow she is. Plus I forget to look because I usually place a trap after I hook.
---
Have you tried not immediately sprinting as the game starts?
---
Shouldn't it be like this was the last gen, you tried so hard to get it done under the killer's nose, and you immediately found out they have NOED?
---
I like this one more! Having to not look at Slenderman or else you get the iconic effect his games have is really cool, like kinda the opposite of Ghostface. I have one question though, what will the other survivors see when he Memento Mories somone else?
---
Myers in general tends to be more ‚Äúclean‚Äù in his movies; he‚Äôll splash blood, but not on himself
---
If the ratio of 4 to 1 is off, probably because killer pays more BP, then the wait times will be longer. I wonder what could fix this? Oh right, better survivor BP.
---
Survivors shouldn't get as many bloodpoints as killers. Survivors get to keep their items &amp; add ons if they survive, meaning they don't need to gain as many bloodpoints from each game because they have the potential to save a massive amount of bloodpoints just by surviving and keeping the value of their items.
---
Both killers and survivors have an objective to complete. If you get hit with NOED then you didn‚Äôt cleanse enough totems. Your reward for completing gens is getting the exit gates active.
---
Newish player here, I have several purple and pink items (map, keys, kits and boxes) Should I just use or save them? I feel kind of scared taking a pink/purple and just losing it immediately.
---
yes he is the second worst killer after legion 
---
lmao
---
Leatherface is usually the first dlc people buy, as he has the single most crucial perk in the game
---
all of his perks are good?? it‚Äôs only his chainsaw that‚Äôs easily countered but then again add-ons exist...
---
Like you said rank 15-18... that's not ranking up, that's barely playing... Go up to rank 1 and enjoy a 25 minutes queue and see how much you'll want to derank.
---
It's literally a "ok, you win I guess" card for survivors after a certain point in the game. You are forced to just walk along the unhooked person unable to do anything while they walk freely through the exit gates because of a perk they didn't even bring, so they had to sacrifice nothing for that, which feels even more insulting. Same thing with decisive, can't pick the survivor back up for a full fucking minute and you just sit there watching a guy literally crawl to their victory with no complications.
---
If those perks didn't activate or had their effects/durations severely nerfed while the exit gates were powered, I wouldn't have a problem with them.
---
The way the ranking system works really hurts me as I'm desperately trying to get all achievments and getting to rank 1 survivor is pretty much impossible with the current pip system
---
I also hate the pip system as it artificially slows you down instead of making it natural.
---
The challenge of ranking up shouldn't come from moving the pip thresholds, it should come from more skilled oponents.
---
Not to mention that rank doesn't represent skill, but instead represents time spent on the game in the past month. I've been playing this game for almost a year and I was rank 10 while playing with a guy who only had the game 2 weeks and was rank 3
---
Those people don't know the numbers on the perk I'd reckon, just the percentage.
---
Eh not as viable because people hide auras in lockers and behind gens when people go down a lot now. At least my SWF does. Just in case.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Wait what is exactly the archives? I‚Äôm not quite in the loop
---
Legion, Demo, and Hag are also great for farming deviousness if you can play them decently
---
I AM Just Just saying if Noed has to be nerfed it's sister adrenelines gets one to.  Both are crutches
---
Insta down killer with noed, amazing!
---
Killers to survs who are doing gens ASAP even with downs and pressure: That's a cunt move.
---
It's a success then  !  Glad you enjoyed &lt;3
---
So that‚Äôs what goes through people heads when I chase them
---
Make your voice heard so they notice it  !  Glad you like it  : D
---
I think you would almost have to have Urban Evasion for this. If you did this to me I would probably laugh my ass off and give you hatch or let you escape at the end. Too funny.
---
Thank you mate &lt;3
---
&gt; We basically NEED ruin.
---
you don't, what you actually NEED is the 15 second chase rule and pressure on gens. but when you don't want to listen me and instead tunnel one survivor for 180 seconds and lose 2.5+ gens maybe you'll reconsider when your gamble perk gets found and now you're suddenly forced to actually pressure gens without it when you could've used a perk that would've lasted you out the whole duration of the game from the get-go instead of taking a 20% gamble.
---
you just dont know how to play against an Spirit, watch some videos or streams of course ppl who now how to play and you will learn a lot. you are just trying to face the same technique against all killers and that shouldnt be the case.
---
That‚Äôs too specific üòÇ
---
Couldve just hid in the locker
---
RIP god pallet. I get that it‚Äôs a nurse, but still RIP. Good jukes though
---
Hahaa I can feel your excitement  !  Glad you enjoyed mate  : D
---
I don't tunnel a surv for 3 minutes ever, that'd a bad idea. But a 15 second chase? Really? How frequently does that happen unless you're a Nurse Spirit or Billy.
---
ThNk u bro
---
While it can be used at other times, it's not always gonna get a response. Its mostly going to mess up their Lunge if they aren't animation locked. Otherwise it might provoke them? It can kill Hag traps... At the cost of telling the Hag you set off a trap...
---
That's something I'm planning to do  !  I wasnt expecting so much positive reaction, thats incredible
---
They have one useful effect tho. With Sloppy and 4 people injured (which isn't hard on Legion) it reduces healing speed by 41%, so those who heal will have a hard time, especially those who think Self Care is a good perk
---
Rank 12 right now.
---
I understand that if there are no Obsession perks on the survivors' side then it is completely random 25% chance and that running an Obsession perk as a survivor, increases their chances a bit. 
---
I don't think it should have been me especially since there was two people with Obsession perks. 
---
In all of my time playing this game, it has never skipped over people with Obsession perks to choose the survivor with none as the Obsession.
---
It's weird, and with all the problems with this patch I wouldn't be surprised if it is a bug.
---
Omg omg omg omg omg a pallet quickkkkk
---
same thing over here on xbox one
---
auto-aim makes you swing early? it just makes me miss when they run into me, it has never legit made me go into swing animation on it‚Äôs own.
---
Okay but I think good survivors will realize "oh hey we probably shouldn't heal" and slam gens as you chase.
---
So you're basically useless the whole match.
---
Pleasure sure  !  If you enjoy it thats huge to me !
---
15 second chase rule is: 
---
if you don't get a safe pallet dropped or a hit on a survivor in 15 seconds you're already wasting too much time and need to drop the chase.
---
Longer games during Bp events as long as it's constant action in both sides mean higher overall points. Especially with streamers.
---
She‚Äôs also the slowest, but running with an additional blink and using them accurately she is really powerful
---
When I go to hit the survivor unhooking, but autoaims at the hooked survivor even though I'm behind the survivor unhooking.
---
And the problem wasn't how fast the game would be found, is that it would never complete the loading process once one was found. Just error after error after infinite loading screen.
---
I am saying I hold attack button to lunge, auto aim decides I'm gonna hit (well before the full lunge is over) and forces me to swing earlier than it should have. Had it just let me do the lunge I would have hit
---
Adrenelines has to go to then.
---
Fair trades my Guy.
---
Several things to work on to improve so you can begin looping killers for multiple gens (god damn is this game so much more fun when you're able to do this).
---
Maps.  You need to just flat out play each map with the intention of learning the individual layouts.  Take some time to explore them a bit and try and make notes of where the various loops are.  Spawns are nearly uniform for the maps once you get used to where things are at, you begin knowing what to look for.
---
Not knowing where the killer is and guessing a side.  NOOOOO dude.  You must always know where the killer is in a chase it sounds like you're running blind.  You need to rotate the camera whenever necessary so you always know which route or direction to take.  When you can't see them directly because they're behind a wall look for their Red Stain.  That will show you where they're coming from though there are some mindgames that can be played with this stain if they're smart so it's not a guarantee.
---
While looping it is absolutely vital to hug the loop as tight as humanly possible.  This is what makes looping work.  It's all about their larger hitboxes being forced to take the loop a little wider than ours.  If you aren't looping optimally you lose the tiniest bit of distance which is just enough for them to get the hit.  Looping is a game of inches.  A second hesitation and they are going to be able to hit you.
---
Windows are amazing!  Unlike pallets you can't burn them up and they should be utilized whenever possible.  My guess is your pathing is off and you aren't taking the most efficient path to the window causing all those hits.  The amount of times I've tied killers up for a full minute at the same T or L Wall is insane.  
---
You'll need to learn what pallets are safe and unsafe as well as distance judgement.  Over time you'll learn what distance the killer is in relation to you and if you have the space to take an extra loop.  Safe pallets can be continuously looped even when tossed and not broken but unsafe pallets you sometimes want to avoid entirely.  There are tons of pallets where they can get a free mindgame hit even if you use it for a stun.
---
When you start to get more confident with looping you can try advanced mindgames like baiting respects.  After a loop or two I'll often test the killer out by stopping short at the pallet to make it look like I'm gonna toss it they respect and back off and I just continue the loop.  This is a free loop everytime it works.  This is especially effective against Huntress who will wind up a hatchet as you simply continue rounding the corner to piss her off.
---
Decisive is totally not unfair or cheesy and if being camped or tunneled is a consistent problem for you you should run it immediately.  I never used to run it prerework because it was total cheese.  Basically survivors NOED.  But it got reworked to be totally fair and only punishes tunneling babies now.  I run it routinely post rework in case I get that kind of a killer.
---
It's hard to put it into words looping is something that is highly visual but I tried.  YouTube vids will help you learn to do it easily.  Survivors like Monto, Puppers and Noob are all strong loopers but my issue with them is none of them are the least bit instructional while doing it and often they meme and mess around.  I'd actually recommend checking out some Truetalent vids for looping.  He started getting into looping like 6 months ago and he constantly posts vids of him looping killers as survivor.  I've seen him take time midplay to detail exactly how to run a Jungle Gym vs. The Killer Shack vs. An L Wall setup etc....he can be very informative for newer loopers compared to some of the others.    Just look for any titles that mention him specifically looping killers or 1v1 killers etc.... those are the ones most likely to help.
---
omg that‚Äôs epic
---
You're a proper cunt xd who hurt your feewings
---
The person who linked it to reeee is the only person who links to that sub. And it's all he does all day long lol
---
Bruh
---
We also have all them for starters with a few more
---
Stake Out is my addiction. I know it's midtier at best but its nice to not have to worry about great/hex skill checks for a while.
---
Problem is higher ranks are rife with spirits, nurses, billies and mikes and you're stuck with either no TR or getting chased.
---
[Here is the roadmap btw](https://imgur.com/a/2FvF01s), F if the next chapter is It
---
First question I will ask is was there ruin? If the answer is no there is always a reason for that and NOED is usually the case.
---
ahh I understand now
---
Who cares? He has BBQ. Don¬¥t even need to play him and he is worth it.
---
Really like it nice job
---
hmmmmm, I'd say the survivor would hold their head with their hands while Slender just stands in front of them. The sound effect could be heard throughout the map though, the static overwhelming an killing the survivor.
---
Barbeque or Chili? Your choice.
---
Just did a game with her and omg I loved it üòÑ downed two survivors in like first second haha
---
This is my entire Killer experience. With Survivor I go in with all sorts of unique meme builds. But with Killer, there‚Äôs only one build that‚Äôll allow me to compete without being teabagged out of the Fog.
---
Yeah if you try to do a game without ruin and aren‚Äôt an amazing killer then you just get gen rushed big time.
---
&gt;As a killer I would just give it to them because my pride isnt worth waiting.
---
Which is funny as we are just sitting on the coin flip side of it, the advantage just slid slightly as it was annoying that shitty survivors would get an almost guaranteed escape on the sole virtue of being the last one if the team wasn't complete trash.
---
 For every good survivor that made it to be the last one there is an immersed Claudette that did shit all for the team. If you really did fine it doesn't impact rank much as you'll still get the silver emblem. 
---
If your team wasn't losing bad you'd be in the end game regardless (1 gen or less), which is not the case with most EGC.
---
Why is it called the god pallet though?
---
Yes, kinda like a Leader for Altruistic actions and for yourself.
---
Adrenaline isn't a crutch, I'll say this as someone who plays both sides.
---
But whatever. Fuck it. Nerf them both idc.
---
I don't blame them though because you don't know if the killer will farm or not. My friends and I have literally tried to farm with killers and we've brought bps and even sometimes the killers have brought bps or gruesome gateau's and still the killer will tunnel and camp and/or mori and everyone walks away with shit points, it's fucking ridiculous. Honestly the worst event I've experienced so far, not just because of the killers being dumb but also because of game bugs, matchmaking being stupid and taking forever and or disconnection and having to restart the client because friends can't see me in their group or something.
---
I know its quite pretentious to assume people are gonna want to ask me questions, but here are some obvious things you may just be wondering or want to know:
---
The perk build I used to get from rank 4 to 1 was Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Iron Will, and DS. Before rank 4, I was still experimenting with other perks (Deliverance, Unbreakable, Quick &amp; Quiet, Balanced Landing etc). But this build worked out the best for me.
---
One of the best survivor main youtubers I watched to get better was Ussylis (youtuber). He's incredible with survivor pathing. Go watch him if you haven't already (he also streams on Twitch)
---
Rank 3 was definitely the bottleneck point. Before that, ranking up was smooth sailing. As soon as I hit rank 3, I was stuck there for a good 2 days, in a cycle of pipping, black pipping, and depipping. I learned a lot from other survivors though, and I finally made it out.
---
No, I rarely used any items like toolboxes or instaheal medkits. I don't know why, because I have loads. Its whatever.
---
No, I'm not a blendette player. Believe it or not, crouching around the map doesn't get you to rank 1. And red ranks killers aren't blind.
---
Iron Will allows me to play more aggressively/altruistic because I can hide near killers while injured without getting heard. This advantage saved me countless times. Good perk, you should run it if you don't already.
---
This was a solo/duo effort. My friend, who I occasionally duo'd with, also got to rank 1 but a bit before me. We don't play on comms because I dont have a mic. I play with beats headphones lol. My actual headset broke during the summer.
---
This is my second time ever getting red ranks survivor. The last time was like 4 months ago when I got to rank 4 but then rank reset happened.
---
Yes I am a killer main. I get rank 1 killer almost every month. However this month I decided to change priorities to survivor, and it worked out in the end. I'm only rank 6 killer though lol. Still got 2 weeks before rank reset though.
---
The rumors are true. You will see Nurse and Spirit in 80% of you games. I've never played vs a red ranks clown, doc, trapper, wraith etc. Which is understandable. But it makes the survivor grind feel tedious at times. Especially spirit. Fuck spirit. Even Iron Will won't save you from that killer.
---
The great thing about the red ranks pipping system is you have to do pretty much everything to even get a single pip, let alone double pip. This means you can't just genrush, because you'll black pip every time. You could even depip if you never get chased. You basically have to be a good all-round survivor and be efficient af with gens and saves to rank up. This is where game and map knowledge comes in handy.
---
Aight ima head out
---
It's not an exploit, just a quirk in the exhaustion system.
---
As a killer I find this amusing, I would so love to find your creeping behind me, I would have to hook you at least once as a mark of respect.
---
Sexytime has begun
---
Yeah, both NOED and adrenaline are clutch perks.
---
Only use when someone is being picked up or a pallet is broken
---
If the killer isnt locked in an animation they can easily look up or away and u wont blind them
---
The best time to do it is right when they lift the survivor up to their shoulder, that's when you start blinding and it will blind them right when they exit the animation and they'll drop the person. If you time it right it will be a guaranteed flashlight save and the killer can't do anything.
---
I always got Obsession when my friend plays with DS. It happens. If 2 are running it, there are only 2 others it can shift to. It's either gonna be you or other, there's no way around it. It's not a bug.
---
Yup
---
Bubbandaugilly
---
Council: oh you want good survivors? Here take these 2 rank 18 and 1 rank 10
---
Slenderman, hell yeah. Jeff the Killer is pretty much Legion to me.
---
Dude....did you not see the part where I was RUNNING HIM ALL GAME. I did half a gen before he found me and then that was it. I was running him. I COULD NOT DO TOTEMS. The exit gate was opened. I was a sprint burst from making it out, and then Noed kicks in. He had T3 Bloodlust and an instadown M1. HE failed his objective way harder than I did.
---
That and I wager more people enjoy playing killer. This is offsite by SWF.
---
 Finally
---
He was running a basement build. He had Insidious, BBQ, Iron grasp, and Noed. I doubt he even had Ruin since only Noed was Tier 3
---
Also wanted to get bbq and chili
---
You just said that the killer gets rewarded for making it to endgame, can you not hear yourself? The killer making it to endgame in that way is not a good thing, they are trying to prevent that and survivors aren‚Äôt.
---
It‚Äôs the safest pallet in the game, and should try to be preserved at all costs unless you absolutely have to use it. Looping the killer shack is one of the strongest places in the game when god pallet is up (obviously except in your case against a 5 blink nurse)
---
Rule 34
---
Yeah, fuck that guy for doing his daily.
---
Oh ok
---
Thank you for letting me know about this, just did it. Hopefully it goes through
---
sorry being insta moried isn't fun
---
You have to work for Adrenaline. Whether that's running the killer or doing the gens. Either way you have to work for it. 
---
Noed you just get for letting them do gens.
---
It's a new feature. At 50 you get the opportunity of 4 perks.
---
New.
---
Level 40 and up.
---
Same thing happened to me. Team was getting wrecked. By some luck and skill, I hadn't been hooked yet. Myers finds us on a gen. He hadn't hit M3 yet once. I run at him to take his attention. He hits 3, and just tombstones me.... THE ONE TIME I GET BRAVE. lol
---
Not really. More quick games nets more points than a few slow ones. I'd rather just get to another one.
---
First a face reveal, now feet? Makes you wonder what we're gonna see next
---
You became the uninstall? Impressive
---
instant karma
---
demo patch added bloodweb changes, now three perks appear levels 40-50 and past 50 you see 4 perks
---
Well if you see low rank survivors with the new lobby system, you have the opportunity to leave the lobby because you can see their ranks. If you are in green ranks it's your choice to play with rank 20s.
---
Probably the Legion, you know how much he likes that killer
---
Jason?!
---
good gameplay?
---
you mean letting you're whole team do everything and sitting in  a bush Ya thats good gameplay
---
nah fucko. adreniline should have some prequesition
---
lets take a look at deliverence
---
rewards altruisme good perk
---
lets look at blood warden, rewards timing,
---
lets look at NOED and adreneline in their current states
---
noed: rewards nothing besides survivors fucking up
---
Adreneline: rewards doing gens right? WRONG it rewards gens being done you don't have to do anything to get that reward.
---
both reward NOTHING besides the other side FUCKING UP
---
how can we fix this
---
Noed i got no fucking clue that shit needs a nerf as it is strong but just fucking cleanse (BUT WAIT I COULDNT I WAS GETTING CHASED. then fucking take him to a teammate dumbo)
---
adreneline: you have to atleast finish a gen or be in a chase when all gens done. plus remove the heal. just keep the speed boost. thats good
---
but both are crutches don't beat around the bush
---
No. If it rewards good gameplay it gets to be strong. If it rewards bad gameplay it needs to be weak.
---
I would love to rework all hex totems. The risk vs reward is too heavy for how simple it is to cleanse the totems. Especially with how survivors spawn super close, cleansing poses no challenge and the killer risks being out a perk for the rest of the game it feels sour when you get a totem destroyed less than 45 seconds into a game. 
---
Combo that with how survivors have perks and items designed to find them, you risk playing extremely defensive or hyper aggressive just to get the result of your perk. Plus bandaid solutions like Haunted Ground or Thrill of the Hunt don‚Äôt really solve anything, only exacerbate the fact that hex totems are weak by design. 
---
Some Hexes like Devour Hope and Lullaby would just be flat out over powered if they weren‚Äôt hexes, yes, but reworking them into a more manageable state where they offer high power for jumping through hoops to get there would be perfectly fine. 
---
What would those changes be? No idea.
---
didnt even check the chest first!!
---
i dont know what happened to this game, but as a killer i wait 5-10 minutes while "searching for match" right now on PS4, while one year ago when i last time play DBD it was like insta lobby as killer/survivor
---
Oh okay I gotcha. Yeah I realized after slamming it that it was absolutely pointless lol. Thanks for telling me
---
Congrats man!  With some more time you‚Äôll be able to experiment with builds even at rank 1 and have some fun/interesting games.  I myself have actually been focusing on killer the least week or so since and being a mostly survivor player I‚Äôve been trying to get rank 1 killer.  The highest I had gotten before this reset was rank 4 but I‚Äôm currently sitting at rank 2.  Surpassingly though I don‚Äôt play constant nurse/spirit.
---
As a killer main, I can feel the pain and frustration coming from that trapper
---
I fucking suck at it and its no fun
---
I really love the concept and ideas. Oh well. Maybe one day the idea will be done justice
---
Do you think he would be Susie?
---
yes but I think it started on a higher level, idk at which but not on lv 10
---
That games keep on failing to connect to the servers, I git nothing from the event.
---
Don't forget that calm spirit makes you die faster on the hook
---
demogorgon is the weakest or second weakest killer in the game lmao

Of course!
---
Ok but nurse has to be ultimate boss battle music.
---
DS just increases the chances is doesn‚Äôt confirm your the obsession
---
Killers can have obsession perks too.
---
Wow that‚Äôs unfair
---
shit like this gets upvoted and there are people who think this sub is killer biased lmfao
---
survivor mains are fucking delusional
---
I don't understand why they nerfed cold dirt and Joe's mixtape from ptb to live. Cool down Legion was the only fun way to play them before the rework, but now they just made the killer a chore to play. There's nothing less fun than staring at your hands for 4 seconds every single time you use your power.
---
But as a killer on Xbox you are looking at 1 hour queues, 45 minutes if you are lucky.vso rushing games doesn't get you much.
---
That‚Äôs your teams fault. Not Bubba. Gotta pound those bones. It‚Äôs not a crutch perk because it did nothing for him all game. I hate the term clutch perk, like no you‚Äôre just salty.
---
Ayayaya,did she kill her entire race to make that mask?
---
How ?
---
Why did you space everything out like this. 
---
Here's the nerf for Adrenaline: be in a chase or working on a generator when the last gen is done. 
---
Here's ur nerf to Noed: killer needs to hook a survivor to get a charge of Noed. Each charge is 1 instant down hit, every offensive action expends a token. If the killer misses an attack they lose all tokens.
---
keep playing and watch some videos/streams and you will get better
---
nah, most survivors are bad (or frustrated that they aren't better) and it's easier to blame someone else, than admitting your own mistakes
---
for example stuff like "last 3 gens are next to each other" is never the killers fault. they still blame the killer for it.
---
Feel bad for pc and ps4 players only takes me 4m to find survivors on Xbox and if you don't know Xbox got the least players in dbd so I don't know what going on hopefully it gets better for you guys
---
Then don‚Äôt play team games. That‚Äôs the belly of the beast sometimes.
---
Getting. Chased. All. Game. 
---
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO TOTEMS WITH HIS CHAINSAW IN SPITTING DISTANCE OF MY HITBOX. 
---
Jesus fucking Christ it's like killer mains can't read.
---
Make your choice is a must
---
I hope you get to experience the Mental form of hot dog water you uncultured gay fucktard. Your Minecraft dog will now get thrown into a pool of lava you reason abortion was invented
---
Guy looks like he's fifteen but talks like he's in his mid-twenties. If YouTube/Twitch doesn't work out, there're radio station managers that'll be falling all over themselves to get him in a time slot.
---
That was beautiful to watch lol.
---
If killers were getting fucked by bad luck like that, BHVR would patch it out within the hour and every killer main would be given $20, a blowjob, and keys to City Hall as an apology.
---
For perks I'd say just NOED at this point.  It used to have equal company in MoM and Decisive but both were reworked to be fair.  
---
For items, Keys and Instaheals.
---
For Offerings, Moris.
---
For Addons, Prayer Beads, Omega Blink, Additional Blinks.  I'm still on the fence on this last one but I think Black Incense is in that topic of conversation.
---
It *is* called calm spirit hahaha
---
I never said YOU had to do totems, there are literally three other survivors who could have done that.
---
Shadowborn players be like
---
It's not my fault they didn't either. And how am I supposed to lose a killer when every move I make leaves giant ass red marks leading right to me?
---
It's like no one here plays Survivior
---
It can be real annoying in endgame because if you leave hook even a little bit, BT + bodyblocking can destroy any chance of you being able to hook someone after the save and you feel helpless.
---
Outside that, I don't mind it because it encourages a healthier style of play for the game. There's certainly more annoying perks. I wouldn't mind if they just changed all unhooks to have BT and balance around that.
---
The final boss we were afraid all these years
---
If you hate spirit a lot, run Spine Chill with Iron Will. Spine Chill will allow you to see what direction the spirit is coming when phase walking and it can even tell you whether or not she is actually phasewalking or faking it. Iron Will will make it harder for the spirit to locate you while phase walking especially on tier 3 so basically Spine Chill has always seemed to be a very essential perk for me and it is way underrated. (I know you said Iron Will wont save you, but trust me, it does.)
---
I havent for years. Some people just arent good at this stuff but still would like to have some fun
---
Moris are a major bitch move. Just kill them with the hooks you smol brain.
---
Or it gets rendered useless and the killer has three perks if you, oh, I don‚Äôt know know, do totems?
---
Brutal Strength, BBQ and Chili and Pop Goes the Weasel
---
And yet, all three of them escaped despite not doing it and I died for their mistake. 
---
THAT is complete bullshit.
---
 Perhaps a casual play mode
---
Then blame your teammates and not a hard counterable perk?
---
Lemme ask you the same question I ask everyone here. 
---
How am I supposed to do the totems....
---
IF IM GETTING CHASED ALL GAME
---
It will keep what you have on that survivor, but you will not have those perks and outfits on other survivors
---
It‚Äôs perfectly fair lol Tinkerer is awful
---
As a killer main I eat ds all day. I don't plan to rank past 8 ever again. No point. Harder games cause every survivor plays meta cause of meta nurse, spirit/etc and longer ques.
---
YOUR TEAMMATES SHOULD BE DOING THEM :D
---
Demo has no eyes so why do lights work
---
I'm right at that rank and it's scrumptious
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/daxj0o/anyone_know_when_bond_and_dead_hard_were_last_in/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
And play Killer with no Ruin? I'll just stick to regular queue
---
How about I blame the killer who decided to run such a scummy perk and decided to facecamp the one down he got?
---
They will give you your BP back. They're one of the best support team out there.
---
he hadnt used the tombstone yet so we didnt know
---
How is DS still a crutch post rework?  Before absolutely but after?  It punishes infants that camp and tunnel off hook.  At this point as killer the only time I even get d striked is if it's intentional because I want to swap obsessions to help my STBFL or something.  Killers have to go to its website and register for its mailing list to get D Striked these days lol.  They literally choose to play into it and make it a thing.
---
It's next to impossible to stop an optimized SWF group without an over optimized spirit or nurse build. They're always working a gen. They always run you for at least a minute, and they always have the saves.
---
thats going into my meme build. Calm Spirit+Technician and I mess up as many skillchecks as I can.
---
If someone is healing you and messes up Calm Spirit should block that too right?
---
I am a rank 2 survivor main. Mind game, be aware of your scratch marks, walk sometimes. You don't have to run at all times.
---
You're right on the part where it isn't your fault they didn't do them. It ended up being your problem though
---
if you really ran the killer for 5 gens your team could have easily done all the totems
---
AND you can't even see each other spin obnoxiously :P
---
If it's paired with the right perks it's heart attack inducing
---
They are there to be used. If I am playing a killer I want to see what there mori is. Besides, I mostly save them fro whatever survivor tries to body block first
---
Survivor main actually. You got stuck on a bad team. Don‚Äôt expect the game to cater to you because of a bad game. It sucks, yeah. But you don‚Äôt have to cry for every unlucky break that happens to you. I get stuck with shit teammates all the time and I do just fine.
---
And yet, they all escaped and I died bc they didn't. So explain to me how by some cosmic logic I deserve to die for their error. 
---
And stop with the condescending :D. I'm not here to be talked down to by the professional victims that are killer mains.
---
-&gt;Plague's Incense Burner
---
-&gt;Bubba's Body

---
-&gt;Billy's Chainsaw
---
-&gt;Amanda's Pig Mask
---
Big Thonk moment right here
---
This is amazing! I'd like to hear your take on pig!
---
I died bc of something I had no hand in. That's completely unfair.
---
I have no idea what's going on with you people but **CEASE**
---
That‚Äôs his choice? Though luck. He basically lost the game by going just for you, you just happened to be caught in the crossfire. You move on from crap like that and learn to deal with it when there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. The only thing you CAN do is play SWF and get your teammates to do totems.
---
And yet they didn't. And they escaped and I died. How is that fair.
---
I'm gonna be real, I started bringing gross toolboxes because the first 5 games I played last night earned a total of less than 15k BP combined. First found because I don't hide immediately when hearing the heartbeat, downed by a spirit, nurse, or instasaw billy after a relatively short chase, then they never spend more than 10 seconds away from my hook despite no one being near me, and I die on my first hook. Or if I'm lucky and I managed to get pulled off, I get mori'd immediately. 
---
Happens enough times that I just put on a build for blending and bring a nasty toolbox, because even if I only get 10k or 12k points,  its still better than every previous game combined.
---
Sure it feels bad when we end up stomping a killer who had a really fair build and didn't play like a dick, but we have to make builds around the killers that make the game miserable for us, and this comes at the cost of the enjoyment of others.
---
I hate that it ends up like this sometimes because I want to play unique and fun survivor builds using nonmeta perks, but god damn when I try to, I just get fucked over for it.
---
You also die faster on second phase. You immediately go into the struggle phase because you dont scream
---
&gt; I shouldn't be getting fucked mid chase bc of my teammates mistakes
---
then don't play survivor fucking lol
---
When you consider you have to consume your add-ons every match and don't have the luxury survivors get of being able to retain your stuff after a successful match, killers need to burn through bp a lot more to be optimal, while good survivors could theoretically never have to burn a single item or add-on if they're not using instaheals or something like that.
---
If killers got to keep their add-ons after a successful match like survivors, let's say something along the lines of "green or lower rarity add-ons are not consumed after a 3k or 4k", I probably wouldn't feel the need to run it anymore, but atm I have to burn through 1 or 2 bloodwebs to get a single specific green add-on that is good for my killer, so I can't really afford to not use BBQ.
---
There is no deserve, that‚Äôs just the way it is.
---
Totem placements can be very unlucky. Nothing should or will be done about those. So salty
---
Ahh ok thanks for the reply üôÇ
---
Mmmh I‚Äôm a GF main too, currently cycling the prestige‚Äôs as double BP, consistent 4ks at red ranks with questionable builds
---
And then I play SWF and killers whine and complain that they aren't having fun against SWF teams
---
It's the same here on Xbox.
---
That‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs unfair sometimes. That‚Äôs what happened in a luck based game. Tough shit.
---
I love doing this to SWF that all have flashlights in the lobby
---
Play aggressively to end games with gens up.  An average game for me ends with 1-2 gens up.  That's how you counter Adrenaline.
---
Don't play a game you enjoy bc there's an unfair aspect to it that fucks you for other people's errors. 
---
Genius.
---
And would that be a bad thing? Everyone has their perspectives and that's OK. You don't need to agree with me. But just to be clear, I will continue to correct other people's grammar. Hopefully one will be grateful about it.
---
&gt; Surviviors have to work for Adrenaline.
---
*urban evades in the corner all game*
---
*gets adren*
---
"i am a god"
---
No problem :D
---
That‚Äôs what I said
---
I know exactly what you mean by wanting single player gameplay. That‚Äôs probably the only thing I liked about F13 honestly. 
---
Dunno if I can help at all but if you‚Äôre on PS4 like me, I‚Äôd be more than happy to get some KYF going for practice if you want. No BP sadly but the offer‚Äôs there.
---
I can attest to this. In all my days of playing Doctor I‚Äôve only run into a single survivor running Calm Spirit. 
---
Needless to say, that little bastard got away.
---
Don't worry you and your mates get better as you rank up.
---
Also in this scenario you were bound to die on your first hook anyway against Basement Bubba. You saved your shit team.
---
Again, thought the context of this comment chain was on old flashlight saves where the pickup animation was slow and flashlights were unavoidable lightsabers.
---
If we are talking about new flashlight saves, they are just bad.
---
Nice try, but I screenshotted it beforehand
---
That's because you're not a sub-human piece of shit like most killers. You are a good person :)
---
**WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK**
---
How?
---
new map is absolute worst for survivors. narrow hallways, no roo m to 360, no safe loops
---
 Nah
---
Generally the strong perks haven‚Äôt changed much, ds is still really good but not as op as before, same with bt, sprint burst is alright but I prefer balanced landing or dead hard. Adrenaline is still one of the best.
---
Only devotion 2. Haven't had this game too long huh?
---
I‚Äôve been having this bug on PS4 as well, for every single game. Once I escape it says ‚Äúhost disconnected.‚Äù Are the devs aware of this?
---
I'm going to blow your mind right now: in this game, no one actually "works" for any of the perks at all. None of them. Not even Adren, which only requires holding a button
---
Next time don't taunt like an asshole and just leave lmao. Karma
---
Yellow ranks can depip. That has always been a thing.
---
Speaks in downed survivor in middle of cornfield.
---
I'LL SWALOW YOUR THROAT, TRAPPER

Nvidia has a colorbild option, if you have Nvidia activated you can click ALT + F3 ingame and go to filters and select it, but i don't know how well it works but maybe it is worth trying
---
Just you ig? You cant hear them in her terror radius for 5 seconds if thats what your wondering
---
I'm petty enough to make an imgur account just to prove you wrong lmao
---
I‚Äôm telling you he looks like a Cinnamon Toast Crunch! I can‚Äôt unsee it üíÄ
---
Previously you couldn't depip below 15, now you can't depip below 16.
---
I said nah
---
Temple of Purgation is kinda hard to control all gens because that's the biggest map
---
yeah, but as long as you know/expect there‚Äôs someone nearby you can bait the save/chase them off/face a wall before you pick up. It wasn‚Äôt about looking away once they‚Äôve already started flashing you, because in that scenario you hadn‚Äôt anticipated a save and the survivor(s) had gotten the drop on you.
---
Funny bc I'm pretty sure the best killer players in the game have admitted to Noed being a crutch. Otz himself, as an example, has said he doesn't like Noed bc it always gives you kills you didn't deserve.
---
Last night I had a string of shitty survivor games. Bad luck, bad teammates, myself making silly mistakes, you name it. My last match of the night was vs. a Billy on the Game. The match lasted a long time, but we only had 3 gens done. All of my teammates were dead, and I was slugged and dead on hook. I was running Tenacity and Flip Flop just for fun, and I crawled all the way upstairs. Billy found me, picked me up, let me wiggle off, and led me to the exit gates. I understood and left to do the last gens or find the hatch, but he found the hatch first and closed it so I could open the gates. I sent him a message thanking him and wishing him good luck on future games. I got 50k BP and a double pip for that match.
---
It's not much but that's the first time a killer has intentionally let me escape, and it was at the end of a really bad session. It made me really happy!
---
The dream, may your games be filled with points and quick as possible then lol
---
I nearly always get 3 or 4ks on there as myers so I see no issue :p
---
Thanks. I appreciate that.
---
I really hope we get the new Pennywise, he just looks cooler. Old one is scary but just looks like a guy with makeup. Well new one is a guy with makeup too but you get what i mean
---
I love play killer there actually
---
Why do you say that he's useless? He's not my favourite, but I can consistently 4k with him.
---
I think it's a very neat killer, but addons that increase his lunge range and movement speed should be removed as he would be extremely powerful with addons compared to other killers
---
The ultra rare one could probably stay
---
I believe the music is to impose a sense of terror for the killers, wouldn‚Äôt make sense for a survivor to get a personal instrumental background
---
You don't have to play like Seal Team Six to have a big advantage.
---
"Killer is X." "Killer is at House/Killer Shack/Cow loop/etc." "Killer is/stopped chasing me." "Gen is almost done at X." "I'll save."
---
This is real basic shit and most SWF do them by default. You get so much more information in SWF. And that's without factoring in really OP shit like coordinating gens, brand new parts, object of obsession, coordinating perks, map offerings for balanced landings maps or just survivor maps in general, keys, etc.
---
But the time I‚Äôm referencing they didn‚Äôt even get the last gen done lmao
---
I actually feel so bad for him dude wtf
---
Don't exagerated you prick, my dog has drunk a fire resistence potion and now i will shove a diamon sword up ypur cubbby ass
---
It is a crutch. That has literally nothing to do with what I said **at all**
---
I could maybe take survivor mains more seriously if they didn't make believe that totems were still not an objective and didn't use instaheals
---
but that's not the case
---
instead extreme hypocrisy is
---
dr thunder and mountain lightening sound much cooler than their corporate counterparts so don‚Äôt you go disrespecting young man
---
You used a present tense when talking about flashlight saves needing balance. That‚Äôs where the confusion came from.
---
Even survivor queues have been slow this event at times.  I was experiencing like 4 minute queues last night
---
100% the kind of person to say ‚Äúgg ez baby killer‚Äù
---
correct
---
Yeah and I wish it was one of them instead of me. 
---
Whatever. I was a stones throw from a double pip and I remember when I was that bad all I got was "entity displeased" so he definitely depipped
---
I said [my pettiness is unrivaled](https://i.imgur.com/Jza9WxT.jpg)
---
And btw. They haven't turned them into a genuine objective. Until there's a totem counter, they aren't an objective
---
Generally a crutch is something needed to win I simply just stated in your scenario he didn‚Äôt win
---
Same, sometimes i hear her sometimes i don't
---
i think its that after you get hooked you scream and the countdown doesn't start until your scream is done, but with calm spirit, you don't scream, so the timer starts right away instead of giving you those extra couple seconds
---
i do it in morse code with my t-bagging
---
No, are you? Seems like a random and off topic question
---
Crutches give what isn't deserved. Victory or no they're still crutches
---
Imagine going through the effort to edit a photo to pretend you‚Äôre right
---
"The Hillbilly"
---
That's strange. I'll try to find out for sure. Mythology Entertainment split up earlier this year and the rights have been up in the air ever since. Some say, Eric bought the rights back while others say they went to the higher up, Sony Pictures.
---
Mabey add a timer instead of a token.
---
Lmfao hahaha
---
the idea that a counter is needed to make it an objective is so dumb lmao talk about moving goal posts using something totally unnecessary. If that happens then you guys will start screeching that totems don't power gates thus it's still not an objective
---
Erm, no. The balance is that the survivor isn‚Äôt doing objectives and is out of the way to get the save that could very easily be countered.
---
Delet titel
---
In terrorradius = No phase sound
---
When you use borrowed time on your teammate and they get tunnelled ANYWAY (happened to me numerous times).
---
If that were true, which I'm not convinced of, what are we talking about, one second here?
---
It‚Äôs really good! I would love to hear Plagues chase music!
---
Good.
---
Most survivors aren't that.
---
Game is suppsed to be fun, but there are always sweaty tryhards who take it way too seriously. I just want to have fun, if you managed to loop me for 3 gens shame on me and praise you. But you don't have to be cocky and say a killer is a babykiller, ez and shit. 
---
Yesterday I've been playing Billy, cuz I am trying to get adept. I've played Billy like twice or so. I obviously had to get Lerry's. I did some nice chainsaw drifts, but was not enaugh. I even let a guy who was recently hooked slugged so I won't be a tunneler. Obviously he was the one who called me out in aftergame chat calling me a baby and noob. 
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è screw them and let them keeps those few more points I guess

It 100% hasnt always been a thing as the wiki currently says you cant, so even if it isnt true now it was at somepoint.

I *just* stopped playing BL2 to go on this subreddit lol
---
Killers get the gen counter. Surviviors should get a totem counter. Simple logic. There's no emphasis on totems except for Noed, start putting more on it.
---
Other then iron will I don‚Äôt see any counter to a spirit with headphones.
---
Bodybocking is reportable in game. So yeah it's worth me choosing them to get a mori
---
He also lost the game, didn't pip, i don't see any problem.
---
IT doesn't reward good gameplay. You NEED to activly do something for IT to be good gameplay.
---
Right now you can sit in a locker and get it
---
Because Dweet!
---
No. 
---
And make Noed a normal hex perk instead of this "I don't light up till endgame" perk.
---
seriously tho, red is too important in this game and too many types of colorblindness destroy the color red. My boyfriend sees red as gray for example. If he could just change red to yellow, or even certain oranges, he could see scratchmarks and blood.
---
Oh no, I agree but if the first thing I see as I get hook is 2 Claud/Nea crouching around I can‚Äôt be bother.
---
Yes, because OP implied that they should be better. So I said if they are going to be better, they need to be balanced out.
---
Ah yes then keep the tokens.
---
And you can AFK in the corner and get Noed. Except there's no way to earn Noed. There's plenty of ways to earn Adrenaline
---
Licensing issues.
---
Anyone who can see edit history, clear my name.
---
He got a kill he didn't deserve.

That's the problem.
---
I don't see the problem you clearly got what you wanted
---
If you‚Äôre getting plague buy her with shards not cells
---
JuSt dO GeNs
---
Doing Gens isnt plenty of ways
---
there should be a totem counter. but it has nothing to do with whether or not totems are an objective that should be done
---
and again, once there is, there will be a new excuse to not do totems like there always is
---
You hate noed? Get adrenaline and deadhard then.
---
They tried 12 I think
---
it's not fair because the queue time is so long and when u finally get a match u get 3 rank 20's and a purple-red rank killer. not cool.
---
yea
---
100% this. Toxicity is more in the speech than behavior on survivor side. Aside from teabagging and deranking to play against low-skill killers there's fucking little you can do to actually be toxic as survivor outside of your words. Killers however can camp, tunnel, and literally ruin an entire match by beating someone at the hook and costing them BP when they aren't even teamed with the random 3 people that will walk out because of it. 
---
These idiots who think CaMpInG iS a LeGiT sTrAtEgY don't realize it's not 1 v 4 it's 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 unless it's SWF. These fucking randos aren't my friends. I don't know them or intend to ever know them. It's free for all with one person having the power to ruin the game for anyone they choose.
---
I felt like a dummy missing that first blind and thought I sealed my fate there for sure.
---
According to the killer rulebook whenever a Survivior gets downed by the killer it means the killer is a god and the Survivior is trash so no I apparently didn't prove anything.
---
üé∂Here comes the trapper. Watch out for my trapsüé∂
---
It would‚Äôve been nice to listen to. It can sorta make survivors feel unique rather than just skins
---
Maybe they should work on better matchmaking or guilds or better SWF so it's not just 4 people you know IRL living to play this shit?
---
The game hasn't been incredibly survivor sided for a long time. Have you played solo survivor lately? It's bad. Like... really bad. If anything, the game has never been better for killer.
---
Hey did you know the EGC is broken lol
---
Yet this sub mostly only talks abouts problems for killers tbh.

Even after a year of nerfs killers still complain. Just like how people want all killers to be viable thye also want survivor parent be viable as well.
---
Esp if someone DCs it‚Äôs tunnel time.
---
Yeah except right now I can either play killer and roll over 4 randos and get mad amounts of BP OR I can get an SWF team and roll most killers and get mediocre BP and fast queue times. Shit needs to be fixed. Game was intended to be something entirely different and right now it sits between weak horror survival and piss poor e-sport.
---
There is no rulebook, he is gonna stay in low ranks and you are gonna rank up. You have no idea how unfair the game is for killers at red ranks
---
Patience. I had a two player total immersion game like that and I just tried to be more patient and wait for them to make a mistake then come down on the player like the devil‚Äôs wrath. Someone will eventually get bored. If they are still doing generators and stuff just patrol as usual. Check lockers and out of the way survivor hiding spots nearby.
---
Yeah man I hate Spirits with Primer Bulb as well.
---
After x amounts of t bagging the entity strikes.
---
Yes dead hard does. You just have to be injured before hand.
---
If you don't think a minute is a lot of time you probably don't end chases fast. There have been times when I have ended two chases in under 60 seconds and when I pick the second guy up I get stabbed, and just like that my momentum is dead.
---
Ya sometimes I end games really fast and make nice plays with the phasing which is super satisfying other games people are looping for too long usually all comes down to my first chase. I‚Äôll try to drop them if they‚Äôre too long see how that works thank you:)
---
Yah that would be cool
---
Oh that's lovely. Too bad he didn't hit me at all
---
NEA is top tier Killer. She can't be blinded and she can't be pallet stunned.
---
My actual proudest fap
---
In indoor maps it's a lot of fun. But in huge maps you can get looped endlessly.
---
Honestly, Calm Spirit is very useful in my opinion. I dont always use it, but when I do, the killer is running iron maiden üòâ.
---
Will Byers is NOT Shasta!
---
I am aware. That's partly why I main Nurse
---
They're doing gens right in front you praying they get pulled off so you can't slug them and waste their DS lol
---
I told you it's annoying FOR a reason: it makes people not like you.
---
It's OK if you think you're smart for forcing your knowledge onto others, just understand that it makes you look like a pretentious asshole.
---
And yes, I will continue telling you that you're being a pretentious asshole because even if you don't, I would be glad if someone pointed out that people don't like it when others are smartasses.
---
We need more killer buffs, not nerfs
---
Who‚Äôs Quentin?
---
Oh, that one, I never used it, I find the passive one that give BP more health more useful and less situationnal.

Because if your team is so bad that it gaved the ennemy revenge then removing it will just give the opportunity to the ennemy to stall you all even longer and then getting revenge again but this time you won't have your feat with you.
---
I mean yes, it does help sometimes and I must've died at some point because of it but that's basically it.
---
That's not multiple wants. That's Just existing
---
I'd be a lot happier about seeing a good looper if several maps didn't have large numbers of pallets and loops you can't mindgame.
---
I don't mind it when a survivor outplays me doing something clever to buy himself 10 more seconds. But on some maps, it can buy him 30-40 seconds before you get the next opportunity, or turn the entire chase into a waste by running into an infinite or near-infinite (which should not exist). That quickly changes the feeling from enjoying the challenge to frustrated at game design.
---
There's a reason why killers try to figure out who the weaker links on the team are. It's cause they need to if they're not playing Nurse/Spirit.
---
Oh well by that logic then every perk is a crutch perk
---
Extremely powerful on maps like Lery‚Äôs, utterly useless on maps like Auto Haven
---
Well it depends on the killer then i guess. I died to noed alot today, i dont have deadhard for my kate atm but it sure saved me alot when i played nea. A good build is 
---
Adrenaline, Deliverance. Get hooked before the last gen is done, wait for your teammates to open the gates and yeet the fuck out of there. 
---
*You wont get healed to the may
---
yes even with both together they are useless
---
No, would be pretty op if there was
---
On the upshot the blind miss was hilarious especially since it worked out anyways
---
Ya I‚Äôve tried pig and it‚Äôs a lot easier for me to end loops even though i know the spirit is supposed to be the best at ending chases but I‚Äôve only played her for like 2 days now. Also have another question I just need an opinion which is better ruin or corrupt intervention because ruin gets found way too fast 90% of the time
---
Can confirm, saw it when it was first posted
---
Combine WGLF and We'll make it.
---
Detection perks, like whispers, and general game knowledge. Knowing how survivors think will help you locate where they try to hide
---
How shitty of you
---
Chances are if you've double hook everyone you've pipped up in other categories.
---
Yes victor Crowley would fit perfectly imagine the Mori
---
This proposed change would make it insanely easy for douches to smurf their way into bullying baby survivor lobbies though.  I could be a god tier rank 1 player but purposely not rank up say my Billy and Wraith and just use them to bully yellow ranks into the ground.  I just see too much room for exploiting the separate ranks.
---
Thanks man, what do you recommend for killer
---
I got teabagged by a ghostface and I smiled at the thought of how toxic this is about to get
---
Tfw you break your ankles
---
Thank you. You have saved me. I could probably run the image through that photoshop scanner thing as well, just to prove it further
---
What killer is that? It doesn‚Äôt really look like any I know
---
Trapper is a solid killer, but just like Nurse he takes skill to play.
---
This makes me think of Barry the Chopper from Full Metal Alchemist.
---
Easy karma by stealing a meme
---
i haven't played this for such a long time but it was really nice to come back and have fun as a killer again. now im watching loads of killer vids from otz on youtube and its great fun
---
Are you on console trying to do this?
---
Badham rework fixed that
---
No. Because the killer has an inherent advantage.
---
That was actually really helpful only thing I do that you listed is not respecting pallets but in terms of sound I don‚Äôt use headphones so it‚Äôs a bit harder for me to hear important information like the ones you listed. I‚Äôll look into using headphones thank you for your help
---
First off, das sum BULL SCHITE. 
---
Second off, love your outfit! I also use only the P3 mask and default clothing &amp; weapon on Michael
---
I wasn't prepared for this wild ride.
---
&gt;Not many survivors worth 2 cents run WGLF. 
---
 Survivors worth 2 cents can afford to ruin WGLF because they don't need all the strongest perks. Most choose not to because they like to have all the strongest perks or they've got all perks on their main so don't care much about bloodpoints. 
---
&gt;most survivors end the match dead with 5-10k in points. 
---
I'd say average is closer to 12k, minimum 18k if you survive weren't urban evasioning around the map. Just two stacks on WGLF (1 unhook, 1 protection hit at the gate) already gets you 27k if you survive. Survive with a decent game of 22-25k and you're getting 33-38k with 2 WGLF stacks. Killed at 12k with 1 WGLF stack is still 15k. Enough for a green item and add ons. If you die with ~8k points you've probably only played for 5 minutes before dying. Not bad to make 8k in 5 minutes.
---
Competition for unhooks is a fair statement though. Against a good killer you'll get more unhooks but less likely to survive. But as I said earlier, you can usually get a protection hit at the exit gates. Maybe a nice boost to WGLF would be if you also got a stack each time you healed a survivor by 1 full health state.
---
Wait until you discover the beauty of scratched mirror myers
---
Try Save the best for last, they wont have time to tbag, bodyblock or save their mates in front of you.
---
You can't please everyone
---
And yet.... if a lot of survivors are calling you a camper, it‚Äôs probably because your a camper. 
---
Let‚Äôs flip this for you:
---
‚ÄúMost killers are bad and it‚Äôs easier to blame someone else than admitting you‚Äôre a camper. 
---
For example, stuff like standing next to or near someone who was just hooked, or constantly remaining nearby is never the survivors fault, but you blame survivors for it.‚Äù

I love how bills perks are both personal and altruistic. Borrowed is about unhooking, while unbreakabill and now left behind are about looking out for yourself. It‚Äôs a fun combo to run all three, and maybe a we‚Äôll make it or any other saving perk with it.
---
Well said
---
I swear pub Survivors suffer from "Team Fortress 2 pub syndrome" where they do 99% of the objective and then just *forget that the objective exists?* I can't count the number of games I've had (both as Killer and as Survivor) where the Survivors did 4 out of 5 gens and then the Killer just patrolled the last 3 gens (which could be on opposite sides of the map for all its worth!) with zero progress and would just occasionally run into a Survivor crouching in a bush to chase them. Then after 10 minutes of playing Hide and Sleep the last Survivor (who was probably camping the hatch) takes the hatch.
---
Thanks. It took me awhile to make this.
---
We have the penalty for hook proximity (Which I think should be much stronger anyway)
---
I think that even if you didn't kill everyone, depending on your rank, you could get a safe pip (like for yellow ranks, you can get just one kill and double hook everyone else and still make it)
---
Well bt usually prevents tunneling. so he doesn‚Äôt get another down.
---
I don't get the Item,can somebody explain?
---
You know when you get hooked, you scream in pain for like 2-3 seconds. During that time your hook timer is paused, if you have calm spirit on then you won't scream and immediately start your hook timer, it isn't really a game changer but it is technically a decreased hook timer overall still lol.
---
This was soloq.
---
Pretty decent overall. Had lots of fun, most I met seemed to be a bit more relaxed than normal.. 
---
But also had my fair share of encountered players - both survs and killers. Survs who would flame the killer because they played normally and didn't farm - and killers who flamed when the survs dared to not farm with him /shrug
---
Omg I would love Elvira in the game in some way, if love her as an Ashe esque voiced survivor but I‚Äôm not sure how her as a survivor or killer would work lol
---
I assume you don't know what moris are? Or what Myer's tombstone add-ons do?
---
&gt; I that font
---
You‚Äôre taking this way too personally by your last sentence ‚Äúkeep trolling if you want‚Äù. I‚Äôve never played like that and never would, I even said so in my original comment so there‚Äôs no need to get heated. But leading the killer to someone else really isn‚Äôt bannable since it‚Äôs VERY hard to see it it‚Äôs intentional or not. Playing the game in a shitty or selfish way has never been bannable. In the case of leading the killer to another survivor it could be a strategy (albeit a selfish one). It falls under other things that aren‚Äôt fun or nice but aren‚Äôt bannable - like farming your teammate off a hook or camping. If you can show me evidence that it‚Äôs bannable then by all means show me but I checked the bannable offences and this is not one. Working WITH the killer is bannable, yea. But if you lead the killer to a teammate and the killer kills them and you any way you‚Äôre not working WITH the killer you‚Äôre just playing selfishly.
---
Get closer to them, wait for their little dance, then hit
---
For me it‚Äôs the killer‚Äôs that is taking too long.
---
THATS WHO I WAS THINKING ABOUT!!! Also thanks for the tips.
---
With how shit the matchmaking has been as of late Bloodhunt should be extended to a full week. Possibly even two. This was easily the shittiest Bloodhunt we've had by far between all the connection errors, streamers at TwitchCon, and the general issues that always plague Bloodhunt. (Killer queue times taking 30 years, people being assholes just for the sake of being assholes, etc.)
---
There's people who say that the options would offer too strong an advantage to non-colorblind players seem to overestimate their importance. Survivor noise, blood pools and just general map and game sense can help locate a survivor in conjunction with scratch marks.
---
Color blind players can use them tools but they're at a significant disadvantage without the scratch marks. But the amount of time brighter marks would help non-colorblind is so little imo it's a "sacrifice" worth making.
---
I think that was my friend
---
I suppose it's just the idea of a trophy tied to the Killing mechanic at all, especially one that involves killing everyone in the match. You are right though, that is an alternative to using Moris.
---
r/HydroHomies is gonna be mad
---
I'm definitely hoping for a Hellraiser combo someday with switchable appearances.
---
I was expecting her to just fuck it up massively like all my teammates do, but that turned out pretty great
---
I think i'm 8 right now.
---
idk why you're being downvoted my dude just trying to make light of hard times :/
---
Is there a way to do this with dlc killers? Not sure if I bought bbq and chili when it was in the shrine and I don‚Äôt own leatherface
---
Being honest learn to play without ruin, if you use ruin from the getgo you can never play without it. Until high ranks at least
---
STBFL doesn‚Äôt take away stacks when you hit them with shred though. So what I do is get high stacks and only shred the obsession ;) it‚Äôs actually insanely good on him.
---
You might wanna check out otzdarva(though he only posts often on his second channel named not otzdarva) on YouTube and or twitch for some tips and gameplay and unique builds to go for as well :)
---
Best way to punish this kind of behavior if to hop on some gens, stop wasting time and play the objective
---
Did a solo survivor game for the first time in a really long time. Was afraid I was gonna get tunneled, farmed, abandoned etc. by the others, but instead the killer mainly focused on them the whole time, they teabagged each other whenever they got downed, and I was able to get Gens done, got a lot of saves and even ran the killer about a gen and a half near the end plus I managed to escape. All and all managed to get 60,000 bp and now I might actually go back and play solo survivor sometime again soon.
---
Mist doesn‚Äôt stack beyond purple. Still hell though, I would just dodge them
---
Were you playing on Xbox? Because I'm pretty sure I was in that match, twice...
---
Thanks, I'll have to try that out.

&gt;I see a post on Reddit

-
---
&gt;I wonder why it has so many upvotes
---
&gt;IT'S A REPOST
---
Same. Maybe they would even make cenobite versions of original killers as skins.
---
Yeah just select any killer, bring it up and keep scrolling along until you get to the one you wanna view
---
Thanks, yeah it does help, it will take a while to get all the perks tho, I was looking to have something to gring for, thanks again.
---
How is the hatch not fair? Whoever ends up finding the hatch was simply the luckier one (unless the survivor had a nice map). If the survivor finds it, they can escape. If the killer finds it, they can close it then monitor the gates, which more often than not, results in death for the survivor. Unless the killer is a complete potato. In that case they don't even deserve the kill.
---
That was greatüòÇüòÇ
---
I just imagine someone's peacefully doing a gen when all of a sudden, out of nowhere, this starts playing right as the Spirit stops phase shifting to grab them off the gen. It would make the jumpscare ten times worse. Great job!
---
I really disagree on "very doable" because you're assuming best case on the body blocks. What is way more likely to happen is that the killer sees both/all of you, realizes what your plan is because it happens pretty often, and either carefully aims his swing at the unhooker twice (the smart play, to avoid BT/adrenaline), and/or just smacks the hooked person as soon as they're off. Pretty much, if he's gets a swing off during the unhook, someone is almost certainly going down. And most killers are not going be far enough away during EGC hooks to not get that unhook swing.
---
And let's be honest, we've all often seen it go wrong and the game goes from one person dying on hook to 3 people dying on hook really fast. Trading and disaster are *waaaay* more common outcomes than the miracle save against a hook camp without BT that usually requires the killer to make a significant misplay.
---
That said, if the killer gives enough space that it's a realistic possibility, I'm going balls deep on that save. Doesn't happen much though because most killers are focused on avoiding risk after a hook during end-game collapse.
---
You're wrong it isn't hard to prove.  There's nothing hard to prove about a survivor running up to a locker and pointing at it and opening it in front of the killer so they can get the grab lol.  That's probably the most common example of this practice and again if it is recorded and reported it is bannable.  There isn't an opinion to have on this matter.  You're testing to debate a fact.  Look into it.
---
It wasn't this bad before the 3.1 hotfix, usually there's a hotfix along with bloodhunt / an event patch which not only includes changes but also "bug fixes", every. single. event. (atleast most recent ones)
---
&gt;If you chase someone off a generator unless you catch them in a short time break off and go regress the one they were working on.
---
Thats awful advice honestly, unless the survivor runs away very early its usually much better to commit to them rather than regress a gen 1 or 2% before it is tapped again
---
You realize 2 dead and 2 escape is considered balanced right? This whole mentality that if the killer doesn't 4k then it's survivor sided is ridiculous. I've played the game since 2016. This game has favored killers vs solo survivors for quite a few patches now. It's balanced around SWF which cucks solo survivors hard. I'm sorry that you believe that the game should be easy street for all killers regardless of their individual skill level (personal skill level not the killer they are playing). I very much believe you need to "get good" if you want to 4k non stop. Not everyone deserves rank 1 just because they play a lot. You are against other real life players whom may actually be better than you *gasp*, and at that point you deserve to get hard stuck at rank 6 facing against what you perceive as "clearly survivor sided" games because you need to get better just like all other games where you face real opponents.
---
And yes I play both sides. I've been playing killer all morning actually, so far 4k every game. This game has never been easier for killers especially with the usual braindead meta perks (ruin, sloppy, bbq). Sloppy and ruin makes its extremely easy to do at least decent as killer. I suspect dying light to be an upcoming meta perk too.

Has anyone been getting a lot of Michaels lately? Yesterday ALONE I got 6 Michaels in a row.

Not that I mind that because I love going against (good) Michaels.

But still
---
Im all for listened killers, but can we have an original killer now? We've had 2 licensed in a row
---
Beautiful
---
As long as it‚Äôs not 4 moris, or 3 moris and a one hook.
---
a different perk would probably be better against flashlights or no perk at all but lemme tell ya there's absolutely nothing more hilarious than a survivor trying to blind you and failing miserably
---
I joined a lobby with a bunch of SWF Neas while playing Nea. I made the joke "we are the entity" and they all called me ugly XD
---
i mean try it, you instantly have to start struggling when you get hooked a second time
---
I would lose my mind if Elvira was a killer. Please behavior. Make it happen.
---
Especially when you‚Äôre the one playing killer.
---
This is nothing more than anecdotal evidence and no basis for discussions about game balance. If your teammates are bad you shouldn't expect to win, but the reason for that is not that the game is unbalanced, it's because your teammates are bad. 
---
I agree that noed is bs, but ruin is honestly not that strong. Your statement about the skill level of the killer is highly subjective, but if he got 3 or 4 kills, he must have been good or your team must have been bad. A constructive discussion about these topics can not happen on the basis of subjective impressions or anecdotal evidence.
---
Did someone already make this?
---
I made this on meme generator a couple of days ago.
---
Awesome list! Only one I personally feel is missing is Jacob Goodnight from See No Evil. I think he'd be perfect for this game!!
---
What‚Äôs your fps? Are you noticing drops? Do other games you play stutter?
---
Oh got please no I want a sewer map and the next chapter doesn't get a map
---
No, you're not looking at the amount of people that play solo and the amount that play SWF. Notice the bars on the very first picture. Over 50% of players, across all platforms, play solo while less than 10% of players play 4-SWF. You're not considering the total amount in a group
---

If it is right away in the beginning of the trial yes. You can hear though how much time they‚Äôve been on it to a certain degree. You may play differently but this strategy has been relatively successful for me especially at newbie ranks.

I personally feel Elvira would fit more with being a survivor, as she just looks at old movies during her day, so she‚Äôd probably be able to predict things killers do and could be like a more traditional survivor that isn‚Äôt used to being chased by killers like most modern survivors are
---
Actually it depends on the survivor's ability to read the killer and who exactly is the dominant one in the chase. I've been able to juke plenty of high ranking killers (and I'm not even trying to bash them because they were genuinely good).
---
It‚Äôs a great map for Trapper :)
---
That‚Äôs disgusting
---
I don't understand what's wrong with this person. He got showed up, and his response is "we don't know how many people are AFK but have the game open" Wtf lol
---
No, it‚Äôs a perk that actually involves risk, unlike NOED. First off, you have to make it to endgame. Second, it‚Äôs only useful if you stay injured for the last 1-2 gens so that the heal is used. Otherwise you get a 5 second sprint burst, but you can just use another exhaustion perk for that. Meanwhile NOED benefits you regardless. If you fail your main obj, congrats, you get bloodlust basically and 1 hit downs to secure a pity kill. If it doesn‚Äôt proc, congrats, you‚Äôve gained 70+ seconds, probably closer to 100 at the least to account for totem search and travel time. They‚Äôre not the same. And DS stronger know? Lol sounds like a tunneler
---
Oh yes I felt that too. So dark and difficult to see anything downstairs! I was paranoid everybody was just crouching in the darkness down there the whole time
---
i have no idea i thought it was apparent that it was a joke.. who knows morse code?
---
And the mouse is....? I know having things in usb3 can cause some wacky things to happen perhaps the mouse isnt smoothing making it look a bit like stuttering, although it really does look like what your saying try playing on low maybe
---
Apollyon as the killer when?
---
Or maybe the game is just tilted and instead of crying about how you don't want the other side to get more BP, you just accept the hard truth that the game needs to be balanced out. It amazes me that killer mains reeee so fucking hard at the idea that the survivors might get more BP than they do, even if it's still less than they get. Fucking pathetic.
---
Yes, that would be the normal thing. But the good thing about playing a videogame is that you can adapt to different strategies depending on your opponent.
---
At high ranks the game leans towards top tier survivors. However the game needs to as even one bad survivor basically loses the whole match. Top tier killers hold their own against even a full swf and dominate solo queue.
---
This game frankly is impossible to balance, killer addons and survivor items mean that its impossible to do. each killer needs everything altering just for them to ever achieve any balance
---
Pipping is irrelevant, its just to somewhat balance the playerbase and has never been great at showing who played well.
---
xbox has quick queue times. instant as survivor like 5-15 min as hunter
---
Nice flair. Toxic bad tho
---
Rank 20 gameplay?
---
I really wish you could sell addons or offerings for BP. Would make leveling through the Bloodweb a lot easier.
---
I mean I bought him originally just cause I really liked the movies
---
Bad wording on my part due to frustration. Will edit.

Awe man I can‚Äôt stop laughing

Not really toxic by bm‚Äôing though. But being good at looping is toxic apparently so I figured

Maybe with the way matchmaking is right now. I'm like 13 but I've been against red rank killers and level 20 killers this whole bloodhunt as survivor.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Yes yep and yeah... your saying legions bad? Might wanna change your tag
---
Unless your issue is something else! 
---
I've been having a hard time to get the game to load up at all, today.
---
Almost certianly just lag. People really love to go on about lagswitching but it barely ever is that.
---
Exactly, because if you made it not shit, trapper would become shit because his power is essentially just a perk. It‚Äôd basically be giving someone an extra power so it‚Äôd have to be something that‚Äôs super situational but can be fun. Think the head on for killers.
---
Most times DS hits someone, they didn't tunnel. That is a fact. 
---
Tunnelling anyways is doing the objective. Survs love to say "I'm just doing gens it's the objective." 
---
Well, I'm just killing you. It's the objective, and doing it asap isn't so bad.
---
As I said, you're a surv main who gives NO shits about killer QOL.
---
Laurie has those sweet ass ugly yellow pants though bill just has the prestige, shame though because im pretty sure i have seen him in a game with just a grey shirt on (think it was payday)
---
sam's cola is patriotic B)
---
This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever.
---
He was rank 10, level 15-19, and didn't know how to end loops. Only reason he got me was because I didn't notice the bamboozle. Dunno if they counts as a noob
---
Items and perks: ight imma head out
---
The trolling videos are usually baby/newish killers there's no way those same people who post those videos could bully a rank 1 spirit
---
Your aura is still shown to the trapper. Blocking bear trap screams won't do anything
---
People do it cos its an event. But really they dont do anymore than they do out of an event. They dont stack with double bloodpoints.
---
For Xbox it‚Äôs so trash. Dcs everywhere, constant facecamping, laggy killers
---
We're soarin'...we're flyyyyin'
---
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt like michaels prestige mask
---
The thing is, I genuinely WANT to play the game as it was meant to be played. But an overwhelming about of games has lead to be believe if I want BP's this event, I gotta play it for myself. The 'I' in the team.
---
I'm going to stop now because despite my repeated calm conversation and highlighting that I play and enjoy both sides equally, you keep calling me a killer main and suggesting that I'm 'Reeee-ing'. I've explained why killers fundamentally need to earn more BP. If you refuse to accept that then that's fine but it's clear there's no point in continuing this discussion if you can't be civil. Good luck in your future games.
---
Exactly what I mean. Anything that it could affect is client side, so it shouldn‚Äôt actually affect anything
---
Yeah Legion got nerfed pretty bad. No one plays those 3 if they want to do well. Spirit was the only strong one of the 4.
---
You hate licensed killers? Might wanna change yours.
---
I lost Kreygasm
---
I‚Äôm tempted, I have it on disc, but it seems pointless as you literally can‚Äôt play it without an internet connection, I may download it then sell the disc.
---
If someone facecamps i consider them a noob
---
You really dont need to facecamp to win as killer in this game
---
Why do they always swing when blinded? üòÇ
---
What are they messaging you for cause im being honest I get messaged very rarely and usually becuase ive had to tunnel a guy or have camped an idiot. I dont see why you are being messaged every single game unless your doing something annoying
---
Ive never been messaged for being bad at the game, teabagged at the exit sure but never messaged.
---
Sadly, only a small group of killers can actually compete in this game.
---
PC isn't much better. DC's left and right, and killers not taking any pity and letting us have some BP's. I get it, they don't HAVE to be nice to people. But it's like... "yo... I'm staying in your game despite DC's so you don't feel robbed of points, maybe don't let me feel so robbed either?"
---
it's a baby demo poor thing lol
---
As you get higher in rank you'll start seeing survivors shift to the meta perks that can make them harder to deal with. As they increase in rank they'll generally play better so they'll know their loops and stop making bad decisions like dropping every pallet in a five mile radius the second they hear a heartbeat. You'll probably want to level up the Hag to get Ruin from her, you hit this point where the trial starts and you take a single breath then suddenly three gens are done.
---
No response on the Adrenaline portion? 
---
Lol so it looks like you have the stats of hundreds of games to know that most times DS is used they aren‚Äôt being tunneled? Sure.
---
 And calling me a surv main doesn‚Äôt invalidate my opinion, you‚Äôre a killer main. Or you‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI play both sides equally‚Äù, still doesn‚Äôt invalidate me lol
---
Yeah, I absolutely agree.
---
OH! That makes a lot of sense. The blood hunt is there to get as many people online as possible for as long as possible so they can collect data. That way they have a higher chance of figuring out what‚Äôs causing the bugs.
---
She got a chainsaw up her sleeve
---
Modern Problems Require Modern Solutions
---
You can look around in a cornfield for survivors... You can also do a quick 180 and pick them up since survivors can‚Äôt run fast enough towards your face if they are a decent distance from you.

Pennywise is basically a guarantee at this point since they followed Steven King on Twitter

Have you even played the game? You can literally play like the biggest saint on the planet and still get cancer and death wished upon your family just because the person didn't win.
---
Which don't you have?
---
Womp womp
---
Yeah sometimes you get the feeling you just wanna play the game it should be played then you get campers, tunnelers, loopers, sandbaggers etc, so because of the community you gotta play for yourself and I have been playing a long time, I've seen killers and survivors get added, kits get changed and I'm used to playing go the rules of the new community, we just have to accept it
---
Me after 3 gens, 4 safe unhooks with heals and 3 totems.
---
In that case I think he should wrap those stories up and move on with other characters
---
Nooooo self care is such a tremendous timesink go for bond instead or iron will so you‚Äôre less loud when injured or you can see your teammates to go get healed, and it helps for other stuff too like gens because you can double up.
---
The toxicity really is a problem, yeah. I've started playing killer more often and the amount of times I get pallet stunned and then immediately T-bagged is numerous.
---
Franklins would like to know your location
---
Leatherface for BBQ
---
Have you considered closing chat? I know the problem is the people but why not use a tool made to avoid it?
---
You can hear still hear while breaking pallets and can usually gain distance if the survivor does blind you. You can also do many things to counter flashlight saves.
---
Yeah probably salty. Too many people take the game seriously. It's the survivor's goal to work the gens as fast as possible to escape
---
There's nothing I can say, you're stuck with that opinion and no matter how much logic or argument was thrown at you, you'd deny it. And yes, I do play equally. In fact this season I hit r1 surv before killer. 
---
Fact is, even when I'm playing surv I *realize* that the game is heavily balanced towards survivors most of the time. I understand that without killers, I wouldn't be able to even play Survivor. When Killers keep getting the shaft, they DO leave. So enjoy bullying all you want, have 0 sympathy for the other side, and continue being an asshole.
---
Ive had a few messages like any game but ive never played nice and got a hate message. If people message its for a reason, often a dumb reason but a reason
---
The queue times are so long I can barely even play killer. 
---
I've played killer only 3 times. 
---
* First game: Easy 4k. No gens done. (boring)
---
* Second game: 2 Dc's off the bat, let the other 2 farm and leave. (Boring)
---
* Third game: Really stealthy survivors who never did any gens and would only get saves. Game lasted over 20mins since they wouldn't do gens. (boring)
---
Haven't played for a few months so i'm only rank 12 killer, but wow these survivors are ultra boosted.
---
no fucking items for you
---
Especially doing adept David was pretty stressful with this, as apart the camping, it was the perfect opportunity. (I'm rank 4 so doing these adepts isn't easy for me)
---
Dedicated servers aren't out yet.
---
Idk i think if you‚Äôre rank 1 you hold more weight then say someone whos in purple ranks. I think your look on the game is escaping and my look on the game is pipping. escaping is a team effort, pipping is something you can do alone even if you dont escape if you‚Äôre good enough. i think theres a ranking system for a reason and you may not escape every single game but you CAN pip every game so i wouldnt focus on escaping more then pipping, thats just an easy way to get upset and disappointed in the game.
---
BIG UPDATE 
---
So I reached out to McLean(Dev) on his stream and he said that he's not sure why they are not showing that it's most likely a bug or they aren't enabled. He said he's not sure how they are handling it on the switch side of things.
---
The one time I had this happen, I happened to have Whispers equipped just for the people who decide to hide in lockers all day when against the doctor. He was still the last survivor I caught, though.
---
I've been using Rancor to complete mori dailies. If you have this perk unlocked, you could try it.
---
Wow, if that was me I wouldnt even be mad. Thats like, 20000000 IQ play
---
Yes.
---
Yeah,from last patch
---
It's still an effect of the perk ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Lmao yes they are
---
Honestly creating custom themes and such for new killers should be a default part of the creation process of Killers.
---
That's not how it works at all lol. It's a DBD parody so he can only work with the characters in DBD. Last time I watched Tapp got married with Huntress so he's obviously going to show that for a bit. And Nea so happens to be a Killer or Entity in the plotline so.
---
It‚Äôs one of Horzine Corp.‚Äôs experiments in the Killing Floor series. Killing floor is a wave based survival shooter. Basically, they are tanks that bumble around following you slowly until you piss them off enough to charge at you full sprint.
---
It also kinda works since it‚Äôs not the creatures real name, it‚Äôs just the one the kids gave it. So technically ‚ÄúThe Demogorgon‚Äù is its title
---
Lightborn + Overwhelming Presence.
---
Make a survivor burn like half their flashlight trying to go for a save and still fail at it.
---
Should be a fun meme.
---
Nope, they got the gen done cause I wasnt putting enough pressure.  Plus I'm not gonna ruin the game 4 somebody cause their better then me, that's just toxic.  I had something similar happen 2 me against a ghostface, 2 ppl tried 2 give him a free hit n he ignored them n tunneled n camped me everytime.  I was the only 1 who died n he had a 3 man escape. When I asked him y he was toxic he said cause we gen rushed him. (We got 3 gens done basically at the sametime!! Awesome clip) in the beginning n I told him cause he wasnt putting any map pressure on 3 survivors so y would I not work on a gen?? but he was playing dumb, when I asked if he had fun with a 3 man escapes he said yeaü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh I in no way shape or form was claiming you don't have tactics to still avoid the flashlight save in that situation.  I was just pointing out the hole in his logic of just face the wall.  There are times when you down them in the open and this isn't possible.  And yes you are correct in that situation that's exactly how you play it.  I just make it look like I'm going for flashlight dude (you have to sense they're around because they will be) and either hit them to chase them off before picking up or do exactly what you said and fake the focus only to immediately turn around and pick up catching them out of position so they can't make the save.
---
Not every single game, but often enough that it certainly feels like it. Usually it's because I'm not very good at the technical aspects of the game so I guess they feel extra salty when I get a lucky hit or catch up to them after missing hatchets, chainsaw sprints, blinks, etc? The most common ones are survivors assuring me they are so much better than me and I just got lucky and I should get good, which really hurts because I'm already trying my best. Sometimes I try joking around that yeah I got lucky, or that the hatch can be a bitch if they haven't found it, etc. And I get borderline abused afterward.
---
Y'know that never crossed my mind, makes a lotta sense
---
I think they give 55k per hour make sure to submit a picture with the settings open because your cloud id is there
---
I‚Äôm the guy that runs Iron Maiden on Doc so there‚Äôs no ‚Äúcheating‚Äù (_hiding = cheat /s_)
---
Crouch chainsaw with no noise
---
Hm I don't think the stealthy approach really suits Negan.
---
Honestly dude, sounds like you're just bad at the game. This game is fairly easy if you know how to mind game, run loops, and most importantly learn how to apply pressure. What I learned is that having good map pressure is almost as good as running ruin. Even some of the shitty killers are good if you simply keep survivors busy.
---
No they're not, the devs decided to wait to release it be a use of all the problems it had during the ptb.
---
Ok, I was under the impression that you didn‚Äôt know these things. Thank you for clearing things up.
---
That sucks too. Really, why should the survivors be punished for doing their objective...
---
The Monster or The Beast sounds super generic and not threatening at all for this type of game.
---
Also a little easter egg, Myers is credited as "The Shape" in the first Halloween movie
---
kiLLeRs cAnT bE tOxIc
---
I saw it in the change log tho
---
I use devour hope myself
---
Your argument is incorrect and you can make coherent sentences so you know it's 100% bullshit. Most survivors don't bring shit into game because they know they won't walk out with it anyways. Hell, most don't even bother wasting offerings because the game will be over in 3 minutes for them and they don't want to waste the slot in case they'd be better off DC'ing. You know these things to be true if you actually play the game, you're either an idiot, which doesn't seem to be the case, or completely full of shit. Which seems to be the case.
---
That wasn't only nerf man,they also made it so you can escape while having a trap on
---
Doin gens, you?
---
People really shouldn't down vote that comment. It's true. Calm spirit is glitched and it has been for a while. You die faster on the hook do to not screaming and the animation starting faster.
---
Since old calm Spirit just and only didn't startle birds. The buff indirectly glitched it from an oversight by the Developers.
---
Kate, David, Laurie, meg, jake, Feng, ace, bill, pig, plague, bubba, nurse, doctor, the other three member of the legion, Freddy are all examples of characters who have not or have barely been explored in his parodies, I‚Äôm just saying the same jokes are being repeated almost every ‚Äúepisode‚Äù and it‚Äôs getting stale
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd love to. But my Spirit is still level 1, and I barely have any teachables unlocked. I know it‚Äôs in the Shrine this week, but I‚Äôm not even close to the amount of shards I would need, and killer queues are long enough that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to level fast enough to get it.
---
PS4 is literally broken so that you don't get escape points if you enter the match results screen at the same time as killer. No player xp either.
---
WGLF is also broken.
---
First bloodhunt where I don't get under 60 second lobbies as a duo SWF. Lobbies broken in general.
---
I feel you. David is a pain in the was simply because he's an easy target and any high rank killer would notice that.
---
No0b3 looks the same as he sounds. Not being toxic just saying Incase some agree lol
---
I know about the easter egg but those names are literally supposed to fit Demogorgon unless you have better suggestions. Like I could make the same statement for the Pig because when you *hear* that it doesn't really sound that threatening.
---
Oh i didn‚Äôt know that, that‚Äôs dumb
---
You should give a look at the wiki, it might help you in stuff you don't know about
---
 it could be cool as addon for trapper where you could change a box to a mimic or place one but as a new killer it'd be trash I think
---
My world in a nutshell.
---
I don't main killer so I don't have any of their teachables. :/ I don't think I even own the Legion yet, tbh. :D
---
The most recent update related to dedicated servers that I know of.
---
https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/dedicated-servers-status-update
---
Oh I see. That is true he could do stuff with thoss other characters but maybe he doesnt know what to do with them just yet who knows.
---
Well it really depends what killer you are playing as or against and/or what build they have
---
Still, Demogorgon sounds a whole lot better and scarier. Monster and beast are so overused.
---
Very
---
Duuuude
---
leatherface for BBQ and chili, or myers because hes fun
---
The worse map to play killer on is Rotten Fields
---
Shelter Woods, Rotten Fields, Haddonfield, and the Spirit's Map.
---
Also the Red Forest. Map is too big. I love Badham Preschool though
---
For the lazy:
---
**Hag - Scarred Hand:** 
---
 ^(The cut up, severed hand of the cannibal village butcher. The trapped life essence within unlocks tremendous potential in The Hag's power.)
---
* ^(Mud Phantasms have collision.)
---
* ^(Removes The Hag's ability to teleport to her traps.)
---
* ^(Grants)¬†**^(300¬†%)**¬†^(Bloodpoints from) *^(Deviousness)* ^(Score Events.)
---
* ^(Trumps all other Add-ons.)
---
**Ghostface - "Ghostface caught on tape":**
---
 ^(A tape obtained by Olsen to write an article that terrorised Roseville.)
---
* **^(Tremendously increases)** ^(the Stalking rate when leaning from cover.)
---
* **^(Tremendously decreases)** ^(the Stalking rate when not leaning from cover.)
---
**The Wraith - "All seeing" - Blood:**

---
* ^(Unlocks hidden potential in one's Aura-reading ability. While cloaked, the Auras of Survivors within) **^(12 metres)** ^(are revealed to you.)

---
I put the in game fps counter and every time the cursor moves it goes from smooth 60fps to 10/15fps
---
I haven't had a flashlight save against my killer since the Taft administration lol.  Honestly they really are easy to counterplay for the most part.  
---
No problem at all I'm glad you made the comment.  I know there's plenty of developing killers still struggling against flashlights and your description is exactly how you counterplay them in situations where facing walls and obstacles isn't possible.  Probably good to have this advice in this thread in general in case it helps a newer player feel less frustrated in game.  Best of luck in the fog my friend.
---
You don‚Äôt have Legion??? Nonsense! Lemme tell ya, nothing is quite as stress reliving as stabbing survivors over and over again, and as long as I get one kill, I black pip! Man, Legion is my favorite killer! (_About to be second because I‚Äôm moving on to Nurse, but don‚Äôt tell Frank ;)_)
---
Excatly!! Its like survivors getting mad 4 getting hooked, it's the objective of the game!! If u cant handle losing dont play!!
---
I‚Äôm saying use it as a new teachable perk that can be unlocked on everyone, maybe with some killer that has a high connection with the entity for some reason, I don‚Äôt really think it would make sense as a trapper addon, but if not for a new killer I could see it being a Freddy addon or maybe even doc
---
He‚Äôs smart and he‚Äôs funny I‚Äôm sure if he tried something new with the other characters he could give the parodies a more interesting and fresh twist
---
omg
---
i keep saying this, why do people even bring BPS during events? we have solo offerings we can bring, Dont reward toxic killers/survivors.
---
Nope,it's the right now
---
Last night I had a game where I didn't kill anyone when the gate was opened. Finally caught someone and hooked them right beside the gate. The hooked persons friends kept trying to get her off. I got the kill with the hook and the bug with end game killed the other two. Got called a camper at the end. Why in the world would I leave the hooked when two of them are coming from different directions trying to unhook.
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
I'm glad there's finally a perk that actively encourages people to do bones. Now they really have no excuse if they're hit with the NOED.
---
I mean definately Mr. X for killer, I think Hunk would be a better survivor though.
---
It takes 4 players working together to give the killer a hard time. Sorry the game gets harder once you get to high ranks, no more free hooks on baby survivors that you can leverage into a 4k by camping and tunneling.
---
I swear the kiler victim mentaility on this sub is unbearable.
---
They could add "The master" from the strain. Would work good
---
A friend of mine already complains that blind hitboxes are broken as their two second flick on Trapper's upper back doesn't work.
---
YESSSS THIS IS BULLSH*T
---
I wasn‚Äôt saying you can‚Äôt avoid getting flashlight blinded at all, if I am not stuck in an animation I look up or away or whatever all the time which took some practice to do reflexively. Just pointing out it is not always possible to avoid the flashlight in your face to the person who commented before me. :)
---
Thanks been trying to get that perk for a minute now I hear it helps out with BPs
---
What are your GPU/CPU temperatures? If you dont know then download HWinfo and check.
---
They could give the thing a stealth ability that hid the terror radius and made their aura show up as a survivor.
---
I get a good laugh when new players come into my lobbies where I burn a cake or streamers and watching them try their heart out not realizing I‚Äôm letting them all go. It‚Äôs so cute to watch them run loops like their lives depend on it when I‚Äôm just bing bonging behind them

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think I will.‚Äù
---
I literally watched that video this morning and I agree. There isn‚Äôt a lot of variety in his perks to help him have a decent game. Maybe an endgame build would help.
---
Well, as I said. You completely ignore the killer side of things.
---
I have 500 hours played but yes, compared to the OG's of this game, that's nothing
---
Nurse on console. Coming out of blink fatigue only to see 3 survivors standing by close and teabagging.
---
Yes, as others said, there‚Äôs essentially a pool of perks that bloodwebs generate from, including the non-uniques and any teachables you unlock. If you take a pass on a perk you don‚Äôt want, it will continue to show up randomly until you have it. This ensures no one misses a perk permanently. 
---
What I recommend is taking a bit of time to read everyone‚Äôs teachables. If you see any you like, level that character until the perk is unlocked and then level your main u til you get it. Rinse and repeat. Then once you have a build you are happy with, you can get the other perks more casually. 
---
I made the mistake of unlocking all teachables in the game before I finally chose a main and it took millions of BP to get the perks I actually wanted because my ‚Äúpool‚Äù was so big. Fortunately the bloodwebs were recently reworked so grinding is faster (you used to only get one perk a web) than it used to be but it is still a lot.
---
If I had to give my advice for good teachables to start with and read up on...
---
Meg - Adrenaline
---
Dwight - Bond (my favorite perk)
---
Bill - BT and Unbreakable
---
Nea - Balanced Landing
---
David - WGLF for BP gains
---
I will say if you like playing killer, skip out on WGLF. Killer is far superior in BP grinding. Other perks are good too, these are just my favorite. I can‚Äôt recommend Bond for new and old players enough. The map awareness you get is awesome. 
---
Also, if you‚Äôre interested in a teachable, don‚Äôt be afraid to play that character a few matches to trial run it and see if you want to grind for it.
---
I usually run it with that build anyways because his speed is so sllllloooooowww
---
The sweat
---
Based off of your first sentence, I chose not to read the rest because you're assuming things no one ever said or even came close to. You're also downvoting for no reason. Thank you for not being able to handle a civil discussion, I'm sure you'll go far in life.
---
Basically just prolong the game as much as you can without losing so you max out every category. Dont let everyone escape, but dont play super sweaty and 4 man as quick as possible. Blood point boosting perks also help, like Distressing and stuff.
---
Balanced landing or lith are better exoustion perks imo, Sprint burst is just too easy to pop
---
Yeah, he'd be one of the only possible survivors to get me to main someone other than Steve/Ash.
---
BPS, BBQ, and play normally. The time you spend dragging a game out versus getting more games isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
You need to sacrifice 20 or 25 dwights (leader) and jakes (survivor).
---
Insidious works as long as you're not moving so yes.
---
Idk why that matter though as the part of the game where you care about stalking, your terror radius is already virtually nonexistent.
---
Kill 25 of a certain survivor to unlock them I think
---
Edit: Yep, scroll to the bottom of this wiki page and it tells you how to get them

You're trolling, right?

I could see this template around r/dankmemes

Noed/haunted grounds sounds good on that build imo
---
What a flashlight gamer
---
Dude I didn‚Äôt even think of that üòØ that‚Äôs an even better idea
---
I really wish there was a proximity mic when this happen.
---
I feel like you‚Äôre just a bad player, I‚Äôve gotten plenty of 4ks at high ranks being a low tier killer, and I don‚Äôt even have hags teachables
---
The past matches I've been facing have involved Urban Evasion and Sprint Burst and I legit haven't caught that Survivor the whole game, so annoying for me.
---
I mean, maybe I'm oblivious but I feel like the game is in its best state in a looong time. Hitboxes are still a joke, and dedicated servers are still under maintenance, but other than that its been really fun as of late.
---
Yeah it's really unfortunate that there's trash survivors who want to shittalk a killer that doesn't tunnel or camp. I've had to deal with campers/tunnelers in at least 75% of my survivor games during the bloodhunt. It's depressing and a large part of why I can't enjoy survivor anymore. Especially knowing that when I play killer, I go out of my way to avoid doing the shit that irritates me when I play survivor. Oh well. Both sides can be equally depressing sometimes. Just depends on the type of player you get and how lucky you are.
---
NOED for toxicity, make your choice is like haunted grounds every time a survivor unhooks another, soooo franklin's demise ;)
---
fucking constantly it's not even nat type issues at this point
---
Nice way to dc and ruin it for the killer even though he had nothing to do with it lol
---
Killers can swing over windows or small fences / walls. Even on your screen you barely made that vault, if you factor in the ping there is nothing wrong with this hit. 
---
Watch frame by frame and you'll notice that your model was practically hugging the window before getting hit.
---
Where you getting these magical percentages? Especially where are you getting 30% when you can see both doors since they're so close. I'd say that's drastically lower than 30% chance.
---
Yeah, end game is supposed to be a free for all so people dont linger in the game/hatch stand offs. Also, I can see the *never plays both sides* from your "survivors have all the power if they're multiple". No survivors dont have all the power if they're multiple. Survivors have power if they're all good and making correct choices. Play some solo survivor games and you see you get lucky if you have one smart survivor on your team instead of the normal experience where someone gets downed in 10 seconds then kills themselves on hook. Or you heal someone and they dont heal you and while running away set off all of the hag traps in the area. Your team is strong if your team is good. Playing solo survivor is hopeless past rank 10 especially with matchmaking nowadays.
---
I legit once had someone accuse me of hacking because I had NOED and downed them at the exit gates.
---
I bought leatherface/cannibal as my first killer and it's pretty easy, plus BBQ I hear is a good teachable that also gives you a bunch of bloodpoints if you hook a few people during the match.
---
I'm new, I don't know the real nuisances of this game so I only camp if the survivor is toxic or if they basically spent the whole game hiding and not helping their teammates.
---
Plague's map. It's so big unless you're nurse or billy it's hard to pressure gens.
---
Just play.
---
It is what it is I guess
---
I feel you but idc bout bloodpoints at this point because I have every single perk on ash...I was pissed though
---
Thanks!
---
You can't disable messages from strangers on ps4?
---
You're using sheer numbers your argument makes no sense. I was giving an example.
---
What matters and why the devs released the statistics as chances of survival is because that's how it matters.
---
If you want the amount of solo survives vs swf survives to matter you have to adjust for population. Thats why in statistics you hear phrases like "per capita" because they are adjusting rates because rarely is counting by sheer number helpful.
---
I downvoted because your argument does not work. Second what I did in my first sentence was give an example using arbitrary numbers using the logic of your argument.
---
And last you choose not to read the rest because of my first sentence but reply that i was uncivil because I'm assuming you read the "hurr durr" so you did read beyond the first sentence that or you don't know what a sentence is.
---
And ohh no you got downvoted your fake internet points are hurting they really matter in the real world. If you are this hurt over arbitrary points on a website you sure are going to go far in life.
---
Also at this time you have -2 on your comment... you start at +1 if I downvoted you would be at 0 so clearly others disagree with you as well.
---
Ngl with that short hair it‚Äôs kinda fitting
---
Axe Boy fro Identity V Is Kid And Still a killer
---
Did you watch frame by frame I‚Äôm already over and he swings after I was already out, what are you even talking about?
---
legion completely useless power and 100% m1 killer
---
Dr. Thunder is the best generic soda hands down
---
Survivors have all the power IN THE ENDGAME if there‚Äôs multiple. And those percentages are pulled from my games as solo survivor. Believe it or not, I‚Äôm a survivor main that doesn‚Äôt bitch about how unfair it is for survivor. All I can say is that you need to ‚Äúgit gud scrub‚Äù
---
Ever heard of the availability heuristic? That‚Äôs the fallacy you‚Äôre committing right now. Basically, our minds are wired to remember the bad things or the times where something went wrong because then we can learn from it (except for you idiots that would rather bitch about it instead). You are more likely to remember the time that you lost, that doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre more likely to lose.
---
So survivors complaining about needing meta perks against meta killers is ok, but killers complaining about having to play meta killers against meta survivor perks is unbearable killer victim mentality?
---
I mean it's a nice addition, but there are many other perks that are way more efficient than Inner Strenght. Spending 10-8 seconds in a locker you could've done about 10% of a generator which could become essential in the late game.
---
Edit: Also wasting time by actively searching for a totem is inefficient as hell and might even get you straight onto a hook if you don't pay enough attention.
---
I agree. There's also nothing wrong with tunneling.
---
I literally mean going to all the totem spots I know and seeing if the ruin is there lol
---
Do you not know that if Killers quit because of the game being survivor sided for so many years the game would inevitably have awful queues worse than the already bad ones.
---
This is just Quentin's normal. He is my highest spiritual self
---
That would be awesome
---
Ends on the 30th, probably around noon
---
Today I believe
---
18-19 hours it says in-game.
---
Ok I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at the flashlight blind attempt but good plays regardless lol
---
That is true. It's one if the few that can taste as their counterpart.
---
Ruin is essential to run. It slows down the game so the killer gets to actually play. Boo-hoo you spend 20 extra seconds on a gen. If you don‚Äôt run ruin you‚Äôll get gen rushes and the game will be over in less than 5 minutes. Killers want a long game, it makes it more likely that they get a 4K.
---
You better practise.
---
Useful perk when they try to do that to you
---
When Killers lose they can only blame themselves. 
---
Indivdual Survivors can lose for absolutely no fault of their own.
---
Don't forget Madness Tier up.
---
Also after enough zaps (And a few Tier ups) you stop getting score events. 
---
The score events hardly help me. All I know is someone Tiered Up but have no idea where. For shocks the Doctor still laughs. 
---
IMHO against Doctor Calm Spirit completely fucks him unless he's using the addons that reveal auras upon tier ups or the aura illusions at tier 2. (3 without a certain addon)
---
Try it in KYF sometime. Get some friends or randoms, and try a match where you're Doctor and nobody is allowed to run Calm Spirit, and then a second match where all 4 survivors have to run Calm Spirit. Doctor's ability is almost useless against Calm Spirit besides using it for stall.
---
IMHO Calm Spirit isn't that bad of a perk esp against Spies From The Shadows, although hardly anyone runs SFTS these days. I've experimented with it a few times and SFTS isn't complete garbage but Whisper's arguably is better. SFTS at least is an unexpected perk (It used to be meta back in the day) and nobody will even think you're using it.
---
OH BOY! Those are statistically significant then if the population is coming from 1 person! I'm glad you're making these wonderful contributions to research and academia. Did you sit down with your mom to work through those calculations or did you get them all by yourself?
---
vault master myers mode activated
---
Nah, he slows down the game just a little bit. Im Playing with him in purple ranks and its fun because everyone underestimates you lmao
---
Frenzy should be infinitely long and he should be faster tho
---
Do you guys have your gamma really low or something? I love it! Gens are so close, putting pressure on the map is easy. No infinites. No jungle gyms. Almost every loop has a mind game.
---
On Xbox, there's been a trend of killers refusing to break pallets. Even if it means being looped around a downed pallet for 30+ seconds.
---
Yes I just posted about this it‚Äôs so annoying
---
Don‚Äôt bully my Quentin &gt;:(
---
frenzy doesn't slow the game down at all people still do gens with deep wounds on
---
Killer main playing a P3 Claudette? Interesting
---
Was expecting a leatherface tbh
---
They become onehit tho
---
I think all coldwinds are bad.
---
AFAIK you still cause a noise notification if someone fails a healing skill check on you. Really weird because Calm Spirit even prevents the scream from Make Your Choice and Iron Maiden as well as screaming when hooked. It'd be a decent buff.
---
lol watching  Brundlefly  puke all over a survivor while they melt into goo would be naaaaasty.
---
Ruin is just too good to leave out. If you don't use it the Survivors are free to do gens super fast. Ruin slows it down a lot and honestly makes it easier to win. Ruin is such a top tier perk that if you switch it out you are almost handing the survivors a free win.
---
Maybe use haunted grounds?
---
I actually partially kinda sorta agree to this. As a killer main, it is almost mandatory to run ruin or else the survivors will gen rush and win rather easily. However, i do see where you are coming from and it is rather fun to run other perks other than ruin. But it is similar in a sense to why every survivor runs DS and Borrowed Time you feel me? There is nothing inherently wrong with it, but it does become stale after a while.
---
well also the fact that cold dirt and Joey's mixtape is pretty much necessary so they don't run away because of a 4 second cooldown stun
---
You get more points for chasing and slapping them, than afking for one kill..
---
Those might be glitched lobby‚Äôs just leave and requeue  I get into games in like 20 seconds for survivor (killer is a different story)
---
Its not only the experienced survivor. Its the game. This game is toxic. Everybody blames ecerything if the game is out of control
---
Why do you feel you have to make a post about it? If you hate Ruin that much, don't run it.I play survivor too and if a killer uses Ruin, I push through it.
---
A lot of killers run ruin because its a good perk. Some people think gens go too fast so they use it to slow the game down. I get that its not all that fun to play against but this is one of those instances where you do have to "get good"
---
the *struggle*
---
Huh, you are right, didn't even think about that first point!
---
That sounds like a cool power! :)
---
Understandably pissed
---
It used to be common to try and crouch walk past the killer after blinding them. When the killer could see again, there'd be no scratch marks or survivor in sight. The counter was swinging, so if they tried to walk past you, you'd hit them.
---
I love it
---
I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôre rank 14??? Maybe 12????
---
take my upvote damnit
---
i actually really thought about that but at the same time i dont wanna lose this offering lmao
---
im shaking why are his toes so long.
---
Gen rushing isn't really an issue here? That's the objective of the game. The most efficient way of doing so just happens to be working on a gen together, bringing toolboxes / prove thyself ECT ECT. Thing is, camping the hook is not the most efficient way to win as killer. All you're doing is securing 1 kill, but giving up at least 2 gens to do it. Even if one person comes for the save with borrowed and 2 work on gens, you're still wasting time. Hook the survivor, take a brief moment to kick nearby gens / pallets, then fuck off and find a new target.
---
An addition i thought of after posting this comment so I edit it in: 
---
I also don't care about the blood hunt in this. Camping is still not efficient with or without the bloodhunt. However, during the bloodhunt you're literally just hurting yourself even more. missing out on chase, deviousness, and sacrifice points you could be getting on other survivors while you stare at a guy on the hook. As annoying as tunneling is, if you know someone has already been hooked and you have a choice on who to chase, removing people quickly is efficient to win as killer. Doing it by staring at them on the hook doesn't really help you much.
---
Sometimes players will try to sneak past them so it actually works sometimes, but most of the time it doesn‚Äôt...
---
Yes, it's a waste though. With M&amp;A and dead rabbit you make your terror radius so small it's like insidious but you can move.
---
**YAHUGH IM GONNA DO IT AGAIN**
---
What edit? The one where I removed a typo?
---
And you didn‚Äôt say percentages, yet you‚Äôre disagreeing with mine. I‚Äôm trying to point out that you‚Äôre walking in here going all ‚Äúoww, it hurts my FEELINGS! I FEEL like it‚Äôs SOOO unfair! It has to be the game because I FEEL that I‚Äôm too good at this game for it to be ME!‚Äù Like, fuck right off. I‚Äôm bringing actual data and you‚Äôre just bitching, don‚Äôt start acting superior. I‚Äôm not gonna bother continuing this thread since it‚Äôs turned into a way for you vent your anger at your sad existence without actually considering any points. Have fun with the ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù (HEAVY sarcasm) endgame, you absolute moron
---
Theres 0 reason. The game doesnt focus on those things because it's just a game about murder. Not only would it most likely trigger controversy, no matter how stupid, it isnt needed. And I'm not just some homohpbe saying this, I have multiple gay friends, got nothing against LGBTQ
---
Yeah but most coldwinds you can at least see the survivors.
---
I agree, ran into 3 NOEDs in a row yesterday, kinda pain in the ass.
---
But that's also the problem with hex totems. If survivors only look for the hex and their team is constantly dying in the background, which is why you should always yeet through Ruin, then the game will be over in less than a couple of minutes with 4-5 gens left.
---
Noted. lol
---
Yeah 12. Been higher though and playing optimally is often boring. And basically pointless during the bloodhunt anyway. Before this clip, I pretty much knew the killer was close and never should've been closing the portal anyway. 
---
Sometimes I just want to spice it up.
---
For all we know any of the current characters could be LGBTQ
---
Also a character's sexual preference doesn't really need to be highlighted in a game like this
---
Because it's a means of winning provided to you for doing absolutely nothing. It's not earned whatsoever.
---
I was accused of wallhacks because I used the pigs dash to round a corner and down a injured Dwight hiding near the exit gate.
---
He must not have know I have ears too?
---
I'd suggest watching Otzdarva if you want to play Trapper, he's the best out there and has some great analysis videos
---
Hahaha the first time I saw something like this was last night when a Billy was flying through the air over my head. I thought it was some shitty ping or something haha.
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
I could see 2nd and 3rd page being used together for an insane amount of map pressure.
---
Monitor, Corrupt, Pop, Thrilling
---
To be fair I‚Äôd rather dc and let my other teammate get to the door phase then to have them die trying to unhook my anyways this game was going on for way too long
---
So is noed but we're not gonna talk about that. 
---
Also, you're assuming that survivor did nothing. How do you know that survivor wasn't busting their ass and happened to be the last one left?
---
Who's to say lgbtq looks any different from anyone else? Some of the current characters might already be.
---
The corn isn‚Äôt even that crazyyyyyyy
---
**RAUGHR STROOONGER**
---
Oof must have really triggered a sore spot there big guy...
---
Basically it comes down to what does an LGBTQ person look like? The answer is generally everybody else and in all varieties. Throwing a character in drag would just result in a lot of needless controversy and doesn‚Äôt actually do anything to help advance causes of diversity and inclusion.
---
Also a cross dressing dude is not necessarily a member of the LGBTQ community..... -_-
---
any lore we have through events and such currently is on the DBD wiki. beyond that the only in game lore we can access as of now is character stories.
---
May I know how you became this petty?
---
*Sees Meg being chased by Cujo in the distance*
---
Also your post title and the body of your post are conflicting.
---
Doesn't it work against infectious fright?
---
Ash actually spawns with his boomstick and chainsaw hand!
---
Splinters are offerings that let you try out a killer you don't own, and without any perks or addons you have equipped. Think of it as a free trial
---
"haha, i'm really happy consoles don't get bill but i do on steam!"
---
it would make me happy if this was changed now u/Meoang
---
:)
---
I'm British. We're always this petty
---
Edit: also, DBD toxicity
---
there should be a cursed images version of dbd
---
My queue times at red ranks as killer (on pc) are arround 5 minutes.  
---
I don't really care about that.  
---
But I still want to downrank.  
---
It's one thing to wait for matches.  
---
It's another one to be forced to only play top tier killers while mostly facing SWFs with 2+ insta heals.   
---
You'll get 3 games like these in a row and hate your life.
---
I heard that he has no legs but I suppose he also said that his face fell off
---
Calm spirit sucks because you get no screaming animation when hooked, meaning you have less time on the hook.
---
Instead of kindred run selfcare
---
Play as survivor then?
---
Dodged a bullet
---
Trap is good in almost all situations, expect maps with big buildings and against SWF, SWF completely denies Trapper as a character
---
Yes I get ruin is a great and essential perk for killer I'm not mad at that, I'm mad I can't find small game to counter that perk and it's frustrating as a survivor right now.
---
Killers already make 2x the amount of BP than survivors (which is wack) I'm just trying to enjoy this bloodhunt, but ruin is ruining (see what I did XD) my fun right now.
---
P.S. to the killers that have let me escape these past couple days you're the real MVP
---
I believe they mean non liscenced, but its phrased oddly
---
oh shit thanks so much! i will try this, tyty
---
Did u make the chainsaw? It's cool.
---
It totally is, I‚Äôve been playing for about two years. I‚Äôve seen many changes and additions, not all were great but sometimes it‚Äôs two steps forward one step back.
---
Makes me sad we wont get jason in dbd
---
Got it at Party City lmao
---
the archives are going to be a lore centered area added to the game. heres a youtube link timestamped to the bit on the archives:
---
[https://youtu.be/HOtNQ60QaB8?t=138](https://youtu.be/HOtNQ60QaB8?t=138)
---
I always think it‚Äôs funny when Legion is against a Bill or two or Ash. Combat veteran or two and/or a super bad ass vs ... some teenager with a tiny ass knife. Wonder who wins that one lmao.
---
Open-handed sucks. What's your playstyle exactly?
---
Lately I've had fun running Plunderers, Ace in the Hole, Small Game, and Borrowed Time. That's my, do everything but gens build.
---
I also like to have an unhooking build where I use Botany Knowledge, We'll Make It, Borrowed Time, and usually whatever 4th perk, maybe Resilience.
---
One word
---
Huntress.
---
Huntress gets a gun
---
That's a really shitty killer.
---
Lmao I could've written the exact same about my playstyle except I don't give a fuck about NOED, if I die, oh well, it's easy to pip as survivor anyways, even in red ranks.
---
Best looking map but horrible to play on
---
First off, referring to Crossdressers or anyone who fits under the term of transgender is offensive as fuck and transphobic.
---
Kindred is great against facecampers or campers in general as it lets the rest of the team know not to go for the save and just do gens. They can get most of the gens totally completed by the time the full hook sacrifice process is done.
---
At first glance I thought it was a b u f f Spirit
---
I hope you're joking dude
---
I just have a problem with killers with short weapons. I just cant tell if theyre about to hit me or not.
---
I used to be named Cult of Kindred and run it all the time. Perhaps it's time to reclaim that name. 
---
(Yes, copying panda. )
---
Make it jump into the top of trees to look down on survivors. Or make it able to climb up walls to gain height so it can see, and perhaps make it able to leap off of heights.
---
You sound like you're trying to convince yourself, with all this talk of how you "have gay friends". First off, it wouldnt be that hard, and what controversy could be conjured up about it? 
---
There could be a bit of misplaced innocence and capitalism in what you're saying, but claiming you have gay friends sounds just like "I got black friends"
---
crossdressing isnt inherently LGBTQ but ok
---
Considering 90% of people complaining about hitboxes have no clue of what they are talking about, "how long have we asked" doesn't mean much.
---
I'm a Gorgon Main
---
Edit (Twice): some typos and extra info
---
Don‚Äôt think this would be fair or work at all. The survivor would just stand near the door (or at a loop near the door if there‚Äôs a timer) and wait for the killer to hit them, loop near the door a little, and run out immediately. It would basically create an unfair standoff where the killer would stare at the uninjured survivor until the survivor tried to open the gate, in which case the killer would just grab the survivor. If the killer doesn‚Äôt hit the survivor, the timer runs out and they die.
---
I think it‚Äôs fine as it is now. The survivor plays stealthy to open the door right after the killer checks the door. The survivor gets caught? Well, you have some time to try and outplay the killer to escape
---
In the end it‚Äôs a team game. If you‚Äôre the only one alive, unless your team got camped or DCed/gave up, there‚Äôs probably a better way you guys could‚Äôve played and you should be penalized for being the only one left.
---
It keeps stable at 60¬∫C and none goes over 70% performance wise.
---
Well, honestly, I also always go back and try to do my best, but also care for my life so I get out in time.
---
The average players, as I already stated, are not red ranks. You can't base the game play off the people who live on this shit. Average players seem to be 16-12 because they don't do this for a living.
---
It's not completely ruin I'm frustrated with I'm also frustrated I can't find small game
---
No :)
---
Oppenheimer
---
Thats because the short weapons stretch to the length of a standard weapon when attacking otherwise the short killers would have a default nerf to attack range
---
The ghost face?
---
Sometimes his voice is really annoying to me in videos and streams I don‚Äôt know why. It just feels so vanilla, I can‚Äôt really explain
---

---
That's a way better name than what I came up with. Hope devs see this.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt need a buff; I can get 4K with him, but the time it takes to set up and how folks can utterly deny you any ability to catch anyone..without even equipping a perk like against Doc or Hag...is absurd.
---
And why can he step in his own traps? Ridiculous
---
Just realized the survivor pushes the knife out of their ribs then Michael drives it deeper into their chest.
---
That's actually amazing.
---
Dang it
---
Don't have any unfortunately
---
Yes the "team" failed. But you're making it seem so black and white when I know for a FACT that you're aware of all the different circumstances there are. Stop playing ignorant.
---
God I hope that‚Äôs unintentional he‚Äôs strong enough already lol
---
Yah i was trying to think of something that related to the playstyle already in the game but honestly i think thats the problem. Guess ill just get my blood points and die lol.
---
YOU DIDN'T thats the most annoying killer in game...
---
I used that as an "I'm not homophobic" because thats a common argument against people that say no to anything LGBTQ. And have you looked at the media? Once LGBTQ becomes a thing I  violent games, media who dont like the game will use that to attack it. 
---
Theres also just no reason to it. For all we know one of our already existing survivors is LGBTQ.
---
I once saw autoaim go up towards the sky after a just sacrificed survivor. It has weird priorities sometimes.
---
I don't think these people think things through all that much.
---
I just got accused of face camping. Three survivors left with one gen. Hooked one, gates got powered immediately after all the way across the map, had T3 Myers primed because I knew at least one of the two remaining survivors would come back. Sure enough, one did and I hit T3 and downed them. Maybe this does make me a dirty face camper. Tough shit. I'm not letting survivors go, period.
---
Also early in the game, running BBQ I hooked someone and saw no auras. Also heard crows and grunts around me. I did not leave the hook vicinity. What am I suppose to do? Run across the map and let all 4 survivors do fuck all?
---
After the match i mined enough salt for weeks. Called me everything and threatened to report me. One also said they recorded it and were going to send it to dev's. I told them to please send it because I did nothing wrong. One of them also told the others to report me for a lag switch. I lol'd pretty hard on that one.
---
She just wants to shower you with love
---
no meg is an athlete so she always has sprint burst
---
I think that‚Äôs too strong. He starts with two traps in inventory. That is a good enough buff. If you want to take it one step further, change sabotage timer from 3 minutes to 2 before respawn.
---
You sound like a little bitch. I hope I get to play against you. I‚Äôd camp you all the live long day just to make you whine and cry like the little bitch you are!
---
ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£üòÇüòÖ
---
Lol those chases were pretty silly. I have those moments with myers a lot haha.
---
Immersion
---
"Only kills those who get on their bad side" that doesn't really matter, and the entity would force them to kill just like everyone else
---
Almost no one in the community uses whatever argument you bring up unless its actually true. And sometimes its a problem with why people say no to whats being proposed. Sometimes it aint that hard, amd sometimes those people actually are homophobic.
---
Literally bubbas mori
---
You wanted these weird ass freak comments didn't you?
---
Chad vs Virgin
---
Yah when i read that, i was thinking. Has this person played killer?
---
It's hard to make a good offerings for survivors :/. But I runno. 1 moar hook needed to kill you  maybe or something
---
Since when were any of these underrated?
---
Absolutely!
---
Regardless, you just played a "I have gay friends" card to excuse yourself, which aint aomething you would have to do if you felt comfortable with what you were saying
---
I have a whole different experience. I can pip with killer to rank 1, but as a survivor, I'm still struggling to get to rank 1, it seems impossible to go past rank 3
---
Because he has a loud personality, and that's really the staple of his character. All of the other killers don't talk nearly as much and they're all generally faceless (by that I mean they are deformed or are covering their face up, basically dehumanized). Negan would be a normal guy with a face, personality, voice, and clearly-defined character, which I don't think works that well for killers. If anything, he'd make a better survivor.
---
If I'm not mistaken doesn't the pounce outspeed sb? Or is that only with speed buffs?
---
God I would LOVE Chromeskull as a killer. Nobody has seen those movies but damn would it be cool.
---
Also Harry Warden.
---
Dam those are some nice feet
---
Yeah I see where you're coming from, but I feel like survivors perks are far more varied I think.
---
I wouldn't know from the killer side how it is but it's annoying as a survivor.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dazx09/can_they_please_fix_this_bug_because_this_is/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It's the opposite for me.  
---
As survivor I'll be listening to music, don't give a fuck about anything inside the game and still pip.  
---
As killer I'll allways have to try, especially if I play something weak and my enemies are suddenly SWF tryhards.
---
I never fuck with Michael for this reason.
---
The generic came first tho
---
Haha, yeah you did the right thing. They could have just left.
---
The matches I have gone against were 100% camping. Me running all the way across the map to see them spinning on the spot hitting the hooked person.
---
I'm a rank 12 and my friends are 11 to 14
---
No sabotage is a crap function and actually needs a heavy buff. I think the sabo time needs to take longer but the sabotage itself needs to last much longer.
---
I dont mean the general dbd community, I mean outside media sources who disagree with dbd in a political way. If an LGBTQ member was added, the media could directly target that, tarnishing DbDs reputation
---
Meg fucking runs into the killer at the speed of light and explodes them.
---
Lmao what is that guy‚Äôs problem
---
Now this is what I'm talking about
---
LF just use windows and Freddy try to stay awake.
---
Did you even read my argument or are you just hetr to fight with people. I said it to not fight with people over whether or not I was homophobic and then you called me homophobic for it
---
I absolutely hate that we‚Äôre not getting a new map with every DLC. Most of the time the new maps added are just remakes of old maps (ie Clown and Plague), which also sucks.
---
I highly doubt we‚Äôre going to get an original killer without a map to go along with it so I have a feeling it is going to be a licensed killer without any map.
---
As a p3 Claudette I can confirm this
---
I thought the same thing but with tvs already scattered across the map, and instead of teleporting she would quietly crawl out of them.
---
I don't have a clue. It was really weird. I thought we were just joking around at first, but he legitimately tried to call me out as a liar for no reason
---
19 hours or so.
---
Im sorry, this just seems like excuse hopping, media sourcea who disagree with DBD politically??? Like who??????
---
Seriously, wtf
---
You seem to be the only one who needs every small detail spelled out to understand the question. Most people can understand the figurtive aspect of language.
---
Why would you sell it just to buy it again lol
---
Im not calling you homophobic, im just calling you out on what you said.
---
No. I mean that's what they did with ghostface.
---
This thing has a short dash that instadowns you. So its basically the Bubba normally
---
Fredward Scissorhand
---
insidious is fun tho, people never use it so nobody expects it
---
especially if you aren‚Äôt camping a hook with it
---
Ah shit
---
I had a t1 myers pull me off a gen *while I was using my free hand to sip coffee*.  It was a bad time for me.
---
He cannot be wrong in any fashion, even over something super minuscule that had he just said "oops, my bad!" no one would have cared. But now we will remember the mistake and embarrassment.
---
Freddy and leather face are my most played killers. For Freddy literally as soon as you get into dream world get out of it. You're only giving Freddy buffs if he's using add ons. They slow everything like healing and repair. And you can't get hit with dream pallets or snares.
---
For leatherface, hug the fuck out of walls and trees when he chainsaws. I find it so hard to not get caught on walls and trees when survivor do it unintentionally.
---
Hope this helped.
---
lol, googled it
---
"It's no secret among the Dead By Daylight community that the Legion is a strong killer."
---
K then
---
it looks like shit tbh, I was hoping it would be Resident Evil Outbreak but in HD
---
She is also weilding Plague's incense burner because God is dead
---
I dont know any direct medias, I dont follow a lot of media sources, but there are always media's that disagree with violent games. Even if there arent any at the moment big enough to do anything, theres no reason to ake the risk.
---
So you're just here to pick a fight because why not?
---
i wish they would at least let you use, say, their 3 default perks at tier 1 or something. completely perk-less feels so bad and definitely dont make me want to buy the killer, which i assume is the goal of these
---
The Chad Harrington vs. The Virgin Smith
---
People play huntress like its call of duty, so I mean they‚Äôre not wrong
---
When you have the spirit daily lol
---
NO!
---
wow this happened alot to me (as Myers)
---
oh god what did you just say
---
Clown has the best perks.
---
I mean kinda he was an asshole coming about it but you if it‚Äôs clear you can‚Äôt be saved personally I‚Äôd kill myself so at least someone could live or I guess we‚Äôd both die trying
---
In the FAQ a few days ago the devs said it was intentional
---
It would increase chances of toxicity because everyone would either camp for hatch or camp hook to secure their respective goal.
---
Oh god nooooo
---
I‚Äôm so jealous of that mask. Barely got my Michael to lvl 50..
---
Yep
---
Left Behind + Open Handed = ok
---
better sprint burst away, faster then my hatchet
---
And it's much worse than not getting the effect 
---
He can also moonwalk like old legion to make u bleed out if u have bleed out timer
---
That just strips BP away from everyone, including the killer. :/
---
New perk: Unbalanced Landing  
---
Upon landing, break your fucking ankles and suffer from the ***Exposed*** Status effect for the rest of the match.
---
Yeah i dont remember entity taking the items in blood web?
---
Like I‚Äôm really happy he‚Äôs good now but like cmon lol.
---
r/croppingishard
---
It¬¥s hard to say. In a solo situation there is no reason how you should know if the hatch is there (besides randomly finding it before in the match and remembering its location), you also didn¬¥t have a way of knowing if HE knows that and if he found the hatch (sometimes it can be hard to find in a chase even if it¬¥s close)
---
Then again, if you were only 2 people left and you were struggling on the hook, seeing that the killer is already chasing the other dude *on the other side of the map*...I would just kill myself. There is very little chance of him actually being able to save me as the killer can chase him endlessly, and I would give the last dude the shot on finding the hatch.
---
You're talking about the ps4 special edition
---
Eh that dude isnt entitled to hatch not like u knew he was by hatch. Plus you get struggle points if your gonna die on hook might as well get the extra points.
---
How does one bait a pickup?
---
Why would there be controversy if the main man Jeepers Creepes be added into the game?
---
Well put
---
Oh baby, it's funnier cause I made this one to call out a friend who does exactly that so often lmfao
---
I like it, the only problem is that the 3rd perk is a worse cruel limits.
---
A graphical glitch which displays egc wrong, though this is the first time I've seen it happen to someone not t-bagging, so good on you
---
You must be the 1% of people that didnt like his show, imagine how indignificant your numbers are.
---
dont listen to them...struggle points are struggle points...i believe they r working on buffing the points u get while struggling...personally ill let go if i am 100% sure the other survivor has hatch...
---
I didnt know freddy got buffed in dreamstate, thank you so much for that! and the leatherface tip too, very appreciated, have a lovely night.
---
was leveling up my demogorgon. got bbq to level 2 and 3 ebony moris out of 3 levels. i ran one of them the next game, and got a 4k. made my day as i mori'd them.
---
I can't even..
---
Asking about the endgame collapse: How the hell does it work?
---
"Please! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
---
I never saw the original but I loved the remake, I'm sure if they add this Chapter Original or Remake it would be good
---
Yeah as a killer main they are so shet
---
You can do as you please. If he‚Äôs entitled to the point he demands people to kill themselves for him, he should play SWF only. In this situation I‚Äôd still have unhooked you with my borrowed time instead of letting you die.

Sam is a demon that looks like a child, so he ~~might~~ get a pass
---
Edit: also if we were to get the killer clowns from outer space I would legitimately have a panic attack those fuckers scare the hell outta me.
---
When the number of survivors dead + number of generators done = 5, the hatch spawns
---
You‚Äôll get better, GorillaTittty :)
---
Im here because you gave a dumb reason and brought up an unnecessary point
---
I don't understand the comparison. Is it because its 4 survivors vs 1 killer? The gameplay is so much different.
---
So normally after the exit gate/hatch opens/closes a two minute timer starts. If the timer runs out the Entity kills you. But for some reason right now the timer is buggy.
---
He really isn‚Äôt that bad if you have good map knowledge and trap placement. Just takes time to predict where survivors will be. Some buffs would be nice nonetheless. I think you shouldn‚Äôt have to walk around picking them up since he‚Äôs the only trap killer who has to
---
His power is that he doesn't need to take you to the hook.  Survivors must run up to the killer to unhook you.  Damn camper.
---
We love players who need to use all the tryhard stuff during the events.
---
This happened to me on Freddy... I chose the latter of the two
---
that blinding tho
---
Says the one who has provided no evidence to disprove any of my points
---
This will get me banned because behaviour interactive doesn‚Äôt want everyone to know that bubba is better then spirit.
---
That is true, but I feel like this is more the general gameplay style. Since you're alone as a killer, you constantly have to keep yourself busy with something. As a survivor, you have a lot of downtime.
---
The reason that lead to me saying that killer rank 1 is easier and more concistent is because you're kind of in control of how the game goes. Not saying that winning is up to you, but when you compare it to survivor, if you get tunneled or camped, there is nothing you can do, if you end up as the gen jockey, there is a good chance you'll depip. Your pip is often too dependent of the killer.
---
Also, if your goal is to pip as killer, you can just play nurse and be done with it, as a survivor, you don't really have a guaranteed way of pipping.
---
I hope you kind of get where I'm comming from with this.
---
But no matter which side has an easier way of pipping, I hate the current pipping system and would really like to see some changes.
---
I want wolfman killer
---
Mr. X is scarier than any killer in DBD.
---
I wouldn't want DBD graphics ruining Leon's beautiful face
---
Struggling when there is one guy left is basically spiteing them. Particularly if hed been found you should have let go
---
Surely it should be the raccoon police station? Much more atmospheric and it‚Äôs big enough tbh. However ik people don‚Äôt like indoor maps. Or the sewers?
---
I thought someone was gonna give a plain response but damn you did good thank you
---
Can we have Tony Hawk in dbd?
---
BHVR: we already do
---
DBD:
---
Fuck ‚Äòem and Mori everyone. It‚Äôs a game not the bible.
---
it's already happened lol
---
Oh yeah.... I remember this. I know what you did last candyman.
---
I believe she's everyone's wife
---
See the last chapter had an indoor map so I figured they‚Äôd wanna change it up a bit ya know ü§î I love the police station but I feel like the layout of it would be too complex
---
Weird, I got a message from RepostSentinel about this post.
---
you can't start running the second you go down, you have to do the dying animation first
---
Hell yeah üòÇüòÇ
---
Yes I think so. It activates when you heal one full health state on another survivor. So it should work would be my guess
---
GIMME A FUCKING GREMLIN GODDAMIT
---
I get really bad anxiety when I play survivor. Plus, all of them are level 1, too. I can probably try it though.
---
Yeah I feel that, it‚Äôs the panic especially with EW3.  Here my brain just pooped.
---
They probably have console which comes with everyone up to huntress
---
Yeah.. Thats what i thought when i saw this movie for the first time.
---
But you have to judge your aim because its not like Hillbilly or Nurse where you can control the area you Pounce you basically pounce in a straight line
---
I like to see what they can come up with I still really like the clown I think his backstory is kind of basic but I love his design
---
His creator is a child rapist. In order to be added bhvr would have to pay him money and people wouldn't like that (myself included)
---
How is the game on the switch?
---
Yeah, itd work kind of like monitor and abuse; out of a chase hes invisible and in a chase hes uncloaked
---
Servers aren‚Äôt out yet bud it‚Äôs still killer hosted
---
That's the first time I've seen it happen at that ling of a time period.
---
R.I.P Legion
---
Pig head fits him more than it fits to Amanda
---
That's just the prestige.
---
Most people don't know about conditional probability.
---
If your solution for a game that relies on player numbers is "git gud" then you have no concept of long term maintenance. That's how games die. Balance out for the casuals and find something to keep the dead-hard obsessed happy separately.
---
I got Adam first but all four are good options
---
Swing Chains + Red Paintbrush are probably your best bet if you‚Äôre trying to give yourself a good shot at getting the Adept.
---
Bar that, if you‚Äôre confident in your ability to catch survivors/mindgame them to hell and back again, then the Class Photo add-on paired with any add-on that reduces the cooldown of the gen teleport ability might be worth a try too. I guarantee everyone will scatter the second those gens start spewing blood, so that alone will buy you a lot of time.
---
Also, controversial opinion alert, but the dream snares are infinitely better than dream pallets so I‚Äôd recommend going with them too. Makes looping borderline impossible for survivors if you place them down effectively.
---
Either way, good luck friend! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have the Adept Freddy achievement done and dusted in now time at all. üëåüèª
---
You vs the guy she told you not to worry about
---
Pay attention.
---
That's when you bring a mori
---
That's why mom Steve takes care of us.
---
You're right my bad. I'm sleep-starved.
---
Pretty racist
---
Needs more Bateman
---
Unfortunately it would be a lot like old legion where you could moonwalk and get a lot more use out of your power. It would be a little too strong for things like gen grabs and ending loops more quickly
---
So you should be ranked 20 survivor and ya know how killers work so you should be okay mate.
---
I run nurse, hag, spirit and GF around rank 3-6. I run ruin on everything but nurse. However if I see more than 2 toolboxes I swap sloppy for ruin on my nurse just to try and eat their toolboxes. Ruin is just too useful for snowballing not to use. Even if it's found in 60 seconds it still usually keeps 1 down 1 or 2 searching for it and one guy gen tapping like an idiot for that 60 seconds. That's huge in high ranks.
---
I know where this is going (Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Have others been getting paired with grey ranks lately? I seem to be getting lots of em as teammates
---
fuming mixtape should be reworked to a cooldown add on better than cold dirt
---
Weird. It might be a bug. So just heal normally for now I guess.
---
f
---
I mean I'd be pissed too if the second to last guy was struggling when the Killer is on me and I know where the hatch is, but not to the point where I'd bash the guy. Don't listen to him.
---
They must be some rank 20s
---
On my 65 inch it looks awful, my 45 inch runs much better but still at 25 or so FPS. Portable is a solid 30 FPS with no lag and runs great. Can play well as survivor and killer on portable.
---
If you wanna play docked stick with it, after a few hours the low frames become second nature, but it‚Äôs a learning curve in the beginning for sure.
---
The dead cant die
---
I thought this joke was dead
---
I‚Äôve also seen some nurses who have 4Ked on switch as well, super impressive if you ask me!
---
This can be applied to playing any killer that isnt names nurse, spirit, billy, or hag.
---
Was expecting Billy or Leatherface.
---
You mean milked for 2 months
---
oh shit you are right
---
Congrats!  I would've had some Prestige on my Ghost Face but Gods damn, got too many good Perks and already have most Perks on him now xD!  I'll probably Prestige my Michael, Freddy or Leatherface first.  Mostly as they don't have cosmetics aaaand to jus get the Trophies for Prestiging a character xP.  I hate the idea of giving up earned Perks and add-ons IE wasted Bloodpoints...if Prestige meant we got a small bonus to BP earned then I wouldn't care as much xD
---
Not to mention chase latency spikes, causing you to either become completely confused or run into a wall. Dedicated servers better be real /s
---
This is true, I think it would be interesting idea for a wraith rework. Not that exactly, but possibly something similar
---
&gt;If your solution for a game that relies on player numbers is "git gud" then you have no concept of long term maintenance. 
---
And yet this game continues to grow. I don't really see how getting good is an issue as a requirement to do well in a game. If you were a casual that played Fifa, you'd get annihilated by anyone that plays semi regularly, that doesn't mean the game should hand you wins or give you more coins, you need to get good at a game to get rewards.
---
&gt;Balance out for the casuals and find something to keep the dead-hard obsessed happy separately.
---
As I said, you don't need to be obsessed to climb rank in this game. Play well and over time it's certainly easy to reach purple ranks (where the game is actually really well balanced) on both sides. Getting to red ranks is a challenge.
---
I like it tbh, even when I lose it's still super fun to play, but depending of the killer you are screwed
---
they're not gonna ban a certain ip just because they play like dicks
---
you mean ginger Dwight?
---
Continues to grow? Maybe we have differing opinions on success when it comes to online games.
---
Just like GTA had dunce lobbies, these guys should play with each other instead of ruining the experience for others.
---
If you slug, survivor will be just picked up. Or you will camp and lose the game. Or adrenaline will proc. Or unbreakable. Too many perks that ease the game for survivors man. Waiting 60 seconds to hook someone with ds is too time consuming for killer
---
Unfortunately you are right, they would just complain that the character is not also black, or lesbian, or whatever else is missing from the victim hierarchy.
---
Go over to the body, stand over it for a couple of seconds. Somebody will come out of hiding and start running over, leaving you to deal with them.
---
Hahahahahhahahhahahhahahah me every fucking day!!!
---
Lol imagine having only 4 killers in the game that can even maintain or achieve enough pressure for gens not to be finished in 120 seconds and exit gates open.
---
Do we know for sure the time is cut? Maybe you get the same time on the hook and they just start that struggle phase a second or two later than normal on the timer for compensation? Like has anyone done a side by side comparison to verify?
---
You‚Äôd think so, but nah. People will do whatever benefits them personally.

No it‚Äôs not wtf are you on lol

I think you should give up in that situation, really all it's doing is guaranteeing they die when you dont. He didn't need to be a jerk though.
---
1. So find the first survivor. 
---
2. Down them
---
3. Put them in the air
---
4. Wait 15 seconds
---
5. Eat /mori them without hooking
---
Even if the power was on cool down at the start it's OP.
---
After a spirit got 1 kill when we escaped, she got mad and accused us of not having skill and genrushing.
---
She used noed to get her only kill.
---
Gave me a good laugh for a bit :)
---
Oh god why did I look at it
---
their will always be killers who tunnel camp or something shitty, but personally i dont find that a reason to run meta perks, if you enjoy running spine chill -&gt; run it. Cuz if a killer is acting shitty the game is gonna be shitty regardless of your perks so might as well have as much fun as you can :7 my go to build: bond, kindred, quick and quiet, dance with me. ( i know lithe would work amazing but i love bond and kindred too much )
---
What a meg you are
---
Yet the people who are saying this are survivors who gen rush
---
who said it wasnt a crutch perk? it's a crutch perk but there isnt really anything wrong with that.
---
All I know is that this guy deserved it. Idk why he likes to tease. I'll save people if possible but if they're too far, see ya.
---
All this talk about her, you know what? Ima go play Vommy Mommy right now!
---
I see some people faithful to Franklin in this thread. Which is ideally better? I only go for Franklin's because I have yet to unlock Lightborn. It gets equipped as soon as I see a flashlight and it works out well at higher tiers with the depletion bonus.
---
Looks V cool my dude
---
Im pretty sure in that situation you'd get pulled off then trying to unhook lol
---
I use fuming mix tape when I can and I wouldn't really like that change. I'd just have Fuming Mixtape also remove the Aura blindness part of Legion's Killer Instinct
---
I'd main the fuck out of tyrant
---
Oooooh, you mean Gollum?

You shouldn‚Äôt be getting bullied by SwFs aa Myers lol
---
Seems a little racists ngl/s
---
Ok, so 5 blink is basically just a shit ton of fatigue for nothing.
---
Perks reset, all items and offerings disappear. Supposedly you get more rare items in the blood web and that hasn't been proven. I didn't think there was much of a difference but ever since the stranger things update I think that is true. If you want to do it save up to close to 1 million blood points first so you can get back pretty quick. This also gives you an excuse to use your items and offerings in your inventory.

If you prestige, you will lose all of your perks and items/add-ons and will need to buy every single one of them all over again. Only prestige if you are willing to put the time in to grind it back out
---
Holy shit this is amazing, I rly wish bhvr would implement this into the game, since spirit is a common killer to face I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll hear this masterpiece at least 10 times
---
How long did it take you to P3?
---
i know :(
---
No, entitled assholes are what‚Äôs the worst thing that‚Äôs ever happened to this game.
---
No, that‚Äôs where you take a hit first. 
---
Also, OP said he wasn‚Äôt even being chased anymore, he stood still, so he might‚Äôve even unhooked him without being seen as he obv did have time. 
---
That said, if all fails at least I can say I tried. I didn‚Äôt sit by the hatch like a little bitch waiting for them to die. I don‚Äôt even demand this from my SWF, let alone a random. The entitlement here is real.
---
you lose everything, all items, perks, addons, offerings.  you get a blood skin per level of prestige and a very slightly higher chance of getting rarer things in your bloodweb.
---
up to you to decide if it's worth it or not, it's a fun grind to do so for me.
---
I literally thought it worked this way when I started
---
Ooooor you finally don't have one of those, ger 1 down fast and get a dc.
---
Yeah. He's an asshole, not so much for using the mori... but for ONLY using the mori with the intent of ruining other peoples fun. Literally an asshole.

Toolboxes are scarier than flashlights, CMV

Yeah I was thinking the map would fit well and be creepy
---
Maybe offerings that change the playstyle rather then the map changes/more points.
---
For example: similar to the fog offering, you can have one for lighting changes, risk/reward, and silent but brighter? I dont know, just some quick ideas.
---
Really strong for myers, plague, trapper and even bubba just cause gens are close and can get rid of stronger pallets fast.
---
Stealth Dwight buff?

---
Looks more Gold/Mustard to me. Could be a size queen looking for multiple partners.
---
I think one of the best hackusation I've ever heard of was someone saying they'd report the Killer for "getting NOED early." It was Devour Hope.
---
The addons are what make charachters stronger. If a nurse is blinking faster, chances are she is using an addon. At certain levels, you can purchace teachables from whatever charachler be it killer or survivor, and unlock those perks for every other Killer/Survivor.
---
&gt;Ok, so 5 blink is basically just a shit ton of fatigue for nothing.
---
I wouldn't say "basically for nothing" but it definitely reduces your map pressure substantially. You should have an easier time 1v1ng survivors with a lot more room for mistakes but if you fail to catch him, the punishment is severe. 
---
Very rarely you should need more than 2 blinks, 3 is just for safety and only if you are using the green one. The brown and yellow reduces your range which will affect your muscle memory for the first and second blink.
---
Franklins*
---
It happens on the game of The Thing I never test their blood on it because they just randomly erupt like lasagne .-.
---
That would make wraith worse in my opinion
---
Haha really glad you like it, I can feel your excitement  !  Really heart warming thank you. Let spam Bhvr if we want to make it happen  !  I did twitt them but if there are multiple people doing it... Who knows what could happen  !  Have a nice day sir and thank you again for your support  !
---
I enjoy my version of friendly killer, where you play the game as normal without doing the last hooks on people, weeds out toxic survivors who will dc or kill themselves on hooks, everyone else in the game finishes with at least 20k bp (including myself)
---
Holy shit just break the fucking pallet.
---
*Awkward erection sound effect*
---
I love them both and the game. The monsters have given me plenty of nightmares lol
---
I got to do that today!
---
Don‚Äôt (in my opinion) the bloody clothes aren‚Äôt worth it for everything to be reset
---
I hope they rework wraith and pig. They are my favorite killers, even if they are kind of underwhelming.
---
Mr. Daddy Myers will always be my main however  : 3
---
When you level your characters, the only thing that improves is the amount of perks they can equip. Survivors vault speed, running, etc... are all the same, the same goes for killers as well. The only difference between Meg &amp; Dwight is their perks.
---
Those videos that you saw are because of add-ons. Some add-ons give you more than two blinks on Nurse. Those are a result of the blood web.
---
People use add-ons based on their playstyle, experiments, or if they want to give themselves the best shot of winning. However, add-ons and offerings are one time uses. Some add-ons improve your item efficiency, such as increasing repairing speed or healing speed. Some offerings make increase the amount of fog, which makes you harder to detect, while others increase the amount of bloodpoints you get after that match.
---
Each character can share their perks with others once you have unlocked it. Each perk can go to level 3, after that they will appear in the bloodweb as orange. Once you obtain that, every character will have access to that perk [survivors share perks with other survivors, killers share perks with other killers]. You can also purchase them from the Shrine of Secrets. However, if you DON'T have that perk then you will never see it in the bloodweb for any character. Meaning; you can't magically get Hex:Ruin if you don't already have it whether from the Shrine of Secrets or you bought the killer that has it.
---
Lightborn makes flashlight saves impossible by taking too long.
---
Franklin's disables their item entirely and can, in some situations, cause them to drop and break an important item like a toolbox or lose track of an instaheal.
---
could not agree more
---
Because people could force a chase and kind of ruin the stealth wraith has? Or something along the lines of that.
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily racist because you know they‚Äôre not BLACK.  But actually it‚Äôs true,   Have you have played fortnite and people said play on Brazilian servers? Because it‚Äôll be easier? (Which is true) lmao 
---
Idk what it is. Maybe it‚Äôs the lack of educate they got via forums and stuff because they‚Äôre all English or what.  I‚Äôm not even trying to be a dick but when I see it‚Äôs a Spanish person from brazil I‚Äôm usually camped and tunneled haha
---
Goddammit, what the hell
---
It's under the  "Unpredictable Killers"-bill from the last meeting. It reads as follows:
---
"Shall under any circumstances none of the previous rules apply to a given situation and the survivor dies, the situation is, without the consent of the Survivors nor the killers , to be included as a new rule and the killer is to be accused and treated as if he is a facecamper/tunneler (what ever fits better) and the survivor is granted a double pip regardless of his toxicity or other behaviour during the match!"
---
Ok but I still think it would be a good idea to get rewards for how many escapes or kills you have just to show your the time and skill you put in the game
---
In May it hit a new peak player count on steam. New players join regularly especially when licenced chapters like stranger things are released. Consistently one of the most watched games on twitch. Average number of players over the last month is the highest it's ever been in a month. Pretty successful for a game most people thought would be dead within a year or would be killed by Friday 13th (lol).
---
yeah i gotta say... missed opertunity to use the outbreak survivors in resistance... :( we could've seen Kevin, George, cindy, mark, yoko... instead we have fresh faces... which is fine too i guess
---
While leveling up your character you get items and add ons that can help you throughout the game. Fur survivors you can get items such as medkits and flashlights which can help you and also add ons you can use. Same for killer just that your add ons help your ability. Ataxic resperation for the Nurse as an example increases the Distance she travels with a blink. Add ons arent a must have- they are just some things you can use to make something about your power better. Survivors dont have abilitys, they are all the same technical wise. However all killers have different powers which you cant change and are set for every killer which makes them unique. Every survivor and killer has 3 teachable perks which you can unlock on all survivors/killer once you reached set level. For more info when which perk is unlocked, you can view the characters backstory where all Information to the character us giving.
---
Hope this helps
---
We are getting a battle pass so that would probably be the closest thing. Maybe they have a mission ‚Äúescape / kill 10 times / survivors‚Äù or something and you get a certain cosmetic.
---
Yeah pretty much
---
Or just play killer... blood hunt + BBQ + pudding = 150k+
---
for chucky you could go with pneumatic / telescoping hooks that he tosses the survivor on, then stomps on a button to yank them up to normal hook height. It'd work well with the horror-comedy tones of chucky.

No because it would take away the ability to use his power mid chase (to farm play with your food) or too mindgame with your increased lunge/speed boost

Don't be a dickhead.

Oh really well thanks for telling me that bye now
---
What am I supposed to be looking at

EDIT: If it‚Äôs the rank difference, 16 to 19 really isn‚Äôt a bit different.
---
Yeah most of the time they just come up to me just to use it. I don‚Äôt blame them as I do the same if I‚Äôm dead on hook lol
---
I play as Ghostface a lot, and I can confirm that the bulling is bad. Not nearly as bad since chases are really short, but bad nonetheless.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm a survivor main because I suck at playing killer.
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
It‚Äôs actually useful for a lot more time bc it could save you from flashlight saves which would make you lose a minute or two. To mess flashlight saves even more, add fire up
---
You know just because you aint racist to black people doesn‚Äôt mean you ain‚Äôt racist, Also no I don‚Äôt play fortnite so I can‚Äôt say I understand your point :/

And uh your comments are giving me 4.7 karma

I mean so is slugging somebody and standing in their body til they bleed out.

Not at all. I was a huge survivor main and now even I play killer 80%.

Fun fact, he also claimed ‚ÄúTaking the game hostage‚Äù was by picking people up and trying to hook them. I just don‚Äôt even. It‚Äôs so hard to get people into this game when low rank killers act like this
---
Or just use Franklins demise which is way more useful and forces them to go back and pick it up
---
Legion is just difficult to work unless you know the maps.
---
There's a reason why adept Legion is one of the lowest adept achievements.
---
They're overpowered in small maps, under powered in large maps.
---
Bullying a baby killer makes you lose karma when you post about it I don‚Äôt know what you were thinking
---
Who is the kid with the hat?
---
I always go for Franklin's, never Lightborn.
---
- It affects all their items, not just flashlights
---
- It reduces all their item charges by 10% every hit at tier 3
---
- It makes them lose their items, negates their item saving addons and White Ward as a screw you to them
---
- Makes them panic, fumble, and waste their time trying to find their items
---
- They will be afraid of getting too close to you during a flashlight save, because if they do, you hit them and they lose their light
---
- It can prevent a flashlight save before it even happens by hitting the ones with the light early on
---
I remember I got adept legion like a day before the nerfs was on swamp to lol
---
Never seen that happen, whenever a killer has tried looping around a safe pallet the survivor typically runs them forever till they break it, if the survivor gets hit on a safe pallet then they must be doing some wide loops or stopping to tbag or something.
---
Oh yeah instead of haunted I would run bbq (I honestly completely forgot about that park lol) but yeah don‚Äôt let these other people call you trash if you run just the Meta build your not breaking any rules, anyway good luck have fun!
---
It's not really taking the game hostage because the game can't last longer than 4 minutes after everyone is downed. But it's definitely fucking annoying and guarantees everyone won't pip or get good points (killer included).
---
Devs gonna see this and be like "time to change Ellis cosmetics"
---
Susie snapped
---
Just cause you dont have Ds doesn't mean you cant be the obsession. The obsession is randomized basically
---
I've been playing doctor with distressing and barbeque. Let's talk about broken.
---
&gt;So just increase the range with add ons?
---
Basically, yeah. It will give you even more map pressure and you can easily down survivors effortlessly with 2 blinks. 
---
But, as others mentioned, Nurse doesn't really need add-ons. You use range add-ons if you really feel like going the extra mile (literally and figuratively).
---
What's STBFL?
---
You right
---
The game itself is a bug
---
Just play something else until they decide to care
---
New player here. Last night I was playing as The Huntress and got two really good hatchet throws üòÅ love this game!

Save the best for the last, it's one of his starting perks
---
Twice
---
Yup. Only once. If you're deciding whether or not to pick it up from the shrine, you should absolutely do it. It's one of the strongest perks in the game.
---
I had this happening and it was laggy
---
I was wondering about that a few minutes ago, thank you for finding out and telling :)
---
You can only hit the skill check (or miss it) once. You can save it for your second unhooking by not pressing anything when the skill check pops up.
---
So you know the saying ........ Curiosity killed the cat well..... Do not look at that subreddit
---
Yeah, I really wanted Outbreak too. Missed opportunity. :(
---
I was playing a match and I used it one time but when I get unhooked for second time it doesn't activated
---
I hate to toot my own horn, but don't blame the baddies who only know one play style on Legion being bad.  
---
Legion was a literal pinball monster, combined with Monitor and Abuse,Sloppy and Pre-Nerf Nurses Calling?   There was no stopping Legion but nah. The shit players decided to ALL use the same tactic of stabbing one person repeatedly to the point the devs decided to overnerf the Frenzy Stun.
---
Pulling your own pallet sliding , then turning around for a free pallet grab (since you had no hitbox they'd walk right through you and pallet jump again)  was one of the sweetest fucking things in this game.
---
He is from "Children of the corn". A cultist who worships corn
---
That power is a big nope.
---
&gt;I was playing a match and I used it one time but when I get unhooked for second time it doesn't activated
---
DS is one time use (or miss).
---
1. The general stats of a character never change unless modified by a perk or add-on. For example the trapper has a base terror radius of 32 metres and that will only increase if using perks such as distressing or agitation.
---
2. Some people will use rare add-ons once they have a certain build of perks to get the most use out of the add-on or offering, some others will just use more powerful add-ons and offerings whenever they get them. Its mostly personal preference.
---
3. When we talk about abilities going between characters that will be in reference to a characters personal perks. These are perks a survivor or killer start with that can eventually be unlocked in other survivors and killers bloodwebs. For instance The Legions personal perks are discordance, iron maiden, and mad grit, The legion starts off with these perks unlocked but at levels 30, 35, and 40 they will be able to be unlocked as a teachable for all other killers.
---
Actual abilities such as The Trappers "Traps" or The Legions "Feral Frenzy" can not be given to other killers.
---
When that happens everybody should just stop moving. You wiggling in boredom is what he gets off on. If nobody moves he'll eventually get bored and hook everybody.
---
Ohh OK thanks ^^
---
I don't use it but yeah definitely
---
Don't talk when you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
This doesn't account for the 1 sec charge though, which makes it about the same
---
Well you could put that build and argue that Wraith is op. Or that Doctor is op
---
Because theirs nothing more immersive than being a brutal unstoppable killer that requires 4 opponents to be challenged and then stepping in your own trap
---
I've had countless scenarios where it was 1 sec between life and death on hooks. It's also on solo that it matters, because people usually come late if no one else goes for the unhook. Also the oerk only counters Doctor, Infectious Fright and Iron Maiden. How often do you run into that?
---
##*Fus Ro DAH*
---
r/dbdgonewild?
---
This the content I like to see
---
Ah, gotcha gotcha. Thanks! i dont think DBD's ghostface has a cape, just the floating tendrils that come off the shoulder pads and the back of the neck piec, though i could be wrong. i'll have to check again.
---
He looks like a 45 year old eastern european man here
---
It's a Nerf!
---
Don't step in your fucking trap then
---
That's the point, when you unequip if you run into doctor, so just have it equipped, what else am i supposed to use? No Mither?
---
Ew.
---
Tag your nsfw posts too
---
I'm not sure about that, but if they don't do 5 gens it should be a guaranteed gold gatekeeper. They didn't open the gates.
---
I think i remember you from r/34honor
---
Mark me down as scared *and* horny
---
I think Jack Torrance might work if you gave him a traps that look like items. My reason for this is that, as we see in both the film and book, the hotel gives him things for serving the hotel. Other than that though, I don't know what else he could do. I'd love it if they added him in some way because The Shining is my all-time favorite horror movie.
---
Also, I second Herbert West as survivor.
---
I love how that little heartattack shake turned into a "WTF?" stare instantly. Even more because its all visible ingame aswell
---
Actually no
---
Tag NSFW
---
Edit: obvious reasons aside, I do genuinely like your art style. I‚Äôve got problems with hands and faces and you nailed it.
---
Entity decided to join
---
I see enough LGBTQ+ characters getting murdered in TV and films, don't need it in my games either
---
It‚Äòs been a known bug for a while now.
---
Your that asshole
---
Yes, I am. Because this particular one decides to ignore all killer issues. I'm also talking about surv issues like Noed, but some survs have big egos and are extremely entitled and want no changes except ones that benefit themselves. You seem to have lost your ability to reason.
---
You get better items
---
Having fun, playing as any killer that isn‚Äôt viable at red ranks,
---
r/comedycemetery
---
Survivor lobby‚Äôs this morning were super long for me.
---
Also another thing. I hear a lot of "your team should have done totems" I understand that. But they didn't, and they didn't get punished for it, I did. They aren't gonna learn "just do totems to counter Noed" they're gonna learn "wow our Nea held him all game but we can't save her she's getting facecamped"
---
People don't learn unless THEY are punished for THEIR mistakes. I know to do totems to counter Noed, but when I'm getting chased for 5 generators it isn't exactly possible for me to tell Bubba here to wait up so I can punt kick a totem. I suffered for their error and they aren't gonna learn to counter Noed, they're gonna learn to play the game the way they did here, which was awful. They got 4.5 gens done (I got half of a gen done) with no pressure on them. They could have gotten totems, and they aren't gonna learn that they should have.
---
I really don't get the joke, like at all, but I agree those people are actual garbage. 
---
There's always that one douchbag that plays omega blink nurse with an ebony mori on the PTB...
---
Which is why I don't understand why they put vaults in this game if your animation stutters before going thru it and your hitbox runs at least 3 milliseconds behind that.
---
I've watched devs on their own personal streams who say there is nothing wrong with the hit boxes, the "animations just don't line up". Like no, I should not be hit 3 feet on the other side of a widow; we all know that's bullshit.
---
Range Addons break nurse not additional blinks that give you a 10 second fatigue and no range
---
Once I had a game with an afk Myers. Free bloodpoints. We did the gens then 2 guys left. I was going to go back to Myers but thought, ‚Äúmaybe the EGT will screw with me again.‚Äù So I left. The one guy that stayed died via EGC. It was on Hawkins too. He was standing at the exit and it got me infuriated yet happy to see cockiness punished.
---
It goes back to that once the double blood hunt event is over.
---
Me:oh hi
---
My pp: OH HI
---
The joke is that these people are worse than satan him-fucking-self
---
Kick it!
---
Damn leatherface looking *fine* in a suit, let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôd recommend equipping slippery meat ;)
---
The Council will decide... If the lobby will keep working and you can keep playing with your friends
---
Pc. It didn't start until last night. Never done it before, and now it's almost every time.
---
K
---
Should be Billy throwing chainsaws at people.
---
TIME FOR DEATH!
---
Congrats mate! Enjoy the rest? Or no more prestiges for you?
---
Yes, they should extend it since it was unplayable for most of the duration of the hunt.
---
&gt;NOED
---
&gt;Can't be countered by cleansing dull totems
---
NOED is a hex, right
---
Frank's mixtape literally makes him worse than his pre-rework's base kit. Old Legion when played as intended was the worst killer in the game.
---
I'm so sorry for you, I know very well how frustrating it is... But not knowing when it will finally be fixed is pure torture... Let's hope it gets better soon !
---
Can they remove these already
---
I didn't even think about this but I want it now.
---
Everyone knows the real reason Otz is good at Trapper is that he actually uses otzcheats.com
---
I am mostly shocked he doesn't use all that random metal in his skin to hold shit. Like my left arm hook has some Pringles and my right one has two traps. 
---
Granted it is because Trapper only technically has one free hand and loses it when he picks up a trap but starting with 3 traps seems fine and you can't go above 2 in hand.
---
Therefore I suggest the devs give Trapper 6 more arms just to hold his kit. As recompense Huntress can now throw her primary axe when she runs out of hatchets, it's the same thing just slower and clumsier to throw but she can't hit you without any axes in her inventory.
---
There is one problem
---
‚ÄúPls reply I showed you my tier 3‚Äù
---
She also has a thing with water.. maybe she could emerge from puddles
---
The thing is, every time I've heard someone justify the trope (including the list on TVTropes, which although large is small considering the sheer number of movies it's culling from) they seem to include all non-white races (despite the trope being specifically the black guy, not just the non-white person) and also they can't decide whether it has to be the first character killed, or the first *named* character killed. (I recall TVTropes citing either Hunt for Red October or Red Dawn for an unnamed black guy being killed in the first few minutes, but then also cites Ghost Ship for a named Hispanic man being killed twenty minutes after a whole shipful of white people being killed.) You can prove anything if you're going to pick and choose your criteria to fit your point.
---
But he is a licensed Killer.
---
Dosent he have already a Theme?
---
Oh boy.....calm down, no one is trying to hurt your feelings. I was just being blunt. You want a killer to be buffed when there's nothing wrong with the killer. It's usually the person's play style that's the problem.
---
And it is...?
---
Could you imagine how bonkers this game would be if Lullaby or Devour Hope weren‚Äôt totems? Just five hooks and boom mori. Or a five hook timer until you can‚Äôt hear the skill check noise. Oof.
---
you're a bitch
---
Only played twice today and both times the killer dced this shit is getting annoying now !
---
Predator: Hunting Grounds. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs gonna be pretty good.
---
Something to help end a chase and it‚Äôs pretty ideal
---
[its quite satisfying](https://youtu.be/8PUmKC33dl0)
---
Why‚Äôd you tell them to calm down? They weren‚Äôt even mad üòÇ
---
Like what
---
:(
---
You forgot Darth Vader
---
How is it bullying? You're actually supposed to help your team.
---
Can we stop reposting this
---
Legion
---
If it were a real life situation, you don't think you could step over a bear trap that you placed, without actually stepping in it?
---
As a Spirit main, I approve.
---
It's not op it's actually sort of weak. It just makes grinding for bp easier
---
The game should have original characters more frequently than licensed- if the game gets a huge streak of just licensed characters, and the ratio of licensed to non licensed gets closer and closer, there‚Äôs a chance the game will lose its identity. Think of it like Mortal Kombat: the licensed characters are there as guests, not as a majority of the roster itself. And I say all of this as someone who only plays licensed characters (Ash, Michael, Ghostface, Freddy and Demo).
---
The fanboys hate us lol
---
Well, either something to end a chase quicker, or to make you harder to lose in a chase, things like enduring, bamboozle, things like that, maybe not enduring cause you‚Äôre legion but something around those kinds of perks are helpful
---
I would swap the ghostface perk for sloppy butcher, make the idea of healing unbearable.
---
Right? Some Ghost Face dude was messing around with me. Letting me repair generators and heal my deep wound status. He eventually killed me but I got about 30K bloodpoints. Everyone else was dead as soon as the match started. Guy was probably Level 1,000 with him.
---
endtitty*
---
Literally the auto-aim is god awful, it screws me more than it helps. I can never find an option to turn it off but I may just be the blindest bat honestly
---
You cant look up when breaking pallet
---
Who needs lightborn when you're using franklins?
---
I totally agree! The same thing is happening on the PS4. I can‚Äôt even finish a game, either I disconnect before the match even starts or at the end and I don‚Äôt receive any blood points. The game is unplayable right now.
---
Lmao I see
---
 Yo, that was, like, totally tubular dude.
---
Oh idk, maybe ds, adrenaline, bond, bt, unbreakable, bl, dh, or other non-meta perks?
---
Kate/steve look the best
---
That looks really good so far. what kind of material is it made of, if I might ask?
---
Feelsbadman
---
Get a a splinter and just choose who you like you could always get perks in shrine of secrets
---
He‚Äôs a good mid tier killer
---
&lt;/3
---
Smh my head
---
It‚Äôs slow progress, and bugs will always infest the game- but fixes are happening. We‚Äôre seeing them as the updates go on. We literally just got a proper party system- and it‚Äôs great. Sure, it adds another step in switching to killer, but that‚Äôs a tiny gripe and really only affects lazy people (like myself).
---
What? I‚Äôm literally saying it‚Äôs NOT racist as well??
---
If it were a real life situation I think Trapper would be dumb enough to end up in one, yes.
---
Fuck that guy in particular.
---
RIP in peace
---
If you want coins
---
some fifa coins
---
check out coins4mom 
---
and get your coins
---
how is that even possible?!
---
Just wait till you try DR.M from meijer dawwwwg
---
the color yellow is now banned because of SWF
---
Don‚Äôt wilt try though
---
I thought only my friends and I say "LAMO".
---
Thank you! i believe its a vinyl fabric, its texture is leatherish though. picked it up from Jo-Ann's fabric. it might actually be used for curtains, but it works out for me!
---
Hm?
---
Yeah- honestly, they may just have to get the 2018 film Slendy rights from Sony. I know nobody liked that film and it‚Äôs a complete shitshow, but the design looked cool. The only big issue I can see is it COULD cause a little bit of controversy, especially in Wisconsin (‚Äòcos, y‚Äôknow... 2014 stabbing). I mean, the parents of the stabbers advocated against the movie, and their town cinemas refused to show the movie.
---
they have 2 options:
---
Reset ranks every 3-6 months
---
Lock the decline at each color(Red, purple, green, etc.)
---
Ah, you seem to have gotten survivor sauce all over the Flu Lady.
---
Why would adding Jeepers Creepers be controversial?
---
If flip-flops daily for me which is more fun to play.
---
Generally, paying killer feels more stressfull, but also more rewarding.
---
It doesnt hurt item that badly. Franklins never bothers me i just remember where it is go back and get it and its never been broken that much
---
Claudette can hide the best, best looking is obviously your own opinion but I don‚Äôt mind a bit of Ghosty boi or a thicc ass clown. They‚Äôre the cutest then I guess Neas big as nose turns me on a lil.
---
I was wondering why the flashlight attempt #1 was so erratic, but then I saw you are on console with a controller
---
Nice! I‚Äôve been wanting to make a cosplay, but I have no experience. People like you inspire me to want to give it a shot anyway!
---
You say that, but the parents of the stabbers really advocated against the movie last year, and they urged their town cinemas to not show the film (and they didn‚Äôt).
---
Its always been like this. Ds and other obsession perks only raises your chances to be the obsession. So you still have a chance to be the obsession.
---
eh, there's not enough difference between Ruin tiers to choose it over BBQ
---
Because I'm so used to dealing with butthurt children who think people are always trying to attack them.
---
It‚Äôs not intentional, servers always have problems
---
ew, a naked drawn woman.
---
tho NFSW would be correct lol
---
No, ew a kid who fetishes a video game
---
Or i could use the perks that i want to, because i think that they're good. *shrug* Idk man
---
That is camping tho
---
SWF breaks the game in multiple ways. It's ridiculous for BHVR to cater the most toxic aspect of the community. It took them months to fix what any other game would clearly label an exploit.
---
You must talk to yourself a lot
---
How is he depressing to play? I find him fun as heck.
---
Although unlike Lery‚Äôs there is a learnable pattern to it so it‚Äôs not that bad to play
---
I mean? that‚Äôs what mori does? no one gets mori‚Äôd and enjoys themselves. The Mori is a rare offering and it never feels good to get instant killed.
---
what? lol
---
Just cause he drew her naked, doesnt mean he has such a Fetish lol.
---
You dont masrurbate to every drawing of a naked woman
---
I really do like it. Honestly, the ONLY thing I‚Äôd change is the name. ‚ÄòThe Static‚Äô is cool, I‚Äôll admit, but ‚ÄòThe Faceless‚Äô works pretty well too. Or, if they used the Marble Hornets interpretation, ‚ÄòThe Operator‚Äô is perfect.
---
You can do better than that
---
I call shirtless David "distracting".
---
I think it's from the hot fix, not the Bloodhunt.
---
Bitter murmur and discordance, discordance is good to get knowledge then our can frenzy and get hits, but bitter is kinda pointless as you don‚Äôt need auras as you get killer instinct. Sloppy would be good to prevent them healing, sometimes paired with thanat so they have the incentive to heal but wastes time
---
what are you guys talking about i p3 steve and havent had many problems
---
you‚Äôre dumb for thinking it‚Äôs justified a rage quit because the killer is using one of his/her offerings LMAO, this community is something special I swear
---
Unless you're Leatherface
---
It reminds me of trimping from Team Fortress 2.
---
The pallets are unsafe but playable if you have strong nerves and don't throw them down instantly
---
Oh ok I see your point
---
The Claudette walking passed Ha !
---
You see, he's just annoying. I don't want to have to walk across the map to get a *single* trap, and repeat. He needs to just have all the traps in his inventory at once, if huntress can do it why can't the literal icon of the game do it?. Plus, I don't want to have to run the same build over and over again, I want to play with more diversity
---
Same
---
You‚Äôre missing the point if you were playing to get maximum blood points.  If you‚Äôre just playing to enjoy the game and that‚Äôs how you like to play as killer, then keep doing what you like. No rule against camping but survivors hate it.
---
That must've felt good
---
Yes, so you know where they roughly are and with your low TR, chances are good that those working on a gen will still be working on the gen. 
---
I‚Äôd also advice nurse calling, I love it on stealth killers.
---
I wasn‚Äôt near the hook and teleported to it, it was activated showing the perk with the countdown timer filling up.
---
Steve could also be how it feels to play on Hawkins as Killer (Especially Ghostface).
---
theres a glitch that sometimes happens if you didn‚Äôt select a profile all your characters would have been reset tho
---
In its current state, sabotaging a trap removes it entirely from the game for about three minutes. That is robbing the trapper of 1/6 to 1/8 of his *entire purpose* for three minutes, even more if you sabo multiple traps or have a sabo squad. That is also not including the time he has to spend going to pick up the trap wherever it spawns after it comes back. I think sabotaging should give more bloodpoints or emblem points, and maybe have more of an incentive to be used, sure, but I do not agree on extending the time that traps/hooks are removed from the match. Trapper‚Äôs counterplay is fine as-is.
---
Edit: Also if you want longer sabo times, Saboteur exists already.
---
get rid of the ghost face perk and throw on noed
---
No, I was playing demo chef Gordon and tunneled to them from across the map after the perk activated.
---
Bubba‚Äôs basement, Bubba‚Äôs rules
---
Griping tendris may need a buff, asswell as the static influence. Making it almost impossible to see anything at all may be a good buff for the static, for the perk just make it more time. Looks awesome doe!
---
[insert Nea joke here]
---
Well ... you were camping so? ü§£
---
Play how you want at the end of the day, but expect messages if you‚Äôre going to play like that
---
He said you were camping because you were in fact, camping.
---
Which is why i said BEFORE breaking a pallet. When they aim because they think they have a chance to flash dont break the pallet and simply look up. Ive played against red rank people who fall for it and waste the flashlight wondering why its not working
---
Camping is just not fun for the guy on the hook since their game ends right then and there, especially if it was their first hook. There's nothing wrong with it and it doesn't break any rules or anything, it's a valid strategy, but it isn't fun for the other guy at all.
---
Now that he's out, has your opinion changed?
---
2 gens to go and you camped 1 of 2 survivors. Don‚Äôt give safe unhooks but don‚Äôt camp to force safe unhooks. Number 1 it loses you chaser points. Number 2 you may end up 1 or 2 hooking the person. Number 3 gives time for hatch. It was a lost cause as soon as hey unhooked you could go back and find them without a struggle and if not patrol gens after. It wouldn‚Äôt be difficult. But you do you
---
Ew
---
Open the bloodweb then you can open the shop. Then back out and you can search for a match.
---
Yeah, but it's just kinda annoying to play as
---
Then again playing as leatherface usually doesn‚Äôt go well anyways so that‚Äôs to be expected. Although hillbilly would probably be an absolute nightmare
---
This is some really great work. n my opinion, it does feel a bit slow compared to normal chase music. If you set the speed to 1.25 it sounds pretty close to the tempo of other chase themes. Other than that, I love it! I want to see what you have in store for other killers.
---
Because the film made partial reference to it (it seemed). As long as dbd doesn‚Äôt mention the proxy aspect we would be fine.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for December. I wonder what IT‚Äôs killer name is gonna be.
---
Even playing as killer, this map isn't very fun. It's kinda dogshit across the board.
---
Pedator really should be moved up to "would work perfectly"... They really don't belong with "only kills when on their bad side"... Kinda goes against their name
---
huh? cause you stepped in the trap?
---
"I've got a really long lunge ;)"
---
YUP
---
He honestly should‚Äôve just left and that‚Äôs on him for not doing so
---
Tyrant or Nemesis
---
Yeah honestly a bit scummy to camp hooks with gens up period especially with only 2 people left, 1 on the hook and gens still up.  All you did was give the last survivor an opportunity to find hatch when you should have left the hook to try and find the last survivor to guarantee the 4K.  Even if they manage to unhook so what?  There's 2 gens still left and only 2 survivors left in the game.  You're firmly in control at that point they aren't winning that shit.  If anything you want them to unhook to keep the bloodpoints and emblem progress flowing your way.  You can doublepip off a 3K if you don't camp hooks.
---
I don‚Äôt even care about times, I think it‚Äôs great that I never lose vision.
---
I agree with you on that. He should have his items in an inventory like all the other killers that use items. However running certain builds entirely dependant on your own ability to make it work. Trial and error my friend.
---
TLDR I stand with you, but good fucking luck!
---
His tendrils would have to be what he uses to attack, damage gens/pallets, etc. Thing about Slendy is, they can‚Äôt over animate him; that takes away a lot of his creepiness. Hell, even his walk would be a difficult one, as in most interpretations you never see him walk.
---
bad manners I think
---
I bring Franklin's lol
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt too sure. The killer instinct goes with the terror radius size right?
---
But it's so satisfying to see how many you get after a single game
---
Alien could have so many cosmetics tho
---
I 100% agree that it does hurt new players. The ranking system as a whole needs some serious work, but I for one love the reset, it allows me for a short time to play some chill games. I don't mean stomping new killers mind you, but having nice and diverse games, for a week I can rest from ruin, billy, nurse and spirit every damn match. I can afford to try some different builds and not get massacred, you know, to have fun?
---
On second thought, a rank reset wouldn't be as needed for me if balance in general where better. You can't blame a man from wanting a rest from meta billys can you? I enjoy every second of playing against the rest of the roster.
---
PC master race, is all I'm sayin.
---
perks seem really useless tbh, except The last one combined with noed
---
Ataxic + Fragile Wheeze Nurses
---
Something about the creator being a pedophile and not wanting to potentially give him money to obtain the liscense, though I'm pretty sure the studio that did the movie would also have the license, so potentially could get it from them? Idk
---
There are STILL people who think Mad Grit is a glitch and it‚Äôs kinda hilarious in a sad way.
---
I completely agree with everything you just said. One party is toxic to the other for no apparent reason and then the next game, that person takes it out on their next opponent(s). It's a vicious cycle and it sucks. I wish the devs would do something to address it - or maybe they can't.
---
Rank 20 Shenanigans
---
The point im trying to make is that its really not as hard to avoid flashlight saves as some make it out to be. As a mostly killer main its been really easy to avoind them by picking them up facing a wall. Thats all. As simple as it gets.
---
Yeah they would probably be good although nurse probably wouldn‚Äôt do too great because of the abundance of los breakers although still very good. And I can say from experience that stealth killers can do very well on it.
---
You put it on your Spotify, I love listening to music like this
---
i haven‚Äôt laughed this hard in a long time üíÄ
---
So it isn't just me lol.  Literally every time I've played a PS4 killer and it says they're from Brazil they facecamp with gens up and BM hard.  I always thought it was a bizarre regional occurrence.  Sample size is probably about 50 games or so over the years.
---
All the skins of the Thing could be so different. It would be awesome.
---
Thats  awesome! Definitely give it a shot. Its super fun, even when you first start out! good luck :)
---
People talk about it a lot, so I‚Äôm not gonna go into detail, but pennywise.
---
I remember, before the BloodHunt this week, a game that I had against a Freddy that was really good with map pressure. The match went on for a long time, with me running back and forth across the map to wake up with the alarms. In the end, two of us escaped but I liked that match a lot because I felt I was really sneaky around the killer when I‚Äôm usually not.
---
And then recently (this one gave me a laugh) I had a match against a Nurse with two tracking perks and I was the only one left (one of them crashed halfway through). I manage to get to a gate and I open it halfway until she gets me. I try to evade her but it didn‚Äôt work out and she downs me. But then she shows me mercy and lets me escape.
---
I messaged them saying thank you for the escape and for the match. As I tell them good luck, they say thank you and hoped that I get camped in future games. Picture David‚Äôs smiling face transition to a confused ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù and then a flustering Nurse saying ‚ÄúI-I mean, good luck too!‚Äù Before teleporting always. The image in my head just made my day.
---
Bad manners. Basically doing anything that is considered/could be taken as rude/mean to someone else or just to piss them off. Flashlight clicking, tbagging, sandbagging, being toxic in post-game chat etc.
---
He didnt ask
---
Your sacrifice will not be forgotten
---
I think you mean 3-Blink Nurse with slugging perks
---
Bug is a shitty way to say third party program :p
---
Witch King from Lord of the Rings
---
How? Wtf

I really wish Chucky was in the game, I‚Äôm sure they could work something out with the hooks
---
Thicc ass clown turns me on a lot
---
We'll find out in the not too distant future.  Devs are on record saying Legion is going to be looked at and presumably at the very least they're going to rework his useless addons.  Just have absolutely no eta on when.
---
Honestly? They are all pretty much covered, besides a Xenomorph. I believe we have more than enough licensed content, every time a thread like this gets posted people reach so far for stuff that IMO are not a good fit at all for the game. We have all the horror icons already, adding anything else feels forced, kinda like they did with the Pig, the other horror icons are just too obscure.
---
Jacket from "Hotline Miami" dude is a beast
---
I can see why. I just had a real long train ride and nothing to do so I chose to right down some detail on why this character would work in the game. 
---
As for Pennywise ya, he‚Äôs popular and a killer. So that could work. But it‚Äôs going to be weird having two clowns. Kinda like it‚Äôs weird we have two chainsaw rednecks with bad family‚Äôs.
---
The entity's hand at the endgame collapse, but the survivor is placed from the belly
---
Keep in mind he hasn't slept in years
---
I think the Dead Silence doll/ghost (kind of surprised people remember this awful film at all) and Victor Crowley most definitely fall into Not Famous Enough.
---
Tbh though the same could be said of 90% of the figures here, but I appreciate that only using horror villains of the necessary status would have made this a very short tier list, so good effort regardless!
---
I had no idea there was this many, I knew there was a lot but seeing it in links makes it so much worse
---
Ya but he gave up his ways in hotline 2 he didn‚Äôt die a killer
---
The ‚ÄúWHAT‚Äù made me snort
---
Prolly cause there‚Äôs not a ton of people play atm in your rank category, lots more rank 15-20s than 1-10s. I was playing SWF earlier and we kept getting baby Dwights on our team... they just died and the killers were ranked 9-13. My friend and I are rank 10.
---
Using BBQ chilli at Rank 20 = Cheater
---
And the Halloween francise didn't stop at film 2. Jacket would still be a boss character
---
You‚Äôll get a lot of salty people while playing this game, it‚Äôs actually mind blowing how upset people will get. It‚Äôs a KILLER game , survivors expect to ALWAYS escape and that‚Äôs simply not the case. You know? Lots of toxic people. Ignore any messages you get, I don‚Äôt really play killer mostly survivor, but I‚Äôve gotten messages for popping a gen too early in the game. I was baffled. Isn‚Äôt the point of the game me trying to escape? LOL! Anyway, just ignore the haters. They were mad you were beating their ass.
---
that would be right. Except that...
---
people don't have to stay where they were downed. People won't always be downed at a wall. What you said is too circumstantial to be *as simple as it gets*
---
Thats strange was it just One time?
---
Cause I played today and didnt lose items with a white ward
---
Once you start watching that channel you can't stop, trust me.
---
If you are vs billy, trapper, nurse, freddy, wraith or use whispers you don't really care about distance between the gates.
---
Most of the time the gates spawn close to each other, aside from maps like lery's , the game or the new map.
---
Why is Elvira a killer lol.
---
Who's that? *I'm pretty new*
---
Why did Bubbanda steal The Plag's lantern?
---
Med kits
---
I hope it‚Äôs in the shrine soon, cause I really don‚Äôt want to have to buy bubba just to get it
---
I know, that‚Äôs why I said inspired (based) by at least. I‚Äôd love to see him with a trench coat and an alternative glove + fedora. They could just speak with the license holders of the remake and try to work something out in getting unique stuff for him. They managed to get an unchained skin for Demogorgon despite us never seeing Demo wearing chains in Stranger Things. I know the licensing is much older but we got stuff for Pig, that gave me more hope.
---
Yes but it's a 4% chance
---
i probably will  !  I will just wait a little bit, who knows if bhvr got plans with that  !
---
Like how? Do you know the lore behind Pennywise?
---
Quentin from the cube
---
Meanwhile, I get blinded from the side while facing the wall.
---
Because it's a scene from a porn video. It Is not necessary tho
---
I had an interesting idea for Herbert West as a Killer but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs too stupid to work: make him a pet class. There would be dead bodies spread the map. Herbert would be able able to use his reagent to activate these bodies and convert them into zombies. The zombies then wander around the map looking for survivors. They will follow fresh scratch marks and chase any survivor they see. After about a minute, the zombies ‚Äúburn out‚Äù and revert back to dead bodies. They will also immediately revert back if struck by a pallet. Herbert‚Äôs add-ons would increase their summon time, increase their base speed (they would be slower than survivors), and grant them special abilities that alert Herbert to the survivor‚Äôs locations. 
---
To top off all this insanity, Herbert‚Äôs mori would convert the survivor into a ‚Äúsuper zombie‚Äù that the survivor could actually play for bonus points. They would move at normal survivor speed and would never burn out unless struck by a pallet.
---
Spirit looks amazing.

Problem being that nobody is really having any fun in that match. I don't really play this game to hold m1 on the gen/spam spacebar on hook, I want killer - survivor interactions.
---
Camping focuses on lowering the amount of that interactions to the smallest amount possible.
---
This elicited a loud chuckle.
---
*pallet stuns killer, waits until stun animation ends*  
---
  ...
---
*pallet stuns them again*
---
I once got blamed of speed hacks, on ps4. Idk if it was because Trapper moves at 115% speed (i think) or because eof Agitation
---
Ohhh okay, that makes sense, thank you!
---
Thats the stuff I like to see  !  Hope you enjoyed it mate  !
---
In my opinion, and I may get downvoted for this but idc someone has to say it: teammates should help each other.
---
Fortnite and PUBG have more similarities than Resistance and DBD. Fortnite and PUBG share:
---
Team play or solo queue into BR, Competitive BR, Loot and shoot, Voice Chat, Servers, Spectator mode, share the same types of weapons (SMG, Sniper, AR), etc.
---
What does Resistance have in common with DBD?
---
4 survivor players vs one enemy player, Traps, Everyday people as survivors
---
That's all I have from the top of my head. Resistance plays super different than DBD. In resistance, you fight back against monsters (Several monsters instead of just one like DBD), you are on a timer, you solve puzzles, you respawn. What do you do in DBD? Hide, Run from killer, work on generators and that's it.
---
Have you had any issues yet? I had some PC friends saying theirs were giving a little bit of lag.
---
Anything but self care.
---
I would take aftercare before self care.
---
Thank you Simalf  !  Ill probably do more, if you got any suggestion dont hesitate  !
---
HybridPanda in my opinion is your best go to for learning about the game and perks and he‚Äôs really entertaining and down to earth. 
---
Ohmwrecker is great, excitable and fun. It‚Äôs probably the closest to hearing Jack Black play DBD you can find. When I watch him, I genuinely feel like he loves the game.
---
Noob3 and Farmer John are fairly similar to me. They‚Äôre pretty funny and showcase some serious survivor talent. Noob3 used to have a bad rep around here for being toxic but his content is pretty fair now. 
---
OhTofu is another one that is great for learning the inner details of the game and he has some awesome content about the various maps, tiles, perks, etc. his guides are top tier.
---
To me sounds like... not winning the game is not fun for the guy..... and again as i stated before.... its not a strategy or how i play... it just happened, thats all..... my advice to someone like that... get over it and next game
---
Thats just how people are im currently rank 8 getting matched with 12 and theyre just urban evading around corners not doing gens or unhooking. Its just  like that sometimes
---
I take notes  : D
---
Yes they should but I have Claudette‚Äôs hiding in lockers and in corner doing nothing but that whole games and I‚Äôm about to change my gamertag to randomsarekillers on Xbox 1
---
That's definitely possible I was opening a chest in the basement I saw micheal behind me
---
Nope, they haven‚Äôt been licensed for switch yet
---
4% base chance with a heavy penalty for failure... wouldn't try unless it's clear no one is coming anytime soon and even then waiting can give your teammates time to be able to get you if their is a reason they aren't already.
---
&gt; DS,BT
---
Don't really see a problem, don't tunnel. The only real problem would be instaheals or old MoM.
---
&gt;Flashlights
---
They are a blessing for the killer. So many easy hits, survivor wastes so much time, so simple to play around them. I'd say they are the 2nd weakest item.
---
It‚Äôs happened a couple times to my flashlights I‚Äôve only just noticed so I don‚Äôt know how consistent it is. But I definitely lost a flashlight when I escaped + ran a white ward
---
To be honest toxic survivors are survivors that have a knack of finding toxic killers not always but sometimes
---
Ah a Claudette, justice well served
---
Agreed.
---
Or they are assholes
---
Survs ragequit against the op killers and addons too. It goes both ways.
---
....mother of God what have I done.
---
Them big ol toes boih
---
So I think unsafe pallets are healthy but hear me out. Only the tiles, usually in the middle of the map, where the survivor runs around it over and over till he drops it last second should be unsafe. I highly dislike how there are no jungle gyms or windows to play around in badham and hawkins... Also some rooms are super nuts in Hawkins, basically an infinite with balanced landing. There's another room with two pallets you can use in one huge circle loop, something the devs took away from jungle gyms a long time ago but are back for some reason in this new map. Not to mention the second floor is absolutely useless. Also can I just say that my friend who played first time killer already figured out (more or less) how to play unsafe pallets in his first game in Hawkins, the mind games killers can do with bloodlust is not difficult in the slightest on unsafe loops.
---
You‚Äôve made spirit fury a meta perk lol
---
Last thing I want is them balancing the game around stuff like spirit or nurse. Nobody would be having fun then.
---
# Added NSFW tag!
---
Relatable
---
I'm a survivor main but I have been wanting to play killer lately. I leveled up Mike a bunch before playing and had a good time. I want to do the same for the trapper. Got him at like lvl 30 and I've tried to play but the long queue time discouraged me. I know it's just because of the blood hunt but maybe partly bc of me being rank 18?  Can't wait to try him out tho.
---
Woah, excuse me. I was doing gens the whole game, you?
---
Otzdarva, Pain Reliever, Ussylis and Demi are my top ones
---
"But doctor is a bad killer I have to tunnel you to win" 
---
Yeah doc is my second most played killer you don't need to tunnel to get a 4k buddy
---
literally added just as i clicked on it untagged in my feed lol.
---
Otzdarva is one of the best educational channels for gameplay. He never settles for the status quo and is always trying out new and interesting things, all while explaining his tactics in detail.
---
he gets a special syringe that revives Mori'd teammates.
---
Did you ever play this game when it came out? It has come a LONG way. I think this meme is a bit dramatic
---
Omg they need to fix this bug fast cause that's pretty unfair
---
Nah it‚Äôs just the bloodhunt. People play more killer during double BP because killer gives more per match even if you play badly. It should normalize a bit more afterwards.
---
I couldn‚Äôt really think of anything good to represent his deadlights, plus I‚Äôm somewhat new to DBD so I don‚Äôt really know what a good ability would be üòÖ
---
I had a DC when someone realised I had lightborn and they failed a flashlight save
---
There is a perk called deliverance that makes it so  you will always escape from the hook first try but you can't heal for a while.
---
Even for a controller on max sensitivity that flashlight swing was crazy. Would‚Äôve been better off using it to club the killer lol
---
Why does it even see?
---
Bond
---
It was fully disarmed... i was holding rb for longer than the disarm channel, i was cheesed by connection.
---
This update is bugged to shit. I've noticed killers not losing collision after being hit too
---
I have seen many people wanting a my bloody valentine chapter
---
Never ever attempt escape unless you're in a hopeless situation or in a swf group with a lot of luck offerings.
---
Dammit you beat me to it
---
Would have been interesting if we had a killer that doesn't use eyesight and needs something like echolocation to find survivors
---
I see people do something like this with Overwatch as well and I've always wondered, what do you do if you get a game on the TV while in a game on switch?
---
No more than usual, a bit of rubber banding but only every few games, if my ping is green or yellow it's usually fine. I just leave red ping lobbies.
---
The progressive pip requirement system was an interesting change aimed at reducing the variance in skill at high rank, but this is one of the reason I was somewhat opposed to it. You need to do a certain amount as a team to escape. If everyone does their part then you should get the gates open. The amount you need to do doesn't really change as you go up in ranks, so it doesn't make a lot of sense that the pip requirements should go up. The factor preventing newer players from ranking up should be the more experienced killers putting up greater resistance, not changes in the requirements.
---
Ghost face and pig are fun tho on that map
---
This is creepy and cringe. Please delete
---
I feel fear. People with fixated on scare me cause i can‚Äôt track them well.
---
Rage quitting is pointless unless someones holding the game hostage like in the old days.
---
Just take the loss and your BP and move on.
---
Crybaby Survivors are just as bas as crybaby Killers.
---
Just got into a match where we were all hooked before 5 minutes lol.
---
Rocky Horror DLC is something I never knew I wanted until now.
---
Tim Curry Pennywise &gt; the new one.
---
Also, Dexter Morgan should be on that list.
---
For an idiot who doesn't understand, what does that do? What does it mean? Isn't he already MM?
---
And the chase song would be the sounds from when you collect pages but remixed
---
I've been enjoying AaronPlaysTV recently.
---
Flashlight save yes its easy to avoid i agree i was pointing out that unless you just face really stupid survivors then avoiding blind while bresking pallet like you said is nearly impossible
---
The keeper from the evil within would be good, he could pinpoint a location on the map, snap his neck so his safe opens and all his insides spill then the box emerges where he pinpointed, the ability has a 30 second cool down and takes ten seconds to emerge from the place he pinpointed on the map, giving survivors a bit of a warning.
---
Michael has no Terror Radius while moving, Bubba does :D
---
this is insanely OP :D
---
Great list and kudos for putting Dr Frank n Furter from RHPS in it lol.
---
The only one I could think of that isn't here is Pyramid Head. Silent Hill aesthetic would work great with DBD and the big pyramid boy with his giant sword would be a great killer. Maybe Heather as a survivor. But I'm afraid Konami decided to bury the franchise and won't agree to a deal like this.
---
Mmm I think he's pretty good, better than Michael/Leatherface/pig. The dash is actually pretty useful and portals are nice too. I wouldn't call him very strong (as in, nurse/spirit/etc tier) but he's defo better than expected
---
Let's just have the sequel as the killer, it'll scare the survivors off every time
---
Uh.
---
No.
---
Meanwhile the switch version is filled with campers, people with ruin, and survivors attempting an escape every 2 seconds.
---
I just want bloodpoints.
---
Honestly it's practically cheating for killers to have eyes and ears. BHVR should just replace killer PoV with a black screen and mute any audio to keep the game balanced.
---
Thought you were trolling and decided to do it just for research purposes. Game worked perfectly. So it's a USB issue that DBD has? Because every other game is ok with my mouse. Still I used to play DBD perfectly with this mouse up until a few weeks ago, when that problem started.
---
‚Äúnea is entity lol‚Äù
---
youhaveenteredthecomedyarea.mp4
---
It's fine the way it is. It'd be way too easy for killers if survivors wouldn't get that speed boost.
---
So you think it's fair if I outsmarted the survivor and managed to get a hit on them they should just get a free boost to get to the infinite window?
---

Pig Main here, we would appreciate a buff but it seems like they are just going to keep tweaking her and making her worse then she already was before the Endgame Collapse Update. Myself I‚Äôm hoping for a Addon Rework because most of her addons don‚Äôt seem to serve much of a purpose through most trials.
---
Nah fam
---
I remember when I first started playing dbd:
---
'Lol he walks he doesn't even run. Ez to beat'
---
~EW 3 activates and I get hit.
---
Me: shocked pikachu face.
---
This comment creams my cheese
---
Really butters my muffin
---
Definietly toasts my bread
---
Playing against nurse or spirit every other game is not fun.
---
Legion and Clown?
---
Please
---
You... I'm indifferent
---
I wasnt even in your game
---
HOW DOES THAT HIT, WHAT?
---
Thank you, I ate cake well comrade :)
---
Monto and no0b3 are the ones I watch. Also Puppers every now and then. Depends on what you want tbh. They all offer something different.
---
You're naturally faster than Surviviors and you get even faster if the Survivor manages to not get hit for 15 seconds, then you get even faster after that, and then even faster after that. 
---
I think you can deal with them getting a speed boost for getting hit. Besides, this kind of buff would disproportionately buff Nurse to make her even more broken than she is. 
---
And a 3% increase in attack cooldown as compensation for completely removing a mechanic from the game to buff killers is nowhere near balanced.
---
Playing an M1 killer with no map pressure, rng dependant and has to eat every pallet on the map to get one hit is surely fun tho
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Kate looks the best, P3 Quentin is camo and looks like he just murdered a bunch of people.
---
Meg and Nea are usually really easy to find with all the neon cosmetics.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
eh, she's rank 15 for a reason
---
Of course it helps! Thanks!
---
#justconsolethings
---
youtuber does game is in public ha funny
---
Probably because of all the toxic huntress builds
---
Thank you! And you reminded me that I forgot another question, what is the radius of terror?
---
Susie legion is semi cute and semi terrifying at the same time. Best looking in my opinion.
---
I‚Äôd love the Creeper to be in DBD, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd fit in the game. Plus the whole thing with the director....
---
A travesty of justice. If it's not NOED that survivors need to possibly contend with in the endgame phase restricting chance of rescuing hooks, it's the timer plummeting to zero.
---
At this rate I leave first chance I get. üòí
---
Nintendo switch version has been working pretty fine too.
---
Like how does Behaviour pull that one off.
---
If anything this change would make nurse more balanced because then survivors couldn't exploit her fatigue by gaining too much distance and hiding
---
That‚Äôs a shame as I would love to have him in the game
---
I do tend to let myself die in those situations for exactly that reason, but I don't feel that I'm an asshole or bad player if I choose not to.  There's always a chance that the other player escapes the killer and saves you.
---
And it certainly wasn't obvious that the hatch was anywhere near where they were looping.  They're just mad they died.
---
Its PS4 exclusive?
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the case. And I seriously doubt it‚Äôll come to other platforms.
---
Pretty much this. Been playing since 2017. Game has in fact gotten better overall.
---
Noooooooo
---
Technically, Ghost Face is BHVR‚Äôs original creation, the character and all, minus the mask
---
I mean, if she wants to crawl out of the TV she‚Äôll have ti teleport... 
---
I don‚Äôt get your last sentence
---
Please no this is a terrible idea
---
If this happened then what‚Äôs the point of a survivor having two health states before down? 3% more for the cleaning animation what a shit troll.
---
Lol out loud
---
Dude lmao this is stupid. You could just down them in like 5 seconds.
---
It‚Äôs just there both clowns. I guess that GF and Myers are kinda the same
---
Franklins is pretty sweet too.
---
But what about jason (and I know he has his own game)
---
Gotta be the jaw rip, no other choice
---
I hope we get dedicated servers before the next event
---
Yep, everyone is unfortunately
---
Who's the killer? (Yea I see it's the tyrant. But who is he, story wise? What's his powers supposed to be like?)
---
Slugging all 4 before hooking anyone shouldnt be rewarded.
---
I think they're doing a pretty good job, so far.
---
Lithe and Balanced can be good deterrents, Q&amp;Q can definitely confuse a lot of people too. Nothings really going to get it done quick aside from the killer bailing, they could just chase you all game. Kinda depends on them more.
---
The tyrant
---
T and L wall? Mind games. Good survivors will still be able to loop effectively on it but it's still very possible to mind game them.
---
So now you're comparing the comparison of the two different games? Well, Fortnite has building and candy graphics, that is significantly different than PUBG yet they're both Battle Royale games. DBD and RE:PR are both survival horror 4 v 1. If that's not similar then I don't know what is.
---
A little bit, but I decided I needed to grace this sub with my art skills
---
It really do be like that
---
Shaaaaadup, already edited XD. Just realized that after I posted.
---
At this point, Chucky. But I don‚Äôt know how it would work
---
DS doesnt increase the chance of being obsession anymore, it just makes someone the obsession, and the obsession moves to the DSer when they use the perk. They never used their DS, so you stayed obsession. Plus being obsession is rarely a bad thing, most killer obsession perks keep you from tunneling the obsession, as the effect goes away when they die.
---
And hag
---
Yeah but it can still save you time. You may not want to stop and do a full 360 while stalking (especially if you use a "the game" offering which most people do) only to find out no one was even in range. It just let's you be as efficient as possible with using his stalk vs. Walking around
---
It's honestly hilarious when someone teabags you, you kill them, then they message you saying how bad you are and how you should stop playing killer....lol
---
Do i still get the hat tip if i accidentally farm? Like i try to go for the save but the killer just came back to the hook as i tried and downed him again for another hook.
---
Probably ashamed of using NOED.
---
GET OVER HERE AND SMELL MY MEAT!!! (oof, Krieg, baby... ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
One of my first games ever a Meg bodyblocked me at a window and then I got tombstoned. This reminded me of that traumatic moment, ^^^thanks
---
In my experience it's really not worth doing anything to benefit the killer, they are going to try their best to ruin your BP so why would you do anything for them? I expected people to act decent during this event, it's my first blood hunt, but it's been worse this weekend than ever in the past 3 months I've been playing.
---
Monto, No0b3 and Farmer John
---
The terror radius is a heartbeat that is emitted by the killer. The intensity of this heartbeat will clue survivors into knowing how close a killer is to them. The default terror radius for most killers is 32m and this can be altered by a few perks to either make it bigger, perks like distressing, or to make it smaller, perks like "monitor and abuse" or "furitive chase". 
---
There are also a few killers who can hide their terror radius, the main ones being The Wraith, The Pig, The GhostFace, and The DemoGorgon. 
---
Other killers such as The Shape and The Huntress change the radius in other ways. 
---
The Shapes terror radius in tier one of his power is near non existent, but as he uses his power it will grow in radius. 
---
The Huntress has a lower heartbeat terror radius, but also has a secondary humming terror radius which I believe is 40m in comparison to the standard 32m most killers have.
---
Hope that helps &lt;3
---
Damn, do you know what big feet means?
---
Actually, the demogorgon has his own style of hooks
---
Shit, seeing Kurt Russell just makes me want a big trouble in little China dlc. Low pan as a killer. Kurt Russell and Victor Wong as survivors.
---
Do you know how many outdoor maps are there in this game? Lol. There's so many times you won't be near a wall. 
---
That said, yeah, flashlight saves are countered by being patient.
---
I'm assuming its an end game build hence the no gatekeeper emblem.
---
Change the flair to shitpost, please.
---
&gt;we
---
who is we? speak for yourself
---
Good to know people get that map. I've literally only had 2 survivor games and like 3 killer games there excluding ptb-.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Thanks for that lol ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I get that. But for once someone who actually understands!!!YESS! Patience is key!
---
Calm down son, it‚Äôs just reddit.
---
Out of all the bullshit in this game, you picked the one thing that makes double hitting impossible?
---
If they got rid of the speed boost, on top of a bit of other bullshit that would happen, Save the Best for Last becomes a god tier perk.
---
I would have dced
---
killers pretending they don't get triggered by survivors for playing certain ways either.
---
&gt;Fortnite and PUBG are different yet people still compare them. It's the same genre but a different game.
---
You said, " Fortnite and PUBG are different yet people still compare them. It's the same genre but a different game. " Comparing the two because they are the same genre. Like you said, DBD and Resistance share the survival horror genre, but they both play very differently. Resistance is an arcade shooter with Resident Evil's survival horror as the background. You can go run and gun zombies &amp; monsters in Resistance then meanwhile, in DBD you run away from a serial killer.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know how anyone thinks the flashlight is good. Any killer is just gonna turn around or look up, completely rendering it useless.
---
F for the dog
---
Big brain ghost face main
---
You gens doing?
---
At first, I was like this is annoying as f\*ck but now I'm like a GTA npc, all good fam, I love waiting 15 minutes to play as the killer.
---
I used to bring wraith with burn resist offering before his buff because rather than run they would try to burn me but it was impossible &gt;:D free hit
---
I got beartrapped and died on keybox 3 of 4 with like 10% left in my search bar.
---
Honesty, too short.
---
Try Civilization V
---
Ghost Face and Spirit mori ü§§
---
Time to hide in a locker
---
With ebony mori, you only get one chase with the killer and you‚Äôre essentially dead. Tunnelling is annoying because if the killer is only focusing on you then the game isn‚Äôt very fun to play unless you‚Äôre one of those people who think that‚Äôs the only fun way to play. Camping is similar to tunnelling where the killer won‚Äôt even give you a chance to run away, or they‚Äôll make your teammates too scared to save you.
---
Ebony Mori is fine with me, it makes survivors play much more careful and can lead to some fun moments. Face-camping literally ensures that whoever is on hook isn‚Äôt going to get off again which isn‚Äôt fun at all. Tunneling imo is fine as there are a lot of ways to counter tunneling.
---
Our favorite strat right now is to have one person run off and distract the killer and the other three tank a gen. Then we swap out people and a different person runs the killer while the other three tank a gen. Seems to work so far unless it's a legion (that perk that highlights a gen when multiple people are working on it sucks lol)
---
What console are you playing this game on? How many hours do you have in-game (don't lie)? What makes you think this sounds like a good idea? Have you read what you wrote? If yes to all, have you forgotten to take your medications? Look after yourself, please.
---
Negan as a killer wouldn't work well
---
As a billy main, from personal experience, that map is just awful. If you want to chainsaw someone without addons you generally won‚Äôt be able to do that with all the pallets there are on the map, they aren‚Äôt safe but they force a lot of basic weapon attacks as hillbilly.
---
fucking lol
---
BIG MOOD
---
What do those offerings do? The ones that say play as another killer
---
Lol lots of toxic both sides are even usually
---
Where would Baby face fit. 
---
Honestly the only reason for Baby face is for Tree to exist as a survivor.
---
There isn't an add-on, killer or perk in the game I will rage quit over.
---
Nothing is impossible to deal with.
---
The biggest hinderance to Survivors is other Survivors. 
---
Rage quitting on first down, farming, refusing to help, hiding all match, going down immediately anytime killer even looks in their direction, constantly running killer to other survivors on purpose, jumping in lockers in front of killers, refusing to do gens if Ruin is up, failing skillchecks endlessly, running stupid ass builds with contradicting perks, body blocking other survivors, working with killer, afk'ing, not healing up OR crawling when slugged, everyone swarming hooks whenever someone gets hooked instead of someone working on gens, ignoring dull totems, etc.
---
All of these things are WAY worse than any killer/add-on/perk combo.
---
That‚Äôs what DS is for
---
40k is a lot more than 0, which is what you get when you DC
---
Be in queue while doing homework
---
Oh my god i have to pay another $5 for a character that has that perk! wow
---
This has to be a troll account or something, look at his others posts on this sub.
---
Lol you‚Äôre good, nice job
---
You also get 0 when I dc
---
I think its you that is confused. Here let me simple it down.
---
PUBG and Fornite both share the game mode in which you drop from the sky, loot stuff and eliminate other players until you (or your team) are the only ones left alive.
---
Can you tell me where I can see the 4 survivors run and gun monsters in both DBD and RE: Resistance?
---
Survivors are way more annoying toxic
---
No. I mean like structures with a window. Like those 2 store buildings that have a window. I forgot the map, but its the one with a generator on the upper floor, and a doorframe with no door wich you can fall down. You know?
---
It's so you don't loop the killer for 5 minutes straight, either learn how to lengthen a chase without loops or don't.
---
*head on intensifies*
---
No flashlight time is the same regardless of distance, flashlight, add ons, etc.
---
Than stop playing, if a killer tunnels you loop him to dissuade them from chasing you. As a survivor you are actually powerless against a good killer that wants you dead.
---
i agree with this message
---
I thought in the end the Wraith update was a massive improvement. Built in "old windstorm" uncloak dash, global or silent bell, useless addons (The old aura reveal ones which had too short of a range, lightburn resistance, etc.) removed/reworked, etc. 
---
For Doc I want moldy electrode base-kit and maple knight reworked. Some of the hallucinations need to be more confusing or more types of hallucinations (Fake hud notifications for survivor health, debuffs, etc.), doctor illusions that chase you, etc.
---
Scrapped Tape is pretty crappy and I'd love to see that also changed. Doctor is extremely addon-dependent and I just wish the "Confusing" killer was more confusing to play against.
---
Yeet
---
Thanks for the vid! Survivor main, trying to learn how to be good as a survivor. Very good at tricking them and being stealthy, but when it comes to juking, takes a lot of practice.
---
This has been educational, lol
---
Este pinche Mechanico de ghost no es culero
---
What the fuck was all of that?
---
Useless, pretty much. It is on most killers, it just gives survivors a bigger warning that you're coming.
---
Mate I don't have any BPS
---
Wait ur not passed lv15 as Myers and r u using his 3 base perks
---
Mind if I ask for a SFW version of why I shouldn't?
---
radial blur hurts my head
---
Nvm wasn‚Äôt me. I‚Äôm low yellow right now due to rank reset and not being able to play and play on Xbox.
---
While a lot of them are rage quits, some are simply going to be "I dislike the experience of playing against 1 shot huntress with a mori so I'm just going to go next game."
---
I don't personally do it. I just play reckless if I want out but I understand why people do.
---
New Bloodweb ez
---
Yes that is basically the only thing they share. Both resistance and dbd play so differently even though they share the same objective. Don't let this confuse you
---
I usually play killer and I love getting salty messages from the otherside when they lose bringing in insta heals and flashlights. Esspecially when they lose to a killer they unestimate like wraith or trapper. Never underestimate a trapper that made it to rank 2 haha.
---
Dude that is a fucking s t a n c e and i would be terrified if ghostface walked at me like that
---
Dont steal fam
---
Yeah, what's out of the ordinary? Can't spend the Bp I earn on survivors?
---
‚Äò*The first guy to invent the swivel chair must have been like*‚Äô
---
Put some effort into your baits.
---
You don't see killers raiding your steam page to leave a comment every other game. I have been playing this game for a little over a week and I have 2 full pages of toxic survivor comments.
---
Looks great! I‚Äôd love if the stance was more aggressive, get into character!
---
Why is this so genuinely funn y
---
Big boobs? ....... anyways chao
---
I love toxic ghostface his t-bags are funny as hell when im playing survivor :p
---
Sandbagging? Tf is that?
---
Jared from Subway
---
Map: Parking lot of a minimall, not unlike autohaven but with a slew of building on one complete side and one half side (in an L formation).  There is no basement per say but the Subway in the mall has the basement hooks and is accessible one way only via those seatbelt-esque lane makers/stantions. 
---
Weapon: Stale Italian Herbs and Cheese Baguette
---
Perks: 
---
5 for 5: After performing 5 hooking actions on any combination of survivors, Jared becomes enraged, permently gaining a 5% haste and movement speed that stacks and endures for the rest of the game.
---
Touchie Feelie: Whenever Jared downs a survivor not utilizing a lunge move, that survivor is unable to be seen in the dying state for 30/60/90 seconds; regardless if on the hook or on the ground.  Perks can still break this effect, ie. Empathy.
---
Insatiable Hunger: After hooking the first survivor, all survivors gained the Stinky status. A delectible green smoke begins to waft from all survivors; trails when running and seeps through lockers and tall grass: Barely/Lightly/Moderately/DAAAAMN YOU STANKY!
---
Survivors should get this bonus only on safe unhooks to prevent people unhooking someone two seconds after they are hooked.
---
Lag assisted speedrun
---
David King with the all black outfit is good for not getting spotted, and Dead Hard comes in handy.  Feng with the colorful outfits in an easy spot. 
---
Personally I like David King, Jane (thicc), Kate as a goth, and Harrington.
---
Yeah? Who cares. Why rag on other people
---
I run bbq ruin thana discordance
---
*Wait there‚Äôs an offering for that?*
---
Fixated is a really good perk to run against spirit.
---
This is even more true because I would just drop the item I got, and accept defeat
---
Nice flex üí™
---
Not saying the map is horrible I love it, but the like 2 safe pallets on the map are kinda a turn off.
---
Don't forget the green one where you can kill one survivor by your hand anytime after hooking them.
---
God speed trapper boi
---
It‚Äôs not a skirt
---
Yh sorry just proud of it
---
That would be teabagging.
---
Congrats!
---
Thanks it means alot
---
If only you had borrowed time, no excuse for the unhooked guy not to take a hit
---
‚ÄòEscape cake‚Äô, granting the player double blood points after the match. Also as a quick snack if you want a nosh
---
You must give us a picture later of you peeking from around a corner. :)
---
Is when someone blocks a loops window or door to another player and the other player basically dies
---
fixated is a pretty solid perk in general too
---
*Proceeds to face rank 18 billy*
---
See a therapist or quit the game
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/db381y/i_swear_nobody_is_physically_able_to_play_killer/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That‚Äôs the damn point, he should be able to walk over them safely.
---
For one, he‚Äôs the damn Trapper, and it could actually provide him a tool to mind game; a lot of th Survivor exploits when it comes to him would no longer be valid strats if he can just glide over them.
---
Add to that, the trap hit boxes are horrible. Sometimes, Survivors can literally glide over them if they hug a wall, but you, big beefy boy you are, cannot.
---
But even THEN, if I set one to goof off and step on...I can then somehow MISS it, despite walking a straight line over it.
---
Well running 2 healing perks with a perk that needs u to be injuried to use is quite humorous
---
The only time I use it is when I run no skill check wraith.
---
Iron will is a must against spirit
---
Glad you had fun üòÑ
---
I think it‚Äôs a bug because it happened and I messaged the killer and he told me he didn‚Äôt DC. Had all his earned bloodpoints. I feel like it started happening after the recent hotfix patch
---
It‚Äôs a glitch right now.
---
Using flashlight on console...
---
lol now you're just trolling, it's a little obvious
---
Or maybe the bloodlust mechanic is outdated and should be removed.
---
Especially after seeing all the concept art, I think Slenderman would be amazing to have as a killer (even tho he isn‚Äôt in the list)
---
^ Swap smol blonde gorl for Quentin, he‚Äôs easily the weakest willed
---
 I know wat escape cake is I want to know wat the killer is using
---
Wwwaaaaaaaassssssssssssssssssaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
If you have it in files then yeah
---
His exit gate should just lead him to the Winchester tbh
---
alright gigabrain redditor, lets hear how you lengthen a chase without looping. Just break chase and hide right? lol
---
Iron Will and Quick and Quiet are both good options, it can really throw off lower rank killers easily as long as you stay out of sight after vaulting.
