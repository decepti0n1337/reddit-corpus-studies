It'll stop noed since there needs to be an unlit totem to become lit. It won't spawn a new teton, so if all are broke, then no noed.
---
---
---
I don't. But shit players will always be shit players
---
Killer is not challenging...
---
Azarov's Resting Place on Autowreckers is one of my least favorite on survivor. Often have games there where all the gens on one side of the map will get finished and leave the last few piled on top of one another. D:
---
Well, that's fatalistic
---
Take it off then. Run something that's at least decent
---
The current Rule Set No.2 should in my honest opinion be part of the Pig's base power. There's no reason survivors should be able to see the boxes right off the bat *unless* the traps are activated.  
---

---
It's a pretty harsh handicap to *not* be playing with the Rule Set No.2.  
---
Not to mention that it makes no sense lore-wise. Jigsaw's games were always about putting you on a time limit, realising the danger you're in only *after* the timer has begun.
---
k
---
fuck my mom and all that im very used to it, i played wow since it came out and a string of fps and moba. The killing myself thing really surprised me though...
---
Maybe, but we literally have had this buffed version for like a day that‚Äôs not enough time to tell so I‚Äôd hold back on the underpowered spiel
---
I had a myers send me a clip when I did this to them this morning.
---
Chill dude, no one cares about your experience in a video game lol. 
---
The game is still grindy, we get you're a grizzled vet, but no one cares.
---
Cuz it's not actually too good, they would be a salty (fill in the blank) because they're complaining about something they shouldn't be.
---
During this bloodpoint weekend I‚Äôve 100% used bbq insidious monstrous shrine and iron grasp to absolutely demolish games
---
Don't worry, it's on game pass ATM so probably a lot of new people including a younger crowd.
---
Why are you playing killer if you know you have shit internet? That's a shitty thing to do
---
you can still groan if you're injured, Iron Will makes your groans completely silent
---
Survivor mains: MoM isn't toxic!! STFU baby killers who hate this perk.
---
Also Survivor mains: This image. 
---
Me: Something doesn't add up here.
---
Really? Oh man do I wish I had some of my Xbox 360 voice messages that I got back in the day lol. I had grown adults sending voice messages to me -screaming- at me to kill myself and rot in a ditch when I was like 15.
---
Yes
---
See if you blatantly play killer full well knowing you have bad internet. You should get some sort of punishment. Because it literally makes the game unplayable for survivors
---
The game def doesn't explain any of the nuances of how games play out at all.  Not trashing ya, its fine to not know!  Part of being in the community is to help each other (or should).  My advice is since you play Leatherface, make use of BBQ. 
---
Once you hook someone look around, if you see other Survivor's auras (they're red and not hard to miss)  then go after them instead of sitting at the hook. If you don't, look around the area for a quick sweep/glance then if you spot nobody, go towards the nearest Gen (or Gen you know ppl were working on). Survivors tend to hide behind gens or in lockers when they know its a Leatherface or suspect you have BBQ on,other killers. Allows all,of you points and an attempt to actually  play the game. Sure Survivors may never appreciate it or say thanks, but it does go a long way.  Just my opinion but playing Killer is like being a parent and the Survivors are kids.
---
I hade a decent amount of people message me about my spirit scarring the shit out of them when she pops up on‚Äôem.
---
Like when I said I was rank 8 and you reply ‚ÄúThanks for telling me your rank and proving that you are new‚Äù
---
&gt; I am sorry you have to experience anger like this
---
thank you, honestly i had my fair share of battle with depression so maybe it gets to me more than it should.
---
&gt; my own theory on how it got so bad is is that Alot of people from the player base only know of this game from a couple of Streamers, and those streamers weren't the nice kind either.
---
that does make sense,it's an interesting social aspect of it.
---
Truthfully I think the most toxic games I've ever played were Halo 3 ranked and Modern Warfare 2
---
Why NSFW?
---
funny you say that i used to play competitive cod4 and casual mw2-3 and never had anything close to this.
---
But it's not grindy. Use your streamers, use shit like wglf and youll be fine. There's a reason the game isn't perma 2x bp, because that would make it too easy. They want you to play during the events
---
Feng's smile is so cringe btw.
---
Swamp and Yamaoka, also Lerys
---
Can we get a re roll on ghostface, just call it a mulligan and add PINHEAD Damnit lol been waiting for his ass, ghostface is a normal guy in a mask, I didn‚Äôt like him when he was the legion
---
Oh yeah. I don't care about your rank. Nobody does
---
&gt;Just my opinion but playing Killer is like being a parent and the Survivors are kids.
---
well thank you i will definetly do that! so far im letting some survivors go so i go down in rank since the more high i go the more toxic it gets but maybe its just a placebo effect
---
Yeah but that is not some external force of nature, we as survivors 3-gen ourselves lmao
---
The shrine is unreliable. It only refreshes once a week and it might not even have what you want. I suppose you could buy dupes for bp but some people may want to save their iridescents for cosmetics. Idk why you're so opposed to getting bloodpoints easier.
---
Oh dude MW2 was the worst for me lol. Granted I would talk a looooot of smack to intentionally rile people up because I was a teenager that thought trolling was just the funniest shit ever, but I got sooo many of those types of messages. I didnt even talk shit in Halo 3, I just played at like rank 45 in Swat and people took that shit so incredibly seriously, if they lost and down ranked it was like you killed their pet.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Yeah, I get that. But killers solely receive the 110% movement speed if they have quick catch up abilities, anti looping tactics, or ranged attacks. Huntress is 110 because she can throw hatches. Hag is 110 because she can essentially instantly teleport over to a survivor when it‚Äôs triggered. Spirit has 110 because she can phase directly over to survivors with little predictability to her actions. Nurse has 90 because of the fact she can instantly warp to your position and get a hit.
---
Billy on the other hand, while he can quickly cruise to generators and apply a healthy map pressure, he still needs to **catch** you. He can‚Äôt just war over to you, or phase over. His chainsaw is risky in the chase because if you bump into something you‚Äôve completely fucked yourself over.
---
He has the movement speed he does because there are situations where your chainsaw is entirely unusable in a situation, requiring you to essentially m1. And m1‚Äôing at 110% movement speed is a twisted torture no person should endure
---
A lot of it is also a self-perpetuating cycle I feel. As more people play toxic, the other side starts playing toxic because they just want a fucking win. I say this from both the survivor and killer perspective.
---
sacrificing is part of 1 category, but hits and hooks are also part of that category. You could sacrifice all 4 survivors but only have hooked them all 1 time and do shit because you‚Äôre not satisfying the other aspects of the category.
---
Lol. This happens to me too often.
---
shit that's rough, are you from na,emea or asia? im from emea and now i see people from all over the world so maybe i was used to a different type of shittalking?
---
God the eclipse as a map would be the only map to actually scare me
---
I mean he asked how to use a flashlight
---
you hold m2 to use it
---
I‚Äôd rather you say that than me
---
Plague w/ Ruin, Iron Grasp, NOED, BBQ, ebony mori, ebony add on, purple add on. After that I just play tryhard every game because every killer doesn‚Äôt even play fun. They run NOED every game now.
---
I've used dead hard. It's useless.
---
I've only DC'd 3 times in the year I've played.  Two of the times were against an obvious lagswitcher and then yesterday when a Killer used a Bloody Party Streamer on a Double Bloodpoint event and then tunneled/camped me at the start of the game...where I had no chance to do anything....nah not playing that game where you're gonna be scummy like that, esp on Double Point event
---
ok
---
Guy took a look at a Psych 100 textbook and decided that was enough to be able to psychoanalyze someone he's never met.
---
You're actually braindead
---
That would be pretty dope
---
I love how white People are so quick to tell black people what they should or should not be offended by! But anyways I‚Äôm done fighting about this.. because we all know none of us are going to change our minds ( so we‚Äôre basically wasting time üòÇüòÇ) because we all have personal experiences that shape our opinions. Well I hope you guys have a good day ü§ôüèæ
---
If we're going to talk about natural selection, would you say a real murder victims is just bad at running away?
---
Now all we need is a perk to stop someone from unhooking us if the killer is chasing them
---
Lmao you‚Äôre autistic. You‚Äôre comparing dbd to real life murders
---
Me in MSC trying to get my sweet sweet 3200 markas

If people using Discord isn't a problem, why don't the developers just allow voice chat?

You think you're smart huh?

Yamaoka and most Auto Haven maps... They just feel like ass for Killers
---
Someone dc'd on me as the Nightmare yesterday because they didn't know how Black Box worked and messaged asking if it was a glitch.
---
Best Meg set up : Decisive Strike, Self Care, Sprint Burst and Hope. 
---
And don't forget to DC when you get downed a single time because that's literally all Meg mains are doing üòÜ.
---
It's a good question. And unlike real life, a game is meant to be fair. So of either of those two things, the game should be more balanced.
---
One community had a thing where once you find the answer to what your looking for mark it as NSFW.
---
I got a 1k my first time playing Billy, I got lucky to even get even one since it was Haddonfield. Still got salty messages complaining I didn't let the last guy go, and that they were going to look at my hours and laugh to see how new I was. No matter how well or how poorly you do, salt is inevitable.
---
They said it's an issue, but it's not like they can control out of game voice chat. They can control in game communication, though
---
I actually don't mind Swamp as most Killers and most of the time as Survivor (depending on my teammates)
---
Games aren‚Äôt meant to be fair, they‚Äôre meant to entertain.
---
If we‚Äôre bringing real life, are circus games meant to be fair? No, they‚Äôre rigged to bring in money. But it still brings fun to people who try it
---
Have you actually played this game before?
---
If he doesn't have noed, yeah it's technically only getting you points
---
You again.
---
Doing cleanse u?
---
If monstrous shrine affected all hooks it could potentially be worth using. Sadly though even in a basement build it's really a waste of a slot.
---
So then you're saying dead by daylight is deliberately rigged?
---
i made a 5 minute photoshop including epic type font [https://i.imgur.com/EgE2Q2q.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/EgE2Q2q.jpg)
---
Lmao no? Some people are just better than you, which is very clear. And maybe you‚Äôre just playing like a bot.
---
They can though. Anti-cheat softwares find cheat engines on people computers, so why couldn't they also find out if someone's voice chatting?
---
But you just claimed that the game isn't meant to be fair. That would mean it's rigged.
---
Welcome to Reddit.
---
You should get Laurie to level 40 ( Object of Obsession and Decisive Strike ), Bill to level 40 ( Borrowed Time and Unbreakable ), Adam to level 35 ( Deliverance ) and Jane to level 40 ( Poised and Head On ). 
---
But in general, you should try to get all teachable perks.
---
Only totems on fire will get rid of an active hex perk. Cleansing dull totems only gives you BP and if you have cleansed all of the dull totems it will prevent noed from activating.
---
Every single tile on the map would be made of faces except for the hands.... Oh god
---
*killer mains see killer glitch walk through walls* 
---
Killer mains: lmao it's a legit strategy get good whiney survivors
---
I actually had this as the survivor today. It was silly. I liked it.
---
I think you have more chromosomes than the average human.
---
Just because you suck as killer doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone needs to have their mic disabled lmfaoo.
---
And yeah name one game that‚Äôs actually fair and balanced, there is none.
---
Thanks! Sounds toxic, but I like it!
---
LOL That was a joke btw.
---
I get the same reaction when I play as no terror Freddy or Doctor with restraint (I believe that's the one that let's you see people when their madness ascends).
---
I think you need to reevaluate this entire game man/dude/girl/entity/whatever-pops-into-my-mind, a killer is meant to be powerful and apply pressure. Ghostface was just released and got tweaked/updated and I think he needs time to develop so the devs know what to adjust.
---
Aside from that, you're out here calling everyone "toxic" who disagrees with you! You're not only a hypocrite, but a pretty stubborn one!
---
It was meant to tell people Not to click on it as I got the answer I was looking for.
---
Wait, put Adrenaline instead of Self Care, I forgot that Self Care is just for immersive Claudettes, while Adrenaline is for Big Brain Megs
---
And you still fail to give any solid counter arguments.
---
I'm not going to waste my time talking to you any more. You're a walking fallacy. Go be an asshole elsewhere.
---
Big brain specifically üß†
---
Because a survivor can continue to loop a killer the entire round. If they're good at it they'll get away when the pallet is destroy, otherwise they can just keep looping it until the other survivors finish the generators.
---
Lmaooo okay snowflake. Don‚Äôt get butt hurt over people not agreeing.
---
Stealth killers in general, they just enjoy watching the survivors
---
Not only that, but the content they add is usually supposed to BE their fixes, perks and all, for some reason. Infinites/pallet loops a problem?(at the time of release, I know infinites are gone now) Nurse. Pallets still a problem? Spirit. Clown. LEGION. Plague. Kind of lazy, in my opinion.
---
I rarely run hex totems anymore after the last three times they were right next to gens and one under a bus lol
---
You sound like you're straight out of The Donald. You're the one who got butthurt over me not agreeing with you. You're the one insulting me. You've called me disabled, bad, and a snowflake. It also happens that that's almost all that you've done in this fruitless argument.
---
Billy on lery‚Äôs as a 110 killer would be an insta dc. It‚Äôs bad enough at 115% movement speed lol.
---
That could be a good indicator people don‚Äôt particularly care for your style of killing. Not that it matters, I strongly encourage you to play how you want to play.
---
Same. Every time I see Pale Rose in the corner of the screen I want to alt+F4
---
She's clearly the better player
---
üòÇ
---
If they remove the buffer before his reveal meter actually starts going down I will have nothing against it.
---
As it is right now you looking at him in the loop doesn't do anything, because you are not building the reveal meter on him at all thanks to the buffer.
---
You‚Äôd only die from being hooked once because your team mates never attempted to help you or they did and the killer is just face camping which is annoying otherwise you can evade being hooked a 2nd time. 
---
I just think it would be silly to spend an entire game farming BP when you can make plenty of BP regularly, why do I need to help survivors get BP when that‚Äôs kind of their job? 
---
Heal/unhook your team, cleanse totems, stun killers, repair gens, long chases, distract, sabotage traps/hooks and literally so many other things. 
---
It‚Äôs a 4v1 game with plenty of chances to improve your gameplay that don‚Äôt include having help from the killer/survivors.
---
I played against a whole Mag light crew 1 game somehow my spin moves keep me dropping 1 of em lol
---
I am baby
---
Thought you‚Äôre done responding? ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
I was just making the point that if I had played back in 2016 when (without bloodlust and with infinite window/building loops) it was impossible to catch a survivor who just ran to the nearest one because there was no penalty to running it forever.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And I caught them anyway? You can bet I'd abuse every single mechanic in return.
---
Not even exaggerating., my experience so far is that 99% of killers dont leave the hook. DS and BT are mandatory perks. Funny thing is as killer queues are longer now, chances are some of these plebs are the same survivors who cry about camping/tunneling themselves.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
tldr both sides were broken
---
Thats the problem with the game in a nutshell.
---
Items use a ‚Äúcharge‚Äù every few seconds of use I believe. So 16 charges would add like 30 seconds of use maybe? I‚Äôm fairly new as well but it just adds time to the item, not 100% sure how much. Hopefully that clarified some.
---
&gt;I'm basing mine off of what the streams and devs say, mine aren't "suppositions" as u say. They said themselves that it's supposed to be a team based side and if you "play for yourself" it will lead to downfall. .
---
No shit Sherlock! Never said otherwise, I'm saying that "tunneling" or "camping" it's part of the game which you deny since for you isnt "the normal way" of playing
---
&gt;No I'm not a troll, there's no video or anything saying that camping is supposed to be there, I read all that "on menu tutorial" and it says that camping is a thing ANYWHERE. I wouldn't call it a tutorial as much as it is a summary.
---
About the troll I'm not sure, still irrelevant for the discussion
---
&gt;It's not entitlement, its straight up facts. Punishing someone for someone else's actions is as dicky as u can get. And there's a difference between someone making a play and someone just farming for points so BT has nothing to do with it. The ppl who unhook in front of killers without BT are after one thing, POINTS they don't care about the person being unhooked and redowned
---
So? As said and as you acknowledge it's A TEAM GAME against a single entity (killer player). So why should the killer be kind? Then you talk about FACTS but these are feelings arguments and facts dont care about my or your feelings my dude
---
&gt;U are in no way using my logic against me, the things I said makes since but saying something like "as a survivor u should play normally and hide all the time" does not make sense considering that it's NOT the normal way to play, however the way I said "chase hook..." Is the normal way. So how are u using MY logic against me, at this point ur just TRYING to sound like u are making sense when in reality ur making urself look bad. Because in reality when u TRY to turn it around for you argument it sounds like jibberish as mine actually makes sense. 
---
That "you should hide all the time" thing was an example using YOUR LOGIC AGAINST YOU IN AN OPPOSITE SCENARIO. Isn't hard to understand, and as you said makes no sense, as makes no sense your statement that "devs stated the game should've been played like this and that".
---
You are either stupid or just can't understand English. You said that devs wanted the game to be played in a certain way not camping or tunneling then I used that argument saying, since it's an horror game survivors wasn't supposed to run around, flashlight and be carefree since should be an horror experience on paper. Dude I don't try to look smart, I'm not but you're stupid if you don't understand
---
&gt;And no, when I make a post I like ppl to discuss the post and leave their smart mouths off of my replies to other comments that way there's no unnecessary arguments and heated debates. But here u are trying ur best to down everything I said with all ur unfactual statements
---
I try to get to the truth and the roots of the problems while you seek echo chamber as far as I can see from other replies by you.
---
Want straight up facts? Read this
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system
---
These are facts, isn't bannable isn't against the rules and devs has stated several times that those are strategies as well as gen rushing and looping. What you don't understand?
---
It's pretty simple really, it sounds like since people don't play following your rulebook then they should feel bad and be pointed out as assholes and disgusting people for punishing a bad play
---
Don't you see how entitled you sound? Really I hate defending camping and tunneling since I always try to avoid it but your points and reasoning for that are absurd and non factual. You talk so much about facts but at the end you just say "it's a fact if you punish survivors as a team for a bad play you're a dick because that poor soul was farmed". So what? It's 4v1 between KILLER and SURVIVORS not babies and babysitter
---
I didn't find my typo until saw your commentüòÖ
---
Haha look at these noobs, I definitely wasn't like them when I first started
---
thanks!
---
Charges relate to how much of the item can be used for the actions. For example it takes 16 charges to heal yourself with a medkit (1 charge per second and 16 seconds to fully heal). If you take the brown medkit and heal yourself to full it will get used up. You then lose it if it runs out in game. Any items you escape with you get to keep to use again. 
---
Toolboxes work the same. The amount of charges relates to usage per second.
---
ü•É
---
He said he's a Freddy main, is the broken language not self explanatory?
---
Hey, just wanted to say that I got a RBT kill using tampered timer and rule set no2. I hope you are proud of me
---
That's old DS for sure
---
Words, the real killers
---
I feel attacked because I say this a lot
---
I totaly feel you. There are times where I'm in a bad mood (I really shouldn't be playing DBD especially as a killer if I'm in a bad mood, but I do it anyways) and sometimes during the game, I get pissed off by the smallest things: getting blinded at a pallet, hearing the totem break sound, having a gen pop before I can hit someone, see a claudette. And when I get pissed off I start getting campy. Then, the match is over, I totaly understand that I'm going to get flamed in end game chat, but you know what? I deserve it. I'll allow the survivors to vent out their anger. I am fully prepared to enter the hazard that is end game chat.
---
And if after all that, the first message is one of these "gg, good killer" "+rep" "thanks for the fun match" I feel like a douche, these people deserved better. It also warms my heart and often ends up in a 10 minute chat. Yes the DBD community can be toxic at times, but I'm glad I meet way more nice than toxic people
---
Sorry, but it's questions.
---
As long as your item doesn't run out of charge and you escape with it, you can keep it infinitely. It loses charges when you use it. So say you're using a toolbox on a generator, you'll see its charge meter go down. Charges only apply to the round you're playing in, so if you want to keep an item make sure to not completely use it.
---
Don‚Äôt trust the ones who wear caps, they‚Äôre brain dead
---
Prayer beads, albeit broken, is very fun for jumpscares and spoops
---
It's the map that came with the plague dlc- the temple of purgation
---
No I‚Äôm calling everyone toxic who‚Äôs first part of their comment is an insult on my ‚Äúability‚Äù or opinion that‚Äôs toxic. When all they would have to do is say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs your opinion but my opinion is...‚Äù then you could say what it is but they can‚Äôt seem to do that all
---
They seem to know how to do is insult someone who has a differing opinion
---
1 charge is 1 second, with 16 charges you can heal yourself 1 time, as long as you escape with an item, you can use it again in another match
---
Please for the love of God don‚Äôt become one of those players, I beg you.
---
Snake as a survivor, Psycho Mantis as a killer?
---
Haddonfield and mount Ormond. These maps can honestly jump in the deepest whole of hell
---
Pig traps can *technically* kill people, but it's highly unlikely and it takes a long time, so "instakill" is somewhat misleading.
---
Also, Legion doesn't have an instadown in any form.
---
The mask is covering the meme, but I just know what this is and it‚Äôs hilarious üòÜ
---
her and that Nea been out cookin the methamphetamine. I saw her sell some to Billy, some how that som-bitch figured out hot to power his chainsaw with it.
---
Sorry if the title is confusing. It means they think your a bad survivor but you are really good at it.
---
Not all infinite‚Äôs are gone. There‚Äôs one in auto haven always if on the right map, and one in Coldwind farms if RNG allows it. There‚Äôs one in badham as well, but those are not the biggest concern since you can just choose too not chase that survivor
---
Big Boss as a killer
---
Both voiced by David Hayter 
---
Or Fuck it David Hayter as the killer
---
Probably just lubricated it, I heard he also helped Bubba power his up
---
Borrowed time should be in any build. Campy killers stay lurking at the hook.
---
Mettle of man or selfcare
---
I can‚Äôt stand when people wait at the door for you just so they can Tbag and it seems like every survivor does it. Even with the EGC, they just stand there while the counter goes down and it‚Äôs basically holding the game hostage. 
---
I wish killers could at least Tbag back. :/ (the pig basically can) I just stand there staring at them until they eventually have to leave or die by the entity. There‚Äôs no reason to gloat when you‚Äôve already won.
---
Oml lol
---
Don't worry, I only did it because they were letting their teammates die on purpose, I literally had to search the map to find them because they were doing anything with the generators
---
Imagine the last day we get 3x bloodpoints for the 3 year anniversary
---
... that's not an instadown.
---
That's just an m1 downing somebody who is already in the injured state, the same way literally every other killer works.
---
It's a lot easier for Legion to get his first hit than it is for other killers, but that doesn't mean you don't need to hit them twice.
---
Try
---
If it makes you feel better, you get yelled at even when you're a god. I've done like three or four gens by myself in some games and still gotten yelled at.
---
It not possible for something like an Xbox to be unhackable. More difficult, yes. But not impossible.
---
Downvoted them even though they were right. Love this community
---
I haven't noticed a difference in the games I play personally. Just more bp offerings
---
Nah. I just played more of other games for a while and jumped from red ranks to brown because of their terrible rank system. It's no worse than just taking a break. Hell if you got your old profile back you'd be down in the trench with perfect builds.
---
If you wanna play you're not gonna be down there for long.
---
To get a reaction
---
It worked
---
That's not what an instadown is, though. Instadown means you can one-hit down someone who's at full health, full stop. There is no other definition.
---
Yo what perk icon pack is that? Looks awesome!
---
I had this glitch earlier as well. I stunned the killer and they kicked air
---
You fell for it, FOOL!
---
Thunder Cross Split Attack!
---
Corn.
---
Sure it's obnoxious, but Sony really will hand out bans for sending shit like that over psn so I take comfort in knowing that those toxic dickheads are fucking themselves
---
Mhm
---
I killed strictly bad people and I still got the bad ending which kind of annoyed me. I understand killing = bad, but when you kill people willing to murder and hurt others I think there‚Äôs a bit of leeway in morality. Other wise a great game loved the social mechanics.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I see anything wrong with this? You had a 4K kill, there isn‚Äôt much else to do while the last person struggles. I guess you could just walk away but I don‚Äôt see why it matters. I don‚Äôt see this as toxic or am I missing something crucial here?
---
Aaaaand killer DC
---
Can‚Äôt wait to buy ghost face when he drops
---
Everyone says Pig Mom but I want to give a shoutout to Bing Bong Boi. idk about people who play him, but 'fanbase'? there is a truckload of cute fanart of him. Also we literally call him BING BONG BOI.
---
I can understand where you are coming from, but calling people bad helps no one. Instead, perhaps give a guide to counter Ghost Face, that way everyone benefits, and there is less circulating toxicity.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
They‚Äôre being paid for it, what? It‚Äôs their choice to do game development even if its hard, they still get our money so why should we let them be lazy?

They stand there and waste your time by teabagging because you stare at them. Just go hit them to force them out.

Its a killer perk Giant Fryer: Dips survivor into a fryer.

You see what things I get just cause I'm a freddy main

Some people don‚Äôt like double bp weekend but they don‚Äôt need to be rude. I would turn off chat for the time being. You can never win with some people these days so just play however you feel comfortable with. I tend to go easier on bp weekend since a lot of newer players like join to max out quickly.
---
I have like 70+ messages over like 3 months that consist of people insulting my parents, my family, telling me that I'm trash at the game (even though I killed them?) and telling to kill myself among other basic insults
---
Yeah you get used to it
---
X2 seems a bit much. Honestly I'd give survivor more bo generation and buff a few score caps to say 10k. That'd make me happy.
---
Aw, that's nice, I'm sure its meant a lot to them! Good on you. :D
---
Well from a rank 20 xbox player you dont need to explain since no one plays those 2 characters
---
I literally laugh when I get camped now. When I first started playing it was infuriating, but now I sit there geeking because I outplayed some fool so much they went and threw their entire match just to try get back at me. Yeah the big L you just took really showed me who the boss is lol
---
As a killer main I thank you for this post, a lot of toxic survivors out there
---
I had a game yesterday where a  meg had no mither that insta dc after I downed her lmao. Best part is I normally don‚Äôt kill people when someone uses party streamers and this game had 2.
---
It's so sad that you have to, man. I think I wouldn't be able to play if that happened to me.
---
People are horrible sometimes. You have some thick skin for sure.
---
No scratch mirror can see through walls
---
It fucking terrifies me when a hag has noed. It makes me want to crouch around the entire map even without urban evasion
---
I don‚Äôt think it would be toxic at all. You‚Äôll be starting with little to no perks so you won‚Äôt have anything meta to overwhelm killers that way. The only thing you‚Äôd really be relying on is your skills. Plus you‚Äôre not doing it just to screw with low level killers (like I‚Äôve seen other survivors doüôÑ) so it doesn‚Äôt seem toxic at all. It sucks that that happened to your profile, I‚Äôm surprised the devs aren‚Äôt doing anything to help you out
---
You're welcome. We're all human. &lt;3
---
I play for fun, if killers didn't make it fun for me I wouldn't be playing, you know?
---
as a killer main, i agree, there is nlw cpunyer play but you run at a risk that they dont have it and your wasting time

Nurse doesn't have 90 anymore btw, they buffed it to like 110 or something awhile back.

Yeah like games in general were created to be fun not for people to spread hate to others. Good to bump into kind survivors

Iv done a few ‚ÄúExperiments‚Äù with leatherface, I like to call the ‚ÄúHow To Piss Survivors The Fuck Off‚Äù I‚Äôv recorded them &amp; after a few more Experiment I plan to edit them all making one video that I plan to post on all my sites lol I know it doesn‚Äôt really need to be explained but here it is anyway, with Leatherface down&amp; hook a survivor then , yup u guessed it, hold in the chainsaw power and guard that hook like it‚Äôs the last blunt wrap at a snoop dawg show, The only way I considered the experiment a success is if I piss someone off enough the just have to send me a message letting me know how pissed they are lol. I‚Äôd say out of 6 experiments 4 were HUGE successes lol. There‚Äôs an art to achieve the maximum amount of rage to. Just standing there‚Äôs 1 thing but fuckin around like making it look like you sawing their genitalia off or do my patented Buba hokey pokey sing&amp;dance point, I use a mic 2 lol, also when they open the exit gates there going to try 2 split up come at you from different angles and try to distract you. Someone will always do the come Heather emote as if saying common u fucker. I respond but turning Buba left to right fast creating my own emote say NOOO lol , someone always try to unhook, believe it or not I usually kill 4 had 2 that I killed all 4. When the people that go aggro and message me I tell them what Iv told you, &amp; I let them know that I write there gamer tags down &amp; plan to mention them thanking them &amp; if there interested I‚Äôll send them a copy when it‚Äôs finished. A few were ok with it others... not so much lol, but if they keep trying to troll then I‚Äôll counter troll and enjoy fucking with them, nothing anyone can will make me mad in the slightest, for one I‚Äôm to high to to be angry about anything except the fact that I‚Äôm out of strawberry fruit roll-ups, &amp; I enjoy fuckin with people, it‚Äôs all amusing. I do hate restrictions on my Buba camp, if I see them burn good Offerings or if 1 of them just asks me to not camp. But it‚Äôs all in good fun in my opinion, Iv been camped many times never bothered me, if you wanna be technically about it, it makes perfect sense to camp, the how to win help page pretty much makes you think ‚Äúok I‚Äôm starting understanding this, I‚Äôm supposed to sacrifice them by hooking them so I need to keep them on the hook, also I can take a few steps back and use them as bait. I started as a survivor and I always thought they were doin there job keeping me on the hook. Lol, they need to change the dynamics of the hook camping situation, mabey a 5 -8 foot invincibility zone around the hook and or a ,5- sec timer to try to discourage tunneling. &amp; they should change the how to win for killers page. At least say. ‚Äú It is considered unsportsmanlike to stay at a hooked survivor. Because when I started playing Killer. I keep getting rage messages and I was like I‚Äôm a killer that‚Äôs hast to win by keeping you on a hook, besides ima a killer it‚Äôs in my job description to be a dick. But other than the Buba camp I never camp, ima spirit main and can‚Äôt get a lot of bps just camping, I want more perfect games lol. I use a strategy with the spirit that iv never heard of I lv looked online as far as I know it‚Äôs unique and I use perks that a lot of people say are shit but it works past 17 matches with her I went 64-4 only The 4 were last ones left and they found the hatch b4 I could, if I find hatch first it‚Äôs over. Ok long ass post story kinda got away from me but I blame it on the kush lol also there‚Äôs probably a lot of typos and I used dictation on some of it and that goes weird sometimes so yea there ya go
---
That was truly beautiful
---
New DLC? Hope you have 1 million BP stored up to even play those characters with viable perks and that RNJesus says you've been a good boi and gives you all your fav perks first and repeats them so you can level them up.
---
And that you have enough BP offerings to even grind the rest of the stuff you didn't get. Want to get p3? Well now good luck to ya there!

I think your right

If you‚Äôre a visual learner i‚Äôd watch some of farmer johns videos. He plays legion a lot.

Allows you to vault pallets with ease,  if you hit one survivor you'll be able to see the others with the orange heartbeat.  If you miss or hurt someone you already hit you deplete your ability
---
Theres more to it, but that's the gist
---
Chum is fum
---
Watch people play them. No amount of explaining is probably going to ever help. They can charge at people and attack consecutively to chain Deep Wound to multiple survivors, which is like a slow insta-down. They have to mend themselves to break out of it.
---
While chaining attacks, you can see all nearby survivors.

Who tf downvoted this comment

I got 99k with level 2 BBQ as legion when doing daily ended up with 120k

Dont forget you're forced to unlock teachable perk just to get the option of 2 perks after every level when leveling a new character for the first time, just forcing more into that grind

The hardcore version of being camped jesus christ.

Oh I never said bugs weren't present. Once he's in a bug free state he'll be in a good spot. But the "omg op!" screeching is extremely premature and unwarranted.

i mean it's not false, the whole purpose of the trials is for the entity to feed on emotions and if everyone dies too quickly it's canonically correct that the entity would be displeased.. you can downvote the truth people but you can't deny it

Why not?

Should be a penalty or a bigger quitter bonus, or option to end match and keep your offering and add ons sumthing damn it

Him being bad all game doesn‚Äôt excuse your bad play.

You make a lot of assumptions about me and make a lot of excuses.

If they run into a corner you can still follow behind to protect them.

It‚Äôs entirely in your control.

If you wanted to take a hit you should be behind them.

Your username definitely checks out, typical toxic survivor blaming everyone else for their own bad play.
---
Memeception achieved.
---
I had a group of people yell at me saying   
---
"stupid farming killer"   
---
"damn farmers"  
---
Wasn't farming... Wasn't anywhere near hooks after hooking. Just played a normal game. This event is making people insane.
---
No problem. I hope you‚Äôre having fun so far.
---
My friends and I gave up on the event. We¬¥re only 3 people this weekend sadly since one guy of our standard team isn¬¥t at home, and we got really bad teammates leading the killer to us, unhooking without borrowed time when the killer is like 2m away, randoms who ignore we got hooked. The games we did play.... 9/10 camping, tunneling, and mysteriously finding us immediately even without special addons or perks, killers using lagswitching or cheating somehow else... It was so bad on friday that in 4 games we were only able to gain 12k bp. And we¬¥re not that bad as survivors. Sure, we also have some rounds where we¬¥re really bad and make stupid mistakes but before the event, we all gained 10k to 20k per round usually.
---
So we all decided not to play until the event is over. It¬¥s not worth the headache.
---
We should be able to edit which teachables we want in the bloodweb and which ones should not appear in the menu. A simple checklist would really help the grind.
---
Apparently the nurse is super common in red rank games.
---
Neither do I, you. Honestly I don't know any one that I watch, but this is for people that want to watch someone pay DBD on twitch. If you don't want to. Then move on. Easy
---
My husband was playing on my Xbox but under his profile. Now when i open dead by daylight I see his characters. I still have my rank, my account level, my shards etc, it's just all my characters are his. His prestige david, his killers, all his perks and offerings.
---
 I tried restarting the game and my Xbox and it hasn't fixed it.
---
I dont like it but it's in a good spot.
---
Maybe freddy mains?  They know how he is and never seem to get toxic about him?
---
Reeeeeeeee
---
What‚Äôs the animation?
---
Thanks for the gold. &lt;3

Pretty sure Spirit could be the ‚ÄúHeisenberg‚Äù of the whole show. Just watch her. She‚Äôs tweekin hardcore plus the hair. She speeding so much she can enter the spirit world.

I like how you tried to necro a thread to get the last say in the argument.

Were you really high?

Baby trapper even worse because sometimes first timers don‚Äôt know how to switch killersüòÇ

Animation?
---
Lol yea sry forgot bout tagging my console, PS4 here to.
---
Nah.
---
I like to run thrill just for the extra bloodpoints.  It‚Äôs the only hex (except noed) that I have for leatherface (who I‚Äôm currently maiming due to being a new killer and I want that BBQ for bloodpoints) so of course everyone either only takes that totem.  Or goes for all of them.   I just want my bloodpoints man. Why ya hating?   Don‚Äôt even kill anyone.  Next person who takes my thrill is getting camped.
---
Looks fine to me gets all 4 kills you earned the ding dongs
---
Yah.
---
Bond from Dwight, sprint burst and adrenaline from Meg, Self-care from claudette, iron will from Jake, balanced landing from nea, lithe from Feng, borrowed time from Bill (if you play pc), mettle of man from ash, decisive strike from Laurie
---
Yeah I know, but does the sale apply to the shard price. Will a 9000 shard Hag cost 4500 shares on a 50% off sale?
---
It costs more money than the base game on PcC, I do not know how much more, but it brings 2 DLC's with it, I'm not sure if it brings soundtrack too
---
killers with McDonald's WiFi
---
Yeah, no thanks.
---
&gt;what if
---
That's the point of the what if. It would be really cool.
---
How am I not giving facts?! What do you want, freaking spefic numbers? I literally explained how Ghostface gets less out of his power then anyone else. What more do you want
---
I think rule set no. 2 should be in her base kit, her traps should always be removed in the 3rd or 4th jigsaw box, never the 1st or 2nd, bring back the fact that they activate when all gens are popped, give her faster crouching movement speed and rework most of her add ons since they're mostly decent or crap
---
Legion
---
Reason being is that it's great to not have to deal with looping as much.
---
Being able to hit everyone to gather stbfl tokens helps
---
Awesome, any new item suggestions or ways to just improve current lacking items should be supported. The community on this subreddit sucks when it comes to any type of conversation besides ‚Äúpopular meme with low effort dbd joke text overlay‚Äù

That‚Äôs cool. I really like that idea mind if I steal it? Lmao

I think he's fine. So what if he's not stealthy? Nether is pig, Myers, wraith. Because stealth killers won't work with the Meta

No please, he just got buffed up to not be Joke Face.
---
In principle he‚Äôs fine, but breaking his stalk has to bugged right now or something with the sheer amount of examples I‚Äôve seen of people staring straight at him from a few feet away and still getting exposed.
---
literally lol
---
Even in blindness you can still see the bubble and the hook, but only until the bubble disappears.
---
It doesn‚Äôt block the bubble but after that you won‚Äôt be able to see the red aura of the hooked survivor.
---
Viable killers, if you yourself have enough experience playing said killer, can get you at least two kills under the right circumstances because those killers are considered above average/good. Viable killers are more likely than not to do good if they don't get a bad map, or a SWF team that's too good, and they themselves are well prepared with the right addons and perks. These killers are Hag, Huntress, Myers. Just three. But yeah, this game is totally killer sided.
---
Mid-tier Killers are killers that are merely decent but can win at all ranks under the right circumstances (however there are a LOT of circumstances). The right circumstances depends on the map, depends on how good the SWF team is, depends on how good your addons/perks are, and depends on what tools the killer you're using has that can aid you in map pressure, gen pressure, or chase ending ability. You have so much you have to overcome with mid-tiers that your odds of even getting two aren't that good in red ranks. These killers are Pig, Clown, Wraith, Leatherface, maybe Wraith.
---
Bad killers? You will hardly ever see them in the higher ranks because they only do well in the low ranks against poor survivors who haven't figured the game out yet and they are completely at the mercy of survivors who have figured it out. These killers are Plague, Legion, Doctor, Freddy.
---
Not if you want more than just viable -if you want to win your trials (3k or more) you need the best killers and those are the ones you'll see the most in the red ranks - Nurse, Spirit, Billy and... that's it.
---
The reason why Nurse is the best killer (and why survivors want her nerfed, why the devs would LOVE to nerf her, and why the devs will never make another killer equal to her) is because Nurse is THE definition of a power role. When you are the nurse, you are in control, not SWFs, not the availability of perks, not map spawns. You have the power and the only thing that determines how good you are is your OWN skill level. Spirit and Billy are not at the Nurse's level, but are still great killers because their power allows you to still do great even with their own shortcomings and even with all the shit the devs, maps, and SWFs throw at you.
---
The devs and survivor mains don't want a killer who's kill count is based upon their own skill level...they want killers that are "fun to play against" aka, killers who can be looped, trolled at pallets, trolled at exit gates, killers who survivors don't fear even in a 1v1 situation. Killers who's kill count is based upon the skill level of SURVIVORS, not the killer's.
---
So we have three great killers right now in the game and I don't think they'll ever add another great killer. They MAY add a viable one and Ghostface MAY be a viable one in the red ranks if they don't nerf him again, but we'll never get another great one. It's viable or bad or terrible.. just the way survivors want it. Even merely viable ones get called OP by survivor mains and nerfed in some way by the devs who cow-tail to them.
---
Distressing and Unnerving presence are specifically good on doc, Distressing for extra bloodpoints with doc (the best killer for bloodpoints alongside legion), and doctor benefits from a larger terror radius, affecting more people with his madness via treatment mode. Unnerving presence makes skill checks super hard to hit alongside docs madness which will mess around the screen.
---
Other than that, all the typical killer perks are good on him; ruin, bbq, enduring, spirit fury, nurses calling, stbfl, sloppy butcher etc...
---
Yup got this at rank one lol
---
Played against a Myers with crap perks and an Ebony mori. He couldn't hook anyone and when the gates were open he DCed.
---
He's gone from bottom tier to Myers++, the deactivations are now unintuitive as it is (a survivor staring straight at you has a tougher time deactivating the stalking than one on a hook or on the ground).
---
But isn‚Äôt huntress older then trapper? And she‚Äôs like from WW1
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have been so toxic running self care #survivorsopplsnerf #buffallkillers #noedisntacrutchperk
---
My only problem with hag is that it moves your camera, which in turn scares the s*** out of me
---
Im surprised this bug still exists tbh
---
Wow! Toxic
---
These cards are amazing! Everyone should try and get one, the feng ones she sent out before were fantastic. Show her some love &lt;3
---
But then someone would finally think i'm a snack
---
He‚Äôs still kinda broken.  But I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be fixed in.       Some matter of updates.
---
I actually really like the new DS. Feels powerful but fair.
---
Wow, any closer and he'll be giving you a lap dance.
---
These survivors will make a fine addition to his collection
---
That‚Äôs really fun lol, my friend explained insidious to me wrong so my dumb ass just standing out in the open like. Uh oh y‚Äôall Can‚Äôt see me I‚Äôm completely invisible bitchs, lol 4MONTHS Of epically failing lol
---
Thank you, Ganja. &lt;3 I'll do a "catch up" postcard giveaway in November, if anybody's interested, so they can get any postcards they've missed!
---
Just played my first game in months, forgot about the ds nerf and was sad
---
This picture perfect shows why dbd is a way better game now than it was before
---
Nurse moves at 96%.
---
Yeah it happens but it is a lot more balanced now.
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not entitled to anything‚Äù, says the killer.
---
Right, let‚Äôs get into clearing this nonsense up with some actual game knowledge. 
---
1) I‚Äôve managed to 4 kill plenty of SWF groups. Its more difficult, yes. But if you patrol gens you will find people, it‚Äôs not that difficult. And SWF aren‚Äôt the most common. If the developers didn‚Äôt want teammates to play together, it wouldn‚Äôt be an option. 
---
2) NO PALLETS DO NOT COME BACK A FEW MINUTES AFTER BEING DESTROYED. This point is completely invalid as it‚Äôs not true. Once a pallet is thrown down it stays there until the killer destroys it. And why should you be rewarded for not being able to catch a survivor and the survivor to be punished for being good at surviving? An absolutely ridiculous point to make created from zero facts. 
---
3) flashlights are not OP. Learn to pick survivors up better i.e. face walls when you pick them up, check around you before picking them up etc. Or even better, RUN LIGHTBORN (a hillbilly teachable, so no you don‚Äôt have to buy a killer to get it) They absolutely do not need a nerf at all. If you get baited into chasing someone clearly wanting to run you around hence flashing at you, that is your fault. 
---
4) NOED IS A THING. A standard perk on the bloodweb, allowing you to have one hit downs when exit gates are powered. NO DLC KILLER NEEDED. Hillybilly (a base game killer) also has a one-hit down option with his chainsaw. Also end game collapse prevents survivors from staying and will die if they don‚Äôt get out. 
---
5) pallet looping is a genuine strategy and meant to be in the game so explain how it‚Äôs an exploit. Exploit - defined as using bugs, glitches, in game systems, level design etc. to a players advantage in a way THE DEVELOPERS HAVE NOT INTENDED. So you‚Äôre wrong there. If you don‚Äôt destroy pallets - which I do every time a survivor throws one down and I have no bother catching them afterwards - that‚Äôs on you. 
---
6) balance and bug fixes are a different department from dlc creators.
---
7) all survivors are the exact same base speed so no that point is wrong. Also, you don‚Äôt have to use all of the perks so stop crying. Dead hard is one of the most used perks amongst higher tier survivors, so it‚Äôs clearly not useless. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry for going on but your lack of knowledge has annoyed me man. Learn the game before you preach ‚Äúideas‚Äù with no knowledge or research on the subject.
---
No it will not.
---
Every time I get it, I love putting agitator on every killer, it may not be strong, but it‚Äôs my first ever teachable, and I‚Äôve always enjoyed having it
---
:-(
---
*Internet Hug*
---
I don‚Äôt really like it now cause like, one off the shoulder a game per person using it, especially with the frames on console hitting it was almost impossible you know?
---
This
---
Were  you kind to the last person? If an entire team dcs i try to take it easy on the last person
---
So it has kind of a nostalgic factor for you?
---
Best killer ever would be a tie between pin head &amp; honey boo boo... no it‚Äôs honey boo boo, 2OP, she be killing/eating/forcing suicide threw conversations
---
I haven't been childish. I'm simply over arguing with children
---
I played on console once and hitting great skill checks were harder for me to hit so I guess I can see what you mean.
---
I spawn never more than 20 feet from the killer.  And unless I‚Äôm SWF I am camped and tunnelled for the entire game.  Which is why I no longer bring in offerings. I also never bring in items. Because literally every time I do. The killer has Franklin‚Äôs.
---
Some people do that and that's why I fucken hate it jk love you
---
I hate the community for this game due to messages I get, the only joy is when I see a comm ban.
---
Whispers on killer, and bond on survivor.
---
A viable option. Would you rather it be a regular perk or a Hex perk?
---
yes
---
The Entity already clearly was on crack for deciding to have a bunch of edgy teens as killers if you ask me.
---
I mean you guys say that what this Wraith is toxic, but what else are they meant to do for the minute or so it takes to fully sacrifice. Sure they could walk around the map aimlessly, but that‚Äôs boring.  Plus that survivor seemed to be a bad (Not in terms of skill) player, so I have to say that the Meg had it coming.
---
You don't even have to defend yourself. Pick whatever perks you like. Ruin is a good perk, why not use it? 
---
That guy is just being a dick.
---
Honestly I feel a lot of ultra rare items are overpowered. Iridescent head(mainly with current hitboxes) and prayer beads(and that's only rare)
---
I‚Äôve always thought it was stupid to have noed on hillbilly because his ability IS an instadown and it‚Äôs so easy to land a chainsaw hit lol for me I would say nurse, spirit, and wraith.
---
Didn‚Äôt get enough likes the first time you posted this I guess?
---
Shadowborn because I love big FOVs plus it has helped sometimes with catching sneaky Survivors
---
Do you even understand what I said?
---
To counter camping, you need to rush gens as fast as possible. To stop NOED, you need to rush totems as fast as possible. So if the killer is camping, do you rush gens or totems?
---
Dbd needs to do a public service announcement to let everyone know not to farm people off hooks
---
Yeah most of the community is shit
---
isnt nurse and spirit handi-cap killers tho?
---
Stridor trumps iron will. Read the description. Stridor says "breathing of Survivors in pain is 25% louder" (tier 1). If they have iron will tier 3, their grunts of pain will be 75% quieter, because iron reduces it by 100%. Test it in kyf, they're quieter than usual but they arent silent. You can even tell the killer has stridor because if you have iron will and you're injured you can hear yourself grunt in pain due to the perk.
---
The only time I preemptively play around NOED is if I find a really well hidden totem that I don't want to have to find again. In any other case you are either wasting time or guaranteeing that NOED will spawn on the one hidden totem you couldn't find.
---
Hey, I heard survivors are op on this sub, why is everyone play killer? /s
---
I totally agree! There‚Äôs no point in doing it after the gens are all done, and that‚Äôs unfair to do to a killer if they have a reason to stay there. 
---
I just love it when I‚Äôm struggling, and a killer is staying near me, and that somehow benefits my teammates, it‚Äôd be cool if a hooked survivor could somehow help out, even in a small way.
---
Honestly if I was the nurse, I probably wouldn't even be all that mad if she dc'd right there
---
Enduring makes me feel unstoppable lol
---
If you have an item you really are worried about losing, you can bring the ‚ÄòWhite Ward‚Äô Offering and if you die, you get to keep the item. (This only works if you haven‚Äôt fully used the item up in trial and you haven‚Äôt dropped it at time of death. Whether by Franklin‚Äôs Demise or by choice.)
---
Damn that‚Äôs rough. Poor dude
---
like looking at him during the loop and not canceling his ability? K
---
That's the thrill of playing killer. You have to try to be everywhere at once, applying as much pressure as possible... It's a madhouse!
---
Claudette used confusion it's super effective!!!
---
I mean I play on console and I almost hit every ruin great skill check. And normal repairs I usually hit more greats than goods. DS is probably the easiest of all of them, i‚Äôve used it so many times and I‚Äôve only missed  a couple, usually for something stupid like scratching my leg real quick, or forgetting It was still active
---
Ahahah, he will be shirtless once his workout... *will work out*..!
---
(I ask forgiveness in advance for this terrible pun, be understanding with me, please...)
---
Easy, deerstalker 4 life
---
I love playing against survivors like you!
---
I didn't realize how powerful Bloodwarden was until one particular pig game I had. I got a 4 kill because they weren't ready for it.
---
How does whispers work exactly? I never understood.
---
Yeah, like seeing that sneaky Blendette crouched in a bush haha
---
That‚Äôs actually a really good idea too. When you down someone it could highlight completed gens so no time is wasted searching in case you‚Äôre not in proximity of one.
---
No, not at all. Dull totems do absolutely nothing. Breaking a lit totem breaks the Hex associated with the totem. No One Escapes Death is the only Hex in the game that doesn't spawn to a totem at the start of the game, it finds a dull totem once the exit gates are powered and lights it up.
---
Do you like slugging?
---
Nah just if there‚Äôs that 1 little Dwight there for da flashlight save
---
What about the spirit? She's pretty unsympathetic.
---
Sall about the killers POV. Not to mention the hit boxes are a little wonky (Read: completely fucked). It is bullshit but they tried her hatchets being the other way and she would miss them by it going between their arm and chest. So.
---
Monitor and Decisive
---
Haha I feel that
---
uhh, she was literally murdered by her father, how is that unsympathetic?
---
Yes, give me a bloodthirsty, crazy bitch who loves killing just for the adrenaline.
---
Both very good. I use Monitor on Mikey and it feels extra sneaky haha
---
Lmao I love Monto and sorta got my idea from him, my build was:
---
Scratched Mirror
---
M&amp;A
---
Devour Hope
---
Bbq (double bp weekend is so good for this build)
---
And I don't remember off the top of my head what the 4th was but I usually run either Mad Grit or Enduring.
---
He probably thought that that timer was paused cuz he was in Terror radius
---
If you are within 32 meters of a survivor (if the perk is tier3) the perk icon lights up letting you know that a survivor is within that range. If the perk is not lit up it basically means "don't waste your time looking in this area because there are no survivors here"
---
Yep, piece of mirror as it was in Halloween.
---
Make Matryoshka huntress lol
---
Killers who camp do not give a shit about bloodpoints, rank, or anything. They live to troll. 
---
Slowing the sacrifice progress bar by killer proximity needs to happen. Period. 
---
This blood hunt has brought out the absolute worst of the worst and I'm sick and fucking tired of it.
---
Oh, man! I never knew that! I'm gonna have to try it out now haha
---
Yeah, except Ghostface(and Scream) is one of the most influential horror movies of all time, he is an icon of horror cinema. He isn't just "a normal guy in a mask"
---
I just dashboard if I see haddonfield offerings
---
Amanda young is pretty crazy if you‚Äôve ever seen the movies
---
Pig and Myers
---
Also, I assume you meant killer in the title
---
 That‚Äôs why I hide in the middle of the map when the exits open
---
Yes I have overwatch in kind ti much
---
It was a knitting needle and a coat hanger, but a glass shard is wayyyy cooler
---
Because she looks the most demonic and she has big hair.
---
Got my rank reset and saw it was bloodhunt. 
---
I knew it was going to be utter horror.
---
I was correct.
---
influential horror movies = PINHEAD lol but if you think about it he‚Äôs kind of a normal human guy  in a mask that runs and stabs lol.

Do you happen to know if her axes are hitscan or projectile(I'm assuming projectile)?
---
I got something similar on the flip flop. A hag with an ebony mori, shaking her head when she downs us, hitting us on hook, spamming the mori button before killing us. Some players just do be like that.
---
Oh, another Freddy main? I love you guys.
---
I'm glad those moments make up for all the others. Really wish they happened more often, but I'm glad feeling like I've made some people's days every now and again. :D
---
In the wrong hands dh is useless. If used correctly,  it's a pretty powerful perk. I use it in every build.

They really do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

got some bad news for you bud it takes longer than 500 hours to get all the teachables
---
To be fair for her the amount of people who look like their farming but then kill you still
---
Bubba usually has noed because usually if someone's playing bubba they're trying to be as toxic as possible, and if not, bubba is just an m1 killer who sucks so I get why they put it on.
---
Find the hatch and force them out.
---
Don't advertise ur twitch here.
---
You can animate the projectile while still using raycasting
---
Sorry, is this a video or just a drawing? ü§£

Not enough flashlights. Wait till it's a 4 way swf and they dont bother about gens but instead spam click and teabag. The mori was glorious that day.

Rank Reset is pretty rough on newer players already and as others said, the Bloodhunt makes every chaotic. Your games this weekend are mostly gonna be not at all like your average game. 
---
Continue to play both roles though, as a knowledge of both sides will help you greatly. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take some time to take in the different maps and as time goes by, you will become much more comfortable. The Wiki also has the map layouts I believe which can be handy to peek at. Maps like The Game are fairly killer-friendly while maps like Haddonfield and Yamaoka are big advantages to survivors. When you‚Äôre playing survivor, Kate has a perk called Windows of Opportunity which is great for learning where pallets and good vaults are. 
---
Hang in there, this weekend is not representative of the game on a normal basis and although the early grind and learning curve can be rough, this is a game that does get more fun the more you play it.

I want to like Pop Goes the Weasel, but it's a bit weak in its current form.
---
Honestly I unironically miss this shit. Sure maybe objectively the game is better now, but there was so much more fun tech back then. I miss those days.
---
I'm happy that people don't use them too often, DC rate is like 90% lol
---
It's a find line for sure but it's not hard to distinguish. Tunneling is acceptable when they are the only one on their team doing anything. Or if they know where one of your totems are. Or if they are being a cunt following you around then flashlighting you when you pick someone up. Camping isnt ever really acceptable unless its endgame. Even then its iffy. But soft camping is viable if the survivors have shown they are gonna be altruistic as fuck. The amount of hatchets I've gotten just by leaving with a line of sight then throwing a hatchet back 5-10 second after I walk off is insane.
---
OH MY GOD I LOVE HER
---
Oh! Lol, yeah, it's just a drawing that I made because I can only communicate in memes
---
If anything were to get nerfed from it's current state, I'd rather they nerf the "0 decay" on the stalk meter. It does seem like it should drain about as fast as Doctor's madness. Being able to bring someone 99% and then pop it in a chase seems a bit cheesy.
---
  
---
I think nerfing Exposed duration (outside of 99ing the stalk meter) could cause it to be almost useless on certain maps with very safe window loops.
---
I am allowed to
---
To this day I still don't know what the devs were thinking when they made bubba, he's literally soooo fucking bad, nothing he does is better than billy, billy is even better at instadowning survivors in open locations. There is LITERALLY, LITERALLY nothing bubba can do that billy can't do better, the ONLY thing bubba does better is camping lmao
---
LMAO. ranking up in 2019. people who use shit like ruin at a rank like that are yikes af. SMELL YA LATER BUD
---
Goddamit I need to rewatch it
---
It isn't all that rare, I have 10 prayer beads lol
---
It's always good to see where the Killer is via running teammate auras.
---
Honestly post rework he isn't even that annoying to face anymore.  I'm surprised at anyone that still has that type of salt over facing a Legion.
---
Get baited lol
---
Imogen Heap - Hide And Seek
---
When activated they get increased speed and the ability to vault for 10 seconds. During this time their normal m1 hits apply deep wounds and wounding the first person gives them a visual indicator of anyone in the terror radius without the debuff.
---
They can hit twice while in frenzy but the second hit cant down a survivor and Is more used for add on effects.
---
In general if they're chasing you it's better to run straight and 360 their attacks because if they miss or get 2 hits off one the same target during frenzy it causes a reasonably long recovery animation.
---
I think the original meme humor is from Always Sunny In Philadelphia ?
---
Comment section is exactly what i expected it to be, glorious work guys ü§£ i hope OP wasnt looking for empathy from this sub lol.
---
TBH, if they really wanted to end camping.. they could. But I don't think they want to enough. They went the easiest, least taxing way to do it in taking away points from killers who camp. But in their infinite wisdom they forgot that campers don't care about their own points being taken away so long as the survivor dies/doesn't get a lot of points. The solution isn't to take away points, that won't do anything.
---
Slowing down the health meter would help the problem a lot. My own solution was to give the killers a reason to always leave a hook right after.
---
That hooking a survivor prompted the ability for a killer to go an alter (there would be say five alters spread out around the map - all glowing white when a hook is completed) to cleanse one (random and RNG'd) perk from the hooked survivor, for a maximum of two cleansings per survivor during the trial (on a survivor's last hook there is no prompt since they die). 
---
Each cleanse would last as long as it takes to cleanse a totem - 20 seconds. If the survivor is rescued before the cleansing action is completed, the cleansing action is cancelled, the alter turns red, and the survivor keeps all of his perks. That's the tradeoff for killers. 
---
My aim behind the idea was that if killers, even ones who were upset at certain survivors, knew that they would be rewarded for leaving the hook for a chance to cleanse one per from a survivor it would  be a quick hook and a dash to the nearest alter they could find. Meanwhile survivors would make a quick dash to the hook to rescue their teammate as fast as they could to prevent the killer from cleansing their teammates' perk, with no killer around to prevent them since they'' be far less campers.
---
Survivor perks could be tweaked to prevent the aura of alters from being revealed to the killer for a specific time) Survivor offers could be added that removes 1 or 2 alters from the game.
---
I'm sure other people could come up with other ways to get rid of camping and give killers a reason to leave hooks, but that was just one reason. The problem though is though that we aren't the devs, and their ideas for fixing camping aren't that creative.
---
I don‚Äôt think this is a terrible idea, actually. I do think there needs to be some sort of notification at the very least for survivors. I think seeing another gen needing to be finished in the HUD is one thing, but a sound notification and some unique alert (like Spies for killers) would make it a bit more balanced, since survivors will have to decide whether to save or rush to that gen first. 
---
I also think it should regress a certain percentage, but not be able to go all the way back down to zero. Otherwise, I think it could work and may even make BNPs useful again.
---
The one flaw is that you could be potentially wasting your time because it's a *radius* around you, so they could be anywhere in that 32 meter radius. And meters are much bigger than we Americans realize. At least me anyways.
---
Weewoo weewoo it's the Internet joke police everyone
---
You sound like a rank 0 yourself, you clearly know all there is to know.

Pop goes the weasel. Nothing better than watching a chunk of there progress disappear, instantly

---
I think its getting a buff from 30 seconds to 60? Maybe that could make it a little more viable.
---
It would be pretty strong to do if you're a gen locking Doctor. While I'll always argue that a coordinated team of 2 or more Survivors  can easily repair any damage done by the Killer in a short amount of time, it would be a struggle for solo Survivors.
---
Don‚Äôt blame all survivor over that twat muffin but what a dick.

Some DLCs are certainly better than others. Take some time to read up on the perks available in each DLC and watch some videos on the killer‚Äôs power. 
---
Myers, Spirit, and Pig are probably my favorite killers to play though some others (Leatherface most notably) aren‚Äôt as fun to play but have valuable perks for other killers. I will say that Leatherface is worth the buy for his BBQ perk on its own. You‚Äôll wonder how you ever played killer without it.

Yeah I know, I regretfully put that there, I almost never see toxic people but when I do it makes me mad

She can be if you use the Corruption effectively. I've seen people play through sickness so it's not always enough.
---
That‚Äôs epic lol
---
That sounds a bit broken doesn't it?
---
When's the rework?
---
The best part of it being a costume company that had this one get popular through Scream is how many variations they had capitalising on the popularity. So many cosmetics are possible. (Potentially many we wouldn't have got if it were Scream since he never changed in that.)
---
Not really. Survivors can deny her Corrupt Purge by not cleansing. Many Survivors would rather be injured all game than have to deal with a 115% version of Huntress because all they have to do is loop a powerless Killer. The only advantages being fully sick gives you is that everyone is broken and it‚Äôs easier to find them because of their vomiting. It‚Äôs kinda like all of the Survivors are running No Mither.
---
Why tf is the entity displeased

This man is woke

If they did that Freddy would look like a nice cold sundae beside a pile of shit
---
I think I'm too young to get this?
---
Please keep in mind his last post to this reddit was him running basment bubba, I'm about to get downvoted for this but I'm 100% sure you were camping and got fucked up by a SWF that shit talked you in after game chat. People don't like camping bc it's boring, no one enjoys sitting on the hook, on the ground, or just doing gens and leaving.
---
They farmed me out lol. The entity wasn't happy that I was deceiving them.
---
Until you get all available perks for the survivor, the perks will keep reappearing.
---
So it‚Äôs not too large to get very rare self care?
---
Michael has to work damn near half the game to do to himself what these Survivors *want* to do to Plague. A good Killer should be able to mop all that vomit off the floor with a team that doesn't cleanse.
---
As long as you keep leveling, it will show up eventually.
---
Also, thank you a lot! This clears so much up for me lol
---
So I let the survivors farm me out before and during Endgame until now so they thought of me as a friendly killer before Bloodwarden activated .
---
500 is pretty accurate. I got all teachables around 500 hours, got the game back in March.
---
Self care and BK are very strong together
---
Thank you! What is the max level for a survivor?
---
He was a torturer for the CIA dude
---
Yeah he's not op, they just just have to work on those two things and I have no problems with him.
---
I did play him out on the ptb, dw I'm not speaking without any personal experience.
---
I think the people that have all the perks would also have a healthy amount of bs add ons
---
50, the same for killers, but you can keep leveling to get perks, items, add-ons, and offerings.
---
There's quite a bit of reading between the lines involved, but I like it.
---
It makes him less of a one-dimensional "ha ha ha I like hurting people because science" kinda character and into more of an actual person.
---
I will they looked at this subreddit more lmaoooo
---
Max level is 50 but you can prestige your characters. Perks you miss will always show up again until you have them!
---
I just play the game normally. I don't play like an ass using mori's or 5 blink Nurse, but I just try to kill people. Bloodpoints can be earned anytime.
---
Pfft, bullshit. I was still getting stabbed every game.
---
You're probably a clown main. don't talk to me LMAO
---
You still earn points for playing. Farming is so boring, I don't wanna do it so I'm going to play normally.
---
*screams in meg*
---
The thing is that you get so many points from farming but in a span of 20-30 min it takes to long. But in your case 3 streamers yea it's worth farming out.
---
exactly! behavior wrote a better character than people realize
---
play hillbilly
---
Imagine trying to get people to think youre cool on reddit lmao

And good Survivors should be able to effectively waste her time to allow the others to finish the gens.

---
Oooh she‚Äôs different
---
everyone already knew this
---
[removed]
---
50. Once you get to 50 you can prestige which resets your character completely. You lose all perks, offerings, items, etc. You can prestige 3 times and every prestige gives you a piece of bloody clothing/weapon and gives you slightly better odds at getting rare items in the bloodweb.
---
So you ran up inside the house and thought you were going to actually survive?
---
Thank you!
---
It's called feral frenzy, you activate it and it has a red bar gauge that depletes over time. When in feral frenzy, you move faster, can vault windows and pallets faster and can hit survivors and give them the deep wound status effect. If you damage a survivor using feral frenzy, a special ability called killer instinct is given to you, you can see where the other survivors are as long as they are in your terror radius and your power gauge gets refilled. If you miss a swing the bar depletes and your power ends. You can also end the power yourself. Upon the power ending, you will enter a fatigue state (similar to the nurse) for some time. Your power will automatically regenerate.
---
Plague is poopy for a number of ~~hitbox~~ reasons and Leatherface should never get a down on an entire group unless the Survivors are brain-damaged. Clown's instadown is also pretty bad if if Legion gets a down with Deep Wounds the Survivors are doing something incredibly wrong.
---
With all that being said I do agree on the others: Myers, Billy, and (Iri Head) Huntress are a lot more powerful than "Myers but he can't 99%." And that's to say nothing of Spirit and Nurse.
---
I'm really sick of people having a slight challenge and immediately demanding nerfs or disconnecting because they don't like to deal with difficulty. Player entitlement is a plague on this game that harms every aspect of gameplay. It's impossible to enjoy this game when people hold a ridiculous double stand of the opposing team not allowed to use anything good against them while they use top tier mechanics against them.
---
Dead hard was released well after exhaustion was put in, you could run balanced landing and spring burst though.
---
Not so much nerfed as reworked. DS and other stun reductions are gone, but its shorter on pallets now by like a quarter second ish?
---
Don't even waste your money on him when he come out we quitting when we see him.
---
Does anyone know if dark sense triggers when the killer closes the hatch and the gates are powered?
---
I can understand that sentiment.  I'm more aiming this at the Survivors and Killers that want to just end a game, bring Red Mori/insta downs, face camping, Gen Rush real fast, insta heals and such. 
---
 It's a rare event that can help everyone...letting off the gas for the event is not asking much...but Ive had plenty of games with 1-3 streamers used and people just sweating it and sorry you want to be "king" but I consider it selfish to not let some BP flow/share with others a bit.
---
They'll still have the 'dream objects' and awake Survivors to wake each other up with. 
---
There's also not that big of a penalty to being in the Dream World with the rework from what they've revealed so far (he won't see sleeping Survivors auras, their action speeds will only be reduced if Freddy is using a specific add-on, and he can already hit them while they're awake anyway).
---
Of course nothing's 100% finalized yet AFAIK; so we'll have to just wait and see.
---
When it's a rank 20 clauds that just blows up a gen on her first skill check unintentionally
---
It's Double Bloodpoint event and we had 3 Party Streamers that each give a 100% bonus and stacks. With a decent farm everyone comes out with bank.
---
Really? Thought this would be reference to the postgame chat
---
Hex: Ruin.
---
To slow the game down......jus a lil bit.
---
Wait he can hit them while awake?
---
Wont that mean he can essentially be like Wraith except he can still hit you even though you can't see him?
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs the Paint Brush. Could be wrong though.
---
I personally just loathe the Julie/Susie run animation. That weird trot with the T-Rex arms going just looks so awkward.
---
People said the first link didn‚Äôt work
---
It works okay with Dying Light and an Ivory Mori if you want to play that way, but even then they usually Wake Up before you can get to them.
---
Definitely not worth the Ultra Rarity tho.
---
I literally got stalked after dropping a pallet on him. He just stood there and stalked for like 1 second and downed me soon after. Def feels broken.
---
My laurie is level 1 but god fucking damnit this damn bloodhunt is gonna make me get it xD. i keep on getting farmed on hook :(
---
Not really, I don't know how to do it. But I've reinstalled the game like 3 times with no changes at all.
---
Outstanding move
---
According to the devs she has the highest win rate at Rank 1. She‚Äôs probably the best M1 Killer imo.
---
MONSTROUS SHRINE
---
That's literally what PGTW does just for completed gens.
---
My problem is that all killers should be balanced against each other and be equally viable.
---
New killers should either be Nurse-tier or Legion-tier, and BHVR should make a permanent irrevocable choice which it's going to be for all new killers, and then rework all current killers to match that choice.
---
Though real talk, getting 99-stalked by GF sounds like it's gonna be rather annoying, MM 99-stalking and popping EW3 already feels like a guaranteed catch; doing it per-person-but-faster won't feel much different on the receiving end.
---
Besides GF *can* expose my entire team at once, if there's anything rank reset taught me, it's that I'm always alone.
---
More than half as effective than before.
---
Because tapping control makes you toxic.
---
hell yeah
---
Did you play him on PTR? He never got to use his power before, then got a massive load of buffs.
---
Nope. It'll never show up ever ever ever again and your character will fall over and die
---
No.
---
Only just now do I realize that This is Not Happening is not someone nervously ripping an envelope in half.
---
Might as well take away Myers activating t3 in chase too
---
Pretty good theory, I now subscribe.
---
how do you manage to lose at rank 16
---
Or they got downed in the house and taken upstairs by Michael so he could defend the hook more easily?
---
Or they were working on the gen as he arrived and didn't have time to get away?
---
There's no reason to assume the worst about OP.
---
Yep, but I figured we could have a much longer animation because of the payoff
---
Why would you trust statistics from the devs?
---
imagine playing hag.
---
Reminds me of when I played a game as huntress and quickly downed a Claudette in the first 30 seconds of the trial.  Right as I'm putting her on the hook I hear a scream followed by loud crashing and then glass breaking.  My wife had dropped an entire full jar of pickles on the kitchen tile floor and it exploded into a million pieces.  I quickly ran in and she was standing frozen in a large puddle of pickle shrapnel and juice that was dripping from the cabinets and spreading into the next room over.  I spent the next 10-15 minutes helping her get clear of the mess and disposing of the puddle of pickle pieces. When I went back to see what had happened to poor Claudette, at least she had been saved from her hook where I had been standing motionless for the last 15ish minutes. Her teammates had finished the gens and all escaped already but Claudette remained and signed me to come here as soon as I started moving again.  I was going to chase her out but she stood at the hook where I had left her dangling while I was preoccupied with a pickle explosion.  She wanted to give me a kill even after hooking her and standing right in her face. I tried to dissuade her by shaking my mouse side as to signal NO! She didn't deserve it!    But alas she would not move from the hook. I felt bad, but she died an honorable death. 
---
The end.
---
Oof
---
I
---
I've been facecamped (like, literally standing there and whacking me) about 75% of my games this weekend. Getting facecamped should grant both bloodpoints and rank, because you've effectively stunned the killer for two straight minutes.
---
She probably does smell like death, I mean she is trapped in the Fog and hunted down.
---
immersive claudette just met her match lol
---
TLDR exists. Use it ...
---
Michael just wants to show you how much he loves you.
---
He's not evil, just misunderstood!
---
Hex: Not every individual never escapes death
---
Description-
---
A Hex rooting its power on hope, but not rewarding killers for being useless to the entity. You are animated by the power of your Hex Totem when the Survivors are on the verge of escaping.
---
Once the Exit Gates are powered, if there is a Dull Totem remaining on the Map, this Hex is applied to it.
---
While this Hex is active, Maybe a few survivors suffer from the Exposed Status Effect and your movement speed is increased by 2/3/4% 
---
The Hex effects persist as long as the survivors take to find it- duh 
---
‚ÄúYeah man, I mean some die some don‚Äôt. Who really cares at this point when nobody has any hope and only plays along for those tasty blood points?‚Äù - the entity
---
he's playing feng. literal rank 20
---
I don't mind farming or helping people farm if their team screwed them over, but every time I think a survivor is offering to farm, they just use it as an opportunity to escape.
---
Come on man, he‚Äôs a typical reddit warrior, he has nothing better to do with his life than try to be edgy on here.
---
It was like that ALL day on Xbox and Steam. Not even trying PS4.

noed on myers... ok
---
Farming isn't fun.
---
hex: 3 man
---
I lead them to Noed. Then I just slowly Charge up EW3 as my primary.
---
I was one of the most vocal people I know about hating the perk with a passion, but the rework one is absolutely fair.
---
I've been playing with a brand new friend who's a continent away, and my rank's pretty low because I've been playing mostly killer or other games. The amount of people that will 100% tunnel in every single situation makes it feel so good if you can get facecamped til gens are done, pulled off the hook, then DS out the gate.
---
Whenever I'm hit with it as killer these days it's like a reminder to stop playing cheap.
---
perks only show up once, sadly you missed your chance.
---
redemption arc
---
thank you üëåüò©
---
or you could just dc and not worry about it
---
I am aware of that. I still think back to how powerful the doctor used to be.
---
A scarecrow would make an excellent killer
---
I got genrushed despite bringing Franklins and let one of them go 'cause they got sandbagged, but she wanted her toolbox so stayed in the gate hoping I'd dribble her.
---
I was like fuck no, you can leave but you're not getting that toolbox back, particularly during 2x BP.
---
decisive strike is my fav
---
A sound notification would definitely be a good idea to help show survivors which completed generator is being damaged in the first place. 
---
The initial damage caused from kicking it could be 20% and then it could regress 50% if not touched by a survivor within 70 seconds?
---
The perks are literally just worst versions of perks already in the game
---
i actually see survivors use them more then killers lol
---
"oh no hes moving rapidly on my screen my day is ruined üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° im gonna facecamp you so hard"
---
Agreed
---
no mither
---
and yet people still facecamp
---
windows key &gt; snipping tool
---
You gotta use him like the doctor. Don't down then u til they are in full sickness. As they run around, make sure to tag windows, gens, and pallets to leave an area where other survivors start getting sick as well. 
---
By the end game, you have a few scattered corrupted fountains to down people like a madman. It's not a guarantee 4k, but it's a whole lot of fun!
---
you got facecamped so hard your computer killed itself in the process
---
Yeah, she blends into that light grey/silver wall that's being lit up by the finished generator's lights so well. /s
---
thats called playing against a hillbilly with begrimed chain and sloppy butcher
---
Just another damn reason to play as nurse or hillbilly, sigh, everything in this game really is about mobility isn't it?
---
Then slug them?? That‚Äôs two people not working on gens. DS is perfect the way it is.
---
I feel like that version of the map is bugged, whenever i play it, there are no visible pallets to me when im killer.
---
Except there‚Äôs an ebony mori
---
Stop playing legion
---
Jesus that‚Äôs dirty
---
I'm sorry I don't understand what you mean by this :\

You're laggy or the kilers are laggy. There's this thing called the ping indicator in lobby on the far right next to the textbox.
---
You can take screenshots by searching for snipping tool on windows search
---
Legion isn't Nurse-tier so no other killer deserves it either.
---
All for one, one for all.
---
You should do the wolf mask next, looks amazing!
---
How is it not annoying having a fast as fuck killer going around easily injuring everyone quickly the whole match
---
Looping is still ridiculously easy against a Killer with no power. At least Myers can power himself up in the middle of the chase if he needs to.
---
its caused by a perk called: Hex: Ugandan Internet
---
If you can kill me before you drop to 4 frames HahaahAhHahah.
---
Every time I get a game like this the killer ends up DCing lmao
---
yeah its hard to give the benefit of the doubt when he looks like literally every rank 20 ever
---
Yes they do
---
No,I didnt see the X on the heal icon
---
no!!! not three games out of several days of 2x bloodpoints!!!! :( how will you ever cope?
---
It's more me joking.  I've seen so few on either side. Most I've seen has been maybe....5 total used after dozen of games.  Guess I'm mostly unlucky on ppl not having em or nor using em (which may be a thing)
---
The toxicity in this community is definitely unlike others, I have never understood why. But in regards to being new to the game, have you watched anyone on YouTube play killer yet? A LOT can be learned that way. And if you haven‚Äôt played survivor yet i would highly recommend it. Even if it‚Äôs not your thing, It helps you to know how your opponent is playing and what kind of things work on both sides and maybe you will experience things you think are shitty and better know why it upsets people. Ultimately though, it‚Äôs a game. Play how you want to play and have fun with it. Sorry people have been so garbage towards you. Hopefully you can look past it and just enjoy the game :)
---
Your welcome.
---
I called foul after being called the asshole when all I said was my opinion on the adjustments needed for Ghostface
---
i had borrowed, saved another survivor, got camped. but thank you.
---
Me neither, because it's not an X
---
It‚Äôs going to be inevitable
---
Ahem, 2 games sir, likely the only 2 I will get to play because I'm busy all weekend for Father's Day... I forgot to mention that XD
---
So you saved against a camping killer. k.
---
You really ought to watch [this](https://youtu.be/JyWcUp8RcSE?t=1h12m4s).
---
It's the section of the anniversary live stream where they talk about the Freddy rework and should do a better job explaining than my sleep deprived brain could.
---
who cares about the kids get the bloodpoints
---
He definitely needs the exposed time to be nerfed. 45 seconds of being exposed is way too long for 2 seconds of stalking.
---
I wanna know if this is me lol. Same cosmetics I use for nurse

Speak for yourself. The grind isn‚Äôt fun.
---
If anything the entity would be very fucking pleased with this snakery
---
Yeah, but you're never going to meat a demon. That's what Halloween and Scream are based around. Halloween showed that a human can be a monster, and Scream showed that even your friends could be killers.
---
Sure Pinhead might beat Ghostface. But I can beat Pinhead by throwing away the VHS tape. Scream is about horror being plausible, not something imaginary. 
---
And saying Hellraiser was the dawn of "Legendary" killers is silly when Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Friday the 13th came years before it.
---
Beautiful
---
I was wondering about that earlier that I fed these 4 to the entity so how is it still displeased....
---
Basically it‚Äôs when survivors work together and rush through the gens as quickly as possible. Most of the time i see people  mention when two gens or more go off at once. There are aspects of both sides ,killer and survivors, people don‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs just one of those things.
---
Yeah legion does look kind of stupid, but holy shit, the legion menu music is the best variant of the dbd theme
---
Why do you care about fake internet points?
---
Freddy‚Äôs motivation is revenged for being rightfully accused of heinous acts. I don‚Äôt really sympathize with that
---
The only education I need for the clown is to not play him
---
There's something however I'd like to point out, and that's the length of the timer. I personally think it should be shorter because I played a Wraith game very recently in which I actually did my best not to tunnel and still got DS'd three times. I think the timer should be maybe 15-30 seconds shorter because, hell, even BT doesn't last that long and you only need 10 seconds for the "safe unhook."
---
I think most would fucking hate my guts for even suggesting even the slightest change because "it doesn't need a nerf" but sometimes it really is a pain because 60 seconds is too long. They should just reduce the timer a little bit and I'm a-ok with where it is.
---
This is the reason why a lot of people use BBQ and WGLF in any and all builds. More points makes it all more passable.
---
I mean come on. If you‚Äôre already injured, without borrowed time or anything that would help you, why the hell would you try and take someone off the hook in front of my fave the second i put them on and then send me 6 messages after the fact.
---
Keanu bout to murder the shit out of the killer
---
You sir are a fucking masterpiece.
---
Because that requires more effort then plucking them off the hook
---
It‚Äôs a bug, I‚Äôve had it happen a few times. Also had a gen half done that I couldn‚Äôt get to progress after going back to it. Fun stuff am I right!
---
Lol I wasn't expecting the last sentence but I agree. 
---
Screw D &amp; D and ppl who try to defend Season 8 with "you just don't like the last season because you didn't pay attention the subtle details" then talk about how Dany is evil for not crying when her brother died or for executing the Tarlys.
---
Well in the original it's ambiguous whether he actually did or not.
---
Although I guess DbD Freddy is the new, 100% confirmed to be pedophile.
---
Console is thirty frames capped. Or was anyways
---
Facinating so we can recreate the ways he killed his victims and take a selfie while we're at it.
---
Literally
---
What? I don't?
---
You could only get stabbed four times a game?
---
Ya know those ppl who run into you after being unhooked and you cant tell if they are being completely stupid or they have ds?
---
Oh yeah that's true lol, Myers is a pretty awesome character.
---
What "grind?"
---
Exactly! üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs because his power interferes with the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù survivors, who prefer to only play against 2 killers

---
That's a lot of extra health states for at least half-decent Survivors.
---
Why DS got nerfed but NOED is still unchanged boggles my mind
---
and he is p3, i hope he makes legion mains sad
---
So is it when outside communication is involved to finish gens quickly? Just because it seems to me that what you just described is exactly what survivors should be doing; working together to accomplish gens as quickly as possible. Not trying to be argumentative, I just genuinely don‚Äôt understand what else survivors would or should be doing
---
Yea ur right about the legendary killer thing I got my movie dates messed up, 4 some reason I thought hellraiser was 81. But Mikey is the greatest slasher of all time, at least his mask was good, but I‚Äôm talking about scary killers how scary a movie killer is movie wise and how they would be on DBD period not rl. I can get rid of ghostface by throwing away the movie 2 because technically he‚Äôs not real either. and even real killers serial killers they don‚Äôt seem scary to me. Regular guy slashers just bore me
---
Bloodpoint event, survivors are trying to get points asap  by farming people of hook
---
Don't be a fucking idiot
---
why do i even try to be nice :(
---
I love you. But people want to max achievements so be it. It's rude. People have different ideas on (shocking).
---
Don't get it, it's plaguing my blood webs. Like no, entity, I don't need dark devotion on pig.
---
Gen rushing = efficient survivor gameplay. This means always doing gens while not being chased, maximizing hooked survivors bleed out time (ie. Doing gens and making saves just before survivor enters struggle), bringing toolboxes to do gens faster etc. Any of these things will be pointed out as "gen rushing". The killer equivalent is "tunneling off the hoom" aka efficient killer gameplay. The problem with both of these playstyles is that generally nobody pips and games are very short. The current emblem ranking system encourages killers to play with their food and survivors to draw the game out as long as possible.
---
Extremely painful teleportation that rips your body apart and puts it back together, why do you think she's screaming?
---
Most of the time I see it mentioned for surviving with friends so swf matches however some people don‚Äôt like any kind of gen rushing.
---
You guys know you could just slug them right?
---
Name and flair check out :)
---
But I‚Äôm the killer...
---
I see. I guess I‚Äôm just at a loss because the only thing you CAN do as a survivor is gens. Like, people complain about tunneling and sure it‚Äôs the most effective strategy but you can argue that it‚Äôs better etiquette to go after the unhooker or whatever, so I get why that‚Äôs a thing people debate. But there‚Äôs literally nothing else you‚Äôre supposed to or even able to do as a survivor.
---
Also, you‚Äôre right about the pip thing. I was literally thinking to myself today ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm playing really efficient and doing a ton of gens, why haven‚Äôt I pipped?‚Äù And yeah I guess you‚Äôre right; the game doesn‚Äôt really reward you for efficiency.
---
I love over charge. I play a slow, late game with my Doctor and boy is it effective
---
You should really look back before you make more of a fool out of yourself.
---
I mean leatherface was too
---
The killer argument is that it sucks having a game end in 5 mins. The survivors argument is that killers should pressure gens. So killers use perks like ruin because it helps apply that pressure, also the top tier killers are also the most mobile and that mobility helps map control/gen pressure.
---
The survivors then complain all they see are nurses and Billy's while being toxic as fuck when they dumpster a new clown or wraith.
---
welcome to r/punresistance
---
I like the It‚Äôs Safe Here perk. Very interesting. This inspires me to make a survivor concept as well. Good job
---
That‚Äôs what I try lol; just play to have fun. That‚Äôs why I actually don‚Äôt really like people trying to farm during these BP events, but that‚Äôs a different discussion lol
---
The numbers Mason! What do they mean!?
---
Show me where I looked back at all the messages and don‚Äôt see it
---
Leatherface (so was psycho) was inspired by Ed Gein. The things the characters did weren't actually things that happened in real life. GhostFace is almost exactly the same, just with a different attire.
---
I‚Äôd use it if I had it unlocked rip
---
Me and my friend keep on getting campers
---
flee the facility is actually better than dbd tbh
---
omg you hit someone through a pallet?
---
UNHEARD OF
---
The roblox game? Lmao it is good but it has worse campers then DBD
---
play meg
---
thicc
---
Wasn't Texas Chainsaw Massacre inspired by Ed Gein?
---
When has it ever been relevant? lol
---
I mean he‚Äôs not wrong but he is at the same time. If you just hooked the man and then he‚Äôs running in for the save that‚Äôs not camping. But if you stayed near the guy a while after and you saw him coming then it‚Äôs camping
---
Does ever killer have shitty internet sheesh..
---
ngl you can legit infinite the killer on the crawl vents
---
Yeah but the character Leatherface wasn't as close to Ed Gein as GhostFace is to Danny Rolling
---
Damn looks sick!
---
I see that. Granted, I don‚Äôt play killer often (and when I do I play trapper who it seems like the community thinks is pretty bad), but to me it‚Äôs not that hard to monitor the gens. I expect survivors to get like 2 gens done, but after that it becomes fairly easy to keep pressure on the gens. If all the gens get finished quickly it‚Äôs usually because I did a bad job
---
I literally went to investigate a explosion then suprise suprised guess who I see running in for the save.
---
Myers have tiers
---
Nope, PC.
---
a nonexistent term used by people who suck at the game as an excuse for why they lost
---
That‚Äôs not camping at all. He‚Äôs just a salty survivor
---
Meg for her perks and then i‚Äôd do nea for balanced landing. Also Dwight in the future for bond.
---
What's this? A place where survivors acknowledge the toxicity killers experience instead of flaming them for playing the game? As a killer player, I approve. So many survivors laugh at me on this sub when I tell them how privileged their side has been. Pallet vacuums, infinite loops, permanently sabotaged hooks, sprint perks without exhaustion, THEN exhaustion that recovered while running, decisive strike on release. Yet this subreddit seems to be hellbent on attacking killers for complaining about survivors' hateful second chance builds. Meanwhile killers don't have anything nearly as op, yet survivors on this sub swear up and down that killers are hateful subhuman trash.
---
pure kobe beef right there
---
Get the teachables you think will suit your playstyle the best, pick someone you want to play the most, and get all the teachables on them.
---
Yeah they did just not in the game. Gein made stuff outta human bones and made masks of flesh. Idk about psycho. Most horror movies are based off of some killer out there anyway
---
evil within tier 4
---
My favorite part is the survivors who say they're using streamers in the pre-game chat and then they all bring escape cakes instead while I get conned into using my streamers.
---
This is definitely making it to hot
---
Who do you main for killer? -just curious no hate i respect your opinion
---
Im not trying to be toxic, honest
---
Put a small piece of a sticky note on the center of your monitor.  That‚Äôs where your hatchets fly
---
how does borrowed time help him from being facecamped...
---
Yeah, same here. I wait for his videos every day haha
---
I was thinking fair too. Slam it down to pick it back up again would be annoying maybe but if they can do it 3 times maximum then shouldn't be too bad.
---
I am above internet points, bow down before me mortals
---
Not all are toxic or salty don‚Äôt assume or stereotype
---
Run beast of prey if you can, it's like having all 5 totems up the whole game (at T3)
---
These guys seriously lost to a freddy and then proceeded to report and talk shit
---
Well the only op killer is nurse and spirit with certain add-ons sooo...
---
I bet people are gonna downvote you, i would‚Äôve done what you would‚Äôve i hate people that just try to ruin your mood
---
Its alright. Pretty lame its not a phone anymore
---
true true
---
I hate this so much
---
I find the Digital Camera better suited. Giving the time the movies were set.
---
Aaaah it's the killer
---
yeah it was a rank 1 on their smurf and im a rank 17 sooo
---
And after ghostface it'll give lightbringer points too
---
survivors didnt loop back then? damn... dead by daylight is really a different game now huh
---
4 times as much?
---
The game has to be easier for survivors by nature. It's a 4v1 so if there wasn't something to bring 4 players to play survivors then we would just end up with killers and no ques.
---
At low ranks the 4k rate is huge but at the middle to red ranks when people know tiles and how to juke the kill rate goes down considerably.
---
Survivors are by far more relaxing to play and the worst thing you have to deal with are people that dc or screw up badly.
---
I can‚Äôt really think of a way to fix it tho, at least in terms of the rank system.  Maybe make it more like blood points? Cuz there are games where I‚Äôll have like, maxed out altruism but no boldness (cuz I never got chased or caught) and there‚Äôs no reward for my rank
---
Cant be I'm running a smooth 250 mbps
---
being an m1 killer doesnt mean hes not viable
---
It's still a game and some people want to play it, not everyone is paying attention to events and the community they just fire up the game and play it. It's a hard concept in 2019 it seems.
---
Well us console players are having the same problems so your not alone
---
i mean, if you've seen all the movies you'd know why she ended up like that
---
Delet This
---
sure bud
---
They still do, and you tell them, ‚Äúhey if you never tunnel you‚Äôll never get DSd again‚Äù and they VEHEMENTLY deny it
---
so you just spend a minute crossing the entire map?
---
yeye uwu
---
Add 60 seconds to solo gens and make it 3 hits to down survivors. Then I see balance.
---
&gt;should do a better job explaining than my sleep deprived brain could.
---
I laughed, thanks
---
im a bell boy from potato tier, i am an okay bing bong boi in my opinion. I think its cause before i got dbd i watched thousands of dbd videos (people playing survivor and killer using their own tactics.)
---
as if the guy sees the post
---
truly sad
---
Power: Muda Muda Muda
---
Ps4 it don't matter your rank that is 90% of all matches.
---
a h 110 legion
---
Well on the bright side, you never have to worry about respecting the pallet too hard and getting looped.
---
realistically I really like him as a killer too, I was just really salty after having the piss scared out of me three games in a row, lol
---
Now that‚Äôs bs.
---
i am I just find nurse boring and most other killers are somewhat unreliable. Plus this is only for the double bloodpoints I just wanna chill
---
IM CRYING THIS IS EVERYTHING
---
Isai is the reason where pretty much ANYTHING in Melee is. All of that precious tech skill everyone loves pretty much comes from Isai. Shield dropping? Isai. Hax dashing? Isai. People don't realize how influential he really was.
---
Yes. I‚Äôm actually done with the game. It‚Äôs too grindy for me
---
If it wasn't for the event I wouldn't be playing right now. Rank reset always ruins the game for a few days.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm a masochist but I think I‚Äôd like it to be...maybe not harder, but scarier for survivors? To me, DBD was advertised as a horror game and should remain as such. What that means in terms of gameplay changes I have no idea, just my thoughts
---
But the womens are soft and sweet, incapable of the atrocities of the patriarchy!!
---
My first DbD post game message on PS4 as killer was "u r the gey".  Since that time the messages have shared a similar theme.
---
Weirdly she is smiling under the mask in game. Seeming like she really enjoys it.
---
NOED has counterplay, old DS didn't.
---
No, but rotating it 360 degrees is. In comparison to M&amp;K that is. Again, sorry I don‚Äôt have the 9 Million IQ that you clearly possess. If you don‚Äôt like it, you don‚Äôt have to say shitty things. You can just downvoted and move on.
---
Well it cant really be harder because as mentioned survivors before they learn to deal with things suck. If it was harder it would deter people from playing.
---
Beautiful.
---
Lol probably. This is coming from a player who hasn‚Äôt seen single digit ranks yet. Working on it, almost there.
---
These are awesome!
---
Juggling and slugging?
---
Says others are toxic, yet you're the one who insulted people. Enjoy the consequences of your actions.
---
Wow, you deserve a permanent ban.
---
the amount of killers that pretend to farm then just kill you is high
---
Not all them are I've met some pretty great people on xbox but when I am unfortunate to get matched with salty and toxic people it really runs the experience
---
Any map with god damn cornfields.
---
This happened to me a while ago. The solution is to just troll back with something that makes no sense.
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Very true. I think in terms of difficulty the game feels actually kinda fair to me. All I‚Äôm saying is I think it could benefit from being spookier but oh well. Thanks for answering the original question btw :)
---
We should all get together and buy this guy a log splitter.

The issue was happening to me on coldwind farm, so it has to be the pallets themselves.

Meanwhile here in 2019, the same number of survivors still use it after it was "ruined"
---
That‚Äôs a good opinion. Based on your style of gameplay, I guess l. I see it becomes hard for you to have fun at red ranks. I will not lie and say a random number of hours, but I have been rank 1 on both sides enough. If you have enough time to go to basement and go around opening chests as a survivor on red ranks, you must have one hell of a team. But for you to put your two cents and ‚Äúthinking‚Äù one is not a good survivor is foolish.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kind of been a rule for awhile that you can‚Äôt use cuss words on Xbox....and that‚Äôs the exact reaction they want from you so they can get you banned. Good job, ez ban.
---
Dbd is a political battle and it‚Äôs annoying. This us vs them mentality is SO not needed to get a point or problems across.
---
I am getting sick and tired of being hooked and camped by rank 15-20 killers. All they do is down me, hook me, and tunnel me tf down. I seriously wish they buffed D-strike because tunneling is op as hell
---
i literally came here to say that
---
Wow, best meme I've seen on this Reddit in awhile
---
So you want a killer that cannot be looped at all?How else are survivors supossed to survive?Hide all game?
---
Which is fine. It‚Äôs a great compromise.

Acting so hostile. I am sorry that you find rotating a camera 360 degrees a very, very difficult task. So much so you must make a separate thread on it

I also made a new color variant to make it look like a CGA DOS pic.

---
I even hear streamers say that and it‚Äôs quite hilarious. It‚Äôs like what else are survivors supposed to do fucktard? That is all a survivor needs to de to escape its just quite hilarious.
---
Just like the term "killrushing" sounds dumb, because it is dumb, and just like "genrushing" it doesn't exist. Both sides have an objective.
---
At what rank do you play?
---
I'm having the opposite problem I'm back to my typical rank 8 and am now stuck with all the try hard red rank killers that are trying to get back to their original rank
---
Well it's possible she grew to like killing people. 
---
Or maybe she finds it less offensive because the Survivors don't actually die.
---
Or, given that Julie bald and looks like [she's heard a few rumors about a thing humans do called "facial expressions"](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/05/83/2b0583cf966ec9bad1750e1d28a5684c.png) sans her mask there may not be a reason behind Susie's smile.
---
Yeah amazing game, for the true ending you‚Äôll need to not kill anyone at all.
---
Let me guess, your the part of the rotten bunch. People can play who the fuck they want to, just because you think a killer or survivor is trash, does not mean you should try and stop someone from playing a killer they enjoy. Opinions exist
---
But the counter play exists. No matter how shitty and unfair it might be there is counter play... Isn't that the point you were making?
---
Yeah it can be suicide without it lol
---
Shhhh don't tell them my secrets
---
I have to agree here.
---
It's time to cut that cord and get some DBD matches going, kid!
---
What are you even doing with your life??
---
Juggling requires you to be lucky and down survivors near hooks, and even so, it has counterplay too. Slugging is not a ds counter.
---
So when I hold down l2 what will it do please?
---
No it doesnt
---
It goes both ways, just today as a survivor I‚Äôve seen a ton of teams just pound gens in just a couple minutes against noob-ish killers (I haven‚Äôt played in a few weeks and got my rank reset a couple times since then) to the point where I‚Äôve had quite a few killers DC
---
Holy shit this is funny!
---
I‚Äôve seen way more tunneling Pigs than any other killer
---
Ah yes the invisible pallet perk. Only slightly more annoying than Claudette‚Äôs stealth mode
---
I do that a lot especially with survivors who try to vault a window but end up getting sucked into a locker like that fucking room in Azarovs resting place. Happens to me a lot and it tilts me to no end
---
On Myers it'll fill a the meter near the bottom left corner. 
---
Again I dont know how Ghostface works
---
Just dc then. Literally no one cares
---
Opinions do exist and yours is trash
---
When you use DS and the killer keeps tunnelling you
---
Why did I stop scrolling for this?
---
With botany, not self care.
---
It's good the aura are improved, but the map is still bad regardless. It's just so hard to see and it has so much damn clutter.
---
Had a survivor rage at me today because the other 3 survivors dc'd a minute into the match. Like, dude, I just want this game to be over with so I can move on to the next one. It's not worth spending 20 minutes farming for each of us to have maybe 15k points when in that time we could have moved on and gotten twice that in the next game.
---
If you don't care why did you feel the need to comment? Don't read and move along. :)
---
Offense taken
---
For perks, her most go to is ruin, bbq, nurses calling and whispers or sloppy butcher. For tips and guides I suggest you watch scottjunds huntress guide
---
**R.I.P. Cashier Carl** - *Gone from this earth, but not from our hearts.*
---
Okay and when it fills up what does it do please?
---
Just go read the description in game
---
Good things about the switch version coming out soon is that Nintendo doesn't have a message system. 
---
Some guy messaged me for an hour or so because he kept whining that I camped. Playing Doctor with distressing and the Calm add on makes my terror radus the size of NYC. But some people are too stupid to understand how builds work. 
---
I camped so hard I got a 4% camping reduction time guys.
---
I swear it be the people with that pfp that talk the most shit
---
Revitalize is more of those people that don‚Äôt hook the people and just have them grouped up.
---
There's never enough Michael to go around.
---
Now Hillbilly or Nurse, that's a different story.
---
So if my stalk is max, next time I go up to a survivor after I stalk them, they can't hear me till its to late basically? Or if I have tier 3 can I just chase them without stalking and they sti won't hear heart beat till ages
---
236K with Basement Bubba
---
pretty sure it does. healing in a blink of a Nurse
---
lag switching is a thing
---
seen it against a billy, as a survivor. We both walked into an invis pallet and he looked at me and then back to the pallet like "you seein this bro''
---
Ah, the salt was real on that one. Salt everywhere. The floors. The walls. The ceiling............the AIR.
---
Says you. there's no lie in my 900 hours, and I mainly solo queue, so there is no helluva team. Sounds to me like you have no reason to be complaining about BP if you're having so much fun.
---
No they'll hear you.
---
You can chase them but you'll have a 32m terror radius
---
This story is wholesome
---
I got this. Screenshot it and made it my PS4 theme background.
---
Looks real nice.
---
Lol,  I'm always curious if these killers are new or just enjoy trolling people.  
---
Either way, I dont see how it's fun to stand there for 2 minutes, beside the fact that you are punished for doing so on your score. *shrug*
---
Nice edit though
---
I feel like to balance it a bit, add a notif for the killer, or make it an exhaustion perk
---
Now I can get to stompin' in my Air Force Puns...
---
People that say ‚Äú don‚Äôt cleanse‚Äù so you don‚Äôt give her the power are crazy. I think she is severely underrated her vomit with Add-ons can make it to where your insta-broken if she lands it all. Additionally since its vomit and not a hit survivors don‚Äôt get a speed boost when they lose the health state hence its easier for her to close the gap if theres no pallets around. Survivor gets hooked and spread the disease to each other you can not cleanse and be 1 shot which is not the play in my opinion no matter how strong ‚Äúlooping‚Äù is. I think she‚Äôs a super solid pick your poison type killer.
---
Stalking mid chase. Jesus you are blunt
---
Basically, hold down the ‚ÄòStalk‚Äô button to outline an survivor in white. After that white survivor flashes orange, they can now be downed with a single hit. While stalking, Ghostface needs to have them in his line of sight. The differences between Ghostface and Michael is that while Ghostface stalks exclusively one survivor for the one-shot downing, Michael can stalk multiple at once, and gets a range of buffs and stuff when stalking.
---
Damn straight you can. Get out there lad!
---
Salt
---
I assume it‚Äôs because you hit the million bloodpoint cap, it had to deduct 3k as to remain within the limit. Spend some points dude!
---
That's We'll make it by itself. The perk says "cumulative healing bonuses cannot exceed 100%" you'd be wasting a perk slot.
---
D o i n G e n s , y o u ?
---
I know what you were referring to, but both killers are different in how their stalking mechanics work and their rewards. You're comparing apples to oranges.
---
I would but i don‚Äôt know who to use them on
---
Yup. Lots of people get off on ruining the event for others
---
The entity can yoink people from any time in the past
---
Don't know what group of people you're playing with but I wish I had them on my team.
---
128 on survivor
---
You're running Dying Light and admitting to tunneling during a bloodpoint weekend? 
---
That's pretty garbage of you tbh.
---
Looks great! 
---
i miss the uwu placeholder face lol
---
That's the most evil thing I've ever seen
---
I wasn‚Äôt really tunneling, it was more like, either Dwight or the obsession, and I chose to chase the obsession, cuz ya know, dying light
---
This is some quality memeage right here
---
I'll have 2 Very Rare add-ons, an Ultra Rare Add-on, A hex NOED with extra salt, two overpowered perks, one with a hex, and a bloodpoint offering.
---
Can confirm, I do the same.
---
Well I've always been one to believe both sides have good and bad, but it genuinely makes me sad to see any players getting abused for just playing the game as intended; killers are an important part of the game and whether one enjoys it, you know? I'd much rather leave my matches with some positivity. Never ever approve of BM from others and apologise for it often.
---
And I say that as a survivor main that gets bullied in game a lot for maining Quentin. Never ever taken it personally though, you guys are human and you're valid. &lt;3
---
Thought I remembered your name lol
---
Ok you should delete this post, now the survivor mains gonna find that location!!!
---
can't we all just be happy ghostface is in the game in the first place pls
---
Finally sprint burst is good again
---
I‚Äôm quite happy my Mr X killer concept stuck with you for so long
---
Damn. That was Ice cold.
---
But imagine if I was a different person and you just said that to some random dude he‚Äôd be so confused
---
okay I agree with you about Face but saying a smart LF can instadown a whole team is like saying I can perform heart surgery with no practice. I mean yes, its possible, but not really
---
You seem a little upset.
---
how did you *not* notice it, though
---
It was unworkable. And the "counters" you suggest were actually exploits. The devs left them in because it had nothing else. Now there's real counters, and I've noticed that the number of people using decisive is the same as it was before the nerf. So I'm inclined to think those who see it as trash are only seeing their reflection.
---
Deliverance*
---
Fair point.
---
I'm not gonna cause, well, good luck to them, but very valid point nonetheless.
---
Nea is killer
---
Shirtless Myers
---
OINK OINK
---
I see no dumb memes. Just 1 fact, 1 dream and 1 life style.
---
Mettle of man doesnt work, Jon.
---
The other 3 survivors escaped, so it wasn't really rewarded.
---
If he was doing so poorly it sounds like there was plenty of time to cleanse totems as well.
---
Me learning how to lean
---
This is the best reply, thank you
---
Ok let's take out the memes, what's left?
---
Oh just people bitching about the game and people posting their "toxic" end game chats that they think people care about. Oh and can't forget the twitch streamers advertising their channels that no one will watch.
---
That‚Äôs an understatement
---
He has counterplay now he didn't before.  He can't moonwalk you down, he can't endlessly tunnel you while spamming ability swings and misses.  If you can loop a killer he is just as susceptible to that as any of them now.
---
His ability can be juked, one missed swing equals a free stun and run.  Even if he does tag you, that's basically the end of his ability, he still has to hit you a second time as a basic m1 killer.  He just doesn't feel cheesy anymore so most survivors have softened their stance on playing him.
---
So my opinion that others are entitled to their own opinion is trash? Got it chief. People can play who they want to.Your just toxic.
---
Haha I‚Äôm just joking. Btw, the Doctor? Good choice! I‚Äôm the Doctor main.
---
The Order of Knights Who Go "NI"
---
Set your messages to friends only. It‚Äôs the only way killer is bearable on PS4
---
*haunted grounds*
---
Me meeting my one true love at the ironworks window
---
it takes 192 levels to get every perk on a survivor plus the 150 to get to p3
---
Me: *makes meme about Pig cosmetics coming in 3 days*
---
meme: *removed in 10minutes since it is not related to the game*
---
This meme: *Doesn't get removed*
---
me: OKAY WTF?
---
[Vid Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpRPl8TlVBU) I thought I had escaped the Misadventures of Skooks once and for all, and yet here it is.
---
Just started leveling him today (as you can tell by the 3 low level perks). I'm a Spirit main, and only been playing for a little while. Got him to nearly 40 today.
---
I get way more BPs with Doctor though, even when everyone escapes, so I'm running him through the event. I like him though.
---
trash survivor gg ez
---
Le suffocation and death has arrived
---
The survivors can go for totems, play as a team and try to help each other in chases, a whole host of things that they avoid when gen rushing.
---
*oh my god* it‚Äôs somebody touching 2 exposed wires together. I literally thought the same thing until now.
---
If you can‚Äôt beat em, join em
---
Cuz ya know tunnelings ok? But if they body blocked hooks and woulda caused you to drop the obsession everytime you woulda got mad
---
I don't get it
---
The character of Learherface was entirely fictitious.  Every character in the movies was.  The only reason they say it was inspired by Ed Gein is because he made furniture and shit out of body parts from corpses he stole.  Everything else is pure fiction.
---
The Doctor reminds me a lot of MK Ultra. It's interesting and terrifying at what the U.S. government did to it's own citizens.
---
Did your teammates crouch around the basement stairs for the entire 2 minutes?
---
There's still no direct counter to it especially now that enduring won't work. It still works almost the same, what counters are you even talking about? You either don't tunnel (which is a good thing, I'm not saying it like it's a bad thing) or slug. I do agree that it's really good now and not just plain overpowered, though. I never claimed that it was bad.
---
I also don't see how you think slugging is an exploit. There's multiple killer perks that are made for it, and multiple survivor perks to counter it. Juggling was an exploit though obviously and that's why it's gone with new DS.
---
You know, this exchange got me thinking. You know a common complaint is that survivors don't have enough objectives and games go too fast? That problem would be immediately solved if every killer ran NOED. That makes dull totems as important as gens and you will get punished for not doing them.
---
I just think it‚Äôs funny the guy playing the role with nearly all the power in the game thinks being entitled is bad.
---
Like.. there **are** moments in the game where it *can* be strong and very beneficial to you... but those odds are like a *once in a blue moon* type.
---
Otherwise it‚Äôs a waste of a Perk slot and probably also going to waste you a Hook State as well.
---
The new DS is a perfect perk, in my opinion.
---
I have ONE rule for changing the Game:
---
1) Keep the same amount of Saw references or add more.
---
Stop being a prick
---
Basically any stupid ghostface variant you've seen in Halloween stores, it's possible we can get that as a cosmetic, I like that alot
---
That goes into an issue that the devs haven't found a great solution to. They've talked about giving the survivors more objectives to do because staying on gens all game really makes the gameplay stale for survivors, yet the game balance needs to be considered. 
---
That's why I hope that if they need to slow down the match, they can potentially find other ways to do it than just making gens even slower to do.
---
YASSS I LOVE
---
I was not being serious but go ahead and take it that way
---
I don't even see them most of the time, there's a "memeless mode" link in the right hand sidebar just about the current shrine of secrets. Sadly doesn't work on mobile app, only in the browser.
---
Exhaustion perk would work
---
Given we're on pace with the rate of content being released to surpass the old legacy grind  this upcoming year, I can definitely say this game 100% still has a grind.
---
In a way it's worse. While the old webs were convulated and more expensive than what we have currently, the perk pool was drastically smaller so you had an easier time getting what you want.
---
Uhhhh source for the Trapper/Meg art? Asking for a friend
---
This is pretty racist ngl
---
Survivors only get that many points when they win, that's the problem
---
I was saying that almost every pallet spawn is safe there, not that there's always pallets in those spawns.  
---
The Game, much like Lery's, is a very luck-based map with almost no mind-gaming, just hope you get the right setup.
---
I agree with that, their are certain killers you play on certain maps you pretty much have to file in a GG and take the L.
---
I use overcharge instead of bbq and NOED instead of ruin
---
And what does 32m terror radius do? That basically sounds like they can hear me from across the map how is the useful hahha
---
Understood tysm. So if I have a 32m terror radius is that really shitty, like they can hear me coming from ages away?
---
I'm running BBQ for the event and bloodpoints.
---
I gotta have Ruin.... I'm not that good. Haha
---
Kinda thinking of replacing Discordance with Overcharge though.
---
With every new character they release, the grind increases more and more, every new perk makes the grind a lot worse for getting the perks you want, a good way to delete this horrible grind but not have every killer run an ebony mori every game would be to abandon perk tiers, let it be so that you only have to buy a perk 1 time instead of three
---
Ok before posting this I was contemplating because I knew this could be a possibility. But they‚Äôre both Chinese so I thought it was ok, but yeah you‚Äôre right
---
Monitor and Abuse is bad on Doc, you want a large terror radius at all times, not only when chasing.  
---
Discordance isn't useful; your illusions will show you where survivors are.  
---
I'd instead use Enduring + Spirit Fury to help you with chases.
---
Garbage? He is using a perk. How is this garbage lol? He isnt tunneling for whatever reasons. He is using the perk.
---
Isn't that the paint brush? It's gonna be one of his red addons
---
I use pretty much the same build on every killer (aside from Legion, he's the one I farm on)
---
Well there was a journal entry about the Trapper written by Benedict Baker in 1896. So he‚Äôs pretty old.
---
This should probably be given the "salt/rant" flair instead.
---
Honestly a good idea, but a bit broken when you realize you could burn them on yellows, which are cheap and common. Maybe require at least XX charges (more than the yellow at least) to work?
---
I feel your pain

---
Defensive strike*
---
If you're gonna play that way class photo is just a straight upgrade to that, you just memorize which survivor is which in the lobby, and use their auras to find your obsession, but sadly (or gladly, depending on your opinion on this build) the dying light, remember me, end game tunnel the obsession build has died with the changes to ds, the addition of MoM, and the egc causing remember me to be nerfed to the ground.
---
Best icon i have ever seen tbh
---
Jesus Christ bhvr...
---
Its actually the other way around, if it doesn't say it _doesn't_ stack then it does.
---
I only dropped him once
---
I don't think so
---
Wait really? Proof?
---
Stop acting like a clown
---
He lost his temper and cussed at her, lol everyone here acting like they have never lost their temper before. People like her are jackasses.
---
This is the quality of memes we should strive for.
---
Fair points. Discordance is definitely a waste.
---
Curious about the terror radius though - care to explain the thought behind wanting a larger one?
---
Well shouldn't lightborn be that strong?
---
Even if it‚Äôs not double, I think a lot of things for both sides could change about BP. The 8k point cut off, for survivors especially, feels so arbitrary give how easy it is to max out. 10-12k feels better imo since often you‚Äôre regulated to a single role in a match that only yields points on one axis. Or at least let us exchange items, add ons, and offerings for BP. I‚Äôm sitting on an ungodly amount of trashy offerings that I‚Äôll never use, and I bet nearly everyone else is too. Letting us exchange them for BP back helps with the grind and I know would feel better than having to take yet another clear regeant.
---
Survivors are not entitled to survive.
---
Killers are not entitled to get a kill.
---
We have to WORK for it, bye proving us against others, using 4 instaheals, face camping, tunneling, using old DS and current MoM does not equal working for it. We should redesign the ranking system to have these people go to rank 14 and not further.
---
Is this the work of an enemy stand?
---
Which is?
---
I mainly play killer. I guess my "favorite" perk on killer would have to be Mad Grit or Dark Devotion. Neither are very strong, but they're a ton of fun when you do get to use them and laugh maniacally.
---
My favorite survivor perk is the reworked DS. I never really got to use the other kind, anyways. It only does one particular thing, sure, but boy howdy do I love when I get to use that thing. I've made at least two escapes I couldn't get otherwise with that one.
---
...
---
pleasedon'tsay"haha"
---
Bruh
---
Distressing, Unnerving Presence, Overcharge, BBQ. That works for me.
---
Like wouldn't having a 32m terror radius suck? Means they hear u 32m away?
---
Then again, that was because the 360's disc drive was hacked quickly in a matter of months. The Xbone has a lot more checks compared to the 360, especially with online games. AFAIK theres no way to break the hypervisor yet or anything else,so cheating shouldn't be possible
---
Right on. I'll look into it.
---
That‚Äôs not what I meant haha, I mean if they did body block and sabo hooks you‚Äôd call them toxic
---
WAHHHHH WAHHHHH
---
Lmao ikr?
---
You can read em on the wiki
---
Write their name's on a list, and next time you play killer, and you see them, bring a mori for them
---
Strangely enough, player as survivor, I have yet to run into a farming killer. They've all been tryhards.
---
I've been playing mostly killer because of it, of which I'm mostly farming.
---
Impossible skillchecks is a fun variation. Overcharge, Unnerving Presence, Huntress Lullaby, and Distressing.
---
Everytime a bloodhunt happens I get so many items on my killers it's insane. You can run any build anytime on anyone
---
Double bp would have to come with a bloodweb rework
---
Usually ruin, overcharge, distressing and nurses. If I have been playing against salty survivors I replace nurses with NOED.
---
Right?
---
distressing, beast of prey, thrill and a random perk because I dont have bbq
---
It's a pretty solid build. Plus you get a lot of bloodpoints.
---
So you guys are happy about the nerf, but saying you used the perk?
---
God you can tell Im a blind killer because it took me squinting at this to see it
---
I dont play killer during events,so idc tbh. If you are a killer main, you really have to bring patience.
---
Well, in their defense, I do farm with survivors a lot. Gotta get those bloodpoints boi
---
No because your attacks will put them in the dying state in t3, regardless if they are healthy or injured.
---
Unless you're going for a specific Doc build(stealth Doc), having a small terror radius as Doctor will only hurt him as his static field is based on TR - you want to get as many people in Madness whenever possible.
---
I ALMOST considered doing this today on my Huntress that I got everyone to farm with me. Had people lining up in front of Lockers to take a spin, them,crouching and head nodding... 360 spin Hatchets at em, the whole 9 yards
---
Meanwhile a lil voice in my head told me *In Emperor Palpatine's voice* "DO IT!" ...I had Blood Warden Rank 3 on and I was SO tempted to do this to em xD.  However, they were the second group to actually farm with me and the first group where 2 peeps used Bloody Party Streamers alongside my own....I wanted to honor the trust agreement because nobody else has xD
---
thank you, finally someone understands me.
---
Maybe I‚Äôll get my adept trophies. :/
---
I think the option to purchase it during the event would please the people who can't grind out the event but still want the cosmetics, and sure, you could always purchase the cosmetics and not be forced to grind out the event, but anyone who has the time to do so should just grind it out to save money, and who's saying that you'll only want one outfit, spending 20 bucks just because you're too lazy to grind it out isn't something that'll be the same with every player. On the other hand, players will be less encouraged to grind it out while they can because, to put it simply, the cosmetic isn't worth as much when anyone with a fat wallet can just take all our hard work and throw it out the window by purchasing it at any time in the shop. Having a time limit to either grind it our or purchase it would force the player-base to keep it as an exclusive and the people who end up purchasing it would be less disliked because at least they were around during the event to purchase it in the first place, instead of being brand new and just buying the cosmetic right off the bat.
---
So basically you want them to hear you from ages away, cause if they do your hits are stronger? And my one problem with the game is I gotta keep hooking people they don't die literally.
---
Oh yea I had some games like that I know how you feel in those situations man. Those games I just actually farm with them at that point.
---
I didn't use it, like I don't even own Laurie as I want to buy dlc when I'm switching to PC, I use it now for the anti tunneling
---
Yeah, I'm noticing a theme here with the responses.
---
I've been approaching him all wrong.
---
I'm a Spirit main and was sort of running her build, which is obviously wrong. 
---
Never played The Doctor before today, so I'm quite ignorant to what he's best at.
---
Or press Alt + Printsceen to take a screenshot of the active window
---
don‚Äôt disrespec ghost boi
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, just spend some on anybody! If you‚Äôre really not sure, just do it like 100k at a time, you‚Äôll earn them back quick.
---
Hot take; DBD Ghostface's lore is infinitely more interesting than most of the Ghostface lore given in the films
---
BBQ, Brutal, Enduring and Ruin/STBFL/NOED
---
MaA sucks ass on Doctor, so does Discordance.
---
And you need to run at least a moldy electrode him if you wanna actually use your shock.
---
Both sides to this community have their panties wound EXTRA tight up their arses during events like this. Unless I see people being decent during a game, I consider majority of players to be selfish tryhards
---
Yeah I guess it‚Äôs just o don‚Äôt play the game that much and I‚Äôm saving up for GhostFace I guess I could put 100k or so on my Billy or Pig
---
You've had 3000 points docked from Gryffindor
---
You're right and you should say it. Its scarier that he's so invested in what he does and is even willing to work with the entity.
---
seriously? but then its utterly redundant, coz then the killer can just wait for the timer to stop to get you. I know i'd abuse the crap out of it if it was any shorter.
---
Oh man, been forever since I've seen the Skooks poops.
---
BBQ on any killer besides Pig or Trapper, anyone who says anything else is wrong by default.
---
No other perks give POST-GAME BP besides BBQ and WGLF, hence are absolutely worthless.
---
Yeah. Even if you‚Äôre not playing much, double BP weekend makes it easy. Spend 100k, then play until you hit the cap again, rinse and repeat.
---
‚ÄúPuts gun in mouth and shoots‚Äù
---
First time posting and don't know how to post to fan are hope you like it
---
They talked about him in a thing. Basically you'll be 'asleep' and he can hit you when he's nearby, you get glimpses of him at medium distance, and far away he's invisible unless you're asleep.
---
He also can't put people to sleep with his power anymore. Survivors just fall asleep randomly, and Freddy can't detect people in the dreamworld anymore. He just gets dream pallets/dream snares on people in the dreamworld.
---
Don't judge him, his vocabulary consists purely of "t" "your" and "garbage"
---
He's trying to communicate

It‚Äôs better than reading the same old recycled meme over and over. Guess it‚Äôs me age. Also. There‚Äôs plenty of other things that people talk about and to post about. Just wish there was a way to filter out the memes on mobile. Each to their own I guess
---
It's really buggy when it comes to that, bur you need to create an MLGA-folder in C-drive, I think it was in program files or the other one, just make one in both to be sure.
---
The Entitea?
---
I don‚Äôt reddit on desktop. Shame. Thanks anyways.
---
I like the enduring/spirit fury combo on Myers for that sick double hit. Don't gotta waste EW 3 to crack the shack anymore lol
---
To all Dev's you guys need to add a system where when you play survival with friends a killer is picked at random out of those people. For example: in Friday the 13th the game picks the killer at random out of all the players. This is needed because it is shity to keep on going kill your friends. This is just a idea and opinion that I think the game needs.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was doing for a while but then my Blood web started not having stuff I wanted so I just stopped and started playing just for cause I‚Äôll probably start doing it again but I was on swf and I already had all the perks I wanted on my David
---
If you're camping you won't rank up because they've specifically made the system to discourage camping.
---
As much as I love the Scream movie, a committed stalker who meticulously plans out when best to attack his victims, and can blend in as a regular person, is more terrifying than;
---
- A freudian nightmare with a lanky asshole as a sidekick
---
- A run of the mill lunatic attention whore and the aforementioned momma's boy's equally insane mother
---
- Roman
---
And 
---
- Attention seeking teenagers
---
Why not? They're there for a reason. If I don't have charge add-ons I don't really run any. Sometimes I'll do double engravings for the memes but that's really it
---
It just means survivors not taking the time to play the game and only focusing on ending the fame ASAP.
---
Also known as tryharding.
---
Yikes, pretty lofty assumptions you're making there about a person on the internet you don't know
---
Your art and postcards continue to be awesome! :D

Because they're ridiculously strong; it's as if you aren't playing Billy at that point.

What Killer do you play as?

*Just like in the simulations*
---
That inserted scream face looks like Hex: Third Seal's icon xD
---
Bringing rank reset and 2x bloodpoints together wasn't the brightest ideas. Killer queue times are so long I don't even want to play, as survivors you get matched with killers using their best perks and addons to kill everyone as fast as possible (had a pig with ebony mori hooking someone, camping near them with 0 TR, then just catch them again and mori).

I feel like I'm gonna sit this one out chief.
---
Becoming a psychopath through trauma still makes you a psychopath.

I don't know. Evil? No.

Lacking in any ethics, allowing him to commit morally reprehensible acts in the pursuit of knowledge? Yes.

Evil is subjective, anyway

*Sad oink*
---
Legion and Doctor, but they dont have any time to see what killer I am, its instanly when the game finish loading and I get to see my character.
---
&gt;I was not being serious but go ahead and take it that way
---
Well, at this point is hard to tell because way too many people suggest the same as you did, in a serious manner. 
---
My mistake, then.
---
Ok
---
Love that Roman gets no descriptor he‚Äôs just Roman the killer nobody wanted lol
---
you can't become a psychopath, you're born one i believe
---
You're thinking of sociopath.
---
i'm pretty sure it's the other way around, i would know
---
I think Scream 3 gets a bit too much hate, but Roman's motivations are needlessly complex
---
That is a fair point. When you get to higher ranks, though, add-ons are a necessity with almost any killer
---
if you think campers care if you hate them i think you'd be disappointed to hear they don't, also if it nets them a kill im sure they're happy
---
To people who post salty open letters on reddit, which we see about 24 times a day,
---
Why?
---
I don‚Äôt want to play a Game.
---
I'm always at red ranks, and I never use add-ons.
---
Uhhh, I don't think he's breathing..
---
what about him?
---
Assuming that the killer is going to farm with you is the ultimate self-mindgame
---
Well, a psychopath is defined as such: 
---
"a person suffering from chronic mental disorder with abnormal or violent social behavior."
---
As far as I can tell, there's no requirement for them being born with said disorder(s).
---
Why do people play as myers if his radius is 32?isnt that bad?
---
It even shows all 4 disconnected?
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Better than Myers who has no reason or Freddy who was a pedophile
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
I'm such a bad killer that I nod to survivors and then proceed to get looped for 3 gens by 1 survivor.
---
God, she blends in so well.
---
If you got suspended, that‚Äôs on you. Stop sending inappropriate messages to people if you don‚Äôt want to get suspended.
---
Being a red rank killer means my opinion matters :)
---
This is fucking amazing, seriously!
---
I'm not sure /: All I know is if you don't even get to start the match and are at results screen right after loading completes, it means someone or all of them disconnected. If you started the game, like, you managed to see what map you're on and then all of them disconnect, then it might be something else.
---
Guys this is totally fake. Everyone knows that DBD is a flawless game with no ‚Äúbugs‚Äù or ‚Äúglitches‚Äù. /s
---
This was terrible but what was worse would be when 2 traps were placed in the exact same spot. So you'd disarm one and assume you can go for the save but then you get snapped by the second trap.
---
why leader with sabo in the same build ?
---
Thnx man will give it a whirl
---
32M is the standard TR for most killers. But since T3 on Myers is only for a limited time it doesn't matter that much. T2 is the stage you will spend the most amount of time in, and his TR in T2 is 16M.
---
I was that Claudette
---
and not talking about the fact that doing gen instead is more useful for your team
---
What I mean is why during bloodpoint do you use these builds. I'm not one to get salty over a game I kinda want to just understand the motivation behind it. Is there an entertainment value to know others had a bad time or is it kind of a lash back to shitty survivors? I'm not trying to shit on you or flame I love this game to death and want to know the community more
---
It was ambiguous that he was a pedophile in the original, but he was 100% a child murderer.
---
Still unsympathetic
---
They will probably remove the killer instinct effect that the survivor who snaps you out of stealth gets but tbh I won't mind that
---
Well it's ptb so people probably haven't figured it out properly yet
---
If you had BBQ I reckon you wouldn‚Äôt care so much. Cause I certainly don‚Äôt but hey man at least you‚Äôre not a toxic playerüíØ

are you dumb enough to think that back then killers wasn't able to get their 2K on average ?
---
Slippery meat is actually good, especially with Up the Ante, change my mind

After that myers post today, my killer trust is on 0 lmfao
---
Happened to me on trapper a couple days ago
---
Just got the achievement yesterday, exclusively used no mither. It took forever but it definitely works, just don't forget to bring dead hard so you don't get battered üòÇ
---
Since I didnt play much last month im at rank 15 and if I even loop the killer for 1 pallet im getting facecamped but if i dont then i get farmed at hook. I player for 8 hours today and prob got around 500k points :(
---
‚ÄúOutplay‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ he tries to run away gets downed then ds. Maybe if you took the hit like a man then ds but no you fucked up and the perk saved you. Not outplay
---
If its my pc, what would you suggest? My pc is quite on the lower end, barely around the minimal requirements.
---
Nah if Myers can do it, then why shouldn't gf be able to
---
Just because they use a flash when you're breaking a pallet, or they're flashlight saving doesn't mean they're trying to frustrate you. When I do so, it's simply because it wastes time further and gives me an edge when I'm being chased, or gives my teammate another chance to waste time further.
---
Stop lying dead by daylight is usually in the top 20 most played on Xbox one plus the gane is on gamepass.i can tell people don't want to play with you because of your whining
---
They do get done too quickly , toolboxes and add ons make it too easy. Me and my friends playing survivor two of us brought in fully decked out tool boxes and perks to do gens faster and within a minute we had 3 gens done and a 4th about to be done while the killer chased the other two.
---
If not to a maximum of 100%, then 75%. 
---
It's annoying trying to hide in a locker while injured and you're like "SHH! DISAPPEAR FASTER, BLOOD!"
---
I am down for shortening the timer, but only if 1 other change also comes to pass: the timer doesn't go down in a chase. It feels like such a waste when you get unhooked with borrowed time and the killer tunnels you, you manage to loop him for a while and then you see your timer is about to run out and you're left with a choice: "do I let myself go down and use decisive or do I continue looping him in the hope I can keep him busy for another minute" it just feels stupid that the "anti tunneling perk" sometimes just straight up doesn't work when you're being tunneled simply because you're playing too well. Timer not going down while downed could also be a change I'd welcome.
---
I, too, am repulsed by the very concept of fun.
---
Alright, if add-ons make the game more fun to you, then that's you. I was honestly wondering why use them, as I usually find them boring, but to each their own.
---
Iron Will is already a good perk; it doesn't need a buff imo.  
---
They should buff/rework some other perks like Left Behind and No One Left Behind before even thinking of changing better perks.
---
Doing dull totems over the course of a game isn't that big of a deal, and the patch going live Tuesday will even reward you emblem points for it.
---
Yep! But people are mad because "iTs NoT rEaLlY gHoStFaCe, ItS jUsT tHe MaSk"
---
Iron Will makes you silent while injured, Calm Spirit really is just for those specific scenarios (doc, clown, infectious fright, getting hooked) and crows
---
Xbox goes on a level based ban system, first it‚Äôs a day ban, then a week, then 2 weeks and then a month and then a year then permaban. So obviously you‚Äôre s very toxic player to hit the month ban. If you think it‚Äôs not your fault then turn off messages from strangers, what‚Äôs the point having them on if it‚Äôs just going to make you lose your temper and get banned. If you can‚Äôt handle how you react to something then don‚Äôt put yourself in that situation till you can
---
What Myers post? Link it to me pls  I wanna see it aswell.
---
i swear to god or those teammates that are farming you right when the killer hooks you without BT so they can gain WGLF stacks and just try go protect you for 10 seconds and after that they don't give a shit anymore
---
I have and it reads more like Dexter then Scream.
---
Damn it why can't I find people who wanna farm?
---
Damn Desire Sensor applies to every game.
---
Pig can mindgame pallets and get early hits. She is worth of both places.
---
Thank you so much! I'm glad you like the art and the postcards. I can't wait to send this batch out--there's something special on the back that I haven't done before!

I can't even get put into a killer lobby here in New Zealand.... waited about 15 minutes twice and then went back to survivor, so I was at least getting some blood points at all.
---
r/DBDGoneGay
---
The Dexter comparison doesn't really work. Dexter was a forensics expert working with the police, for morally righteous reasons. 
---
DBD's Ghostface actually has more similarities to Scream than Dexter;
---
- Killing for selfish reasons (sadism)
---
- M.O of fucking with the victims
---
- Masquerades as a regular person during the day
---
- Same knife and mask
---
Silly ??? ... that‚Äôs his look. That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs known for.

Amanda Young= 11 letters

It would have taken TWO extra letters to just add her in there. Honestly it feels like he community loves Pig and everyone else hates her.

The problem is you already have to buy majority of the survivors/killers to get most of the perks. Using [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/5v73m7/from_1_to_50_how_many_bloodpoints/) as a reference it takes about 1.6m blood-points to get a character to level 50. Using a comfortable average from my survivor games I played today alone I got around 27k points a match with offerings but no WGLF . The average match is around 12-20 minutes, i will use 12 to give you the benefit of a doubt. 1.6m / 27k = 59, so 59 matches on average to get 1 character to level 50. 12 * 59 = 708 minutes of gameplay. 708 / 60 = 11, so 11hr to get 1 person to level 50 on average. now with 32 characters (33 including ghostface) that is 33 * 11 = 363 hours(352 without ghostface). Now this is at pretty much almost perfect efficiency. a more comfortable set of numbers for myself is 15k per match and average match around 15 minutes. 1.6m / 15k = 106, 106 * 15 = 1590 minutes (holy shit). thats 26 hours for 1 character. finally 26 * 33 = 858 hr's to get all characters. To fully unlock everything it should take around 363 to 858 hours of gameplay which is absurd since not all of us have infinite free time per day. One more quick thing i would like to add since I already wrote a paragraph and your not gonna read this most likely, I was originally planning on predigesting all characters to p3 but knowing that I would have to do that 3 times which equals 1089 - 2574 hours. All this without including leveling past 50 to get specific perks.
---
It‚Äôs a generalization the same he made about Xbox one players
---
From gg ez to gg ez ban. You definitely deserved it.
---
Where did he make a generalisation about Xbox One players?
---
Nah, at that point it's less to do with being tunnelled and more to do with the issues old DS had. If you're running them for a full minute timer, then you don't NEED an extra hit to draw out the match, gens should be getting done.
---
Gotta remember that there's 4 survivors and the game's balanced around people dying, not everyone being guaranteed a survival every time they feel like the killer did something they don't like. Chances are your plays have made it much more likely 3 other people will live.
---
Even if the killer were to camp anyway it's not illegal or anything,it's still something you can deal with by doing gens
---
They don‚Äôt punish killers enough for camping. I don‚Äôt think survivors should get anything for being camped but I do think killers should be penalized more.
---
Big point is i did not include matches that BPS where used since i rarely see them used. another bit of info is i played for 6 hours today and only saw 5 BPS used other then the 7 I used today.

---
This happened to me when I was playing Huntress but instead of pallets, the gens weren't visible. I could see the aura but not the gen itself.
---
Or you know..stop tunnelling. Because if you did not go for the healthy survivor, then 60 is long enough. Because t should normally take 60 or more to chase healthy one, run around a loop &amp; hook. Id even say the timer should be on hold during chases, to stop tunnelling.
---
imagine my confusion when this happened to me as survivor... but with generators üò£
---
Exactly. It should cause something similar to a survivor standing still for too long. They have crows flying around them. The killer's aura could be revealed and a bp reduction or something.
---
Git Gud? Lul. 
---
And don‚Äôt give me the entitled survivor main bullshit I play both roles ya fuckin mug.
---
how is this perfectly timed?
---
Ooooouuu that's a tough one. Probably Barbeque? Devour soap is also pretty amazing provided it survives. Depends on the killer and the build really. Monitor on old legion was God sent.
---
you do have to wait 7 seconds anyway as freddy
---
The problem with camping is it does nothing for either party, and it still happens. Its not going to stop, no matter what penalty you add. The only thing you can do to ‚Äúfix‚Äù any part of camping is make it so that survivors don‚Äôt get punished for playing well. The amount of times my first hook has been my final hook because i did some trivial thing like not drop a pallet or break out of dream state in front of Freddy is absolutely mindblowing. I should not get punished for playing well because the killer is butthurt i pallet-slammed him one too many times.
---
Another kid who doesn't want to take responsibility for their own actions.
---
As a killer it isnt a choice at all tbh. Do the survivors have 2k+ hours? Yes? Pudding.
---
Do they have &lt;1k? Yes? Streamers.
---
The results are the same for me not matter what but i want to support those who have a bit less playtime. This would probably be the same case if i would play survivor.
---
Grabbing food mid game
---
&gt; They don‚Äôt punish killers enough for camping. I don‚Äôt think survivors should get anything for being camped but I do think killers should be penalized more.
---
&gt; 
---
Killers camp because they **want to**, not because they need or because it is a "legit strategy". They are fully aware that against half decent survivors, they won't get anything by camping someone but that still doesn't stop them. Survivors also don't help the cause by hook bombing trying to save someone and then netting the killer an effortless 4k, do gens. 
---
You can punish them all you want, it won't stop them but, by meddling with game mechanics so much you will start to punish killers that aren't hardcore campers.
---
I mean, you said it yourself. Camping makes the game unfun and boring. Why should a survivor die on the hook while being face camped when they can DC and move on to the next match? 
---
When survivors DC for being camped or tunneled, I don‚Äôt blame them and I just try to get most outta the match with one less person on my team. The ‚Äúquitter bonus‚Äù just encourages this behavior. Yeah the emblems might not all be red because of the camping but if the survivor DCs, they still get bp from that bonus ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I had a match with against prayer bead mori spirit and wondered why 3 people dc'd lol.
---
Because it‚Äôs a team game not a game to be a selfish salty piece of shit duh. 
---
Yeah getting camped is unfun sure but it‚Äôs a strategy. The main problem is the survivors who DC and make there teammates deal with the problem instead of helping out and struggling to help there teammates escape or safety pip or pip. 
---
But nooo they are unhappy life gave them something shitty so they have to go on be a shitty asshole and have everyone else try not to derank or depip.
---
The reason why its done the current way is to dis-encourage camping, imagine how many people would camp if kills got them double bp
---
I remember getting banned by a nurse player, I said ‚Äúgood game you overpowered bitch‚Äù got a week com ban from that, but I got it appealed as I was complementing the player.
---
They wont do anything to change it, its a mechanical thing, the grind is a basic but somewhat effective way to keep people invested into the game itself by shackling content behind a playtime thing, its the reason why everything revolves around the blood web, why reworks are often times just stronger addons and why perks are such a rng thing.
---
That‚Äôs no homophobic at all, enjoy another downvote.
---
Hitboxes have been all kinds of screwed up forever., but I agree. Huntress has it the worst, her hatchets do whatever they feel like lol
---
adc? Is this a reference to LoL or am I a dumbfuck?
---
Your missing the point. The entire world knows this mask because of Scream. There is already a backstory and lore to the ‚ÄúCharacter‚Äù. Film 101.
---
You can‚Äôt change definitions to suit your arguments. That‚Äôs not how it works here. Fucking concept. Christ. 
---
We expected the full costume, The Woodsboro Murders. Not this. It might as well be their own design because nothing about it resembles why people wanted it to begin with.
---
But that‚Äôs the thing though there‚Äôs never ever a SET ghostface in any of the movies or even the TV show, he changed every time. Hell even in the first movie it was two people. Plus, the mask is really the only iconic part of the outfit, who gives a damn what black robes he‚Äôs wearing idky people get so fussed about it üòÇ
---
I can understand what you mean, but I think it'd be a change that would benefit every non-tunneling killer. Doesn't really matter to me. I don't have a problem with the current version of DS, was just saying that if the timer would be reduced, it should also be paused during a change.
---
I use No Mither and with the current DS, I can just suicide to get an unhook because I still have decisive strike from 45 seconds ago and since I have No Mither, the killer won't slug me.
---
Shouldn't cause DC's unless you timed out so your probably fine. It's most likely your internet, router, or antivirus if its on your end. I recommend making a ticket since they can probably diagnose it better then I can over messages. If your having problems on survivor as well or BHVR cant help PM me, ill be glad to use my CS background to help as much as i can

Good luck from now on, and may your bloodpoints be valid and plentiful

You can‚Äôt complain about being suspended when you‚Äôre the one who initiated conversation. If survivors crouching up &amp; down really pisses you off that much, then you should probably find another game to play.
---
I have a solution to your problem and why they might camp like I do. Just mentioning that I'm also not proud of it. I camp because I want more people to report me and make the devs see that this shouldn't be a thing. Like imagine getting camped all the time in lower ranks, that would be so frustrating that they wouldn't continue playing this game and that's the point, if they stop playing the game cuz of camping the devs lose more money and if they lose more money because of that reason then they'd have to fix this problem.
---
1. When he stalks, he can't attack and moves slowly. You can use this time to loop, gain distance or break line of sight.
---
2. Plague can use two emetic add-ons, walk up to you and vomit on you to break you in 5 seconds. Then she can one-shot you. This isn't that different to GF chase-stalking.

Half the survivors are too dumb to realize when it's a farm game when I'm literally in the top of the hill just swining my chainsaw. So sad

Uh oh. What have I done officer?

Wait for No stupid questions Tuesday and give this community a chance, not all of us are assholes &lt;3

Yeah, this would have been better suited for a table or something like that than a tier list, but I get your idea. Maybe of you put every tier in the same color it looks closer to what you have in mind.
---
I don‚Äôt get them like ever. Like I‚Äôll rarely get BPS or escape cakes. Same goes for needles actually too. I‚Äôve leveled up a Dwight all the way through fifty levels of a prestige now and I didn‚Äôt see a single needle.

I only use BE or BPS if someone says they are or im feeling jazzy, Escape Cakes for any other time

---
People who are complaining about ghostface being overpowed are so fucked in the head. You have myers which is the exact same as ghostface ability wise and yet he isn‚Äôt overpowered. You have hillbilly than can 1 hit and zoom across the map and nurse that can completely negate loops if the player is good. Shut the fuck up with this ghostface is overpowered shit.
---
Then play at an optimal time instead of rushing in playtime right before you have to go to school or work. It‚Äôs not hard to do. 
---
Also it‚Äôs not bad behavior to camp it‚Äôs a fucking strategy. Sure it feels rude against survivors but it‚Äôs still a damn strategy.
---
My apologies not Xbox players, people with that pfp

No, he didn't. Go check that comment again.

I've noticed that too, hell my first post on reddit is someone with that profile pic sending me a voice message saying  "Nice cheat fucking ni**er, hope you like getting ddossed, reset and banned fucking pussy" on r6.

I'll absolutely check that out if you decide to do it

&gt; Open the menu that displays all of the subreddits you're subscribed to. Next to where it says "all", tap the filter button. Hit the + in the upper right. Type in the flair you wanna filter out (in this instance it's Shitpost), in the Subreddit menu, tap it and select "deadbydaylight" obviously, and set Filter type to flair, and bam, you now filter out posts with the Shitpost flair in /r/deadbydaylight

I don't think that we will make the subreddit rules stricter again given the fact that the majority of the subreddit community enjoys memes, but I get that the users who don't like memes need a "place to go" as well. Maybe a second discussion-based subreddit would be a suitable solution in this case? Let us know :)
---
Cheers, here are the categories I have so far:
---
Map Pressure
---
Mobility
---
Chase Power
---
Game Slowing
---
Add-ons (how helpful they are to the power)
---
Perk Dependency (do they depend on certain perks)
---
Perk Power (do certain perks give them a massive edge)
---
If you could suggest any others that would be great.
---
Now I'm pretty busy but I'll check that out as soon as I can.  So far sounds good.
---
Standing by this logic,what does the mori actually do?...
---
Thanks
---
Spirit but then Billy but it all depends on opinions.
---
Sorry for the noob question but what is "tunneling " I see alot of people who hate it
---
it really is a legit song!! i thought it was a meme ngl
---
That‚Äôs actually really cool! I have the devil may cry one as my go to for him, which is kinda boring. An orange jumpsuit alone just sounds badass!
---
Ormond rework looking good
---
This has nothing to do with entitlement...it just makes the game unfun and toxic
---
Spirit with add ons, Billy without add ons
---
Funny is that I camped and tunnel‚Äôd one match against a Clown when there were multiple Streamers
---
Ok I respecc that

me when a killer/survivor sends me a message with any profanity after a bad game even if its a joke
---
&gt;if these killers are new or just enjoy trolling people. 
---
He was P3... don't think he's all that new
---
I love when killers try and defend noed by telling you to do totems. If the killer is at all competent you can‚Äôt do all the totems and the gens. You just can‚Äôt.
---
Tru3 is irrelevant
---
This Bloodhunt makes me wish i owned it lol
---
AND THAT HE'S MUH SHERIFF
---
I'm really pleased with what they did with the perk
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnDCHHnz09I)
---
I think you meant Claudettes lol. The urban sprint burst combo is great for the immersed. Aka the Clauds
---
Okay, but when do they release the rift and archives? It says new rift and archives but not when they release it?.
---
F,I hope that you'll get another party streamer back from the bloodweb soon
---
Then don‚Äôt use School or work as an excuse to Dc unless you‚Äôre rushing playtime which then I stand behind what I just said.
---
I was simply putting up something that people always say but there‚Äôs always context to something. Because everyone always say oh will you jump off a bridge because your friend said so, answer is easily no since you know it‚Äôs most likely your death. But answering yes to other things they may ask you is a different result. 
---
The reason why I attacked you is because of your stupidity. Also you may not have much time sure but do you know if the others have much time either? They‚Äôre most likely trying to rank up as well but through Dcing you create a bad domino effect that hurts everyone through a selfish manor. 
---
Also back to context nothing is as simple as everyone thinks it is. Because there needs to be context to  everything.
---
Same! I only started using it after the rework since it now seems a lot more fair. Though it sucks when you go down when ds is still active but the killer picks you up right as it ends xd
---
He is pretending to be a tree
---
That's a kick-ass tattoo
---
Really recommend it! I didn't realize how much I used to go down so soon after being unhooked, until I got the perk. Too bad I still suck at the skillcheck
---
how dare you use facts and logic you crude animal. reported to the survivor main police enjoy your ban kid.
---
Oh ok thx
---
40
---
No, but you will get him to around high level 30 into low level 40s. 
---
 
---
Also if you save daily quests you will get more then 1 mil bp to put into Ghostface.
---
lmfao tbh I am probably going to suck at the skill checks as well based on how good i am with ruin lol
---
*laughs in DARN*
---
Begone TOTH
---
It doesnt need a buff.

Whispers, Borrowed Time

She was watching out for noob 3 and cleansing. She was actually smart because it was a pig and you know what they say 
---
Pig = N O E D 
---
/s
---
Reminds me of getting facecamped by a Leatherface, the match ends and all my team is calling him toxic. His reply, "It's not against the rules".
---
Meanwhile, I get salt from a Hillbilly who called me a slut after adrenaline kicked in and I reopened the hatch with a key in front of him after he closed it. 
---
The wonders of this game.
---
Skooks is not an escape.
---
Anyone else experience other weird glitches? My husband had the infamous "t-pose" glitch the other night and had to carry a survivor the whole match. 
---
He couldn't drop them or hook them and they couldn't wiggle out.
---
Right after that one he experienced a glitch and he couldn't hit anyone at all.
---
I haven‚Äôt played survivor since before the rank reset. So I think I‚Äôm sat at 16 atm.  But it‚Äôs almost every game. Surprising to see campers in even the green ranks
---
It worked, you died.
---
I run that on my huntress, I haven‚Äôt unlocked her teachables yet. Only LF‚Äôs atm.
---
Goodnight sweet prince ü§ß
---
Ah good idea. I‚Äôve been unintentionally saving up Daily Rituals because they‚Äôve all been shite. Cba to use Nurse or Hag.
---
How'd he do that?
---
Or when they get hit, the healing resets.
---
The compromise is agreeable. Mainly because I don‚Äôt run DS and I‚Äôve only fooled around with head on a little, so it‚Äôll be interesting to see how it all turns out.
---
No one escapes death. Not even in real life
---
Nothing wrong with playing the game normally, farming is boring.
---
NOED?
---
Add ons.   It‚Äôs just stuff like a scope for the across map snipes.  Dead by daylight will be the next game to do 360 quick scopes.
---
The face reminds me of Gale Wind from One Punch Man lol
---
I think he was being sarcastic at least I hope he was lol.
---
I do think it should deactivate if you down and hook someone else. It's supposed to counter tunneling, but now you have people who run in, get downed, you pick them up, they DS and save the dude. It does not feel like this was how it was intended to be used
---
It's when a killer goes after one survivor and ignores the others under all circumstances.
---
Legion will be (after Freddy rework) the least viable killer in the game
---
Source:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGSLe9partQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGSLe9partQ)
---
A what
---
Yeah, and it even requires more effort to pop it since you have to first activate your power and THEN stalk them, and then you also have to hope nobody else is looking at you.
---
So is your English dude.
---
Why would you want ALL the teachables though?
---
Spirit can be the hardest of the three to play, but if you know how to play her, she's arguably stronger than both with certain add-ons, just because it's more a gamble where you juke her or not, than actual skill, and when you take away players making the decision of avoiding the killer, and put it in the hands of the killer whether or not the survivors get hit, people will usually go down really fast. Doesn't help that her only counter is iron will, which is pretty useless against nearly every other killer
---
Disgusting, yet beautiful.
---
Shhhhh! Don‚Äôt tell them our secrets
---
what did the comment say lol
---
Maybe an envelope if someone else is feeling generous
---
People do it whether there's an event or not. They just have more of an incentive to, now, because they want to ruin the game for someone as much as possible
---
Devour hope, when it‚Äôs still up
---
Your definition of a normal game is tunneling and camping? Damn son
---
I haven't seen anyone complaining. Is there some secret salty survivor subreddit I wasn't invited to?
---
~~I don't hate the buff plz don't kill me.~~
---
It's a genuine question though, like where are all the complaints? Most people seem hyped for it.
---
dude only 90k? im getting nearly 200k average per game with 3 streamers
---
This is what happens a lot when Freddy is ingame. If people here freddys sound they insta-leave. This is mostly because freddy is no fun to play against. You cant do any tactics, you only can pray and run. And then its said its the weakest killer, yep in chase probably, but for a survivor to win against him its a nightmare. So yeah, of youre playing for your rank it may be ok, but I rarely see people escaping when freddy is the killer
---
Probably something along the lines of 'Waaa, this isn't lore friendly and is stupid and I hate memes waaa'
---
Yeah, now he can't loop for shit and has no way to deal with loops. That's sure to make him balanced and not somehow actually worse than Freddy!
---
Nah I‚Äôm not going to do that. I‚Äôm saving shards for Myers and Ruin (When it hits the shrine again. Was away last time it was up there)
---
When the survivor uses Dead Hard to gain distance and makes it to a pallet, making the chase last much longer than it should have.  
---
Fuck.
---
Imagine nurse at 110%. *Shudders*
---
More true for survivors tbh. But then again I have played against killers who have called me toxic for looping
---
This is the whiniest post I've ever seen complaining about others whining. If you're so vehemently reliant on broken perks, then maybe you just need to git gud instead of bitching about broken perks no longer being broken. DS, if anything, is now just a well designed perk
---
You can probably use your stealth during chase, it removes your red stain afaik. So you can mind-game a lot easier, along with crouching at full movespeed behind obstacles. 
---
It also points you towards survivors that knock you out of it, so it's good for tracking even if it's just a bit.
---
you get plenty of time so it doesnt really matter if you still have Shrouded Hunt
---
This is perfect.
---
Pretty sure if this would be in the game, they would censor and remove it after a outrage on Twitter...   - _-
---
I'm on Xbox and takes 5 mins to find a match as a killer. I'm in EU and rank 8.
---
Survivors are overpowered because gen times. In a 1v1 it's obvious who is the stronger role (except for a few broken tiles). Killers like the one in the above video think they are so cool because they managed to down someone. Ironically he is entitled to his kill because he clearly beat someone on a 1v1 right? Not being able to pressure the whole team is a problem, so is putting all your pressure on one player.
---
I wonder if they are the ones complaining that one mistake as a killer can cost you the match while thinking making a mistake as a survivor should guarantee you die.
---
I wouldn't say spirit is a handicap killer. She's strong, sure, but she requires you to play well, and is a hard killer to play, and harder still to master. You could say the same for nurse to a certain degree.
---
I don't think either are handicap killers, because if you go against a full group of competent SWF with shit like borrowed time, mettle of man, adrenaline and unbreakable, if you play any other killer, billy included, chances are you'll get steamrolled, just because there's no way to apply pressure without downing everyone nearly instantly
---
Oh I understand doing it as a save or to waste time occasionally but I'm talking about the people who used to DC to save their item if they were about to die. The ones who flashlight save EVERY person. The one who uses it so often and loops so hard that you can feel the sweat radiating off them. The ones who if they escape will tbag the exit gate and flame in post-game chat. Toxic survivor mains are who I mean, not flasight users in general
---
im not really sure why they would do a rank reset like same day as double bp but its annoying because it brings out terrible survivors/killers running annoying to play vs set ups every game that you have to solo the game every game even more than normal or die
---
Alll killers have a 32 metre radius, that‚Äôs standard. Except Michael starts with an 8 metre in Level One, 16 in Level Two, 32 in Level Three. Hag and Huntress have 24 or 28 (I think). All others have 32 by default, unless you run Monitor &amp; Abuse
---
Controller died
---
true true, but bhvr will never hear players praying for BP increase
---
*a long wall T pallet jungle gym*
---
Lol, there‚Äôs nothing toxic about asking why are you reposting crap that wasn‚Äôt interesting the first time.
---
Hopefully you and all of the other killer mains keep that same energy for when the dev team nerfs him. But from what happened in the past I'm assuming survivor mains are going to be called crybabies, delusional, dumbasses, and other things for ever daring to express an opinion in a videogame and having the devs listen.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but those killers were not playing well. When you‚Äôre camping you have 100% of the power because of the existence of the grab mid-unhooking. Just be careful to not get faked out by them faking an unhook. At worst you will get a 1 for 1 so nothing really changed except they have more time to do gens but I assume no one cares about gens if they are camping.
---
SWF is a whole different thing, though. Against killers who can‚Äôt instadown it‚Äôs possible to get an unhook against a camper without any downs but it‚Äôs still very difficult if the killer is good.
---
Insta-downs are really powerful tools, usually locked behind a timer(With the exception of noed, but noed is just a poorly designed perk, intended for an era long since gone). I find that an exposed status should only be strong if you're good at ending chases, rather than have a huge success margin based on numbers alone
---
With that said, I do want him to compete with the killers we currently have, I just also want him to be a killer which is fantastic when utilizing his tools correctly, and more eh-ish if you just picked him up
---
holler‚Äôs best friend, the crapper
---
How was he not?
---
oh yea deffs but its just a meme
---
Legion was a product of dev laziness, most survivors were bitching sure, but they(legion) sat on a game breaking bug for 5 full months when they could have disabled the add-ons that caused it easily. They've done it in the past, and all disabled offerings are still visible if you bought them pre-disabling, so there is proof they are capable of doing so. Most survivors deserve to be banned for dcing if it had been specifically Legion, but they did have a lot of problems.
---
It's not the survivors fault the devs nuked them to make up for their own mistakes.
---
15 secs + timer stops when in chase.. sounds good imo
---
Well that‚Äôs kind of a mean toxic thing to say.
---
"You look like a melting ice cream"
---
Does doctor's madness even drain? I've looked at the madness bar, and once you reach T2, it just locks down wherever it finishes. Unless it has a long delay before it starts depleting, anyways
---
*It's a legion strategy, bro*
---
*\*canned laughter\**
---
Not really seekign out farming as killer because it's pretty easy hit ~25k with killer anyway, even with a loss. I've farmed a couple fo times when people DCed and a couple more when messaged pre-game. Haven't had a single farming game as surv just normal.
---
Me: Runs object of obsession
---
Nurses: *Wheeze*
---
It‚Äôs the right thing to do! Had two matches go like this today.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
If you can play spirit really well she‚Äôs probably stronger, but hillbilly has his chainsaw that he can get quick downs with. So basically it all depends on how good you are with the killer
---
It's the last thing most survivors expect on Myers so it's a great surprise
---
I'm playing on PS4 right now ranked 8 as Killer, my wait times are two to 5 min.
---
I think he meant in the sense that, similarly to how pig and wraith are M1 killers, you can utilize the tools more effectively than just pressing M1. M1 is more the idea that the way you play is barebones
---
Killers like this are the same people who post Salt/Rant posts about being gen rushed and not getting a 4K every game. Sure, it‚Äôs a strategy... But it‚Äôs a strategy that honestly shouldn‚Äôt let you advance past rank 15.
---
I think you have the right idea. Besides Prayer Beads, her Ribbon &amp; Brooch are great, especially during chases. Her phasing movement speed add ons are also pretty good. My personal favorite combo is Prayer Beads &amp; the Brooch.
---
Same. But I‚Äôm rank 15 killer and sometimes they don‚Äôt get the hint so I have to kill them :(
---
Unless they bring BPS, I‚Äôll only hook twice and let them escape even if they don‚Äôt farm directly
---
Would you get that on you permanently?
---
TUCK HIM IN üò°
---
I'm playing on PS4 right now ranked 8 as Killer, my wait times are 2 to 5 min. Maybe it's a rank location problem.
---
DeDiCateD SErveRs WiLl fIx HiTBoxeS üôÉ
---
Then you should go for Adam, Jeff and Jane. 
---
Their perks aren't meta, but can still be useful in specific builds and specific situations. From Adam you should go for Deliverance, from Jeff you should go for Distortion and for Jane you should go for Head On.
---
I'm playing on PS4 right now ranked 8 as Killer, my wait times are 2 to 5 min. Maybe it's a rank or location problem.
---
Only if you down them within 40-60 seconds after they unhooked. Sure it is harder to avoid in some situations, but you can avoid DS most of the time.
---
He‚Äôs probably just an asshole with no friends, so he takes it out on strangers who are just trying to enjoy a game. lol
---
I play on console and main Spirit. She is loads of fun to play as.
---
Don't think her not being able to be stunned is a bug, since it's been in the game forever, similarly to when she recovers from the stun, you can't stun her. It's probably more a case that you cannot have two forms of character interactions on you at once(Teleporting and being stunned, being wheeze-stunned and being stunned). It's just that nurse is unique in this way, meaning you don't see it anywhere else
---
How about you reply next time
---
With a lot of steam games this is a common issue with resolution or the game trying to launch at settings that are incompatible with your PC. Try checking the game‚Äôs launch settings and your pc settings and see if you can turn down any of the game settings (launch in window vs full screen often helps me) or change PC settings to a different resolution.
---
Looks like OP is a bot that just posts shirts. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/apmszr/finally_got_around_to_making_a_dbd_shirt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) is the original post if anyone is interested.
---
He kinda quirky doe
---
The only time survivors run streamers always seems to be when I decide to run an ebony and then I spend the entire game hoping that I don‚Äôt mori the person who burned the offering. I‚Äôm probably like 1/32 in terms of not killing the person who ran them.......
---
When I get outplayed because of the killer skill I'm alright with that. When Killer gets me because his NOED kicked in I think it's bullshit.
---
Bloodhunt active, everyone is playing killer
---
There are no servers for games yet, only local hosting
---
gosh, bet you're that kind of player that plays Hag putting 5 traps around the hooked person and still camps them saying that she was made to camp ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Go read the perk
---
What do these apart from delivarance do
---
AHHHH THANK YOU SO MUCH. I‚Äôm definitely going to buy this soon. (Also sorry for the late reply, oof)
---
Exactly, took the bait. gg ez.
---
Probably gonna get downvoted but, this is the reason I'm tryharding every game. I tried to farm as killer in a bp event once one day and got the usual swf team. After the match I swore to never farm again
---
dude why is the corn so sharp.
---
Evan you evil slut release me from this mine at once.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Nice
---
Damn now I want Dexter in DBD
---
got i hope it will make my teammates do the totems now so i dont have to solo 4-5 of them
---
Tuck the baby dweeet
---
Would be nice if we could actually change camera angle in the menu.
---
No hag was made to use traps to catch the survivor unaware, Myers was designed to either hunt down one survivor first then kill the others, or leave the obsession for last. I was running dying light, so therefore, tunnel obsession first
---
Legion and Plague are first hit. Pig and wraith are freddy tier in the chase
---
I mean, I can also add borrowed time. It was long time ago but it was a build for myself for others and rescuing part as well.
---
SuRvIvOrS ArE tO Op
---
It's still PVP so you're being matched with available players in your region. It could be no one is playing right now.
---
Well many of them are based on real people. The clown is John Wayne Gacy, bubba is Ed Gein etc
---
Distortion : You start the Trial with 3 Tokens. When your Aura would be shown to the Killer, the perk activates and a Token is consumed. For the next 6/8/10 seconds while the Perk is activated, your Aura and Scratch Marks will not be shown to the Killer. Distortion does not activate when you are in the Dying State or affected by Traps. 
---
So Distortion is a counter for Barbecue and Chilli, A Nurse's Calling and other aura reading perks and add-ons.
---
Head On : While standing in a Locker for 3 seconds Head On activates. While Head On is activated, performing a rushed action to leave a Locker stuns the Killer for 3 seconds if they are standing within range. Causes the Exhausted Status Effect for 60/50/40 seconds. Head On can't be used while Exhausted.
---
It has very good sinergy with Quick and Quiet and it's useful for basement saves.
---
Why would myers have such a trash radius. So I'm levelling him up only to gain a standard radius? Shouldn't the highest tier aka lvl 3.. Be the lowest radius lol. I'm basically grinding for 32m. Or is tier 1 the highest
---
Yoooooo I'm from your discord I'm shega
---
NO I get it‚Äôs 2019 but this is too far
---
This has happened to me!!üòµ
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
Too bad it probably won't make my amazing immersed teammates do gens while the killer is getting looped for 5 minutes though.
---
There are so many great skins, they could make a fan case with a bunch of them \^\^
---
Glad to hear that, thank you!
---
Yeah it's a blessing against teammates who shamelessly farm you in front of the killer.
---
I sure love losing to map like the Game that rolled 20 save pallets and to 3 survivors with Mettle of Man. Outskilled.
---
One time I went to heal a teammate in the corner and just started t posing while they were cowering down to the almighty dwight Fairfield
---
Ye go for the easy ones I guess
---
the crapper's twice removed cousin, ***bigg scarey***
---
You mean blendettes? xD
---
I absolutely hate being flashlights when picking up a survivor or at a pallet. I don't think it's toxic though. Just like running around a jungle gym it's a strategy. IRL if I was being chased, I'd do the same thing. IMO there is no toxic strategies in this game, except those that are used outside what the devs allow. Annoying=\=toxic. What is toxic are the people who after a match, talk down to you, make you feel like crap cause you are not as good as them. When I run into them, I report and move on, or agree with them in a nicer way so they don't get the satisfaction. Like if someone says I suck, I'll say, yeah I did bad that match, I need to get better. I'm fairly new.
---
Way too much for me.
---
I read your comment, but I disagree with you.
---
Also, stop tunneling.
---
Yes, same as me! ‚ù§ Thank you :)
---
If you actually bothered to read what I had to say, you'll notice that I only wanted to reduce it by 15 seconds.
---
Spirit. If a survivor is at least decent, they can force Billy to become a M1 killer
---
Don't listen to that guy, he's too far gone.
---
this meme doesn't make sense to me
---
So you play rank 20 on killer and survivor, cool. No honestly it's trash if you have half the required chromosomes for a measurable iq. And a bit of experience in this game of course.
---
Yes because you can still loop and see him.
---
Very rare perk- Dragonslayer: When you are injured and within 12m of the killer, use the action button to swing at the killer with dragonslayer. A succesful hit causes *decapitation* upon the killer, instantly ending the trial.
---
Hey, that's my post :D
---
gud meme
---
If survivors are actively trying to get my attention I ignore them and go for the ones trying to hide.  
---
Anyone who wants your attention is likely to abuse every strong loop they can, and be incredibly toxic as they waste your time.  
---
But if you ignore them, they get desperate and make mistakes, so after dealing with the people that don't want to loop you for 4 gens, it gets pretty easy to take out that noise making prick.
---
Idk why you getting downvoted, I have plenty of people suiciding on first hooks, dcing to denying bbq stack and so one, most of my games are 1v2 So I just farm a bit then go afk to let em finnish up.
---
I've never seen this either, they should make that more detailed and easy to see to help make navigating lerys easier (especially for new players)
---
This was me last game after looping the trapper for 4 gens. And then I died on first hook because my team got caught in random traps.
---
Stop focusing on the Dwight! Focus on the fact one of the other survivors just Kobe‚Äôd! Are you just going to let that slide.
---
"Budge up"
---
That's why i said as long as the survivor timed it correctly.
---
Maybe don't stand in front of him then?
---
You said 15-30 seconds
---
* Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Mettle of Man
---
* you play vs a 3 perk killer until gates open
---
* can be countered by clearing totems
---
Just a few things that come to mind.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and my killer queues only take one minute. I‚Äôd expect my survivor queues to finally be better during this event but they still take like 3 minutes
---
And you're desperate to stay on my ass for no apparent reason.
---
We didn't even teabag or anything, we just did the essential looping, jukes, and then a bodyblock at the end to save poor Dwighty on the hook. And yes, the lag did skyrocket at the end; we were basically doing our best impressions of The Nurse's ability at the exit gate.
---
Unfortunately every queue I've had today has taken about 10-20 minutes... I switched over to survivor and they're shorter queues but all the killers I play against are running mori's and builds to stop us getting bloodpoints :(
---
Lery‚Äôs is quite small, going from one side to another doesn‚Äôt take more the 20-30 seconds
---
The fuck, well my last one was rank 7 to rank 10
---
i always forget you can see the outside of lerys
---
I agree tea bagging is toxic and unnecessary. My point was running an infinite isn‚Äôt toxic, it‚Äôs a try hard tactic, sure but it‚Äôs not toxic.
---
Yeah, see. That's the problem. The easiest strategy for killing survivors is also the scummiest. So scummy playstyle is also rewarded, while also taking next to no skill to pull off. This is why this strategy shouldn't be rewarded with the same amount of points. If someone wants to play that way, fine, but you won't get as many points out of it.
---
Playing fair takes much more skill and, thus, should be worth more for the killer.
---
This is great, I especially love the bag.
---
Take territorial, you could use in on every basement build (trappy boy for most fun)
---
Yep 90% of games.
---
Lobby ping: 60
---
In game ping: 600
---
I was Wraith in the situation above xd
---
It‚Äôs fantastic, because it does what it‚Äôs supposed to, it punishes the killer for an unfunny playstyle. Before it was just a get out of jail free card
---
Welcome to killer scoring system.
---
Better to have a balanced game than a game that's broken by voice comms. :)
---
then be smarter and cleanse totems?
---
All killers expect Nurse and maybe Spirit have to camp and tunnel to be able to do well in games at high ranks, survs aren't entitled to anything if we see a weak survivor unhooked and a healthy surv, its obviously better to tunnel and go for the weaker prey
---
Don't worry, the paper plate attatched to Frank's face is just an april fool's joke from BHVR.
---
Its going to get updated and we'll get to see his real mask, right BHVR? 
---
Right?!
---
Camping a hook I dont agree with though, its a lose lose situation if you camp
---
She's uh... urban.
---
Weird, almost never happens to me.
---
It does cut both ways, though. Instasaw Billy with an ebony mori on a corn map doesn‚Äôt feel like a particularly fair match up either, but that‚Äôs how this game goes. If the other side brings their strongest shit, you‚Äôll struggle.
---
I mean 3 of those 4 perks are good. I don‚Äôt agree with play with your food though.
---
Not surprising when you see NOED in their loadout lol.
---
Not sure where you're located, I'm in Eastern europe, so plenty of my matches are on the russian side, but this one wasn't even russian. High ping matches are the norm around here, usually every 4-5 match is an acceptable one, and sometimes even those turn into lagfests intentionally or not.
---
True, i guess it just happends to me more frequently as killer.
---
I prefer the new DS over the old one. Still very useful but you don‚Äòt have to feel like a dick
---
Not being mean. Just stating fact. Juking a Nurse on console is stupid easy. Everytime she blinks there is an fps drop.
---
Wow, that *is* unpopular
---
You wouldn't enjoy being stepped on by daddy myers?
---
far from perfect.
---
32m terror radius is standard for killers. That's not the point of tier 3. The main benefit of tier 3 is that all survivors become Exposed (i.e, everyone goes down in one hit). The 32m terror radius is a drawback, compared to his sneakier earlier forms. . 
---
tier1:8 m terror radius, no Red Stain, immune to detections perks (i.e, premonition and Spine Chill won't help), but moves slowly and has a nonexistent lunge
---
tier 2: 16m terror radius, otherwise standard killer attributes
---
tier 3: 32 m terror radius, all survivors are exposed, vaults windows much faster, lunge is significantly longer.   
---
All Stalking does is let you move up tiers. Basically, as you go on, you become less stealthy, but more of a direct threat. A tier1 meyes is very easy to sneak up on people, but will get looped for days. A tier 2 meyers can catch people by surprise, but doesn't have anything exceptional to help is a chase. A tier 3 meyers is as obvious as every other killer, in exchange for direct confrontation being nigh-suicidal.   
---
This is all quiete different from the Ghostface method of stalking things, which is much simpler: stare at a survivor for a little bit, they become exposed for a decent bit. They're only similar in how they can stare down a survivor for some benefit.
---
Didn't they say Summer 2019?
---
Bloodwarden.
---
I like to message them back, periodically, to update them on my enjoyment of not having a ban.
---
ITs a nerf. Reduction on pallet stun is barely noticible.
---
Ohhh the killer d/ced. I was thrown off because survivors have the d/c icon but I guess killer doesn't?
---
I don‚Äôt tunnel and camp and I do fine
---
Bruh I am legitimately going to waste most of my money just for topless Jake skin
---
15-30 seconds shorter would make the timer 30-45 seconds. Dunno where you pulled 10 seconds from.
---
You know, when search is 20 minutes and gens are rushed in 3 minutes.
---
I was talking about DS tier 1 :(
---
Your one person, most need to tunnel and play dirty to secure kills and pip, just because you play fine doesnt mean the majority do
---
So what the point of dream world?
---
If 30 seconds got removed, it would last 10 seconds and the killer wouldn't even be able to pick you up and it would be already gone
---
*Generators are now removed dus to complaints from killers
---
Haddonfield is atrocious, you don't even need to use pallets if RNG is in your favour...
---
who the hell respects pallets to begin with?!
---
Nah, the paint brush reduces your movement speed, and in return you put survivors into the dream world faster and reduces your terror radius.
---
*laughs in bamboozle*
---
I honestly believe BHVR is not fixing that shit on purpose just to give random players aneurysms.
---
It's really not that hard to make it so if the killer is within X meters of a hooker survivor and/or frequently looks at said hooked survivor, the sacrifice process is paused.
---
If the killer leaves and comes back, the sacrifice process starts and pauses again.
---
It's not that hard.
---
Facecamping is unfun and an absolute waste of time for whoever is hooked.  The fact they still haven't done shit about that show how much they care.
---
I... I have many thoughts, but no words to express them.
---
Bro, this is awesome! I could defiently see this a skin in the game
---
Thankssss. This helps
---
Please let them be the mater ones he only wears the mater ones
---
I wish I could send images through the Xbox chat because I would use this format to respond to any and all salt
---
I feel like their pretty good at chasing down and locating survivors tho
---
If you get lucky with the bloodweb Spawning RNG and buy really cheap things you could probably get ghostface  to the mid to high 40s but that's about it
---
Still think that they should nerf it from 60 secs to 40 or 30
---
Since when has this ever been an unpopular opinion
---
I honestly feel like there are some things you just shouldn't bring in a civilized game. Ebony Mori being one of them. Fucking Iridescent Head being another. But this goes for survivors as well, there's a special place in hell for SWF groups that bring god flashlights to a rank 15 game.
---
I can feel that satisfaction
---
**Big Scarey**'s old roommate, *Aaaaaa Boo*
---
This would work better with the scroll of thruth template.
---
Noed?
---
The numbers are fine, though, aren't they?
---
I always thought the bigger issue was that you need four players picking survivor for every one player who picks killer. And killer is far more dynamic an experience, so it retains players for longer.
---
They mean after the rework
---
Since this post is about DS, can I get a clarification on the "Succeeding or failing the Skill Check will disable Decisive Strike." part of the perk description. Does this mean that Decisive Strike will be disabled for the rest of the game if you attempt to do it or it's just disabled until you unhook someone again?
---
I also had a dream about the Nurse, but mine was different.
---
OwO
---
..and? I've played this game for a long time and while I started off as a ''nice'' killer I quickly learned that survivors do not ever care about whether the killer has fun or not, feels weird that some people expect killers to go out of their way to be a birthday party host and provide entertainment for 4 online strangers who are highly unlikely to return the favor.
---
If they missed a skill check healing they'll probably miss their DS idk why ppl can't just agree that the perks is fine exactly where it is only changes I can think of to make would be to stop/slow the timer when being chased/slugged. That way the only counter to it is to just fuckin chase someone else and stop fuckin tunnelling game after game. I've messaged killers who tunneled asking why the hate (because I assume when they tunnel, it's because they hate you and want you dead) and I've had too many people say that it's just how they play. They don't chase, they just camp the hook and either tunnel right off the hook or hook trade someone else in (usually only if BT is involved or the unhooked is already slugged and DoH
---
Playing fair would consist of survivors looping(it is fair, because there IS counterplay), but not infinites, they are BS for killers(but they're getting fixed). 
---
Killers playing fair should not camp, as it's either "the survivors fault for unhooking at a bad time"(even though it's always a bad time, since you're camping), or the survivors are just left to die on their first hook. If they get unhooked, they're basically one shot, and have no where to run, how the hell is that fair for them?
---
 Please convince me how tunneling and camping is fair and FUN, because after all, this isnt WWIII, it's a game we play to have fun, we shouldnt play scummy just to get kills.
---
I mean he's a Pedo
---
You can hit survivors on the other side of that wall as any killer as long as they hug it, though?
---
I'd probably agree, if the timer stopped during chases, but that's a different issue. 
---
Enduring being stronger on pallets is going to help more than reducing a DS stun ever will, unless you tunnel.
---
Are Oinkers the new Bronies? Just asking questions.
---
Is this what tier 4 evil within looks like?
---
Played against that today and was ready to complain about the add-on being bugged. Decided to check 3.0.0 / PTB patch notes and gladly its been fixed already. 
---
Most BS thing ever, being exposed by the gas.
---
No. I said nerfed. Just making him weaker with no buffs is bad. Now if they change it and buff him elsewhere
---
That is quite the bullshit tho...
---
I agree with that. I just don't think he needs a nerf with no changes at all
---
Phrased myself wrongly in the endgame chat, I'm talking, 2-3 meters of distance from windows, animation looks like he lands a hit, From my perspective it's a swing and a miss,  I go down. You know, telepathic stuff.
---
Wait what ?
---
I mean I've used it against an insidious LF for a good basement play. I got unhooked (outside of basement) as someone was being carried downstairs so I followed with my DS active. I was gonna farm him hoping he'd hit me as I unhook and pick me up as he's leaving but I got grabbed out of the unhook animation, so I DSed out of the grab and saved buddy and we both managed to make it to God pallet before he could get us
---
Not really, just don't hug the wall.
---
&gt;.&lt;
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
r/titleporn
---
Suppose you haven't seen the memes of console players being relieved from the frame rate on consoles getting fixed
---
Someone doesn't now killers can hit over short walls / fences. Outplayed.
---
I feel like they're pretty good at chasing down and locating survivors though, and they can traverse most maps pretty well.
---
Yeah any killer can do this if the survivor hugs the wall
---
I mean it was like the 5th thing you said to someone who disagreed with you.  And he was right devs can‚Äôt win with people like you.
---
Make some space in hell for 4 instaheals
---
Maybe because the entity had to do the work and kill them.
---
Does t make sense. Don‚Äôt you lose blood points if you stay close to the hooked survivor?
---
How do you bring 4 BNPs and a flashlight?
---
It's there so the killer can't hit you. If they can hit you through it, it's bullshit
---
Oh, okay, my bad.
---
I mean... it is a fence :D
---
To be fair it‚Äôs the only way to survive once in a chase
---
That's a waste of 2 perk spots in my eyes.. no thanks
---
Yes and ur not supposed to hit through them
---
All you need to do is make sure you aren't physically hugging the wall, just make sure you're a little farther away than you would usually on a loop.  
---
Besides, it doesn't even matter in most cases.
---
I was staring directly at him the entire time with a pallet between us. I wasn't just standing in front of him doing nothing.
---
So why not remove it? If it doesn't matter why not remove it?
---
Did you read him a bedtime story :‚Äô)
---
All killers can hit over the fences in Haddonfield.  Use the fence to create space to break line of sight and cut though buildings to lose the killer.  The good part of Haddonfield is the windows in buildings for survivors.
---
I main killer too. You have good games and bad games but you just sound like you‚Äôve turned bitter after all of it and sucking the fun out.
---
Thats the gameplay though, the chase. Theres 4 of them and they cant kill you. THEY NEED to pull tricks to out do you. I agree if they‚Äôre teabagging endlessly or something its annoying but the rest is just viable gameplay more or less.
---
The only thing you‚Äôre doing is exacerbating the issue of toxic gameplay, the flow of the game os largely in the killers hands.
---
Some of the toxic gameplay is annoying but it cant possibly be fun to camp vs the dynamics of chasing and out maneuvering. And again if you just see points then you earn substantially less anyway.
---
see my other reply
---
I mean... at least he can't block the unhook box anymore
---
It‚Äôs finicky because they changed the 10% visibility req. to 20%. So he can pop his head around a corner and that survivor sees less than 20% of his body.
---
Add that to the Hitboxes of things and it gets really fucked. It‚Äôs like Huntress hatchets.
---
I'm not a dev, why ask me?  
---
All I'm saying is that as long as you're somewhat aware of it, you should never get hit there.
---
Umm he wasnt even facing the fence tho he was facing in front of him how does that hit?  Yall will defend a killer no matter what it's rather annoying...  
---
I've been hit over those fences but the killer was actually facing the fence.
---
But if, like you said, it's inconsequential most of the time, where is the harm in removing it entirely?
---
is that a bad thing though?
---
Actually you are
---
Anymore? You never could. 
---
Licensed characters can only be bought with money.
---
We have also removed every killer and survivor perk in the game for a perfectly balanced experience
---
Missing or Hitting it will disable it *for the whole game* but you can save it. Just let the skillcheck needle run it's course, and your DS will be saved.
---
So why do Huntress hatchets stop against them
---
I've gotten it from the game pass and I haven't had a single game as a killer. The wait times are forever
---
&gt;If they missed a skill check healing they'll probably miss their DS
---
I miss random gen and healing skill checks all the time, yet I rarely miss DS. You can tell when the skill check is about to pop, unlike with gens or healing. It's much easier to predict, and you're paying more attention when it's about to pop.
---
&gt;idk why ppl can't just agree that the perks is fine exactly where it is
---
To me, the perk isn't fine exactly where it is. I already said why: in some situations, DS punishes the killer for the survivor playing badly, which is poor design.
---
&gt;only changes I can think of to make would be to stop/slow the timer when being chased/slugged
---
Yeah, I think the perfect way to do it would be to shorten the timer, but make it stop during chases. That way the killer can't just wait out the shorter timer during a chase, but if they happen to find the survivor again fairly quickly, the timer will have run out, and the killer isn't punished for the survivor being found fast.
---
You deserved it tbh
---
A few days ago it was showing me that I could, maybe it was a bug?
---
&gt; I'm not a dev, why ask me?
---
Are you sure you were meant to reply to my comment?
---
Spirit, but it takes 4 good survivors to make Billy an M1 killer.
---
You *literally* said it doesn't matter. You don't need to be a dev to have an opinion on this. I'm asking why defend this if it doesn't matter whether or not it exists?
---
You can throw over them :) Just need to know where to aim.
---
I don't care if it exists or not as it never affects me.
---
So why defend its existence
---
Nope! Apologies definitely not towards you!
---
Eh? I wasnt the killer? ü§î
---
Ignore that guy. He seems to be deliberately overlooking that your post is about BP-limiting play during Bloodfest. What happened to you is very frustrating.
---
What else would the do once chased? Just run in a straight line and let you down em? :P
---
For clarity, I‚Äôm not in a pregame lobby at all and therefore cannot fill a lobby because it won‚Äôt put me in one. Also I closed the app and reset it 3 times.
---
Well if i end up in your game dont worry. I cant loop for shit üòÇ
---
Ohhhhhh sorry my bad I thought you were the killer lmao
---
New survivor: MacGuyver. He can put any addons in any equipment.
---
Oh my god you asshole hahahaha. that's hilarious.
---
You NEVER could
---
There is no need for insults, shitpost or not.
---
By not tunneling and not proxy camping hooks. I played fair and got all the way up to red ranks by avoiding unfun, scummy playstyles, and the survivors loved me for it, because I gave them a fun game where both sides benefited.
---
Of course it's effective for a killer to play like a sweaty, scumlord. Not only is it the easiest method, but they still get rewarded for it. To me, it's just like real life: Yes, I can be an asshole and lie to get what I want. Or I can just be a normal decent human being and earn the things I want. Really not sure how people are incapable of seeing how toxic and annoying that game style choice is for the other side. It's like camping in a corner of a building in Call of Duty. Effective. But gay.
---
Yeah, it's such a bad thing to have a chance to help everyone out and get you and your whole team 30k + the bonus from WGLF, instead of just 1 guy getting 5k cause he got camped, the other 8k and the last one who stealthed and found a hatch got 15k. Much better indeed xD
---
EW4:Betrayal.
---
Then wait. 
---
This is matchmaking right now.
---
Just verses a P3 fully loaded ruin Huntress with purple hatchets.
---
I LOVE the new ds. The amount of times I get farmed off a hook or camped &amp; tunneled is insane and it feels good to just be like FUCK YOU FOR TUNNELING ME BITCH. The only thing I have to complain about is the fact that if you‚Äôre right under a hook you can‚Äôt use ds because the killer will hook you before you can use it. Other than that I love the changes made to it, they did a pretty good job so far.
---
#BEGONE BOT
---
I never use it anymore. Yeah I get tunneled sometimes but it‚Äôs rare to get downed less than a minute after the unhook. Not worth a peek slot. I use Pharmacy instead.
---
Well obviously they aren‚Äôt supposed to be able to
---
People already do this with instaheals (Anticoagulent Syringe or whatever the real name is) and brown medkits. It's not really a problem.
---
I agree, my only problem is, if i do too well (as Nurse) i'll still be punished even if i don't tunnel :/
---
He's already super strong in ways that don't make sense. For him to be able to stalk a survivor in a chase within slicing range while being able to maintain the chase is absurd, especially when the survivor is trying to break him out of the ability. It's a perfectly reasonable nerf that doesn't require a buff to counteract it.
---
Whatever man
---
Because hatches have shitty hitboxes
---
If you can‚Äôt get past rank 6, it means you either don‚Äôt play enough or you‚Äôre just a purple rank player. 
---
Yeah, the requirements to pip are a little bogus but the best players can still get to the best ranks.
---
Oh okay you're one of those guys
---
What I'm saying is, by the time the survivor is trying to 360 the killer the Stalk should be broken
---
I‚Äôm here for ALL the feng min cosmetics
---
^this and plus why do you care to get to Rank 1 rank = nothing in this game and all it will get you is 30min+ queue times
---
You NEED to practice so you can get good and not use tunnel tactics so much
---
I can no longer tell what's a DC and what's just an untimely game crash
---
Those fences are practically the same height as the window vault, ergo you can get hit over them. 
---
They are there for you to run around not just stand on one side so you can‚Äôt get hit. If you‚Äôd have hugged the wall of the building instead of the fence the you wouldn‚Äôt have been hit.
---
If anything he still need 1-2 buffs, like immunity to detection perks while in Night Shroud and also fixing his add-ons, they are confusing as hell at the moment.
---
There needs to be a tutorial video to navigate Lery's and the Game.
---
"JuSt ClEaNsE tOtEmS" and go gens and run from the killer and save prople and heal people. Gee. It's almost as if I already have a lot to do as a survivor and don't always have the luxury of cleansing totems as well.
---
What rank are you?
---
You can't buy licensed characters with shards.
---
I'm just annoyed because I get prayer beads out every time I go against 3 spirit matches. But the spirit has so much mindgaming potential alongside with her strong power alongside no Vault animation it is easy to fake vaulting too. I don't get why she has a strong passive ability and very strong power. I don't want her to get nerfed since it will be dumb and unfair to another player who like to play spirit but at least add or change some stuff with her like for example body collision while she is haunting is the most ridiculous thing ever.
---
i think it was adrenaline from the hatch closing actually. can't let that slide either though
---
The definition of a competitive game is merely a game ‚Äúin which players play against one another and where one player winning means another player loses‚Äù (via changingminds.org). This definition also includes games in which a point system is utilized to score players and what they‚Äôve done in game. This is literally what DBD is, a game that pits players against players, where you‚Äôll either survive/die or kill/lose survivors (win or lose), and there is a point gain system and a scoreboard at the end. 
---
I don‚Äôt disagree that those elements make it a bad competitive game, but I still believe it‚Äôs a competitive game. Any game that pits players against players with a ranked system where one side can win or lose, that can have tournaments (where players compete to win, which dead by daylight has had) is a competitive game. There are competitive games with DLC and unlockables specific to certain characters or player levels, so DBD wouldn‚Äôt even be the first game to have that. I think the competitive nature of players is absolutely idiotic, since there are so many things you can‚Äôt control/so many things randomized. Even if your personal opinion is that the game isn‚Äôt a competitive game, it still has one of the most competitive player communities I‚Äôve ever seen, and I‚Äôve been playing PVP competitive games for a while. It also adheres to the literal definition of a competitive game.
---
It's probably pissed that it had to do the job itself
---
For Myers it‚Äôs
---
Bbq a chilli
---
Enduring
---
Bamboozle/ monitor and abuse or spirit fury
---
Ruin
---
Add-ons:
---
Memorial flower
---
J.myers memorial.
---
For survivor for ash I usually customise my load out with perks but my favourite is
---
Borrowed time
---
Small game
---
Botany knowledge
---
Self care or wake up.
---
I think he's already around Michael tier; giving him immunity to detection perks would be great, however.  
---
His add-ons are confusing, and most of them are pretty bad.
---
Oopsie you didn't find the totem hidden in the darkest most random bumfuck area of the map
---
Have fun being 1 hit by pure skill
---
Not a good idea if playing solo
---
All good!
---
Ever heard of we're gonna live forever?
---
That could be the case, I do my best to grind it out but it'll take me a day of playing to rank up once or twice in that range (or i'll have some shitty games near the end, go back to where I was at the beginning and shut the game off)
---
Obviously it's not impossible or people wouldn't be there, but it's really hard. Do you have any specific tips?
---
Deviousness: 100
---
Plus, also, the game is described as ‚Äúasymmetrical,‚Äù which means that both sides won‚Äôt have an even chance of winning (because of the power-ups/locked teachables/etc)
---
you don't want to use monitor to actually keep people in your terror radius reach. personally i use bbq, overcharge+ruin (to always track them if they fail skillchecks) and nurses
---
I assure you, if i was the killer i wouldnt post it as though i was bragging lol
---
I'm rank 10 in NA and the game just randomly crashes mid match for me half the time. PC btw
---
I run dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed time and MoM
---
Or 
---
Mom, adrenaline, ds,dh
---
I'd take out selfcare and replace with borrower time
---
And spine chill for DH or balanced landing
---
I find that going into the ps4 settings and redoing my internet helps when the game does this, other than that theres not much you can do
---
if doctor and myers had a baby
---
So if they're supposed to go through the fence why not just remove it entirely
---
That's something that I think people should know more about. Knowing I spawned in a shit map or got unlucky really helps me not get worked up about a loss. Like if I spawn on Haddonfield with 4 bl users I'm going to lose. If I spawn on shelter woods with 4 randoms and a good killer I'm also going to lose.
---
Knowing when you got unlucky or when you got a shit map really helps not getting angry about losing
---
Not if you DC, no. It's only if someone doesn't load in.
---
You should've used Rancor instead of Spirit Fury.
---
Spirit Fury is useless on Spirit and it's even more useless without Enduring, while Rancor can help you to track survivors while phase walking.
---
You need to get better and outplay mettle of man and safe pallets. /s
---
I understand that, but I still don't have the rank 1 achievement for survivor, and it's a nice goal to have, even if the reward isn't anything particularly amazing. Doing it a least once would be nice in a "even I can do it too" sense.
---
They don't load you Into a lobby until they find Surviviors to go in it with you is what I read
---
right, but like, gens are the only objective for survivors. at low ranks (which you just said you were at) survivors don‚Äôt want to be chased, so none of them are going to go stand in the middle and wait for the killer to come and hit them. low rank survivors are also terrible in chases, and most low rank survivors seem to want to just finish gens and escape, regardless of how many points they‚Äôll actually get. it‚Äôs not the survivors fault for doing what they‚Äôre supposed to be doing lmao and there are also ways around it now? including endgame? But even without endgame like if killers have a hard time finding survivors they‚Äôre probably at the gens, so it would probably be a good idea for them to check gens, but I remember a lot of low rank killers not even really doing that lol
---
The minimum requirements reccomend a gtx 460 which I'm pretty sure is more powerful than your gpu. May be worth trying the game and refunding if you can't run it :)
---
'Member old bloodwebs, i 'member
---
Because of reset I‚Äôm 14 right now. I don‚Äôt usually play much Killer, and I certainly don‚Äôt usually play Legion. I‚Äôm a survivor main.
---
You can't buy a licensed character with I shards. You never have been able to
---
No tips. You just have to play well. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be five gen looping killers every game, and killers usually don‚Äôt camp at high ranks so you‚Äôll have opportunity. 
---
Most games you‚Äôll be black pipping. Take advantage of longer games. It‚Äôll be easier to pip in their next update.
---
Lmao, totally me xD as a console player I'm just ass with her most of the time
---
Define a "civilized game"
---
Can't find a full lobby as killer. I can only get 3 survivors at a given time. Been waiting for 35 minutes already, in a new lobby (I had created one, waited 20 min, and retried). This is getting frustrating.
---
As a survivor main I say this. If a killer wants to camp on a hook, they should. It gives the other survivors free time to do gens. I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this but it's worth it
---
Lemme guess. He dared to not just run in a straight line
---
Literally since when? It doesn‚Äôt take 30+ minutes as killer to find a lobby and I‚Äôve literally never seen it sit me in a search for a lobby before ever. I‚Äôve always been put in a pregame to wait and search within 5 seconds of readying to find a match.
---
I got a game like that. The Doctor I was against hooked one guy, then downed another, took him and put him down at the feet of the hooked guy so he could camp them both and insure no one could have BPS.
---
But hey, it's a strategy right ? :)
---
What SJW downvoted this man? Have an upvote friend.
---
Leave us and our nurse fetish alone!!
---
I tried playing Killer earlier and it did the same thing. Still waiting. Almost at the 1 hour mark.
---
Old DS was strong, but IMO tied with self care for being the most overrated survivor perk on reddit.
---
Short version: use eyes and ears.
---
Long version: so there is tier 1 mirror Myers, which is complete trash, since he won't gain bloodlust on tier 1 and you can basically infinite him on any pallet. Also his lunge attack is ridiculous short so on lerys specifically every window is an easy way to outrun him. His only upside is the non-existant heartbeat, but then again you can watch your surrounding area, not only for Myers but also for crows or other teammates. You will know when he is close. In addition to that you can also here is breath and footsteps, sure if you're sitting on a Gen it's harder but you can still hear him.
---
Then of course there is tier 2 mirror Myers, which is the better version since the doc came out because with monitor and abuse Myers has almost no heartbeat in tier 2. Unless he is in a chase, but then you will know where he is anyways. Tier 2 mirror Myers has the big advantage that he can get close up to survivors and then hit them when they don't know where to run.
---
I‚Äôll try thank, thank you.
---
He was going for adept from the looks of it. But with those addons and an ebony, no damm way
---
That's an interesting idea. People might even camp less in that case if their main motive was to spite the survivor. If getting back at that survivor awards them points, then they won't wanna do it.
---
That‚Äôs just the killer leaving ?
---
If you saw it say you could with shards, then it was definitely a bug you have never been able to purchase Licensed characters with Shards.
---
You‚Äôre overthinking it. Large terror radius is just the downside of having instadown.
---
They do favor the shooter in this game. If it shows that you got hit on the killers screen, then you get hit.
---
Spirit at least needs to give it some effort.
---
Every time I‚Äôve played on this map lately, that‚Äôs where ruin has been, so people are used to it now lol
---
Omg he hasn't even came out yet and yall are crying about nerfs...  so annoying...
---
Lmao what are they supposed to do?
---
I've only had a hard crash once, but for the past month I've been experiencing the game just disconnecting  me mid-match as survivor and killer
---
Wraiths probs the only guy I use it on since he struggles vs windows
---
Honestly, I feel like slugging is some kind of sacred knowledge to lots of people. I slug instead of tunneling, and it feels like I win more from this than if I would tunnel otherwise
---
Okay, thanks for the clarification.
---
It isn't really called camping if the killer is chasing someone else around the hook. They're just doing what they are meant to be doing. The survivor should think smarter and move away to allow a rescue.
---
Idk why it didnt show me as dead since I am there lol
---
Play swf so theres no dcing and you get to rotate saves and have time to totem hunt and be chased, you literally have to do everything if you wanna pip.
---
Imo hag, spirit and clown should be higher, spirit can destroy in chases because survivors don't know if she's going to phase walk or not, they have to guess which is up to the spirit to beat them. Hag can place a trap in a pallet loop and make it ineffective and clown can throw bottles in loops and either get a hit, or force survivors to throw down the pallet really early
---
Lol at these players correcting his grammar cause they got destroyed by ghostface in the PTB. You must be really bad, huh?
---
Piggy no. Bad Piggy. You besmirch the good name of Piggy mains! 
---
In all srsness I do hope BHVR cracks down on this stuff bc it really isn't okay to go around calling people the N word
---
I mean, everyone has their own playstyle. I don't slug because it's too easy &amp; fun for nobody.
---
Aren't the Legion girls unsympathetic?
---
You can‚Äôt reason with them. Don‚Äôt try. Most of the people here are the whiney killer mains. 
---
And I agree with you. I literally don‚Äôt understand the fucking point in a WALL if it can be swung through. Just to warn you, the cattle corrals or the iron bar fences on that one coldwind map are the same way as the fences on Haddonfield now. They changed them a few patches ago. And I hate it too.
---
I like the age-old mind game:
---
"My controller died"
---
?
---
Yeah, 90% of Ghostface's gimmick was the fact that he could be anyone, even the dude standing next to you. The other 10% being cold calling, movie trivia, and getting smacked in the face with lamps
---
He tried to frenzy me and missed in a position where it was easy lol
---
I'm fairly sure that was a meme somewhere but I can't remember...
---
Edit: From the point where I push triangle to start the killer lobby fyi.. And the lobby just does not get created
---
Supply and demand
---
As i said, the fact you can outrun him is not important, a good Mirror Myers won‚Äôt go into a chase with you. Yup you can hear him a little, but it‚Äôs very faint, and even if you do so, you do not exactly know where he is coming from, and he know where you are going, so he might intercept you at the corner of a wall or at a door.
---
If you are not in a team speak Sfw, your teammate won‚Äôt be of much use. However, I never thought about crows, and it‚Äôs true it might be the most efficient way to detect him (even though it‚Äôs situational, as they are not everywhere).
---
Mirror Myers Tier 2 is not very useful, 16 meters is not that much to detect survivors, and the movement speed is almost reduced to that of tier 1 Myers because of the vanity mirror. He might be a bit more stealthy though, with the dead rabbit + M&amp;A.
---
I‚Äôm not saying Mirror Myers is impossible to escape on those map, but that he is a tough killer to face, and that you‚Äôll need a bit of luck also.
---
I mean. I also main killer. But I'm part of the Nurse master race so I don't deal with these issues that much if at all. 
---
But I also play Survivior and I've been on the receiving end of a fuckload of bullshit, and this is one of those things that any sensible person should look at and say "that should not have hit". 
---
I keep forgetting that as bad as Survivior mains can be as far as toxicity and BMing go, killers are worse in the sense that they literally want BHVR to turn Surviviors into free kills for them.
---
I‚Äôve been having the same problem, also on PS4. I feel like part of it might be people just not wanting to play, since BL2 just released a huge DLC and allowed ppl to start new characters at a higher level (I know a lot of ppl including myself are just playing that instead and it‚Äôs a lot more fun lol plus I believe siege and some other games announced new content at E3 also which might be out and more people want to play those and actually have fun) but the last few bloodhunts it‚Äôs felt like it‚Äôs been harder to find matches, and my personal theory is people just don‚Äôt want to deal with the extra toxicity of the game during bloodhunt? It always feels like more survivors are just farming unsafe unhooks and being shitty to killers and killers are just bringing instadowns or moris and camping/tunneling. The game feels a lot less fun during bloodhunt, and if you don‚Äôt even really get a chance to get any bloodpoints what‚Äôs the reason in trying to play lol
---
I LOVE IT
---
Those players disgust me
---
My ship of Mea is getting more and more real every day
---
Yeah can agree, i live in aus and played killer last night, 4 different matches i had 1 random throw a pallet on me and teabag, then ijust  do what i usually do,chase them down them nod my head alot after chasing them for less then 30 seconds, then they just dc

---
If survivor takes no time to find a game, and killer takes a lot of time to find a game then I‚Äôm sure you can figure out what‚Äôs going on.
---
Removed - Offtopic
---
It‚Äôs double bp event. More people play killer cause you earn more bloodpoints.
---
Did you get a pip from that? Or at least a safety pip? I‚Äôm curious.
---
Something is or has been going on with matchmaking since Friday I think. Hence now why it searches for a lobby for ages before actually creating one for you. 
---
Sometimes I get a full Killer lobby in 2 minutes other times it takes me 10+ minutes just to create one. Survivor side is the same. Have a few back to back games where i‚Äôm in a lobby in under a minute then it has me waiting upwards of 10 minutes a time before I give up and start the search again.
---
Tier19 on xbox (just started playing) 90% of games the killer camps the hooks, if it's a huntress then 100%. Extra annoying
---
Love me a good Good Place meme on this subreddit üòÇ
---
New Survivor: Janet
---
New Killer: Shawn
---
New Map: The Bad Place
---
yeah fuck em
---
A killer should have counters. 
---
Spine chill isn‚Äôt meta. OoO isn‚Äôt meta. Premonition isn‚Äôt meta.
---
Did you read the post?
---
I still remember this one game when we spawned together and one of us was asleep, so we woke him up and Freddy immediately disconnected.
---
Since when did legion get a semi instadown?
---
Its almost like the dev's expect the survivors to be in 4 places at once
---
You should try to get a squad of survivors and do SWF with a voice party. It‚Äôs easier to do well when you can communicate, and your teammates won‚Äôt disconnect. I saw someone else say you‚Äôre just meant to be a purple rank or something and that‚Äôs not true. Rank up requirements get insanely demanding after the pip system change, and even good players have a really hard time ranking up sometimes, just because you have to do so much. You pretty much have to do gens, get chased, and get unhooks a few times if you want to keep ranking up, and that‚Äôs not always possible (sometimes the killer just isn‚Äôt getting hooks, or you‚Äôre being chased while someone is hooked, etc). There are a lot of things out of your control in this game, and with how hard the pip system is at near red to red ranks, it‚Äôs really difficult to get there and stay there, especially solo-queuing since survivors have no accountability.
---
It's bloodhunt and you can get more points as killer. So thats what people are playing
---
This is why playing with friends makes the game more fun :)
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs been like that for a while now. Usually it‚Äôs just really fast.
---
That jacket is glorious I want it
---
I remember having a try hard nurse match and feeling the deep deep pain of seeing 4 party streamers and having to apologize for not looking at the burning screen.
---
No One Escapes Death, just figure fit out myself lol
---
I believe tunneling is even less fun for everybody. There's specific context we're talking about rn.
---
New killer perk involves cocoons?
---
Definitely lol this in my eyes is not a solo game because panicking with friends is just too much fun üòÇüò≠
---
*screams internally*
---
Just don‚Äôt hug the fence. Hug the building
---
That isn't the point.
---
Can I save this in my DbD backgrounds folder for potentially using it as a cheap background for drawings?
---
Like I just want to play Legion perkless, I don't want to wait 4 hours for that
---
It‚Äôs creative and sounds like a breath of fresh air for the game, but I imagine it must suck to just be shoulder slugged for a whole game during Bloodhunt.
---
Except when the survivor uses it as a protection perk along with dead hard and MoM to stop you from chasing the rescuer like you're supposed to.
---
Removed - Spam, Shaming other players
---
I think you were kicked from the game, actually. You can see that last person didn't get escape points. If the killer DCs, everyone gets 5000 escape points.
---
I know the feeling my dude.
---
Also, how did you upload a video like that using mobile reddit?
---
Lmao everything I mentioned is stuff KILLERS whined about and got nerfed. Im not reliant on any of those things and is to enjoy the game a lot I'm just saying everyone loves to point at survivors wanting shit nerfed and whining about but never want to acknowledge themselves. Look at the tree in your eye before you point out the stick in others.
---
Playing solo sucks, I highly suggest if you can to play swf with good survivors since swf communication and coordination boosts your chances of winning by a massive amount. If you can't do that, then my only suggestion is play to your best capabilities and hope for the best since you have to rely on your random teammates.
---
Also as a side note, don't get too worked up about rank, it doesn't mean anything and doesn't give you any rewards so it's pretty much pointless. You also get longer queue times
---
Could you do it again? One of the Devs stated it does not work like this explictily. Maybe they changed it under the hood with Patch 2.7 without telling anyone how it was before.
---
It‚Äôs not hit boxes, the killer is the host so he has 0 ping. Yeah you might have 30 ping but the killer will always have the advantage of if it happens on his screen it doesn‚Äôt matter what you see it happened.
---
You‚Äôve never been able to.
---
I have no problem with him trying to survive it's just annoying to watch people to play like that nothing against the guy
---
It‚Äôs been like this all week lol
---
The Entity took Danny in the summer of 1993.
---
OoO is meta regarding swf.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs locked at 60 FPS anyways
---
Great, yea I learned that the ps4 eats band with like a mf the longer its been on, I have to reset the connection everytime I play a psnow game or dbd
---
It is 
---
*frustated oink*
---
Nerf chainsaws, yes.
---
Tunneling/camping are encouraged in the games currently state, DCing is meta
---
I can and I will
---
haha, Its good
---
We could change it to only affect exposed effects.
---
why Buckle Up tho...
---
The killer‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt scream...
---
Meme of the week award goes to you.
---
I like it, but I would word it differently:
---
First part with token is fine, but the end would be worded like that: next time you are hit while under the exposed effect and healthy, put you into the injured state instead of the dying state, and consume one token.
---
Correct. This is the issue and it‚Äôs been like this for a week for me! Almost seems like a bugg that relates to the survivor lobby searching lol
---
I don't know about you but even if I don't find these "dumb Memes" funny, I'd much rather see them than listen to people screech that killers/survivors are op
---
Seems fair. My wording was off.
---
So aside from NOED and Rancor, nerf Myres, Ghostface, MYC, Haunted Grounds, Devour Hope, and Iron Maiden?
---
yeah ik but i have 30-50 fps on frickin meadium
---
The original idea is good though. With exposed effect becoming more and more present, a perk countering it would be a good idea, while not being op (because some killer don‚Äôt run exposed at all) 
---
Dunno if it should work on chainsaws tho
---
So it's annoying to watch them...try to survive. Got it
---
This game is broken. It‚Äôs a joke that u need to fucking wait 10 mins to join as killer and as a survivor too. What‚Äôs wrong with the matchmaking- on normal days it takes ~ 1-3 mins, now &gt;5min both of them. I‚Äôm so happy I got this game 4 free, spending money for this trash would‚Äôve killed me
---
Sarcastic know-all.. Thnx for your contribution
---
Although you might have good intentions you could have done it in a less condescending way. Not everyone online speaks the same language or is as adept at the English language as you clearly think you are. Maybe have a little empathy before you just comment like that? Also it's not the fact you use a full stop that makes you seem arrogant it is the way you correct people as if we are students and your the teacher.   
---
I see your point the time frame may be difficult but I have seen other PC gamers do it so it is possible.
---
What does swf mean?
---
It would be a straight nerf to Myres and Ghostface.
---
Just a very safe spot for you to hook people at; it's difficult to get out of the basement without taking a hit or two.
---
My rule is only "farming" if a survivor drops a bloody party streamer. I‚Äôll hook everybody twice and just mess around at the end with survivors. Farming every game isn‚Äôt fun, but try to max it out as much as you can and play normally :)
---
That‚Äôd be great if killer queue times weren‚Äôt 20 minutes long
---
I got hunted by this perk one time. I was like wtf...
---
My bad, I forgot I am able to psychically communicate my actions with my teammates.
---
Well it is strong, I guarantee he will end up being a better base Michael with a lot less downsides once people understand how he works more and more. I'm not saying gut him right away either or too even gut him, maybe some number tweaks would be fine.
---
Hell don't rush it either I'll wait until mid chapter after playing against him in the live and maybe change my opinion. This is just my concern at first glance of him.
---
Removing it completely? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ lad just don‚Äôt hug the fence and you are fine, it‚Äôs such a small fence it‚Äôs not bullsbit if the killer can reach over and hit you. If they removed it entirely then there would be no protection. It‚Äôs not the devs or the killers fault you don‚Äôt understand that killers have reach and it makes perfect sense for a killer to be able to hit someone over a small fence if they are right beside it. There‚Äôs plenty of space for the survivor to hug the wall instead of the fence. Take it as a learning curve instead of being a bitch about it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Those damn pickles
---
Yeah. Watching streamers on pc and seeing them finding lobbies in seconds hurts the most. I think switching to pc would be better, but spending money for this trash is no option
---
Normally for me it takes less than 15sec all day everyday..
---
True
---
This map is terrifying with legion
---
Maybe it should only work on non powers? It is complicated but anything that counters NOED is great.
---
I main killer sweetheart. But I've seen enough bullshit like this
---
Balanced landing on Haddonfield makes me want to commit not alive
---
‚ÄòS a lot of details on this one, click and zoom around to find them.
---
 please don‚Äôt respostti
---
I actually purchased the game.. should have waited until I could get it on ps+... No actually had a great time before ;)
---
Legit megs dont do this only when they have dlc top its so weird lmao
---
Same
---
Yup, but there is only 5 totem on the map, and you are competing with other surv to cleanse it.
---
Plus it is situational, and I don‚Äôt think everyone would run it 
---
Finally it might be solution to camping leatherface if we make it so that it resist chainsaws too
---
At 5 gens too. üôÑ Please tell me this guy got genrushed to shit.
---
Played a game yesterday where a huntress brought the one hit axes and two extra axes. He camped the first hook, which I was near and I saw how this was going to happen. I just started working on gens. At 2 gens down, a guy and me go to save the hook. The guy gets one shotted and slugged till the hook dies, and sure enough, huntress puts the slug on a hook and camps the new hook. We get down to one gen left and I almost finish it before huntress comes and gets me. I made a decent chase with mind games and hiding hoping our fourth would get the last gen but the one hit axe got me the first time he got clear line of sight. Huntress camps me so I tried escaping the hook to kill myself immediately so this fourth guy doesn‚Äôt come save me. He finds the hatch and escapes. 
---
Honestly killers do it because they can get 3 kills. Survivors just need to gen rush camping killers. We could have had 3 escape if we didn‚Äôt go on our hopeless rescue mission. Killers would stop doing it if they only got one kill per game
---
Now camping killers who have insidious... no idea what to do there
---
If you're trying to counter NOED, bring Small Game.  
---
Small Game could use that totem counter, however.
---
Survive With Friends
---
When you party up and go into a match
---
Agreed. She‚Äôs so cute I just wanna hug her.
---
Lol now ruin is toxic?
---
I like knowing where the killer is and if picking someone off the ground is worth the risk
---
Thanks and thank you for the critique.
---
For many its the best build in the game. You sprint burst and run straight, and when the killer catches you still run straight, he hits you, still run straight, drop a pallet without looking back, get downed, salt after the game.
---
It is frustrating, the last few games ive played, where against billy...
---
And literally if i got hooked he would just stand in front of me and wiggle around trying to be cocky. Or hed just chainsaw around very close to the hook so noone could ever rescue me.
---
It pissed me off, but i cant really blame him either. I play as both a survivor main, and a killer when i feel like it. And im failry new to the game so im not the best killer whats so ever. 
---
But when your getting gen rushed, looped, and in games with toxic survivors, the only way you can really do what you are suppose to do in the game is to be "toxic" yourself wether its face camping, using add-ons, amoris, etc... Like the amount of times ive played killer, and played without camping, using add ons, etc ill get messages from the survivors (xbox one) of them being cocky and smart asses because they escaped. Same thing with when i play toxic, except i get less rude messages. 
---
A killer has to do what he can to get his points and his kills, as thats what the role of the killer is, is to kill the survivors, but the survivors definetly have a greater advantage then killers, minus killers who can insta down survivors, etc.
---
And theres always strategies around things like face camping, sure it sucks to get face camped but if the other survivors are smart, just use that time to gen rush, and or locate the hatch. Whats the point of letting one hooked player possibly cost you survivors the game? Like if the gens are done, and doors opened just leave? Is it really worth saving everyone? 
---
I mainly play survivor and even ill see other survivors being toxic to the killer so ill sit there and heelp the killer out lol. 
---
Like last night, i was in a game with someone playing legion, i was doing a gen and watched as legion was carrying someone to the hook, and watched as another survivor started to try and body block and tea bag the legion and just making it unfair for the poor legion. So whenever id see a survivor looping the killer, id stand in front of the window or the pallet they are using just to fuck over that survivor and have them end up getting caught.
---
The legion caught on to me helping her, and would just ignore me when ever she saw me, and if i saw the other survivors doing something toxic to her, or being asses. Id step in and end up getting them fucked over.
---
I dont care if that can get me banned or in trouble, but i dont support toxicity in games. I want to enjoy my videogames and not have to deal with people being toxic and making thw game unfun for others. A killer is suppose to kill, so let them. Who cares if you get hooked, or killed just enjoy the game for what it is, a horror survival game. But infinite looping, body blocking, are all toxic ways and make it so killers cant have fun and end up either becoming survivor mains, or quitting the game. The only reasons killers play toxicly is because they play against toxic survivors amd so they fight fire with fire. 
---
Just think that a killer wouldnt have to resort to face camping and other toxic means, if he didnt have to deal with toxic survivors. 
---
Its a win-win if both sides play fairly, if survivors stop doing toxic things, killers wont resort to toxic behavior. 
---
And ive been in touch with a lot of killers (off reddit, and mainly groups of friends and people ive met while playing random games) both survivor mains and killer mains, and the reason they all pretty much have given for doing toxic things is because the other side has done toxic things. One of the killers ive met said he started playing toxicly after dealing with toxic survivors, and survivor mains have said they do it because most of the killers theyve dealt with have been toxic.
---
we were saying the gameplay mechanic wasn't working as intended, and that another mechanic is in place to stop people from playing in a lame way. Don't cry childish when people point out the reasons and problems with certain gameplay mechanics.
---
This here is the precise reason why it boils my blood whenever I see a dumb fuck complaining about hitboxes. They NEVER know what the fuck they are talking about. 
---
Almost all of those hits were caused by ping! The only exception was the Clown, where you got hit because of the pallet drop when the killer had already missed.
---
Had a match last night with 4 BPS , went against a clown. Downed me hooked me, I got unhooked came right back , past the Meg who unhooked me trying to body block for me, downed me again. Hooked me. Then proceeded to walk around the hook throwing bottles so I wouldn‚Äôt be unhooked during struggle phase. Left the match with like no points. 
---
I watched the rest of the game and he did the same to other players. You can play however you want that‚Äôs fine, but when you see four BPS, maybe you know let‚Äôs have some fun and not be a dick to everyone and get more points for yourself as well ? I don‚Äôt understand people who love to ruin the fun for others. But hey, you do you.
---
Completely agreed
---
Or nurse on any map with any add ons, or without them.
---
We're all sexy, except for skooks
---
whatever, you have a decent build but the perk is way too situational, you're better off using BT or Hope instead
---
I can‚Äôt even go to the lobby as a killer...  it‚Äôs stucked in ‚Äúsearching for match‚Äù
---
Dont ever just stay at the gate on endgame collapse
---
Its just an achievement play for the fun if you do nothing but try and get the achievement then every bad game will put you on tilt making you play worse, i have like 500+ hours and dont have rank 1 killer or survivor i just play for BP
---
Are you on PC or console?
---
More like the back and forth thing is annoying to watch thats all I'm saying.
---
Oh wow. Didn‚Äôt realize that. Good to know!
---
I've been playing Trapper a lot lately (got him up to 50 and wanted to burn through all my items before I prestige) and I find it so funny how players full well knowing they are playing against a trapper still run into obvious traps
---
I mean I literally had a guy who was a skilled looper so I threw a bear trap down next to the nearby pallet than started the chase and he immediately stepped in it
---
I've also had people step in the same trap multiple times in the same spot because it's such a popular looping spot (Often the window on the house going to the basement on Coldwind, Strode, etc)
---
Halving chainsaw damage even once a game can cause the killer to lose a ton of pressure.
---
Im in the U.S and ive had many games where in the lobby my ping was perfectly fine but then i get in the game and it just goes to shit.
---
I had a game where i even spawned in after the laoding screen finished, played for like 30 seconds heard the killer heartbeat and music chasing me, but didnt see them, jumped the a window and started walking upstairs and then got lag teleported back to outside the window and downed by the killer, then was about to struggle free and then got teleported onto the hook, and was having to struggle against the entity..
---
-.- its like the connection was so bad, that i was behind like a minute.
---
I think Hex that activates on a random totem after the first gen is completed
---
Very strong build, replace buckle up with balanced landing and you have the strongest survivor build
---
Did you draw that?! This is amazing! I love the combination of linework and gradient shading!
---
Either you meant to say you‚Äôre new to Dead by Daylight or you‚Äôre in the wrong subreddit, but I‚Äôm not sure which.
---
Are there killers that dont camp and tunnel during this bloodhunt? no lie I played the game for ages yesterday and yet I could count on one hand the number of killers who didn't hang around the hook area and immediately go to tunnel down the unhooked survivor.
---
I noticed that Asgore, who is a character from Undertale, has horns that reminded me of the Hex:Ruin icon. The generator is above his head. I‚Äôm not like some professional artist or anything, I just wanted to demonstrate this visual gag :p
---
Wait, what are the rumors?
---
this Post is equally pathetic lol. just get over it

---
Nah. You can call me toxic and I guess it is but if they wiggle I drop them and close the hatch and they can just die on the floor I guess. They wanted to wiggle free so I let them go :/
---
yea everyone has kinda been a bit try hard for a double bp event
---
Yea how dare killers play how they want! Every killer should play the exact same way so survivors can get easy BP and wins.
---
I dont think survivors should have to play a certain way they OBVIOUSLY take waaay more skill to play than anything else and killers should know that and let survivors get easy BP and escapes its the only thing that makes sense.
---
what?
---
You‚Äôre right, I meant dead by daylight!
---
Pathetic for wanting a drama free end to the game? lol "BUT BUT DA SURRRVIV0R WIGGELD!!!1 NOW I NEED TO HOOK DEM INSTED!!

I play from Australia on PS4 and there is very little waiting time.

you throw a drama about not getting a free hatch....that is really petty
---
Now cracks a noble heart. Good-night, sweet Dwight; And rows of lockers sing thee to thy rest.
---
but why? why does it matter? it seems really insecure. You want to let them go but decide against it because they didn't give up?

I actually died on my first hook today doe to a camping killer. Trapper actually.
---
Yeah! It took a damn age to do but I‚Äôm honestly proud of this one. The shading gave me a lot of trouble but in the end, I‚Äôm happy with how it turned out. Thanks!
---
100%
---
Plunderers instinct op
---
That's absolutely fair :) Pretty much the same, just lamenting the people that are going overboard on the IWIN stuff, like Killers Insta downing and mori killing people fast or Survivors wanting to try to god loop Killers forever (I,know partially Killers fault for not breaking chase)  but I,guess people just want to win or fear one aide wants to screw over the others.
---
Thankfully my,mood is so much better after a SWF Dropped 3 Streamers and actually took time to message me asking to farm.  I left with 200k points and a lot of shenanigans, like traping everyone and see if they can escape before the Endgame Collapse kills anyone as they slug crawled out
---
My bad if it made you angry, but I have no clue about how the game works or how internet connection affects the gameplay. I am just playing the game and all I can tell is that the killers always gets hits off that never should have connected. All I can say is my own personal internet connection is stable. But regardless this problem still has to be fixed somehow. It can not be true that people will turn their blind side towards someone getting smacked in the face with a hatchet from 10 meters away. It ruins the gameplay and it ruins the fun. And if a game is not fun, then why bother? I love Dead by Daylight, but each time a hit connects, which should not have connected, a feeling of impatience and anger grows larger and larger. 
---
Anyways, thank you for your time, and sorry for the inconvenience.
---
I heard you can turn off memes. As in not see them yourself. I cannot describe this any better. Imagine this, you see 3 different things, someone told you, hey you can see the 2 things and not the 3rd one, and I would like to know how to not see the thing.
---
That'd also be great if Survivors were willing to farm with you. So far, only one single group has been farming with me; and to be honest, if I waste any more time seeing whether or not a group would like to farm, I end up getting no BP at all because they're tryharding me while I'm trying to communicate I'm friendly.
---
Sure they don't have to go along. But I would really have expected a few more Survivors to be fine with it during the event.
---
I msg them first and ask for an ID to confirm their age. If they're adult, I give the hatch. If it's a kid, no hatch. We can't be teaching the youth that life gives things for free without having to work for them.
---
None but you know bhvr
---
dont think thats possible
---
&gt;Survivors complaining about being killed
---
Nothing to see here, move along.
---
Wow! A person who disregards what I said in favor of insulting my intelligence! How rare (not)! But since you're curious, I do know that killers were able to get at least 2 kills back then. On release, the Wraith was considered op since he could "sneak up on you" despite people being able to see him shimmering while invisible. So yeah, killers were able to kill those poor idiots. But they didn't have anything to combat the list of shit I made, all of which survivors not only had, but abused regularly.
---
In ps4 sometimes the number freezes from bloodweb purchases.
---
They might be accepting ideas for ghostface as they have the license for the mask nearby any body or weapon ideas are eligible just not the mask
---
Sounds like the build that gets mew tunneled. Otherwise a good build
---
That's a funny "Boo! A Madea Halloween" reference
---
If you using Nvidia graphics card, enable shadowplay, it lets you record last 5 minutes of gameplay.
---
power tripping for the survivor not rolling over and accepting the killer as their god. "I'll let you go but its on MY TERMS DAMMIT!!"
---
No thanks, just hook me and get it over with. Douches.
---
Unironically outplayed
---
makes sense
---
It means the killers are going to dodge the lobby
---
Oh look another person that has no idea how multiplayer games work blaming everything on hitboxes
---
thanks for the tip.
---
those poor pickles. ;_; rip
---
Some survivors don't know how to be stealth and that's normal, don't be a dick.
---
But I actually have faced a iridescent head huntress with whispers ruin and everything that survivors love on this bloodhunt and it was really easy to avoid her but the others don't know that you really do NOT go for a save or a risky action when she is around, we was about to get the last generator but somehow she ended up with a 4k. üò§
---
Hey, you're welcome.
---
Best meme I have seen today haha.
---
It's not just you. I just fired up my game, thought it was just me. Maybe it's a server issue? I'm on ps4 for refference.
---
It just seems like you have some ego problems
---
Survivors are just skins, if you want a purely cosmetic advantage play P3 claudette
---
Billy
---
Noob3 getting tunneled by pig for 20 mins on badham, whole time claudette teammate didnt finish the last gen or something
---
How I feel when I get the Huntress hatchet challenge and manage to complete it in one match with 1 or 2 kills.
---
I actually haven't played in a while, I was actually responding to a post about suggestions to make the game more balanced for Killers. The poster said something really dumb stuff like how if a chase lasts longer than two minutes the killer should get an insta down.
---
I am not trying to be ignorant.
---
I can play shooter without any problems regarding hitboxes. Games such as Counter Strike, Battlefield and Call of Duty are shooters, and I personally do not experience any problems with the hitboxes? Of course, once in a while you might get someone with a shot where you think that it should not have landed, but I must point out that all these shooters do not have the same amount of consistent hitbox faults, like in Dead by Daylight where almost every single match is going to have hits not connecting, but does connect anyways.
---
My intentions are not to attack you, but I still feel like I have to defend myself with your comments, so this will be my last one to you. Again I thank you for your time and patience and helping me understand the situation more.
---
It's going to be solved with dedicated servers. They've already announced it. We just need to be patient
---
yeah for sure
---
&gt;So sad getting salty at a survivor for trying to play the game and not giving up
---
&gt;in a post where you're salty about them just killing you in a game where their goal is to kill you
---
Alright mate. It's time to stop.
---
People say that cause while they may want to give you hatch they arent going to chase you all over the map while you constantly wiggle out to do it. They want the game to end.
---
Also you come across as a whiny baby tbh
---
Try using that in solo que, every time the survivor fucking sprint bursts away, hell, one time, the survivor refused to let me heal and decided to open a fucking chest that was next to the hook, and the killer was coming back too
---
I'll only face camp if I've been looped by somebody for literally the whole game or somebody is t bagging me all the way through the chase. Mostly the second one, that starts the nodding too. But even then I often get bored, it's so *unsatisfying* to play like that
---
Exactly and even your strongest stuff can be nerfed on the right map. Scratched mirror myers on a corn map against a skilled swf can be pretty useless
---
Your comment is very lacking, please enlighten me, if you feel like this is not a problem that should be fixed regardless if it is the hitboxes or internet connection. Thank you for commenting.
---
Oh my god I once got so mad at a group of survivors because this happened to me. Guess I'll have to apologise to them now
---
And don‚Äôt you dare touch his chest
---
It's completely true being that regardless each side has a perspective on one another that will always cause a dispute to where they sometimes become toxic on the next match then the cycle continues.
---
It's always fun when survivors whine and fail to address both sides. You could just as easily replace this with "gen rush and endless loop" - it's the game, man. If people are going to gen rush, I'll start running noed just to punish them.
---
That based on previous experience? I'm trying to time my stream to coincide with release otherwise I'll be spend 4 hours doing bugger all =P
---
I wish this happened more often tbh. I get great joy from relentlessly killing my friends üòÇ
---
I've gotten tunneled and camped like crazy these past couple days, and I don't think I've ever seen so many killers DC lol. It's been like every couple matches
---
Absolutely, getting frustrated over things that are out of your control is totally understandable. But in the same time it helps settle some down because it gives them peace knowing they couldn't do anything about it, and loss was inevitable.
---
&gt;I rarely find decent killers that really play for fun and not for BP
---
I play for fun. The fact the BP rewards are given for doing tasks in the game means i have fun AND earn BP. In fact, playing the game normally will earn you a ton of BP. Playing the game to win (which is also the point of a game????) will earn you plenty of BP. 
---
You're just another whiny survivor. You're just salty about, i dunno, dying i guess?
---
No reason the survivors should get to decide who the killer chases.
---
For sure.
---
When a survivor is downed, you may have the option the place them in a cocoon instead of picking them up. Survivors in a cocoon cannot be interacted with by any player for 45 seconds. When a survivor exits a cocoon, they are healed 1 health state.
---
All survivors suffer from a list of the following effects when a teammate is in a cocoon, depending on the offering burnt:
---
*Common: Haemorrhage (if injured)*
---
*Common: Mangled (if injured)*
---
*Uncommon: Exhausted*
---
*Uncommon: Blindness*
---
*Rare: Hindered*
---
*Rare: Deep Wound (if injured)*
---
*Very Rare: Broken*
---
*Ultra Rare: Exposed*
---
You may also burn the get the following buffs from offerings:
---
*-Longer Cucoon timer*
---
*-The ability to take survivors out of the cuccoon*
---
*Disallowing survivors to heal when released from the cuccoon*
---
Like chill until he comes out then we all can bitch
---
 This page is so ragey about killer related shit.
---
Pebble of course
---
It's not really complaining about being killed, obviously that's going to happen in the game. I don't expect to survive every match. It just sucks when you get downed the second you get off the hook. You can barely play the game because of either camping or tunneling
---
If you have AMD there's Radeon Relive as well
---
to the jake I saw, wearing the neon outfit and a cowboy hat, sprinting across the map and juking the billy: I laughed so hard I nearly passed out. ride off into the sunset you beautiful man
---
Yeah it is a problem I never said it wasn‚Äôt I completely agree as it makes the game unfair in that aspect as you almost feel cheated when something that doesn‚Äôt look like should happen, happens. It should always have been dedicated servers especially for a game as intense as this can be.
---
Had this guy today who was upset that I dodged his 4-man SWF lobby about a month ago. I blocked him on the day since he was sending me nasty messages (PS4), and today I‚Äôd dodged him a couple times as surv because I knew he was the petty type. So this guy straight up goes offline (when you do this, your name is hidden in the lobby) so that I will stay in the lobby. Double bloodpoints, 2x BPS and 2 cakes didn‚Äôt stop him from ignoring literally everybody else and tunnelling me to death (even after DS, MoM, running past multiple survivors actively working on gens, and despite each of the four chases lasting several minutes apart from the one where I realised what he was doing and wanted my 5k points for DS). Also BMd me for good measure I guess. Was down to 1 gen left by the time he killed me, everybody else escaped. Still got around 50k points out of it at least.
---
I ask again.
---
Turn down resolution scaling
---
It‚Äôs not bullshit it‚Äôs how it‚Äôs intended üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I mean there's another survivor right there.. i'd stick around for a bit too.
---
Maybe don't get caught? :^)
---
Cause it takes a lot to work to make artwork and ghostface is new and not an original character there is not that much inspiration there
---
"Gen rushing"
---
yeah, for killer-mains who still think they are underpowered. Don't worry, it looks like the dev are on the killers' side so they'll get more buffed. Just say the magic word "SWF is too OP".
---
Exactly, my last game consisted of a four man group running green toolboxes and all the extra speed add-ons. It‚Äôs only camping and tunneling that gets complained about during bloodpoints but people still insist this is a killer-sided subreddit
---
I gotta solution for you OP just dont wiggle.
---
Doing the gens above anything else, gen rushing can really get the survivors killed if they refuse to save over doing gens
---
The point is we all wanna make points, so dont be a fuck boy and tunnel people off the hook go find someone new.. it's rather a simple concept that killer mains cant grasp I suppose...
---
They don't have to be meta RIGHT NOW, since 2 of them are non-teachables. When Ghostface is released, everyone will have access to Spine Chill and Premonition so he will very easily see 2 or more people running them every game. And as for having counters, he still has to actually catch you. So if you end up on Autohaven or Lery's and get caught, I don't think Ghostface was the problem. And on The Game, he won't be able to stalk you if you're paying any attention given that his only line of sight on you would be literally through a large doorway where you could see him EASILY. His best map is Coldwind Farms (Cornwind) due to the massive ass deadzone in the corn.
---
BHVR has to stop walking on eggshells around survivors and release more good killers. Ghostface is powerful, but he's definitely not the strongest, I don't see them whining to remove Nurse or Billy
---
Hey is the game good? I've seen it on gamepass so
---
üòä
---
yeah you should prestige. I already have urban evasion on my Claudette, and I  was Prestige 3 when I got it. Urban evasion popped up instantly in my bloodweb as soon as I got Nea's teachable.
---
Double bloodpoints brings out all the idiots who still play like this
---
It especially sucks on double bloodpoints because is screws everyone out of bloodpoints at a time when the grind is supposed to be lessened
---
No one said anything was toxic, they're talking about a huntress going all out during bloodhunt
---
You god killed. Gg
---
Unless it‚Äôs a KYF, lobbies are hosted by the Killer. IE they have 0 ping. So hitboxes from Killer PoV seem fine. Survivors are left with all the lag.
---
This is why you don't farm
---
Thats good news, you are right then. We just have to wait. Thanks for informing.
---
Why you waiting an hour to play? I'd just go play a different game lmao.
---
Monitor is useless on Doctor. Best build has to be Distressing, Unnerving Presence, Overcharge and  then something else (maybe pop goes the weasel). Calm addons work best with this. ;)
---
Killer queues take long as it is and with double bloodpoints queues are even longer. Ive given up on trying to play killer during this event
---
&gt;It's going to be solved with dedicated servers. They've already announced it. We just need to be patient
---
This is not going to be solved with dedicated servers... not for everybody at least. It will depend on how close you live to your regional server.
---
When they tested dedicated servers my ping was 90ms which means I will still see a lot of hits that looked like it shouldn't connect. 
---
Dedicated servers will fix, for the most part (leaving some grounds for DDoS and hamster servers), lag spikes mid match caused by the killer's internet. If the killer starts downloading porn mid match, you won't feel anything. 
---
In my case with 90ms, if I try to juke a hatchet in the last split second, it will hit me no matter if the distance looked like it was enough.
---
Oh man, i was almost as scared by sudden Michael here as in the game
---
&gt; I rarely find decent killers that really play for fun and not for BP. 
---
The killer you just described probably got way less points running his gimmicky slug build than he would've if he hooked you all multiple times. It sounds to me like they were playing for fun and not bloodpoints.
---
Now, is that really frustrating for the survivors? Yes, I hate getting slugged. But is it a real strategy? Yes. Don't hate on your opponents for not playing the way you want them to play.
---
Why do people say this? No it doesn't. It's the Same exact level of that, maybe it's happening in the low ranks but I'm not experiencing this
---
On ps4 as well can't find any games!
---
Happy cake day!
---
People tend to let me heal them when they see the Well Make it pop up
---
i would use this as an icon replacement for Blood warden, Because its the real Gottem perk we all know and meme
---
The most cancerous thing in existence. ;)
---
It is very annoying being camped and tunneled, I do agree. On PS4 if you even look at a killer wrong they‚Äôre on your ass until you die.
---
@ [**cheraidsII**](https://new.reddit.com/user/cheraidsII/) 
---
Talk to him. He downloaded some play doh graphics from the internet to have better fps, he might be able to help you out with it as well.
---
You must be on the desktop site, in the right sidebar there‚Äòs a link ‚ÄûEnable Hex: Memeless Mode‚Äú, just above the current shrine of secrets. It still works, I use it.
---
I'm not denying that survivors can't be extremely toxic as well. I play both killer and survivor and have seen both sides be like that. Just that so far on double bp I've seen more tunneling killers than endlessly looping survivors
---
Maybe it's because the double bp event brings in more players playing the game, like players who don't usually play, and who are usually bad at the game
---
When discordance is activated the whole game and everyone runs toolboxes in the event, it gets ridiculous. I agree that complaining about gen rushing seems silly, but the game definitely needs an unignorable, second objective other than gates. 
---
Trying to get out the game ASAP with items and ignoring injured teammates, totems and the like is frustrating to deal with as a killer in the event because less time is less points for everyone. Equally annoying to get hit off the hook and then moried
---
So many dislike comments wtf? I think this was pretty funny.
---
all the survivors are just reskins, however you wanna level up Meg, Nea and David King up to 40/30/35 respectively, you get Adrenaline, BL and WGLF out of that which are arguably the 3 best survivor perks as well as Dead Hard which is fun to use.
---
I find this very hard to believe. Unless you only get 1 kill per match. ;)
---
&gt;You're just salty about, i dunno, dying i guess?
---
For not having a fun game. Like after several seconds of juking the nurse killer then made a single mistake, I'm lying on the ground the whole time. Solo queued so teammates are having a hard time finding me. The whole game is like everything are for the killer, we were put there just for him to earn BP. And what we've got? Yeah, I've got 30,000BP because of 2x BP, 2 put bloody streamer, and I put a cake. Aside from that, everyone is lying down for the whole time and can't do anything.
---
We're talking about old DS. New DS is fair and balanced.
---
When you gotta prestige before bloodhunt ends.
---
It was a dead meme months ago lol
---
At least in my opinion.
---
Imagine Chidi as the survivor and running into the six locker spot. Killer wouldn't even need to hurt him.
---
People won‚Äôt make spine chill meta just because GF comes out. Lol. 
---
Every killer has to catch you...? That‚Äôs not a counter. 
---
You can‚Äôt stalk through the corn at a certain distance. And since actually catching you is a ‚Äúcounter‚Äù, all coldwind farms maps counter him.
---
That was also old Dedicated. They're improving it. If it reaches a point like Overwatches then there wont be issues unless the lag is your internet issues.
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Gotta be Iri head and Infantry belt to really annoy the salty survivors. ;)
---
survivors are just skins, their perks is what makes them different to each other but i can say that Ace and Claudette are in advantage 'cause Claudette just blend in almost everything, being easier for you to hide and Ace's groans are so quiet that you don't even need Iron Will
---
I'm sorry but no, that's so fucking stupid, it's not a game if "everyone wins!!" There needs to be conflict between survivors and killer, what you're suggesting is just farming, fuck farming, I actually want to play the damn video game. There's a reason why people don't consider pipping/bloodpoints to be winning, because both survivors and killers can do it in games, and two sides can't win in the same match, that's just not how games work.
---
And the plot twist is: I‚Äôm a survivor main... so they can all put down their pitchforks lmao
---
Chidi and Dwight would make good friends.
---
Totem spots aren‚Äôt random and you can actually learn them.
---
I don't know 'that' gag build. Maybe you should tell us about this gag build, and don't forget to name the killer you used.
---
It wasnt this week but I had a really fun game as a doctor. I was looking for last survivor and using the other one to hunt him down. Had static up and kept the other one in Madness 3 as I followed him around. (I'm sorry to that one I must had fried his brain) but he didnt do anything to sabotage the last one. Finally decided to check basement (idiot me) and there was the last one hiding waiting for hatch. I felt so bad that I dragged them to the generators and then to the exit gates, gave the last one hatch for being good sports. Thnx guys!
---
Yeah I'm on ps4 too. If it's not due to the bloodpoints it might just be a problem with the severs.
---
ü§°ü§°ü§° Campers
---
That build might maybe have worked if it was the older ranked system but yea, it looked like she really hated you guys if she went full red lol.
---
I dont know man. He kinda seems very difficult to spot rn
---
[Id recognize a meme I made anywhere!](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7y8wm7/when_a_pig_walks_up_to_you_and_you_think_its_just/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
sometimes some killers mori glitches out
---
Half of these examples arent even problems. 
---
Hatchet hitboxess meant to be large.
---
Most wierd hits happen because p2p connection is not a perfect solution. (Neither is the standard server solution)
---
Occasionally animation doesnt match the hitbox (this happens the most with smaller weapons) but these hitboxes are always the same so an expirianced player knows what hits and what doesnt regardless of the animation. And on top of all that bhvr said they gonna stretch animations to fit the hitboxes.
---
Honestly blaming hitboxes is just another way to bullshit yourself
---
Then a killer becomes a douche and mori you straight away
---
the basement hooks can't be broken, there are four of them, and it is extremely difficult to save someone if you are proxying. Often times they trade for someone else getting hooked down there, than another, giving a few easy hooks that they have to either give you, or sacrifice a teammate for
---
As opposed to getting salty and ranting on Reddit? It's not a power Trip. It's the killer trying to give you a nice gesture and you making it difficult for them. Personally, if I walk passed 5 hooks, quit wiggling. I'm obviously giving you the hook because I thought you were new to the game by how horribly you played.
---
Why would this be an unpopular opinion? I think I have the unpopular opinion: instead of punishing the killer for camping, reward the survivor for being camped. Or act like it's a chase where you get partial creddit when a generator is completed or a totem is cleansed.
---
Little do we know, Rin actually framed her father for the murder and he fought back in self defence..
---
It‚Äôll be revealed in a future lore dump, I swear
---
Got 230+ with Billy. Doesn't matter what killer you play as long as you max out everything
---
Completely agree. Meant to have fun and enjoy the game and have high blood pressure whilst playing.
---
Kk ty
---
Lots of black wards. Have fun.
---
Just don‚Äôt wiggle if you‚Äôre options are hatch or hook. Too many survivors wiggle free while trying to *give* them an escape just to prolong the game with a pointless chase. It‚Äôs honestly not worth the effort if you try to wiggle away. I lose points and my time for trying to be nice to you, so if you are trying to wiggle (the mechanic to escape), why should I even bother?
---
Just so you know, entitled little survivor noob gamers like you are the reason I don‚Äôt even bother with giving the hatch anymore.
---
Freddy has no anti-looping tools, only tracking. It‚Äôs incredible easy to at least 3 man escape if the team knows how to loop. Which is why he‚Äôs a noobstomper at lower ranks
---
Hell yeah
---
Watch out guys, we got a megamind here.
---
Dude, it has happened to me, and let me tell you, it feels like crap. Of course I was looking away from the hook and a little bit further, since my keyboard died when I was running to get someone else (bbq and chilli)
---
I have Accepted this fact long ago before i even played this game
---
This is beautiful.
---
This probably because the people who are looking for others to play swf with are immense try hards, and aren't really doing it to play with others, but to try as hard as possible
---
This is why I don't burn any double offerings during events.
---
this is amazing, you did a great job with detailing, love this!
---
Hitboxes? You mean ping right, because you do know this whole "hitbox" meme is just bad ping
---
Right now the only way to get a penalty is to disconnect from games VERY often. 
---
With dedicated servers, DC'ing will be a thing of the past.
---
you sound pretty whiny its a game its supposed to be harder. The killers get gen rushed constantly with 3 gens popping like back to back so fast while they have to chase someone looping dont complain about game mechanics because you suck and are low rank with the inexperience to play the game right
---
To be fair, it‚Äôs very hard from a survivor‚Äôs point of view to know if the killer wants to farm or no, unless obviously they message you, since they‚Äôre the ones that dictate how a match can go. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but you‚Äôll always have those people ruining the fun for others regardless of double bp events :/ In the end it‚Äôs just a game and we should all try to have fun
---
Just do what I do. Click on the 3 dots to the side of the post, click on Block User, click the 3 dots again and choose Hide Post. I do this every time someone posts stupid memes or those stupid "My tier list" shits.
---
How do dedicated servers work like that?
---
Seems they're all leaving
---
I think the very opposite, take away the camping penalty and instead give the survivor a "being camped" reward.
---
And then if you play:
---
Surv: Killer either mori you straight away / camp / tunnel or dc
---
Killer: Survs die on first hook or dc
---
I love this community
---
Right, well, it‚Äôs a little incorrect to call Amanda a horror icon. Jigsaw himself, sure, but Amanda is nowhere near the level of fame as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger or Ghostface.
---
Not all of us killer mains are toxic assholes.
---
Great! Now they know where where it is.
---
Too bad it's desktop only.
---
Same here, hadn't played in a while, still had my old Laurie build. I like the change, I rarely get juggled now
---
As someone who has done this, I can tell you sometimes it's a good strategy and it has paid off for me from time to time.
---
Of course I try this when said player is too much problem to be left alive (object of obsession in a coordinated SWF team) or when I assume survivors will crouch around trying to save the hooked one and won't do anything in the mean time and they prove me right.
---
Now it might sound like lacks of skills to you, but in the end it takes skills to know when it is a viable strategy or when you should leave and hunt the others.
---
*It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times*
---
I know I know, just wanted to try to spread a message for us all to give a middle finger to the Grind.  I'll occasionally try to indicate to farm with a Survivor, most don't, which is fine. Only had 3 farm games since the event started, which Im  happy for, just like something less serious/sweaty esp when it benefits us all
---
Several people noted that camping was entirely absent from both my previous 5 Tips For Killers guide and 5 Tips For Survivors guide. I finally got around to putting together some tips for survivors about what to do when someone is getting camped. Really though, your best bet is to repair generators. There's really not much you can do against a camping, chainsaw-revved Leatherface in the basement.
---
I do call it a low risk / low reward strategy, as despite how annoying and unfun it is to play against, it still works against newer players. Ideally, if the killer is camping, you want to make sure he doesn't get more than a single kill.
---
And combinations
---
A Scrub is a player of a competitive video game who adamantly believes that their "house rules" should apply to everyone to promote their view of "fair play". If a scrub sees a move or strategy they don't like (or can't beat), they ban it (if only in their own mind), and complains that anyone who uses it is cheap.
---
The video game is what it is. It defines what you can do and what you can't do. In competitive games, the rules exist as written into the game world. Sometimes, this leads to an over-powered character. Sometimes, it leads to a Game-Breaker.
---
Some competitive video game players accept that some characters/races/etc. are more powerful than others. When they're being competitive, they play one of the characters/races that are on the top tier and ignore the rest.
---
Some people do not hold to this. They develop house rules designed to bring what they feel is a game imbalance back into balance, so that there is more variety (after all, if a game has 20 characters, but you would clearly win only using two of them, then those 18 other characters are not worth playing). Essentially, a self-made game patch. This is all well and good. A classic gaming example of this is the ultra-common "No Oddjob Rule" in Goldeneye, often put in place because Oddjob is a Game-Breaker due to his size.
---
However, this self-limiting with house rules can go too far. When it does, you have the Scrub. The mistake the Scrub often makes is making up rules too soon. The Metagame can often turn an apparent imbalance on its head. A lower tier character can become a higher tier one, or vice versa. Or something that seemed initially very unbalanced can be countered with time and effort at learning the tactic. Alternately, with the advent of patching, more modern titles may rebalance the game so that the former Game Breakers aren't as unbeatable as they used to be. The Scrub circumvents this by simply banning something without making a good faith effort in actually getting around it with the in-game rules. The Scrub will often consider the tactics that he bans "Game Breakers". However, what constitutes a Game Breaker varies from person to person. Within a particular skill level, a game can be broken in that a simple repetitive tactic can lead to success. A more skilled player could stop it, but if it requires a great deal more skill to stop the tactic than to perform it, then it can easily appear to be a Game-Breaker. Not that it matters; even if the "offending" player changes to a different strategy and wins again, the new strategy is also "broken".
---
What ultimately makes the Scrub undesirable isn't the rulesetting; it is the attitude. Players will often agree to refrain from using certain moves or from selecting certain characters so they can have fun without investing a lot of time into learning the game. The Scrub, on the other hand, believes that his way is the only proper way to play the game and refuses to acknowledge that the game could be more fun any other way.
---
Scrubs may also put down others who use certain characters/teams/etc. for simply using them like everyone else is using in order to win. In other words, they don't like it when people use something that everyone else is since it's not "original" and will even go as far as accusing these people at sucking at the game for not using anyone or anything besides the top tiers. In Collectible Card Games, this is often referred to as "net decking" because they believe the player took their deck idea from a successful deck they found on the internet.
---
Compare and contrast with "Stop Having Fun" Guys, who are at least as annoying as the Scrub. The Scrub is the antithesis of the "Stop Having Fun" Guy, although one could argue that the two are very similar ‚Äî "Stop Having Fun" Guys demand that everyone use the most efficient and powerful choices (with failure to do so considered "inferiority"), while Scrubs insist that everyone follow their personal house rules (with failure to do so considered "cheating"). Both make the mistake of taking things very seriously, both are more than willing to start a Flame War rather than let another kind of player exist in peace, and both are eager to argue with anyone who doesn't agree with their style of play.
---
Scrubs are often the result of Min-Maxing / Whoring. When a player sacrifices certain skills they deem useless in order to bolster skills they deem superior, they usually aren't happy when another player has a build meant to exploit their weaknesses. These scrubs will often argue that whatever mechanic they are choosing to ignore isn't part of "the real game," and that it should be removed.
---
Combined with the Noob, a scrub can quickly turn into a God Modder, who actually does cheat or abuses glitches to the extreme, but still considers his tactics to be fair. And then there's the "tryhard", a low-level player with a scrub-like mentality who fancies themselves a high-level player, and tries to adopt high-level tactics even though they have no idea how to actually pull them off. Also note that because all of these labels are "bad", most people do not consider themselves to be any of them‚Äîsomeone who fits the description of "Scrub" will just think they're normal while accusing any opposition of being "tryhards" and "SHFG"s, or any such combination thereof.
---
On the other hand, the term "scrub" can be used by players to indiscriminately insult players they deem unworthy, or simply players they don't like. The word "scrub" gets thrown around so much in the World of Warcraft community that it has lost its original meaning. (Although in reality, the meaning of "scrub" to simply mean "incompetent" came first, and using the term Scrub as a trope to define the mentality as David Sirlin did came later.)

No no I've played so many matches that I look like Charlie pointing at his pepe Silvia evidence board that I know which killers to expect NoED on, MICHAEL AND FREDDY ALWAYS HAVE NOED, also Pig Wraith Trapper Huntress  Leatherface Spirit have a 64% chance to have it and Legion and Billy have a 38% chance to have it. ALWAYS ASSUME THEY HAVE NOED, It peers at you from the fog EVERY match, IT LINGERS!
---
Yup. BHVR tend to release new DLCs, patches and cosmetics at 11:30 EST (16:30 BST)
---
Probably After tbacging and farming
---
I usually keep it together, but when I have a stretch of bad and unfun games I can get a little salty.
---
oh god yes 2016 the good ol days of grinding for so long and getting that feeling of accomplishment
---
But us killers win if we get 1 or 4 hooks.  
---
Idk how other killers feel like they lose
---
I don‚Äôt think it needs to be related to saw I think bvhr finally got a thumbs up to go wild with whatever designs they want to do. But we‚Äôll see in the mere future.
---
There's a few different outfits in the saw movies, but maybe not always worn by Amanda.
---
Wow, a killer used noed, thank you for sharing this incredibly entertaining clip that definitely was clip worthy and something absolutely everyone needed to see.
---
&gt;Sprint Burst? Balanced Landing? Alert? Sabotaging hooks? Struggling? Dance With Me? Lithe? Dead Hard? Decisive Strike? Deliverance? Diversion? Flip-Flop? Iron Will? Lightweight? Poised? Premonition? Quick &amp; Quiet? Slippery Meat? Spine Chill? Unbreakable? Pallets? Windows?
---
Yeah man, when you are on the hook getting facecamped my 20 perks I picked for the trial sure will help me.
---
&gt;Needing to be caught 3 times before you die?
---
Not when you are getting facecamped.
---
&gt;Using a flashlight the Killer can't avoid if the Survivor decides to drop somewhere without a wall?
---
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
---
&gt;Faking a save, taking a hit and another Survivor gets you off the hook?
---
Not adviced to go for a save when someone is getting facecamped. It's only good for hook exchange so again, not good against face campers.
---
You know, asking devs to fix this is pretty much saying players are pretty much useless. Go and do gens and killer will be left feeling like a fool if everybody else escapes.
---
But as long as survivors reward this kind of behaviour, I don't think Devs should do anything about it. Hell, they should remove the penalty for staying close. That punishment should be given by the survivors.
---
It's Hoffman's isn't it?
---
Well I've had a ruin almost every single match fue to rank reset so
---
I  Janet just a thiccer jane?
---
She doesn't have enough of a map presence to be top 3 as well as not being able to shut down loops like Spirit and Billy.
---

BTW where you dissing his flygirl?

---
I mean, you‚Äôre not wrong.
---
On PTB right now, Ghostface can stalk through corn. And since capturing you is a counter, it would be ridiculously easy to do so if someone gets caught out in the corn. The massive deadzone. Without pallets or windows. Yeah. So not sure how you think corn maps are bad for him. Also, if you want Ghostface to have counters, maybe you should look at the other killers for being op. Because you think "don't get caught" isn't a counter, then Billy, Huntress, and Hag are all broken since their only counters are "dodge their shit". Oh, but wait, does that mean Trapper is broken too, since "avoiding his traps" isn't a real counter? News flash, if looping is not a counter, then there is no counter to killers since they can only be looped. But, since looping is a counter, as literally every player of this game knows, then Ghostface is perfectly fine since he can still get looped for 40 seconds as long as the survivor has more of a brain than you do.
---
compared to the usual 5 seconds...
---
I dont think you play killer... At all, lol. Sure, killer is ez enuff at ranks 15 and below, but when survivors get their perks, killer perks in comparison are garbage in terms of scaling. The only good one is ruin, and even then, it can be destroyed
---
She wears that outfit when she fights detective Matthews in saw 3 right?
---
Run thantphobia, no need to run sloppy or the clown perk that slows down healing.
---
Ruin is pretty solid
---
Your infrectious fright is amazing and i love the perk.
---
In saw 3 she has a flashback and she was wearing a leather jacket
---
lol i was thinking that watching the video. for what its worth I think i was picking my nose when I fell down the hole and the missed swing was me seeing if i could go for a grab
---
Nice! Did you maybe already notice something? :) Could be just my luck of course because I faced maybe 5 Pigs or so
---
hatch. Your strategy is hatch
---
I thought it was something along there lines:
---
3 states:
---
-awake: freddy can't hurt you
---
-half sleep: freddy can hurt you and you see him only if he comes close to you
---
-full sleep: freddy can hurt you and you can see him from any distance
---
There were some extra effects associated with different states
---
Losing all points.
---
I don't know if it gives you any penalty as killer/survivor, though.
---
Technically the truth
---
Its entirely reasonable to see games like this played for real. It takes some work as killer and survivor but I just got out of a few games with score boards like this.
---
You can still do it but yeah its nigh on impossible, left behind has alwasy been a bottom bottom tier perk though its needed changing since it came out
---
‚ÄúOh boy, here I go killing again!‚Äù
---
More like: I know what you ate last summer
---
So a killer can't have a power to try and end loops? Literally what's wrong w9t a timer that is preventable by LOOKING at him. People would have been happy if he stayed shit so he would be loopable
---
They lose bloodpoints thats it
---
Wow, thats a free win and a half
---
It's still possible but you need a perfect storm. All folks need to be dead except you, the killer has to be a blind boi who cant find hatch, and there needs to be a gen close to you that's decently repaired. After that you have to pray that you can open a gate.
---
I dont see why you would bother, its always gonna be RNG it means nothing to get stats
---
I love how the current extremes are help us farm up 30+k points or camp our brains out. Some killers just play the game without farming and if you are decent you can still get plenty of points. If the killer is at all intelligent they wont tunnel either but it gets to a point where it isnt the killers fault. If you are the only one consistently showing up in front of the killer then you need to up your immersion game.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs good.
---
Based on him, but it has breasts it‚Äôs still Amanda.
---
It‚Äôs probably based on Hoffman.
---
Idk, it's not really a tier list because some characters should be switched around
---
Left for dead is a game that you kill zombies.
---
Real answer yes the perks are useless and usually always have been quite useless. They need a rework and always have needed a rework. Which it would be great if the devs spent sometime going back and fixing perks that are just bad. 
---
But I like the devs of this game I‚Äôm sure they will at some point they seem to be getting more on track lately.
---
I was the toolbox
---
Being low or high rank doesn‚Äôt change the fact that survivors can‚Äôt communicate with each other except in T-bags and 2 emotes
---
problem is that they use it even when someone come to save them.
---
here is just something off here, where are his porn mags?
---
And Switcherino of course. Come on the whole game was butter smooth except that shot.
---
Two of my favourite things combined, dbd &amp; the good place
---
Soooo bunny pig when?
---
Surprise, Bubba was waiting for ya
---
Right now if the killer lag switches he might cause some survivors to DC. Currently, with player to player connection it is hard to tell what happened so devs don't want to be too harsh on us. With dedicated servers it will be impossible to dc because of the killer so there should be no false positives and hence harsher penalties for leaving.
---
the fuck guys...
---
Double blood points!
---
Yeah so this conversation is over if you genuinely think a real counter is having to catch someone. This is a counter: Flashlighting hag traps. 
---
Also there‚Äôs only one cornfield map with a massive dead zone and that‚Äôs rotten fields, so yes, coldwind farms are still terrible. 
---
I won‚Äôt be reading your next response so don‚Äôt bother. You‚Äôre a bonehead.
---
"Can't insult something you don't have."
---
Wow! A dickless twat masquerading as a 3 year old! I've never seen one of those on Reddit before! /s
---
Meanwhile, actively abusing infinite loops is toxic as the killer cannot capture you. And camping as a strategy works if you see multiple idiots diving the hook since you are pressuring 3 free people by guarding this one hook. Additionally, camping was mostly the only option since catching survivors was a chore and a half with the broken shit they got to abuse. Abuse as in keep using over and over knowing full well that it wasn't fair for a killer to contest them since it would lose pressure on generators. Oh but that's fine. The killer will just abandon this chase and go after a different survivor at a different infinite loop, also using pallet vacuums with double pallets, and not having to fear bloodlust. I get why you're mad. I described a scenario where the game was 100% survivor sided and you're upset that you have a version that is SLIGHTLY more balanced, requiring survivors to actually be good at looping. It's ok. Maybe BHVR will fuck up again and make your side of the game completely brainless again so that even you can succeed.
---
Fuck this sub for letting this shit stay. Mods do you even do anything anymore?
---
99.9%?
---
Yeah they dont get hook event scoring and it makes killers de pip.
---
I mean I rather have a deactivated reverse bear trap on Amanda‚Äôs head the whole time.
---
And then they crouch around your hook waiting all the way until you're sacrificed
---

---
Works both ways, insta heals and brand new parts.
---
*It's cursed I tells ya*
---
I would be pretty displeased if I had to do your job for you too.
---
It's been really easy for me to not get mad about "losing" since I realized that all I actually care about are pips for ranking. Doesn't matter if I live or die, it's all about those pips or at least saving a pip.
---
what noise would you expect?
---
I played her for a daily and got a 4k. I was like " Am I a nurse god" Played her again the next game. Turns out no, the first game was potatoes, i am not a nurse god.
---
BPS is cursed whenever events come in
---
Hey look 9 more shack loops!
---
They arent there for the killers to not hit you, they are there for the killer not to walk in a straight line towards you.
---
And you avoid the more important half of what I said.  
---
&gt;I'm not saying Survivors are obliterating Killers in terms of strength nor whether/which side is stronger, but give me a break with "guarantee you die". Unless your teammates are working against you and you pull your own weight, Survivors are always easier.
---
I fucking love this show
---
It‚Äôs only toxic when killers do it (tunnelling)
---
*I'm gonna touch it*
---
Ieearan if he needed a kill he needed one so idk what to say
---
It's not a good game unless everyone has tophats, fresh tea, and a riveting discussion about the current economical climate
---
You‚Äôre doing ~~God‚Äôs~~ the Entity‚Äôs work, on behalf of the newbies helped by the guide - thank you 
---
&gt; call it a low risk / low reward strategy 
---
I‚Äôm stealing that; the perfect way to describe camping
---
Should‚Äôve heard him from a survivor standpoint. It was incredible.
---
It's a bug right now, you gotta keep trying and it will work eventually
---
This is kyf dude
---
RIP xD
---
Nothing really but maybe a few painful like sighs would fit him not growling tho
---
When you dead hard on console and the game just ignores the command, but your character rattles on the ground after getting hit so you know it was a lag issue.
---
true, but the growling might be anger about his situation
---
Sounds like the majority needs to get better.
---
Definitely he didn't deserve what happened to him so.if I was him i wouldn't be very happy either
---
Lol, using the word sweetheart just made you lose all credibility.
---
ye
---
This is false, wherever you read it. I ‚Äúsearch for game‚Äù for at least 5 minutes before I get put into a lobby and I‚Äôm alone. The game doesn‚Äôt wait for survivors to start a lobby up.
---
i  had borrowed, lithe, dance with me, self care lol
---
Black wards and luck. I had 3/4 dead on my first try and the last person just stayed in a locker. I messaged them and begged and thankfully they let me kill them. I got super lucky though.
---
It's a common bug of that specific place of this map. It happened to me a couple of time too in the exact same place and there are also some videos (posted by other players in the past) where happen the same thing.
---
Bottom text
---
Boi I literally looked the buff after this and if I was after karma i would get shit ton more karma from any other subreddit than this like r/dankmemes
---
You seem like you'd be a blast at parties.
---
All the time! But I do hear a lot of people get super hateful messages. Sad that we can‚Äôt just enjoy gaming together.
---
Wait you get off hooks? I had 5/6 matches last night where I was one hooked. No bother though, won‚Äôt be seeing those killers in high ranks.
---
I think that may be a little too OP, only because I feel like it‚Äôll never be done exactly right, and some decent killers might get fucked. 
---
I think the amount of time offered to remaining survivors should suffice, personally; there are already multiple perks that speed up gen progression, and that would just add onto the punishment to the Killer.
---
I put distressing and unnerving presence on whenever I play doctor no matter what, usually I replace lullaby with ruin
---
One of my best friends is a Pig that I messaged after a game. We play at least once a week
---
My main is Hag
---
Perks-Hex:Ruin,BBQ&amp;Chili,Sloppy Butcher/Make Your Choice and Monitor&amp; Abuse
---
Add-ons-Rusty Shackles and Dried Cicada
---
Offerings-Anything that gives me more bloodpoints in Deviousness
---
If a Legion wants to tag me with his ability and then leave me immediately it doesn't bother me one bit.  I simply mend real quick, then go right back to plugging away on that gen.  I don't mind playing injured it isn't a big deal.  They still have to M1 me down.  Their ability is worthless for putting me in dying state.  Not a big deal.

---
I know, but that still doesn't make him op
---
This is why I always try having a spot for Kindred in my loadout. It's just such an underestimated perk! Sure if you dont get hooked for the entire game its a waste of a perk slot but damn the information it gives is just so useful especially when youre playing solo queue.

I disagree. Myers can stalk in chase, why not ghostface, seems counterintuitive especially after the buff.

I send positive messages often.  If you beat me in a well played competitive game you get a ggwp.  Nothing but love for a good killer that played an intense fun game.  Or a great survivor against my killer.

I love Janet ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Ok, not having Amanda there is actually insulting. Can we please arrest the guy who wrote this?
---
Just keep trying - 4 attempts might feel like a lot but it took me 15+ because of people disconnecting or staying in lockers to force me to grab them.
---
Just a tip, if someone is staying in a locker they will probably not struggle if you pull them out and start walking with them.  Find the nearest hill and dribble them a few times until their wiggle bar is almost full, then drop them off the side of the hill.  The fall will slow their escape and you may be able to catch them before they make it back to a locker.
---
The EGC has made this achievement even harder though, because they will always have a shot for hatch or a time limit if you close it.  Honestly you might just need to keep trying until you find a decent group of people.
---
Good luck!
---
Damn, is that what scrub means?
---
Would be better if they were green. That's only 25% each. Still cool that they all match though. Once all 4 survivors and the killer (me) used bloody party streamers, and it really was a feast of blood points.
---
I hope everyone has a great time playing ghostface
---
&gt; Tunneling/camping are encouraged in the games currently state
---
Quite the opposite actually (DS rework, emblem point penalty for camping...), although i must say Mettle of Man absolutely encourages tunneling/camping, only counter that perk has for M1 killers.
---
Looks kinda like older mayoi hachikuji
---
Only if something out of the ordinary happens. Otherwise a gg, or if it wasn't nothing.
---
But i just got out of game where i brought iridescent heads and infantry belts and only hooked each survivor twice. The rest of the game i was just running around and scared them off of gens, sometimes hitting them, sometimes leaving them on the floor.
---
Not one DC, gotta reward those troopers with letting them all escape.
---
Ghostface's lesser known brother: Toastface
---
I try to send positive messages all the time, this game and community can wear you down otherwise. Everyone deserves to hear some positivity once and a while.

I‚Äôm not gonna complain about non-canon  cosmetics.  We‚Äôve been limited to 2 for so long for the licensed folks - I‚Äôm appreciative that the Devs pursued the rights and are trying to give fans more options.
---
REEEEEEE
---
So far his mindgaming with removing the red stain at certain loops combined with how quick his stalk works makes him better than Myers. Wherever Myers is placed, Ghostface will be one spot ahead at the least.
---
Was this stolen from /Splatoon ?
---
Another braindead argument.
---
PS4 killers are a joke. If you spin them even once you can basically chalk the entire game if they get you down because you‚Äôre getting face camped 100% of the time.
---
This and the Caf√© Surfer Feng Min concepts are by far my favourites. i wish i could have both :(
---
I've been at rank 1 with both killer and survivor, I have no problem looping and I certainly don't complain about "genrushing". But you don't have to be high rank to figure out that, despite survivors supposedly being a team, they have no way of communicating with eachother.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I get you I‚Äôm just meaning when the killer camps at five/four gens. If you‚Äôre getting gen rushed, trying to take out the strongest survivor, have been bullied by a certain survivor, or the survivors swarm the hook right after you hook a person, then by all means camp or patrol. I understand when I run a killer around for a couple gens and then they camp me. I find it funny honestly. I don‚Äôt understand why some survivor mains get so salty when a killer vamps them after they bullied the shit out of them tbh. Just getting what they deserve. If it‚Äôs a baby killer doing this I‚Äôm a little more lenient with them but if they have over 800 hours in the game and they still have to camp to get one or two kills without the conditions we both stated, then they‚Äôre trash imo.
---
It always cracks me the fuck up the babykillers that tirelessly pop on to posts like these to defend camping lol.  At some point you clowns really should learn how to actually play this game.  It's so much more fun when you actually know what to do when playing killer and you don't have to camp.
---
Also fact:  The devs once said that a perfect balance is 2 dead 2 alive (though I'm not sure they still follow this philosophy with the new hatch mechanics, but that's another argument entirely).
---
Basically.. Not getting a 4k is not losing.  
---
Just like losing a couple men in your SWF crew is not losing.
---
Even when I die, i don't always feel like a loss as long as i lived long enough to do something.  I only get salty when the little shit camps and/or tunnels me off the hook 3 minutes into the game with 5 gens left (which sadly happens a LOT).
---
Oh. Whoops. I am are have the stupid.
---
I saw you comment this before
---
Ds rework just results in you being left on the ground for a minute, and the emblem penalty is rather small. Mettle of man encouraging tunneling is true, and rather understandable, but I was referring more to the killers who proxy camp but return to the hook immediately when a survivor is unhooked and farming them even as other survivors try to take hits. Yes it‚Äôs a legit strategy, and yes it is easy, but it is as toxic, if not more so than butt dancing in the exit gate or running DS &amp; borrowed time (ive seen a lot of complaints about that recently)
---
Brand new parts are so bad now they're a meme lol.  Insta heals are annoying but not worth camping over.  Only a soft ass babykiller camps over an item.
---
If you asked someone to do something for you but they didn't do it so you had to wouldn't you be displeased as well?
---
The entity wants killers to kill not wait for the entity to kill. XD
---
When I depip, I just laugh. Easier games for me.
---
Honestly, I think having an extra survivor would improve your odds a lot in Shelter Woods.
---
The idea of him is fine.However snapping him out of his power is inconsistent.
---
Yep, it'll stack, not multiply tho. So if you use bps during double BP weekend you'll get triple the amount, if someone else also uses bps you'll get 4x etc
---
You forgot DC after getting downed
---
They clearly aren't complaining about being killed.  There is a massive difference between complaining about a babykiller facecamping you to death and simply dying period.  If you can't see that difference it speaks volumes about your personal killer play.
---
I don't think it's (usually) salt. It's annoying to move as killer with the survivor struggling on your shoulder. If you want the hatch, don't make it harder for them to give it to you. Most people will choose the easier option.
---
For fucks sake lets make a test.
---
 Go stand next to a fence that is roughly 120cm tall, now try and reach over it. Unless you're one of the shortest people in the world, you should be able to reach over it. Now get yourself a kinfe and try swinging it over the fence. Voil√†, you should be able to reach at least a meter from the fence with a swing of your hand. Now imagine that hit was directed at a person, if they were hugging the fence, it would make sense they got hit.
---
As you can see, getting hit over these structures is perfectly intuitive for anyone with common sense
---
Thanks!
---
getting bloodpoints does not help you ranking up. It's specific actions that helps you to pip.
---
I get where you're coming from, but blood hunt doesn't mean the rules change. 
---
Sure, as a courtesy it's a nice thing to happen but people shouldn't feel bad for playing how they want. 
---
This is just another imaginary rule for this game where people get mad over if you didn't follow it. If the killer/survivors want to farm and not use pink items then great for them. But if a killer just wants to play like any other day in the year then survivors shouldn't get frustrated.
---
These made up rules create a lot of unnecessary hate and toxicity. It needs to stop. Play how you want and understand that just because you find something fun doesn't mean the other people find it fun.
---
is there an item pack too? :)
---
Hex: corrupt intervention is pretty important, gotta protect it
---
That looks like end game collapse to me.
---
What should the Huntress do? Piss off and go get teabagged at the exit while you get saved or something?
---
The killer has nothing else to do during EGC.
---
See, here's the problem.  Yeah other survivors can ignore the hooked one and do gens.
---
All facecamping killers care about is getting the points from sacrificing the survivor or simply ruining that survivor's game.  Nothing else.
---
Meanwhile the hooked survivor has two choices.
---
A.  Hold on for as long as possible to give other survivors more time to get gens.  (Boring as all fuck and a pure waste of time on their front)
---
B.  Try to wiggle out of the hook and let themselves die if they weren't lucky enough for the 4%.  (In which case the killer gets what they want and move on to the next target.  But at least the hooked survivor can go on to the next game and hopefully have a chance at enjoying it).
---
In the case of point B working out in the survivor's favor, the killer will be right there to pick him up again and toss him on the hook again.
---
Devs have to do something about that.
---
Camping is a horrible as far a BPS go, you get so much more when u hook and jet, got my second perfect game a few minutes ago, 8kbps all 4 categories,
---
If I get let go or a teamate makes a really risky save at endgame
---
I actually really love this
---
i‚Äôm usually selective with my messages because i don‚Äôt want my playstation message history to be full and unorganized but if i really liked how someone played and we were trying our best the whole game i‚Äôll shoot them a ggwp/nice job/etc win or lose
---
Killers create gen rushing by tunneling long chases they have no business being in.  And there is no such thing as endless looping anymore.  If that happens to you it's simply a series of mistakes you as a killer are making to allow that survivor to continue their chase.
---
He said yw and he felt bad cause all your friends were rage quitting cry babies.
---
i tried
---
it didn't work
---
Leatherface has to m1 an even half competant survivor
---
I know exactly what you mean, multiple times I've literally had less than 10 seconds into a game and the killer has already spotted me, or someone's being chased and then when the killer sees me they just decide that it would be better to go for me. 
---
Going through that as a solo survivor makes you good at looping but no gens get done since it's a solo game.
---
camping can be a stratigy at some times, if ypu have 2 people hooked near each other, then patroling can cause you to chase a 3rd person forcing the 4th to get them which then nobody is doing gens and you are chasing, or if there are 2 people and you hook one, unless you know where the otger one is patroling is the best idea, but face camping on first hook is a terrible idea
---
\&gt;totem counter  
---
you mean small game?
---
I was thinking more of them adding more tiles/pallets, overall try to fix the map
---
Same here!
---
What will the Freddy rework add to him?
---
Shitpost
---
Billy if you know how to properly time the saw.
---
Spirit if you are good at jukes and tracking.
---
Do the community a favour and dont. The devs know it's a problem. You're not helping anything, you're just ruining the game for more people.
---
u/Nibward dont bother with Spofefe, went through his post history and most things he say's is trash and mostly asshole behaviour
---
Depends on what you're after!
---
I've been having a ton of luck with Sloppy Butcher, Nurses' Calling, Thana and Save the Best for Last. 
---
Mixing those with the addon that increases Frenzy's duration and the range of Legion's detection, it can be real deadly.
---
Nope, a number counter that shows how many totems still stand on the map
---
I don't send messages myself unless I get sent messages first but I have had like 3 positive messages sent to me and of course i message positive back and it's quite wholesome I've only been playing for about a week
---
Oh ive been running bbq/ montor/ nurses calling and ruin
---
That‚Äôs not even his final form. He needs to be reving the saw and shaking his head no at you on the hook.
---
I'm only salty when people play like assholes during double bp
---
Jake, I think ~~Michael Myers~~ Moto Moto likes you
---
BBQ, Enduring, Spirt fury
---
4th can be any half decent m1 killer perk not based around healing or instadowns. really though a mix of any of these perks would be fine
---
Bamboozle/Thana/Whispers/Brutal strength/Ruin/Pop goes the weasel/Monitor and abuse/
---
But i will give your combination a try thanks!
---
Run thanta people refuse to cleanse.
---
**look at the flair**
---
The idea is all perks that grant bonus bloodpoints plus a bloody party streamer.  I‚Äôm using this building during the x2 bloodpoints event. 
---
Distressing gives extra for deviousness
---
Hex: Thrill of the hunt increases Hunting bp by 10% per standing totem (50%) total
---
Beast of prey grants 50% more bp to Hunting bp
---
And bbq and chili can give you an extra 100% after the match if you hook everyone at least once. 
---
The idea is while it‚Äôs not a strong build on it own, if your a decent killer you‚Äôll max hunter and deviousness categories and get full stacks on bbq.  So even if the game doesn‚Äôt go your way you still make it out with good BP.
---
If you dc your the definition of a bitch lmao
---
This would have worked on like Billy or something
---
Yea i need to unlock that one xD i will unlock it asap now with double bp and give that a try
---
Survivors should *definitely* be punished for completing the only objective they have in a timely manner.
---
Happened to me too.
---
Several times
---
On FING bloodhunt
---
I cant get bbq but could you give me a little guide on who I have to level up to get the others
---
Omg Spofefe DC'D in a game?
---
HEARD OF
---
The killer can't /know/ if you have decisive strike and slugging just in case the survivor does have it is still more beneficial to the survivors as it is wasting the killer's time instead of immediately throwing the survivor into hooked state level 2
---
If you really want to prestige for the bloody clothes or the achievement feeling, you need to do that ASAP. The more characters you put on 40 before choosing someone to prestige, the longer will be to get a decent build on that prestige character depending on RNG. 
---
My suggestion is stop everything you are doing now and prestige Claudette or whatever character you want to main. Once you have a character complete (P3 + all perks), you can safely play the game without having to use a shitty build while working on level up the remaining characters to 40. 
---
The good part is, after you get your character to P3 + Full perks, the following teachables you unlock will be immediately available in the bloodweb of your main character.
---
As killer, I‚Äôm the nicest I can be. I‚Äôm ALWAYS down to give hatch or let the go via exit gate. Only if they don‚Äôt wiggle!  Like someone said, I‚Äôm not chasing you around the whole map because you‚Äôre scared as shit or for whatever reason. 
---
If I know the hatch is close and they‚Äôre still wiggling I‚Äôll still drop them in. 
---
If I‚Äôm about to hook them and the hatch is RIGHT. THERE I‚Äôm letting them go because that‚Äôs fucked.   
---
I don‚Äôt wiggle if I‚Äôm last and more often than not I get let go.  It‚Äôs not insecure.  How does that have absolutely ANYTHING to do with insecurity???? Let people play how they like and get off of reddit if you‚Äôre gonna talk stupid
---
Honestly i don't need all my perk slots, there are not many perks like that fit my playstyle
---
Honestly most games against me look very similar simply because I don't camp or tunnel. I get tons of points, most of the survivors get a chance to get plenty of points, and I pip up. I don't like farming, but I don't play like an ass either.
---
Prestige is pretty pointless though id do it the moment you get to 50 on the character you want. 
---
For survivor id only get Meg, claudette and a few other key surviors to a high enough level so you dont end up with loads of worthless slots of shit perks. 
---
Imo
---
Dwight= 30
---
Meg= 40
---
Jake= 30
---
Claudette= 40
---
Nea= 40
---
David= 35
---
That should do you honestly, other good perks exist but its not worth cluttering your perk pool up
---
Murderin‚Äô Mike is perfect for Mike
---
Ruin, the perk that blocks 5 gens at the start, noed, spirit fury,enduring, BBQ, whispers, new ghost face perk with gen blocking, and plenty of other perks I don't feel like listing. Killers have good as perks so I don't know what the hell you're smoking.
---
I mean id get bbq leatherface isnt that much. but anyway.
---
What killers do you have unlocked and ill give you a build.
---
But am I supposed to lose every game? :(
---
I mean even Billy has to m1 a lot against good survivors but he would work better agreed
---
I refuse to settle for anything less than an instadown
---
Brown clothes.
---
Honey I have more cakes than a wedding planner's catalog and a whopping zero streamers.
---
Yeah OP put Ashe instead of Ash
---
I can respect that honestly, I've gone against plenty of Iridescent/Pinky Finger players paired with a Mori type of situations when it comes to Killer games, or the usual Teabagging trololol SWF groups. It is what it is, still won't stop me from wishing people chilled out a bit for the event, go all tryhard afterwards, ya know?
---
I need to pour Drano into my eyes now
---
Amanda's letter works too, especially on lery's
---
running escape cake is not being a dickhead  its using double bp weekend to the best you can, the others would just be like ok anoyher cake, nice,
---
But yet you bought Susie hmmmmmm lol nah I‚Äôm just messing with ya I‚Äôm the same way and had the same problem as you
---
Ok but say I want to main Meg but want urban on her. Do I get Meg to 40 then Nea to 40 and then level Meg up more and hope that I get urban in her tree?
---
*I'm fast. I'm very fast.*
---
Agreed.  After my first round of P3‚Äôs I stopped caring.  Couple that with the addition of cosmetics and you don‚Äôt really need P3 looks any more.
---
However, certain characters do benefit from the blood splatter(Meg and Claudette come to mind). 
---
Plus, I just like the idea of having my main being ‚Äúmaxed out‚Äù.  Having every single perk and being P3.
---
Get the following teachable perk for survivors before prestiging:
---
Claudette - Self Care
---
Meg - Adrenaline, Sprint Burat 
---
Nea - Balanced Landing, Urban Evasion
---
David - Dead Hard, We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever 
---
Dwight - Prove Thyself, Bond
---
Feng - Lithe
---
Adam - Deliverance 
---
Jeff - Distortion 
---
Laurie - Decisive Strike
---
Jake - Calm Spirit, Iron Will
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ...what about perks
---
to someone trying to kill me ? no
---
So now I have to add kindred to my list with my self heal and technician
---
Nice.
---
I just prefer LF over billy, they both have instadowns. I just prefer being able to down multiple people instead of covering ground really fast
---
So far many people remove traps at 1st or 2nd try
---
Sometimes when I play killer survivors say I'm good at mindgaming. It's nice to hear something different once in a while.
---
Yes yes you are lol.  Those fences are exactly the same as the killer shack window where you can hit survivor from the other side of it if they get too close.  It is by design.  It always cracks me up when someone learns this for the first time.
---
Ah yes I forgot this game is based on reality.
---
That's why any psychopathic murderer that attacks you is going to refrain from Killing you by carrying you to a sacrificial meathook to let the dark God it serves kill you. 
---
That's also why there's a killer that fucking teleports by using the power of the last breath stolen from her victims to Pierce into the spirit world. 
---
That's also why there are hatchets in the lockers but no Survivior is allowed to get them out and wield them in self defense. 
---
That's also why the only aggressive move you have which describes you as stabbing the killer can only be used 60 seconds after getting unhooked and if you fail once you can't use it again. 
---
That's also why If you run irl you leave giant ass red scratch marks all over the environment too. 
---
We got a real genius over here guys. Apparently this game is 100% based on reality.
---
Id level everyone else but meg to the level/perks you want and then level meg fresh. This is where id prestige meg if you have already levelled her it makes it more likely in those early levels you will get the perks you want.
---
&gt;I think the ranking system is broken :/
---
You just need to understand how emblems work. The system is great. Not perfect, but definitely better than the old one. 
---
My bet is, you didn't work on those generators alone or they already had progress. This reduces the amount of emblem progress you get. 
---
[Emblems Explained - "The ELI5 version"](https://redd.it/8bvz68)
---
you‚Äôre doing great sweetie im proud of u
---
How do you consider yourself a killer main and you didn't know about this lol?
---
Exactly this. Noed is an adrenaline counter, that's all. As a killer, adrenaline is rough to go against. Noed balances it back out. At least we can break your totems and deny your noed. Can't do anything to counter adrenaline. Having said that I don't use noed because I think other perks that help the entire game are better. It's the same reason I don't use ruin. I don't enjoy playing most of the game with three perks.
---
I know thats why most people get dozens of loops per pallet against a standard leatherface.
---
"Awwww, bb killer spawned on bad map, git gud gg ez" /s
---
I feel the same as you, but always get the above message.
---
Great, thank you sir
---
Huntresses with that skin are always the saltiest and most toxic killers.
---
Because I think killers are toxic? Weird analogy kido...
---
Btw, it's possible for the killer to get multiple moris with Rancor. She just has to mori the first obsession, get DS'd, and then mori the new obsession.
---
It's still a great loop lol.  Why the hell should they remove fences?  You basically found out you were wrong and are doubling down by insisting the fence should be removed for nonsensical reasons?  You learned something new.  Take that info and become a better player on both sides.
---
Yes let's make all Survivior defenses flimsy. While we're at it lets also make 3 of them spawn on death hook and they all have no mither. And the hatch doesn't exist, a generator takes 2 hours to do with all 4 people on it, decisive strikes stun lasts .5 seconds without enduring. With enduring there is no stun and you don't drop them. Noed isn't a hex totem, Billy gets a common add on that returns instasaw and Survivior healing takes 20 minutes and requires 7 overcharge skill checks to be hit in a row in order to not auto trigger bleedout.
---
I love the cute little heart right beside Michael on the ground in blood (it looks like a heart anyway).
---
Shows that deep down all he really wants is love...
---
yesterday the gates were open so i face camped someone with a bubba and ended up killing 3 people
---
Deja Vu, Alert, No One Left Behind, Left Behind.
---
I'm not mad if I lose but still pip
---
This is it, this is what I want BHVR. Thank you
---
Most Leatherfaces I play again make the mistake of revving up at pallets anticipating the drop, then lower their chainsaw when the survivor keeps running. When I rev up at pallets I‚Äôm gonna swing whether they drop it or not
---
It's killers like him that make me want borrowed time to be automatically in game
---
I‚Äôd normally say the same but I think it‚Äôs painfully obvious. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait for someone to fall for it though.
---
&gt; but it is as toxic
---
I don't think it's toxic though, i mean like you said it's a legit strategy, unfun for survivors? Yeah. Easy? Yeah. Boring? Yeah. But toxic? Nah.
---
I hate getting horrible messages, and I feel like some toxic players would enjoy the attention too much. So I only send positive ones, especially if a fellow survivor saved my bacon with cool flashlight stunts, or if a killer wiped us all out without camping or tunneling.
---
(I once messaged a killer to tell them they played awesomely and sorry for the final survivor who dc‚Äôd on the way to the last hook. I expected the message would be ignored or just a ‚Äúty‚Äù. But they replied saying they‚Äôd *never* gotten a nice message on the game before and that they‚Äôd assumed I was gonna say ‚ÄúI fucked your mom‚Äù or something, and how nice it was to get such a positive message. Ever since then I‚Äôve made it a point to send out more positive messages to awesome killers and teammates)
---
So?
---
Keep practicing man. I play on ps4 and I recently got into nurse. Best. Decision. Ever. I got to rank 1 in 4 days and I 4k almost every match. So yea. Don't give up on poor old demonic Sally :)
---
Very long, for both killer and survivor. I ended up giving up and playing another game for a while
---
Whoa. ..whoa there.....what was all that unrelated rambling from lol!  All that over a fence you can hit over exclusively if survivors are dumb enough to literally be pressed against it.  You really need to learn on how to calmly learn about a mechanic in the game you were previously ignorant about without getting so weirdly defensive over it.  That response was pure cringe material.
---
I honestly think he sounds like Lil Bub.
---
Petition to make borrowed automatic in the game
---
I‚Äôm 100% joking by the way. Those perks are some of the worst in the game.
---
Its gonna keep happening my guy...the ques just suck at times.
---
Those are all really good! Smacking survivors with Mad Grit who are trying to body block is very satisfying.
---
What about people who DC the moment they go down once? I had a 4 man DC lobby last night. Killed my mood to grind.
---
Double bloodpoints = more people playing killer
---
It's a double point weekend so people are flocking to killer as killer is the big point earner
---
Yeah and that 90% of the time results in them just outrunning the chainsaw as he slows down so much
---
I never said anything other than "hey this is bullshit" that's not me being wrong that's me expressing and opinion.
---
And as someone who plays the most broken killer in the game, this is even more bullshit. That fence is there as a defense mechanism so Surviviors don't get hit easily. So why in the ever loving fuck does it not work. 
---
For starters in this video the Freddy wasn't even LOOKING at him. Second of all, hitting through a fence or window is just absolute horseshit and before people pull the "Hur dur you can do it irl" argument. Yeah does an old Nurse with Stridor piercing into the spirit world to teleport also exist irl? Does a blue Spirit that sounds like fucking Waluigi run around making weird ass twitching movements? Does Micheal Myers really exist? This game is not based on fucking reality guys. 
---
And now that loops are getting reworked, shit like this is gonna happen even *more*. 
---
Man you killer mains can't just concede that you have ur own list of bullshit you can exploit can you? I know I throw stones in a glass house maining Nurse but Jesus fucking Christ at least I admit she's bullshit
---
Are you seriously equating an ultra rare offering to perks and pallets that happen every match?
---
I miss old Legion
---
My completely wild guess with no proof whatsoever is that devs shadow changed the matchmaking, like they did before.
---
Now what we have are "lobby slots" for killers to queue. When these slots are full, you find yourself waiting for a spot to open up. Killers queuing before you take priority.
---
Once a lobby is created for killers, the game does the same for survivors queuing.
---
Now, because of bloodhunt, the killer population is way higher than usual.
---
Wowowowow...which ones thenüòÇ...i got deja vu on now with self care, empathy, and another one i cant remember
---
No, you're just super negative.
---
Yeah but why the obsession? It's genuinely fascinating to me
---
Just ignore them, if someone genuinely tells you to "git gud" because they escaped on Haddonfield then talking with them is an absolute waste of time and energy.
---
All very good perks!
---
Carburetor tuning guide &amp; primer bulbs my friend
---
I‚Äôm just bringing this up here because it‚Äôs bothered me for a bit.  ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land‚Äù is stupid to say.  If the land is already cursed it wouldn‚Äôt be shocking to bring more badness.  It should be ‚ÄúWhat fucking curse did you just bring upon this land.‚Äù  That makes the magnitude of the awful thing more drastic, as it is now the curse on the land.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
Maybe bc I'm good enough to not have to deal with it. 
---
Or maybe bc I main Nurse so I don't have to exploit extra bullshit since my killer is just a fat load of it to begin with. 
---
Or maybe bc I don't play normal M1 killers bc I don't like simple minded gameplay
---
Turn off vsync. You probably have to play it on low with that gpu. But some argue that low is ideal cause its sharper and brighter.
---
I miss no cooldown when lunging. You could hit a hooked survivor infinite times until FF ended.
---
Hes technically not wrong hes just an absolute dick for doing it
---
thb, this addon is under rated, it will tell you were the obsession spawned, allowing you to have a very strpng begining game
---
They said it was passive, that everyone would just fall asleep naturally after I believe it was 60 seconds.
---
If this is the mechanic in this game that induces rage in you I have to recommend that maybe this just isn't the game for you man.  You obviously have a hair trigger if a fence gets you this hot and bothered.  Maybe something more casual is more your speed.  There are a number of candy crush games available on the mobile platform.
---
Yeah, Devour Hope can get nasty if it stays up
---
Once you go up the ranks, you'll never hit multiple people with LFs chainsaw unless you're camping or got someone in the basement. Billy can also use his chainsaw at pallets but LF can't since he becomes as fast as my grandma when he charges up his chainsaw
---
Did you respond to the wrong comment? When did I talk about stealth or be a dick
---
I don't get why people get hung up on it really. I'll be a little irked if I know I'm better than who I'm playing against but I keep myself realistically grounded knowing that as long as both sides have had some kind of interesting game that it doesn't matter who 'won' the match. It's all about the points after all.
---
The point
---
^
---
Your head
---
It's not because "muh realism" it's because it is intuitive.
---
True, I hate going against good survivors as Billy because I almost never land a chainsaw
---
Hey all I did was call it bullshit and then a deluge of killer mains collapse on me with this "Hur dur no it's not go test it irl ur not a real killer main" so yeah I'm gonna get a little pissy with half brained retards that can't admit when they have horseshit mechanics to exploit and constantly rag on the other side for bullshit mechanics. 
---
But sure call me raging.
---
I mean to be fair M1 killers is where all the skill is at in this game.  It doesn't really get any more simple-minded then learning and using Nurse exclusively to climb rank lol.  Maybe a better choice of words is a better fit.
---
I usually get to rank 2-3 with him every month
---
Has Rank something to do about it ? Someone from my Friends told me it could be because im Rank 20
---
I think you missed me making fun of you saying spawning in Shelter Woods with 4 randoms and a good killer. Thus implying you're none of them.
---
Oh well the ranking system is still way better than before at least you dont autopip anymore as killer
---
Ur literally saying to go test it irl. Meaning ur logic translates to "if you can do it irl you can do it here". 
---
By that standard Surviviors should be able to grab the hatchets out of lockers and fuck up the killer with them bc you can do that irl
---
It rarely ever gets to );
---
It's aight lol
---
The Doctor may not have THAT much chase power, but he definitely gives the survivors a headache from all the screams and hallucinations they have.
---
Glad that you can get multiple hits at high ranks :) sadly for me though is that never happens unless I have someone in the basement
---
I'm pretty sure survivors are able to glitch it out so you cant mori them
---
You are both stars. Enjoy your upvotes.
---
You clearly never played Nurse if you think M1 killers like Billy Legion Clown Pig Plague or Doc are harder.
---
Well I just don't wanna spend 8 bucks on a killer I won't use
---
I've got trapper, wraith, hillbilly, nurse, hag, doc, huntress and legion
---
I step in traps like that pretty often (the popular looping spots) and it's usually because I feel like I'm out of options or it's too late by the time I realize where the chase is headed. I'm usually telling my swf team "I'm taking him to X location and there's probably gonna be a trap here so just focus on gens for a minute while I keep him busy and then come for me."
---
But as a fellow trapper player, I definitely get what you mean overall. It's pretty funny how often people will get caught in traps when they know they're up against a trapper.
---
Maker her have 1 blink and shes shit, really if they got rid of omegablink and more than 2 blink addons she would be okay. Base nurse would still be very strong but not broken
---
It's a bug. I've seen it on Puppers' stream multiple times.
---
Basically, if a Survivor is recovering on the ground it overrides and cancels the Mori animation. 
---
Until it gets fixed it's not worth using Mori Offerings, since you either have to hope the Survivor will let you Mori them or you have to wait for them to finish recovering to be able to Kill them.
---
Do u know how?
---
I'll take "things that shouldn't exist" for 200 Alex
---
1 hook camps?  They dc?  You don't just depip on a 3k without more to the story.
---
Nice game
---
I mean, you walked right into that. Plague is cheesy though.
---
Ohh, my apologies for missing the joke, didn't notice that I accidentally said that there are 5 survivors :D
---
No, no DC's, I didnt camp, and I got most of them down to their last hook.
---
Oh thats bad
---
Nurse with one blink would still ignore most obstacles. In most scenarios you dont need to blink twice to down survivors. I'd say she would still be top 3 with 1 blink + 105% movement speed, but at least she would be more bareable
---
There is actually a bug, that makes the yellow envelope give all survivors 25%, just like the green one. I recommend using all your yellow envelopes before the new update on tuesday, because they will most likely patch that.
---
That also, you can't derank at R15-20 so less people to play vs.
---
It is common knowledge that Nurse is by far the most ridiculously strong killer in the game.  She has the biggest learning curve but once you learn her she is mindlessly easy to trash survivors through rank 1 as she ignores all chase mechanics.  You know this dude...hard to learn but once you do she is so easy to 4k with.  Try maining Freddy, Wraith and Trapper against rank 1 swf groups and get your 4k and tell me you didn't have to work way harder to win your game lol.  I prefer to main the weakest in game killers because it makes the wins feel so much more rewarding than if I simply boosted rank with nurse.
---
Would this only play to exposure perks like NOED and haunted grounds or both perks and killers?
---
Sorry but there are 6 adepts unless you're pc
---
Okay then that leaves you with
---
Enduring off billy, Thana off nurse, Whispers (general), Brutal off trapper, Ruin off hag and Monitor off doc. I guess discordance off legion also isnt bad so you could use that if you want. 
---
So i dunno
---
Enduring/Brutal/Discordance/Ruin would be the best I guess
---
Damn, you got TF2? I loved that game when it was popular
---
Lol.
---
Brown clothes aaaaand Urban Evasion, mixed with Sprint Burst and the others 2 are your choice
---
Mine are Iron Will and Self Care.
---
You're just going to get meme suggestions with the way you titled your post. Claudette players sort of have a reputation for hiding and sneaking a lot, and generally playing in a quite selfish manner. It's not all memes, this comes with the fact she tends to blend in *really well* with the environment, and she has Self-Care which is, well, a good perk for solo queues I guess but makes you a way less productive team member if you're always healing yourself.
---
If you haven't unlocked any teachable perks yet, I would recommend playing Claudette until you unlock **Self-Care**, and then switching to another character. Want to be credit to team? Level up your Bill next to get **Borrowed Time**, arguably the best altruistic perk in the game.
---
So 3 hooking survivors in a 3k game you're saying and still depip?  Because that math doesn't add up.  You'd never depip from that.
---
Anymore? You CANT! Licensed characters can only be bought with Auric cells
---
DC doesnt void the achievement Source: me
---
Yeah, i just started playing nursr and this guy barely escapes and post chat he says: "gg ez baby killer, you suck dud"... i mean why? The toxicity amongs players are a big reason players dont like to play dbd
---
no lightborn should make it harder for a save not impossible. but they fixed it after a while
---
How often do you see a rank 1 SWF group. 
---
And I'm sorry that I like to play killers that take forethought and not "hold W and then press left click when I'm close enough." I like mechanical demand lmao. 
---
Imagine thinking good Nurse players are boosted. She's by far one of the hardest to play well
---
I used to work for a video game company, and we would get kids contacting us ONLY to complain about not winning every time. That was proof that our whole game was broken. At first, I was super empathetic, giving them advice on how to increase their chances at winning and stuff, then after a while I just started telling them to look up a professional gamer losing a game, to see that YOU CANNOT WIN ALL THE TIME.
---
what does M1 mean?
---
Does that mean if rank reset come i will stay Rank 15? When i grind up there?
---
All survivors are the same, there are no classes. The difference between them is that each survivor has 3 unique perks that become available to learn for all other survivors when you level a survivor up to level 30-40. Once you learn the mechanics, you'll get a feel for what perks are useful for you or what you don't need. 
---
Self Care is good because you can heal yourself when there is no team mate around to help you and Empathy is good because you can see when someone is being chased, so you know when you're safe to do a generator in peace. It also helps finding people to heal. Spine Chill is also very useful, especially if you're new. It lights up when the killer is looking at you while he's still pretty far away, so you can sneak out early. Other than that, if you're playing on console, Borrowed Time is not tied to a survivor, so you'll unlock it with Claudette and it's one of the best perks in the game right now. Many other good perks are spread around different survivors, so you'll have to level them up to get the perks on Claudette.
---
Fast as Fuck boi
---
Holy fuck dude, do you understand the difference between intuitive and realistic? It makes sense for a killer to be able to hit over a hip-tall wall. It also makes sense that the survivors can't/coose not to attack the killers that are being powered by the multi dimensional, all powerful Entity.
---
It doesn‚Äôt happen as often as low ranks but on ps4 after about rank 8 you pretty much vs the same groups every day
---
Generally i advise going for 1 exhaustion perk, something that helps yourself and something that helps your team.
---
My current build is: 
---
* Balanced Landing or Dead Hard (exhaustion perks) 
---
* Decisive Strike (so in case the killer slaps me down after unhook i can get away) or Adrenaline
---
* Borrowed Time (in case the killer camps my teammates) 
---
* We're Gonna Live Forever (extra bloodpoints) or We'll Make It (fast heals).
---
I think I've only seen one person cheat ever. I'm on console and this wraith was just zipping around the entire map at the speed of sound. The match lasted about 4 minutes because he was so damn fast
---
Hag, Spirit, Pig.
---
So we officially have to farm with you guys otherwise we‚Äôre tryhards? Please tell this a joke so I can r/woosh myself
---
You're a blendette. Did you expect anything different?
---
You need dead hard for that pallet looping... typical bloodlust gamer tho.. lol
---
I found the image from r/Splatoon and I made a caption that related to Dead By Daylight for it
---
Dude I love the titanfall series. It‚Äôs unfortunate that no one really cared about it. The second improved on so much from the first.
---
Any proof? Just curious
---
I've played countless rank 1 swf groups over the years.  I've been playing for a long time.  Funny because you were the first person to talk about her being broken too but now you try to downplay it.  Learning her is the hard part.  Playing her after learning to play her isn't man.  There is a reason you main her and you listed the reason in an earlier comment that supports what I've said about her.
---
&gt; Are you just mad you don‚Äôt play with stupid people?
---
You're saying Leatherface is only good against stupid people and that he doesn't need a rework. You're dense as hell
---
Dud you not hear the gates power mid swing? Sone other guy talked shit and then realized how dumb he was her not catching it and removed his comment. Maybe you should do the same?
---
P.S. if you're gonna be a dick, don't.
---
I know, I loved the second one and all the types of titans included.
---
Lery's and The Game.
---
During the Double Bloodpoint event I've encountered some camping killers, but more often than not we have fun farming or being goofy. I led a Michael to a random corner in a chase on the swamp with only one other survivor left, and stopped and pointed for him to go away. He did! Let both of us go. Same with a doctor, I dropped my toolbox in front of him as an "offering" as the last survivor and we found hatch together. Good times when I was expecting the worst!
---
His chaser emblem was most likely bronze; pulling people off the traps doesn't contribute to it
---
No one has to do anything. I was merely commenting that I hadn't found farming survivors like others had mentioned, but more so super killers because of rerank.
---
Huntress probably would have been the best choice for this meme.
---
That sounds horrible. Play the game.
---
Oh okay, cool. Thanks for the heads up.
---
‚ÄúYou know, I enslave you guys who love killing, thinking you‚Äôll do all of the... killing! But no, I gotta do this shit myself!‚Äù
---
Your rank can reset lower than 15 but you won't lose pips at ranks 15-20.
---
Well yeah I guess but still, it's also not fun at all and kind of ruins the game for people.
---
Hey just want to point out that I dont think there is anything wrong with going all out and tryharding during the bloodhunt. Just because an event is going on, and you arent a complete asshole, you shouldn't be kept from playing what you think is fun. Besides, there will be plenty of other games where the killer will likely let you farm. :)
---
I spy a Claudette, wait thats a bush. Still, your wraith looks awesome!
---
Or when you go through like 20+ bloodwebs at p3 level 50 and you STILL have no exhaustion perk 
---
Fuck me
---
That may've been it. My own power once again betrays me.
---
Don't you fucking date
---
The deviousness, hook states and lightbringer though would be enough to guarantee at the very least a safety though.  I'm certain this is a partial story.  Moris? Camps?  Dc's..something happened here.  Fetch me Sherlock Holmes there's a mystery about and it smells sinister.
---
&gt;  and technician
---
damn boy
---
Here‚Äôs hoping the third will be so much then the second one and everyone enjoys it and it gets the recognition it deserves.
---
Please no
---
Shouldn't that be every leatherface player I've ran into ever?
---
Awwwwwwwwww!  A baby Leatherface in his natural habitat.  I just want to cradle him up in a blankie and bottle feed his adorable infant ass.
---
nice
---
If people are gonna camp then it's only fair ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ok, but why is the paper like that
---
You, my good sir, deserve this upvote
---
If I bring an Ebony I only use it when the survs are dead on hook purely because I like the mori animations. Unless of course it‚Äôs like and ultra toxic SWF group then it‚Äôs insta moris.
---
Thanks I will work on getting those then
---
I think just perks
---
Nice catch! Didn‚Äôt think anyone would notice it
---
This happened to me while using 5 stacks of devour hope and right when I finally got it to work his teammates broke my totem and I didn't get to mori. I was soooooo pissed.
---
Okay cause this would absolutely destroy killers that can insta down
---
I don't know, I think she is a killer who looks cute and has a lot of potential.
---
same with me. for example, if i‚Äôm playing wraith or leatherface and i get a map like torment creek, i know i‚Äôm going to lose. and if i‚Äôm playing trapper on rotten fields, i know i‚Äôm going to lose. it‚Äôs all about knowing, so then you don‚Äôt get mad when you lose
---
It is entirely because you‚Äôre rank 20. This coupled with double bloodpoints mean you‚Äôll be struggling. 
---
Reasoning is what the other redditor told you. The ‚Äúlady‚Äù person
---
Great advice
---
This is how I've played this game for so long. So many Killers have this mentality of "4K or I lose", to the point where a Killer being "High Rank Viable" is all about 4K'ing. 
---
No. You're not supposed to 4K every game, or even *most* games. So play Pig, Wraith, Doctor or Trapper! It'll make you better at the game as a whole, too.
---
How many perks do you have? 
---
If you have a large variety then the build that the lady person told you will work.
---
Unnecessary picture of you
---
The only way a nerf to nurse like this would be acceptable would be to add Plaid Flannel to her default power to be honest. If your'e going to lower her skill ceiling, you gotta lower her skill floor.
---
So basically an improved version of pop goes the weasel?
---
It would‚Äôve been more fitting if Doctor was in the hospital. 
---
Docs always fun until people know how to play against it. Good stuff.
---
This could be a killer perk
---
Yeah, the inside hospital, right? I couldn't remember the name, but that's where I was.
---
*TERRITORIAL INTESTIFIES*
---
Killer: Oh boi, off I go killing again.
---
Yes. Lery‚Äôs. The actual hospital map.
---
You mean NOT to have high blood pressure, right?
---
Your reaction to Wraith was hysterical.  
---
Helpful tip! While you're on a gen, pan your camera around. That will help against ambush/stealth killers. Wraith, Pig, Michael, and Ghostface. You want a 360¬∞ view of your surroundings at all times. Some generators are less safe that others, leaving you exposed and in a vulnerable position. I hope this helps! Good luck with the game. It's fun as hell and addictive.
---
Where exactly have these mass complaints been made? Pretty much everyone agreed he was awful and now people think hes fine.
---
Yeah, the Asylum is the outside map with the horse, yeah?
---
I would main Shawn. ifyouknowwhatimean

Deviousness doesn't factor into Emblems at all. And we also have no idea how he did with Light Bringer. It's like gens were done quickly for this to happen, on top of the poor chaser from traps.
---
The feeling you spam that 1 button to use dead hard but noticed you were already exhausted from using dead hard 5 sec ago.
---
High ranks would abuse this. One blink Nurse is awful. 
---
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù for playing one blink Nurse. 
---
The first blink is to catch up, the second blink is for accuracy. They need to change her extra blink add ons but one blink would be awful.
---
No thank you. Nurse needs the two blinks, one for closing the gap, and one to recalibrate
---
L√©ry's.
---
One of the two, yes.
---
i love the new DS. big ‚Äúhaha fuck you!‚Äù to tunnelers, and is fair against killers that don‚Äôt BM
---
 I sent the killer a ggwp and he replied with 
---
‚ÄúFuck off‚Äù
---
I assume you mean addons rather than offerings?
---
Idk lmao. Dis dude big mad rn tho
---
I was dead
---
Right on.... Can't edit the post, unfortunately, but yeah, I was inside Lery's. Great match!
---
I see on Jake's map he has some missing posters and red Xs marking some locations. Are these meant to be the last known locations of Meg, Dwight and Claud?
---
I've received it! Thank you so much! :))
---
Hey I'd like to give my thoughts on the example you gave with an injured and healthy survivor. I think if you go back to the hook and see both the person who got unhooked as well as the person who rescued, it would make the most sense in my eyes to slug the injured survivor and chase the healthy survivor. What this does is it keeps one survivor out of the game by keeping them on the ground, and another survivor out of the game by chasing them. If nobody comes to rescue the downed survivor, then they are pretty much completely out of the game at that point, and if somebody does come to pick them up then that's the person picking them up, the person on the ground, AND the person you are chasing all doing nothing. You might even wait out a potential DS from the unhooked survivor. Plus you get the added bonus of not being legitimately called out for tunneling in post game chat if you dont immediately hook them.
---
Sometimes it does make sense to immediately down an unhooked survivor, but that doesn't mean you have to be "scummy" about the way you do things. Just my thoughts on a similar but alternative playstyle :)
---
Well, now we know Myers is everyones daddy.
---
I created more hype for Pig since your post.
---
Yes it is, it's best to not use it on trapper though, his deviousness gains are not the best
---
That's true. I keep my salt to myself and never send aggro, but I hate to lose. I know it's a big flaw, but I get pretty mad at myself and them. I broke my controller throwing it across the room after "losing" once.
---
No you‚Äôre mixing it up. 
---
There‚Äôs only one hospital map, that‚Äôs Lery‚Äôs. 
---
There are two asylum maps ‚Äî Crotus and Father Campbell‚Äôs. 
---
Father Campbell‚Äôs is the one with the horse. Not the hospital. The hospital is all indoors except for the exit gates.
---
Those are all fine perks but you are going to waste a lot of bloodpoints before levelling your main if you are just getting started. Also youd have to specifically not take some perks or get loads of shit ones with the good ones
---
I mean I see your point but that's also why perks like DS exist
---
Bruh just search for totems and don't evem get to end game because you were trying to find the last totem that was actually cleaned by the Meg.
---
True, I play ps4 and after rank 8 I recognize a lot of the survivors I go against
---
You gotta find grassy areas to obscure them, or I like placing them outside of windows or drop areas so they fall into them, etc.
---
This sounds pretty bad to be honest. It would be an across the board nerf for her power while making her another m1 killer.
---
So what how does legion running at people + Kenya = racist?
---
Yeppers, I was indoors in Lery's.
---
Holy shit I can't believe people still complain about gen rushing. What fuck do you want people to do? Stand there jerking it? Fuck you people are something.
---
I love u and ur art!!!!! How did u learn to be amazing at art??????
---
I generally put traps at pallets or vault points and try to herd the survivors there. Doing that makes it to where they either take a hit or get trapped
---
I feel like there is only one damn map I can get when playing Hillbilly; the fucking swamp. It's horrible. I don't know what I hate so much about it, but its the worst map in the game in my opinion. At least I can get the close chainsaw in small maps, but not when they're hiding in a building.
---
If you have doc, monitor/abuse is very good on legion, especially when used with nurse‚Äôs. I personally run Monitor/Nurses/BBQ/ and a GenHate perk like ruin/Overcharge/Pop. Without BBQ I‚Äôd probably use like whispers or discordance or even like stridor. In all honesty if you don‚Äôt have nurses teachables level her and get them nurses is never bad imo
---
Apparently I just can't internet today........smh
---
aren't m1 killers those whose powers don't help them in chases at all though
---
Sometimes you don't get to use the second chain blink in chases
---
Well no shit. Learning a character is always the harder part. That's why Spirit is hard, it's all learning, ur always learning. 
---
The Nurse is hard bc you need to master her mechanics and then apply them correctly. There's more decision making with Nurse than there is for almost every other killer (sans Spirit). And thanks to her lightburn weakness a Survivior that actually wants to focus on countering her most definitely can. 
---
Imagine thinking Nurse is easy. The only thing easy about her is how easy you can lose a game if you fuck up.
---
Tunneling isn't the objective, killing people is the objective. Tunneling leads you to get less kills while also ruining the survivor's experience.
---
I love baby megs
---
Throughout their Twitter, YouTube, and other things, True talent was talking g about if they need him and so was Monto ( I think ) they weren‚Äôt complaining but certain survivors were
---
Why is that?
---
Survivor:Oh No!!! They killed Bill!!
---
Other survivor:  Naw it's fine, he still has borrowed time.
---
Headless bill: *starts mending*
---
You've done to pig what u/FrankWest21cp did to freddy
---
I‚Äôm gonna be even more pissed if they nerf him since survivors don‚Äôt like more than 3 or 4 killers
---
Lmao no one is complaining about ghost face. You‚Äôre big mad and for what?
---
Imagine you go against a swf. You can always get reckt and the problem is that you be like "OOF didn't get any kills" and then they even call you trash and that you are baby killer and stuff like that. That's what I call fun lmao
---
Oh wow, yeah, good eye! I always imagined that Jake would‚Äôve known that a few people had recently gone missing in the woods, and tried to help look for them in his spare time. Before he took got got, that is
---
I will be working on getting endurance monitor/abuse and some other perks now since I have only leveled legion haha
---
Useful, I didnt think of that, nice way to put it
---
True moans about survivors constantly and often exagerates everything they say. So you are basing this thread of what a killer main has apparently heard others say fair enough.
---
Looks like 3D don't starve.
---
we know. it‚Äôs just a joke on the name man
---
Eh, just gen rush and go on to the next game, what are you gonna do?
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, without a second blink, being able to pallet stun her while blinking, and the changes to her fatigue mechanics you are proposing she would be forced to mostly just chase after people since she‚Äôd be too easy to evade.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that you‚Äôre just reading things wrong and your stupid.
---
One day I was born and I said to myself, ‚Äúhow can I make my life worse‚Äù and here I am
---
He speaks for the lockers
---
I was playing normally and after I hooked a Jane I looked at my feet and there crouched a cute little ash nodding his little head. He'd already been hooked 2 times at this point so I nodded back and moved away to let him unhook. The rest of the game progressed in a very civilized farm.
---
Unfortunately, my very next game I got gen rushed. RIP to my only bloody party streamers.
---
The basement layout is the same always, so you‚Äôll always know your way around it. In addition it‚Äôs one of the few (if not only) tiles in the game with one way in and out. In general if you can hook someone in basement, do it.
---
This right here officer, this is the post
---
You have 2 arms, you can carry it both and drop the flashlight when working on a Gen.
---
The game had just started and I found Ruin almost immediately.
---
I started playing the trapper about 3 days ago and it's going very well! I mean, some games I get wrecked but I feel like a have a decent grasp of him. He's a super fun killer and I'm having a really good time, I should have picked him up sooner.
---
I also decided that I will bring Franklin's, no matter what. It's paying off.
---
Is this rank 23?
---
Literally 0 people are complaining about him. I'm intentionally saying nothing bc I wanna see where he lands before I voice the opinion I already have of him
---
I love art with tons of little details to discover, keep up the great work! :D
---
Is this about liking art or jake or michael myers
---
How exactly does tunnelling lead to less kills?
---
And I honestly do not care if the survivors experience is ruined it‚Äôs my objective to kill and I will do whatever it takes to do it.
---
Right.
---
If I put those on I try to message everyone that i have them and let's farm
---
The totem spots are usually more concealed on those maps, making them harder to spot
---
Even in solo survivor games when I see a player start running past me from my gen, I follow them because it's a feeling that the killer is following his tracks or stalking him. So I just bail.
---
Not a girl
---
Not a robot
---
Not a person
---
&gt;What did you do to upset him *that* much?
---
I found Ruin like 10 seconds into the match, so he decided to punish me for it.
---
I feel called out
---
Honestly, it's my favorite. I can get chased when I want to get chased, and get a head start when they see me. I can also duck behind something and walk away.
---
and people don't wanna play with you because you're a dipshit
---
Will it do anything though?
---
I‚Äôm not even a killer main I just want another good killer
---
Shouldn't have blocked the username, we'd know who was a troll
---
His game crashed right after Ruin was destroyed? Unlikely.
---
Not wrong, he has ruined his marriage.
---
You make it sound like reporting does something other than mildly annoy the person who has to sort through them all.
---
are you a girl?
---
No its not.
---
Thanks for the calculation, would you like a degree?
---
My name is not spofefe in game, but thanks for the assumptions
---
True.  Probably best in like clown or legion? 
---
I think I have all perks in Trapper, Hag, and Pig. 
---
Close on Freddy and Michael
---
Shout out to the Z block Freddy with an Ebony Mori that chased me for 3 gens. Downed me and waited at the hook. At least the team finished 5 gens and unhooked me again before he Mori-Ed me. Idiot.
---
Are you dumb? You're not a part of this conversation
---
Well i was playing as a 4 with friends and i got 20k points while my mates got 4,6 and 7k. They werent too happy lmao
---
Eh..I dont see a point cause I feel if I do then it's either gonna be salt with the reply or plague vomit in the reply.
---
Wtf no. 1 Blink Nurse is worse than 5 blink Nurse.
---
 Remove fragile wheeze, Torn Bookmark, and Cincture. And then make father Campbell's last breath moderately or considerably cut the range of her blinks instead of slightly. 
---
Then nerf the max range increase of Ataxic and Catatonic.
---
Crimes Johnson, you are under arrest for using franklins no matter what.
---
More practice id say, you're probably just better at those killers
---
It is, "Rage quit" is listed as a example
---
The best at gaining bloodpoints are legion and doctor, the worst are pig and trapper
---
People might disagree with me, but I think enduring without one of the combo perks (brutal strength or spirit fury) is sort of a waste. 
---
If you only have legion leveled I would aim for something like Discordance/Sloppy Butcher/ and maybe like Whispers/NOED but like, I wouldn‚Äôt get used to noed since in all honesty it‚Äôs not a good habit to develop. 
---
Do you have anything unlocked from the shrine of secrets?
---
This made me chuckle
---
You have a feng flair LOL
---
what if we tunnel cause were farming with the survivors :(
---
Indeed!
---

No I haven't gotten anything from the shrine I need to save my currency for susie and joey
---
This is sick! Great job :)
---
I‚Äôll dead hard and it won‚Äôt do anything and i‚Äôll go down, but i‚Äôll be exhausted. Like what?!

#imagine watching monto
---
Where are these memes being sourced from because they're iconic
---
You know what? I never thought of that!
---
actually rank 15
---
*guardian bubba pops out of no where*
---
You watch too much Opedo.
---
It's hit or miss. I just play normally and keep track of who I hook. I try to twirl around and do silly stuff to try to show I am friendly. I will let them heal off hook. I don't camp or tunnel. Good luck. üòä
---
Same. Also I really hate hook farmers, can sometimes BM them really hard uthil then die and start to farm with others after
---
r/gamersriseup
---
Even worse. Nice.
---
I feel like when you get 1 hooked and die because no one saves you within 2 minutes, at that point, the killer isnt the one who killed you, it's your teammates
---
Homemade by myself with a meme maker app

Factual

Just had a match against a camping leatherface, downed somebody and revved his chainsaw at his face for 5 mins. Must have been fun for him. The worst part was that he was streaming it. His stream title also said camping/tunneling. What a guy.
---
Well Frank used fear and intimidation on them. They didn't do it on their own evil. Frank was also the first one who stabbed the janitor
---
Sorry that you're bad, then.
---
Yeeeahhh..........
---
TO THE SWF WHO SANDBAGGED, BODYBLOCKED AND TEABAGGED ME AND MADE THE LAST 25 MINUTES OF MY LIFE A FUCKING PISSING MATCH: I HOPE YOU BURN IN THE FUCKING HELL YOU CAME FROM YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT. FUCK YOUR METTLE OF MAN. FUCK YOUR BALANCED LANDING. FUCK YOUR DECISIVE STRIKE. FUCK THIS GAME AND FUCK YOUR UNBALANCED PERKS AND FUCK SURVIVORS.
---
i bet david king would get dead hard after seeing this
---
Even if he is, your point would be? He wants to know whether this is a good build or not.
---
That's not how i usually play, but during the double blood points, yes. Tell me your PSN name, I'll be sure to disconnect
---
everytime  I try to farm the survivors are dumbasses and think I'm trying to kill them then tbag me at the gate for tryna farm
---
What do you mean I'm not supposed to win every game my ego tells me I'm a god at this game and it's impossible for me to lose unless the other guy cheats 
---
I'm actually trying him now still gotta get used to him chainsaw is strange but op
---
*grabs popcorn*
---
A Leatherface did this to me. Fuck him.
---
I never said it was dipshit, im referencing your username not what your name in the actual game, nice try though
---
That's why I made this post. Hoping for a universal signal
---
Wraiths don't sound like dogs haha
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôm not gonna spread it around
---
same dude haha
---
Git gud
---
YOU ARE THE REASON THIS GAME IS DEAD, AND YET YOU COMPLAIN AND BITCH AND MOAN AND CRY ABOUT HOW THIS GAME NEEDS MORE PLAYERS. PEOPLE LIKE YOU RUINED THIS FUCKING GAME, YOU META-HOGGING FUCKING SHIT BITCH. FUCKING END YOUR OWN MISERABLE LIFE. HOW IS THIS FUN TO YOU? HOW IS IT FUN TO JUST PALLET LOOP AND FAST VAULT THE SAME WINDOW 300 FUCKING TIMES WITH NO PUNISHMENT WHATSOEVER? HOW IS IT FUN FOR YOU TO JUST KEEP DOING THE SAME GENERATOR THE SECOND I FUCKING LEAVE AND I CANNOT PUNISH YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE CONSTANTLY JUST FUCKING LOOPING AND RUNNING AND VAULTING AND I'M TOO SLOW TO PUNISH YOU? HOW IS THIS FAIR? IS IT FUNNY? IS IT BECAUSE ITS FUNNY? WHY DO YOU THINK I ENJOY WASTING MY FUCKING TIME WITH YOUR BULLSHIT? WHY THE FUCK DO YOU THINK ITS OKAY TO INSULT ME IN THE END GAME CHAT LIKE ITS MY FAULT YOU'RE ALL FUCKING USING THE MOST BROKEN AND UNFAIR PERK BUILDS TOGETHER WHILE ALSO COMMUNICATION ON DISCORD? HOW IS IT FAIR? YOU SHOULD BE FUCKING HAPPY I DIDN'T DISCONNECT AND I LET YOU TAKE THE BLOODPOINTS YOU FUCKING HUMAN TRASH. YOU ARE ACTUALLY A FUCKING JOKE TO THIS COMMUNITY AND I PRAY TO GOD WHATEVER FUCKING INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER YOU USE ON YOUR DOGSHIT ROUTERS SELLS YOU OFF TO ISIS YOU FUCKING PIGSHIT CUNTSKIN. END YOUR FUCKING LIFE.
---
Ok but, it‚Äôs just a game. You can get over it pretty easily, you won‚Äôt even remember about it in an hour. So chill out and breath bro
---
I don't think any killer think throwing down pallets is toxic
---
FUCK YOU.
---
She lost her mother during a hunt. She was not able to mature out of her 6 year old mind. Her story is written in a way to make her a little bit not responsible for her action. She thought she could save the little girls and hunted people for food. Also to make her badass, she killed nazis or its implied in her story.
---
THIS ISNT A FUCKING JOKE YOU TOXIC FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT.
---
Why not use it and find out?
---
A bit of an over reaction dude... DS is a onetime use perk thats only function is to counter tunneling. If they got use out of it it's on you. Balanced Landing is a limited exhaustion perk... MoM is annoying but its a onetime use perk again that gives you an aura reading when they heal. Though I dont believe in teabagging (unless the killer is being toxic) you cant blame perks and call meta perks toxic...
---
Omg haha wtf
---
I don't have it yet.
---
I am really bad at keeping track of who I hit unless I make it a point to pay attention to the names and faces
---
I had a match the other day where kindred saved us. First two gens got done pretty quickly, and so the Pig opted to crouch nearby and wait for the unhook. Instead, the remaining three of us were able to finish the gens, and while two went for the rescue the other got a gate open. All of us ended up escaping, but if we had been lured off the gens to go for the unsafe hook, odds are at least one of us would have died. When Kindred works, it *works*.
---
How is that relevant to the post?
---
She was physically and mentally abused by patient and staff members for over 20 years, without getting any promotion or recognition. She snapped in her lore.
---
I love the inclusion of in game items here. It gives a sense to how the Entity actually acquired said items 
---
Fucker stole them.
---
Nice. I love the doctor. I don't play very often anymore but sometimes it's fun to come back and just shit on people with him
---
NO I FUCKING WONT. I'M NEVER PLAYING THIS FUCKING SHIT GAME AGAIN NOW THAT I KNOW YOU CAN GET REWARDED WITH MILLIONS OF FUCKING BLOODPOINTS FOR PLAYING LIKE A FUCKING CRYBABY WHO SHITS THEIR FUCKING DIAPER. IM DONE WITH THIS FUCKING DEAD GAME. I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED PLAYING BACK IN 2016 WHEN THEY ADDED MICHAEL MYERS. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS GAME WAS GOING TO BECOME THE FUCKING SCUM-REWARDING PISSING MATCH IT BECAME.
---
Memento mori
---
That's rude.
---
People don't understand sarcasm. I said you could _just as easily replace this with_, implying that the terms used by both sides are stupid. Do the fucking objectives and quit whining about tunneling, camping, gen rushing, etc.
---
Lmao imagine playing on PSN
---
Can we add a layer under this for survivors who cleanse my thrill of the hunt totem during double bp when I'm letting them farm me?
---
Hey man anytime, sometimes us WOKE fellas gotta wake up the others
---
He said advice on what perks to use on Legion, not what killer to play. Have you got fucked up eyes?
---
ITS FUCKING BROKEN IS WHAT IT IS. IM GETTING SANDBAGGED RIGHT BY THE FUCKING EXIT GATES TRYING TO GET ATLEAST ONE FUCKING KILL AFTER GETTING GENRUSHED AND ABUSED FOR 25 MINUTES AND I FINALLY GET SOMEONE AFTER THEY UNHOOK THEM AND THEY JUST STAB ME AND RUN OUT. THIS ISNT FUCKING FAIR. I NEVER HAD EVEN ONE OPPORTUNITY TO FUCKING KILL ANYONE. ITS BULLSHIT. I FUCKING CAUGHT THE SURVIVOR. I SHOULD GET TO KILL THEM.
---
It doesnt need to be to be funny
---
There is no universal signal, only hoping survivors are willing to farm if you do what most farmers do
---
Yep I've barely been playing the past months because the grind of trying to play both sides with passable perks for each burnt me out. I'm not even sure why I still check this sub, force of habit I guess.
---
1. Yes
---
Not sure about 2
---
METTLE OF MAN IS OVERPOWERED. STOP LYING TO YOURSELF. IT LITERALLY TANKS A FREE FUCKING HIT AND BALANCED LANDING LITERALLY LETS THEM RUN UP ANY FUCKING HILL AND ESCAPE ME WITH NO FUCKING EFFORT OR SKILL WHATSOEVER.
---
Can confirm, happened to me yesterday.  When I realized what happened I was genuinely impressed.
---
Oh
---
FUCK YOU TOO.
---
Alright then, take a break from it and you‚Äôll solve your problem. Stop smacking your keyboard you‚Äôre just hurting yourself
---
I don't care about killing everyone. It's about the stacks from bbq, especially during these events.
---
Disconnecting in a game is also rude. But you still do it right?
---
Dont question bing bong boi UwU
---
I was not talking about bannable offenses, I was talking about [ragequitting](https://imgur.com/a/LDx21Ur) as a reason to report someone
---
You are right
---
Some people don't want to farm. No offence but why is this so hard to understand? Farming for bullshit points is boring.
---
I dont want to report dcing, I'm talking about survivors right after getting downed
---
Yeah those rank 17 Doctors can be pretty bad... I mean the killer could have tried not tunneling off the hook so much... When I see someone get farmed in front of me I will down the unhooked to strip the other of safe unhook points but leaved them down and go after the unhooker =/
---
Finally, proof that Nea was The Nurse all along.
---
Who says i do it?
---
That's me! A legit 15.
---
Glad to see I am not the only clown main who uses that cosmetic.
---
I am proud of it.
---
You know, instead of making myself look stupid, I could stop assuming your goal is to get someone banned and instead properly read your words.
---
Im gonna give that an oof/10
---
And i said play hillbilly. Can you not read?
---
Are you dumb? That's rude but you still said it right?
---
At least you're honest about it
---
Never heard anybody acknowledge this and it happens to me all the time at rank 1
---
What do you mean "now"?
---
Yes. I remember using iron will and thinking.... why can i hear myself still?! I was so bad I thought it was bugged lol.
---
Swamp, Lerys, Meat Plant
---
Hey, ya gotta start somewhere.
---
Everyone who plays this game picked it up for the first time at some point.
---
I might be late to the party, but hey - I'm here!
---
I switched to GTA V online. I figured the time I spent on DbD is well invested in another game with less of a grind. And yes, I agree. Im burnt out on the game as well. Take care :)
---
Oh, pardon me. I definitely care about your feelings
---
Imagine being such a massive douche
---
I've seen more killer dc's than survivor dc's this event...
---
Yeah, the good thing is he even benefits from it
---
I almost never send negative messages, I try to compliment the killer and other survivors whenever I message them. Personally, I only ever send negative messages whenever someone has a go at me or a Killer did something like camp me to death.
---
I literally take the cheaper perk even if its worse
---
He didnt ask about Hillbilly did he? He was asking about perks on Legion. Can you not read his post? Or do you need some glasses? Pick one smarty pants.
---
&gt;I dont want to report dcing, I'm talking about survivors right after getting downed
---
Which is... DCing...
---
Sometimes I do like you do, sometimes I still play the game but I don‚Äôt tryhard. That means that I don‚Äôt usually kill anyone until they have 1-2 gens left, and I play ‚Äúdumber‚Äù so that I can make the chases longer.
---
Some people like this coffeepozzanyh dude are the legit rank 20s acting like they're better than everyone else. Good on you
---
Oh pardon me that's awfully rude isnt it? Hypocrite lmao.
---
Try again
---
And i said hillbilly. I do not need to answer his question if i don't want to. Would you like some help in your logic classes?
---
I'm definitely not better than anyone else here. But I'm just getting started....lol. ;)
---
You play on PSN LMAO
---
I am competitive and dont really care about points. I like getting a 4k or surviving simply because I like the thrill of the back and forth. It's not like items are that great anymore so I dont see bp as worth much. Depending on the killer there are a few good addons but on the survivor side the only things really worthwhile nowadays seem to be medkits and high level keys.
---
I had a game with 5BPS and got camped my first hook (no BM or anything). I find BPS tend to give killers more motive to be toxic and tunnel/camp. That or DC once the game loads in...
---
Most of the time, I assume it's just the killer being a dick. Case in point, a recent game had the Nurse killer AFK for the first five minutes, then she suddenly came back, downed me, facecamped me and we got disconnected. Seemed like the perfect trifecta of unsportsmanlike behavior. But this one, I don't know. That Hag had literally just obtained her third Devour Hope token. And she was carrying me on her shoulder.  It made no sense for her to pull the plug.
---
When you see these screens where you're the only one who disconnected along with the killer, does it mean they pulled the plug or is it an actual bug?
---
That‚Äôs why I play SWF, lucky enough to usually have a full squad
---
Coming from somebody that said that's rude, your awfully rude yourself. You aren't that smart are you?
---
You can continue to try to shove nonexistent logic down peoples throats and hit your little downvote button all you want. I'm unimpressed.
---
Getting sacrificed is all good, you just carry on. But getting no sacrifices as a killer is just soul crushing.
---
Give up on two generators and set a perimeter around three gens and your ruin. Run corrupt intervention and to herd your survivor into a trap.
---
You really don't have a life, huh?
---
I know I bother you enough to reply to me so as far as im concerned you do care. Try again.
---
You. Your internet is trash
---
I would say, in order:
---
1. The Game
---
2. Yamaoka Estate 
---
3. The Swamp
---
4. Lerys
---
So you can't go down a madness tier, but as the bar is filling up, if you get outside the shock range or w/e, it will drain back down to empty.
---
https://youtu.be/NtlOws-JVEM 
---
These survivors considered this Hag main toxic because he trapped a lot with her ( using your power as a 110% killer is toxic btw ) and because he slugged ( using Knock Out is toxic btw ).
---
Legit never got it higher than 3
---
I never said i don't care LMAOOOO
---
Just proves to me you can't understand basic english
---
Hence the "if". If we HAVE to nerf anything, I think that'd be the safest part to remove.
---
It just fucks every survivor over if someone DCs and its not fun for the killer to wait 20+ mins for a lobby with a ragequitter.
---
No
---
So, say you're standing on the other side of the map from the killer, and the Killer has 8 generators around them, 2 in each cardinal direction, 1 close and 1 far. As long as the Killer is looking in the direction of a generator, it will be illuminated similarly to how a glass bead on a map shows up. Only the closest generator to the killer in that direction is illuminated, though, so you can never use multiple light-ups to triangulate the killer's location.
---
If a Killer knows you have this perk, they will use their FOV intelligently and look at other generators while they approach yours, so you don't have an extra warning that the killer is coming. It would be most effective against killers with low terror radii.
---
Wait am I playing wrong??
---
Im trolling you enough to reply so good enough for me ;)
---
And ragequitting
---
I send them but I hate doing so because it takes a long time and I'm super lazy. If I played on pc then it would have been much easier
---
??? 
---
You‚Äôre wrong.
---
Then why did you ask?
---
Notice my name. 
---
Now notice OPs name.
---
I did do this. Injured. Against a mirror Myers. I deserved it.
---
It‚Äôs one of the worst maps for killer. Still, I‚Äôll take it over Haddonfield any day.
---
This is really cool!
---
Yet survivors complain about a killer running ‚Äúmeta perks‚Äù
---
You actually think i mind replying to you? I don't. Truly, deep deep down in my heart i don't.
---
Yeah, they both suck the fattest part of my ass.
---
This comment chain is super helpful.
---
You are a brave man
---
What?
---
It‚Äôs not you. It‚Äôs the killer.
---
Survivors aren't different like killers(sadly) they only carry the unique teachable perks. Meg, claudette and David King are good survivors to start with. Meg has sprint burst and adrenaline, claudette has self care, David has WGLF and dead hard
---
Tbh, if you make someone rage quit you know you have done your job right.
---
Great investigation
---
Same for me sometimes. I realized the dual view on this meme while making it
---
Ah yes, Playstation. The most archaic gaming system. It's only me and your grandma on their. Dildo
---
I like Ormond cause ‚Äòbloody Claud‚Äôs can‚Äôt hide in plain sight on it
---
Followed by an amazing comment.
---
Seems like we're on a roll here, eh?
---
But no matter how hard I protect it, it always gets cleansed after a minute or two. 
---
Darn totem spawns! ^^^^^^^/s
---
True story.
---
__Notice my name.__
---
__Now notice OPs name.__
---
Being toxic is more than a pallet drop or a killer killing you. Toxic people are just the way they are, sad people who have problems beyond their control and think passing the bad sentiment to another will help them heal. I hope they find help and get sane!
---
Okay, please tell me more. I'm so interested
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
Also add the guys that camp the hatch when there's 1 gen left and his teammate is alive
---
It is similar to Deliverance, but it encourages a different playstyle. Deliverance encourages you to rescue teammates in order to get off the hook, and it also punishes you if you use it early. Cheating Death is impossible to use early in the game, and is much more stealth-focused.
---
Just sounds weird to me because I play a lot of killer particularly trapper and never once depipped on a 3k.  Then again I never camp or tunnel and play to initiate a new chase after every hook so my playstyle fits right in with the rank system.
---
Oh, right lmao
---
Tip: if you hit a survivor as they drop a pallet, the item is stuck under said pallet. It can't be accessed until you break that pallet
---
Bl?
---
This is our way of welcoming you in this flawless, toxic free, perfect game :)
---
Boring killer
---
Lol I get so scared as a survivor my heart rate goes through the roof lol.
---
Okay.
---
lol imagine getting mad at someone telling you the truth
---
i know man :(
---
Welcome to the harder side
---
Ya know, no one really cares. Mods gay.
---
I‚Äôm running WGLF and prove thyself on survivor + 2 perks of choice during the event. Bloody parry streamers 
---
On killer I‚Äôm running beast of prey, thrill of the hunt, distressing, and bbq+chili. 
---
That‚Äôs 100% bonus to hunter and deviousness categories (50% deviousness if all totem or hex is broken)  with bloody party streamers. 
---
I enjoy taking it easy during the bloodhunts.  But I have noticed the same thing while playing,  but I can‚Äôt really blame them cuz how would you know your not going to go up against tryhards yourself?
---
Okay what
---
Right?? I'm farming away all nice, letting people stun, and only hooking people twice, but those greedy fucks have to take away my bonus bonus bloodpoints
---
Remember you‚Äôre playing against humans who are capable of thinking. If they get caught in your trap, you outplayed them. If you place a trap right next to a pallet, that‚Äôs one of the most obvious spots.
---
One of the most underrated aspects of playing Trapper is the mind game potential. You don‚Äôt even have to trap areas sometimes, like obvious spots such as shack, because literally every Trapper traps it. You can also go for the fake to scare a survivor off a loop. Another tip is only trap loops with a grassy circuit. Also trap around the loop, not the pallet. Also, try to ‚Äúherd‚Äù survivors to your traps.
---
The person probably complained about not getting hatch after tbagging you. Keep hookin
---
I don't think I saw him in at least a year. There was a joke years ago when I watched Kripparian playing Hearthstone, ending everything with -rino. So I got it from there. And to be honest you don't have to call him a pedo in here. I don't like offensive garbage in my posts. No reason to talk bad about someone on here. I don't like him anymore aswell but that does not give you the right to shit talk anyone on that low level.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
I was playing doc and I got a triple dc on me bc they were bad and I pulled one off a pallet then *boom boom bomm* all three swf were gone. Gave the last poor guy the hatch. People who quit early game where connection isn‚Äôt an issue are assholes. Idc if you don‚Äôt wanna play against that killer, don‚Äôt ruin it for your teammates.
---
A level lower is people that specifically Disconnect whilst loading into a match during Double BP
---
I think ds is not too annoying but people who complain about noed and ruin and then use ds or another crutch perk, then they are a hypocrite. Both sides have crutch or, if you want to call it, meta perks.
---
Thanks for informing me
---
Pfffthahahahahahahagaaaaaaaaa...
---
If you can hit skill checks technician is useless and the goal is to hit skillchecks. Just practice hitting good skillchecks so you can not worry with technician.
---
I never used it before, now I do, because it punishes killer for tunnelling, and surprise surprise I get to use ds almost every game.
---
I have the right to say what I wish.
---
I'm kinda okay with the 4-flashlights SWF, because it usually means they're going to be fully toxic, swarm me to try and fail flashlight saves, unhook right in front of me, and just not be really efficient at doing gens and winning the game. Usually an easy 3-4K if you don't let them get under your skin.
---
Aaaaaa Boo's siamese twin: Spookster McBoo
---
its common. hide, avoid generators if you hear their terror radius
---
-slightly reduces the mist
---
Oof I'd imagine he would die to the end game collapse every time because he wouldn't be able to decide whether to leave or get more points/stay to possibly make a save.
---
My experience can‚Äôt be bad but I don‚Äôt care about the other 4 people‚Äôs experience waaa :(((
---
The best strategy for me is to get so close that you're touching their back, then charge it to 99%, see if they try to juke, then mow them down. With some practice, it's hard to miss this.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
I wouldn‚Äôt waste you‚Äôre time with this guy, he‚Äôs been arguing with people on this sub for like the past hour lol
---
I don‚Äôt think he has many friends.
---
I feel bad for this shit when I play killer. People who DC r trash cans.
---
Myers needs cowbells dangit.
---
*In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened...*
---
Damn, he better fix that huge gap in his camper, it might get rained on...
---
 ^It's a great piece by the way
---
Imagine being this dense

---
At least on Ormond, Claudette is nerfed. ‚òÉÔ∏è
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
That's just a problem with the kinda shitty game balance at this point. Map balance, perk balance, everything is kinda rather shitty on both ends thus why you need it all on both sides.
---
Balanced landing
---
Tier One, you start off with a tiny radius, but you move slowly and your lunge range is terrible.
---
Tier Two, basically normal killer but with a slightly faster vault speed and a smaller radius.
---
Tier Three (Lasts 60 Seconds), normal radius but you leap very quickly, can one shot down survivors, have a HUGE lunge and move at the speed of light
---
It's not like the killers are the only ones to try hard, I faced survivors who brought insta heals, yellow boxes with brand new parts and all the meta perks survivors prefer.
---
Personally I just play to have fun not caring if I die or what not. Hard to sometimes
---
Leatherface in his natural habitat
---
Yeah, that's why killers are usually so butthurt compared to survivors.
---
Thinking that only a 4K game is a good game is an efficient way to build hatred towards the game. On average, killers should kill around 2 survivors/game.
---
People should aim for a nice BP results, or a good pip/double pip.
---
Good idea. I'll have to practice more
---
Yea and when they finally get you down, they relentlessly move their camera left and right like we get it.
---
Survivors won't stop bringing annoying shit and bullying killers and then they barely get shit for it. That's why killers bring those things like I have level 50 killers with no ebony mori while my level 45 sight have 3 syringes and 2 purple insta heals and a brand new part. Also, what's so bad about iridescent head. They earned it by working for it, let them use it. Survive if you can.
---
Myers does have a better chase potineal then he does.
---
My poiint is that it CAN happen. Not saying it does. I'm looking at just mechinces
---
Is there even a point to prestige besides the clothes. I just don't understand.
---
Just couldn‚Äôt hit those great skill checks could he üòî
---
The badiest part is he is not wrong. Your teammates usually stand around, doing nothing, letting you die, or rushing the hook and everyone getting killed. It's a rare occasion seeing all 3 people doing gens against camper.
---
So theyre actually playing the game? They should be this is why these events suck everyone expects people to allow others to max blood points just play the damn game
---
I can just hear it now, ‚Äúget gud camping baby killer‚Äù
---
Indeed, this is probably a minority issue since most people play on pc but in ps4 its really hard to land them with the low fps, frame drops and other issues
---
It gives you better items.
---
With the event, more people want to play killers since they usually net more BP. Honestly though with the killer wait times, survivor may just be more profitable right now.
---
Hopefully this issue will be limited in the future if they add BP multiplier bonuses to certain roles, similarly to how Uber has surge pricing. If they just offer 1.5-2x BP for survivors when there are too many killers and to killers when there are too many survivors, it should help.
---
You used your killer ability? Tryhard noob. How dare you play the game right.
---
boring
---
So, I'm using up all the cool stuff I have on Myers before prestiging him and just goofing around with them, not really trying. I stumble into a SWF game all bringing BPS, and I got off two EW3 states with Tombstone, but don't catch anyone because I was halfassing it.
---
After two ran out the exit gates, I popped my third EW3 of the match and motion the last two out. While the Kate runs past me I mori her, figuring it wouldn't generate as much salt at the end of the match.
---
The endgame chat was hilarious and wholesome and I'm mad at myself for fucking up the screenshots.
---
You guys were great and I hope we meet again :')
---
What did he say?
---
It depends if they look at him for the full time.
---
Yes. It does need a buff. Because if he loses that he will have 0 way to end a chase or even make use of the exposed effect since he can just get looped to death
---
This is a really cool concept. A killer with an insta-down is usually pretty hard to balance, but this seems like it would work. I have a few questions though.
---
Can you throw the scythe above obstacles, or does it only move parallel to the ground? 
---
If you break the Tainted Soil totem, do you receive any penalty? If you break another hex totem just before, what is the total penalty?
---
Not even normal ones my m8.
---
Selling scam t-shirts. It‚Äôs a company that uploads J-pegs of popular image posts such as these and then ‚Äúsells‚Äù them on t-shirts.
---
Spoiler alert; your T-shirt will never come.
---
I'm saying they shouldnt just nerf him,.
---
It should be for killers to tbag. Survivors tbag as if they are good, then disconnect when they get downed and message you that your bad when they died lol. Killers need some counter toxicity.
---
I mostly play survivor with my friends bug I like seeing a killer who doesn‚Äôt take advantage off the event.
---
I got adept nurse doing a daily &gt;:)
---
its like nurse blinking like wow thats so op!!!

I know I never said it was a bad perk, actually I kinda like the idea but the dude above got his perks mixed up and said ds
---
try and time shocks for when the survivor is about to go for a window or pallet so that they can't interact with it.
---
That‚Äôs very nice of you and depending on the match I generally let most survivors go. Since I don‚Äôt really need bp I don‚Äôt mind.
---
This post is stupid. But anyone who thinks that killers are OP or even the power-side are also stupid so I guess that cancels out.
---
Because the contest ends beforr he comes out??
---
How brain dead do you gotta be
---
Increased chance of higher quality items in your bloodweb and cosmetics to dab on non prestige players
---
&gt;the killer with the worst map control in the game
---
Clown: ***Exists***
---
you‚Äôre unnecessarily both stupid and rude. They‚Äôve announced him and have the PTB open for him so he IS an available character.
---
how brain dead do you gotta be
---
Tell me about it. Already colorblind so auras are barely visible usually. Ormond I have less of a clue where they are than the survivors.
---
It‚Äôs hard dude because there‚Äôs 4 of them. You won‚Äôt get them all on the same page, you just won‚Äôt.
---
But if it‚Äôs one or two, you can down them, pick them up and swing at a generator over and over. They‚Äôll usually get the picture and farm with you if they even want to farm. If they‚Äôre a newb or dumb, they‚Äôll run off and you‚Äôre better off just killing them.
---
People who do that or immediately kill themselves on first hook have a special place in hell as well
---
That's about the only benefit.
---
Except DBD is ridden with visual bugs. When the killer DC's the game is incapable of reacting accordingly. Everyone got their 5k points for survival, but you only see your own score measured accurately.
---
Pick up traps.
---
Place traps.
---
Chase survivors.
---
Done. 
---
You basically just have to decide which area to hold and place your traps into spots where the survivors want to run through.
---
I can only imagine. And they recently fixed it too. It used to be worse!
---
Ye but the fix still I can only see them right in front of me
---
I play PS4, and the frames are pretty bad. Still, it's very hard to miss if you're touching them. If they're a few meters away, however, it's very very hard.
---
It's almost like new players exist in this game or something
---
Then when I actually bring ds no one tunnels me.
---
Doesn't mean anything, the devs told us multiple times it is not a Scream chapter
---
I have no idea but honestly people will ‚Äúreport‚Äù people over legit anything. Don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
Hahaha - same here. I'll literally message everyone, and they STILL gen rush and open the gates immediately.
---
Like, DUUUHHHHHH
---
It really helps to just take stuff in stride and not take the game too seriously.
---
Getting facecamped? Browse reddit. Survivors teabagging or insulting you in endgame chat? Just send them a gg and a smiley, since those types usually want to rile you up and get angry if they fail. Then move on. At the end of the day you can always just turn off the game and watch some Netflix or read a book or something. It's not worth it to get upset over some random dicks across the globe from you.
---
When I notice that I start getting frustrated by the game I usually just stop for the day. I don't have enough free time to spend it getting angry.
---
I know it‚Äôs kind of weird
---
Well if the gates are open it‚Äôs fair. Ur name though ...
---
Not a legit strategy but survivors aren't entitled to shit. Survivors want to tbag, then get downed, disconnect, then say you tunneled them when they were the first person you found. I don't think face camping is the answer but all the complaints about op killers and then getting mad when killers have a problem is pathetic. Survivors disconnect and try strats they saw on noob3 and then complain that someone like wraith is op lol. Everything thing survivors bring is allowed for everyone but if a killer brings a mori, babies dc.
---
Ghostface is fun to play as and against, I'm so happy he's no longer a joke.
---
PERFECT MEMEüëå
---
I havent played him since the change, but I've seen videos. I think its great! I can't wait to start playing him.
---
We need another strong killer. I'm tired of always seeing nurses and Billys.
---
Your flair suggests you play spirit, so I will chip in that I dont like stridor on her, it makes them sound closer than they are. Personal opinion though.
---
And not a single gen was done
---
But it can‚Äôt be a joke on the name if it isn‚Äôt the name
---
Yea you got super outplayed. Plague wrecked you there. Just accept it.
---
Wow someone is salty
---
Ptb=isnt released yet
---
And if in the rules they stated all licensed killers why would ghostface a licensed killer be an exception???
---
Seriously tell me op, you are soo brain ded that you lost common sence
---
It lets you re-roll your perks which can be nice since the first few levels go by pretty quick if you have a lot of BPs saved
---
Yayayayaya cause nurse/Billy/spirit only "stand a chance" against survivors. Even better, nurse only "stands a chance against survivors" Need to work on that trolling a bit more
---
Surprisingly, I haven't gotten camped yet. I don't understand the motive anyway, as it hurts your score.
---
As a PS4 survivor and killer player, I can completely agree with this. Most of the killers get salty as hell if you do the smallest thing like head nodding, but survivors do as well. Thank God I‚Äôm not like that. 
---
Like if I look left and right after downing somebody and it looks like I‚Äôm shaking my head ‚Äúno‚Äù then the guy‚Äôs probably gonna disconnect. As much as I love playstation man, Dead By Daylight is one of those games where I think it‚Äôs best to be played on PC :)
---
It can be a really good perk on Myers as well.
---
I am, because I actually deliver my quips with a syntax that doesn‚Äôt suck.
---
shhhhh
---
So is getting sacrificed 2 mins into the game while not being able to do anything the whole time. All in the name of killing the "weakest" player.
---
I have a hard time hearing the grunts of pain so I want stridor as a kind of fix for that.
---
I had a pig game yesterday where she crouched around and ‚Äúhelped‚Äù us do gens lol. She let us go. This is how the bloodhunt should be people! Just killers and survivors helping each other out for some points. You don‚Äôt have to farm, just don‚Äôt be a complete toxic asshole
---
I run Bond on every build I can. Self-Care is so slow that I prefer to bring a Medkit or use Bond to find a friend. Bond gives so much information, I can‚Äôt attest to its value enough. Hand downs, my favorite Survivor perk.
---
Dead Hard isn‚Äôt bad but I‚Äôd give Balanced Landing a try. Experienced killers often anticipate Dead Hard these days though it can still sometimes help you get to that pallet or vault point. But there are a lot of maps with center-of-the-map gens located near hills or 2Fs. With Balanced Landing, you can usually crank those out fairly confidently so you aren‚Äôt stuck with the final 3 gens as clustered together. 
---
We‚Äôll Make It + Empathy are wonderful if you like healing friends. It‚Äôs lasts for so long and if you can signal your rescuees to let you heal them at the hook, you‚Äôll have a huge advantage in time. 
---
Dance With Me is also quite useful with BL if you can get a 2F window vault.
---
Kindred + Open-Handed can be beastly as well. I am a huge Kindred fan and if you get a squad running Kindred and someone with Open-Handed, everyone can optimize their time so much better and the range of a ‚Äúcampy‚Äù killer is amazing. If you consider that someone is usually on a hook for at least half the game, this is a combination that will be useful throughout a long game. 
---
Other than that, I like Spine Chill, Borrowed Time, Prove Thyself, and Small Game.
---
Never said I didn't get outplayed lmao she predicted me all too well... Just said the ability is OP
---
To every single Console Nurse I‚Äôve ever met, apart from this one that face camped one of the survivors to death on first hook (didn‚Äôt send them hatemail, though.  Just moved on.)  Console Nurses deserve all the encouragement they can get!

HITBOXES AND HIT REGISTRATION
---
One of the most reported issue on the game now is the way the game handles hit registration and hitboxes. We investigated to find what was the cause of this issue and we found that the main culprit was different instances of desynchronization. Desynchronization can be caused by input lag, animation issues, registration issues as well as user lag. This is the core of this issue and migrating to dedicated servers will give us the tools to handle hit registration better. 
---
Being hit through the window is by design. A window is an opened element and killers should be able to reach through it. Players suffering from desynchronization issues will have the feeling that they are getting hit through the window when they are much further away. 
---
Desynchronization problems are not all that we have found. We also realized that some of our killers hit animations were not matching the attack cone which created the impression that the hit should not have registered when in fact, it did (or vice-versa). We have reviewed most of the animations and the adjustments will be released in the next update. This is the first step of our upcoming work on hit registration.

Think before you type. They listed off the licensed killers that exclusively aren't eligible. Don't go to someone's post telling them they're brain-dead and expect to not be proved wrong. The brain-dead one here is the one who says "the contest ends before he comes out" and can't spell for his side of the argument. The contest ends the 21st, Ghostface is released on the 18th. All players know about him, and he is an available killer to play. Read and think before you type, and be sure to proofread so you don't appear as an autistic kid at a petting zoo.

I mean yeah but still, it would make the game better without it, would it not?
---
You should‚Äôve crouched

Had that yesterday, called me a noob loser, and I just laughed and wished them a day as nice as they are.
---
Like... You were so skilled to beat a mirror Myers on fucking Coldwind, you're gods amongst us mere mortals. Some people are just weird.
---
Technician would be good tier if it's sped up your repair speed but it only makes the generators quieter while you're on it. it could maybe be good if everyone was running it and 4-manning the generators because then they would be so quiet the killer wouldn't even hear it he would have to see survivors on the generator to know it's being worked on
---
*Depressed oink*
---
Unlikely but not impossible.
---
Even though it almost definitely wasn't, it could have just been very unfortunate.
---
Yeah i figured, that's fine
---
No. You don‚Äôt gain additional BPs, you just reach the cap of each category faster. Survivors will wreck you if you are using garbage perks.
---
Holy shit you've cracked the case. How did you ever manage to do that?
---
Very well said.
---
As a survivor i always love it when the killer shakes his head. It really makes my day if survivor and killer are communicating.
---
Yeaaaaaah no
---
Well it says it gives you a higher chance of getting better items/perks but I do so I dont get that feeling of "hmmm  even though I have everything, I should prestige". But it's different for everyone honestly for me its completion of maxing out. The only major benefit for a survivor would be P3 claud in auto camo mode.
---
This was fun to watch....LOL
---
Every time I use a Bloody Party Streamer, max boldness and less than 500 in everything else.
---
Billy is considered the best killer, Billy have a terror radius so you can hide from him, Ghostface don't. Billy have to rev his chainsaw and aim it at a survivor which could miss, Ghostface just have to land a regular hit. He's like if Billy had NOED from start to finish.
---
A window is a large whole in a wall. You just put your entire body through it. It makes sense the killer cam reach through it.

Thats cool

Gah, I've got to unlock that. Thanks for the tip!

And yes you misunderstood it, but if you had some common sence you eould realise why no one has posted yet, but nahh better make a useless reddit post instead!! Genius!
---
Ooohhh, I just got what you said lmao. You can clearly see that no I am not... I only have 3 pages of perks and the perks themselves are clearly not in the kyf order.
---
\*ZING\*
---
I definitely think something should be done to help hooked Survivors a little, even if just a bonus chunk of Altruism points if a hooked survivor enters the Struggle phase from their 1st hook.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what more could be done to punish killers as it is technically a legit strategy and they do get punished by lower BP gains while the other survivors get a bunch of crap done. I‚Äôd be interested though if there was a way to track facecamping killers, like in terms of radius to the hook. Many facecampers say they do it because they have a daily to get X Sacrifices with that killer. Maybe it shouldn‚Äôt count if they were within a certain radius for a certain length of time? I dunno just thinking here. I totally get the frustration but I can‚Äôt say I personally see it happen enough to be that upset about it.
---
How much you get?
---
Dude you‚Äôre so dumb it hurts to reply to you. You‚Äôre ‚Äúnot crying‚Äù but you are literally on Reddit calling an ability and ranged killers OP. What kind of responses are looking for here? Either you‚Äôre gonna have people defend it or other survivors just as dumb as you are validating your nooby opinion?

Wait did I read this correctly? Pallets come back after being broken?
---
No such thing as other languages, no one actually speaks them.

Also you didn‚Äôt even link to the other sub correctly. 
---
I was asking for other people‚Äôs opinions, not for a waste of brain cells with a useless argument. Go be a cunt elsewhere.
---
When I said max out I was talking oof reaching the cap.  Reaching the cap means your making max bloodpoints in that category every match, regardless of the skill of
---
The survivor. My aim is not to ‚Äúwin‚Äù or 4K each game during the bloodhunt.  My aim is to continually make a decent chunk of BP each match even when going up against good survivors. 
---
For example,  good survivors will win chases against you more consistently,  with 100% bonus bloodpoints you will max hunter category with fewer chases,  so even if you get destroyed, you make Bp for the bloodhunt.

I'm sure I've got a screen shot somewhere, I'll see if I can find it. Must have been a couple hundred thousand.
---
Working with the killer to ruin the game for others IS  bannable. Farming is NOT bannable. 
---
Shocking everyone but making no attempt to kill them is farming.
---
A survivor farming everyone off hook then the killer  killing everyone but letting that survivor live is bannable.
---
If a 4 man lets you kill some of them when farmign it's not bannable I don't think
---
Haunted Grounds at the very least for funsies. Then standard, id say. BBQ, MYC, Nurses, Whispers, all solid choices.
---
Dont run ruin tho, people wont immediatly cleanse if its not ruin, which should give you a head start on tokens.
---
You're getting so upset over someones opinion online lmfao... I just found the clip funny so I posted it on reddit. Jesus you must be fun at parties. I couldn't really give a shit whether people agree with me or not cause the clip was just highlighting the sick prediction on the plagues part not a cry or a rant. We get it you must obviously be a fucking god at the game and everyone that isn't you is complete dogshit but if you could stop being a humourless cunt that would be greatly appreciated.
---
Are you saying something is wrong with the level design or honestly admiring it?
---
What‚Äôs the matter with it?
---
It‚Äôs basically focusing down on one survivor for the entire match
---
Lol the realness I'd insane. Even shows pussy disconnectors
---
Not OP but I think it‚Äôs still a little buggy but that will prob be fixed he‚Äôs a great killer and I‚Äôll be playing as him a lot
---
Solid advice &lt;3
---
It is, lol
---
The fact that you think a video games and real life are anything a like just hurts my brain
---
He's not supposed to be the same. His ability is supposed to be based on stealth. For the ability to work at point-blank range in a chase defeats the idea.
---
Source?
---
I mean, during end game collapse I don't leave the hook. I don't face camp like this guy is doing but I patrol the general area,never having it out of my sight for long. It's better to guard a hooked survivor end game than it is to leave the hook just to get T bagged.
---
These poll results seem based more on physical attraction than actual gameplay.
---
I noticed that as well it would make since if it was dedicated servers but ya it‚Äôs not. Maybe preparing or something idk
---
I think double pallets?
---
Prepare your mind and soul to be torn apart by half of the community
---
Nurse seems pretty fun, also I love her design, but I've yet to actually try and use her since a daily hasn't come up and I'm trying to level other people for their perks.
---
Garb killer. According to the survivor handbook rule #47 you are not aloud to use your power on a survivor. Doing so makes you a noob and means your bad
---
If you don't want to farm you can just dc.
---
Damn it, just after I was fired from the Pun Patrol?
---
Oh boy sure looking forward to it
---
I kinda wanna see a combination of Furtive Chase + Rancor. I can only imagine the chaos when you go for a end game save, then BOOM you're now the obsession and can be killed instantly.
---
Ooooohhhj I didn‚Äôt see it at first. (Cause of mist.) I‚Äôve only ever seen one, and it only as recently. I started playing post spirit/pre legion, so I never experienced the pre clown pallet game.
---
Fair enough man, run whatever build you want. I was just letting you know running those perks is pretty much redundant for the purpose of earning BPs. I‚Äôm not sure why you even bothered to ask for opinions if you had your mind set already though.
---
Also fuck y‚Äôall body blockin flashlight mains bullying my noob ass
---
Thx for the idea lol
---
I played against an infinite tier three Michael on the first day, idk if it was to upset us or if they were just having fun with an add-on they got from the bloodhunt bonus, but yeah I concluded they were just having fun and not trying to upset people so I was fine with it

Why would they report me for 0 skill

happy cake day &lt;3
---
Not the point, higher stakes=higher frustration levels because everyone is trying harder, I'm fine if you use ruin just don't intentionally go all out with the purpose of trying to make people upset
---
I can appreciate your feedback and disagree with it. 
---
I understand ruin gives you more time to make more Bp,  I just think that having perks that gives you more for doing less means you don‚Äôt need more time to get it. 
---
It‚Äôs also rank reset, I‚Äôve went up against some pretty bad players recently.  Like what were those survivors thinking in the video?  I literally had to take it easy on them or I would have gotten like no Bp. 
---
Thanks for the discussion though
---
well for one the swamp is to P3Claudette what Zubat is to a cave...
---
I played against you pretty sure , i remember being the only one without a hex name and everybody else including the killer had one lol. It was a plague too
---
That's the same thing survivors do when a killer uses anyone except hag and wraith and even then there are complaints. Also if a killer uses an add on that they earned.
---
As a survivor,look behind you in a chase  instead of looking forward.
---
Love this!
---
I‚Äôm fairly new myself. One of the only things I can say is do your best and no matter what happens at the end of the game, like the guy said above me, be prepared to have some salty ass players/comments
---
Harder Mikey!
---
Uh ok that isn't relevant to the discussion really.
---
Ranking in this game sucks, i‚Äôm high ranked for both survivor and killer but always get placed with at least one majorly low rank. It‚Äôs just something that sucks about the ranking system as of late.  Most people play claudette for self care and for the fact she can be hard to see on some maps. If I were you I would pick a killer after trying all the ones available to you out and see which play style you like best. Get each killer up to level 40 over time to get teachable perks, there are ones that help with tracking.
---
[Click Me To Learn! &lt;3](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Autodidact)

Absolutely me. I‚Äôm not a console player so I don‚Äôt have that excuse, I‚Äôm just garbage with Nurse. I can play pretty much every other killer with some modicum of competence but if I see a Nurse daily I dumpster that thing as fast as I can.
---
Oh my god, you're right, it's almost as if all survivors are sensible and don't get angry and the smallest or logical thing. I can't believe they would report you because they felt mad.
---
Honestly, I main survivor too and sometimes it's hard to not send a salty message. It's just because we don't like the play style, but it doesn't mean it's wrong.
---
This is very true 
---
I think people get salty because alot of times you're almost winning then you suddenly lose 
---
Like having 4 MOM users at the end or noed or ds before the nerf 
---
It gets really fristrating and people want a way to feel better , so they get salty
---
They have it in there working with the opposite side to gain an advantage or grief teammates  or targetting specific players to ruin the game for them is bannable
---
it's about how you lose. Being stuck at rank 16-20s cause of toxic smurfing Killers facecamping every game back then was a reason to be mad. You got 4000 a game. Then whenever you had a teammate that knew how to loop they'd quit out like bitches.
---
That's... that is exactly what I was saying. I have no idea where you could have misunderstood me, but I'll elaborate-
---
Dead by Daylight's Ghostface (or, well, The Ghost Face), is a guy called Danny Johnson; an original character that is completely unrelated to the Scream franchise and has been created for Dead by Daylight only.
---
The Entity took him into its realms in the summer of 1993. That is before smartphones were invented. He probably also has no access to newer technology in the realms of the Entity, and could only take with him what he had in his life in the real world. Thus, he uses a digital camera during his mori animation.
---
I recently got 100k bloodpoints as doctor with only 2 kills.
---
At least he's 115%
---
i wasn‚Äôt the one who messaged him first it was my friend who sent me it
---
I can honestly say id just play pig , down someone. Hook em and then just teabag people during chases for dem bloodpoints, too bad im out of town right during the bloodhunt
---
The reason why this happens is because double blood points (and new killer releases) bring back all the people who don't normally play often. The people who don't play as often are much more likely to not give a shit about their playstyle, and think that tunneling and camping is how the game is meant to be played. Either that, or people just want you to suffer during double blood points
---
Camping killers are usually smurfers too which is why camping is effective for them. Gens won't get done unless you do 3-4 of them and new survivors have no idea what flailing your arm on hook means.
---
Yeah this almost never happens. I have never seen it in game so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of a deal.
---
Dm me i really want to know
---
This is a repost. There's already one made for both sides. Just use the search bar.
---
Wraith isnt actually that bad. Get gets a bad rap but he has certain ply styles that are viable.
---
Between this and clear regent im always getting this
---
Get david if survivor or bubba if killer. Concentrate on getting those stacks!
---
Same with new killer releases too :(
---
Killers i could see maybe being bothered by it. If theyre not very good. Survivors i cant see being opposed to it since it counters some maps having entire stretches without a pallet in sight.
---
He's not even wrong
---
If its a Michael, I point his way then run off lol if you dont catch the hint then thats all on you big fella
---
Shrine changes at Midnight UTC. 
---
The killer will likely be released at 4 PM UTC.
---
I thought it was LEGION wtf happened
---
I wish everytime you make the killer miss a hit you get rewarded with bloodpoints. I can stall for the entire match and end up only earning 10k.
---
It looks like it's because you're a fun cunt
---
This isn't a repost, I made the two guides you are talking about. This is a new one I did last night.

I was able to buy all 4 shrine perks for BP when the new killers came out plus the next 4 when it reset. The shrine resets Tuesday around 8pm est. New dlc usually comes sometime after 1ish on Tuesday.

---
I have no clue. Unless it was like a ‚Äúoh my gosh you suck so much you‚Äôre not even level 1 you‚Äôre level 0‚Äù kind of thing, lol I‚Äôm not sure sorry.
---
I prefer lullaby because it's more low priority for survivors to go find, and at high stacks it makes unnerving presence and overcharge a lot stronger. Hex ruin is better at the start of the game so it's up to your preference :)
---
Instasaw is rare and you can still get out of the way of it, you hear him and his terror radius when he goes across map. Killers lunge have auto aim so it's way easier to land than chainsaw.
---
Not bad advise but number 3 is iffy. Even though it's a great point, I can't completely blame a person if they suicide on the hook. It's boring to just sit there so why not leave and go into a another game, or an entirely different game altogether like civ 5 or something less frustrating in general.
---
They changed him. That's it.
---
Then survivors cry why they only Face nurse, Billy and Spirit
---
I do it all the time as pig it is so fun to just sit at a gen spaming the ambush attack
---
I can understand being upset at a loss. You wanted it and you tried 
---
 maybe lost a good offering or add on you don't have more of.
---
It's being called garbage by someone that wins I don't follow the logic on. Maybe I'm trying different perks or add ons. Maybe I'm not great on that map. Maybe I just want to get my daily with the killer. 
---
If you could block chat from certain people in that instance it might go a ways to help. Assign personal rankings or characteristics tied to an account. Don't block the account from gameplay but let you know that maybe you just want to leave someone on the hook or slugged. It could screw up games when the nearest person is someone you've been rude to but could over time help them to be less awful people in light of their bleeding out.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind if the other survivors didn‚Äôt keep running away from gens and then staying away from them.  I end up running around the whole map twice and the gens haven‚Äôt been touched.  But I see 2 totems broken but no audio cue of them being hexes üòÇ
---
Doctor torture build? Yeah no idea why they didnt like that...
---
"Doing the objective because the killer can't apply enough pressure to all 4 survivors"
---
Now this is what good job all about
---
Daaaamn I didn't think about that. That's sick.
---
I understand that but I grew up in a competitive household so the phrase ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a game‚Äù makes me want to win even more
---
i did this yesterday ;)
---
You need to readd thoughtful Thursday, it was one of the only days I actually enjoyed going on this subreddit. We need stricter meme guidelines again as most of them don't contain any dbd reference, an example being "when you" posts and then a random picture of probably spongebob. Or memes with no caption but the title is the caption. They need to be removed, images of someone wearing a killer mask or something with titles like new killer confirmed, or new skin leaked need to be stopped too.
---
I get it people like memes and that's fine. But they really do flood this subreddit and it's hard to find the discussion posts that I really do enjoy reading. Even some people don't flair as memes so meme less mode doesn't even work for me sometimes.
---
Then you hear a hidden blade...
---
Have u tried Gen protector? Surveillance, Pop Goes the Weasel, Discordance, Hex ruin :3
---
First I didn‚Äôt bitch about gen rushing in my comment so tell me where you got that from. 
---
‚ÄúIf you focus on one survivor, that gives the other survivors ample time to "gen rush" you‚Äù
---
Ok so if I went for the healthy one wouldn‚Äôt that do the same give them time to do generators but double the time to take them down?
---
fuuuck. or you turn around and see big boi myers staring a hole through you.
---
Just as some background info, according to the devs, double pallets do still appear when the game cannot place any more pallets according to the regular rules, but the minimum number of pallets for that map has not been reached yet. Then the game has to violate the rules for the last pallet placements. When you see a double pallet, this also means that you get as few pallets on the map as possible.
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again: If you hook somebody and you know for a fact that there are other Survivors in the area, the only way to play fair is to go find the corner that's furthest away from the hook, face it, and count to 100. Everything else and a Salty Survivor‚Ñ¢ just might start to tear up, and we don't want that now, do we?
---
What I mean is, if a player has 2000 hours worth of character progression and the devs double blood points permanently then he only has 1000 hours worth of progression relatively. I know I‚Äôm the minority in thinking this way but I find it frustrating. For example in destiny 2 After you reached power level 265 or something you could only level up from weekly challenges. After the dlc was released tou could increase your power level up to 300 by doing anything, making my power level, that I spent 30 hours getting, attainable in 3 hours.
---
Look at the opening where the pallet would be
---
And what will be left off you is food for the other half.
---
I honestly don't understand why people get really angry about not getting a 4k all the time. For me, 3k is a win and 2k is a tie. I don't mind getting 3ks a lot, it's still a win for me.
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre a hag main because she attacks with her hand.
---
Lmao I agree, I had survivors teabagging me after dropping pallets.  Then once I got a hook, I realized they would hide close by and unhook quickly.  Soooooo... I walked away, then immediately turned around.  I would down one and injure the other.  
---
Then I get hate messages I camped and get good... 
---
Ummmmm no you had a plan and I shitted on your plan.  You‚Äôre just upset you couldn‚Äôt teabag and escape.  
---
It‚Äôs just a game.  Blame your teammates that couldn‚Äôt finish gens while I‚Äôm killing y‚Äôall
---
&gt;a slugging Tombstone Myers
---
This sounds like a ridiculous challenge
---
Is it just me, or is it when you play killer with a hex(es) they spawn close to your spawn most of the time?
---
if the trap is activated then it will blow up if he tries to go out the gate it is not a coincidence
---
I wanted to main clown, since I heard he could cut off survivors' hand during his mori, but it turned out to be only fingers. Amateur.
---
Hag 1love
---
&gt; tuft of hair and tombstone piece
---
I honestly think Evil Incarnate is the hardest achievement in the game to get (vs good survivors).
---
Switching up who you are going for causes them to need to heal and puts pressure on the people doing gens. The more people you mess with, the less people on gens, the more people that need to heal/help.
---
Whenever there is a tunnel killer against me and my friends, the one getting tunneled loops him for all the gens because the killer is not pressuring the rest of the team.
---
Well you know what they say about big feet
---
Fun thing that happened to me yesterday: We spawned on Blackwater swamp, the one map with the bigass boat, I believe. So basically I'm going around, go up the boat since I hear nothing and spine chill isn't going hay and I thought I heard other survivors up there. So I see the gen, right? Well, it's running, maybe like 5% done. Nobody is anywhere to be seen, but no one seems to be in a chase either, still no audio cues that the killer might be near, no spine chill. 
---
"Huh, why did they leave this gen here?" I say out loud as I start repairing the gen. I'm repairing it for a good few seconds when I decide to spin the camera to look around. That's when I nearly get a heart attack. The goiddamn white-faced dull-eyed fecker is right there. Right behind me, just stalking me like a paparazzi. That's why they left the gen.
---
It was actually really funny how he was just standing there and I was repairing that gen for like, I don't know, good ten seconds before I noticed him. Must have been hilarious to the killer
---
I had to take a break from DBD because of this.  I know I'm not supposed to 2-4k every game, or escape every game. 
---
But I feel so competitive I feel like I should.   And every time I get caught, or someone slips away, I was wracking my brain trying to figure out where I messed up -- And it was making me salty thinking that someone else was just plain better than me.  I know that isn't a healthy mindset,  so it's break time from DBD.  
---
And it's sad, because I love this game.
---
Probably because of overcharge and sloppy instead of huntress lullaby and thrill of the hunt. 
---
That should fix it.
---
I wish i was a nice killer, but then I start laughing like the Doctor when he gets hit by a pallet and proceed to get the 4K.
---
Pig‚Äôs always have noed too it‚Äôs a well known fact
---
As I said BBQ and WGLF are the only ones I consider real BP perks. Other just makes it faster and are useless.They dont increase the max BP you get.
---
Killer needs git gud
---
Couldn't play hearthstone because of this. The RNG lvl of drawing the right cards / starting hand isn't enough, huge RNG chance on cards themselves too. It wasn't fun.
---
TOTH is as good as we're going to live forever (or whatever it's name is, that perk where you get 100% more altruistic bp after saving a surv when the gates open)
---
Ok dude... I can get kills without camping and tunneling it's very possible.. I'm all about getting the most points..
---
not a rule more if ya want to feel pity on them especially if its a low ranker/new player if not fuck em
---
It‚Äôs not a rule but it‚Äôs a kind gesture do it if you want or don‚Äôt
---
I think everyone's just pissed about that 'breaking out of stealth' thingy, cuz even if you're literally staring at him the entire time from like 3 metres in front of him he can continue stalking you.
---
I bet OP was not expecting the responses given
---
Had a clown game yesterday where he went tryhard and camped + tunneled even when someone dc‚Äôed at the start of the match. Double bp weekend am I right? ü§™

Here are [screenshots](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/458016432043851777/589912091587117065/image0.png) from one of the survivors
---
He said ‚Äúit‚Äôs my job to kill you idc how I do it or how you feel‚Äù
---
&gt;Is there one coming 
---
Yes.
---
&gt;is there any news on it?
---
PC
---
There's an event but that's about all we know, no specifics
---
I only got the game in January, and at the beginning I mistook the Pig for Claudette a few times
---
&gt;Is Pig cute?
---
Stop asking yourself easy questions to try and make yourself look smart
---
I don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôm supposed to kill... so...? I didn‚Äôt camp
---
I think the commenter was just joking about having tough matches and not equating ruin to that but I might be wrong \\_(O-O)_/
---
Great to see that these addons worked out in at least some way
---
i mean if you teabag or emote at a pallet of course i won't let you have fun. hypocrites
---
I still hate this rank system. As a new player, it really crushes my enthusiasm to already be at rank 13 and absolutely getting crushed as Killer by a team of loopers with MoM.
---
ones your in his dream world hes just a regular killer just try to wake up ASAP
---
Wait, dailies don‚Äôt autocomplete if you don‚Äôt claim them?
---
Also when killer instantly closes their app on ps4 during loading screen when they see a BPS offered by survivors.
---
Do I have to rely on a survivor to wake me up or can I do it myself?
---
The worst is when you run pallets with 2-3 of them for a while and when they get to 1 gen left they all ghost you and get super sweaty blocking hits. You get like 2 hooks for the entire match and they get fewer points than if they just let you have your biggest point events too.  
---
Now I bring a red Mori. If you offer to farm and take advantage of me, your friends can't save you by crouching around the hook.
---
What's a "kido"? Is that like a different variant of the keto diet? Or is it a Pokemon?
---
You you're a child a kid...
---
I barely ever get salt in my post game chat when I'm a killer so I dunno what that says c:
---
what terrible fucking survivors
---
Lmao, i got it in march in my account, (was playing it since 2016 with the familiar lend or sumthing like that from a friends account) and i gotta say its pretty scary when you are new to the game and a crouching pig rkos yo booty out of nowhere, i loved how she could teabag so i bought the pig bundle and michaels when the discount shower started this year, love the game lol
---
Failed skill checks from either healing or gens will wake you up. It's more reliable to have another survivor wake you tho.
---
Also if he hooks you you'll automatically wake up. And if you're slugged and someone heals you fully you will also wake up.
---
Only if you Mori ASAP since it usually halves the amount of Malicious, Chaser, and Sacrifice points you can get.
---
It's better to hook them twice and then Mori, so you can get four hits, two successful chases, and two hook events before killing them. Of course that gives them more of a chance to escape, but that's just the way the Emblem system works right now.
---
Nice to see three of my mains in the top 5  :)
---
Wow, I wasnt expecting so many details, a lot of items here that I see familiar in the game. Great work!
---
He looks handsome!!!
---
If I'm the only survivor alive is it possible to wake up?
---
You wake yourself up by missing a skillcheck (when you heal your self or when repairing a generator) or when a teammate performs the 'wake up' action on you (which is like a healing action).
---
"It's not that i'm bad, clearly the other side is way to over powered" :V
---
Glad to hear
---
I can agree with this 100%. But it doesnt help going into your next match after your last 15 are all killers camping and running the same ruin nurses noed bbq combo. I was rank 1 killer and survivor before the update and the toxicity is pretty overwhelming right now. The devs really need to do something about it and quickly.
---
Too overpowered or too weak?
---
Most shit is broken on PS4 anyway. Hitboxes, vaulting is near to impossible without getting hit 99% of the time. The killer has to be 10002002383829 meters away from you in order for me to vault and NOT be hit for fucking once. 
---
Dead Heard? I try to time it with the killer‚Äôs swing. Always get down. Always. 
---
Shit game. Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm hooked to such a garbage laggy game. My standards must be fucking low or something.
---
The fucking Ace crawling through her corpse is hilarious.
---
What was the post game chat like lol?
---
The exposed status effect doesn't do anything for *all* killers if they can't hit the survivor. What's your point?
---
Tends to get used more often to refer to "I was injured and you kept chasing me, that's tunneling".
---
Only if you've fail a skill check. Although he can see your aura and you are probably doomed.
---
Which I usually laugh cause how can you lose as the killer. You don't, so might as well have fun with it!
---
how the fuck does that book wo
---
Thought so he triggered an endgame collapse. So there was no way of winning.
---
Must have been the wind
---
Quality post, thank you good sir.
---
and then she got facecamped for game
---
Only prestige if you want the bloody clothes. You don‚Äôt get any other benefit
---
Sometimes I do this when a gen is about 90% complete and someone else is working on it so I assume they will finish it while I get a bit of progress started on another gen. probably not a good strategy though idk
---
(Killer main)
---
Agreed!
---
Especially when 3 teammates hang around the hook without helping, forcing the killer to chase them around the hook, it sucks for the hooked survivor.
---
Nice to see my main in top 3, sadly not from the loved side though
---
But I can get my perks back?
---
I constantly step in traps with the thought that ‚Äúoh they wouldn‚Äôt put it there, that‚Äôs too obvious EVERYONE knows that spot they‚Äôd put it somewhere less obvious‚Äù
---
*and then I step into a trap in that very same obvious area*
---
It's a very solid perk and can be very frustrating for the Killer if the Survivor is also running Sole Survivor. Just because it requires actual skill to use instead of being a second chance perk doesn't mean it sucks.
---
It was in the Shrine last week, you should've got it! It has saved me so many times since.
---
its a claudette, what do you expect
---
Lol
---
Object doesn't suck lol. It's no Dead Hard but it's certainly not a bad perk
---
What‚Äôs wrong with killing yourself on first hook?
---
Don‚Äôt know why it surprises me people still do shit like this
---
I rarely use ebonies unless I need a kill for a daily and don't want to chance it, but I will take no guff for using Devour Hope. If you don't destroy it after I've gotten to Exposed tier then it's your own fault.
---
They pretty much every single one that has exposed either has a way to hit them easier, gets another benfit from their power, or has it more often/easier to access. 
---
Ghostface does not.
---
I noticed that as well.
---
Either right on top of you, or literally the other end of the map.
---
No it was a regular game i just didn‚Äôt know what happened cus i was laughing so hard

I know! Lol

Yeah, I'm glad my friend got it me for my birthday, it's been great so far. I don't really play killer, but out of the DLC's I will buy Myers one day!
---
I remember my first ever game was against the Wraith. I had no idea what I was doing and he uncloaked next to me and I crapped myself
---
Those survivors were being way too altruistic
---
Same bro, I feel you
---
The survivors are to, i play legion (no shame) and half the survivors don‚Äôt know that legion can vault pallets and windows.
---
Yeah but you don‚Äôt have any benefit from prestige other than the bloody clothes. You can unlock every skill without going prestige. Just wanted to let you know
---
Holy broken English, Batman!
---
Yeah but to be fair, the amount of BP you ended up with doesnt make it right to be tunneled and camped. Especially when it was by someone harassing you irl. I just had 15 matches b2b of ruin noed nurses bbq. Every killer tunneled and camped me. Its getting fucking old man. I cant even fight it. Im going into the match with decisive deadhard small game and selfcare and it doesn't help for shit. I hope the devs are seeing these situations and realize survivors are far from OP.
---
I'm on console so no chat sadly
---
You forgot the most important part of his power: He can teleport between gens
---
What ever happened to being respectful about people having differing opinions? You're acting like people who have different opinions in a videogame are the most evil people in the world holy fuxking shit chill dude...

Hex: Windows Update. That which was supposed to improve you destroys you- Every time a survivor is pulled off the hook, their movement speed slows down by 5% for 10/12/15 seconds.
---
Haha i like to get to 1m then spend it all, now im gonna spend some to get all my perks on survivor then il grind to get 1m for ghost face
---
I understand farming and sandbagging. But how does Tbagging hurt at all. They‚Äôre literally just pressing Cntrl. üôÑ.
---
As a Killer, when I experience this, I'll hook that David because BBQ, but then I'll tunnel and face camp the Claudette, and usually let everyone else go.
---
Oh God, that would scare me to death :D But as a sort-of Myers main... yes, he was most likely laughing his ass off lmao. I know for me that's always the most hilarious part.
---
You are basically helping the killer a lot which is something you shouldn't do as a survivor obviously.
---
Lmao, I had someone try to do that yesterday when I was Legion. Jokes on him, I read his play and downed him right next to hatch, closing it right in his face.
---
"Game Over"
---
Just played a game with 5BPS against a facecamping insidous, and that silent phase addon. only my frienddied and we all got out with 9k points. She got 2k and we asked why, she said some racial slurs and left.
---
One of the times where facecamping is acceptable
---
This made me miss bbq invitations
---
Ah yes, I see the wraith that you added in the trees. Nice touch
---
If you've killed 3, you should start looking for the hatch at that point. You can close it, preventing the survivor from escaping by jumping in. Then they have to open an exit gate, which takes time (I think it's 15 seconds now). patrolling between the two exit gates will give you a better chance at finding the last guy before he gets out. There are lots of perks that give information as well like BBQ or whispers.  
---
On the other hand, as someone who has played both survivor and killer extensively, I would say if you've gotten the 3k you've already won. This isn't something that's agreed upon by everyone, but the game has to be balanced around the survivors escaping roughly 50% of the time. If you view 4k as the only win condition, you are bound to be disappointed. My rule of thumb is that there is a break-even point at 2k. Anything below is a loss, anything above is a win.
---

---
Surprise, Quentin was already down there trying to get a medkit.
---
I‚Äôll admit Iv killed myself plenty time on the hook, for example I‚Äôll run the killer around for quit a while and no gens will get done I‚Äôll go down get hooked and if the killer is patrolling me and no one is coming I‚Äôll just kill myself better then DCs lol
---
2k typically feels like a loss more than it does a draw, just because those games typically play out the same as a loss until the very end.
---
It's pretty uncommon for somebody to get two kills early on only to have the other two escape (unless they have a key, which just feel like you got cheated more than anything else imo). If you get a 2k, you probably had 0-1 kills going to endgame, so you've been having a pretty bad time. You don't feel like you actually did well, you feel like "ok they should have escaped but they did something dumb".
---
*Billy has entered the chat*
---
Snitches get stitches.
---
Goes the same in this game.
---
Yeah, idk why the rng is so bad on the doors after the egc patch. They should make a third door. It ONLY activates with 1 survivor left and the hatch has been closed.

Thanks for reminding me the new TF2 comic still hasn‚Äôt released
---
Did the devs think about Left Behind while releasing the Endgame Collapse?
---
Did they even think?
---
Freddy has a tip for you.
---
Well if the killer is camping then there's nothing you can do, as for the same perks this is pretty much for both sides and there's also nothing you can do to help it. If the devs don't add perks that spice up the meta then people are just going to run the same perks. MoM, adrenaline, decisive strike and exhaustion perks. Ruin, bbq, enduring, spirit fury and noed.
---
(it also does not help that ghostfaces perks are terrible)
---
by that logic how does camping hurt at all. they‚Äôre literally not pressing any buttons.
---
Lmao,first killer i faced was myers or billy i dont quite remember, since i was rank 20 couldnt even hit a skillcheck and the dude tried to catch me but disnt quite understand how to lunge lol
---
I like the 3k rule makes me feel a bit better, does the hatch have specific spawns I‚Äôll just learn through playin or is it more random than that
---
At least he escaped in the end
---
Pretty much same with my Feng.And you know what I get matched with after rank reset?Blendettes with Urban evasion.
---
Um. Camping changes the entire game. Explain to me how humping the ground causes anyone to live or die?
---

Just existing
---
I love doctor Carter....
---
His daily is always so easy to get
---
I'm sorry that a counter-able mechanic exists that you just don't feel like countering :(
---
Yo why the f*ck is she getting off the gen its almost-
---
*turns arround*
---
#OH FUCK
---
Bing bong = upvote
---
For killers i hear most complaints regarding camping and tunneling also slugging. For survivors tbagging, pointing to other survivors, and gen rushing. Some things bother people and some don‚Äôt it just depends on the person really.
---
Trash nurse gang rise up!
---
Honestly as killer it really comes down to not camping and not tunneling directly off hook.  And then just the obvious not going out of your way to bm (same as survivor).  If you aren't camping then tunneling directly off hook won't occur either so you really shouldn't be getting salt.  And if you are still receiving messages at that point it's just entitled toxic survivors.
---
June 18th!
---
Me yesterday I was nea with my pink  hair and neon blue jacket and i had three claudettes with me all wearing the brown jacket. Needless to say I was looping or running the whole time.
---
Yes, It is https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1748763068&amp;searchtext=Faithful+Icon ,follow the download guide on here. This is where I got them from.
---
Mild confuse
---
Neither did I the first time I played killer tbf. I did realise after I missed like 5 times in a row! I can't remember what I was like when I first started playing, but I remember that I never used pallets
---
Had that the first day of the event, turned out to be the PS4 network going down.
---
OwO is pretty good against stealth killers and outright bs against a good huntress going for long range shots, the only thing is learning how to use it safely and to always make sure you're in a good spot when it's in use, ie. near pallets and windows to escape to if the killer comes after you.
---
I am on 3 hours of sleep, I aplogoise if I sound delusional.
---
But I never win...
---
Lol, shhhhh! I bet it's fun to play, not so fun to come up against
---
The hatch does have specific spawn, but there are a shitload of them on every map. It can spawn almost anywhere. Once it's open though you can find it by the sound it makes (it's like a ringing or humming). It spawns on the map under certain conditions, and the survivors can escape from it as long as it's open.  
---
It spawns when the survivors complete gens equal to the number of survivors alive + 1. It only opens if there is only one survivor left in the trial. They can also open it with a dull key or a skeleton key. The reason it's important to know this is because once they have enough gens done to spawn it, they can find it, even if it's not open. This means that the last guy can run to it when you are hooking the other guy, and escape before you can find it.
---
P.S. Open handed stacks with Kindered's Killer Reading aura so if they are within 24 meters within the hooked person with those two perks, Survivors will be able to see them. I usually run this combo during Bloodhunt because if I don't get mori'd I get camped
---
Most of the internet sounds delusional, it's all good.
---
A Mori-able offense.
---
That's kinda horrifying, brings a "welcome to hell" out of nowhere feel. Literally no where to go, and no teammates to help you
---
Do people really hate going against Myers? I actually prefer playing against Myers over many other killers.
---
Have a good day!
---
That looks like pinhead!
---
I. Just remember throwing every single pallet down no matter how close the killer was while in a chase lmao, took me some time to realize how to lunge too, insidious myers is hilarious because its spirit/ hag level of jumpscare
---
Day good have a!
---
itd be so nice to activate the sprint burst whenever you needed to... running is essential in this game and sometimes you need to buy time to find a better area.. so when it goes off as soon as you start running it's useless lol
---
I get where you're coming from. It's definitely boring. But remember all the times where you weren't the one being camped and they suicide on the hook and now it screwed your team over because the killer is on the loose again? I try to remember that every time I get face camped. I would want my teammates to buy me time, so I'm going to do the same for them.
---
*pfffft* xD
---
Well depends if you go against a good Myers or not. There are plenty weak myers but yeah when its a good myers it's scary xD
---
^^^^^ THIS.
---
Most people consider anything that makes a chase null for killer (Adrenaline, MoM, Dead Hard, etc), alongside t-bagging, is considered toxic by most killer mains.
---
Anything that screws over a survivor/survivors for almost nothing (NOED, Rancor, slug builds), and hitting when on hook, is considered toxic by most survivor mains.
---
My opinion? Nothing is off-limits. Nobody can dictate how the game is played for the other side, and the idea that running perks is toxic is kind of dumb unless they're blatantly broken (MoM, in my opinion). T-bagging and hitting on hook is kind of a shitty thing to do, but anything goes. 
---
As for the video, looking at the ground as Legion causes the deep wound timer to go down, eventually resulting in the survivor going down while still in a chase after getting hit by Feral Frenzy.
---
TL:DR: Nothing is really toxic except for tbagging and hitting on hook really. A lot of people just like bitching about how other people play the game. You play how you wanna play, no matter what others think.
---
The hatch spawns are completely random, but they are more likely to spawn on lower places in the map. On the game map it's even guaranteed to spawn on the first floor.
---
I like how you have got no reply
---
And I love to see the killer get impatient and hitting me when he realizes the other survivors are doing gens and punishes the killer for camping, while I just keep struggling. It makes the whole thing worthwhile!
---
Gotta get used to it. It‚Äôs very strong with Spirit it‚Äôs easy to lose people while phasing without it
---
If I get a Nurse daily, I reset it or wait for the next day to reset it.
---
Nodding your head does it for me :P
---
Eh, my spine chill hasn't gone off, she's probably looking for hex ruin
---
You don't need to sign edits on jokes.
---
You could give it a chance like 25/50/75 or maybe have it say "when cleansed 1/2/all survivors that are infused or dying get healed one state"
---
Less dumb but still silly
---
How would leader help with a generator?
---
Best way to avoid this is just be sneaky in the beginning til someone else is chased, or maybe hide near a gen until Killer comes and goes before starting to work on it.
---
You don't get to have it both ways.  Why are they literally just pressing control?  It's to communicate a form of disrespect to the opponent.  It serves no in game function.  This is not news to you I'm sure.  If you go out of your way to needlessly bm don't be surprised if a killer chooses to camp you.  Toxicity begets toxicity.  Treat your opponent with respect and your chance at getting camped greatly diminishes.
---
I feel like all of the characters are in a pretty good place *except* for Jake. All of his headpieces suck, most of his torsos are awkward, and legs are meh. 
---
His face is poorly designed, if my opinion means squat as someone without artistic ability. I am disappointed that I chose him as my only Legacy survivor because I'm so restricted on decent-looking cosmetics.
---
I would recommend doctor because he is an antistealth killer and when you shock people enough with his power you disable items and the survivors will start screaming every once in a while (which makes it easier to track them down), it's also easy to make bloodpoints with him. You need bloodpoints to go through bloodwebs and get more useful perks. 
---
If you level a killer to 30 you will start to see 'teachable perks', these perks were once only usable on the specific killer you're upgrading but when you start unlocking teachable perks these perks will show up in other bloodwebs.
---
I don't know which killers you own but I would definitely recommend to upgrade these killers to unlock the following perks:
---
Hag for Hex:Ruin 
---
Hillbilly for Enduring
---
Nurse for A nurses calling
---
Doctor for Monitor and abuse
---
Some perks are very useful but exclusive to killers you have to unlock with shards or auric cells. Sometimes these perks will show up in the shrine of secrets. Look out for the following:
---
Barbecue and Chili
---
Spirit fury
---
Bamboozle
---
Discordance
---
Monto is actually the reason I decided to get back into the game.  
---
Death is not an escape from toxicity
---
Looks like a fellow redditor from r/natureisbrutal
---
You didn't know this existed?
---
Feng Main Big Brain
---
Next time just say "And you mad?"
---
Um, you were clearly tunneling everyone.
---
How dare you, sir/ma'am.
---
dang im sure the part where his old coworkers got charged with something they didnt do is a huge relief to dwight as he dies over and over in a nightmare realm to please an evil spider god
---
Yeah that's true, I don't like going against legion or doctor though
---
Yeah, if you watch how they end loops and prioritize breaking all pallets, spacing, when to swing and not to swing. I like watching monto because he explains why he does most of his actions.
---
Definitely made me a better killer *and* survivor, i sucked at survivor before discovering Monto xD
---
All toxic things in this ‚Äúperfect game.‚Äù
---
Tunneling: When the killer goes for the survivor that just got rescued by another survivor.
---
Camping: When the killer stands either infront or near the survivor, letting them die on the hook.
---
Claudette: She is literally invisible if you hide in tall grass and use the right cosmetics. 
---
T-bagging: Triggered killers tend to make a whole fucking essay if you t-bag them once on reddit or endgame chat.
---
It is honestly a really fun game and my friends and I have a blast, but the community is just so toxic.
---
if you teabag tf out of me fuck my bloodpoints and fuck yours too. LMFAOOO
---
Huh? There were other coworkers with them and if they all tell the same story it would just be a typical 'man lost in forest' story. They'll look for two weeks and then announce him dead. And no one will remember him soon after.
---
I should be banned for doing that
---
Doc has low map pressure on the bigger maps. You should almost always try to protect a set of 3 gens that are close together. One of your greatest strengths as doctor is your static field. You can use it to find survivors, and stop them from working on gens, but it only affects them in your terror radius. Addons and perks that increase your terror radius can be very good, but still won't let you cover the larger maps very well. The three gen strat lets you use your power to the fullest.
---
Awesome play, but those survivors got screwed over twice. The second survivor shouldn‚Äôt have gone down since you clearly hit the person on the hook. The third survivor was trying to do an unhook when the game decided a heal was the better option right under the hook. You did good, but God can this game be frustrating
---
i'm a killer main and agree with poster. killing is just mean. survivors are our adorable wittle fwiends. unless you're doing the rare Adept trophy, which is never fun
---
Seriously, you should.
---
How dare you play this game as it's been designed.
---
youre right, that is a dumb idea
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
I love the ironic hypocrisy of this comment.
---
So good.
---
Hmmm I wonder why, perhaps it has to do with your loadout.
---
At least everyone else survived. Your death wasn't for nothing
---
Sometimes there‚Äôs just a advantage starting out too. Like when I have the add on that lets me kill anyone who‚Äôs been on the hook
---
No that's just a bug.
---
Thanks mate (;
---
Of course they didn't, this is the DbD subreddit
---
But what if a killer uses 4 hex perks including haunted ground?
---
It's kinda the same as dc'ing, but with extra steps. If the killer is camping then it's fine, but if you got hooked and purposely kill yourself for no reason, it's kind of a dick move
---
Ebony mori, it's an offering. If the killer has that then the survivors have very little to no chance of survival
---
ghostface in less than 2 days yeaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Wouldn't be fair. It's status would always be up whereas a killer can ignore borrowed by going after a different survivor/not camping
---
Wraith and pig get the easy stealth attack so survivors will only have one hit in chase.
---
Damn you‚Äôre lucky lol, I came back to this game after not playing for about a year, and it‚Äôs just been a constant month of toxicity and farming lol
---
I don‚Äôt mind it too much though, cause there‚Äôs a lot of great people in this community:)
---
the joke just flew over your head
---
*rages and switches to oinker*
---
oh so u can be a polite killer and break it for tehm and be like here ya go
---
You bet.
---
Doesn‚Äôt the killer get more points from that then a normal dc ?
---
Can we also add survivors that DC onto this list as well? Can‚Äôt count how many DC‚Äôs I‚Äôve been dealing with
---

---
I actually really like the idea of a 'charm'-perk system. But it shouldn't occupy a totem, it should occupy some other artefact in the map which is destroyable by the killer.
---
Fucking noob slugging killer^^^/s
---
No offense, but they're real fucking idiots when it comes to balancing/assessing killers. Idk what they're thinking when they nerf a decent, balanced killer (or make a bad one worse, like Legion). Also, I'm not sure how characters like Leatherface and Freddy didn't get rejected during development. They must test the characters for glaring issues, right?
---
I just suggest running any other suggestion perk so it doesn‚Äôt stop you from running out of chases.
---
But what if the badness was dormant and bringing the fuck has activated it, thus creating the reaction.
---
I think that yes
---
True that
---
Nah I recognize their name. 
---
They constantly spew nonsense to the point I wonder if they‚Äôre an actual person or a bot that‚Äôs programmed to troll.
---
- When Freddy puts you to sleep you have 7 seconds at base depending on his add-ons until he can hit you. During these 7 seconds you will want to run to the nearest pallet loop or window and try to get some distance between you and him. 
---
- While phasing in and out of dream world, he will phase around 3 times. The last time is between 3 to 5 seconds into the transition. Keep track of where you last saw him and try to predict his movement. Most Freddys will just follow you meaning throwing a pallet or window down early might be the best course of action.
---
- Self-Care is a great perk for getting out the dream world quickly. It allows you to run off when you are injured and snap yourself out of it through a failed skill check. Self-care has a higher base chance of getting a skill check than a gen meaning its more reliable. 
---
- Adrenaline wakes you up when all the gens are complete. Great for escaping Freddy during the end-game.
---
- Borrowed time still works in his lullaby. You can use it to save team-mates that are close to him. Very important during the end-game if he is camping a survivor. 
---
- Do not play stealthy. He sees you aura outside his terror radius meaning he knows exactly where you are. Do not go in a locker. I have had survivors try that against me and let me tell you it just doesn't work. 
---
- Good perks against Freddy are; Self-care, Adrenaline, Bond &amp; Spine Chill. Since Freddy is mainly a sneaky killer due to his inherent reduced terror radius and ability to see your aura, Spine chill tells you when he is coming. It also increases your skill check chances by 10% when he looks at you meaning you can use it with self-care or a gen to get a higher chance to break out of the dream world if he is looking at you.
---
I'm pretty sure all killers and survivors have it very bad
---
There‚Äôs a symbol at the right that tells you how much you need to recover before it comes back
---
Using NOED according to SOME  survivors. 
---
Using AdrenaWIN, Decisive, pallet looping,  and denying achievements according to SOME killers
---
wouldn‚Äôt the killer want you to die on your first hook? Isn‚Äôt the point of a killer to get rid of survivors?
---
Coming from a nurse main. Shes super easy after like 3 games. Her difficulty is really over hyped.
---
Intense and road
---
Jesus Christ!
---
&gt; cleaned by the Meg and never did gens.
---
You misspelled Ace V.
---
To be fair, he was probably looking for the Craps table on the Pale Rose...
---
At least your teammates escaped, if I die and my teammates end up escaping, I consider that a win
---
Then that should be made clear.  They don‚Äôt use a verb that indicates that like awaken.
---
Beat me to it. Darn
---
&gt; I hate that notion, playing both killer and surv 50-50, but heh, it exists sadly
---
Yup.  I play Survivor when I want to play for fun.  I play Killer when I need BloodPoints or, ahem, *had a bad day at work*.
---
These are greatly helpful thanks going to use these next time I get matched up against him. Also when the kid sings freddys theme does that mean freddy is close and trying to put me to sleep?
---
Check out [the glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary) in the sidebar. It's really helpful!
---
Either message someone before the match, down someone and take em to a gen and start smacking it...if they wiggle off a run away they either have zero idea what you're doing...or don't want to farm.
---
My rule of thumb is attempt,it once....MAYBE twice if gens are popping asap...otherwise consider it a no farm match and go about it normally.
---
It shouldn't be hard for a player to notice you not hooking them...when dozens are nearby.
---
It the only reason I got pig no kill just roar
---
Yea, as killer that‚Äôs generally your role. You decide whether a survivor dies or not. You‚Äôre so hyped up on salt you don‚Äôt want to just accept it.  Also
---
&gt;don‚Äôt make a big deal out of it.
---
Coming from the guy crying on Reddit because a killer didn‚Äôt give him hatch. *The irony.*
---
No just pointing out the BS of survivors who claim the perk is now useless.
---
I always give the last survivor hatch when I play killer, I just prefer to find it for them instead of them camping it üòÇ
---
Considering BHVR altered some of the hair cosmetics for the female survivors during the PTB I would not be surprised if they have considered revamping the appearance of some of the survivors at some point down the line of dbd's 4th Year. 
---
Then again BHVR might be concerned over possible backlash from updating the original characters appearances.
---
Next chapter: hyena killer with antelope survivor in the Savannah map
---
Bless headphones. Saved me from Mike and the Piggie so many times.
---
To the initiated a Killer downing you and taking you to a Gen and smacking it is the clearest sign of wanting to farm (yes some abuse it to trick n,troll ppl) 
---
Some Survivors just have ZERO ides about anything, or don't want to farm...even,with the double BP event, they just want to play normally/tryhard etc.
---
Sorry, would of broke the pallet for ya but I was too busy chasing the Nea teabagging me at the infinite.
---
I literally cannot play games without headphones, I don‚Äôt know how people do it, especially with this game
---
Glad to see you read the conversations before making a comment
---
Why do people hate Hag? Here smile is so cute :(
---
BHVR are planning to make totems better hidden too.
---
What about the hook rushers? The end game? That extra health states given to every Survivor multiple times needs to be balanced with a **big** Killer upside.
---
This is probably the best advice I've heard. But how about if you are a survivor wanting to farm?
---
Legion can often be King/Queen (depends whixh one ya play ;D) of Bloodpount gaining if you manage to Deep Wound peeps a lot and slow the game down....jus a lil bit
---
Shame it doesnt have "boosted"
---
Ghostface will be more immediately dangerous and doesn't take as long to stalk, and his build up to expose people is brief compared to how long it takes for Michael.
---
The only thing Michael really has on Ghostface is that he has add ons that can instantly kill people.
---
It was one of the first perks I started running, but now I mostly only run it when I'm playing with a SWF group. I like it a lot for the reason I mentioned in my post - it can be very fun to start a generator and stare at the killer, because a lot of time the killer will then make the decision to come after me instead of whatever they were doing. It's no Mettle of Man, but it can be useful if you *want* the killer to come to you. Like a non-toxic/time wasting version of flashlight clicking. If the killer doesn't fall for it, cool, I'm still repairing the generator, if he does, the other 3 survivors are free to repair generators.
---
Freddy's lullaby is actually his terror radius when you are awake. It has a 24-meter range I believe and cannot be altered via perks. 
---
When you hear the Lullaby it just means that Freddy is close to you. There is a very subtle difference between him being far or close to you but if you listen carefully I believe the lullaby gets louder as he gets closer to you. It was designed to be very hard to tell.
---
I'd stay away from all of Trapper's unless you're going for something specific. Not that his perks are bad, just in many cases outclassed by better perks. Brutal itself was a must before the buff to pallet break speed. Since it no longer provides the same percentages, it really doesn't help much in chases. I'd go for stbfl or spirit fury-enduring. If you do like trapper, you'll find stbfl quite good on him due to your ability to hit survivors on traps to gain stacks. :D
---
Thanks again. And when I'm asleep he gets normal chase music when hes close?
---
You know that isn‚Äôt his face, right? LF wears a second face as a mask, so i would hope there are two sets of lips here
---
I literally do this except it‚Äôs a chase daily so kinda justified
---
By refusing to participate in normal gameplay it means stuff like farming people to death not farming with survivors
---
Gotta get out of those ranks. Rank 12 and above are all garbage tier players. It sucks even more for survivors in the 16-20 bracket because those are new killers and they don‚Äôt really know how to do anything else than tunnel or camp.
---
You're throwing the game. You may as well ask "What's wrong with DCing?"
---
Well they could do that unhook denying mechanic they spoke about to prevent farmers. If by endgame you mean egc, that's already killer favored. And the borrowed would only apply if the unhooked survivor is on the killers terror radius when being unhooked.
---
Roar gud stab no gud unless ritual then just one stab and lots of nods
---
*I m a g i n e R u n n i n g O u t O f B l o o d y P a r t y S t r e a m e r s*
---
I know but I do it to be helpful, most people just stay on the generators because they assume I'm going to do sometbing else but when I point, I've noticed more people get off and leave as well
---
You should be stealthy and get back on the gen once the killer passes. They‚Äôre gonna follow the scratch marks and you actually just put yourself in danger by following them.
---
Zoinks, guess I‚Äôm wrong then
---
Yeah. Especially when it's clear the killer deserved to get hit by it
---
Will the second obsession still get the exposed status? I never thought of it.
---
this would be impressive if your teammates werent potatos
---
I feel like I‚Äôm missing something this never happens to me on Xbox
---
Oh that's insanely shitty.... I try not to kill a single person
---
So your mad that DS saved him from the tunnel?
---
Yesyes
---
Yep, a very little known thing because it‚Äôs so rare
---
Oh no, in this case be thankful there is no chat. The salt must have been high with this one.
---
I just went up against a Clown and I missed it by an inch ;( it was the latest skill check to around the 12:00 region. I ended up getting sacrificed
---
Lol Imagine still complaining about DS. I swear killer mains have become what survivor mains were years ago,entitled.
---
Yup. Much harder... to stay awake. Nothing says challenging while holding M1 down and hitting the occasional skill check.
---
*cries in years of waiting*
---
The simple statement I can give you is this. 
---
If you get hit with D strike you deserved it
---
Ouch
---
Dude cmon put an edit saying that the edit that was there earlier got edited out. s/
---
I mean you need someone to help you in order to pull it off now, so theres that
---
Only because I suck.
---
Intestifies is so hilarious for some reason
---
Ds trike is great now as an anti tunneling perk. It counters bad killers now instead of giving bad survivors a freebie.
---
You actually wanted to play the game during DBP weekend? What an asshole.
---
So, you wasted half the match chasing one survivor instead of getting gen pressure. Finally hooked said survivor. Tunneled them immediately after they got unhooked, which I assume you camped. Got ds/d. Got mad, rage quit and came to Reddit to vent. I gotcha. But, lemme teach you a neat trick. Go after other survivors. DS means nothing if you don't tunnel. The perk is basically and anti-tunneling perk. And with going for other survivors too, you present gen pressure, slowing down the game for them and possibly netting you a 4k.
---
More like a wet dream
---
Rip bb Dwight
---
Ebic troll
---
Fuck it was lol
---
1. I didn't say teammates playing together is wrong, what I said it them using Discord to get around the lack of a chat. That problem is like Dead by Daylight's version of smurfing in CS GO.
---
2. Alright whatever.
---
3. The problem is that a lot of the time when you down survivors, they'll be in open fields. You can't guide them away, and you can't look away from a flashlight beam while picking them up.
---
4. New players already suck at the game, and they are completely powerless at the game. They can't get to NOED unless they're higher up in the ranks, which requires that you get bloodpoints (which requires you get kills).
---
5. Knocking down a pallet requires the killer to look all the way down. It makes it hard for them to keep track of where a savvy survivor is going.
---
6. It seems though that in every update there's less improvements to the game and more DLC.
---
7. While crawling, Nea is far faster than David King could ever be.
---
There's several reasons this is a bad idea that you'll come to understand over time.
---
If your only option is to dc, then you are in a hostage situation. Forcing players to dc so they can resume normal gameplay should never, ever be considered acceptable.
---
Damn we switched, I was out of town for the last one lol
---
I just don't understand DCing.
---
There are two main goals of this game.....player leveling and obtaining bloodpoints.
---
DCing literally takes both of those away, making your time in the game effectively meaningless.
---
I think people think they're affecting the other side, whether it be a killer or survivor DCing, but it just does not, or minimally at best.
---
I just don't get it.
---
And much like your match that you rage quit, you rage quit the post too because you didn't get your way. Calm down and work on yourself as a killer.
---
Love this! Even as an experienced player, I found this advice helpful. Let's hope all players take note :)
---
Viable or not, i can't understand why people want to play a standing simulator. This is a chase game. Why the fuck would anyone want to chase once and then just sit there? Call me crazy but I play video games for entertainment, not as a way to further bore myself.
---
I read it. It's just irrelevant. Your ping was messed up.
---
There is no way any of us here will accept that as a serious argument. You are being ridiculous.
---
Not 100%sure ive been out of town during both its just depressing lmao
---
And if you let 3 players go maybe you lose 5K each. The game has no negative consequences, you will get BP no matter what.
---
Oh no they were doing gens like they were suppose to :( hate people who play the game how they are suppose to
---
People that camp are either so bad at the game or simply so toxic that they think standing there looking at pixels is the game lol.
---
Dstrike now works for 60 seconds after getting unhooked, before it worked at all times. It clearly didn't get buffed. 
---
Yes it's a strong perk, so is MoM, and many people get angry at them. But at the end of the day we need to remember that those perks are only situational, and are not the sole reason why we lost the match. Killers also have perks like that, like noed, which also is very strong at a particular time of the match, but it doesn't autowin the game for killers either.
---
I never thought of that, you right fam...
---
Or popular page, where it was like at the top
---
No that's a horrible point, you slow down on chainsaw charge, look up so it's harder to see survs, you get stunned by pallets vaults and trees when you miss.
---
Agreed friend :)
---
The grass or the pallets?
---
Too op, although the hook one could be "Reduce the speed at which you die on the hook based off of how many survivors are working on gens" At that point even going as high as 10-20-30% might discourage campers and be somewhat valid, as a survivor going for the save would limit your time on the hook.
---
You get full credit for endgame kills.
---
Unless they misspoke during the stream about it.
---
Can we add people who abuse SWF by grouping with people who fifteen or more ranks beneath them? Always fun getting stomped by a group of rank 3s and 4s that was apparently supposed to be fair due to the rank 15 they found in group finder.
---
What's the most fun then
---
Not only does farming go against pretty much any known or publicized definition of Dead by Daylight's normal gameplay, it is quite simply never going to be regarded as "normal gameplay" by the developers in their enforcement of the rules. Don't be dense.
---
I achieved my first 100k game ever, with The Doctor, a 4k in Lery's of all places, WITHOUT Party Streamers or Pudding, just BBQ and 25% all catagories.
---
If you are on the ground, spin around a few circles. If you are still up, tbag a few times then point.
---
Fuck that I dont get much time to play I treat it the ssame as if there was no event. Just play the game normally regardless of side
---
What perks do use on her?
---
That‚Äôs why I said you don‚Äôt have to farm but don‚Äôt be more toxic than you would
---
I leave on that map most of the time, it's BS that you can't see generators unless you look closely.
---
Not a killer main but when you manage to only down one person after 4 generators with the fifth being almost finished and the guy you were chasing decides to DC I cry everytime...
---
Sounded a lot more like a joke to me.
---
third seal, clearly
---
Yeah, you can barely see those, and forget seeing either s ratch marks or healing survivors with Nurses.
---
And anything yellow.......well, that just doesn't exist.
---
My least favorite to play against is Freddy. I like playing against the nurse most though, weird. And when I play killer, I prefer piggy because I enjoy being cheeky and silly with the survivors :3
---
After four games in a row of people teabag spamming and shit talking post game I got a match where only a single player started insulting me! ...Only for his team to jump on him, call him out on accusing me of camping, and tell me I made the match really fun. That meant a lot to me after how shitty people seem to get once a streamer offering gets put up.
---
Shadowborn ruin bbq and devour hope
---
I was having this issue A LOT the first day of the event.
---
Always 3 survivors quickly, then waiting forever for a 4th.
---
And, if those 3 left, another 3 came in, but never 4.
---
Either DC, hop into lockers or just run out through the exit gates since it takes forever to get stalk up :)
---
Cocaine's a hell of a drug
---
Two of these are perceived toxicity, one actually is. 
---
1.) If you're the killer and you kill the survivors. 
---
2.) If you hook a survivor, they are unhooked, and you come across them again just by coincidence
---
3.) Teabagging
---
Gen rush &gt; chainsaw
---
You just said it yourself: **you have to DC if they force you to farm**. This is a hostage situation where your only outs are to **collaborate with the opponents to farm**, or **disconnect**, neither of which **constitute normal gameplay.** Jesus fuck the mental gymnastics you have to do to defend your point of view here.
---
Legion is better than spirit, if Ur criteria is make the game unfun for everyone
---
Some people play for fun, either because they are already done with the grind, or because they do not care about progression. Those people will DC if they are not having fun, because DCing let's them que right up into a new game with potential fun. While staying means wasting their time.
---
LMAO never expected to see EDP on here
---
By not giving a shit, there's a reason why I like casually playing at ranks 14-10. Don't care about throwing a game or two, I have the game knowledge and skill to get 4K's or survive as a survivor if I get a team that does at least something, but I don't care enough. I came to chill with some music and know the killer is coming with spine chill tyvm
---
No matter what I do I can never hit the DS skill check. I can hit Ruin skill checks and greats all day, but for some reason I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been able to make DS work. Feels bad.
---
Outplayed
---
They prob don‚Äôt want to farm
---
yea experiencing the same thing right now again. its ruining the 2xp bp experience but I will keep waiting i guess
---
Yes, it has a good skill cap that is very rewarding instead of just handling you new chances without much effort. It's like this community doesn't want things to have skill caps so DBD can keep being a casual, non-competitive game.
---
"Entity displeased" I think if I were the entity I would be laughing my tits off. Maybe the entity is Claudette, though.
---
Yeah but it never was at thirty, it‚Äôs always be at like fifteenüòÇ
---
I love the presentation of this, reminds me of old issues of GamePro.  And it‚Äôs good information!
---
Should‚Äôve been adrenaline instead of instant med kit haha
---
Expected you to find hatch and escape but oh well, glad you at least had fun
---
You pretty much described the reason why I haven't touched survivor unless I have 2 or 3 friends playing. All that happens is I get chased fir 5-10 minutes, get camped and one gen poped during the whole ordeal.
---
bruh, we're all dead. there's no escaping
---
That‚Äôs sweet of you.
---
You never know these days
---
Or they don't know that you are signaling for them
---
Bruh, death is not an escape.
---
You get stunned for like a second. You also get a massive speed boost after the slow down. Which also has 0 cooldown.
---
What‚Äôs dc?
---
You misunderstood their comment
---
I like how I specifically mentioned the lunge and vaulting speed but you had to repeat it. Ghostface also can get to it faster for each individual survivor and can do it technically for every single chase and will never run out of it since it's his power.
---
Lmao i did this to my friend one time! it was haddonfield and I was on the roof and leather face saw me from the street and we had a stare down because he knew there wasnt enough time to get up the stairs and get to me. Then i started pointing at my friend down the street working on a generator, leather face looked at me like "what? what you mean?" then walked over and found my friend. 
---
He was a pretty chill killer and I even think he let us go. Its golden matches like that which make this game worthwhile
---
I don't think I'd run it in a SWF group. First because I dislike sharing information OOC, second because it's very useful for me when solo'ing especially because I dislike sharing information OOC. Just as it helped in baiting the Killer, it also helped me with knowing to which side they went after a hook so I can go to the other. If things go wrong and the Killer sees me while using OoO, I can even "juke" them by going to one side and then deactivating it to go to the other.
---
It's a versatile, manageable, creative perk. If anything, we should have more of those in the game instead of things like MoM.
---
I've missed 3 DS in a row, feels so damn bad. It sucks, because i really want to punish tunnelers.
---
Go be fair I paid shards and I bought her and Legion dlc the insta t it dropped.
---
And then I instantly regretted it lol.
---
Honestly that's what I dont understand either. Maybe cause when someone gets found first they expect to get camped or just want to find another game. This causes others to dc cause why play a game of 3 people? Then I end up depiping so im forever stuck with people who do this. Went from rank 11 from rank reset to rank 15 due to DC's.
---
So legion.
---
needing to explain such a simple concept to you means theres even no point in trying to.
---
Give this man a medal for this music.
---
Strategy: open the exit gate just before the first lights turns on and go hide. When they come check on your door they will think it hasn‚Äôt been worked on. When they leave, go back to the door and hope for the best. Those extra secs have saved my life.
---
I‚Äôve lost many escape cakes to people disconnecting as soon as the game loads. Doesn‚Äôt even give escape points as well
---
There are people who think Noed isnt OP
---
I've been doing the exact opposite this entire time. Arm waving to say I'm that I am safe!!
---
That's from last year, though. Of course you're gonna find the specific clump of shit you're looking for if you dive deep enough into the cesspool. I still agree with the OC, it's gonna be hard to find any killer who thinks throwing down pallets is toxic. 
---
Specifically, the post you found is a question on pallet looping, which is different from throwing down a (single) pallet.
---
You do know.
---
 Man ash mains deserve it u guys got the most toxic and overpowered surv perk on the game
---
Lucky you. Maybe its just really bad luck on my end or people really don't like facing trapper.
---
I get that even if I do 4k üòÇ
---
Fyi there is a way to check even when someone is offline.
---
I pigged someone real hard because of that, I left their view and crouched then charged and downed one then I left her on the ground with a head trap on, she just killed herself by leaving
---
It's always a damn claudette thats either toxic or waits at the exit gate
---
But you forget. Survivors can't run anything besides decisive strike mettle of man self-care and and exhaustion perk. Ignore counters in the game and make others change their playstyle so it fits their own. Even though there's a perfectly easy and reasonable counter to NoEd...
---
I just think it's very very lame that survivors get to run all of these meta builds and complain about whatever a killer uses. I can almost guarantee most matches all of the totems get destroyed and if they don't... So be it. If no one escapes death is such a problem for you just use small game. Besides survivors don't even have to Escape 2 win. Survive for 7 minutes, do a generator and get an unhook. Maybe not dying quickly in a Chase.
---
She was probably trying to buy as much time as possible for the Ace
---
Yeah I have this problem with any killer with movement like nurse and billy or even hag with her TP. Its just so hard they need to give you the slow timer they give when a friend is hooked. 
---
I always want to start opening one door then rush to the other to fake her out but there is just never enough time. Either increase the timer when solo or increase the speed to open it.
---
I did this today with no perks or add-ons, I give myself a pat on the back
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt see the reasoning behind making the killer ones such a difficult, convoluted chore to go for. I have Hillbilly and that‚Äôs it atm and fuck knows how I managed that with the new pipping system, which honestly is really fucking shit on the Killer side of things
---
I just looked up what excatly is bad about him now and yeah I can see that. Its being inconsistent rn which is just a bug that needs to be fixed
---
bruhhhhh
---
Look who‚Äôs shittin in the tall grass ;,)
---
I was expecting for laurie to talk about decisive strike instead of object loo
---
F
---
Why did you tell people this, now they're going to use this to bully poor survivors who are running brown medkits
---
I had a scenario today where I hooked someone as trapper, was setting traps at a nearby window when the rescue went off so I caught and hooked the rescuer. This was 1 gen left. I hooked the rescuer and took 2 steps away when they used deliverance. They were my obsession. I hit them, and said, "Yeah, this idiot has DS, I'll slug em until it wears off and rehook them since they wanted to be an idiot."
---
I was called a camper because I decided to let everyone else leave and punish this one person for basically committing suicide with an obvious trap.
---
Yup it‚Äôs been a camp or tunneled event yet again on PS4!
---
It really helps if you just play for fun. You can have good games and still lose. I hate waiting for a lobby and then killer just face camps or insists on farming. I just wanna play the game man.
---
Yea, i should have use that time to find the hatch, but I had no hope. Was happy enough that I got my decisive strike off and didn't even think about finding the hatch.
---
I juat got a match where they accused me of map hack when i was playing legion with killer's range addon so yeah .this people exist
---
I played a couple hag games last night and I really enjoyed it
---
Usually but when a gen is close to being done or worked on it gives a distinction that the killer knows u were there. He could end a chase and search or keep chasing it varies.
---
"tbag"
---
Are you honestly gonna be salty because someone crouched a lot?
---
What time?
---
if you play disrespectfully don‚Äôt expect the other side to play fair
---
This just made me think of F13
---
Brrrrruuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh
---
As cool as this could potentially be the devs said they wont be doing any animal type killers....
---
38 at most.
---
If I‚Äôm on hook, I‚Äôm not letting a farming survivor that never touched a generator have the hatch. If they didn‚Äôt help the team, I‚Äôm not helping them
---
Yeah, I see that as a monthly recurring problem because I don't play a lot, I like many games. I assume it would be less of an issue if I'd reach higher ranks and thus they wouldn't reset as hard. I believe thats how it works?
---
You know what? I want to run balanced landing next game!
---
Gets shelter woods
---
FUCK
---
Yeah I find the fatigue mechanic just grating.
---
When you are awake he has no aura-reading abilities for you. He can only see your aura when you are asleep. 
---
Arguably Freddy is actually more susceptible to stealth while survivors are awake because his dream world can make it difficult to spot survivors. But this is kind of counterbalanced in that you have no idea where Freddy is while you are awake as he is invisible so there is no gurantee that stealth will work against him.
---
This is why I don't trust any killer. I was playing as Jeff and had this Michael who farmed with Meg and Ash but I wasn't and continued to power on generators after generators. In the end he tried to kill everyone after all generators were completed but we all managed to escape.
---
I love how every time I try to get off a gen to help someone it blows up
---
it's premonition baby
---
That means you have sinned
---
And your sins cannot be forgiven
---
At least those two have hills... Shelter Woods is pure evil... Rumour has it that there is a spot that you can get BL on that map but I have yet to find it (other than killer shack stairs)
---
A little too relatable as a Meg "main" running Sprint burst and spine chill. Buddy, if we're at 5 gens and I start spam pointing and saying come to me, ignore that I'm a Meg and come with me lol

Depends on how well you spend it getting 3k and 4K stuff with the small amount of 5k items probably 39 maybe mid 40s
---
Somebody sounds hurt.
---
\#1 Cant add them to a party on PC
---
\#2 How are you going to call them if you cant ask them for the phone number and there's only a 90% chance they'll even give you it
---
\#3 It would be a lot more fun playing with randoms since you can actually communicate with them. Because you cant communicate with randoms, people don't play quickplay anymore, they usually only play SWF. If this item is added there's a chance it can reduce SWF spam.
---
Yea I straight up just turned my messaging to private so I dont have to deal with them anymore.  I miss out on nice messages sure, but I got more toxic ones anyway so it works I spose
---
My current play time consist of about 80% killer since I only play survivor for daily points and when my friend gets on. I‚Äôve just played enough of the other side to know how this game can screw you over. Thanks for your misinformed assumptionüëå
---
Agreed. It should've stayed at just getting 4k. Survivors only need to escape. They don't even need to pip at all. Yet killers need to work like crazy for the achievement
---
"I am Groo.......er, Wraith!"
---
SAME! At first I thought the perk didn‚Äôt work with Michael and that‚Äôs the whole reason I put it on. Thankfully it works at higher tiers.
---
I don't even. It's like you decided to completely block out reality. You're either incredibly dense or intellectually dishonest.
---
Wait really?  I thought they said they had to be humanoid/human/previously had been human o.o
---
Ok I was wondering as I knew Legion got reworked but I was like, have I somehow missed a spirit rework
---
1. You can friend them and add them in discord
---
2. Discord call
---
3. Once again discord.
---
I'm in love again
---
Tree skin is the best skin and no one can change my mind!
---
I can't really tell from a short clip
---
Same I'd buy Caf√© Surfer Feng Min in a hearbeat.
---
The reason that the Adepts are ridiculously hard to get is because the devs rushed out a solution to the problem of pipping being too easy. I think they just forgot about the Adepts.
---
Oh I‚Äôm so dumb.. I was getting frustrated not finding him LOL.
---
Agreed, I love this so much.
---
rip that last guy. I'll always remember him :(
---
Not for the bloodpoint build, no
---
Idk how many times ive read that first sentence.
---
I've pretty much oonly been play killer this event and the only people I've been tunneling out of the game are people are people running object of obsession. And it's not even anything personal, but if you run that perk you get so much free information that it's just in my best interest to take you out ASAP; double BP event changes nothing about that calculus
---
Appreciate it all :[
---
I've gone all the way to level 40, but I was very careful to buy only the cheapest stuff on each bloodweb. Your average might be around level 38, definitely not anywhere in the 40s.
---
Damn you're right
---
Farming is pretty boring imo
---
This. Respect should be a standard.
---
You can use bl on the big middle tree, it's really hard to pull off though, especially mid chase
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
Some people don‚Äôt want to farm, I tried and that was the most boring match of my life.
---
It's a nice break. 
---
Farm a few, run a few normal.
---
I only attempt to farm when I get Party Streamers on my webs.
---
‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt think I will.‚Äù
---
And your not reading what im saying. sure he can expose 3-4 people, but what good does it do him when he has no pressure to stop/slow down gens, get around the map, survive in a chase easier.
---
True but it just isn't fair to the survivors to leave.
---
How will you find time to ask all of them their discord, go into discord, add all of them, and then add them all to a group chat in under 30 seconds. I'd love to see you try to attempt that
---
Fuck the Hyena though right? Let it starve
---
Yeah I get you man, nearly everybody has their messages off and it‚Äôs sad, cause all I wanna do is message them gg or give them positive feedback üòÇ
---
The only times I do it is when the survivors legit do not deserve to have me in the game.  This is rare for me but I'll give you an example.  I run the killer for 3 minutes, no gens get popped...I get hooked and can see all 3 auras not on gens crouching around the map.  Yeah I'm outta here good luck being useless fellas.
---
Honestly though it‚Äôs not really that big of an issue. Most of the time it‚Äôs connection not just people leaving.
---
B O I did you read the post?
---
You need proof for a survivor being toxic post game?......
---
I consider that as more map utility. People are being idiots with it, thinking that a 5 second delay on teleport makes him comparable to the nurse.
---
It's tough when you're playing as a survivor because I've already gone against a ton of killers who pretend to want to farm and then just fuck you over and camp. So it makes everyone a little apprehensive. I keep trying if I think the killer seems remotely down to farm, but I'm sure a lot of people are tired of being trolled
---
He shouldn‚Äôt be able to reload the exposed status
---
lol you threw a bitch fit and projected how lonely you are, go outside
---
I make sure to hook everyone evenly. If I run into someone I've hooked already I just leave them slugged so someone can get them.
---
Unless they're being stupid.
---
But I do go for kills.
---
This is why we should have killer emotes. At least entertain me as I get faced camped big sad
---
I have a shitpost of Jake and Quentin that I posted, and some smaller works on my tumblr (Maesonry) but aside from that, nothing yet. Maybe more to come in the future though
---
I just rewatched that Brooklyn nine nine episode last night lol
---
I feel so fucking bad for the guy
---
Camping in the basement obviously
---
Poor hyena , bad enough they are the jehovah's witnesses  of the jungle now he doesn't get the meat
---
i got three kills as legion today! i only got the game like a week ago, pretty much specifically to play as leejun, so i'm really happy about it! and after the match, noed showed up in my bloodweb for the first time, so it'll be fun to try that out too!
---
I could see that, but is it worth trading a perk like monitor and abuse, bbq and chili, spirit fury and enduring, ruin, bamboozle, brutal strength and other possibilities as Michael?
---
Also when you down someone with monitor and abuse are you still in a chase when cries of the unfaithful activates letting you get the bonus on the larger terror radius or does it screw you over by having the reduced terror radius?
---
This is why I fucking love Plague. Ash mains are so arrogant they do not care for puking and transition into broken mode almost instantly while looping, after that its a 1 hit game.
---
And by the time they are off hook, delicious Corrupt Purge awaits their sorry asses. Yum!
---
Doesn't have to transform into an actual wolf, it can have a more humanoid transformation that uses the same model as most other killers.

so you're one of those people who thinks its physically impossible to catch a survivor then if you are just a base 115 killer I'm assuming.
---
Windows is excellent for new survivors. It's a great way to learn maps and you'll feel a lot more comfortable once you're aware of your surroundings. Once you get to a loop, make sure you hug it tight so you can as effecient as you can with it. Remember what areas were difficult for you as a killer and try and learn what made them hard so you can replicate it.
---
Remember that you shall die.
---
I've also had this, and as survivor I've had invisible gens
---
I always find these funny like, says the salty killer main? üòÇ
---
Pretty sure it's like this week
---
this Tuesday
---
This Tuesday. 18th of June.
---
Bruh this isn‚Äôt salt, this is spreading word around the community to prevent survivors from getting him nerfed
---
Oh ok, ty!
---
Just tell them to pull them off and give them a back rub. 
---
Everything'll be fine.
---
Thank you xP
---
ty &lt;3
---
Pig traps dont activate after gens have been done though?
---
My fiance and I both play. I'm a noob and toxic players don't frustrate me nearly as much as when I see that I was just plain outmatched by more experienced people (as killer). I try to zen out and take it as a chance to learn, but it's also incredibly frustrating to just plain be outplayed at every turn. That's when I hand over the remote and say "Your turn"
---
Before I played as the killer I played as survivor so I could get a feel for what it was like to dodge, hide etc. I wanted to get a feel for survivors tendencies. Where do they go after being unhooked etc... 
---
Most of what you will learn now will be trial and error, but use your experience as killer to anticipate what to do and not to do. 
---
I find when being chased it‚Äôs about second guessing which way you‚Äôll dodge the strike or which side of the wall you run behind. I try to be as unpredictable as possible but can and do lay myself. However, it‚Äôs really all dependent on the map your playing on and which killer your up against.
---
Neither is being camped....
---
My life too lol.

---
Yeah, it can be really frustrating especially after rank reset or when you can tell some people deranked on purpose just to troll and grief less experienced players :/ I usually just step away from the computer when it starts getting to me.
---
Weird, i have worse config than yours and i have 60-80 fps on medium

---
8 gb DDR3

---
...That's not how it works
---
Im not complaining in the slightest about seeing some Bill ass, however, would a nsfw tag be prudent?
---
Me and my friends played about 6 hours today and were camped every time. And it's not even like we were annoying the killers or something. We waited till he found us --&gt; emote and not run away --&gt; hooked and facecamped. 
---
Some said in aftergame they dont want to farm. Ok no problem. But they were not ashamed to take free kills from an unsuspecting survivor.
---
You might attempt a save with a basement camping LF but you damn sure don't pull it off. Fucking lies just tricklin from that shithole in your face.
---
Oh my god. You just delved into the deepest darkest pits of my subconscious. That game was for gameboy right? I loved the bathroom mission. xD
---
1 to face camp and 1 to slug...no thank you.
---
Nope
---
No one knows
---
I feel like this should be base
---
If i recall correctly devs said they wont be doing a clown killer or a killer that talks and here we are with Clown and Plague.
---
No one cares about your shitty stream
---
New Perk 
---
We‚Äôre Gonna Farm Forever!
---
LOL
---
It‚Äôs still a good perk for countering tunnelers.
---
Yes, but is this from the original film? I believe they couldn't do the original look because of the liscening or something. I could be wrong
---
That's an outfit you can buy for Ghost Face in-game.
---
The last sentence doesnt fit with the rest of your comment.
---
Ah-ooooo, werewolves of....Autohaven.
---
Mfw I facecamp
---
Yep somehow with a friend they replayed the game, he and I wanted them to be as survivors
---
Yea GG, y‚Äôall were really good üòÇ
---
Looks like a trashbag
---
claudettes
---
Since when can xenomorphs shapeshift? And I also think 5 seconds is too long. Although the idea would be neat for a different killer
---
American Werewolf in London?
---
Nah
---
Boosted Werewolf in The Swamp
---
Valid point, the mode would mostly have to revolve around survivors working together to escape instead of doing their own thing wandering alone.
---
Looping and chase knowledge come with time. Map knowledge and character knowledge. Etc. However running lithe and dance with me will aid you in losing the killer mid chase. Maybe a happy medium for now until your looping gets better. 
---
If you want to accelerate your looping learning curve. Then watch good streamers. Watch jow they take the killer. Look at the way they utilize the map and obstacles. I highly recommend Fungoose for helping you learn the maps and spots that are optimal for looping. He explains a lot of stuff and is generally cool to watch. I learnt a lot from him
---
This applies to Laurie when I run Object of Obsession.
---
Its 1k points in a couple seconds is why. 1500 if you last 10 seconds. 
---
If they don't care about teammates thats a lot of points compared to 1200 for sitting on a gen to 100%
---
Asgore new killer i see
---
Omg, meg tried the z-wall infinite
---
Then you‚Äôre just as bad, hypocrite.
---
On 18th.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt put much thought into your rank, it‚Äôs just going to make the game less enjoyable the higher you go.
---
Probably not. The devs primarily care about PC when it comes to this. Sucks cuz I‚Äôm also a console player
---
Ghost Face should be released on Tuesday.
---
Both sides are toxic.
---
Crying

This sounds tough if the doors are right next to each other

There‚Äôs no way you can‚Äôt get it open if the doors are far enough
