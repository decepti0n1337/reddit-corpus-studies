The face a Freddy main makes when all survivors have adrenaline.
---
---
---
Poor excuses for poor gameplay.
---

---
Sorry the hatch isn't a guaranteed escape anymore. You'll live.
---
They don't have to lose you and heal. Take 2 hits, get downed, rescued, healed by others, get hit again, the 4th hit is free and you get the exhaustion-free speed boost to boot.
---
That's very nice!
---
in the comment section, where a comment would be
---
Holy shit shut the fuck up with your political comments on a post of you complaining about a video game because the killer was playing smart
---
another autist!
---
again i didnt know what perks i had on her, it was prob when i sucked ass at nurse
---
True and agreed, the actual effect would need a bit of tuning to not be so borderline broken, but I feel that Freddy should be more a playstyle about getting more people into the dream world to toy with, yeah?
---

THE HOFFINATOR!
---
That about sums it up
---
Crapper is overrated, we need the Fapper
---
I’m feeling a lil woozy here...
---
This dude hasn't played since the clown was released lmao I'm just tryna get him caught up
---
Yes but the light is on
---
Thank you so much!
---
Because they don't know how to deal with it yet. But it's no rocket science really. Harder to pull off as survivor than avoid as killer
---
Sinners greed is like inverted bbq and chili, it’s weird and I like it.
---
The ability sounds like a shittier billy
---
But the oozing walls were a normal occurrence in the krusty krab
---
The lights are dimly lit on them when unfinished in game on occasion
---
You know, I could definitely see consuming the red tier add ons that way you don’t get trapper mains with auto setting traps or anything but the others I’d like to see them disappear after 2 games, that way you’re not burning through them as fast but I see what you’re saying how it’s a give and take
---
Lots of people seem to want this combo... fuck it, I'll give it a go
---
Am a Wraith main, can confirm this is accurate.
---
And i oop- who cut up all of Lisa's wigs?
---
Flashes of light.Not a bright stream like the one in the cinematic
---
But it did change the power itself
---
That slug race at the end had me laughing so hard.
---
Got it I wasnt sure what level it reset at
---
r/DBDGoneGay
---
True, but part of why he's ranked as a "Hard" killer is just that he's kinda bad, haha.  
---
I do like playing him though, because when games go just right it's a fun time for both sides.
---
You can’t actually estimate where a person is from based on the languages. I also believe that you usually get region locked to only find people in your region but that might be wrong.
---
Bu-bu-bu tunneling with double block addons and noed is how you play him...
---
People need to realise he's a stall killer, not a tunnel/endgame based killer.
---
This is why I follow u on reddit
---
Idk how that daily exists, I thought they patched the 2 killers in one game exploit.
---
I mean what's the advantage if you can see them already verse seeing them in green? it still would help the fan base that can't see them
---
1. I refuse.
---
2. No such thing.
---
3. No one touches this beautiful physique with a filthy pallet.
---
4. You want me to use the door like some kind of peasant? Didn't think so.
---
5. Generators are loud and generate carbon monoxide. I stay as far away from any active ones as possible.
---
Sounds good! I'll send a request later.
---
No. His resolution is stretched.
---
You: No Kills
---
Entity: "Fine, I'll do it myself"
---
Sounds like a fun game have an upvote and I'll try it out sometime
---
Would change the name to "The Knight" so it follows the other killers names.
---
He’s not bad, he’s just not for everyone. I’m here to tell you I can crush it as Freddy and I’ve played against other players who are really good with him as well.
---
3. the immersed bois
---
Yeah no.
---
Camping after the doors are opened already is perfectly reasonable since you can't exactly go patrol gens (since none are active) and going to the door on the other side of the map is just asking for the survivors to open the door next to you, unhook the survivor, and escape. That's not even going into the fact that it's not really camping if the survivors won't go away from the hook; if I'm killing one of you and two of you are just standing around waiting for me to leave, I really don't have a reason to leave.....
---
Tunneling with Dying Light is a legit strategy that is heavily rewarded by the game itself, even if it's a dick move. Also, it's actually a pretty decent idea to tunnel a bad survivor and get them to waste pallets for the good ones if you know you can capitalize on it later down the line. If I get into a game against one of the Survivors who just drops the pallets the moment they get to them, you best believe I'm taking advantage of that.
---
There are some instances when those tactics are valid. Camping when there are still 4 generators that needs to be done is a bad idea, but if the Survivors are literally just standing around waiting for the unhook then you can't blame the killer when it works.
---
Done
---
Yes
---
The first part might be true but if I got region locked why did I find those guys and then immediately after found people from my country (Brazil) with 50 ping
---
I miss his videos.
---
Good meme though :)
---
I'm really hopeful for the rework, I just hope they get it right. Not OP but at least more dangerous. I'm sure they will have to find an easy medium on how the dreamworld works so fingers crossed!
---
Body blocking for a chainsaw hit is fine. 
---
Body blocking so that you can keep a person from playing the game or doing anything until the game ends is bannable.
---
My favorite underrated perk is **Hangman's Trick**; it causes broken hooks to respawn for the Killer after 30-10 seconds.
---
One handed gaming
---
Retuuuurrrn the slaaaaaab... or suffer my cuuuurrrsse.
---
Didn't even see it until you grabbed it. How hard is it to use the share button?
---
I would stop playing Jane if her thiccness was nerfed.
---
It’s an interesting suggestion, I would hope there’d be an option to go back and use the originals though, some would probably look better than others.
---
You shouldn’t get “bullied” with plague. But the fact you admit playing killer you get bullied is an eye opener; most survivor mains will never admit how stressful playing killer is
---
Tutorials aren’t complete
---
I still think its alright for stalling especially if you use it with sloppy and maybe coulraphobia
---
Ok that's like hella fucking cool
---
What do you mean?
---
[deleted]
---
Honestly I think I'm going to just throw away the first ghostface game I get into by letting the survivors do the gens, opening the door myself, and then just teabagging the shit out of them when they run to leave.
---
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT, YOU LITTLE SHITS!
---
Yes, but I wouldn't call it a waste if you enjoy the game and want to play as killer. Its a handicap regardless and if no changes will be made, it's either play survivor or try to adapt. I tried everything and gave up recently. Used to run Stridor, bloodhound and whilst those perks made it easier at times....I still feel like a bird box killer because scratch marks are barely visible. pubg lets people change blood to the color blue, but I'm not asking for changes like that because it can be abused. Let's hope they can implement something that would give us CBers a chance.
---
Top left right under the timer between the hay and the barrels if that makes sense
---
Thank you!
---
you downloaded the game, but has it finished installing?
---
Double check the tutorials
---
So you’re still saying it takes no skill, I’m not disagreeing in that In some circumstances it’s over powered but when the survivors have earned that free hit by losing the chase and doing protection things on another survivor it’s a great perk and if you don’t know after they fully heal after taking the 4th hit the aura is available for the remainder of the match
---
I dont tbag but i get camped anyways
---
For you.
---
I am not sure if you are aware, but the killer can open the exit gates too
---
Basement time!
---
its the new Groovy!
---
Don't know why the f. My comments keep deleting themselves, but how would you open the gates while camping?
---
Yup
---
Jeff is fine how he is, he's a bigger guy. As much as I get your concept, a lot of these people are ordinary citizens so it makes sense only some of them appear fit or muscular. I imagine they're stuck in a loop in their world, anyway.
---
The hook could be right next to an exit gate, so you have no time to lose
---
“Purcahse”
---
Okay this is epic :D
---
"making memes is plagiarism"
---
Devs said everyone is over 21
---
The Legion ones would be amazing and make sense for their characters but I really don’t want one for The Pig. I like it as is now because I can imagine it’s actually Shawnee Smith under the mask, I wouldn’t want a generic face
---
Thats a glitch.
---
When they don't understand that it's not the fact that you lost, its how it happened that pisses you off. Feels bad man.
---
[Yup.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjZdHdd88jo)
---
Sudoku?
---
That doesn't happen often, not in any of my games so far, and if the survivors find the totem before the survivor dies, again, they can just unhook him and body block, not a long way to the exit if you hook them next to an open gate
---
I can't understand why I am getting so many down votes, lololololol.
---
I tried to get some nurse hits for a daily this afternoon. Needless to say I sucked. One of the survivors went out of his way to send a friend request on Ps4 to mock me.
---
Probably one of the ones posting on here about how NOED 'ruins his enjoyment'.
---
Pusssieeeessssss.  As a level 15 survivor who just keeps on sucking I still see people DC. Fucking trash babies.
---
It just makes sense if Jeff is running around all the time, vaulting over windows and dropping pallet that he would look slimmer and more fit. Unless the entity makes any form of exercise pointless.
---
What you could try doing is not tunneling and attacking the rescuer instead
---
I’d cry in terror if a xenomorph climbed over a wall
---
I do believe that is a Jonjon's Wacky Quest reference.
---
Shush, I'm trying to bait edgelords into being as edgy as possible.
---
I like the concept, but I think something like that wouldn't happen because the survivors are in the entity world.
---
Yea I like that idea, on top of getting cosmetics upon every prestige, you get a body shape cosmetic aswell. It’ll never happen though
---
Did you do both the survivor and killer tutorials? You can't play the actual game until you play both.
---
When he bein toxic of course
---
Same tbh. I didn't know what some of them meant
---
Yes I did both
---
So the entity does affect their exercise?
---
I think it is a waste if you're trying to get decent kills in and not be bullied during- and post-game (I get "lol blind killer" a lot). I hate having to run bloodhound when I play Myers or Legion because I could be running Spirit Fury instead.
---
OOF I am mad stupid. Glad you enjoyed it!
---
Hmm, only with Myers, bubba or Billy since they can instadown without noed, with other killers, it wouldn't work you know
---
Or you could play PC and get nurses instead. 🙃
---
Probably at least another month. It wasn’t supposed to even be officially announced until May 28th.
---
By pressure you mean camping then sure
---
Sounds like you're just defending yourself for camping with noed in this comment section
---
If you are getting Facecamped then just kill yourself so you can get into another match quicker and try again. *shrug*
---
No
---
You don't owe me anything but if you don't listen to opinions of the opposite side out of grudge you are the problem.
---
Holy shit I expected to pop into maybe a 5 minute video at most.
---
I'm not watching two fucking hours, dude.
---
Exactly. Imagine playing lerys and look up at the ceiling to see the xeno just sitting there.
---
Plague is nowhere near as good as huntress in the hands of a person who knows how to use her. Huntress has amazing snowball potential, can zone areas too, down you very fast, and is very hard to loop if done correctly. Smart players don't even heal against the plague. You have to heal against a good huntress. If she finds you and you're hurt, you're going down no matter what. i hover in the red ranks and plague gets ran every time. If you're level 8 or up, disregard everything you see on how a character is played. While rank doesn't matter that much, you see a big skill gap in rank 1 killers vs ones in the yellow ranks.
---
How can you be chased by the killer if you are the killer??
---
I chainsawed 2 different Claudettes in a corn field completely un expectedly in 1 game. Both times I was just trying to travel only to run into someone
---
When you finish post you have to press save and close
---
I'm the survivor. I'M IN CHARGE HERE!
---
They just look like cosmetics for both killers and survivors. They hang off the waists of survivors and off the hooks for killers. I'm willing to bet charms are attained after doing certain challenges like escaping a certain amount of times or sacrificing a number of survivors.
---
The rescuer needs to go through an unhook animation that can be interrupted with a grab. Alternatively, you can hit them when they are next to the hook, force them to rescue, and land another hit right after the rescue happens. In these cases, unless you suck, you are always guaranteed a kill
---
He did to one of Mine too- but in a disappointing way :,(
---
That? No. Swings to hit survivors who are bodyblocking the hook in the dreamworld? Yes (which I've had happen to me).
---
This should be a criminal offense
---
I was able to play with out doing the tutorials
---
Oh. So like, if you are in an swf and wanna bodyblock you can literally just get an asleep person and an awake person and Freddh can do nothing? I never knew that...
---
He is right, no survivor perk can be called a crutch at this point. Exhaustion git a nerf, self care got a nerf, DS got reworked... The only perks I ever had problems with was old DS, and Noed. And nurse is just yikes in general.
---
&gt; Dwight isn't actually delivering pizza.
---
That motherfucker better hurry up before I complain to corporate.  He either gets on his [PeeWee Herman](https://townsquare.media/site/443/files/2014/03/pee-wees-big-adventure-movie-poster-10205481041.jpg?w=980&amp;q=75) bike &amp; shit out a pizza for me or Imma blow up social media!
---
I don't camp with NOED because I don't use it. Just a waste of a perk slot that only works when the game ends
---
Did You buy it used?
---
I know but its still cool.
---
I think they should keep it..give their power something unqiue to help them after using it
---
Tihi
---
Nope
---
Literally every killer outside of nurse and huntress.
---
1. never said i was a survivor main
---
2. saying that i shouldn't get bullied while playing plague is implies that you're putting down someone for not being great at plague in a very passive aggressive way. The other implication is that you think she's OP, but someone who finds her difficult to play, which a lot of people do, can't get her to work that way for them yet
---
3. If your main point is "I agree that playing killer is stressful" or "it's nice to see that people are okay with admitting they have some short-comings when it comes to this game" just say that and don't pepper in your prejudices and put-downs
---
Lightborn or overwhelming presence work pretty decently against lights in my opinion
---
2 in 1 game
---
Billy's good too and huntress. Besides that results may very. You need to learn every killer specifically and even then some killers can be taken advantage of
---
Naw
---
even if he's the same height he's still got some extra pzazz that makes him more interesting
---
Doesn't do shit to warrant it: 
---
Toxic survivors: tbag
---
Their face when I mori them: :o
---
Yay! Now I know that meme's name, thanks!
---
Come on people pumpkinhead will be perfect for this game
---
and here i thought that nea was the entity steppin on cats
---
🙏
---
Wait for it to finish downloading
---
I finally realized what it was, the game on my actual PlayStation installed but not on my extended storage
---
Thank you all for your help
---
Nope and fuck off!
---
Is there still a today on steam forums post?
---
Oh fair enough

You always loee add-ons.  If you have more than one of a specific add on, it will automatically reload it for the next game.  If you run out, you will have an empty slot
---
Yes it is
---
Hey I never said my memory was reliable

I know what black box does, it's just a one and done and kinda useless after that. I don't think it should be ultra rare.

I’d love to see Samara from The Ring.
---
You don't play by their "rules" at that point. Use every trick to mess with them too. Even if it means camping/hard patroling (when they hookdive), tunneling, NOED, etc. 
---
Their post-game salt is an indicator of a job well done.
---
[Hey, I found you!](https://imgur.com/a/xFDYAnw)

Fucking spoilers!

Thanks for the info. I'll delete
---
Suicide via blade stab to the gut.
---
Trapper, Leatherface and Freddy, wraith kinda are pretty low tier. Clown,pig doctor and Micheal are mid tier. Spirit huntress nurse, hillbilly ,hag, Plague are pretty high tier at least I think plague I haven't played her but she seems good. Legion are in the middle for being trash and good so I don't know. Ghostface seems like a high tier but probably going to get nerfed to low mid when he comes out. All of this is just my opinion though so idk.
---
Weird how people like to try out new things
---
I love your dedication to Amanda
---
What games do have colorblind mode? Genuinely curious
---
Happy cake day!
---
Love it!!!!!
---
Players being shitting is on shitty players. If they’re having THAT bad experience, maybe it’s just them being bad.
---
Happens to us all, man.
---
Also, how did you get the little clay noodles so small?
---
Boi why is leatherface so high as a leatherface main his ability is only good for camping and open fields besides that leatherface is weak at map pressure. I agree with everything else but plague but I don't want to really argue about it as it is all opinion and I can't judge.
---
Myers with 3 of his perks “oh your going for Adept ok no wonder....oh just a daily then oh....” 
---
Next game as huntress and a 4K “gg!” 
---
Survivors: “.........”
---
I know a lot of shooters do and a few first person games do I believe even assassin's creed has it
---
If you camp, that allows the other survivors do to something. I always saw it as an option, unfortunately it gets shit on because it’s at someone else’s expense. But the whole game is give and take. Shame that no one understands that.
---
:)
---
It switched to the generic soundtrack on the main menu when the mid-chapter patch came out. Killers have their respective chapter themes when selected.
---
Yup.
---
Pig &gt; Trapper and Leather
---
I god, it's  Shaggy, he gonna zoink our ass!
---
Boi. Leather face is still a strong M1 killer and has an instadown built in. And plague has range abillites
---
Well Nurse and Billy are top, then Spirt. 
---
After I rank Huntress/Clown/Plague all the same tier for the ranged powers. 
---
Micheal then Hag. 
---
Then Pig and Legion. 
---
Then we have Freddy, Wraith, Leatherface, Trapper. 
---
Ghostface ill place with Mike and Hag
---
Online gaming has gotten to the point that if some dipshit trips over their internet cable, they will send you a nasty message an hour later bitching about what a piece of dcing shit you are and you clearly suck at the game and should get cancer.  How is it no one can just say, "well shit, I lost.  Next!" instead of blaming everything from perks to team to the weather in fucking Timbuktu.
---
Leatherface has an instadown and trapper can apply better map pressure.
---
That could be a downside, yes. But if there was more than one, then they could spawn closer to the survivor. It’ll just be a nice tweak to add possibly. Maybe the closest totem to the nearest group of survivors would be dull, and the furthest would be the lit one.
---
While normally I don’t condone these tactics, when a TOXIC swf comes into my lobby, all bets are off. If not toxic then not so much
---
I mean yeah but have you ever tried using the ability on smart people? Because oh boy it's fucking useless sure he is great at demolishing new and carefree players but shit is the ability useless when going against good players that stick to walls.
---
bro, its toxic to loop...
---
Killers asked for a concede option for ages and no one gave a shit.
---
You know I don't hate the legion anymore. I don't DC anymore automatically when I see it's legion, their game play has changed a lot, and there is no more of the moon walking bulshit! I even messaged a Susie today telling them I had fun vs. Them. She had great gameplay, map pressure and didn't camp or tunnel. The points were great for everyone.
---
rarely do i like a post so much as to go out of my way to actually upvote it and comment how amazing it is, but here i am
---
It was more of a way to prevent hatch stand offs I think. besides, EGC is still fairly new and people most likely want to see the kill animation.
---
I believe people only do it to see the kill animation and I bet it won't happen in a month but some killers do it to bully survivor because they either were salty at that person or they were toxic and deserve to get game ended by the entity.
---
Probably design, yeah. Don't they have lisemce to the whole costume?
---
FUS RO -WHEEZE-
---
Was that as good for you as it was for me?
---
Leatherface’s chainsaw is only used for camping and maybe an odd chance ender. Trapper has map pressure sure but so does Pig. RBT’s can slow the game down pretty well if ur lucky. Also her zero terror radius makes her ability to scare the shit out of survivors very useful to keep survs on their toes. Trapper can pressure, but it’s not as guaranteed as RBT pressure. Also Pigs perks are all pretty useful. Trapper has pretty crap perks and Leatherface’s perks are the only reason people level him up.

---
way to prove him right
---
I feel ghostface js going to get nerfed in  2-4 weeks after release because of his one shot personally I believe he won't be op but people feel the need to bitch because they can't always escape even though surviving is supposed to be a rare occurrence not happen every single damn game.
---
I hate the survivor code that they insist killers follow. It’s not like this is For Honor...
---
Warner bros owns him. Platinum dunes owned the remake. Which grossed more money than the first 4 original movies made put together. I dont see why they couldnt try to aquire the rights to get him as a cosmetic. If they charge 5.00 for licensed killers they could just charge another 5.00 for the cosmetic. Most of the good cosmetics cost 10 dollars anyways.
---
Oh yeah the Killer should run off towards the exit gate so you can save the person, instead of doing the smart thing and confirming at least one sacrifice along with possibly another when survivors do the dumb thing and try to save in this situation.
---
How dumb would it be if a Killer said “hey man it’s messed up that you did gens as fast as you could, it makes it real hard for me to win”
---
You shouldn’t run Thana on any killer unless your other perks are garbage like predator.
---
We have 3 killers who can one shot...Techally a few more..so i dont think he will get nerfed for this. 
---
The rest of his power is a bit weak anyway and doesnt help in a chase. He will be mid tier at least.
---
I too want to kill myself with numbers
---
I hate when I'm doing a gen and they go to destroy a hook. Like why go ahead and let all of china hear us.
---
Link?
---
This is it chief. As someone who plays trapper and leatherface this sums up why both killers are pretty low tier. Also to add trappers traps barely catch anyone outside of chases because people are paying attention to the ground when not being chased.
---
I know they did reboot Freddy for licensing/money reasons, but I know fans would have been happier with Robert's Freddy. No shade to Jackie Earle Haley but the reboot was terrible I'm my opinion.
---
If I see the Lion on my team missing an Earthspike everything automatically becomes his fault.
---
There are several videos but this is the one I’m currently watching https://youtu.be/gi9s7BJ2omQ
---
I had one under ground beside me, just his head was visible.. Was disconcerting to say the least.
---
Nah. When she turns her head to the side with hair shes hot. The other side not. I promise go recheck her. Shes like two face.
---
actually it was "played"
---
I played against this guy too once and posted it here got me into trouble though lmao
---
Funny thing is, it's actually in a really good spot; no gens near it, right up in a little corner hidden from most angles of vision. Sometimes you just can't get past your horrible luck :(
---
Yeah, I agree Sinner’s Greed sound fun.
---
Idk it honestly depends how fast he gets it and how long it lasts. Personally I feel a midish low tier because if it's short then you'll need to actually be stealthy but if it's long then it probably bumps him to high mid tier. Plus is ability is pretty odd and unlike the other one shots
---
Ghostface is definitely gonna have an identity in game but I think he was all dark beneath the mask because I know from personal experience when I dressed up as Ghostface in High School, I wore a black ski mask beneath the mask to make the mask look more menacing if you looked through the eyes.
---
Facepalm*
---
The reboot is hella dark though. It's scary but I don't want scary with freddy krueger. I want silly freddy. They would have to negotiate it so if we ask for it enough they may give us him.
---
Wot.
---
I think that the add-ons listed aren't very useful. And literally none of them would work the way I've always played Legion.
---
UwU u so warm ~~~~
---
I think you completely missed OPs point.
---
So for hemorrhagic status we bleed more, but honestly does this even help the killer? Ive put on sloppy butcher and even then I still cant see blood. It either disappears into tall grass or is the same color as dirt and is hardly noticeable. Is there something im missing?
---
That's fine, you play how you want. The issue is that you're calling other people toxic for how they choose to play. Sure, literal *facecamping* can be immature (only as a form of BM, along with other BM like exit gate taunting), but just *anything that can be considered camping or even tunneling by anyone* is certainly not something to give someone a negative label over. The only thing that truly makes someone deserve any hate is if they are doing something to deliberately BM for the sake of giving other people a bad/unfun time on the game. If they are intending to play normally, and maybe use an unfun strat b/c they don't understand what they should be doing, all they need is some good advice. OP clearly says that, whatever he means by "sitting at the last hook," it was a strategy he was trying to use to win. He was not deliberately trying to hurt anyone's feelings or give anyone a bad time.
---
He is a top tier, i love that guy
---
Sticky traps would be pretty awesome.
---
Just says page couldn't load what did it say?
---
It’s not that it’s a bad strategy, but it is a-hole behavior. Do it if you want but you’re going to get shit for it
---
Captain marvel, bitch please

This would be perfect for when ever his rework finally arrives. But for now, I don't want the legend Robert Englund on that garbage lol

11 Trapper

12 Wraith

13 Pig
---
14 Freddy 
---
15 Legion 
---
Legion is the worst since the recent nerf basically killed his power and no +5% movement speed means nothing. 
---
Freddy is still the current worst killer in the game but I have hope that the rework will improve him. 
---
Pig is low because of the recent nerf that removed her endgame capabilities hopefully she gets a buff to compensate for that in the future. 
---
Spirit is higher than huntress because of her mobility.
---
I think it's better than Ruin for Hag atleast, you put your traps near the nearby generators and survivors are forced to go in the danger zone for 120 seconds
---
From what ive seen of the early gameplay, and note its praoblyn not done, both of his powers are super short. 
---
The Stalking only takes like 5 seconds and lasts 15. 
---
His Stealth lasts forever until he is seen, then it lasts 5 with a 30 second cooldown to it.
---
Many thanks, kind internet stranger. :)
---
Ah a good bubba meme that isn't about camping.
---
Yaint wrong
---
Accurate
---
His hand is the power glove though? Pablo makes his hand from one.
---
Yeah. Come back around to hooks, or stay if you strongly suspect someone is near the hook. Pressure the rescue.
---
Imagine the head with the Halloween glowy body. It'd look demonic af. I want 12.
---
Why would you swing at a awake survivor.
---
I kinda think 15 a little high maybe 12 or so because isn't his ability supposed by stealth not just stalk someone chase them then one hit them. I mean then again they are testing it so those probably aren't actual numbers we'll get. He looks fun though.
---
It's not dumb if it works
---
Sometimes camping is something you have to do. It's not a 100% **BAD KILLER** callsign. A good Killer patrols the hooks *and* gens, camps when someone is coming and tunnels if they have too. Their goal is to kill ASAP. Not stretch the game to the Collapse.
---
I've never heard a footstep. I've seen monto hear footsteps.
---
From my understanding, hes supposed to trigger his Stleath, then use his crouch and peeking skills to expose them before running up and downing them before they get a change to do anything. 
---
Once in a chase his power, at least the stealth part, isnt as useful, though im pretty sure he can still stalk in a chase for the expose, though hes like myers and slowed down massvily. 
---
It takes longer to expose them when hes not stealthed
---
Dude you fucked up the game and you're whining about wasting less than 3 minutes?
---
Clowns ability is so basic, I'm glad you have fun with it, but I don't think he is even close to being high tier in terms of fun
---
This reminds me of those halloween ghostface outfits that would have a pump thing you could squeeze and make your mask all bloody.
---
Using autistic is an insult? How mature.
---
I LOVE this idea 😍💜
---
When I play a lot of huntress I keep hearing her singing for a while...
---
Stacked on top of each other.
---
Oof did he tunnel you too?
---
^And don’t worry I reap the few karma I get from this in ur honor
---
It is in a good, tucked away spot, unfortunately that spot was within the first 5 or 6 steps from spawning.
---
mori time

Gee, I wonder what that means

Ppl who saying I’m crying about him... where?

I mentioned he was toxic because it would help make his name more sense

---
New Objective: Survive
---
When I'm gonna hit that survivor that's been t-bagging the whole game and next hook is death for them: ***HEAVY BREATHING***
---
Otherwise, yeah, playing killer is really stressful, ironically. One thing about this game that I regret is that survivors don't shit their pants often enough while killers have to pay in tears and sweat for their victory. XD
---
Well, you aren't wrong. All you could do to counter that is STBFL
---
&gt;Legion is the worst since the recent nerf basically killed his power and no +5% movement speed means nothing. 
---
So getting a free hit at the beginning of every chase isnt good? For a non-instadown killer, they're pretty good. If you know how to go against loops/have perks built to go against loops and pallets, I can definitely see a good legion being upper midtier.
---
Leatherface is not better than trapper or pig, no doubt about that one. He has such a low skill ceiling and a chainsaw that isnt very practical, especially without addons that make his chainsaw charge faster, and most of his addons are so miniscule in effect they aren't worth running. Id argue he's worse than freddy and legion, but I don't feel like defending freddy for the 100th time I've done it, freddy is not the worst though I will say that. 
---
Hag should be higher than myers, plague should not be lower than clown
---
I feel your pain. When the new season started I was at 12. Now I am back down to 15. I will have days where I can get back up to 13 but as soon as that happens it is camp and tunnel city. I will gain a pip and then loose 2 or 3 in a row because I am the first caught and get camped and tunneled.  It has been so terrible.  I didn't participate in the event because of the same issues and the obscene amount of mori's on the second day I played. I hadn't played for a week almost on console and picked it back up today. Still a very mixed group of killers. 
---
I also play on PC where I am a rank 8/9. The camping and tunneling hasn't been so bad for me there. I still die a lot but the killers I guess are just better players on there overall.
---
I run deliverance and DS nowadays haha
---
I run DS and deliverance nowadays x) And I agree with the laste statement!
---
I don't know guys I think this dead horse needs some more beating
---
Id argue doctor makes that more enjoyable since its so sadistic
---
In all honesty I could watch Monto and Puppers play forever and not get bored
---
Like I said that was just unfinished so it's really hard to say until he comes out
---
hummm hairy otter dwight PLEASE
---
The awkward truth, it's hard for those Russians with their dads 56k modem to hear, but if your internet is a joke, then sorry but you may actually have to play civ 5
---
Who shit in your survivor pudding lol?
---
I have some pretty controversial placements on my tier list, can't wait for the hundreds of comments telling me I'm wrong
---
1. Nurse
---
2.Billy
---
3.Hag
---
4.Spirit
---
5.Huntress
---
6.Mike
---
7.Freddy
---
8.Pig
---
9.Wraith
---
10. Doc
---
11. Trapper
---
12. Plague
---
13. Clown
---
14. Legion
---
15. Plague
---
Eh. He is kind of full of himself
---
Its interesting but the hindrance from him is much more annoyance than anything else
---
That's fuckin metal. I want it.
---
In what way? I haven’t noticed anything like that
---
Pretty much this. DCing should be punished absolutely, but maybe we could also improve player experience to help with this also.
---
Then again, player experience hasn't exactly been the key element of DBD haha. I remember the early days with so much nonsense from glitches to cheaters to infinite jungle gyms to 1.0 moris
---
Absolutely.
---
I agree.
---
Ah, my mistake. I could have sworn it wasn't there originally like the spongebob reference on one of the perks.
---
1) Nurse
---
2-3) Spirit/Billy
---
4) Huntress
---
5) Hag
---
6) Myers
---
7) Plague (survivors not cleansing can make her weaker but you can already start with corrupted pools with add-ons)
---
8) Clown
---
9) Trapper
---
10) Doctor
---
11) Pig
---
12) Legion 
---
13) Wraith
---
14) Leatherface
---
15) Freddy  
---
In terms of which killer I think is the most fun to play, definitely Spirit. She’s super rewarding.
---
Bingo. I liked him at first, but as I watched more it was cringe.
---
Needs to break on killers that leave lobbies
---
BHVR really need to implement proper checks on totem spawns. They did it a while back with hooks but forgot to do totems. On spawn there needs to be a radius check for a generator and a used player spawn, if either of these are found don't spawn there and try another spot.
---
Better than the actual later saw films.
---
I think it's just more observation is needed. Like for example if they run into a locker I've noticed a lot more blood is left behind when they are haemorrhaged.
---
Insta dodge
---
At most it delays 4 minutes. I had survivors hold games up for half an hour. This is better
---
I am lev 17 and it is the same thing. It’s absolutely annoying to the point where I don’t feel like playing anymore. Why wait that long
---
You and I must be watching completely different people if you say he thinks every problem is someone/something else. He's always admitted when he's fucked up. You may be thinking of TydeTyme with the "Can't stand anyone that disagrees with him because his opinion is always the right one"
---
I was going too but in order to save space I just decided to cut those 3 out. But thank you so much!
---
Not even wrong lol
---
Oh boy I sure do love how kind and nice this community is.
---
And what if I download game to ps4 pro as I don’t want to have disk inside all the time. Will that reset my 1M points or will I simply continue
---
Unrealistic. Only half the totems would go
---
I've found a few killers doing this lately.
---
The difference in those games being that I have a gun and we are on equal terms in a symmetrical game.
---
Right now Im messaging someone who dced after getting looped for a long time and then calls us Ass. Lmao! And says garbage Survivors lol
---
Remember it, write it i don't give a fuck.
---
Teabag all the way all day.
---
“What the fuck do you want from me, Charlotte?!?”
---
You guys sound like you're a part of the dbd community.
---
“Ok Meg, we’re less than a minute into the game and you’ve already missed three skill checks. I don’t even have Ruin. Go home, you’re drunk.”
---
“So getting a free hit at the beginning of every chase isnt good? For a non-instadown killer, they're pretty good. If you know how to go against loops/have perks built to go against loops and pallets, I can definitely see a good legion being upper midtier.” 
---
No getting a hit at the beginning of a chase doesn’t make legion anywhere mid tier
---
Nurse myres (in t1) Pig (while crouching unless they have sprint burst) and spirit all can get a hit at the beginning of the chase but after that unless it’s a nurse or spirit they just get looped like normal killers. Legion getting a free hit doesn’t change the fact he can’t down people with his ability anymore. 
---
“Leatherface is not better than trapper or pig, no doubt about that one. He has such a low skill ceiling and a chainsaw that isnt very practical, especially without addons that make his chainsaw charge faster, and most of his addons are so miniscule in effect they aren't worth running. Id argue he's worse than freddy and legion, but I don't feel like defending freddy for the 100th time I've done it, freddy is not the worst though I will say that.”
---
LF having a low skill ceiling means doesn’t change the fact that he has an insta down. 
---
Trapper spends a lot of time placing his traps around the map which could be time spend looking for survivors.
---
And pig is no longer good in the endgame which was her main strength is now gone. Taking the traps off her head takes some time yes but 3 other survivors are doing the objective so it doesn’t mean that much. 
---
Freddy is the worst killer because he has a 7 second timer between him and becoming an m1 killer. He has the worst power in the game. No using an ultra rare addon and a very rare addon to reduce a time only makes him viable that one game where you have the addons. 
---
“Hag should be higher than myers, plague should not be lower than clown”
---
Hag isn’t higher than myres because her ability can be countered by a flashlight, crouching and urban evasion. 
---
Plague is worse than clown because of the clowns ability to control where survivors will go, yes the plague can do the same but only to pallets and windows and that doesn’t slow down survivors. 
---
This is just my opinion.
---
Oh I get that too! But I don't mind because I actually love her lullaby
---
Probably Mikey. He just stands there MENACINGLY. Also ghostface because he can peek around corners and watch you can't wait to scare people as him.
---
Spine Chill would like a word with you
---
When it’s a Myers and he stalks you first
---
Survivors do not keep their items though when they DC?. Ive lost many a good flashlight when DCing to a killers absolute BS build, and or mostly shit teammates.
---
No one.  
---
As boring as this answer may be, this game gets pretty stale horror-wise after twenty hours.  
---
A prayer beads spirit may get me the first time I get grabbed.
---
My ranks feel totally screwed. I've been playing all afternoon and I've only managed to get from rank 18 to 17 as survivor. I took a long break from this game but it feels like no matter how good of a game I have I can only hope for a black pip.
---
I get nervous as soon as I see a bear trap. 
---
The funny thing is that experienced trappers don't really scare me. They trap all the predictable spots - looping pallets, killer shack window. 
---
But there are some trappers who put traps in the most WTF spots that when I run into it I'm just like "WHY ARE YOU THERE!?!?"
---
Bubba probably. Just something about a cannibal wielding a chainsaw while wearing a face mask that creeps me out.
---
I know it used to work only when you were the host, but I'm unsure of whether or not it has been fixed.
---
Does the p3 version keep you out more then the original?
---
Wow, I have 800+ hours in this game and I didn’t even know what hindered did lol
---
Glad to hear that :)
---
I agree the killers aren't scary because you know you can outplay them. They ate only scary for like the initial 12 hours of gameplay. 
---
That is one of the main reason I loved Resident evil 2. You truly feel helpless in some scenarios.
---
Myers. Didnt affect me much until I saw the original movie. Hes genuinely creepy.
---
Of course it does. That is also why I'm a p2 Bubba main with a blackface lol.
---
At this rate, the devs will just nerf blood warden.
---
That would be awesome!
---
Like, seeing videos of VR Chat, I think it could work. It'd be terrifyingly good. I think wiggling out of the killer's grasp is one thing that'd be funny to see lol.
---
I'm a p3 leatherface. Just waiting for ghostface gonna suck because I love leatherface but I also love ghost face so I'm kinda ditching LF as my main for good ol screamy boi. Was fun playing leatherface since I bought the game learning the mechanics as him etc he'll have a special place in my heart but it's time to move on.
---
&gt;How many times have you used adrenaline and at the end game it does nothing?
---
But then you get those games where you get tunneled for 3 gens and then facecamped. But Adrenaline saves your life as you get saved from the hook. It's those situations that make adrenaline one of the if not the best survivor perk
---
Ive read u can game for 1hr per 1 gb but idk
---
&gt; If you don't heal you are going down quickly.
---
Yeah nah, thats aint what happens with good survivors. They wont heal if there is 2-3 gens left, unless its a killer that can get first hits easy like Nurse or Freddy.
---
I think I have fixed the issue. Let me know it it works now.
---
I worded it wrong I use his ability in open or when no pallets are near them or if I know they are gonna drop it charge it then destroy the pallet I admit I was being kinda too negative and making him out as trash so yeah you're correct also I probably sounded stupid because I think something while typing and Basically mess it up. You were kinda rude saying I  don't know how to play killer but it's fine as I did sound completely stupid and too harsh.
---
I like this a lot
---
Insidious time
---
I think a good way that could fix it is more objectives so they can do what they want, sometimes I'll run a Sabo+Totem build and do those with a priority over gens in some matches after I get fed up with something like being tunneled or running into a nodding killer
---
&gt;Legion getting a free hit doesn’t change the fact he can’t down people with his ability anymore. 
---
A free hit shortens chases drastically. Unless the survivors are at an optimal loop, (because there are a lot of bad loops/pallet placements) a killer who knows how to play against loops with 115% movement speed WILL down them. They can also chain hits to get multiple free hits, but thats less important. 
---
&gt;LF having a low skill ceiling means doesn’t change the fact that he has an insta down.
---
Skill ceiling does matter. With a low skill ceiling, it means their ability cannot be improved apon much. The only thing you can really improve on is when to rev your chainsaw and work on not getting baited at pallets. It matters because there's no point in having an instadown ability if it hardly gets used. Outside of camping and open fields, his ability is not worth using, making him an m1 killer with no benefits of the other m1 killers.
---
&gt;Trapper spends a lot of time placing his traps around the map which could be time spend looking for survivors.
---
It's an investment. If you can place your traps well, you'll end chases which would have lasted longer without the trap placements. He can also force survivors out of good loops by placing a trap at the pallet mid chase. While he isnt looking for survivors at the beginning, he's spending time setting up, which can REALLY help you snowball later in the match if you have good placements. 
---
&gt;And pig is no longer good in the endgame which was her main strength is now gone. Taking the traps off her head takes some time yes but 3 other survivors are doing the objective so it doesn’t mean that much.
---
There's a reason tunnelling can work in some occasions you know. 3 people doing gens is much easier to manage than 4 people doing gens, and if you're occupied in a chase then it's 2 people doing gens instead of 3, which adds up. It does mean much, considering the more people off gens means less generators being done. Even If it's just one survivor missing in some situations it really effects the outcome of the match. Also her ambush is pretty good. Against bad loops, you can cut them off, and you can get a free hit if they don't have sprint burst. Also yeah her end game was kinda nerfed, but her traps are still good at 4/5 gens and if they pop all gens with traps on anyone.
---
&gt;Freddy is the worst killer because he has a 7 second timer between him and becoming an m1 killer. He has the worst power in the game. No using an ultra rare addon and a very rare addon to reduce a time only makes him viable that one game where you have the addons. 
---
Freddy is not the worst killer in the game, again, some killer abilities are more like investments, and freddy is one of them. You may not be able to hit for 7 seconds, but for those 7 seconds, you know where survivors are, where they're going, and what they're doing. You can also find other survivors with his ability since you can see them waking up. Again, he does not have the worst power in the game. His power comes with good trade offs if you can use it well, and can be used for finding survivors if you pay attention. 
---
&gt;Hag isn’t higher than myres because her ability can be countered by a flashlight, crouching and urban evasion. 
---
With flashlights/urban evasion, her ability to protect hooks through trapping them goes down, but unless you're going to use a flashlight to break a trap mid chase or crouch mid chase, none of that really matters. She can apply map pressure depending on her trap placements, force survivors out of good loops, and disoriented survivors by using the camera spin to their advantage. She also doesn't have to waste time picking up traps, she can just keep placing them.
---
&gt;Plague is worse than clown because of the clowns ability to control where survivors will go, yes the plague can do the same but only to pallets and windows and that doesn’t slow down survivors. 
---
Clowns ability is just not good enough. The effects are not worth it in many situations. Survivors will either leave the loops that he blocks off or throw down the pallet and camp the pallet because pallet vaulting isnt effected by his bottles. Plagues ability can hurt. With the regular puke, you leave them broken, which can be good, especially if you run pass a corrupted fountain mid chase, they're going to go down for sure. They either have the option to cleanse, which can hurt their whole team, or stay broken, leaving them 1 shot the whole match.
---
It's working 👌🏼
---
That’d probably create more sandbagging random survivors depending on the build they have
---
Seems to happen to most of the DbD streamers when they start to enjoy some modicum of success. They start treating the other players in this game like garbage because they stop viewing them as real people and instead just see them as sources of revenue. 
---
You can see it all the time, they'll pass personal judgements on complete strangers, constantly bitch about how someone is ruining "their" game, and just in general act like the other 4 people owe them good content. Bonus points if they complain about the other players acting "sweaty" or "tryhard".
---
You know, this is the only tier list I've seen with Freddy so high up. While I don't agree with how high he is, he definitely deserve a to be higher than bubba, wraith, and clown imo

I’ll have to check as it doesn’t last long before I either escape or get hooked. So I haven’t noticed
---
:( got nerfed
---
Myers when he’s played well is a beast
---
Honestly I didn't know until I made this
---
Theres a glitch/bug on PS4 (maybe the other platforms too) for the clown.
---
His add on to expose you requires you to be hit directly by the bottle but as of right now only requires you to get intoxicated by the gas. Making it extremely easy to get one hit downs.
---
Pls fix.
---
The game being very unbalanced is I think the main issue. 
---
~ run the killer around for 5 gens, that shows my skill and that I'm better than the killer; get down from NOED and get facecamped, GG. How is that fair?????
---
Here’s the issue though, Freddy without addons is literally just a heavily downgraded Wraith. He’s invisible like wraith, but it doesn’t help him at all since he still has both a terror radius to alert survivors early, he takes longer to get the first hit in his chase which is arguably the most important. Getting multiple people in sleep is his only advantage, but that’s heavily luck based to find multiple people at the same time. In a chase he functions as a mouse 1 Killer.
---
So the only thing I’m saying is, without Class Photo, he is in almost all aspects just a worse Wraith, both in the way his gameplay functions and how he is designed. If they can change some key element to set him apart from the other killers, that would be ideal. I don’t care really if he’s a bad Killer, I don’t really care if he’s not for me (looking at you Plague), but my main concern is that he has nothing that separates him in any way from other killers who play the same way as him, but better.
---
My perk head on allows me to hide in a locker for 10 minutes before stunning the killer
---
*cries in broke* dude I ain’t got 10 fucking dollars to throw a single outfit in a video game lmao
---
I've never tested with DBD but when I played overwatch over LTE it was probably about 300MB/hr. If you've got unlimited you won't really have anything to worry about
---
Agree to disagree on this one.
---
I’ve had several killers that camp all game with fucking DEVOUR HOPE! Like holy fuck how dumb are people seriously. Not only are you ruining the experience for the survivors you’re camping, but you’re also just making yourself look like even more of a dumbass.
---
I don't think there is one online, and I don't think there is a preview in game either to my knowledge. What I would do is just overlay the images of the characters in your preferred photo editor and erase the parts you don't want, due to all the characters standing the exact same with each cosmetic you can get a pretty good image of what they will look like, this is a quick workaround I do for other things like overlaying city skylines or buildings in images, try it! :D
---
Yass, I low key think they made him faster than every other killer because hes the face of dbd.  It's like hes jogging to get you. Then when hes carrying you with agitation hes like sprinting across the map.  Its insane
---
While it is annoying, that's not taking the game hostage. Taking the game hostage requires for one side to make it impossible for the game to end. Slugging you so they can see the new death animation is not that.
---
It's just tiring.
---
I agree with you man. I’ve been playing Legion at Rank 1 since the patch, and I’d say he’s on the stronger side of the mid tier. I think he’s a lot more viable than the likes of Doctor and Trapper, but he definitely struggles a lot more than the top tier Killers.
---
There is a survivor, and a killer. Which one sounds like that should win a 1v1?

HAHAHAHAHAAAAA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Lmao perfect caption!
---
Yeah but I mean a legit Power Glove. White with the black controller pads on top.
---
Feral frenzy hits put them in deep wound. Timer doesn’t start until they’re out of your terror radius/out of chase (can’t quite recall.) The locations of all survivors not in deep wound state who are also within your terror radius are revealed to you upon a successful feral frenzy hit. Missing a feral swing ends the power and drains it entirely.
---
Not sure if sarcastic or not
---
New question. What about downloading it?
---
Theres no match interruptions anymore. Just jump
---
The match I just had is what motivated me to make this. Everyone dc'ed, and I was up against hillbilly in a cold wind farm map (you know, the maps that are filled with corn that he can just sprint through). I tried to get the door open but he kept coming back, so I powered the door to 1/3 of the way, having the light come on. I expected him to leave, but he stayed there, by that time, the other door was too far for me to get to and open before the timer ran out.
---
Make Dwight Shirtless Again
---
Exactly the timer makes it even worse. You literally can’t escape as lone survivor anymore unless the killer is super stupid
---
I could not, he closed it first. And even if you click jump first your jump will be interrupted if killer will start to close the hatch.
---
I died a little when I saw that in his video.
---
Its supposed to be whoever performs the action first. You'd be forced to with a key. Though with how bad dedicated servers have been, u wouldn't doubt that it's been working incorrectly
---
&gt; He’s not annoying as hell to play against
---
You haven't met a good Legion then.
---
I honestly think it's okay, and I'm pretty notoriously survivor biased. It's a shame that it's essentially killed any post-gen rescue plays, but overall I think it's more healthy for the game than the previous "end game" iteration.
---
Me too. I joined a KYF to begin with to learn some of the basics, and finished the tutorials some weeks later.
---
Oh i and i had SOOO many D/Cs i couldn't even load into a game, for some reason it just ended the game quickly and said "A Player failed to Load in" im just sticking to killer.
---
Sometimes I play killer and I’m bringing an obsession to a hook and I just think “damn, I am SO glad I don’t have to deal with that ds bullshit anymore” lol
---
It's less common in my experience but it does happen.
---
It might be better to give the feedback directly to the devs on the official forums. They probably don't ready everything here, especially on a weekend.
---
I feel like no one reads the lore so my reasoning for the last question may not make much sense.
---
Pretty sure survival is always my objective as "survivor"
---
Bet you didn't see that one coming
---
His content isn’t really for me, fine if you enjoy him, I just can’t enjoy the stuff he puts out. Most to all of his YouTube videos are just cut from his streams with little to no editing, whereas someone like Bricky makes his videos with the same gameplay, but the gameplay isn’t the focus, it’s him. He talks about a multitude of things and the gameplay is just there for background stuff. But like I said, it is completely fine if you enjoy what he does, just not for me.
---
If you can add us we'd accept. Also that was funny i was dying lMFAO 
---
WE BOTH LOVE U GUYS U GUYS MADE MY DAY AND I WAS JUST AS URVIVOR

---
I’m on the same boat. Last four games:
---
1: Against Huntress. Looped her a good 3 gens and she facecamped me. Team overly altruistic even though I warned them with arm waving and got killed.
---
2. Myers - Let us win and farmed even though I wanted an actual game
---
3. Against clown that facecamped my entire overly altruistic team. Gates spawned right next to each other along with the hatch and he camped the hatch and gates...
---
4 - another huntress. I got stuck on clown’s map on a tree and couldn’t move...
---
This game is shit but still fun. I don’t know why I play it.
---
Push-ups, Sit-ups, and plenty of Juice. On top of being the badass he already is.
---
I have heard from sources those may be changed so you don't have to hit twice to activate.
---
WTF I just clicked, uninstall.
---
For me, I'd say it's a mix of Spirit, Nurse, Hillbilly, and Legion. I am not good with things that come rushing at me, especially out of nowhere.
---
Honorable Mention goes to the Clown; everything about the guy make me viscerally uneasy.
---
The clown. I have a genuine fear of clowns and he is also made to look creepy. Dude almost reminds me of other freak show cast like the crab man who was also a psychopath who(if i remember right) strangled his wife or daughter for disobeying him.
---
"wonder what that means" wonder what that means
---
Tbh, as a survivor, I haven't seen survivors DC purposely as often, aside from the salty ones who DC immediately when they get downed at the start of the match. BUT, I've seen a LOT and I've personally experienced a LOT of the game itself DC'ing survivors. For the past 2 months, the game kicks me out of 3/4 games and tells me the killer DC'd. I only realized this was a game problem when I duo-queued and I got kicked out of the game while my friend remained.
---
The trick I learned is that if you hear the DC noise, that means the survivor purposefully DC'd. If the DC icon suddenly appears with no DC noise beforehand, it means they were forcibly kicked from the game. If you're a survivor and you get the "killer DC'd" end screen a lot, it means that the game is likely kicking you for whatever reason.
---
I am also very certain that this is a game problem since this problem has been widespread across the DBD forum. Even for me personally, I used to play games normally perfectly fine until some of the latest updates. I haven't changed my wifi and I play several intensive multiplayer games just fine with little to no connection or ping issues. I'm only having this "killer DC'd" endscreen problem with DBD alone.
---
You play on pc? Cause I can tell you right now it’s a shit fest over on console right now. Everything op said in his post holds true to all my matches (I play on ps4).
---
I had something like this happen once. Turned out that me and the guy who was talking shit were the last two survivors and he got hooked right as the doors opened. 
---
If only I could have given him the double-bird while I moon-walked out of the exit.
---
Sure 1 sec lemme just copy it again.
---
Just permaban em.
---
That's awesome! And there's typically little to no hiccups as far as lag goes so I think you'll be set.
---
The problem is that there is such a vast difference between SWF and solo queue survivors. As a killer, I can tell when I am facing off against solo players or SWF. I can stomp any solo survivors at red ranks with Freddy, but am more than likely going to get stomped by a stacked veteran SWF team. This leads to everyone playing Billy or Nurse, because those two are viable against SWF teams, but completely shit stomp any solo survivors.
---
I am not sure how they could possibly bridge between solo and SWF tbh aside from just making VoIP standard in DBD.
---
ya really just change the color of aura and scratch marks to blue or something. it would not give any advantage at all. I honestly am not color blind but its hard as fuck to see my totem sometimes lol
---
I just tested it. It was 6.13mg per 11 minutes, totaling roughly 36.78mb per hour. This game is amazingly optimized in the networking aspect! I just tested it.

I thought Killers get quitter bonus points now if people DC.
---
But is it her Greatest Of All Time? I'm partial to the one that gives her gross disgusting rabbit feet and worms but this one is nice too... 
---
She certainly isn't a character that needs central vision OR depth perception. /s
---
if it's intentional obviously why not a couple hour temp ban
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I feel like the devs should have a survey on why people are doing it. since it has been a increase of it lately there must be a reason why it is happening and I think the devs should try to figure it out instead of just bringing out punishment because then ppl would just find another game

Generally it's a matter of searching the lower view count streamers. Sometimes you find hidden gems.

Hope is better if the killer has NOED, because NOED renders the heal state useless.  But adrenaline is the best overall survivor perk in the game at the moment.
---
10/10 great work
---
Have you seen the movie? It's literally three brothers and their Grandpa. Not really anyone to be incestuous with...
---
I love this
---
Freddy tbh simply because it's so hard to know exactly where he when you're anywhere within terror radius and I have this thing where I gotta know here the killer is or it'll really annoy me and idk why lol. Spine chill doesn't even help out a whole lot with him either.
---
You gotta look closely to see who we were trapping I don't blame ya
---
Definitely ^(not worth the downvotes but ill do it anyways )
---
LOBBY TIMES?
---
I play on Xbox and ever since the last update last week I've got teammates (not swf just other players in match) who frequently dc's when I play survivor and survivors who dc when I catch them as killer.
---
The only thing I can do is use their weak in game reporting system which I believe does nothing on console.
---
It's as if the Developers don't care for the problem if I'm being honest. They've never really properly addressed it at all. They mention it but there's no commitment to get rid of the issue.
---
Another, poor, broken pig main
---
I'm pressing F so hard rn
---
I’m an entitled survivor main, and you need to obey out made-up rules, otherwise I’ll call you a sweat. 
---
*t-bags furiously*
---
Am atheist, can confirm
---
I just wanted my 60k ritual
---
Neither should have an easy time though. What was fairly survivor centric has now become WAY killer centric.
---
It's still a massive problem
---
I'm a Freddy main and agree with everything except for the pallet stuns. Those need to be possible so you can still get saves against him, since flashlight saves against Freddy are practically impossible
---
who the hell actually disconnects if it's a mori fucking grow a pair
---
Mobile? he's commenting on the typos
---
I guess it would make sense as to why Bubba dresses like a woman sometimes. Maybe he's the one getting passed around. O.O
---
Yeah I honestly didn't even see Ms.Piggy there until you said you trapped the killer.
---
As it should. The killer is meant to have an advantage. It should be difficult for the survivor to come out of a situation in which they failed to properly complete the objective.
---
Also! There’s a bug that seems pretty common where one gen will literally be unrepairable. Like, you’ll do the whole animation and everything but no progress will be made on it. It also happens with survivors in which I can’t heal someone or vice versa, and I can’t wake people up. Honestly ridiculous, this shit has cost me a few matches.
---
You should tell what rank are you. Red ranks and ranks 15-20 have a very long await time on all platforms.
---
I would want this more than shirtless Myers
---
I mean my goal is to P3 every Survivor and Killer soooo....
---
As a killer main, I tip my hat off to you for being on the other side and getting it. Cheers.
---
i wish tere was a way to edit the title
---
Wow people really suck. I hate when people farm me so when ever I’m killer I usually always spare someone who gets farmed. I’m a pretty merciful killer like if a survivor is on my shoulder and I feel like I’ve been rough to them to the point where they don’t try to wiggle out I almost always just drop them on the floor. People love to complain honestly.
---
Salty killer t-bag gameplays incoming xD
---
I agree with you OP a timeout system would work the best. It would allow the devs to punish frequent DCers without doing harm to the game's player population.
---
As for those who claim the devs should change the game to address the DCs, well they already have in a lot of cases. Let's list them all shall we:
---
* 3-man matches now auto-cancel with players keeping their offerings.
---
* The game is getting optimized. Finally.
---
* Endgame and the basement collision change has ended all hostage situations and teabag parties.
---
* DS was nerfed and reworked into an anti-tunnel perk.
---
* BT was buffed.
---
* Legion was ~~gutted~~ reworked.
---
* Toxic Killers can no longer slap a hooked survivor.
---
They can't continue to buff unhooks to counter toxic face campers without hurting all killer players. The only major source of DCs left untouched is the SWF-solo gap and the frustration it causes for killers/solos. That and Nurse. Now I'll admit the devs have been refusing to close the SWF-solo gap but they have announced a rework/nerf for Nurse's, and Billy's too, add-ons.
---
It was sad  seeing her hide in her corner :(
---
Were gates open? you don't get points for it once the gates are open
---
We had this exact post with this exact joke here like a few dozen times already
---
"95% of the killer playerbase" but most killer I versus aren't nurse or billy and don't use OP addons
---
Except 90% of all games are out of a survivors hands. Their friends ragequit? They die. Randoms leave them on a hook? They die.
---
And while I agree killers should have the advantage in a 1v1, it shouldn't be so 1 sided that you may as well put your controller down and STILL win if you killed 3 people
---
200 iq play
---
moonwalk as prayer bead spirit towards survivors
---
that way you wont set off spine chill
---
* Screenshot highlighting that everyone disconnected.
---
It isn't like that though.
---
I wish I coulda done that to him but he left straight after that chat went down. Woulda been satisfying af
---
And how often do you escape? How often do they get kills, ect?
---
What would you expect to happen, you get off then the killer beats you down again immediately and puts you back up.
---
One of the half just happened to be the lit one. Of the Two, it killed NOED but left The Third Seal
---
The issue for me is that NOED triggers then. So I'm opening a door and have it almost open when the killer walks up, my only chance is to bait a hit and then tap it and sprint out. Then BAM! hit with the NOED. I don't have an issue with NOED under normal circumstances but I think it should be changed to activate when the last gen is finished rather than when doors are powered
---
SHORTY FOR NEXT SURVIVOR!!
---
This. What I really want is for Deliverance to on second phase too.
---
Except it is. If the Hatch doesn't spawn right by the 4th guy, then the killer basically wins.
---
The main advantage a survivor can have at this stage, is RNG making both gates super far away, and THEN they have to pray they get the gate open in time.
---
Forget EVERYTHING though if you're caught at/near the Hatch when it's closed. Now, unless you have a key, you are 100% dead and cannot do a single thing about it
---
&gt;The amount of people who dc on first down is ridiculous
---
from my experience this is definitely the most common dc I see, which is especially frustrating as a killer running bbq
---
I really want James as a survivor
---
against huntress yeah, otherwise no. I cannot tell you how many times adrenaline has saved my ass. Earlier today I got stuck looping the truck in the gas station while my buddy did the last gen. Adrenaline let me take a hit for the speed boost, get out the door and get healed with another speed boost. this let me loop the killer until a door was open and use the last hit to propel me out the gates. Hope would have killed me
---
Adrenaline is nearly always a free heal for me at the end of the game, because good survivors won't heal if there's only one gen left most of the time. The only thing that's really situational is it saving your life (as in the killer is chasing you when it activates). Either way youll almost always get a free heal from it if you're injured. There are situations where the heal might be pointless, like if you're going against the plague, but it's the best survivor perk in general because it's good with every perk combination, except for no mither.
---
I never use hope because its way too situational. The speed boost it gives will only be a game changer in very few situations. I feel like its more of a placebo effect than anything since you won't know when it's had a significant impact
---
I second this.
---
I think the perk that causes survivors to become expose after dropping a pallet should be changed to triggering if they hit you with the pallet. And then the perk can be called Vengeful.
---
I realized that after I turned my menu music up... thanks lmao.
---
Updooted for production value and funky ass bass line.
---
I’m so proud of this community
---
well I imagine they will stop at a certain chapter probably like 25 maybe 30
---
Eugh. Johnny Rapid?
---
I'd go for Pietro Duarte.
---
I eat plank
---
why is Frank so tiny lmaoo
---
before the most recent patch legion was a weak killer that was extremely unfun to play against because he had some bad exloits. because he sucked the only people who played him used the exploits and played like dicks. Survivors started d/c'ing because it wasn't worth playing the match out. The latest patch fixed his exploits and I find him fun to play against now but some people are idiots and don't read patch notes.
---
IMO I don’t like the new legion.
---
As killer OP would get an advantage, but he's playing survivor.
---
Not if you have DS+mettle of man lol
---
I don't camp I still get survivors spinning and flicking flashlights at the end
---
 Only ever been scared facing Michael after getting experienced.
---
It's stupid that hex totems don't work if they get cleansed in the first 30 seconds of the match
---
It's stupid that adrenaline doesn't work if you die before the last generator is finished
---
It's stupid that Unbreakable doesn't work if the killer never slugs me
---
It's stupid Bloodwarden doesn't work if I don't get a hook after the gates are open
---
Turns out, a ton of perks in this game have conditional use and by choosing you run them, you accept the possibility that they may provide zero benefit in any given game.
---
Want to actually use your Deliverance? Try getting killer aggro before the other 3 survivors are dead. The Insta-kill last survivor on hook has been  around for ages and shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. It exists to shorten up an otherwise pointless time that survivors have abused in the past to spite a killer that hooked them.
---
They should make voice native a native feature and buff all killers besides nurse and billy.
---
Tbag more
---
[Or you could just play who you find fun and say fuck the ranks.] (https://media1.giphy.com/media/d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY/giphy.gif?cid=790b76115cd7ae244a76335451962877&amp;rid=giphy.gif)
---
Seriously, this is why I'm becoming more cool even at high ranks when games against a Nurse or Legion or sometimes even Billy go poorly. I realized I just don't like playing against them and I don't care if things wind up going south. It's mostly just a bunch of the same old cheese anyway.
---
Of course it will. But not very soon, maybe 4-5 years from now, if player base is still active.
---
Considering how shes next to that tree, I would bet $100 she was stuck. I've gotten stuck there before too as killer and the only thing that freed me was a survivor letting me down them and pick them up.
---
I got stuck as survivor too and wasnt found until three crows were having a party on my head lol
---
Gotta wait for 30 seconds, timer goes at half speed with someone on hook.
---
Part of the journey is the end.
---
We don’t know yet
---
Yup you're totally right. I didn't understand. Thank you for enlightening me. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
---
I mean if I didn't ignore that fact then things might be my fault, and that's just not a risk I'm willing to take
---
No offence but no. You get hooked last with everyone dead you die. You shouldnt be able to cheese to victory and waste time after the killer has won
---
Yeah same
---
They need to start to address why people are disconnnecting. Theyve already stopped it deranking you to stop that group. Youll never stop people ragequiitting though
---
Yeah...its a good thing
---
I stood at the bottom of basement stairs, in plain view, while a survivor was hooked down there. A survivor saw me, stopped for a second, and then went for the unhook anyway. Obviously, I revved the chainsaw and downed them both.
---
Wierd thing is, this happened 3 or 4 times today. Can someone please explain?
---
I mean freddy got nerfed for a reason a lot of people found him annoying
---
I watched the whole thing getting more and more excited because I honestly thought it was going to fall. Now I'm just sad :(
---
* **Rule 6** - Support Post 
---
* Looking for group posts - Use /r/dbdLFG.
---
Dunno man, I'm a Freddy main and have the same issue. I think it's just that they get pissy about getting downed by a  "underpowered pepperoni-faced fuckstick" so they d/c.
---
Yea I havent played in a minite since I dont wanna pay for psplus, but good to hear that there is a punishment
---
They should make the entity's claw/hand thing come up from the ground like EGC and snatch the d/cing player so it counts as a sacrifice and killer still gets points. Still sucks for the remaining survivors but at least the killer isn't getting shafted. I'd also give them a time penalty, adding more every time they d/c.
---
Yeah, as a killer main I am horribly reminded how stressful and intimidating some of the killers are when playing survivor
---
ya it is a amazing change to the game
---
I only die when I'm not toxic and don't tryhard
---
We leave that for the inevitable Spider like killer
---
I feel so sorry for Clown in this photo :(
---
Well, I don't DC a lot, maybe once in 50-70 games, but it's because killer teleports all over the place and downs you easily without counter play, even tho it was 150-200 ping game. 
---
One time I had to DC because I was stuck in madness 3 and couldn't get out of it, which was very infuriating, as I was already had shity day, and on better day I would have played it out and got chased by doctor.
---
Plus we see all kinds of bugs in this reddit, like big heads, characters spawn as distorted mess etc. If it wasn't this buggy you could blame people for being salty, but I wouldn't be surprised if 30-40% of dcs is just people leaving because the game bugged out.
---
i wish i got cool killers like this
---
Yep as a leatherface main (soon to be ghost face main) survivors think that oh he totally won't rev his fucking chainsaw idk some survivors are just carefree? Also bad leatherface no camping in basement bad boi
---
Honestly, unless you plan to be wasted in an hour you should make it so you drink when the killer doesn't have ruin. it's a bit more rare but still happens
---
I love it when they wish death and rape upon me and my family😍
---
Nice plays, but the video looked blurry
---
Add a new reporting category solely for disconnects during play. Separate from unsportsmanlike. When a player gets more then 3 a day they are banned for 24 hours and have that stack for each time they are banned. 
---
Warn them on their first time so they know and that’s that.
---
If you get into a chase when you are the last person left and you didn't find the hatch beforehand, you should die. You failed your objective, and you didn't find the hatch before killer. The hatch shouldn't be a free escape. Either you find it first or open the gates after it's closed. If the killer finds you before either, they deserve to kill you.
---
Only the dull totems and the haunted grounds went :/
---
It could be simply players coming back because of the updates and new killers. Regardless, there are ways to voice concerns over a game and constantly disconnecting isn’t one of them.
---
I made his actual model a bit smaller to help perspective and to help match the original scene.
---
The word you were looking for is terrifying
---
I’m rank 8 playing with sixes and threes ... when there aren’t enough players it matches the best way it can.
---
Okay I will try to improve that
---
Some people enjoy winning, or doing much better than survivors or whatever you want to call that metric. There are only a few killers capable of that given good survivor play, that's all
---
0 terror radius is different than stealth. If you're not going to be in a chase then he has a terror radius, if he is in a chase then just loop like normal.
---
He could also have his aura reading removed in the rework.
---
So this was the Freddy buff they had in mind.
---
[removed]
---
Easy solution is add a debuff for repair speed for every swf.
---
I think we’re almost definitely gonna get H18 cosmetics for Laurie and Michael tbh
---
We're running out of horror titans, but the time is right for this one. I've got a good feeling about IT joining us before the end of this year.
---
Its probably the game wanting you to see how it feels to play killer and appreciate all the hard work they need to do during a game.
---
Pennywise
---
Ability: Ineffective jump scare. 
---
Flail in front of survivors in fast motion while they ignore you and think about better killers.
---
Wow ruining people's fun makes people not want to play? Wild.
---
The system of rituals works like that, if you are playing mainly survivor you will get more killer rituals, and if you are playing mainly killer you will get more survivor rituals, game wants more people to play both sides regularly
---
Translation: "It's unfair that I get to lose 3 times. I should get to lose as many times as possible until I escape."
---
What about map RNG when the killer has to deal with jungle gym + killer shack + stonecircle/ironworks/red forest house all next to each other? Blame map RNG on the devs, because killers and survivors both get screwed by it.
---
I don't even need mobility, I have Whispers, you gonna bitch at the devs to nerf that perk into oblivion now too? Holy shit the entitlement.
---
I will be happy if he has the classic version (from the mini-series) as cosmetics
---
Haha new players are so cute
---
And 70% of people on this sub need to stop making up exaggerated stats to prove a point
---
Whenever I play survivor more I get killer dailies 99% of the time and vice-versa, I think it's just an incentive for people to play as the other side
---
Right? Just 99 it and use it for insurance. Jakes are always willy nilly with sabotaging hooks and then leave you to deal w it
---
This is one of my favorite things tbh. Thats why i avoid lockers like ... well, like the plague ... when playing survivor with Huntress
---
Still would bug the fuck out of me.
---
It is fine. There is plenty of time to open a gate. The hatch was a free escape. It still usually is. In most games where it comes into play, the last survivor is camping it anyway. No chance for a killer to close it. Only had 2 games so far where I closed the hatch as killer. Only one of those resulted in a kill. 
---
2 minutes is plenty to leave. It also slows down to half is someone is knocked down or on a hook. Had a team reside someone and escape at half the timer.
---
it goes both side, getting t-bagged at gates was funny once or twice but after that it was annoying. Nothing you can realy do this community is toxic af, just bear with it.
---
Who knows, it may depend on the nature of the license, since each killer might have different conditions in their licenses.
---
I agree if they made it that wound timer won't go down in Tr, then make his tr smaller, the way it was before 24m, jeez pair it with M&amp;A and 16m radius he can actually be used in some sort of strat ffs
---
Youtubers and streamers use cold dirt and ultra rare addons against idiots and get 4ks and say " LEGION IS SO MUCH BETTER NOW"
---
Legion is worse than Bubba atleast Bubba has a one hit down in his base kit ffs
---
But alas nothing will change as even after contacting them on their website and giving them suggestions in the ptb, they didn't listen to me and my mates about making his tr smaller and they went on with it.
---
So here I am, simply asking people about their experiences, and then there's you

I understand as a Killer player you may be ecstatic loading into less players but playing into that as a high ranked Killer and as a Survivor at any rank into this is severely deplorable. One of the best changes ever. Now all we need is bans for DC's in game.
---
You are, play someone else
---
Wasnt dr like the first killer to get massive dcs?
---
my profile is https://steamcommunity.com/id/SombraMain/ and his is https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198360149175/
---
Thx for the info
---
It’s like Russian roulette. Never hide in a locker against a huntress.
---
Not true. Sometimes you get bad RNG for gate positions next to the hatch, but most times it is separated out enough to escape. When you don’t, at least you had a chance to. The objectives did not get done. You should be dead. You had a slim chance to escape, not a guarantee. That is what it should be.
---
I was specifically talking about 1v1 scenarios, I think end game as a whole is fine
---
It's what he deserves
---
That is the best thing I’ve ever seen.
---
No. They tried that in the PTB. Was way too survivor sided and they only cut 5 seconds off.
---
im rank 14 and the wait times are really long. Is something happening?
---
The only time I've been a sweaty killer was when I went against an obvious swf  which I thought was a 4 man but they just left the solo survivor to die on his first hook, didn't even try to go get him! but when it was one of them they'd run at the speed of light to try to flashlight/body block or swarm to insta save being all aggressive. I made it my purpose to avenge him and kill them all, I got my first hatch grab then too! the survivor sent me a message thanking me, solo sucks.
---
That’s weak
---
Jonny Blaze Ghost ruder hmmmm?????
---
dude, im wondering the same thing! I cant find a lobby playing as survivor and im on ps4 too. I bought ash and cant even use him! I usually play killer but sometimes i like changing. When i play killer my lobbys fill really fast but for surv its an eternal wait. wtf is happening
---
Tbh, I don't get the hype.
---
Just because the holders of pig's license allowed her to have cosmetics doesn't mean that those of Myers will do the same.
---
It's like saying that we'll definitely get x licensed killer just because we have other licensed killers.
---
Yeah great if this was allowed
---
Killer stands by hook, survivor sits there until the very last second and then deliverance off, killer chases survivor and downs them. Killer then leaves the survivor on the floor for about 2 minutes to ensure no DS. Killer then hooks survivor who struggles for the full hook state.
---
Sounds like a party
---
FUCK MICHAEL MYERS, PAY TO WIN BITCH NO SKILL. OH MOMMY AND DADDY GAVE ME MONEY TO BUY MM AND OH HE SO GOOD, HE JUST STALKS PEOPLE AND GETS 1 HIT KILL. FUCK OUTTA HERE. AT LEAST BILLY HAS TO USE HIS CHAINSAW TO 1 HIT KILL SOMEONE BUT NO MICHAEL HERE LIKES TO LOOK AT YOU AND GET A FREE ONE HIT KILL. OH AND IF HE HAS AN ULTRA RARE PERK, HE CAN KILL YOU TOO....MM SHOULD BE CALLED 1 HIT KILL BITCH
---
1 v 1 should be very difficult to escape. You are against an opponent made to take on 4.
---
thank you. I love her too.
---
There is definitly more recently, but I cant complain it doesnt feel like too many and recent patches have felt like way to few
---
Spirit yes hag depends on the map the game sure good chance for a 4k red forest gg and true not every game has to be a 4k but i did depip with a 3k today. So it depends what u consider to be a win and people play billy and nurse for map pressure no other killer comes close
---
Well, having downed teammates slows it down, otherwise Blood Warden becomes an even better endgame perk!
---
My favorite will always be the kitty mask, it's super clean and cute hehe
---
Dedicated servers will not help with getting more killers to play. Fixing the balance so playing killer is more fun will.
---
"Is it too much to ask for both?"
---
Sounds like both sides were bad in this scenario.  Killer for the baby camps and survivor for the boosted ape saves.
---
You husband now!
---
Taco Man is the next survivor and Bunny Bunny is the next killer confirmed
---
She *was* an exploited proletarian in her backstory
---
not really, I'm laughing my ass off when I see it happen
---
Weird cause their lore says otherwise.
---
Maybe Frank is 20 when he corrupted the other 3, cause he was 19 in college when he had the incident but the other were teenagers.
---
And all it took was activating cloak mode.
---
That's how it is, as killer you find a lobby INSTANTLY i think it's cause no one's likes killer and don't play alot of killer. Survivor always takes a while
---
I'm a killer main, I know dude. I myself told many people that complained about it that "killers waited 3 years for that" and shit but let's be real, they recently changed it so they might adjust it. it's kinda a jerk thing to do.
---
I agree with the timeouts as well. Maybe add something on top of that but at the very least sort of exponentially increasing timeouts.
---
A few points though:
---
&gt; 3-man matches now auto-cancel with players keeping their offerings.
---
I main killer and it still always eats my offerings and add ons if even a single player DCs.
---
&gt; Toxic Killers can no longer slap a hooked survivor. 
---
Since when? I haven't tried it, but a Wraith took a little time out to give me some "compliments" regarding my looping just a couple days ago while I was on hook (not calling him toxic, just saying it looks like it still works).
---
&gt; Lockers now counter all aura perks, including BBQ &amp; Chili. 
---
Hey! Don't forget our sweet baby boy Iron Maiden! lol
---
&gt; Hex totem spawns are much better than they used to be. 
---
That's the most terrifying thing I've ever read on this forum. I'm glad I wasn't around for that! Currently it either spawns at the killer or survivor spawn point about 100% of the time. I assume previously it just spawned in broken? lmao
---
I dare you to diagaree with him. He is a scumbag that tries to humiliate people in his chat while smiling creepily.
---
No thanks unless it's Tim Curry
---
Classic dbd.
---
Grabs are dumb
---
Well yeah, you *can* still have something like that. Especially to report people for DCs that *look* like they're intentional. The server can only tell *if* someone DC'd, but not why. If someone DCs while doing gen or just walking or looting a chest, probably not intentional. If they just found out who the killer was, or they just got caught or the hatch closed or something, that looks pretty intentional. So you could have a report for (what appear to be) intentional DCs. I was just saying you don't need it for detecting DCs in general once the dedicated servers arrive.
---
I believe they upped the amount they of pallets a few patches ago,
---
Well we haven’t gotten a Xenomorph yet
---
What is the point of this thread then?
---
Hes underrated as fuck, people just write him off because 'hurr durr 7 seconds fedora man bad'
---
I wasn’t either ... the technical stuff is there deal. I’m just talking about the reporting part.
---
Grabs are broken.
---
Decisive strike lookin OP these days
---
I wish I could be in this situation (as killer not the poor survivor)
---
Self Care works pretty well with Ash because you can self heal to 99% once your MoM is activated so you don’t show your auto to the Killer. Next time the Killer sees you tap the heal button and you’ll be at 100%
---
Oh I'm sorry let me repeat myself, AGAIN.
---
"At the end of the day this was a post was just me ranting about a mechanic in the game. I wasn't asking why you think I deserved to die."
---
Why did you have to post it on reddit then?
---
Shouldn’t a 1v1 scenario be Killer sided? After all, the Killer is supposed to have the power to take out four Survivors, not just one.
---
I don't tbag but I kill survivors anyway
---
This is human nature in a shellnut tbh.
---
nea = upvote
---
i actually tried playing him earlier, i dont understand his ability and trying to read it made no sense to me, all it appears to do in game is give you 'spook-o-vision' and the slow walk of doom
---
Receipts? Not saying it isn’t true, but I don’t watch his live streams I just watch the YouTube videos.
---
It’s making up for the Jake mains who throw down pallets without looping and then DC when they get downed
---
Not under this change this guy wants
---
BUT they’re ostensibly reworking Freddy in the near future, and if they actually aren’t lying for once, they plan on doing a complete mechanical overhaul rather than their usual “rework” tactic of just straight buffing or nerfing a killer’s existing kit.  So we have no idea if this will synergize with how new Freddy works or how long this perk and current Freddy will exist together.
---
As long as the game is profitable for the devs (and it’s been more profitable than ever since the addition of the cosmetic store), they’ll continue releasing new content.
---
Yeah I’m not excited for illfonic after Friday but I’m giving it hope because if done well it could be a pretty awesome game going through a jungle while being stalked by a predator with friends honestly sounds pretty scarily fun.
---
The fuk u say about Chucky bish?!?

Still kinda mind boggling but yeah I guess the entity could force his ability to something less crazy?
---
You know what they say, Doctor Main Big Brain
---
Reminds me of when I was playing Hillbilly and used my chainsaw to sprint through the cornfield. I mowed a poor Bill down. We had a good laugh at both our shocks in the post game chat
---
No matter if it is tagged salt/rant, there should still be discussion.
---
I love Scott (that's his channel) easily the best killer ever
---
I love that idea but i would think that would be time consuming and allow for gens to get done.
---
This... Does bring a smile to my face.
---
&gt;You are acting like people use noed, and there are no pallets
---
There aren't too many by the end lmao.
---
&gt;All you need to do is loop
---
With him having a speedboost... Sure thing. It's stupidly easy for the killer by then.
---
&gt;Also survivor perks could counter noed, like borrowed time or an exhaustion to extend the loop.
---
Implying we used no adrenaline for exhaustion and if the killer expects it, still useless. Borrowed only works if you don't get hit while rescuing (good luck with that) and all it does is give extra hooks.
---
it is kind of like the 4% chance of attempting an escape of a hook. It has a very slim chance of allowing you to escape if u complete the challenge (skill check or not) but if not, it would act as a normal mori
---
So now he must "sabotage" his teammates defenses.  That is making a ridiculous amount of logical sense to me.  Rip Sabotage.  You were fun while you lasted.
---
At this point, that's honestly really silly.
---
Not really
---
That’s fine, bloodlust, Dead Hard, 2 year old bugs and more bug me and they’re still in the game.
---
Nurse is just literally overpowered, not broken. she needs a huge nerf machine. you can't cheese out the chase with her like you could with old Legion. that was broken. not overpowered.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Huntress isn't broken or overpowered at all, hitboxes are weird with all killers - don't join games with bad ping.
---
Spirit is perfectly balanced killer. Beads have two perk counters + your ears and attention(cause you can hear her footsteps when she phases even with Beads. when it's grassy map - you see grass move, when concrete - footsteps much easier to distinguish).
---
 Bro we already have a clown. What would be his name?
---
It’s best on Myers, Pig and Billy
---
See, it’s based off of the survivors mistakes not what the killer does. This implies they haven’t done the totems, aren’t smart enough to conserver their pallets, and stupid enough to not recover their exhaustion if not in a chase. If they are in a chase, they get a speed boost and health state healed.
---
All good survivor perks can not be countered actively by the killer, but instead by guessing and countering meta perks with other meta perks
---
A majority of good killer perks are hex, or can be actively countered.
---
Example: a killer can’t stop adrenaline from going off, but a survivor can stop noed from going off
---
Only perks people can actively counter are actual exhaustion perks, but they don’t know they can counter them until the survivor uses it,  but for ruin you can spawn next to the totem
---
thanks, i want Cornetto now =/
---
It’s a risky unintelligent play. You could go to a gate and not find anyone, and by that time the other gate could open with the survivor unhooked and home free, and vice versa. Or you can wait by the hooked survivor, where the other survivors will come to *you*. Worst case scenario you only get one kill. Best case scenario, you chain 2 or 3 additional kills. Simple strategy at that point.
---
Pallet camper survivors.  5 pallets in 30 seconds!  Absolutely terrifying, most effective killer in game.
---
I would pay for this
---
He has normal 115 speed
---
she has collision when she phases. her Realm is not the same as Dream World.
---
And then you get rewarded for not doing your job protecting the gens you mean
---
ever heard of ears? you can hear her footsteps.
---
Figures it’s a fucking legion!
---
They're good for Hangovers ;)
---
No, I don’t like private profiles they are shady, I should need to change the way I present myself instead we should work on being less toxic, or at least keep it in the endgame chat not profiles
---
lol. there are two of those uploaded nearly at the same time 
---
[The Other One](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bnmote/exit_gate_tbaggar_gets_rancor/)
---
[The Other One](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bnmlpt/i_thought_the_animation_worked_really_well_it/)
---
I felt bad for Stu, even though he was psycho.
---
Peer pressure, man.
---
This is amazing!!! I love it
---
Both of them were from me, I just finally got around to posting the few cool clips i had and i wanted to put them on reddit too so.
---
Got what he deserved I’d say
---
Considering WoW is still somewhat alive after how hard they've butchered that game, I think DBD will last plenty long. 
---
It's a great game to play with friends and that's what will keep it alive.
---
It's completely normal.  
---
In PvP games, you get to see the more toxic side of people. It has always been like that. No one likes losing, right?
---
To me, death threats aren't, however.
---
Aw man I just shot Marvin in the face
---
Tally up the victims in all our favorite hoodie movies. I’m James A. Janice, and today we’ll be looking at the 2000 Texas Chainsaw Massacre Reboot.
---
I have countless hours in PvP games, but no one outside of CSGO, one of the most toxic games you can play, comments. And the ratio of CSGO to DBD comments is wack. And I have a lot more hours in csgo than I do in DBD.
---
Overall, this community is more toxic because it is more divided. It’s between killer and survivor mains, each incredibly entitled and it feeds into its self.
---
'The other clown', obviously.
---
He can be added for game play like all the licensed killers and their stories are not canonical in DBD so it doesn't really matter.
---
You never mentioned the mechanic once. The first thing you said was I deserved to die because I was in a chase and failed to do objectives. I don't call that discussing the mechanic. 
---
And the mechanic is fine,when it works like it should. But the whole point was that it didn't. Like when a killer goes for a grab,starts the grab animation, and then ends up only hitting the survivor. A buggy mechanic. That is the topic here. Not your arbitrary guidelines of when you think a survivor should live/die.
---
And I find you toxic because of everthing you said prior and the way you completely ignored the topic at hand just to tell me I deserved to die. And then you try to say you were discussing the mechanic when you did nothing of the sort. I also just don't like the mentality of players who seem like they can't have fun or don't enjoy the game unless they escape or they get the 4k.
---
Do you live you life in a constant state of butthurt or did you just lose a game?
---
i feed ass eaters
---
No, I'm just convinced that if you're in the small quantity of killers who don't actually know how to play the game that you shouldnt be playing at all.
---
My teammates get unhooked , fully-healed, ignored by the killer.
---
But as soon as it comes to me. I go into struggle and get farmed. 😫🔫
---
Pinhead
---
You should have repaired generators..
---
I just said stealth because you seemed to have confused stealth with no terror radius in terms of starting and during a chase, he would would still have a red stain to mind game.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
oh, I didn't notice. that makes sense now
---
Without the panties ;D
---
I don't get why you were downvoted so much. You aren't wrong. Must be Trapper mains getting mad or something.
---
Not really, the group I play with is primarily lvl 6s up. We have one guy who gets all the hooks as close as possible to sabotaged and if we get picked up he completes them. Has saved us on numerous occasions.
---
Pretty sure that's your internet not them dc'ing
---
I always thought it was past tenths, huh.
---
I love that he crawled out during the animation and got pulled back lol
---
He makes your game flicker on and off
---
I mean u aren’t wrong in all fairness you can average 2-3 kills even running kinda meh perks on my piggy to farm bloodpoints and still do pretty well.
---
“Know how to play the game” aka “playing the game in a way that doesn’t make me butthurt”
---
It isn’t the killers job to make sure you get an opportunity to escape after fucking up and getting caught. It’s the killers job to get sacrifices.
---
The horned rat....
---
The fact that he can tbag is the selling point for me and for him to become my main
---
Your job is to prevent survivors from escaping
---
You're right but not having the ability to play the game without using the easiest tactic possible, does make you pretty bad though lol. Good day.
---
Imagine a skin for Susie that has a hood with cat ears
---
How do you derank so much? Do you dc every game or you just stay afk? Doesn’t it take a really long time? It would take like 70 games of staying afk
---
I agree, Calarts isn't bad or good for me, it's mediocre. I will look at it, and this piece is very well done.
---
I would think that u/CreamyKiwa has just unlocked the "Cream" ability at 15, explaining his username a lot, 
---
He will respond with something like "Wdym fucking asshat? I can't read properly at 15! Only make idiotic insults with no base at ALL! I like looking a little girls/boys ass and think it looks good, that's why I support this fucking PEDOPHILE with my whole HEART!." 
---
Though he is incapable of making sentences longer than 20 words. I agree with you, this guy is dumb and can't think for himself. That's why he listens and agrees so damned much with a pedophile.
---
Fix your game... devs
---
Because if you are red ranks and the killer hasn't chased hooked enough people for you to have unhooked them you have to stay to pip. If I don't unhook and heal at least 1 person I will not pip. If the killer hasn't chased me then I will depip. No matter how well I play in the other two categories the pipping system makes me stay to unhook that survivor or be chased because the killer did a bad job.
---
It took me a little while to notice Tapp was there.
---
Too real
---
You see as someone who does teabag at pallets occasionally. We do that stuff to get in your head and make sure you keep following us, or give us your undivided attention so our friends can do gens. If you do catch up to us and down us, then face amp us you’re doing EXACTLY what I want. I’m cool with dying if I had your attention for all five gens and everyone but me gets out
---
Yep. Pandering is super nice.
---
no. Regarding every context the game should be balanced
---
We know
---
Ignore the comments or put it to private, many of the playerbase are idiots and will just leave comments no matter what
---
No, the problem is they didn't buff the mid tier and low tier killers, and that's why everyone play Billy.
---
It's 2019 and all but that's Claudette...
---
Take car, go mums, kill Phil
---
SORRY!
---
Pick up Liz, go to the Wiiinchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all this to blow over
---
IT being more of a force than a single creature, I suppose it'd be possible for the Entity to capture a portion of IT's power in a single manifestation, then maybe contain or recreate that manifestation or something?
---
Go easy on me, I haven't actually read the book, I'm reading it now.
---
Daily rituals
---
Is it true that destroyed hooks notify the killer?
---
&gt; Thing is, Freddy doesn't need stealth. He already has some of the best stealth in the entire game towards people outside the dream
---
What? no he dosent if anything it's harder to stealth people as freddy.
---
Or a third option is you get an underflow glitch from the negative value and you get a map wide terror radius.
---
Grad by Daylight
---
Yeah, I had the same thing happened to me yesterday. It was so bizarre.
---
Hook sabo and "mori 1 survivor" dailies are the most annoying ones, hope they remove those.
---
Yep
---
Oh shit I just looked at his profile. That's the dude that helped me with Dark Souls a lot!
---
Y his arm coming outa his ear
---
Freddy's rework is likely coming in June or July/August, so it really doesn't matter.
---
“I only die when I don’t tryhard”
---
**Hmmm** 🤔
---
I was thinking about the nightmare but I forgot about the waste of space and 1 and 0 that is know as Freddy. Maybe The Biggest Fear. Idk
---
Technically the most efficient way to win is to all split up and do different generators as each additional player on a gen has diminishing returns.
---
Also the keywords colored in red were a bit overbearing as they occurred so often that they messed with the flow of reading the document. Just my two cents.
---
Looks like a cake
---
Holy shit
---
That's so cool! Can you make me one! I graduate soon :)
---
Listen all y'all its a sabotaaaaage!!
---
Clem would be a cool ass survivor.
---
 I don't see this with Bubba, but I agree - a Trapper just always *felt* faster than an Evil 2 Myers, non-sawing Billy, Wraith... even if he's supposed to be the same 115% speed. Huntress also feels faster than Hag.
---
This comment.

---
I think it's a suicide joke but I'm not sure
---
I think for me I think the fatter the killer the faster they feel, because it’s more mass covering the same distance.
---
Developers want to support this game for 4-5 years and it still a popular game, so enjoy it.
---
I still don't get people who run to the hook from somewhere else with the killer already on their ass - like, running to someone injured or to a gen that's being worked on if you don't have Bond/Empathy... sucks but sometimes happens. But this... why? What is it ever going to accomplish? (unless being the last 2 people alive...)
---
Guess I'm getting closer to recreating Peter in DbD
---
Not even ‘how to be a good killer’, just ‘how not to completely suck balls’
---
The only way this could be more lit  is if the survivor fell down the shaft and hit the ground with balanced landing
---
BHVR have said they'll support the game for another 4 years.
---
But unless they port it to PS5 and the NeXtBox, it'll likely die (on consoles) around 2021.
---
More like reach maximum immersion and uselessness
---
Why should I get punished if I want to just have fun with my friends? We're decent at best and most of the time we fuck around anyway. I don't think giving a repair speed debuff for swf is a good idea at all.
---
Includes paid promotion
---
I didnt expect this crossover lmao
---
Makes me want Clem as a survivor and Minerva as a killer even more
---
That's kind of pretty.
---
Being the justice bringing Hillbilly is my favourite role to play if I see farming survivors.
---
Game Over
---
When the internet completely gets cut off that happens, I think when the ping spikes incredibly dcs happen like this
---
Well ruin isn't really needed on her, so they are partially right. 
---
You have a ton of map pressure even without it.
---
that‘d honestly be awesome :o
---
I didn't used to like this idea, but it's grown on me.
---
LOVE the mask. The outfit, not so much.
---
Why are these pictures so hilarious
---
But disconnect it is
---
Wraith and Huntress get the best skins
---
Not shown: leatherface with insideous
---
Dmangamr I was talking to OP sorry about that :D
---
They said that to try to surprise us with Clown.. unluckily for me i hate clowns
---
Hitting great skill check at the right moment on the last gen, to save your friend with adrenalin.
---
Wrong. If each Survivor is able to 1v1 the Killer, then the Killer in inherently.
---
In a 1v1, the Survivor is at a disadvantage because they lost their 3 teammates.
---
I am, I don't care that the mask barely changes, I'm addicted to prestiging killers.
---
Dorsn't change anything...
---
Good artwork! I wish had this one

Scott is funny on Mordhau tho

Nobody would use them then though, aside from for style.
---
Lol im used to being on xbox where you get banned for saying curse words.
---
Don't get it under your skin, remember, your mother didn't raise no pussy.
---
they would be almost impossible to escape though but having the chance makes survivor characters seem more logical rsther than doing the same thing over and dying.
---
Find the hatch first, use a key, or (if the doors are far enough apart) you can open a door begore it's checked.
---
Oh and don't forget Wake Up!
---
People DC vs nurse all the time...
---
Not even a little bit man.  It works perfectly against babykillers who tunnel off hook.  I make plays with it all the time post rework.  I never really ran it prior to the rework because it felt cheap and broken but after the rework I bring it everytime now.
---
I'd buy it immediately
---
Your objective is to get on my damn hooks and stay on it until Pappa Entity comes to pick you up.
---
There's that NOED lul.
---
Tbh anything for Daddy Myers
---
Same!
---
I smell BS.
---
What year is this?  No one breaks books anymore and if they do, it's probably for dailies, thus they use a character that doesn't need toolbox to do it.
---
Who the hell are you talking about? You clearly haven't been to a puppers stream before.
---
I feel your pain, I’ve been stuck on rank 8-9 all week because I either get camped or tunneled it’s literally infuriating getting no chance. If I do pip one game I’ll lose it the next and the next, more shit games then good games. I ask myself why do I play this game? Lol
---
All player characters are (or at least were) human. I don't think a creature almost as powerful as the Entity would fit.
---
I spent about an hour going for this clip and was getting Coldwind after 0k after 0k after Coldwind after 0k and it just hurt so I had to commit the cardinal sin of using NOED

Careful with the slurs via PS messages, the PSN mods don't fuck around, they hand out bans like there is no tomorrow.

---
The new system promotes farming tbh
---
High ranks are full of insecure nurse mains with ruin and noed combos. When your team is anything less than competent you will have a bad time. Nobody likes to have a bad time.
---
I think a more accurate comparison for Lullaby would be Surveillance, since you will be using it moatly for tracking
---
😂😂
---
When I’m able to save my teammates at the clutch using Borrowed Time. I’ve angered many a camping Killer.
---
The best scenario for Hope it maybe gives you a couple of extra seconds. The best scenario for Adrenaline it gives you a couple minutes extra. Hope will almost never save you, adrenaline will. The average use case adrenaline will save way more time than hope.

---
Well you said looping and getting off hook fast both not really toxic
---
That was just the beginning
---
Had a game once where i played as Trapper with Monitor and Abuse (Much smaller Terrorradius). We played on the Nurse Asylum-Map and three survivors were dead already. So, I walked around the map and looked for the last survivor and the hatch. I also had whispers, so I found him pretty quick in the distance Teabagging me. I walked towards him and heard the hatch a few meters away, so I turned around and placed some traps after another to get points (Since I knew I couldn't get him). He was Teabagging me for solid 2 Minutes when I thought of a plan to give that shithead what he deserved. I walked out of his view and kept distance so he wouldn't hear my Terrorradius. Walked around the place he was standing and came from the opposite side where he couldn't see me coming, and thanks to Monitor and Abuse he couldn't hear me either. When he realized I was close, he jumped into the hatch but it was too late and I grabbed him, hooked him and nodded at him. Most satisfying moment in DbD.
---
So you play games to tilt others?

I think of it like a KOBE off the hook. There's a chance of escape, but a small chance. Given that the killer has wiped 3 survivors at that point I think it's only fair that odds are slightly in the killers favour. Plus, the EGC is supposed to be thrilling and that's because of the high pressure due to the timer etc. If gates were far apart every time then the EGC would mostly end in the survivor escape which would put us back at hatch stand off (survivor sided). If luck is on your side then the doors will be far apart. RNG makes it fair for everyone as its down to luck.
---
Its pretty simple. In Tier 1 you have no TR and you are slow, in Tier 2 you are a normal killer with half TR and in Tier 3 you are faster, your lunge is larger and you one-shot survivors.
---
In order to Tier up you have to stalk them till the gauge is full.
---
Soooooo they're doing gens while you're in phase 1.
---
And you're not trying to unhook so it lasts longer.
---
Exactly how the game should be played, thanks OP.
---
Immersed survivors are the fucking worst man.  I feel for you.  If you're too scared to repair a gen near a terror radius and you can't handle yourself in a chase either practice or uninstall fellow people of the fog.  Hiding just gets your team killed.
---
Great idea, make it like before when you couldn't possibly derank. Will be a delight to have really bad survivors at rank 1 because its impossible to lose a pip.
---
I've seen back to back and double windows before. My roommate seen it and instantly DCed. I thought pallets had rules now?
---
I also think paragraphs should be formatted to the left and a little bit more separated. Aside from some formatting things this is great, I would love to see this for killers.

A David not running dead hard is like a Meg not running adrenaline.
---
They teabag to tilt me. I tilt them back.
---
Slamming the hatch closed has quickly become the greatest thing I have done in 2k hours in this game. Especially when it's on an immersed Blendette and they now HAVE to come out of hiding. Nice attempt at hiding all game long, nerd.

As a support only player I can confirm this used to happen a lot when I was a lower rank

Now some players understand it’s a team game!

The results I got greatly differ from that tho, so no it is a good perk :)

10 games sound like a nice and rounded up number. Are you sure these 'statistics' are not made up? What is your definition of sucessful ruin game?

Really? I thought it was only the same Leatherface in TCM 1 and 2. Because in 3 he has a whole new family and shit.

ruin  lasting 30+ seconds.

It takes 20 seconds to open the door, thats 1/6th of your time, on the PTB it was 15 seconds.

No.

NOED - no one escapes debt.
---
Hide or Die looks promising.
---
Well the killer can't see hatch its just chance if they find it first
---
Well NOED is an endgame perk so why wouldn't activating endgame start NOED?
---
It isn't hard to open a gate and if you think the killer is looking for hatch to shut it then do gens
---
They just DC because they are cunts
---
I like this.
---
oh wow it does, the gameplay gives me goosebumps! thanks
---
My favorite thing to do as Spirit is waiting at pallets, giving the impression that I'm phasing, then getting them as they slow vault to me
---
Yes!
---
Identity V started off as a Chinese knockoff that eventually 'worked together' with the DbD devs its gotten some cool stuff from what I've see and more content set up for 2019, but a mobile game unless you get an android emulation set up on PC.

Adrenaline exists.
---
Me like you guys :3
---
Were you the hillbilly I went against? Lol
---
Personally I feel like all the perks that affect terror radius are extremely underrated. I always run either Monitor &amp; Abuse or Unnerving (depending on the killer) and the results are great. 
---
Those perks, however, do not require a condition to get triggered, maybe the new one will be less effective. I am definitely rocking it though, at least to try it out.
---
Clearly a latency issue and people wrongfully blaming on hitboxes. 
---
This is why a lot of complaints can't be taken seriously. More often than not, people have no idea what they are talking about.
---
FYI, this will probably continue to happen on dedicated servers.
---
But I'm kinda sure 15% of the Killer playerbase have already watched that (I have)
---
I sometimes don’t even hit survivors and instead scares them with Michael and get called a tunneler

“I’m about to jump down, swear you’ll catch me?”

How much does the Hindered status effect survivors? Is it a noticeable drop in movement speed?
---
I feel like hook sabo are the easiest to complete
---
All exhaustion perks seem to be broken this patch it’s weird I was running sori t burst and lithe ( not at the same time obviously) and after the timer ran out I was still exhausted and it lasted like that till I was either hit or hooked
---
Ya I see it now lol I just woke up so I wasn’t paying attention
---
Ruin gone in first 20 seconds = DC for me, if the games gonna screw me over with bad RNG and give the survivors yet more power then I’m leaving, hello downvote’s.
---
Having a killer-sided endgame in a 1v1 is just more intense and more fun. Can’t believe some survivors really want to go back to the staring contest lol
---
I'm just basing my states off of the average Killer's complaints
---
Neither side should EVER have a 100% guaranteed win

---
*entity displeased
---
So good I had to gild you.
---
Right? It's luck of the draw for me. I know that, at least the smart survivors, are already at one of the exit gates opening it. I have a 50/50 chance of guessing which gate they are at. If I guess wrong they get out, but if I guess right I got them and if they are dumb I just patrol gates til I see them. It's more exciting and even when I play survivor it's made the endgame more intense. Yea I might get stuck if my team all died but hey, the killer outplayed us and the EGC animation is cool as fuck so I don't mind seeing it on either side.
---
It’s always a meg or a Claudette
---
I really hope this post gets traction, because OP gets it.
---
Its not SWF that are DC'ing every game, its solos that are tired of all the bullshit. 
---
Go ahead and ban all the DC'ers. Watch as half the community vanishes and the game dies. You cant force people to play against unfun garbage.
---
I'm gunna be honest...the mask is the only cool thing about this outfit to me
---
Got called a cunt for accidentally taking someone off hook while killer dropped the other survivor and came back. Cunt seems to be the biggest thing they go for
---
Killer should be rewarded for actually doing their objectives, and survivors should be punished for mistakes. It would be like generators taking double the time for each one the team has already done 
---
If a survivor can easily 1v1 the killer then the 1v4 is incredibly unbalanced. Think about it
---
To be honest most if them die out.

is it bad to let the killer hit you out? people take it as tea bagging and being toxic but i want to give the killer hit points

They're rebooting deathgarden completely, that should be interesting.

Really though every asymmetrical besides DBD has been absolute dogshit, I'd like a fantasy themed one tbh, DBD's aesthetic limits what is possible for a power.

Seriously need to add penalties to DCs
---
I always laugh when a killer brings an ebony mori while an event is going on and plays like a bitch all match and yet he STILL didn’t get a single kill with his ebony lmao. They usually end up just dc’ing
---
He was bound to come at some point. BHVR has 5 more years of bringing updates so it wasn't a matter of if he was coming. More of when?
---
Didn't the devs of that game shittalk DBD publicly on their discord? Ngl don't feel like supporting devs who have clear ego-issues.
---
Yes they do. Like I said, as long as they find the Hatch first, they 99.99% of the time will win, easily
---
Chucky could totally work though, on multiple fronts.
---
Base 120% movespeed, can't vault windows (or something like a 5 second vault) is one way to do it.
---
I think the reason we haven't gotten killers like Chucky or Sam is because it would require entirely new animations, not because they're too short.
---
fairy recently, teabagging toxic claudette getting denied hatch as she runs up to it by killer closing it
---
Everybody is calling for it except the serial DCers. Whatcha waiting for, Devs?
---
The contrary can be said for the survivor. If the survivor finds the hatch first, they have a 100% chance of winning. It's all about who finds the hatch first.
---
Listen dude, think of it this way. What's more likely? Every single other human has been sleeping on a perk that even on paper doesn't sound very great OR you're the sole gigabrain CI Hag who is breaking new ground as far as perk combos go?
---
Either they’re not listening or they are just ignoring us
---
Underpowered pepponri faced fuck stick. Best Freddy name

I will take you and raise you. Last night I predicted a survivor would slow vault a pallet and phased right to it.

Jane cat!

Not the artist but thanks for posting credit!!!!! I love that people are doing this now! ^^
---
no one asked to have every survivor able to 1v1 the killer
---
Barely escaping a match after being tunneled the entire game
---
maybe you've been noticing it at endgame because noed makes you faster i believe?  unless it's all game in which case it's probably your imagination or maybe they are all speedhacking, who knows?!
---
That's a pretty good one. Only once ever for me =/

You guys need to understand that with current method that killers are the host there is absolutely nothing they can do. They can't properly know which guy dced, which one lost connection, if it was the host or the client... wait until dedicated servers are here and then they could add stuff to punish or even properly prevent you from losing items to DCs
---
love the hand-print, keep it up!

Only then will they know true pain

Making an omegablink/3-blink Nurse ragequit.
---
i agree
---
Also a more positive one: facing a team of 4 genuinely good survivors who aren't assholes (so don't hump broken tiles) and having a game where everyone gets lots of BP.
---
looks kinda like an Ood from doctor who
---
Considering that they cam see if some players finish the match or if all DC... yeah, they can see who DC'd. 
---
Furthermore, they have access to data which would show them rather clearly who disconnects habitually.
---
Those do not spawn anymore as of 2.0.0 as those characters could be bought with shards from then on.
---
Mori are already time consuming and only skips one hook stage. If you're talking about skillchecks to give survivor BP then fine but making it avoidable or  longer?
---
But unlike Surveillance, Lullaby can actually be used to waste survivor's time.
---
Boy? Now theres a sure sign you're defensive and running out of meaningful contributions (not that you really had much to go on)
---
You absolutely can institute anti-cheat or other policies in game that have a margin of error. There are absolutely no 100% effective systems in place for things like this.
---
They just need to be ready and have a system in place to scoop up the people who fall through the cracks. 
---
Now get outta here.
---
rare to see
---
Because they are inconsequential. Sabo’ing a hook takes 10-12 seconds with a basic toolbox and the hook comes back after a minute or two and the killer will probably not care if it’s a hook in the far corner of the map. Sabotaging has become a full hollow shell of its past self now.
---
Still true!
---
P sure you mean Jane, because I don't think I've ever seen a good Jane I'm my life

1. My bad forgot it was 2019 and we are still doing the PC SJW stuff

---
3. Your problem is you assume too muc...oh I am still forgetting we are in 2019 PC SJW mamby pamby land...1000 apologies...
---
at least subliminally I proved my point and most survivors try to treat killers like shit and think they are not toxic...sorry the truth hurts...oh shit I forgot 2019 and people dont like the truth either...oh well
---
High ranks are full of insecure SWFs with MoM BT Adrenaline Deliverance Insta heal combos. When the killer is anything less than Nurse/Spirit you will have a bad time. Nobody likes to have a bad time.
---
It's rare enough, but it's something I come across at least a few times a week. I play about 5 survivor games, and three killer games a night. 
---
Even if it's rare, it's a very clear advantage with voice chat. They pretty much have a constant view on the killer, and people will do everything in their power to make sure that single survivor lives.
---
Fair enough
---
ive personally never seen it at any killer rak.
---
I don't feel Object is too unfair, because you need to be a good survivor to use it.  
---
A good survivor could use much better perks instead - like Deliverance, DS, Adrenaline, Mettle, an exhaustion perk... but they decide to give you info as to where they are.  
---
Sure, four man SWFs are difficult to go against, but if they're actually all good and trying(incredibly rare), you weren't gonna win anyways.  
---
Unless you're Nurse, but she's bullshit :)
---
Again missing the point entirely no system is 100% but no punishment system should ever reach close to 1% failure. Which is way lower than you would have with implementing such thing in dbd but again you have absolutely no knowledge of how computers work so... I can mess the DC detection pretty regularly if I wish so. Not even using complicated software, just throttling the connection and making it very unstable is enough.
---
They nerfed low tier killers by adding Mettle of Man.
---

---

---
Depends, if you play Leatherface play with your food you're pretty happy that someone has Object of obsession
---
Its pretty bad to play 3 man games as killer as well. You probably won't pip (which I don't really give a fuck) and you will make miserable amount of bp unless you're farming with the survivors which is boring af.
---
I keep clicking both of your comments cycling me back and forth between posts, help I’m stuck in an endless loop.
---
òwó
---
Seriously HELP
---
Right. Yes.
---
And the data that the devs collect on games would eventually show that you, as a killer, if you consistantly did this, would be a problem player and be able to reasonably take action against you.

You've addressed absolutely none of my arguments. Rather you have consistantly set up strawman arguments or engaged with other varied forms of logical fallacy.

However, to prove my point: your posts on this thread have consistantly missed the point and have proven you to be a shitty contributor. I no longer see your posts.
---
the rise and fall of quenty
---
I honestly think its intentional, so many people were deranking on purpose. They left game purely to lose rank. At least now its just the salty people leaving who go down right away.
---
Also people need to stop pretending like the average player cares at all about pipping or what rank they are, all rank ends up meaning is long queue times
---
So it doesn't matter who's host? Ok thanks.
---
Wholesome
---
Maybe consider running overcharge, pop goes the weseal or even corrupt intervention.  
---
Ruin is a risky hex totem you kno the risk once you equip it.
---
But it still causes the One-Hit Down part to be worthless.
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/029/623/cover1.jpg
---
Ruin isnt meant to last forever and tbh i stand by there is nothing else they can do about spawns, there are four survivors and five totems. They are going to spawn near each other sometimes
---
I saw a Meg drop every pallets like yesterday, I was extremely confused not gonna lie, there's more of them ?
---
The perks around the edges of the hat are the icing on the cake!
---
The craziest thing is to see old maps before the pallet and gym changes and it’s like why are there like four pallets in this mini quadrant of the map? Who thought this was okay and the game was okay back then?
---
Ik i fucked up, can u still see the video?
---
:(
---
I feel like everyone is overlooking the fact that a STEALTH killer should not be able to be seen with it. Especially the Wraith? Like, his whole thing relies on him getting the jump on people! 
---
It pretty much makes stealth killers power useless.
---
Hears nurse  
---
Objective: Leave match
---
Imagining the Lean on Mevsong lol
---
Yeah but thats what the perk does, i mean object isnt even the worst. Alert, Dark sense etc all do it as well. None of these perks are OP in any way
---
Can someone please explain the balance of hexes? I cant do it again.
---
The most ridiculous thing is having to exit and reinvite people for swf after every match.
---
Objectively, he is a generic killer now. There's nothing special about him outside of iridescent button which is an ultra rare add on. He didn't just get nerfed, he got dusted.
---
That's what ya get for storing your BP in your toolbox lol
---
With steady hands :p you have to press really lightly on it as you roll it into noodles eheh
---
Nah bruh I'm running right out that door I feel bad for nobody lol
---
The Creeper from Jeepers Creepers as well, though they might not want to do that with the director of that movie. That killer would fit right in though.
---
I disagree as he has the most potential of injuring multiple survivors in a short time among any other killer. You just can't use his ability for tunneling anymore
---
Oh, why thank you! I honestly expected some flack over the perks. But I’m glad to see that people like them. :)
---
If you can't afford to pay a living wage, you can't afford to be in business. Asking people to work below poverty so you can own a business is entitlement at its finest.
---
You are asking human beings to use their lives to subsidize your desire to own a business.
---
If a job is worth being done, it's worth being paid enough to live.
---
They could make him the Pudge/Blitzcrank equivalent where he is based on skillshots by shooting out hooks to catch Survivors and reel them in. His power could even be limited if he has to collect hooks from actual hooks in order to empower his ability.
---
How does the Legion’s power work and how can he kill the survivor like that? I’ve never played one online
---
my point is that they should combine the swf lobby with the solo player lobby so u dont have to swap inbetween.
---
nothing changes with the people u get put into a lobby with.
---
The few times I've played killer I figured they were doing it as a distraction but this post is making me rethink lol
---
Thank you again! \^\^
---
Give it to me now.
---
It's supposed to be balanced when there's 4 survivors. If the killers kills 3 of them, of course it should be killer sided then. The killer deserves that final kill.
---
Yes, we all will some day and so will the game, maybe tomorrow, maybe 5 years from now, maybe today, no one knows. But just know that... Death is not an escape.
---
If the killer killed the other 3, then he deserves the 4k rightfully.
---
I love that the older perks (sprint burst, self care, adrenaline) are back to the original iridescent quality.
---
Urban? You mean the best sneaky evasion perk ever?
---
Really? I run nurse and I’ve never really had anyone DC against me tbh, granted I’m not shit, I can usually get a 2k on a bad game and a 4K on a good one but still
---
&gt;sneaky evasion 
---
You mean the tactic used by 95% of the people who go down in 5 seconds in chases and waste pallets every game?
---
1. Did I just get outed for not having myers 2. How rare is it
---
Wait the Predator is getting its own game? UwU
---
if only we could have Jason :'(
---
I had a perfect game in score as I had 32k bloodpoints, 8k points in each of the scoring categories. The emblems, however, are not tied to the bloodpoint score, especially the Gatekeeper emblem. That's the point I was trying to make; You can max out on bloodpoint score and still not get a double pip because one of the emblems, the Gatekeeper one, is not tied in to any of your bloodpoint scoring categories, and if the gens get done quickly you get hosed out of a Merciless.
---
Survivors can see when a fellow survivor is being killed by the killer yeah? I legit choked the life outta someone as nurse while a survivor watched on, what’s the view of the survivor being choked and the onlooker?
---
Yes .No idea about rarity.
---
I think you’ve just been seeing the wrong use of Urban. You sprint burst/lithe away, break eye sight from the killer, then use urban to get away. If not, looping is always a fair enough option.
---
Wazzzzzzzzuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaappppp
---
But it doesn't really give you that much
---
Hex totems used to be able to spawn right in front of a survivor, and I mean right in front of a survivor. All it took was for a survivor to take one step forward and they got the prompt to cleanse the hex totem. 
---
Their was also a glitch where on all but 2 maps (Lery's and The Game), that if the killer was only using one hex totem it was always guaranteed to spawn in a few specific locations. Spawning wasn't even random. This even applied to NOED too if no dull totems were cleansed before it spawned.
---
Returning player here.
---
What happened to DS?
---
balanced landing, decisive strike and adrenaline are all good perks that would probably fit your playstyle
---
None
---
Yes, you aren't.
---
I'd recommend Adrenaline, Hope, DS and Balanced Landing.
---
Yep. *finger guns*
---
Is it bad that I’m reading this post and the comments whilst being in a church right now?

wow, I'm just seeing them now! Dude, that's amazing!! They're so cute!

I’ve already been there and I know that looping is 100% better but I’ve never really been able to do it super well. I can do it decently but that only goes so far. I know I can’t prove it right now (and generally don’t want to), but I have 1000+ hours and I’m rank 3.  I don’t at all disagree with you. I’ve first hand seen some survivors juke the killer half the game. But I’ve also found good use of urban in and out of chases.
---
Oof
---
I know, I'm seeing more double pallets than I have in a while. It's all Luck based, for the most part only a few spawns are forced per map, but there's only a specific spawn *limit* to how many can spawn otherwise. I'm pretty sure proximity is irrelevant.
---
Notta, for two reasons:
---
Myers has build options with Tombstone and Jumpscare, among a couple others. 
---
Also, we don't know if Ghostface is even going to be good at pulling people off of gens, which is one of the bigger draws of Jumpscare Myers.
---
Lastly, Myers stalks one guy and can kill everyone. Ghostface stalks one guy and then kills that one guy.
---
They're likely to be similar in playstyle, but drastically different in function.
---
Dwight is my favorite! I love how you captured his personality in the pose eheh
---
Think I've seen it posted even more than this. Gives free karma though since it appears on hot every single time.
---
When you destroy all the dull totems and after the exit gates are powered the Killer DCs because NoED didn't trigger. Hngnhnhgnhh!!!..
---
1000+ hours and still thinking Urban is a good perk is... embarrassing to say the least. Just run a good looping build (SC, DH/BL, MoM, Adrenaline) and keep practising. You'll get there eventually, even if you don't think you will.
---
Idk I always like the skins for killers but I don't pay for cosmetics anyway. I enjoy my event skins (specially my Blighted Wraith) even though I can't see it all the time. Sure particles would be nice, specially on doc but I can see it being problematic to console players and to visibility in general.
---
Tell him to teabag when he gets his diploma
---
Get down or I’m telling mom
---
I kinda want this to be how Nurse carries people now, just by default. That's badass.
---
You did the only thing that makes camping decent. You killed yourself, therefore the killer actually saved a huge amount of time by camping you. Just wait on the hook or if your team mates are a waste of time anyway thats up to you but the optimal thing is to just sit there and browse the web or whatever
---
Ahh thanks guys
---
i remembered back when u had to lobby snipe to play with your friends.
---
im pretty sure it could be done and it is really needed, atleast in my opinion.
---
Same for me. It's like I am wearing a neon sign with me.
---
no problem can happen to anyone.

*YOU* JUST DID!

I find that bringing a secret offering can get me genrushed. Not always, but it's been known to happen.

*Crouches as pig*
---
DS because stabbing tunneling cunts with a shard of glass is the most satisfying thing in this game
---
0 hatchets
---
That would negate the point of a hex perk, you have a powerful ability at the risk that it could be taken away if the survivors find the hex totem.
---
Huntress lullaby is actually pretty underrated. It's a hex perk which sucks but if it survives and you get 5 stacks, you can actually make the match for survivors a living hell, especially if you are playing with doctor
---
What a cute baby bell boi!
---
It is not. Before you were able to escape just because your team got destroyed. And you still have chance of escaping now.
---
Flair checks out
---
You don't have to stalk as much and depending on how exactly the crouching, terror radius, and red stain end up on the final version it could be easier to expose survivors as ghost face
---
I've done that before. So satisfying to see their body impaled by the exit gate spikes
---
I don’t use it every game, just for certain killers, sorry but if bad rng ruins the game for me and screws me over I’m out.
---
i've always assumed the entity was female......mostly cuz she gets her hook in you then drains every last ounce of life and hope out of you...
---
So, thats 12 seconds you can be in another match
---
Nothing to add here except yes
---
Hex-Student Loans
---
yea on console when i hear nurse screech  i just smile :)
---
Well, this is an unexpected development... but not unwelcome.
---
Can't be treated poorly post-game if you disable in-game chat.
---
He can only stalk and expose one person at a time
---
It does not do any harm but it wouldn't hurt to implement some small quality of life changes in this game. I would rather miss out on a few chapters here and there just to have them focus on making this game not as clunky
---
Not to self promote, but I actually made a fan made chapter for this a couple months ago. You can find it here

---
I added perks in the description.
---
im gonna lose my shit laughing  if a year from now predator rights end up in a lawsuit lol
---
Get good baby killer
---
Having permanent blindness after being hit once with no way to get rid of it doesn't exactly seem fair...
---
Not to mention the other Hex's. Those perks are Hex totems for a reason, when they work they can be devastating, if they stayed even partially active after being destroyed, the perks would have to be nerfed in some way.
---
What perk pack do you have? Looks awesome      
---
For perks: DS, Balanced Landing (or you can get Lithe/Dead Hard, debatably better options for running killers around), Adrenaline, Hope
---
It's actually the same for me at 15~ ranks, weird
---
My final rating is a broken marriage out of 10.
---
Probably not. Michael is one of the most fun killers in the game. By that I mean he is an extremely balanced killer with probably the best add ons in the game. His add ons don’t just make him better, they drastically chance his play style. With BHVRs track record, I seriously doubt the new killer will come anywhere close to Michaels caliber.
---
From what I've heard:
---
You stalk on an individual basis, so you can only expose one Survivior at a time. 
---
The HUD has a display of how close you are to getting exposed. 
---
The expose applies quicker but doesn't last as long. 
---
Crouching while stalking and peeking while stalking causes you to stalk faster. 
---
One thing I have questions about...
---
The Mori features a cell phone but to what social media site is he posting to? Is Snapchat accessible from the realm of the Entity? Does the Entity offer fiber optic internet connection? Are there functioning cell towers? These are questions I need the answer to
---
It’s bing bong boi!
---
Its not realistic that we are skipping chapters... those are what keeps DBD alive and brings new players as well. Its not like DBD can stand itself without updates like R6 did (with operation health).
---
I think it should be on the to do list but there are so many thinks that actually harm the game that should come first...
---
i can tell that u have clearly no clue what u are talking about, pls play the game for a longer time with friends and u will notice what i mean,
---
it is annoying and after 3 years  that this game has been out that type of stuff is should be a feature.
---
Who does that ?? Its both killer and survivors fault for that mess... if killer was camping hatch I always went and found a gen.. I gotta make points. When I played as killer I'd just hit them and let them jump in.  Some people just have that mentality I gotta have a 4k...
---
I play the game almost since week one. With and without friends (as they come and go), again its not worth the man power just so you have one less click to do.
---
Until the slug you and camp your corpse until the DS timer runs out
---
Adrenaline. Balanced landing. Decisive strike. And the last slot is flexible. I go with Quick and Quiet when looping for the occasional locker juke but Mettle of Man is more reliable
---
Its whatever character I play with... years playing this game and to this day I still have games where I simply won't hit a single one.
---
"powerful"
---
what is the problem by that? i dont get your problem.
---
it makes stuff easier and hurts no one
---
just kobe and git gud 4head /s
---
It depends. First and foremost, don't teabag when doing it. Then it's a matter of not wasting time. I'll only do it if I wasn't going to leave anyways and the killer is within terror radius. On top of that if they just stop and stare at me, I leave. The whole point is to be considerate, so be considerate.
---
But it's just 12 seconds. I don't think that that is too much time wasted on the ground. And he DC'ed. I would rather waste 12 extra seconds on a match and keep thousands of blood point where it would be impossible to make up for in 12 seconds in another match rather than DC and be in great loss.
---
Like what? 
---
I mean it's not like the chapters are so full of content that they singlehandedly keeps the game alive. 
---
Not sure if you noticed but it's slowly dying even with 4 chapters a year. Yeah, a chapter is fun for a week at most but after that it's just the same old boring gameplay. Nothing changed.
---
Also, there are so many bugs in this game that exist for three years. Would be so fucking nice if they tried to fix some problems/bugs that seem so small but completely ruin the fun in the long run.
---
Not sure why that seems to be so hard to comprehend for u.
---
It wasn't ok, this is why it was changed.
---
It takes man power... thats the entire point. The game code isn't going to rewrite itself, it could take several hours of their programmers to change it and make sure every single functionality is working (even days depending on how badly its coded). Even simple things can lead to broken shit, remember the infinite buying of the same node on the bloodweb? That came with a single button added to the game... it took them days of man power to completely fix it, deploy and ban people for it.
---
If it ain't broke don't fix it.
---
Again I don’t use it every game on every killer I don’t need to rely on it, I’m aware of other perks that slow down the game, I’m just stating that in games like one out of 20, where the rng screws me over I’m gone.
---
The cutest lil bing bong.
---
It happened to me on the big house on Backwater Swamp, the windows on the second floor. It's no big deal there, still annoying tho...
---
Damn, you really got that devious farming Doctor
---
*cries in yoink*
---
Compared to all the other stuff it's probably way easier. But you're missing the whole point.
---
Understandable but yeah I was just getting on the exaggeration. I play this game a fuck ton and I watch others play it a lot. And just from observation the fact for the points you made to happen almost every game is exaggerated, glad that you acknowledged that. Theres some things you can do yourself to help reduce some of these issues by a lot. For example you can run dstrike just for the tunneling itself and maybe mettle of man, two great perks just for killers that do that. As far as the connection issues and queue times we just all gotta be a bit more patient for the dedicated servers unfortunately.
---
We're gonna be in debt forever.
---
A cake turned into a war on urban
---
aww thanks! haha
---
Flashlight saves should give WGLF stacks tbh.
---
He can only get hit by pallets if the survivor who triggered it is asleep. There's still t-walls, obstacles, and buildings in the dreamworld, so he'd still have to walk through them as he does normally. I don't see the problem here. I only said pallets, so that doesn't mean anything else.
---
Grabbing people off gens with Pig made me smile :)
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that Last Year tweet regarding pennywise. So unfortunate, feels like wasted potential
---
I have the same problem with my M1. So I've bound primary action to F. Now I might even keep it once I get a mew mouse.
---
They want their friend to actually play the game and have fun
---
They had to make models for them because you can see through their masks a bit (especially Joey‘s mask lets you see the eyes of them a bit).
---
Yeah, you know that because you actually studied their system and knows exactly how great they used to do stuff there when they started and how well organized their coding is. Missing the whole point here.
---

Gj, im stuck at purple ranks lol. Gonna p3 my blendette and play it safe to get the achievement i guess
---
Whenever I post memes about killers camping I get a fuckton of downvotes and shit talking messages. I know survivors get a bad rep about being toxic, but my god, killers try and victimize it to put people down, and end up becoming far worse.
---
No cause I still got blood points and ranked up
---
It's a cap
---
Oh well, it was his loss
---
Be patient I have acoostim. I main legion
---
Most of my characters are P3 I learned that all you have to do is avoid the killer and do the objective. Somehow people think that's impossible to do
---
My dad and I think the struggle mechanic should be skill check based. I doubt they'll change it though.
---
Friggin?? Are you Randy??
---
It depends on the map and how good you are at tracking blood
---
Yep that's what happens when your internet dcs as killer. As you lost connection with the 4 other survivors it ends the game like all 4 of them dc'd
---
Agreed.
---
I mean, you can have less in KYF can't you?
---
the perk is bad on huntress but yes it works with her reload
---
Yeah ikr. Playing aggressive is fun and all, but so is immersed, as long as youre helping the team
---
I mean, it's not wrong though. KYF can start with less too iirc
---
In one of the leaks about the power it mentioned if a survivor catches you stalking them it drains your power faster. So if a survivor stares back at you your power may drain before you can fully expose them.
---
sToP OBjeCTiFyiNg (jk), it is a pretty keyboard indeed
---
Technically yes, but still in the gamemodes where you can earn bloodpoints its impossible.
---
As long as you help the team it's all fair game.
---
5 stacks lullaby &gt;&gt;&gt; ruin. GL with that thou. Why don't they let us place our own totems?

♫Here comes the Fapper!♫
---
If totem placement was better, I'd agree - but there's been so many times I've had my totem cleansed at match start pretty much. I still run it, I occasionally have matches where I have 5 stacks nearly all match.
---
But I'm going to replace it with Ruin as soon as I can if only because Ruin provides an immediate and flat bonus where Lullaby provides a slow stacking bonus that has a strong chance of being made useless right as the match starts.
---
But at rank one you get good swf who can extend the chase more and talk about who kills who. Running a perk doesn’t make you bad at the game.

What is this crap? Why is it on dbd reddit?
---
Well, I mean at lot of toxic players will d/c to spite the killer and prevent them from getting the points they earned. It's not really fair to the killer who put in work to get those points. I figured it'd remove that, "Fuck you, you're not getting these points, Killer." bullshit.
---
Your entire post is complaning about toxicity in your profile, people presented you with a solution. You misunderstood that solution and got downvoted. You're now complaining that people downvoted your post. You're pretty much as toxic as everyone else. You won't change the community, because guess what that is how the world is. People are toxic everywhere and the best you can do is not get affected by it.
---
Imagine quing up for a casuall game of dbd and seeing this. 10/10 would wet ma pants.

Finding other players with Hex: and then something witty always makes me smile and spare them. I can't let a fellow hex die.

He can only expose one person VS Myers 4
---
I wouldn't mind seeing a nerf to Lullaby where, should it be cleansed at 5 stacks only, it remains with purely the 5 stack effect where it doesn't signal a skill check.
---
It just requires focus to be entirely on the skill checks rather than being able to look around and see if the killer is close.
---
Man you are so awesome, thanks a lot! Gonna use it as my phone background if you don’t mind.
---
the stacking part of lullaby is ass though the only reason the perk is decent is the failed skillcheck damage increase
---
Wow. This made me relate so hard that I cried.
---
Look at the bottom
---
About the daily one:
---
The other day I had a daily where I had to open the gate as Jeff. I changed my in-game name to “Gate Daily” so I wouldn’t have to explain it to my teammates.
---
I go in with a friend in SWF so I can (hopefully) ensure I get at least one gate open. Hell, I’ll even give myself to the killer if I can just *get one damn gate open*.
---
Very first match I get is a fairly bad Nurse who gets more or less looped the entire game until the end, when it turns out she has NOED (of course, why wouldn’t she). My friend has 99%’ed the gate and I’m trying desperately to get to it JUST TO OPEN THE DAMN THING and she keeps floating back and forth, denying it. By this point, by the way, the other two idiots have long since opened the other gate and the EGC is ticking down (I think it’s halfway done at this point). So finally the fuckin’ Nurse downs me and puts me up on hook to die. I hate that Nurse to this day.
---
But on a more positive note, the next match was against a Hag who did ***really really well*** against us. She downed me last after everyone else was dead, brought me to the hatch, dropped me there, and *closed it in my face*.
---
...But then she took me to a gate and let me open it and escape. I don’t know how to feel about this game sometimes.
---
*wearing glowing orange pizza boy outfit with a team of P3 Claudettes*
---
Legion is the only one with intersing ones and that's only because they are different people
---
It wouldn't work because before it didn't work. The vault speed was too fast before so they decided not to have bamboozle increase the vault speed. But now that they reworked legion and their vault speed is significantly slower, the speed increase should now affect it but maybe behavior forgot to change it to do that, wouldn't be surprised.
---
Again, I don’t want a solution. I already thought of the solutions and I don’t even want to set my comments to private, I just want my questioned answered, and it was. You guys haven’t helped because I already considered that option, but didn’t take it. And how am I as toxic as everyone else.
---
Also kinda void some of the things I said it was at 2 or 3 AM and I was just salty about people being salty, so sorry if I came across as toxic
---
I was more referring to the ability of the perk itself, ignoring the crap totem spawns. Indeed ruin is better because you don't really have to get stacks or do anything. I hope they improve totem spawns so we see more people running devour hope, huntress lullaby and perhaps even the third seal
---
I play on PS4
---

---
Wraith is for chumps.
---
I changed my struggle keybind to mousewheel down and it feels much better than space bar IMO. Maybe worth a try
---
My controller has a turbo function. So, I don't even have to mash. Yet somehow, a button pressed is missed and I die. This happens only from time to time.
---
I totally agree. And personally I feel like they shouldnt tinker too much with powers and basespeed etc. There should be something like when you hook a survivor, you have a 3-5 second sprint orso available to move on. Mobility is a huge issue for all killers... thats why people go for killers like nurse, Billy, spirit and legion. Because they have consistent insane mobility, nurse and Billy being by far superior. Being able to shut down loops helps, but reaching said loop within 25 seconds of map traversing would also greatly help...
---
When you hop on legion have franks mixtape a Mori and whatever other toxic add on
---
Rare footage of a killer making it past the exit gate barrier
---
open a party to the community with the name "where did they go" it's pretty much mandatory to have a 4 man squad
---
I like how you tied the 2nd point in with the lore, I like that idea. Unfortunately Freddy's problems are more deep rooted which is why it's taken 2 years and requires a full rework. You can't even hit survivors when you're carrying one to the hook (unless the other survivor is in the dream world). I think it would be cool if a sleep deprivation mechanic was brought in where survivors would constantly fall in and out of sleep not knowing when they're in a dream or reality. Not sure how it would work though.
---
Oh, I agree that the ability of the perk is underrated, but I think that directly tied into totem spawns. If spawn locations were better - a bit more hidden, a bit more risky, Lullaby would easily outclass Ruin for good killer mains.
---
this with jumpscare myers and caxcombed/ghost wraith
---
I’ve found the waits to play killer have been really long lately, but some say it could be due to ranks and what not.
---
Being a competent nurse crushes any swf team, a good nurse makes the game a joke.
---
It's ok if you need ruin to make the game easier on yourself, but don't call yourself a good nurse if you need it to do well. You're playing her with training wheels.
---
*Insert Tom no meme here
---
This sounds indicates that you just gained/consumed a stack from a perk.
---
Was this on the meat plant? If so it automatically makes this 1000x better
---
&gt; Ever since I have started playing DBD, my profile has gotten more and more toxic.
---
That is what you opened your topic with. Not sure what question you were asking that isn't related to that... you effectively stop the toxicity in your profile comments if you set it to friends only or private. There is absolutely no way they will be toxic in your profile comments if you switch that.
---
You're as toxic as everyone else because everyone is toxic unless you're some breed of alien then perhaps I'm mistaken.
---
Dude it was a demo that got leaked. Of course it will be changed. Work in progress
---
It seems slower for me too. In the last patch, I got survivors within a minute but now it takes about 3 minutes.
---
Ok. Good
---
Far from it, don't even need a coordinated SWF to pull it off, sometimes as solo i'll keep one side of the map sabo'd and if my teammates realize what i'm doing they'll run to that side when chased = no hooks for killer = ez escape.
---
Reason why i don't think sabo needs buffs. One single survivor can completely fuck up a killer's game with well timed sabo.
---
Been as slow as ever for me.
---
I mean again I don’t need to use ruin, sure I’m not a god nurse, but I’m defiantly not a baby. I’m not sure why I feel I need to explain my perk choices to people, but if someone thinks ruin makes you mad, using adrenaline, self care, BT, and dead hard make you trash.
---
Edit: also the pip system is fucked so sometimes even when I 4K and they gen rush me I will depip, even with blood warden
---
I burst out laughing when I saw this lol
---
Facts there was no reason to be downvoted. But yeah Trapper always feels faster than the rest
---
I was going to say that if you immediately started a chase it would be like you had just spotted you obsession...  but I think Charlie nailed it
---
Bottom-right skillchecks used to be the bane of my existence due to a game stuttering issue on my old pc.
---
The Survivor while struggling feels pain and terror. The point of clicking repeatedly is to feel the same.
---
Noed
---
Same at rank 20.
---
Dramatic is right!  In this case it means survivors broke a dull totem and thrill of the hunts penalty to totem cleansing speed is slightly reduced
---
I agree completely. Being able to pull out an emergency medkit with potentially an insta-heal or even a gel dressing and a gauze roll is so nice. 
---
Honestly I think loot builds in general are nice because it gives you a new objective in your matches other than just doing gens or totems. It's fun finding flashlights with good addons and sharing them among teammates.
---
Predator Hunting Grounds
---
\*clangs bloody shovel and cricket bat\*
---
I'm currently rank 16, I'm usually 14 tho so maybe.
---
Even as a survivor, the server’s been slow to find a lobby.
---
Same here.
---
If The other 3 had dced I would have as well if I brought a rainbow map...
---
No, if you read the entire thing I literally ended it with questions. The last being “is this normal” no where did I ask for a solution, and again sure I might get mad in end game chat once in a while, but never comment on a profile or send death threats. Since you didn’t read the original post I’m guessing you haven’t read any of my comments either
---
Here is what I’m trying to say in simpler terms:
---
DBD is toxic, it has gotten worse over the years. I don’t like this, why does this happen? Is it normal?
---
Comments|| I know you can set your profile to private, but don’t want to. At the same time I don’t want to set my comments to private because I get nice people from other games. I never asked for a solution it was for venting and an answer on why this game was toxic.
---
He had Rancor, this perk allows him, once all the gens are powered, too insta-down his obsession and Mori them
---
If you watch closely, it’s delayed but it gives a stack at the end of the video.
---
Killing my obsession with Rancor is very satisfying.
---
This is why I don't get why people WANT to get to rank1. It just makes your game shittier and more miserable
---
Yeah and when I play killer I never double pip because dc meta. Even I have that thought that these assholes dc on me 90% of the time why should I stay? I always stay but just thinking about the double standard that survivor quits all the time.  Watch streamers like monto , panda or any other and if they post a vid of them playing 2 games as killer there will be a dc in one or both games.  We have some salty cry baby dipshit players . I just played 5 games as pig. Had 6 dc .  I wish we had a dc % next to name so you can be dodged and ridiculed.
---
Honestly, that was the best Mori to have for that.
---
I mean i don’t really care about not hitting survivors while i’m carrying someone since as freddy you can just walk past them as awake survivors dont have a hitbox
---
It’s a razer. I have one and highly recommend it.
---
Oh, sorry mate... you can make friends on there or something...? Idk
---
I just find him boring
---
There is nothing wrong with running Ruin on her, it's more of a problem with Nurse herself than with Ruin.
---
Ruin on her only shows you're not confident with her, which again, there is nothing wrong with.
---
also if you ever make an updated version: hemorrhage*
---
The killers that scare me the most are the ones that can sneak up on you when you least expect it. Myers, spirit with prayer beads, wraith. Freddy, even the crouched piggy gets my anxiety going.
---
Nothing about him makes him better than the average M1 killers.
---
the PLAG dude!
---
I know it's not that essential, but it's a basic feature every killer has, and that's Freddy's issue; he can't do the basic things other killers can do. The other issue is that means Freddy can't run certain perks effectively e.g. Mad grit would be pointless for the above reason.
---
Well yeah you are right, at rank one sometimes a really good player will kick my ass if he is in SWF, I only have like 15 hours with her.
---
Wowie that's a long delay, ty for pointing it out.
---
eh, you don’t really need to run totems as freddy, not even ruin, since 
---
1. You can’t do anything about survivors cleansing totems (i know you gave an idea about this)
---
2. Freddy is able to completely stall the game and slowly win (with Class Photo)
---
Reason number 2 is the reason i don’t want a freddy rework and why i don’t think he’s the worst (trust me, even without addons freddy becomes Pause button: the character)
---
That's why I love this game, so many memorable moments and unpredictable outcomes.
---
it's a catgirl, but then again its a legion. My brain can't process these kind of things.
---
&gt;See, it’s based off of the survivors mistakes not what the killer does.
---
You watched too much Tyde, drop that argument because it doesn't make sense. We all try to capitalize on the opponents mistakes.
---
&gt;This implies they haven’t done the totems
---
All 4 survivors looking for all the totems is not viable. All totems barely ever get cleansed even when you search for them.
---
&gt;aren’t smart enough to conserver their pallets
---
Umm you do realize it's not survivors being stupid that the pallets get used, they will, better survivors will use it more efficiently but they will get used by the end.
---
&gt;and stupid enough to not recover their exhaustion if not in a chase.
---
I didn't realize crouching around the map with UE is meta, my bad lmao. Especially with the new endgame throwing your team under the bus is not an option not should you ever do it if you are over rank 15. Doors need to be opened, gens need to be done etc.
---
&gt;If they are in a chase, they get a speed boost and health state healed.
---
Pro tip: if by the end of the match they are dead it won't happen. If it happens to multiple people at once you failed already. If it happens to only one it's gonna be a little bit harder, but nothing too serious. Also now he has exhaustion. Also completely countered by Noed. How would you feel if hope and adrenaline was a single perk? Still would be more balanced than noed considering more 4k happen before last gen than all totems got cleansed.
---
&gt;All good survivor perks can not be countered actively by the killer,
---
You sure about that? We can go through it one by one. There are solid perks for sure, but nothing too serious. (Okay maybe MoM)
---
Ruin spawn is a different topic.
---
I would however like you to address why do you think a perk that makes shitty killers powerful is balanced. Or a perk that only becomes stronger when you work against it considering you find the easy totems first.
---
That's just a place holder. Don't worry, the art team will be on it 👍
---
wtf is MoM
---
I use Happy Clowns Perks :D
---
Maybe because fedora man doesn’t play like other killers... This is why i hate people that start complaining about freddy when they don’t even bother on learning freddy
---
When you get hooked after the exit is open and everyone else has escaped and you manage to Kobe off and escape. First time that happened I was SO EXCITED 😂
---
Just don't m1, 4head
---
Holy crap! I love it
---
Wraith would be so sick!
---
How'd he even get to some of these spots? This is hilarious. I love how he's partially sideways in some of them.
---
I think Freedy is intentional
---
It's been said before that rituals appear based on which side you haven't been playing as much.  No idea if it's true, but it'd make sense if they were intended to get people to experience both sides of the game.
---
*Jack nichelson nod meme*
---
No :( Coldwind.
---
Legion was buffed, not nerfed(unless you needed Frank's Mixtape).  
---
They're much more fun to play against and have actual counterplay.  
---
Legion now requires some level of skill.
---
There’s been times I go seemingly weeks without missing a skillcheck but then there’s those days I fail every single one constantly
---
You could literally say the same thing about any killer but the thesis here stays true: Legion is now a generic killer. What made him broken was the moon walking exploit and instead of tweaking that they got dusted.
---
https://youtu.be/SE-mM5ciuNg
---
I have actually made sure I always have the button ready to “record last few minutes” because it’s comedic how I will be focused on even when someone closer only needs to be hit once but the killer will keep going for me instead and I just don’t get it.
---
Spotted the German-speaking person :)
---
Its a "No Material" texture in Unreal Engine
---
It could make repair skill checks slightly harder on generators and make the lights associated with each generator show if the gen is being worked on to make it easier to tell from a distance. If it worked like this it’d be really good for huntress, spirit, and billy probably.
---
You forget the option where they just make it not work on Freddy, period.  Probably followed quickly by a bug where NO perks work on Freddy.
---
One of his biggest issues is that landing his chainsaw charge without addons **requires** the survivors to run *toward* you. You just move at 100% speed, so they just have to run in a strait line away from it. Like, what?? lmao
---
Leatherface is better than Freddy because if you want to play it as a M1 base killer you can and rarely use your chainsaw. You can't do that with freddy and his power is just straight harmful, specially without some expensive addons.
---
That doesn't make him good or anything but he has a place, leatherface is decent for people starting in the game, its easy to use and against bad survivors its great.
---
Damn, really?  I could've swore I had found one since then, but my memory is pretty shit.  I'll certainly take your word for it, though.  Thanks for clarifying
---
The thing is, I have a friend I play this game with, and we’ve been greeting each other (on the phone and IRL) like this for years. It’s like a dream coming true lol
---
im glad survivors are finally understanding that it’s toxic to try and escape
---
Imagine if you were able to see perks and offering of your fellow teammates?
---
Would be cool thing to buff solo players, also with voice chat. BUT! To compensate this, we would need a Killer changes/buffs/reworks
---
They’re still the bane of my existence on console
---
Yeah no I’m glad you are calling me toxic. It was my post and it was a question, but instead only had people like you thinking they are mega mind realizing you can set your profile to private, don’t get mad I don’t take your advice when I never asked for it. Again “I don’t give a shit about [your advice]”
---
It's the sideways glitch :) atleast that's what I call it   
---
My friend helped me with it, but I don't think I can tell you because it's kinda abusable
---
I, personally, think it'll be a nice addition to all totem perks.  
---
Ruin not being active until someone gets a gen skillcheck.  
---
Devour Hope not being active until the first buff(2 stacks).  
---
Third Seal will activate on hit.
---
JEFF NEEDS THE CHONK FOR THE COLD WINTERS OF CANADA
---
Oh, it's a jerk thing to do, for sure, just felt like it bears pointing out that the concede option was fairly well supported by killers for quite some time, and was largely ignored by others.
---
Yes but every Killer is good against noobs. Freddy can do some insane plays  and mindgames. He is  very dependant if the survs are an SWF or solo tho. But overall against halfway skilled Survs he is still much better than Leatherface.  Leatherface wont be able to use his saw 1 time against a good surv, unless the survivor makes a big mistake himself.
---
I agree for a few, but devour isn’t one of them. I used devour perfectly fine (at rank 1, if it matters) on a few killers, and that was before haunted grounds existed. Sure, it was sometimes a dead perk, but that goes for all the hexes. There were plenty of times it singlehandedly won me games. Any killer that can back to a hook quickly (Hag, Nurse, Billy, quick build Wraith, etc) barely take a penalty for it anyway. Good combo with BBQ
---
Thanks! I'll definitely use your advice if I make one for killers!
---
*Yes, cats.*
---
BHVR doesn't balance for the best players, they do call of duty balancing for the average. In call of duty balance land, its ok for something to be extremely powerful in the hands of a few people as long as its not for the average.
---
Nurse could easily be compared to a sniper rife, horrible in the hands of a bad player, average in the hands of a normal player.So good in the hands of a great player that they can single-handedly shut down entire parts of the map against multiple enemies and quick scope to outdo any other gun outside of point blank range.
---
You're arguing from a point of balance that the game doesn't use, DS only got nerfed after 2 years because it got popular, it was just as broken after 2 years as it was when it released. The only thing that changed was how many people were using it. Nurse is the same deal, not enough people play her well because its too difficult, if that changes she will get nerfed.
---
If you're not a fan of the struggle mechanic then their game design succeeded. They've said themselves that they don't want it to be fun.
---
He isn't really supposed to be played now... Frenzy is rarely useful tbh since you can't hurt them past injured and you DS yourself after it.
---
The way you're supposed to use it is to find other players but then you won't be able to harm them anyway and you don't even know if they are mending or not because the progress bar is hidden, so your power literally does nothign.
---
Freddy in D, right.
---
And even if the rescuer **did** have BT, if Bubba is running Insidious. Literally 0 counterplay to that unless the hooked surv happens to be on their 3rd MoM hit.
---
Why even do that to the Claud in the first place
---
I think his movement speed while charging is 87.5% or 3.5 meters per second. If the information I read is correct.
---
or if they have decisive, but the chances to die outweigh the chances to live
---
Lullaby shouldn't even ping for Survivors as an issue at 5 stacks. If you're paying attention, you can hit the skill checks. The strongest thing about it is that it forces them to hyper-focus on skill checks, so they're less apt to be looking around them. Works well with a M&amp;A killer.
---
That said, most people are potatoes who are used to not having to think about hitting skill checks. This perk is only as effective as the Survivors are lazy.
---
Thanks. I wasn't sure about the red text. Now I know how to make the killer version better if I make one
---
I like how some people's testimony about the new legion is (I stopped being a bad player and toxic for the survivor community) I stopped DCing. Wow new legion is fun to play against. I still probably have a habit of DCing on other killers because I feel entitled to show everyone how I feel by increasing the difficulty of the game for my teammates. It's 100% justified because everyone else does it.
---
That aside new legion sucks for red ranks and vs good SWFs. They exploit everything about how weak they are. Body blocking, Flashlight saves, and now they just stand in your terror radius and hot potato gens. Best part Legion is now fun for survivors to bully, because their power does nothing. Congrats you just deep wounded everyone. They can still function as if you only M1ed them.
---
Using Frenzy is worse than before since if you plan to injure multiple survivors be prepare for them to... Get away! 4 sec stun. Chase potential of Frenzy can be looped. It's not that bad in thought, because wow counter play. However you have to then be stunned for 4 sec and then have a 20sec for recharge. When the other option is to just M1 them. Against good players you start weighing the option of do you want to use your slightly better than M1 power and risk wasting time. Time at Red Rank throws the game. 
---
Legion's addons, aside from the pink and cooldown reduction(which barely do anything), are non-existent buffs for them.
---
At 20-10 rank level play with all other killers legion is fine.
---
I think that Pig is the worst right now, with the right perks and addons, Leatherface is viable
---
cool picture though always going to love legion model!
---
Any killer can be effective in the right hands. I think some people do jump on the bandwagon for Freddy being the worst without even understanding the reason why people have that opinion. But nonetheless, a large portion of the community feels Freddy is weak due to basic mechanics missing from his play style. Bubba can be played as an M1 killer, he has built in brutal strength with his chainsaw for pallets, and he can down multiple survivors at once punishing sloppy hook rescues. You're right that his chainsaw can be tricky without add ons, but that can be said for most killer powers. Bubba has the strongest basement game for a reason, and that's why so many people use him for basement builds. I haven't thought about who I'd personally consider the weakest, but it's not bubba imo.
---
Would swap legion with doctor, other than that pretty spot on.
---
If you're looking to pull aggro, it's pretty much the fastest way to get a Killer on you. 
---
Survivor: breaks hook in front of killer
---
Killer: come here you little shit
---
I could see that
---
So cute! Etsy when?
---
The Pig is not addon reliant, you can slow the game down alot and you can do some insane mindgames with her crouch charge. She is midtier and 1000x better than Leatherface.
---
lol but how do you down someone...
---
Yeah its pretty bad but who gives a damn about ranks
---
I see.  I looked it up just now and apparently they are two spellings of the same word.  the more you know!
---
I'd say Legion's better, as his power gives him the ability to hit people very easily.
---
I thought people hated that map
---
Excuse me?
---
Got a problem with me?
---
Franks Mixtape is terrible now though.
---
I see leatherface and think "let the camping begin" then again, I play Xbox
---
Freddy was pretty powerful
---
Except you can’t have enough time to cleanse all the totems, let alone try to even find them all, in the time it takes the survivors to die on the hook while the killers camp. You’re on a time crunch trying to get as many gens done as possible before the killer finds you and camps you. You must be the same kind of person that thinks “gen rushing” is an actual thing.
---
Finding players has never been the issue though. Is he more like a fast-vault doctor now, then?
---
This made me exhale a lot of air from my nose, good job.
---
Singing the lyrics to Dancing Queen, running straight into the uncloaked Wraith and then proceeding to scream the lyrics instead. Good times.
---
If you are skilled with survivor you can just  not drop the pallet at some loops because the slow down of the saw, will give you a gap again. Also you cant saw around corners too sharp, which makes the gap between you even bigger.
---
And the Doctor's gives him the ability to find people very easily.
---
I had a game earlier on the swamp against a hag where I had to sit and die on my first hook while watching two people work on a gen, another person finish their gen then self-care in a corner while someone on the duo gen got downed and the other chased. Sometimes I wish kindred was built in.
---
It's a nice idea. I think cosmetics as a killer are mainly for intimidation rather than your viewing pleasure. The problem with changing audio cues is that sound is a massive tool for both killer and survivor. You hear a nurse blink or a wraith's bell and you instantly know what you're up against. Adding more sounds means even more of a learning curve for new players. I do agree that prices should be lower though.
---
Easily maybe, but not always quickly. The Doctor simply saves time. Much like the Legion does. Additionally, assuming you're running Restraint add-ons, which I feel are his best anyway, you can track them long distance as well. He can also shut down certain loops if you can get the timing on his shocks right, but I'll admit that it can be very inconsistent.
---
Don't play Legion. Their "rework" is F-tier and isn't fun to use. The previous Legion wasn't good either. The character is a trash fire, their power is pretty useless, even with purple add-ons.
---
Pick another 115% movespeed killer and you'll get infinitely better results.
---
Smh
---
So why is Legion broken compared to these other ones?
---
I met some nice survivors for a change, that made me smile
---
Currently there is a lawsuit going on with Friday the 13 so nobody can do anything with the licensing until it's done. It might take years.

---
Wow now you can only play certain killers
---
A survivor park shouldn't change what killer you play
---
Where’s plag?
---
I really like new Legion. I see a lot of people putting him low tier but i think he’s a lot better than the common mid tier picks like Doctor and Trapper. The only thing I don’t like are some of his add ons seem useless. Frank’s Mixtape wouldn’t be too awful if you could still see the Deep Wound progress, but as it stands it sucks. Also his Pin add ons are pretty bad. There’s literally no reason to stab the same person multiple times in Frenzy, and the effects you gain from the add ons don’t do much to change that. IMO his best add ons are Stolen Sketchbook, Cold Dirt, Susie’s Mixtape, and Iridescent Button.
---
Tbh you have to work very hard with freddy for it to do the basics... its not easy at all to play and its not rewarding enough for the effort.
---
Although it's not formatted as such, this feels like a haiku to me.
---
If you kept reading you'd see I said it would need rebalanced
---
scary when you want more hatchets and pull Death Metal Jeff out and get jumpscared
---
He actually became one of my favourites to play
---
I just love running around hitting everyone
---
game is not even fun in red rank...everyone plays like they will make a job out of it...
---
I'd say the Broken Effect pin is actually not bad. Never a bad thing not letting them heal for a minute.
---
Skins for killers seem more made for intimidation factor. Like character skins in first person shooters.
---
Shhhh don’t tell the devs but I think this is the new survivor leak.
---
Ah ok, I get it now. I do agree with these points, but he is great for snowballing and slowing the game down (just a lil bit) if you keep tagging everyone with frenzy. Also, the standard cooldown is 4 seconds, a survivor can cover 16m in a straight line in that time. With 4.6m/s, Legion can get there in about 3.5 seconds, which isn't that long. Now, about pallets, you can unlock in front of a survivor, they will either run through you, meaning you will catch up in less than 3.5 seconds, or they turn and run the other way cutting them off.
---
The tier list probably applies to a certain level of player. Low ranks aren't going to see nurse as a high tier killer, whereas trapper may do quite well.
---
the PLAAAAG DUDE. Between clown and legion
---
I prestiged for the first time ever with Fen Ming and that made me really happy
---
Honestly I don't think there's a huge difference between B and C, they're all pretty close to one another.
---
It's that Freddy is pretty low and the other five are pretty high.
---
People is starting to realize that Legion post nerf is useless. Its easily C perhaps D.
---
The newest patch makes it were you can’t see there dw bar depletion
---
What happened to the Hag? Was it one of Plague's perks that broke her?
---
Because I got this game right after Legion came out and everyone was saying that Hag was bottom tier.
---
Dbd has an official merch shop, and they're selling David King bodypillows. I am so proud of this community.

---
From my experience the opposite. She has great map pressure and snowballing, and un some cases setting traps at loops can end it
---
I'm more of a horror comedy fan, so yeah there's another team. 
---
#GhostBoi
---
I mean legion didnt come out that long ago but anyway
---
Game balance is better than ever but honestly games not very fun right now, most games have survivors disconnecting or the killer bringing some broken af addons. Imo the games become quite boring 
---
Plague is...okay. She just ends up kinda boring to play as everyone just doesnt heal against her or use her fountains so shes just an m1 killer most of the time. Not suprised though given how not healing is almost the meta now after healing was nerfed
---
Is it just me or is her bust just entirely absent in this outfit?
---
I swear I'm not trying to be a creep/horndog, I just care about accurate va-va-voom and badonkadonk representations. Equal opportunist, too; you dunno how disappointed I was that they nerfed Snake's butt in Ultimate.
---
We already have trappy boi. Why pay to have Jason specially with the current licensing dispute with Friday the 13th
---
Rule 1: Buy Leatherface
---
Rule 2: Unlock Insidious
---
Rule 3: Hook Survivor in basement
---
Rule 4: Camp
---
Pennywise will never be coming to any video game. That’s up to Stephen King and it seems he’s against it. Warner Brothers who wanted Pennywise in MK11, a game they own, couldn’t even get him and they own both IT movies! 
---
It was quit obvious that Behaviour wanted him back in Winter. They stared to follow King and WB on twitter and teased Pennywise on streams only for it to all end with them denying they wanted him and saying he wouldn’t work.  King denied them like he did with MK11.
---
As for that Last Year tweet it will lead nowhere. I doubt they will succeed where MK11 and DbD failed.
---
I genuinely don’t think Ruin will ever leave the meta at this point; I’ve all but given up on that one. 
---
**Mettle Of Man** sounds... frustrating? Not sure, I’d have to go against it to make a solid opinion. 
---
The perk I’m most interested in is Plague’s obsession perk; I’d imagine it being fucking AMAZING on Doctor.
---
So how have pig nerfs been received? I haven't been able to play dbd too much because of finals but how have the nerfs gone over? Did it really hurt her end game like people were afraid of or is it ok now because EGC is two minutes? 
---
Also I found this really wholesome.
---
Sorry man, whenever I see leatherface, I instantly dc bc all he does is camp. Never seen any other playstyle, and I’d rather not waste my time.
---
Halloween
---
I specifically remember working an inventory job at an airport. Super unproductive day because our team had to move as one group from store to store, which meant incredible downtime. I was pissed because the day was taking so long, all the meanwhile I was staring at Reddit waiting for Myers. 
---
I ended up buying it on my phone via Steam app during our "lunch" break. I watched any stream I could find with Myers being played throughout the rest of that shift, lol.
---
Really? Unless you watched a tyde tyme video.
---
She is excellent for two things, defending objectives (gens, hooked players, exit  gates.) And if you know what you are doing ending chases quickly.
---
Plus she isn't perk or addon reliant like some killers. Overall I agree with her placement. Because even if the survivors are able to not trigger your traps by crouching they still have to slow down, which stalls the game.
---
&gt;you can't cheese out the chase with her like you could with old Legion. that was broken. not overpowered.
---
&gt;could with old Legion
---
Legion isn't broken, Legion *was* broken* because you could abuse the chase and there was no way to escape it. Nurse is overpowered. *hitboxes* are broken, not killers. Spirit is perfectly balanced. 
---
i can repeat it again if you like

Now I feel bad.  After the first two DC’d I figured I’d just troll around and let you guys get some points.  Then when the third DC’d the hatch spawned on my feet.  The gates where maybe 2m outside whispers range from each other so I could track if you had actually gone to the other gate easily.  I will say that there was no counter play in the situation .
---
If it were a normal game when I had actually killed the other three I don’t think it’s OP if I found the hatch first that you don’t have a chance.  Being basically 1v1 it was sleazy and I’m sorry.
---
True. I guess my problem with it is the fact that hitting someone twice ends your Frenzy. And once your Frenzy ends, you’re probably gonna hit the guy you hit last anyway. 60 second Broken doesnt do much if you just end up chasing them and downing them anyways.
---
Why are you talking about old Legion if everyone including OP is talking about the reworked Legion? I never said old Legion wasnt broken, but I don't see why new Legion would be considered broken and those I listed are not, you could have save a lot of time by saying it was about old Legion.
---
What build you running? After playing him after his update I had a hard time. Then I ran ruin, BBQ (discordance until I got BBQ), thanatophobia, and sloppy butcher. 
---
Honestly, once I ran thanatophobia and sloppy butcher together I started running games and getting double pips. Really great combo on the legion if you play him the way he's designed to be played (tagging multiple survivors with deep would if they are around)
---
Wtf are you saying and why did you capitalize the entire title as if it was important?
---
Noted stay on hook
---
I find plenty of situations where healing myself is more effective than running to someone else so I can get working on a gen that's on a part of the map no one  else is in.
---
If you actually were the billy, don't feel bad, it's fine
---
Dwight's Curse
---
Typical blendette behavior
---
Haha is your Quentin a virgin?
---
My three main killers are Trapper, Pig, and Doctor, and YMMV but I was pretty disappointed with it to be honest. The idea is pretty good (Hit the Obsession to the ground and walk away so anyone who comes to pick them up is maddened while doing so) but in general I found it to be kind of a waste of time when I'd rather be finding them then being stealthy.
---
I'm going to have to revisit it with the obsession perk that got leaked, but as of right now I'm not impressed.
---
Mettle of Man is frustrating for certain killers, definitely. Doctor and Pig don't really have much to deal with it, but Trapper at least can steer people into traps to pull them off so they don't get the trigger.
---
Keep in mind that they have to be injured for it to work, so any sort of Exposed status (NoED, MYC, H:HG, or similar) completely negates it if they're healthy when you hit them.
---
I don't know how to answer that
---
I couldn't say every killer is broken, no. And moonwalking wasn't his only problem: he could tunnel anyone without pretty much any skill. I honestly can't imagine other ways to fix that than what BHVR did.
---
yeah, you are stupid. 
---
you said Nurse, Huntress and Spirit are broken. i said OLD LEGION was broken.
---
We fucking get it
---
Out of all the killers this man said the Hag 💀
---
It had to be that way.
---
I actually dont thing that last part is true, pretty sure I've had MoM save me from the down in aforementioned instances.
---
stop right there, criminal cum
---
Makes sense, I just want a killer that can hide in lockers
---
I'd rather have a horrible killer that disguises as survivors rather than a horrible killer that gives you a dumb status effect that makes you hold a button in some random corner of the map. **COUGH COUGH** *~~Legion~~* **COUGH COUGH** but other than that I can agree with your points.
---
That's clearly survivor sided. The survivors could see how intelligent their teammates are and dodge the lobby if need be.
---
Ok shut up now, you clearly win, you're the smartest person ever, no human should approach you and your intelligence, talking about stuff no one is talking about and trying to prove others wrong by changing the subject, congratulations and good luck on Harvard.
---
I just sat here and thought...
---
“Wow...”
---
So cute!! omg
---
I run the same build, but I've seen a lot of people run M&amp;A.
---
I know I'm a dumbass
---
I didn't post it on reddit because I didn't like how it turned out that much. You can see it on my steam artwork here -&gt; [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1727922922](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1727922922)
---
I'll definitly need to do her again. And thanks!
---
It’s okay my guy I relate
---
eheh, thanks!
---
Ranks are how your grouped together in a match, they totally matter. 4k should always be a pip, 3k + DC should always be a pip, anything after that grey.
---
Stupid that I have to get so many hookings just to pip up, sacrifice in one hook = bad, three hooks = good.....wtf not my fault they did not save them.
---
So what do we get? A level 8 killer trying to rank up that either gets 4 kills and pips up, or no kills and ranks down. Play 'nice' to try to rank up and get screwed, or go hard and still get screwed.
---
Seriously the devs need to rework killer and survivor rankings, I get a SWF immersion Claudette group that I can't hit more than once, but then I get a solo group that I get them all within 8 minutes, and I don't pip up regardless on either match, and somehow the SWF group is all rank 12 but they whooped my ass. 
---
Rank has to do a lot with how long you have played, but someone with 1500 hours and survives 80% of the time should never be allowed to pip down to rank 12. Ruins the game for new killers.
---
&gt;"Low Skill Noob Stomper that falls off against people who are actually good"
---
Sorry to say, but SWF doesn't automatically mean you're good. It just means you're on voice comms, which is flat out busted and OP with how this game is supposed to work.
---
I run BBQ, Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher and M&amp;A, but  I'm new at Legion I just finished leveling him, I started playing him when I got BBQ level 3 at level 50
---
Also, it's not only about getting new players, but more importantly keeping them. What an astonishing concept!
---
If it's not it's a bug, because the perk specifically says it only works if you're injured.
---
I've had MYC counter it (if the player's rage afterwards was any indication anyway), and Monto has been chainsawed and not had it work for him.
---
I feel like Bloodhound + Sloppy Butcher is a bit overkill.
---
Gotcha , thank you bud
---
Thank you.
---
A dead survivor already slows the game down by 1/4. You generally don’t need to slow the game down more once you start getting kills.
---
or make more spots like the macmillan behind the crates totem spawn
---
Clown is in a bad spot than doctor and LeatherFace, keep in mind that leatherface is a good killer in the open field with its chainsaw, it also depends on the area can be "deadly"
---
- The new legion.. would put it too in C beside: Trapper, Pig
---
- Clown would put it in C.
---
- Doctor in B, between Myers and Leatherface
---
- Pig would put it in D next to Freddy, but.. its right. and why D? because his RNG factor of his traps are sucks for her power ... it's a shame but that's the way it is.
---
That's what I think, the rest perfect.
---
I think any chance of escapig a mori would ruin moris
---
Damn, now it's a bummer that killer charms are gonna be on the hooks rather than killers themselves
---
The devs said they wanted it to be where you can't just be on your phone while in struggle, because it's meant to be, well, a struggle.
---
*Cut to me scrolling on Reddit on my phone while in struggle, because it only takes one hand to mash space or scroll the mouse wheel*
---
Always Meg or Dwight for me. Usually Dwight.
---
A permanent nerf to repairing and healing would be too overpowered, especially if the killer is camping or tunneled with a mori.
---
Just make it so failed skill checks knock off like 5 or 10 seconds off the timer instead of killing you. 
---
Also you don't always have to hold M1 to skill check. DS gives you a skill check without actually performing an action
---
Shirtless Jeff.
---
Imagine: huntress with barbecue AND iron maiden
---
It's annoying. No one likes quick time events and button masherd
---
*misfires during a fight with perry the platapus and accidentally shoots DC films, making them the horrible dumpster fires most of them are.*
---
Seriously! I played 4 matches for the first time since Legions launch. All 4 matches had a DC or 2. I dont understand.
---
Both great good and great evil must have humble beginnings, What is formed within is in the hand's of the Gods.
---
I think the survivor was just being a little shit for you ask me (I would have used the b-word but I don’t know if cussing is ok or not in this sub lol)
---
I have to debunk that myth you stated about the ‘big feet = big dick’ formula, it’s not true, Ik because I have big feet.
---
Well I know that productivity has increased dramatically over the last decades while wages have remained stagnant.
---
That cost of living adjusted for inflation has increased and minimum wage has decreased.
---
The way I see it, Legion's power wasn't meant for chases only.  
---
It was for tracking and injuring all the survivors in a short period of time.  
---
If the survivors are not healing - Legion's power is useless. Otherwise, Legion can waste a lot of their time by making them constantly heal.  
---
In chases Legion's power isn't that great, but the power has still got some uses. In my opinion, it is better than how it was previously - just hold W and swing until you hit someone. Then continue doing it, until they're down.
---
If that's the case, when they escape they get broken for the remainder of the match.
---
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them

yea that would have been dope

Minimum wage isn't always a good thing. It's a actually a cause for inflated prices
---
There is way more to it than just how much people get paid
---
The dude i actually killed never said anything but one of the other guys said he was playing with him and that he was pretty upset
---
Ghost is going to have more of a surprise playstyle like wraith Myers is more straightforward in attacking survivors I believe.
---
yeah something would need to ba done to balance it. I agree this solution may be plausible
---
At least you reached it before rank reset
---
What do you consider tunneling and how is that problematic versus any other killer?
---
Lol remember now. Legions motivation for killing is they’re feral teenagers who enjoy hurting people. Ghostfaces motivation is his girlfriend wouldn’t fuck him.
---
Gotta sleep sometime, a guy who has so much control over you and control dreams is pretty powerful

See ya all in rank 10 tomorrow!

Woosh me but is that actually possible?

I never thought I'd see something I hate more than Funk POP figures.

Idk what Claudettes you guys play with, every single one I see is a tryhard.

What if he wanted to but his parents forced him into a gap year

Yeah! Can't wait for it, rank 1 survivor and killer queue times are horrific

Wraith so 💗cute💗 when he isn't camping and tunnling me
---
You know, shit is a cuss word too 😂😂
---
It was your theory he’s faster.  He’s not.
---
I need Jeff to have a decent outfit too but I would appreciate the messy bun first
---
My eyes would be 90% pupil, not because Claudette is getting camped, but because someone was actually able to find a Claudette on cold wind
---
I run Spies from the Shadows, NOED, Iron Maiden, and Bitter Murmur, but I'm trash so what do I know?
---
Spirits prayer beads are fucking disgusting but yea capping huntress to one iridescent hatchet is good
---
Jake's with all toolboxes, bring that Franklin's too. Don't touch my damn hooks you assholes
---
They already nerfed it. Its fine as it, you just have to play against her differently than you do other killers.
---
Seen a few videos on it on YouTube, look around. A lot of good material out there.
---
Yeah prayer beads are also an add on that comes to mind when I think of overpowered add ons
---
I think they're fine, leave em as is. You win some and lose some
---
They don't want to encourage tunneling, I guess
---
Plus Moris and DCs would be even more annoying to deal with (for the 50%+ community that plays solo) 
---
Plus why would survivors even fear death? Aren't they trapped forever in the entity realm or something like that? 😂
---
when I a random while running No Mither save someone from the basement during NOED+EGC  and they flashlight click at me the whole way out
---
Feels good to play hero
---
Look at him! No one would have the heart to pallet slam something that cute.
---
But it's not supposed to affect the dead survivor it affects the remaining survivors numbnuts
---
The fuck did I do to trigger people?
---
Alright I see it now my bad.
---
Interesting. I'll do so, thanks for the heads up!
---
That's a healthy way to think about it
---
That happened to me last time I played DbD bit I was on PS4. No clue if there is a way to avoid it without just avoiding lockers entirely.
---
2 v 8 confirmed
---
I brought escape cake
---
So why exactly would a survivor ever stay in the game for 2 whole minutes after the gates have opened?
---
I wanna say all content is good content but what is changing for normal players? 
---
For killers the only real changes this big patch are probably going to be these: 
---
1) When both parties arrive at the hatch at the same time the killer can close it but unless you can hunt down the survivor, which is going to bolt straight for the open gate, you will still lose. Heavily favours killers that can 1 shot survivors.
---
2) After the last survivor is hooked and only 1 gate is opened I can open the second one for a measly 500 points. Hurray.
---
Oh yeah they also heavily nerfed Remember Me for no reason.
---
She’s slim thicc
---
Basically concentrating your attention on a specific survivor until they're dead for good. With other killers you can mindgame using loops, windows and pallets to at least buy you some time of break LOS at hide at best. You can's shake off old version of legion though if killer have decided you have to go down, Legion will stab you 4/3 times regardless. And breaking LOS is problematic because of all the mending stuff, it's time-sensitive and rather loud even with Iron Will.
---
Hope to hear about his rework soon!
---
I actually mostly play killer (especially lately) and I dislike the struggle mechanic from both sides.
---
In the games I play(ed) as survivor it was remarkably inconsistent, but binding it to Mwheel down fixed all my issues; which is really what survivors should do.
---
In my games as killers it just feels bad to see someone run up to save someone and that person lets go of the struggle prompt - they usually get run down for their troubles and suddenly their team is down two people (one dead, one hooked) due to how the game doesn't register the mashing correctly.
---
I mean the killer inside of me is glad a survivor is dead because the game goes by so fast, but it's still shitty to watch.
---
Okay, let me rephrase. Killing one survivor cuts their resources down by 1/4. There’s one less person to repair, heal, chase, unhook. There’s one less person for the killer to be aware of. Having one survivor dead already makes the game easier for the killer. I mean, why do so many people still run Ruin even though it gets so easily destroyed? Because slowing down the *beginning* of the game, when the survivors are at full strength, is the most important. You don’t need to add more pressure once survivors start dying because their deaths are typically pressure enough. Deaths help you to snowball. 
---
I guess if you you boil it down to pure time on gens then two survivors could finish all gens in about four minutes - 160 seconds each for the first four, then another 80 for the fifth. Except that that’s not how the game works unless the killer is literally afk.
---
Hmmm ... Well Decisive Strile and Breakdown, I guess? To be honest, tunneling is sort of out of your control though. Hope you are playing with people that will take a hit for you and run Borrowed Time?
---
It's pretty much all about coaxing out those hatchets while staying safe, and also learning when to drop pallets or vault on her. Hard to explain, and as I'm garbage at both playing and playing against her... not the person to advise. But lots out there!
---
Ruin &gt; Lullaby with 5 stacks. That is why people call it bad.
---
Add-ons: Cold Dirt, Stolen Sketch Book
---
Perks: Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, M&amp;A and Discordance
---
Play style: get most, if not all, survivors injured very early on and prevent them from healing. From there just play as a regular M1 killer, only using power to travel a long distance or if the survivors have healed eachother.
---
It's pretty decent for buying some time to place traps, but I'd more suggest it on doc
---
Hatchets inflict deep wound instead of instadown, maybe raise the hatchet cap to 2?
---
They should change the name to being about fear of blood or something, whatever that phobia is called.
---
It's a mixture of his semen and sweat.
---
Well yeah but, eventually you're dead because eventually you'll pass out from sleep deviation, so eventually Freddy isn't weak and eventually I'll stop saying eventually after I eventually get my point across that eventually Freddy will get you if he wants too and can't be defeated like Michael or Jason
---
The new ranking system should prevent the game from ending too early. It's not perfect but it's better than what we had before.
---
The name and comment checks out
---
When the mass hysteria started with all the shitty memes about Legion being "nerfed to oblivion" I said the changes were for good, and I got downvoted, mocked, insulted and even DMd.
---
They called me a madman.
---
&gt;Been said a billion times and I still don't know why it isn't in the game.
---
You are fucking kidding, right? "Too overpowered", my ass. It would only slow the actions by 4% per dead survivor which, in turn, slows the generator repair time (AKA the most affected one as it's the longest action) by 6.4 seconds. Plus, Dying Light already exists and does it's job much better then Thanatophobia.
---
when i said they tap you on the shoulder, you can pull Freddy out of the dream world, if they wake you up while you are fighting Freddy, he’s weaker than Michael, Jason, Ghostface, all because someone tapped your shoulder
---
The best would be DS, Dead Hard, Unbreakable &amp; Adrenaline in my opinion.
---
Ds stops you from being immediately hooked after being downed, punishing the killer with a 5-second stun.
---
Dead Hard allows you to be riskier when looping the killer. One of the best exhaustion perks in my opinion.
---
Unbreakable can be great if the killer slugs you to wait out your DS. Can just pick yourself back up. It also allows you to recover faster from the dying state. You could swap it with Mettle Of Man which would be more useful as it allows you to tank an extra hit but when adrenaline kicks off, you risk exposing yourself to the killer until you can escape the match meaning it provides them with a higher incentive to tunnel. Your choice though MOM is more versatile than unbreakable.
---
Adrenaline allows you to get a free heal &amp; escape the killer if in a chase in the end game. An amazing perk that will save your ass &amp; prepare you for the end game. Just hope that your teammates actually do objectives.
---
I was being sarcastic. I guess i should use /s just in case
---
hi its me your proof
---
Not saying make it as high as it was before but sightly higher then it is now.
---
No you won't get banned. Blood warden, save the best for last, agitation, bloodhound, huntress lullaby and rancor imo are pretty underrated
---
Check your mouse/keyboard is good. 
---
One of my mates used to die in struggle even though he was hitting the bar. Turns out his keyboard was a bit defunct and once he replaced it no more deaths unless he wanted to let himself go to the entity.
---
Its hard to tell. People literally defend rage quitting on here
---
unfortunately she only has like 5
---
Yeah I think blood warden is and I really want it but that means I have to get freddy level 40
---
&gt; I'm garbage at both playing and playing against her.
---
At least you were right about one thing in this dumb comment.
---
No, iri heads are NOT fine as it is. A huntress that actually has a brain will never will lose with iri head and and extra hatchets and you're a fucking idiot if you think there's counterplay to that.
---
You dc like the rest of baby survivors
---
Antitunneling builds just give the killer more motivation to tunnel you
---
There are two kinds of DBD players. Both are well represented in this thread
---
I remember it came in the shrine like a month and a half ago. If you have freddy I suggest just play with another killer and level up freddy if you don't want to play with him. Blood warden literally changed some games for me where I try a build from a 1k to a 3-4k
---
Honestly, it may be kind of a beginner's trap early gamr
---
WHO KNOWS
---
BETTER USE CAPS LOCKS TO GET EVERYONE ATENTION REGARDING A STUPID QUESTION
---
Looks dope
---
"95% of the killer base needs to play less effective killers so I can have more fun even at the cost of their own fun because I say so"
---
i played a game against a doctor on mt. ormond and he was camping. after he downed me he smacked me twice on a hook. fast forward to gens done and i open one gate, noed procs, only one surv dead and one is hooked. the other gets hooked too and dies. i try to open the gate but get rubberbanded, downed and slugged. the doc takes me to the hatch and puts me down, wiggle meter 50%. he keeps indicating that i go to the hatch but i know better. he closes it in my face and picks me up.
---
i wiggle out and sprint burst my Meg booteh out of there, denying him the 4k. was satysfing, because i can't count how many killers take you to the hatch only to close it in your face lol.
---
Well, McLean already said that will change this add-on in the future.  
---
As a response to your question, you need to use together with Iridescent Head an purple add-on ( Infantry Belt ) to make it viable at red ranks and again, you can still dodge 3 hatchets. I don't think it's so overpowered, especially when it's used just by baby Huntresses.
---
Tried my hand at another impulse animation! Constructive criticism will be greatly appreciated. Once Day 100 passes, I'll be focusing my time on 1-2 minute animations, both original and remakes from funny scenes. So, anything to change my shitty habits now would be cool!

I also barely get dcs when I play killer. But I also generally let all 4 escape so maybe its just cause the survivors recognize that im not there to make them hate life lol
---
Wanna show us your rank1 achievement? Oh right you dont have it
---
Feng Max
---
While I don't play as him, I found that most players still don't understand or even know his perks. So there is really no need to for him to change. You're still going to have two players working on one gen and Legion is still going to easily find them and down them.
---
My personal tier list :
---
1)Nurse
---
2/3)Billy/spirit (spirit is better against good survivors and Billy is better against decent or bad survivors)
---
4)Huntress
---
6)Myers
---
7) Plague
---
9)Pig
---
10)Wraith
---
11)Trapper
---
12)Leatherface

13)Doctor
---
14)Legion

15)freddy

Hope to hear about Freddy rework soon!
---
You're stupid if you actually think thats the icon
---
its a 50/50 if the killer fimnds the hatc first. Or you instead wait by the gates
---
Thanatophobia slows actions down by 4% per injured Survivor, for a maxium of 16% total slowdown.
---
1 Survivor repairing a generator, without any toolboxes or other modifiers, takes 80 seconds. 16% of 80 seconds is 12.8 (for convinence sake let's say 13) seconds. This is if **every** Survivor is injured.
---
Healing up one health state (Dying to Injured, Injured to Healthy) takes 16 seconds without items or perks. 16% of 16 seconds is 2.56 seconds, so two and a half seconds extra. Self Care takes twice as long which means self caring when **everyone** is injured takes a grand total of 5(.12) seconds extra, or 37 seconds as opposed to the usual 32.
---
Thanatophobia is fucking trash and it honestly astounds me that people think it's a good perk to run on Killers who can damage a lot of people. (Legion, Nurse, etc.) You're far better off running Sloppy Butcher to make Survivors heal 20% slower (19[.2] second heal, 38[.4] second self care) while also being easier to track regardless of how many Survivors are injured.
---
The only use of Thana is, ironically, the psychological use. Especially at low ranks Survivors will get spooked by the [**spooky red bar**](/intensifies) and will often make bad plays for the sake of getting rid of that **massive** 4% slowdown.
---
Well killer used to get penalties for traveling so you got to dribble.
---
Sexy shirtless Myers ftw!
---
Yeah when I close hatch with 5gens up then its their fault not mine. Old system they didnt even have a chance to escape that
---
How did you get hooked 3 times without dying on the third?
---
Slow the game down just a little bit more.
---
Chases do not take TR in count, only view distance and line of sight.
---
You dont have to fix a single gen now to get the hatch soo why should you even be able to get it
---
You just want an "gg ez" game
---
After MoM i would switch Nurse with Billy.
---
Michael for sure. I hate when I'm looking around and see him stalking me around corner or even worse, just hearing his muffled breath and not knowing where he is and then running into him. I  just feel hopeless when he keeps following me and stalking me.
---
I sometimes get jumpscared by Amanda when I don't know she's coming with an ambush and Hag's traps but she is not scary.
---
They wont trigger EAC.
---
EAC detects changes to the EXE not the changes to pictures in the folder.
---
It's this. If you're being repeatedly located, you're terrible in the stealth department. Personally I've never had this issue.
---
The worst thing is when you hear her lullaby in game with different killer or in real life lol.
---
Shit
---
Seriously boring music ans boring gameplay
---
Wow a 360 never seen that before
---
Oh it was three separate games that it happened where I pulled myself off.
---
You play much killer? Most games I play as killer the last person gets the hatch. If I want a chance for the 4k I usually have to slug someone and look for the last guy. It sucks crawling around the map but your only options are run unbreakable, try to find the hatch, or hide to deny the killer some points.
---
Who says he will be different? Its a dev build he can still change and might even be slower then pig
---
I have had the same issue with the struggle button getting me killed because it decided I wasn't pressing the button. Both with my keyboard and two different controllers. It's annoying as hell, especially with 'omg y u give up' teammates.
---
Yo fr tho. The worst is think you bamboozled a huntress only to slow vault out and find out they had iron maiden..scary times
---
Fucking beautiful. Absolutely beautiful
---
A kitty meme holy shit
---
Unbreakable, decisive strike, mettle of man, boil over/tenacity.
---
There have
---
You never expriences a decent swf team, but yea whatever kid
---
It’s freddy not doctor
---
Apparently deliverance users do not agree with you lmao, but what you said is right
---
Legion would be great with that
---
Like I said, salty.
---
And you're also foolish. I said that SWF doesn't inherently mean you're good, not that you can't be good *and* on SWF. My "experiences" also have nothing to do with it. Take your salty assumptions and name-calling elsewhere.
---
Since you wanna go there ebony moris are a thing too
---
Sometimes the survivors do that to 'salute' the killer. Maybe give just one bend or a nod.
---
I disagree. It requires missed skill checks and that simply isnt a thing with good players. Notification sound or not.
---
Additionally I am of the opinion that it's actually impossible to fix totem spawns unless you absolutely break them mechanically and power wise. Why? Because so long as totem spawns are static and typically in the corners of the map you will have those players who simply know where totems spawn due to playing a lot.
---
Memorizing typical spawn patterns is so simple when it comes to totems that unless they make it so its exceedingly hard to cleanse totems will always last a short time.
---
The only times totems last is when survivors dont know where they spawn which would require a lot more variation and when survivors cant communicate where the totem is to their buddies in optimal play.
---
Imma be rea with you i just main jake cause he looks cool
---
You overrated too much Myers, Legion and Cannibal. Especially without Ruin, Myers is hot garbage without Ruin and Cannibal is hot garbage without EndFury combo.
---
Theater mode for sure.

This ^
---
Depends on your rank.
---
If you're rank 20 not sure why, a high rank the que times are crazy long.
---
I almost never DC. Sometimes the game kicks me out (I've been seeing that bug where every survivor gets kicked from both sides frequently eventhough the ping is fine for both sides)
---
I DC if it's something like this: I was playing against a Billy, who chainsawed me from, not even top of the hill, when I was already down several steps away from it. Ok, I get hooked, salty, but blaming it on a possible ping spike. After I get unhooked he chases me and I loop him around a wall and he fricking teleports to the other side of the wall to me and I get downed. I closed the game, because a) I would've been dead on hook anyway b) other teammates were hooked c) I'm not going to lose my pip over some bs.
---
I never DC if it hurts my team or the killer.
---
Shirtless Jeff would be hairy Jeff. I'd be into that.
---
I would maybe search for joggers. They have a similar shape and style to that.
---
I think the list is pretty much on point. I’d prob have billy and spirit in their own tier tho as she both feel much better than the other 2.
---
Trapper is slightly hard to assess, he has a lot of snowball potential, but assuming he don’t snowball, he’s fine there. 
---
Rest seems ok. Legion is hard to assess due to all the recent changes
---
I believe that because that Jason is named Jason, lives in crystal lake and has a mother named Pamela they can't use him. All concepts from the first movie belong to victor miller while all concepts from 2 onwards belong to Cunningham.
---
I don’t think going for an item when a killer is afk is greedy.
---
How is he rank 21?
---
I would assume its to get BP (thats why I do) but if I'm comfortable enough I'll let them hit me on the edge. It starts and escapes a chase so its a pretty hefty bonus BP for almost no risk at all.
---
Yeah they increased pallet density in return for neutering most structures and windows.
---
Interesting survey, filled it out :)
---
I didn’t think about that, I had haddonfield in mind. I guess I’d have to come up with another idea if I wasn’t too lazy to do that.
---
Upvoted for the spooky red bar text.
---
That's his personal rank, not Killer rank.
---
When the exits are open yes it is... you're risking your life for an item.
---
Don’t, they looks stupid. Seriously.
---
That's it, thank you!
---
If you want to strictly math it out then thana doesnt look very useful on paper. But in real life application in a real game, 2 seconds of extra repair time can make or break a game. Every game goes differently so this will devolve into a lot of hypotheticals. Having thana has been the difference between survivors finishing a critical gen and ruining a chance for a 3 gen strat, and me getting there with pop goes the weasel to regress the gen. Then the added repair time from thana gets applied again as the survivors have to repair the regressed gen time. 
---
12 more seconds of gen time is 12 more opportunities for a ruin skill check to pop up and regress the gen further. 3 more seconds of heal time can be the difference between downing a still injured survivor being healed, and having to start a fresh chase on a healed survivor. Time is the most precious resource a killer has. Any perk that slows down the game, even slightly, gives you more opportunities to make plays that can snowball the game to a win.
---
Your argument is like saying ruin is bad, because there is a chance the survivors will find and cleanse it in the first 30 seconds. Every perk has a chance to not pay off and be useful in every game. There is a chance that the extra time that thana provides a killer doesnt pay off and you just get looped for the extra 30 seconds it bought you and lose. But there is also a chance that those extra 30 seconds let you get a down before adrenaline kicks in and the survivor gets away.
---
Thinking of using it for parkour :)
---
I *would* say that BHVR would have the foresight to add a floor to Terror Radius so it can't go below 0 and cause that exact thing....but this IS BHVR.
---
I don't blame you
---
Can you imagine having a trap on your head and being asleep with freddy's decreased action speed add on
---
oink oink
---
That's his player level not rank.
---
Outstanding move!
---
Please do not
---
Its 50/50 of who finds the hatch. You wait there so when the killer closes the hatch you can get a headstart on opening it since the killer is looking for the hatch
---
I only lost 1 pip though, so I don't think it was me
---
The greatest feeling is when you save that taunting player for last while the other players have wasted so many pallets that they could run to.
---
Decisive strike, unbreakable, mettle of man, your choice exhaustion perk
---
Do you have anything stating as such, as the most recent thing i could find from a dev is this post from the community manager https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1693795812299277499/ which implies the EAC may detect them
---
Yeah I suppose but it’s one of those meh cuss words lol

??? You can't open the gates while dying....

It’s a good thing you were playing the PLAG
---
This is why I don't hit "ready" until I see all 4 survivors in the lobby. If it's a two-killer game, the 4th survivor won't appear in the lobby.  So basically, if there's less than 4 survivors, and the countdown to the game has started, it means someone is in there as a second killer.
---
No one said it was social media. We didnt really have that in the same era. It was like the 90s. Myspace was out in the early 2000s
---
Unless you can open the hatch once it's been closed? :S
---
No direct report from the developers but i am a community officer for the game Paladins which uses the exact same anti cheat and i can tell you it will detect things that directly mess with the EXE.
---
in addition to this i have been using custom icons for months with no issue.
---
No that doesnt make the game easy enough for survivors.
---
Maybe something like evolve had where it tracks everyone's locations across the map and shows it all in the end screen, with icons for gens, pallets, hooks, gates and whatnot.
---
Great now I Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Fat bastard in the game, the twist though? They're all killers not survivors.
---
That’s not greed at all Lmaoo
---
3K ...deppip
---
Thanks, that's good enough for me. Off to install some now.
---
I think a multi killer could work like Legion. Just because you play Legion as a multi killer doesn’t necessarily mean every killer needs to be present on the map.
---
I don’t see why each killer couldn’t have a different ability and you could swap to each of them as you please. Just have them spawn and despawn at a preset location.
---
Its great 👍🏾
---
Why would they bother trying to escape over and over if they could just let themselves die and go back to the campfire
---
I'd love for a play again lobby. Sometimes me and other randoms just synergize so well. I'm sure we could conquer a lot of killers but instead I get matched with potatoes.
---
I sometimes let the timer go but I never slug them, I chase them around (very poorly so they stay ahead) so we both get points and the timer goes fast. I don’t get why you would slug for it, it’s a waste of time, not interesting, and rather toxic just to slug for 4 minutes.
---
I will actually play Legion now but I don’t see his ability as all that strong. Definitely an improvement but not the best solution.
---
I'd like to recommend the sky pack
---

---
The other day I was up against a Pig, and the fucker wouldn’t stop tea bagging me. They teabagged me for maybe 20 minutes until they finally picked me up and hooked me. Awful.
---
But she said to play fair!
---
I know, but is not supposed to appear Double pallets, especially on a jungle gym
---
I did this the other night as killer but it was 1 gen and 1 guy. My internet cut out.
---
I loved that about Evolve. It would be cool, too, seeing as the maps aren’t as big and then the killer could see if they miss survivors a lot (ex if killer is gen camping and can’t find a hiding survivor, later in the relay he could see the dots for the survivors and where they had been). It would be neat!
---
they can do the same that they did with ghostface, get a similar mask strong guy called something similar with Jason
---
Because I know that finding another game will take 20 minutes so I savor every last bit of gameplay I possibly can lol
---
The identity matches I play are super easy. They have a ton of potato players.
---
Right but he's using a smartphone, no? Like a smartphone you usually see nowadays?
---
You’re right, his map pressure is among some of the worst in the game. Even with 115 movement speed it still seems like he has a hard time getting from place to place
---
Hard to run in and vault pants.
---
But it's a ps4 exclusive because Sony is Sony.
---
I’ve got so many hours on this game and I still manage to fuck up skill checks in some matches. My boyfriend hits great skill checks consistently and I don’t know how he does it because when I try to hit a great I almost always miss it.
---
16-20 is its own bracket. Once you get to rank 15, you’ll be in the que with everyone else and have shorter wait times.
---
Noooo. Didnt you check out the mori? It's a blue flip phone with a pull out antenna. The newer flip phones in 2000 would let you get on facebook but the era with pull up antennas did not.

Pretty sure MC Hammer wore this.

Swag 😎
---
Some of them want to let you have a free hit for more points + get points for getting into a chase &amp; some boldness.
---
Also if some of the survivors are injured, hitting any of them will give the other survivors WGLF stacks if they are running it :D
---
If they don't let you hit them then there is a chance they are making sure they occupy as much of your time as possible, so that their other teammates have more time to get out if they are opening a door/looking for hatch/need to take off a Pig trap, etc.
---
This happens to me so much omg 😂
---
and the link to buy is... where? &gt;.&gt;
---
What's the logic. He sees me working on a gen and hes like hehehe cant hook us if we have no hook here. So they notify the killer then right around the next time is a hook. Now if they followed up and broke the next hook then maybe.
---
I haven't even thought of that, but I can definitely see this reasoning as valid, haha
---
I retract my statement then, *hardcore parkour!* my bodies to broken to participate in such shenanigans, be safe friend.
---
*Dying light would like a word*
---
Honestly if you use a ebony and kill more than one person you made it useful. I dont like ebony Moris though because I use them asap and I dont pip. If I don't use it asap I risk wasting it.
---
Should have just cleansed the dull totems
---
I feel like it should be killer sided. If the killer beats your whole team you have that last gasp to try and escape but it shouldn't be a guarantee like it was in the past. It essentially punishes the killer for doing well.
---
Has bhvr said anything about implement a 2v8 mode? It would be so fun honestly
---
I see, that makes sense. Thank you!
---
Reminder to enable 2-factor authentication on accounts you care about such as Reddit.
---
Can we just nerf Nurse already so we can talk about nerfing Billy? :)
---
what if it was both freddy and doctor?
---
I don't get this reasoning, DS and BT are there in case you get tunneled. MoM isn't really a tunneling related perk, it's good in any situation outside of Plague/Legion/Good Billy/Huntress/Nurse.
---
It doesn't make it more likely they will tunnel you, they are already tunneling you if you got to use them.
---
I dont know why this is a prevalent ideology among people who only play survivor. Most killers do not want your extra hit. It's worth a paltry amount of points for being forced to watch as they just escape anyway with no extra kills.
---
I'm currently looking into how that would work. Post office prices etc... I'll make another post, or get in contact with anyone that seemed interest if I do go foward with it.
---
Anyone else better at hitting aid skillchecks over generator skillchecks? I could get 80% greats on first aid and 10% greats on generators. The generator check feels like its shaky or low fps or something.
---
DS+DH+BT+ whatever. Don’t know why more survivors don’t run BT, it’s such a solid perk.
---
Not only is this a good anti tunneling build, it’s also good for when survivors accidentally farm each other. BTW, make sure you know the difference between those two before you give your killer shit.
---
Well, if they confirmed it.
---
Also, the slaughters are from TCM 3
---
Thank you very much! ♥️
---
Lmao
---
That’s right. It’s a razer. Had a Corsair befor but sadly, the leds broken really fast (without a reason..) :(
---
Yes. Was hiding from the killer and the , I can’t go out.
---
Oh. That wouldn't be that bad. Youd surely miss one of those crazy skill checks to wake up.
---
Who? If anything the next survivor should be Sydney Prescott since Ghostface is the next killer
---
*Disney Presents:*
---
The lil'est Bing Bong.
---
SHIT, I didn't mean to give Disney any ideas!!
---
Anyone that thinks this build is OP is a newb and you should ignore their opinion. Pretty sure you can like depip off a 4k.
---
what about freddy, doctor, and pig all at once?
---
Time to spend my evening colouring it!
---
Edit: Amazing job it looks great! :)
---
I DM'ed you, i have a few things that you might like
---
make the killer waste time to force them out, if not all ur teammates are there or something you don’t want to leave you either have the killer waste time or they regret leaving you be
---
I used to get fucked when I had it bound to spacebar, but I changed it to F and it hasn't happened since.
---
I fucking love it
---
Since he’s a 115 killer with an aggressive playstyle, I’ll just use the meta build: SF/Enduring/BBQ/Ruin. If you don’t care about BPs, I’d personally use bamboozle over BBQ.
---
My boyfriend told me it was a smartphone lol. He's dumb
---
Basically Micheal but can only 1 hit one person so yeah mid tier definitely he can also peek corners and crouch. Don't think he'll be top tier.
---
The tunneling and camping have been so bad lately. I feel like every game I play has a killer who is either face camping or tunneling off hook. And the thing is even if I’m playing good enough to not get caught it still makes the game incredibly boring and I get almost zero altruism points because I can’t hook save.
---
Tombstone piece + J. Myers Memorial &gt; Tombstone + tuft of hair.
---
There is nothing less interactive than not seeing the killer for the first 2 minutes of the match and then getting morid the moment you actually have a chase.
---
happend to me today. It was so god damn funny
---
My argument is why damage every Survivor for 4 seconds of game stall when you can run Sloppy Butcher for 10 seconds of game stall? The problem is not that Thana is *bad* so much as everything else is objectively better. Instead of slowing the game down by half a second with Thana I'd rather speed it up with Brutal Strength, Spirit Fury, and Enduring. Or I could have an end game contingency with NOED, Bloodwarden, or Remember Me.
---
Given the context that I could use *every* perk I'd gladly take Thana, along with Overwhelming Presence, Beast of Prey, Monsterous Shrine, and all the other "low tier" perks. But given that I only have four perk slots I'd rather a perk that speeds me up by 20% or slows Survivors down by 20%, as opposed to one that slows them down by 4%.
---
Now it's because Legions need standard m1 killer builds which makes it even more boring to versus and play
---
Amen
---
/intensifies
---
This perk is garbage. Not sure why it’s so popular.
---
Yeah, they don't want to make new rigs that'll only work for one killer, but the reason they'd have to make new rigs is because he's too short.
---
They made it so there's a minimal amount of pallets. when the map generates and it finds that there aren't enough pallets it spawns those things out of my nightmares
---
I mean you can depip off of a 4k with anyone rn if you are around red ranks thanks to the emblems changes.
---
Plus I just do it because it's worth a good amount of points. Plus if I end up dying I "contributed" to the team in the case they run noed.
---
Really, I had no idea of that. Where did the devs confirm this?
---
I know this can happen with nuke Gandhi in the civ franchise, but I don't recall this ever happening in DbD. (Micheal can achieve a -2 terror radius with EW 1 and M&amp;M, so I don't think it's super likely to happen)
---
he really wanted that hug didn't he? xD
---
Happened to me last night, when I was messing around on LF. Didn't mean to make someone DC, but they did. But I got punished for my deed by this sound.
---
Impure thoughts
---
You did it again, fantastic work
---
I would quit DBD if they added her over Sidney.. or Randy.. Or Dewey.. Or Gale.. Or literally any other character from Scream movies or even the first two seasons of the MTV series
---
I would also assume perspective or POV matters in this
---
In no way are they fine, Any insta down Add-on needs nerfs, without question, While i do think Clowns is more powerful (Bc clown is way easier to insta down with) They both need nerfs
---
The tombstone piece is definitely more powerful, I don't like using it for the reasons you've stated.
---
It feels so bad for that first guy. Meanwhile the Judith's + tuft can spread the love to everyone.
---
My point is that I get an hour of playtime a day, and I’m not gonna waste my time on the chance that LF might be good.
---
Dont care. Everything I said is true
---
So Clown must seem fast as fuck to some people because of his thickness?
---
I mean, it wouldn't be only one killer because they could do their own along with Sam and Chucky, but I do suppose that it is true that the new animations are technically because they're too short.
---
I did this earlier while injured with MoM active and got a Claudette off the hook. She didn’t manage to get out though :(
---
If 2 v 8 was a thing then Freddy and Doc would be a bad combo since your gonna get out of the dream world every 30 seconds
---
it’s all muscle memory the more you play the easier it will get without even trying
---
Saying something is balanced because you can counter it when its used by a bad player is one of the worst arguments i have ever heard
---
The "level of evil" was just an aggression score on how likely any Civ was to declare war and such. Once you got the democracy diplomacy, your aggression score was reduced by 2, which rolled his aggression to 255, the highest in the game.
---
While his terror radius could roll over, it's unlikely since EW1 Myers has a -2 terror radius with M&amp;A
---
If you have sat for more than 10 minutes, remake the lobby. I usually remake after 5 minutes, but 10 is safe to assume you have a bugged lobby.
---
I mean if they’re gonna tunnel you anyway might aswell make it hell for them even if you die
---
But seriously how the fuck does an 80-90 year old asthmatic fatass power walk faster than young teens who run for an occupation
---
You can use that to your advantage and take off her map pressure by forcing her to end whatever she's doing and save her totems
---
Your title is very confusing
---
No they ain't.
---
Vilmer, WE and Darla Slaughter are all from TCM 4.
---
https://texaschainsawmassacre.fandom.com/wiki/Darla_Slaughter
---
He just trips over it. Very slowly rolling after the trip with a second to push himself up.
---
Pig makeup? Make it seem like she painted a pig face on using blood and her fingers and the sets(if it’s a set) body could show that her fingers are stained red.
---
An interesting style, very different from what everyone else does.
---
Very nice.
---
You're right, but I think the counters I've listed are pretty esoteric. I only recently learned about the stair trick.
---
I almost always depip even with a 4k. And the BP gains are pretty bad. It's just for fun, especially with Tinkerer.
---
If they are tunneling you in the first place then they would be camping the hook &amp; tunneling you later anyway.
---
DS will at least let you occupy their time for longer/let you escape them in some situations.
---
Nice
---
I have a rule for myself that I try to avoid using the stuff I hate going against, otherwise I feel like a lil bit of a hypocrite, haha.
---
For example you'll never see me using MoM, Instaheals, Prayer beads or instasaw, etc.
---
That's just me tho!
---
FENGARU
---
Because clown takes his finger gummy vitamins everyday
---
In summary the pipping system sucks
---
That guy is a cunt
---
You want a killer better that nurse? FINE! His only iridescent addon makes him able to see while all his others give him temp vision!
---
This is truly an epic gamer moment
---
It's called afk downranking.
---
Save The Best For Last is great on Legion. Ignoring the Obsession, it gives you a reason to 2hit people with your power, at 8 tokens it drastically reduces your stun from Frenzy and all successful hits. God tier on new legion imo.
---
TLDW: Too laggy, didnt watch
---
Is it? I guess people draw her more conventionally attractive. 
---
Thank you so much! (I love your work so much)
---
You joke but I’ve been wanting a Killer whose power would prevent survivors from looking at them. Maybe cause the screen to become blurrier and blurrier until the survivor takes damage.
---
If I'm correct this is on xbox, I play xbox too and after the EGC update queue times have been much longer...
---
&gt; because i can't count how many killers take you to the hatch only to close it in your face lol.
---
literally every killer after the EGC patch.
---
Yep on Xbox
---
You run fast, hit someone and that person DCs,
---
, then everyone else DCs too, wait... That's the old one, no wait, it still happens
---
1. Killer Balance is only marginally better than before due to the decisive rework. There seems to still be a lot of pallets per map and strong defensive setups plus a new perk that is like decisive light. Mettle of Man really hurts any killer who is in the mid or lower tier because it's so universal due to the requirement of only needing to get hit. According to many the Sounds are also messed up again so if you were able to pick up on them before now it's very difficult to.
---
2. Survivor wise I would say the game is looking pretty strong. You have a lot of options for gameplay plus decisive makes it so you really cant be downed after getting unhooked. Borrowed has been buffed a ton due to legion and mettle of man is now a thing. The worst thing you have to deal with is bad teammates so it's nothing that's any different than before.
---
3. On Plague. Plague during ptb was questionably high mid low high tier and was like an alternative version of huntress. However due to the nerfs given to her on release she is now mid low or low tier because a lot of what she can achieve can honestly just be better done by huntress. Its really hard to chase around loops with the vile purge charged and it is now inefficient to charge it until you're in the survivor's face. And then you're better off with quick short sharges rather than a long one to give less time to avoid it. Add to this that while she is a monster with corrupt purge, survivors are ultimately responsible whether or not you get it and can cleanse at pools that are far away forcing you to waste time to get them.
---
The tl:dr is...I cant see why you would not just play huntress instead.
---
Didn't they say that they will punish all leavers for leaving too much? Acording to leavers amount every game, they do not get anything for it.
---
I like playing the new legion it feels balanced and isn't bullshit to play against
---
I expect stuff like this from this sub tbh .
---
Considering MoM and BL suck, BT is almost necessary to save people and Adrenaline is hit or miss, it'd be fine
---
False
---
Hey i'll take all the points I can get no matter what side I play
---
Well she does have a bright pink jacket.
---
Maybe because dead survivor can't fear the death, he's already dead
---
Imagine a meatplant rework where it's just the chum bucket lmao
---
im obviously joking about how F13 is tied up in court
---
What I don't like about Moris is that it basically has no counterplay besides "just don't get hooked once 4Head " 
---
But the animations are cool I hope they don't remove it
---
but yes with disney at the helm i dont foresee a lawsuit and if so theyd win it, they own the world with microsoft, they share
---
Still invisible because the entity blessed us killers with cornvision and general blindness no matter how bright our screens are
---
It will get better, be selfish and only look out for yourself until rank 10 or so.
---
All exhaustion perks pretty much suck for me since I don't loop, which is also why MoM is bad for me
---
Id buy him right away
---
Nurse indeed takes very little skill if the survivor keeps running in a straight line out in the open.
---
Break line of sight as much as you can, and move unpredictably. The Nurse can’t blink to your exact location if she doesn’t see you, unless she accurately predicts your movement, in which case you need to move unpredictably.
---
I have a few hundred hours on Nurse, and I’ve used this tactic on many Nurses, whether it’s a pro Nurse or a noob Nurse - This works to prevent yourself from going down immediately. She’s all mindgames, she is a very strong killer if played correctly but she is definitely not uncounterable.
---
HELLO HELLO HELLO CHRISTINE.
---
FREDDY'S NOT JUST A NORMAL DAD.
---
HE'S A COOL DAD.
---
5 games is nothing. Just move on to the next game hoping for something better.  
---
Sure, your teammates can be dogshit, but that happens in ever rank.  
---
Getting to higher ranks gets really easy once you actually get better at running specific tiles and knowing how to use two or more loops in combination.  
---
Generally, rank doesn't matter. I would however, say that brown and yellow ranks are for newer players, and from green to red is just the usual bad players with a very small group of good players.  
---
That's the same for both killer and survivor.
---
Point point tea tea tea follow point???? Point?
---
Where can I buy one
---
Yeah there is, it even uses the steam profile pics as the pointer for each player
---
Absolutely not. Doing **anything** allowed by the rules of the game (that is not an exploit) is not, itself, toxic. It is the intent. Even facecamping could not be toxic if it is just someone who literally just got the game and doesn't know any better and thinks they have to guard the hook. If you're not going out of your way to BM, you're not being toxic.
---
Why should I?  
---
I only care about OoO if I play Huntress, because I can't hit any long-range shots on the survivor that's running it.
---
And im tired of seeing 50 million posts about this. Its irratiting. It will wear off once its less new, and its not likle survivors didnt do this shit either
---
It doesn't make sense for others to not fear death tho as they are still alive.
---
Wrong look at it from the other side.  Being kept on the ground so a killer can fuck around is a disrespectful waste of their time.  Just hook them and accept your victory so everyone can requeue.
---
*jazz music stops*
---
ahh ok, Kinda funny seeing 2 killers, but also Scary tho.
---
I find them to usually be toxic or your best friend who helps you kill, if its the former than I just ignore em and go for their buddies
---
The question is whether or not other survivors ran MoM.  
---
Dealing with one isn't that bad in my opinion, but more than that and it's pretty tough for any killer that can't injure with their M2 ability.
---
No I don't see using any perk besides old ds toxic.
---
Anything else is fair play to me tho I do see people hate on noed which o really don't see the problem with
---
Literally cripples anyone who isnt using a chainsaw imo. I would much rather deal with old ds than this bullshit
---
Is the killer complaining that the survivor is using a build they enjoy? Call the wambulance.
---
Cute.
---
Ohhhh Slenderman.
---
It's the principle of the thing for some people.  Slugging feels disrespectful to the opponents time.  I wouldn't dc over 12 seconds for sure unless that killer played like camping filth or something.  But if you slug much longer than that simply to see an animation you're an asshole.
---
Really ? I’m amazed no one else has discovered this considering how popular the puppet is.
---
This gives me a feeling so complicated
---
Ugh I hate tank builds as a killer, there shouldnt be that many killer denial perks
---
1) Survivors ragequit a lot so... Plenty of 4k I guess, also the new EGC usually ends up with the killer winning (when there's o ly 1 survivor left) depending on the exit gates location
---
2) Many survivors ragequit so you end up with 5 gens to do and only 3 people, you will most likely escape via hatch, rarely you' ll get a match with no crybabies
---
3) Nobody uses her and when they do it's either a tunneler or everyone escapes
---
Were you AKF with insidious?
---
I assume you don't mean release DS?  
---
If so, I agree.
---
some players still do it, dunno why 'cause they put themselves at risk (even if they try to be friendly and let survivors do whatever they want)
---
After F13 was the biggest waste of money I've ever seen, I'm not going to be buying anything that Illfonic or Gun Media produce, no matter what. I lost trust in those two companys.
---
You can say this for both sides on every Salt/Rant, Suggestion or even Discussion post on this sub.
---
Insta down addons I can understand. They should be more regulated. Mori's for me, are fine.
---
If you're 1 hooking your survivors you don't deserve to pip.  1 hooks means you are almost assuredly camping or hard proxycamping your kills.
---
I love the two killer thing. Can they make it like an unranked optional meme mode?
---
Everyone got MoM and left to their main :)
---
You're right. It's the one thing I prefer about reddit over fb groups. Drama stays in 1 thread. That's it.
---
Discordance , bloodhound , monitor and abuse and fire up
---
I really like perks that can really fuck over the survivors without me putting in any effort. Fire up so that every time they complete an objective I become stronger. Monitor to have the terror radius closer to what it was. Bloodhound to make up for the broken scratch marks and to never lose the survivors in a chase. And discordance coz for some reason my legion bloodweb will not let me have surveillance on them
---
As a killer main, this would hurt a lot more than the hook going through your chest...
---
I'll try this. I'm about being the hero but I'm not ranking up like I should.
---
Wrong :)
---
As a killer main getting to green rank is fun and really not that hard, even purple ranks are not that hard. Right now i'm rank 6 killer and rank 7 survivor. Ranking system in DBD is bad, you will rank up if you play more. NOED is perk that killers can use, usually playing as survivor i'm just assuming that he runs it so i destroy all the totems (playing solo), it's easier to find them if you play both sides so you know where totems spawns. Camping is shit of a strategy but you just need to rush campers nothing to do more with it. Playing solo survivor is harder than SWF cuz randoms don't know where is killer and when to do things. Getting to rank 1 as survivor is easy when playing SWF as a team you can play more efficient. Campers are on all ranks. Good luck in your future games.
---
No wonder he is banned tbh
---
I bought it up with people I play with and they just told me to get good and stop being a scrub.
---
Watch it nub
---
We love Goose.
---
Because a female doctor can be called a nurse. And m&amp;a is doctors perk. Makes sense with the point you're using
---
There are so many cursed Feng screen caps now lol
---
You cant be scared of death if you're dead.
---
You should get a new mouse  homie
---
Oink!
---
Real QT c:
---
More like David Productions, amiright?
---
Are there more colors? What determines which color you get?
---
I like the blue fur c:
---
Oh god you can't possibly waste a few seconds cause your time is that precious. Keep crying kid...
---
If they're in a SWF group and they're constantly calling where you are, yes, otherwise no
---
Same. If a player is better than you, you should get spanked.  Seems like people find that’s a hard concept to grasp.
---
The punishment is fitting.  Pallet wasters are the survivor equivalent of facecampers.  I love watching their useless asses get 1 hooked.
---
Glad you enjoy it! i wanted to do black but it just looked messy.
---
No, they do not have the perks equipped as seen from the bottom right
---
Wrong?
---
Comment checks out
---
MoM is situational, you need to get it stacked before it's able to be used. Old DS was annoying when it was hidden, the obsession one was anticipated, but the worst thing were the ones you needed to wiggle to use.
---
If I’m not the last survivor I’ll make the killer come to the gate to give other survivors more time
---
And dying light will be reworked because right now it is a tunneling perk. Thanatophobia was buffed to 24% but because of Legion remained the same. It will be buffed again probably.
---
#sad oink
---
We Stan Minnie
---
Classic
---
Indeed it is. It's always on the 13th of the month!
---
oink oink oink oink oink, oink oink oink oink oink
---
by which i mean i wish i had perks on Amanda so that i could play her more and not play Legion because legion bad even though they've been nerfed into the ground apparently
---
god damnit this game makes me feel bad no matter what i do, its so cursed
---
Really great when my PC drops a couple frames (out of my normal 100+) for just a moment because someone sent me a message on discord and the game decides that's justification to fail my struggling.
---
I'm tired of getting baby teammates at rank 15, so I would appreciate ranking up. Its fucking impossible tho.
---
*yOINKs you out of a gen*
---
Fuuuck I hope he doesn't catch Kate, he gonna split her in half. 😥
---
Not to be mean but its you. Accept it and improve. Playing naturally i hit purple and red. You NEED to be able to loop a killer. Like period. No mess ups. Sure sometimes you last minutes, sometimes 20 seconds but you should never go down in 5.
---
I too have big feet but my clonker is like the size of a pencil sharpener
---
You said a minute.  Leaving someone slugged that long is incredibly inconsiderate and pointless.  Get over yourself entitled killer that thinks it's cool to selfishly waste a players time so you can watch an animation.  All I'm asking for is you to accept your victory and hook me so I can requeue.  I play a lot of killer and would never pull that selfish shit.  Have some consideration for your opponents.
---
MoM and adrenaline together are tough. MoM by itself it's that bad unless you have 4 people running it.
---
yeah that's why I don't bother using flashlights hopefully it's being fixed
---
Or you could just run in one direction and then change your direction so she walks the wrong way
---
"Just one"
---
Adrenaline, ds, mettle, plus friend had borrowed time
---
Yes, wrong!
---
We don't even have bunny Feng yet
---
Why sad D:
---
I do it to possibly block a hit for a dude
---
But how? How am I wrong about announcing my preference?
---
You could also do this with Doctor in shock mode and I think Billy while charging is chainsaw. I know I've seen a video of Monto grabbing people off hook in treatment mode.
---
Shoulda' known went to fold 'em
---
Its really easy to pip as survivor but you need to actually play to pip instead of playing to escape... This TydeTyme video is pretty informative on the system although its a little bit old so it may have minor things wrong. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XOZNWhI6FM
---
  Also you won't pip or have fun at all if you keep having that mentality, who gives a fuck if a killer has NOED? You can't expect people to be decent at rank 15, I'm going to say this you're also not decent if you're stuck there. 
---
Camping is pretty shitty for you but at least you can have the satisfaction that its shitty for the killer as well.
---
DS - Don't tunnel  
---
Borrowed Time - Don't tunnel  
---
Mettle - BS.  
---
Adrenaline - Learn to put out pressure.
---
Yeah hatch takes way too long to open
---
You can use add ons known as apples to activate up to 2 fountains at the start of the match if you really want to get the ranged attack.
---
That being said, you'll find a lot of teams clensing against you, a large number of players is still really scared of doing anything while injured so you will get full use out of your power in a lot of games. Even at red ranks you won't meet good players that often, and 1 bad teammate clensing can swing the match in your favour.
---
Plague's snowball potential is really high, you can sometimes get some pog moments like [this one](https://clips.twitch.tv/UnusualFurtiveCoffeeTakeNRG) I got while playing as her a while ago.
---
Without clensing she's effectively infinite tier 3 myers, but her instadown status gets charged MUCH faster, she's still pretty good imo.
---
Sad but true
---
there are those two, you can simply equip them
---
I've never considered changing how my perks look before...
---
Now I'm considering it.
---
I'm still debating buying Ashy Slashy
---
I would've said nurses calling but that works too
---
No one mains Ash.  
---
  
---
(I was joking, if it wasn't obvious enough.)
---
Imagine dudes mom flipping you off for hooking her. That's a heartbreaker.
---
Apparently you can't read, you're already going to take some time to hook the guy so its not a full minute, also a minute is a few seconds... just count to 60.
---
I don't particularly care if you enjoy it or not, I for once don't enjoy a bunch of stuff you may or may not do, either way you're free to DC and lose your points or watch the animation with me.
---
Wait so if one killer DCs and the other doesn't the match continues, right?
---
nerfs :,(
---
o n k
---
So uh. Yeah. Source please? 
---
Just out of curiosity.
---
Lullabye is alright if you pressure like a god early but my gripe with hex totems is how their use is completely null to an unlucky spawn, small game, or an aware/lucky survivor
---
People calling no ed broken meanwhile they're running adrenaline and mettle. Killers with mobility and traps like spirit, trapper, hag, Billy and nurse can utilize the rotations better but the rng feels way too weighted against killer sometimes to make use of a chunk of hexes.
---
yea that would totaly be amazing to have!
---
Why would you ever run a perk that only offers + 2 seconds 2 generator completion time over literally any other perk that Killers could use? No one is saying there aren't very specific situations in which thanatophobia could be useful, but people are saying those situations are never worth wasting a perk slot on shitty thanatophobia
---
These are questions you really should just be asking BHVR staff. Maybe someone on here might have gone through this before but they most likely handle things on a case-by-case basis so their advice may very well not apply to your situation.
---
Says the person that cant win without swf rofl
---
I’m in no way excusing their language, it’s appalling, however based on their bloodpoints it looks like you probably camped/tunnelled them into oblivion. People who play this game ooze toxicity even if you play fair so anything more than that and it tends to not end well.
---
they should be able to unban at least I've seen huge streamers and YouTubers using it!
---
WAS THE NERF NOT ENOUGH?!

But how will you feel fear of death if you are fucking dead. Its ok, if u are injured or in a fucking hook death is near ao you are scared as fuk

Thank you, appreciate it

I play killer but whatever you want to believe, bud.
---
I know, i know... But the hope dies at last

Audrey II as the killer, Seymour as the survivor, Skid Row as the map!

Except the effects of the perk are only on living survivors. What would make them more afraid of death? They're buddies getting maimed? Or their friends literally dying around them? The threat of death being a possibility is much more intense when people you know are literally dying around you.
---
id give suggestions if the problem was the numbers or effects could be tweaked to make them better. but them problem is your perks are inherently weak and not worth a slot
---
[x] Doubt.
---
You wouldn't be banned for only "colored icons" 
---
You clearly did something else that the anti cheat didn't like.
---
In addition it is applied directly by the developer, meaning you probably got caught cheating.
---
Sorry lad, experience outweighs emotions.
---
True. However you can’t control peoples language just because most people don’t agree with it. He played dirty and got a dirty response and now he’s trying to play the victim.  Downvotes deserved.
---
Imagine still defending nurse in 2019
---
No side of the story excuses them for what they said, no matter how infuriating of a player they were.
---
I can't for the life of me think of what EGC is. Can someone jog my memory?
---
You're lying. Nobody in YEARS has been banned for using custom icons. Lying wont fix anything. Enjoy your ban.
---
I agree they should be able too, but I wouldn't rely on them to use common sense over something so trivial. And I'm not sure how the big streamers and youtubers get away with it so well, perhaps a special program that tricks the EAC into thinking its the normal files? Not sure am on Xbox and I'm sure I'm lucky that the game is even available on this console.
---
The effects of thanatophobia are on the living survivors though. Dead survivors aren't affected by thanatophobia.
---
That should have been a default action for Ash regardless.
---
Lmao brilliant counterplay

I can't comprehend how you are that blind. Said multiple times it would be better if it wasn't the case but also said multiple times its stupid to think it should be priority over several other issues this game has which are actually critical and impact way more
---
That doesn't mean you have to be rude if you don't like them.
---
why the hell would I lie lmao I don't understand why I would lie about "cheating" and rant here when I know I wouldn't be unbanned
---
Rank reset tomorrow.
---
This concept doesn't just apply to Nurse. It applies to every other killer who defends their totems. They often lose because they need to accomplish a third objective. Just because Nurse can avoid every obstacle a survivor could use to slow the killer down does not mean every Nurse you encounter can do that
---
Yeah...
---
huh i didn't know that was a thing sweet I guess

---
Here is a little explanation of pipping and ranking in the new system.
---
Chase. The more chase and survivor found points, the better. 
---
Gen patrol and prevention. I find that the longer I can keep them above the 3 gen left, the more chance I have of a pip.
---
Hits. The more hits you do, and the more they heal, the better.
---
Hooks. If people die first hook, or mori after first hook, then you are losing out on the hooking side of the points.
---
Base requirements for a higher rank to get a pip is 8 and 1 kill, so long as you are also breaking gens, pallets, and chasing people. The more you let a survivor do in the beginning of the game decides the fate of the game points overall. Being near a survivor on the hook also slowly eats away at your pip.
---
The devs explained it as a push/pull system, if you are rushing to kill survivors, you lose points, if they rush to do gens, they lose points. The more everyone does in the game, the better the odds everyone pips.
---
Switch is looking great
---
This is really useful yeah

---
At least one thing we can agree on.
---
I don't give a shit if you DC or not... If you really think slugging someone for A FEW SECONDS just to see a new feature in the game is BM then you're a cry baby and I don't give a fuck what you think.
---
I got damn lucky with playing as 4 man one Sunday and getting a Killer who was AFK all game. My friend the nea was about to prestige so bringing in all items and offerings and happened to bring in a pink key. We smashed gens and bailed through the hatch, messaged the killer to say thank you. 
---
Other than the stars aligning like that its damn tough
---
That's why, when the dailies appear on the screen when I launch the game, I just go "I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that" and just play whoever the hell I want, however the hell I want and those juicy bloodpoints be damned.
---
how was i being rude tho? by saying the perks were weak and would just be another useless perk that people would be forced to waste bp on?
---
Could have also been a quick game where they each went down within seconds of each other. Had that as Legion once because people were still all "my favorite streamer said dont heal against Legion!" And they couldnt loop for shit so it was just an EZ win EZ (de)pip
---
Whoa that went from 0 to 904 real fast. Random stranger I love you and forgive you. I'm here if you need anyone to talk to.
---
              Sincerely, Kazadure
---
It's not that sweet. It can be super toxic during reset. You basically need to avoid it or get ready to fight dirty.
---
The best is when you grab a survivor with maiden and the gloves. It’s so fast 😂
---
Obviously it won’t, it’s just to point out that he did nothing and got banned in 2 days of having it.
---
You said a minute dude stop walking that back.  But keep up the classy cursing and juvenile behavior.  Very adult of you.
---
They must've been hoping you were gonna let them farm because of the streamers I'm guessing, it's on them for expecting anything though. That is horrible language and hopefully you did report it.
---
Not sweet, rank reset should never happen anymore after the several changes to ranking.
---
I wouldnt completely rule out a survivor. BHVR is calling it our next chapter. That leads me to believe itll have a survivor and a map.
---
After that we can nerf Spirit so all Killers can be B Tier and by grading on a curve they are all now S tier! /s
---
I face camp when the doors are opened come give me downvotes survivor mains lol
---
&gt;Why would you ever run a perk that only offers + 2 seconds 2 generator completion time over literally any other perk that Killers could use? 
---
"Literally" any other perk? Okie. Swapping out thana for monstrous shrine immediately!
---
if a perk needs another perk paired with it to have any use it's not a good perk
---
As someone who really wants The Miner in this game as well, let's break down your perks
---
# Party Crasher
---
The problem with this is that it isn't very useful; if you really wanted to know where the two survivors are, you'd probably just take Nurse's Calling and see them heal as you walked back to the hook.
---
If it were to show you any survivor within say 8m of the Hook so you could actually react to the unhooking prior to it happening (i.e. heading toward it while it's going on), and maybe a second or two afterwards, you'd be able to combine it with MYC to be able to track down the unhooker.
---
As it is, it just doesn't offer much that you'd want, as all it does is read auras and there are better perks for that.
---
# Beware Harry Warden
---
The problem with this perk is while it's fun, it causes the Killer to do something they absolutely do NOT want to be doing; sitting in one spot waiting for the survivors to come by. In a full game with no DCs, there's 7 generators you should be working on, standing near 1 is just going to get 4 of them completed without you doing anything about it.
---
This perk is basically Insidious but it can only be "activated" at certain spots on the map.
---
# Be My Bloody Valentine
---
*This* perk, however, is a really good idea, even if it's not really powerful. I think this has promise with some tweaks. If it Exposed the Survivor for 15-30 seconds and revealed their aura for 4 seconds (or made a loud noise notification from them screaming from finding it), it'd actually be a pretty useful perk, especially with Franklin's.
---
I'd make it like this:
---
**Be My Bloody Valentine**
---
You have left grisly presents of your past victims for the Survivors to find. When a Survivor opens a chest, there is a chance that they will be Exposed for 10/20/30 seconds and you will receive a Loud Noise Notification at their location.
---
The first time a Survivor opens a chest, there is a 50%/75%/100% chance of there being a Grisly Present. Chests after that have a 25%/35%/45% chance of being a Grisly Present.
---
Wow they on some petty shit.
---
David next please
---
Congrats,  now I'll always use deer stalker, knockout, Franklin's and bbq and chilly
---
I am I just submitted a ban apeal on EACappeal
---
They actually don't, it's just luck, noob3's been banned at least twice because of custom icons and portraits
---
Considering they nerfed it from the live version on that patch I don't think it'll see a buff any time soon.
---
She was streaming at the time.
---
Hmm. Yeah, but the thing is the Spider God wanted *you*.
---
Side note, it would have been hilarious if it had opened and immediately slammed shut once your body disappeared
---
Dude that's so not wortht it.
---
Rank 20 would mean it would queu you with new Day 1 Players. I dont imagine we get new players at a huge rate so I'm not surprised it's a barren wasteland
---
No thanks
---
Wow
---
First perk is too specific to Harry Warden, bear in mind it needs to be a teachable. It's also not the most useful, and seems more intended to annoy survivors.
---
Second perk, would be better suited as a killer power. It'd also be useless on most killers.
---
Third perk, way too unfair. It basically eliminates any possibility of hiding from the killer after being unhooked. It'd be BS on killers like Nurse or Hillbilly.
---
Maybe something that kind of copies the teleportation idea from the Friday the 13th game. Like you can tag a survivor and  see their aura, and if they are a far enough distance from you, you can activate your power to teleport within a 10 metre radius of them. This ability only would last for a set amount of time before wearing off and needing to retag them. It could visual look similar to how nurse teleports. 
---
It could make for some cool moments as a survivor meets with others to get healed and then suddenly Jason appears to hit multiply survivors.
---
Exactly
---
If it was EAC theres not much you can do about it. They rarely unban players unless it was obviously a wrongful ban. They won’t even tell you what it was that got you banned. As per the usual, theres always a risk in modifying files and since it’s permanent and VAC ban I definitely wouldn’t recommend doing it. It’s not worth it imo.
---
It's (you're) you stupid bitch
---
Well you cant be afraid of dying if you're already dead.
---
&gt; no counterplay
---
every time I've seen a secret offering as survivor in the past 2 days someone has dodged in loading screen causing the game to be canceled lol
---
how the tables have turned
---
Thought he was banned for modding blood points/flashlights into his inventory
---
Wait y'all getting me confused
---
enjoy your one singular sacrifice while the others escape cause you're not fucking hunting you moron lmao

Der verhackstückelte verhackstückelhafte Fleischer?

This is the kind of content I posted this for. Thanks for the advice.
---
Slenderman would be a licensed killer, and from what I've heard that license is really hard to get a hold of now.
---
I looked this up a while go, so it may be wrong now, but the dude who originally held the rights to Slenderman basically said "Do what you want as long as it's good" and proceeded to sell them to people who didn't think the same way.
---
Lmao please do that then wonder why you're getting fucked every game with that dumb ass build .
---
No need to fuel them, just silently leave a report and the Mods can take it from there.

---
Do y'all just forget everything the devs say.  They're not making it take effect on dead survivors lol
---
I assume they are because I have never seen anyone using it that wasn't
---
Wow that's stupid i guess its worth a try i provided screenshots and i been super honest to them hopefully i get unbanned
---
Transform into a generator. When a survivor comes and tickles you delicately, pop out and scare the mess out of them.
---
Wow. Another enlightened soul has graced us. Thank you. &lt;3
---
ok buddy
---
It would but for you to have it, you would have to like drop your medkit or box to carry it and be very obviously carrying it
---
I refer to it as "Being a Motherfucker"
---
Just play no mither + this is not happening Kappa
---
yeah same i thought that
---
Oh, okay, yeah, your point is completely right I hate people who do that!
---
I'm confused what's wrong with this build ??
---
SWF make a lot of things 'not work'. The game shouldn't be balanced around them.
---
I like them, they have counterplay and aren't a total nightmare to play against but I have some issues with it. First is movement speed. I think their movement speed nerf was unnecessary. The legions whole point is to chain hits and injure survivors. Combined with the increased duration they added, this can be very nice. Legion imo now feels really sluggish and clunky, which ties with my next issue; vault speeds. They also nerfed vault speeds making them even more awkward and sluggish. I don't think anyone would mind them reverting back the movement speed and vault speeds since the biggest issues with old legion was moonwalking, certain add ons, swinging furiously with no consequences and the ability to down survivors eventually, no matter what they do.
---
You cant be afraid of Death if you're dead.
---
Anytime :)
---
I think gen skill checks are much faster. Pay attention while in game to see what I mean.
---
It’s definitely worth a try. Just to be sure, have you cheated in any EAC game in the past 6 months? Usually EAC takes a few months to ban you.
---
No, but if you added this killer power to the game, the killer would be trash tier, because SWF would nullify the power. Not just weaken the power, it would be useless.
---
Legit I've said the same thing and everyone I play with said they would pay yo have that emote.
---
Poor Meg :(
---
I would love to get double BP for my normal build since i only run like 2 meta perks and the others i’ve never seen anyone else run.
---
Still, Leatherface is the second worst killer only behind trapper cause his power really doesn't give him anyway.
---
Best power I've ever heard can we call it *the moistening*
---
Give the killer more of a reason to chase you as they had protected against a thief and they get the points for it. But like every time you get downed the mask or chainsaw or whatever is dropped there for another to pick up
---
I agree with the trying out phase and if matches are greatly improved and it doesn't effect lobbies, move forward with it.
---
I also, like the 2 vs 8 mode. I love this game to death, but it needs more than just new maps and characters to keep it fresh. This would be a whole new level to the game and it should be something more then just repairing generators. 
---
The one thing I like about Fortnite, is that they are always trying out new modes and gameplay ideas. While BVHR doesn't have that kind of staff to work with … it keeps players coming back for me.
---
Hah I feel ya on that. It's a struggle out there for survivors.
---
..... Oooooooh.
---
At least they're doing *something.*
---
It's especially infuriating when you're stage 2 on your first hook, while your teammate slowly urban evades over from across the map so they can save their sprint burst to run away after they unhook you, letting the killer get a free down on you again.
---

---
You wouldn't be carrying it though.
---
You'd be wearing it.
---
Even then the movie version of slenderman is complete shit and ruins the character
---
Thank you, you saved me a post. The perk is useless except for the psychological aspect.
---
Get the perk bamboozle then you vault it and the entity blocks the window for a certain amount of time.
---
We need to stop you
---
The hooks are always sharp.
---
Yeah i huess but you would need to give a person an incentive to drop their item for the 10 k points
---
Classic British comedy &gt; game breaking bugs
---
Bamboozle is useful for shutting down jungle gyms. Also, try to mindgame. If they're going to go one direction around the T-wall, fake like you're going to go to the other side (via behind the top part of the T in T-wall, if that makes sense). But back up straight once you've gone halfway past the wall, to hide your red light, and then turn around. This catches some survivors off guard for a free hit.
---
From what I've heard survivors will occasionally attack each other
---
Depends. If you're doing it to be an ass or SWF rank abuse (e.g. a Rank 3 survivor in a Rank 8 lobby because the SWF host is around Rank 8) I'm not gonna like you very much. Also it's a pain in the ass to deal with as Trapper because they know where everything is. I've had instances of people tailing me and disarming my Traps the whole time, so I pretty much have to tunnel them down and remove them because they're sharing everything they know and seriously reducing how effective I can actually be. 
---
Despite all that, I think that running this perk takes some serious guts to do correctly. I think it gets a bad rep, and no I do not think the perk itself is *inherently* toxic. Not like old DS was in high ranks.
---
Yeah, you are right. They already have Dwight.
---
I went from 16 and now I'm up to 8 now. 
---
It's possible.
---
They said they have thought about new game modes and 2V6 is the obvious mode.
---
Well, really they NEED to add a new mode. People are getting bored of what is currently available
---
Honestly
---
The stance made me think this was ash and mildly shooketh me
---
I'd personally like it if it only blocked one exit at a time. Preferably one with survivors in it or closest to it
---
I was Ash originally, changed to Feng and this happened
---
gay shit
---
Oh hey this must be referring to Diamond is Unbreakable.
---
Pretty sure you mean 2v8. I want it to become a reality, but the maps will be massive and demanding. I don’t think it will be able to be supported for a while considering dbd is broke as is.
---
I made a post about killer combos after a discussion with a friend of mine, and Trapper and Freddy are the two best "secondary killers" in the game, bar none.
---
Freddy: You can't hide from the Nurse/Billy if Freddy is feeding them info as to where you are. Not to mention he's basically a Hex: Ruin that can actually kill people. NOT TO MENTION Black Box + Dying Light shenanigans to put everyone else down to 75% permanently.
---
Trapper: Want to run to cover to not get chainsawed by Billy? Ran into a trap. Got a RBT on your head? All the boxes are trapped, so you can't get them off. Trying to loop any killer? Traps are there. Busy paying attention to where Nurse is blinking? Ran into a trap.
---
Those two are pretty nightmarish when paired with any other killer.
---
Feng has fuckin, been hitting the gym I see.
---
It looks more like her Fatigue animation glitched and didn't play, because after 2 blinks and a weapon swipe, she should've been stunned for a good couple of seconds. 
---
I can see why you stayed on the Gen instead of bailing because of that reason too.
---
Wait what did change about Freddy? Why isnt he considered Bad? What strat got found?
---
Again a little weird but not a sin. 
---
No not toxic but will tunnel them down as they tend to act as a radar for their swf.
---
No. 2v6. They would need to add way more gens to balance 8 survivors. Waaaay more
---
I'm gonna shame you out loud but silently agree with you
---
10 gens, 8 survivors, two killers? Pretty sure that’s work.
---
And you are so stupid that you can't even read. Again if you slug the guy for a minute YOU ARE NOT WASTING A MINUTE, if you were to hook the guy you would take AT LEAST 10 seconds, just on the animation alone of pickup/hooking... that means if you slug the guy for a minute at maximum you're making him "waste" 50 seconds, and thats pretty rare or do you intentionally run to a hook when getting downed? Most likely the guy would waste 10-20 seconds realistically
---
He isn't shitty, hes unpolished. He's good trash. He's like if tachanka in seige was viable but people still think he's L teir. In his current state he is good but to be good with him requires knowledge on hidden mechanics, the ability to count accurately, how to apply pressure, where and where isnt a dead zone, and basic M1 mindgames as well as anti healing perks. He needs work to feel better and to feel more like freddy rather than simply to make him not trash like many believe.
---
Cat Dwight is needed
---
I made this quickly on my phone, I know it's bad lol
---
I did report it and submitted a ticket along with their names. I hope BHVR takes matters like this seriously, because it's something this game does not need.
---
It's not bannable, you know how many people have reported me for that very thing? In some instances, like my own, if you broke chase for a second, you're allowed another 3 vaults on that window. So a good survivor can extend the vaults on it. I've vaulted a window 7 times before because I was able to break chase and made a few vaults not in chase. Although personally if I vault something in a chase 3 times and it doesn't lock I'll leave it, unless that killer is specifically being a douche.
---
It should but until other stuff that also should be fixed by now is fixed I don't think they should put man power in it. Thats it. thanks. bye.
---
Think about other killers stepping in traps. They would need to watch out for them too. 
---
The funny thing is they already did it with the mobile game. Don’t know why they didn’t do it yet with the main one. Or... maybe they already have started. Maybe that is why that bug existed where multiple killers could appear. Perhaps that was some development code being inadvertently activated. Here’s hoping. 
---
And to the fortnight thing, I think they would do better to be a free game and still sell all the costumes like now. Maybe have a subscription for additional Bloodpoints or shards. I believe that was a question in the recent survey.
---
I second his statement
---
You could make the same argument with so many perks if you twist your phrasing the way you are with "only xyz extra seconds of gen repair". 
---
"Why would you run a perk that only saves you 1 second of time when you get stunned, that's like totally useless, especially if you dont get stunned often"
---
"Why would you run a perk that can be cleansed and only decreases gen completion time by a few seconds as long as survivors are decent and can hit great skill checks, that's so useless"
---
"Why would you run a perk that only increases pallet break times by a split second? Useless"
---
"Why run any perk that does anything? So useless in 90% of situations."
---
Why do I hear boss music!!!
---
Then it wouldn't be Jason. It works for ghostface since there never was one specific ghostface, but having "Jason" be an imitation wouldn't be worth it. I'd rather have an original killer, and I prefer licensed characters to original ones.
---
That makes sense. I feel so dumb! Thanks lol
---
The already have a killer argument is pretty mute. We have mutplie similar killers. I honestly think his shift ability from his game wouldn't be bad. Like a nurse but you cant phase through things.
---
It was one of those games where it went to shit for them. One person went down, then the other, and then the other. I've had those games before and they suck, but in noway does that justify their horrible language
---
Kind of depends on who you are and what you play on. I have trouble following blood, so if I were to run a blood-following build I’d run bloodhound. Sloppy is still good as a deterrent to healing though
---
Lol I guess 😂 yeah, I'm pretty sure cussing is allowed here. Not 100% sure though
---
big license issue already has his own game etc
---
A rage mode, a map wide teleport, making fog to stop vision, super tracking..lots of options

Did I tunnel and camp? If I did or didn't, that doesn't mean it's okay to use that language. You can be upset about something, but to go to this extreme is never justified. Plain and simple
---
They really, really wouldn't know.
---
Any killer that can shapeshift, it would take a conversation like this to fuck the killer over.
---
"Lmao hey are any of you guys at the shack"
---
"No"
---
"Aiight, it's the killer."
---
would be much appreciated by me and other ppl. have a nice day
---
That’s the very first time I’ve ever seen onomatopoeia for breathing heavily from the nose.
---
Well, we got the PTB to find out what works so...
---
Wait how do you know it happens?
---
I agree, or we can work together to trap killers in areas of the map to buy some more time. The possibilities are endless, however the budget is not. 
---
As someone who has purchased this game on PS4, Xbox One and now PC. I would not care at all if they made it free moving forward. Maybe throw in a cosmetic or some currency to buy something cosmetic for those of us who paid for it. But I want more players and whatever it takes that doesn't hurt the game overall.
---
why do meg and Claudette get singled out? ive seen every survivor fuck up ruin skill checks.
---
Jumping off a hill or building and landing a hit like a damn assassin creed kill. 
---
Hitting through pallets to. 
---
As for pig. Tbaggin the downed tbagger
---
*If you run away you die*
---
Matter of principle friend.  Slugging is a dick move.  Some of us play killer without resorting to such tactics. You sound like a proxycamper too with how you conduct yourself on here.
---
Except Jason was never OP in his own game to begin with. 
---
As soon as more then 1 camper was around him you could easily bully him for 5-10 mins. I stopped playing that game after we once killed Jason 5 times in a row in a single night. 
---
I think Jason would do fine in DbD
---
It's the same day every month. The 13th
---
The number of times I've been a survivor on a hook for the full hook since I've been back to dbd is absurd. More often than not this is either the result of: A swf thinking they dont need me and let me die, a swf or 3 randos all rush the hook giving the killer no reason to leave (and they all refuse to take agro,) or three survivors are just on their own gens and assume the next person will get me.
---
I shouldn't have to play with friends just to get unhooked ffs. I also shouldn't have to take Kindred and fucking *hope* that they come for me.
---
I haven't seen a camping killer for a while.
---
Wait a minuute
---
&gt; He played dirty and got a dirty response 
---
You didn't even see how I played nor asked what happened. You assumed something based off of these survivors horrific response. Your comment is so disappointing...
---
Oh really? I d idnt know that.
---
..Why does it happen anyway?
---
I feel personally attacked
---
All deliberate exploits are always banable, but it's the dev's call when to actually enforce it. As a player, you still need to report people abusing exploits even if the devs aren't out for blood yet.
---
Could you specify which glowing skin you are refering to?
---
If it's legacy, chances are those are just a bit more experienced players.
---
It's probably not their fault matchmaking puts them against low ranked survivors, they could be deranking on purpose tho. They could've hacked their legacy on a fresh account, in which case yeah they're just some douchebags bullying new players.
---
Im sorry OP. hope you  reported that guy.
---
Not really. I don't have an issue with MoM, and I main pig. I will purposely only dash attack my obsession to not give stacks. Plus MoM is only really strong during late/endgame for taking extra hits for people or making saves. Otherwise, you can get hit an extra time, cool, I'll still catch you quickly. Mettle to me is like old ds, shitty in most people's hands, but extremely strong in a good players hands, and most people aren't those God players.
---
If the killer was chasing the survivor before the hatch was found, it is entirely fair that the hatch gets shut if the survivor tries to jump in. Plus, the killer has to he really close in order to close the hatch before the survivor animation finishes. You likely would have been grabbed out anyway if that still existed.
---
What if he could trap generators? Triggering the trap gives a notification that he can then Teleport within X meters of the generator. When triggered it causes his *KiKiKi MaMaMa* sound to go off. The trap doesn't hurt the survivors, but with add-ons it could give statuses and such. He can trap 2-3 generators at a time. 
---
Also you could give him like a built in FIRED UP esk power where as more generators are done Jason gets faster and stronger, until full RAGE and the pallets break on hit on him like spirit fury but the stun is lessened, hes almost unstoppable but that would only be like at the dead last generator
---
His perks could be anything really, they don't have to make complete sense to him, almost every killer has at least 1 or more perks that have like nothing to do with their schtick lol
---
Let's farm da ho. Beeetch
---
That's unbreakable, not flip flop
---
Like last time, i don't like cat versions of people but if you do then that's fine.
---
4 ways. Don’t take your loops wide and force them to entity block a window.
---
Bamboozle
---
Hope they fuck the loop up by mindgaming them
---
Or chase someone else
---
All of the above are valid options. If the runner is really optimal, I personally chase another person. Try to hit them at least once though. You waste way too much time chasing good loopers
---
Map add-on allows you to place a beacon for other survivors.
---
It's pretty much like that now. I can be rank 14 level 80 devotion 2. Rank has no bearing on skill. We need match making based on level but it would probably still not make finding matches faster.
---
Is bamboozle considered mandatory on Myers? I had no idea. I main Billy so dont play alot of Myers but would like too
---
wtf since when ?! is it literally just something so the other survivors can see a specific place whoever puts it down wants them to see?
---
Awesome :) i Love it!!
---
If i could Change anything, make it more dark. Dark BG and darker shadows
---
2 killers with different powers would be too much for 6 survs. Honestly, unless the maps are scaled up by like 4x, there should really be like, 2v10. Not even kidding.
---
And you guys smoked him. Pass your knowledge on to all the people that rage quit.
---
I'm a proud asshole then kid.
---
Look at the match though. Gates are powered no one is dead and here this player is thinking I can get away with it and it didnt work out.
---
Gotta change coulrophobia then
---
Thank you! :')
---
i’m so glad someone got that😩 vanjie next survivor confirmed ✊🏼
---
i’m in college now hehe
---
Does it also stack with the Wraiths action speed add on?
---
Yeah no. That's just awful
---
Who were you playing as? It’d be funny if you were either Dwight or Kate in that game XD
---
All of my teammates just teabag at the gate after I saved one and body block to make sure they didn’t get tunnel...
---
Alright this ain't a sin, i approve this one but i'm still a bit horrified of the legion one.
---
Of course.u have a great Style :)  do you study or Work in this direction?
---
Let's disable survivors from using teachables then
---
“Using no mither is a counter to haunted grounds, Sloppy Butcher, noed, make your choice, Myers, billy and bubba. Yet people say it’s bad? Smh”
---
Spirit should be above Billy and Hag should be above Huntress imo, rest seems pretty accurate. However there is an argument to be made that LF is the worst killer, but him and Freddy are so close it basically doesn't even matter.
---
I guess it does depend on the scenario though. Really it's just arguing semantics when it comes to A tier.
---
2v6 would be just awful.
---
I agree that leatherface needs a rework. He simplistic design doesn’t have any potential like billy and huntress. This goes the same for trapper and wraith who are also low tier.
---
THE HUNT IS ON BOYS
---
I was a Dwight in the musky hoodie and tracksuit pants lmao
---
It's a ban-able offense too.
---
She was always an m1 killer so her traps were always secondary for her ability to kill. I don't doubt that her late game has been gutted a bit though because of it. This is coming from someone that would usually put traps on when there were 3 gens left or 2
---
If only they would make that another game mode or an option in KYF...
---
Become Evan Macmillian
---
I’ve thought the same exact thing
---
lol salt
---
It’s a shame it was on imgflip and with THAT font and a low res image
---
Good to know; makes sense why Ive never seem her before.
---
Seriously. I would buy this right away, nothing against Ash- but Shaun would be so much better.
---
I don’t think the complaint is one about balance, but rather the name of the perk. I think most people believe thanatophobia is in a nice place.
---
To counteract the OP’s point, though, you can be scared of death if you’re injured/dying/hooked, and likely are. You can’t be scared if you’re already dead.
---
generally if they’re the first down they dc from my experience so i usually go for them first and wait
---
So many people can't get people yet I get people in seconds even faster as killer...odd
---
Cool, then by your logic there should be no complaints about killers use NOED in your post history right? Because it’s a build killers enjoy.
---
Sarcasm, btw. You’ve totally bitched about NOED before. Congrats, you’ve earned your hypocrite badge.
---
Oh, right! I forgot the consoles have a different icon for Unbreakable.
---
Plus Flip flop is green, I haven't seen it in so long I completely forgot.
---
BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury. Not original by any means but it gets the job done. I float around rank 5 but hate red ranks for toxic survivors and killers so enjoy being new and lower ranks!
---
Alternative title: How to bathe in more salt than the dead sea
---
Nope, I was there initially to hide from the killer, then the asshole Dwight came to lock me in. Then he called over the Bill and they both looked me in together for another 30 seconds then they left and I was "free", but I had ravens on my head at that point. Then we all got killed shortly after.
---
I brought a good toolbox too :(
---
Oink
---
r/rimjobsteve
---
I think that's what I'm weakest at. Feels like there is always 1 person at least who can run me for days and days around jungle gyms
---
Yeah I reported him. I've read that reporting doesn't do anything though, but hopefully that's not true.
---
Oinkay*
---
Unfortunate, I know.
---
Shouldn't have said that bud
---
There is proof that goes both way of it either being one or not. 
---
I can see it going either way, though my bets are on just ghostface for several reasons. 
---
They likely only have the Mask for a license. 
---
Ash came out who kinda threw off all the releases. This could be a new trend for awhile, or they release 2 pargraphs instead. 
---
We would have heard AYTHING about a map or a survivor.
---
lol I never thought about doing that
---
Mordern problems require modern solutions
---
&gt; From what I've seen most good nurses don't even run hex ruin or noed in the first place. 
---
From my experience it's quite the opposite, red ranks so far (this update) has been a nurse with Ruin (and/or) NOED every 3 or so games. I don't mind Ruin/NOED on any other killer (Because it buys them much needed time and is fair as far as I'm concerned) but on the Nurse it's extremely obnoxious because the Nurse is powerful enough to not need to buy extra time VIA hex perks.
---
I mean it does sometimes, im mean the dev's kinda throw a dart at a bored and decide who to ban.
---
The most optimal build for a good nurse is BBQ/Shadowborn/Whispers/Infestive fright.
---
You can run her perkless and still have almost as much success. Her power is the problem, not hex perks.
---
I pretty sure you get the birds before 10 minutes passes, or am I wrong?
---

---
Make your Choice. It’s already the perfect name
---
The double knife thing is praobly a bug, you also didnt mention that  his power doesnt drain when hes not spotted. 
---
I think he raises the knife from exposing someone.
---
So you're one of those crouching clauddets which camps the hatch when all her team is dying on first hook?
---
I recommend this video -&gt;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
It shows how to run most of the tiles optimally as killer :D
---
This person also made 2 killer guides, just scroll down a bit on his list of uploads. They are called "ultimate guide to huntress" and "how to not be a bad killer".
---
Of course, only actually exploiting (deliberately) would be a problem. Also thank you for sharing some of the details, I wasn't really aware of the nature of the bug.
---
r/rimjob_steve
---
Yeah the birds took like 5 minutes I think
---
It's a dick move but not bannable
---
r/JustLearnedTheFWord
---
Of course it's a Dwight. 
---
I've had this done to me too in the past. And I only play survivor for daily. Another used Bond to point out my location to the killer. 
---
I've seen 3 Dwights bullying a Spirit in corner so she couldn't do anything. Couldn't attack, couldn't move.
---
This is why I dip out if I play survivor and Dwight is in the lobby.  He'll either be toxic or incompetent.
---
As a killer, they are always my first target. I figure I'm doing the other survivors a favour.
---
I'll give it a watch. Ty
---
He has some mindgame with crouching and has an instadown so he will at least have that
---
The sad thing is, this can result in a shit ton of fun, or a shit ton of bullshit, There is no inbetween. and it sucks. BHVR fix game, add 8 survivor, 2 killer matchez
---
Gale swallows
---
Freddy needs all the help he can get
---
No. Sorry.
---
The only way to punish this sort of behavior is to go do gens and don't go for the save. Unless you have borrowed time and are confident/have deliverence + Sprint burst there is almost no way for you to unhook them.
---
The advantage changes in a 3v1 to the killers favor. That’s simple enough reasoning for the perk to not work.
---
Do you play survivor? Those perks are no way near as unbalanced as NOED.
---
Well then since it's not exploiting, there is no ground for the report.
---
I get found a lot at the very first 20 seconds of the game whenever I start at a gen and proceed to work on it. Almost every time the killer comes to my gen and searches every fking corner, till he finds me. And somehow this leads to me getting tunneled and camped, so I leave the game with a small loan of 1-2k points.
---
All of this at the first 2 min. Fuck this game.
---
That's my problem with him. He needs them too fuck up. A lot of killers feel like they have control in a sense where if they are good enough they can force a hit even if the survivor doesn't make a mistake. However leatherface in my opinion can't do that doesn't.
---
I think what hurts him the most isn't even his fault which is that hillbilly exists. Sure leatherface can insta down multiple people but that only happens when they make a huge mistake. Hillbilly can only instadown one person but can use it much more reliably in a chase and can use it for map pressure.
---
So he is just great at killing those who makes mistakes but if they don't there is not much you can do.
---
There it is!
---
Had 0 because after I hooked someone and saw that Meg with BBQ I immediately went to her without refilling
---
Yw :)
---
Right
---
Exactly this.
---
Actually this gives me an idea for my Mori daily for some lulz and a good way to not use a mori.
---
I mean I'm not saying its possible, but I don't expect any Scream character survivor.
---
2 different companies own Scream and Ghostface respectively.
---
 So a non license survivor nis what I'm expecting but if it was Brenda I'd fucking spaz out about it.
---
"Just mutilate her white ass an leave!"
---
Are you referring to legacy or hollowed blight?
---
Unfortunately this game has no made up honor code and is played however you and anyone else wants to play
---
I mean..they might have leaked it on purpose we dont know. 
---
Second...not trying to be mean but the fog whispers dont know everything and thigns can change too.
---
They're interesting
---
I want to gouge my eyes out
---
Where did they say that?
---
Someone did this to the survivors in a killer game I was playing and I let everyone else live and killed the troll. He then messages me saying hes gonna report me for teaming with the survivors. Hilarious.
---
We already had a parahraph for a suvivor. And secondly, they never SAID this year they will release chapters 3 months apart, that was for eriler.
---
I think that Devour Hope, while terribly obnoxious when it does come up, is at least on the right track towards a fair way of doing it. Moris should not be a strategy to eliminate competition early, but rather a fun addition if you're already going to win. Nobody on either side should be allowed to skip necessary steps for victory.
---
Thats the same fucking thing...A paraphraph is a dlc....
---
That's just what I saw. I'm taking everything with a grain of salt.
---
I think you have your terms mixed up. If it’s legacy, they are likely really good and you just suck. They aren’t try hards, you’re just bad.
---
See, this is the type of mentality newb survivors have. You suck therefore the killer is a dick and cheating/try hard/tunneling/camping when in fact they were not. Really, you probably just need to take a deep breath and say, “what can I do next trial to not get owned like that again?” Instead of “Lol tunneling/try hard killer”
---
They should really just add a way for you to make custom matches.  Cap it at a certain number and allow you to put as many killers or survivors as you want so long as there is at least one of each.
---
I hear it is great for the skin and it cleanses the soul.
---
Obviously I'm not serious but the puppet is paid dlc cosmetic every other game is pay to win why not dbd
---
I was downed a lot of times lmao
---
&gt; Actually this gives me an idea 
---
Please do tell.
---
Only tier 1 whispers has a 48 meter range (which makes it quite useless since it will be active almost all game). Tier 3 has a range of 32 meters, same as the usual terror radius. Together with M&amp;A, crouching when Whispers lights up should still work like it did before the radius change though.
---
If it me, I stay until all my teammates are either safe or doomed or a combination of the 2
---
Definitely refreshes the mind
---
By that logic most killer perks are terrible perks then
---
Either way it felt like forever and it was annoying. I was sitting there thinking ‘just kill me already’
---
Ghostface isn't Scary Movie, it's Scream. Scary Movie is just a Scream **parody.** We DEFINITELY need Sidney over Brenda, due to her being, y'know, the Final Girl from the actual *original series.*
---
That cap has been in the game since like last year.
---
you did 3 gens and got downed afterwards, and you are low rank so you pip easily
---
\*Patched, 10 killers in 1 match vs 1 survivor with 5 second end game collapse kill, instant 360k bloodpoints for all involved now removed\* &lt; This the level of shit BHVR would break if they did that, I almost guarantee it.
---
The Church of Pharmacy bestows a certain power to all of its members.
---
At least give the trapper a jason skin idk
---
Finally
---
That must have been seriously satisfying.
---
Gee I wonder where all these hillbilly and nurses come from.
---
she might not have an hourglass body but her mind,,, so skinny
---
+1, I will however, take you to the hatch to show you where it was. Then hook you.
---
Great way of showing Ace's powers
---
By "try hard" do you just mean better than you?
---
why the sky is blue and clouds are white: wink:
---
Team laurie
---
Yessss dude
---
Ah yes, the infamous "Nuclear Gandhi". Originally a glitch but later games often set his nuclear affinity to the absolute maximum as a joke/throwback to the glitch, while retaining otherwise "expected" Gandhi AI traits, resulting in a kind, peace-loving anti-war  character who builds tons of nukes and isn't afraid to use them if pushed beyond the breaking point.
---
No, all we can do is hope they get stuck in traffic and have to poop.
---
Heathen, begone from this place
---
Thanataphobia affects healthy survivors too. It makes sense you'd get more scared as your friends are killed.
---
The hatch standoff was basically an ego competition... who has the bigger ego to waste time to get that last kill/escape. Tbh if I'm the killer I either go afk in front of the hatch (and go do whatever... eat, bathroom, youtube) or I hit the survivor when he's near.
---
I mean I wouldn't call it greed, I'd call it survivors not wanting to derank. A killer playing like this literally makes it impossible to rank up or get bloodpoints without doing extra tasks such as chest searching or running around the afk killer for a few minutes.
---
Nice, especially the song choices
---
So far you have found 5 Michael Myers collectables. 5 more before you can find shirtless Myers.
---
I bet ur one of them Quentin plebs. Laurie is god
---
So many things could have gone wrong, and yet it worked. All according to plan. Well done!
---
Not necessarily toxic but I am killing your ass... tunneling, camping, I don't care you're not having a good game in my lobby with that shit.
---
Edit : To be clear the perk was not designed so that one guy gets revealed so everyone knows the killer position. Its more an issue of SWF than anything but it only happens with OoO. Using it and relaying the info I consider toxic and thats pretty much the only occasion people use it
---
You want to hear something worse?
---
Running WGLF with We’ll make it, and they KNOW I have it, and they KNOW the killer isn’t near, and they still run away.
---
Keep in mind, I play at red/purple rank too.
---
If he's anything like the game. We'll be able to finish all 5 gens and leave before he appears.
---
Yep. Sloppy Butcher, Franklin's Demise, Save the Best For Last, Remember Me, and Third Seal all work with Legion's Feral Frenzy because it still technically counts as a "Hit" scoring event.
---
I don't get this. Your complaining about someone using tier 1 MoM. Lol wut..
---
Adrenaline is the only surv perk I have an issue with.
---
It does, it's a good perk on him.
---
Oh yea, i think there’s nothing more beautiful in this game than the sound of simultaneous survivors screaming from the entity. [Everyone post game was amazed with the play as well](https://imgur.com/a/sX32jMR)
---
Swf?
---
Not the original commentor, but I used to watch Puppers for a long time. Many times have people come into his stream and respectfully disagreed with him and he acts like a child about it.

Gonna get my PWYF stacks along with Rancor. Gonna act like I’m letting them farm, then once last gen is completed, kill the obsession for an easy daily. Won’t have to burn a mori just for a daily.
---
**What in the actual fuck just happened**
---
Danke. C:
---
Here's another thing.
---
Look at his stance. If his left hand is open, watch the hell out. 
---
Also pay attention to how he acts in T2. If he's slow and not "stalking levels" of slow and he's not hitting people, break Direct Line of Sight ASAP.
---
Personally I think leather face deserves too be very low. He feels too dependent on the survivors making mistakes too be able to get a swing much less a chainsaw hit.
---
With the clown you can slow them enough too land a hit and feels much more consistent because of it.
---
It does but is it worth a perk slot? Its a gimmick with a weak perk and a weak power...
---
clueless
---
I understand your stance on this, but I disagree with it and here's why:
---
• Disguising killers: while a killer is disguised, we can assume that the killer wont have a terror radius or red stain. That ability alone is pretty useful as it allows stealth killers to get up close and get a free hit in or even a grab. Just look at killers like Pig and Wraith (yes, not exactly top-tier killers, but I'm not here to argue whether it would be top-tier but whether it would work). Combine that with the fact that you can deguise as a survivor and you can have some interesting mind games you can play. Even if the survivors are SWF, just the fact that the killer can disguise themselves as a survivor can slow the game down by that alone. Just because SWF can communicate with one another doesn't mean they know where everyone is and they would constantly be communicating with each other like "hey, who's on a gen right now? Who's on this gen right now? Can you see me? I'm teabagging right now". Unless the killer is in a chase, you would never be able to feel safe around other survivors or would have to waste time confirming the identity of a survivor and even then the killer can still sneak up and stab you while you're doing that. And if that's still not powerful enough, then nothing's saying that disguising has to be the only part of the killer kit. Going back to Pig, she technically has two abilities at her disposal. 
---
• Multiple killers: we already kind of have something like this with the Hag; a killer who can teleport to clones of herself when her traps get triggered and with a certian add-on she dosent even need to have the trap triggered in order to activate it. I think the way to have a killer who is actually multiple killers is to think of it less like a "multiple killers versus survivors" and more like "one killer who is able to swap places at predetermined locations". To balance it, you can allow survivors the ability to disable the killers "swap-points" (again, similar to how survivors can burn the Hags traps or crouch walk over them th avoid triggering them). 
---
Again, I understand your stance, but I personally would rather have new ideas be tried and found out that they don't work than to just say "it will never work" and have it never be attempted.
---
nah
---
No. Not really sorry either, as long as the endgame is in effect. Then it becomes securing a kill.
---
Weak. you fools are following an idol
---
I need one 😱🥰
---
Get used to it... because either from the survivor or killer side you will get trash.
---
Well if you're playing Pig or Wraith, it's pretty dumb
---
Poop
---
Survive with friends
---
Rather an idol than the bringer of decisive strike, heathen
---
If I don't have Borrowed Time, I am your saviour testing the Mettle of Man against whomever that killer is and my lightstick is ready to flash blind them to oblivion.

High school Spanish to the rescue! Quieres means you would like or you want

That's so perfect.
---
7 seconds to hit a survivor, sO HEs The WoRsT kiLlER
---
I’m skeptical about how a 2v8 would work. I feel like it could be incredibly difficult for survivors if the killers double teamed a single survivor. Imagine trying to run one way from a killer, and the other loops around in front of you cutting you off. You’d have no where to go and would be forced to go down. If killers did that, chases wouldn’t last more than a few seconds. Yeah there’s 7 other survivors, but do you know how boring that’d be? Most of the game you’d be on generators, and the second the killers spot you, you can’t even loop, which in my opinion is one of the best, most interactive parts of the game. I feel like it’d just be M1 simulator, until the killers find you. I’d be more than happy if I was proved wrong because it has the potential to be very fun, I just feel like it also has the potential to be downright terrible. I hope I’m proven wrong though
---
Thanks, High School Spanish
---
Count me in if you'll end up selling them!! It's so perfect
---
I feel like we finally found out why the devs put Rancor in the game.
---
I'm not sure it would work unless your Obsession somehow completes every generator and has Dark Sense. Otherwise they're going to know something's up.
---
babey!!
---
I'm sure its not an excuse but next time try to also stay still. It makes 2 thing, one it will make crows appear eventually which they did, second he may stop finding this shit funny or interesting since you're not reacting.
---
Also people pointed that out already but its a bannable offense and I would perhaps send a ticket to behaviour with video since reporting in game rarely works
---
Cool thank you I’ll have to try it out.
---
Was just interested if it worked
---
That’s why you have PWF stacked up. There’s not a chance in hell they can outrun you.
---
That Feng was like: "if I'm gonna die, I'm taking you with me!"
---
I honestly just kind of want to sneak around as Ghostface and scare survivors, not even attacking them. Just peeking my head around the corner.
---
Congrats, you BMed with a bullshit perk. Here's a medal.
---
Same. Idk how anyone could have looked at those changes and thought they would be bad.
---
But that's exactly what happened.
---
Lobby dodge those toxic fuckers.
---
"At red ranks I am...inevitible."
---
I’m running my usual setup: Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, and two injured perks. It’s painful to play cause i feel like a bad person, getting hit once to get injured and vanishing just to reappear at the end opening the doors fully healed cause of adrenaline but it’s fun to play too.
---
And this is why you look both ways before crossing the street.
---
There's a reason why shes the obsession
---
Killer main, trying to play more survivor. When I wait in the gate, I know I'm safe if worst comes to worst. I leave without giving a hit because I'm scared, and never considered that the easy hit was a courtesy. Guess I'll start doing that now
---
I still don't understand when his TR goes away
---
Theres two reasons to avoid hiding in corners, killers can block you, and dwigts aswell lol
---
xD
---
Sorry to hear this man, if you don't mind me asking what killer do you play?
---
Wait what perk was that? i got hit with it as killer last week and been trying to figure out what it was ever since
---
You got me there, darn. Can we at least agree both are superior to Quentin?
---
Not typical of me but I was gonna say the same. It's just like "well done, jackass." 
---
Seriously. Take the taunts and shove them. This isn't a game where taunting is considered good form, particularly as a survivor.
---
This sub: We want Bunny Feng !
---
Me, an intellectual:
---
Some killers wont give you a chance it's fair.
---
What do you not understand? While stalking a survivor, your TR gets replaced with a horrifying siren sound
---
I've never heard of the last one.
---
It would most likely be too similar to trapper. He also would cost a lot of money for a killer so boring tbh. Also there is the point in that Friday fans already got milked out of their cash with one game so I'm not sure they'll be buying another asymmetric game just because it has Jason (and licensed killers are basically to sell game copies and to spread even more the game)
---
It’s fair but when it works, it *really* works. I’ve had games where i go and get hit straight off the bat and i’m not seen again til i leave through the exit door.
---
But in the survivor side you see It stalking and still see hia TR and Red Stain
---
Congrats on finding your first Myers collectable. 9more for shirtless Myers
---
This is a fantastic display of hardcore bunny survivor
---
Nah. I'll just be beating the shit out of some potatoes.
---
Metal Of Merde (Man)
---
Hawt
---
That's a given lol
---
Then make consumers aware and dont bait and switch. Its a dick move to say nothing then yank the rug out from underneath people and say "Ah ah ah, we never said we would do that"
---
Survivor has MoM you hit them but then blink to them right after they get away “no resurrections this time”
---
You do that. It's probably what I'll be doing I dont want to try and survive with that.
---
-10/10 you suck ggez
---
He’s good for balance but I prefer old legion to play against them the current one.
---
Sure. Have fun. 
---
Here's something--maybe see just how many status effects you can possibly stack on Survivors with a single hit. So run Sloppy Butcher too
---
*Is that your knife, Michael, or are you just happy to see us?*
---
Most likely because GhostFace isn't even in testing phase so he probably has a million bugs
---
Idk. I been having a lot of matches where I'm found first and tunneled until I die. Those perks help a little but not much if I dont have a chance to prepare.
---
Wait, you could potentially run Third Seal
---
It is gonna be a long chase, but you should not lose him/her after you got your 3 stacks.
---
That smile damned smile...
---
Ooh, Hope so, a stalking killer with huge TR and Red stain is kinda off.
---
Saving sprint burst and poss balanced landing if you want one less injured perk and you can vanish completely from the killers POV in a few seconds.
---
Bruh moment
---
That's...Not Ghostfaces motivation...
---
The original Ghostface motivation is pretty much destroy Sidneys family because Sidneys mom had an affair with the dad of the original Ghostface separating Ghostface's parents.
---
They then go on a spree and try to kill sidney/frame her dad as getting revenge because wife cheated on him.
---
The fact that his knife rises up was perfection
---
I might do a little bit of Splinter Cell Myers while I'm at it. See how many people I can put into cardiac arrest.
---
My DBD training buddies intentionally do this.
---
When I'm trying to get huntress practice in, they're practicing new ways to harass huntress players.
---
SlenderMyers
---
It’s impossible to rank up if they just do the gens and leave. So uh. Sure. Trying to pip is greedy I guess.
---
&gt; Combine that with the fact that you can deguise as a survivor and you can have some interesting mind games you can play.
---
You can't, though.
---
The moment you see a survivor working on a gen against the Disguise Killer is the moment you just walk away and find a different generator. If a survivor is running directly at you, you just stay away.
---
While that Killer is chasing you at 100% movespeed, the other survivors are working on gens. If the disguise doesn't work, the killer is a basic MS 115% killer with no power; easily loopable, easily avoided, and easily escaped from.
---
A disguising killer doesn't work in this game.
---
&gt; I think the way to have a killer who is actually multiple killers is to think of it less like a "multiple killers versus survivors" and more like "one killer who is able to swap places at predetermined locations".
---
That isn't remotely the same thing. You could easily have special lockers (or lockers in general) and get the same thing as having predetermined spots you could swap to. A Bloody Mary killer who has mirrors she can teleport between or to is completely different then 5 killers running around the map.
---
I'm not trying to sound hostile, but these two ideas just flat out don't work for the game.
---
There ya go. That would work. So: PWF, Rancor, Third Seal and one extra. We can call it the EZ mori build
---
Maybe Bamboozle as 4th?
---
ya i think the same he will have a lot of bugs the firsts days but when its fixed i think he will be a nice killer and i love ghostface and the skins that he will have
---
I mean it guarantees a Mori, I guess
---
Killer: \*Has NOED\*  
---
Survivors: \^\^\^
---
Nah. Thrill of the Hunt to protect the Seal
---
Do you see the upvote ratio between our comments?
---
They only gave us the release cycle up to a certain point, so people are just assuming.
---
I mean it is a temporary ban and whenever I played against people doing this bug they were cool with it and didn't used it to completely ruin the matches and usually farmed at the end anyway
---
Well also, his perk reduces his TR and if you stack it with Monitor and Abuse, he'll have the scariest smallest TR ever
---
Thats both terrifying and makes one feel paranoid
---
That is fair. Personally, I belive it was intentaolly..it will comne out before the chapter, and that it will be just ghostface
---
aka pre rework leigon
---
All i heard from this is that a bad experience makes it acceptable to tunnel a whole group of survivors just because of past experiences. Nice.
---
If you decide to do another, could it be claudette next? I would die from happiness if I saw my precious flower girl with cat ears and a tail (●´ω｀●)
---
I don't think I'll ever get it lol.
---
I'd have killed them both. Might've Moried the Nea. 
---
That's the only reason to bring Green Mories--to help capitalize on Obsession Perks or if you see shit like that and know that the only way to judge them is yourself.
---
I think in general most of the game (killer power, survivor/killer perks, hitboxes) need minor tweaks. While it’s in a good direction, the meta is so strong for certain killers and perks that there is little diversity, and if you choose bad perks you’re a baby, if you choose good perks you’re a scumbag. The whole game is binary- it’s shit or it’s OP.
---
Ooh message me too!
---
thanks so much and sure! its an honor &lt;3
---
Incorrect. His TR goes away when he uses the Shourd, which has a sound and lasts until someone sees him.
---
Bring ur girlfriend man, tell her when I see her 
---
Eh eh eh eh
---
Onomatopoeia
---
I still wonder what was their thought process when making this perk. "Hey, let's make this perk that mostly counters the weakest killers in the game and forces people to play meta killers even more"
---
Usually michael or pig
---
Yes, I'm already grinding BP Just to br annoying and terrifying
---
That’s a really funny glitch
---
#REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Okay that survivors monitor went out the window
---
Thanks! Gimme some tips
---
The counter play should be using your eyeballs (Or spine chill/premonition)
---
They don’t think, that’s the secret.
---
For those of you wondering: Crouching doesnt remove his TR, his ablity that makes him stleathly lasts until he isnt spotted, and stalking is faster while peeking
---
You right.
---
Now that’s a great way to stop huntress hatches... to never let her get any at all. That’s pretty funny and now o shall live in the locker when against a huntress.
---
No?, but they are often a priority since I have vision on them.
---
Play With Your Food is kind of like this, except it depends on you actually finding your obsession, and is far too easily lost (*any* offensive action loses a token, and not just successful hits/grabs). Far too much effort is wasted and it doesn't give enough payoff to be useful.
---
Tell him man
---
Who do you think we, the dead by daylight survivor community, are? Geniuses? Get your damn techno babble out of here.
---
And someone knows something about it will be only a killer dlc or it will have a survivor too
---
Thanks, dad.
---
Y E S W E N E E D T H I S !
---
Its meant to be there as a warning, like how you can hear Wraiths bell, or how Freddy has his lullby. 
---
Espcally since by the look of it, consdering hes in DARK ropes he wont be easy to spot, espcally when crouching and using his sthealth.
---
Wait, thats a Guy cowering behind David? He is not kicking a Football? My entire life is a lie...
---
When you kite the whole game, your team gets all the gens done, exitgates open with teammates teabagging while you are being facecamped by a wraith with 1 perk and 0 add-ons and your team doesn't rescue you and die from the endgame collapse.
---
Long, I know, but that is basically DbD in a nutshell.
---
Spine chill is underrated
---
Don’t run noed
---
Epic
---
Devs: We're designing game around fun factor.  
---
Also devs: feel frustrated during this action, lol.
---
Yep, or just try not to get to high ranks
---
"He CaNt StOp SuRviVoRs At GaTeS"
---
Someone clearly hurt you as a child to be so upset over a video game. Wasn't trying to BM just found it amusing that the killer swung past me, acknowledged he had done so with the head shake. Even messaged them afterwards and they to found it amusing. In the future try not to get so emotionally invested in pixels to the extent that when they don't go your way you spew non sensical hate.
---
A bad experience?
---
More like multitude of bad experiences.
---
I mean, isn't that exactly how Dying Light works though? Kill one survivor, and not only cut their resources down by 1/4th but slow them all down by 25%. 4% per person, but generic vs. 25% for one specific one sounds relatively fair.
---
cat feng!
---
Sorta but play with your food also helps in the chase.
---
No worries son. Now do something productive before I beat you again
---
I had a survivor tell me to quit protecting my totem. I told him to stop dcing lol..
---
But the stealth only last for 5 seconds I believe, so getting the timing to get the jump on the survivors without them noticing. While also being close, but not close enough to be in the terror radius before activating it seems very tricky.
---
It's not a steam exlcusive lol

There isn't too much to rate since the M1illy was pretty trash and you were obviously better than him
---
Only if there was a way for her to refill them 🤔
---
No, it’s pretty popular. But lullaby is too vulnerable and needs stacks to be good, whereas Ruin works from the start of the game
---
Koochie posting jumping from shitpostcrusaders, to shitpostbydaylight.
---
I did this, i got chewed out by my team. Rightfully deserved :(
---
I haven't seen that once and I've watched him for almost two years.
---
Try throwing on whispers.. that helps a lot. If anything just gen patrol. Youll eventually find someone. Play hag and put traps everywhere. It all comes with time and experience.
---
honestly if someone ever does that to you just DC, especially if they have an item. if they're gonna be a prick then no point in sticking around. games already over if 2 people are sitting in a corner blocking a 3rd person anyway.
---
Aww, that cute face! This is great :D
---
I’d love to get only leatherfaces
---
Mettle of Man, the current number 1 BS perk for M1 killers to deal with specially against SWF but playing solo it's a life saver from hook farmers.
---
and just to rub it in, before you ask, im a killer main
---
Really? Whys that? I dont think I'll ever speak that sentence in my life haha
---
*nea and the pussycats*
---
He’s weak af and just looks funny as hell to me lol
---
There's already a reply that claims the exact same thing, which was why we got to 'tilting' in the first place. Perhaps learn to read babe.
---
As a victim and perpatrater I can confirm 100%
---
My thing is Dwight I always have problems with dwights. Fuck Dwight
---
Oh no, 1 place with double pallets, whatever will i do?
---
SWF communicates the location of a killer. who'd have seen that coming!  
---
But the whole point of a The Thing-esque killer is it's formless. There's a million ways you could have a shapeshifting killer interact with stuff in DBD if you don't assume that that the only power he could have is turning into a survivor and doing literally nothing.
---
MOM encourages tunneling off hook though.
---
I wish, at the very least, **default** and **default P3** would also be considered outfits.
---
It's more rare for me to find a leatherface that doesnt want to watch me die right before his eyes but I did get one leatherface that was playing without facecamping. Usually I see at least a few other killers tho so I thought it was weird
---
Switchin to fists
---
I guess... but no one was willing to get close enough to run around me for chaser points anyway. They would slowly walk into my view, but far away enough (about 24m) that they could emote/dash for an exit. It’s just this one claudette was audacious enough to go for a chest. I don’t think i would have even known if not for the noises... These guys were probably more concerned about getting an escape than ranking up anyway. (And honestly I don’t think anyone should be concerned about ranking up unless they haven’t done it once for the achievement). Maybe I shouldn’t have used the word greedy though.
---
Eh, I disagree
---
just for having the perk, no , they're not toxic. Now if they have a purple flashlight with the best addons, tbag after every pallet, and dancing at the gate at the end of the game, then hell yeah, toxic
---
