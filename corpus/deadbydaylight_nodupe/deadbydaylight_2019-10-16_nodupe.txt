demogorgon is an inter-dimensional alien with an absurd amount of strength and desire to kill. it would easily maul pig, legion, ghostface, nurse, hag and maybe wraith. i could imagine myers, trapper, billy, bubba, huntress, clown, and doctor putting up a decent fight, but the demogorgon is too powerful for most human killers. spirit and freddy are different. if freddy is in his dreamworld he has full control but since i doubt the demogorgon sleeps, i would say freddy would lose too. spirit is already dead and may make some progress with her phasewalk but the demogorgon could probably just tear her apart
---
Save the best for last, Pop goes the Weasle, Make your choice. Don't even main demo but those perks are perfect for him.
---
Plunderers instinct. Need I say any more?
---
I really want add ons that increase the charging speed of his shock therapy. Either that, or make its base version faster. I‚Äôd also like it if the range add ons didn‚Äôt slow down its charge speed. It‚Äôs a nerf they give you that I feel is unnecessary.
---
It‚Äôs actually got the least amount of pallets.
---
Just overall what made me switch from killer to survivor is the constant harassment. I rather play a survivor more often then killer now.
---
what res you play on?
---
Man I wish, I love the character but until he gets buffs I just want to rip my hair out
---
That Dead Hard saved your life there. I wonder what happened to the other Survivors still left there...
---
spine chill
---
Nothing too great tbh, the one with most potential is Faust vault from any direction, seem strong af but the cool down balances it out.
---
there is no second hit, you wait 15 seconds while they run around like an idiot and hit them after.

Bamboozle didn't exist at the time

At least he didn‚Äôt DC.
---
You can decisive strike killer if they are within 1/2/20 meters of you while it's active.
---
The god damn queue times are what make me want to play Survivor more, not much else.
---

---
Good god, even below 15 the queue times are ridiculous, and when you  accidentally let it slip to 16+ because you just didn't feel like playing for a month or two it's like 20 minutes to get into a game....
---
People who still run instead of crouch for unhooks when they know it's a hag: ü§°ü§°

Pretty sure that it keeps you at two.

I'm open to being wrong though.
---
Ding ding ding
---
Freddy or Michael. No one else stands a chance to be honest. Especially if Freddy has everyone in his dream world but some killers may not sleep so I'd have to go with the slasher king, Myers.
---
Oof, David could've just saved the whole situation in the beginning by healing Ace immediately right?
---
Its kinda the same for both actually but works in reverse.
---
You thibk that killers are rewarded for bring deranked into potato leagues but thats just high ranks. The low skill low rank killers now have 4 high rank survivors that were deranked into their game.
---
Survivors in high rank now have shit teammates, but low rank survivors have high skill teammates.

The killer perks are not that bad. Balanced landing is a GOod survivor perk, but I don't think anyone should buy it because it's a free perk and also is kinda map dependent . Open handed is just useless in MY opinion.

I had the idea to make this pack because I have recently introduced a few of my friends to the game. When we play SWF or KYF, it's tedious for them to read through every perk while trying to understand their function or synergy.
---
I have sorted perks to the best of my ability and hope that the influx of new players can utilize this. I also chose to keep the design minimal for legibility in the perk menu.
---
**I understand there is some subjectivity with perk functions and I would be happy to answer any questions about my choices**.
---
If anyone would like to collaborate on a similarly styled killer pack, or like to help me improve the design of the current pack, please shoot me a PM.
---
I know but just standing their waiting until she was at the edge was toxic
---
Upvoted for one of my favorite films.
---
The mirage of dead by daylight
---
Spirit Fury, Balanced Landing, Unnerving, and Open-Handed. Oh, boy.
---
Get balanced landing if you‚Äôre a survivor and spirit fury if you‚Äôre a killer
---
I feel that if you play one side exclusively, you become very resentful of the opposite side. 
---
I know now that when I do certain things playing survivor I will absolutely get backlash from the killer, such as using a flashlight as they break a pallet. 
---
On the flip side when I am killer I know what behavior will trigger the survivors as well. (I mori‚Äôd a survivor directly in front of a survivor in the first phase on hook to assert dominance). 
---
When I do these things I absolutely expect the behavior I receive but I don‚Äôt get mad about it, because I know if I had played ‚Äúnicely‚Äù it would have been easier.
---
man this is the best costume i have seen bruh i should get my 3 friends this and we go out XD
---
Alright guys what are worth picking up this week???
---
Nah balance landing is definitely worth getting.
---
Now this, this is a man of culture.
---
Yes I'm serious.
---
Playing against Spirit 9 times *in the raw*
---
Why you have mettle of man in 2019 is a better question
---
Encountered the same thing earlier myself. I assumed I had misread the offering somehow since I still played as Leather Face but had Freddy on my main screen just like you did and was actually able to queue as Freddy (only tried one game but it kept him on the screen) until I selected a new killer. The lock symbol is still on his face except apparently I had enough blood points to get his blood web to level 3 before our brief encounter ceased.
---
It threw me for a loop since I expected to spawn in as Freddy the round I played the offering so I felt it had to have not worked until I was surprised seeing him waiting there (as shown in your clip) at the selection screen after the match ended.
---
Spirit Fury, maybe if you don't get Balanced.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Other than that, Unnerving and Open-handed are both not worth it.
---
LOL I love Trapper
---
whole some
---
*May cause sodium poisoning*
---
Absolutely yes. Survivors who never play killer or rarely play and at only low ranks have no idea of the amount of bullshit survivors do to killers.
---
They will do something completely dumb like insta save before you can walk away two feet and then cry about tunneling. They will all swarm a hook and then say you camped. 
---
I admit it feels nice to out juke a killer a long time but I always end up feeling bad about it afterwards. It sucks that one semi skilled person who knows the map and loops rotation can waste so much time that the entire game is nearly finished. 
---
I have a lot more respect for killers when I play survivor now that I‚Äôve played killer more and more and try not to be toxic even if we destroyed them. It‚Äôs 100x easier to be a survivor when you‚Äôre in high ranks and very stressful as killers which is why there is soooo many more survivor mains then killers. Survivors get praised for being toxic and bullying but the second you do anything toxic as a killer (tunnel for instance) you get tons of hate. The double standard is dumb. I encourage all survivors to start grinding out killer ranks and see how they feel at the end. It really does change your perspective.
---
Sweet, does every survivour get a Mori?
---
I love how he complains about a show he hasn't watched and then asks who a character is that only makes sense in the context of the show.

---
Im not sure im on ps4
---
Definitely yes. When I play survivor, I never get mad at the killer for tunneling or camping. Why? Because I understand it‚Äôs necessary in some situations, and I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice myself for my team to get out.
---
The same is true when I play killer. I don‚Äôt get mad at survivors for gen rushing or looping because I do the same exact thing when I play survivor.
---
I play on Xbox1, so BM'ing is something I haven't seen. Both sides of Killers and Survivors tend to be relatively non-toxic, or if any it's the minimal stuff that nobody would waste time messaging about. However, I tend to keep Rank 10 and under for both Killer and Survivor.
---
As for gameplay, I actively adjust my playstyle for it to be the most fun for the other Survivors or the Killer. I want games to be fair and fun for everyone, so if that means I don't get a 3-4K as Killer because I left the hook far to kick gens and give them a chance to regroup, I think it's worth it! Or if the killer is being looped by another survivor, I'll swoop in to try to take the chase on my own style so the survivor can recover and the killer is challenged by a different person to mindgame, even if I don't survive from it! It's all well worth it to know I could've made it an especially fun game for everyone else!

Trapper that's not how poker works.

Hi, new player here, is Spirit fury whort?

What killers use it better?

Legions packing more than teenage angst in that suit...

Reminds me of the survivor who once complained about me ‚Äúspamming‚Äù snares as Freddy lol
---
why is your game so saturated?
---
I pray for Susie bro...
---
I wonder what the outfit will be called. I'm guessing they'll either mention how simplistic it is, or how he stole it from a halloween store or something.
---
Yeah kyf has alot of issues getting into on console usually what me and my friends do is Just reset dbd and it most of the time works if not then we just gave up.
---
Using your power? TOXIC.

Who says that isnt susie...
---
Biology
---
From my experience it doesn‚Äôt work with it.
---
doesn‚Äôt work with mending
---
Dbd gone wild says otherwise lol
---
I've really wanted a mori option in the store for a long time. It's just another great way to individualize each killer.
---
Having a mori like that for every killer would be legendary, imagine ghost face hitting the woah right before he stabs you in the kidney

The thing about dead hard with me is I will usually only try to use it when I know they are swinging. This has led to multiple occasions where I go down but I still get the exhaustion effect.
---
These are really good bro, I wish I could draw like that
---
Actually seems like a lot of fun.
---
Nope, description says healing for a reason
---
You load into a game, and this is what you see. What do you do?
---
Exactly. Especially the original Three which all have basically the same Mori. They're in desperate need of a new one
---
All it takes is practice to develop hand eye coordination. If you really want to draw, id suggest doing contours. They're continuous line drawings where you don't look at the paper, keep your eye on an object and keep your pen on the paper.
---
It got me started :)

---
Exactly. Adept Survivor for example just requires escaping. You don't have to do anything at all Beyond Live. You can do nothing for your team and take the hatch. Which is yet another reward for the survivors failing due to the fact that they no longer have to do any generators for it.
---
Meanwhile Adept killer requires a minimum of two Pips, 9-10 hooks, winning most of your choices and not losing sight on survivors. Holding the generators to at least 7 minutes. And more than likely a 4K unless you're playing a killer that gets great deviousness and brutality.
---
All while using their three teachables which are more often than not useless for that killer. Try getting Adept Huntress at rank one with those awful perks.
---
&gt;Nurse does not have good map travel compared to Spirit
---
What the fuck are you talking about, map mobility is nurses strong suit and one of spirits weaknesses. An Omega blink nurse can cross any map in like 5 seconds.
---
Me and the boys played against a Demi the other night. As I completed the last gen and my friend adrenalined away I watched the demi just stand there after downing nobody he whole trial. Made me feel awful how sad he looked. I felt like I‚Äôd been party to bullying someone just trying to have some fun. In fact I haven‚Äôt put my survivor pants on since that match. The matchmaking system is not fit for purpose in any shape or form.
---
Nope. I notice the same. You think once all those perks are bought and now you only have items to appear, you'd get a lot more rares. But it's not the case. Sucks. Even prestige 3 doesn't make a difference.
---
Fuck insta heals, Keys, vouce comms, BNPs and Map offerings :)
---
Can you give me the link to the skin
---
I found a way to consistently do this but decided against posting it until I have all my teachables in-case it gets patched. Add the offering at 6s left and after the game you get to play as Freddy/Myers/Pig/Bubba for until you close the game or switch him out. I got Freddy's teachables by doing it and I believe it is a glitch caused by dedicated servers.
---
Remember when people thought dedicated servers would fix this?

I've been running a meme-y Babysitter build: Distortion + Babysitter. Not great but fun.

I just realized today that after the Undetectable buff for stealth killers Babysitter is going to be an even bigger dumpster fire. Not that I don't think the Undetectable buff isn't good for the game but my man Steve over here...
---
Balanced landing and spirits fury are great, but personally, I would just save up and either buy the spirit, or level up mea and buy another survivor.

Only problem with Cypress being default is decisive Strike being extremely clutch in the end game specifically

You say "endgame camper" like the killer has any reason to leave after the exit gates are opened

Step 1: Download a Perk Pack; I recommend going to the Subreddit called ‚Äúperks by daylight‚Äù (can‚Äôt say in r/ format due to possible advertising flags)
---
Step 2: unzip the zip file.
---
Step 3: replace all photos of perks or whatever u want to keep in your game in your steam apps &gt; common &gt; dead by daylight &gt; deadbydaylight &gt; content &gt; ui &gt; icons &gt; (ur choice, perks, powers, items, etc) &gt; and replace all png AND ONLY PNG files with your new snazzy custom ones.

Tadaaa
---

---
Open handed on scratch mirror myers too
---
No point in balanced since it's with a base survivor anyway, dedinitely worth it to just unlock it in the bloodweb.
---
It doesn't sound like a moan but it IS funny
---
I think projection would be cool, because it seems like a good perk, and maybe something could finally replace some meta perks in some red rank survivor builds. Personally I would love to see a change in survivor perk meta.
---
No DC sound, I know circumstances say intentional but could've been a legit crash?
---
Some of these aren't necessarily ones I'd actually use, I just think it's nice to have the option. For example, I'm not sure why you'd want to disable Killer Powers, but it's more just about giving people the choice. The only examples I can *maybe* think of is potentially disabling killer powers in order to run training sessions as a killer where you're just trying to get good at them without the power, and don't want to accidentally M2? Other than that, nothing, but who knows, people can maybe think of something
---
This is actually really freaking good, bravo my friend! Although I would have liked the brute to be the killer since I find him to be the scarier of the gatherers, but hey, good job regardless.
---
Damn. Just my luck. When I had a perk in bloodweb, I had 3 insta heal purple bottles in my web. 200k BP'S later with no perks, I've gotten a lot of bad items.
---
Dude, Trapper *requires* you to understand how Survivors think and playing high ranking Trapper pretty much means that you have to be able to play Survivor at a high rank as well.
---
Trapper is a lot harder to play than something like Billy or Huntress.
---
If Freddy can get them into the dream world then it‚Äôs over especially if just hitting them get them into it like in the game
---
Change Moris to fatality type things that have no effect on gameplay and then sure, add all the Moris you want.
---
Also I don‚Äôt use and never have used insta heals, keys, or BNP‚Äôs. (Insta heals are being removed already btw)
---
Map offerings can go either way for killer or survivor.
---
But as it stands now, Mori‚Äôs are stupid for balance, fun, and bloodpoint gain.
---
So again, fuck Moris, big no.
---
Enduring Spirit Fury, here we go boys.
---
"Why am I always the obsession" Starter pack
---
But that's go completely against his character
---
Spirit fury is not bad but outshined by other perks. Works well if you like to disrespect pallets and can be used well on m1 killers. Pig and wraith come to mind haven‚Äôt used it enough to give a concrete opinion so test it with some friends in a custom and see if it fits.

---
I have never seen a survivor successfully use MoM against me, but if i did, i would just be shocked. Ever since the rework, it‚Äôs super rare to see anyone even run it in the first place. Nice play!
---
I laughed out loud
---
The fucking madlad she finally escaped the entire game
---
Well put together as I add nothing. Just wanted to take note
---
Only when you stop doing 4 man swf and you all have ds deliverance dead hard iron will and instaheals or flashlights
---
i managed to get out but my boy dwight ran in the opposite direction lol, he didnt make it :(
---
AKA tunneling amirite
---
ye endgame camping, its a thing my G.
---
It‚Äôs a meme meant no toxicity.
---
i always use DS. i have for months.
---
how do you effectively use it? well, it works best for if you're getting tunneled. if you get unhooked and the killers not coming for you yet, but they eventually do come for you, try to get downed before the timer runs out. then you can use it and escape. i use Unbreakable to combat those that slug me in this scenario.
---
but my biggest reason for using DS is to escape (the game). all the gens are done, the gates are open, but you made a dumb mistake or got unlucky and now ur on the hook. the killer wants to secure the kill but u finally get unhooked. the killer immediately goes for you though, or gets you right by the exit gate. easy. DS outta that situation and ur out
---
Damn....lol I knew where that was going (obvi), but 10/10 story telling skills!!!!! Lol
---
Nice! you also included the counterplay options here!
---
Cuz all survivors do that...
---
I was a survivor main for the first year and a half.  Then I was half and half.  For the past several months I've been a killer main.
---
Both sides can play cheesy and be annoying.  Gen rushing and tunneling are real and can make games unenjoyable.  
---
Tunneling feels worse though.  If an equally skilled killer wants you dead.  You're dead.  You can leave a game with 6k BP and no stacks.  As killer if survivors gen rush and do their worst, I'm still going to hit 20k and a couple stacks.
---
So is it worth it?
---
going after a single survivor only the entire match is failing at your objective since there are also three other survivors you need to kill. I‚Äôve seen many killers get looped for 5 gens and get no kills simply bc they want to tunnel one person for some reason
---
Yes

---
Except syringe is neither instant nor a full health heal anymore. It‚Äôs one state over 8 seconds. You could still use it on a downed person, but you‚Äôd need to distract the killer successfully. If they pick the downed survivor up, it cancels.

Sorry. It was a quick look. I fixed it tho. :)

As long as you don‚Äôt get grabbed off the hook!
---
Theres no confirmation of this, dont just give him a random answer lol
---
Well the devs said there was also there was a image of a upcoming blood hunt
---
Called changing the gamma, which is totally using mechanics outside of the game to gain an unfair advantage, i.e. Cheating. You should be banned for posting this.
---
*over a year~*
---
Bout to head out
---
You're a wizard, Claudette.
---
I think the syringes will be fine as they‚Äôre listed on the PTB. The effect gets cancelled upon a health state change or a pickup. The Styptic Agent add-on is definitely going to be good for making plays though.
---
Aren't those all survival events?
---
Imo trapper has close to nurses skill required to play well, and nowhere near nurses lethality
---
Wait a minute, after analyzing the video further, you also have 0 fog effects... This looks like more than just gamma adjustment...
---
Devs didnt say anything but there was a leaked banned with it for halloween. Theyve cancelled/delayed bloodhunts before, so its best not to give a definitive answer until a dev actually says something
---
then survivors would never get away
---
Wouldn't say that, you'd need 800k bloodpoints to get a survivor to lv30, and by that point, you probably already have 2k shards from the grind, or even more. I bought it right away just so I can spend my bloodpoints on a survivor I'll actually be using.
---
You can't see Claud, everyone knows this.
---
Activate Ghostface
---
Tunneling is focusing only on one person for the whole game and usually means you don‚Äôt 4K if the other three are doing gens the whole time.
---
It's because of the Hag's map pressure. When you play the Hag, you could either set them down in places where survivors are most likely to run or you could place them in a little web to lock down a large area of the map. The way I play Hag is whenever a trap is triggered I almost always teleport to it to create the maximum map pressure, and about 85% of the time it's a different survivor who triggers it so I just keep teleporting and hitting the survivors to gain STBFL stacks a little faster.

Base Power either needs a few buffs if he's going to stick with a single thing or make him the next Ghostface/Freddy/Demogorgon/Etc. with a double power.
---
Direct bottle hits need to be more potent then just extra blurring.
---
Add something to the power like staying in gas clouds fill a circle around the players icon on the HUD that intensifies the Slow and Blur the more it's filled.
---
Fingerless Parade Gloves &amp; Sticky Soda Bottle become base power.

I never said killers aren't faster than survivors on average. I said when clown is in his throwing animation, he is slower than survivors for a few seconds than goes back to 115%. If you hit rank 2 without using your ability, you got lucky and went against a string of consistently bad survivors or proved that the survivor side is too easy to rank up in.
---
Theres many different reasons and they depend on the circumstances. I dont like leveling too fast so I tend to even let 2 live sometimes and just do the last gens and leave, sometimes if I see someone get sandbagged I'll let them leave as well. Just different reasons depending on the situation but mostly to be nice.

The saddest part is, as a returning player from 2017, my killer is rank 14 now. But when I was at 20-16 the queue literally took anywhere from 5-20 minutes. So to make matters worse he probably waited forever for that game, only to get stomped and not pip. So he‚Äôll still be stuck in matchmaking hell
---
I had found out only a few weeks ago Iron Maiden has a person it and isn‚Äôt just a bunch of squiggly lines
---
iron will does remove your BREATHING and CHARACTER'S noises entirely while injured, that is not me making something up to make it sound better, that is what it does and i know this because i use it all the time as do many other high level survivors. because it's a good perk. i understand why you keep dogging all these perks that you've never played before because you don't know the extent they can be used but even for spine chill there is much more than just knowing when the killer is coming that the perk can do for you. that really has nothing to do with the perks being bad, it has to do with you not knowing how to use them to their full advantage. like you aren't going to just happen to stumble upon someone competently using iron will. that's bs, they're not going to be sitting in some corner waiting for you to find them, they're going to actively be moving. that's one thing you keep assuming wrong, that i play stealthy, really i spend my matches destroying hooks to grab the killer's attention and then throw him into chases, and unhook people in between. that's how i know these perks work for a non stealthy approach but what do i know right?
---
Don't expect Nancy's or Steve's perks to be so soon on the shrine. They want everyone to buy the dlc.
---
That was absolutely beautiful.
---
Thank you.
---
I tried it in like 10 games and didn't work once.
---
I was so mad, cause all those time i went into struggle.
---
That‚Äôs the type of shit I would do
---
If you do something that I deem ‚Äúcute‚Äù and you weren‚Äôt an asshole all match, I‚Äôll let you live. 
---
If 2 people DC and I‚Äôm feeling patient, I‚Äôll farm with the other 2 and let them live. 
---
If you played well, I‚Äôll let you live. 
---
&amp; sometimes I just like to let people go no matter what happened in match, just feels nice.
---
I don't want to pip to quickly is my main reason. Unless I am in a ticked off mood like I was last night with my Iridescent/Belt/Ebony (not a one walked away from that lol) but if I am going to town and knocking everyone down constantly, I'd say I had my fill and did my job so letting one go is fine.
---
As a rank 2 that's a lie. Killers. Are. Faster. If a killer tunnels a survivor before he can find a good pallet/jungle gym he's going down. I've played with rank 1s that go down eventually due to map exhaustion. You clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
Take it back now y'all

He's already fast af boiiii

welcome to r/deadbydaylight, please laugh at the funny girl pointing at cat meme for the 19th time

My current build for Freddy is Save the Best For Last, Discordance, Tinkerer, and Pop Goes the Weasel. The way I play him is to make the most of his ability to teleport to gens, so by using Discordance and Tinkerer, I'll know when to teleport to gens and which one to teleport to so I can kick it with Pop Goes the Weasel. 
---
As for the snares or pallets debate, I'd personally choose the snares because I feel like when you use the dream pallets and the survivors have the map they're playing on and the tiles they're playing with in-game memorized, the dream pallets become a little bit easier to play around than the snares. Plus the snares actually synergize really well with Save the Best For Last, slowing down the survivor's movement speed plus a faster cooldown can be pretty deadly.
---
Some other perks that work great on him are as follows:
---
BBQ + Chili and Hex: Ruin (Because what killer are these perks not good on?)
---
Dying Light, Remember Me, Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, and Hex: Huntress Lullaby (For a little extra game slowage. Freddy does have some addons that synergize well with these perks and could make for a brutal game slowage build.)
---
Brutal Strength and Enduring (Since Freddy has both the snares and the dream pallets, these perks can help him in the anti-looping section. By using the snares, you'll be able to both slow down survivors at loops and tear through pallets easily. If you choose to use dream pallets instead of snares, these perks can also be a benefit to you as you are able to both tear through real pallets easily while at the same time make survivors play the guessing game and guess which pallets are real or fake.)
---
Rancor and Thrilling Tremors (These also help you gain some knowledge on which generators survivors are working on. By a generator getting completed with Rancor or by simply picking up a downed survivor with Thrilling Tremors, you'll be able to know the locations of the survivors and which gen they're doing, if any at all.)
---
Did you escape?

The basement was right there fam...
---
*reverse card*
---
whats next?, I‚Äôm I not going to be able to instantly heal in the middle of a chase? ya right
---
If you haven‚Äôt ever used them try getting a pair of Control Freaks and play with those. I never play without them now.
---
I will never understand why survivors don‚Äôt just leave at the end if they‚Äôve already won...why be a douche? unless the killer was camping all match or something
---
Dead Hard x Lightweight
---
You'll get bloodpoints if you buy a perk from the shrine you already have
---
Spirit's Fury is one of the most meta perks combined with Enduring for almost every killer, so I'd get that if youre not gonna level or buy spirit
---
I could really use a save right now, save right now.
---
Datamined from the PTB along with a matching Julie skin
---
You gotta light attack the chest before you open it
---
I've got a pair, yeah. Still doesn't fix the issue, but hey Huntress is pretty fun to play ever since I got 'em
---
I see. This guy was odd, however. He was playing ghost face, and although I only had one gen left, he got me. I was playing Ash, and I have the sneaking suspicion he knew I was using Flip Flop, because when he picked me up he just walked in circles until I could wiggle free. As soon as I did so, he ran away from me. I of course, wanting the game to end, chases after him. Wellp, he led me to the gate. He stood there, staring, as if to say to open it. So I did, and as soon as the doors swung open, he stabbed me. Much to my surprise, he carried me over to the exit, like right where you can actually leave, and let me wiggle free again. It was weird.
---
Damn you went all in thanks once I unlock all the perks I‚Äôll make sure to try these
---
Yes, October 22nd and it's been renamed. But you no longer collect vials from the flowers, you just do gens as survivor. Killer is the same as before as well, just hooks gives you your points
---
I feel this deserves more praise than it is getting.
---
And BMing Susie, of all people. She already doesn't want to be here...
---
He has the right to be angry. You can destroy a killers perks (ex. Demogorgon) but still have a good killer bc of his kit. Survivors have no kit. Only cosmetics. In the sence of owning something using that chatacters perks, especially with a proclaimed chatacter like ash himself, you too would want his perks too be good otherwise he's seen as "that dude with shit perks"

So, out of curiosity, what do you deem "cute?" When a survivor is obviously lost or can‚Äôt hit the skill checks or something?
---
He‚Äôs a phantom
---
Thx man, GL and I hope you like Freddy as much as I do. :)
---
Question about the hatch- how soon can the Killer see the hatch? Can they see it from start, or once survivors have n+1 gens finished/sole survivor?
---
It always seems like they know exactly where it is when it comes to a sole survivor.
---
You are the hacker, not him.
---
step one: place bear trap on head of Survivor
---
step two: wait for activation
---
step three: trap them in a corner and crouch, cause their trap timer to tick down
---
step four : profit
---
The less clothes a killer has, the better they are. 
---
Survivors can‚Äôt run AND vault with only one hand.

10/10 best angry post game I've seen in a while.
---
(And that includes the person who added me yesterday to complain that I downed them at the start of the match.)
---
A few years back it could let you see inside the locker because of a glitch with the animation
---
no one thought this. dedicated servers doesn't even relate to the match making. I don't seriously need to explain to you what a dedicated server is needed for right?
---
As a killer main I‚Äôd actually prefer if a survivor blinds me at a pallet I can still hear you and you don‚Äôt get as much distance
---
Although I don't agree with the premise of this post, you're not wrong about DH and the fact you got so many downvotes shows how out of touch the player base is with the meta.
---
You cant outplay DH because it's a burst of speed, NOT a dodge move (although it can be used as one against bad killers). If I'm running straight to a pallet, and I wont make it normally, a DH will lunge me forward enough to beat you to it and proceed with the loop as normal. People seem to think that you have to wait for the killer to swing first (which would allow it to be baited) but that is irrelevant because DH moves you faster than the killer, making a killer swing irrelevant if the speed boost will get you to the pallet.
---
DH and SB are top 2 for general use exhaustion perks with DH being the best  
---
BL has the most potential but should only be used with map offerings like Strode Keys (borderline broken)
---
Lithe should really only be used if you wanna run Dance With Me
---
Can't say I haven't been there
---
Wiggling and DC seem survival category and the other 2 Boldness. If they are all Survival it will be even better though and i think DC's should be 1000 BP and they should also add BP for Struggling(like wiggling) and maybe Recovery.
---
Hey if you are not gonna reduce the grind(New Bloodweb is better but still not enough) at least give us more BP easier that's another way to do it. With the Archives which give also Bonus BP maybe it's time to make the Cap 1.5-2M.
---
No there were people that thought when dedicated servers came that it would also make finding balanced matches either, but thanks for being a cunt for no reason anyway.
---
I just choked on my soup
---
You purchase the "battle pass" with 1000 Auric Cells. There's not sort of direct payment to purchase it. If you now have 1000 Auric Cells you can unlock it when it comes out.
---
lightweight and iron will make it significantly easier to run very long loops especially on indoor maps with many tight corners like the game and lery's. the idea is to use lightweight to confuse the killer and get away for just long enough to get to the next pallet or loop, i don't use it so that i can never be found and i don't expect to use it to get away for good most of the time. my goal is to buy myself enough time to keep hitting new loops, and after the killer gives up and goes somewhere else, to start doing some more noisy altruism/boldness actions until the killer comes back and i start again. i really only hit generators if i max out boldness/altruism and want some more points on the side. the build works quite well and if i screw up and get caught it's usually because i did something stupid rather than the perk/lack of a certain perk causing it. also while i have been praising spine chill i usually don't actually use it, i was just saying that between spine chill and adrenaline i would certainly rather have spine chill
---
Thank you. I was scared shitless when I realized I may have acted too quickly.
---
Your comment makes no sense. If survivors have no kit then their perks shouldn't matter anyways. Mettle of Man was broken as fuck and had no in game counter play. It deserves to be destroyed just like Legion's moonwalking did. Everything should have counter play. Deal with it.
---
Suck it bitch. Ash deserves good perks
---
Literally had the same happen to me yesterday with dream pallets. The best thing was the dude kept running to the same area of the map and just used pallets he had triggerd before, then waited at least 5 minutes to complain about me spamming "Op pallet replacements".
---
Wimp
---
As a killer you can avoid giving people protection hits, but unless you're an ass you can't really avoid safe unhooks. It becomes the same issue that it takes no killer input to get free extra hits, they just punish killers for playing normally and NOT being a dick.
---
Mettle of Man on release was bad for the game. Sorry not sorry it got dumpstered.

I fully agree, it wouldn't be anything hard to implement either it's a small change
---
Yes to both. Also if you‚Äôre trying to hide in a very obvious spot. When injured survivors just stop and stare at you (no pointing, no beckoning) just stare up at you, I can‚Äôt kill them after that. But I don‚Äôt know sometimes it can be something as simple as throwing down a pallet early, it just all depends.
---
But I‚Äôm a softie and I know it. I‚Äôve had people stop mid chase and point at the closed exit gates and I just can‚Äôt kill them after that.
---
I love a 4K but I also like making people feel good and I know I appreciate it so much when a killer lets me go so it feels good to do it for others.
---
Do you have a killer main? There are a few things some killers can do to end a loop faster, but it depends on the killers.
---
I feel like a lot of killers opt for your fourth reason. I see so much silly shit sometimes in-game, it‚Äôs amazing.  Bless you.
---
survivors while ‚Äúrushing‚Äù: *doing a gen, literally not moving, not teabagging, not flashlight clicking*

Please keep going.
---
I was enjoying that way too much
---
All groups are SWF groups... until they aren't
---
Which actually doesn't work unless the game BPS you to title screen
---
Just ignore my Spanish noises
---
Shes Chinese
---
that is a good point ya it should be like that honestly and with dedicated servers coming that could very well be possible
---
IMO a protection hit should be whenever you take a hit within 4 meters of a survivor or get hit whenever they are being carried
---
I‚Äôll let anyone survive if they offer me an item and do the funny looking head nod while crouched
---
I've seen worse, more so just a straight gen rush.
---
I want to strangle you with your intestines
---
Cuz all huntresses use iridescent.
---
In fact, I‚Äôd say with 100% confidence, finding a match against a iri huntress is a lot more rare than finding a swf team that becomes a nightmare unless you go full out 
---
I play more survivor than I do killer, and even I come across more swf teams with all the gimmicks than I ever have iri huntresses.
---
Hell I‚Äôll even include eboni moris and I‚Äôd still wager I find more of the sweaty swf.
---
Which once again, is pretty crazy considering I play more survivor on average (maybe 3-6 games per 1 killer match) so I even upped the odds for this argument but still find more swf teams like this
---
Haha it does look like Rosie the Riveter
---
They‚Äôll drop whatever item they have on the ground in front of you as an ‚Äúoffering‚Äù.
---
I kinda suck sometimes so I've had to force myself to consider the aim of the game to die less quickly and get my heart pounding more. And if I depip enough, I will end up in low ranks and be the absolute champion of the game.
---
How sweet. Can the killer pick it up?
---
I already got BBQ, Ruin,  save the best for last and play with your food. Idk if that torrents skipping a few killers.
---
I herd, but nurse is getting nerfed
---
Yeah I know, but saying all huntresses run iri head and all swf are toxic is just not a fair analysis. I play both killer and survivor so I‚Äôm trying to be as unbiased as possible.
---
Hey, I wouldn't be so bad having a "chameleon" killer, like have him imitate other survivors, and have like a transformation form.
---
Monto on youtube does random perk builds all the time and this is one of them. He called it Houdini if you wanna check it out.
---
No but I kinda wish we could. Not to use but that way it doesn‚Äôt go to waste. Personally I am with this guy so if a survivor does this I‚Äôll let them live but at the same time i feel bad that they lost whatever item they dropped.
---
Its hardly a nerf. Omega blink is gone and so is five blink nurse. But nurse is still really powerful
---
My most memorable was getting a 4k, 32,000 BP game without noed or ruin against swf.
---
Was still called trash bad terrible killer.

About Spine Chill,this conversation had derived so much from what it was originally although we did cover what it was about.

for killer changes specifically, they probably want to just do it all at once, take Nurse for example, they could've easily just tweaked numbers on omegablink, but instead went for reworking like every single add-on in 1 go.
---
Not to mention patches aren't exactly simple and easy things to do, especially if you're not a AAA first party company with infinite money and resources. So getting as much done for a killer as possible in 1 go would probably be best especially if it turns out something might need tweaking through a hotfix or because it was found in the PTB
---
Probably
---
Oh no, you have to wait one more second to use your blink. How tragic
---
Run whispers
---
I really like the cypress mori idea.
---
I need to see for myself or play her post nerd. But I think like you said she may still be powerful.
---
That would be sick
---
Easy. Compare it to Jim Carreys How the Grinch Stole Christmas
---
I have had fun games even if I die if the killer is actually good and puts up a good game. I go on that last hook and its like "damn... I can't even be mad. That was good"
---
That too
---
Probably. The nerf to her base kit is that she needs to wait three seconds for the blink to recharge. The first blink recharges while you are fatigued. Then you wait three seconds before second blink. The difference between the ability to kill between new and old nurse is 3 seconds. Not that huge if a nerf
---
I mean, I shouldn‚Äôt have to use a perk slot to avoid these issues. It‚Äôs like saying, oh just run Iron Will and Spine Chill for Spirit.
---
He might be wrong in that example But yesterday I had two people dc right away and the killer just 2v1'd us pretty quickly and he type'd "gg" Like really? was it?
---
&gt;all
---
Same
---
I shouldn't be scared but when you play nurse on console and you end up not getting a 4k it's an almost guaranteed ggez message at least for me :/ but when they're injured and dead hook I shouldn't get a ggez

It‚Äôs hard sometimes to get a single kill for me and I‚Äôm pretty decent I wanna say I have skill or I‚Äôm lucky but it‚Äôs a bit of both I have good and bad days rank reset brings out the worst in everyone same with double blood points but all you have to do is believe in yourself and that you‚Äôre gonna have a good game and try your best next time you play killer I bet your gonna knock em dead!

I find it charming and endearing that so many here like to RP their killer. It reminds me why I got into the game in the first place: to feel like I‚Äôm in a horror flick. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing Killer here and there just to try it out, and I gotta say it‚Äôs vastly more interesting to lurk about and ‚Äústrike fear‚Äù in your opponents than it is to 4K in 5 minutes. Bravo, my dude.

Yeah, exactly that's how you end up getting moried. Wrong place, wrong time.
---
Teachable perks are unique to a killer until you reach a certain level (30, 35, and 40), then you will see an orange version of one of their teachables (in order) as a node you have to purchase to unlock it for everyone. Alternatively they will some times appear on the Shrine of Secrets in the store where you can spend Iridescent Shards for the same effect. Once unlocked they will show up in other killer's bloodwebs randomly like normal perks do.  
---
So for A Nurse's Calling, you would either need to catch it on the shrine or level the Nurse to 40 (as it's her third teachable perk) and get the orange perk unlock node in her bloodweb (so you would also need Stridor and Thanatophobia). After which you'd just go through Myers's bloodwebs until it shows up.  
---
Whispers is a very good info perk for the early game, especially when you get it to level 3, which is a great fit for Myers. He needs to find people ASAP to get out of tier 1. Whispers functions as a boolean that lights up when you're within 48/40/32 meters of anyone, so you can keep an eye on it in your perk array while searching. Plus if you're watching then the moment you see it light up you know some one is 32 meters away from you. Once you get a sense for, say, how big a house in game is, you can use that bit of information to rule out locations. ie if you're walking towards a house on Haddonfield and the perk only lights up when you're up to it, you can safely assume no one is in the house itself and they're probably in the backyard.  
---
Whispers and A Nurse's Calling are honestly kind of interchangeable in terms of value. Whispers is better in early and late game, A Nurse's Calling is better in the mid game, but they're both very solid choices.
---
For some reason she sounds like a cat meowing to me. So close on the adrenaline T.T

oh, makes sense now. and i'm pretty sure it's Chinese. i still don't know why the achievement has 0% of players still, surely people have gotten her adept
---
True. But that strategy turns and already situational perk into an even more situational perk. It also removes the fun of catching survivors off guard and snowballing end game.
---
Case 1: down some one close enough to an exit gate to open gate yourself. If survivors are sentient and/or in an SWF, it‚Äôs a dead give away. The remaining survivors will stay clear of a gate until BW runs out.
---
Case 2: down someone very far from an exit gate. You head for the gate and either:
---
A) a near by survivor sees the slug, goes for the heal and they‚Äôre gone. 
---
B) you successfully open the gate, return to hook the survivors, and said sentient solo/swf survivors hide from the exits and await BW to run out.
---

I don't have the perk so I'm not 100% sure and can't test it, but logically since you lose the stack upon launching the attack and gain it upon the obsession getting away, I'd say you probably stay at 3.

Thanks I‚Äôll probably make another ghost face more dbd themed
---
I agree, I just want fun games, Trapper is one of my favourites to go against, constantly worrying about where they‚Äôve trapped, feeling like you‚Äôre actively contributing to weaken the killer when you disarm their traps. Understanding that if you get caught if a trap, the killer had to plan ahead and this makes downs feel more satisfying that some high tier killers with busted abilities.
---
First they need to make this game look better than Ocarina of Time before they add that.
---
Thats just a handful of things to do to max. Main point is that 1 DS and the escape is worth 7k points. Theres accually heaps of ways to get survival points, waking up with the alarm clock against freddy is 100 points, wiggling free is i think 300 or 500 points just thinking off the top of my head. When i escape, objective is nearly always my lowest score. I think the problem most people think with survival is that escaping is worth 5k. If you dont escape then it looks like survival is the lowest.
---
Survivors are assholes, without exception.  It really is that simple
---
That's my point, it rewards you for not chasing them. Just finding them. Remember Me is literally the only killer obsession perk that rewards you actually targeting the obsession extensively.
---
I don‚Äôt play by the way survivors want me to play meaning that if the best thing to do is camp or tunnel, I‚Äôll do it. If a survivor isn‚Äôt teabagging or clicking and I‚Äôm having a good day with a pip then I‚Äôll let them go usually as a thank you.
---
Aye why I can‚Äôt play billy or nurse even spirit is sort of eh for me I mean hey I still like her more then those two but only by abit
---
People are taking insta-heals in a lot now because they're getting nerfed next week.
---
[Check Bloodpoint Actions](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints)
---
It‚Äôs not the insta heals that bother me. It‚Äôs the fact that they hide not doing gens. They just wait for me to dc
---
I LOVE THIS. I would like to see any of them!!
---
now that is a scary fucking pumpkin
---
I been running Whispers, Surveillance, Blood Warden, PWYF, I'm All Ears, Fire Up and usually snares
---
No it‚Äôs just repair, healing, and sabotage speed. They nerfed it because it was a bit too much tbh
---
Looks like a polarbear.
---
In a snowstorm
---
Don‚Äôt you already run at 150% after being hit?
---
Poor Philip just wanted to play cards and now he probably has to stop two bear trap-wielding idiots from murdering each other.
---
Survival looks the lowest because survival is the lowest. Objective is literally like 2 gens to finish, boldness is like a 2 minute long chase, altruism is pretty passive by just helping teammates, survival you gotta go out of your way doing mostly unnecessary shit for some of the lowest point events in the game. Like nobody wakes themselves up with the clock against Freddy unless they happen to get near it looking to do other stuff, and I can promise you nobody does it 30 times in a match to get the last 3k or even 15 times to max with DS.
---
Lithe, and some Nancy perk that makes you see your scratch marks
---
I guess it‚Äôs a correct term. Just because you have no reason to not camp, doesn‚Äôt mean the label camping doesn‚Äôt apply.
---
Game length
---
oh, okay. look no sarcasm i'm actually sorry, I wasn't intentionally trying to give off those vibes
---
May I use your 2 survivor perk ideas for a survivor I've been creating? You'll get credit for the perk ideas.
---
Yeah, I get that. It seems a lot of people like to thank survivors for not being out right trolls. I take it flash lights aren‚Äôt thought of fondly by killers? Is there some kind of stigma associated with them? Is it bad etiquette to use flash lights?
---
That's... Wow
---
I really do not feel like repeating the same thing for I think a 3rd or 4th time now. I feel like we might be playing different games or at least different builds of the same, you're the one and only person I have ever seen stating survival is one of the highest scores you'll have at the end of a match as opposed to literally everyone else that tends to get around 0 or around 5k. Every other category can be maxed out rather passively, survival is the only one you have to go out of your way to get, hence why it tends to result in the least points and why it should have more scoring events based around extending your life in game.
---
i have the opposite problem sort of- my surv lobbies take like 10 mins max but my killer ones take 20 :( idk why it happens. tbh my surv lobbies only take so long when im with a friend too
---
Lithe ends chases BL extends them.
---
I just got dbd on the switch and I cannot figure out how to pass a skill check! I know it‚Äôs something to do with the white box but am I supposed to release R, or click a different button? Can anyone help me? I keep messing up gens!
---
Mummy huntress!  
---
p.s really good drawing, keep it up!
---
Garbage meme. Straight to trash dud.
---
Me üò≠üò≠

It's the same on PC, don't worry.
---
This made me jump
---
Trapper feels like someone who would make a deck of only trap cards
---
I know you look them up but I'm pretty sure the bogart you on points, I realized the other day when I did 2 regular, 1 hex totem and a full gen and only had 3000 something in objectives. When I should have had at least 4750.
---
Did they really? What the fuck is wrong with these devs
---
Dark Devotion
---
I'm kinda guilty about this because everytime I go solo, I use bond and if I manage to elongate the chase and no gens are popping. I get to the nearest Claudette and I'll do the gens myself since most killers leave when they can't chase someone especially now in rank reset
---
Ohhh shoot that sounds awesome! I forgot about her!
---
randomness is random
---
and random outcomes can in fact at random seem very not random
---
Do you know where these infinite loops are? Is there a video?
---
That's kind of the point of perks that are more honed in for certain aspects of the game, though. People complained about Ghost Face when he first came out and were begging for nerfs. Spine Chill and OoS are  great counters to him. Don't like running it? Well, can't really complain about getting jump scared by him at that point
---
Sooooo, stupid question. But if you own a DLC (purchased with real money bling bling), then do you have access to the respective perks that come with those characters? Or do you have to farm like usual for the shareable perks?
---
Thanks!
---
DS doesn't increase anyone's chances. It says it does, but it does not. It makes everyone have a 25% chance
---
What is it?
---
Wait maybe I read this wrong but what none of those are really ‚Äútoxic‚Äù perks. 
---
But if you want to go from 1 to 100 quickly just put on Object of Obsession.
---
Head on and pebble into dc. Best build in the game

Entity said "YEET!".
---
and my wraith fan-art like that got removed ;-; but I didn't have a "wooshhh...." nor the signature

Haha, yup. Also.
---
"I don't want to hear anything about I don't believe in vampires. Because I don't fucking believe in vampires, but I believe in my own two eyes, and what I saw is fucking vampires!"
---
So we need some kind of demonic ugly vampire monster killer to go with him.
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted because that's what i meant.
---
Is this because of the Dedicated Servers? This happened to my friend last time we played
---
Well keep in mind it depends on your playstyle. It depends on you not respecting pallets and keeping track of when it's up to use it effectively. Really good survivors can counterplay it by throwing a pallet early but this isn't foolproof and can still force them to spend resources prematurely. It's also not really worth running without Enduring IMO so you gotta essentially sacrifice two perk slots for the combo.
---
A lot of people consider it a "brainless" combo but it can be a quite potent timesaver, especially on M1 killers that can't instadown or chew through pallets quickly.
---
spirit fury as well, both are top tier
---
Usually when I put a mori on somebody ends up force closing their game during the load screen because they don‚Äôt want to play against it and I‚Äôm forced to sit in queue for another 10min.
---
Frustrating as hell when going for a daily. Or even if I just want to use a different secret offering.
---
lithe ends chases with a full build dedicated towards doing so*
---
Anything in the game is fine to use. If you‚Äôre using flashlights to play the game then that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs annoying but that‚Äôs the game‚Äôs fault. If you keep clicking it and T-bagging then you‚Äôre being toxic.
---
Jake looks like he‚Äôs looking behind like 
---
‚ÄúThe fuck you doin?‚Äù
---
Im not familiar with switch controls, but you tap the action button displayed in the middle of the skill check cirlce when its within the skill check bar, you dont have to hit the white, but hitting the white section of the bar gives you an additional bonus percentage of repair if Hex: Ruin isnt active. 
---
Hitting the black section of the the bar doesnt blow the gen, but you dont get a bonus
---
I dont know. Im a killer main but i dont find any survivor perks "toxic" infact im down with people running self care. They waste alot of time running away to heal, especially when I'm rotating targets when I can. 
---
I kind of find unbreakable, adrenaline and deliverance annoying, But I wouldnt say toxic. Toxic to me is more about HOW they play, not what they use to play. D Strike and borrowed time are fine with me since I dont tunnel, and it basically means they have a wasted perk.
---
What is BM? Serious question I'm new to the game
---
Would you prefer him saying "gg" or "ez scrubs?"
---
Please, don't get mad at a standalone "gg". Sometimes it's just a habit, and even the ironic ones aren't that bad
---
Survivor perks aren‚Äôt toxic tho
---
I went against OoO Dwight as a billy one game... Poor guy didnt stand a chance... I just zipped over to him and downed him in the first 15 seconds of the game.
---
The guy broke.
---
Rule 3 of the book
---
Is Fixated faster than Urban Evasion?
---
You still have to lvl them up to unlock their teachables.
---
Yes I believe so
---
I know that this is a little old but is that gingerbread man from evil bong
---
Mikey got confused and thought he was The Doctor for a second.
---
After a few seconds, Freddy can teleport to any gen he wants. I teleported to the gen that she was going towards and caught her by surprise.
---
That's disgustingly beautiful.
---
Good question but getting it to pop its a issue in itself, a lot of people say it takes way more to get it.
---
Survival and objective are literally the survivors main objectives. If you dont escape you dont get survival points. Simple as that. You seem to be dieing more than you escape which obviously scews your perception of the score.
---
Points for recovering on the ground would also be welcome
---
Each new way of getting Survival points without needing specific perks/items/luck brings us closer to greatness
---
Yea it's almost like he's a creature with no coherent speech
---
Yea, i decided to make it into this tho
---
YEET
---
didn't know monto did this one ill check it out
---
fixated and lithe
---
The pig knows how to play cards? Time for a nerf.
---
BHVR logic
---
I dont want to wait two years to play with a killer
---
What I meant is that you shouldn‚Äôt need perks for when the other side holds the game hostage. I‚Äôm honestly not exaggerating. They didn‚Äôt touch any gens for like 10 minutes
---
U N C L E A N
---
What's annoying will depend on what you're focusing on. If you're a good looper, Dead Hard, DS, Resilience, and take your pick to fill last slot - Borrowed Time if you plan to do rescues too, Adrenaline if that's your thing, Self Care if you don't want to depend on teammates.
---
If you're going to gen rush stealth build, Spine Chill, Urban, Dead Hard, DS, and move away from gens quickly and stealthily when SC tells you to.
---
Plenty of ways to be "annoying" if you're good at what you focus on.
---
I mean the pig seems like someone who would use lots of trap cards as well.
---
plus dance with me can make it so you don't make scratch marks for some
---
I mean personally I'd prefer him saying nothing at all.
---
Can confirm.  I spent the day doing meme builds with my buddy earlier and out of the 3 loadouts we played that had Object we racked up 2 DC's.
---
The bloodwarden wall can be so strange, hell one time I got so close to when it activated my model was stuck running behind the wall even though I escaped
---
Impressive. Some precise blinks there, very nice.
---
That would be horrible maybe if they had tombstone it would be ok
---
would be cool for halloween, but we have hallowed blight so...
---
Nah, she'd just stuff her deck with reverse cards to counter trapper
---
This is why I run legion, I'm able to increase my terror radius, keep the games fast passed, and can very easily avoid tunneling because I just apply deep wounds and move on. If I do down people I usually hook them once, maybe twice, anything more than that I'll just leave them to get picked up and move on. If someone leaves someone on the ground I'll try to run them towards where I downed the other guy, deep wounds and leave. Gives them almost no excuse to. It pick up the downed guy. Everyone lives in the end, everyone had a thrill of the chase and near death, and everyone gets a bunch of points.
---
It sucks, but it happens. I mean, according to your post, it seems like a vast majority of your games have been fun for you. Why get so hung up on 3 bad games? Focus more on the positives, don't let them ruin your fun like that. My favourite quote that I like to use is, "don't let idiots ruin your day".
---
Why is ghostface so adorable here?
---
I'm just hoping I'm not losing out on progress due to these stupid neas who INSIST to heal me with nothing while I have we'll make it
---
I don't get it, what are we supposed to see here?
---
bad manner.
---
&gt;There already is a totem counter in small game. I dont think we need another one. Totems are already insanely easy to find and cleanse. Just my two cents though.
---
What? Small Game doesn't have a totem counter. Just Hex:Thrill of The Hunt.
---
Its ok. He doesn't play Dead By Daylight so he has no idea what just happened
---
What I‚Äôm saying is; I personally (and many others) think some aren‚Äôt properly thought out properly and only want them in the game bc it spooks them but for a sane human being it‚Äôs just lazy writing and cringe suck as Jeff the killer
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed any issues with DS, but DH never works.
---
Smart man.  You'll get a lot better at this game avoiding anything remotely challenging.  Pro gamer moves my man.
---
That's not what anyone said or is saying and you know it
---
Not really. I'm way more likely to just go fine someone else rather than chase the guy who gets a sprint burst and the distance make during the time it takes me to vault.
---
Flip Flop with the carry
---
Pig needs rule set#2 in base kit. Other then that im not sure
---
Yup they got their infants just like survivor side does.  I had 3 killers ragequit against me today.  Twice because I ran Object and once because me, my friend and the other randoms happened to spawn near a gen and popped it really fast.
---
I've had a couple of matches like that. Me a r17 baby killer against r8-10s, looping me the whole match and only managed to take them down to injured. Nevermind dying. Last generator done and I just go stand on a hill and contemplate a new hobby. xD
---
Survivors are generally nice about it after though.
---
Practice getting great skill-checks even without ruin. It‚Äôll also help you get better at DS, and overcharge, plus more BP
---
I didnt realize it was a video at first lmao
---
You can think whatever you want regarding how I play or how realistic getting survival points are. That doesn't change the fact that in 3 years of on and off play and many discussions about various things regarding the game, you are still the one and only person I have ever seen claim that survival is not generally the least gained category. That's all there really is left to say on the subject, we can disagree and go back and forth as long as we want but we're both seemingly basing it off experiences with the game. You seem to be experiencing survival as an easily earned category, just about everyone else experiences differently.
---
Sometimes you have to be like that to get that rbt kill for Oinktober challenge.
---
Imo ds needs a buff , the timer should start after you get downed from being unhooked because unless you‚Äôre playing against a thirsty tunneler then it‚Äôs not all that helpful
---
What
---
I've got it, yes you do need it to be a full health state, I recommend just playing a few games with no mither, empathy, and botany knowledge, and run to injured survivors
---
Delete this
---
As an Australian, I can support this comment üòî
---
True, "toxicity" is usually conveyed through the play-style. I may want to go with a perk that could set me up for a  flashlight save, though. DS is good for not getting tunneled. Unbreakable has always struck me as useless due to how little it would get used, since it usually only comes in handy when getting slugged or left on the ground, you'd be better off running Boil Over or Flip Flop. I used to run Borrowed Time along with WGLF for bloodpoint farming on survivor, and Borrowed Time is pretty useful to help out teammates.
---
While I do regard everyone of these Extremely Good Players I‚Äôm pretty sure someone like TrU3Ta1ent would think some of  the responses I received for stating my Opinion are extremely embarrassing. I‚Äôm pretty certain he would prefer to have an actual Discussion instead of saying ‚Äúwell this Person also thinks that so that means I‚Äôm right‚Äù. I stated in Detail as to why I believe Ghostface is one of the weaker Killers but I got harassed for it. I think that‚Äôs extremely embarrassing and you can‚Äôt say something like ‚Äúwell then don‚Äôt state your opinion‚Äù because it‚Äôs not an argument.
---
Yea thats what i thought to. I swear small game doesnt have a totem counter. That would be useful for solo survivors tho.
---
I use unbreakable for the quicker recovery rate more than the ability to get back up once per game. Also, No Mither isn‚Äôt nearly as effective in silencing your groans and grunts as iron will, and that inability to heal makes it a total dealbreaker for me. BUT I did change my build. I‚Äôm now running Inner Strength, Lithe, Quick &amp; Quiet, and Spine Chill
---
Spine Chill is my favorite perk, and there‚Äôs only one build (chase winning) that I don‚Äôt use it with. Otherwise, I absolutely refuse to use a build without it. It‚Äôs my favorite perk and it saves my ass almost every single game.
---
That build is Unbreakable, Tenacity, Flip-Flop, and Boil Over. I only use it in SWF because the killer almost always goes for one of my friends before picking me up. We all run the build or something similar (you could swap something for DS, Deliverance, etc. Even Camaraderie would work.) and we all bring a petrified oak. Killers loathe it. (Deliverance, Camaraderie, etc. are more of a fallback than anything. A back up plan if things don‚Äôt go our way.)
---
The build essentially allows for 2-3 lines of defense.
---
1. Unbreakable + Tenacity allows for a fast recovery and to move to somewhere where the killer doesn‚Äôt find you.
---
2. Flip-Flop + Boil Over means that if the killer DOES find you, you get a wiggle bar head start, and you wiggle faster.
---
One of these perks could be replaced for a weaker defense on one of these two parts, but it would create a third line of defense.
---
3. Deliverance/Camaraderie/Slippery Meat/Borrowed Time would allow for an advantage over the hook in one way or another. Honestly, I, personally, would avoid Slippery Meat and Camaraderie because they obviously have better alternatives, but you do what you like.
---
Also, if you mean not Odzvarda.... Yes.
---
;-;
---
That was a very nice play ngl
---
had to look at that addon and I 100% agree. right now rbt's aren't threatening in the slightest.
---
Yeah, now that I think of it after writing the post, it's more of the playstyle that makes a player "toxic". I meant to say that I was trying to find any build that would just give the killer a pretty hard time.
---
‚ÄúWho the fuck are you??‚Äù
---
Did you bark with her? It's one of the main attractions.
---
Out of all the stealth killers, Pig will benefit the least from the Undetectable changes.  Even EWI Myers benefits more, because it makes it more difficult to lock him into tier I for a long amount of time (especially against a swf).  Pig can now crouch to get undetectable, but it takes 6 seconds after the button press to take effect, and she goes at 90% speed for as long as she is crouched.  Pig can't just crouch \*all\* the time, so the ooo will still see which gen she's going towards for the ambush.  I don't understand why players are acting like this is the Pig buff we've all been waiting for.
---
Yeah, go back to the way they used to be. BRING IT BACK NOW WITH MORE ANXIETY
---
Lol
---
I had this weird encounter of swf where it was 3 of us waiting for the killer lobby and someone random joined our swf lobby that wasn‚Äôt in any of our friends list. We were all confused, felt violated and the funny thing was he ready up acting like nothing is wrong.
---
No it was nighttime and I have more important things to do like sleeping than to answer you since you don‚Äôt even read my arguments and still proceed to behave like a baby about it.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt get nearly that many shards doing one prestige of a killer.
---
Well there is your problem. You're playing killer. Survivors get less blood points on average.
---
Hah ran into a spirit earlier today using those 2 and chased me to the exit gate where all my other teamates were waitin for me and she dc'd as soon as i got past the gate, we weren't swf either
---
lemme guess a claudette ?
---
Balanced landing is good, but you could just level up Nea to get it since she is free. Spirit fury is alright.
---
What more could you want as a punishment
---
Not necessarily extending the game length, just maximizing on the point catigories. Through chase, destruction, hooking (without killing) doing it right you pip, and everyone lives, and you have gotten good points, not as much as if you did all that and then sacrificed them at the end but still a good amount. As for legion... He's hurting now that he was changed. Broken before but yeah. I enjoy him because it's quick passed and you can get off jump scares when the whole map has your terror radius and someone's hiding in a bush trying to heal after a mend. He's not for everyone, and def not for people who just want to kill and 4k as the power doesn't help you get a down, unlike every other killer pretty much.
---
I may sound the worst but I just try to kill peolle
---
The only way you will escape is if you actually are able to lose me and are like me when I play survivor and be selfish. Now I don't tunnel off hook and if I down someone that was unhooked I'll leave them slugged so they can play still and hope the other survivors pick them up. 
---
I'll let certain people leave if they seem like really new players I'll get them to death hook then down them and bring them to hatch 
---
But I will always kill blendette doesn't matter if I see them they die because most of the time they try to hide in plain sight they deserve to die

---
Removed for name shaming and showcasing multiple disconnects
---
The game used to be so tense i miss it
---
What survivors are you playing aginst all the ones I end up with can't seem to even do a non ruin skill check
---
How do I learn to loop properly? Speaking as a survivor here. I've looked at some charts and stuff but it's kinda abstract. I look at YouTubers and they literally jerk the killer around for minutes on end. I've done well for myself if I can evade him 20 seconds...
---
What would a good perk build be to maximize my learning of looping? I'm thinking Windows Of Opportunity, Decisive Strike and Dead Hard for sure. Not sure about the fourth, maybe Bond so I don't pull the killer to my teammates on accident?
---
I'm thinking I just equip these, get into game, and go find the killer.
---
Yeah, good luck with that.
---
Haha me and one other person mentioned candy man
---
Myers gets next to nothing. I'd even say that he got nerfed.
---
They turned his T1 terror radius down from 6 to 0, but you always ran Monitor and Abuse anyway so no change there. He was always immune to aura reading in Tier 1.
---
He also loses immunity to Spine Chill this patch
---
Pig benefits a lot. Earlier if one person had OoO, she had to not use her power at all, because why would you slow yourself down when they know where you are anyway? Others get other benefits when stealthed. Wraith gets movement speed, GF gets to stalk, so they had benefits of using their powers against OoO. Pig had none
---
Spirit Fury/Balanced
---
I'd like an aged mask cosmetic from the 2018 reboot.
---
I usually say sorry for the DC if some survivors DC when I'm killer.
---
I have another image with people saying they wanted candyman
---
I mean I‚Äôm not reading this whole thing lol. But it always puts a smile on my face seeing a survivor main actually understand even 1% of what it feels like to play a killer lol.
---
The other players weren‚Äôt SWF but yeah! There was no killer D: one of us had to leave the lobby for the game to start

Oh and I also made a friend tonight because I didn‚Äôt get ANYONE and when I could have had this Ash dead on hook I let them crawl out the exit gate that I opened because I didn‚Äôt earn it!  She is giving me tips and tricks and was so nice... So I know us survivors are good people, but damn their can be some sour apples out there.

When active hex totem is destroyed, instantly disconnect all players and increases queue times by 10%/20%/100%

You could stand in the corner all game and still get hate

She must have crashed because she had the gen grabbing addons
---
Spirit Fury is not worth it, save up for the Kate cosmetic.
---
SF is overrated in my opinion and I think you'll be happier in the long run by having a cosmetic for a survivor you play often.
---
It does...and that sucks...when a survivor quits, it‚Äôs only one guy...killer knocking everyone out is too much power...and that, that I‚Äôm a killer main...
---
You're right on Myers.  I got overzealous about making a point, and I forgot things that would detract from it.  Having said that, my point is that Pig is so slow that generally she crouches as close to 32 meters (24 with M&amp;A) away from a nearby survivor as possible.  By the time the Pig crouches, the ooo will be able to make a very strong read on which point of interest the Pig is going to.
---
The Pig still won't be able to get an ambush hit or gen grab on a survivor that's working with an ooo, because the ooo will still have a read on the Pig's general direction and last known location.  You'd have to fake out which direction you're going and double back, and even then, the survivors could realistically anticipate it.  Meanwhile, Pig's still going 90% speed the whole time.
---
Claudette is the strongest survivor, change my mind
---
Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Iron Will, something with those. Pretty much the meta build.
---
Blah blah blah
---
What did you say?
---
Nice
---
Yep sounds about right
---
had 75k to work with
---
I mean I‚Äôm surprised it even let you level up at all lol that‚Äôs a weird bug
---
You do realize that‚Äôs another person on the other side of the screen? You wouldn‚Äôt treat someone like that to their face would you? Why is it okay to do so online?
---
there is only 1 map in the game that you cant use balanced landing,But everything else you said is facts
---
Legion could use something.

I'd personally remove the penalty for missing frenzy, or at least reduce it.

I see this man all the time on Twitter.

The dedicataion

I still find them fun when I do well, but they're really frustrating when I dont.
---
They need something and I'm really not sure what.
---
You forgot the shitpost flair.
---
So true
---
I dont think you can make bloodwarden an actuall hex perk with totem. The problem with this is that the killer can just block his hex totem then and the match is over for the survivors. They cant do anything against it, when they miss 1 totem before endgame
---
I agree, I've had a few 4k's as new legion. But imo pre rework to in to play as and against (that's right, I didn't care to go against legion when he came out)
---
What a minutes.. you can‚Äôt activate trap cards from your hand!
---
Calling killers using either Ruin or Noed bad or toxic, is just bad sportsmanship if you ask me. I've been on both sides of that struggle, and I feel bad for every Trapper I meet without Ruin. The only reason you should call a survivor or killer toxic is if they act it (facecamp, teabag) or if they only use meta perks to the point of overkill
---
That's not even the android arm. Ash needs a doctor.
---
I only ask for pig since I already have bbq, freddys are... freddys perks, and I already have Michael p3, but thanks for instructions.
---
It can‚Äôt be lag switching since there are dedicated servers now. I imagine him lag switching would only hurt himself.
---
I almost only get killer dailies. When I played killer most of the time that was nice, but for the last couple of months I've only played killers for dailies. I went from rank 13 to 5 just doing dailies last season.
---
Slippery meat? Hook me again? That doesnt make sense
---
Hes just making sure you are paying attention!
---
Lmao reminds me of that video of a demo doing the exact same thing
---
I only picked him because he had something they could throw lol
---
Yeah I understand. I tried to use the half &amp; half as minimally as possible for maximum readability.
---
Rawr
---
fair enough
---
what changed to make it so that the end game lobby closes before the killer leaves?  I like talking to survivors after the match but now the lobby closes while I, as the killer, am still chatting.
---
More points if you stay and do stuff
---
Boy I hate it when killer escapes
---
commas are important.

Someone took the purple offering for a mist.

And about gamma, I just changed my settings in NVIDIA control panel. It's not an 'outside' software. It's because my Monitor has birghtness set to zero so I had to turn the brightness up to see anything.
---
Once again, its official Nvidia software, its not bannable.
---
Ok nerd
---
1440x1080
---
happy cake day
---
No
---
A perk that gives the other survivor exhaustion? Nope
---
But you already have the totem information if your in a swf so would it really make a difference?
---
Your Spanish/reaction made it funnier, tbh
---
Basement was right there though, what you did was correct if the basement wasn't there lmao. I assume you didn't see it tho

This is just the entity sending trapper to pick up Claire and Leon for the trials.
---
That's the only thing I can come up with - I'll be playing games with GREEN PING and yet the killer, survivors, or myself are skittering around like the Nurse but on steroids. I mean, my ping wasn't the best before (usually better end of yellow - about 120, maybe closer to 115), but at least I could rely on where other players were more.
---
Really cool! I drew something kinda similar for the sub a month or so back but I'm not that great of an artist.
---
Hey mate im just going around trying different builds what build do you usually run now 5 months later? Your favorite build
---
It's worth noting that this same match, I escaped with an item someone else brought in (I know this because I found a medkit on the ground with two add-ons equipped) and I still haven't gotten the Vulture achievement.
---
Also, Can someone explain the Expert/Master/Legendary Survivor/Killer achievements? How exactly am I "22/40" steps towards getting something that's only 20 states?
---
THIS is the worst? You have had an easy life, my friend
---
22nd. Same time as the event
---
No it doesn't have to be continuous, your progress for how much u healed overall is recorded. So u dont even have to heal all the way and u will still get progress towards the achievement, I'm having trouble with the Hemophobia achievement, I keep on doing what's required but it wont give me the achievement...
---
Thanks G.
---
This is true tho lmao. People just saw the nerfs and assumed she was garbage before actually playing her
---
But i have iron maiden so jokes on them
---
Sort of, tunneling is when you ignore other survivors completely to chase 1 person all the time till they die. Different people think diffirent things can be considerd tunneling so dont take my definition as the rule. usually if i find myself chasing a guy who just got rescued of the hook i jusr down him and let his team pick him up  to be sportsmanlike. But if they are so cheeky as to rescue him after i put him on the hook 1 second ago and im still within 5 meters of the hook i just down them both and hook em
---
Spine chill should be Purple, White, and Black
---
And Balanced should be part purple seeing how it can be used to create infinites
---
Never ever change windows text upscaling to anything than 100%. Alot of applications and especially games are not designed with it in mind.  If you have trouble reading small text, then rather reduce monitor resolution.
---
Thanks üòò
---
***YOU BETTER WATCH OUT FOR HIS TRAPS***
---
Well with Urban Evasion, you crouch as fast as you walk.
---
With Fixated you walk faster than your regular walk speed.
---
So yes, its faster.
---
Tunneling means you are going for the same Person all the time. So in that Situation many people would call you out for tunneling
---
I would get rid of Fixated and use Lightweight
---
Actually to be fair, I wasn't really joking or being sarcastic in that comment. But I'm sure if you look at my profile you'd plenty of examples of the two.
---
If it was a custom game, it would say their names on the right side of the screen, and since dedicated server our live right now, there can be 4 survivors in a lobby waiting on a killer
---
For hemophobia I'm pretty sure it has to be specifically the disturbed ward version of the asylum map
---
His face reminds me of the Piranha Plant "Say Sike right now" meme
---
I didn‚Äôt change anything tho, it was recommended setting for my laptop, and when I changed the upscaling back to 100%, the FPS suddenly dropped significantly, normally I can play with ultra , but it appears to be lagging even in low setting for graphic
---
We need Survivor Husks first because Killers lose more when Survivors DC. At least survivors keep their items and shit when the killer dcs.
---
If every survivor dc'd, you lose your addons and gain nothing, really. Plus killer queues are gay right now
---
Well I don‚Äôt use it but a few streamers and you tubers use it on every build. They say it‚Äôs just a solid perk. I think some people live it and some don‚Äôt
---
Is that the Trick or Treat studio
---
Plus he probably has ruin, and some of the best add-ons for him
---
That‚Äôs not the reason why it would be strong though. MoM was OP because the survivors had to do nothing but get hit to get their stacks, requiring no skill. Getting 3 safe unhooks is different since you have to not be in a chase, not be hooked at the time and have the killer not proxy camping (unless you got BT). For example deliverance gives you a second chance yet it only requires one safe unhook.
---
When are people going to understand that 5 blink isn't op, it's literally a meme lmao. If you want to talk broken let's talk omega blink.
---
I'm sorry this one is a little far fetched.
---
As stated a few times, I used the half &amp; half as minimally as possible. Also "creating infinites" shouldn't really be a category.
---
I managed to do one during a chase for the first time yesterday, felt more proud of myself than at any other point in DBD üòÇ
---
Ok
---
This needs to be spread more as an important tech for gate escapes. Lots of times I try this to save someone, and they force me off to get picked up and send hatemail saying I slowed them down.
---
Depends on how the survivor plays with the perks
---
Cool
---
Same here. Sometimes it was fun to see the salt but eventually getting messages after literally every game gets old quick. Just shut the fuck up and take the loss or win without calling me a slur.
---
That's why I love playing on the switch lately. No toxic chat, the tbagging is just a given, at first I thought they were toxic (coming from the FGC) but now I'm not even sure, people does that all the time, even to other survivors, in this community I see the tbagging as writing "lol"
---
From experience, you could literally play friendly all game, bring people to objectives, gates, saves/heals, spend half the game 360‚Äôing.. head nodding..Hell.. I even once stepped in my own traps for 5 solid minutes as a ‚Äúhey guys clearly messing around here‚Äù signal.. and EVEN THEN.. There‚Äôs still a good chance someone is going to try and be toxic.. Yet alone if you‚Äôre actually playing serious in any way possible and it just so happens to not be the way THEY wanted you to play. It‚Äôs worse on PS4 I‚Äôve found than PC, for a couple reasons I won‚Äôt get into. But sadly it‚Äôs part of the burden you take playing the bad guy.
---
Wasn't Rin going to college to become a teacher?  Shouldn't she be telling those rowdy kids to settle down or they'll all get detention?

But I dunno, don't take My word for it haha

That was slick.
---
nice def gonna have to make the switch. thanks homie
---
Isn‚Äôt this kinda publicity admitting to taking advantage of an exploit?... cuz this bugs been openly known for a while now..
---
Do you think she remembers any of that in her current state?
---
there is nothing wrong with ruin, you're just too low of a level right now to understand
---
It's effect was and is too strong to be able to get consistently. It'll either be easy to get and be busted or impossible to get and be trash. It needs to do something else honestly.
---
You don't. You used to stay at 3 stacks but that was confirmed to be a bug and has since been fixed.
---
*plays daily with level 1 doctor*
---
 *survivors tbagging at the exit*
---
I mean... if we're allowing her to speak Japanese in complete sentences and adopt social trends then... I wouldn't discount the possibility?
---
The devs said in a update that the matchmaking in these ranks expand by about 6 ranks, this is lower than that threshold, matchmaking working as intended.
---
You are all the same rank anyway.

What are control freaks and what do they do?

Go run doctor with unnerving presence abd overwhelming preschence if u see lots of toolboxes then pop,brutal strength  nurses calling

I'm lost what's this offering
---
Its a glitch, how dare people ask questions about it
---
xD
---
I need it pleaseee i mean killimg people with the power of my thumb is nice and all but i want my weapon to get the hell out of my arm!!!
---
Now picture it from the killer's perspective.
---
They waited 5-30 minutes to get into a game. Downs one of the survivors and they leave. Their duo leaves. Now there's no chance for the survivors to win unless they go full immersion mode and make the killer fall asleep or farms, which isn't fun at all.
---
Sometimes it happens two or three times in a row. That's exactly why I don't play this game anymore btw.
---
They just want to move on and start a new match, and often say "gg" because they are used to it
---
If you hit and let them Run away : -1 for hit +1 for ending chase : total+0
---
If they end up on a floor: -1 for hit.
---
3 gens completed if 2 survivors remain.
---
oh i see what you mean, i thought you thought that you had to unhook someone else and Ê≤ª them fully for it to work
---
I suddenly remember how I wanted to play Nurse but it was Sabo squad lol. They never fixed a single gen
---
What‚Äôs yours specs, and I heard your on a laptop. Game has poor optimisation and you have a bad laptop. So it‚Äôs your fault not theirs
---
For killer, it's Otzdarva.
---
no NSFW tag? He's clearly naked there!
---
my similar post got deleted by the mods a few weeks ago ;-;
---
One thing I'll say, dont use Lithe if youre trying to become a good looper since it limits your actions. 
---
Balanced Landing is the best looping perk since its the only exhaustion that has a passive (reduces stagger from falling, allowing for some of the craziest loops in the game and extending loops).
---
why wouldn't it? wouldn't you smile?
---
Steak out isn‚Äôt worth it. Waste of shards, just play the game and get better at checks.
---
and get genrushed...
---
Totem spawns can be good. Door spawns can be good. Hatch spawns can be good.
---
Solo queue teammates on the other hand will never, ever be good. If we're 3 years into the games life and people still don't know how to hold m1 on a gen, they never will. Solo survivor will always be shit and the most miserable experience one can have on Dead By Daylight.
---
Do you know how to read?
---
You are rank 14 though which means you were purple/green ranks last season. So ermm you are the main problem, we get you in our games
---
Yeah, I don't really see the tea-bagging as toxic at all, whether I play as a killer or a survivor. People will tea-bag me to get my attention to heal them, lead me to a certain gen, or to quickly say "thank you". As a killer, I don't really see it outside of the already opened gates. I just chase them off like an old man seeing kids on his lawn.
---
name checks out
---
If someone wants to do it and break TOS go ahead.
---
No complaints when the possible bans come though for willingly using a bug.
---
It's always been a thing
---
Waaaaaaazzzzzzzzzuuuuuuuuppppp
---
whats the splinter exploit?
---
Yh, you looped a boosted killer for 5 minutes.
---
people have been experiencing a glitch like this so they could be telling the truth
---
Some people are / were even using this exploit to unlock teachables despite not owning the DLC. 
---
I also wouldn't be surprised if BHVR acted on people consciously exploiting it.
---
Resilience gives you increased vaulting speed whilst injured. If you‚Äôre looking for something like that.
---
 she is now weaker with her base kit,  but nothing can beat omega blink in my opinion
---
I commented something similar, gg is a force of habit for me. And unless I‚Äôm in a very good move I‚Äôm not gonna sit around and wait for 2 survivors to push through 5 gens only to depip. All parties could already be in a new lobby at that point.
---
‚ÄúIf ranks weren‚Äôt this easy‚Äù, ok that helps him how? He clearly ran the killer for 30 seconds and expected 10 gens to be done 7 unhooks and 4 exit gates opened
---
All a killer can do with that is to gg wp and move on to the next match. Being a bigger man/woman is the biggest satisfaction you can get when dealing with toxic players like that.
---
Not to mention you could also leave the post game screen right away or also close the chat box.
---
&gt;Dang I didn‚Äôt know you worked for BHVR! Nice
---
You don't have to work for BHVR to spread awareness. Like OP said, by exploiting the splinter bug you could be putting yourself in a bannable position. Unlikely, but very much possible.
---
Yeah, I agree, teammates can be bad and such, but 1 gen in 300 seconds at red ranks is kinda slow.
---
Bad manners or Bad mouthing (Taunting if there's no voice chat)
---
Which begs the question. Why do we keep coming back? On a genuine level. We all have a love and hate relationship with the game. No matter which side you prefer, its hell more often than good. Yea  the good parts are great, but when does the bad start outweighing the good? I'm scared bro. We play the game because we want to. Right? It's not because it's the best out of 2 versions of asymmetrical horror. It's not our only option...right? With every licensed killer added, it lowers the chance of that killer getting it's own game. Almost giving a monopoly over the genre.
---
Bad nurses were nerfed. The players who normally played without add-ons didn't really mind. She just went from extremely oppressive to oppressive in the right hands.
---
As survivor though I'm not looking forward to more spirit though. I hate that killer so much since I mindgame myself half the time and feel like an idiot.
---
This is... Frightening...
---
Are you sure you're not a killer irl? ü§î
---
Gotcha. Ya I kinda mixed you up with OP at first anyways so that‚Äôs a my bad. I kinda edited to make it less directed.     
---
    
---
They‚Äôre using a bug in the system to get the dlc characters, level them up, get perks etc.. which as far as the TOS is concerned.. is a huuuge nope. Their problem though, seeing as this is all logged in your account activity.. so the fact so many people have been bragging about stealing dlc (essentially) and getting locked content so they save a few bucks or cuz they think it‚Äôs cool.. well.. their loss when the bans roll out.
---
&gt;What argument could be made in favor of Lithe?
---
Lithe synergises with Dance With Me rather well. 3s sprint burst with no scratch marks is incredible chase break.
---
Well I finally learnt what oblivious does, thanks!
---
Its just generally unfun for the survivors to tunnel them. Its boring to spend all game chasing one guy and all the survivors get barely any points.
---
For the gameplay side, tunneling can work but numerous perks discourage tunneling so it doesnt work very well at higher ranks.
---
All in all obviously sometimes you have to tunnel but its good behaviour to not do it all the time
---
Space Coconut is quite underrated
---
Exactly so don‚Äôt you see why it doesn‚Äôt add up, you can easily have 5 gens done if this guy really did loop him for 5 minutes. But clearly he‚Äôs lying ü§•
---
GG fucking timeing
---
Probably, I don't get why you would time your loops too, seems a bit fake, but if its real then they must be some pretty crap teammates
---
With Ruin and an incompetent team Hell yeah gens don't go fast, but if everyone on your team has no perks, no items and just an actual brain then (without Ruin) gens are still extremely fast.
---
I disagree that it's them taking it too seriously. People should be allowed to take it seriously otherwise it doesn't really mean anything and it just becomes a default buzzword you throw out. Saying gg when it was a terrible game that one or both sides had little enjoyment of feels disingenuous no?
---
TBH that would nerf ruin, if everyone just worked through it it wouldnt matter half as much
---
 Pre school pop stars- Juicebox. After ever rough game watch this.
---
Any Wednesday from now until the next big updat.e
---
I never noticed that he teleported to the gen right next to it until [FayTalRS](https://www.reddit.com/user/FayTalRS/) explained it...I tought it was a cut in the video or something
---
Exactly but OP has clearly exaggerated
---
Really? I thought hitting the Locker while the Survivor jumps out makes you grab him.
---
I dunno, under the old system maybe but with the endgame the survivors are already in a rush
---
Sorry. I changed the wording underneath the title
---
8 second channel to heal 1 full state now instead of click boom done.
---
Tru3ta1ent
---
You did a really great job! And nice shading and details on the clothing folds. Keep it up!
---
&gt;But you already have the totem information if your in a swf so would it really make a difference?
---
Most SWF groups are often joking around or making random conversation due to how easy playing survivor is. Often times, someone will mess up their totem counting and this feature would completely solve this problem, even for SWF.
---
Any feature added to improve solo experience that supposedly exist by playing SWF, will inevitably be a "fine tuning" for SWF groups, making it even stronger.
---
Actually, dedicated servers *are* active on PC at the moment, and this is a known problem with Myers on them. For some reason, survivors can be right in front of you, and it wont register them as stalkable. Also, sometimes you will tier up, but just kidding! A few seconds later, it reverts down a tier. It has to do with desync between you and the server, basically lag. Its really annoying, and I wish they would just scrap servers already.
---
I've had that bug without having dead hard
---
This is an incredibly bad idea man.  Like I get that applying gen pressure can be on the trickier side for newer players but giving everyone full game Ruin isn't going to be healthy for the game.  It isn't supposed to last full game.  It's just supposed to be something to help you apply gen pressure early game until you can provide it yourself with downed survivors forcing altruism plays from teamates.
---
Yeah I forgot his youtube name since I already watched all the videos and only follow him frm Twitch now.
---
I hope not, I enjoy going against his tier 1 because I have to constantly be looking for Michael at all times.
---
If you know which props to look for on swamps (Grim Pantry or Pale Rose), destroying totems is just as easy as any other map.
---
The hardest maps to destroy totems are indoor maps because you can't see the specific props from distance.
---
How long has been out GF? A couple of months? Why the devs didnt fix this killer that is a better version of Myers, and literally has a easy 4k every round (unless is a baby), I dont understand why they still didnt do anything with a literally broken OP killer (Even if everyone is focused on Nurse/Spirit and no one plays GF anymore after the 1st week of his release)
---
Tbh, I knew Nurse was going to still be good, but with Spirit being stronger than her base kit/add-ons it'd be hard for her to earn her spot back. Maybe they both are S-Tier depending on whoever is playing them.
---
was probably the bug, i've also had it. happened after i got hit, like this person.
---
They could, of course, just also know about it and be lying tho idk
---
Laurie: *purposefully helps kill teammates so sole survivor can functionally proc*
---
Michael: Thanks, but...*about to go after Laurie*
---
Laurie: *just disappears*
---
Oh man I've seen the darndest things with Aftercare and Empathy.
---
I just love going against Legions cuz then I can see my teammates mend, and not run, but *urbanly evade* to the corner of the map, and then self care. And no less than 10 seconds later they get stabbed again and repeat the whole cycle.
---
Or go up against an infinite T3 Myers, and the whole team still insists on self caring. Ugh.
---
MoM isn't a good perk, but it works.
---
I quit until MoM was FIXED when it was unbalenced and a piece of shitzu perk.
---
So please, keep it the way it is
---
Yeah nah.
---
In MOST cases to go down you take 2 hits. Therefore EVERY time you go down you can pick yourself up with this, and then the second effect is just nothing, there's never a case that would go off.
---
8v2 game mode confirmed?
---
But for tombstone you can't kill survivors on the ground so lockers are basically a free escape from death
---
God loops that you do nothing about unless yourre running bamboozle
---
He‚Äôs about to displease the Entity by ripping Frank‚Äôs head off with a crowbar.
---
thanks for downvotes! seems like copying the exact thing BHVR told us is illegal now
---
No i dont chase them for the whole game. I down them and go after other people
---
Even without Enduring it's a pretty good perk. You won't have to waste time kicking that third pallet. It's nice if you don't respect pallets, which you shouldn't.
---
As its a totem i think it needs buffing. Ithink it should make skillchecks go in reverse as well as all other effects
---
But, isn't the joke that the 3rd one does exist?...
---
Thank god devs ignore 99% of balance suggestions coming from forums. Most of these are borderline broken.
---
I mean every question here could be looked up that way but it would take time, the thread is called ‚Äúno dumb questions‚Äù and it takes pple like u less than 10 seconds to give a good answer :)
---
They're borderline useless right now. Though I'd like to hear which ones you found to be broken
---
I would agree with a slight buff. Maybe taking 2 totems to cleanse fully?
---
Yeah because its fun seeing the same killer basically every game with super strong add ons which are totally overpowered. Even when you manage to "outplay" her, there is no reward. With reactivation add ons she can just do it again. All the mindgames are on her side. And bumping into someone by accident or on purpose doesnt seem very skill needed for me. What i want is the spirit to have a simular skill cap to the Nurse. With no hitbox while phasing it actually becomes a mindgame and you actually have to use your ears instead of phasing around the pallet hoping to bump into someone. Even if she would be Ghostface level, where is the Problem? I think thats a balanced place for killers to be. With these changes spirit would still be pretty strong. You just need to put more thinking into it to get the kill. As i said, there isnt much you can do to outplay the Spirit so logically i would sugest to increase the Spirit skillcap, needing actually skill to play her but  most importantly to change her add ons. Some Purple add ons are just straight up from another world and totally not needed
---
What does it mean when the killer says ‚ÄúI 4K‚Äù?
---
What did it originally say? Pretty curious
---
Very humble guy, fun to watch, and like noob3 show the bad as well as the good, bi find that to be the better way.

The thing that killed fixated for me is that you need to be healthy for the speed boost to work. There are too many times where I get bonked by the killer, and try to break line of sight before walking. Urban always helps, fixated often fails me.
---
Stolen from [this video](https://youtu.be/QY_hKllHnyA)
---
Splinters are so bugged. Still get splinters for killers i already own. With this bug aswell i hope they fucking fix them completly
---
It means they got 4 kills.
---
&gt;Hows it healthy? Genuinely wondering. Not tryna start a noed is bad/good argument
---
Gives survivors a second objective, cleansing totems. When I am playing SWF, the fear of NOED and trying to make sure all totems have been destroyed keeps us from doing generators way longer than any other game slowing perk can.
---
I consider this bm especially knowing the survivors didn't have a good time
---
It's easy not to say it when you know it wasn't a good game lol
---
Don't be just leave post game or link them this https://youtu.be/48H34ukFe8g

You either leave or lean to take joy out of salt :D

You have to!! Its just you saying "gotcha motherfucker, come on out" lol I love doing this when I occasionally play killer
---
FUCKING PLEASE GIVE US THE 2018 MASK, WE'RE GETTING AN OLD LAURIE OUTFIT (AT LEAST I ASSUME THAT'S SOME OLD LADY OUTFIT) BUT PLEASE GIVE US THE MASK!

Clearly a good counter arguement lmao didnt realize its complex to not type anything after a match.
---
Next up killers didnt realize survivors dont have a good time when their teammates DC, read all about it here!!
---
Do Legion, that's very good work you have there
---
The first part is broken. The second part is useless.
---
It‚Äôs a meme.. you know that right? XD and he only does it on pallets, flashlights stuns. Just listen to the man, he clearly isn‚Äôt toxic :p ask him why he does it, and the answer is quite lovely :) 
---
He even flex camps himself if he does something stupid and the killer camps him..
---
Made and applied to a rig. All survivors/killers who fit that rig get its animations.
---
Fungoose has amazing videos where he breaks down about everything that someone could in a match as he plays
---
Monitor shows up a decent amount. Plagues perks arent bad either. Docs perks show up on the shrine more often so id say get plague

So I have to deliberately try not to type something I type regularly so no one gets offended?

Late but they could be calling Pennywise The Hunger since he feeds on fear, but I'd prefer The Deadlights.

It depends on your playstyle. It sounds to me like like you're almost exclusively solo queuing, and enjoy a stealthy gameplay. Personally, my perk choices are often chase and bloodpoint-oriented. For example, some of my favorite perks are Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Prove Thyself, Borrowed Time, We're Gonna Live Forever, Inner Strength, Decisive Strike.  I'll explain my reasons for each perk.
---
Dead Hard (David King) - An exhaustion perk, Dead Hard allows you to resist taking any damage for about 1 second after activation. While this is an OK use of the perk, many more skilled players use it to create distance between themselves and the killer in a chase. For example, using it to get one extra pallet loop before dropping a pallet, wasting the killers time for longer. Dead Harding towards a vault to gain distance. This sort of thing will have a way larger impact, but it's also more advanced of a perk option.
---
Adrenaline (Meg Thomas) - This perk is amazing. I almost never go without it. It heals you 1 health state when all 5 gens have been finished and gives you a huge speed boost to either run away from the killer, or get to an exit gate. While it's true this is only useful if you can make it to endgame, it's too good not to use it. Even if you're in the killer's arms or on the hook, when you are unhooked you will be full health after its activated, and still get that speed boost. 
---
Prove Thyself (Dwight Fairfield) - I mainly just use this perk for blood points. Working on gens with other survivors gives you 100% more objective blood points, maxing out your objective category way faster as well. This gives you the option to get points other ways, like going for unhooks, cleansing totems, getting chased, etc. This doesnt mean stop doing gens, because you still want to escape, but it's still quite nice to max objective fast. Additionally, if you're nearby someone who is on a gen and you aren't on it, they will repair it a bit faster, giving them a yellow repair bar. 
---
Borrowed Time (Bill Overbeck) - This is a staple perk for me and my SWF group. Even when I play solo though, I'll always use BT. Killers often camp the area of the hook, and if you time it right, you can save your teammate by giving them an extra hit. It also often deters the killer from tunneling because they get thst speed boost after taking a hit. Instead, they may go for you,  which is a good thing. You're being a team player when you dont let your teammates get tunneled. The best situation to use BT though is when your mate is on a hook and the gates are open. Just swoop in, grab them, killer tries to tunnel them off hook, and they hit BT phase and run out the gates. Ez.
---
We're Gonna Live Forever (David King) - WGLF gives you stacks of 25% up to 4, 100%, bonus total bloodpoints earned in the match. To get a stack, you safely unhook a survivor, take a hit in front if an injured survivor, pallet save a survivor, flashlight save a survivor, or free a survivor from a bear trap. The bloodpoints are too sweet to resist if you're an altruistic survivor, especially paired with Borrowed Time. Just be careful not to farm your teammate off the hook if it is avoidable. If you have to because the killer is camping and won't leave the hook, that's fine. 
---
Inner Strength (Nancy Wheeler) - Cleanse any totem on the map to activate IS. Next time you're injured, you can go in a locker for 5 seconds and come out fully healed. This is WAY better than Self-Care because it saves time on the actual healing, but also because cleansing totems may be preventing NOED and also gives you a nice minimum of 1k BP per totem. There are even perk builds that will allow you to pull this off mid-chae if you do it right. Pretty cheeky!
---
Decisive Strike (Laurie Strode) - After getting unhooked, DS activates for about 60 seconds (idr the actual length, a decent amount of time.) If your teammate farms you off the hook, or if you get tunneled off the hook, DS is a great way to kind of say "f u" to the killer and hopefully give you time to gain distance on him. Note, DS is a one-time use only perk, but sometimes I find it to be a life saver, as with any second chance type perk. 
---
Now that I've explained my personal favorites, I'll analyze your perks and then give suggestions. 
---
Self Care - Used to be a great perk. Especially for solo queuing. But in 2019, its faced a huge nerf, especially with the buffs to Sloppy Butcher. I wouldn't recommend Self Care to anyone, even new players. It is a huge crutch and time waster, where you could be doing gens instead. I would recommend Inner Strength over Self Care any day, or even Bond. 
---
Kindred - Good for solo queue, but I have to believe that there are other perks you could run. If you find yourself dying on first hook often at your rank without it though, you can put it back on. I'd say Adrenaline should be here. 
---
Spine Chill - I haven't used this perk since 2016, before Myers was added to the game. It's frankly considered a noobish perk, not as bad as Premonition though. Yeah, it's good if you're being lazy. But if you just look around more often and have some map awareness of what's going on around you, you can actually see the killer and where he is, rather then depending on a perk to tell you he is staring at you. Will you get caught off-guard? Yeah, sometimes. Always have an exit plan when you're on a gen though. Know your nearest pallet, window, locker, whatever. Instead of spine chill, I would say use a perk to help you in a chase, like an exhaustion perk (Dead Hard, Lithe [Feng], Balanced Landing [Nea].) If you INSIST on loving stealthy gameplay, Urban Evasion (Nea Karlsson) is a much better option. 
---
Dark Sense -  Even though this perk got buffed recently, it's still kind of a wasted perk slot. I would recommend Empathy (Claudette Morel) if you want to really know where the killer is. Empathy let's you see injured survivor auras. Obviously if they become injured, they are being chased. You know to get away from that area. If they stop running around like crazy, you know the killer probably left them. Plus you can go heal them and get altruism points, or go to their gen to get coop points. Note that it's a waste to pair Empathy with Bond, as they are too similar of perks. If opting for Empathy, I would grab Inner Strength. 
---
You could also choose Alert (Feng Min) to get information on the killer. Everytime he breaks a pallet or a gen, you get to see his aura. Pretty handy, but I'd still say other perks are better.
---
There you have it. Not bad choices on your end overall, and not really considered unfair at all. I hope my explanations have helped you. Sorry for any mistakes, I made this whole post on mobile. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. And don't forget to just have fun and not worry so much!
---
Didnt they remove that feature? Last time i checked I couldnt buy a new killer with shards. Only with auric cells.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea too
---
Wow you're getting pretty upset already. Let's try to leave your emotions out of this one ok?
---
If you're a killer and 2 people DC (which is pretty obvious to all parties) a lil switch in your brain should say "oh damn, I bet the survivors will be upset when this games over in 3 mins so maybe I shouldn't post gg in postgame chat without saying sorry for the DCs".
---
Is it neccessary to do this? Absolutely not, but is it good manners to? Absolutely.
---
Play how you want to play no one controls that but you can control what you type lol. I'm done arguing because I can tell it's pointless so best of luck with your habits.
---
If only Laurie‚Äôs P3 looked half like that
---
To me it‚Äôs a dick move bc when the gates are powered it‚Äôs hard enough for the killer and even harder if no sacrifices, now me being the shit killer that I am has that a lot, solution to both body blockers and end game gates open: noed
---
You can only buy the unlicensed killers with shards. The licensed ones (Myers, Freddy etc.) you have to use cells
---
Personally I'd use the shards for the cosmetic, but I'm a Kate main.
---
I did run Enduring and Spirit's Fury for a while, and it was okay, but there are probably better ways you could equip your loadout unless you're finding that you're eating like 4 or 5 pallets a game. I guess it also depends on which killers you main. Some killers won't need to run pallet management perks, while others will benefit more from them.
---
"Uh, you got decisive? Well, i have a trap."
---
I‚Äôm hard c;
---
Sorry wrong chat
---
Don‚Äôt have blood warden and only have noed 1 but noed coupled with ghostfaces stealth means you can get them whilst they are close to the exit easy, used to try stalk people at the gate but they got too good at seeing me
---
dead hard?
---
Was it a Cypress Memento Mori?
---
I'm terrified to check Reddit these days.
---
B-But it's me :c
---
what‚Äôs wrong with searching chests? its hardly a waste of time. you can find a toolbox to finish gens quicker or a medkit to heal yourself, like you just also complained about lmao
---
Well Bots of entity would spawn and attack survivors and Entity traps would apear that applie hindred status and take one health state each and a 10 min timer would apear and All gens will have to be done not 5, But 7 so if theres 3 gens and killers Dcs There will 5 gens need to be done and when 2 mins are left, hatch opens with any amount of survivors left and gens when 2 mins left
---
For this amazing work I bestow upon you the greatest honor I can do, an upvote.
---
Have you ever tried stealing something that was invisible before?
---
Ermm weird.
---
And they insult you in endgame chat lmao. Maybe next time just fkn leave and that won‚Äôt happen.
---
I gave you the up opvote for the work. I don't find it very useful though because you really need to know what a perk do specifically in other use the right strategies. So you need to read the whole description.
---
YO DUGGIE, PICK UP THE PHONE
---
I can maby explain a few for you ^^ infectius fright is allready a meta perk on a few strong killers (myers, nurse, plague). If myers procs T3 and insta downs a survivor with MaA and this not only will he know where the survivors are but they will not know where he is going hiving him an easy slug fest. 
---
Monstrus shrine allows for basement camp with ANY killer without counterplay cause he  insta downs the one going for the save. Now i do like the concept of some of these changes and would like unused perks to be buffed/reworked (like they did with survalience).
---
Thank you \^\^ I've been having a lot of fun making silly comics about this game, I'm glad other people are enjoying them too
---
The sprint speed just needs to be faster
---
Just stole it mid bing bing bing
---
Thank you for providing reasoning behind why some of these would or wouldn't work. Reading through i can see the need for some concerns.
---
I actually really like the idea of Third seal being a kind of random effect perk, slap a person and you get an effect.
---
Though the idea of it disabling a random perk sounds cool too.
---
The Mindbreaker range thing was more of an added bonus because I've seen it done when playing killer and I've done it as a survivor that when I'm on a gen a survivor will just be looping a killer close by, they'll drop the pallet and then use their exhaustion perk to boost away or dead hard through them. This would kind of add the benfit of survivors needing to be weary of running towards gens being worked on as it could mean the loss of their exhaustion perk.
---
This happened to me. At least I managed to kill one.
---
Got gg ez and tunnel f*g as a parting gift though.
---
So infinite Styptic Agent? (before the change)
---
Healthy to Injured = +1
---
Injured to Dying = +1 for 2
---
Dying to Injured = -1 for 1
---
Repeat Infinitely
---
Yeah but sadly no.
---
Killer who cant adapt and cries because they cant counter a perk that doesnt work on half the killers lol
---
Typical high ping situation. If both you and killer has like 80+ ping, "phantom" hits are to be expected.
---
Urban Immersion used to have the same stipulation, when it first came out. I'd say it's likely that they'll buff Fixated down the line, like they did with its older brother.
---
Ghostface build I‚Äôm using is Ruin, Sloppy, Thanatophobia and Nurse‚Äôs calling. Sometimes I‚Äôll switch Ruin with noed because no gens get done and it‚Äôs just fucking chaos. Build came from TrU3Talent‚Äôs stream which is really fun.
---
Onion trapper

Every time I draw him, he becomes more onion...

Ahh, thank you for explaininga bit. Yea i suppose the Monstrous shrine suggestion would increase basement camping though it could work similar to make your choice where you have to be some distance away for it to take effect.
---
Though I'm glad you found some of them decent, the entire point of the post was to suggest a way for these more underused perks to be brought towards the light. Especially some of the killer perks.
---
Now that servers are up, yes.
---
Besides flashing lights and pointing thats all there is to communicate.
---
I had a surv DC and another instantly sacrifice themselves, so I had to spin, nod, and twist to get the survs trust that I was letting them free.
---
I enjoy some of his content but he is not a good teacher
---
Ohmwrecker is probably the best
---
Lmao
---
Well Freddy would just end up banging them.
---
I've just started leveling up Survivor - started with Meg because i like her, but i know Balanced is good. Neas other perks aren't great right? I got DS and Iron Will from previous shrines, so would Adrenaline, Balanced, Decisive and Iron Will be a decent build to run for playing survivor somewhat casually? I also have Spine Chill and the fast healing after hook one
---
Dick move? That's just thinking with your feelings. Think logically. THE SURVIVORS ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ESCAPE SMH
---
k thanks
---
Well, "green ping" is anything under 100ms, so... yeah, up to 200ms latency.
---
I wouldn't say it's quality of the servers. More like netcode quality (don't think we'll ever see an improvement here) and lack of data centers (I'm yet to play on less than 80ms ping)
---
Plague has better perks and is a better killer
---
Just treat it like a new game and learn in the process.
---
Or empathy. When they're just stumbling everywhere across  the map
---
Me too! Look at Claire‚Äôs top too! I wish we had clothing like that!
---
Why is it a dick move? They're helping their teammate to survive.
---
its only 30 for Myers, and it was on shrine not very long ago so it isn't coming back for a long time.
---
Yeah, most of these ideas seem fine to me. A few might be a bit strong but overall some nice change ideas. Idk what this guys on about all these being broken
---
The lobbies are kinda stable nowüòÇ
---
If you're in PC, it was probably just Steam maintenance they do every Tuesday. Steam goes down for a few minutes anywhere between 6-8pm EST, usually around 7pm. Just be expecting possible dcs or BP loss on Tuesdays around those times. Sucks, but not DBDs fault.
---
I have countless matches at 30-60 ping. Obviously I dont know the exact number for the ping. But outside of dedicated servers, I can say without a doubt that hit would not have hit me. 
---
We can never know the ping at that exact moment, but all I can say is that it was pure BS, I still got out that match so no real harm done.
---
People are trying to fool you by saying that they type ‚Äûgg‚Äú as a habit. At that point that term holds no value whether it was a good game or not. I always give condolences when there are dc or rage quitters and the poor solo queue survivors are 3v1 from beginning, in which case we farm and move on not slaughter and type gg like an egotistical prick.
---
OwO
---
If you want a Killer who can end chases...
---
Nurse literally ignores walls and pallets.
---
Spirit (with a pair of headphones) makes Survivors mindgame which can quickly end chases if they screw up.
---
Hillbilly can Chainsaw Survivors ignoring 50% of a chase while also giving nice map travel.
---
You
---
Problem with Lithe is that it's really easy to waste it. 
---
If you are in a situation where you have a vault avaliable, you probably are in a safe enough of a spot to not need a speed boost yet. If you are looping something like a jungle gym you will often waste the speedboost.
---
Why is this community full of asshats?
---
Do bones lol
---
Uh, he's talking about survivor wise.. like.. DBD.. not his personal life.
---
I bet the after game chat was hilarious.
---
No shit.
---
You really hate to see it. 3 gens within 20 meters from each other. That‚Äôs a big F
---
Which is really what shows how amazing he is at this game. IIRC he 4ked with a perkless trapper at high ranks
---
An idea to make everything easier to manage. Make a post with the description and post all ideas one by one in the comments
---
Great! Might as well finish my dlc collection with Clown, Legion and Ash then. I can't wait to play as thicc boi.
---
Wack.
---
Ah, make it so people can upvote or comment on the certain perk
---
*He comes from the land of the ice and snow*
---
This is as far as i have seen not a dick move but a good play. Just like body blocking a hook so you drop the survivor if they can make it. They are trying to survive.
---
I'm not projecting my playstyle onto you. Not taunting a killer on a hill when you are unsure if they have NoEd or not isn't really a playstyle. It's common sense. You run Spine Chill so I'm not even sure why you're playing so bold.
---
He atleast plays it every week :)
---
There are some killers that DC, sure, occasionally you run into them. But for killer mains, we know that survivors DC every other match on some days.
---
The worst part is, on P2P even playing against killers with 80ms to 150ms hits THAT bad didn't happen. On servers they are so common I am starting to become afraid of window vaults.
---
Itll be out the 22nd
---
Plus we all know the servers are broken. People constantly post about this topic. You can't really expect people not to comment  that what you did wasn't the right play.
---
Don't forget about killer's ping. Let's say yours was 60 and killer's (like it is for me) was 80-85. That's 140ms minimum between killer pressing M1 to hit and you receiving a notification that he pressed M1. I don't know if DbD has client-side hit registration or server-side, but currently playing with 60ms feels nothing close to 60ms in p2p days.
---
Have you played in red ranks as a solo/duo survivor ? (like most survivors are, 3-4 man SWFs are a minority) Because it's spirit meta, and it's just not fun. She is one of the least interactives killer (just like Nurse) with a relatively low skill cap (unlike Nurse). The only counter against a good spirit is Iron Will and genrushing the fuck out of her. And let's not even talk about Anal Beads ebony mori Spirits. Makes about 10% of my games I guess, 10% of games where the only thing there is to do is relax and accept the depip.
---
Non-meta killers need a buff, I strongly agree, especially killers like Doctor, Clown, Pig (Legion is shit too, but he had his time in the spotlight and is not very fun to play against either, so it can wait imo). But that will need to come with a Spirit rework. I'm hopeful tho, because Freddy rework was amazing, Demogorgon is cool, and they're both viable at red ranks against most groups of survivors. There will always be optimal full-SWFs that will rekt everything sure,  but that's not what most of games are. You can't put everybody on the same page as current Spirit because then you will just break the game for the vast majority of survivors.
---
Shut your mouth boy
---
Fungoose is an amazing education dbd streamer, but he's Aussie so the time zones don't always line up for his streams
---
I would grab freddy, he has lots of play styles and ways he can adapt
---
Ah yes I forgot intentionally getting a killer's attention is "taunting". As I said before, I dont take this game seriously in terms of escaping. If I can make a play to take a killer away from a hooked survivor, I'll do it. I'm not sure why you're riding up my ass about me supposedly not having common sense when I can do whatever I please.
---
Also I run spine chill just incase a ghostface, pig, wraith, or anal beads spirit come to me while on a gen. Other than that, I rarely look at the perk.
---
Why do people walk at the start of the match? 
---
You just spawned, the killer isn't anywhere close. No need to waste time.
---
I mean the guy just has a competitive mindset. Maybe he should go play with somebody who is good instead.
---
Is the sale live? Or when will this be live please id love to know
---
You'll find some good visual resources in the [stickied Guide thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/) and OhTofu has a whole bunch of guides on pallets, tiles, and maps [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop).
---
Once you've watched the visual guides, spend some time watching people play while at the same time mentally comparing it to those guides. This *should* make it easier for you to connect the dots, so that when you're playing yourself you should have no issues getting into the "right" mindset, always planning your next loop.
---
As for perks, Decisive Strike doesn't really help with looping. It's a perk to discourage people from chasing you to the exclusion of everyone else. Fungoose has a "selfish" build (their term for it) that's designed purely for running the killer for all 5 gens, that'd be the one I'd look into.
---
Fungoose is educational and skilled like hell.
---
We're Gonna Love Forever - For every safe unhook, see injured survivors auras for 30s / 45s / 60s after achieving the safe unhook notification., in addition to the 25% BP token. You can help your injured mates by healing without running empathy or bond or aftercare, or keep the killer away from the area they're in to protect them.
---
It's her original outfit from the first movie.
---
Not even factually, most just sit by the gate and t-bag until the endgame is past its' half. That gives you jack shit.
---
That‚Äôs not even close to what o was saying but ok
---
Usually I'm mad about slugs like that but that was just incredible
---
6 days left..I wait for the rift &amp; Halloween event
---
ITS LIVE AND INSANE oh here it goes ü§ë
---
Lol, yes, because I don‚Äôt get them
---
I dunno, I don't think you'd say good game to the other player if they had a significant handicap - like if you played tennis against someone who sprained their wrist and had to use their non-dominant hand, you'd still shake their hand I'm sure but I feel like I'd say something more along the lines of them still playing well despite the handicap. 
---
I wouldn't get mad about it but I do get kinda irritated when someone says GG and it's just blatantly not true
---
Prayer beads spirit
---
That‚Äôs when the Halloween event starts? There‚Äôs no evidence anywhere to suggest that‚Äôs also when they‚Äôre releasing the full mid chapter patch. The Withering Blight isn‚Äôt actually part of the Mid Chapter patch. So no, I imagine it‚Äôll be out before then
---
Who doesn't know how to play around bloodwarden these days?
---
At the start I think you can hear Michael kicking the Gen I was working on, I started walking so he didn't know which direction I was in.
---
Open Handed stacks for everything other than Kindred (it works for kindred only once)
---
Make sure to bring skeleton keys with an add-on that lets you see the killer and increased duration. You‚Äôll love it
---
Fungoose
---
I just buyed legion dlc, Freddy DLC, head case and ghost face..
---
Now the only missing is the stranger things DLC which I will buy next Sale, cause I have to level up a lot of survivors and killers now
---
No the event is apart of the rift. Patch comes out 22nd. If it didnt it woulda come out already
---
&gt; That's not how ping works, if a killer has 80-85, then they see everything at an 80-85 ms delay.
---
Relative to the server. But server gets your (survivor) actions with 60ms delay. If everyone's positions had to be validated by the server, there'd be a significant input lag, and I personally don't feel that for movement and M1 actions (powers are wonky).
---
All the nerfs did was make her even harder to play. Bad Nurses will be even worse, but life long Nurse mains will still dominate.
---
Me, apparently ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
This ain't it
---
It‚Äôs always on the same day of the week, always exactly 2 weeks after the PTB patch
---
No it isn‚Äôt? Literally not at all. All the rift has to do with the Halloween event is it gives some free currency for the cosmetics that were already released.
---
Yes it is. The cosmetics are apart of the event they just released them early for people who want them early. Events next week. Patch is next week.
---
It‚Äôs actually a capsule
---
Sounds like Plague to me. 
---
You get all the debuff fun you come to expect from Doctor and Pig, with the added mindgaming and paranoia you get from Trapper.
---
Perks are pretty good too. Corrupt Intervention is a weaker-but-unavoidable pseudo-Ruin, and Infectious Fright is terrifying on fast moving killers. Unfortunately her Dark Devotion is pretty weak, as perks go.
---
No, it also gives us the nurses Halloween skin
---
The regression is the best part of the perk since other none hex perks gives slowdown by being almost passive like thanat or dying light
---
What. You can only have one obsession, so one person to target last, even if all survivors run obsession perks. The point is killer obsession perks that makes it worth to keep the obsession for last, not that survivor obsession perks makes them not worth chasing early.
---
Myers wasn‚Äôt trying to hit him...
---
Oh my god. His last match couldn't have been very good
---
I was just saying of how easy is to do it besides , it's pretty bullshit for the devs , like their work goes to nothing after getting the contracts for us to have some cool killers
---
I've had games where the literally was barely enough to any grass to hide my traps in to the point they did almost nothing the whole game. I get they are basically just a element of surprise but this is stupid
---
It takes as much to get it fully stacked as it does for Devour, but it notifies survivors right away AND has a worse reward.
---
It‚Äôs also better at 4 stacks than 5
---
Fred is a good choice. Strong killer these days, and can be really flexible in his loadout.
---
6 totems on the map needed then
---
It's more a matter of how you feel as killer honestly, did that dwight deserve hatch cause he was good at looping difficult spots or did ge just 1 god loop with no counter? Strictly speaking should kill everyone no matter the situation, but i can't kill low ranks i don't want them to suffer the same way i did. You think advanced swfs gave 2 flying fucks when i was starting to learn wraith? No they just pointed and laughed and i simply endured. You can be kind or you can be mean either way players get better the more they play except one feels good and the other is gnawing your brain.
---
Nice, but next time I suggest you to cut the room waiting and loading screen parts
---
The thing is they‚Äôre so rare it‚Äôs improbable that you‚Äôd encounter that many
---
Thank you üòç
---
Very rare one gives you the borrowed tume effect for 15 seconds and ultra rare one heals you over 8 seconds rather than instantly
---
Left behind so you can find the hatch from 64m
---
Sounds like a good idea to me
---
They appear on bloodwebs
---
When they are going for 4xOpen-Handed, why not go all-in?
---
The build isn't really that good without those keys anyway, as SWF should know where the rest is anyway
---
Picture this, you have been chasing a survivor and down him, as you are about to pick him up some claudette cones out of a bush, gets next to the downed guy and BOOM now that guy is healed back and the chase starts again. All while 2 generators pop at the same time
---
Just treat it like a new game, not like they game you had before, because you'll just get confuse. Watch some videos.    
---
Here's a great source for learning and playing the game:
---
 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDO__Z-tZD4bfG9m4AkK_uA
---
Ez dc.
---
Agreed
---
It just seems that when I haven't hooked anyone the whole match... the exit gates are open... and I finally land two hits, they don't have to body block.
---
&gt; You pay $10 and not only can you **earn that $10 back, paying for next time**
---
I don't understand what you mean. Can I unlock the next Pass by paying / playing now?
---
Thought the same..
---
Julie is more of a Jamie, than Laurie is a Jamie
---
Yeah I wasnt doubting your point, I just quoted the TOS so if people doubt it they can see for themselves.
---
Meh yeah it's a bug/glitch but I'll use it as there are no penalties for doing it, and seeing as the trapper doesn't have much going for him except his traps I believe it's fair.
---
 
---
One thing I forgot to mention if you're having trouble with grass just bring the black tar add-on it will make your traps basically invisible on some maps.
---
Appear in your blood web for killers right now they are bugged to just give u the character for the corresponding splinter instead of letting you try the killer of the corresponding splinter
---
Bannable
---
Kunai with chain!
---
No worries. Plague has a bit of a learning curve, but it's not too bad.
---
I'd definitely recommend watching u/int3r4ct's "Entity Education" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOxpBwyhz-w) regarding Plague - you'll learn far more about her power than the wiki will tell you.
---
Legion has an negative ratio...
---
They only killed one janitor, for a group a 4 people..
---
His soup
---
Don‚Äôt play her, the End of user license agreement that you accepted to play the game states that you may no exploit bugs and unintended errors in the game.
---
I'll slap it on during my lunch break. Thanks a lot!
---
Well done!
---
&gt; Thats not how ping works... You only get the ping value towards the server.
---
I mean, survivor has X ping to the server, killer has Y ping. There's no way info could get from killer to survivor in less than X + Y ms.
---
why does everyone hate megs? I always see this.  
---
my experience playing survivor has been running around the killer for days whilst a claudette crouches behind a rock and crouch walks over to you for the unhook despite the killer being a light year away
---
Black tar helps in some maps and just makes traps glow on something like the snow map mountain something I don't remember the name.
---
Trapper is fun but when even his traps can work against him and meta can shut down trapper more I just wanna ask myself "why hasn't trapper been buffed since the trap place timer"
---
You already do that every time you hit someone lmao
---
You played very well but it felt like you wasted your Pop Goes The Weasel a couple of times. Other than that you did great
---
I figured, but I‚Äôm between matches so I felt like adding my .3c in and my coffees got me a bit wired at the moment.
---
An underrated thing people don't mention is that Lithe can make unsafe pallets less of a death sentence if you don't get the stun. One correct read and you can vault over the pallet and use the speed boost to reach a safer loop.
---
Ghostface. I love the scream franchise.
---
Lithe gives you 50% bonus movespeed when you vault something, which combined with the other two means you run at 150% speed leaving no scratch marks and the Killer didn't hear you vault.
---
Fixated is the last perk, which makes you move 20% faster while walking (not crouching or running) while healthy and allows you to see your Scratch Marks as though you were the Killer.
---
Myers but I still hate they haven't added no new mask for my boy.
---
Open handed is underrated. Sure, the perks and items it affects are kinda limited (bond, plunderer's instinct, tier 1 and 2 empathy, kindread, and the aura reading green key add-ons), but it's really useful in my opinion
---
He needs something that's all I'ma say
---
Oh, ok then it makes sense.
---
Wait before you start playing killer, swf with keys and instaheals
---
Boomer bile attracts the horde
---
a killer respecting pallets stops slighly away from the pallet when suspecting it will be slammed down to try and avoid the stun in a chase
---
Leather face. Nothing is more fun than chasing the first survivor I see for five gens then hitting then with a spicy NOED. Dragging their ass to the basement and insidious camping until all the other leave them to die. Good times, good times.
---
What do you mean! that was the most accurate depiction of a drunk lumberjack I've ever seen :)
---
Ok, thank you. These are big nerf! Ok, maybe for the UR one it's an "acceptable" Nerf. Quite Fair.
---
For the VR one, well...it's a giant nerf. 
---
I don't use so often IH, i prefer the tool box, but I think this a big change for DbD.
---
Yes, if you look at it as Killer, it's a huge fair nerf. Sometimes you lose a match only beacause IH.
---
Anyway...BHVR is doing big changes in the game following player moods.
---
God damn it now I have coffee in my nose. Why must you hurt me in this way
---
Where's the ruin?
---
Spirity fury time
---
Btw, keep up the good work otz! wish you all the best
---
Both sides has non-zero ping to server. If you think playing with 30ms vs 30ms killer would be the same as playing with 30ms vs 200ms killer, you're simply wrong.
---
Spirit and hag.
---
&gt; Also I'm posting this because everyone talked about servers like a beacon of hope, but then when they came out everyone acted like they'd never work.
---
De-sync is a problem for a lot of online games. Especially fast-paced ones.
---
[This is the link] (http://www.dbdbuilder.net/)
---
i/jappenesetranslator
---
You're also very wrong, killers can spawn right next to survivors at times
---
Can't wait before they nerf instaheal, but then the main issue will be the key..uff this game
---
Make one where they do the same thing with Trapper but one of them gets their hand caught in it.
---
Agreed a set back should be the bare minimum, there‚Äôs no logical reason they should keep what they shouldn‚Äôt have in the first place.
---

---
Is it me or does he look goody? I‚Äôm sticking with ‚ÄúX-gon give to ya blasting as pennywise‚Äù
---
Why not both?
---
yeah fuck off this guy didnt do anything bad he just showed you somethings Dont be a dick to him
---
He could easily have grabbed you, but instead he preferred to stalk you.
---
No, sadly. Just protection hits
---
Thanks, i'll probably level her at some point, but not as a priority now that i can nab this. I'm probably gonna try and get Borrowed Time next and Dead Hard
---
&gt;Now with insta heal med kits getting nurfed - ebony moris need an adjustment. Even if it was after the second hook it would be more tolerable. Right now it‚Äôs just a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.
---
"If you nerf survivor you MUST nerf the other side too!" Bad argument
---
Plus insta heals were broken af, taking 3 hits to down a Survivors and you couldn't do sht about it.
---
Aaaaand, they still strong. If you use syringe you can heal overtime, like a second wind with extra steps and the purple one gives you an enduring which is the same of the old insta heal, kinda
---
So I don't know why are you crying about something broken be tweaked and still very strong. Mori are more like keys than fking insta heals, dude be less entitled and at least be logical
---
Being a dick??? Says the one rinsing their mouth at. Mummy needs to take your little 30fps console and controller and wedge it so hard in said area which I can‚Äôt disclose to people under 12.
---
The original said Nancy instead of Nea.
---
Iridescent Head Huntress Intensifies!
---
RIP. Right under my nose. I'm using it. BT is now a teachable -_-
---
i am not quite sure what you said in this comment. what do keys have to do with this and im not sure what you meant talking about devour
---
i don't know who you are , but i already hate you
---
ps : nice job
---
ps2 : still hate you
---
Lmao i play pc
---
So hide till hatch spawn, got it
---
I can make stupid points too, isn't as difficult as you think
---
This is actually a funny idea lol I just might
---
Good. But they still kinda are, just takes more time..
---
They are not insta without any counterplay anymore,that's it
---
ESPECIALLY remake Freddy.
---
OG Freddy was disgusting but still all about the kill.
---
Remake Freddy was all about dat now grown ass
---
So why do you comment on PS4 lobby times. What‚Äôs your steam name then
---
no going to give my name and i have play on console too pc is better
---
If this doesn't perfectly describe the situation
---
Guess if he does that he would be called Camper.
---
Lmao you don‚Äôt have PC, little child go to school or no playing game when you get home
---
Well that's just like.. Your opinion man
---
Asymmetrical game
---
I know, it's hard to understand. One day you'll get it
---
Honestly dude, the meta is cool and all, but I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs more fun to make your own build work. If you want to use the meta it‚Äôs bt ds dead hard and adrenaline
---
yes show reddit how toxic you are. Btw i play on a lenovo gaming laptop that i bought with my first sallary so fuck kid. At least i have a life.

Lol, a perk no one uses being useful sometime, nice!

Illusion Pallets would be great to have in his base kit rather than an addon, especially since Doc's pallets are just illusions that you can interact with like Freddy's.
---
Ghostface, its my main right now because Its so funny and enjoyable to play
---
Enduring + Spirit fury is pretty much the 2 best perks on like 80% of the killers
---
stealing memes off instagram, nice "no u"
---
That soup
---
Just did a GPU benchmark on your specs. Fucking shocking results.
---
Oh look, more entitled survivors dc because things don't go their way..
---
This DC epidemic is getting really out of hand.. but since whenever they DC for something, like a Nerf, they get it. So become spoiled
---
Let's remember old Freddy as an obvious example. Now nurse, next iri heads huntress then spirit, Billy and so on till they get what they want by dcing.
---
It's getting pretty sad, I hate when my team mates are just a bunch of cry baby and get punished with less BP cuz of them.. god damn it

Because  you can't have a gun

And get hit with pallet stuns,

So plant God can watch and laugh at you.

Because your perks never work,

And all those gens that you shirk,

Because you like trying to make them bleed,

Endgame comes, here's NOED

With a Mori to spread

All of the trial's misery to them

Survivors shout out

"Legion, they scare the living shit outta me"

"Vaulting windows at incredible speeds"

So with resilience equipped

And with a purple medkit

Maybe they'll leave you alone
---
But not Rin
---
(Because she's not much older and is totes crushing on Frank, even though Julie is pretty territorial)
---
My new meta perks are gonna be balanced, kindred, borrowed and bond, just so I know what my fuck-all teammates are doing
---
Yep. Hopefully they change moris and keys next, that should be most of the universal "feel bads" out of the way
---
Honestly, the shadows look kind like him
---
A VWWWEEE VWEEE A VOU VOU A VE VEEEE
---
You can get banned. Read the EULA
---
SPIREH
---
Yep. It's related to dedicated servers. Hurry and use it to get BBQ for free!
---
I'm pretty sure map auras are infinite length, and open handed only affects aura reading, not the item detection length. As for better together, I'd have to imagine so, even though I haven't tried it myself yet. Since open handed affects the aura reading of everybody by 8 meters, it should work
---
In all honesty it kinda sounds like there's not much point to the event if you only gain blood points for it and no vile currency. Each event you get to earn something, just doesn't sound like a special event.
---
This is great üòÇ
---
That may have been me, I‚Äôve done that a few times
---
Woah, he knew the perfect timing for the last gen? I shouldnt compliment him since thats a douche move, but props to his intuition
---
That would be dope!
---
Depends on what you're into üòà
---
Can we get spooky sora and spooky Christmas sora as survivor/costume?
---
Green ping servers are ok but on like yellow ping you get crazy hits, also you cant really play ghostface or michael because you cant stalk to 99 there is always a bit of delay. Like once i wanted to stalk to 99 as michael, got the Tier 3 music but not Tier 3, its mega confusing.
---
Just after I unlocked spirit fury. Guess I don't need to spend any shards this week.
---
Noob3
---
And Potentially get banned
---
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
---
they are also not insta anymore because its doesnt instantly heal you. which is the main reason it was called an insta heal wasnt it
---
The great players won't switch, all the nerf will do is mess up their muscle memory slightly, it'll only take them a few days to adapt. The ones who will be going Spirit are the ones who can't play anything but Omega Blink.
---
They don't need to allow you to get a kill, their entire goal is to escape
---
Open handed can be hella fun with bond
---
rip Yondu
---
Nah the base kit is just going to make it more difficult to learn now. The Nurse is still by far the most powerful because she can still ignore loop mechanics unlike Spirit.
---
Ohh definitely. I really don't like any of the meta perks, but wanted to at least give them a good try.
---
Keys are broken. Too much broken!
---
Mori too, but keys...my god!
---
Now I understand, thanks.
---
Welp it's really nice to read this
---
It's also sad many people have to block msges because of harassment. Because of it I've been banned twice on PSN for replying with a meme (doctor holding a piece of paper saying "gitgud) when they harassed me when they lost
---
Sadly many more people play survivor than killer, that's why they are more often toxic, being stuck in a single role an seeing the other side as "the big bad guy" so it's fair game insult that person
---
Luckily I love playing games at 100% so I never stick in a role, I like playing everything if I have the option to. So I could see both sides of the coin and even if it's not data but just mere personal experience, I've seen way more gentle killers than not toxic survivors.
---
Many gave me the hatch because I didn't act as a dick or had some DC, while most of the survivors msg me (with friend requests now. Imagine that..) or act toxic in general
---
By toxic I mean, flashlight clicks, tbag, pointing and this kind of stuff. Which lead me to kill them and seeing a DC icon right after they fail
---
I'm a kate main, and this is beatiful
---
How original
---
Lmao EPIC meme.
---
***BITCH*** **ass ankles***
---
lmao
---
didn‚Äôt they take out omega blink?
---
At that point why bother? It's endgame, only reason for the survivors to stay is to get a save.
---
His name is Philip, that's about the most beta name of any killer. Don't get me wrong I love playing him but if any killer were to get bullied, it's wraith
---
False. If anyone is getting bullied, it'd be the Pig or Ghostface. Not the 8 Foot Tall Ghost-Man
---
Her lore makes it sound like it was just an isolated cannibal family in the swamp near her village
---
You should do shadow the niggehog next
---
&gt;  so you can always Q&amp;Q into a locker.
---
Q&amp;Q + Head On much gusto
---
I know about his power and potential and that's cool, but I don't like the character himself haha.
---
Doctor laugh is too much electronic and not really sounds evil, so I prefer clowns dirty, rusty laughing
---
Other way around. OG Freddy wasn't a pedo he just murdered kids, remake Freddy *is* a pedo
---
That's his point
---
Mhm, how do you feel about no more frenzy stacks?
---
Shit.. that's crazy! Thanks
---
Not right next to them? You will always spawn out of the terror radius, so no point in being sneaky at the very start.
---
Legion, I love running around and stabbing people
---
 It‚Äôs called lag.
---
Tbh, I just hate "gg" because of what the shooter scene did to that abbreviation. It doesn't actually mean "good game" there most of the time. It was just someone rubbing it in.
---
DBD though feels pretty genuine with the gg
---
You are the first person to really escape from the entity's realm, congratulations
---
Tham cheaters! Finally found a breach on the Easy Anti Cheat system. &gt;:(
---
The reason why most educated people call it a hit box issue is because it‚Äôs the easiest term. ‚ÄúHitboxes‚Äù didn‚Äôt get larger when they activated dedicated servers. Hitboxes aren‚Äôt broken, it‚Äôs a latency issue.
---
You will always spawn outside of 16 meters from the killer, so even in that situation there is no need to walk.
---
And that's why I don't play Doc anymore
---
You have to play longer with them, not difficult√©s, juqt chase, don't hit and loose the game
---
Man, that cracked me up :D
---
Beard bad, glasses good
---
Just chase more 4Head
---
Yes it will, he is getting undetectable in tier 1, spine chill works against undetectable
---
I'm in Australia, Ive been getting decent (80) ping consistently in my games since the last update, same on ptb
---
The hole "3 people on 1 Gen with ruin can do at least 3 gems in 5 minutes" is a majority of the time false. Skill checks are too rng and I can barely get 2 gens done with only 2 people on a Gen if I'm lucky. It's kinda just... Rng? And I always get the teammates with 4 back to back skill check fails....
---
The screenshot of shame  https://imgur.com/XjPoCG8
---
Trapper, because that snapping sound is music to my ears. 
---
Pig, because reverse bear traps never get old. Also stealth and a shit scary running lunge.
---
Doctor, because I love his laugh whenever I shock someone and his tracking / stealth shutdown is pretty filthy.
---
Did you activate the cheat?
---
Yeah, which is good
---
What? Maps do not have infinite distance lol they can detect auras from 8 meters away without range addons.
---
If it's already marked on the map then you can see it from any distance, but that is obviously not what I was talking about.
---
Idk if it works with maps or not but I may test it real quick and let you know. I have 6 red maps and t3 open handed on my ash.
---
Also, what about detectives hunch? Do you think it adds 8 meters to that as well? I am thinking of a hilarious meme map build if all this works lol
---
It would be helpful if the text wasn‚Äòt in russian. So people could understand it and help
---
Welp, you use a flawed logic. I don't want to even bother to explain further if you cannot understand even that simple concept
---
Cursed Images
---
Sprint Burst Myers.
---
The legion was never 2 girls and 2 boys...
---
This but on Dedicated Servers where I go to grab you and you just fuck off anyway
---
I love how canvas is at the bottom left..good to know what the entity's target audience is. ü§£. Good artwork also!!!
---
I read it, and I‚Äôm still talking about hitboxes. The weapon reach compared to size of the weapon is wildly inconsistent between killers. Visually it‚Äôs confusing, even without latency issues.
---
"Why are the survivors trying to survive?  Wtf bro?"  It is not only acceptable but also rewarded.
---
I think they do that to encourage you to play both sides. I'm a survivor main and 9/10 times I get Killer dailies (when it doesn't glitch and dailies changes). It honestly pisses me off. I only like Ghostface, ffs game, I don't wanna chainsaw 3 fuckers with Billy
---
I do it for the points mainly. Noed is rare.
---
Since Dragonball Z people confuse Androids for Cyborgs.
---
Depends on the lobby but even a level 1 doctor might be enough for them to just DC upon seeing you. Some people just find the doc that unfun to play against.
---
Mettle of man would be great with a setup like inner strength, selfcare, and buckle up then you could just take hits like crazy-I know you xould also have adrenaline but its only a single use perk so id prefer having one of the others especially since most likely the killer has NOED
---
I ACTIVATE POT OF GREED
---
THIS LETS ME DRAW TWOOOOOOO CARDSSSS
---
Ruins almost a required perk though ds is not playing games without ruin is just a Christmas light show with all of the generators being finished in the first two minuets
---
HSUAHUAHSAUSHAUSHASHAS this keep getting better and better
---
i wanna see one more with these bastards before they realize they f\*\*\*ed up xD
---
thank you for making me smile in the morning, love your art!
---
Controversial opinion but I like Legion. I love being able to just chuck myself over pallets.
---
what horror fruit is that?
---
hide and seek was his first suggestion
---
Lol I already have bl and sf so it‚Äòs more or less usless for me
---
The shock timing is awful but you sort of get used to it after awhile. His main issue is that he is very map / playstyle dependent. He is very pigeon holed into a very small area of viability.
---
Hex: Good job so far
---
a david tbagged mid chase and all I had to do was blink 2 times and he got downed LMAO
---
And kindred
---
but for exploiting a bug....
---
Finally balanced landing
---
This. IS. AMAZING. thank you! sweet sweet karma.
---
one of these days I had three guys who did the same. Lucky for them, one had unbreakable. But still, love that. take my upvote!
---
not scared of survivors I just don't want salt messages on ps4 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
As an aside, if you are hungry for more BP:
---
In the Halloween event, each special gen done gives you extra points even if you didn‚Äôt burn the event offering. If you burn the event offering, every special gen someone completes gives you 3500 BP. Killers have special hooks, not sure how much they give. 
---
Play both Tutorials, it gives 50k BP.
---
The funny thing is that while it's a total dick move it's also probably how Amanda Young would play it irl
---
I think everyone is missing the point here. HE HAD 4 BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS AND THE HUNTRESS STILL SLUGGED. Only nasty poop head killer mains would do that... just remember that community.
---
Just read EULA you might get banned but people are saying you won't.
---
Nancy wheelers titties are so tiny I just want to take her with a and have her run around  with no bra just panties and get Susie passed out drunk
---
You had 3 opportunities to run, 3!
---
I've never had this, almost every survivor I played with was friendly, even if I got a 4k. 
---
However, my internet cut out once. A single survivor commented bruh on my profile.
---
You're being dramatic, if you know what you're doing you won't die anytime soon and 16 meters is plenty of time to stop running and walk in a different direction if you're worried about scratch marks.
---
I hate how the music in only one menu! It should be in lobby too! PS, I really love ST music, but also miss the OG one
---
This was literally me last night. I even told them after the game that I didn't plan on getting any kills because I'm a garbage doctor and that just made it worse. 
---
The person who thought I had been tunneling them was cool after I explained that I was just chasing who I found for my daily, though.
---
I know this thread is old by now but peanits literally confirmed what I said on the forum. https://imgur.com/cYxkooL
---
This approach to the problem is to inaccurate. You surprise 3 people working on a Gen, get a hit on 1 and 2 other survivors get a protection hit? What about you hide behind the wall where someone else gets hit. There are too many scenarios to solve this issue by simply checking the proximity. 
---
Also there are cases while the Killer is carrying someone and hits a survivor who was clearly not trying to protect someone.
---
There are so many variables from a logical standpoint alone, imagine to translate that to code. As long they can't clarify the intend of the Survivor getting hit the protection hit Idea is flawed in itself. In my opinion the reason why protection hits are so badly detected is they tried to do this.
---
They should scrap the Idea of protection hits and think about other ways to reward stacks to MoM in the way it fits the intended Theme of the Perk. I don't know any good solutions. They tried to award stacks for unhooking and the likes, but it still proved to be too easy to get stacks that way.
---
We need freddy costumes asap
---
is he also blinking?
---
Wait as a killer?
---
Nothing feels better than gen grabbing with pig

I don't think he can change that text. I'll try using google translate's image function

I say that basically every time, though I usually let at least one person go after a DC.

WhY dO i KeEp GoInG uP aGaInSt NuRsEs AnD sPiRiTs???
---
To be fair, while the pig nerfs were undeserved, she‚Äôs still not terrible, everyone underestimates her.
---
I teabag other survivors when they help me with something as a thank you. They generally do it back. I occasionally do it as killer if I'm playing pig and want to give someone hatch.
---
After a long string of mostly survivor dailies, I've been getting all killer. It happens.
---
I have no idea because it crashed before I could see
---
Now that I‚Äôm decent at killer I enjoy them all (I don‚Äôt play clown/nurse/spirit).
---
Trapper and Myers are my favorite to play.  Honorable mention Huntress.  She was my least favorite for the longest time.  These past few weeks she‚Äôs been my favorite.  I‚Äôm on console and finally realized she‚Äôs strong, even with controller aim.
---
thanks for the suggestion... definitely will do on the next vid..
---
For who doesn't understand the message, it says: Error starting application (0xc0000142).  To exit the application, click on the "ok" button.
---
Honestly gg is just a courtesy nowadays, wether or not it was actually a good game.
---
Dweet!!! &lt;3
---
i know but on  haddonfield going to a gen inside a building is waste of time, and i was finding survivor continuously, but yah thanks for the suggestion..
---
A good Spirit doesn't have any counterplay either. The real issue is that Spirit is one of the easiest killers to play, where nurse was very difficult to play, so at least the top tier nurses weren't noobs.
---
I wish I could say the same. I‚Äôve had some extremely nice survivors and some incredibly salty ones.
---
Nice perks sadly already own them. Would be nice to see at least one Ash perk on the shrine.
---
WAAAAAZZZAAAAAAAA
---
What about Flossing Joey?
---
Would be awesome if they would actually programm gestures for survivors and killers üòÑ
---
The scariest part of the game
---
Id have blocked him also, but hes probably just a bit odd.
---
Title game 9/10
---
Hang on, he has a chest tattoo?!
---
Well Ghost Face is currently Tru3's favorite killer and he has the most fun with him. Funny since it's a complete 180 from release, since Tru3 hated Ghost Face when he came out simply because he didn't know how to properly use the power, something I think a lot of people have a problem with when they think good ole Danny is bad.
---
well, you made me watch the video a second time because this comment. xD (first one was muted)
---
BL is more versatile. Besides the exhausted, you have less cooldown on landing. Tho is the hardest one to trigger. I always prioritize it before any other Haste perk
---
Nah, her addons really spice up the gameplay but its not as game breaking as her previous addon combos
---
He is more for the fun, otz is the teacher of dbd
---
Yeah, man. It‚Äôs like a flaming skull with wings.
---
I've had mine set to private for a long ass time
---
Nice. Haven't bought him, and tend to be running away like...well, a skull on fire.
---
Not the one in dbd
---
I know I really enjoy him as well! I just simply don‚Äôt consider him to be a very strong Killer. I even made a Detailed Statement about why I think he‚Äôs lacking but apparently some people only want to hear their Opinions to be repeated to them.
---
I don‚Äôt care that they have terrible game mechanix. I love my edgy bois and will pray every day for a rework to fix their power
---
gg?
---
Oh damn that is lucky. Thx
---
It is weird
---
Probably was trying to get you to reveal your home address through the tiniest detail because he thinks he can find where you live and ‚Äúpunish‚Äù you for just being good at the game compared to him when in reality even if you told him everything he wouldn‚Äôt be able to find a giant pig in a haystack and thus never find your location either.
---
Wow, that is some skill... Please never get put up against me.
---
Anyone know what categories?
---
I see it now. Thx
---
Legion has this ability that makes you DC no matter how you come across them. Legion post? Shut the app. Legion picture? Throw the whole computer out.

I don't even play demy but his they need to tone him down a little.. like... 10m? Because I can hear him scream after hitting someone all the way across coldwind

I've got 250+ hours so far and while I've seen survivors and killers DC from a game, I've never seen an entire team of survivors DC. 
---
Killers get a quitter bonus when a survivor DCs. Survivors get nothing when a killer DCs and still lose their offerings just like the killers.
---
It doesn‚Äôt beed a rework, it atleast needs to work properly. You don‚Äôt get stacks half of the time.
---
Must protect
---
I agree, wish more killers could be like Michael.
---
asking if someone‚Äôs a minor like that is the biggest red flag that i can think of
---
It's still DbD (kill survivors or escape from the killer), we're on our way to dedicated servers (painful), there's a big update coming with battlepass and lots of lore.
---
Yes that soup over there
---
... What
---
We all know what kind of person this was when Mettle was released...
---
I mean... You gonna get gen rushed and the guy will have his DS for when the second unhook happens and the gates are powered... But you do you I guess (if I'm tunneling might as well get that DS to the face and waste it)
---
Skins are useless. Perks can change your playstyle. But yeah, do whatever you please. I'd personally prioritize perks
---
Not in the slightest. I play both sides and my ideas were intended for balance purely to discourage disconnecting and lobby dodging. But please, continue to propagate your own agenda without any actual founding. An excellent argument.
---
Yep, we saw what was coming. The shit was obvious. They are all about money and will try to force people into buying dlcs. Make a new thread about Peanut's response and reference this thread to show any doubters that you 100% called this shit. BHVR deserves to be called out.
---
a battle pass...oh for fuck sake
---
It will be the 22nd, its usually 2 weeks after ptb is goes live. Im hoping all those terrible bugs are fixed by then event is short enough as is
---
If this weapon meant we‚Äôd be getting the Englund Freddy, then yes. If not, then no.
---
Is this the work of an enemy stand?
---
*Rohan noises*
---
Michael is basically the fan favourite dbd character in America and outside of the game I love it.
---
I don't understand why people DC. You really wanna lose 2 pips and items? Stay in the match ffs
---
I'm a lot more afraid of a rank 1 trapper than a rank 1 Billy or spirit.
---
These fuckers herd you like cattle and sometimes you don't realize until it's too late.
---
The shorter timer cuts both ways - survivors can more easily wait it out, and if you're hooking people every 40s then it's likely to be the case that Make Your Choice really isn't doing much for you.
---
In contrast to u/zadeyboy, I wouldn't recommend it on Hag, Spirit, or Nurse, but I *would* recommend it on Wraith. Hag can get better results by taking Save the Best for Last, since it dramatically shortens the time involved in a teleport hit, which will improve her overall experience. Nurse and Spirit can go from 0 to hook in under 40s, so at a certain skill level you're only slowing yourself down.
---
*Broadly speaking*, killers with instadowns don't need another instadown, "general mobility" killers can have full chases in under 40s, and tool/debuff killers get easier hits via their base power or through add-ons. 
---
Fred and Demorgorgon are exceptions that get big use because their teleports are proxy camp enablers with no practical range limit, making the perk is a flat-out improvement to their mindgames. The longer the duration, the longer the mindgame - noting that Fred's teleport will usually have a cooldown of around 40s.
---
Wraith and Doc can use it to mitigate the fact that they're Wraith and Doc. Personally I prefer the longer duration for these two, because both are terrible at loops and I want to be *very certain* that each hit is a hook. On Wraith I can use those 60s to milk out some Play with Your Food stacks (which *for me* feels a bit too risky at 40s), while for Doc it gives me a bit of Shock time (which helps in the long run because I really don't like the wait between T1 Madness and T3).
---
Very different kinds of skill tho. Trapper is memorizing survivor patterns and trap placement. Basically strategy stuff.
---
Nurse is all muscle memory and reflexes
---
Super cute, if that‚Äôs Frank Julie is gonna be pissed
---
There is a new map called hawkins laboratory and its mega defender sided
---
Do do do do do
---
&gt; 1.Half the time in End game their traps don‚Äôt even arm
---
Use them earlier
---
&gt; Sure, small loops you can make it a 50/50 with her dash
---
You need to improve your dash attacks.
---
&gt; but whose to say they don‚Äôt just run off while you‚Äôre charging
---
If you're against a runner - crouch, bait him to leave the loop, uncrouch, chase.
---
&gt; 3.Bear traps shouldn‚Äôt disable timer during chase, maybe make it slower while in chase instead
---
"I Pig, I tunnel". No, thanks.
---
&gt; She‚Äôs super difficult to use
---
Watch Scorpionz, learn from the best.
---
What are they supposed to do? Let you hook him?
---
I‚Äôm a killer main, and I consider this strat to be smart and not insulting. They are exchanging their own states for their fellow survivor‚Äôs escape.
---
It‚Äôs like how as a killer you don‚Äôt let all 3 survivors who are literally behind that rock Over there waiting for you to leave so they can hook rescue do the rescue safely, what are you supposed to do? Let them unhook when literally everyone your sole purpose is to kill is right there?
---
Survivors: feng, ace, david  
---
Killers: doc, huntress and hag  
---
Skins:  The 80's Suitcase DLC and The Bloodstained Sack DLC
---
People message me that I tunneled them even though they just didn't go far from hook or even heal.. they just went to a chest.. like I'm sorry I'm sorry you're the only one within 30meters of the noise
---
thanks!
---
Waaaaaaah
---
So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs fine her ability is completely useless in end game? Survivor main obviously.
---
Nope
---
I mean, those Ace and Meg were kinda cocky, but... Where was BM tho? I didn't see any tbags or flashlight clicking, they were just stupid imo
---
If it bothers you that much, just stop using ruin.
---
Tbh as a killer in super try hard so I never let people live but I will let up off the gas if I‚Äôm stomping
---
Wow, is he on stalking distance? Ahahhaah
---
I know it, but that's because I fucking love classic slasher movies, which led me to watching Scary Movie, which quickly became my favorite comedy film of all time lol.
---
But the killer couldn't grab him? People say healthy survivors can't be picked up mid animations but I think I already saw it happen
---
Flair checks out
---

*Diamond Dog noises*

Any teachables you've unlocked will remain unlocked.
---
If you go to the character's info screen then you'll see which ones you've unlocked.
---
Sometimes When you drop off the mountain you fall to a little Rock and then you fall to the floor and balanced landing doesnt activate
---
I really liked the idea, but sometimes it's funnier when it's not so obvious because (I believe) it feels like more of an inside joke
---
I didnt think gens went too fast until I started playing survivor.
---
Anyone else looking through the comments in hopes to r/whoooosh anyone?
---
Tell me how to delay the game with a Ghostface then
---
I don't believe!  
---
But It's science!!!!! üò™üò™üò™
---
The age part doesnt seem weird because i prefer not to talk to 10 year olds but it is weird to ask for your first and last name
---
Lol, she's my main killer (I play about 60% killer / 40% survivor).
---
Her main ability is dash, not traps. And traps are not useless, you just need to use them earlier.
---
Thanks I got the idea when I was rewatching Halloween and saw this kill
---
Generally the truth
---
wow nice 360s. I still can't manage to do it
---
Teabagging in DBD is a lot like jumping in older games with no text chat. 
---
It has numerous meanings depending on circumstance, how fast you are teabagging, which way you are facing, etc.
---
I use it to thank people a lot, if me and someone start next to eachother to show I'm excited, etc. I actually rarely use it as BM and that's only if the Killer was BM first.
---

---
What is the definition of being a slugger or slugging in games
---
Her main is the traps, that‚Äôs a majority of  all the addons effect it, and why the beartrap is the icon for her ability, not the dash.
---
Legions main ability isn‚Äôt vault, demigorgons isn‚Äôt his dash. It‚Äôs a passive.
---
I think there is room for both, honestly.
---
The "Get really powerful boosts for confronting the obsession", and the "Save the best for last" type.
---
It should absolutely be a trade off to take OoO on if you are going to be ignored or have a giant Target on your back.
---
Something like "enter Bloodlust faster when chasing the Obsession" would be a good start.
---
I never thought I would enjoy something like this so much.
---
As a survivor main.. I feel so sorry for the killers. I really don't get the part of trap placement. That's literally hag special ability, to catch you of guard with a trap, and her base speed isn't that good either. 
---
Don't worry about them. There always be those survivors. Ignore them and carry-on. I know that things like these kinda pushes you to be toxic, but try not to. If you see survivor DC's, give them hatch.
---
If killer see's the DC's and gives me some points, and exit, 99% of the time i ask killer to hang me, just so killer could get some points as well.
---
Be patient and don't let them bring you down to their level.

I was playing as Myers and was really having a rough go of it. I‚Äôm not great with him and never really liked the whole stalking thing.
---
Didn‚Äôt hook anyone till there were 3 generators and they were moving quickly. I got the last laugh however. Since I got my second survivor hooked after the exit gate opened, Blood Warden activated. 
---
One survivor left before BW activated. I also had NOED (wasn‚Äôt till the game ended that I realized I‚Äôd made a half ‚Äúend game‚Äù build). So I had just sacrificed a survivor, had one on the hook, and the last one must have not known I could see him at the exit gate with BW. What was a mostly mediocre or even shitty match for me turned into a 3K.
---
I took a salt bath in survivor tears afterward...
---
Can't have your cake and eat it bud. You can delay it by finding survivors before they complete their Gens.
---
Even better when they actually run into it meaning two downs for the price of one.
---
Dude, stop, he's already dead.

Its sometime appropriate to inject some humor into the situation.

If I wasn‚Äôt poor I‚Äôd gift you gold , knew the song before I even got to the end ahah, nicely done.
---
I just feel bad for them, you gotta be pretty terrible at the game if you can't hit skillchecks despite it being such a big part of survivor gameplay
---
It would be odd getting banned for something u didn't do on purpose
---
Yeah it can, otherwise either one would work without a cooldown, and the game would be broken.
---
Hawkins, Gideon and Lery's are really good on Nurse if you know what you're doing
---
No that's gen rushing.
---
"I believe God forgives even murder."
---
I'm very thankful for the small, select few that will say "gg dude" after I get destroyed as a new killer I'm learning. You guys are the best
---
That's very specific but it could be an example. Tunneling is just when the killer targets a survivor for one reason or another. A lot of the time the killer will go after the already injured survivor because it's easier than going after a healthy survivor, but in doing that they are tunneling
---
I have this head canon that Ghostface would actually be the one to be messing with them, since they're the closest things to real victims he can legit stalk in the Entity's realm.

Just chill, they are unsecure little souls who are happy they didnt die the third time before 2 gens are done :)
---
this is the third time that they‚Äôve released it, the first time being nearly ten months ago. i‚Äôm not trying to suggest bhvr isn‚Äôt trying but they could surely do better given the time they‚Äôve had.
---
I've always wondered if a grab is scarier than turning the camera to just see him standing there. 
---
Personally I lean towards the latter, if only because it's easier to tell if someone is freaked out when they Dead Hard into a wall, or just stand stock still because they dropped their controller.
---
Am I the only one who think that farmer johns voice is hotter than raccoon eggs?
---
So if you're going for bodyblocks, yolo saves or risky gen repairs just after killer have left you're BMing? Because in many cases they are cocky actions yet justified in terms of survivor's objective
---
I just think he is possibly the strongest pure stealth killer right now, it's taking until now for people to finally realize he is actually really good, and he's one of the few killers who can effectively win matches without resort to the standard M1 killer chase most of the time.
---
So far anyone I've seen who says he's bad either plays him like Myers for stalking, or simply does the standard expose then chase when using his power then complains that he just gets looped all the time, but he is so much more than that. Catching survivors off guard, sneaking up on them when they least expect, being inconsistent and randomly breaking chase with 1 to sneak up on another (I would say that's literally the purpose of his 2 perks I'm All Ears, and Furtive Chase, in helping you suddenly switch targets and catch others off guard).
---
You don't even have to ALWAYS use stalk when using his night shroud, masking your TR and red stain while crouching is already a strong enough ability for him, with the stalk just being an added bonus for those insta downs. Being able to catch even the strongest survivor off guard can net an easy hit or down for him and snowballing from there becomes effective since people won't always know where you are. He doesn't suffer from the problem of most other low tier killers or even most mid tier killers where even if you use your power effectively, you still ultimately have to resort to the standard M1 chase most of the time to start getting downs; such as **Doctor**, Legion, Wraith, Pig, Clown, Michael, Plague(if they don't cleanse) or Trapper and to an extent Bubba(simply due to his inability to use his power half the time). Thusly making him one of the better killers a lot of the time.
---
If RBT is her main ability for you, you will have problems playing her, sorry to break it to you.
---
This is a solid post genuinely hope some new people considering getting this game read it! Only input I have is your point about impossible loops, sometimes you are better or by knowing that it‚Äôs a really tough loop for the killer giving it maybe one shot at a mind game and then changing targets or patrolling back to a gen you know has been worked on or is close to completion. Sometimes this flexible mentality has helped me keep games competitive longer and sometimes it has backfired haha I think it is one thing people get a better feel for the more they play!
---
Isn't pig like considered medium high tier. Like her traps are still a considerable slow down the game and can even have a small chance of resulting in someone dying without u doing squat. The fact you make survivors run away from a loop is literally the best results from that mind game u can get resulting in them getting zoned out.
---
Consider this if you take pigs kit she goes into stealth which a close to passive slow down game you could say she is a better wraith *now yes wraith is different ik ok* crouching mind games are rly effective
---
Nothing is more annoying than loading into a game as survivor and someone rage quitting a minute into the game . Wastes everyone‚Äôs time
---
Now this is a meme
---
I don't want to accept that.
---
Unless you're camping the hill. Or your close enough. Or you know where the high tops are. RiP. I know well, and but it's hard to always be in position while trying to stay productive.
---
I'm a survivor main, only play Ghosty sometimes. Never DC'd because I wanted, don't plan on doing it. It's just idiotic losing potentially 2x more because you couldn't stay a couple more minutes into the match. It just ruins the fun of who just wanna play
---
I can't bring myself to kill him
---
Also i thought that was dumb at first because of those 2 specific perks but theres more exhaustion perks that i dont use or dont have
---
It's almost as if the entire community can be toxic
---
Hopefully, in the near future, but they haven't announced anything yet. I only think Billy, bubba and doctor is the only confirmed to get some love.
---
Your going to go right to the entity at this point
---
What are you talking about? The Exit gates were open andI had no idea where they are! All they had to do is escape but they stayed and decided to crouch in front of killer. Survivors objective is to survive. So how‚Äôs that normal to you?
---
Fuck, now you've given me the idea to make Yu-Gi-Oh cards based on DbD.
---
Ive been playing for over a year and am just now realizing this
---
Its a subreddit for people who look both 13 and 30
---
Why is this so true
---
You can run multiple.. as long as you get rid of exhaustion in between. In the case of balanced it will always apply the reduced stagger (meaning you always recover from drops faster) whether you are exhausted or not, you just won‚Äôt get the added speed boost with it.
---
Ah yes, down vote me for having a different opinion. But seriously. I paid for the game and every single DLC released. I can do what I want. I don't care for your enjoyment. Just like I'm sure 75% of killers don't care if survivors have fun :3
---
9/10 times i've been accused of tunneling the survivors brought zero perks that can prevent me from doing so, do a terrible job of running away after being unhooked, apply crap gen pressure or just heal under hook whilst in my terror radius..
---
just started playing as legion.  90% of the time, if I use feral frenzy and just chase after whoever is revealed by the ability, the last person i hit in range of it just happens to be the last person i hooked.
---
When I was little me and my grandpa used to look for trees you could take them of. But today was the first time eating one in like more than 15 years did remember then not this great but now I ate so much my stomach begin hurting. And the weird human flesh thing I could see too.
---
1k hours be like "I got a pebble and I'ma throw it"
---
I hate it when I switch target, hook this target, then I find that person who I didnt wanted to tunnel and still get ds on my face, like really, this perk should last shorter if killer is away or something
---
Fixated and whys that
---
What do you play it on Pc, Xbox, or PS4?
---
I respect suvivors who still face such a challenge and don't leave like little babies.
---
In the sense of try hook me again
---
Doesn't matter how u tell people this or when BHVR says what the problems are it's obviously hitboxes.....
---
U got no0b3 in the corner complaining about his network going down quite often and still thinks it is hitboxes like what
---
Survivors will often stay not because they want to BM or even to be cocky, but because they want to help their teammates to escape if possible.
---
That said, what the guys from your clip was definitely cocky. I'm just saying that being cocky isn't equal to being toxic.
---
Used to be if a disconnect happened, survivors kept their stuff. The game as a peer to peer cannot differentiate between you pulling the plug or the killer. Survivors abused this by DCing on death hook to keep their items, so it was changed.
---
Now yes but who expects everyone to read subreddit
---
Wow you‚Äôre a cunt, just shows how shit and dumb you are too.
---
Oh be quiet
---
Are those supposed to be what comes with buying the game for only ps4? Because i have spent no money on in game purchases and have all of those
---
I will teach him to survive
---
With death
---
Purple ranks are new players, don‚Äôt judge people because they‚Äôre new. It‚Äôs not even red ranks which is the average player from the stats in summer.
---
Sometimes survivors go to a corner to heal, so when I spot them with BBQ, they tend to call me a tunneller. Like it‚Äôs not my fault that you have to heal in a corner with self care that takes 40 seconds

To the edit: DS lasts 1 minute at max pal, there are no other perks to prolong it. If these memories aren't from 2018 then you're confusing something
---
It can‚Äôt be bargained with. It can‚Äôt be reasoned with. It doesn‚Äôt feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.
---
Oh you mean, teabagging, body blocking, intentionally taking DS grabs from a locker at the gate, and standing by the gate with the switch at 99% until you walk over isnt being nice? 
---
I agree with you, Brother.
---
No joke, somehow I *knew* it'd be the n-word as soon as I opened the topic.
---
Literally jumped up and said hot damn.
---
Also fuck that guy.
---
I think Pig would be fine if they just made her traps more useful.
---
Shes an example of a character thats ‚Äúfallen off‚Äù as new characters and reworks have come out.
---
Ghost Face is better at stealth
---
Demigorgon is a better dash
---
And theres plenty of perks that stall out the game better than her traps.
---
But theres not currently any killer who really fills that niche as having stalls in their base kit.
---
Currently, traps are too easy to disarm, only have four opportunities to trigger and be useful, and are not a legitimate threat to the survivors in any way.
---
1. Traps are triggered when the survivor is unhooked
---
2. Longer Interaction Times with Jigsaw Boxes
---
3.  Add-on that causes traps Impede all Action Speed and cause more frequent skillchecks while active
---
4. Remove the charge time from her crouch. Ridiculous.
---
5. Add-ons that remove time from Traps when skillchecks are failed, shortening the timer with each failed skillcheck.
---
4. Make sure the boxes are spread out more. Only the closest box should be shown to the survivor.
---
In fact i did it by mistake sorry..

I‚Äôm always stunned with things like this because of how technologically advanced our world is and it seems like next to nobody knows how anything works.

I‚Äôm really stubborn, I‚Äôll probably keep trying to educate people till it results in a stroke.

Kill rushing isn‚Äôt a thing (tunneling).
---
Gen rushing is sitting on gens while a teammate hits second phase.  Sitting on a gen when the killer is ten feet away.  Getting unhooked and jumping on a gen next to the hook before healing.  Ect.
---
We might not agree on the definitions, but tunneling and gen rushing are a thing.  They‚Äôre also effective tactics.
---
Oh I wasnt being a dick :) 
---
No. Tunneling is when you follow one survivor and blatantly refused to go for anyone else. :/ it's happened to me as Claudette more than once. I get a racist message after like "All Ni**ers must die."
---
Spirit too.
---
I mean, go right ahead, don't see why you need to swear to try and prove your point.
---
Good thing I've only been on this sub for two days, or else I'd know the sheer number of times this has been posted.
---
you just mentioned the game has poor optimization and then said it was his fault in the same sentence. this game is ass ugly, no reason why it should be poorly optimized.
---
i dont think i'd have the disk space for a mod that big.

DbD has a log file that protocols all kinds of stuff. This log used to say "max tick rate 60" and it still does now. Whether that means the servers actually run at 60 ticks is another question, but the max tick rate variable (namely "NetServerMaxTickRate") is used in the Unreal Engine to set tickrate.
---
60 is apparently the default (so it is probable BHVR just didn't touch it, as they generally seem to not do much with the Unreal Engine variables), and should be sufficient for DbD. Would be interesting to see how the game performs and feels on higher tickrate servers. But what is almost equally as important as server tickrate is the packet transfer rate, or the amount of times per second the server exchanges information with its clients - to really reap the benefits that the increased precision of higher tickrates provide, the server needs more client data, and the clients more server data. On the PTB, there was an issue with uncapped client framerates, which leads me to believe the client commandrate was uncapped on there (a data packet transfer every frame), flooding and confusing the server. Since that doesn't seem to happen anymore, they've probably capped the transfer rate.
---
I would also like for BHVR to share details about their servers, if not the hardware and performance stats, at least their server settings.
---
anyone think Mr. X would make a good addition to the killers?
---
go teach people that a router isn't what they think it is and they are referring to a access point bc a router is completely different
---
When that happens I usually end up slugging the person who got unhooked but don't hook them again til they've had enough time to get back up. The more time they spend healing each other the less time they're on gens, so it's not completely unhelpful to do that.
---
I wasnt trying to be a dick ^-^ sorry if that came off mean. Yes, what you're describing is tunneling.
---
Graphic doesn‚Äôt mean that the game is well optimised you degenerate

Sometimes they get really laggy, I hit them more often than not, I actually find it easier to hit ruin skill checks than greats without it sometimes, but I do encounter games that have laggy ones I cant hit, console frame rates ftw!
---
here is the thing unlike the old legion infinite mending bug which BHVR said "hey don't do this you will get banned" which is how they should warn people, how are they gonna see "oh this guy meant to exploit it" when in reality he probably just tried to use a splinter saw it didn't work came back to switch killers and saw a new killer unlocked who would not play that new killer

Oooo, Can I get a link to read up on it?

---
That's just me waiting for my mom to go to bed so I can eat the entire bag of shredded cheese
---
wait, base game or special edition?
---
I never played killed before but if I did I would tunnel? It gets rid of a person who could be getting generators or healing someone. I don‚Äôt even get mad anymore if I get tunneled. Sounds fair
---
Oh, well when you put it that way, what?
---
Oh, didn't see that at first
---
He's also in trend xD
---
I loved how he is annoyed with the extra survivor xD
---
Probably the only 2 complaining about it are that Jake and the killer.
---
*Of the ones you've listed*, the "best" would likely be Demogorgon.
---
Demogorgon has a form of fast travel, which allows them to pressure the whole map. Their power gives them a limited form of tracking, which helps find survivors. They have "decent" default perks, *if* you can trigger them. Their Shred is good for ending chases.
---
Note that "best" in this instance is somewhat lower than the "Big Three" killers that dominate the game at high ranks.
---
Sounds like a real life PS4 version of The Cable Guy.
---
in certainly helps when a game has lesser graphics that it should run better. Are you denying that fact?
---
Why are you trying to put words in my mouth? I never said kill rushing was a thing. Tunneling quickly becomes ineffective when you go up in rank anyways. Tier3 DS becomes way more common. Survivors have nothing else to do besides Gens. Killers have to patrol. Chase, damage generators, and keep pressure. What are you going to tell me doing chests is something? Besides if the killer is good you won‚Äôt be getting gen rushed. Hook someone early and get pressure on them. Bring ruin to slow them down.
---
int3r4ct is a good dbd youtuber to watch if you're trying to learn more about killers.
---
Okay, thank you!
---
Special Edition *is* "the base game" on PS4.
---
Oh ok!
---
It would be tunnelling AND camping, because if what the commenter said is accurate, the killer didn't even try to go for somebody else.
---
Focusing is another thing entirely, and is not problematic.
---
I don‚Äôt have enough patience for that, that‚Äôs grade A stroke material right there. I had a few friends ask me what I learned through Cisco and I just gave up trying to put everything in layman‚Äôs terms. They sorta get router so good enough.
---
You could say the animation is the issue or the hitbox is the issue. I don‚Äôt want every killer‚Äôs hitbox to be the same, I‚Äôd prefer the hitboxes to be changed to match up with the killer‚Äôs animation, with maybe minor animation changes. I think the variety would make it more interesting. You‚Äôre really enjoying making personal attacks in every comment you make huh. Grow up and have a discussion like an adult.
---
I'm pretty sure the tattoo is on his throat not his chest
---
"There is no Easter bunny, there is no Tooth Fairy, and there is no Nurse meta."
---
Hag should be in A tier and Leatherface should be moved up a spot imo
---
Small brain. Lost on the map (50% of the time) too me everything looks the same lol. 
---
Yeah lithe is cool, but the window hitboxes are atrocious (lag)
---
Of the internet\*
---
It's pretty common to get hit by DS 1 or 2 hooks later.
---
Agreed. I feel like Obsession swapping should just be a baseline mechanic through one function or another.
---
Granted it really makes the name "Obsession" feel weird though.
---
I‚Äôd like them to redesign the hat. His fedora in game looks awful, and not realistic at all.
---
if everyone has deliverance, only 2 people are getting to use it at most lol
---
Is 99ing a gate considered toxic? It just makes sense to not start the timer if you wanna go back in to save someone.
---
Decisive strike is nothing now. It wasn‚Äôt even nerfed. They changed it to such a hyper-specific context that it‚Äôs not even the same perk.
---
I also didn‚Äôt know that purple flashlights were so effective.... are they? I haven‚Äôt used one in a while.
---
And I think that it shouldn't work that way, it's too safe, and corrects mistakes
---
lol
---
Except that's rarely the logic. The people that still play as sweaty tryhards when DCs happen know full well what the fuck they're doing and they do not care. It'd be just as easy to let the other two survivors farm with you so at least everyone walks away with a decent amount of BPs. Slaughtering them after a couple DCs still doesn't net you more points overall than being sympathetic and farming with them would.
---
Ever heard of limited skill ceilings? Can only get as good as the killer is
---
Look, I‚Äôm saying if you want to change the animation to fit the hitboxes, then you‚Äôre saying the animation is the issue. If you want to change the hitboxes to match the animations, then you‚Äôre saying the hitboxes are the issue. Whichever way you go with it is subjective. I‚Äôm just saying I want the hitboxes changed to match the animations. I‚Äôm getting tired of arguing with you because you seem to have a brain bleed or something, go to a doctor.

10/10 post

You can tell the bad Nurses from the good ones by who complains about having "only two Blinks".
---
Is Pop + Thrilling a usable combo?
---
I bet you're completely okay with squads running multiple instaheals, commodious boxes and haddonfield offerings with Balanced Landing because "it's a playstyle".
---
Open Handed is okay for niche builds, and for people who don't Ace it can be good to grab so you're further incentivized not to get Ace to pollute your Bloodweb with Up The Ante.
---
With BHVR recently having the ability to  retool Freddy a bunch, I'm fairly certain that this is just a licensing hiccup. Opening up more talks about licensing may even lead to Bubba and Freddy cosmetics in the future.
---
That's a personal choice. Eventually you might level Nea for urban evasion anyway. I just choose not to buy perks from killers/survivors that I already own.
---
yeah
---
Yup, when i made this i only thought about the animation.
---
I play solo and have never used health care once. From everything I‚Äôve seen it is a trash perk that 80% of players are running.
---
Ah, well i don't have any expansion packs so sucky sucky
---
&gt;you can't pick someone who's being healed
---
WHAT. I had no idea.
---
Quick followup question - In this situation, if you are the person doing the healing and get hit by the killer, would that count as a protection hit?
---
Look man. They're not on my team and I'm not on theirs. No I dont like it, but I'm not crying about it either.
---
Grabs are broken right now, stalking has a better payoff for sure
---
Why use her for her dash when ghost has a better stealth and an exposed ability
---
Forever Freddy
---
Mmmm yes. Iron Will very mindgame it is.
---
Seeing the rework in action it's a lot better than we expected but I still hate how Nurse is now overly addon reliant like every other Killer. She's practically unplayable without addons which I really don't like. It's stupid that Killer requires a 10000 investment just to be played.
---
what?
---
Yeah! They're honestly super good if you have good aim! And, update, the devs are removing insta heals from game. Thank the gods.
---
EAC thinks my motherboards rgb software is harmful and wont launch the game but this guy can speedhack.
---
Hillbilly and myers are my favorite my least favorite is hag and spirit
---
You're the one in control of the game at that point. You can choose to be a dick or you can choose to be sympathetic. You just choose to be the former, you've made that abundantly clear.

https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ccpssq/to_all_these_red_rank_survivors_from_a_red_rank/
---
I doubt he knew that.
---
Except it is
---
Welcome to the sub ^^
---
Healthy survivors can be picked up off a gen, a hex and a chest I think. Otherwise, the survivor has to be injured in order to be picked up while going through a window or over a pallet. No idea about healing though.
---
Keep the aura hidden from other survivors, so if they try to open the locker, they get a lovely surprise instead.
---
Either theyll get bored of having easy 3v1 matches, get frustrated thet it turned in to a 4 man DC or get mad they keep losing their add ons to lame matches.
---
Either way im on to next game. Simply dont care to play against sweatmasters in a casual game.
---
If you're actually playing I get it. But I'm talking about the survivors who 99 it and sit there and teabag until you walk over.
---
Thb most of the newer maps have pretty decent totem spots. But before the Springwood rework this would be 100% true
---
If you could not destroy hex ruin it would be nearly impossible to win games unless the killer is just that bad
---
I'd assume Frank, it's not Joey's mask
---
what are you talking about? I responded perfectly fine. You just have no counterargument lmfao
---
Wait, so does this apply to healing injured survivors as well as dying survivors? So if I start healing an injured survivor and the killer tries to hit them, will it hit me?
---
ok then, you are right, use dead hard
---
To apply enough pressure to keep 4 survs off gens you basically need to be everywhere at once. Getting a cheeky kill early can help a lot, but its normally always best to go for uninjured survivors when you see them, and slug often. Not tunneling isnt just about targeting one survivor, when you do that you leave 3 of them to just do gens in safety.
---
I recall it definitely being 2 minutes. Nothing can tell me otherwise. I recall exactly it was 2 minutes.
---
Yep a hag did that to me the other day but I didnt have DS. And the only reason I died wss because they had a shit connection to the game and caused lag.
---
Mom: "yes, you go ahead and get your turn on the Xbox."
---
Cousin:
---
Jesus, your commentsection is full of complaining about survivors. The game is not that serious.
---
Dude. I have 4 perks 2 addons and on offering running against 4 items, 8 addons, 16 perks, 4 offerings and 4 survivors. If all 4 bring "toxic" addons and items I'm totally fucked.
---
He might just be anti social and wanting to branch out by being overly nice. Who knows.
---
Pig is better than most mid-tiers, stop with this dumb nerf-pig meme and get good
---
You‚Äôre likely to lose 2 pips and items anyway. It‚Äôs just skips the middle man I guess
---
I can understand staying if you need to save or heal someone, but any other reason seems too risky
---
How are you not a regular on r/gamingcirclejerk
---
I like plague's mori, it's sassy
---
Leatherface/wraith camping with insidious/invi is common in low rank.
---
Why? If he‚Äôs playing killer it‚Äôs not that unlikely that he‚Äôs tried any grabs during the past week
---
Very curious. I would have been almost certain that the console version was always marketed as the Special Edition, at least in the EU and NA.
---
Alright lemme know how well you do as bubba in rank 3
---
You actually went back and read my comment section? Lmao dude I'm not complaining about survivors, I'm complaining about the ass hole ones who think they have a separate set of rules for killers. "Dont tunnel, dont camp, oh you killed me I'm gonna call you horrible names and cry about reporting you over nothing." You think I cry when I'm hooked? No. It's the game.
---
That's a given, we still want the mama's boy though
---
Ohh I see. Yeah, Ruin is the strongest perk in the game if you get a really good spawn. Your team needs two good loopers if you can't find it
---
I reccomend watching otzdarva play. He's really fun to watch and explains everything as he plays. If you catch him live he answers a lot of questions too
---
Because fixated just helps you see where you ran which is pretty easy to know unless youre on the newest map were lightweight will make your tracks disappear quicker to help you get away better and fixated is kinda useless so long as you knew where you ran which isnt hard to tell
---
Yup  and that shit will legitimately cost you a game too
---
I mean who cares anymore you just have to say router bc the uneducated are gonna go "tf is a access point"
---
You need to pair it with Enduring to get usage out of it, b/c it still applies the pallet stun time. Get it for basically every m1 killer, aka ones who dont have a power to help them in loops. So you'll want it on Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Doctor, Leatherface, Freddy, Pig, Clown, Plague, and Ghostface. The others either have perks that benefit them more despite being M1 killers, or have stuff to help them in loops. 
---
Like Myers - he's an M1 killer, but he benefits from Monitor and Abuse much more than SF/Enduring.
---
How do I delete someone else's post.
---
it's not a choice when you just do what you do
---
When you get what you want but not what you need
---
Yes, with the caveat that you want to be careful not to accidentally block That One Gen you *really* want to kick.
---
I mean yeah lol but I'm not present for the camping... just my trapssss
---
The vast majority of games have the survivors bringing no items, and most of the best builds require you to mix and match perks from multiple survivors, with many of those being behind the paywall of dlc characters. Look at what usually actually happens rather than the Fringe possibilities, or save those items for high ranked games rather than bringing out instadowns in grey/green ranks.
---
That's not even comparable. Rip scratched mirror plays
---
It‚Äôs faster to just work through it, tapping only benefits the killer.
---
But Jeff is God
---
Laughs louder in ebony mori
---
You can get at most 2 hits from unhooking which really isn‚Äôt that much considering the fact that you can go patrol a gen after you hit them or go for someone else. Also as said before a lot of the time you can‚Äôt go for the unhook due to being chased or hooked and even when you do there are sometimes people there before you. Ive tried to get WGLF stacks and it‚Äôs impossible to get to 4 due to the fact that people beat you to it so you don‚Äôt get the stack. Protection hits also have a tendency to not work on MoM, but that‚Äôs not as relevant t this. 2-3 extra hits on one person isn‚Äôt as crippling as being able to gain distance/go through trapper‚Äôs traps/go to a loop from each person every time with dead hard.
---
Than make one so people can see what the issue is
---
Oh I see. Thanks.
---
I disagree. If you know how to stay hidden you'll never get caught. It's not my job to give them a change to escape, I'm the killer. I'm supposed to kill you, all of you. Why would I allow you to escape? 
---
No shade. Just saying:)
---
Np!
---
I hate when the killer has bad ping, the other day I loaded into a game with 1000 ping version a legion. I disconnected fairly quickly
---
My boy deserves everything
---
If you buy me the PLAG the post will instantly delete
---
&gt;All of you
---
If you're watching 1 player the entire time than that's basically a guaranteed 1k with 3 escapes
---
A loose patrol around the hook works better, but you gotta give the hook space or else you'll just sit there all game with no one even trying to unhook
---
I dont know where you're playing but that's never happened to me past rank 20. It's always a SWF who brings a fuck load of op shit. And I'm not complaining, I enjoy the challenge. What I'm saying here is its bull shit to point fingers at the killer when the survivors who cry about everything run the "crutch" perks. Dont die or dont cry.
---
Bing bong man, cornering people and spooking them
---
What do you use to play dbd.
---
Useless perk Pog
---
PGTW and Thrilling Tremors? Yeah, especially if you dont have or want to play ruin.
---
Well, I dont like camping because I lose blood points so. Yeah I hook and go for the next guy. But that's just how I  play.
---
this
---
I am very excited for this day.
---
YES!
---
A *good* hag doesn‚Äôt use her traps to camp. A good hag would run make your choice and one hit down the rescuer.
---
I have no fucking clue how far survivors want to contort the term tunneling, I guess until they find a reason why I'm a tunneling piece of shit. 
---
Had a game playing as basement trapper and got called for tunneling the Jane when it was only her and Laurie left saying I should have looked for Laurie instead because I tunneled her even tho she was first to be hooked and I didn't touch til that point.
---
That's so cute. Good job!
---
Hexy got banned for this so maybe you should report it :)
---
I slightly prefer the wraith mori than the trapper one. I think it's slightly cooler
---
Objectively, focusing the weakest target is logically the smartest play, if they don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äútunneled‚Äù they should run DS.
---
Survivor Bad, Killer Good
---
&gt;especially if you dont have or want to play ruin.
---
Both, actually. I wanna slow down the game with Ghosty, and I thought this'd pair really well with Pop. Maybe even Discordance + Pop
---
The fuck in fuck over was used to describe what you were doing. Fuck brings more of an intensity than screw over also who cares if he swears.
---
I know but demogorgon eats better Cuz yes
---
How, huh? I‚Äôm waiting.
---
being exhausted stops your balanced landing sprint burst, but it doesn't stop your balance landing 75% stagger reduction, which you get whether you are exhausted or not
---
Wait what
---
Clown with discordance and tinkerer, I like lobbing bottles on the gen with no heartbeat for the scare factor and watching everyone panic and scatter
---
I'm joking around boio
---
It kinda is Mike noed. Both are really strong, sure, but both perks punish a certain play style. Decisive strike punishes mainly tunneling, although it is possible to get hit by it without tunneling, but I think it is designed to punish tunneling killers. Noed punishes survivors, who don't care about totems, which isn't much of a sin, but in many cases groups of survivors who ignore totems are genrushing, so maybe its designed to make genrushing a hard decision?
---
I do t really know about it, but these are my first thoughts
---
I was in a lobby where the killer had 856 ping lol. I left that lobby so fast.
---
Also, they‚Äôre 40 meters away, they should be able to predict that the killer has BBQ.
---
Why do killers disconnect when things are not going their way? Like....who hurt you? Don't ya wanna learn how 2 kill? Practicing is the only way
---
just got a game which i killed 3 ppl with myc and they had nerve to call me a tunneller lmaoooo
---
No, searching a chest makes a LOT of noise.
---
Survivors say they dc cuz "its not fun to play against" but what about all y'all bring Haddon Field offerings with 2 flashlights, 2 toolboxes, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, DS, BT and a whole bag of insults to call the killer when they make the tiniest mistake.
---
So I noticed that I have ‚ÄúUnbreakable: Rare William Bill Overbeck Perk‚Äù unlocked on my Meg, but my William is a lvl 1 with no teachables unlocked. Glitch?
---
perfect
---
Best spirit fan art ever
---
remember if nobody is an obsession ur good and theres no ds
---
Humanity is weird.
---
As Ricky Gervais says. ‚ÄúDunno why I named this show Humanity, not a big fan of it to be honest.‚Äù
---
As a huntress main I hate high ping, I don‚Äôt have bad internet btw. I feel like I‚Äôm ruining the experience for others.
---
Every game
---
TOXIC TUNNELING KILLER if you do, EZ if you don't.
---
instEAD of saying get good, pls explain more your point.
---
Why would he? The guy who got off the hook is already injured and is the logical target.
---
Maybe it seems survivour sided because there are 4 survivours for every 1 killer?
---
even as a survivor main, it‚Äôs so funny seeing other survivors after a killer face camped and actually tunneled going fucking insane
---
you cant grab a survivor that is healing.  
---
i mean why would you be able to "grab" a survivor that is standing up. makes no sense
---
No, just dying.
---
Not live in NA.
---
Up the ante is great for plunderers builds
---
While Demo is strongest, you also have to consider fun. 
---
Personally I think Ghostface is a blast. And he does have the ability to turn off his red stain and crouch which is useful for loop mindgames at higher ranks. 
---
That said none of those have ESSENTIAL meta perks so feel free. 
---
For the record, pig and legion are considered two of the weakest killers.
---
I forgot the /s with ‚Äúkill rushing isn‚Äôt a thing‚Äù.
---
It got even crazier with the XYZ monsters. It was no longer "you need this and this and you can synchro summon this", it was simply "take this and anything that makes up the amount of stars" while half the monsters had effects that allowed you to recycle them. 
---
You could set up a whole board of monsters in a single turn and win the match. The newest addition, Link, tried to put a leash on all the rapid special summons where you only had a single zone for XYZ, Synchro and Link monsters while link monsters have arrows that enable the zone they point to for further summons. (Shit was still too crazy and they nerfed it again afaik).
---
Exactly. Or just go in a locker
---
Why did you draw a portrait of my dad?
---
Well you're not just having a differing opinion you're being smug about it. "I don't give a shit about you guys....... oh yeah downvote me for no reason, ok!!!!" See I'm being an asshole to you now so downvotes are warranted.
---
And that kids is why you gtfo
---
Whether a survivor gets tunnelled or not is not up to the survivor, its up to the killer. They can run BT and DS but it only stalls tunnelling.
---
Focusing the weakest target is not the strongest play, you can‚Äôt just forget about gens.
---
&gt; Yeah because its fun seeing the same killer basically every game
---
That's the fault of the devs who refuse to buff mid-low tier killers to high tier viability, and constantly listen to people like you who want high tier killers nerfed to satisfy your egos. Players aren't going to play shit tier killers just to be edgy, if they suck they won't get played period. People like you want all killers to be shit tier so that we'll have no choice but to play shit killers or leave the game.
---
Again, this is the fault of survivors and the spineless devs who listen to said survivor mains, not killer mains. Survivor mains should be the ones who suffer after YEARS of petitioning the devs into their bad decision making, not killer mains. They've made their bed and should lie in it.
---
&gt; basically every game with super strong add ons which are totally overpowered.
---
Her strongest are Mother-daughter ring and Prayer Beads bracelet. A very rare and ultra rare, hardly an amazing group of addons. Even with these two (just two) strong addons she's still below current Nurse. Not an overpowered addon set in the least.
---
&gt; Even when you manage to "outplay" her, there is no reward. With reactivation add ons she can just do it again.
---
When you outplay her she has to wait on a cooldown. A cooldown which is longer than several other killers. She's already the second slowest killer without her power. Her power is suppose to make up for her slow speed, not hinder players from using said power. We do not want another "reworked" Legion just to satisfy the lower skilled survivor mains.
---
&gt; And bumping into someone by accident or on purpose doesnt seem very skill needed for me.
---
Anticipating where the survivor is moving using using the ground, grass, breathing..while being blind.. while outplaying any perks said survivor may have.. takes a lot more skill than cleansing a totem or hitting 4 gen skill checks over the course of a minute. There is only one side of this game which requires more skilled play, and it sure as hell isn't the killer side.
---
&gt; All the mindgames are on her side.
---
She's a mindgame killer, she's suppose to be great it. She is the killer, she's the hunter. You're the prey. She is playing against 4 people with better perks than her (and survivors do indeed have better perks than killers by a long shot). 16 perks to her 4, and some of her perks can be cleansed and removed from the trial completely. Tell me more about how difficult survivors have it when one of their perks that they wasted points on can be removed from the game.
---
&gt; What i want is the spirit to have a simular skill cap to the Nurse.
---
Even with the skill cap of the Nurse lower skilled survivor mains complained to delusional low skilled devs to get her base nerfed. Such survivor mains don't want skilled killers, they want weaker killers period. And they don't give a damn how they go about getting it. I'll give you this though - at least you didn't say you wanted a killer "fun to play against" this time, cause I see through that crock play on words each and every time.
---
&gt; With no hitbox while phasing it actually becomes a mindgame and you actually have to use your ears instead of phasing around the pallet hoping to bump into someone.
---
But will it stop there? Nah.. those survivors and the devs would go the extra mile and add a longer cooldown, nerfed addons, and something else that fucks Spirit over. It's never going to be just one thing, it's going to be multiple things which brings her down to Ghostface levels. And when it happens, those same survivor mains are never going to say "woah devs, you went too far. We only wanted one thing nerfed". No, they won't say a damn thing about it and will laugh behind their computers at a job well done. So I'm not going to fall for the "we just want one thing nerfed" posts.
---
&gt; Even if she would be Ghostface level, where is the Problem? I think thats a balanced place for killers to be.
---
The problem is that his power can be taken away just by survivors looking in his direction, which is the stupidest counter in the history of video games. It's a bad joke that the devs thought would be cute and fun. They buffed him to high tier, then nerfed him right back to mid-tier to ensure that he won't win against the best SWFs, just the way survivor mains wanted it. I want all killers to be viable against SWFs and that's my problem with anyone who wants to nerf Spirit down to the Ghostface levels.
---
&gt; With these changes spirit would still be pretty strong. I think thats a balanced place for killers to be.
---
Yep that sums it up doesn't it. Good fucking grief. Mid-tier is only "strong" against potatoes. I live in the red ranks where strong killers are required. If Ghostface is so fucking amazing, then you'd see him in more games. If he's so much "fun to play as" then you'd see him constantly wouldn't you. He's "fun to play as" when you're rank 10. Red rank killer players don't have time for bullshit killers.
---
&gt; You just need to put more thinking into it to get the kill.
---
Nothing about playing killer is easy. How about survivor mains focus on suggesting things to the devs that would increase the skill cap of playing survivor instead of focusing on ways to nerf killers. I know they won't because they don't want playing as survivor to have a high skill cap. They just want to run circles around weak killers to make themselves feel that they are better players than they really are.
---
&gt; As i said, there isnt much you can do to outplay the Spirit
---
Besides using situational awareness, Urban Evasion, Iron Will, Spine Chill, Premonition, etc. What is going on here is that you survivors don't want to take off your crutch perks (DS, Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Borrowed Time, etc.). So instead of using Urban, Iron Will, Spine Chill more, you'd rather the devs nerf the Spirit just so you can continue your crutch perks in 100% of your games.
---
You have perks to counter even Prayer Beads but don't want to use them because you want your cake and want to eat it too. Well I'm here to say fuck that, the Spirit shouldn't be nerfed because you all are too lazy to change up your meta. This is all your doing, and you can fix it but refuse to do it. No dev worth it's salt would listen to such nonsense, but this is BHVR and their devs probably get destroyed by rank 13 Trappers constantly.
---
&gt; but most importantly to change her add ons.
---
Yeahhhh.. most importantly change her "addons". We've heard that one before with the Nurse and we saw what happened. Not falling for it again.
---
&gt; Some Purple add ons are just straight up from another world and totally not needed
---
A Stealth killer should have an addon(s) that help her stealth play. All stealth killers should should have addons that help their stealth.
---
Still waiting for top hat Demi Logorgon
---
Any chance you bought them in the Shrine?
---
I hooked all 4 twice before going for the third and still got called tunnel
---
I do agree that he has potential for example hiding your Red Stain during a Chase on Yamaoka‚Äôs Estate for Example or other Maps with line of sight breaking loops can be incredibly powerful. I just think it‚Äôs often Map dependent on how well you‚Äôll be able to do with him.  I think the fact that you can simply shutdown his power by simply looking at him with a 3rd Person Camera is very poorly balanced. The Reason why a lot of Survivor Players complain about strong Killers is because they simply can‚Äôt 1v1 them and win. Meanwhile all the Weaker Killers completely lack the threat that the Stronger Killers have. I do think Doctor is pretty weak and may have said my original Comment without fully thinking it through. Whilst I think he is not as bad as I initially stated, I still think Ghostface isn‚Äôt really amazing, either.  I think bEHAVIOR should buff most Killers in the PTB and see how it works out. 
---
This Comment kind of went away off the Topic of Ghostface but I mentioned the Balancing Problem because I think Ghostface is still in that Group of underwhelming Killers. I do however really appreciate your comment because i find it really interesting to hear other views on the Game and maybe something is mentioned which I have forgotten which could change my View.
---
Yeah, the survivors believe that killers need to make the game easy for them and then if the killer even *tries* to get a kill then the killer is toxic and trash. About a month ago I was playing bubba trying to get the teachable of BBQ and this SWF was bullying me around a loop while their friends did a gen in front of me. Whenever I went to get the ones on the gen, they ran away and activated their blendette camouflage. Then I facecamped one of the ones that was bullying me, and when one went for a save, I downed him and hooked him and got a 2k. Then they messaged me like, ‚Äúwhy did you camp?‚Äù And I said, ‚Äúwhy were you bullying me around a loop?‚Äù And they said that I was trash for camping.
---
Exactly lmfao
---
They don't have the balls to do so in post game chat where you can respond
---
Protection hits are buggy and super unreliable, so the best answer anyone can give you is....maybe.
---
Yea he‚Äôs right there
---
Trappers is just boring, really wish they could update it
---
If it‚Äôs not the strongest play, then why complain about it, and if it‚Äôs like I forget about gens, then COMPLETE THE GENS. OPEN THE EXIT GATE. ESCAPE. easy.
---
imagine carring this much about another players. Once i clearly let the russian guy get the hatch cus he was playing very good, what did i get? "lol so ez noob"
---
Paternal instincts are kicking in
---
You can give it a fancy name if you want. It's still tunneling.
---
Is tunnelling sometimes the right call? Yes.
---
Is tunnelling as described above the right call? Considering he got 2 hooks for 5 gens, then no.
---
Probably the same guy who had a custom blue eyes white dragon private jet plane made

FTFY
---
How is wraiths's better than trapper when they are almost identical
---
but then you realise that iron maiden is shit and the 15 exposed timer isnt helpful
---
Pig. Because I can crouch and survivors can boop my snoot.
---
If you Boop you live, easy as that.
---
I can also spam roar to bm a guy I just downed.
---
The potential to be both wholesome and toxic is unmatched.
---
I actually started laughing more with the dedicated servers
---
Right, I feel like it has changed lately, and the game on ps4 is so buggy right now that even when I finally get a survivor one it disappears after one game.
---
How does complaining about something make it a strong play? Legion was not fun to go against and people complained about him, was he strong? No but he still got reworked because of his awful play style.
---
The point is, is that tunnelling is not fun for the person being tunnelled and killers that do this are often the ones that cry about being gen rushed.
---
Spreading out hits on Wraith means the survivors have to heal or be in a dangerous spot. That being said, playing Wraith requires some amount of dirty tactics if you want to win at red ranks... I've tried playing a fair game on Wraith (it's just my natural inclination to leave hook and go after new people. Which ends up biting me in the ass when all 4 survivors usually live for most of the gens.) I either have to focus one person out of the game or run NoED (which has become a lot worse since Inner Strength is a thing)
---
Oinkfection
---
Wraith's and Trapper's Mori animations are garbage...Pig is at least executed well.  Leatherface should def be higher, it's pretty brutal.
---
as a head on user i dont like this
---
Do you play on console? Because before Bill was added to console, they were just normal perks, and were retroactively made Bill perks.
---
if you're on console,you may have unlocked the perks before bill was added.
---
on console, we didn't have bill for a long time, so his perks were generic and available to everyone.
---
when he was added, they became teachables and had to be unlocked after leveling bill, but we all got to keep them on characters where we already got them.
---
You got a sub
---
But you can buy other survivors and killers with shards, you can‚Äôt with bp.
---
The clown
---
Are you on PS4? William only got introduced maybe two-ish months ago, before that you could get all his perks in the bloodweb on PS4.
---
I had borrowed time on feng before they introduced him, now you have to unlock his bloodweb to get them.
---
I feel demo should be S too because its quite viceral and in 3rd person.
---
Hag and huntress should also climb one to A, Spirit IMO is not as satisfying, I like the initial backstab but the whole slashing on the floor seems uninspired compared to what they could have done.
---
Not sure why Freddy got an F, I think its a B, I like how he just pops his glove out of the survivor chest.
---
Yup. Left side, 2/3 to top next to a tree üòò
---
I only hit survivors on hook once if they've been toxic during the chase. Like - "yea, buddy, you looped me well but you didn't have to teabag me after every pallet and click the flashlight everytime you had the chance so here, have some love too" and then I nod at them and smack them once. (:
---
&gt;Implying I'd do something other than waste all my money on micropayments instead of buying food
---
Yep. I get called camper because as I‚Äôm leaving the hook I literally see scratch marks of someone running up for a save. Why the hell would I leave when I now have two of you here?
---
same reason survivors disconnect when things aren't going their way I suppose. I can assure you that giving sarcastic remarks like "who hurt you?" isn't helping. no one wants to play with someone who's gonna act like that anyway.
---
Right?
---
I never said that camping/tunneling was a strong play, I don‚Äôt camp, but I do hate when I get gen rushed, by SWF every 10 or so games. I have respect for survivor, playing survivor is hard, but just because it‚Äôs hard doesn‚Äôt mean that you deserve for the killer to play by your rules.
---
God that makes absolutly no sense, but salty survivors have to go off on something.
---
.... Monto ?
---
I‚Äôd love it.

The dumpling that bites back

Should I buy micheal Myers or ghostface? I can not decide

It‚Äôs for the leg drag isn‚Äôt it

if this guy can get to rank 1 every rank reset without using Ruin, perhaps Pig is not bad at all and you guys are just not good enough with her
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz](https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz)
---
This is the best dbd meme ive seen in a minute
---
I remember once i got told i was tunneling all 4 survivors in the game... what
---
Omg I‚Äôm blurry is a pretty small youtuber/twitch streamer but she‚Äôs making her way through how to videos for each of the killers
---
Exhaustion from any Perk that causes that will stop you from using any other exhaustio Perk.  Its called balancing, because if all 4 Survivors could Sprint Burst away to a Balanced Landing spot and then loop even,longer into Dead Harding or Lithe....I would not play this game.
---
In the picture. do you not see her?
---
Actually is gg ez baby noob killer go back to fortnite with five year old toxic fuckers you fucking dumb piece of shit, asshole cunt
---
if the obsession is far away and you can't hear the terror radius, BT will not procc.
---
I‚Äôve lost ALOT of killers because they hit me on a medium vault and I zoom zoom zoom away with lithe + the speed boost after a hit. 
---
Never happens on purpose but I‚Äôm always laughing when it happens.
---
Blendette !?))) Genius !!!
---
Negative. But you should only be using your power to get that hit then continue chase for the final hit before they can mend
---
I mean, yeah, kinda but if you escape the trial, you get 6k so that's also pretty cool.
---
Play the game however you want. Ignore cry babies on reddit. Ignore salty killers and salty survivors. The game gets a lot better once you stop giving a fuck.
---
I‚Äôve played the new Nurse, and she is definitely isn‚Äôt better then billy anymore. Good players will still do well, but she isn‚Äôt the number one anymore.
---
I still kinda kept up with XYZ, but wasn't playing anymore. Links I straight up had no interest in, and I have no idea how it is atm.
---
Sometimes survivors will take a hit for the injured survivor and do not get chased. 
---
Ive been playing rank 13 to rank 8 and facecamping is also an issue. My mistake was thinking killers would actually do some work at these ranks. Im on console. But i still havent used Decisive Strike, i might have to start though.
---
There isn't even a way to tell someone is about to jump at you with Head On
---
Yup. Some days I‚Äôm shocked people know how to use light switches.. I don‚Äôt wager they really know how they work.. besides ‚Äúon and off‚Äù lol
---
Also some killer add-ons apply exhaustion as well so even if you only run the one perk you can still be unable to use it sometimes.
---
Chicken noodle soup
---
Her soup
---
Righto, Tommy Tutone.
---
But also yes
---
If there is an opt out they‚Äôd be better off removing SWF from the game.
---
I don‚Äôt play SWF but I think it should stay.  I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to bonus XP for facing an SWF though.
---
Fuck survivors man, I play like I want to
---
Thats why im a killer main that plays a lot of survivor! The stress of having to hunt 4 people and deal with mockery from teabag, dc, clicking, instaheals, etc and then post chat fuckery to really make you sick.   
---
Playing survivor? Just dont be spirit and its fine. facecamp, tunnelers are rare. At its worst you can just meme and run around. Heck as a survivor im more scared of entitled survivors. Slight Inconvenience = DC
---
Okay you can tunnel survivors then, just don‚Äôt be surprised when you get gen rushed.
---
That's probably worse than using traps to camp.
---
**Fun:** Myers, Doctor, Legion, Plague and Clown.
---
**Not Fun:** Nurse, Huntress, Hag.
---
*Those listed as unfun is most cause I am bad with them and I have no fun cause I can't do much.*
---
Then nobody would play against SWF groups due to it being such a difficulty spike making the game take even longer to find matches when it already takes a while.
---
My solution?
---
If your rank 20-15 as killerthan you can opt out of SWF matches and if your rank 14-1 then you are basically open to anyone joining. This would give new killers a chance at winning if they have no clue what‚Äôs going on.
---
What do you think?
---
Put .ttv in your name
---
I have had games where I end up chasing a survivor for 4 gens because I go "Oh, they just camp the pallet and drop it when I get close. I will get rid of all the pallets then get free chases!" Nope. There are enough pallets that if you just drop it as soon as the killer gets near, you can "loop" the killer for 5 gens.
---
The most egregious examples of mine were on the Badham maps. I thought they reworked it to not be survivor sided?
---
Based on my experience:
---
Green Ranks - Toxic Survivors
---
Purple Ranks - Toxic Survivors &amp; Killers
---
Red Ranks - Toxic Killers
---
Hag would be S tier and plague A tier on my list.
---
Crouching up to the killer with both gates open is more than cocky, it‚Äôs going out of your way to taunt the killer.  That‚Äôs the definition of toxic behavior.
---
I put it in my bio (i don't understand how to stream on twitch, so I put youtube) but I don't really want to have that in a name for a psn account.
---
Makes sense
---
I dont think it would be good for the game. On console I know it's a huge part of the player base. If there was an option to opt out of swf, the vast majority of killers would take it and it would kill the game for a lot of people.if they did play swf the queue times would be ridiculous and cause a ton of people to not play the game. The only viable thing in my personal opinion would be a bonus amount of bloodpoints for the killer if they did a game against swf.
---
A good straight/funny man comedies work better as duos
---
making a killer to rank 1 doesnt mean the killer is good, rank 1 survivors most of the time suck and dc or die in first hook, or the matchmaking fail and you get rank 16s.
---
yea I know this streamer but while i've seen him getting limited for playing the pig more than once and yea, pig is not low tier at the bottom, maybe low mid tier but she still up to some buffs.
---
you actually think that someone deserves to get banned for this? my question is why devs ban people for this stuff. WHEN THEY CAN JUST MAKE DISABLE THE ABILITY TO CANCEL A MORI.
---
Unhooked survivor: \*dances in a circle\*
---
Killer: Doesn't swing
---
Unhooked Survivor: \*Surprised Pikachu Face\*
---
You don't have to allow them to escape. But keep in mind that other people are playing the round with you. Live people, who may not have a choice when they get unhooked. Since it's just a game, the nice thing to do is go for the rescuer.
---
I think it's not fun to play against and I run We're Gonna Live Forever and Plunderers almost every game.
---
I rather have that curse than the curse of consistently getting daily's for Wraith, Doc and Hag (especially when I sit at Rank 1 killer 80% of the season).
---
She is better than she‚Äôs feels early on, OP.
---
I love the baby Dweet but he must learn, not be coddled.
---
I don't think she needs any buff, she is strong in solo queue
---
Bt?
---
Instead of gens:  campfires, just be a few textured frames would do it. No searching for parts just m1 it and enjoy the asthetics.
---
Exactly. Go in a locker or something.
---
Borrowed time
---
well, this could be a buckle sating that she needs and then that she doesnt so i'll leave it there.
---
Just announced
---
Why in the fuck am i getting downvoted
---
Rapes them
---
Swf?
---
Exactly, and they can‚Äôt complain about tunneling because I didn‚Äôt down the survivor on the hook
---
So I have been leveling the person with dead hard this who toime, with BL available now should I forget about it or?
---
Wait. How did the Wraith mori beat the Trapper mori if they are practically the same? Also, me personally I would switch the killers from S tier to A tier and vice versa.
---
Pff teabagging!
---
It would be a solid perk, especially strong at low ranks...but totem.
---
Love when survs that clearly never played killer before complain about endgame camping like, are you serious rn?
---
Survive with friends
---
Disagree. There is plenty wrong with it.
---
I see your logic, but when I play killer and I get 2 dc's, it just isn't fun to farm.   
---
Sure, if the survivors are funny it can be nice, but 90% of the time I just want them to hurry because the game is boring.   
---
Blood points are fine and all, and I am happy to farm a bit, but I just wanna go back to stabbing people
---
Is there any benefit to prestiging?
---
That is the least threatening picture of Myers mask I‚Äòve ever seen
---
Inside us
---
oh true! I forgot about poor Jeff. I hardly see him since I stay at red ranks.
---
I slug them off hook,  and move to other people
---
Then that means at least 1 other is running to heal their guy on the ground and I‚Äôm chasing 1
---
So possibly 1 more guy on a gen? Not much of a gen rush, more of a time waster lol
---
Then by the time they are up I get another person and the cycle continues until everyone‚Äôs dead (well, not the slugging, unless you just got off the hook) 
---
Honestly, sometimes it not about getting a hook, it‚Äôs about wasting their time
---
Both the Doctor and Feng Min's outfits are available for either 1,080 Auric Cells or 21,600 Iridescent Shards.
---
They open the locker and the body falls out onto them
---
Insta heals are nerfed on the PTB and I hope they make it so you can't DS if you get pulled out of a locker.
---
I forgot about the shrine, good guess. It was what everyone else responded though. I got them before Bill was introduced
---
I think he is trying to be Freddy
---
I'm trying to find it, but it's a comment from a developer on the forums and not the easiest to find xd
---
fixated will let you see the scratches after dance with me, and let you walk faster to avoid the killer after you break los
---
But also you don t have to run Monitor abuse on scratched mirror, and that means one free perk slot, also spine chill is not meta, so rarely will more then 1 People have it in red ranks.
---
I understand that. I'm saying that's poor design
---
I know haha. Just find it interesting why people hate certain characters XD
---
Dude could you make a tutorial video on how to make this?
---
because he's obviously a newborn miguel
---
Its called a surprise feature
---
I meant that as a new Killer perk, not an OoO need.
---
OoO should be an Obsession perk that Survivors want to take, with it being punished depending on what the Killer took
---
I can't agree with you pal. To me they just were goofing around without a real desire to provoke a killer
---
Thing is that he's not asking asking about other perks, purely MYC.
---
You dont need MYC on the ones I listed, but if youre gonna put it on like he's asking, its better at tier 1 for them since they can reach the savior faster than Wraith and dont need the extra time offered by later tiers. Leaving it as 1 on Wraith isnt very helpful since youre likely not going to down them within that 40 seconds like you said since he isnt good at loops against a competent survivor.
---
It would make the queue times even worse for both sides of the game.
---
Have you gotten those micro freezes whenever you tier up as Myers?
---
Is it sad I main Ghost Face just for his Mori?
---
Nice and creepy
---
Yeah it feels bad
---
Nerf haddonfield pls
---
That makes sense...I even got congratulated for sticking it out through three Uber toxic players as a baby nurse...the fourth guy apologized for the others...that was ultra nice...made my day...
---
How strong of a killer player are you?
---
Myers is pretty easy to get to grips with - get into T3, down people. His perks are pretty good, both for himself and others.
---
Ghost Face is a bit more refined - survivors can knock you out of stalk, so you need to be pretty good at knowing the tiles and how survivors path. His perks aren't great, period.
---
Does that help? Are there other factors?
---
what? literally looks like a normal hit
---
Pig isn't F its just short and sweet
---
Not to worry*
---
They ask how many wins not how.
---
Ouch if true.
---
How do you know, if you don't mind sharing?
---
I think it should be removed just from the fact some maps are stronger for killers and some are stronger for survivor and it annoys me when I see so much haddonfield
---
I've been running open handed with bond, windows of opportunity, and detective's hunch with pretty good affect.  And detective's hunch is getting a buff to go off for every generator.  And I've had games where another survivor brings the perk and things get pretty crazy.
---
I didn‚Äôt lunge, so I thought it would miss. I stood still and swung.
---
HOW COME WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR, I CONSTANTLY GET PEOPLE WHO ARE SWF WITH THEIR GEN TAPPING LOW RANK FRIENDS AND AREN'T ABLE TO LOOP A KILLER LONGER THAN 5 SECONDS
---
YET WHEN I PLAY KILLER, IT'S ALWAYS THE MOST EFFICIENT 3K HOUR SWF POSSIBLE
---
After I‚Äôve switched to killer the ignorance really shows. I‚Äôve cringed at so many friends claim they‚Äôre being tunneled at the killer choosing to go after them. I had one scenario when the friend unhooked me and was closer to the killer and the first thing to come out of his mouth when the chase music started was ‚Äúthis tunneling dick!‚Äù
---
Wow people do not understand anything at all.....
---
New patch: Haddon Field is just "Field" now, no loops, no elevation, no vaults, and 7 gens clumped in the center
---
You get part of a bloodied cosmetic set each time you do it.
---
You have a barely noticeable chance of higher tier add-ons in your Bloodweb, but bear in mind that not every killer has their better add-ons at the higher levels.
---
If that's benefit enough for you, then go right ahead.
---
there are lots of reasons for that to happen. like I would go for the unhooked person after hitting the person who unhooked, when I know that he is on his death hook and I really need to eliminate someone. also when you hit the person who body block, they get a speed boost while the unhooked person doesn't, so it's much easier to catch them. also there are times when you can notice that one person is going towards a stronger loop while other one is going nowhere or to a much weaker loop, in that case I'd also go for the unhooked person. these are things which people don't notice when they don't play killer much I think and only play survivor and then they might tend to think that killer is just tunnel visioned even though he is just playing to his win condition. ofcourse i do agree that there are times when the killer is just fully tunnel visioned on you, and that sucks a lot. but unless the killer is just a sack of shit (most probably also running noed), people should not confuse tunneling with tunnel vision and make it sound like a bad thing. 
---
about face camping. it's the worst thing a killer can do for sure. although I do think camping can he a valid strategy at some situations (like you might want to force struggle on someone, whispers might be going off but you don't know where the person is etc), but hard face camping is the worst thing for sure (unless exits are open). to punish face camping and tunnel vision, people just need to do gens and stop being altruistic. this way the killer will have no chance of pipping and maybe he will learn that it's not a good strategy one day
---
Sounds good yeah
---
I always see these posts as a survivor main and can‚Äôt relate bc I actually respect killers. Don‚Äôt see why ppl are toxic
---
Be able to see the status effects underneath the survivor names. Like exhaustion, haste, exposed(not in the killer based power) or blindness should show at the bottom of their names.
---
Not a complaint my dude, I would do the same if I was that hag ~ peace
---
There is a bug that happens with low probability which causes survivors to have what you see in the video. It happened 3 or 4 times to me as killer and I thought it was cheaters bullshitting me until I had it happen to me as a survivor.
---
Basically can happen after doing almost anything while in a speed boost, and the only fix is for the surv to have another speed boost or hit them.
---
You get 1 bloody cosmetic and an evidently negligible boost to rarity of items. I generally just dont prestige anymore, especially if im using paid cosmetic anyways
---
What you wanna do is spin your character the opposite direction you're pushing the camera.
---
So if you're rotating the left control stick clockwise, push the camera to the left and vice versa
---
Changed in purpose, but good for you to notice. No one did in all this time.
---
They are both good exhaustion perks. I‚Äôd suggest you continue levelling David so you can have both options.
---
I mean your swing isn't flat out in your face and she was turning around looked literally like she turn into u
---
No I was more being sarcastic I don‚Äôt think you should be able to be banned for this which is why it‚Äôs ridiculous that Hexy did when tons of people do this. And I agree they should remove the ability to if they don‚Äôt want people to do it.
---
Cuz it‚Äôs annoying seeing a little Asian woman crouch up and down multiple times wearing a face mask
---
I don't think it would be unbalanced (I want it.) but exactly how to handle it is where it gets complicated.
---
Should it be global or part of Small Game? If it's global we should get more hex's like NOED where a dull totem becomes lit under certain circumstances to reinforce totems as a side objective.
---
Then there's the aspect of how to make a counter work. Should it be part of the HUD like generators remaining? Something subtle like the "Clunk" noise when a totem is destroyed being global so players have to mentally keep track or a thunder noise when all 5 totems are gone? A shrine in the basement where a candle goes out for each totem cleansed? 
---
Personally I want a "subtle" global counter (In-universe like a basement shrine, or a sound effect when all 5 are gone) + a number of dulls remaining on Small Game.
---
Being called a tunneler is my favourite "insult", that I always happily accept. Means I'm doing exactly the correct thing, going after the weakest survivor and increasing my chances to win instead of adhering to the Survivor Rulebook For Killers ;)
---
which isn't very different from what we have now. except now it counters instadowns after the use.
---
Thank you for the advice good sir!
---
It takes 32 seconds, it only takes 40 seconds with sloppy butcher, sorry I get a stroke whenever someone spreads misinformation
---
Lmao i was playing huntress once and i put a survivor in basement first hook to stairs then turned around to get more hatchets opened the first locker next to stairs and lo and behold a claudette just chillin in there
---
Well, it is if it kills the game for everyone that is a problem no? One survivor dc doesn‚Äôt end the game...makes it hella harder but it doesn‚Äôt end the game...killer dcs and no points, time wasted, items lost, that is a huge disparity compared to one survivor who dcs and only effects his blood points and items, although it does make game harder for team...
---
I use sloppy butcher.
---
If you don‚Äôt mind ruining someone‚Äôs gaming experience, sure go for it
---
yes you are correct. but you should also choose your chases wisely. if an uninjured surv is going to shack and I don't have it prepped as a trapper and I can't guarantee an easy m1 on him, then I will not waste my time with him. I will either go to area where I have prepped and find people there, or go after the unhooked surv if he is going at a weaker loop. that's just one example but I hope my point is clear.
---
Before BHVR switched it so that SWF goes to the highest rank, I was playing with a friend of mine who is a casual newbie and I saw maybe two or three Jeff's and this was at yellow ranks. Like honestly, I don't see Jeff at red ranks and I don't mean it as an insult. But man, Jeff is so underused to the point that when he got new cosmetics I didn't even see anyone use him. For example, the new one with biker Jeff and Kate, I only saw Kate's and not Jeff.
---
Yes, but chances are your not gonna use it on insta downs as they are most likley gonna use em when your not injured, and you can only use it when injured.
---
The hurt box for swings is a pretty wide cone. This seems normal tbh
---
which again, isn't very different from what we have now.
---
I got shit talked for using NOED when i killed all 4 survivors with 3 gens left.
---
Broke: the killer dcing when their ruin is broken the beginning of the match.
---
Woke: survivors dcing when they dont break ruin the beginning of match.
---
(I know it was probably a connection issue but shh)
---
I'm new to the game and please dont grill me for saying this, but doesn't tunneling make sense? I think it only makes sense because the killers trying to win by killing 4 survivors, why shouldn't they focus on the ones closer to death?
---
Pgtw and Overcharge
---
I've had people who play fucking R6 Siege and For Honor tell me they go to those games to get away from DBD toxicity, how much worse can we get
---
Monitor and infectious fright
---
From my
---
Bottom ranks - clueless killers and teammates, sometimes they are toxic
---
Yellow ranks - either a baby killer or a camper, teammates that will purposely let you die
---
Green ranks - extremely toxic survivors, killers are okay I guess
---
Purple ranks - extremely toxic survivors electric boogalo, killers are either super cunts or super chill, no inbtw
---
Red ranks - didn't get there yet as either, but I'm on my way
---
And the "dumba**es" thing is super fucking annoying.
---
You don't spot Michael, Michael spot you
---
Inner Strength and Small Game (totems)
---
Spine Chill and Iron Will (spirits)
---
Yeah like cmon it‚Äôs clearly Gennies.
---
But what does 3 of hearts do?
---
I actually think I wouldn't be able to play freddy with that combination of the needles being merged with his hands and it just being needles is incredibly off putting
---
yeah, thats why slugging is good strategy but kinda bad for surv. u doing slugging without intend to do so because DS. but you not getting hook ( means surv will get up again without decreasing death chance ( 2 phase ). well its different if you slug camping
---
This is why I like ghostface, his stalk isnt decreases with range
---
yes it is my own picture. I mean like whats the right way to eat a fruit?
---
The peel of a banana is edible too. They even say that there is were the most vitamines are. Only because most people peel it makes that the right way? Or are most people eating it wrong because they dont eat all the goods off it?
---
Insta-blind flashlights were removed from the game almost two years ago.
---
If you're getting insta-blinded these days it's either some kind of network latency or other bug.
---
&gt; spin the camera, go around the killer.
---
You want the camera to go the opposite direction you turn your character 
---
rotate left control stick clockwise = push camera left
---
rotate left control stick counterclockwise = push camera right
---
Questions for the ages, my friend.
---
Do you even play both sides equally, mister, or do you want to preserve Spirit the way she is currently to abuse the shit out of her? You sound awfully biased. Also, new Nurse is just as good but not as overpowered as she used to be (and thank god for that).
---
[NA has their own sale](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/10/15/halloween-sale-ps-store-slashes-prices/), Dead by Daylight isn't currently listed.
---
I still feel there's every chance that it'll be added this time next week, if not sooner, as part of a marketing drive for the Archives and Rift.
---
Just like survivors are not entitled to any escape, killers are not entitled to any kills. The feeling sucks, but that‚Äôs how we all learn.

"YoU GuYs Can GiVe ME BuiLdS fOr $10. OMG ThIs BuiLd SuCkS, No RuIn?"

He‚Äôs just burned scarecrow at this point
---
yes piggy is pretty obvious, you down them, put a trap early, and then in mid game, Gf you actually ahve to play like a real killer , its like those single player games which you cant be detected, for the reward of getting a real fast down, piggy doesnt ahve that at all, she goes slower and then a free hit, and then the looping start, a creative Gf is literally scary af.
---
Resilience and spine chill for extra vault speed when injured during a chase
---
Those are literally the easiest killers to get dailies for? You can play them successfully at rank 1 too, hag is high tier btw
---
That's good to know. :)
---
You were literally right behind her

I dont wanna be the guy but

Idk maybe you're not as good as you think you are

Ohtofu helped me for survivor gameplay too if you arr interested

FUCKIN‚Äô A!

Nothing you‚Äôve said so far has had any relevance to our conversation. Why would I waste time looking through your post history when I‚Äôm commenting on what you‚Äôve said to this post? You said that you would have mocked  this killer for struggling to down you, and I‚Äôm trying to tell you that behavior like that is what gives this community a bad reputation. That‚Äôs a real person you‚Äôre playing with, and they should be treated like one. You wouldn‚Äôt act that way to someone‚Äôs face would you, so why act that way in game? Then again, maybe you would do that to their face too, how would I know? I‚Äôm just assuming that you‚Äôre generally a decent person IRL, but I may be wrong. From the responses I‚Äôve seen from you so far, I‚Äôm getting the impression that I‚Äôm speaking to someone much younger, who lacks the mental maturity to have an adult conversation.

Legion! EDGY TEENS
---
I don‚Äôt mind going against her and unfun to go against is pretty subjective. Hillbilly is the one I personally despise playing against.
---
Nice im still waiting too bud
---
Yeah it's weird. I know it seems harmless, but after 1 match nobody should be asking that. I don't mind becoming friends with people I meet in matches, but we have to play a while first. . . . . .
---
Oh, the "rate" usually refers to the maximum transfer bandwidth per second, in this case 10000 byte, or 10 kilobyte. This is about data packet exchange limits, not the server simulation rate/tickrate.
---
No he had Lightweight, but he never did this exact combination (yet). No0b3 did on his last video (instant ninja)
---
Millisecond timing and perfect aim gets you that hit, when you swing, the max distance it can hit lasts untill the complete end of the swing just before the after swing thing, is built in to the code but is also kinda bs due to the swing being basicly over, got 2 hits like that last match I played, let them both go bc they are bs, if they changed the hit radius curve out and back in instead of just out then those hits wouldn‚Äôt exist
---
.ttv the cost is getting moried if you play survivor
---
The original vision of Freddy Kreuger actually had him as a child molester.
---
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Krueger#Characterization):
---
\&gt; Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the "worst thing" he could think of. The decision was made to instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time *A Nightmare on Elm Street* went into production.
---
Not disagreeing but that's less hitboxes and more latency issues.
---
Much like every time something comes out, people assume things before trying them out.
---
No no no, its G√¶ns
---
Could've done without the head shake BM. It was well-played, no need to taunt them.
---
How much in dollars though?
---
Sure, and when the killer drops you on the ground by the hatch and slams it shut in your face, it‚Äôs not toxic.  The killer is just goofing around.
---
IF YOU USE AN ORMOND OFFERING AS SURVIVOR YOU ARE A DICKBAG OF GRANDPA DICKS
---
THE GAME HAS BEEN KICKING PEOPLE A LOT LATELY. THAT NEEDS TO GET UNDER CONTROL
---
I've been re-leveling people on PC after switching from console so I've been saving shards to buy teachables I already have for the bloodpoints, and I bought Balanced Landing today because my Nea is p3-45. It took my 2k shards &amp; initially showed me with the extra 150k bp &amp; then I went to my Steve's bloodweb and I was back at like 2400 bp, but still down 2k shards.
---
Welp.
---
and there is ton of cool stuff for leon too you can make him RE leon 6 if you want too
---
Lol, is tunneling really "ruining someone's gaming experience"? I'm new to the game but it doesn't sound that bad, really.
---
Yeah ok that kinda sucks hope to see it in shrine if you wanna learn them
---
Well, the game calls it android arm
---
I DON‚ÄôT WANNA PLAY SURVIVOR SO HALF THE ARCHIVE CHALLENGES WILL BE FOOKIN‚Äô USELESS FOR ME. I DON‚ÄôT EVEN HAVE ANY OF THEM LEVELED UP PAST 1 BECAUSE I DON‚ÄôT CARE.
---
I‚Äôve only done this once when I played against a lag switch. Went to go comment and they had 10 others who beat me to it.
---
DS. The perk that rewards you for failure. You got hooked? Oh here, take a free get out jail free card so you can do gens, save people, heal yourself, go loot basement, hunt for ruin or even run the killer around for a minute without any fear of being hooked.
---
IMO the easiest way to balance DS is to make it so if you touch a gen, are healed to full or rescue someone the 1 minute timer ends. Make it a "get away and heal yourself (or be healed) perk.
---
Thank you! 
---
I thought they‚Äôre bs too
---
the game has been having issues with this lately. happening to me. someone else made a post about it last night. Monto's girlfriend got kicked like 3 times last week. it's nuts
---
whoah so much list btw why BT too? do you tunnel hard all game?. btw 1 hit k.o means noed whole game with range attack you know.
---
Why would I want that? RE4 Leon, now that's something
---
Tunneling is toxic in the same way that gen rushing is toxic. Neither of them are actually toxic, it‚Äôs each team just playing the game and completing their goal.
---
The only reason I like any tier lists anymore is cause they are a constant reminder that Freddy is no longer the killer with his own tier at the bottom
---
I would change Freddy to A tier, hes an op killer now.
---
No, what‚Äôs dead hard is his sex life
---
Yeah I've got extra time built into driving Uber specifically for DbD stuff. Love this game something fierce.
---
Even worse than xyz monsters,  god damn pendulum summoning
---
so cute &lt;3
---
Noed and blood warden
---
Inner Strength and Quick and quiet.  
---
Head on and Quick and Quiet.  
---
Head on and Dance with me.  
---
Lithe and Dance with me.  
---
Lithe and quick and quiet.
---
How do you maim a killer?
---
Is that just using ds, head on and that pallet perk
---
/s
---
No problem :)
---
That's pretty broken. Needs fixing! :)
---
I've got my hopes. Since BHVR is working with the license holders for Fred &amp; Bubba to get them on the Switch I'm hoping they'll coordinate some cosmetic agreements in the agreement.
---
Sadly.... you can now. 
---
Not all of them,  but some you can
---
I wonder when dead by daylight 2 is coming out?
---
Why would that matter either way?
---
#bruh
---
For some weird reason the longest adepts for me were Meg and Tapp, each time it took 3 tries. Meg just wasn't counted as escape for some weird reason, and as Tapp I was too cocky.
---
Strangely enough, did adept David on my first try. We had a pretty nasty Billy, but my teammates were really helpful.
---
I will try, thank you!
---
That's a bit complicated,  can you please explain it more in depth please
---
Only true legends
---
Why does this thread have more answers than likes?
---
I can see why you'd think that... Sorry for the confusion
---
Defender sided? Are we talking about DbD or R6 here?
---
I mean you compared purple flashlights to iridescent head which makes no sense as flashlights take skill to use.  Secondly blinding at a pallet is almost always a bad idea because good killers will track you through noise and you‚Äôll just lose distance you could have ran.  But I‚Äôm guessing someone who complains about DS and bodyblocking isn‚Äôt a red rank killer at the moment.
---
Thanks bubby
---
Are you fast vaulting into it without quick and quiet?    
---
Are you doing it in line of sight to the killer?    
---
Are you close enough to the killer that they can hear the locker opening?    
---
Are you waiting inside the locker long enough for a crow to spawn above it?
---
I'm just asking cuz the experience is slightly different because controlling with a joystick instead of a mouse can lead to different outcomes
---
Nevermind you‚Äôre not worth the discussion lmao you just cry about survivors all
---
Just gonna copy my post from a similar thread on this topic: 
---
One thing I think about a lot about this game‚Äôs community is a lot of people cannot win with dignity nor can they lose with grace. No matter what side they‚Äôre on, people are just unsportsmanlike and also have no self awareness when it comes to their own behavior.
---
And it‚Äôs those people who fuel that cycle of BM and annoying attitudes I wish we could move away from.
---
Great, and? What if you down him in one hit with half of the killers having it base line and most of the others have perks/items for it?
---
&gt; maps
---
bhvr needs to do a significant amount of map balance, and I have no idea what the fuck they're doing. They looked at the maps that are broken or insufferable for killers and instead of fixing that, they said "yeah this but for survivors" and gave us the new Badham maps and the Hawkins Lab.
---
&gt; perk
---
NOED should be tied to how many totems are remaining on the field, and maybe a counter should be added to all five players' HUDs
---
&gt; addon
---
remove trapper bag and make it basekit for Dad
---
&gt; game mechanic
---
remove autoaim. it has fucked me so many times as killer. 
---
either make medium vaults more meaningful than they currently are or slightly increase missed hit cooldown
---
They won't be adding any of that for free.
---
I love when survivors leave my devour hope because it's not ruin. They dont know what it is until it's too late.
---
Spirit burst and Dead hard :)
---
No, I didn't put the link in the post. I'll do that now.
---
What cracks me up about DS is it's lose-lose from a design perspective. If you give survivors tools to prevent tunneling, it's just a fact of life that some survivors will abuse those tools to bully and BM.
---
So when a guy with BT buff, DS, and andrenaline bodyblocks and teabags me because he just heard on comms they 99d the last gen, I say to myself, "aNtI TuNNeL PeRk."
---
I play more survivor than anything else anymore, ass face. And I'm still not crying about camping and tunneling lmao
---
Ah yes the bright colours on the stealth killer
---
&gt;  but I think it is designed to punish tunneling killers
---
Yeah but let's be honest.  It's more used as a weapon to fuck over killers now. Survivors with borrowed time and decisive can waste such an insane amount of the killers time
---
Those were one button press addons (or two at the same time if you want to get technical. 
---
The original Ebony could also kill without hooks. Now you need to hook a person once, which can be a big deal for some players. 
---
Not the same, bud.
---
How does it make me a bad player if I say that playing low tier killers at red ranks is not fun? Like what?
---
Nurse is a lot rarer on console but that's about the only difference it would make to your tier list, and I still would put her up there in the top three.  
---
I don't imagine hag or freddy are any weaker or stronger with or without a mouse.  I only see that really being a thing for huntress and for the nurse.
---
I fast vault into the locker when I am more than 3 seconds away from the killer. Most of them don‚Äôt check the locker first. Then when they do which is a little after they check a corner they face the locker and I hit it. No crows, and most time they don‚Äôt see it but hear it and thats what I do. This worked every time until now and I don‚Äôt know why because I am doing the same process.
---
They are easy, but not fun my dude.
---
I agree with all of this, autoaim is so dumb as it has no clue how to deal with survivor 360s and you get forced to swing at nothing
---
Nah fam.  I‚Äôm not trying to provoke the survivor, I just think it‚Äôs funny to slam hatches in their face.  It‚Äôs just a goof!  I‚Äôm just trying to have fun with the survivor!  And with the new scoring events, you get points for wiggling!  So I‚Äôm giving you free points too.  No toxicity.  
---
You see how ridiculous that sounds?  You know how frustrated you feel when the killer won‚Äôt quit messing with you when they could obviously kill you whenever they wanted?  Yeah, that‚Äôs how killers feel when survivors won‚Äôt just leave the match.  I don‚Äôt want a free hit, I just want you to leave so I can move on to the next match.  If you want to celebrate, do it in postgame chat so that I can ignore it and move on.  Stop holding the game hostage to dance around with the other survivors and just.  Fucking.  Leave.
---
It's bad because the only thing you offered up to show how he's OP and needs a nerf is that your own set-up can't handle the dream world.
---
please explain how he actually needs a nerf. what aspect of Freddy is broken?
---
and btw an opinion isn't good just because you want it to be
---
Okay I'm replying to both  [Cxalk](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cxalk/) and  [Szzznn](https://www.reddit.com/user/Szzznn/). I'm not going to pretend to know how long you guys have played this game; but both of those perks (NOED and DS) were so much worse originally. 
---
NOED was not a hex perk. It was a constant and undying perk once activated.
---
DS originally was not just after being unhooked, it was available after your first down as the obsession and the skill check success zone was the size of Australia. 
---
They may be strong perks but they are by no means *broken*. Plus, both are counterable by cleaning totems or by being smart about location and timing when you know a DS hit is coming. Not criticizing you guys, just being real about my experience and educated opinion.
---
The Dying Light stacks are sick
---
And Thana'phobia sticks
---
Your never gonna Mend Wound now, kid
---
So when you're panting and hurt
---
All of your meta build perks
---
Won't help you pop gens a little bit
---
Sigh* it‚Äôs true tho lol
---
Dance with me and lithe are amazing!
---
Well if your scratch marks end at the locker and there was a noise notification there, it's pretty obvious that you're inside that locker.  
---
Plus if you use a head on stun on a killer, they're going to play around that for the rest of the match if they're not totally brain dead.  I react to it the same way as dead hard, where I know that survivor has the perk and probably wants to or will use it again on me.
---
Cries in impossible skillchecks
---
Isn‚Äôt that No0b3s vid?
---
It is still a better play on the survivor side to work Jenny's before hexes. Imo
---
NOED is just a perk in the game, prevents toxic people from teabagging you at the end
---
Incorrect.
---
Devs have stated that the Putrid Serum, which is used to purchase any of the Hallowed/Withering Blight cosmetics (Dwight, Claudette, Jake, Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Doctor, Huntress, Clown, Spirit, Hag and Plague), can ONLY be earned through the free path on the Rift.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93854/news-withering-blight-event-overview
---
Animations? Fuck that lol. 
---
If anything they should update something to effect actual gameplay like making not used perks useable and do something lol. 
---
Hard disagree.
---
Incorrect? No? I said it gives the currency to get the cosmetics I just didn‚Äôt go in-depth about it
---
Good to know that it‚Äôs not just me, thanks!
---
Yeah.. both tick and update rates were once logged, doesn't appear to be case. Last time I looked during first PTB when they enabled dedicated servers, it was 10.
---
Haha i felt kinda bad for him... I rarely succeed that many 360 xD and was willing to take a hit for that. Had no idea NOED woud be cleansed
---
I honestly have trouble believing that.
---
Survivors have complained to me in pretty much every possible scenario. It happens in 1/10 games bare minimum.
---
&gt;the game is $50 Dollars
---
It's more like 8 bucks \*now\* and it has been like 8 bucks for a long time.
---
BUT YOU DIDNT FOLLOW MY SURVIVOR RULES!!!!
---
/S BUT I HATE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SUCH BABIES THAT THEY QUIT BECAUSE SHIT DOESN'T GO THEIR WAY. THIS GOES BOTH SIDES, I HAD 4 KILLERS DC IN A ROW LAST NIGHT BECAUSE GENS POPPED FAST OR THEIR RUIN GOT DESTROYED OR SOMETHING. SO MANY OF MY SURVIVORS RAGEQUIT BECAUSE OF PERKS OR ADDONS TOO, ITS RIDICULOUS. IF YOU GET IRI HEAD'D JUST EAT THE LOSS AND PLAY A NEW GAME, WHATS THE POINT OF FORFEITING BLOODPOINTS AND RUINING GAMES FOR YOUR TEAMMATES FFS.
---
Someone like me, who just recently purchased the game and rank 20/19 killer gets to play against 4 survivors rank 10 or lower.... this matchmaking is the worst in this game. No wonder so many newbies don‚Äòt continue to play.
---
Legion is the only S tier, don't @ me
---
You guys whined about DS enough that they ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù it but made it even more annoying to play against. Good job. All the killers who simply couldn‚Äôt stand to be stunned for 4 seconds did this.
---
Bond and Prove Thyself  
---
Fixated and sprint burst  
---
prove thyself and better together
---
Same with Plague. I‚Äôm just idle looking at something and suddenly ‚ÄúEIR FA NOM DINGIR! HOKUVA!‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ma‚Äôam. Please. This is a Walgreens.
---
Unless you're huntress and opening lockers fast is big brain
---
lol im not even talking about the lunge attack and also ur aware that she isn't in the C tier right? ON MY PERSONAL OPINION LIST I put her on high B tier as my personal preference, this list is subjective
---
Honestly, they shouldn't even be right to when they complain that NOED does activate since it is a perk that the devs allowed and created.
---
Thank you
---
I use Corrupt Intervention on him, makes them come toward you while you're stealthing on the early game.
---
&gt;"Survivors with borrowed time and decisive can waste such an insane amount of the killers time"  
---
Sure, if the killer tunnels. If the killer doesn't tunnel, or proxy hooks, those two perks become essentially useless.
---
BRO I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO HOOK THEM LET ALONE CAMP/TUNNEL/ETC
---
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO VIOLATE THE CODE OF KILLER ETHICS
---
‚ÄúI have a mouth and I must scream.‚Äù
---
WHERE DID HE COME FROM WHERE DID HE GO
---
WHAT IS THE CHANGE?
---
Lightweight aswell. Run fast and never be found.
---
Could be a dedicated servers issue, along many others
---
Legion isnt that bad, hes not great but hes not in his own tier of bad. Hes like a less effective plague.
---
no legion is legion tier
---
If you honestly think iridescent heads are comparable to anything survivors have at the moment you need to play the other side more.
---
This. Up
---
Yeah but the event is the blood hunt and the decorated hooks etc. All the rift has to do with the event is the free track gives the serums to unlocks 2 cosmetics sets rather than having to collect if from plants like last year
---
*surprised Hillbilly meme*
---
But you don't lose anything. Nor items or bp dude..
---
FUCK EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN PLAYING ON XBOX LATELY. LITERALLY, AFTER EVERY MATCH, I HAVE GOTTEN A MESSAGE TELLING ME HOW GARBAGE I AM, AND CALLING ME A SHIT TUNNELER AND CAMPER. ALL FOUR OF YOU ESCAPED, SO CLEARLY I'M NOT DOING GREAT AT TUNNELING AND CAMPING! I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE HAS BEEN SUCH A DICK LATELY. AND AGAIN, FUCK YOU ROTTEN FIELDS.
---
That's why I play this game, killer vs survivor interaction! Not m1 simulator, I have cookie clicker for that x)
---
The no one would play swf and the game would die
---
a less effective plague that had to literally rely on broken mechanics to be any sort of decent back in the day
---
It has been known to happen, in all regions. 
---
This particular sale is hard to predict because it's not even being branded as Sale of the Dead, so there's an element of "uncharted territory".
---
Could always trying contacting BHVR direct?
---
I think she belongs in A, she's more viable than ghostface or demi my dude.  
---
And then I don't know what to tell you if you're getting 360'd and you can't land your hits with the lunge or with the swipe.
---
Yeah I have a tablet, the pen just doesn't work well for me when drawing I dunno, I can't really get the hang of it. Thanks a ton for the compliment!
---
My favorite is from one survivor I was playing against on the red forest. I was playing as nurse which i normally dont do. I was using 5 blinks because I had a daily and I dont like nurse so I never play her aka shit blinks. All 4 looped me in the main house for most of the game as its hell in that house when a survivor is running it and I'm trying to blink to them. I ended up getting the 4k and they were all pissed saying trash killer we looped you all game etc. One of them left a comment on my steam profile saying "trash killer playing 5 blink nurse and was looped all game" I thought it was so funny because I killed them all in the end.
---
You can't hit them on the Hook anymore as far as I know. FYI :)
---
Get a dictionary on the word subjective first
---
You're definitely right. One of the things that has helped my friends is finding their playstyle. So someone I know who just bought the game really wants to play stealthy, so she knows where to look etc.
---
Can anyone tell me why people leave up the -rep ones? I've gotten a single comment on my Steam profile from a rando in DbD and I immediately deleted it because it claimed I had brain damage. Why leave the negative ones up?
---
These tier lists and replies should include rank, platform and hours played imo.  We could assume this is rank 1 with a lot of time played, otherwise the tier rankings should vary.
---
But the killer wants to win the game, when playing a game I try to do what I can to win, if you were playing fortnite you wouldn‚Äôt let someone kill you because you‚Äôd be making them sad, you kill them anyways.
---
You were on the map so you camped
---
No. Absolutely not. Pre nerf DS was so ridiculously unfair it can‚Äôt be compared to the DS we have now
---
Even if it's inefficient and bad, it does still fall under the definition of "playstyle" so yes they are playstyles.
---
WHY TF CAN KILLERS ON PS4 LEAVE BUT STILL MAKE SURVIVORS LOSE THEIR ITEMS, ENDING THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE TREATED AS THE KILLER LEAVING NOT THE SURVIVOR LEAVING!
---
PLAYING AN ENTIRE MATCH JUST TO BE KICKED BY THE SERVER MINUTES BEFORE ESCAPING, LOSING EVERY SINGLE POINT
---
It's not just "tunnel this dude" it's "tunnel this dude that's running these special high risk perks" which seems like was the devs' goal with the concept of obsession and is imo a fun mechanic
---
&gt; You know how frustrated you feel when the killer won‚Äôt quit messing with you when they could obviously kill you whenever they wanted? 
---
Honestly the difference is clear: as a killer you can just smack them (unless there is an exploit involved) and as survivor you can't do anything.
---
But honestly, when else will you goof around with other survivors but not in the exit gates? You can't control your character in the post game chat
---
Uhh, yes they can be. Complaining about a badly designed perk that you brought with full intention of using is valid whether you got to use it or not. Now if they complained about NOED being the cause of the frustration for said match, then you would have a point and the survivors are just being asinine. 
---
However, you bringing it to the match indicates how the match would have turned if it went on further than three gens left. The sentiment that whatever the gen progress of the survivors could have become would ultimately end in an unenjoyable match due to the perk in question is very much valid (e.g. early death due to weak team, later death due to questionable perk). 
---
Discussions about NOED have been going on for ages, and my opinion on the matter is irrelevant, but since you only mention being generally "shit talked" for having it, I cannot tell whether it was truly baseless or not.
---
Lol how long have you played dbd? Dwight is sterotyped to hide in lockers, not meg. Also its claudette here because this dude has the same hair as her
---
Rather be tunneled then have a killer using nurses, barbeque, spies from the shadow and discordance. Just not a fun build to go against
---
Probably not, events tend to be if you use an event offering their is a bloodpoint boost based on completing event objectives
---
There isn't a single survivor only add on that has a fraction of the impact on gameplay that an ebony or even ivory morj have.
---
you can also grab while survivors vaulting through windows if it's a slow vault, off of hooked survivor, and when they are going in and out of lockers. The only reason you can't grab while healing is for game balance. That would be a little broken.
---
That's not in my log file. Where did you find that?
---
Maybe currently, but when it was first released, not a chance.
---
Dont. Get. Caught.
---
Its not "drastic" lol. The rank 7 is a bit of an outlier but its not that bad. Id love to get this in solo, I seem to just get brown rank teamates
---
It's definitely not ideal but most of the team is close together with one outlier, but it would be pretty insane if all of you were rank 13 and then there's a rank 7.
---
What are the outfits called?
---
&gt; You're pretending that Spirit is the only "viable" Killer as some people like to say like you can play other killers than the Spirit.
---
No, I'm flat out saying that she is one of the few viable killers at red ranks. I don't give a shit if the killer is viable at rank 6-20. I care if the killer is viable at rank 1-5 as EVERY OTHER GAME balances their games to their highest skill levels, not their lowest skill levels.
---
Players with lower skills level deserve to get destroyed each and every game until they increase their skill level. It should be up to the players rather or not they win games, not devs who nerf killers just to give lower skilled players a chance. Fuck that. Increase your skill level or else. No one should feel sorry for you if you lack skill.
---
&gt; Dbd isnt build for winning every game. you win some, you lose some.
---
No game is built to win every game. But damn near every other asymmetrical game is built on your win/loss total being determined by your own skill and not the devs holding your hand.
---
&gt; thats dbd
---
No, what's dbd is: "Ohh the poor baby can't loop the killer? Let's make the killer slower to give the poor baby a chance". And that's why it'll never reach e-sports level, will never be taken serious by any competitive gamer, and will never expand it's player base. Most gamers play to win the game, not play to farm points and get participation trophies. All the popular games are competitive games. Even popular RPGs are competitive games.
---
By balancing for the lowest skill level and ignoring the competitive gamer, DBD has lowered it's ceiling in terms of playerbas and thus in terms of revenue and popularity. Congrats BHVR, you played yourself. Better get started on that battle pass to pump the money out of the remaining players as much as you can, cause new players will play the game for free weekends then drop it like a stone when the weekend is over.
---
&gt; Nurses changes are absolutley fine you're pretending like she got nerfed to F tier while she's still the best killer in the game
---
No I'm flat out saying that the lie.. the hook.. the bait was "please nerf her addons :(" but what they really meant was nerf her base and addons. The same shit they would like to see done to the Spirit. So I'm not falling for this addon/Prayer Beads needs to be nerfed" shit. They want the killer nerfed period, and don't care how it's done.
---
I know what subjective means, I am participating in your discussion thread where you gave your opinions and responded with mine.  No reason to try to play it off like I'm dumber than you because I don't agree with you.
---
I had someone gen tapping NORMAL skill checks yesterday and it literally blew my mind
---
OoO and everything.
---
Every time someone posts this someone else says it doesn‚Äôt work.  I still have no idea.
---
Balance changes:
---
* Hex: Ruin now has a chance to set off a fucking nuke when its Hex Totem is destroyed.
---
Wallhacks
---
I'm pretty sure u want legion buff don't you?
---
IMAGINE HAVING THE AUDACITY TO SET SOME TRAPS AND HIT SOMEONE TWICE.  SO TOXIC.
---
I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO KNOW WHAT TEACHABLES I'VE UNLOCKED! IT'S ANNOYING THAT I CAN'T JUST KNOW WHAT I HAVE AND DON'T HAVE. 
---
IF THERE IS A WAY TO KNOW THIS AND I'M JUST BLIND, WELL THEN...I'LL BE MAD.
---
No, it's happening to me as well.
---
someone made a post about it last night.
---
someone else made a post about it today.
---
someone else mentioned it in the rage thread.
---
hopefully it gets fixed soon
---
Lol dang
---
The Freddy in DBD is from the 2010 remake.  Doubt you'll ever see the original Freddy bc then they'd have to pay Robert Englund and New Line and not just Platinum Dunes.
---
Why do we have to play through something broken? bhvr could just balance it out
---
You need to DC 30% or more of games to get a sportsmanship autoban. I'd say of all my games 2-3% are Iri head + Infantry belt. I refuse to waste 10-15 of my time playing a match that's totally imbalanced. If it were truly just 1 hatchet it would be fine, but 3 instadown hatchets is totally unfair.
---
That's fucking sexy \*unzip pants\*
---
It's a bug
---
If you ever want to look more stupid after some dumb plays, blame the killer for wallhackz
---
So you're bragging about your points lmfao

CAN WE TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE FUCKING PALLETS FROM ORMOND RESORT?  THAT MAP IS JUST AS GOOD FOR SURVIVORS AS HADDONFIELD, EVERY JUNGLE GYM HAS A PALLET AND A WINDOW VAULT AND IS DIRECTLY NEXT TO ANOTHER JUNGLE GYM.  ALL OF THESE ARE EASY TO CHAIN TO THE MAIN BUILDING.
---
AND FIX THE FUCKING DIM AURAS ON THAT MAP, BBQ DOESN'T SHOW ME SHIT.
---
I only camp when I'm salty that my Devour Hope is in a bad spot. I only tunnel if you teabag me. Gg ez.
---
I very much hope so
---
I'm a killer main, but I do like playing survivor too, and lagging out of a lot of my games is really annoying
---
When you get what you want but not what you need.
---
I do, I don't post much tho, it's gonthelizard :)
---
Can't wait for dedicated servers. On PS4, I feel like I'm the only person who can host an ok connection sometimes
---
You're totally fine without it. But only the licensed DLC costs money. The DLC that is original BHVR creations can be earned for free.
---
Emotes? No thanks
---
It says in the perk description that they both increase vault speed, but I'm not 100% sure if they stack but after running them together for a while it seems like they do.
---
im a good pig!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Why the donvotes not all of use know every expolite and just want more information on the subject
---
&gt; if you main killer you won't be able to win games without Ruin
---
This isn't true
---
&gt; so the game is basically a pay to win
---
excuse for being bad
---
Susie and Frank, I just think it's cute ^w^
---
SELECT A KILLER AND PULL UP THEIR CHARACTER INFO. SHOULD SEE A SCREEN THAT SHOWS THEIR 3 TEACHABLES. IF YOU SEE A CHECK MARK YOU HAVE ALREADY UNLOCKED IT!!!
---
"lmfao"
---
pathetic.
---
Some people tend to say that purple ranks are just like green ranks which isn't true. The scoreboard above just shows it. There is a drastic difference, thats it.
---
JUST BECAUSE I RUN KINDRED DOESN'T MEAN ALL OF YOU HAVE TO COME GET ME UNTIL THERE ARE NO GENS TO BE REPAIRED.
---
Why are we still here?
---
a small price to pay for pre-rework Legion
---
I KNOW RIGHT? SO MANY SURVIVORS DC IF YOU BRING BEADS SPIRIT BUT AT THE SAME TIME BRING RED SYRINGES OR BNPS LIKE, LOL OKAY, FINE FOR YOU TO USE YOUR RARE BUSTED SHIT BUT IF A KILLER DOES IT'S TOXIC AND YOU CAN DC FREELY
---
CANT WAIT FOR DISCONNECT PUNISHMENTS. SO SICK OF PLAYING 2-3 SURVIVOR GAMES BECAUSE I HAD THE AUDACITY TO BRING HAUNTED GROUNDS AND GOT A DOWN QUICKLY.
---
Ace is a great survivor tho, his "body" is top tier. 
---
He is quiet when wounded, breaths softly and with p3 blends relatively well, his only downside is he is rather tall which makes him ill suited for stealthy gameplay.
---
This is a major advantage vs killers like spirit who rely on sound so much.
---
His perks are not great but theres a reason he is a fairly popular p3 choice
---
Thats cool DBD is on PS4.
---
I don't shame anyone, wtf?
---
Yep a rank 1 killer is bad, yep you got me
---
Its been happening for weeks literally every game. I keep thinking ‚Äúoh maybe it wont happen this game‚Äù but it always does
---
I never said anything about disliking the perk, just said that when survivors give you shit about bringing NOED, at least you actually did it
---
Meanwhile,  when survivors give you shit for camping while you literally did the opposite, you are being falsely accused
---
I just prefer to be accused of something I did do instead of being accused for something I actively avoided doing
---
They havnt though about fixing it yet?
---
I play killer there as well and Ruin is not a requirement to win
---
Why is ghostface better than billy? 
---
Also imo hag should be high A tier
---
I find great joy in playing Freddy. It‚Äôs just fun to pretend warp to a gen, only to see them crawl away from the gen, right into your arms.
---
Ghostface and Legion. I know Legion isn't top tier but I usually do really good with them and have fun
---
WHAT OKAY!
---
The majority of the top tier perks are with free characters (Nea, David, Bill, Claudette, Nurse) and the dlc character‚Äôs perks can be found in the shrine if you‚Äôre lucky.
---
Killers require more DLC than survivors to have the absolute best loadouts though.
---
Except you're going to have an obsession if you bring an obsession perk, even if no survivor brought an obsession perk. So it's more like "tunnel this dude who maybe brought an obsession perk, but also maybe not, just kill him". 
---
But anyway, incentives to tunneling are bad in any case, even if coated in a risk/reward strategy. And good news, the devs have been moving away from that, making Borrowed time one of the best perks, reworking DS into a very cool anti-tunneling perk, trying to punish farming and reward protection hits, introducing obsession swapping, reworking Dying Light. The game design is very much punishing tunneling more and more, and that's good.
---
I would agree with this guy. The only my problems with those two perks can happen in the endgame if I screwed up the rest of the match or if I randomly get DS'ed out of nowhere. Both happen rarely enough.
---
RUN!
---
Oh shit. That's something I'd actually like to know instead of the guy getting unhook points and healing, They were probably on gens which is the a horrible way to get bp
---
It's not that easy. They dont have a button that magically fixes all their bugs.
---
Since no one has said it:
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury
---
They keep adding skins and theres been two fixes since this started happening.
---
If you're finding yourself in a situation often that you need to wait 60 seconds to pick someone up, maybe you should consider your playstyle. Yeah, on the occasion someone makes a dumb unhook that you should punish, but just slug the person who was unhooked and hook the farmer instead.
---
Nothing makes me happier than getting a 4k with having hooked every survivor 3 times and finding out they all had DS yet none of them got to use it.
---
Sitting at a gen and getting 4 skill checks per minute isn't skillful, nor is finding a totem that is lit like a christmas tree in the open skillful. So I prefer the skill role - killer, where I hunt constantly, constantly have to look for little clues, grass movements, breathing, grunts, gen sounds, footsteps. A role where I can't hide in the locker all game and still escape. A role where I have to hook and leave or else get gen rushed. Constantly moving, constantly making plays, constantly improving my skill - that's skillful game play. 
---
Increasing my skill level up to the point where I can road apple any SWF team with my Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Freddy, Hag, Myers has been a pleasure. Currently working on increasing my Demo skill so that I can add him to the list as well.
---
Defeating a strong team is what I categorize as "fun". Losing is not fun, no matter how much survivors like to spin it. I'm not there to give survivors a good time, I'm there to utterly destroy them, I'm there to make them fear ever playing against me again. I don't care about your 4%, about your hatch begs, about your made-up rules. I see you - I kill you, it's that simple.
---
A survivor's idea of fun is not a killer's idea of fun. And if a survivor's idea of "fun" isn't increasing their skill level to the point where they can win against any killer, then to me their idea of fun should not be considered by any reasonable dev since that survivor only wants the easiest route to a victory by lowering the power of killers.
---
More killers need to be buffed to red-rank viable, not viable killers needing to be nerfed to non-viable red ranks. Until they do the prior, fuck doing the latter.
---
The most overpowered thing about this game is SWFs. Fix that shit before worry about viable killers. Don't want to fix that shit? Then don't "fix" viable killers.
---
I always die 95% even  w/o the reset. but yeah killers heaven depending on the rank
---
BRO I HAD A YELLOW TRAPPER BAG AND GREEN SETTING TOOLS.  I WASN'T EVEN USING MY GOOD ADD ONS. BUT IT STILL ENDED UP COSTING ME ABOUT 9K BP FOR A 16K ROUND.
---
There goes my money.
---
The bug team and skin team are different, they work on different things.
---
They may not know the cause of this bug, which makes it much harder to fix.
---
Because it‚Äôs a bunch of shit that‚Äôs free anyway. And doesn‚Äôt take long to get at all. Kinda pointless.
---
Not when they're all down and he's picking them up and putting them down.
---
Enjoy getting gen rushed
---
This was when Spirit was pretty new. He may not have known what predicament he got himself into.
---
Please note that I never said anything about getting use out of NOED or not, I just said that when they complain you brought NOED, at least you actually brought NOED.
---
Meanwhile if you actively try to avoid camping and then get called a camper, it feels pretty shitty.
---
I prefer to get called out for something I actually did (bring NOED) than to get accused of something I actively avoided doing (camping)
---
If you have (most of the toolbox and addon combinations except for brown) a toolbox you will 100% a fully regressed generator solo and still hit the killer with DS if they find you after you pop it.
---
"Tunneling".
---
Because we are supposed to be big boys and girls not little kids.  Little kids flip the Monopoly Board over and go run into their room crying when they're losing.  Big boys and girls say goddamit Park Place again?  Alright take your money.  And we continue rolling the dice.  Ragequitting is seriously the most pathetic display of sportsmanship short of straight exploits and hacks.
---
I think it was a David, if I recall correctly.
---
Good thing I don't
---
also Ruin is not locked behind a paywall. Don't lie to new players
---
With servers being as shit as they are atm respecting pallets is always the incorrect play as often you can punish the survivor anyway because the hit might register regardless of client side. Ive seen clips of people DHing to a pallet dropping it and the killer lunging INTO the pallet AFTER IT IS ALREADY DROPPED and clipping the survivor
---
Whasssssuuuuuuppppp ????
---
well, technically it is. Just like basement patrol Bubba and friendly killers
---
Why is clown so low
---
I have my messages and friends requests blocked on PS4, yes people will actually go as far as to insult you in friends requests. Its alot easier playing with both of them blocked, it doesn't give people a chance to say something they might get reported for.
---
Yeah PS4 just has random lag
---
And now your daily will magically change during your next match and you won't complete it.
---
Cringe
---
NOED doesn't prevent that, Blood Warden does. People can still Tbag at the exit then escape when you approach the gates.
---
How lol
---
IMO Legion is better than Leatherface, wraith, doc and clown. Not only A) he can get the first hit easiest out of those 5 killers, B) He has the most tracking that cannot be countered (for doc you can balance tier 1 and get in lockers) meaning that if you get good with Legion you wont need BBq, and C) hes the shortest out of all them killers making it easier to mindgame. His height reduces in frenzy even further.
---
People simply haven't played Legion to understand how decent he is, he is not top top tier in the slightest, but he's like low mid tier and high low tier if that makes sense. Its like old Freddy, Freddy wasn't bad but everyone thought he was because nobody actually played him and the people who did play him knew that he wasn't the worst. 
---
Also IMO pig should move up a bit, has quite a bit of pressure.
---
This would destroy queue times in a game where queue times are already a huge problem.  At red ranks I'm waiting 5 minutes a game to play survivor on PS4 this would nuke that into oblivion.  Like it or not the community needs SWF to keep this game going.  The community would die without it.  We can't afford to lose that large of the playerbase.
---
Fair
---
Especially when you hear the theme music declaring that he hit tier three. Fucking. Terrifying.
---
&gt; If he is buying on console you don't need to pay for ruin. He didn't specify a platform.
---
You don't have to pay for Ruin on PC, either
---
I want to get drugged by Freddy
---
A studio can work on more than one thing. I'm pretty sure the animation department doesn't help out reworking perks when they aren't busy.
---
Then all 4 survivors have to individually complete a generator alone if they want to use the hatch ü§∑
---
Still a bitch.
---
Yeah, I think they are strong, but not game breaking, but funny how what I thought was the reason they are in the game (noed against rushing survs, ds against tunneling), originally had nothing to do with them xD
---
But thanks for the infos
---
If anyone in the game has an obsession perk than it will randomly choose someone to be the obsession. It is more likely to be a survivor who has an obsession perk (which is why they say increase the chance of being the obsession) however it is not mandatory that someone have an obsession perk in order to br chosen.
---
It is perfectly normal and not glitchy for you to be the obsession from someone else's DS
---
Someone‚Äôs gonna rip you apart for not having nurse in her own tier
---
In taller loops they can See your Head so you Can't moonwalk or mindgame
---
Legitimately, thought this was a thunder cross split attack meme for a second.
---
Lol its not just me

Survivor mains on here like genuinely agreeing with you rofl

Play how you want, don't let these entitled survivors tell you what you can and can't do. You ARENT on their team and they don't care one bit if you have fun as killer so do what you gotta
---
"Yeah, touch that Nea, you naughty David!"
---
I have seen literally nobody else say this at all. When there's actually a problem the /new queue has people talking about it, like with the game kicking people right now
---
Lower Rank: Survivors complaining about trivial shit like tunneling/camping
---
Higher Rank: Survivors being just plain toxic for no reason
---
Not a problem for most triple A shooters, rocket league, LoL, Dota, Borderlands, etc...
---
I think its just gameplay mechanics that perpetuate the lag.

Yeah I figured. I play on console and get her automatically didn't think

My mates and i all have this problem. Just because its not happening to ‚ÄòYOU‚Äô doesnt mean its not happening

How is it not fun?
---
If you lose yours, just look at the nearest locker.
---
Ok so there's a balanced game mode, and another one you will likely get thrashed in if you're not running the best killers, best perks.
---
As much as i would love this and hate SWF due to how unbalanced it is, this isn't that great as nobody would search for a SWF game.
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).

Short answer yes.  Long answer yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssssssss.
---
"Demogorgon calm down"
---
Two things wrong with your comment:
---
1. You can get hit by ds even if you don't tunnel, and since you're expected to end chases fast as fuck on high ranks as you get better you'll see it more often.
---
2. A slugged survivor applies as much pressure as a hooked survivor, a slugged survivor is a way to get survivors off gens and avoid getting "gen rushed" (but you need to know when to use it).
---
Including my Mori?

I made a post about this 10 days ago. It is happening to everyone.

Umm, how exactly  does he press the plunger?
---
If a player has bad connection on dedicated servers, it still results in these hits. The dedicated servers have come a long way as they've had 3 test runs and recently this is the first time they've released on live servers.
---
They're much better than initial tests, but they're far from the holy grail everyone begged for.
---
The mid-chapter patch is set to come out next Tuesday, barring any technical difficulties. All chapter and mid-chapter patches release on on Tuesdays. In this case it's the 22nd, as other people have indicated, and will introduce both the Archives and the Rift pass.
---
&gt; It is happening to everyone.
---
It very clearly is not happening to everyone lmfao
---
As a killer, I always make sure to be toxic. It's part of the job. When was the last time you heard of a nice killer? Seriously. You just gotta devote yourself fully to the role.
---
Ehh it's not bad rofl, you can 360 relatively quick on console if you do it right.
---
No unless you play as demogrogonüò°
---
I wouldn't mind some more like what Survivors already have.
---
Fortnite Dancing? Oh HELL nah.

sounds like you and your mates have some personal problems then

Not sure who down voted you. You literally just hit the hook behind them this patch.

It makes maps like the swamp or the cornfield a little harder for the hag.

He wasnt running anymore speed increasing perks other than noed. Which is why this confuses me.
---
In any other situation that would never hit. I got balanced landing into a fast vault which carries your momentum. You can even see I was through the vault before he even got up the whole incline.
---
That has only ever happened to me on dedicated servers. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I actually had more consistent results with pre-rework Freddy than current Legion. 
---
I think he's tied with Bubba.
---
shorter killers get fucked by grass and shit
---
taller killers have a more obvious red stain
---
1. They‚Äôll have to mend eventually 
---
2. Yeah exhaustion perks can be pretty nasty but if you activate the power after they use it you can outrun them
---
3. Just end frenzy and m1 them

4. Fatigue sucks ass but you get used to it. Don‚Äôt bring cooldown add ons, they‚Äôre not worth it

5. Frank‚Äôs mixtape is useless don‚Äôt bring it

Plague is solid she‚Äôs really underrated, if you don‚Äôt have a Miley look into him he‚Äôs my favorite
---
I didnt want to draw the joke on too long, some people hate those kinds of edits
---
AaronsPlaysTV, Fungoose, and a few others are a couple that I think are a lot better than Noob in terms of practical game knowledge and performance, 360'ing is cute, but it's not the defining factor whether somebody is "the best" at all.

 T-T
---
I believe this is desync caused by dedicated servers, I think they said they're aware of this as they initially made it so killer can close the hatch before the survivor goes through. Though at the moment if a survivor enters the hatch, it's almost as if the survivor blocks the animation of closing it all together.
---
I've been experiencing this when the killer leaves, if you are on ps4 theres an exploit rn which makes the game treat it like the survivors left when the killer leaves in a certain way
---
PEOPLE WHO POINT OUT WHERE ANOTHER SURVIVOR IS/DELIBERATELY GET THEIR TEAM KILLED THROUGH SANDBAGGING OR FARMING ARE PURE SCUM, I HAVE BEEN CALLED A TUNNELER FOR KILLING THESE PEOPLE FIRST BUT I DON'T CARE, STOP ABUSING YOUR TEAM AND BEING TOXIC IF YOU DON'T WANT A TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE
---
I do lullaby fire up dying light and save the best for last for a nice snowball build
---
It‚Äôs easier to loop/mind game taller killers
---
Real talk, I just started playing but I've camped a hook once or twice. Not to be a dick, its just because I knew another survivor was nearby. Seemed like common sense. 
---
Is this just straight up considered asshole behavior? I'm not trying to be toxic or anything, just not lose as badly as I usually lose.
---
idk why you got downvoted, ash's perks are all pretty bad outside of like flip flop for meme builds.
---
&gt;But thanks for the infos
---
Of course. It's hard to write stuff like that without sounding like a dick. I'm glad you weren't insulted by it.
---
Trapper : Place trap on the ground, grabbing the survivor by the back of the head then slamming them down into the trap.
---
Wraith : Dunno how to describe it perfectly but I'd say grabbing the survivor and pulling them into the Spirit World but only half of them, causing them to basically be ripped in half. (Kinda like Corpse Party ending if anyone saw that anime, unsure of game). 
---
An alternative would be grabbing the survivor by the hair/head and bashing their face in with the weapon.
---
SWF should stay. The game will die without it. 
---
I also think the game would die with an opt out system too though. So many people would opt out and then it'd just take forever to get a match.
---
Lithe, Dance w Me, &amp; Urban Evasion .... wins almost every chase
---
Me, running make your choice, having literally NO reason to tunnel:
---
Survivors that ran into my arms: TOXIC TUNNELER 
---
Me: you came.. right to me
---
Them: I can‚Äôt beat your ass without getting closer
---
I'm sorry but, no, this is a really bad take on ds, that's not how you play against it, just stop tunneling, it's really that easy, dont down someone and camp the slug for 60 seconds what are you insane. The counter to ds is to slug and then to just go away and pressure someone else, it has the same pressure as hooking someone.
---
And sure, sometimes ds activates when you didnt tunnel and you're just hooking everyone really fast, but if you're applying that much pressure ds isnt that big a deal, and it can still be countered by keeping track of the time and players unhooked.
---
Whats your problem. This is a rant post and im ranting
---
You shouldn't tag team a gen with ruin. Two people's worth of skillchecks, and if one misses a check, progress is disabled for both people. It only gets worse as you get a 3rd or fourth person. It's better to spread out.
---
Sportmanship in a fucking game, k
---
Soooooo, their quick counter spells? Wtf is the point
---
The killers always leaves the lobby before we get to see the lobby screen, that have anything to do with it?
---
I can understand the Wraith one. That‚Äôd be cool to see half of the survivors body fade into nothingness as they try to crawl away
---
If they do them separately, they definitely can. Easily.
---
Trapper: Holds an active bear trap &amp; punches the survivor's head with it
---
Wraith: Slams the survivor's head with his bell then drags his axe down their back
---
Billy: Cripples the survivor's legs with his mallet causing them to lay on their back, then he plunges his chainsaw into their stomach dragging downward
---
Huntress: Simple head chop/decapitation; The Huntress is a simple woman
---
Cannibal: Hits the survivor's head with his mallet then chainsaws through the back
---
Nightmare: Freddy vanishes leaving a pool of blood from which a larger version of his right hand appears to stab the survivor in the back with his laugh playing. 
---
Pig: Hard to decide, best I could come up with his to have her put a note/tape in the survivor's mouth then slit their throat
---
Clown: Reverse his, cut the finger first then stomp on their head
---
Nurse/Shape/Hag/Doctor/Spirit/Legion/Plague/Ghostface/Demogorgon: Leave them as they are.
---
:(
---
I TRIED TO BE A GOOD SPORT AND EMPATHIZE WITH A KILLER, SO SAID "I HATE WHEN SURVIVORS DISCONNECT, SORRY DUDE" LAST NIGHT AND THE KILLER BASICALLY TOLD ME TO SHOVE IT UP MY ASS AND I'M STILL BUTTHURT ABOUT IT.
---
I can honestly say my experience is the same as the guy's above. Most games than not I get at least 2 survivors say gg with pretty much every game being 3 or 4k. But then again I don't tunnel or camp so who would've tought survivors are actually nice even if they die as long as you let them play the game normally.
---
Dedicated servers just aren't the answer and people cant figure that out.
---
Say I live in Texas and the killer lives in Maine, our ping before dedicated servers would be roughly 60-80 depending on our internet quality.
---
Now assume we live in the same places, but the dedicated servers dont have a central point that makes both our connections equal. What if we get put on a server in Texas? I'll now have good connection while the killer could still have the same connection as before. 
---
This results in survivors seeing green ping and assuming they're not going to experience these types of hits, but the killer is still at the same ping as before so nothing has changed. Hit registration is usually awarded to killer as long as it's an M1. Though for some reason this doesn't apply to phantom saws and huntress hatchets.
---
The David why not, but the Meg no because he already picked her up and put her down, so the wiggle bar would be already enough full.. so that would be risky ^^
---
There's a stupid players mentality where "winning = toxicity" and that you are responsible for the opponents having fun. You'll see the phrases tryhards, camping, tunneling, cheeser, sweats, etc when the entire issue is that the devs haven't implemented anything that prevents or hinders the benefit of getting a guaranteed kill, goal, or reward of some type that leads to these unfun moments.
---
This isn't a DBD exclusive issue as you'll see these idiots everywhere, but yeah you shouldn't care about ruining someone else's games by playing the game in a "unfun" way.
---
Actual decapitations would get the game banned in quite a few places, so no dice on that demo change
---
It annoys me to see gen tappers as survivor I think it's just sad.  Either git gud and practice skillchecks/power through it (still faster than tapping by the way) or go find the totem.
---
I shame gen tappers off my gen anytime I see that garbage.  I just teabag and shake my head at them until they either stop or leave.  I refuse to repair with those clowns.
---
I purposely leave people who were hooked twice alone for a while unless they tbag me because I'm a survivor main and I know how that feels. 
---
AND THEY STILL CALL ME A CAMPING KILLER. Like bruh, I run from the hook even though I don't have Devour.
---
Though credit where credit is do. I equally get as many thank you messages or "hey you're really good" messages when I do stuff like that.
---
I don't think that's the intended behavior, it was the first time I've ever seen anyone but the obsession perk user be the obsession.
---
I used custom perk icons from r/perkbydaylight
---
You have to be on PC, they have an entire tutorial on the subreddit that'll tell you exactly how to do it.
---
People fear that you can get banned, but devs have confirmed no one has been banned and there's a very high chance you'll never get banned for changing the icons of ingame things.
---
I used the icons from https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/d6b03n/the_golden_pack_updated/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
pls no I don't want a flood of emotes. I swear it will make the game really cringy and ruin the aesthetic and design if there are motions beyond pointing and hand waving. New mories would be fine, but the more you flesh those out, the more people will complain when mories get nerfed/reworked (because they're clearly not balanced now)
---
Probably an analytics glitch
---
You doing alright there bud?
---
I love this so much oh my god
---
Camping when the gates are powered is fair imo (I'm a survivor main)
---
Yup, that's a thing that's supposed to exist.  It looks like your family skipped that lesson.  They still pretending your two pair beats a flush in that household?  Oh my god you won again.  Mommies little muffin is so good at cards yes he is, yes he is.  *proceeds to blow rasberries.
---
The Scarred Hand refers to them as the ‚ÄúCannibal Village Butcher‚Äù.
---
I let the salt get the better of me sometimes as survivor but devour is literally an anti-camp playstyle perk. They have no argument there. Tbh having that first effect of devour pop and realizing wtf is happening is super adrenaline bursting in the moment. The gens become irrelevant as you swarm the map looking for totems before they get the mori effect. Game gets intense, slows things down on killer side, overall fun perk to fight against. You can't win with some people
---
I‚Äôll take new Mori, the trapper and the wraith pretty much have the same animation,
---
How is clown d tier
---
Just finished a game where a survivor thought they were better than they were with the taunts and the trying to body/hook block. 
---
Ended up on a hook 3 times in a row because he followed me with a flashlight and didnt heal. 
---
Called me the tunneling hook camper
---
Finally I can complete my pallet munching build!!! Brutal Strength, Fire Up, Enduring, Spirit Fury
---
Survivors still think Clown needs nerfed though.
---
"non-android arm"
---
OK, but make it last 30 seconds only.
---
ez
---
Honestly, Dead by Daylight is the kind of game where one side will always fault the other and say they‚Äôre toxic- this is a game with a fucked ranking system and the points don‚Äôt matter so I‚Äôve always subscribed to the idea that you should play how you want and have fun because in the end it‚Äôs really just a game.
---
sometimes when i come back  to the hook, i chase the survivor on the hook for 1 second and ignore them to let them know i am not tunneler or camper and go after the person that unhooked them, and in the end if they do manage to escape they will teabag and point. like you do realize i could easily be toxic and i showed you i am not toxic killer yet you don't respect me like i respected you. so sometimes it can be frustrating that you play nicely but the survivors dont.
---
This game is the one that drove me to completely privatize my steam profile. At first I just disabled comments but then people started commenting on old screenshots of unrelated games.
---
No other game have I had salty twits go so far out of their way to let me know I need to have cancer and die.
---
Your number 6 is kind of cool.  Proximity boxes.  Maybe only see them within 32 meters or something.  Haven't heard that one pitched before I like it.
---
I can see that, unfortunately!
---
Whassssssuuuuuuupppppp!!!!!!!
---
People always say this, they have different teams who work on completely different aspects of a game. It's not just like 5 people who make a game. There are multiple factors and things. A team who works on cosmetics is solely there to do just that while there is a completely different team to think of new killers and abilities, a team for game quality and bugs, etc.
---
yea no response, im best pig!!! fu, im better than escorpion
---
why do people even care about "rep" anyway? honestly its fun to collect responses from people who feel strongly enough to find your profile and leave a comment. i wish people did it more to mine.
---
Well yeah, under p2p you just have to deal with each others ping directly, and not having to route it through a server.  There were several posts explaining that exactly this would happen of we got servers but no one listened to them.
---
Medium vaults are very meaningful if you play clown.  Before they made that change his bottle forced the slow vault instead of just the medium one, so they took a lot of his bite away with that one.
---
Yeah the ranks reset every two weeks-ish, right? Seems not worth the effort to get upset about them. 
---
Fortunately I'm on Xbox, so I guess if anyone wants to yell at me they need to put in effort. Or just teabag me at the gates while I wave goodbye.
---
Do a quick swipe instead of a lunge then.
---
Her old traps would have been broken with the hatch close mechanic hence why the devs made the endgame change they did.  If you want to buff Pig pitch ideas for early-midgame changes.  You're never getting your old traps back again with the EGC.  They would have been too powerful.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel as Hag lol. Had a game last night against a 4man Meg and they weren‚Äôt very good, they would teabag at every pallet (not stunning me) and they all ended up in the basement. 3 out of the 4 DCd AFTER I hooked them lol
---
Survivors entitled salt has just led me to enjoying it more lol
---
I wanna play with spirit raw
---
Still doesnt take away from the fact this has been happening for the last two patches
---
Tunneling is if you dont do your taxes in between hooks.
---
The attention span and behaviour of a child. Figures
---
I mean you just said leatherfaces mori as a change when thats already how it is but i like the others besides pigs i like hers as it is especially with the hoffman skin
---
Murder
---
By any chance do you play this game with your brother
---
The banana peel tastes horribly, the fig peel tastes ok, that's the difference.
---
they need to update some of the mori's
---
&gt;Honestly the difference is clear: as a killer you can just smack them (unless there is an exploit involved) and as a survivor you can't do anything. I've played both sides enough to compare.
---
If I‚Äôm understanding this comment correctly, what you‚Äôre saying is as a killer I can force survivors out of the gate by hitting them, and somehow that makes it ok for survivors to just sit in the exit gate.  No, it doesnt.
---
And it definitely is holding the game hostage, the EGC fortunately creates a limit for how long survivors can hold the game hostage, but it‚Äôs still holding the game hostage.  
---
Here‚Äôs the bottom line:  if postgame chat isn‚Äôt good enough and you just absolutely have to headnod or teabag or whatever er with the other survivors in the exit gate, that by itself is fine.  But if the killer is nowhere nearby and you do it for so long that the killer has to walk over and actually force you out of the exit gate, you‚Äôre being a dick.  And if you don‚Äôt care, fine, but don‚Äôt act like that‚Äôs just ‚Äúgoofing around.‚Äù  Forcing the killer to watch you celebrate is more than goofing around, it‚Äôs taunting and it‚Äôs toxic.

42 FKN NEA LEVES WITH BALANCE LANDING LEVEL
---
Couldn't have said it better
---
The things she can use 4 times a match without addons vs. The thing she can use throughout the entire game both in chase and to find and ambush survivors is her main ability....If you can't see their point I don't know what to tell you.
---
Didn't mean to hit a nerve. I do realize survivors do it as well. Disconnecting out of frustration is crap. However, when a killer disconnects, it ends the game. So, to have that kind of power and abusing it is trash
---
Just to be clear, he said never. It really has never happened to you either?
---
Also, I said survivors have complained to me in virtually every possible scenario. You name it, somebody has cried to me after it.
---
HA HA HA *hack* HA HA AH
---
This is me 100% lol
---
why is a shitpost if thats a fact?
---
sure
---
Ok, that‚Äôs cool. Good for you, you‚Äôre a great survivor.
---
I think it should be you have to hook everyone once
---
you ok?
---
I am slowly making my blendette build for when I want to meme. Iron Will, Self Care, Urban Evasion and I‚Äôm debating whether I bring an exhaustion perk or another stealth perk. What stealth perk should I bring if I do bring one?
---
HE MUST ESCAPE
---
then you agree with me? piggy sucks.
---
Man can‚Äôt wait to graduate and play some dead by daylight after the ceremony only to see a fucking nea breakdancing
---
A clown with no ruin probably has end game perks so as soon as someone else opened the other door I decided I was out.
---
You made a post saying you haven‚Äôt seen anyone else have this issue and I just showed you my post about it from over a week ago. It is happening to everyone. You must be dense.
---
Notice you always see these posts of survivors understanding the killers perspective and never the other way around. Fact.
---
Well...great I guess. You want a cookie or something? üëç
---
I played a rank 2 Bubba the other day that demolished us.  I had to settle for the hatch as last survivor.  He played out of his mind and just clapped everybody.  They weren't the best survivors but it was still impressive his mindgames were on point.  Great players can have success with low tier killers.  It just requires far more optimal play and leaves less room for mistakes.
---
wtf how o you found this shit!?
---
I think they only have the license to the show so it'd have to be Eligos. Yeah I watched the first episode and was quite sad when i could recogniE every perk from it.

You see it a few times. Most notably at the beginning during the "Say something" scene. Never his full face,  though.

---
I stopped using Dead Hard due to latency, it never worked for me the way it should. But many people actually use it successfully. I use Lithe instead, it fits my gameplay style and is much more reliable I'm my unstable internet.
---
Would probably be a fair trade off.
---
Ok?
---
Game would die without it.
---
They're just mad they lost, it sucks that you can never really stop people from being like that
---
I've seen this too much, but I'm glad that you made it. Good job!
---
nah, you just need to learn how to play her
---
You can just check your name in the pre-game lobby, on your profile. They won't be able to change that.
---
Too much swearing in this game where we brutally murder people and eat their livers/vomit down their throats.
---
You're just an entitled Killer main just get good 4Head
---
Piping isn't satisfying though, surviving is
---
I wish Xbox brought back the ‚ÄúAvoid This Person‚Äù feature from the 360, if you choose to avoid them you literally never saw them again online. idk how they managed that but it was amazing
---
Yes. You can check out my youtube channel. I have 40 videos with him. We are a very good team. We started playing this game 3 months ago and right now we are in the red ranks. You can't go into red ranks without communication and with random people. My videos is with no commentary at this moment but i will fix that soon. I hope you enjoy this video. I like this game a lot and im playing it almost every day.
---
Make hex perks more viable by removing debuff icons associated with them. Idk if that would be too op but as a survivor main I find it rather ridiculous that I know I'm hexed instantly whether it be lullaby, ruin, exposed, etc. At the high ranks the second that debuff is up the totems are cleansed super quick making it a little sad for the killer
---
You can just check there name in the pre-game lobby, on there profile. They won't be able to change that
---
If I can play Hag, anyone else can haha. (This doesn‚Äôt mean I should see an influx of Hag mains, I like playing as her, not against her) 
---
But seriously, I cannot play Huntress or Nurse to save my life. Nurse gives me a headache from her fatigue but Huntress???? I can‚Äôt aim for shit.  But Hag can be quite satisfying after many games, just trap the shit out of places and practice teleporting!  You‚Äôll love her
---
Here's a funny story for you, I put a hidden offering on whilst playing killer. Everyone readied up. Load into the match and there is only 3 survivors, one DC's to a shroud of separation
---
Haha what do you mean? It‚Äôs a question thread!
---
Lol I'm perfectly fine man.  Just clowning a dude that can't comprehend why it's totally pathetic to ragequit.  Just having some fun at the expense of an extremely immature player.
---
They were probably a survive with friends group with the median age of like 14 years old.  Salty babies are gonna be salty babies brother, don't let it bother you.  
---
If anything take it as a mark of pride, a group of four sweaty try hards lost so hard they all spent the next 10 minutes trying to get a rise out of you.  How pathetic is that?
---
Well seeing as the Entity could pull anyone from any timeline, doesn't that mean it could just pull Pyramid Head directly out of James Sunderland's mind as the physical being we see? On top of that, if he also brings James into the realm, that gives Pyramid Head even more of a reason to exist. But I agree with the Konami part, they might be a bit hard to deal with. Maybe not impossible, but hard.

---
Ya dude I fully understand your frustration. I play as nice as possible when I play killer, half the time I only 2 hook people and go make food or something while they all leave, but I had to turn off messages on ps4 because people message you no matter how you play, even boasting that about the win as if I didnt ignore them and let them escape lol.

I have been playing in Xbox for a while now and I always look forward to the occasional message (when I am playing good as a killer) ‚ÄúYour Trash‚Äù or ‚ÄúTunneler‚Äù I laugh and continue on. I don‚Äôt believe I am a Toxic Killer but if they think that oh well
---
Luck does not affect items.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhgghhhhhhhhhhh...
---
If you enjoy my video im happy thats all :)
---
Thanks for your time!
---
You should just laugh at those people instead of trying to sympathize with them.
---
Gonna start sending this to basement build users as an act of terrorism
---
And that‚Äôs what I like to hear!  People need to play to have FUN. Just because someone isn‚Äôt top tier doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt be having the time of your life!
---
I totally agree, that system worked so well for its time.
---
no, you are extra salty
---
800 in total.
---
So what did you do that makes you such a target of harassment?
---
Ah yes this again, it‚Äôs even better the 19th time it‚Äôs been posted.
---
The chases and map pressure feel more like chores/work. Like don't get me wrong, its perfectly doable, but as a top tier killer you don't have to put half the effort to chase or apply map pressure and it doesn't feel like race against time whereas low tier killers have to get a good head start or they lose, they need to capitalize on survivors making mistakes almost in every chase, they rely too much on certain perks therefore, your perks of choice are limited if you are planning to get a single sacrifice, etc. The list goes on why its not fun for low tier killers at high ranks. I am not saying its impossible to do dailys for low tier killers at high ranks, but what I am saying is that if you are planning on playing as low tier killers and expect to have a good time, then you are SOL.
---
It's not dumb when they're just passing by your area and have 0 reason to look in the locker but they do anyway and getcha.
---
Yeah I'm new here and already noticed. Literally every post I read he's trying to be a dick in the comments
---
I mean there are some things killers can do that I think people are justified to be upset about. Survivors too. But you're right, it is a little funny how  even a fair win will upset some people that badly.
---
Trapper: opens bear trap, curb-stomps survivor‚Äôs face into it.
---
I disagree. You can ‚Äúwin‚Äù and still be nice or care about other people‚Äôs experience. When you only care about yourself, it adds the toxic community we already have to deal with currently.
---
I basically creamed myself when I saw that and Myers‚Äô new stuff.
---
But a survivor will eventually get caught so your statement makes zero sense.
---
I don't know how you say that though.  He is very informative during his gameplay vids.  He routinely breaks down mindgames and strats as killer midplay and does the same as survivor teaching how to spot and run various tiles.  He gets a lot of shit on him because people don't like his complaints about balance but to say he isn't a good teacher doesn't seem accurate at all.  I learned a ton about playing killer from him over the years.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be nice, but it‚Äôs always an option. If people are being toxic to you, then sure, be toxic back. But being an ass just because you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have to be nice‚Äù only adds to the toxic community.
---
Noed is fine, do bones
---
Or Michale Myers pulling a T-pose then Slowly dabbing.
---
I always love those comments. Like dude, most of your friends died..
---
*laughs*
---
So whatchu doin', son?
---
Epic escape
---
Ridiculous but true
---
I don't see what's different about this escape.
---
But that‚Äôs true of anything that annoys survivors.
---
Anyone wanting emotes needs to see what it did to F13 The Game. No. Just please. No.
---
Yeah definitely. Hit the unhooker first and as they get their burst of speed away from you if the guy who just got off the hook is still around for some reason hit him then either rehook, curse borrowed time, or continue after the unhooker and leave that dude on the ground
---
Hell naw nightmare fuel
---
I personally don't like it. It's kinda boring
---
&gt;I didnt feel like arguing with you further so I dropped it.
---
I'd like to point out that it was a different person who started replying and being toxic.
---
I recognized that you would rather be done with the conversation and decided to leave it along.
---
I'm sorry someone else came along to give you hard time. :(
---
I have YT in my username because my username without it was taken. 
---
Imagine being so salty you look up some unknown's youtube to leave a salty comment on it
---
But the finger lick...
---
Nah - fuck all this.
---
That‚Äôs kinda the point. It‚Äôs existence means killers don‚Äôt tunnel or rush someone to death. Let‚Äôs survivors play the game and killers can spread out damage amongst the team
---
I just think you're taking your lost games too serious man. I'm telling it as a player who had a real lot of lost matches when playing killer.
---
Maybe XD
---
Still get to rank 1 as killer every match. It‚Äôs not raging, I just play the game to have fun and those things are the exact opposite of that so if rather avoid it all together. Simple as that
---
So I was Claudette going against a Spirit in The Game. Because of the rank reset, people were following me like flies. So 2 ended up dying pretty quickly. The last one ( a jane ) was searching a chest (near me) and I didn't see the spirit coming, but they downed her quick enough to be in the same room even though I had just healed her. I had also grabbed a purple key I found in the basement. So she found the hatch before me, so I hid near the exit till I saw her leaving. Spine Chill went off, so I hid by some pallets (unusable) She searched around, and came my way. I knew I was screwed if she kept looking, so I threw down a pallet right as she was there. Stun, and so I finished opening the door (It was about 3/4 done by the time she had come near) She came running down the other way, and I was gonna get grabbed if I kept going so I let go. Hit, not grabbed. Kept going. Door opened and I bolted. I made it just as I got downed into it.   
---
  
---
*However, just as I escaped, my game went to the loading screen.* Did she DC? *I had thought. No... luck doesnt work like that. It was worse. As the game closed, I got a notification saying,*   
---
You need an internet connection to run.  
---
*I was furious. My heart was racing, yet I didn't get any bloodpoints, nor the item*
---
Spirit just needs game sense to master her, and spirit isnt thee easiest killer to play she‚Äôs actually quite difficult.
---
Still get to rank 1 as killer every season. It‚Äôs not raging, I just play the game to have fun and those things are the exact opposite of that so I‚Äôd rather avoid it all together. Simple as that
---
U mean 72hrs?
---
When you‚Äôre spectating, it would be nice if you could hover over a player‚Äôs status effect icons and get an explanation of what they are. Would be helpful for new players.
---
More people would stop playing spirit if other killers were viable but bhvr solution is nerfing all viable killers rather then buffing the low tier ones so we see more diversity
---
Thrilling Tremors and Pop Goes the Weasel
---
Legion is a rank of his own.   
---
because he's actually pretty good if you play him with the right skill.  
---
It's just my opinion so dont slander me into oblivion if you disagree
---
I found him
---
Well, tbh ur right. I may had to put him a spot higher
---
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH ORMOND?
---
Exactly like if I the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù action helps me objectively I am going to take it. Like if the exit gates are open and I hooked a survivor there is no reason for me to not camp that hook because I know some one will come for that survivor and as soon as I leave some one will unhook that survivor and escape.  And exactly your point that if I know one survivor has been hooked twice and I can knock that player off the board by hooking again I will prioritize hitting that player over another.  I feel like some survivors just are making excuses to why they lost rather then I did this wrong and the killer took advantage
---
I mean, you have second wind so why not combo it with deliverance since both need to be used before being hooked twice.
---
I'm just joking about those guys who actually blamed me for WH when I was finding them in the lockers. Locker sound, Whispers, scratchmarks, blood, Killer Instinct, aura revealing perks, general sense, reloading hatchets - there are really a lot of reasons to open a locker sometimes. So in majority of cases it's a survivor's fault.
---
Well when you play enough dbd on console it's not hard to remember names and run into people a lot. Sometimes those people are asshats.  And sometimes whenever you meet them, a shitty match occurs. Anonymous names would easily fix the issue imo.
---
The taller the killer, the easier to see their head, so mindgames essentially for short walls. At the price of good vision. Meanwhile, short killers have a hard time seeing through corn, reeds, and grass, and the survivors can only go on based off red stains.
---
So naturally you're totally cool with every survivor DC against your loadouts too when you run moris or any addon they don't like correct?  I'm sure you fully support their DC's too no?
---
there's just a bandwagon going on atm along the lines of "everyone thought dedicated servers would fix everything but i, the genius starchild, knew it wouldnt. how foolish of everyone nyeheheh"
---
i think its hilarious
---
She's forced to M1 you rather than just push M2 and spray and pray around every loop
---
When did I say mine was justified? I literally just listed why I did, never thst it was totally okay because of my reasoning. Reading comprehension, my friend. Learn it
---
OR: I HAVE KINDRED, WHY THE FUCK ARE ALL THREE OF YOU STILL GOING TO SAVE ME????
---
Not in my christian murder sim.
---
My problem is needing map offerings for it.  I have mirrors, but I'm not too keen on trying it anywhere but lery's, the game, and hawkins lab.
---
Mature response from a low skilled survivor main. I think I've done my job here and will continue to expose the lies of low skilled survivor mains regarding the Spirit. 
---
And don't worry I am a constant rank 1 killer, and enjoy immensely destroying players such as yourself, as well as any SWF that dares oppose me.
---
I just like to give people big nods when they deserve it. Just last night I had a game as wraith where a survivor would endlessly camp the tractor area for balanced landing and would tbag every time so I left them alone, got the other three and closed the hatch on her face and finally got her on the hook and gave her a flurry of bells and nods. 
---
Same vein, I had a Ghostface game where one person did the same thing and by the time I had them on death hook I just got to tbag them back while I chased them and had them on hook.
---
I don't know what your experience has been like, but I cannot remember the last time a killer disconnected against me. Survivors seem to do it much more frequently. Sadly, until a penalty is introduced (besides depipping) people will just quit when they're not having fun, ruining it for 4 other players. I do really hope a punishment system comes in to play soon because as someone who has never quit a game regardless of how unfun it is, it is so frustrating seeing others quit and screw everyone else over.
---
Decisive strike
---
I feel you there bud. I keep bringing good items thinking it wont happen again, but it keeps happening, every damn game. The only items i can safely use are ones i find in game
---
Pig because of the whole ambushing thing, very fun scaring the new players in kyf as well!
---
I don‚Äôt understand that argument against moris. If you can kill a survivor only when they‚Äôre already dead, BHVR is putting cosmetics in the bloodweb that are sometimes unavoidable.
---
Moris are useful because they look cool and make your match easier. Hence, they cost a significant bp investment. If you can only kill them after 2 hooks, it‚Äôs just a cool ‚Äúkill cam‚Äù and is largely worthless. Furthermore, I don‚Äôt see anyone up in arms about devour hope, which can kill a survivor who hasn‚Äôt been hooked.
---
Moris aren‚Äôt fair and aren‚Äôt intended to be. If BHVR wanted to add a rare offering that allows an individual survivor to be impervious to a mori for a trial, I think that is fair. You are taking a gamble, and sacrificing an offering to do so.
---
It's been awhile since I've seen it, but I believe in *Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy*, Craven states that it was the studio's decision not to let Krueger be a child molester, but that it was intended that the audience would put two and two together and realize what he was doing to the kids he murdered.
---
NOBODY GAVE A SHIT ABOUT INSTAHEALS UNTIL EVERY OTHER POINT OF POWER WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM SURVIVORS. AFTER INSTAHEALS THEYLL MOVE ONTO SOMETHING ELSE.
---
Emotes for survivors? Ya really want that?
---
Check again...because I do, every time...unless the game hates me...I have been losing my items and sacrifice thingy...
---
Lol you said they dc for much less.  You are right there attempting to downplay their reasons while you backed up your own reason for doing it prior.  I possess reading comprehension.  Hypocrisy my friend, learn it.  You don't even need to own a dictionary anymore just Google the word.
---
Find a good spot to hide (near pallet or window if possible.) Disarm it, then go to hiding spot. If he comes your way you know the other exit gate is safe, or you can wait for him to leave again. He can‚Äôt be two places at once.
---
Right. I don't f I'm on a corn map, usually instant DC from me. It's already bad enough with the FPS drops that map has on console, but on top some killers like Wraith and Hag have some wonky animations (usually dealing with speeding up their actions) that make it hell to play.
---
This legit happens to me. I‚Äôll hit shit and shake my head no and they‚Äôll keep struggling so I sacrifice them. Then I‚Äôll say I was trying to give you hatch and they‚Äôre like if you wanted to give me hatch then you should have just let me go. But then if you do that they think they escaped cause if their skillüòÇ
---
Emotes for survivors. Rank 16 Claudette emotes at every dropped pallet.
---
I always wondered this... Which one gets used? The needle or the septic?
---
Thank you so much!
---
I've played base kit Michael a lot (cuz Spooktober) and it's honestly sad to me how much more fun base kit Ghostface is to play. 
---
GF's so much better at finding and surprising Survivors, doesn't have an awkwardly slow Tier 1 phase, and his Stalk isn't nearly as clunky to use (it also never runs out).
---
At least Michael has his really cool add-ons to make up for having the worse Stalk power. :c
---
Just burn everyone to the ground. 4K them. 4K them all.
---
He did unlock his. But his game save got deleted and he lost his legacy so he unlocked it to get it back.
---
Nevermind, I searched around a bit and found out it's a recent change that happened with the DS rework. Before that, there was 0 chance for anyone except the obsession perk user to be the obsession (if the Killer didn't have obsession perks/add-ons.)
---
Wah?
---
I‚Äôve legit come across survivors who DC because I hit them once as wraith but have fun busting a blood vessel over simple shit like this &lt;3
---
As much as I hate going against a good SWF the solution shouldn't be negatively impacting matchmaking, instead how about rewarding the Killer with some bonus post-trial bloodpoints instead.
---
2 Player SWF = 50% Bonus Bloodpoints Post-trial
---
3 Player SWF = 75% Bonus Bloodpoints Post-trial
---
4 Player SWF = 100% Bonus Bloodpoints Post-trial
---
So Killer would literally get up to a free Survivor Pudding for having to deal with SWF, doesn't that sound better than practically removing SWF
---
It should be said that if you cleanse in one corner of the map, you can force her to waste a ton of time to get the buff, and by the time she gets back it's half gone.
---
Especially at the end of the game.
---
Imagine loading into the game after a long que time to run into the killer in the first 20 seconds, get hooked then get followed by the killer after you get unhooked and this happens until you die, and you haven‚Äôt touched a gen for at least 10 seconds. This is coming from a killer main and is why I don‚Äôt tunnel.
---
I finally cracked the other day after spectating a teammate after I escaped. They literally just sat at the exit gate for almost the whole collapse timer tea bagging. The killer wasn‚Äôt even near. They just sat and danced. I don‚Äôt know why but it just broke something in me. Now I play however the fuck I want as killer. I‚Äôll tunnel and camp if I need to whereas before I would try to play without doing either.
---
And I've legit come across killers that dc'd because we popped 1 gen at the very start of the game.  DC's are equally pathetic and sad on both sides of the aisle.  You're both two sides of the same community ruining coin.  Grow up and finish your games or consider uninstalling for something more your competitive speed like Candy Crush.  At least you won't be here to ruin the game for others.
---
Ah okay, thank you for the recommendation
---
Is the experiment that baby is not capitalized? Because it bothers me more than it should
---
I mean, I‚Äôm not wrong, am I? With the exception of blendette, there really isn‚Äôt much difference
---
Not if you're good at looping. Seriously the game is 100% based on skill, if you're good you wont get caught dude.
---
&gt;WiFi cable
---
You have just described how multiplayer in Half-Life 1 used to work. It is (should be) much more complicated today.
---
Yeah, destroying with "skill" right? Probally Spirit main that thinks he got skill because he uses a Headset KEKW literally only thing you need to play spirit. at least Nurse takes some time and effort to play but hey its probally fun winning every game with no effort whatsoever, doing gods work LULW i hope i'll see you in the discussions in the near future you totally are just a clown.

Oh shit it is, I mixed up Bubba's for Billy's for some reason. I didn't know what to do for pig, so I tried make a nod to the Saw films.
---
I can‚Äôt believe a grown ass man is getting mad at a virtual game. Yikes...
---
Omggg the talent üòç
---
Only for the survivor unfortunately
---
Blood hut is always 2x bloodpoints
---
It just seems so fitting in the context of DBD. If you are a killer main, then it's even funnier.
---
What if after I disarm it and hide he just resets the trap...
---
Aka 360. We had that meme before. Also not funny didnt laugh
---
And killer still drops two people before you finish...
---
So? Hillbilly was inspired by Leatherface and Legion was inspired by Ghostface. We need Jason to eventually come to this game.
---
Once you hit devour 3 and start instadowning survivors, they will drop everything to search for the totem. It‚Äôs a bit like ruin too, in that it has a high probability to get cleansed before you can make any use of it. Even if you do get devour to 5 stacks, it requires more hooks to get a 4K than an ebony (5vs4) and requires you to basically let the survivor get away free from the hook because of the minimum range of 20 meters or something. Meaning you have to give up free hooks on rescuers or people who just got off without borrowed time. Devour hope is so situational and luck based, whereas an ebony is game changing every time it is used.
---
1) they don't know if you have NOED until you hit someone
---
2) Bloodwarden is beyond useless to anyone that knows what they're doing.
---
Spiritüòò
---
Haha, true, but I literally run those perks 24/7 since day 1.
---
It‚Äôll be about a month or two before you have to buy anything to get new content and also any character that isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúguest‚Äù or licensed character can be bought for 9000 iridescent shards (you get about 300 every time you level up and it takes about 8 games to level up, meaning you could buy a new character without having to pay money every 240 games you play)
---
This is true. When I started this game a couple years ago, D-Strike was the big OP perk that people abused. But it made no sense to rage at people for taking it instead of at BHVR for designing it.
---
Didn't they change it recently so that you can't hit the survivors on hook anymore, or was that a bug? I hit the hook and it made a wooden noise, so I then proceeded to hit the survivor, and it had collision similar to a wall
---
Dude if you hit the unhooked person and they have borrowed move on to a nearby target, unless their the only one in the area. I don‚Äôt mind DS, I‚Äôve only been playing four 3 months and have learned how to play around DS, just try not to tunnel unless needed the slug then to apply pressure.

Best survivors for new players:
---
Whoever you like based on archetype (teamworky Dwight, healer Claudette, athletic Meg, sneaky Nea, jack-of-all-trades Feng Min).
---
They should avoid Ace, David and Laurie, unless they appreciate challenge (or, of course, if they like those characters).
---
New players will be spending more time learning base mechanics, so they should pick whichever survivor they simply like the best.
---
Best Killers for new players:
---
The Wraith, Trapper and Doctor seem like simple introductions to basic special abilities with high movement speed.
---
The Nurse, Hag and Huntress seem like they would be more challenging, but confident players who like their character designs would do well to begin learning them earlier.
---
I think the best advice to give new players is to try *multiple characters.* You won't know what you really like until you try it and find how it works for you firsthand.
---
Only about 5 weeks of casual play, as long as you‚Äôre not dropping 2000 each week at the shrine
---
!Cursed!
---
Not saying anything, I just want a large variation of killers. If they were to create an original killer they would also have much more freedom over cosmetics ect
---
I usually found those at purple ranks imo. I always thought that this was the case because the margin for error in losing pips is so small at red ranks and we all know that toxic survivors throw games and dc a ton.
---
There are always gonna be new Meg players. When I introduce someone to the game I recommend her to them. She comes with an exhaustion perk (Sprint Burst), one of the best perks in the game (Adrenaline), and another viable meta perk (Quick and Quiet). My experience is that new players are often told to run Meg or Claudette, which is why you see so many Megs sprint bursting into walls, and so many Claudettes hiding in bushes.
---
"Welcome to DbD where everyone bitches and the points don't matter."
---
True, but I think the recent trend of licensed cosmetics shows they can start doing what they think best as they‚Äôve proven it‚Äôll earn money. 
---
That said I‚Äôm working on 64 fan chapters so If you want variation....:P
---
Is iron will any good? Seems a bit pointless to me but then again, I can barely hear anything as is.
---
Probably, there was a leak that revealed a Halloween themed banner that was about a blood hunt so probably gonna be from Halloween night until nov something
---
The really salty ones write on your steam wall and leave you the biggest baddest insult possible: "-rep"
---
NANI?!?!?!
---
The community is generally positive for the most part when it comes to the subreddit. I feel like a lot of the memes make fun of the toxicity in the community rather than making fun of Survivors or Killers all together. That's just how I've interpreted it, and I still love the memes.
---
It doesn't make me mad, and it's very sad that you feel the need/desire to make people mad "just cus"
---
I run Quick and quiet, boil over, lithe, light weight/hope
---
I mean, they still got four gens done, and the fifth was probably right around the corner. The entire match wasn't playng out like this, and I suspect it was pretty clutch towards the end, on a map the nurse is pretty disadvantaged on
---
If this had been the start of the game, they'd disconnect on the spot
---
Whoooa üòÆ wedding dress Nurse would actually be perfect!
---
No one leaves her just waiting at the alter...
---
*OCD twitch*
---
Still doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that bugs are often hard to find, and fix might break something else. So they have to make sure that a fix happens after they  actually find the cause of the bug.
---
Do you play on PS4? Let me tell you around rank reset 98% of the killers are all toxic pos who do some scummy shit, PS4 has some of the worst players in the DBD community and allot of little shit head kids to boot who don‚Äôt care. 
---
I try to be nice and play the game as designed, but when it‚Äôs straight shit for days on end because of the rank reset fuck that, I‚Äôm not here to waist my time to sit in the lobby‚Äôs and then be facecamped or tunneled into the ground or body blocked by the killer or survivors for 30 mins and waste a offering and item to just keep repeating it! 
---
I can normally get in 10-13 games in a evening and 1-2 might be normal and the rest are all shit! I love how you guys come along and say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù 
---
At least while I‚Äôm playing toxic strode I actually have fun and win more games. 
---
It‚Äôs BhVR‚Äôs fault and I blame them for letting everyone run around like it‚Äôs the fucking Wild West doing what they want and not caring about the Eula or just decent game play. BhVR doesn‚Äôt enforce shit and their reporting system is all bs hot air!
---
I really don't get why so many people complain about NOED. It's literally one of the easiest perks to counter since cleansing all 5 totems doesn't take too long, especially if each survivor does 1. You even get fricken 1k BPs for it!!
---
Now Ebony Mori's? Don't get me started on that shit.
---
TO THE DICKS WHO ACCUSED ME OF TUNNELING, MAYBE NEXT TIME DONT ALL WEAR THE SAME DAMN OUTFIT!!!
---
I get so many msgs after games! Lol
---
It literally mutes all of your Survivor's breathing, which is super good against the Spirit. Plus it means killers in general might have a harder time tracking you via sound.
---
Good plagues won't collect it so it's worth cleansing but worth noting it's limited, since her not collecting it means you cannot cleanse there.
---
To be fair, in a similiar situation I would knock you down, slug you, and then put chase to the one that unhooked you in the first place. That way three or more people are being forced off of generators.
---
Also if it was recently, it wasn't the Hag causing the lag. It was your internet. We're still on Dedicated Servers brahski.
---
Or just slug them to make other survivors have to stop doing gens to pick them up, so if you got a guy slugged who you believe has DS then you can stop 3 people from doing gens (ideally). 1: slugged, 2: healing the slugged, 3: you should be chasing the 3 rd
---
This is why DH tier 1 is dope. No one suspects shot until BoOm mori.
---
Fan chapters?  64 of them?? Hope to see some of them be implemented.
---
It‚Äôs very sad that you feel the need/desire to ruin others day by playing the killer. I know why killers play the killer it‚Äôs to boost their very low self esteem. However I have mad respect for a killer playing to have fun.
---
Hmmm
---
If you have NOED and don‚Äôt kill any, or kill one then you get shit talked too cuz ‚Äúop perk crutch n still trash‚Äù
---
Oh the killer just walked past basement, he obviously is going to kill me on the hook across the map.
---
I can give some basic answers for the killler side:
---
IMO The Cannibal and The Shape are the best killers for new players. Both of these killers' abilities are fairly simple/strong/easy to understand and gives out a fun gameplay experience. I didn't include the free killers because even they are free, most of them requires good killer knowledge. (For Example: The Trapper is fairly simple but to use traps efficiently is a whole new level.)
---
As in common sense, best killers in the game currently are The Spirit, The Hillbilly and additionally The Nightmare I would say. All of them have great mobility and within that good map pressure. Some would say The Nurse is dead after the nerf but I won't agree. She's still very strong on good hands.
---
Currently these are the best killer perks in the game:
---
Barbeque and Chili (BBQ): Standalone a reason to level up The Cannibal and get the teachable. Increases your Bloodpoint gain very much and highlights survivor auras within a distance when you hook someone. Bloodpoints and map knowledge: Both strong and good for beginners.
---
Hex: Ruin: Hag Perk. Arguably one of the most frustrating and strong perks in the game. As it really slows down the gen progression until someone finds the totem, like BBQ, both strong and good for new players. Definetly a reason to level up The Hag. A downside is that totem location is purely RNG, so you can get your totem destroyed within seconds or until the end of the game.
---
Enduring or Spirit Fury: The Hillbilly and The Spirit perk. I'm mentioning these together because both of these serves for the same purpose. Decreases the time spent on the pallet loops and even terminates them. Usually an essential for most of the M1 killer builds. Great perks.
---
There are many strong perks like NOED, Thanatophobia, Whispers, Discordance, Corrupt Intervention etc. but the four that i listed is above the situational level and just these four can make a standart and strong killer build.
---
You can save your shards for later killer purchases or something but if you wanna speed up your grind experience I would say that grab BBQ, Ruin, Discordance or Spirit Fury when you see them on the Shrine. Use the shrine for the DLC/Paid killer perks as you can level up the free killers anytime you want.
---
Wow that was a long list! Hope you have a good time slashing survivors!
---
No mither counters noed you baby David main
---
Not on console lol.
---
No one should level Ace unless you really love how he looks.  
---
2/3 of his perks do next to nothing and ace in the hole is cool and all but do you really have the time to loot chests every game?  
---
You'd be better off waiting for ace in the hole in the shrine
---
 Eww 6k4d6 xewk
---
The point of it is that she's hot, 'nuff said.
---
I got called a tunneler and a baby killer. All 4 survivors had DS and not one was used. 3 people DC'ed on their last down. I was rank 11 playing against rank 5 survivors.
---
New Effect: Panicked
---
Any slow action will become rushed such as vaulting and getting in a locker.
---
New Map: Freddy Fazbears Pizza
---
A children's restraunt corrupted by murder, greed, hauntings and now the entity. Just don't go into the kitchen... if you want to be seen again.
---
New Killer: The Fazbear
---
A childrens bear animatronic, haunted by a child murdered in the back room by a mysterious purple figure. The entity took them in to exact it's revenge upon more innocents.
---
Killer Power: A Gift
---
There are 3 large Gift Boxes strewn across the map which are all connected to a singular timer ticking down on the survivors screen. The timer will go from full to empty in a 90 seconds and can be wound back up by survivors at the Gift Boxes taking 30 seconds to go from empty to full. If the timer runs out, the Puppets theme will play at the last few seconds (similar to his death jingle in FNAF 2) and at the end every survivor will scream and gain the Exposed and Panicked status effects until they begin to wind the box back up.
---
Killer Perks:
---
Party Animal:
---
If the killer enters a chase with multiple survivors, the survivors will gain the exposed effect for 2/4/6 Seconds.
---
Intimidation:
---
Any survivors within 4/12/32 meters of the killer will gain the Panicked effect.
---
Performer:
---
When the game begins, all survivor auras will be revealed to the killer for 3/6 seconds and the killers aura is revealed for 6/3 seconds.
---
New Survivor: Mike Schmidt
---
A regular joe who tried to get a paycheck by nightguarding Freddy Fazbears Pizza when the night got hostile. It was his last night on the job when the lack of sleep caught up and he fell into a deep slumber whereas he then woke in a forest, by a campfire and The Entity.
---
Survivor Perks:
---
Walkie Talkie:
---
When you are hit, all other survivors can see the killers aura for 2/4/6 seconds.
---
Power Management:
---
If you are holding a flashlight and repairing a generator, consume 10%/5% battery a second while repairing the generator at a 5%/10% faster rate.
---
Light Bringer:
---
Consume flashlight battery 15%/20%/25% slower when blinding the killer but consume it 30%/25%/20% faster when missing.
---
Whoever *would* do animations is doing something else though.
---
The reddit is heavily killer sided, you cant really complain about much on the survivor side without having a shit ton of people call you out. That being said the amount of people i see hating on spirit is very promising.
---
You shouldnt really expect intelligence in game, so dont expect it out of game either
---
Iron Will with Urban Evasion during a chase -- OP, lol.
---
The forums are a dumpster fire and to be fair a decent chunk of the memes are funny. But it gets harder and harder to stay here with the same recycled matchmaking screenshots, baby dwight, toxic player bad and reposts of actually good content.
---
Maybe if we grow up knowing it should taste good and most people do it maybe our brain wil adjust  and find it tasty? Now we have the idea of that it tastes bad so our brain will treat it automatically bad.
---
This has happened a handful of times to me. It's really depressing to me cause I think from the killer perspective... "Like how?! I had my NOED for like 5 seconds!?"
---
it doesnt have the visual like unhooking, but the audio is very loud and easily noticable
---
How it should work is, if DS lasts for 10/15/20 seconds, if the survivor is in the killers terror radius, the timer is paused. If the survivor gets downed while the timer is still active, the timer pauses until picked up or healed.
---
This would make it so it only works if the killer is actually tunneling. If you are out of the killers terror radius for 20 seconds, there is no reason you should get caught again,
---
Lol WhY IsNt mY rAnT pOsT gEtTiNg UpVoTeS. Seriously? Its a rant post on reddit. The point is to vent my frustration. Yet here you are, the white knight of a game with more bugs than working mechanics.
---
I‚Äôve been having the same problem with toolbox‚Äôs, flashlights, medkits, some games I have everything and some games one or both add ons are gone... PS4 btw, if I escape or if the killer leaves, this has been going on since the stranger things chapter dropped...
---
I had this bug yesterday. If i remember correctly, after fixing one gen, gen number comes back.
---
On period
---
Same thing happened to me, but i was using scratched mirror myers on lerys. They got salty about scratched mirror, the lery's offering, and no ed that i didn't even use.
---
Well survivors have keys which can be annoying against the right team. I hate having all survivors on death hook then when I kill one hatch spawns and 3 escape, but this is so rare that it isn‚Äôt a problem and can be avoided if you haul them progression. Mori‚Äôs on the other hand.....
---
Sweet! I will be grinding out on Halloween if this is true!
---
F
---
I havent seen this post 8x before or anything!
---
Noed when the game launched was permanent one downs, I'd say it's perfectly balanced as it is now, there is even a perk thst rewards you for doing bones.
---
YES. 
---
But Ghostface is my new jam. Scratched mirror has strong limits and GF can do it without investing purple items and M&amp;A. 
---
But SM is my fav thing in the game. If only Lery‚Äôs offerings weren‚Äôt so rare.
---
YEA KILLERS ARE TOXIC AT THE SAME RATE AS SURVIVORS FOR ME. I THINK THE MOST VOCAL GROUP ON THIS SUB HAPPENS TO BE KILLER MAINS SO KILLER TOXICITY ISNT TALKED ABOUT IT AS MUCH BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EXPERIENCE IT UNLESS DOING IT THEMSELVES.
---
I had it happen once and it was glorious
---
ya it is, spirit fury+enduring is good on any m1 killer
---
Sick comment idiot. Maybe not being a douche could help out your karma a bit
---
What do you think the word "everyone" means? As far as I can tell there is a grande total of 3 or 4 people
---
lmfao
---
And sometimes I want to actually play a match and not bullshit 1 hit huntress.
---
I hate people who DC, but i understand when people DC against 1 hit huntress or omega blink nurse
---
Maybe in your fever dream fantasy
---
You actually can‚Äôt read cuz I literally stated in an earlier comment that I play to have fun and that me leaving isn‚Äôt me raging. But go off sis, don‚Äôt strain yourself over this random anger. üíã
---
Why not break lit totem when you find it? Whatever it is, it is not "+5% speed for Survivors".
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ditv3a/is_there_a_level_cap/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Myers always makes me paranoid. I run premonition and any time I hear the tier 2 jingle I‚Äôm like ‚Äúfuuuuck is he looking at me?‚Äù
---
It's reddit, the point is to discuss and share information.
---
And that's what I did. I pointed out issues with what you've recently stated "Shouldn't they have fixed bugs by now" etc.
---
I didn't realize saying that you were complaining like a small child would you set you off into the whole "white knight" name calling ranting and raving.
---
Anyway, it's fine to be upset at bugs. It's stupid to come at others with anger when they are giving you facts about why things take a long time.
---
I DID 2 GENS AND CLEANSED A HEX TOTEM IN THE FIRST 2 MINUTES. THE KILLER COULDN'T GET ANY DOWNS FIRST, SO HE DC'D AND I FUCKING PIPPED DOWN. FUCK THIS RANKING SYSTEM!!!!!!1!
---
I play to enjoy myself, I couldn‚Äôt care less about 2 pips, I‚Äôm just gonna earn them back next game.
---
Yeah man. Absolutely. That's why I generally don't run it.
---
I hate when my teammates dc it‚Äôs so stupid
---
I talk a lot and am on cam a lot, hopefully it picks up a bit. :) thank you
---
Okay, I‚Äôll rephrase most killers have low self esteem not all. I watch body language and just how they play it‚Äôs obvious to me. I don‚Äôt have evidence but trust me I can tell. I have a lot of self awareness, I know I have low self esteem. And guess what I don‚Äôt play the killer I don‚Äôt like hurting multiple people to make their day worse. And like I said I do like to hurt the killer by dcing, that‚Äôs only one person, if I dc it‚Äôs only cause I think he is gaining to much pleasure from hooking. I do not dc if I think the killer is just trying to have fun I reward them in chat after game.
---
&gt;  I don't tunnel or camp so who would've tought survivors are actually nice even if they die as long as
---
Doubt.
---
If you played killer for more than 10 games then you already know that SOMEONE will complain about SOMETHING no matter what you do, how you play or how often you donate to charity.
---
That's naaasty
---
i like to imagine that since michael is so evil the entity literally cant control him, he just fuckin tombstones any of the killers that try and mess with him
---
I guess it is is some situations
---
Y‚Äômean like how the bush I‚Äôm circling is keeping me safe from a guy with a got damn chainsaw?
---
People complain about it because it's requirements to make sure it doesn't activate are unrealistic for solo survivors, and it wins killers games that otherwise they should have lost. 
---
As a Solo Survivor, or even in a Duo Queue (Because I do both) you can cleanse every totem you see, and still get hit by NOED because youre randos weren't also cleansing totems. And the fact is, it's not really good to do something like cleanse totems to counter a perk that you don't even know the killer might have until end game. 
---
It's just a poorly designed perk. It punishes Survivors for being good at the game, and rewards killers for being bad. A game that should have maybe be a 1k tops can be turned into a 4k, and unless a Survivor is in a team, they can't do anything about it. (And remember, Teams get shit on constantly in this game for being 'OP'. I'm not going to argue if they are or aren't, because that's not my point.)
---
No. No emotes. I don‚Äôt want trapper to floss while I‚Äôm dying on the hook.
---
Went against a Burger King Myers on Coldwind Farm of all places last night. Three of us realized what he was doing and stopped doing the last gen and instead just ran to him and memed around a little bit. The fourth guy literally Brand New Parted the last gen and one of us went down cause we were basically giving him free hits and he happened to have NOED. Mikey proxy'd (because well, he's literally slower than the survivors even with NOED lol) but was pretty respectful to back up quite a bit and not facecamp. Even though we pretty easily got the save after trading a few hooks, this fourth survivor flamed the shit out of him in post-game chat. Talking about how he was a "dirty camper" who "can't get anyone without NOED" and shit. The amount of survivors who go full tryhard in this game even when the killer is just meming around trying to have fun is ridiculous. 
---
For the record, he knew the killer was BK Myers too. His first comment in postgame was about how he "ez 4ks when he runs this build".
---
A killer doesn‚Äôt need to know what the survivor is running to run the mori. But a survivor would need to know to actually get value. So more often than not, running the offering would just be wasting it. The suggestion is just as ridiculous as saying run a single perk or two every single trial just in case you get a killer that can be problematic to face if not wearing that particular perk. 7k also isn‚Äôt really that significant when killer side already makes loads more BP either. 
---
What‚Äôs so bad about it just being a flashy ‚Äúkill cam‚Äù? Survivors surely don‚Äôt have offerings they can tack on to make your match basically a lost game or a 1k. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not advocating it either. But I know you‚Äôre going to tell me about being the power role so I should have the option to just say ‚Äúhmmm I don‚Äôt like that they‚Äôre all carrying items, think I‚Äôll just bring a mori for an easy match‚Äù. Ebony mori is basically a waste of a match for survivors, unless the killer is actually just total trash.
---
And Devour is earned through tokens, not to mention has a range requirement so you can‚Äôt just hit someone off the hook to mori them, and you get a devour notification when exposed, so survivors can try looking for it to avoid it two tokens before they can be killed. So I don‚Äôt find the comparison valuable. Point being devour hope takes a perk slot, and has plenty of counterplay with its risk-reward, and isn‚Äôt a lost match when a killer plays it. Mori is a free slot as it‚Äôs an offering. It‚Äôs currently one of the worst feelings in the game to have a mori match while the killer is running ridiculous add-ons and strong perks to add to the oppressive force. It actually just feels like a waste of time, with little to gain BP. I say this as a guy who animates and thoroughly enjoys interesting mori animations.
---
Its a rant post. Not a come tell me im wrong post. Keep on scrolling if you arent here to share your frustration. Thats what rants are for. Thats what the rant post flair is for. Not for someone to come in a elevate frustrations for absolutely no reason. Give it a rest and let the angry people be angry
---
Aw dang I don‚Äôt got endurance
---
DCing is a 1 pip loss now.
---
I played COD:WWII and the next time I went outside i interned the Japanese
---
I don't understand why you think people play killer to ruin people's day. How are they ruining people's days? By hooking them? Which is to say, playing the game.
---
And what gives you the right to govern who much fun people are allowed to have?
---
&gt;billy and The Spirit perk. I'm mentioning these together because both
---
Thanks alot for advice. I'll try The Shape he seems more my type.
---
Nope, your player level caps at 100 but then you go into devotion 1 I believe and it keeps going like that. 50 is cap for characters but you can keep buying from the blood web without prestiging
---
Lol idk about you but I can't use Mikey boy in red ranks without being spit roasted lol, but I read you. It's just the blendettes
---
SCRATCH MARKS ARE EXTREMELY BROKEN THERE
---
‚ÄúCatch 3 survivors with a beartrap‚Äù. At of all the killers I have lv 50 you give me a daily with my only lv 1
---
-Sets down beartrap- Trap Gets Disabled, -sets down another- **TRAP GETS SABOTAGED** -sets downanother** **TRAP GETS SENT TO THE SHADOW REALM**
---
I CHANGED MY SETTINGS SO THAT PEOPLE CANT MESSAGE ME. EVERY TIME I FEEL BRAVE ENOUGH TO CHANGE THEM BACK, I‚ÄôM QUICKLY REMINDED WHY I CHANGED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
---
Yeah this. People forget all the time you'd waste looking for a match and only be finding 300 ping killers. Obviously haven't had that happen since servers.
---
On top of that, yeah stuff like this happens. More extreme stuff than when it happened on P2P, but honestly it doesn't happen that often. I've been hit like 20 feet away from a pig carrying someone, through a wall, but honestly like 95% of the time it's fine and they've only been getting better.
---
sorry chief, but not funny didnt laugh
---
It doesn't need a change tbh...
---
And maybe while they‚Äôre at it maybe make it look like the survivors actually got moried and didn‚Äôt just die of natural causes
---
It's seriously so bad when even on console, with no post game chat, they go to your profile private message you, just to tell you all the ways you did not play by the "Survivors Rulebook for Killers" even when you followed it to a T. I'm a player for both sides, so I can say survivors can be soooo entitled.
---
Before the recent perks that work great with head on + the other head on buff, I would agree, but now it would be too beneficial and easy to use.
---
Idk i feel like its kinda useless right now
---
Useless? No. Situational? Yes, but very good when it works
---
I can‚Äôt get on either. I would guess that it‚Äôs down
---
Oh shit. I'm so sorry! THINGS GOT SO HEATED OMG
---
Being killed is going to happen in this game, it's one of the core mechanics. And the Killers aren't intending to frustrate you by killing you, they're just trying to play the game.
---
Thank you for the link, very interesting. I do suggest that you yourself give another read though, if you're getting frustrated by the game then it seems to be impacting your mental state, so you should try to implement some of the techniques listed to keep yourself from putting too much emphasis on what happens in the game.
---
Same. :) These are the fun Myers.
---
This is why I hate ghostface, because his stalk has such long range and *for the love of god I can see him please I just want to reveal him*.
---
Your account ofcourse but me playing! I was well annoyed he trapped me in a corner with traps either exit lmfao
---
No issue for me atm...
---
I woulda just set a pumpkin on a bear trap, show those neighborhood punks what for
---
I'm not a dick on purpose man. This entire thing was me clapping back at people who cry about toxic killers but do toxic shit themselves. If you're cool, I'm cool. :) I got you.
---
How about instead of a new Chapter we get an update with brand new universal perks?
---
I agree its not completely usless but I just seem to never have a chance to use it
---
I always wondered  what flairs were, could someone explain them
---
Rank doesn't mean anything, play this game for BP and a game vs irid hatchets is a game where I get no BP
---
WHY DO SURVIVORS MESSAGE THE KILLER GG EZ WHEN THEY WERE ALL ON DEATH HOOK? WHY CANT THEY JUST SAY GG?
---
I am confusion

We had a similar post like this one but from the other side
---
I sense conspiracy
---
I always go for the rescuer. If the rescuer goes for the save while I'm still near, I'm going to assume that they know the risk they're putting themselves in.

Only thing is that spirits will definitely adapt and run stridor alot more now that everyone thinks nerf died(even though she didnt)
---
What Doctor skin?
---
excuse my shitty edit i couldn't find a good picture with all 3 of them so i just sorta plopped The Tyrant in there
---
As a killer main, it and Spine Chill are the actual bane of my existence. I'm so used to being able to track people by sound now that when I don't have those sounds I'll end up desperately searching around for where they're hiding while they fucked off like ten minutes ago
---
What happened to it?
---
I WAS SLUGGED WHILE KILLER MORIED MY LAST TEAMMATE, KILLER BROUGHT ME TO HATCH ONLY TO CLOSE IT IN MY FACE AND MORI ME, LIKE DAMN WAY TO BE A DICK. HE TRIED TO JUSTIFY IT BY SAYING IF I HAD ADRENALINE IT WOULDVE BEEN A DIFFERENT STORY LIKE EXCUSE ME??? JUST KILL ME ALREADY
---
ALSO FUCK YOU GAME FOR LOADING SHELTER WOODS OR ROTTEN FIELDS ANYTIME THE KILLER IS SPIRIT OR BILLY
---
If it doesn't happen for you, the problem doesn't exist... A way to stay positive, for sure
---
Try a wifi booster
---
/r/NothingEverHappens
---
A couple of times I wad hanging out and the killer just hit me over and over and over again and I wad just like.... Please. Stop. My poor ears.
---
And I'm not even toxic. AND I'm so bad at juking that any chase is over pretty fast. I do NOT get why someone would do that.
---
Are you using a wired connection?
---
The only issue I see is poor quality
---
Idk why getting hit through windows is still a thing.
---
It‚Äôs not like they specifically point out that they‚Äôre toxic.  The posts generalized survivors as a whole. That‚Äôs really not my main issue, I don‚Äôt take it too personally. The problem is when a concept is taken (toxic survivors are annoying) to the extreme and most of the content circulating in hot are unoriginal memes. This is the exact same thing with concepts like baby dwights, rank reset, crappy matchmaking, etc.
---
Ghostface stumbling on r/dbdgonegay
---
It's still a thing because ping exists, so there's not much that can really be done unfortunately
---
That's because survivors don't get half as much shit as killers do. Disagree with me if you want. But I play both sides, and I know for a fact playing killers gets you so much more hate and toxic abuse compared to playing survivor. I actually started off as a killer main hardcore. But adopted playing survivor into red ranks, and whilst I discovered tunnelling and camping to be incredibly frustrating, I never had any salt thrown my way when I juked, looped or escaped via DS or meta perks, it just doesn't happen as often.
---
This one post is totally gonna make it happen! Great thinking, cause secs listened to us about a chapter before, right?
---
Thank you, exactly, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt play this game. It‚Äôs just very fun. I will give it another read and adjust my emotions. I will try very hard not to dc any longer. Sorry if I frustrated you. Have a good one.
---
Yeah, the learning curve for survivor is pretty brutal at the start. I happened to pick survivor up more easily than killer myself, though, and dear god was I a fucking NPC potato.
---
Sorry for my shite grammar I was typing fast
---
Fr? I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs more spirits on there than everywhere else. Tbf when I played on Ps4 it was ‚ÄúOops! All Billy!‚Äù
---
Yes, sadly. And some of us should already be in the game. Why do the survivors have neutral  expression when hooked or being chased the killer? Survivors should be a lot more expressive than they are. There should also be a callout system like Deathgarden has. You can't tell me that in a world where you have to survive a psychotic  killer alongside three others that you guys wouldn't say a single word to each other.
---
That one has automatic shack basement so you can go off the stairs.
---
As opposed to Ironworks that has a hallway type basement staircase (but a bunch of other drops on the map).
---
You too! Glad we could come to an understanding.
---
Light Speed Dash and Quick Step are both extremely overpowered...and you should NOT be able to give other survivors exhaustion
---
It‚Äôs only tunneling if you *fail* to catch who you‚Äôre chasing. Tunneling is wasting time or resources on a hard target. In DBD, that would be chasing someone for 3-5 gens. This sounds more like the Killer caught someone after a moderate chase and sat on them them while the survivor‚Äôs teammates completed the other objectives. That‚Äôs camping. 
---
Don‚Äôt know why people are downvoting me. This is just semantics.
---
Yeah I feel bad when I do it, but hearing Steve screech like a little girl directly in my ears is just painful, I wish there was a way to say no hard feelings but teabagging is usually seen as toxic
---
This didn't age well.
---
Wow ur so quirky u like a garbage game haha this sucks and so does your creativity kid

THE GAMES TAKE 70 FUCKING YEARS TO LOAD INTO! AND BORROWED TIME IS FUCKING ANNOYING
---
What shitty behavior, standing at the gates? Dude. I think you're the one who lacks the empathy for another side.
---
That said, I think taunting like tbags and flashlight clicking is still dirty.
---
If you got hit while vaulting, there's no problem with that. It's not impossible for someone to swing through a window.
---
If you got hit after vaulting where you shouldn't have, that's just ping
---
Pretty much, ya
---
I wasn't COMPLETELY useless in that regard, I did a gen all by myself!!
---
But yeah, my baby ass wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for my teammates protecting me all game long.
---
(Plus that DC at the end for my survival)
---
Idk about Quentin and Adam I think steve would have more chance
---
We were saying the same thing, this was all just poor wording on my end, sorry about that lol
---
As for Detective's hunch, it does indeed work. I find it a slight bit overkill though, considering how much length it already covers in the first place. If you have 3 friends though, you can all run open handed to stack the increase up by 32 meters
---
 total instead of just 8
---
It felt nice to write it as well.
---
&gt; But basically he got me when I already completed the vault animation.
---
That doesn't matter if he was close enough to the window. Simply getting across the vault doesn't matter because devs intend for hits to go past it.
---
As I said, considering how close the Clown is to the window, you got legitimately hit
---
Pfft Dwight's are so last year. Nancy is the new queen of closet dontcha know?
---
Spooky bois
---
Meg and nea could probably fight too but honestly my bet is still on the guy with a knife vs any survivor with nothing.
---
Urban evasion usually gets paired with IW so they can just crouch walk away and on dark maps blood is basically impossible to see properly.
---
I‚Äôd switch Freddy to A and i‚Äôd say this is pretty accurate
---
This sounds like the same argument a few made about Enduring when many were saying it shouldn't affect non-pallet stuns...
---
They wouldn't have to change much. The text would just need to be that the skillcheck activates after being picked up off the ground, instead of put on shoudler. There wouldn't need to be a different animation, it wouldn't need to specify the exceptions. Just "When picked up off the ground."
---
As it is, people play hyper aggressive with ds, then jump in a locker the instant you move towards them, which feels gimmicky and uninteractive. You either eat it (whether you wanted to hook them again or just down them to stop gens), or let them escape. Having a survivor be untouchable for 60 seconds feels especially stupid if you hook 1 or 2 people, come back, down them, and they still have DS up.
---
Well I mean that happened last night but I guess sht happens and life goes on..
---
Yea that would be a damn cool chapter (don't mind the other comment he did the same on my post if you look at his other comments in his profile he's just a dick :) )
---
Jokes aside, can i get a build with those?
---
Lmao the best instant karma I've seen in this game was vs a Demogorgon with Rankour. A Nea was sitting at the God pallet teabagging and clicking her flashlight after running a pretty decent chase, I was waiting around the corner chilling and watching because my gen was inside the shack where they were looping. He comes around the corner and hits her through the pallet cause she dropped it late the microsecond that the last gen pops and she gets exposed. He just moris her while I just stood right behind them so I'd be in the animation too and he just slowly looks up at me then slowly turns around and walks away. I felt like [this guy](https://youtu.be/NSRr7wUjLxw?t=251) lmaooo
---
you sound like you're having a bad day and I'm sorry
---
I think their should be different Mories animations for each killer you know like the different executions in For Honor.
---
Is there any word from a developer that it isn't the way to play? Just wondering
---
Swf with quick and quiet and head on is amazing
---
?
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, once dedicated servers are live you won‚Äôt be able to play
---
this was negative for no reason. everything ok man?
---
The new pig blade looks similar to a legion knife blade.

I didn't have that much trouble with any other adepts, just David took me exactly 17 games... Can't say I did my best in them, so it's my fault mostly, but I was also trying to do this at rank 2 (where I don't think I belong) so I was matched against good players.
---
I love it when people message me on Xbox calling me a tunneler after i switch off them and onto their teammates then they run back towards me (usually Injured) and flash their flashlight then get downed with hardly a chase and then they dc sometimes
---
Clown is the ONLY exception in my opinion where the Spirit Fury + Enduring combo isn't that good. Due to the way Survivors react to his power, most of the time they drop the pallet early as to avoid risking the extra loop, so personally I feel Brutal Strength is better in most situations with Clown.
---
The problem isn't how close he was to the window. The problem is how far I was from the window. Also he was only that close to it because he was reloading and walked up to it.
---
When are they going to recognize that this is a design flaw?  BHVR needs to nerf Corrupt Purge.
---
Since when? I‚Äôve very rarely met a killer who just tunnels or camps for the fun of it, but playing killer you have to play so carefully to not anger the survivors. I‚Äôve been told that bamboozle, pop, thanatophobia, are all op along with about every add on I use. I mean the experience might differ in your view, but survivors will complain about practically everything if they lose
---
Thanks! I really loved the game and think it would be a good chapter :)
---
I understand now. Thanks my friend, and good luck to you too.
---
There's just something about seeing that "broken" effect at the start of the round.. makes you feel.. powerful.
---
A competitive team that‚Äôs smart and knows how to work well together will win a lot. Don‚Äôt sweat it bro
---
Adam would be very, very disappointed in them, and if their behavior continued he would have no choice but to write them a detention slip
---
I feel like it would be a bit finicky to make work but you could bodyblock pallets and stuff so that could be kinda strong maybe idk
---
While i think a lot of 'mind gaming' is overrated it sounds like you don't have any map awareness, switch rotation around a pallet can force the survivor back into a more barren area, or cost them precious seconds. and if you see you are going into a pallet heavy area with a decent looper unless you can get a first pallet easy just leave.
---
So many killers are really bad at switching targets, but people poorly communicate which pallets have been dropped and can likely force others into pallet barren areas.
---
&gt; AND PEOPLE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT INSTA HEALS UNTIL NOW,
---
THIS. THIS IS BLATANTLY FALSE. IT IS ACTUALLY FUCKING INSANE THAT YOU THINK PEOPLE ONLY RECENTLY BEGAN SAYING INSTAS NEEDED TO BE NERFED. PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS **ALWAYS** HAD A PROBLEM WITH THEM
---
&gt; AFTER A BUNCH OF THINGS WERE CHIPPED AWAY FROM SURVIVORS.
---
INFINITES, UNLIMITED SB, PALLET VACUUMS, INSTABLINDS, OLD BNP, ETC. WERE ALL BROKEN AS FUCK AND TAKING THEM OUT WAS NECESSARY. THEY DIDN'T CHIP AWAY AT SURVIVORS; THEY BALANCED THE FUCKING GAME
---
&gt; I GET THAT YOU WANT EASIER WINS, BUT TRY TO BE OBJECTIVE ABOUT WHAT IM SAYING.
---
I THINK SURVIVORS NEED A COUPLE BUFFS, LIKE REVERSING THE HEALING NERF AND INCREASED KILLER MISSED HIT COOLDOWNS
---
SORRY FOR BUSTING YOUR NARRATIVE. YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND THE "BIASED KILLER MAIN" WHINING
---
How is it supposed to work? These offerings seem weird
---
Again you probably can't tell a whole lot given there was a bit of context beforehand. Next time I'll just send a gif.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be a nice killer from now on.‚Äù
---
Cue next game the Claud squad with 4 clicks flashlights and gen rush on their mind. 
---
But the biggest thing I gotta disagree with is ‚Äúas killer the only thing you gotta worry about is DS and flashlight saves‚Äù.
---
Uh what. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 10 seconds into the game, has my ruin been found? How fast are they doing gens? Oh shit I haven‚Äôt seen anyone for 30 seconds are three gens about to pop? Did they see me set this trap? The last gen popped and I have no survivor on sight, I‚Äôm screwed‚Äù. 
---
Killer is stressful in the same way juggling babies is stressful.
---
God you sound so arrogant
---
Personally, my go-to build is Iron Will, Balanced Landing, Spine Chill and either Adrenaline or DS. I switch between those last two every now and then depending on how my games are ending up.
---
I can't even remember the last rank 1 game I've played, survivor or killer, that didn't have an obsession
---
Okay, thank you.
---
That shits funny. Nice work
---
So what you're telling me is that I should start running Urban, Iron and Spine chill lol.
---
I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre getting downvoted here. If you can loop well and the killer keeps chasing you, it‚Äôs really the killers fault that they would lose. Swf is strong, so the killer playing it has to play smarter and stronger if they want to win
---
DS makes one survivor at random the obsession. When DS is used that person takes the obsession.
---
I can relate very much.
---
they might rework them in the future and there are also people like myself who want to have every single perk in the game.
---
you can tunnel and get all stacks on devour hope tho‚Ä¶
---
Iron Will has been my crutch perk ever since they fixed it like 3 years ago. Never leave home without it...
---
Play jane and you'll eventually get pissed off that the killer can hear you from the otherside of the map.
---
Hmm, well we gotta see first what side is lacking in terms of perks are we talking killers or survivors.
---
Every new chapter adds 2 survivors which is 6 teachable perks for the survivors, 1 killer that has 3 teachable perks.
---
please don't reply multiple times to one comment 
---
what you described is fine
---
you're just salty you lost
---
Legion with Distressing, 3rd Seal, Sloppy, and Coulrophobia can be disgusting.
---
Fuck yes. I love the trapper but his mori is so damn boring
---
A lot of survivors blame tunneling on them just rushing the hook without bt, so I just usually down them and go after the unhooked. Probably not the most efficient way at doing it but I guess it wastes a bit of time for them and I have less of a chance to be called a tunneler
---
Mostly true, however only killer obsession perks and DS make a random survivor the obsession. Other obsession perks like OoO, Sole Survivor, and MoM make the person using those perks the obsession. Unless more than one person has one of those perks, then it randomly chooses between them.
---
Dwight&gt;every other survivor
---
Legion would lose the second he saw Quentin's face.
---
Ah so there it is. You're so used to dealing with other salty people that now you think every issue that gets addressed is because of salt. Even when I just told you the entirety of the situation, you're still gonna believe what you want. As I said, if you want to be that way you can leave. Literally no one is asking you to stay.
---
What do you mean?
---
The perk is designed to deter killers from tunneling one survivor and punish them if they do. A survivor that can actually last long enough in a chase for DS to fall off is still getting tunneled to death, yet the perk isn't punishing the killer for that because the survivor is good.
---
Perhaps
---
Badham maps are relatively small (I think?) and has a lot of pallets everywhere. Even when I tried to force them to a deadzone, they would go into school , drop into boiler (With BL), go upstairs, then pick an exit that has pallets (breaking LoS so I couldn't get bloodlust) or go to house + killer shack for windows.
---
I don't want to exaggerate so correct me if Im wrong.. but I think there were maybe 23 pallets in one of the Badham games? Even one of the survivors said he didn't blame me for not getting kills because of the rediculous amount of pallets that game.. a lot of the pallets werent easy to mindgame either... It was bloodlust or break.
---
Only cleanse if the fountain is in corner of the map and would make the killer waste time, bonus points if there is a completed gen nearby. Avoid cleansing near the gates especially near end game because it will make it easier for the killer to patrol.
---
Wraiths and trappers are LITERALLY THE SAME...
---
You know even if you are on the other side of a window or fence like in haddonfield the killer can still hit you.
---
Ghost face. Very strong killer with fun builds you can put together
---
you do realize its satirical right?
---
Ghostface!!!!
---
Admittedly I was gonna leave because his ping was unstable but I decided to give it a chance anyway because it took me a while to even find that game.
---
I know and that‚Äôs what I did but it just wasn‚Äôt working out. Plus at the end of the game when all but one survivor escaped this bitch with the flashlight was a rank 1 and keep in mind I was playing with rank 10-13
---
&gt;who used all the goddamn pallets?
---
Me as a noble green rank when playing with my brown/yellow rank friends in SWF.
---
They are literally the EXACT same... not a single framed difference
---
You're suppose to be able to get hit through the window.
---
Good to know
---
Thank you someone that understands if I'm killer and getting looped no point in wasteing time they are gen rushing you then so screw that one person just have to stop the people on gens and maybe later on in the match you will get them
---
Thats why you use it with bubba or billy can insta down without it but makes loops easier once you have stacks.
---
I just play Tap and pretend u_u
---
Think Mathieu said in an interview that the killers do have memories of their lives before coming to the entity's realm
---
Killer has 2 choices around DS
---
1. Eat the DS in a high pressure situation (middle of nowhere, all injured, etc) losing pressure but removing it from the game to be used in a more damaging effect.
---
2. Ignoring it in a low pressure situation (all survivors healthy, no other slugs/hooked survivors), letting the survivor(s) use it in a less time intensive situation. Continue on and use the slug to bait for a heal or use as pressure to temporarily remove someone (or 2/3/4 depending on team altruism) from the game
---
Also the earlier you eat DS the lower the risk of losing kills
---
You can't hit them on the hook anymore.
---
This is also nonsense, because hitting survivors on the hook just the closest thing to a high five you can get.
---
I know your comment is satire, I‚Äôm just tired of the ‚Äúsurvivor bad, killer good‚Äù circle jerk, and this seems like the only comment that realizes it is now a circle jerk. Sorry, had to vent somewhere
---
They‚Äôre coming out with their own asymmetrical survival game called project resistance, so probably not.
---
No.
---
All the killers act like they treat baby Dwight's so nicely, and you know what? I call BS. I played as a baby level 1 Dwight for a daily and got tunnel'd every match, it took forever to complete the challenge because I had to escape as Dwight lmao. It was literally as if as soon as the killer saw me as baby Dwight they focused solely on me
---
Ghostface or plague
---
AH OKAY, SORRY FOR BEING SKEPTICAL THEN!
---
You forgot gen slowdown freddy
---
&gt; Even when I just told you the entirety of the situation
---
you are not a reliable narrator
---
Better get popping on those gens...also I really want to see whT happens when demo steps into a trap
---
no
---
Ohhh yeah that's a different kind of internet than was most people have. It's called DSL Internet. Most people twist a coaxial cable into the wall and then their router. They probably thought you were calling an ethernet cable a wifi cable.
---
Tried plague on a friends account didn't like her
---
I don't think it's worth it. I never run it and do fine.
---
I only see 1...
---
Why does it say the host disconnected if you're clearly still in lobby
---
Thats why Laurie is the best character , you dont have to play ds and they will slug you for 1 minute every time lol
---
Streetwise is great.its always nice having your items last longer.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs fucking annoying as is and doesn‚Äôt need a buff
---
That's totally fine but my issue is distance. I was already kinda far from the window (maybe 5-6ft) yet I was still hit. If I was 1-4ft away then hey that's cool. But c'mon.
---
Tenancy and Unbreacable
---
(gulies theme starts playing.)
---
That's because there are four Survivors.
---
Brand New Part would get rid of 1/5th of the Survivors Objectives for 7000 BP.... But you could run four of them.
---
People really need to understand that Survivors need to be weaker because a Killer runs into 4x the whatever.
---
Also, a Mori takes out 1/6th of a Killers objective, not 1/3rd. You need 12 hooks to win.
---
Dance with me or Quick and Quiet synergize well with Iron Will because you get the most out of that perk when trying to break line of sight during a chase and vanish into a bush or locker, especially if you'd be willing to swap out self care for lithe and bring a medkit instead. If you never want to be found in the first place though? Spine Chill, especially on Hawkins, Lery's, or The Game, where line of sight on the killer's approach can be really limited.
---
I know this is would never happen for ten thousand reasons, but damn do I wish it could.
---
No terror radius, just those footsteps getting closer. Its too perfect. I would nope away as quick as I do in RE2.
---
Have a nice day
---
The window isnt a solid barrier. You could lunge through an open window pretty far and still make contact. People assume that hitting the vault button makes them invincible, but if you cant get out of his arm length before the hitboxes collide, then that's that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
&gt;I THINK SURVIVORS NEED A COUPLE BUFFS, LIKE REVERSING THE HEALING NERF AND INCREASED KILLER MISSED HIT COOLDOWNS.
---
REAL CONVENIENT THAT YOU LEAVE THIS OUT OF YOUR LIST OF THINGS CHIPPING AWAY AT SURVIVORS, LIKE ITS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
---
IT ABSOLUTELY WASNT TALKED ABOUT AS FREQUENTLY AS IT IS NOW. YOU DIDNT BURST SHIT.
---
&gt;YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND THE "BIASED KILLER MAIN" WHINING
---
YET HERE YOU ARE, A CRYING KILLER MAIN THAT CANT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOMETHING YOU YOURSELF ADMIT WAS TOO MUCH OF A NERF WASNT CHIPPING AWAY AT SURVIVORS. YOURE NOT EVEN CONSISTENT WITH YOUR OWN THOUGHTS LOL. THIS IS *LITERALLY* THE DEFINITION OF DELUSIONAL.
---
Just make them all patrol around a generator each for a easy 3 gen strat
---
OP said the timer pause punishes the survivor. It doesn't
---
Survivor:
---
I always advise starting with David if you're prepared to buy a dlc.  Dead Hard is one of the best perks in the game and WGLF can really reduce the grind and make playing survivor much more rewarding (just don't start farming your team). Just ignore No Mither. 
---
Laurie is a decent choice too because Decisive Strike is probably the strongest survivor perk, and you'll probably need it a lot while you're at low ranks because that's where the bad killers are and bad killers often tunnel and/or camp, Decisive Strike punishes them for that. Just don't use Object of Obsession when you're still learning, it's a very tricky perk to master. 
---
If you don't want to buy DLC I'd recommend starting with Meg. Adrenaline and Quick &amp; Quiet are both very useful perks. Sprint Burst is the worst exhaustion perk but is better than having no exhaustion perk. If you're on console you'll also have Nea and Feng Min available for free (I can't remember if Nea is free on PC), and they are two more good starting survivors. Nea has Balanced Landing, which is one of the two best exhaustion perks (Dead Hard from David, which I've already mentioned is the other, it's debatable which one is the best), Urban Evasion can be useful but is often used by bad players. Feng Min has Lithe, which is my favourite exhaustion perk. It's not as good as Dead Hard or Balanced Landing but it's easier to make use of when you're new to the game, plus I like to combine it with Dance With Me (a very underrated Kate perk). She also has Technician which can be useful to new players if you're not very good at hitting skill checks. Alert can be handy too for information on where the killer is. 
---
Other decent perks: Iron Will from Jake, Borrowed Time from Bill, We'll Make It (this perk is immediately available for every survivor, it's one of the only good perks you don't need to unlock), Dance With Me, Head on from Jane, Inner Strength from Nancy.
---
Once you have every teachable perk unlocked (this takes a very, very, veeery long time) it doesn't really matter which survivor you use. They're just skins.  Ace is arguably the best because he is the quietest survivor in terms of his footsteps and breathing (and he's just a cool guy). Male survivors tend to make slightly less noise but are a bit larger so harder to hide.
---
Killer:
---
If you're prepared to buy DLC, get Leatherface first. He's not very good or fun, but he has a perk called Barbecue &amp; Chilli which can easily double your bloodpoints every game, which makes levelling characters much quicker. The best killers are Nurse and Spirit. The easiest killers to start with are Trapper, Wraith and Doctor, but they're not very good against good survivors. 
---
In terms of perks, you'll want Brutal Strength from Trapper, Enduring from Hillbilly, Nurse's Calling from Nurse, Hex: Ruin from Hag, Monitor &amp; Abuse from Doctor, Dying Light from Myers, Surveillance from Pig, Bamboozle and PGTW from Clown, Spirit Fury and Hex: Haunted Grounds from Spirit, Discordance from Legion, Corrupt Intervention, Infectious Fright and Dark Devotion from Plague (Dark Devotion is good for Myers and GhostFace, Infectious Fright is also good for Myers). 
---
All this can seem a bit daunting, but to be honest, you don't need a top build for killer until you reach purple/red ranks depending on the killer you use. You don't need a top survivor build even at rank 1. Obviously you will do better more often with a better build, but just have fun (ideally without preventing anyone else in the game from having fun). I only have one survivor with every perk maxed out (well, I haven't levelled him to get the Nancy/Steve perks yet because I'm still levelling Steve at the moment) and the rest of my characters I just make the best build I can with the perks I've got by the time I hit level 50 with them. I don't have any killers with every perk maxed out but I get by just fine at red ranks.

Yes it will please the majority of the community its insane and fuck the people that say 2 clowns we got 1 unlicensed hillbilly and 1 licensed so stfu
---
PENNYWISE HYPE
---
You as well.
---
That‚Äôs your preparation
---
Yeah originally he had an old flip phone but since his character is known for recording himself then putting the footage out for people to see, and he‚Äôs not the same ghostface that likes to call his victims before hand
---
because Pig has 2 good perks, Tapp also has decent ones (Detective's Hunch just got buffed being more viable) + i wanna see more Pigs in my games, she's so underrated, yet a fun killer to play and face
---
What‚Äôs the prize?
---
and older killers own personal chase music
---
thanks, i always go overboard with glowing effects so i tried my best to keep it reasonable ahaha
---
&gt;DON'T ACT LIKE YOU WEREN'T COMPLAINING ABOUT INSTABLINDS AND PALLET VACUUMS. THOSE ARE INHERENTLY DIFFERENT THAN THINGS LIKE HEALING SPEED
---
QUOTE ME THEN. THIS IS YOU, ONCE AGAIN, BEING DELUSIONAL.
---
&gt;YES IT WAS YOU WORTHLESS FUCKER
---
AWW, YOU GONNA SHIT YOUR DIAPER? I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO WHINE BECAUSE OF SOME "WHINING KILLER MAIN" THING YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID. YOU CALL PEOPLE NAMES WHEN THEY DISAGREE WITH YOU. THIS IS THE BEHAVIOUR OF A TODDLER. ID BE WILLING TO BET YOUR POST GAME CHATS DONT LOOK MUCH BETTER.
---
&gt;OH GOD YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF BEING REASONABLE FUCKING LOL LITERAL FUCKINGIDIOT
---
YIKES. ANOTHER TANTRUM. HOW UNTOXIC OF YOU.
---
I'M NOT HIDING BEHIND SHIT. YOU FREAKED OUT AT MY FIRST COMMENT AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT WHINING KILLER MAINS, THEN PROCEEDED TO WHINE FOR 3 COMMENTS. YOU'RE CLEARLY UNABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION WITHOUT RESORTING TO NAME CALLING, AND IT'S EMBARASSING LOL.
---
KEEP BEING DELUSIONAL, I DONT REALLY CARE.
---
I said it currently does.
---
i doubt it. this would mean the entire losers club would need to be in it.
---
Block them. You won't get a match with them again.
---
I kind wish someone would do this type of tier list but with the killers laugh or sounds they make
---
That didn't go how I thought it would
---
Hmm well perhaps
---
Ha! Very funny and original! So cool n quirky dude there‚Äôs the attention  u wanted.

---
When you see that your ruin spawned next to a gen on the other side of the map.
---
Isnt that a problem with the survivor party then?
---
Prisioner dilemma, they either all support each other and power through while afflicted or one of them turns tail and screws them all.
---
I wouldnt go as far to call them that lol i understand ur rant but they arent really hypocrites just bc they said they are using something before a nerf, its pretty understandable of them tbf.
---
they use random BHVR employees as VAs it shouldnt even be expensive
---
Yes, but to get the update you must pay 8.99$.  
---
Although, if they rework the system a bit they could add in new customizable moris.  
---
Then they can charge for new mori animations, which won't affect game balance in any way and would be 100% optional.  
---
They could even add in free moris for special events for certain killers like they do with skins.
---
Take it easy its just a meme
---
The same thing goes for genrushing then, right?
---
I guess you right but it's been rough today
---
Legion makes killing fun for me
---
Ik demogorgon is so cute
---
holy moly you did an incredible job on this!
---
THE GATES ARE OPEN AND I HAVE TWO SURVIVORS HOOKED IN THE BASEMENT AND NOW YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO CALL ME A COWARD FOR NOT LEAVING THE BASEMENT?  IF YOU WERE SMART YOU‚ÄôD GET GONE AND LEAVE THESE TWO TO DIE BUT NO YOU GOTTA COME INTO THE BASEMENT TO DIE TOO.

Many thanks

How many kagels do you do fit a stick that large that far up your ass?

I understand lol if u have it bring franklins ive been maining that perk due to insta heals and fast toolboxes lol it really helps alot if not idk what advice to give you so sorry but good luck getting fair games :)

Jane has the best voice, she literally sounds like she‚Äôs moaning every time she gets hit.

Thanks

I watch him too but imo he's way to immersed and 'scared' wastes to much time in lockers
---
For some reason, green rank survivors thinks Ruins = ‚ÄúDo not touch any gens. Instead, run 5 laps around the map looking for Ruin.‚Äù
---
Ruin is needed with how fast gens get done especially on weaker killers or killers who need early game set up like trapper or hag.
---
I'm not going to use my mories before they get nerfed. Why would I use something I don't use anyway just because they're going to be gone?
---
YES BALANCED LANDING LETS SUCKING GOOO
---
Haha once at the end of a game I placed the max amount of phantasm traps around a hooked survivor and when someone came to unhook him it lagged out the game so hard. Wasn‚Äôt expecting it at all
---
There are glitches, and if anybody found a way to do it intentionally, I'm pretty sure it's be a bannable offence.
---
Oh also is the pig better than goast face? (I mainly play killers)
---
spirit fury isn't free
---
I still dont get why many people dont play wraith. This tier list obviously shows that wraith is the only viable killer.
---
can you make this bruh larger?
---
KILLERS THAT DISCONNECT BECAUSE THINGS ARE NOT GOING YOUR WAY: STOP. I DONT CARE IF THERE ARE TOXIC SURVIVORS PLAYING. DONT LET ONE BAD EGG RUIN THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. YER JUST WASTING TIME. YA NEVER KNOW IF YOU CAN GET A KILL AT THE END IF YOU DISCONNECT
---
Standing at the gates is shitty behavior if you‚Äôre holding the game hostage instead of just leaving.  You‚Äôve already won, you‚Äôre just prolonging the game because you have the power to do so, that‚Äôs all it is.  And yes, that‚Äôs shitty behavior.  Move on and let the killer move on.
---
Yeah people like to act like it's every single game, but in reality it's more like once a day.
---
That's right. That's me baby.
---
Change the letter C to the letter F and i agree
---
I get downvoted for speaking my peace when it‚Äôs true, I don‚Äôt run ruin and I can easily get a 3k or even a 4K.
---
I main ghost face, spirit and Freddy and do just fine without ruin, even at higher ranks.

Actually Lol‚Äôd irl nice

Comparing noed to ds? One literally prevents tunneling. Dont like getting ds‚Äôed? Dont tunnel

They should not be weak because they have their powers enhanced by a literal elder god

Meh. Surveillance is neat but I don‚Äôt run any of them.

Then again I don‚Äôt run any Ghostface perks I just like his killer ability.
---
That makes so much sence! Thank you!!
---
Lol, some salty ass survivor downvoting every comment. Nice.
---
I‚Äôve actually been quite lucky in this community so far. Apart from a few survivors being assholes to me while I‚Äôm playing killer (I‚Äôm not a good killer), I‚Äôve generally had a pleasant experience.
---
CHEERS, WAS A FUN RAGE THREAD. HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT TIME.
---
I am no dev, and know nothing about how complicated that would be, but I think that would be too perfect and in theme with The Tyrant.
---
Off the cuff, I would say that should be one of his two powers. He can break through any walls to stop loops, maybe with a healthy cooldown. Just have the entity repair it after he goes through so it can't be abused too much. You can even have the entity take longer to seal it back up depending on what addons you have. 
---
I still know it won't be done, but it would be such a brilliant collab. That Mr. X inevitability is perfect for DBD.
---
Also the mori should be the face crush with one eyeball popping.
---
Well..im not sure actually. Maybe you can grab survivors whole they are unhooking another survivor because... They are on their tip toes and easier to "grab"? Honestly I don't know at this point. The game make no sense some times
---
I'm not even going to be reading thar block of text.
---
Sorry in advance for the annoying but where i span around, it was my way of saying were all good and then can go
---
Just play Plague, can‚Äôt heal if you‚Äôre broken.
---
Ghostface is one of the strongest killers definitely A tier atleast
---
Hmm :/
---
There‚Äôs no precedent to believe they would need to use the whole club.
---
&gt; Isnt that a problem with the survivor party then?
---
No, it's a problem with the Plague's power on a conceptual level.  If people are deliberately hamstringing themselves for the entire match because half of the killer's power is so deeply unfun that it must be avoided at all costs, that's not an issue with how survivors are playing.
---
All it would take is making it so that using Corrupt Purge also decreases the length of the power every time it's used.
---
Thanks! Thats pretty close to my build! I use Ruin, Tremors, Pop, and Surge or brutal strength the thing i love about myers is his versatility in builds!
---
I cant wait for the new buffs to stealth killers with undetectable status effect, wont have to worry about moniter to make his tier 1 have a zero terror radius and in tier 2 he already has a small terror radius so yeah! 
---
Itll be cool to have a built in moniter and abuse for tier 1 :) how are your feelings on that change and whatcha think on my build im also a purple and red rank michael.
---
If you are running OoO, you are asking to be tunneled. Don't be surprised when you die first hook cause you got camped.
---
FIX THE DAMN DAILY SETTINGS ON THE SWITCH!!! I LOAD INTO THE GAME AND GET A NEW DAILY -  GET 4 BLINK HITS WITHE THE NURSE. I DON‚ÄôT PLAY KILLER OFTEN, SO I DELETE IT AND IT GETS REPLACED WITH ‚ÄúPERFORM COOP ACTIONS FOR 180SEC.‚Äù SURE, I CAN DO THAT. START READYING MY SURVIVOR, CHECK DAILY AGAIN TO MAKE SURE IT IS STILL THERE (BECAUSE IT LIKES TO CHANGE), SEE THAT IT HAS CHANGED - HEAL 3 HEALTH STATES. SURE. LOAD INTO GAME, COMPLETE ACTIONS FOR DAILY, FINISH GAME, NO DAILY? CHECK AGAIN, IT HAS CHANGED - SABO 2 HOOKS. OKAY. LOAD IN, DO THE THING, FINISH GAME AND IT CHANGED AGAIN! BACK TO HEALING. PLAY GAME, DO THE THING, FINISH GAME TO SEE IT CHANGED AGAIN!!! LEAVE GAME TO DESTRESS.
---
NOTHING IS WORSE THAN BAD TECH. FIX YOUR GODDAMN GAME!!!!!

Pro tip: if you can hop into a locker before a killer downs you, do it. Huge plus if you have inner strength

---
Not sure about where to find info but on pc, half the games r dedicated servers and half ain‚Äôt üòÇ it‚Äôs easy to tell as the killer but not 100% sure how to tell as survivor
---
I've been getting picked up as the last gen finishes and the killer drops me to trigger my adrenaline then immediately downs me again. Equally annoying.
---
Console killers OMEGALUL
---
I read somewhere that it doesn‚Äôt work with Kindered but don‚Äôt quote me on that
---
I recommend a wired connection if possible, using an Ethernet should make things much better.
---
But you no longer host the game. Dedicated servers are live
---
Yeah same honestly, I‚Äôve only had a fee experience with toxic players and as a survivor main I definitely feel more targeted while playing killer but I feel like that‚Äôs because your on a team alone if that makes sense? But I do play on console which means there‚Äôs no endgame chat so less chance to be toxic I guess
---
A decent spirit build is something like BBQ, Ruin (standard perks), Sloppy, M&amp;A, Nurses ect
---
I myself run BBQ, Ruin, Nurses and M&amp;A.
---
Relying on Addons is not a good idea if you want to improve as killer.
---
Your around the pole move almost got you killed by EGT
---
Well done. Baited him into thinking you were messing around lol

Hahahahah
---
Is this list easiest to play against?

But I DO want to hard bass as Huntress

No we had a terrible history of killers abusing the chase mechanics in the game

Finally the game is balanced

---
Same dude, I'm also new
---
Blessing not a curse. Trust.
---
In before the "walking dead is shit now" but in all seriousness he would actually be a good killer. Good luck getting the license tho.
---
I've gotten it to work before, you just need to always be ready for it to light up, and the second you see it go off and if you have fast reflexes, immediately begin to teleport to the generator Tinkerer went off on (that is of course if you have it fully charged up). Plus even if you know you won't teleport to it in time, some survivors can still notice the blood coming from the gens when Freddy begins to channel his teleport ability and think he's teleporting when really he could be using it for a mindgame and run away before they get to finish it (or you could even mean to be teleporting and they could still run away anyways). Tinkerer can be a pretty helpful perk when you get it to work.
---
It takes around 3 seconds to pick up a survivor and 1 second~ to blind the killer, so it probably would have gotten the save
---
Now that I look into it, DBD wiki claims it caps at 24, even though it's added that it's unknown wether this is intentional or not. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, I'll add it to the post
---
why does everyone say ash is groovy? i genuinely don't understand
---
Ye don't think it would ever happen but he would be awesome
---
Yeah, like there‚Äôs more pressure on you as a killer. The only killer I‚Äôm really good at is the Wraith, so if I play anyone else they‚Äôre pretty much guaranteed a win. Some survivors get pretty toxic though about it, and I don‚Äôt know why? I‚Äôve really only played with one toxic survivor though, and at least that guy had the decency to let the lobby know he was going to throw the match before baiting the killer over to me.
---
I hate the playstyle bubba attracts.
---
Hawkin labs should definitely be in no
---
Do you get notifications when someone comments on your profile? I think I'd better go check mine lol.
---
probably the part when it says "someone is holding a gun to your head"
---
I actually was since I didn't think I and a chance to get either of them, and then I realized I could still stalk and spin :p kinda feel bad NGL, but also you play stupid games, you get stupid prizes.
---
I totally agree that killers need to be substantially stronger than survivors to have a chance in the 4v1 situation presented in this game, and I‚Äôm a killer main and I‚Äôm decidedly killer-sided in most debates.
---
But moris have way too much impact on the game right now.  Even an ivory mori is absurdly powerful and gives you a huge advantage over the survivors.  An ebony is just an instant win.  Better map design and fixing hit registration issues (oh god, the Billy ghost saw) is how killers can achieve the power role.  Killers having a literal cheat code to get survivors out of the game faster is unbalanced, unfair, and not fun to play against.
---
Hmmm, I wonder which they would be willing to do.
---
1. Spend time/resources on overall making the game better for users with no income to them, or
---
2. Make a new paid DLC chapter, which they make money from.
---
Hmmm...

thank you!
---
Tbh I'm a new player and I wanna know why u don't cleanse...
---
Wish They would buff DS where the timer stops for the next 3 mins if the killer decides to slug and leave you there. If you get healed up be a survivor it starts ticking down again. That would stoop all that bs, forcing the killer to either pick you up and take the hit or waste his time even more.
---
Thanks~

If I knew how to make good SFM pictures, I'd make a picture of Bill beating up the Legion and title it "Boomer beats Millennial"

Had a huntress game me being killer and 60ms first encounter was a nea mid game neas pc is taking a shit i go and down her from teabagging at a window on pale rose 3rd time nea gets downed goes and dcs then in end game chat calls me a tunneler and trash
---
I've learned from high rank survivors that you are not supposed to purify yourself, as that gives the killer one shot vomit. So I try not to, but it seems like I'm the only one of the few who do that. Of course might be because I'm not playing at rank 1.
---
Set your survivor sens to 100 and its braindead easy.
---
I‚Äôm a good player, I often run ds and adrenaline, so a killer trying to tunnel me is basically always a win for my team, so I‚Äôm always fine with it. 
---
I still have a problem with tunneling in general, it‚Äôs an annoying ‚Äùstrategy‚Äù especially when most of the playerbase are casuals. For example, some weeks ago a friend gave this game another chance and came to play, and we were faced with a spirit, who found him very early and proceeded to proxy camp and tunnel him making his game end pretty quickly. Guess if he‚Äôs excited to keep playing? Such fun and welcoming for new players.
---
Same goes for survivors. They shouldn‚Äôt be toxic dickheads to killers since that‚Äôs only gonna make the playerbase smaller.
---

---
I can feel the anger of survivors, because it's such a bullsh... lol xd
---
The killer can get to the fountain you cleansed from which makes her able to one shot with her vomit, it becomes red, instead of regular green. That's why. It's like a long range one shot ability, which is pretty OP, if not annoying to deal with.
---
Tbf the demo probly only did that because with the dcs there wasnt a way he was gonna get to pip :/ the devs reward dcing survivors more then punish
---
As a killer main I actually wholeheartedly agree with you, I could deal with every toxic swf if I got extra BP towards more perks and add-ons and just go on with my day tbh
---
You deserve more up votes 
---
I would give you a metal but I can't sorry
---
It does. Like u/extracrispyletuce said it affects the following:
---
* Unhooking yourself from a hook
---
* Freeing yourself from the hook
---
It apparently **doesn't** increase the odds of finding a good item in a chest as stated by the Dead by Daylight Wiki.
---
The problem with Luck and more particularly Up The Ante is several fold. First of all Trapper isn't exactly a popular Killer and there will rarely be a need to unhook yourself as Survivor. What's more is that Up The Ante's 9% increase to luck (at level 3 with all Survivors alive) really doesn't provide much of an impact unless stacked with other Survivors. (For a 36% increase which still isn't that impressive I'm going to be honest.) (This is also why addons like Ivory Chalk Pouch [+3% Luck to self] are fairly redundant.)
---
Perhaps the biggest issue with Up The Ante however is how it's been completely powercrept out of the game by Deliverance. Up The Ante when combined with the Very Rare "Vigo's Jar of Salty Lips" offering (which tbh I never see on my bloodwebs) does provide a 48% max increase to base luck, which on top of the 4% base chance to unhook oneself can be a fairly potent combo. Having up to 3 coin flips to unhook yourself will often produce results, and combined with Slippery Meat for an additional 3 tries to unhook yourself there's little to no reason not to go for what's effectively a 1/32 chance to not unhook yourself.
---
But the thing is that 1 in 32 is still a chance that the unhook will fail. In addition any Killer that sees 4 Vigo's Jar of Salty Lips burnt by an all Ace team ~~(something something don't have to be Ace)~~ will be almost guaranteed to camp the hook in expectation of a self unhook.
---
Compare this to Deliverance where the only investment is to unhook one Survivor (and tbh just run at the hook with Borrowed Time and you'll get it) for the comparatively low cost of being Broken for 60 seconds as opposed to having a 4 man SWF all play with -1 perk slot and a 6000 Bloodpoint offering there's absolutely no contest. Up The Ante just requires far too much of an investment when compared to Deliverance, which honestly is a theme with Ace's perks. Open Handed similarly is only really viable when playing in a 4 stack of Survivors, and while the "global map hack" with Kindred and Bond is a pretty interesting build at times there are far better perks to run than Kindred and Bond, and far better perks to run in addition to those perks than a perk which just increases the aura reading of those perks by 8 meters.
---
I will say this: if you somehow know that you're going to be playing against a Trapper and you **really** want him to hate life: do the Open Handed build. Along with Slippery Meat you have over a 75% chance to get out of a bear trap with each tug along with your nearly 100% chance to unhook yourself. ~~(This is also why I think even if Trapper becomes meta he has so many perks / mechanics that exist to counter *just* him that he will never become too OP.)~~ But excluding Trapper there's absolutely no reason to ever run Luck offerings. You're never going to try to unhook yourself and if you want to Deliverance is just objectively better.
---
Ace's perks really need a rework. The only people I ever see running Up The Ante are either people who are memeing or people trying for Adept Ace.
---
I'd rather take double points over an effect that realistically just about never has a trigger. A vast majority of my games I get 0 aura reading but every many games I can get double points.
---
I've known that you're not supposed to cleanse but this is nice. At least it gives me some chance I can cleanse somewhat safely or safer.
---
it's not an one shot though, but yeah, if you're already broken you're fucked
---
I will always facecamp every damn survivor that teabags behind a pallet. Or just tap flashlight or emote at me. I usually play nice and sometimes i even give a hatch, but when someone is being toxic, believe me, i can be more toxic.
---
*God tier meme. Fixed that title for ya
---
There is no way anyone that knows these killers ranks Ghostface above both Billy and Freddy or even Hag.  He is a very solid killer but absolutely not man.  It has nothing to do with not being good with Ghostface.
---
So Im still somewhat new and havent figured a few things out: 1) whats a mori? 2) what are black locks and how do you find them 3) how do you get kill animations and make them work as a killer in a match (I get how the perk is supposed to work, but have never pulled it off)
---
How refreshing to see a dude running from a slasher half naked for a change.
---
People underage legion so much, why did you rate him so low, actually pissed off now.
---
You would run 3 blink Nurse on console?
---
I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Go play Barbie Explorer for PS1
---
Just take the hit, they don‚Äôt get far after using it, or quit tunneling them off the hook if it‚Äôs early in the game simple enough. But if you slug to leave them that‚Äôs a personal problem.
---
Ooh that was close lmao
---
this one time I played a Billy match and the survivors just had a really bad start and IIRC correctly someone gave up on the hook so I decided to let whoever happened to be the last person in the trial out. 
---
it was this adorable dwight and I closed the hatch for p o i n t s but I had no intention of hunting him down. he could have gone and opened a gate.
---
i went to check the basement just to see if the chest was looted and he decided to come down and look with me then we parted ways
---
a little later i saw him on a gate but the timer was ticking down so i zoomed over to watch. he got it open and was running out then right before to broke the plane to escape the timer ran out and he was sacrificed
---
the one decision to go in to the basement with me killed him lol
---
It's super effective against The Spirit, The Nurse, which are top tier killers atm. I also personally find it fun to use. I was able to escape this prestiged out bloody Nurse because of it. I'm sure I would have gotten hooked if he heard my breathing. Was injured too so it would have been pretty easy to hear.
---
That‚Äôs fucked up
---
I am beyond amazed he didn't DC there.
---
Legion would be gen z
---
Operation health?
---
Explain please
---
I mena it's just random. I play on PC and I'd say I run into 2 or 3 Spirit killers out of 10.
---
Yeah I'll never understand these idiots that attempt to justify this practice.  And you just know he rips on the survivors that pull this against him in his games.
---
A good way to think bout this is if you consider some perks being in categories that pertain to their effects. Exhaustion is like a cooldown effect, except it applies to all exhaustion perks.
---
We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever is good for farming.
---
Now I want a Where's Waldo style book where you have to try to find Myers instead.
---
You don't want to play at rank 1
---
You could do a whole series of unhelpful perks. 
---
Can you hear me now?: Make an obnoxiously loud phone call, alerting the killer to your position. 
---
Derp: You tripped over a rock. Enter dying state.
---
Trick or Treat MF: One of the survivors spontaneously learns karate and kicks your ass, then shocks your balls.
---
How
---
Preservations just annoying and determination needs a major numbers adjustment imo
---
I dont really understand how the mirror thing works
---
Another way to do this would be assigning the NOED to a random dull totem. If it is cleansed, NOED will not activate. It is still shown as a dull totem so you cannot know if NOED was just cleansed, so no changes on the survivor's behavior.
---
It removes the requirement to clear all 5 totems. Makes it reliant on luck like Hex Ruin does.
---
u fooockkkeeenn heartlesssss mayaaaaeerssss
---
I generally consider myself a calm person but damn this game has made me rage harder than any other game.
---
If by tunneling you mean just aiming for injured or easy targets, it's actually a very good thing to do as a killer wanting to win, especially if you know when someone's truly vulnerable  and you have room to do it. 
---
The quicker you can get someone out the game the better. It's just never ever fun for the survivor, especially because they end up with like 7k BP end of the match and everyone else gets like at least 15k-30k. That's why people don't like it. 
---
But survivors teabag and killers tunnel. Both are things that make the other side not happy but they're honestly not necessarily "wrong". One can let a killer eliminate a threat early and the other can taunt a killer to chasing you and wasting time.
---
Killers face camping and ensuring 1 person dies ASAP and survivors bringing 2+ commodious toolboxes are a different story and are always a dick move to do.
---
I don‚Äôt get it he did get the flashlight save.
---
Enduring doesnt work on ds, they changed that ages ago
---
It's like a cat and mouse thing. They have to stop the killer from getting to it first if they dont want to have a disadvantage
---
I doubt I'll ever reach there but if I can I'd like to just for my own accomplishment.
---
Yeah I agree dude this is stupid
---
One thing I hate about this game is the the bandwagon of hating dedicated servers. Like it's being TESTED so that they can fine tune it and get it working for good.
---
What a dick move. There‚Äôs literally no excuse for that
---
I‚Äôm a heavy killer main and while the game definitely gets frustrating but MOST of the time when I lose it‚Äôs either my fault or the survivors were just better than me. What I really just can‚Äôt stand is when survivors complain about how I played, since I really try to play so that everyone has fun- only tunneling when absolutely necessary. But no I agree that some people try to play the game cheaply and end up being unable to realize to just let up a chase.

yup

wait, did mori nerf too?
---
Well huh, I‚Äôve always hated boosting so that‚Äôs a bit annoying but good on you for getting a 3k against that
---
People main a survivor by how they look because if you get Feng‚Äôs teachables, any other survivor can now have them. I personally don‚Äôt really like any of Ashe‚Äôs perk anymore. The only decent one is Flip Flop if you‚Äôre trying to run an anti slug build. I would recommend leveling up David King for his teachable Dead Hard which you can find very useful in chases. But Feng‚Äôs teachables are really good for new players so i‚Äôd stick with her until you improve your gameplay
---
ALL THE CHARACTERS I PLAY ARE LEVEL 50 AND I LIKE MY LOADOUTS. WHAT DO I NEED POINTS FOR? THE WHOLE GOAL IS TO SURVIVE/KILL. IF YOU DON'T SURVIVE/KILL, [YOU LOST THE GAME](/intensifies). WHATEVER MEASLY POINTS YOU GET ARE JUST A CONSOLATION PRIZE TO LESSEN THE STING OF LOSING A TINY BIT. THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN PEOPLE PLAYING TO FARM WORTHLESS INTERNET POINTS WHEN THE REST OF US ARE TRYING TO ACTUALLY WIN THE DAMN GAME.
---
I love this. The offerings on the table as bets is a clever addition too.
---
So even when you play normal you dont get  Survivors teabagging you and saying ez baby killer go back to rank 20???. Most of my games I have to play like an asshole because i get clicking all game and teabagging. (Ps4) player
---
Do you know when the rift comes out?
---
C for cunt?
---
What‚Äôs boosting?
---
I think you‚Äôre mistaking the point of the discussion. Mori is a free slot in the load out, and tremendously affects the game. Nobody is saying woah why doesn‚Äôt survivor side have something that insta knocks out objectives, they‚Äôre saying it just shouldn‚Äôt be this way. It‚Äôs cute to compare mori to a coordinated 4 stack using the same add-on.

I don‚Äôt fully agree that a win must be 12 hooks all survivors dead either. As much as you might think so, a win is not always a 4k, or people die on first hook because randoms, things happen. Even if you were just stating for math reasons if we are talking about ebony it takes off one full chase or one hook for each survivor, so four chases or hooks or 1/3 of 12. Even so, the killer could patrol near the hooked survivor to halve the next chase they could potentially have. You may not use your mori offering the same way, but when playing survivor side, many killers use it in this particular way to make sure survivors can have a nice 2 minute match with 5k blood points or less. It isn‚Äôt about BP or optimal play, it‚Äôs just about making players have a bad time, especially when you factor in perks and add-ons to make it overkill.
---
Did he mori two people, if not it might have just been a Ivory

Im generally super nice to survivors if I have a game where I do super well, or something unfortunate happens for them like a DC or two, or it was just a fun game with skilled survivors that wernt assholes about it. It started when i mained survivor and held multiple SHITTY games with toxic killers, I just wanted to spread some love.
---
I always try to give hatch to the last person (after I down them, or else ive had assholes tbag by it and im just sitting there like "bro... I gave it to you. You could have been downed a while ago"
---
So I implore you guys, if youre the last one down and get picked up. Dont struggle. There have been so many games where im trying to carry someone to the hatch and they start struggling when im super far away, so i just have to hook them.
---
Of course, there are games where i deal with toxic survivors and then I just play normally for a few games.
---
I'm a fair killer most of the time I try not to tunnel to pervent angering people and normally if its a very close game I will have mercy on the last guy but if you piss me off flashlight or gen rushing or just being a prick and running up to me and following me around the map but keep looping me and follow when I give up on you I will try any way possible to kill you all tunneling camping (ONLY the asshole thats bothering me)
---
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
---
i knew i wasn't the only one who thought this
---
Aaannnd... Depip
---
did she just drink a . . . . . . . p. . . . .e . . . e. . . .  ( not insulting, but why the water on mouth tho? )
---
Honestly idgf I am survivor main but play killer quite alot too and if I hooked someone twice and Im walking away and their stupid friend unhooks them right away like I dont give a shit Im downing the injured guy and taking him out the game I want to win why would I give up getting the advantage just so Im not "tunneling" not my fault idiot unhooks u when I haven't even walked 20 feet yet
---
I'd be 100% down for not having a new killer/map/perks if we got legit good emotes and balance changes.   
---
BHVR should take notes
---
I don‚Äôt think it was because I was able to continue playing. And usually steam maintenance kicks me off the game
---
I‚Äôm a little confused
---
Fuck I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think of spine chill. Of course. Yeah I thought about doing lithe and going for a full ninja build like Noob3 had recently but I think I want to go full never seen blendette.
---
That's already how Moris work.
---
Unreadable, it doesn‚Äôt have a c-
---
It‚Äôs just when a high rank survivor teams up with low rank survivors (like rank 1 with rank 14s) to either get easier or harder killers. Usually it results in new killers just getting bullied. I understand that some people just have high rank friends but sometimes it‚Äôs just done intentionally
---
This happens to me so much because apparently teabagging is not toxic
---
Face camping is fucked tho
---
Dude this always happens to me!
---
The guy disconnected which means the three that are left get a huge disadvantage since the game is much easier dealing with three than four. The killer went easy since he had already pretty much won.
---
Srsly. How am I supposed to learn this game ???? Its so frustrating and not fun. I get RANK 10 as level 20 killer and when I say ‚Äûokay this is probably a killer bug lets try survivors‚Äú, then I get paired wirh others of the same rank against a rank 5 killer while having almost no perks, no items ... those devs are so horrible. Its such a cool game and the destroy their own game ?
---
Better idea: Same as the 4-meter thing but:
---
-Only applies once, even if multiple people are there
---
-Only applies to injured survivors
---
Dbd is a great way to get your anger out I suppose, unless you lose that is
---
I like the idea but it‚Äôs unlikely since he‚Äôs already in death garden
---
No one's asking for clarification sorry
---
Happens to the best of us
---
I think your art is really pretty...but not really feeling the design as it doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do w the character or her lore.  I find myself challenged by the idea that Anna would rock bootyshorts and Regina George‚Äôs hair.   But again - really like your art style a lot.
---
I‚Äôve been on Reddit for about 6 years and never knew this. Thanks.
---
It's just a fun drawing I did! And thank you so much!
---
No just saying that at the very end of the swing when the weapon is down the halfsecond before the cooldown kicks in when the swing should be at its minimum it is at its max range
---
There are no of infinite‚Äôs anymore, but the term has evolved. It now means a loop that can be safely run for a minimum 3 vaults, wasting excessive amounts of the killers time. There are a few infinite‚Äôs in existence, though bloodlust has weakened all of them
---
Shut the fuck up boomer
---
DCing for the hatch is toxic. "Hey, that 4 man you just earned? How about a 2k instead?"
---
&gt; (the risk being losing essentially any chase that she commits to). 
---
Literally any killer can end any chase they commit to
---
&gt; no longer broken
---
being broken against Plague is not a big deal *at all* 
---
&gt; throw up on everyone once and then just press m1 when there should be a game of balancing her corrupt purge vs her normal throw up where the survivors may in some cases actually want to use the fountains.
---
It's very obvious when people don't play Plague and try to talk about her
---
I mentioned the Small Game because you went out of your way to bring up your NOED lol.  No where was the context that it was just a couple of games period until this last response.
---
Honestly if my killer isnt camping/soft patrolling im looking for Devour IMMEDIATELY.
---
Yeah she dropped her axe off at the local butcher, grabbed a coffee and then picked it up after it got sharpened for the next party to slay.
---
Holy shit zooming in is brilliant
---
I don't play huntress but I would if this was a skin
---
Gremlin child
---
I really don't see how. I have never seen high rank survivors complain about the Plague being OP or too hard, I have played against good plagues and we only really get in trouble when one selfish prick starts cleansing when the rest of us are afflicted or when she runs the Aura reading addon that reveals you when puking (mostly because it makes it easy for her to locate the most vulnerable player)
---
This sounds like you need more experience facing her, this is not a common or shared opinion at all.
---
Thank you so much! It's just a fun doodle for me and I wanted to have fun with it!
---
oh my god this is just petulant whining
---
I try my best not to tunnel but sometimes, I find the same survivor again and just hook them.
---
I get that's she hard to master, in the sense that there's a lot of mindgames to use in the right situations, but she is not hard to play. All you gotta do is get good at following scratch marks, which you need for every other killer anyway.
---
God no i want more original killers bot licensed
---
I need to go look for it!! Yes the pig squeak definitely!!!!!
---
No, it shows the kind of person the survivors are. Almost everyone agrees that playing like that is being a huge asshole. You are just exploiting bad map design. Good thing it‚Äôs getting reworked.
---
People do shit like this and whine when they only see Spirit and Nurse at the red ranks
---
It gives stealth killers more of an advantage, were trying to fix something that isnt broken
---
As killer Iron Will is definitely in the top 10 annoying perks.
---
I play both sides. It's really helpful to play both, because you know what everything looks like from the other perspective. You can play better mind games.
---
Very fair point
---
&gt; you can easily get an exposed and catch them off on haddonfield
---
In Haddonfield? No you can't.
---
pffft nah ahaha its based off the hallowed light event where they're all dripping glowing goo
---
Killers only play spirit and nurses and complain when survivours do shit like this. It goes both ways.
---
Pathetic encourage more infants to baby rage and quit every game they don't like the opposing loadout in.  This is every bit as sad as the survivors that do it against Prayer Beads, Iri Heads, Moris etc....Just play the games you queue in to.  This shit ruins the game.
---
WTF? I GET 4K'S THERE ALL THE TIME. I LOVE ORMOND, ESPECIALLY FOR STALKY BOIS.
---
ayy thanks boss
---
OH LOOK A BRAND NEW ACCOUNT SAYING SOMETHING EXTREMELY SUSPECT
---
Dedicated servers close the server after so long its kinda dumb and should close if someone hasnt responded in awhile cause ove been having good conversations and all of a sudden server is closed
---
I love the perk but a non hex version would be broken as hell.
---
Man that scene pissed me off so much when I watched the movie.
---
i dont know what you're talking about, michael goes all like ba-ba buh ba-ba buh BING Boooooonggg when he gets into tier 2 so
---
This picture could work as 2 separate Joker spoilers
---
I check my recent players when I get into a lobby, it‚Äôll say *last met 1 minute ago* &amp; then I can usually narrow down which one is the killer if there are already other survivors in the lobby. 
---
I just don‚Äôt want to run into the same killers sometimes, specifically if I‚Äôve already had a bad match with them before.
---
I hit the last guy on hook because I love hearing Demo's roar
---
It‚Äôs not easy being nice but it does feel great to see stuff like this. :)
---
Servers are bs.
---
Since they released it become almost impossible to use dead hard to avoid lunge attacks after animation starts. Not all the times but ... then you get hit while geting exhausted from dh or some time even in mid animation. It's very frustrating.
---
And before you actually may have dodge a bad ping killers. With survs waiting time it's no big deal. I cant understand how this is a solution to anyfing. TT
---
The worst is when you make a conscious effort to avoid tunnelling but you still get accused of it anyway
---
Maybe spirit or clown
---
His parents didn't give him enough attention. Ignore him for the best.
---
Bamboozle from the Clown is pretty good from what I‚Äôve heard
---
a nurse can still dominate on console ppl tend to just give up early but if you keep practicing holy shit. Ik I have faced some unreal nurses in all my time playing the game plus if you let that aim assist do its job you will get hits you could never get if you tried moving it yourself on controller at least
---
i dont even know what the deal is dude, nobody cares what you think is funny or not, i dont think its all that funny either but i also realize literally nobody cares about my insight on a shitty tierlist meme, ignore it bro, or just haha downvote it if you really wanna show em what for, loser.
---
No, I caught your point perfectly.
---
&gt;  If people are deliberately hamstringing themselves for the entire match because half of the killer's power is so deeply unfun that it must be avoided at all costs
---
This is you complaining about either being broken or Plague having Corrupt Purge. I'm saying: so what? Because being broken is not that big of a deal. It undermines your point.
---
Woah the blight tamed her hair.
---
How come? Is there a possibility that my game might be glithced?
---
&gt; I caught your point perfectly
---
Apparently not if you're still confused about which point I'm making.
---
Iron Will is hands down one of the best survivor perks in the game currently. It‚Äôs insane the amount of times I‚Äôve lost killers in general just by breaking line of sight for a few seconds and walking away only to hide a few meters from the killer arduously searching for me. Plus, it **hard counters** the Spirit. 
---
Try it out for a few matches, and see for yourself how amazing it is.
---
Yes, it is, Decisive Strike. If you're downed and picked up within 60 seconds of being hooked, you get a skill check. If you succeed, you can escape and stun the killer for 5 seconds.
---
*proceeds to bitch and moan when survivors T bag*
---
sexy legs
---
Oh my god... I was looking at that trap thinking to myself "nah, he would not, he can't..." and then he did. Twice. And I was sitting here gasping like a granny watching her soap opera.
---
Jesus Christ... Jeeesus Christ...
---
Look it's a fucking video game, I'll play it how ever I want.
---
If I'm camping take advantage of it and gen rush the fuck outta me.
---
If I'm tunneling ^^^^
---
See if I have to ruin the fun of others to my job as the KILLER then I'm gonna do what I have to do to win
---
&gt;any killer can end any chase they commit to
---
Tell that to all the killers that give up on chases after 3 gens have been completed. 
---
&gt;being broken against a plague is not a big deal *at all* 
---
Right. That‚Äôs...what I said. That‚Äôs why it needs to be improved so it‚Äôs much more necessary to use fountains. Are you reading what I wrote?
---
&gt;it‚Äôs funny when people don‚Äôt play Plague and try to talk about her
---
You‚Äôre right I don‚Äôt play her. I play *against* her. Her fountains are useless they do nothing but get me fucked. I avoid them. That‚Äôs a design problem that should be fixed. I should feel a strong need to go get a fountain but have to weigh that against the power up she gets. I currently don‚Äôt feel a strong need because her power up is very good.
---
Ah, right, that just happened. But that should cover the remake as well.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI981r9y9Ok
---
That fucking Mr X is some terror.
---
I want a killer that Vaults Windows and doesnt even touch em
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil22019/mods/61](https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil22019/mods/61)  there is !! It took me a while to find it but it was totally worth it
---
So...who‚Äôs gonna tell ‚Äòem?
---
I checked on a dbd bug report site and it‚Äôs still happening to a lot of people apparently
---
They are thumbstick extenders that change range of motion and allow more precise movements with a controller.
---
Then clarify, please
---
&gt; You‚Äôre right I don‚Äôt play her. 
---
all i needed to know thx
---
Nurse kinda does that bcz she jumps over it idk...
---
Especially for the survivor, but there are negatives to the killer, as well. Most importantly it‚Äôs just a scummy way to play a game.
---
Oh, ok. Yeah, he'd totally do that. Heck, in comics he already beat Freddy at least once (I haven't read the sequel yet)
---
Her vomit just injures you unless you weren‚Äôt moving much. If you get hit with a bunch of red vomit at once, it will down you.
---
It's funny you posted this. My first game after this reset was against a plague. Within the first minute 2 people cleansed, at that point I knew we weren't making it out.
---
Yeah but it doesnt look epic like this
---
As survivor who isn't that good it sucks being tunneled, I have such a hard time looping the killer. I always get mindgamed and doesn't take long for me to get downed. 
---
That said, I don't blame the killer. If they realize they can easily get me versus my teammates who can usually last longer, they will go after me. If they go after me first that puts my team at a huge disadvantage. I just gotta get better. 
---
I think a big problem for me is that I need to be aware of a killer using bbq. Im always perplexed how easily they find me, and I think thats probably how they do it.
---
I can say from experience that if you stick with it, you‚Äôll get matchmade more evenly and get better, of course.  Starting out is so fucking frustrating tho
---
&gt;I have never seen high rank survivors complain
---
You've never seen high rank survivors complain about a killer nobody uses at high rank?  Shocked.  Also, you *are* aware that not 100% of the player base is in red ranks, right?
---
Awesome, might just get re2 on pc now
---
My erection can only get so big
---
Omfg I see it
---
This post gave me acne
---
Nearly the same thing happend to me, I was talking to my father and I thought i heard the Myers music, I looked around and saw nothing, so I went back to working on the gen. I finish talking and I just see Michael just getting fed by Dwight.
---
*Dwight 
---
Ftfy
---
Yes, totally!
---
lol lucky man :)
---
Premonition and spine chill??????????
---
Legit survivors are the main reason I play as heard and as vicious as I do I won‚Äôt straight up tunnel or camp but I also won‚Äôt go out of my way to ignore people in the name of not tunneling like seriously survivors aways act like asses and try and make up rules that killer have to do and when we try to play nice they teabag and act like cunts
---
So you mean a battlepass?
---
So it does proc overcharged? Or...
---
That's exactly what I did üòÇ Struggling didn't work either so I rage quit when my poor Dweet got stabbed by the EntiNea
---
THE MOTHER FUCKING NURSE REWORK
---
Me! This has already been posted op ‚Äúpack your things, get out of my building‚Äù
---
But. But. I have a medkit. Want it? Yours!! You want some bloodpoints?? Take em too!
---
What's your Gamer tag?
---
not on console lol
---
What I really want to know is why do other killers have that animation and sound effects  when in theory trapper is the only killer that uses it
---
‚ÄúWhat is medkit? Can I spend it?‚Äù
---
Guess I'm just unlucky.
---
It isn't about the loops and moreso that cleansing gives you points but let's Plague down you for free. All incentives, AND LOGIC points to survivors wanting to cleanse as being one hit, M1 or not, is a natural thing. Survivors NATURALLY WANT to heal. 
---
You effectively permanently lose HP for just fighting plague optimally which is bad design. Period. Whether or not it is possible to ignore Broken shouldn't play into this.
---
"ToXiC sUrVs BoOlY iNnOcEnT kIlLeR!!!!!" /s
---
How does that work?
---
Don‚Äòt think 800 is even possible to do in one Match (without the First Survivor/Killer match of the Day Bonus) unless they changed XP in the PTB.
---
UwU
---
I hit them to stop the fucking screaming. Plus, they're like pinatas, how can you not smack one?
---
https://youtu.be/KNZSXnrbs_k
---
And sometimes I don't wanna suicide on Hook because I got downed due to no fault of my own. Tombstone is equally frustrating but at least that has the fucking decency to just kill my ass so I don't have to deal with this shit.
---
PLEASE NO EMOTES!!! As cool as it would be to see Myers default dance I hope they don‚Äôt add it
---
&gt; It isn't about the loops
---
This is literally the core gameplay mechanic for survivors. Of course it's about this. The fact that you are incapable of looping a Nurse in any circumstance is why Nurse is broken and why Spirit arguably 
---
needs a nerf of some sort. To say it isn't about this is asinine.
---
&gt; moreso that cleansing gives you points but let's Plague down you for free. All incentives, AND LOGIC points to survivors wanting to cleanse as being one hit, M1 or not, is a natural thing. Survivors NATURALLY WANT to heal. 
---
This is some goofy shit here. It has nothing to do with whether she needs a nerf. It's just you saying you personally don't like it because you want cleansing points and you're too scared to be injured
---
&gt; Whether or not it is possible to ignore Broken shouldn't play into this.
---
Literally saying that the counter doesn't matter. Why should I take you seriously?
---
Just was not sure I never paid attention to it lol. And I saw someone make a post saying how completing the battle pass will be impossible so I was concerned lol
---
On a real note. The people who say to "just use Iron Will" when discussing Spirit balance are goofy as hell. No perk should be mandatory, especially when it's a coin flip as to which killer you'll face.
---
Lmao!
---
You mean which to run or which he has?
---
Those aren't instant win perks though, would you like to argue Iri Hatchet isn't an instawin?
---
Also, I play killer, bitching about Haddonfield is ridiculous. Like Corn Maps or The Game I get but Haddonfield is pretty nicely balanced if you know how to play it.
---
Oh wao I didn't know that. Thanks for the info.
---
I definitely see them on xbox, in all ranks including red
---
After rank reset I got put in green ranks. The amount of fave camping I‚Äôve seen compared to purple/red is absurd. I‚Äôm on PC btw.
---
How do you mean exactly?
---
Just suicide on first hook vs Iri is what I do. If you are just going to run instadown bullshit and I choose to not run Instaheaks than I'll just leave and give you minimum points.
---
It skips all the waiting to DC because you KNOW you won't win vs that. It is simply statistically improbable.
---
oh my god poor thing, hopefully, he is not getting chased :/
---
PS4 at least seems to be the most toxic of all the DbD communities. 
---
Switch is probably the most wholesome for now because everyone is so new there and it's still growing. 
---
PC seems like the even ground. Toxicity? Sure? But there's an equal amount of just chill zin people playing.
---
But stay clear of PS4. I've basically almost given up on that version as both killer and survivor.
---
Not really most survivors are entitled like I used to be. So I dunno.
---
This subreddit **dramatically** exaggerates how much facecamping there is.
---
He has punchable face.
---
I've always thought that they could make bank selling new mori animations.
---
It kinda sucks overall since you have no perks or add-on. Especially if you get to higher ranks
---
Clown forces slow vaults though so it makes no difference. Being able to instadown with an add-on is just flat bad design, like instaheals.
---
DS aint busted. Old DS is busted.
---
I play on PS4 and it doesn‚Äôt happen *too* often. But every now and then I‚Äôll get a killer that will hard facecamp everybody he hooks.
---
I agree actually
---
Me - *"Dude dont do fountains it just makes her stronger!"*
---
Friend - *"I'm sorry brother I must __DRINCC.__"*
---
Last thing I said was "OK" so I think he realised his shit ain't gonna work
---
Taking away items is like taking away ability addons
---
No, I've just started to draw stuff apart from classwork.
---
Sort of like Operation: Health
---
Also never let anyone tell you it's a green rank thing. In my experience? I see facecamping far more in the red ranks on PS4 at least. 
---
I think it's legitimately and purely a ''I had a bad game prior so I'm taking it out on you!" thing there.
---
I'd say about 80% of my games on console have had campers. It's been especially bad today, they'll do it right in front of you with no shame
---
Run the Third Seal if you want total aura blockage.
---
Nice, Funny how he DC'ed in the end. Did he have a bad match?
---
I'm disappointed in you gentlemen.
---
[SOURCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvURnct48mc)
---
There is a roadmap out online and from what I remember this next chapter will not come with new map
---
Mathematically false. An optimal SWF can complete every gen in 3m30 with no toolboxes and no skill checks even with people going down and getting unhooked.
---
Unless you mean a good killer as in "Nurse with range addons" or "Gen grabber spirit" in which case you'd be right. No other killer is capable of preventing a coordinated SWF gen rush.
---
I think the in lore explanation is that when survivors are in a trial (a game) the entity makes it where they can't talk, only scream.
---
You didn't just 360 this man, you hit him with Shawn White's Front Double Cork 1080.
---
I'd really really like an original killer. BHVRs original killers are awesome.
---
Do killers really need ability addons? Why not just remove those too while we're at it
---
It‚Äôs weird to say a card game can be ‚Äúfast‚Äù and somehow know it‚Äôs so right
---
Ok but consider Jane Romero's THICCness. Who wouldn't chase that for 5 gens?
---
I can definitely say that that isn't always true. Every now and then you'll run into that one killer who waits *just* out of range so they get that Devour stack. I'll never forget this one game I had where you could see the Nurse just waiting with her blink while looking directly at the hook. One of the easiest games I've ever had, but I'm sure not everybody is as lucky. Do agree about it being fun to go against though.
---
My ps4 messages are now mostly filled with hate messages from DBD. Apart from league of legends, DBD takes second place in most saltiest and hateful community.
---
Irc that's a common blade type. Amanda could have gotten that at every Chinese shop in America's malls to be completely honest. 
---
Nice catch as they could have reused the same blade and given it a new texture but it likely is just a coincidence.
---
i have an oink tier list lol
---
So locked gens stay green to a killer, so a killer knows which gens are unlocked and since it would be only a small amount a killer could just camp those gens making it extremely difficult to work on them for survivors
---
Anyone but Steve and Nancy tbh. Their voice actors make them sound like babies.
---
I honestly have it happen quite frequently on PS4, either to teammates or myself. Surprisingly this is at red ranks. A lot of Killers seem to tunnel nowadays as well and don‚Äôt give a shit about DS, they just eat it and continue.
---
Usefulness*
---
&gt; That's because there are four Survivors. 
---
And according to dev's in avarage game 2 of them are meant to escape.
---
&gt; Brand New Part would get rid of 1/5th of the Survivors Objectives for 7000 BP.... But you could run four of them. 
---
BNP is addon to toolbox that allows to repair 25% of 1 gen in no time (assuming u gonna hit skillchecks). Only if all 4 surv run it, it removes only 1/5 of the gens or 1/6 of surv objectives (opening exit gates is also objective).
---
&gt; People really need to understand that Survivors need to be weaker because a Killer runs into 4x the whatever. 
---
And people need to understand that game shouldnt be balanced around 4 try-harding swf. Casual Sole Survivor's Life Matter!
---
&gt; Also, a Mori takes out 1/6th of a Killers objective, not 1/3rd. You need 12 hooks to win. 
---
What kind of math is it? 1/6 of 12 hooks is 2. Ebony mori saves u way more time, since u need only: 4 hooks and 4 moris (mori isnt the same as hook since in case of mori u have all your second chance perks denied, look DS)
---
you sure because I hit jakes and they dont even scream. i think iron will even says 'your iron will prevents you from screaming'
---
Na I don't think u are ur just downing and hooking and u couldn't find the last guy so? That's not being toxic man, they are just being dicks.
---
Agreed. I absolutely LOVE OG killers and the more classical horror villains over the newer licensed ones. 
---
I like Steve and Nancy but Demogorgon just doesn't feel me with the same happiness as Micheal or Doctor. I can't even begin to phrase how unexcited I would be for Pennywise.
---
But survivors don't want to have to do totems. They want to get 5 gens and a door done and leave. The sooner they do that, the better. Everything they do that's not [5 gens and a door] is time the killer gains.
---
And the killer does want to tunnel - In the sense of removing a survivor from the game asap. Every survivor that's alive is one more survivor doing [5 gens and a door]. Turning the game from 4v1 to 3v1 is a 25% drop in efficiency. That's a huge gain for the killer. So a killer's goal is typical [kill each survivor one by one asap].
---
But I agree with you that both perks are meant to force either side to rethink their strategy, but any change to the strategy of [5 gens and a door] or [kill each survivor one by one asap] is counterintuitive to what the player wants. DS forces the Killer to chase someone different or else be punished by negating a successful chase and needing to rechase. NOED forces the survivors to not do gens and remove totems or else be punished by easy deaths in end-game.
---
And that's a good thing, ultimately... But I still think DS may still be just a little too tuned against the killer. Don't take this as a "Nerf it to the ground" situation, I think it's very close to balanced. But getting hit by 4 DSs in one game is devastating to a killer.
---
I forgot to mention that unlocked gens try not to stay too close together but not too far
---
Yeah I feel that pain. I'm speaking about the new case/most fun scenario. Both sides can ruin a fun concept or interaction based off how they play it.
---
WHY IS THERE ALWAYS THAT ONE SON OF A PRICK WHO JUST WON'T READY UP ? 4 PEOPLE (KILLER INCLUDED) ALREADY READIED, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THAT PERSON WHOSE PARENTS DIDN'T LOVE THEM ENOUGH, SO THEY HAVE TO FEEL LIKE THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND MAKE US WAIT. THIS HAPPENS IN 9 OUT OF 10 TRIALS, FFS.
---
 That was my point. Killers are less toxic. :)
---
And  occasional Spirit nerf ofc
---
This caught me off guard and I had a big ol laugh lol.
---
I‚Äôve seen this so many times, now i kinda want them to add it so I stop seeing the exact same post almost every day
---
This is gorgeous!
---
"Bruh, survivors OP"
---
We PS4 members get a free change, besides what‚Äôs a Salty Meg/Billy going to do?
---
If I may ask what survivor were you and your friend?
---
Sadly I made it all the way to rank eight, good thing the messed up matchmaking actually pins me against a wide variety of killers...
---
That‚Äôs rough. It‚Äôs sad that he went out of his way to be a jerk- especially against someone new to a character. And I get it- playing killer the first several times can be intimidating. I hope if you ever want to try killer again, you have a better experience.
---
Um wtf?
---
I‚Äôm a little bit pissed
---
Have you played on console??? I get face campers all the time. In fact 50% of every game I play has a face camper. You can‚Äôt assume we are exaggerating just based on your experiences
---
Yeah this game will do that to ya
---
Legion.
---
They will fight for power on their own.
---
We were both playing as Ace, he was wearing the basic outfit I was wearing one with slightly more color
---
It‚Äôs funny because the game before it I did amazing and then I get facecamped
---
Whoa calm down mate do whatever it is to calm down. Just breathe and probably play a different game man.
---
Bubba is like 50% chance to be a facecamper, Spirit probably second most likely doing that "I'm phasing but not really" thing.
---
Outside of that, people don't really do it.
---
I‚Äôm watching YouTube now. That just killed my motivation to play
---
Are you saying it is fun now üòÇ
---
Would help a little, but would still require a lot of back and forth if the killer frequently visits unlocked gens. Would be most successful if all survivors worked together
---
I get getting angry but saying you'd beat someone then posting about it just makes you come off as irrational.
---
I play League to escape DbD's toxicity. It's that bad.
---
That‚Äôs so fucking toxic of him to do to you lol
---
That‚Äôs what anger issue do bud
---
I'm on xbox.  Lots of killers "patrol".  At launch there was more hard camping.  I've only seen a handful of actual face camps.
---
If everyone else cleanses, go for it. Try to get all fountains corrupted at a time when it's least convenient for the plague
---
Iron Will is one of the best survivor perks in the game.
---
Some maps are too small for that to work unfortunately tho
---
Jeff and Legion, if you have ¬£¬£¬£
---
So I see someone doesnt need to play games if it leads to a reaction like that.
---
Oh ok, well I'm sorry it wasn't me then. But I did spare 2 people with Demogorgon last night so I thought I'd ask. Well I hope you continue having good games :) Also if you want to hangout we can. Just let me know.
---
Legion
---
May they should! There is a lot of unnecessary and unused crap in the game. I think it is time of a full spring cleaning of unused perks items, add ons and killers! But that would probably upset a lot if people and BHVR would have to give money back (maybe) so I know it wont ever happen
---
Was it the corn field cuz it might have been you?
---
Yeah maybe they thought I meant that. I personally think hatch is smart since it gives the last survs a chance to get out at the very least.
---
Your comment has been removed from /r/deadbydaylight for the following reason(s);
---
HAD A KILLER PUT ME ON THE HOOK AND STAND DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME WHILE MY TEAM ESCAPED THROUGH THE EXIT FIVE FEET AWAY.
---
well the distance will be relative to the map size
---
wow
---
Maybe I'm lucky, but I've only ever been truly face camped one time.
---
No, I spared a David and a Meg so I doubt it. But I do hope you find the person that actually spared you. :)
---
If I see other survivors cleansing, then I'll cleanse too whenever I know I'm far away from the killer. Bonus point if the other survivor that cleansed first is in a chase. It's petty revenge wrapped in plausible deniability paired with improved blood points gains for myself and improved odds of survival. I make no apologies, I see a good deal and I take it.
---
I take it because I have no other good perks. Most of the time I don't get to use it though, I do feel like it shouldn't be a hex though just be a flat timer of like 60 seconds or something like that.
---
I once had a survivor call me a tunneler because I caught them cleansing my ruin twice in a row. And then when I said I wasn't tunneling and just defending ruin they said and I quote "Who cares about Ruin, I just want bloodpoints"
---
GET OUT OF MY SWAMP
---
Ohh I want to see it
---
Haha thanks üòò welcome to my new life
---
* Do not post flamebait or troll other users.
---
Why do every one hate spirit
---
Depends who I'm playing with. I can usually murder everyone with Wraith around rank 12. 
---
With nurse, I'll be lucky if I kill 1 guy. 
---
However, it's really obvious to me when survivors are on discord and those are the toughest. Do you guys consider using discord to coordinate cheating? The game doesn't have any built in audio communication for a reason, so I'd say that it's cheating.
---
Guy, the streamers I watch are playing red ranks and they ain't whistling and strolling around.
---
Whereas I can't find the survivors who are doing a generator as soon as I turn my back. Yesterday I spent a good 5 minutes fighting on a close proximity 3 gen strat and got A hook out of it before they popped the final gen.
---
Survivor is far less stress for me. If I get hit or hooked I'm annoyed, I die oh well--I'm more likely to die than survive anyways. There's another game 5 mins away. I'm more frustrated by my lack of getting looping down, at my timing, at improving chasing. But not tense.
---
It‚Äôs all new colour variations
---
Please draw Frank and Susie. They don't have to be together but I'd love to see you draw them. :)
---
That comes from the perk Calm Spirit, which is also a Jake perk. Prevents all the screams like getting hit, doctor screams, clown gas screams, etc.
---
Can I use this idea in a fan made idea compilation? you would be credited
---
I get you banned for that bad language
---
Pig and Huntress  
---
Pig  when she is stunned the sound she makes is very cute and the Huntress tantrum too
---
Infectious fright is terrible on pig unless you combine it with distressing. For pig, there are far more valuable perks to be using than wasting 2 slots on a slug build. Infectious fright is really only good if you plan on slugging for most of the match.
---
"Lmao just always ignore survivors for a full minute after they get unhooked, even if they're doing a gen in front of you."
---
No offence, but you just can't afford to play like this at red ranks.
---
Gr8 b8
---
Yes please! Killer addons (with the exception of maybe one or two) make it impossible to some form of common ground to base the balance of the game on. So let's get rid of them, or make a bare bones game mode
---
Let‚Äôs be honest here
---
You‚Äôll always have addons,  especially yellow/green
---
So not so much rely, but definitely use what you have
---
I got survivers so they stop screaming.
---
I think I've been unintentionally toxic this entire time...
---
Nah i mean you just epicly taking your left foot extremely high over the window, taking a step and just the same with the left foot.
---
Like those epic anime people approaching for a fat battle
---
As a straight white male I'd love the opportunity to play Claudette
---
My vote is Mikey
---
Michael Myers with beat the fake Jason Voorhees hands down, until the real Jason Voorhees shows up then Myers is screwed
---
Yes it is. Spirit only costs some shards. Those are easy to get.
---
Trapey boi all the way
---
Micheal. The dude is a monster.
---
I get the animation part because each killer is a "skin" on a skeleton rig from a development point of view but Demo squeals when he steps in the trap and Legion grunts in his/her voice. If it was truly a copy and paste then they should all make Trapper's grunt when he step in a trap. But I see where you're coming from
---
Ooo I think Frank should be wearing his smeared smirk smirk mask and Susie just in her Default mask. I think that would look good at least. But your the artist so if you wanna draw something else  then you choose.
---
As a Legion main, can confirm
---
Unless they are in the way of something you want why even bother with those add-ons? And with perks just get them now so you wont have to see them in your bloodwebs later. Or and instead of just deleting killers how about we just buff them at least to huntress or billy level
---
I love waiting out the game ask killer with blood warden and noed sometimes just to mess with survivors on rank reset downing someone to block of the gates then just killing everyone else
---
He was a new player too. I‚Äôm not sure if he got leather face just to play like that. I didn‚Äôt t-bag or anything, I was actually stupid. I got slowed down when running on an object while he was revving up his chainsaw, hit me through the window. 4 gens left, he camped with his chainsaw.
---
FUCK HAWKINS!! I HATE THAT FUCKING MAP!! I DONT GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT UNSAFE PALLETS EVERYWHERE, ITS THE FUCKING BULLSHIT AMOUNT OF DROPS THAT CAN TRIGGER ~~UN~~BALANCED LANDING!! 
---
EVERYTIME I WANT TO PLAY CLOWN, TRAPPER, OR A LOS STEALTH KILLER I GET FUCKED BY 2 PEOPLE BRINGING OFFERINGS TO TAKE THEM TO THE SPEEDWAY OR RNG JUST SHOVES ME THERE!! PLEASE PLEASE FOR ONCE CAN I PLAY A LOW TIER KILLER WITHOUT BEING SHIT ON BY THE MAP RNG, THE SURVIVORS HAVE ENOUGH SHIT TO THROW AT ME THE LITTLE SLIPPERY FUCKS!!
---
Lmao every sore ass survivor main
---
KILLER WOULDN'T STOP CAMPING AT THE FUCKING HOOKS AND WENT ON TO CALL EVERYONE PUSSY NOOBS WHICH MADE ME FUCKING RAAAAAGE
---
You're incorrect. You need cooldown add-ons to have any sort of map pressure. Limiting the nurses play style. Both of her Ultra rares are awful and the code on timer will just make traversing them at a pain in the ass compared to Killers like Spirit or hillbilly who have enough speed out of their ability to chase survivors after using their power to Traverse.
---
Try playing base nurse in the ptb with no add-ons at rank one and enjoy the three-minute match unless you're on The Game
---
You dont IGNORE THEM, I never said that. Just slug them. But go ahead, keep getting yourself d striked like a clown.
---
Lmaoooo. Im saving that. Thank you.
---
More like time to die on the hook to go next game...
---
I run different stuff, she had many builds that do well
---
For example:
---
Thanataphobia , ruin, nurses calling and sloppy butcher 
---
Thana and ruin to slow the gens down a little
---
Sloppy to make healing a pain in the butt
---
Nurses because if you run thana, people will want to heal, but also slower because sloppy, so it‚Äôs wasting time and you can easily find survivors hiding out while chasing others for a quick down
---
You could always do a more informative build like:
---
Bbq,  ruin(or your slow down perk of choice), surveillance, discordance
---
This build is especially good with prayer beads because you‚Äôll know if people are working on gens more often for a sneak grab. And bbq for more information on where people are.  
---
These are 2 pretty good ones.  Let me know if you‚Äôd like more
---
And not to mention unbreakable, most people seem to run them together. If you pick them up you get stabbed, if you leave them they get up anyway
---
Haha yes, we have taken Rin. Who‚Äôs next?
---
Doctor is called Surgeon of Slaughter. I‚Äôm not sure about feng‚Äôs
---
I play on console too. I honestly rarely get facecamped. I can count with one hand the number of times I have been facecamped the past month
---
I‚Äôll choose the man even the entity doesn‚Äôt control. Myers
---
Neither one is intended to help a survivor‚Äôs bad decisions. They‚Äôre intended to stop camping and tunneling respectively. Though decisive strike doesn‚Äôt discourage tunneling like it‚Äôs supposed to. It just encourages tunneling and then slugging.
---
Shit, you right brother. I just read your comment wrong.
---
Spirit and Clown
---
Ok thanks
---
YOU SHOULD TRY IT SOMETIME, EVEN IF YOU JUST PLAY DWIGHT YOU NEVER HAVE TO SPEND POINTS IF YOU NEVER BUY ADD ONS OR PERKS TO MAKE THEM BETTER SO YOURE JUST MAKING MONEY!
---
That, is fucking hilarious
---
Considering an ebony can be used four times per match. You‚Äôve now misconstrued the context of my message and failed to reply to the rest, I hope you don‚Äôt mind if I ask you why this is.
---
I agree with the list except for Pig. I think her mori should be higher. It's certainly better then Wraith and trapper in my opinion.
---
Unrelated to post but when do the archives come to console
---
I PLAY MEG AND EVEN I HATE OTHER MEGS
---
AKA Hex: V8
---
Wait, how's shadowborn fit into this?
---
I played a bunch of games as a survivor today, I started at rank 10 and ended at rank 8. I only faced yellow or brown rank killers the whole time.
---
Personally I own all of them, but I still buy perks from the Shrine. But I always buy stuff from killers/survivors that only have 1 top tier perk. 
---
Levelling for teachables (and then getting those teachables on other characters) is quite a grind for someone who doesn¬¥t play hardcore, and levelling an entire killer/survivor to lvl 30-40 just for a single perk when the rest is shit (and when I probably won¬¥t play much of him anyway) just sucks. At least those other 2 crap perks won¬¥t appear in my other Bloodwebs.
---
Ain‚Äôt the unnerving DS skillcheck just the same as pre-rework DS?
---
Very nice
---
David can surely beat him up. Thicc booty Jane can suffocate Frank under her ass.
---
More of a die roll below rank 10
---
IF YOU SLUG PEOPLE ALL GAME FUCK YOU! I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST LEAVING ONE PERSON DOWN WHILE CHASING AFTER ANOTHER PERSON THAT WAS NEAR, I MEAN SLUGGING EVERYONE! PLUS KNOCKOUT AND NURSE'S CALLING, WHILE PLAYING NURSE. MY GOD THAT WAS THE MOST UNFUN MATCH I'VE PLAYED IN A WHILE.
---
Demo already kills pallets natively with Shreds though? 
---
Personally I think Enduring might be a better choice there as a solo perk due to that ability.
---
Yep. Seriously unless I‚Äôm already in a chase, if someone gets unhooked and it isn‚Äôt across the map I am getting my ass there ASAP. I know there are at LEAST 2 survivors there and one is injured. It only makes sense, not my fault if you‚Äôre shit at hiding
---
Was it a good farm run?
---
I find myself leaning in whenever I go to lunge on the nurse xD
---
Happy escape cake day!
---
Nah dude it‚Äôs simple everyone is toxic
---
One could only hope designers address really simple issues like this...
---
And that‚Äôs a fact
---
the killer doesn't want to tunnel simply because it's one of the least effective ways to get kills, especially when pitted against good survivors.
---
hey thanks! I didn't even realize my account is now a year old
---
Amazing * - *
---
The more you know
---
Most likely not, but he could have been just practicing chasing a good survivor. Often times killers rank up fast and higher than they deserve, and then get looped forever. And need to practice their chasing to get good enough.
---
I‚Äôve definitely played for practice rather than the win before, it leads to many more future wins
---
Ghosty mori best mori
---
i lost
---
I would love to have a dlc pack with extra mori's like these.
---
This pretty much sums up dedicated servers
---
Stolen content police here
---
isnt it much easier to leave OoO for the last? since u know where he is, u no need take a sweat to find him
---
What a beautiful array of colors
---
Hes gotta feel like an idiot after that
---
That‚Äôs terrifying oh my god
---
Can I use this in a fan made idea compilation? You'll be credited
---
I think it's a huge disadvantage to killers going against audio since the survivors are able to coordinate well
---
Unless his screen name is SilentlyJudging I dont think this post broke the rules Tom
---
although i despite weebs and anime.... Konosuba is my weakness. take my upvote, s-scrub
---
Yeah no.
---
Killer can block the totem and unless a survivor has a key or is lucky enough to find one they aren‚Äôt getting out so by making it a hex perk you are literally making it unstoppable
---
What a gentleman
---
Dead By Daylight: Civil War
---
Hillbilly has the my least favorite moral in the game
---
It's just so lackluster even for being an original character
---
the higher FoV when you first start using shadowborn can screw up ambitious lunges when you first start using it, and particularly on the two stalker killers you need to learn how to use the higher FoV to its highest potential, but once you start doing that you become extremely used to it and it's hard to switch back from it.
---
If SWF you aren't going to get anyone until they die, or obsession switches.
---
Inner strength. Head on. DS. Legendary.
---
I love gold and blue together. Nice work.
---
Love theses ideas
---
On today's episode of "I saw this on the front page and did my best to think of a way to ham-fist it into r/deadbydaylight"
---
I once got 2 skeleton keys in the same match. Bubba didn't have a chance.
---
Wraiths won‚Äôt happen because it would be banned in a couple countries
---
what a handsome boy
---
Actually if you wanna be technicaly the term "bg" should be used in these situations.
---
Netflix has done some pretty good stuff I agree with you, I could totally see them being the ones to do this if it ever becomes a thing.
---
If the teammate doesn‚Äôt care about bad hook decisions then they‚Äôre not gonna run BT lol
---
Lol no prob
---
then how are streamers supposed to keep 
---
doing 50 or whatever escapes in a row?
---
Thats why I main him
---
Legion can blow up a pallet in two kicks, even David King can't do that, definitely some dark hax goin' on
---
Correct
---
I started playing a few days ago. I have gotten more angry messages from other players than any other game I played. I even switch targets mid-chase and still get called out for "tunneling".
---
I love this idea but what about stealth killers with no TR?
---
hawkins lab, i cant find a single totem there
---
Wooahh this is so cool ~~ you‚Äôre so talented !! The colors work so nicely together def underrated!
---
Survivor: That's illegal.
---
Killer: So is killing.
---
Yup, very much looking forward to dedicated servers so they can implement their ragequitter punishments.  It's become an epidemic on both sides and these douchebags receive next to no punishment for doing so.  It gets promoted way too much in posts around here too.
---
Literally anybody, I haven't played killer since the reset.
---
I just think it‚Äôs shitty that an anti ‚Äútoxic‚Äù perk can be countered by being even more ‚Äútoxic.‚Äù I only use the word toxic for lack of a better word.
---
It‚Äôs odd because I‚Äôve seen people use the splinter and they get a bunch of perks like bbq and nurse‚Äôs calling. I‚Äôve only used a splinter once but I didn‚Äôt get any perks myself
---
It used to be like that!? You senior citizens had everything, huh?
---
Maybe.
---
I just really want a werewolf or vampire killer already.
---
in high ranks on ps4 theres not much at all maybe 5% of players but in low ranks 10 and below (via rank reset) there like 45% of all matches face campers
---
I play killer more than survivor these days. It's way less annoying from the "Killers perspective" If someone dc's you atleast get the satisfaction of making someone baby rage. You also atleast get more points than the survivors who are both now well and truly fucked. You also get options. Do I wanna farm with them and probably double pip and gain hella BP? YOU CAN CHOOSE THAT OPTION. Do I just wanna finish the game quickly and requeue cause I wanna only win/gain BP vs people not dcing? I CAN CHOOSE ANOTHER OPTION! Guess what the survivors option is? Be So fucking good that 1 person can knockout ruin and 5 gens while praying the other survivor is so good he can loop for 5 gens + ruin and also praying the killer is dumb enough to chase them the whole time. Yeah no options from that side oh and you get way less BP oh yeah and you don't get anything for the survivors dcing.. yet :)
---
I let him kill me because I didnt deserve life
---
I‚Äôm not that familiar with resident evil. Apart from being from japan, how is it anime? I‚Äôd confuse it with a western game pretty easily.
---
So if I understand correctly:
---
1. There are several piles of gear scaps around the map which survivors have to find. Each survivor may collect up to 20 gears in a single trip before their pockets are full. 
---
2. To collect all 20 gears in a single trip it'll take a survivor 15 seconds.
---
3. Only 4 of the 7 gens are unlocked at the start of the trial. To unlock one of the locked gens, you must repair one of the opened gens with your gears. 
---
4. 50 gears are needed to complete each gen, so unless two survivors are on a single gen it will take:
---
- Three trips to a gear pile for a single survivor to complete the same gen. 
---
- One extra trip to the scrap pile for two survivors who are working on the same gen.
---
- No extra trips for three survivors who are working on the same gen.
---
Ideally if survivors constantly re-fill their gear scraps they'll have some left over so that extra trips may not be required.
---
5. Failing a skill check removes 5 gens and may require you to refill your spaces if you cannot complete it, but won't take away from another survivor's gear count. To complete a gen requires 75 seconds for a single survivor, less for several survivors.
---
6. Complete 5 gens and escape through the exit door or hatch.
---
If this is all correct, then hmmm. I think I like it, and I'm a difficult guy to please when it comes to these sort of things. 
---
I like how you personally are punished for failing a skill check and not others. If they use more gears, they should get more credit for the gen and more points, while you should spend more time getting gears.
---
I also like that it gives survivors something extra do which would in turn MAY move Ruin out of the meta for killers. I could easily see PGTW/Surge/Corrupt Intervention/Overcharge immediately being as good of an alternative over Ruin for high tier killers.
---
Questions: 
---
- Does each scrap pile have a limited amount of gears, or is each infinite? Ideally I would only have three scrap piles around the map (two on opposite corners of the map, and one in the basement). Each scrap pile containing 100 gears each which is six gens worth.
---
- I assume the killer can interrupt the gear collection progress and chase away the survivor(s) from the pile. But if the killer were to have on Franklin's Demise, would the survivor drop their gears? And if so, would the gears then return to their original piles or stay on the ground where they were hit?
---
- What is the max extra time that Ruin could add to the repair time of a gen?
---
- Does a survivor keep their gears even when hooked? And does the gears drop to the ground when they are sacrificed, or do the dead survivors take it with them?
---
- What role does toolboxes play in this? Would toolboxes only speed up the gear consumption (since it'll make gen repair faster)?
---
They can keep doing 50 escapes in a row, just not by exploitation of game mechanics/using underhanded tactics.
---
And if not, they can go play Civ V instead.
---
you can still swing and force them to miss DS ????
---
So you are going to, with a straight face, claim that you haven't been hit by something you didn't see or away from a loop that is in a different part of the map?
---
And they are two different things
---
True.  True.
---
Very true, although I do understand the reasoning behind maining one or the other as everybody has their own preferences.
---
I don't take up the flair adept pig for nothing xD. Of my 2000ish hours like at least 1200 are pure pig hours.
---
Yeah Stridor fucks me up more than it helps. I'd rather just make a mental note they have Iron Will and adjust my phase reads accordingly
---
Play meh nea as survivor and play any play any chainsaw killer
---
You are all lucky, i am rank 1 both and my life is fucking dogshit
---
&gt;you might level Nea for urban evasion anyway
---
Unlikely if they have a brain.
---
I play daily on PS4. I only very rarely see facecamping. Very very rarely. My friend who plays daily and only plays survivor also tells me he never sees it.
---
Thanks mate, I spat out my coffee in public
---
imagine how hot it is being chased by myers while hearing his high heels steps.
---
Yup I misread it, im re-approving it
---
80 percent? Bullshit.
---
FUCK THE MATCHMAKING, I SHOULDNT HAVE TO PLAY WITH RANK 20 TEAMMATES WHEN IM RANK FUCKING 15
---
Pretty much the "in case of Doctor" perk
---
I eat the DS on purpose and let them sprint away while i patrol gens so it does it‚Äôs job, it‚Äôs a power move.
---
I'd prefer Negan as a survivor personally! Just give him a perk to pull out Lucille and whack a killer to stun once a match.
---
TBH tho, Nemesis would work a lot better as a killer.
---
Sorry for the mis-remove, I misread the point and put the post back up
---
Not really, if the skillcheck is early enough in the ring, the killer is still locked inside of the pickup animation and cant do anything about it, by the time they swing, the skill check has already been succeeded
---
I had to read the title two times because I missed the "devour" part at first
---
‚ÄúMori someone with Wraith‚Äù. Bitch, my bing bong is lvl 5. No way I'm leveling him up to God knows what level to get a Mori. The worst? It appears everytime
---
Well doesn't have to be for free... Maybe they could let us buy them with shards, as it works with some skins
---
my friend reports killer every game he looses for being "toxic". I'm just going to start reporting him
---
These are some cancerous perks
---
He was being sarcastic silly
---
"Bro I cant find any totems"
---
"Oh my fucking god the killer has them in the chests"
---
"gen rush when you're playing everyone except spirit, nurse or billy? Just bring ruin"
---
This would be a hilarious perk not gonna lie
---
The shrine is good but I wouldn't waste my shards on it lol. I know spirit fury can be quite good but it isn't for me. Balanced and Unnerving are good (IMO) but they are both perks you can get on free survivors. Open-Handed is garbage.
---
everything else shouldn't be disregarded, even in the context of DS, BT, etc. not existing, you are leaving 2-3 survivors unchecked for an extended period of time to complete all the gens really quickly. If you constantly bounce between survivors and make sure they are all some form of downed, hooked, or in chase, they will slow down a lot more on gens.
---
The killer's most efficient way of making the game easier is making sure as much survivors are occupied on something other than gens as long as possible, that isn't going to be done if they focus on 1 survivor, i.e. tunnel.
