So this is how it ends, is it? Really, with all the .5 memes, there's been way more than 100.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty upsetting topic, I wanna make sure no one‚Äôs upset about no Survivor or Map too much.  We all should be rightfully upset, I put my piece of proof on this thread somewhere.
---
;(
---
I love that last one
---
That's pretty smart, props to you on that.  But I'm saving up for a new gaming PC and both will take too much time. I am allowed outside but thank you for the advice
---
I never really commented on your work, for obvious reasons, but I can happily say you're the example of what memes should be. Effort, hard work and putting your own spin on things rather than just relying on a Spongebob screencap with Impact font plastered on top pooped out in 30 seconds to the effect of "Killers/Survivors r bad, amirite guiz?!"
---
Pretty sure nurse and hag are the same
---
I'm still gonna get it because Ghostface is my baby in terms of slashers. But we cant blame em that's two expensive licenses one for a mask another for movie. We know they tried.
---
There isnt a solid logic. They can criticize something you do then you can logically explain it and instead of understanding they usually double down on being dumb.
---
Wait, since when can the hatch be closed?
---
Uh. So. Are you saying you *want* a hatch standoff? Cause that‚Äôs how you get hatch standoffs. Those are even more annoying.
---
When your chasing a surv and you realize they are going to sandbag someone.

---
Thief: the Metal Age was scary.
---
[removed]
---
tbh a bedazzled flashlight would look great
---
Obviously if you were good you wouldn‚Äôt even need perks /s
---
The hatch still doesn‚Äôt open by itself until there is only one survivor left. If the killer closes it, a Key will still open it again.
---
You could say the blood web.... bled out?
---
15 percent faster vault speed to everyone is ridiculous.
---
My favorite is how almost everyone complains about NOED and calls it toxic, meanwhile every group of survivors has 4x Adrenaline...
---
tbf yeah it kind of is if you suicide on hook, maybe remove vault speed
---
Ok thats good to know then, I wish they would have shown that better because their videos did not show anything about it.
---
I once had a survivor message to tell me to stop hiding in lockers.  The lockers were to counter BBQ &amp; Chili.. WHICH THEY HAD.  Asshole.
---
I once escaped twice with Quentin. Once with the hatch and once without. Hours later I was playing Jake and the achievement popped midgame ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

From what we understand, Freddys rework is going to be a complete redesgin of his power from the ground up, not just a mechiances change.

I know they both are being worked on, but its likely a licnesling thing.

Like for Bill, its up to Vavle.

MCote is a really good dev who was even kind to OchiDO, one of the people who fuels the community‚Äôs dislike of the devs, after OchiDO donated bits to try and get unbanned on MCote‚Äôs Stream.  He deserves more credit than he gets.
---
I find using kindred has increased my chances of surviving quite a lot
---
Playing with a new character is tough, yes. 
---
This is why I save up BP ahead of time to powerlevel a new killer or survivor. If that‚Äôs not possible, honestly, save yourself the frustration and continue playing with your main until you‚Äôve gotten enough BP to level the new character.
---
The devs said they still want the dream world to play a factor in Freddy‚Äôs Power.
---
That leads to utter silence and shame on their part.
---
No doubt I hate how much these devs get bashed. These people care about their game have since launch. They are trying their damn hardest to make their game successful and fun. So we need to cut them some slack. MCote seems like such a great guy
---
Honestly I‚Äôd rather my teammates hide in lockers rather than hide behind a rock
---
Wait what are you on? This legit happened to me more than that i used my shards in the shrine to get 150k bp new glitch i guess?
---
im sure some of it is intentional. like clown being a traveling circus, so he happens to be chilling in crotus penn, but still. even if it makes sense lorewise, does that not make you feel it could be the slightest bit of an excuse to reuse?
---
DONT U HAVE PHONES???
---
I would much rather deal with hope than adrenaline.
---
It's not crying of soft killers it's a question of bad gamedesign. And things like that won't help anyone of the playerbase.
---
*Sob* Mommy they hurt my feelings
---
*Cry in baby claudette*
---
Nope. I dont have an issue with them being a bit lazy and doing things, game development is rather hard after all.
---
this would be EPIC!
---
omg your such a baby claudette
---
If that actually happened to me i would love it, thats applause worthy right there, one game when i was survivor a wraith was being a real cunt all game and i just knew he had noed, cleansed all dulls and when the gates powered he ran right up behind me breathing down my neck nodding and spinning, *whap,* thats when he realised what has happened, 4 man out the gate and he was furious lol, this was a rank 16 too so hadnt been around long enough to learn why you you dont be an asshole.
---
How about a Scary Terry variant, bitch?
---
Not at all. The fact that he was shirtless made it even better
---
he‚Äôs really the best game director we can ask for and we really don‚Äôt deserve him
---
Honestly cant change my mind its him and Ed Boon as my favorite game developers
---
happens.
---
I‚Äôd still say they‚Äôre balanced. Of course someone who‚Äôs really good will always win. That doesn‚Äôt make one side unbalanced towards the other. Someone could use a balanced gun in CoD and have 1000 hrs and he would destroy people. That doesn‚Äôt make that gun unbalanced
---
Spirit is cool
---
Or could be how much BhVR is losing everyday that the game goes unchecked with bugs!
---
*Wahh mommy huntress she‚Äôs bully meeee*
---
It happens, try to completely hide from the killer when you break it. I know exactly how you feel man
---
I believe there's some amount of predictability to the perks on the bloodweb. The perk you don't pick is more likely to show up on the next web, or something along those lines. Just speculation though.
---
THE CLAUDETTE STARTED IT IM JUST A PIGEON
---
These are absolutely adorable, amazing work!! Keep it up ü§ó
---
oh yeah, i just included the perks, silly of me to write. thanks for letting me know
---
I feel like he should be in charge of communicating with the community instead of Not_Queen, I understand she works hard, but knowing your information is coming straight from the Game Director is so much more comforting than some sidechick who doesn‚Äôt even talk into the cam in dev streams.  i like her, but c‚Äômon girl, look at your viewers!
---
Dead Meat would be a great perk for my "I'm always getting fucked over and tunneled to death build"
---
This one killer I faced brought 4 hex totems and they were all gone before done with 3 gens.
---
it‚Äôs annoying because other survivors are usually outlined in *yellow* unless downed or on the hook
---
I agree I respect all the devs and like all of them but by far my favorites have to be MCote and Louis
---
I'm in the process of extracting the perk templates from the game at the moment because I'm picky and wanted the most authentic basis off which to make custom perks; I too am surprised no-one else has done it already. 
---
That said, these are a pretty nice alternative.
---
Sad that that's the route you have to take due to extreme levels of toxicity.
---
Golden Chainsaw could work if it was something like on death hook, you could be Mori'd even if the killer doesn't have one, and you get a point boost in general for running it. It'd be like No Mither but more fun for everyone involved. You effectively are using up a perk slot without a penalty as massive as No Mither, you get bonus points, and the killer (and you if you prefer being Mori'd over death-hooked) gets to Mori you once you're effectively out of the game anyway.
---
The Main Building design of recent maps like Father Campbell‚Äôs Chapel, Ormond, and Temple of Purgation are what they should strive for.  Good for Balanced Landing and Lithe, while still emanating a dark presence.  My only complaint with Temple of Purgation is the pit that yeets you into the basement.
---
Survivors: "I'm going to bring every perk and item that is powerful!" 
---
Also Survivors: "OMG KILLER IS SO TRASH HE BROUGHT POWERFUL PERKS AND ADDONS!"
---
I just want to know why it isn't flaired as shitpost so I don't have to see it in hex memeless mode.
---
Lery‚Äôs is also a pain for killers like Billy, LF, and Fred.
---
Same thing here but was playing against Dr and I was avoiding madness AND had done 2 gens already, This Meg in full madness ran the killer to my locker.  He seemed confused why she did this so he didn‚Äôt hook me and let me go.   Some Survivors are so ignorant I almost wish we had point tallys on each other in game under our names so they could see who has done what and who has just hid rock to rock all match and done nothing. (ahem, probably Claudette)
---
bless you. true altruism is far better sportsmanship than hustling for rank and leaving teammates behind
---
Don‚Äôt nerf Hag, she‚Äôs already got a shortage of traps.  Ruin is balanced considering it barely ever gets a good totem spot and can be countered by Stakeout or just hitting your skillchecks.
---
I couldn't really say for sure as I've never really dedicated that much time to animating videos longer than 30 seconds. But a buddy of mine whom I met on Reddit has been making really cool stuff that inspires me to go through my animations a bit slower and hopefully develop my own style.
---
Recognize your audience and what they react to- and how they react. Maybe you need to approach with a different tone. There‚Äôs a bunch of variables, honestly. I think there‚Äôs a fair amount of people that want to discuss mechanics and designs- but there‚Äôs also a lot of *other* people that just want to discuss shirtless Myers. I‚Äôd be down for a lore discussion.
---
There was a WIP version of it called Last Standing.  Someone made a James A. Janisse survivor concept and they made a perk called ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Get to the Kills!‚Äù it‚Äôs essentially Left Behind but GOOD.
---
Kindred is a MUST for solo play.
---
The best solo perks are:
---
Premonition, Empathy, Bond, Kindred (NECESSARY) and Dark Sense

Hmm, fair point
---
It happens a lot. Tunnelling also changed from "focusing on one survivor from their first chase until they're dead" to "downing a survivor without abandoning the chase for any number of reasons" like an uninjured ally being nearby. Especially around legion.
---
That pallet was definitely down before the hit
---
Faceless Freddy is a Nightmare Fuel
---
They aren't immortal, the killers can die and are kept separate from each other when not in a trial for that very reason.
---
The whole point of Survivor is to make tough decisions. Without some sort of delay mechanism, an exit gate at 99% is a risk-free bonus: it's already an open gate, because there's a negligible time difference between opening it/running through and just running through. What I'm proposing isn't even that much additional time--just one more thing to consider before going ahead with that strategy. Without the Endgame Collapse at your back, the threat needs to be there, because the whole point of the EGC is a call to survivors: "shit or get off the pot."
---
Furthermore, a killer opening the gate is almost always tantamount to a concession: "let's get this over with." Why would a killer facilitate an escape, unless it's absolutely necessary? Blood Warden isn't always going to be that successful.
---
Because you don‚Äôt play killer and that‚Äôs obvious.
---
That would be a cool feature!
---
The alternative is them just DCing my dude
---
in my opinion mettle of man should only be available for 60 seconds then the perk deactivates
---
If this Myers skin came out I would buy it in a heartbeat and become a Myers main
---
I play every day lmao, in fact trapper is my main. Never had the problem your describing. You have to buy more addons yeah, but why do you act like that is crippling your BP? I have no idea what your trying to describe.
---
The different flavors of water is based on its temperature.

I have hidden in a locker to dodge BBQ just for the person to suicide on the hook ;^; like bruh, I'll come getcha after BBQ goes away...
---
These are amazing and I love them.
---
At least credit your source
---
Dude. You literally have to sink 4-7 mil BP in each killer to get all the meta perks because each killer is different. For survivors, you need to sink all your BPs into one survivor and your done unless you want to play different skin. 
---
This isn‚Äôt an opinion, it‚Äôs well known and survivor mains like you never seem to grasp the concept. Killer is a BP sink. Huge difference.
---
he looks like the guy from crypt tv
---
Okay so basically; I can only purchase the licensed ones with money, and I can't purchase the whole chapter (both characters) with the Auric cells, just one of the characters. Did I get that right?
---
depends, some rooms her traps blend really well but others they stick out like a sore thumb
---
Its cheaper and better to buy on the store (since you also get an alternative costume for the survivor)
---
But you can indeed, if you want, buy the killer and survivor with auric cells or shards in the game
---
Just remember all maps are free, and the killer and survivor perks will eventually appear in the shrine of secrets
---
Yes, very common bug. Usually happens when a SWF group of 2 gets paired with a solo survivor. I don't know why, but once one person leaves, it fixes it.
---
Okay! Thank you!
---
Laurie is pretty toxic, she literally came with ds (thank god they nerfed btw)
---
Yeah but there are a ton of vaults and you can also trap the stairs and catch those balanced landing users.
---
I don't want item cosmetics, but I do want different items to look different. Not every toolbox should look the same!
---
Honestly, it depends on the situation.
---
If there's no lockers and BBQ isn't active at the moment, it might be a good idea to Urban around a rock. Not too many people seem to circle rocks to check for Survivors.
---
If there's a locker, just use the locker and save yourself the hassle (might be a slightly worse idea against Huntress and definitely against Iron Maiden)
---
If there's no locker and BBQ gets procked, good fucking luck, man
---
Was posted a week a go.
---
Fake
---
Bill is on one of the screenshots, to bad Valve only allows him on PC.
---
Look at the console version.
---
I mean Tapp sure but Lauries are usually toxic, she's the mother of DS.
---
And then there's the Spirit who just fucking stabs it.

Freddy rework... please bhvr... You've promised for months now...

The current meta is

Mettle of man, adrenaline, dead hard, borrow time
---
But for me the most fun build as a solo survivor is
---
Dance with me, lithe, urban evasion and iron will
---
But you should go for whatever is your playstyle and find something that is both fun and good
---
Good luck

The female killers are **done** with this shit.
---
And this is why people run Iron Maiden or play Doc.

It's like that for a reason. Play a no-perk pig game or something, you'll get a 4 SWF stacking toolboxes on thompson house and gens are done in 180 seconds

\^ Billy in the hit stages of his animation, pallet still up.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/UU3B1wg.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UU3B1wg.jpg)
---
\^ 5 frames later, pallet drops
---
[https://i.imgur.com/zP2DcqF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zP2DcqF.jpg)
---
\^ 9 frames after that, pallet animation completes, you get your medkit back, and you begin to transition to the dying position
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The frames I give are frames in the video, not necessarily in-game frames. The only problem I see is that Billy's in-game model is clearly short of making contact. This is either an issue with the model not properly following the killer's camera or some other rendering issue. I have been in his position many times and I can tell you it didn't stop him from entering the pallet area on his screen. It lets you go through and get the hit and just teleports you back out when it drops. I did not see the Billy teleport back in the footage, so it looks like the issue is the game refusing to move the model into the pallet area.
---
I'm not OP, so it's not *my* statement. 
---
And who's to say they didn't do that?
---
What do you think the entity's Realm really is?
---
Would make more sense to have Hoffman in.
---
They do! They're also a NSFW artist, if you like them donate to their patreon

---
Insidious is a Purple perk, given Myers is only level 30, the only purple perk the game can pull for in that case may just be Insidious.
---
This is actually a decent way to weed out perks you don't want, example; If you want BBQ 1, empty the Yellow perk pool by getting a bunch of yellow perks. To get BBQ 2, empty the green perk pool by getting all the green ones you can, and etc.
---
If the killer didn't bring a mori then that would make the survivor unkillable.

---
I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs inevitable you‚Äôll come across someone depipping.
---
Monitor is great on spirit. Her TR becomes 16 meters when not in a chase, so you don't even need the phase to sneak up on people. When you are in a chase it increases to 32 meters as well, so you can backtrack and phase to somebody working on a gen nearby without them hearing the phase as well.

I love Kindred! I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just unlucky or if it‚Äôs rank-related, but I‚Äôve been using it all day and still been watching all 3 teammates rush to save me lol. 
---
I mean the point is map awareness so people can keep doing gens if someone‚Äôs already saving, right?
---
Happens to me ALL the time it‚Äôs bullshit and it will take my shit too!!!
---
Bunny Feng is a **must**
---
Groovy baby
---
Was he calling you a crackhead..? Or does that mean something else?
---
You should let them heal you off the hook. It's faster than running away and healing.
---
Many times its better to heal at the hook. If they have a medkit or were gonna live forever then it's best to heal then and there, so long as you dont see the killer approaching.
---
She's in shock that she survived xD
---
My current build that‚Äôs been doing me well is: **Self Care / WGLF** (this is my flex slot, so I‚Äôll swap it out for perks like **Small Game** for totem hunting or **Bond**) **/ Lithe / Urban Evasion**. I‚Äôm a predominantly solo survivor and I may change the build around a bit, but this one I‚Äôve had the most success with so far.
---
That‚Äôs because of the animation of it- they did a developer stream and mentioned they were gonna fix it so it doesn‚Äôt feel so sluggish
---
I want a gun holster and glasses!!!!!
---
It‚Äôs better to heal immediately so they‚Äôre actually being smarter than you are. That is unless everyone knows the killer is close and coming back in which case run from there
---
we DESERVE decisive gunshot
---
Oh I totally get the draw for SC, hell I use it on occasion; I typically have more success with Prem, but that‚Äôs just my own playstyle.
---
"As soon as the Exit Gate is opened, *Blood Warden* is activated." Not that confusing. The gate needs to be open when you hook someone, not just available to be opened for BW to work.
---
[In case you wanted to see it with audio.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W0w5oGVwJ_Q)
---
Killers have longer que times than survivors on PC, low killer population is only an issue on PS4 and XBOX because they are so much worse and huntress, nurse and hag to an extent are unplayable so there is also less diversity.
---
welcome to the *real* DBD grind
---
The solution is simple, isn't it, though? Just buy a perk, regardless of how good or bad it is, for each bloodweb to increase the chance of the desired perks appearing.
---
It's a whole $7 what a stupid thing to be a crybaby about.
---
1- you have to run a game slowing perk. Ruin, corrupt intervention or whatever you fansy because trapper has to waste time placing traps.
---
2- always use add ons. More specifically extra traps. Trapper is very add on reliant, and he only starts with 1 trap. He needs add ons
---
3-always try to hide your traps. Place your traps around grass where it will be hidden
---
4-always trap super strong loops and infinites. The Ironworks of misery window, rancid abbatoirs window, shack window and pretty much any super strong pallet /window. Learn the maps to know where to place your traps and understand where survivors will go. Playing survivor yourself can help you with this
---
5.if you hate placing traps in the beginning then hook someone THEN trap around them. Always try to hook and herd survivors into areas where you have your traps placed
---
&gt;Supernatural killers with incredible powers
---
&gt;Clown
---
He's an asshole that throws bottles, but ok. Unless being stupid fat and able ro keep up with the likes of Meg and Nea is also supernatural.
---
They're gonna fix it? That's great.
---
It is dead right now, but I feel it‚Äôll get better once it fully launches.
---
Less if it isn‚Äôt a full chapter
---
For the spirit the tip i give you is, if she stands still on a loop, allways go to the next loop opposite to her direction because:  
---
1.She can be faking it.  
---
2.She can be going to you invisible.  
---
Running to the next loop works because she can't see you, and the sounds are bugged on the current version, they are really low when they shouldn't be. Concluding you will most likely get to another loop safely to keep looping her.
---
Ah, I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well
---
Everyone says just open it yourself. That's great if you're right there, but walking across half the map to smack a 99ed gate gives up anyone you have on the hook and basically allows everyone to leave out the OTHER 99ed gate uncontested.
---
The whole point of egc is to put a timer on leaving, not to exploit the mechanics to stick around as long as you like anyway. Id love to see them regress slowly when not held.
---
Speed is how fast you do something
---
Efficiency is how many charges it takes to do that something
---
For Example:
---
So if usually took 100 seconds to do something and you increased the speed it would only take 80 seconds now.
---
If doing something for 100 seconds required 100 charges and you increased the efficiency it would only take 80 charges to do something for 100 seconds.
---
I LOVE chibi wraith and nurse!
---
Yeah. It sucks.
---
Or just start the egc when there's 1 survivor who hasn't got 2 gens done. It's still fucking hard to open a gate, but you don't deserve hatch for doing nothing.
---
Enduring is getting nerfed soon on a hotfix they will do, it will only affect pallet stuns now.
---
Ok, so long story short. This group was T-Bagging at pallets, insta-heal, etc. I was playing as Michael. So, the gens are done and exit gates are open. I hook the Nea (the group is two Claudettes, Adam, and Nea). I keep my T3 ready to proc, to secure my kill. So, I down the Adam and Claudette 1. Nea dies, so I hook Adam and Claudette gets picked up. Both Claudettes sit at the exit gate T-Bagging and clicking a flashlight. Claudette 2 (the one who messaged me) tries to be cute and hide behind the wall. I have T3 procced, so I pretend to go for Claudette 1, but fake her out and down Claudette 2, hook and kill her. She proceeds to message me with this. Even more messages than this to come :)
---
I think LB
---
Depends on the one using the wood
---
Use whatever button you have bound for skillchecks while healing and not getting a skillcheck.
---
I just respond with ‚Äúyeah, outplayed me. Good job‚Äù because people like this clearly need the positive reinforcement because they weren‚Äôt held as children.
---
Looks good. 
---
Be careful tho he might be cheating on you with the queen Thiccness Jane
---
Yeah, then after eating off her own leg she hops a bit further on her remaining leg only for that to get beat trapped aswell
---
I mean, its supposed to make it so that whoever finds the hatch first wins, and if someone closes a door while you're trying to go through it, the door pushes you out
---
Seems more people play survivor than killer, so kill trophies would lack. Most people who play Dwight are newbies and don't do well. Usually hide in containers and sacrificed right off the bat. Min, well, she's always the sacrifice. No one wins with Min.
---
Same here. Two things that really make me laugh about her scream:
---
- when she gets grabbed off a locker 
---
- when she gets downed/hooked and you hear the dc audio right after. I don't know why but the two together just make me laugh.
---
tier 1 be like
---
ahh, thanks
---
We‚Äôll find out, my guess is that they‚Äôll redo events with new objectives and such and reuse the offerings people still have
---
Indeed, but that doasn't disprove my point, i said they wouldn't do a separated Dev build only for ghostface, so with that in it is possible that ghostface can be a paragraph, and its possible for him to be a part of a full chapter aswell. Another thing that makes me think there won't be a survivor and a map is that there was nothing about either of them in the dev build. Yes you could argue that the offering found within the dev build (The one with the school hat) is related to ghostface, but that image existed a long time ago with the concept of "The teacher" killer that was scrapped, so it's a bit unreliable to use that as definitive proof that there will be a map and a survivor. Another thing is that ghostface is almost done in the dev build, so much that he is playable on it. On my opinion, with this level of progress they would have started making the map and survivor already, yet dataminers found no model inside the dev build. Anyway, either if its a paragraph or a chapter, i will insta buy it and enjoy it XD.
---
thank you
---
Pro tip just buy every tier 3 perk you see once you grab it it's gone for good.
---
Is the timer running out before you can use it? It has a time limit after being unhooked of 40/50/60 seconds
---
Ok. I‚Äôm gonna tell you something that‚Äôs gonna blow your mind, you ready? Get this. The community for this game is really bad! To some people doing so little as playing the game as intended is considered scummy! It‚Äôs never they‚Äôre fault for anything because there‚Äôs always a bigger man responsible for it all! There‚Äôs not a single thing you can do in DBD without someone somewhere getting pissed off about it.
---
I've never understood the reaction to T-bagging. You would think a collective of players who constantly call the other side crybabies wouldn't get triggered by crouch spamming but hey...I knew what kind of community I'd have to disavow when I signed up to main killer....
---
I have no idea to be honest. Maybe he meant "cracker"? I was Myers, he's pretty white actually.
---
i would love the leatherface one. that black jacket blowing in the wind while he‚Äôs running down the path is my favorite scene in the movie
---
It does say that at the beginning of a match they're instantly consumed, but it doesn't make it fair when you can't even use it. I'm happy enough to be able to keep my items, but offerings should be included too.
---
There's a one minute timer that starts after you get unhooked. Once it reaches zero, you can't get the skillcheck anymore.
---
You forgot NOED
---
Killer main here, stop your crying we finally are rewarded for finding the hatch first.
---
When it says 'kill' it means using a mori/killing by own hand, not sacrifice
---
Feeling shellshock right now
---
&gt; they were just crouching at the hook
---
Survivors should vacate the hook and not run immediately to the nearest Pig box or Plague fountain, because that's where the killer will find a stupid person. What they're asking you to do is to reward them for questionable play.
---
Don't mind it. Unless you've decided you have a hard-on for someone, you're not tunneling. They're either unlucky, lazy, or bad.
---
They should keep the bodies and have a separate hook animation for dc survivors where they instantly die on hook no unhook, no struggle animation just instant death and rising up animation.
---
I hope you're right and they're just kids that will grow out of it. On a more positive note, another guy from the same match sent me a "gg" even though he died. It was a 20+ minute battle for the gens and he apparently had fun.
---
Oh, that‚Äôs nice to know. That‚Äôs about most of what it‚Äôs good for outside of niche perks, so I‚Äôm fine with that.
---
Not actually sure, someone had just suggested it on my Discord and I've had it saved for a little while now.
---
Yeah, but I try not to play "toxic." I understand there's a lot of things that are ridiculous/out there to expect of either side, but I don't intentionally play to piss people off.
---
Zoomed in on the salty chat and lmao
---
Bond, kindred and alert are all super helpful. Bond helps you know where all your teammates are which can help you heal them, get healed or help them fix a gen. Kindred helps your teammates not screw up and all go for the save, and be aware if the killer is close. Alert helps you know where the killer is at all times, and know which pallets and gens got kicked
---
I don't think so. One time I got unhooked in the basement and knocked back down while jumping out of the window of the shack and got immediately picked up and I still couldn't do it.

Only perk I dislike is NOED.
---
Won‚Äôt use it as a killer (I play more killer then survivor) 
---
I like Dh because 1. No camping 2. Playing well 3. The whole totem thing.
---
Dwight is in trouble, Bill is barely able to save him. But Myers comes out with a plank of wood to make Dwight fall.
---
Watch painreliever videos, he uses SC like a boss. He convinced me this is the best perk LOL
---
Some people just find the Adept achievements pointless.
---
 [This'n here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aoxigq/why_use_drake_when_you_can_f_i_n_g_e_r_g_u_n_s/)
---
Aye that's not hard if you got the prestige on a killer, plus adept survivor is piss easy you just try till you get a farmer.
---
I would love old man Myers. Mostly because I love the new mask more then the others. 
---
For Leatherface I would like to get all survivor faces that are in game.
---
&lt;3
---
&gt;Plague is kinda OP, she can literally stop people from using generators(she can vomit on them) and if she is close enough to someone she can one shot them.
---
Plague is literally like one of the low tier killers but lmao ok
---
&gt;I believe that the spirit is a little bit OP,
---
This is not an unpopular opinion. She is considered comparable to Nurse in terms of strength level, just in different ways.
---
Speed is how fast you do it. Efficiency is how quickly you consume toolbox charges. 
---
Think about the socket swivels basically being streetwise for that item. You reduce consumption rate.
---
Ya I like it, I'll keep an eye out for suggestion posts for leavers and spread the word.
---
Here's a tip. Use your own rules for what is and isn't toxic, and dont care about what others say.
---
that is on him for not leaving the hook
---
This too.
---
Most people play with perks they like.they won't care to play with perks they should use for trophies.
---
I imagine the only people with those sorts of trophies are trophy hunters. Exact reason I got them.
---
Nurse uses her left hand to slam dunk it, hag uses her right hand to swipe it.
---
The thing is, Leatherface should have been stalled to add Kate to the DLC and we could have gotten a different survivor for The Clown.  Leatherface was rushed, he was a surprise, and he was left with no map to dwell in and no survivor to slaughter.
---
i‚Äôm a killer main who doesn‚Äôt own doctor and is kinda out of the loop with doctor strategies, what‚Äôs the 3-gen strat?
---
Eh most people usually have vaild complaints. Only once as killer did I ever receive a message calling me a camper, when in reality I only came back to the hook because I was chasing someone. I asked him after he sent that message to describe how I camped, but he never replied.
---
Anyone, Tunnelling is, imo, chasing 1 person and only ever going after 1 person, and hooking them until they die
---
Survivors don't need no love but I am ALL FOR the Doctor turning into Dr. Love in his sweet ass new bikini ;3c
---
I know I‚Äôm late but: easiest way to do this is to practice a new killer; sort of like a ‚Äútrial by fire‚Äù.
---
Do you know what an opinion is
---
Dang dude lol chill
---
No dude I'm serious. Plague has one of the lowest kill rates. You don't have to like her and you can find her frustrating, but she doesn't fit the bill of an OP killer. 
---
And as for Spirit, I'm only telling you that your opinion on her isn't unpopular. Even Spirit mains (hi, I'm one of them) will tell you she's insanely good if you know how to play her
---
TITLE CARD
---
My current Doctor build that seems to be working wonders for me is: **BBQ / Sloppy Butcher / Distressing / Coulrophobia**: instead of Ruin, use your large TR and the slow as fuck heals to delay the game, plus compounded with your innate abilities and you‚Äôre golden.
---
Spirit is very strong, the Plagggg is weak to me. A lot of survivors are just used to playing injured/broken in this post-Self Care world and she's so tall she makes some otherwise blind loops safer.  Most survivors also know to predict the 'respect the pallet and vomit over it' play.   In some respects I'd say she's the easiest killer to disrespect; you can see entire lobbies that just ignore her power and burn through the gens while sick.  I know some of you are doing well with the Plague, but that's probably just because you're good at Killer and not so much because the Plagggg is good.
---
Same here! I stopped playing like 2 weeks after Spirit was released and I just started playing again today. Soooo much has changed!
---
how do you not look behind you for so long lmao
---
Without sound would just be scratched mirror Myers which is more terrifying :,)
---
Haha I used to a ton but always just barely missed a doorwayü§£
---
So dirty
---
I think most killers would break the pallet trying to vault it.
---
Have you tried tapping the Macabre Boxes as Claud?  
---
You might wanna try doing that
---
Personally, I believe that Spine Chill is a top tier perk. It does 3 important things for you
---
1) It lets you know if the killer is chasing you - The need to look back to keep track of the killer is an important skill, but in some maps that can be extremely dangerous [Game map]. Having the ability to not worry about looking behind you means you don't accidentally bump into walls and can extend the chase far longer
---
2) It's a mini Bond - Bond tells you what your teammates are doing. However, with SC, I noticed that if it goes off and on, more than likely your teammate is being chased and you can use that as a mini Bond. You know the killer is on your teammate, you know that your teammate is looping them, and that gives you confidence to continue working on that generator
---
3) Gives you a head start - SC has made my early game incredibly good simply because it lets me know if the killer is coming towards me. Some killers, such as Wraith and Spirit [with beads], don't really have a noise notification and can easily sneak up on you. With SC, I can crouch away and make it seem as though no one spawned there. They'll run to the other side of the map, and I'll finish my gen.
---
Spine Chill is an amazing perk. Adrenaline, Spine Chill, Balanced-Landing / Dead Hard, and Self-Care are my 4 main perks.
---
I'd say that Spirit with Wakazashi and Amulet is at Nurse level.  
---
She's unfun to go against, but manageable without those.  
---
(Prayer Beads is still complete BS)
---
They are doing that because now they wont need to balance every stun perk around enduring, that means that probably DS will get a stun time nerf now that enduring won't affect it.
---
He's right ya know, devs even said in a stream that plague is lower on the sides of total kills then others
---
You get the skill check before you can wiggle.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
where the entity kills the survivor from the ground? it's called the endgame collapse
---
What's that ?
---
As a Freddy main, I can safely say that I am excited, cautious, and sleepy
---
Now let me hit you with shomethin else.
---
Shhhhplinters.
---
*‚ÄùI had the honor of getting the announcement stripped from me‚Äù*
---
**WOW** what an absolute entitled cunt. First of all- it‚Äôs not like he did any fucking work to make the game- dude just made a lucky guess. Fuck him. And what an ungrateful fuckin way to put it- even added that snide-ass ‚Äúlol‚Äù
---
Why would that entitle you to free shit? In my opinion, when he was told he was gonna announce the new chapter- I feel like that was just a friendly thing the other guy told him- I didn‚Äôt believe he had the right to even disclose that stuff, let alone say some random can disclose it.
---
How am I supposed to chill when it happens so much 80% of the matches I play I see teammates do crap like that which gets em killed and that's not even getting into when teammates dc mid match which screws over the rest of the team
---
The boxes to get the RBTs off.
---
I guess so, I just prefer everyone in a match to have as good a time as possible. But thanks, and yeah, I understand I can't make everyone happy. But if people are gonna be salty no matter what, just let them be salty I guess :)
---
I like stealth and altruism, so I stick with Borrowed Time, We‚Äôll Make It, Urban Evasion, and Calm Spirit. I also really like Wake Up!, since you open exits faster.
---
Oh, thank you! I'll try doing that. I'll probably die laughing my ass off, but hey, worth it.
---
I can see how a team of 4 using MoM is a problem especially if they‚Äôre doing things to annoy a killer (bm and stuff). I feel like they should make it activate as an off-the-hook counter tunnel perk similar to borrowed time. Like it activates only if the killer hasn‚Äôt hooked another survivor type thing.
---
I find survivor much more relaxing than killer.  
---
Maybe it's because I try to do better when I play killer, but survivor's pretty chill to me.
---
&gt;The whole point of survivor is to make tough decisions. Without some sort of delay mechanism, an exit gate at 99% is a risk-free bonus: it's already an open gate, because there's a negligible time difference between opening it/running through and just running through
---
And 99%ing the door is one of the tough decision that they choose to make. Chances are they made that decision because people are hooked that they feel like they can risk saving or they need more time because of something like NOED. Both of those cases are far from risk free in general, on top of them stopping at the door to open it. That one second can be the difference between life and death. Only a small few are going to 99% the door then go galavanting around the map for funzies. 
---
&gt;Furthermore, a killer opening the gate is almost always tantamount to a concession: "let's get this over with."
---
No way. Far from it. Unless the Survivors are in a 4 man SWF and can ask "did you open the door" or can physically see the killer open the door, survivors have no idea if it was the killer or their team mate(s) opened it.
---
99% the door is a valid strategy and you can counter it instantly by hitting the door and create that panic that you are requesting.
---
Doctor is gonna have fun with this ‚Äúcheck up‚Äù
---
 #StopLegionAbuse
---
I would say Spine Chill is good. Especially starting out learning maps and killer weaknesses and such. It's a good perk to have on any survivor.
---
&gt;Adr has no real counter,
---
*Proceeds to list counters to adrenaline short of just killing them before the gens get done*
---
Damnit I'd just let all of them go. I would even ask them to hook me honestly.
---
What do you have against bHVR so much?
---
Are you going to update the pack as new killers and survivors are added?
---
I like sneaking tho...
---
&gt; I guess so, I just prefer everyone in a match to have as good a time as possible. But thanks
---
You're a killer. You're not a hired birthday clown with the sole purpose of making sure each survivor is having the optimal amount of fun. You're there to kill.
---
You say you don't play toxic -- yet you still received hate mail. There's no winning as a killer. It's you vs 4 of them. Just do you. Kill them all, in any way that works. If you go easy on them in any way, I would argue that you're disrupting the gameplay and preventing them from getting better at the game to overcome your playstyle.
---
Physical exam if you know what I mean
---
I find playing survivor more relaxing, In fact I think noobs hated Freddy because he made them suffer a lil bit of what a killer main has to endure on a regular basis and said it was unfun.
---
News: hoes mad
---
Never thought I would see buff shirtless wraith asking for a condom
---
I absolutely lost it at that last one
---
Yeah penis.........too direct?
---
Survivors always have the advantage due to them outnumbering the killer and the ability to do get chased, do gens, save people, etc.
---
He said Spine chill is a crutch perk? Lmao wait till it saves his ass against a Prayer Beads Spirit
---
idk, i always feel the hag is hit and miss. Like Hag can be good, she can be very good. But if you have one or two survivors just taking agro and springing traps, she can be really bad. Sure it means less survivors on gens but Hag is not a chaser, take away her power and whats she got?
---
Lol, I've done that with spirit many times too when survivors think they're out of the woods. They somehow never expect it.
---
I guess my concern is how the game is gonna register it, and if they would then add m2 attack‚Äôs such as chainsaws and hatchets. Otherwise it‚Äôs some work that‚Äôll be needed for a one time use perk.
---
I do think Monto brings up a good point on stuff. Especially the Ebony Mori. I've always agreed that more needs to be done if ur gonna be able to Mori everyone in the game. And I like his idea. You should have to hook every Survivior once before you can Mori any of them
---
It's just unnecessary. He wasn't being malicious at all, just messing around. To call him a dumbass and say that his "Idiocracy" makes you chuckle says a ton about your character. You don't even know the guy, man lol not everyone takes this game so seriously
---
Satisfying af
---
Well it can vary due to playstyles. 
---
I prefer stealth the killer never finds me or notices me. For that i recomend: distraction, distortion, spine chill and adrenaline. Bring a med kit with charge addons and just gen jockey and stay out of sight.
---
Now if your trying to be altruistic amd save people then: borrowed time, Mettle of man, we'll make it and solidarity. You can rescue without discrimation and it stacks for mettle while doing it. 
---
Now the runner build for being a chase or distraction: distraction, self heal, quick and quiet and lithe. I know this seems like a weird build for chasing its for run the killer for awhile and then quickly hiding and healing and then restarting a chase.
---
I also reconmend watching monto. He has some solid builds for multiple senarios.
---
Oh god. Dude please....
---
*Paragraphs*
---
There's no such thing as being too direct. Come here.
---
Who is this?
---
Whatcha doing in the spirit? ;)
---
I feel I have to get at least a 3k when I play killer, but I don't feel anxious when I'm playing. 
---
Frustrated, sometimes, when I can't catch people, and hatch-searching can be a bit nerving, but nothing comes close to the feeling of a killer chasing you and you can do jackshit about it.
---
I just got back from a killer game and it was blissful, I felt in control the entire time. Even when I'm playing killers I'm not really familiar with, I am not being hunted. Even aggressive survivors with instablinding flashlights, SWF and overly altruistic, I feel I can at least fight back. As a survivor, since I have close to zero experience, all I can so is run, run, run and run. I feel powerless, and that makes me anxious. It's why I don't play Outlast, for example, and hate the first 30 minutes of Resident Evil 7. Give me a fucking gun, for god's sake!
---
People run sole surviver?
---
Behaviour ruined it for him. He'd been promised by the owner of the scream mask license that he'd get the honour but Behaviour's leak ruined that. He did hint at it but there was no concrete evidence, therefore that is literally what he got screwed out of, not what he did
---
Who are the last ones?
---
Could you elaborate on that? What playing against a Freddy has in common with playing Killer? It's the only killer I don't have, so it's safe to say I played with/against him at most 3 times in my life.
---
exactly lol especially if you already know theres NOED
---
Pretty artwork, and I'd honestly love if Behavior promoted a great YouTube channel more directly. (As opposed to the Charity Case and what-not.) I also honestly think that a more "meta" horror-movie fan Survivor would be really fun. With that in mind üëè PERK üëè REVIEW üëè
---
* **Let's Get to The Kills!** - This is what Left Behind *should* do! With that in mind this is a really dangerous perk to make, especially with the faster repair speed when sacrificed. I think just the faster repair speed when a Survivor is killed is fine, and maybe increase the speed to 15% (max of 45%? Maybe a bit too OP but IDK) per sacrificed Survivor.
---
* **Dull Machete** - First of all the scaling on this is terrible, since it pretty much couldn't scale. Secondly an anti-Mori perk would be incredibly situational and incredibly unfun to deal with as Killer. Moris as a whole are a fairly unfun mechanic but printing a perk that reads "you can't be Moried xd" seems really unfun and would only really be effective if multiple Survivors ran it.  
---
That being said I'd maybe rework this to grant immunity to instadowns? I think having a token-based perk similar to Distortion that would make 1/2/3 instadowns instead just be a regular hit would be rather interesting as a counter to Billy, Myers, and NOED.
---
* **Final Girl Circuit** - Seems really gimmicky, not to mention that it would be stupidly hard to program. I think reworking Sole Survivor to provide faster Vaulting Speed and maybe faster Unhooking and Totem Cleansing (making a Survivor move at 105% is a slippery slope since the 110% Killers could be looped very easily. ~~Yeah Hope exists but that also brings up the fact that Hope along with this perk would be overpowered as shit~~) could be interesting. I have always wanted a perk to increase Vault speed that isn't Spine Chill and I'd maybe run Sole Survivor if it wasn't hot garbage.
---
* **Overall** - 6/10? Get to The Kills is essentially a reprint of Left Behind but made better, and is the best perk in this bundle. Final Girl sounds like a nightmare to program and Dull Machete needs a full rework. I think the concept is good and it does fit into a theme of a Survivor who's meant to Survive as long as possible and make up for dead teammates; kinda like what Laurie was meant to be with (new) Decisive and Sole Survivor. I don't think any of these perks *can't* be in the game but they do need a lot of work. LG2TK needs to be tested so the numbers aren't OP, FGS and DM need a rework but their core concepts are fine.
---
What are you talkin' about, dude? Nobody plays Tapp
---
I've seen this meme a lot. Can anybody tell me what is actually happening?
---
Sad clown noises
---
Yea totally top tier with noed and hatch camping.. cool
---
someone made a version of this with meg a few months after release I believe
---
Same here, though I've prestiged him too. I thought it was bugged until I got it on my Myers (Go figure)
---
idk, I feel hag is hit or miss. She can be good, she can be very good. But all it takes is a couple of smart survivors getting rid of her traps while she's chasing/hooking someone else to make her a really average killer.
---
I think you missed the point of the post entirely bro, it's just for shits n giggles
---
Tunneling is going after the person who was just on the hook.. that is it.
---
I don't know what I'm looking at but I'm glad I came for the quote alone
---
Her teachables aren't that great, and her ability is a little situational to get the most out of it, but she is overall pretty fun.
---
If you're looking for someone effective? not really, unless you can mind game.
---
That's a really cool strategy I'd never thought of, ties into the set amount of specific rarities determined by the guy doing the bloodweb tests. Not easy to pull off, but would probably work the best
---
Seems I did
---
Really need to get out of that habit I seem to miss important stuff which should be obvious to everyone else
---
He means in a match, not a loading screen
---
My main when I started were wraith and freddy.
---
I still play wraith and freddy a good bit, but I've shifted towards legion and the pig recently.
---
Myers because I like his different builds and he‚Äôs a fairly simple killer in chases
---
Plague is weak af... just don't cleanse... if you dont give her the corrupt vomit she ain't shit. When my squad goes agaisnt her, we wait until theres 1 or no gens left or if you're on your death hook to cleanse..
---
I don‚Äôt have a main play all of them.
---
It's to organize your thoughts better. If you keep it all internal you can get stuck in a rut and then be unable to think clearly, whereas speaking out loud keeps your thoughts rolling and frees up some space to process the next logical move. Kind of like when you're reading and sometimes get stuck on a word for no reason, like it just won't process so you have to mouth it to clear the blockage
---
I told him about it and he wants to know if he can put in the gift card code? He dosen't want to use his mom's credit card

---
One of the easiest things to do with freddy is to never lose a survivor.
---
You can leave him behind but right after he'll be back next to you. So you don't get time to relax, you'll have to keep enduring him until he either hooks you, gets tired or escape. Which by no ways should be unfun, since you get the killer all for yourself, the other ones are the ones who don't get to play.
---
Don't we all
---
Jasmine Masters who is a hilarious drag queen was just chatting when he accidentally hit his balls. That‚Äôs what caused him to say ‚Äúand I oop‚Äù and is in too much pain to speak for several seconds.
---
Yep, that sums it up pretty well.
---
yep
---
Jasmine Masters. Queen of jush.
---
Does that improve anything?
---
Now this is epic!!!!
---
The first time I played survivor I was terrified and screamed a lot. Now that I know what I'm doing I'm not really scared. More like anxious? Idk but when I play survivor I'm generally anxious until I know I'm safe. When I play killer I'm calm and focused. I guess I'm different from the norm
---
On the other hand though OP made me realize that I don't think I've ever seen a toxic Tapp. At least it's not common enough that I remember it
---
Its not like your gonna go take the time to go follow the source or show any form of appreciation to the source. As for the ‚Äúsource‚Äù It was sent to me via DM from instagram and im pretty sure the source stole it from another source.
---
Just had a game with a chill spirit on console (Super rare, typically get camped) where I got chased almost all game with rancor up. It was so fun to run her around all match and i wasn't even mad when the last gen popped and I got mori'd. Sent her a message after the match and we had a good laugh about the game, it's the little things like a chill player that remind me of why i love this game.
---
I would say so. She's a very different killer compared to the rest and with the right add ons, she's fun as fuck to play. I've been playing a lot of Plag lately and my ideal strategy is to use add-ons that make her puke infect survivors faster. Her 3 perks aren't all that. I only use Corrupt Intervention because the gens that are blocked off for the first 2 mins make it easier to hunt people down and best case scenario get a few hooks. You have to be optimistic with the Plague tho. You can either have really amazing games or get your ass kicked. I've had both but nonetheless, I had fun.
---
Nurse and Huntress. I usually try n play all of them, but I come back to these two mostly, and Hillbilly.
---
It‚Äôs funny to think back at all the uproar from the community when they announced the changes. Turned out to be fantastic
---
Don‚Äôt cry and not keep up, within 2 weeks we‚Äôll have info
---
Same here. Just got her purple pigtails to match her purple lazer bears shirt. Lithe just speaks to me. Plus I always preemptively burn SB.
---
First time playing Huntress I missed every single throw 
---
Finally got to the end of the match and there's a wounded Dave right at the exit just pacing back and forth
---
Threw all but one of my hatches and missed
---
Finally got the last one to be a hit and managed to hook him, I was so happy so I had to record it
---
I would pay 20 bucks for it.
---
So they don‚Äôt bring something up and then do nothing with it for months on end?
---
I don't get it
---
didnt they literally just talk about the freddy rework on the dev update released like 3 days ago?
---
The hag was like YEET
---
Sick
---
Shes an excellent killer i would put her right behind billy in terms of best killers.
---
She is very good even without addons  and slows down the game with the cleansing and if they don't cleanse then its an easy 1 hit down.  Would recommend easily.(This is on PC tho)
---
From experience, getting a 4K with no perks or addons doesn't prevent survivors from being abusive in post game chat, actually feels like they are more abusive.
---
Top three for me are:
---
Plague
---
Myers
---
Billy
---
Trying to find the point like I'm looking for Waldo
---
I‚Äôll do you one better. Shirtless old man Myers
---
[You got us](https://imgur.com/kAXchtn)
---
Final girl circuit stacking with perks would be really fast vault speed I guess let's get to the kills would be fine but gens already go really fast by themselves.
---
I played a nurse game during the double bp event where I two hooked everyone then just slugged so they could escape. I had one survivor on the floor 5 times before they escaped, and they still trash talked me at the end.
---
This is on PC too btw so it might be different on console.
---
Better get the Booga mask
---
In absolutely zero tier lists is Plague to be above Spirit.
---
And Bubba above Hag? U good OP?
---
Okay the perks aren‚Äôt at all situational they‚Äôre pretty much objectives and things you do every game I misread I thought you said dull machete would be OP my bad
---
I can fap to this
---
this morning a killer killed 3 of us, had me downed, and took me right to the gate and signaled for me to wiggle and let me go ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
so tonight, i was Daddy Myers and paid it forward to my last survivor. i love this game so much
---
I hope so cause I want event items to grind for.
---
The numbers mason, what do they mean!!!
---
It‚Äôs sounds a bit different when he‚Äôs close to you I‚Äôve noticed. Idk if they‚Äôve changed it
---
I‚Äôd place Huntress and Spirit a tier higher, Michael a tier lower and clown two tiers lower.
---
Gotcha yea dull machete could use some work I always get kinda irked by these posts cause nobody comes up with cool stuff like this for killers
---
Unrelated to his ‚Äúbitch‚Äù comment;  run distressing rather than deerstalker.  I only run that with haunted ground. Speaking of haunted ground; Ruin, Haunted Ground, infectious fright, and deerstalker are absolutely disgusting if you want to end a game in 20 seconds. &lt;3
---
I mean it's not a bad list but is is kind of everywhere, I 100% agree with the S tier but I don't know how you could rank both Clown and Myers above Spirit, she is at the very least definitely better than Clown.
---
F
---
I say accurate if Clown and Spirit are switched.
---
I *need* Huntress to hook her axe under the lip of the lid and pull it closed, please
---
Thank you.
---
Plague, Michael and Clown are above Spirit? Spirit's better than Billy.  
---
Hag should be *at least* Huntress level, and Bubba should be closer to Wraith.
---
*janes boyfriend.
---
The only thing console changes is Huntress and Nurse.
---
Right and it takes a while to get there, plus everyone can just hide until it goes away. Spirit still trumps Michael imo.
---
I know how video games work, don‚Äôt you see a problem with only one person running an entire department? Especially Dave of all people lol
---
Hm, I might've missed out the video on that... may I ask for source on that? I'd like to take a look.
---
I always liked Feng's hook scream. Sounds like air leaking out of a balloon.
---
Still not reliable
---
I dont use it too much but its a somewhat popular perk.
---
I like Dave so its fine for me, I dont know how BHVR functions so ill leave it be
---
The Killer has no way of knowing for sure which survivor destroyed the totem unless he saw you breaking it.
---
But once ruin is done, sometimes games go south so fast that some people give up chasing new prey.
---
The sound of 3 gens getting completed in 5 seconds can do that to a person. \^\^
---
Happened to me too, hopefully they fix it.
---
Yes, run the perk that makes gens take 12 seconds longer.  
---
If everyone's injured, and alive.  
---
Huge delay.
---
there was a post on here about the code name being oman, like the rest of the full chapters, and ash‚Äôs code name was Ash and LF was Leatherface, so i‚Äôm very hopeful about a survivor and map. i‚Äôd be okay with a original survivor as long as it COULD be someone from the scream franchise. not an old killer, but someone closer to quentin or laurie

Ahhh and with this post goes all the good meme content from the sub. Now it‚Äôs just going to be generic shitty reaction pictures

I haven‚Äôt liked him since the way he handled Christmas 2016/7 (forget the year). I can‚Äôt stomach listening to any of the developers talk anyways. It‚Äôs all filler give or take a sentence or two, they barely know what they‚Äôre doing. I have hope though, clearly, it‚Äôs why I keep playing.
---
True but how often do you need that many heals? You're usually better off bringing a perk that can have more of an impact during the game.
---
I mean, to each their own, I just think it's boring to spend the entire game sneaking around being a gen jockey.
---
If the survivors Cleanse against you she‚Äôs right below billy with the A tiers like spirit huntress and some others, but if they don‚Äôt shes a normal m1 killer and is just mid tier
---
That was a fantastic song
---
Hah. Get fucked
---
Just gotta convince more people to use these SFM reformats. ;D I've seen a few others make their own stuff, so if we spread the love for SFM memes, more creators will step up, surely
---
thanks thats really insightful! :D
---
Not toxic, just unfun. And looking at perk list it's kinda obvious that devs realize that.
---
I feel like console players would have a completely different chart. Most console players suck with the nurse because their limited control makes it difficult to blink efficiently. It almost feels like an entirely different game tbh. Most killers feel way different on a controller and that's for the better and worse of some killers but mainly worse.
---
Yea, i dont want anal bead sprit with NOED/RUIN on top of 4 other perks sorry

---
Doc was my first main. Then huntress. Now I usually play Wraith, Freddy, Huntress or Spirit.
---
Is this actually from one of the movies?
---
I used to hang out on this subreddit back when there were like 20k people but I took a short break and then came back and all the good memes were gone
---
Mind games aren't a mechanic of the game. They can go either way and are usually more punishing towards killer as survivors have plenty of other opportunities. 
---
Windows counter Spirit's power easily unlike nurse who can teleport through, spirit has to walk around. 
---
Plague's 1 shot combo is super easy to pull off since the cool down in low and can be shot over low walls and gaps. 
---
I never said 115 was a must for top tier killers, its just a considerable factor in most killer's strength, I really don't know how you came to that conclusion.
---
Hags traps can be flaslighted, activated multiple times at different places and can easily be escaped with her slow movement speed.
---
Ya gotta trap 'em. Trap em with TotH so you'll always know (Hag is my favorite)
---
Thats just why i stopped playing survivor honestly
---
PLEASE GET THE DEVELOPER‚ÄôS ATTENTION. We don‚Äôt need ghostface, we need THIS üòÇ
---
Shut up Frank
---
Console killer but huntress is A tier and might be s tier if the hitbox change is in her favour
---
I wouldn't say most complaints are valid, but I agree with you for the most part. Some people just get so triggered by losing in any way that they honestly shouldn't be playing this game.
---
And to you as well.
---
Since you asked so nicely :) 
---
1. Always be doing something. Fixing gens, opening boxes, healing/saving teammates etc. This is how you gain BP as a survivor. You can always tell how much a survivor contributed to a game by their end game bp. One exception to this is when a survivor is tunneled or chased for the entire game. They may even escape but because they were being chased the whole time they don't have much BP and can even de-pip. 
---
2. Pay attention to survivor icons. If someone is being chased it's usually a good time to be on a gen or making a save. DON'T be the immersed survivor crouching around not doing anything when someone is visibly(or not) being chased. This wastes the precious time bought by the survivor bring chased.
---
3. Know your surroundings. VERY IMPORTANT. You must get in the habit of looking for pallets, windows, drop-offs, gates, etc. ALL OF THE TIME. Getting in this habit will save your ass for a 1000 games. When approaching a gen, is there a pallet or window nearby?
---
4. Have fun! Don't get tilted when shit goes south for you and you alone, and trust me it will happen. Some people go out of their way to ruin the fun for strangers, but the *LESS* immersed you are when you play this game, the more fun you will have in the end.
---
I don't feel like it's overpowered, but it's just a lot going on. The tokens shouldn't be doing all these different things.
---
Sure you don't, that is if everyone is infected all at the same time. In which that scenario makes you think why is that a bad thing.
---
This is fucking golden
---
That may be true but that isn't my point exactly. What I am saying is that killers as the host will always have favor between two conflicting events. A common example is on latency when a survivor fast vaults through a window and is beyond the reach of the killer would then get registered as being hit when they probably shouldn't have. Why? Perhaps it's because the killer is the host and anything that happens on their screen is final. No disputes.
---
You get the skill check as your are picked up. Tier 3 gives you 60 seconds to get picked up. You should double check to make sure you are running the perk.
---
I have been rank 1 as a [survivor](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/956343206372913019/A0216F53E168A0F411D4822F458D140DE10895AA/) and killer before and am currently hovering between purple and red ranks because of all of the first down DCs. I still don't see this "gg ez baby killer" that people talk about. Sorry my experience is different I guess.
---
Then round your values before you display them
---
I find it a lot more chill than killer. But I was the same way when I first switched to survivor, it was stressful as hell. But once you learn the loops and get s survivor with some good perks it's a lot less stressful.
---
Yes in the first movie he wore this to kill a teenager that was about to have sex with her boyfriend
---
i prefer the blonde hair mask
---
Wait, I didn't know I already post on this thread.
---
Some people think that tunneling is "going after someone who just got unhooked". Wrong. You dont have to find a new target and pretend they dont exist just because they just got unhooked. That's some bullshit survivor "fair play" rule. If someone gets unhooked near you, knock down the unhooked person and chase the farmer. "Tunneling" is when you're getting hyper focused on one person and actively seek them out over all others. If they just fall in your lap or are super easy to find, they can't blame you for that. They'll still try to blame you regardless so ve ready fo mr that.
---
Salty people are salty and can't handle losing. Play in a way that's fun for you, try not to be a dick, and make your steam profile private. Trying to make sure other people have fun will stress you out. This community is too illogical for that kind of mindset.
---
I killed a dude the other day and got a message saying "go suk a dick and die from chemo"
---
I was like 'Survivors are so nice!'
---
if even one survivor escapes i see it as a win for the survivors
---
The King and TydeTime have done some videos. They're a bit older, and they are killer mains, but they still know what they're talking about, albeit it a bit biased towards certain things. Otherwise, just watching some gameplay videos and playing with friends helps. Most of the game will just be practice and muscle memory though
---
Obviously, if you want to be a killer main, those work out perfectly
---
Not sure if outright sexist or just really not funny....
---
The neon clothes are really cute, but try to avoid them, you will want to blend with the background as much as you can. Try to pick her shorts with stocking and one of the more bland shirts.
---
First main: Huntress
---
Now, I frequently main Pig, Trapper, and Huntress.
---
I started playing when Myers was released but didn't really play killer a lot until Huntress was released.
---
Freddy put survivors in s constant state of anxiety and stress because they couldn't escape him. Survivor mains aren't used to that and fail to realize that red ranks as a killer can  damn near give you an aneurysm depending on the match.
---
Thank you! Ya I wanna work on that comic later.
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
No, I just suck complete ass
---
The best part ;)
---
Thank you! üòä
---
Did I say that no? I did say on his perkless addonless fucking r2r1 videos he does not play wraith perkless and addonless after green ranks. You can call me whatever you want shit doesn't matter I'll happily clip the video and send it to you
---
Thank you!
---
I'm highest level with the Clown. I was playing a few games as the Plague earlier and I think she'll be a good second choice. Wraith is also fun from time to time. I think I just gravitate toward killers I don't see often as a survivor.
---
Oh, if you play like that, you will never play them all. Not saying you have to, but it's a certain mindset.
---
You‚Äôre right!!!
---
Ladies and gentlemen. 
---
We have just discovered Bigfoot
---
Hahaha üòÇ I‚Äôm so glad you liked that!
---
I, for some weird fucking reason, really love jeffs injured noises and hook screams. I actually took off iron will on Jeff just to hear his injured noises
---
If you can stand to watch him, TydeTyme has quite a few guide videos (The Complete Survivor Guide and The General Killer Guide in particular) that I'm sure are pretty helpful about general tips, how to survive against or play as various Killers, etc. Ardetha does a series called the Dark Academy where he watches sent-in gameplay and gives tips on what they're doing wrong. Ussylis has some tutorial videos on specific topics like juking and using flashlights. Honestly, just watching any YouTuber or Twitch streamer will help you pick up the gist of the game.
---
As far as your actual question, I don't know that there's any super popular post or thread with tips for beginners. Once you've watched a bit of gameplay and get the gist of the game, though, a few Survivor tips from me:
---
1. Don't crouch and/or walk everywhere. When you run around, you leave scratch marks that are visible to the Killer, so a lot of newer players try to avoid running as much as possible. Don't. Especially at the very beginning of the game, run to get to a generator. If you know the Killer is chasing somebody else, run to get wherever you're going. It's much more efficient, and I've played too many games where I die on the hook because newer players were too scared to run to get to me on time.
---
2. Make sure you're always doing something. This might seem self explanatory but... a lot of people just kind of sit around. Survivors, when they're actively trying to complete gens, are stronger than the Killer. Try to always be working on a gen if you can be, don't waste a lot of time hiding just because the Killer might be around.
---
3. Do not "Attempt Escape" on your first hook. The tutorial kind of hints toward this, but a lot of new players do it, so just... don't. During the first stage of the sacrifice, you'll be given the option to try to take yourself off. However, the catch is that you only have a 4% chance of succeeding, and each time you fail, you'll speed up the sacrifice. Just wait for somebody to come unhook you instead. If you are absolutely certain nobody is coming to save you, you can do it, or if you're about to go into the second stage of the sacrifice, or if everybody is on a hook and it's your only chance of survival. Usually, though, it isn't worth it.
---
4. Quick vaults and sprinting into a locker give the Killer a notification. This should be kinda self explanatory, but for the most part, don't do it if you're not in a chase.
---
5. Learn to run while watching behind you during chases. This will be helpful for jukes, potentially using Dead Hard down the road, and just everything relating to chases in general. Keeping an eye on where the Killer is going will help you know where not to be.
---
I know that isn't a whole lot but I don't wanna throw any more text at you than I already have, so I'll just say if you have any questions (or want more tips from me lmao), hit me up! Good luck when the game comes in, and welcome to the fog. :)

Blackwatch from ‚ÄúOverwatch.‚Äù

What an original post that I have never seen before
---
The person who makes the lobby is always the host!
---
Hahaha haters ü§£
---
A **huntress** using NOED called you tryhard for running Small Game?  That's some bottom feeder level shit.
---
hey that's a naughty word ima have to kindly ask u to leave my sleepover
---
Ok, so Spirit, Hag and Huntress are clearly above Plague, Myers and Clown. Please stop living in TydeTyme's dreams where Plague, Clown and Myers are top tier and Spirit, Huntress and Hag are considered to be in the same tier as Cannibal or lower than him. Yeah, they are 110% movement speed killers, but that is because their powers actually help them in chase. 115% means nothing if your power doesn't help you in chases. Meanwhile, Clown is garbage against survivors who drop pallets earlier, Plague is garbage against survivors who don't cleanse and know how to loop her while injured and Myers is garbage against survivors who pay attention.
---
I think this is valid, but you can't deny how funny it is to look for that damn hatch dor so long and just die by bleedout when you get there. Honestly, I wouldn't change a thing.
---
Spirit, Pig, and Freddy all came with brand new maps. Personally I'd rather ha e the maps be in existing realms with added touches from new killers. The map offering pool is bloated enough as it is.
---
This happened to me when I played today, i heard and saw the smoke pouring from the hatch (couldn‚Äôt see it was in the swamp) and just was so close and I died it was breathtaking, literally.
---
Pretty controversial list, regardless I respect your opinion. I'm a pretty big clown fan but I personally wouldn't put him that high up so I'm interested, why do you think he is that high? Pretty curious to hear (or rather see) what you think.
---
Thanks
---
I'm actually a LoL player as well. DbD community until now seems WAYYYYYYY more friendly and less toxic than what I am used to in League.
---
Ok. Ty buddy.
---
I would pay 69 quid for the huntress ana bikini
---
Until Ghostface releases I'm main Trapper and Freddy.
---
Spine Chill counters hard just baby Spirits or Spirits who relies too much on Prayer Beads. And almost nobody runs Spine Chill in high ranks, it's not a popular perk at all.
---
And Clown's power can be countered without needing a perk, by just droping pallets earlier.
---
How do I like something twice?
---
Seriously, this is a no brainer yet they couldn't think of it.
---
I wouldn't listen to Tyde
---
First main was wraith. It's fun thinking about a time when survivors thought he was overpowered. Shifted to nurse after that and now I main Michael. I switch back to the nurse occasionally if I want to have a sweaty game and farm some salt.
---
i had a game with a doc, and he was basically chasing me around for a while and just messed around and as i ran &amp; vaulted over a pallet, i started like circling around and he did the same after he broke the pallet. he later killed some of the survivors and only let me go and he let me fix the gens and win the game later.. i had to msg him just saying thank you for being so kind. what a lad.
---
But... but...
---
Nice idea with the survivor faces. But what about claudette. Isn't that black facing? Lol.
---
Then there would be duplication of very good items abused - equip skeleton key with both Purple addons for example and waste a Purple offering to get another 3 very good items (item and 2 addons) and you can easily get more as at higher bloodwebs its common really
---
ok u can stay but u gotta be nice you fuckIN MEAN‚Äî
---
jk ily
---
The Birch would be a cool killer too, although maybe she's too aesthetically similar to the Hag.
---
Nothing beats the in depth and very understandable words of OhTofu. I love his pallet video, shit taught me some good stuff. I think TydeTyme has good enough beginner survivor/killer videos. But I hiiiiiighly recommend OhTofu once you know how the game generally works.
---
Except torb is **way** better for this mode in his current state, mercy's old rez wasn't necessary and was really not much more than a get out of jail free card for mistakes you might've made while her current ult actually has some good value. Tracer and reinhardt are pretty much unchanged other than minor balance changes.
---
Cool, you can cheese hatch if you get to the hatch game (if you find it first).
---
Doesn't help you kill the first three people to get there in the first place, so Wraith is still low tier.
---
Are we talkin‚Äô liberal feminism or radical feminism? Do you even know the difference?
---
It aint wrong
---
Jokes on you i dont run noed
---
no why? I'm an fps player and I always loved to have maximum Fov in games.
---
Spooky
---
Holy shit ily
---
I started out as Michael, but now I play mostly Billy, with the occasional spirit and rarely nurse. Keep in mind I play on console. RIP.
---
on PC the game has a built in chat system so there is really no escaping it
---
So it‚Äôs a shitty clown?
---
ah, you are the best killer in the game huh.
---
I really cant understand, There are so many people here who hate Coldwind but at the same time You would play it against twitch swf? HYPOCRITES
---
never seen a laurie being toxic at me, mostly toxic characters i see are David, Claudette and Meg
---
The amount of recent Raimimemes makes me so happy. I want Toby McGuire to be a survivor and "cool" toby to be a killer
---
As a wraith main I find this hilarious! ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
so what if i have adrenaline, borrowed time, balanced landing, and MoM? you have noed!! baby killer crutch perk git gud /s
---
I agree with @PickCollins0330 100% on this, I‚Äôm a Plague and Spirit main and I see a huge difference in who wins more often, I can destroy every chase just about with Spirit but with the plague I just get looped for days I have to obey how tall she is and how when I get close to generators all survivors literally have seen me 10 seconds ago and all left, it‚Äôs like people actually follow the rules of stay away from the plague to the core; speaking of Black Death. It‚Äôs insane how short spirit games are for me, literally so much potential with her in the right hands.
---
Idk about King but Tydetyme is not a good source for learning
---
Combing from the transsexual cup
---
I find way less salty assholes in DBD than I did in that shithole tbh
---
"you damn swf"
---
1. No Tydetyme, trust me.
---
2. There's tons of streamers on twitch; JenDenise, OhTofu, ScottJund, ZubatLEL, Ryanpez come to mind, they're all very good players.
---
I'm pretty sure you can hide the chat.
---
Thank you üòÑüòÑüòÑ
---
Plague, Myers and Clown are literally trash compared to Spirit, Hag and Huntress
---
My first killer main was the doctor.
---
then it was Freddy, right now I am using a lot Legion and Billy.
---
It's weird for me. Doesn't Even use the offerings. Just sapped My addons.
---
1. Min is not very popular, and only has 1 really good perk, is less you like Alert, so survival is hard.
---
2. Ever tried to get a 4 Moro without anyone quitting or getting hatch? I have. Not fun.
---
3. For Dwight, same as Feng.
---
4. People can just use 1 character they like and p3 it. It only took me 2 months to 3-50 my Nea from start.
---
She alright
---
Spirit legion?
---
I just enjoy playing with friends. We can make a joke of killers being scummy, and not care about our ranks. We just have a good time as friends.
---
I played my first 30 hours exclusively as Myers, then I swapped to Doctor.
---
Now I play Doctor, Nurse, Billy, Hag and Huntress mostly.
---
How is Plague A tier AND stronger than Billy?
---
And how is Hag D, lol
---
Leave post game chat immediately?
---
Find a group of people to play with all the time, 4 man swfs are the best way to play this game! Just be a wholesome person first and focus on your team making sure everyone is happy, it‚Äôll make the toxic community 1 step closer to being a non-toxic community. I have a few friends I play with every time I hop on and it just makes the experience 10x better. And honestly ignore haters they don‚Äôt deserve your attention. üòé
---
To be fair every killer rework so far hasn't really...  Changed how powerful the killer was.  Wraith is better but didn't really go up or down in power at all.  Legion is better but didn't go up or down in power at all (If you don't take the moonwalking legion into account).  I honestly don't have any hope of freddy being any better.
---
It's sadly how it is but if you act nice they will act nice back. Alot of toxic people I meant we're actually pretty nice just frustrated. I recommend just trying non meta shit and play who you want. Hell I'm playing Freddy and I'm having a blast.
---
ah yes, all three of them. i cant wait for it to turn out to be a nerf tho
---
You better watch out for his craps
---
I think not. That there is lag, don‚Äôt be alarmed no jump scares here üò¨üòÖ
---
Extremely positive.
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one. It just seems like an uncalled for shitty sfm that looks like garbage for a quick karma grab.
---
Me as killer:
---
Claudette with DH Adrenaline self care &amp; MOM after they DC:trash killer git gud noob go back to fortnite
---
Ussylis has good tutorials but only a few and some can be outdated tydetyme is alright. Also int3r4ct is a small channel that makes some great killer tutorials
---
People don't actively try to get them?
---
Oink and Hag
---
Its still not a reason to set clown higher than spirit. Spirit is better in any way. Clown is 1-2tiers below spirit.
---
Will Jake tell us what this means üòÖüòÇ
---
"This is no place for cowards"
---
Got a feeling or a test proving that? My p3 nurse doesnt get shit, my doc is kitted out
---
They should be "Nobody" and " No one at all".
---
Plague is completely fine wtf are you saying.
---
Spirit is at a point of "OP but not nerfable"
---
Noh
---
mori deny perk !! that's cool
---
Oof
---
Poor guy got downvoted even after using /s
---
Poor design mostly
---
Where can I see this data?
---
To be a 4k freddy gates can never open you have to have the fastest slashes of the west.
---
Last guy‚Äôs name is fitting
---
Yeah those are the consoles where this game is better for sure. If you were going to play this game for the next 5 years (as the dbd roadmap continues of course or longer)(?) It would be a great investment to move your interest to a pc or ps4, trust me, I love Xbox if it was good on there I would be playing it there.
---
Devs should fuckin change Left Behind for that then. LB is pretty useless right now, considering everyone has to die for it to activate.
---
Hahaha op is white ranks
---
Crouch one time. T-bagging is a sign of toxicity.

I too come from League. I quit a while ago. I can only be called racial, ableist slurs and told to kill myself so many times per day before it becomes boring.
---
Haha
---
Hey same! I've got 3 hours til my exams start and I still haven't slept
---
A good way I found out how to learn things is to watch popular/skilled streamers play the game. I'd watch my boyfriend play and I got a good feel for the game through that and picked up some pointers/skills from watching him too. Things like "Oh, why did you do that thing instead of the other thing?" "Well, usually blah blah blah" and it helped me understand.
---
Yeah but I imagine I could easily break a decently thick piece of wood if it was laid in front of me. Doesn't mean I won't need a second if someone fucking threw it at me
---
None have been announced as far as we know. I can only assume there might be one around Halloween or Christmas (which seems to be a thematic time for events in most games). 
---
As for 2x blood point events, I think those only happen...two times a year? Three times? It's rare.
---
Nice repost. Only about the 15th fucking time ive seen this. How original

I'm still learning killer, but I currently main Pig (I used to be a stealth assassin in my thousands of hours on Skyrim so the playstyle is very comfortable). I also really enjoy playing the Hag. I'm iffy on others still since I'm just dipping my toes in the water so to speak.
---
I just finished my legion cosplay and it turned out pretty good.
---
Yeah i did mine on saturday
---
I‚Äôll never understand why people don‚Äôt use their brain when playing this game
---
It‚Äôs okay, acceptance is the first step on the road to recovery.
---
Excellent edition, I‚Äôd totally wear it
---
there is nothing in the game that does both of those things
---
you may be talking about the pig's traps which used to instakill people that escaped if not disarmed?
---
I feel like if the survivors collectively did a grand total of zero generators, none of them deserve to escape anyway.  The fact that the hatch can even spawn with a big fat zero generators running is already a pretty huge mercy if you ask me, so pardon me if I lack sympathy for survivors who did nothing not getting a second second chance.  Plus, the fact that it can spawn with zero gens done encourages both sides to act like assholes, since it makes slugging the only viable counter to selfish immersed survivors and it rewards selfish immersed survivors for doing nothing and allowing their comrades to die.  If they kept the 2 gen minimum for the hatch to spawn, then I might be cool with killers not getting some of their end game perks when the hatch is closed, but as it stands I feel like the mechanic is already cheesy enough without making it cheesier.
---
If the killer DCs with the leave match button, you keep your points/item. If they pull their plug or ALT-F4, you lose your points/item. Dedicated servers should fix this because killers won‚Äôt host games anymore.
---
I went ahead and made my own design on it instead of what is in the game. If want to see it, I just posted it.
---
The bad ones Tapped out
---
Very good mate, but I think you forgot to write the rare James A. Janisse teachable perk. I think
---
Dont worry, I can only shoot you 60 secs after being unhooked
---
&gt;trying to be toxic
---
&gt;all in good fun
---
pick one
---
Alright will have a look
---
(Cue Lego StarWars Yoda death scream)
---
Looks cool
---
Unintentionally it looks like the trapper a bit but oh well. Sorry if it seemed like I was promoting or something was trying to.
---
No worries, just don't let it get to you. I played legion and there was a Claudette who kept unhooking people in front of me, so I even didn't go after the hooked one, but after her and she still complained that I don't know how to play legion and that I shouldn't tunnel. I got my 2 pips and 4k so I couldn't care less lol.
---
Tunneling, imo, is considered going after only one survivor until they die, not trying to hit someone else.
---
As a freddy main. It pleases me that 3/5 of theses are for Fred boy
---
He told Paulie Esther he was just assuming there'd be a map and survivor.
---
It's the same thing with survivors lol you think that we wont Play meta perks after being tunnuled and face camp 5 games in a row?
---
Thanks man

Can she not hear the whooshing?
---
Is ps4 really better? I was waiting to move to a switch but I feel locked in. All my player experience is locked to xbox in my profile. I have bought all the killer dlc and even a couple of survivors. I dont want to play bad enough that i have to start my progress over. I'm really just starting to get good one survivor and I'm a pretty decent killer already. A cloud profile would be a godsend but it havent heard of it for any game.
---
Bunny Feng or Riot!!
---
I tried to get friends into this. It was just too hard and toxic at the starting levels.
---
I can get that. I would be a 100% fine with the 2 gen minimum making an appearance for this. I still have that rule hammered in my head anyways and always try to get at least 2 safety gens done quicklu, before I decide if I want to try running around a killer or grabbing some loot or something like that
---
Freddy, he could just send 2 people into the dream world and take them out one by one by sending in another killer when 1 wins. Totally a Freddy thing to do.
---
*stay maddddd
---
Idgaf
---
Lmfaoroflcopter
---
That would be interesting. I'm just sick of being left slugged as they shut hatch, so I'm literally just forced to sit there for 2 minutes til I either bleed out or end game kills me
---
They prob are tho
---
Billy for the one shots and movement and hag for the mind games and traps
---
Clown &gt; Spirit confirmed.
---
Also, I'm not even gonna get started on Bubba at B Tier.
---
Hmm. No.
---
r/woooosh
---
If you mean infinites then yea 
---
If you mean pallet loops in general then no. Just break the pallet
---
Why the unsolicited advice lol? You might like to play super immersed, but I wouldn't really be telling people not to wear cosmetics they like because you're afraid of chases.
---
So you can hear their hot groans ;)
---
Ah right
---
If you kick ice cream out of someone's hand, you can't expect them to be nice to you after that.
---
Thats not even what I said. Killer isn't dogshit but why the fuck is there gentleman rules for killers to play by but but not survivors you can use every perk you want to x4 but if a baby killer brings noed you shit on them. How fucking entitled are you and serious question if every killer main was Zubat would you even fucking play this game. From a normal dude sort your fucking self out mate. Xx
---
I thought this was obvious troll but already 2 responses so I guess I'm the asshole
---
Hag in the same tier as Herman... I'm done here.
---
So you play meta perks but complain when killer used them too? Or what's your point if not that?
---
Started as Nurse, then a bit of Huntress. Both were probably not the right killers to learn on, especially on console.
---
Now it's those two plus Spirit.
---
BEDSHEET MYERS
---
In about a month time there is the game anniversary, then we have summer so perhaps we'll get something, then we have halloween which we are 100% getting something, then Christmas and that's it for this year.
---
Darn, i left all my iridescent singles in the last trial.
---
I have been watching his channel since Friday the 13th part 3
---
Exactly, otherwise what is the point?
---
Freddy is. legion is pretty damn good now
---
Put on Thanataphobia, Nurses, and BBQ and you‚Äôll see why people run Sloppy on spirit.
---
Freddy isn't as bad as people say he is but he by far the worse killer in the game.
---
Sure it's not too different but I'd play dad-bod Myers 24/7 :)
---
Yeah... you've given me a new ship to hold... to...o cu...t...e
---
I also love it when I try to get around picking up useless perks by picking the other one and the useless perk just shows up again in the next 20 bloodwebs..... 
---
And then there's also times were I get good stuff like BBQ and Ruin offered at the same time at low level, so I pick bbq for faster bp gain, but afterwards, ruin is nowhere to be seen anymore for at least 40 bloodwebs.
---
Like.... k, thx entity.
---
I thought it humanised him too much. Myers is living breathing evil it's almost like he has no humanity left
---
Username checks out
---
Texas chainsaw remake leather face would be a cool addition, with that ridiculously OTT chainsaw
---
Whats wrong with them? Was using them last night and they seemed ok, slight delay on the acceleration but that's it
---
Yeah she's pretty good, but a Spirit playing well still can't hope to match a Nurse playing well.
---
* Spirit has a CD, Nurse doesn't.
---
* Spirit still has to walk, even if it's faster. Nurse just appears there nigh instantly.
---
* Spirit has to mindgame defences, but Nurse ignores them outright.
---
* Spirit needs to find some stairs, Nurse can go straight up.
---
* Sprit has to go around walls, Nurse goes through.
---
Nurse is just crazy.
---
You could take Legion and remove Deep Wounds entirely, just letting him kill somebody with two Frenzy stabs, and even though he'd be completely and utterly overpowered he'd still be slightly weaker than a Nurse playing at peak.

Be glad your team didn't let you get slugged by NOED and literally let you bleed to death after doing three gens and getting a rescue.

---
When I first picked up the game, I mained Myers. Since then, I have killers that I rotate through: Myers, Freddy, Leatherface, Pig, Trapper, Wraith, Doctor, and Clown.
---
Right now my main is Pig, but that changes on a constant basis as I do love to play all 8 of them. With the current survivor meta revolving around Mettle, Pig's ability to slow things down in the mid-game with the RBTs is really good. 
---
I don't play the top tier killers because the meta is already flooded with Billys, Spirits, and Nurses and I know when I play survivor, it's gets real old real quick facing those 3 over and over and over and over, so I like to bring some variety to the dance.
---
Freddy with infinity gauntlet
---
The rework we needed
---
Give ash his chainsaw and add on so that during the end game the killer has to run from him üòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks, didn't know that
---
Honestly I'm gonna go with leatherface. Nobody else has addons that doesn't even work.
---
Shirtless skin when? üëÄ
---
I mean the EGC is the way out. It's REALLY fucking degenerate but he's gonna get two kills for it guaranteed
---
this is exactly the fucking problem, blocking the hook, then bieng avle to have evrybody escape just because they have adreneline, the killer cant punish it, cant do anything about it either, its complete bs
---
It's risky but when it works it gets me heated too. Ive been taking iron grasp sometimes lately
---
No.
---
No such thing as an infinite anymore.  They were taken out of the game some time ago.
---
U are saying that every game, u have guys suiciding to block the hook and 1 guy ready to pop the gebs to give everyone adrenaline? I call bs
---
Freddy isnt as bad as most people make him out to be. I would sadly say bubba.
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
They can find keys in chests
---
not fun for the survivor, but a bullied killer will definitely smile after cheese downing someone who has looped them and t bagged all day
---
The real reason to run NOED, to be honest. It rarely nets me kills from people trying to open the gates or unhook someone who was already hooked before the gates were open, it mostly just lets me down teabaggers who don't know when to leave.
---
Whats with tier 1 evil within and M&amp;A? I dont get it
---
U would need to face at least 3 man swf (1 guy on gen, 1 guy gwtting carried, 1 guy blocking). From the data that BEhaviour has released, that happens in under 15% of games, let alone such scenario happening and all running adrenaline.
---
A key is the equivalent of a killer mori, both feel like you‚Äôve been cheated.
---
Irrelevant but I love carrying survivors to the hatch, giving them one last chance before closing it on them making them succumb to the fact that it‚Äôs too late for them.
---
that's two perks that don't even work till all gens are powered. can't you use that advantage to clear dull totems so both perks remain useless...?
---
Karma. Well deserved.
---
nearly every game, and not exactly but, i will get gen rushed and they will be done in like 3 mins, by that time i get 1 peraon down, then thier adreneline pops off, then i get them down, and then they body block the hook, using insta heals and borrowed time
---
Happy cake day.
---
Awww look at the baby Claud. Such toxic potential
---
No it really isn't.
---
"nobody would use that if..."
---
No, that is not why survivors are using that. they are using it because it's strong as fuck and will continue to do so.
---
downvoted when speaking fair and true
---
I understand that. Killer for me Is more relaxing but I still play survivor more.
---
That's why I see Plagues being looped so hard in red ranks. Because instant downs are so powerful. Without Corrupt Purge she is a M1 and loopable killer and She can't even do mind games because of how tall she is. She ia just mid tier, but that just because others killers sucks even more than her.
---
I'd main him
---
Because instead of vaulting the pallet for 1.7 seconds (base killer vault speed), you can also break it at 2.6 seconds. 
---
So you rather not break the pallets and allow the survivors to go back to the other side of the pallet while slowly vaulting it? How is that a buff?
---
I miss Kate's old screams. Literal balloon.
---
It throws off accuracy and there is no real reason to equip it on any killer other than Nurse for the fatigue.
---
And even on Nurse it's not that useful.
---
If you are **really** good with Huntress you can keep it (keep in mind it's only nice to look at, it doesn't give you any advantage and essentially you're playing with 3 perks), but if I were you I'd swap it with Nurse's Calling.
---
Nurse's is a must on Huntress, it's really useful.
---
Try it if you have time.
---
Trapper , legion , Freddy , wraith
---
As i mentioned, u need atleast 3 man swf for that and its in under 15% of games. When u down the 1st guy by the time all gens are done then u are not too good of a killer and i suggest u watch some streams or videos on youtube to learn (nobody was born a rank 1 killer). Borrowed time is a counter perk for camping. It is not used to be toxic, rather its used to prevent tunneling and camping just like the new ds.
---
Sweater Fans RISE UP!
---
honestly that is not what you should be doing as killer at all. you should be making sure survivors are staying off the main gens+as many as possible. if you just tunnel one you're letting 3 do as they please to middle gens, when your main goal is keeping them occupied with anything but gens and then kill them when you won't lose a middle gen. gen rushing doesn't exist if you don't tunnel
---
Try restarting the game
---
Well, just Trapper and Cannibal needs buffs more than Clown. Maybe even Legion.
---
The clown has pretty awful map presence, I wouldn‚Äôt put him so high, great fun to play as though.
---
lol no they werent.
---
you dont lose bloodlust, causing infinite loops to end.
---
B-but muh bathrobe Myers
---
I feel like he‚Äôs been referencing DBD a lot in his Leatherface videos and I love it! He would be a great survivor.
---
if you're ever in the position where you can instant down the rescuer and chase the injured, the game is basically already won
---
All killers on console would dc lol also i feel like playing survivor on console is so easy so this play just seems standard lol
---
I'm just starting to realize that teabagging other survivors is generally friendly communication. The first time I healed someone and they teabagged me after I was like 'Fuck you too then. Die next time.'
---
Hag rework made her amazing.
---
Lol I do the same thing during chases. It‚Äôs great xD
---
I‚Äôd always buy the dlc in case you get banned or something and your not spending any more money to get it bacc
---
Aside from watching content creators play the game which is the best way to learn how to play, there is also a website available to allow you to practice hitting skill checks to ensure you do not fail them. It shouldnt take you long and you might be able to learn how to hit greats consistently with practice which will help you out alot.

Kindred, Open-Handed, Bond, Windows Of Opportunity/Small Game/Plunderer's Instinct
---
Open-Handed makes your favorite perk even better, and it also improves Kindred - a perk especially good in solo, due to providing random survivors with crucial coordination and efficiency. And then Windows Of Opportunity as your chase perk choice, due to it also benefitting from Open-Handed. Or Small Game to double-down on the teamwork aspect, quickly finding Hexes. Plunderer's Instinct would also not be a bad choice, and likewise benefit from Open-Handed. If you are looking to be more serious about your build, the fourth perk could just be an Exhaustion perk of your choosing, but then Open-Handed would also not really be a perk to run.
---
no it doesn't. let's use logic here, noed has a counter, right? small game helps a lot eith countering noed... and noed is in 99% of games..
---
 so therefore, take small game and ez read counter noed. if you know someone's gonna use something then you should be fully prepared to counter it lol
---
I think OP got lost walking the 4chan border r/lostredditors
---
I dont get it. I mean highlighting the 16k points
---
I'm so happy cuz I'm a toxic meg, TOXIC MEG! AAAAHHHHHHHH
---
I play with 3 randoms most the time and damn they are toxic. I would have already done multiple totems, saves, gens, heals and then I hide in a locker for BBQ. 
---
So many people have the nerve to follow me and then just open the locker continuously during BBQ and won‚Äôt stop. I can‚Äôt even get out, because it‚Äôs blocked. Then the killer comedy over and pulls me out or I finally get unblocked as he‚Äôs showing up. 
---
I literally get in, count to 4, and come straight out. 
---
Not like the meg I had today who at least 5 separate times got in and stayed in lockers for most the match. (I can see her aura due to empathy.) in the end she died, and I lived. I had 22k, she only had 7k. My friend who died first had 13k. People are so dumb.
---
I don't think people can take it seriously saying black ops and competitively in the same sentence, but nice try
---
Nope, used up mine as I only have one and it was gone after
---
They literally only got nerfs besides a move speed buff, they are much worse
---
The stats post was nice, but it doesn't really paint a full picture.
---
~55% of players are solos, ~30% are duo, ~10% are 3's, and ~5% are full lobbies.
---
* You can't brush off that this means ~45% of players are in a SWF lobby, which definitely gives them an advantage over the solo players the game is balanced around. You don't need a 4 man to get this advantage.
---
* Only 5% of lobbies being a 4 man doesn't make it feel any more fair when it happens.
---
* It isn't split up by rank. Kinda important. A higher 4-man presence at rank 1 would go a long way to explaining the 60% escape rate for rank 2 survivors (ignoring the 80% at rank 1 since that data is kinda ruined by the methodology).
---
It's neat, but there's not enough data to draw any real conclusions.
---
Nope, I lost it as I only had one of that offering.
---
Hag is A
---
Bruh wtf since when is there an end game chat unless you mean pm‚Äôing survivors
---
that's what i do :/, i try to have fun and play the killers i want with the perks i want, i sit around rank 8-4. survivors will always say shit like ez game,baby killer, lmao get fucked, etc. while running tryhard meta builds. so I've just started playing nurse since its's the only thing that makes them shut up.
---
Once I got a team of nea‚Äôs got accused of tunnel-ing.
---
We demand bun bun feng
---
For the sake of my brain cells 
---
Why the fuck would you want this
---
Noice!
---
More SFM stuff!
---
Battle pass in a paid game? I'll pass
---
Yeah legion isnt good right now. Bottom three IMO
---
I would just like to say if your slugged and killer closes hatch adrenaline will proc and get you up it has only happened once and I didn't even escape but it was one of the funniest moments in the game for me
---
Tier lists are kinda out-done at this point. They're kinda pointless since it's always opinion.
---
For me, I'd argue that with MYC, Freddy can be devastating. Being able to track someone easily who can be downed in one hit has alot more potential to be potent and powerful than shocking people at pallets, throwing bottles at people or going to vom town.
---
All tier lists will never be right or wrong.
---
That'd be a downgrade for No Mither, since you'd not be able to use any perks like Mettle of Man or Dead Hard to avoid hits that'd down you.
---
What about Freddy snake?
---
And? You're just making excuses. Crediting your source is common courtesy, regardless of whether I check them out (which I occasionally do). You could have said "sent to my DM from Instagram". If you don't do it, then it makes it seem like it's your own original post.
---
I mean, Laurie brought us DS and it was for a long Time one of the moste hated Perks.
---
How can Laurie mains not be depicted as Toxic?
---
https://youtu.be/Cc6EtUJmfds
---
Pretty sure it's that
---
Agree, it's just really fucking rude not to give credit.
---
These perks are actually really nice concepts, especially the first one. A perk that offers posthumous benefits to your team is an interesting concept.
---
People will find a way to complain about anything honestly. You could run no perks, bad perks, off meta perks, Hell, you could run Monsterous Shrine only and eventually someone would call you a no skill fuck, so really I just ignore anyone saying anything rude cause the mental gymnastics people do are astounding.
---
Flashlight saves are nearly impossible these days and being able to heal yourself at that speed is much safer play. What do you mean by u cant use other items?
---
Flashlights are the worst item in the game?  
---
That's the only item that's counterable.
---
4 David Kings in the lobby wanting to be hooked. Davids in the basement loving hard doc. Dead by Daylight really rocks.
---
I've never seen Wraith or Billy have their own picture like the Trapper's
---
sorry, EGC?
---
If u bring an item u have to drop it to heal urself
---
Just don't bring other items?  
---
Medkits are pretty strong.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm sure the community who celebrated when Ochido was banned, and constantly talks bad about him for being so toxic will downvote you to oblivion for talking badly about Ochido.
---
But if u use selfcare and bring a toolbox, u dont waste any time. Flashlight was just an example of an item
---
The true horror is vertical filming
---
I am very sorry for doing this for you. 
---
(I'm actually not)
---
r/woosh
---
Pharmacy could also be used to farm green medkits :)
---
If you bring an item, why even bring Pharmacy?
---
Well theres ur answer, if i wanted to bring anything other than a medkit, i wouldnt need pharmacy and even with a medkit, why would i even need pharmacy.
---
Im telling you why self care is better...
---
anna ou
---
32 seconds per hit is pretty major.  
---
I don't think any toolbox can compensate for that.
---
I mostly watch TrU3Ta1ent on Youtube.
---
BTW what is not to like about Tyde? I like his videos a lot . Is his speech pattern ticking people off?
---
To stock up on med-kits. It's primarily a looting perk. My Quentin has over 25 Emergency Med-Kits at the moment.
---
I mean, old man Myers is pretty much the same. Great movie tho
---
You did your best
---
thats what I was thinking about,im sure there are some fanboys around though
---
My chases mostly last longer than it takes to finish a gen so i heal myself maybe 3 times per game and 1 of those heals is during the end game collapse. I get chased for 1.5mins and heal myself for another .5, thats 2 mins for the other 3 to do gens.
---
Looking at it now... I see how scary it is
---
I wouldnt say theyre the worst item in the game as that spot stands for maps, but yeah theyre mostly fucking useless.
---
With all the time you waste healing in a corner and not doing gens, why would you even need self care?
---
Hanzo user fits more. It's 2019, who complains about bastion anymore?
---
yeah,i love rewatching tru3 beating him with ease
---
Im more of a flashlight guy so whatever floats ue boat :) thats why there is more than 1 item in the game
---
I just find how he talks in videos to be really boring and hard to pay attention to, tbh. I prefer to watch people like No0b and Demi, the more ‚Äúmeme-y‚Äù types of YouTubers, if you will, so it‚Äôs just a matter of preference.
---
Speaking from experience, if you are new to the map scratchmarks will throw you off easily at this stair cases.
---
It does mean its better. Would u say that living in a jail where u get served the food u want is better than living at home and eating what is vurrently in ur fridge.
---
It took me seconds and then I- oop
---
Survivors : "why do killers always use meta perks?" 
---
Also Survivors : Adrenaline, Self Care, Mettle of Man, Dead Hard
---
Huh, dunno i never see anyone using it, or even mentioning it, from my rank (5) i almost never see bond.
---
Flashlights are still pretty shit.  
---
You being able to bring other items doesn't make self care better, it just allows for more varied playstyles.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests on mobile so idk if that link will work
---
Thank you! She‚Äôs so gorgeous
---
Not everybody uses sound as well as you + i can make chases with other people longer by saving.  
---
Wheb the killer is camping, i can blind him and rescue, i can then follow that guy and do a flashlight save.
---
But that isnt much faster than using selfcare. Plus i might be healing myself and somebody gets downed near me so i could save them with a flashlight using selfcare.
---
What the fuck is that analogy, my guy? It's clear I'm not gonna be able to get through to you. Enjoy wasting time with Self-Care. I assure you that every killer out there greatly appreciates your efforts to assist them.
---
Which is why selfcare is better, would u be chained up or free to move? I like playing dynamicly and being able to change my playstyle according to the situation.
---
I can see why you paired Billy with Plague, but I do struggle to see how their dynamic...  Works, considering the Plague's affliction.
---
Nothing turns me off of a game more than feeling like I *have* to play it. Timegated stuff is the reason I left Fortnite and I don't need to mention the shitshow that is Black Ops 4...
---
Why would judge perks not against the best killers(not saying I'm one of the "best")?
---
Now we just need Shirtless Myers and the quadfecta will be complete.
---
&gt;somebody gets downed near me so i could save them with a flashlight using selfcare
---
How does self care help you flashlight save? Wasting 32+ seconds is the worst thing you could do to your team, healing with pharmacy is 14 or 15 seconds.
---
But I literally just said that if you could buy it with Iridescent shards then it really wouldn't make much of a difference. 
---
Also BO and PUBG have battlepasses and they're both paid games. The notion that battle passes only exist within F2P games is false.
---
If u are saying that selfcare is more liberating but it takes longer to do 1 action that u have to do about 3 times per trial then i would say that selfcare is better.
---
Pharmacy helps u do 1 action faster and limits u to use other items. 
---
Ppl can use items that suit them the most so not here to force u to use selfcare, just saying why i prefer it.
---
Tru3 is terrible aswell, so its a bot vs bot fight
---
Watch this get a shit ton of downvotes.. but its true tho..
---
U cant use a flashlight when using pharmacy, u can use a flahslight when healing urself witg selfcare
---
That's preference, not which one is better.  
---
You preferring self-care doesn't make it better.
---
Same here. I usually end up leaving the post-game asap to avoid being flamed.
---
I don't think you can fuck up a battle pass system. BHVR also does their best and I really don't think you should blame them.
---
Sure they fuck up a lot sometimes, but I appreciate them for actually caring about the community and trying to help out as much as they can. The only reason I love this game is that there's always new content being pumped and the devs actually feel closer to the community than with other games.
---
I'm honestly more disappointed that most of it isn't even good...
---
I‚Äôm gonna draw their story later. Believe me, you would like it.
---
As annoying as Ochido is, and how repetitive his content is, he's an above average survivor. He knows how to juke, he knows how to loop, he can 360 (even when he played on PC) and he has good game knowledge. He's better than half the clips of survivors that get posted here of people who run in straight lines and don't even look behind them.
---
Ochido is a lot of things, but 'bad at playing survivor' is not one of them.
---
Quick maphs
---
Lets change the situation and bring a toolbox, i would do gens faster than the guy with pharmacy. We can bith heal ourselves, he can do it 20 sec faater but i can use items. Using pharmacy sounds kinda pointless to me.
---
Exactly
---
Its probably more profitable to sell cosmetics individually than to bundle them in a season pass thing.
---
I just told u why i prefer it, cuz its better. And i explained it. Please explain why pharmacy is better otger than healing 1/3rd of the speed of selfcare
---
what do you think about Ohmwrecker?
---
Freddy is still the worst killer. Bubba is a relatively close 2nd.
---
I think that in itself is an amazing argument against self care.  
---
Besides that, you can get free medkits :)
---
i didnt say he is bad
---
*vacuum noises intensify*
---
Wait, aren't you saying he's rank 20 trash?
---
Oooh I'm excited.  Take your time, but definitely tell me when you do it!!
---
he got beaten by a mediocre killer so he fell down instantly GET IT?ü§£
---
rank 20 is where he usually is anyway
---
Nerf Bastion!
---
=
---
^(*tbh i've never touched Overhype and never will*)
---
I'm absolute garbage at killer and only do daylies before returning to survivor. So, I have this post backwards, except instead of anxiety it's pure rage over not getting to do my daylies, because when I try I'm suck so bad I can't get them and when I clearly wanna cooperate with the survivors and help them, they act like absolute toxic garbage. 
---
All respect to Killers. That shit is bad for my health.
---
I prefer not having licensed killers.  
---
In my opinion, the best designed killers in both gameplay and visuals are the original killers, like Huntress.
---
wtf
---
Oh really? I was planning to get it myself since all the others I found was really terrible quality but that one looks amazing. I think I'll get the 1978 version though. Did you buy the clothes and knife as well or just the mask?
---
Still angry they nerfed pig while they have 3 s tier killers that are the only tryhard viable ones.
---
doctor and basically doctor only
---
I refuse to fear a killer who wears converse
---
I've seen and heard some dumb shit from him.
---
Like, when The Clown released or was on the test server, my friend told me Tru3 said The Clown should expose people without add-ons by hitting with the bottle. It might've even been that it should just down them.
---
Scattered like a bunch of cock roaches, should have just started zipping around like Billies always do.
---
When I see any killer main, maining Billy, to most casual easy to play as killer in the game.
---
Great, thanks
---
saboteur, streetwise and a toolbox with add-ons... business or pleasure?
---
Well.. to be fair, he isn‚Äôt out yet, so there is still a chance....
---
As a killer main and a tapp main when i play survivor, i can confirm that tapps are normally nice people, however lauries are normally toxic. I normally find that laurie, claud, david, nea and megs seem to be th toxoic survivors.
---
lol watch Vikings, everyone‚Äôs a fucking P3 survivor there
---
'How to play DBD on google'v does the trick :) and gameplay vids
---
Worst ending of a show i have ever seen. This whole season was such a mess.
---
Ha! I got that reference.
---
I dont know. I just want leatherface in a suit
---
Had a pig being really... iffy the whole game, but, since I ran small game and was used to every single killer running noed, cleansed all totems before the last gen. FF to her hitting a dumpster because her noed didn't proc and got really really upset in dms
---
LADS LADS LADS
---
Billy and Nurse, but I am planning to add Legion to my cool killer club lol
---
My first main was trapper.
---
Then I started to use Doctor.
---
But now I use pig.
---
I still use all of the others except for nurse and the dlc killers I don‚Äôt have.
---
I play survivor with this mindset 'Fu all, don't trust anyone, enable the hatch'  Hatch updated now so idk anymore but yeah, solo survivor to the core :D
---
They are still the worst devs of all time though. However, this is just because they're greedy bastards who refuse to hire more people.
---
You know almost 2 years ago they only had ONE person on the Big Fixing "team"?
---
And I hope to GOD they hired more, but I doubt it
---
It's pretty easy to look good when you play below your rank.
---
Welcome to the Cult of Hag brother and/or sister, we welcome you with open claw hands and many mud traps.
---
Blessed be the Hag...REEEEEEEEEE!!!!
---
I'd say it's actively ignoring other survivors to go after the recently unhooked one. If you get to the hook, follow some scratch marks and it ends up being the unhooked one, or if they just run straight into you, it's not really your fault
---
if you can get it wish shards then fair enough but I do doubt that would happen
---
Nah just a rage kid :D
---
This reminds me of Sonya Blade's MK4 ending XD
---
"Yep I'm bad, you got killed by a bad killer. How embarrassing."
---
I am concerned about the fact that nobody does a meme with bikini Huntress.
---
A THICC Russian girl with bikini, hello people.
---
It really do be that bad at this point...  
---
Happy cake day though!
---
Music if I don't care about the outcome being in my favor
---
You ask for bully when playing Plag.
---
Justice... has been served.
---
it's standard ofc, the whole timeline is the question. They must've known that MoM is OP as hell, what was their reason to add it.
---
dang, but you right. when I found out it is a farmer, I tunnel and facecamp that guy
---
He smurfs. He isn't above average. He's constantly at rank 15-20. Against purple to red ranks he wouldn't last a minute. Watch him play against someone like True Talent.
---
They need an entire patch to fix that. they can't hotfix that because of consoles
---
yeah, the loudest survirvor in the game, maybe jeff comes close.
---
Im sorry but how is mettle of man useful with no mither?
---
Not to make this sound too personal (since that was a bit aggressive) I wanna add that Tyde isn't a bad dude or anything, just tends to form some... "Interesting" observations based on the game and some questionable stuff such as the "literal murder" comment. 
---
He does contribute positively too, such as the tournaments he has organized have been pretty cool. But I just can't recommend him as a primsrh source for actually learning the game.
---
Knowing this made the Trapper comparison even better
---
That would be in character for ghost face, but can you imagine a spirit doing that from the teachable üòÇ
---
Not to be that guy or anything. 
---
Technically, the core mechanic is finishing the generator. Something that impacts the core mechanic would be a bug around being unable to finish the generator.
---
Yeah it's kind of heartbreaking as a killer main to play survivor occasionally and see a newer killer get bullied out the role or game even
---
I once got bamboozled while carrying a purple key. The survivor dropped their brown medkit next to me, and by instinct, I picked it up. They then stole my key and went on their merry way. 
---
Moral of the story: if you wanna steal something, offer something in return
---
Because you don‚Äôt trade real money for bloodpoints.
---
Do not speak of the dark one, demon
---
That‚Äôs it! I‚Äôm getting me mallet!
---
I love matches like this. You can almost hear the killer's dreams shatter.
---
Okay for LF it makes sense, his chainsaw is so fucking worthless.
---
Because you haven't met me yet :(
---
Yea he‚Äôs pretty bad unless you are using  certain addons. Add ons shouldn‚Äôt make or break a killer.
---
guys please don't fall for the jebait.
---
Inb4 they all get fucked by the doctor
---
Yup, especially considering it's a fucking purple add-on that makes him worth using
---
Freddy is objectively the weakest by far, Trapper 2nd worst and then Leatherface probably.
---
Since when has Zubat played nice...
---
I watch Zubat on the regular and I always see him slugging? He often denies free saves as well. 
---
They‚Äôre gods because they prioritize efficiency over anything else. No doubt a killer will play better if they play efficiently every single match.
---
No you just have to be good at DBD to get downs with them :)
---
On the other hand, you have face-camping Bubba's with award-winning chilli who get 2Ks and write GGEZ in post-game chat. Moral of the story, don't smoke when pregnant.
---
Everyone wanted it to mean something and now that it‚Äòs harder (meaning it means at least a bit more) people are bitching they can‚Äòt get back to high ranks again (which means it is likely they never should‚Äòve been there in the first place). 
---
A double pip should be a perfect game. It‚Äòs 2 rank ups.
---
A normal rank up means performing well. 
---
A black pip is equal to the old pip, you say it yourself, this means it‚Äòs basically free.
---
Freddy's rake/claws/thinner are "do nothing" as well as Huntress's hindered and the glowy bottles.
---
Glad to hear it. Love the videos by the way.
---
Why make a post if you‚Äôre just gonna tell everyone that disagrees with you ‚Äúopinion‚Äù as if that validates your post?
---
That's some cute trash right there.
---
Wait
---
Before I played Killer, I wanted to main Pig. Mainly because of how cute she is. Now I have her at level 20 and now main Freddy.     
---
Trapper and Freddy are my mains currently
---
Ok, I‚Äôm going to try to keep this as brief as possible
---
1. New Killers and Survivors: Pig (Amanda Young), Clown, Spirit, Legion, Plague joining the game as Killers; Detective Tapp, Kate Denson, Adam Francis, Jeff Johansen, Jane Romero, and Ash Williams joining the game as Survivors.
---
2. New mechanics: Endgame Collapse, probably the biggest new feature in terms of brand new mechanics, when one of the gates are opened or when the hatch is closed (yes killers can close hatch now), a two minute countdown starts, when the countdown ends, any survivor who is still in the game will be instantly killed and sacrificed.
---
3. Bunch of pallets and vaults changes, and you can no longer recover from the exhausted state while running, so no mid-chase sprint burst or a second dead hard during a chase. Killers and survivors are constantly debating over changes like these as to whether they‚Äôre good for the game or not.
---
4. Cosmetics store, there are some pretty good skins in it imo.
---
And I think that‚Äôs probably it? In terms of kind of major ones at least
---
But what devs dont? Game developers have a saying "fix one thing break 15 others" meaning everytime they fix code somewhere it screws it up in another. Now im not saying DBD devs havent made mistakes. they do alot but at least they haven't given up on us or the game and listen to our feedback
---
Just dont cleanse.
---
Activi$ion and Bluehole are the last companies I want BHVR to emulate. If they emulate BO4 especially I'll be outta here with my cash just as quick as I was with BO4 when Activi$ion started getting stupid greedy.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to validate myself, but when someone says ‚Äútheir perfectly fine wtf‚Äù then maybe you should say something
---
This meme is amazing, score: 4 survivors sacrificed with 5 gens left
---
This coulden't have had a better time for me! But I'm spooked I won't get in Ox
---
I mean, I've played this game enough at red ranks to know what a good survivor looks like. People who know tiles, know juke and know how to use flashlights are not bad survivors and they do fine at red ranks. 
---
I know everyone here hates Ochido, but you're very wrong if you think he can't run a good killer the same or better than your average red rank.
---
The teabag during the Mori xD
---
Was kind of expecting you to get entity-killed during the running away animation.
---
I thought your idea was ok at first, but now that I think about it, hell no. SB would be especially disgusting. You'd start the chase with them getting the ground ahead from SB and you are on a 30 second countdown already until they do it again. The SB would let them make a clean break from an area they've used their last pallet in to way across the map to a new safe area. For any non movement based killer you'll be burning close to 10 seconds just trying to catch up to the first SB. The other exhaustion perks would be totally pointless compared to how good SB would be. Also one of the drawbacks of SB is you can't use sprint until you want to use SB. With this you could have a SB in your back pocket and already be sprinting, knowing a SB is coming. 
---
NM definitely needs a buff to be actually useful. Simply reducing the time it takes for exhaustion to recover normally would be fine and even then I'd say it could use more benefits.
---
Because he can't. He's used to playing against killers that can't counter 360's and don't know how to mind game/hide their stain.
---
"THE NUMBERS MASON"
---
Your title is literally tagged as a discussion and you‚Äôre just replying to everyone, ‚Äúdo you know what an opinion is‚Äù.
---
Tru3's really down-to-earth and his gameplay is quite entertaining, but him calling every missed M1 a "bloodeh ded 'ard" and doing awful "mindgames" makes me think even a trash survivor like me could loop him for 5 gens :&lt;
---
Thanks for reply
---
I dont really watch ohm that often but he's pretty good. Need more improvement but pretty entertaining and i like him.
---
I also like h20 and vanoss, so...
---
We need a killer to go with him, who would he run away from?
---
Haha that's actually true. I always feel bad when I get teabagged as Freddy, they're literally picking on the handicapable.
---
Ah, yes. Impaled through the stomach fetish.
---
&gt;you'll get cosmetics you dont want
---
&gt;you need to focus on specific thing s to level up battle pass ruining your expriencing 
---
&gt;the game is fine without a battle pass
---
The last thing you remember is the Wraith rework, right?
---
Decisive Strike has been changed. You can only ise it after you've been hooked once and downed again within the first 40/50/60 seconds. After that, you'll be the obsession and all obsession perks apply to you. Once someone else uses DS they'll become the obsession. The skillcheck is slightly bigger and will be triggered while the killer  picks you up so they can't cancel it.
---
you are absolutely right wise man! Thank you for correcting me and showing the right way !
---
"dam dedhard" love that quote from him
---
how?
---
yeah ik,i watch Monto as well,hes damn entertaining(+boob3)
---
Doctor is gonna love this
---
We embody the condiment
---
Hasnt the stats shown Hag consistently gets the most kills of any killer at all ranks?
---
I get a little scared the first time, but then I just know I have to pay a tiny bit of attention to my surroundings.  
---
And then I just do nothing the whole game but holding M1.
---
Do you think if the plague looked down and puked she could fly?
---
I had a game with a Leatherface yesterday in which he killed all but one person - the whole team said gg despite losing - his response? ‚ÄúFuck off‚Äù ...
---
I wish we had more tools to use against killers. Like setting trip wires or some shit but it cost a long time to set up.
---
I started playing this game around 1 year ago. I didn't really have a main back then. I went on and off with every killer (if I had to pick one to be my "main" it was myers). However now i main legion
---
I would be much more happier with that than being completely blinded.
---
i mean after his apology  video, he's finally decided to part from the dbd community by drastically reducing his uploads of the game; even with how unhappy most of his braindead community is with it. i think that he's making the right choice by parting the community and am glad to see he's taking some responsibility now.
---
As I said before, fuck that.
---
If there would be no way to buy it witg money or auric cells (which is the same) then it'll be okay.
---
Otherwise Fuck this shit I'm out. Devs already got a plenty from in-game shop and DLCs
---
I mostly encounter the flashlights when I‚Äôm carrying a survivor or breaking pallets.
---
Why are we still taking about ochido, I want my regular dbd shit posts back , delete this trash.
---
well thats sorta true
---
fuck me
---
Lightweight and bond are some of my most used. Gotta love stunning a killer, turning a corner, and watching them look around for 10 seconds just to fuck off cus they lost you
---
If I have to deal with being Dying Light &amp; getting facecamped when found, or Rancor &amp; being a gimme kill at endgame, I'd prefer having options that allowed me to still play the game to a degree.
---
That said, they're obliterating MoM anyway, so you won't have to deal much longer.
---
Sorry fam
---
or... you play something else. that's also an option
---
It‚Äôs 2019 why the fuck are you still making BOTTOM TEXT memes (nOrmIeS rEEEeEeeeeeeEEeeE)
---
Who is that lol
---
A good Hag is far scarier and miles more threatening than any Billy
---
Moral of the story: Don't struggle? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Good. It will be like he never existed.
---
Anna Ou
---
Started out with hag‚Äî&gt;nurse‚Äî&gt; now I'm maining 
---
Spirit and Myers.
---
I still Cant figure out why people always say dbd community is "toxic" you will find salty asshole everywhere but ever heard of rainbow six seige, smite and left 4 dead?
---
he is def worth a try
---
Yep, I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out like that, also it would be much more funnier.
---
Wouldn't this make adept Myres and Laurie achievements impossible, too?
---
I dunno man, I fuckin' *smoked* him with my low level Spirit when I was borrowing a PC for a while.
---
Use your ears then.
---
There was a livestream a few days ago not_queen talked about the issue
---
Tru3? Down to earth? What are you smoking, mate?
---
He needs to know his fucking place, because he's trash.
---
(Not talking about game skill btw)
---
*Hillbilly comes down the stairs* "REEEEEEE"
---
*Your* most used perks. I almost never see them.
---
Can confirm, I let the last survivor go if they don‚Äôt struggle, so the moral of the story is just give up on life I guess
---
A full hex build with prayer beads is toxic as fuck.
---
There are debuffs to being the obsession, they‚Äôre called rancor/dying light/remember me.
---
Also, the only way for survivors to even get a chance to use their ds is if you won‚Äôt leave them alone after hooking them. 
---
And yes, Mettle is very unfair against m1 killers, which is why it‚Äôs being changed to only give you the extra hit after 3 safe hook rescues or 3 protections. Besides, if you could only bring one obsession perk, then adept Laurie would be impossible and sole survivor would be useless (since it couldn‚Äôt be combo‚Äôd with object of obsession)
---
I'm not saying they're not underrated, just agreeing that they're good
---
Agreed. salty survs are always pissed when Freddy gets at least 2k
---
Did he get unbanned or is he just still playing around his lifetime ban for being a wad of fucks? Last I saw he donated to some Dev who was streaming d the Dev said go away not the place for this.
---
Ive been away from DBD for a few weeks, what happened?
---
fookin ded hard is better.
---
nothing,i didnt have a better idea than ochido
---
Pipe down bottom feeder ; D
---
Personally, I think it's funny when survivors teabag during sleep animation or while asleep because the animation does weird things.
---
It doesn't really bother me in general when I get teabagged though.
---
Yep, as all 3 of both are obsession perks.
---
I've found really old people like in their 30s just frustrated and completing shitting on teens and kids imo
---
God wtf did I write
---
Is it weird that i know some of these players? Have I been playing to much?
---
I know you said it wasn‚Äôt worth a perk slot, but why not bring stridor? It‚Äôs an amazingly underrated survivor finding perk and it counters iron will. If you have stridor you should be able to hear survivors in flashlight distance. Oh but blinding at pallets is kinda bs, especially since you look down at the pallet to kick it
---
OP needs to join the dev team :)
---
at first he was making videos dodging the ban for a few weeks, then he made an apology video about 2-4 weeks ago and since that video came out he has mostly stuck to playing other games and uploading funny moments. i think he only has made one normal dbd video in that period of time after the apology which was directly after the apology so i think it was a scheduled upload.
---
I have 20+ mirrors and only 2 Lery's offerings... Bloodweb is cruel to me.
---
dem roin
---
I love it when I down their whole team with NOED cuz they didn't cleanse then they get shitty at me in chat
---
He has played DBD but he skipped the tutorial. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Very legal.  
---
Saying they're illegal is the same as saying people can't play from the same room in different computers.
---
And who asked for your opinion?
---
serious question: How tf did the meg get up? Or did she have adrenaline also but was stuck in the animation?
---
Besides, if that was illegal, a huge amount of players would just get banned or stop playing.
---
Welcome new member
---
Awesome. Do you have any game play footage of you doing them so we can see how easy it is for you?
---
So I'm not allowed to express my opinion?  
---
They asked for more T1 Myres, I said why I wouldn't like it. I don't see a problem here.
---
You didn't get downvoted because people condier rank 1 to be free, you got downvoted because you're an asshole.
---
Really not needed. All you have to do to loop is run around a pallet. That‚Äôs it?
---
it's simple. money. Especially when you've got a fanbase belonging to a niche game and it's hard to broaden out to other games without losing your audience. Have you seen Hybridpanda's videos views if it's about DBD compared to other games? (same goes for Monto)
---
With each perk I said ‚ÄúOhhhhhh!‚Äù 
---
Good work mate!
---
I try to run Bond, I really do, but in solo queue, I inevitably see Laurie in the corner doing fuck-all for the entire duration of the gen I'm on, and Meg dropping pallets Willy nilly even though David has the killer on the opposite side of the map, and I get depressed.
---
Well I know that but what are the perks
---
no
---
The clown‚Äôs version of this pistol should look like a tiny water gun or something
---
You're a killer main, huh. Like I said, I'd love to see some footage of you "just running around a pallet".
---
I made one with names like Gay Daddy David, Gay Cub David, Gay Bear David, and (me but I didn't have shirtless david) Gay Pimp David had me in tears laughing my ass off.
---
Personally, I've had some instances in late game where all chests have been emptied, my medkit doesn't have enough charges to heal me again, but trying to save my teammate from the hook is definitely going to require taking a hit, and I wish I had Self Care.
---
Mostly what I see on PS4 as far as toxicity is survivors DCing
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be healing more than once or twice
---
Nope survivor main, okay I don‚Äôt see why though? Watch most people‚Äôs gameplay, when they get chased they will run around and pallet until the killer catches up and then drop it or fake and run through? This isn‚Äôt rocket science man so calm down
---
Well, it‚Äôs not like it isn‚Äôt true....
---
Just running Adrenaline is good enough of a Self Care for me, tbh.  
---
Saving teammates from a hook when the killer is camping is a waste of time, I say you punish them and get the gens instead.
---
Noob is nice, yeah, but Ardetha is where it's at for me
---
I think I may get used to it when I play survivor a bit more, get some perks and learn how to evade killers, but one thing I'll never get used to is HAG SCREAMING AND EXPLODING WHEN I STEP ON HER MUD KINDERGARTEN DRAWING, STEPPING ON A LANDMINE MUST BE QUIETER.
---
Okay that I do see a lot on pc too. My comment was more specifically referring to toxic chat.
---
No seriously, who?
---
Pharmacy is a must have in my builds, pharmacy + botany knowledge is far superior. If I‚Äôm gonna waste time to heal myself or teammates it better be &lt;16 seconds
---
It wasnt a rework, they just changed Feral Frenzy values
---
Until you realize you still have no mither.
---
It wasnt a rework, just 115 speed and different Feral Frenzy values
---
In my opinion the best buff would be dying after the fourth hook
---
No mither gives you an extra change and you have an additional hook span before death
---
I unlocked pharmacy, plunderers and ace in the hole months ago and I still can't stop using it. The amount of red items you get with T3 plunderers is wild. To the point where I find and then burn rainbow maps/keys completely during matches and just grab something else from another chest because I can. Or just searching and leaving chests for others to use. Pharmacy meanwhile is like getting WMI and self care together, in which case I always leave a small bit to try and escape. My original plan was to do this, stockpile a bunch of gear and then drop the chest build and just use it all up with 2 more good perks. But I can't stop hoarding now. I feel like I'm wasting the chacne to get a good item when I start a match with a chest build. My favourite is pharmacy/ace/botany/WMI. Unhook heals are absurdly fast and depending on the addons you can get quite a few done too. Best of all there's never any fear going into a match that you'll get scammed with a DC or early tunnel or just fucking up and lose some good gear you bought from the web without properly using it.
---
Honestly, from my experience, you can only try to cooperate with Survivors if they take the initiative. 
---
If they see you coming, you smack them and they start gesturing or some shit, hey, it's farming time, let's go!
---
But everytime I tried inviting survivors to farm, they either ran or started spamming flashlights and other toxic shit.
---
I find killer to be more relaxed mostly because I'm not being chased. Being chased sucks, especially when you know what's chasing you is faster.
---
I used to plunder all the time, too, but I just got bored after 100+ hours of the same shit.
---
This has been 90% of the after chat in my matches. Way better than what the console community has turned into
---
Not to mention that killers can have both obsession perks *and* obsession add-ons simultaneously, which OP isn't suggesting being changed.
---
killers tunnel No Mither and Object of Obsession users, because you're like "I'm the greatest player here"
---
if you're bold enough to play freddy, take all the teabags on your chest and smile and type EZ in chat when you 4k.
---
What does it mean by support gameplay??
---
Obviously not
---
Not necessarily when camping, more like, "Two teammates dead, third teammate is on hook, I don't want to be the asshole who just waits for hatch."
---
What d you say to the lown?
---
Except plague has a lot more tracking thx to vomit
---
Yes, sure that is one counter to it. But killing survivors counters everything. If Adr activates you are guaranteed to use it, unless you're dead. I saw I got a lot of down votes on a comment, when all I said was the truth, NOED sucks to play against, yes, can it be countered, yes. Adr sucks to play against, yes, can it be countered, yes, but not as effective as NOED.

Always upvote this sub.
---
You've pretty much lost at that point, though.
---
It's literally the most balanced item survs have
---
With self care by itself you probably won't get a chance to use it more than a couple of times. If you do, the self heal takes so long that you are wasting a huge amount of time doing so. Forget it totally if they've got sloppy. Green kits heal way faster and let you get down to bizniz again. Plus if you don't get hit you can turbo heal other people. SC has it uses but Id say it's more circumstantial than pharmacy is and has less potential.
---
Just hit them again. After they got a speedburst to the next pallet or window. And the problem ist when 2 or more people have it. I play Rank 1 Spirit and even with her it is really annoying. 
---
Don't get me wrong, i don't want to take away the perk but as my idea showed i think people have to deserve that second chance that possibly can be a gamechanger especially when more survs run it. You can't punish killers for doing their job to hit people, that is an inconsistent design flaw.

Plague: Since you injure survivors with Vile Purge, Exposed perks are pretty much wasted on Plague. Especially now that they do not work with Corrupt Purge anymore. Perks to do with healing (such as Sloppy Butcher and A Nurse's Calling) also do not work well on her, for obvious reasons. Of the general-utility meta-perks, most work just as well on her as they do on most killers: Barbecue &amp; Chili, Whispers, Hex: Ruin (which you can puke on early game to potentially identify that someone is attempting to cleanse it), Bamboozle, Enduring, Spirit Fury - these are all fine choices on Plague. Flavor choices that I particularly like on her are Brutal Strength and Play With Your Food. Brutal Strength can reasonably be used over Enduring on Plague in general, since you can respect pallets and puke on survivors instead. In Corrupt Purge you also want to respect pallets. And if you are using PWYF, you don't want to be swinging through pallets to begin with. PWYF is pretty great on Plague since Vile Purge does not consume tokens, and half of your chase is spent using Vile Purge. Plus, given that survivors will be injured for the second part of the chase, you only need 1 hit to down them, consuming only 1 token. Corrupt Purge does consume PWYF tokens, (un)fortunately. BBQ pairs fairly well with PWYF, enabling you to potentially identify and locate your Obsession for more consistent PWYF use. My go-to Plague build is either BBQ (or Whispers), Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, or BBQ, Ruin, Brutal Strength, PWYF.

I do watch other people's gameplay, and most people have no idea how to route, or run junglegyms or even do basic loops. I'm impressed you find it so easy. Love to see some footage, man. You got any way to record?
---
Its niche tbh, but i actually like to buy it sometimes when im playing toplane
---
jUSt pLaY nURsE
---
Absolutely, I love this.
---
Why would you drop 100 dollars on skins if you uu
---
I guess it's the same with some people liking rollercoasters and some not. For me chases are exhilarating because there is a feeling of danger, but in the back of my mind I know I'm safe and it's only a videogame. Took me a year to get to this point though.
---
I'd like to help make this a thing tbf
---
What if you work around it like the only char that use 2 obsession perks are Laurie, and it's only her own obsession perks that can be used. And make is so you can't use 2 teachable perks if it's not your own teachables, making adept doable on every char, and giving playing Claudette over nea a meaning.
---
I want that every swf game, please.
---
I WANT THAT!
---
Why would you dump 100 dollars on this game if you said the main reason you're coming back is to main Freddy who has no skins.
---
Feels bad man
---
For me, a win is if I've contributed. I'd rather die getting the third teammate the hatch than take it for myself, and it's easier to do that if I'm not wounded. I rarely take Self Care (pretty much only after a rash of houseplants for teammates or if I'm leveling a character &amp; have very limited perk options,) but sometimes it would have come in handy.
---
I‚Äôve no way to record, no
---
Looks good fam
---
A little bit of both? This was actually my friend that I was in a match with. He is trying to get wiggle escapes, so he broke all the hooks in the area and immediately broke any that spawned in. We basically had a good bit of ‚Äúsafe area‚Äù that the killer could absolutely not get us to a hook, so he ended up just leaving us on the ground. It‚Äôs just about the most toxic thing I‚Äôve ever done as survivor, and I was really surprised the wraith stuck out the entire game.
---
Exactly! When I saw that guy doing that movement, I liked it very much, so I made this little clip, although I should do a gif with that only blank stare: it's so nice! XD
---
But it‚Äôs not fun on the receiving end. If it made the survivors invisible for the blind duration, I‚Äôd be ok with that. I just hate the complete blinding part of it.
---
Jack has a cool mask
---
I didn‚Äôt consider stridor! I was mainly talking about the one perk that reduces your blinding rate. I‚Äôll try that my next game.
---
Imagine if people didn't post about Slenderman being added every day.
---
So you‚Äôre saying that tru3 is as good as Scott or Zubat?
---
Just because you‚Äôre getting upvotes doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre right.
---
But yes, Zubat doesn‚Äôt play nice my bad, Scott however definitely definitely does.
---
Part deaf, sadly. Have to rely on sight more than anything.
---
No they don‚Äôt
---
That still doesn't impact that killers can use multiple obsession perks, as well as add-ons that create an obsession (Black Box for Freddy, which is near-useless without an obsession perk to support it, or Judith's Journal for Myers.)
---
What if survivors said, okay killers, you can only have one insta-down: pick between NOED, Make Your Choice, Devour Hope, playing Myers/Billy/Leatherface, or using Iri Head Huntress. It's still ridiculous.
---
If a killer wants to make an entire build based on insta-downs, feel free. If a survivor wants to make an entire second-chance build, feel free. It's in the game for a reason.
---
The addons wouldn't change effect? That's not what I am trying to say. The addons I can remember are for Myers which makes his Evil go faster? Correct me please (or comment the addon you're thinking about) but that wouldn't have any effect on my idea, it will still be the same, and makes it easier for Myers because the obsession doesn't change.
---
Wow... That is such an amazing idea.... üòÇ
---
The only statement I made was that Zubat slugs and plays effectively. And effective killers will always do better than killers who play nice. As unfun as that is for survivors, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. 
---
I have yet to see how tru3 plays when he‚Äôs playing effectively, but I doubt it because he tries to mindgame certain things too much. 
---
This isn‚Äôt an argument between you and I, and I don‚Äôt care how many upvotes I got. Even though, in this scenario, my claim is 100% right ‚Äî effective killers &gt; killers who play nice. Relax. Karma isn‚Äôt that serious.
---
Ash fucking Williams
---
Wait.... thats common?..... aw shit heres me thinking it was an unique idea. Never mind. It never happened. I never posted this
---
Black Box for Freddy starts the obsession in the dream world. Without an obsession perk to back this up, all it does is let you know where the survivor is for however many seconds until someone wakes them up. I've been Black Box before, I've woken up inside ten seconds, then we both booked it to the opposite side of the map before Freddy could get to us, and he had no other obsession perks so he used a pink add-on for less than ten seconds of knowing where I was.
---
If there's no perk backing that up, it's useless.
---
He gets salty at times, but cool guy overall
---
Agreed, everything killers have for survivors is fun to be on the receiving end of. Already removed insta blinds, now let‚Äôs just completely remove flashlights.
---
Seeing as a good amount of players and streamers use discord or whatever voice chat to communicate with their swf in game and haven't gotten banned for it - no.
---
Yeah that's the kinda thing I don't understand. In all honesty, people who say shit about killer tier lists and why the lower tiers (aside from Freddy which I understand) need buffs often seem to refuse the fact that their own skill level is often one of the biggest impacts on a game.
---
Sure, having a stronger killer makes it easier to 4k, but with good play on most killers you can 4k very consistently and yet the average should be 2k as far as I'm aware.
---
I'm running BBQ, Thanatophobia, Overcharge and Pop goes the weasel

Hmmm....

I dunno about Monto, he is so good at games he seems to get an audience for most of his videos regardless

Pretty sure this is literally in the top posts here. Downvote and move on I guess.

What a ~~surprise~~ shame.

why gabriel got that cakeüç∞
---
Of course it does. 50% of the subreddit is people with victim complexes screeching at each other.
---
I don't see why they can't at least give us old man Myers
---
Sometimes when you‚Äôve just been hit you get stuck in the downed animation and you get a delayed adrenaline.
---
SWF must be fun
---
MoM is a new perk that is well. Its really good. After getting hit three times, you will ignore the next hit from injured to dying state.
---
Okay. Show me your proof,that they don't ban for it ?
---
Probably the most underrated comment.
---
I‚Äôd rather No Mither just be reworked. Start the game off healed, but the next time you get hit you can‚Äôt reheal, but the killer doesn‚Äôt get the broken notification. That way if they haven‚Äôt connected the dots, you can take advantage of all the buffs No Mither gives you.
---
Dude literally only content I ever watched was a few funny moment videos of his that got recommended to me and the man was TOXICCCCCC
---
I feel the sarcasm, but I‚Äôm not a hypocrite. For the killer, I feel the ebony mori shouldn‚Äôt exist. Killer someone instantly after one hook is ridiculous in itself.
---
When people mid match dont struggle I bring them to the basement as a statement.
---
stake out (make those good into greats)
---
prove thyself (for other people to help you)

streetwise(make those toolboxes last longer)

and idk what else

You'll do better next time :)

No Mither
---
Resiliance
---
Prove Thyself (I'd rather use Adrenaline here, but if you want speed, this is speed)
---
Sprint Burst (out of all Exhaustion perks this is the safest one to use when you run No Mither. You can be caught in a bad place \[like next to a generator\] and easily use it to make some distance. Can also be used to get from one gen to another quickly)
---
I think OP is implying that the rework will give Freddy new skins. This hasn't been confirmed or denied by the devs tho.

Yikes

Survivor is leaps and bounds more fun than killer. Killer is easy mode, and it gets boring fast (though, as a massive Scream fan, I'll be a kilelr mian for at least six months soon, lol.)
---
&amp; additionally, the obsession changing makes it EASIER for Myers, because each survivor only has a certain amount they can be stalked before he doesn't get stalk from them anymore. If you drain the obsession, then someone else uses DS &amp; becomes the obsession, you can use it again.
---
What really did it in for me with BhVR Interactive was when they dropped the Legion DLC right before Christmas and decided to take off for the next two weeks. When that dropped we all had massive issues and BhVR was like well we are gone for the holidays fuck you all and we will fix it after we get back. It left a bad taste in my mouth as a company that doesn‚Äôt care about its players or customers. The only thing they did do was come back in and finally take down the mount ormond map that was fucking everyone‚Äôs shit up! It kept freezing my PS4 where I would have to hold the power button and do a hard reboot just to get it working again. Then the asshole devs do a stream just after getting back saying how much fun it‚Äôs been over the Xmas break, when in reality everyone was miserable and proof in the subreddit about everything going on. They made there money and said fuck you to the customers. I run my own company and you don‚Äôt do that, and if it wasn‚Äôt a video game company or a popular video game that they have, they probably would be out of business. Then the problems continue
---
It's a perk I used a lot when I started out. I played only Dwight at first, so using Bond and Spine Chill gave me a lot of information on my team mates and the killer. Once I got the hang of everything, I finally decided to play other characters and now I don't really need it anymore. It's a great perk for new players in my opinion.
---
Why would a salty survivor message about their vagina
---
A pedophile that plays dbd
---
Aren't Dweard and the Donkey jacket on console as well? I'm pretty sure I have the Dweard on my Dwight and the Donkey Jacket was a survivor award from last year's Lunar event. I don't have it myself, though, since that was around the time that I started playing.
---
No Mither, Resilience, Prove Thyself, Commodious Toolbox with Socket Swivels and Clean Rag. That's all you can really do to speed up generators. Streetwise, Wire Spool and Instructions can be used, too, then potentially with an Engineer's Toolbox. Maybe Brand New Part, but it's underwhelming. Grip Wrench and This Is Not Happening if you have trouble hitting Ruin (or BNP) skill checks.
---
Feels good seeing a comment like yours, gives me hope
---
Nea
---
Console is worse as there‚Äôs an intense Frame rate difference between the two and 360s are WAAAAY easier.
---
Honestly, no. All the other games Monto play get like 9000+ times less views than his DbD videos. And it's understandable, but I feel sad for those dudes. The only guy who seems to be fine doing videos of other games is Tru3, I dunno how he does it but it works on him
---
Bro i only got 1 commodious toolbox soo...
---
I believe they have talked about it in the last dev stream.  
---
So maybe?
---
Yessss!
---
Yeah look, I felt the same way when it first happened to me. I was in control, but the survivors used a key to escape and took that control away from me. The feeling sucks. I get it. But it really doesn‚Äôt happen very often. If you see someone bringing a key, you can always use franklins demise as others have said. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to be that guy either, but you could always just kill them before they get a chance for the hatch. Working on becoming a better killer will help greatly in this respect. I‚Äôll admit that things that really annoy me now as killer can be solved by ‚Äúgetting good‚Äù. 
---
Keep in mind its a game and the next one can always be different
---
I've been going back and watching some of his videos of Last Year: The Nightmare and it's still great to me. Honestly, I kind of even prefer those over his DbD right now, since I'm kind of burnt out on it.
---
Where is his apology video?
---
Ok...why do you have an add on that turns your terror radius to 0 when the fake hag spawns and a add on that doesnt spawn a fake hag at all when a trap is tripped on the same build.

Well, it's not like the devs can't take a break for Christmas. Besides, the had to drop the DLC and then leave, cuz they wouldn't delay it for two whole weeks. And besides, bHVR are of the very few dev teams that actually care about their game and playerbase. But they're humans and make mistakes too. They couldn't forsee that 1 free hit and 110 ms would've made it frustrating for both sides. They only had 3 months to make the DLC, and they couldn't spend 2 of those months just testing legion to see if he gets frustrating and stale. Besides, they're fixed now, so that's good.
---
They have! Hopefully they can balance it out nicely.
---
Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve watched him much at all then. 
---
Can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw tru3 slug someone. He‚Äôs been in situations to end the game and he‚Äôs literally said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll play nice‚Äù, and let the guy he‚Äôs chasing escape or go for the unhook while he runs for a downed survivor. 
---
I encourage you to try and watch a few streams of his next time you try to bash him on the sub for being trash. He doesn‚Äôt always make the right play but to say that he doesn‚Äôt play nice is just plain stupid. 
---
Have a good day, boss.
---
You've gotta hit *skill checks* after all.
---
i think he might have made it private or something, i just checked too and was surprised to see it gone.
---
Lol you‚Äôre really going to deprive yourself of ALL the other content just because Freddy is bad? That‚Äôs your own problem.
---
steam is illegal
---
The skillcheck appear as you are being picked up. The perk lasts 40/50/60 seconds after being unhooked.
---
Well this is a shitpost, and also did I say that this is anybody else‚Äôs problem?
---
4 pizza Dwights are better. Change my mind
---
Ochido is just a cunt, No0b3 at least is alright. He is a twat but he‚Äôs no Ochido
---
They did talk about the problem on the live-stream, stop spewing shit before you actually research. Fixing it will require a complete update so at the moment just 99%, it‚Äôs not hard letting go of the button for half a second.
---
Because my boi Freddy means so much to me that if he gets treated well this time, I wouldn‚Äôt mind giving other characters some sweet new cosmetics :3

They are wearing shirts tho...

Ever heard Feng? fucking hate her voice with a passion, I am thankfull my keyboard has this mute button I can press whenever I hook her to protect my ears from that monkey scream.

&lt;--- twitch :D I'll answer all your questions
---
Without toolboxes, there's really nothing worth bringing to speed up generators with. Resilience is 6.6 seconds on a whole gen, and Prove Thyself 8.8s (if duoing - which, soloing gens is more time-efficient anyway, most of the time). Those two are the only perks that affect generator repairing speed, apart from Spine Chill, which is negligibly negligible.
---
Bring non-Commodious toolboxes, or Plunderer's Instinct, I guess.
---
Tbh the "yaAHHG" of Laurie is my personal favorite, but I love Claudette too
---
Find it funny you're being downvoted for actually looking at the whole data.
---
It hasn't ticked down in a chase since before 2.4 and the most recent update made it not tick down at all while in terror radius.
---
I jump every time the trap snaps, even when I‚Äôm playing trapper myself pmsl :‚Äô)

---
I was a subscriber of his for 4 months when I was still new, wtf are you talking about? Just because a guy is/isn‚Äôt slugging doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs playing nice or not
---
I disagree. If you blindly chase a good survivor then sure, you‚Äôll have a bad time. 
---
Use mindgames or a high mobility killer or a ranged killer or killers that are good at getting a first hit. You‚Äôre trying to hit someone that is 1 hit. Its 1 hit. Also if they‚Äôre using SB, doubt they‚Äôre using Dead Hard as well
---
Fuck, I think they should ass skill checks before dropping pallets to make it more fair
---
What‚Äôd they say about it??
---
I don't get it. Can you please explain?
---
it still does the terror radius fuckery without them seeing the fake hag

Leatherface. He is literally a 115% M1 Killer with no power unless he‚Äôs right on top of you. Freddy has a build that can make him good.
---
Wtf
---
Why this happens is because not much people know what DBD is,and the subs these people get are the people who play DBD mostly.And seeing the playerbase usually stick to few games,it's expected that not many people will watch other games.Tru3 only plays MK11 these days in addition to DBD and he has a kinda seperate fanbase for that game.

But wait, you can de pip and do it with an even more inexperienced killer! Quite the cycle.

No this gets downvoted because first:

1. You are a dick
---
2. Killer dont pip for there purpose, that is to kill suvivors, they get pips because they were the "Toy" of the suvivors long enough. You need to extand the game longer than it needs to be
---
3.  Ranking up as suvivor is brainded stupid yes, but you only can judge it from the other site if you know it, but all i need to check your history and boom, classic toxic suvivor only player.... so yeah...
---
Dont be a dick !
---
Yup, what you said. I felt real pain for No0b3 who tried to play Fortnite or some other shit and had hurt his feelings as a result. It's much easier when you're like Scott Jund from Lordran or other guys who were known way before DbD so their audience doesn't really care what they are playing. Those people usually has way less subs tho.

I really hope this is a joke

Yes

The one on console is Dweader which has red glasses and has a buzzcut while the Dweard is fully bald and has black glasses and the David Donkey Jacket is a gray variant of the untamed donkey jacket from the lunar event

Maybe you remember his steam name so i would know when i verse him so that i can mori the shit out of him?
---
But srsly, who‚Äôs Ohchetto?
---
For me, the audio is fine.
---
Maybe a small exhaust bonus, but honestly as long as the game doesn‚Äôt hand over the information to the killer than I have less grunts, bleed less, and can recover, I‚Äôll be able to use the perk and benefits. Right now it gives the killer too much info. They know not to slug anyone running it, making it already useless. High rank survivors already don‚Äôt heal if they don‚Äôt have to so I could see it being really good with even some small changes.
---
The community you see now wasn‚Äôt even around in 2016, that‚Äôs why there are loads of crybabies who think they know balance.
---
Prestiged the blood web, I say rerolled because you lose all the random perks you have picked up, I did my first match with distressing as my only perk at 12 on the ladder, made for an intense game and without common perks like bbq and nurses calling it look a lot of work and chases to hold my pips
---
I'm not a killer only type of player either, but I only asked for killers cuz survivors are just re skins of each other.
---

I always make it a point to get the unhooker in that situation. Fucking hate hags who use traps to tunnel.
---
Telling the truth makes you a dick now? 
---
Toxic survivor only player? 95% of my playtime is killer. 8 of them are p3-50. I know both sites well because I‚Äòm playing this game since 2016 and especially killer is so piss easy and boring at the moment that it makes posts like these ridiculous to read. It used to be a lot harder but was never impossible. People are just too lazy to put in the effort to learn the game these days (like the Sekiro thing where ppl demanded an easy mode so they can finish the game). 
---
A ranking system is there to assign a number to your skill level - you can‚Äòt reach a certain level, maybe you aren‚Äòt as good as you thought. Hurts the ego but having the insight can help you get better.
---
Wow The Spirit Looks Different.
---
Eh, these changes are so slight, PC can have 'em
---
An asshole, one of the biggest assholes in the community, and I'm pretty sure he also has the most subs out of everyone on YouTube. He had a lot of influence and got banned around 7 times and kept ban evading. He's the one people blame on why this community is so toxic and divided
---
That's pretty good! I hope you get better at the game, and just play the killer you're comfortable with! Good luck in the fog, newbie. Someday, you shall turn into a veteran killer. :)
---
Instablinds aren‚Äôt in the game anymore and the new animation isn‚Äôt nearly as hard on the eyes as the old one was, so flashlights are pretty balanced right now. If they‚Äôre giving you that much trouble, take Lightborn or Franklin‚Äôs Demise.
---
Legion is better right now, but he was never reworked, he was given a 115 speed (110 before) and his powers values were changed.
---
You can actually down and sacrifice people with him without turning the survivors into living generators making the game extremely boring without counterplay. Those who loved to exploit that are the ones pissed off of the change,there are a lot of killers using Legion for the first time because you can actually use him without being braindead.
---
Most who complain are the same that spread the lie that Legion was gonna be/got a rework (Freddy rework, Legion update) or just jumping in the cry nerf bandwagon.
---
He was low tier, he is still low tier, but he has a counter and can down survivors now.
---
The add-ons you have ... don't work together. Even on Wiki says so. Granma's Heart can't work without a Phantasm and Rusty Shackles removes that Phantasm.

Frowned upon generally but not illegal
---
I just wish there was more stuff to interrupt killers other than crippling blinds
---
this gets my upvote
---
lol amazing.
---
It is the thing that has the timer at the top of the screen and if it doesn't finish and if you try to escape you die
---
Well the game is pretty great but the toxicity against new players and the lack of publicization of the game is severely hurting this game.I didn't even know what DBD was until my GF told me about it.And the hatemail I got when I first started was just unbelieveable,like holy shit will you calm your tits I'm still learning
---
That doesn't explain why Herman would hide his big beautiful smile.
---
And I'm not talking about the pig's traps
---
i only have like 150h in the game; but i mostly play legion, huntress and nurse.  
---
you can really outplay survivers with nurse and hunterss, without takeing survivor skill into account; but you also can do some goofy stuff with legion wich i really enjoy (although i feel kinda weird playing him, as i think its really tiring to play against him as survivor)
---
Legion never got a rework, Freddy is getting a rework. No one said, aside from not very smart redditors, that Legion was going to get a rework.
---
McLean said they were going to do changes to Legion's Feral Frenzy and thats what they did. A rework is a full overhaul that completely changes the killers power and stats, thats what Freddy is getting
---
Can we slow ass motherfuckin Jeff as the killer?
---
Basically its bc true's watchers want to watch true, while the others viewers base wants to see dbd, not the streamer. it's a personality thing.. I cant really click with true's personality either, but I do respect the way he streams and how he handles those streams..
---
How do I get that I want to have that power up
---
Oh wow yeah that‚Äôs a great idea! He really suffers during collapse!
---
yep!
---
First time? lol
---
yes
---
i can agree with that, they're very obnoxiously neon which is kinda what i wanted but they stand out very much
---
And then a killer perk to make them harder.
---
Much appreciated
---
tbh, this build is really fun to go against, don't @ me
---
Show me proof they do?
---
The Myers I was facing was angry at being looped so he tested my loop skills irl
---
I like to start my gaming spree each night as either killer or survivor depending how I'm feeling. Then I switch at some point. 
---
After playing killer over and over, it's nice to go to survivor and not bounce between gens and chasing, and instead only keep tabs on myself and killer. 
---
 After surviving so long, switching to killer is nice because I don't have to worry about being seen and I can roam around the map willy nilly.
---
I'm sure it worked when I tested it in KYF, but if it doesn't, well, fuck. I played a couple games with the ear instead of shackles. I ran out of ears and that's why I put that there for the screenshot
---
This is just great. I love it, thank you!
---
If you're going to play the worst killer on purpose, suck it up and swallow down those sweet sweet BMs. If you're bad, you ultra deserve it. If you're better than them, they'll feel the ultimate shame.
---
Here comes the crapper
---
Actually I made it myself thank you.
---
Any smart survivor would DC the second the last wooden coin doesn't flip over in the pre-load screen... so yeah they deserve it.
---
Rerolling DBD would mean deleting your account and reinstalling the game
---
To me he seems full of himself, egotistical even. He seems to have this idea in his head that he's very smart or very good at every game he plays. It's kind of irritating, he's not very self aware or humble at all. Maybe that's just what I look for in people, I don't know.
---
Don't need an apostrophe on a plural, bud
---
Hey man, don‚Äôt let the survivors bring you down you helluva guy.
---
I don't play very often, maybe 10-15 games a week on PC. Not once have I ever encountered this "toxic" culture people are always complaining about. 
---
Only on PS4.
---
OP, in my opinion this tier list is 100% accurate
---
I've never heard of Ochido, can someone fill me in?
---
Glowy bottles are definitely very useful. This I know.
---
I USE small game. I, however, play solo, sooo you know.
---
Majority of people say gg or congratulate each other but there is the 2/5 people who will argue for 5 minutes in post game chat, it also brings out a lot of wholesome people. I‚Äôve met friends in post game chat twice in only a few days.
---
Wasn't even thinking.
---
I like to end games with ‚Äúgg everyone‚Äù no matter how mad I actually am, and it tends to go well
---
Very few people even know there is a difference tbh.
---
Rank 1 hags arent hard though
---
I'm not a got survivor but I've got plenty of gameplay posted of me looping and 360ing killers go ahead and check lul.
---
That does not explain ***how*** a ***game mechanic*** can be ***toxic***. Player behavior can be toxic, but the game itself? What does the word toxic mean to you? *Bad*? *Unbalanced*? You're literally just **saying** the word *toxic*. Something that's *toxic* is something that is trying to deliberately ruin the game for others and driving them away from the game. A *game mechanic* in an **intrinsic part** of said game. You can say a game mechanic is bad, but I don't even know what you're trying to say when you call one toxic. If you're trolling, literally 10/10 flew right under my radar.
---
Angry. 
---
Bubba is not better than oink imo. Otherwise tier list okay.
---
The more popular something is the more ways people find to complain louder, it's actually in a great state, as a killer main, I prefer MoM bullshit over having sprint burst that FOREVER KEPT CHARGING, LEADING TO UP TO 3 USES IN A CHASE, OH THE EXIT GATES ARE OPEN, HAVE FUN THEY ARE ALL HIDING SO YOU DC, ENJOY THE NEXT 45 MINUTES.
---
Been playing since launch on PC and believe me when I tell you I've encountered it maybe twice. That's it.
---
You‚Äôre a survivor main aren‚Äôt you?
---
Even then, Nurse is still miles above every other killer. Harder controls and lower FPS don‚Äôt negate the strength of Nurse‚Äôs ability to literally ignore walls.
---
I personally don't care about Panda's RE2 videos tbh
---
Your argument being on the receiving end of a play that you didn't counter isn't fun? Are you serious? You actually cannot be serious. Bravo sir, you've gotten me good on this one.
---
People cry about everything man, just shrug it off. People heavily underestimate nurses on console so you sure taught them a lesson :)
---
im sure monto and true have more subs,but gotta check
---
Hahaha it was more funny to me than anything.
---
Him: you play like trash. need to get better dude instead of being garbage.
---
Me: I got all of you guys fairly except for the last guy didnt need noed for that sorry I out played all 4 of you hope you have better luck next time.
---
I enjoy being passive aggressive to the salty I've never gotten so much hate mail since playing nurse but thanks man :)
---
Well a bit of a narcissistic pig are you hmmmmm... ? 
---
"Telling the truth makes you a dick now?"
---
No being a demanding that your Oppinion is truths makes you more than that ! 
---
ITs so cringey the assamptions you getting to, jumping from one point that triggers you to another....lol ! But yeah WE ALL MUST BE STUPID ! Its impossible, no way, that you are the one that is infact just not right !
---
It was more funny than anything to me Haha but thanks man :)
---
Well link me some, brother. I'm not gonna sift through your reddit history to find something.
---
ask him to fill you in
---
Turn your camera. If there's more than one flashlight then you need to take pre-emptive action before picking someone up. With breaking pallet, either eat the stun (recommended) or chase them away first. You're aware it takes up their item slot, right? Like, of course it's going to inconvenience you. If it didn't it would be worthless.
---
Getting a 4k with any killer proves that you are the exact opposite of garbage. Don‚Äôt let the 1% put you down. ;)
---
What does each flap say?
---
I feel his pain..f
---
I disagree. I think both sides are really fun and balance each other out. Killer is certainly not easy mode, or boring. Sometimes survivor is really easy. Sometimes both sides make you want to claw your own eyes out in murderous fury. I imagine that you probably think killer is easy based on experience, and if that's the truth, I envy you. I've slogged through game after game trying to make myself red ranks as a killer main on Xbox and the only thing I've succeeded in doing is forcing myself to play survivor more often.
---
Jeff Johansen is the least toxic survivor
---
no he cant,he just cant. everyone can blind at pallets,and after some hours,it is easy to time flaslight saves too. and he plays at rank 15,everybody can run killers around in that rank when they are used to it
---
Lol,  hypocrit, again, you are saying disconnect from the match because the map is bad is AGAINST devs rules while at the same time, you do disconnect from Haddonfield.
---
What a fucking moron.
---
...literally what? Next week:
---
&gt;Pallet stuns are ***tOxIc***!!!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; \&gt; don't carry to hooks through pallets  
---
&gt;\&gt;&gt; fUcK tHaT!!!!!111
---
He moved to console last I checked, though he did get banned there so idk if he is back on PC.
---
no thank you, I feel too slow without Shadowborn, I can play without nurses calling, I actually hit almost every hatchet throw so... ;p
---
I play both, as it should be, why you ask?
---
Thank you for bringing this sub to my attention.
---
Genrushing isn't a think. shut the fuck up and stop your fucking crying. for the love of god.
---
next time i dont forget to save my clip I will upload it and post it here,just for you. trust me buddy,its not hard.
---
also,prepare to get downvoted to hell,seemingly this sub doesnt like ochido(thank god)
---
Pardon my ignorance 
---
Trapper and Doctor start tier D despite being put in tier C?
---
It probably would‚Äôve been easier to put those two in D and then stated that every killer afterwards is F.
---
It's stupid to run noed.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You‚Äôre just so friendly and supportive
---
In fact I love when survivors bring Flash lights because most of the time they don't know how to use it wisely and end up giving me a free hit
---
I think I‚Äôm done with this subreddit. Nothing but posts like this and post-game salt.
---
you can tell his game skill to know its place,too.
---
100% incorrect. 
---
Like the name though.
---
Atleast 10 uploads for dbd in the last 2 days, respect ‚ô°
---
What perk icons are these?
---
Looks like the 1% has arrived.
---
I mean a rank 20 killer can get four kills and still be garbage...
---
Use logic.
---
Doctor, Clown, wraith, And Trapper are D tier because I couldn‚Äôt add F tier for some reason and I think doctor is better than clown
---
I'd argue the game was in an even worse state just a little while ago but with the death of &lt;4 man games and a lot of the other fixes / content we've gotten it's MUCH better.  Once they start punishing DC's I'll agree it's the best its ever been.  The DC problem is running at max right now.
---
Looking forward to the clip.
---
And I'm not really fussed about the comment karma. Defending Ochido is not something I thought I'd be doing today but people on this sub are delusional if they think he's trash when you look at 90% of survivor gameplay submissions.
---
Another honorable mention is Overwhelming Presence. At lvl 3 it makes them burn their flashlight 2x as fast (along with any toolboxes or medkits being used in your TR).
---
Pretty fine but Legion should be changed with Trapper imo. May I ask your amount of hours?
---
That's your own fault ! Who chases someone for 4 minutes?  Move on to someone else.. theres always a weaker guy just sitting on a gen.  But if theres infinites.. which maps and where!?
---
At the moment, you are the only one jumping to conclusions and calling out names and insults. The way you type makes me jump to only one conclusion right now, which concerns your age but as it simply doesn‚Äòt matter for the discussion, I don‚Äòt have the need to specify on that. 
---
Take a look at statistics of any given pvp game - the higher ranks are most likely reached by a margin of 5-15% of all players. You can‚Äòt say ‚ÄûThe majority is right‚Äú when talking about a ranking system, it‚Äòs not true - ranking simply isn‚Äòt a democracy. 
---
Also take a look at most of the posts. People run into frustrating moments in the game, what do they do?
---
From posts and upvotes, most are crying, putting it on the game, on mechanics etc. 
---
There‚Äòs only the occasional post actually admitting failure and asking for advice, which most of the time remains unread and won‚Äòt collect as much upvotes. 
---
The point of this: You cannot trust a hivemind such as reddit especially when anger and frustration are involved.
---
Thanks for the sarcasm. I just pointed out something I found weird, didn't meant to be rude.
---
You sir haven't got so many hours in game I bet
---
alright,if i can,i will post it a week,then its your turn.
---
Oink
---
It was like that when I first started seeing them. Now I‚Äôm rank 12 and they all apparently know how to use them or I just suck. Probably the latter.
---
2000 hours I play trapper and legion a little here and there and have had more success with trapper even after the buff I feel if your smart with trapper he can be devastating to go against (Rank 1)
---
Nah, I‚Äôm fine with everything else. Only toxic items to me are flashlights and the ebony mori.
---
The game was a dark place in 2016 and it has only gotten better in terms of balance. A few hiccups here and there, but much better nonetheless. 
---
Now the devs are doing QoL changes which make things much better. 
---
DCs will be easier to deal with once dedicated servers are a thing apparently. So as long as dedicated servers aren‚Äôt shit, things will be fine.
---
Well, no. I don't claim to be a good survivor or say that it's easy, so I have nothing to prove. 
---
Still, I can post some clips if you really want.
---
2000 hours (Rank 1 killer, Rank 3 survivor) and what makes you think I don‚Äôt have a lot of hours exactly?
---
People here having an emotional reaction against the L O G I C and F A C T S that Ochido is a good survivor.
---
When there is a new poll from BHVR arrives, I always mark the probability of me recommending the game to friends to 4/10 and state my reasoning as following:
---
&gt;It's a great game, but has too many things that can screw a new player: steep learning curve, camping/tunneling killers, insane amount of grind at the beginning, rank system that doesn't really work, long matchmaking times, poor optimisation, crashes, bugs, disconnecting people and toxicity of the community
---
It's already a niche game, and all things pointed above surely won't help new people to hook up with the game.
---
DbD is still great tho. But it has high entry threshold and lots of technical issues. And DbD doesn't have a lot of things that are already standard for multiplayer games in 2019
---
Basically. Only use you'll get is if you make it to a pallet where you can force a swing.
---
Anytime! you wanna earn points ? run things like bbq, thrill of the hunt, distressing, all give you more points in different categories. Just you dont run noed on a the spirit.... shes amazing without it.
---
Ain't that the truth. I will say I've been SUPER lucky with the people I play with where I've rarely gotten hate. I'm not good at the game, but I had a lot of games where the survivors and the killer just laugh and had fun. Even if I made a dumb mistake, I've had people laugh and say, "It's okay."

It‚Äôs not necessarily about being afraid to be chased - if I have a gen 85% done, I‚Äôd rather be able to finish it in peace and then go for the save than be interrupted by an angry Billy. A few seconds in a locker is sometimes the more time-efficient choice.
---
well,i didnt calim either,i just said that you dont need 100+ hours to loop like a god at rank 16
---
I prefer the shovel...
---
Did this kid shell out footage yet? I‚Äôd love to see.
---
No doubt balance is better but for a long time there we had broken Legion addons, 1, 2, and 3 survivor games.  A LOT more crashes wasting offerings.  A disgusting amount of DC's (which is ongoing.)  
---
I agree right now it's way better than 2016 but I was more frustrated with the game than I've ever been before most of that was fixed.   The dedicated server / DC fix is an absolute dream I can't wait for.
---
That‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt exist. 
---
Players in this sub apply one bad, ‚Äútoxic‚Äù game to all of their games that have ever happened, sometimes even the community in general. 
---
It‚Äôs the craziest form of recency bias I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs like players only remember the game they just played. 
---
Always remember that nobody comes to this sub to complain about games being toxic until they play one game that they deem toxic. Very few make posts about good games.
---
It's only gay if tips touch
---
He was bareback last night
---
Ah shit. Sorry got them mixed up
---
No, a shitton of the survivor mains i know would rather try to make funny place with headon and other fun stuff but sadly everytime a BT got taken out of a Perk-Build a surivor died of tunneling : )
---
Nah, helps me even against killer with thousands of hours when they get bloodlust mid-loop or I just can't do a full loop and they can do nothing about it. I got 2.1k hours and they get to use it many times against me  when around a pallet/window but ofc, it is useless in the open.
---
I wish I could, but billy ends chases too fast to get chaser
---
Also, while I really do like Monto, why would I watch him playing for example Vampyr, such a spoiler-sensitive and huge game? I wantch him playing DbD to learn from a great master, but some other games I'd rather play on my own. I guess that's a paradigm of earning your money on gaming videos/streams: you have to play what people expect you to play and what you actually want to.
---
Not toxic? what game are you playing, mate
---
Nobody is suggesting otherwise. It would all be cosmetics and bloodpoints/shards. Nobody is obligated to purchase a battlepass if it comes out but it‚Äôs there for those who do. So many people are so terrified of this battlepass ‚Äúboogeyman‚Äù when the vast majority of them are purely cosmetic and grant no changes to gameplay.
---
When I see any killer with noed
---
Define broken add ons. The blades were a legitimate break in the system, but Frank‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt broken. 
---
I had a feeling you‚Äôd bring up legion. Legion was a genuinely terrible killer unless he had frank‚Äôs, he was just unfun to play against. He was a main reason why I put the ‚Äúmajor QoL changes‚Äù in my last post. His rework changed the quality of the game. 
---
The offering loss thing has been in the game since 2016, much like the survivors spawning in down a teammate or two. 
---
Hopefully your dream won‚Äôt be messed with, but dedicated servers are a tricky beast and I hope they can do it.
---
I wish I took a pick of my perks I forget what I was using
---
I agree with this list. I‚Äôd probably put Huntress a tier higher (but then again, I‚Äôm a Huntress main so I‚Äôm biased), but other than that, spot on, I‚Äôd say.
---
The solution is really easy: make your steam look like you're a girl and then nobody will yell at you
---
Sorry if I was using insidious on your post
---
Come on man tell me your opinion instead of downvoting me, prolly only said I have little hours cuz you saw someone else asked me my hours
---
Thank you all for helping
---
For reference, aren't most killers' terror radii 32 meters? That's a large area IMO.

If you think you won‚Äôt play enough to get the rewards you want then don‚Äôt buy the battlepass. Nobody is forcing you to but why does the idea of its existence bother so many people?
---
Name checks out
---
I got around the same amount of hours and I mostly agree with your tierlist but I guess I just don't really play Trapper so I don't know its full potential
---
Clown is definitely at leasr a B tier killer if not even an A tier because of his great ability to seal of one of the looping paths of the survivor. Legion should again be either B or C for his excellent tracking and ability to slow down the game a lot and put a lot of pressure on all the map. The Plague is an excellent area of denial killer and a good counter to looping, especially when she gets her corrupt purge, she should be an A. Myers is an A tier because of his huge map pressure with tier 3 and even with jumpscare Myers.
---
Who
---
Yeah, I'm sure that's how the internet works
---
If we‚Äôre being technical, 
---
All killers can put any survivor in the downed state instantly. The three you named have a more consistent way of doing it.
---
I get that, and I dont mean if a key is used. I mean when theres one person left slugged and everyone else is done. They killer shuts the hatch and the survivor is left to do nothing besides bleed out for the next 2 minutes
---
Couple friends with instaheals and you‚Äôre good :)
---
No problem, just don't be upset if you get corrected, take it and learn, or make your case if you disagree.  It's a very bad habit enhanced by the Internet.
---
It's also a life lesson that I had to learn the hard way.
---
Not really, they're still forced to try and hit you at one point. They'll try to bait it out but if you time it right it still works.
---
I would kill all of you for old man Myers.
---
Even if I counter for it, I can still be BLINDED.
---
Plot twist I'm a girl with a very girly steam
---
I‚Äôm sorry clown is not A or B tier you can‚Äôt seriously think he might be as good as billy and the spirit, can you?
---
And they don‚Äôt take the hit for you
---
I was talking about the blades.  Frank's sucked and was unfun to play against but didn't literally break the game.  
---
Yeah offering loss has been around forever but game crashes got REALLY bad.  So bad that BHVR removed the DC punishment threshold.  Hence the absurd number of less than 4 player games too.  Blegh.
---
I still have the bbq invitation offerings kek
---
Interesting Flex...
---
if you decide to play survivor, get david king first, hes free but you have to download his dlc. He has two amazing perks, wglf and dead hard. If you wanna play killer, spend five more dollars to get the leatherface dlc for bbq and chili
---
Or shirtless Myers
---
This reminds me of Pupper's Cult of Dwights
---
Lol never actually really looked for it. I only notice it if I already decided to let them live or not.
---
(EW3 theme plays)
---
This is heard right before disaster strikes.
---
Everytime I bring spooky myers people rage quit soo :/
---
I get baited into it way too often. I‚Äòm the type who tries to educate people (sometimes way too forcefully). 
---
The game is the best it has ever been, playerbase is looking good (even though it currently is declining, we still have like 3 times the playerbase we had early 2017 for example).
---
Well the blind isn't for you, it's for them. It gives them a better chance of escape by giving them time (hopefully) to break LOS while leaving no/misleading scratch marks.
---
Pretty good tier list. I disagree a bit with a few killers places, but good list overall.
---
also zubatlel is an amazing killer and a pretty good survivor.
---
I think you had a good, well played game
---
Billy X Plague was the pairing I didn't know I needed. Mostly because in my head if they were to talk Plague would be in ancient Babylonian and Billy would be too southern to even make out a word. Perfect.
---
The icons are dope but I really don‚Äòt want to tinker with the files.
---
180 and Dash into them, they never expect it MiNd GaMEs
---
Yep. Borderline. It's even worse when killers actively anticipate it and don't swing until they're right on your ass to see if you have it.
---
Doesn't matter who is stronger than him, is matters who he is stronger than, and he is definitely stronger than Hag and Huntress to some extent, Clown is lacking the range but most of the times his cloud will  guarantee a hit, just like Huntress
---
But my 4 man hatch achievement
---
Yeah, it's dumb.  I'm gonna go after whoever is available to go after.  If the rescuer and the injured survivor split off, I start chasing whoever is closest to me.  If that person happens to be the injured one, they're gonna say I'm tunneling, ignoring the fact that it's just more efficient use of my time.  I'm not going to make the match more difficult for myself because of some muddled sense of etiquette.
---
I‚Äòm playing some rounds here and now but Freddy will be the thing that gets me back for more
---
Doctor is a better version of clown he stops loops quick, he can also find survivors very easily, would you say he‚Äôs S tier?
---
Her vomit instadowns healthy survivors?
---
lmao
---
Sprit has the coolest by far
---
Hey we're in this together!  
---
Got my first 4x Iri after the change to the system as well but as wraith.  
---

---
Feels good when experimenting with diffent perks &amp; addon pays off. :)
---
Actually...touch√©
---
She have to vomit and then M1 (Survivor has to be in injured state). Hillbilly and Leatherface can use chainsaw. Myers can M1 healthy survivor, Plague cant so she cant put them in dying state right away.
---
monkaS
---
Nah, but it leaves you Broken, then you can insta-down
---
NaCl
---
op may i ask your rank and hours?
---
I'm no native English speaker, but technically, since gen is a contraction of generator couldn't you use an apostrophe there to omit the "erator"?
---
I think I learn the most and have the most fun when I prestige and begin climbing again, grats on I4! Stealthies gotta stock together!
---
You can‚Äôt educate new players. They‚Äôll mention their hours like that means they understand the game enough to be the ultimate mind. 
---
Players always decline before DLCs are about to come out. Especially if there are annoying problems. Dedicated servers and new content will bring some back.
---
Teach me your ways
---
probably never, they want you to die.  The game is not rewarding at all for being efficient at all, its very counter intuitive to not only all other games, but most things in life.
---
Scratched mirror is good on the game aswell
---
And even then throwing the pallet down works to the killer's advantage in the long run because then they don't have to worry about it. It uses a little bit of extra time but eventually you're gonna run out of options. 
---
Point of order as well--Killers can very easily anticipate Dead Hard depending on how you move. They won't swing until they're right on your ass to either force you to use it or if you run towards them to use it they'll just wait. One of the worst ideas ever is to use the killershack pallet in conjunction with this. The killer can just stand there and smash the pallet.
---
Myers has to get to tier 3 first, billy has to charge his chainsaw same with bubba, would you consider this right away? I takes longer for a Myers to get his insta-down compared to plague
---
It's actually a decent example of a powerful perk with a fair amount of balance.
---
They're just making sure borrowed time still works
---
@everyone NEW VIDEO!!!
---
We should just throw out some R. Lee Ermey lines from Fullmetal Jacket at them.
---
I guess that what they say is true. The more you try to prove a point, the more you convince the other that he is right. Doc isn't better than Clown, he can't cancel the vault or pallet unless his timing is perfect, also he has far less range. As with Huntress,she is more difficult than Clown.
---
I know, it's little less fun for me, though.
---
...and the fact that I don't have a lot of Game offerings either does not help.
---
I think the reason it seems really toxic is because there‚Äôs way more people playing now, and people tend to voice the things they don‚Äôt like more than what they do like
---
How is it that David's from England but has a great tan?
---
Don‚Äòt burn me at the stake but I think I haven‚Äòt seen that movie for years and can‚Äòt really recall it
---
The game is made for mediocre killers to catch good Survivors.
---
Sodium is so volatile it can react and explode with moisture in the air. True fact!

Oh... well hope luck comes to you

Again I'm not saying I'm a super skilled survivor because I'm not lol but there are a few vids of me running killers and flashlight saves and the like.
---
I have like 15 scratched mirrors and about the same for lerys offerings on my Myers... I kept an eye out for them after I p3'ed him lol
---
pretty sure he just wanted to give u the exit gate... lol u didnt juke nothing.
---
Is this the gmod model?
---
Yeah but michael is like eye height with hooked survivors
---
I think so. Don't know for sure because I got it without DCs. That'd be a good thing to know it advance...
---
On the subject of achievements, there should absolutely be one for getting the 4K as Burger King Myers. The icon could be like a bloody version of the Burger King Mask.
---
Sprintburst every 40secs &gt; two healthstates
---
Thats where ochido is strongest
---
That's how Mors Ambitio works too I think
---
I'd guess the difference for Tru3 is that he started out his streaming career with fighting games (Street Fighter, I think). So while I guess his viewership swelled when he made DBD his "thing", people probably had some idea that he'd be doing other games as well at some point or another.
---
Which one is gonna get your beak first?
---
Look down boi..
---
What do you mean
---
Well, that's the route you have to take if you let shit get to you.  If I'm going into a match on a new killer with one level one perk, I'm not expecting things to go well for me.  So I try not to get too aggravated by it.  
---
It is a bit annoying that the ranking system doesn't account for which character you're using, but I feel like that's rather unnecessary given how many characters exist in the game now.
---
Freddy rework info is coming out in the next two weeks.
---
&gt;community isn't toxic
---
Did we play the same game?
---
look down at those big abs
---
Damn right! :)  
---
Was using this [build](http://www.dbdbuilder.net/index.html?KbCGaIcaDaECX) FYI.  
---
What did you run on pig btw?  
---
I usually run [this](http://www.dbdbuilder.net/index.html?KbaCGfeIbiDbEDX) on her.
---
Oh hahahaha
---
i think its good i mean it is really satisfying when the killer walks past you when your hiding
---
Tfw haunted ground pops
---
More likely all players did a misspell, they all meant GG EZ, lol
---
Thanks, I'm gonna watch the clips in more detail later. 
---
I was generally talking about PC gameplay, though. Console game-play has far too many variables. Most killers playing on vanilla versions of the consoles are literally playing at around 15fps. Even 90 degree turns are a juke. That's why when I was talking about Ochido, I only mentioned his earlier PC content.
---
I only really seem to get toxic players past midnight or so since they tend to play this game a lot later than most of the playerbase.
---
I'm with ya there. Pharmacy isn't necessarily a powerful perk but I think it has Merit. Being guaranteed a health state that doesn't take an astronomical amount of time (and if the killer has perks that slow healing like Sloppy Butcher or Coulrophobia Self-Care becomes completely irrelevant) is to me incredibly useful. Being able to get through chests more quickly is also helpful. 
---
That doesn't change the fact that Nurse's Calling can make healing dangerous. I've actually faced a fair amount of immersed survivors who run Self-Care, and the jig is up the moment they start healing.
---
Are we ignoring the fact the plague can ingest the corruption to damage with her vomit?
---
It might be good, but there‚Äôs better perks to run for sure and I don‚Äôt want to lower my chances of finding a flashlight
---
I wanna be Winston
---
I red the news from a games site , but even if I would link it you wouldnt understand. They do smth against DCs,but not as much as they could.
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
I play on PC and I've had people add me or message me on Steam, but I never check them.  I don't really care if they *think* I'm tunneling or they're pissed because I had NOED and they chose to rush gens and never bother with totems.  
---
I don't play toxic, so their opinion of what they think I'm doing wrong is irrelevant to me.

---
Well yeah, that's why Make Your Choice is an A+ perk on Hag.
---
Doesnt Insta-down though, Dont play Plague but are there addons that make Corruption insta-down?
---
I played with Ochido as survivor on ps4 and he was trash. Did nothing all game and went down 30 seconds in a chase using all pallets on the map.. I doublepipped that game
---
That makes sense, yeah. Btw, does he say "bop, bop" on fataliteh?
---
Meh the clips aren't that good anyways. Console isn't as good as pc but both sides still take some skill to do well. And I would say it's closer to 30 fps haha.
---
Just remember that anyone who does that is likely a pansy incel or a girl with attitude problems and coloured hair. This game attracts a lot of shitty kids with shitty attitudes.

The male killers need Speedos to keep it balanced.
---
One of my favorite channels on YouTube. Would 100% buy this expansion pack.
---
Which sucks so much. You lose half the sprint
---
I didnt mean right away like that. What i mean was that hillbily and leatherface can M2 someone from injured or healthy state to dying state, tier 3 myers can M1 someone from injured or healthy state to dying state. Plague cant put someone from healthy state to dying state RIGHT AWAY.
---
He tried to mindgame you thinking you were going to go all the way through the building, he comes in through a completely different entrance on the opposite side.
---
He probably didn't see your scratch marks at all because he was on a lower level than where you ran.
---
Thats not insta-down.
---
Soon Ghostface will be one of those killers.
---
&gt;ue but are there addons that make Corruption insta-down?
---
No there arent any add-ons like that.
---
community isn't toxic? lmao
---
I think he says lickage or linkage? Something like that
---
I think it's silly that killers have to apologize for using NOED.  It's a perk that can be completely eliminated by the survivors if they choose to take the time to do it.  
---
Totems are a part of the game.  If you make the choice to ignore them, that's not the killer's fault.
---
Nobody cares about celebrity game streamers.
---
And if this guy is so shit why are people keeping his fame alive by continuing to talk about him and denigrate him?
---
I warrant that almost everyone in this thread is &lt;18 years old, because this is so immature.

why do I think thats cute

What addons you used?
---
I LOVE salty messages.  The only thing that tastes better than 4 kills is 4 kills with salt on top
---
You really shouldn't base your opinion on leaked posts, the chances that he will stay the exact same as the leak are minimal.
---
An AR-15 so you can shoot the killer
---
Biiiiitch I just run Bond and Kindred. Solo survivors should really run at least 1 teammates tracking perk.
---
I just can't believe that you would put Clown, Plague and Myers in the same tier as Billy and Spirit..
---
I love Huntress, but I don't think she's better than Spirit. Don't get me wrong, I know she can be better than Spirit in some cases, with long range hatchets she can get hits where even Nurse can't, but her biggest problem are maps. When I see Lery's or Haddonfield or The Game or Coldwind Farm as Huntress I just cringe. I know that every killer has their bad maps, even Spirit has, but playing Spirit on her bad maps isn't as bad as playing Huntress on her bad maps, I mean, even Huntress mains said " don't chase survivors on buildings like the one from Fractured Cowshed, they will loop you forever because hatchets are useless there". I know that Huntress takes a huge skill ceiling, I think that Huntress has the hardest skill ceiling in the game ( I truly believe it's harder to master Huntress than to master Nurse ), but she is just too inconsistent to put her again in top 3. While Spirit, even if she can't snipe   people or snow ball as hard as Huntress, she at least is consistent with her downs and also she is cucked by too many LOS breakers.
---
The chances of him changing drastically are slim. They only have a few weeks before the ptb if he does change they will be small changes
---
Dont worry about it. Do what you need to get the dub.
---
I wouldn't play like that personally because it isnt great fun for the survivors and as I play survivor aswell I know how tough those games can be, but you didn't do anything wrong....
---
... except run NOED üòâ
---
literally the only reason that the hatch close was added is to eliminate 10+ hatch standoffs. Just deal with it and stop wasting  these poor customer service workers time.

---
My freddy was at 39 when they announced, im trying to prestige him right before the rework cuz i kinda want to play the rework from scratch
---
This makes me happy. The fact that they're a brown shirt claudette makes it better.
---
You don't agree with my point so you must no nothing.. what kind of discussion is that, a very close minded one. I was staying that what you wrote is not true to what you preach, you again sais instantly into the dying state, going from broken to dying state is instant....  Also what do you define as an insta down? Just because broken is an effect that doesn't count, what about exposed? I define going down instantly without another hit to be a instant down... You can have exposed and mom trigger yet you don't instantly down.. so is that consider and instant down because regardless of mom in your eyes that an instant down
---
To save someone with a flashlight you must spell saves correctly
---
Sure, I know. But at which point do I have to start flashing?
---
Tough one. Because you dont stay 'in chase' the entire time, the timer stops and starts so will never accurately message to award enough blood points to reward rodeoing a killer for 5 gens
---
The legion activated Za Warudo to jumpscare you.
---
* Screenshot highlighting 4x emblems.
---
Well now i gotta try it
---
And yet many of the veteran survivor mains use it lol.
---
But seriously, if you're optimal in your looping, DH can be very helpful. 
---
They key is knowing how to use it well.
---
My problem with Hag is that she suffers on big maps ( she will waste a lot of time for placing her traps and she probably will even can't teleport at her traps if she doesn't have an add-on for distance, plus good luck with patrolling gens with 110% ). Plus, if you meet a SWF team with an Object of Obsession user, then you might as well just DC. Why do you think that even Hag mains like Croquedead want Object of Obsession to be nerfed ? Because they know that this perk is kryptonite for their poor Lisa.
---
That's not the truth tho
---
Just checking but you are aware that it was changed to only grant tokens on a safe save, right?
---
For freddy's black box addon all people start in the dream world and it reduces chance for skill checks but significantly reduces movement speed.
---
I hate killing all survs w/ a mori because the animation doesn't change
---
And... of course it‚Äôs Russian
---
You can just look slightly upwards (and most likely get a hit in the one trying to blind you).  
---
I think Flashlights are in a good place. They require skill and are a solid punishment when I fuck up as Killer. It used to be much worse when you simply had to click it onces to insta-blind someone.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
That seems really pointless
---
Tbh I have no clue and I found this post to be very helpful for gaining info thank you
---
Yeah, Botany is definitely the better pick, and if I am ever using Self-Care, Botany is a must have for the combination of faster heals, as well as more heals.
---
On pallets - it actually doesn't matter if you are blinded. It gives them like a 1 second lead while you can break the pallet whilst blinded.  
---
For pick-up: That's on you if they get you. If you know there is this one obnoxious flashlight guy in your round, you have a ton of options to get him good. You can fake a pick up, make a quick 180 before a pick up to fuck with their positioning, face a wall etc. There is a lot to it.
---
Ah yes. The best killer perk in the entire game. Bond.
---
I think it's mostly due to the fact that DCing is rampant on both sides, but there is no way to replace a player once they quit. In a edition to this that lost player can actually make the difference between the win and loss quite easily. If it was the killer who DCed then the match is just over. I feel this breeds a lot of hostility, just last night I had I believe 4 or 5 killers DC on my team and it was hard not to get a little pissed because we just wanted to at least play.
---
I want to see one for all killers now.
---
*laughs in 3-gen doctor*
---
No its not bannable. It is bannable if you dont hit them and you just stand there refusing to move. You need to be using it for strategy and preventinf an escape rather than just holding the game hostage. If you blocked the stairs and didnt hit them then yeah thats bannable, if you blocked them for escaping and downed them and then hooked them then your good.
---
a killers perks really have nothing to do with the killer itself. especially when there are teachables.
---
What's the truth then?
---
And don't forget, according to the store, Ruin is tier 2 not 3
---
Yeah and what ? People who play Hag are usually her mains who know how to play her in the most effective way + they meet survivors who still think that Urban Evasion is her best counter ( it's not ) and they get destroyed by experienced Hag mains.
---
Also, Trapper has more kills than Nurse, do you want to talk about that ?
---
WTF?! Wow thats some anger.
---
I've heard he's a real shitheel, but I didn't know he's a pedo, can you elaborate?
---
I mean that's accurate
---
It‚Äôs not pointless if it‚Äôs fun.
---
Welcome to dead by daylight!
---
I agree but the devs said they're doing something shout the DCs, all we can do is wait
---
Well yeah that‚Äôs cuz Panda quite frankly sucks at every game except dbd.
---
Oh hey it's the crapper
---
Good, she can eat mine
---
These people don't understand what you're saying you poor soul. He's 100% not a bad survivor by any means, he's no god either but he's surely on par with the urban evasion megheads I see in red ranks
---
[I'd never run such a bitch perk, but adrenaline is a must and so is mettle of man.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bqppco/looking_for_tips/eo6pi3o/)
---
Because throwing a piece of wood towards the ground is very difficult
---
That wasn't toxic, if I were the nurse I'd be dying of laughter.
---
LOVE IT
---
Good job, except for the part that is Dwight.
---
HAIL SOBEK üêä

He's not a pedophile, just a troller

---
Besides what was mentioned already, you need to also consider that the killer running NOED is using one less perk for most of the game, for a chance at maybe having NOED at the end.
---
While I understand the sentiment that it might feel unfair at the end, it's something one should play with in mind after the last generator is completed.
---
What do you mean Adrenaline is too oppressive? It's clearly balanced. After all NOED exists so it's fine if Adred is exists as well pepega.
---
Being a streamer doesn't seem to be such a dream job anymore to me...
---
Freddy actually has normal killer lunge. I think it's just his height that makes it seem so long.
---
MAN, that timing. A couple more seconds and you would've died.
---
His gas will almost never guarantee a hit and if he does, then you could've get that hit anyway because Clown slows himself down after throwing a bottle, so his slow down effect is useless because of that. Clown is really bad because of that and because of his power being countered by droping pallets earlier.
---
that was Monto :( he teamed up with boob3s twitch chat
---
Remember if he is good devs will nerf him, he can't be good.
---
he prolly does,try DC server too
---
What
---
Agreed. The killer is already playing Freddy, survivors who teabag gotta be an ass about it, too?
---
well that is very sad
---
You have like negative job security.
---
That'd be good! I feel like the aura should be revealed to everyone in a separate color, survivors included, so they'd not waste their time.
---
In fact the part of me that plays survivor would probably give a mild-distortion effect to survivors too close to the disconnected survivor. Nothing sucks more than running for a save or unhook and the survivor disconnecting.
---
Like let's say if you're within (20, 32?) a certain radius of the disconnecting survivor AND within the killer's terror radius at the moment of the disconnect, you get five seconds of being undetected? Silent vaults, no scratch marks, no groans of pain, probably still aura reading, but only because of Nurse's Calling.
---
People shouldn't be caught out because someone else disconnected for reasons other than BBQ&amp;C, basically.
---
just watch an ochido vid
---
Classic example of a perk that's kinda disgusting in the right situation and downright terrible otherwise
---
A small bit after dead center
---
Yeah i saif he has to be doing it to prevent a quick situation. Not just standing there not doing anything then thats wrong. If not its fine.
---
Do you play the interfectorem side or the superstes side more
---
Pretty damn sure, yes.
---
You're just revealing that you're bad at the game pal
---
Killer also head Redheads.
---
I'm so confused
---
What an absolute scumbag
---
No not every killer can do it. Insta-down is when killer take 2 health states with one hit. Legon cant do it because when he hit with feral frenzy survivors they get into injured state so its automatically not insta-down. And time to get tier 3 on myers is irrevelant, it is insta-down.
---
the second and last one seem extrememly situational and 9 times out of ten dont seem worth using
---
It says it's not available.
---
Tried it myself and it says "Dead by Daylight by Behaviour Interactive is not available on Google Play". They've apparently made a golf simulator and a virtual pet game.
---
Clearly you‚Äôve never seen a well built hag three gen build
---
So what you were doing was more in the lane of camping...which also isnt bannable. The only thing i would say is you should hit him when he walked up. But yeah they could have left to do gens they were all around you why would you leave.
---
Yea the maps can be so much worse for Huntress than Spirit, true. 
---
I was thinking more in terms of peak performance, where Huntress actually has a huge peak.
---
No i didnt get hostile.
---
I just want a plague addon that increases the speed of gen degradation while contagious
---
With each generator, a light on it lights up, and they start flashing once NOED and Blood Warden activate.
---
Thanks, man. Good to know not everyone is just as unreasonable as the mob mentality. Just goes to show how many of these guys have actually bothered to get to red ranks. They'd realise a good percentage of them are pallet peggys and, as you said, urban immersion megheads.
---
I really think they should make stuff like this ‚Äûlegal‚Äú via steam workshop. 
---
I‚Äòd get this immediately if I knew it was 100% safe.
---
Can't speak for anybody else, but the amount of toxicity I run into seems to increase with rank. People up there tend to have quite a bit of playtime.
---
This does not mean it's confirmed.
---
Yeah but I wanted to make an end game build with that and wake up and hope and resilience to really try and open that sucker up. I usually end up last alive and want to shed some seconds off the door. Minus a billy or nurse if the gates are far enough from each other I wanna get out cause they never sit by the hatch they are too paranoid and just close it ASAP.
---
Put ur traps in weird uncommon spots, also on random pallets as well thats what i do and typically get 3-4ks
---
Negative experiences is also more likely to stand out than positive experiences.
---
Not really, ‚Äòs is to signify is, so it would be gen is, or couldn‚Äôt is could not, so I it would have more letters after the apostrophe besides plural,
---
He has been caught harassing underage girls for nudes.
---
I got ps plus and I really try to be the least toxic as possible. The most toxic thing I've done is playing legion.
---
well you need it at tier 3 you shouldnt use it at any other tier so its a lot easier to use then
---
Sorry, I didn‚Äôt understand. I do understand the god pallet part though. I meant when I loop I feel guilty and stuff.
---
i want them to [run a train](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=run+a+train&amp;amp=true) on me
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/bplp1v/mobile_dbd_is_coming/?st=jvwjw3hw&amp;sh=29baae84 But there's this found in the dev build?

Correct.

Before BHVR created DBD and other games they made multiple mobile games.

A youtuber who was very toxic at the game. He deranks to face noob killers so that he could juke them, troll them and BM them. He would also abuse exploits to get killers stuck and be forced to DC. He got banned 3 times and one of them was because he hacked the game. He also got allegations of asking underage girls for nudes and treated them like shit if they refused.
---
And if my math is right those three combine should shed 5 seconds off the door right?
---
Good bot.
---
Oh I'm well aware, but it sucks when you're the one being camped. I wouldn't mind if it was a rare occurrence, but camping is a way of life for ps4 killers lol.
---
When you think about it, the more horror games you play, the less scared you'll be. Likewise, if you play the same game over and over again, you're not scared of it anymore. In a multiplayer game like dbd, it makes sense that survivors stop being scared of the killer after playing a bit. So yeah, you can't expect survivors to fear the killer, especially if they're playing like a potato.
---
Anyway, let's agree to disagree, thanks for the civil response !
---
*screams in pain*
---
Even when I run high luck, ace in the hole with plunderers all rank 3, I still get a fucking brown toolbox with spring clamp
---
Did you talk to him?
---
The community is toxic. The hatemail after every single game was so annoying I had to restrict messaging to friends only. More toxic than any game I've played except maybe rainbow.
---
Are you able to choose what perk icons you get? Or are they set?
---
i see Smite I upvote
---
The most toxic people are the ones who only play one side of the game and then proceed to critize why things arw the way they are. Thats probably why enduring got nerfed.
---
You feel guilty for pallet looping? My man, if you just waste every pallet in a chase, 9 times out of ten you won't escape because you will have fucked your team. Killers have no sympathy for you, tunneling, camping using noed etc, don't have any sympathy for them.
---
After 15 minutes waiting for a game and someone DCs before the first gen plus you‚Äôre only on the hook because frame rate froze when hex ruin came up so you couldn‚Äôt hit the skill check.
---
What did he tell you? (if you don't mind me asking)
---
That can be changed.
---
Other toxic behavior aside, how is a survivor bodyblocking and flashlight saving considered toxic? Those are two of the little ways that survivors can save each other without the victim being hooked first. Just hit them and face a wall while picking up other survivors. Alternatively, bring Franklin's or Lightborn if flashlights are really that much of an issue for you.
---
Susie looks great.
---
Without any perks or add ons
---
Wait i love shredded mikey
---
he made a reference to dbd in one of his texas chainsaw massacre kill counts forgot which one
---
My statement is still true.
---
Boosting luck is pointless don't even bother. Maybe it'd do something if the whole squad stacked black salt statues and up the ante idk.
---
This is canon.
---
Lol
---
Grabbing a survivor isn‚Äôt putting them into the dying state, you have to drop them first, so sure half true.
---
Of course? Don't I know something about us, Russians? xd
---
Small tip: in killer shack if you aim your trap at the Ground, and slowly walk backwards into the killer shack, you can slide the trap target under the floorboard in the doorway to the killer shack. When you place it it'll be under the board like your target was, but you can only get it about halfway, so once it's Galway hidden you are good. It works amazing ;)
---
They‚Äôre in the dying state.
---
Doesn‚Äôt show that they are in the dying state in the bottom left but sure
---
this 100%. on paper, a BP sounds like a lot of fun and a good deal. in actuality, they are designed to require an intense grind and require a lot of time to complete. devs won't release a BP that can be completed in a couple weeks since they want to keep the hardcore players engaged for the whole duration of it. this ends up giving the players a feeling like they have to be playing at all times to reap all the rewards or else they're "missing out." it's horrible, and quickly creates animosity and resentment towards the game you previously enjoyed and relaxed with. i liked apex legends a lot until the BP came out, and mid-way through grinding the damn thing i realized how little fun i was having and how much of a chore it was. haven't touched the game since. i'd hate if DBD went the same route.
---
Black Box - Everybody gets put to sleep at the start of the match. At the start of the match, skill check penalties are a little more extreme.      
---
Wraith‚Äôs Silent Bell - his bell is silent and he fits with the terrain better. Still being possible to see but you have to keep a better eye out
---
Lol, not like you're taking a controversial stance at all.  If you lose your karma, it's because you're playing too coy.
---
Sometimes you should put traps on pallets that have already been tossed. Gets people more than you think. You just have to be smart about it.
---
Honestly, fuck you guys. You killed decisive strike, and now you‚Äôre OBLITERATING mettle of man. This is why survivors use the same 4-6 perks. Because all the others ARE TRASH or get nerfed to hell. I‚Äôm getting really annoyed with nothing but catering to killer mains.
---
as a 30 something i find this funny. Kids getting mad at nothing makes life worth living lol
---
The Littlest Penguin.
---
Weird. I didn't know there was crossplay.
---
What's the reason? They didn't think before adding (they are reworking it, they know they fucked up). This is not what I am discussing not if it's in the game or not. NOED is a perk that makes you think about cleansing totems, that is a huge part of the unique game so do hex totems.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt in the dying state...
---
Which is why I no longer worry about them. If I want a 4k, I'll play for the 4k. The best one I got over the weekend was getting accused of tunneling when there was 1 gen left. Like I should just concede at that point? The best part? They got caught in a trap. Wasn't even chasing them.
---
why sprint burst is better
---
But you only got 10k. Im assuming you got trap door almost immediately. Not to mention the ranks.
---
Nope went through gate.
---
this is great
---
Thays a good idea, no more Survivors all DCing because I burned a shroud of separation :l
---
So he closed the td then.
---
i dont play nurse
---
That's just effects SWF who are already a cancer to this game. But I can't count how many birthday cakes were wasted when the killer disconnected while the game was loading. Now, they just do right after the match starts.
---
Theres a reason DH was the most used exhaustion perk at high ranks. Must be because its a useless perk and all thr red rank survivors dont know what theyre talking about right?
---
Perfect Dwight skin for facing a Shirtless Myers.
---
Actually try, I mean Myers.
---
Do Bill mains fall under this rule or no ?
---
Every time I play the game people rage quit
---
That's what the devs mentioned doing in the Q&amp;A, so hopefully we'll see it.
---
tru3 at least 2times(he uploaded it) but literally everybody who is at least mediocre with killer will do it with ease
---
your flair :(
---
oh yeah I've seen tru3 beating him, the post made me think he got beaten in a recent livestream or something like that
---
Clown is super overrated. His gas doesn't actually do anything without add-ons. He slows down by 15% to throw it and it slows survivors by 15% for 2 seconds, plus the base reload timer is way too long. Safe loops are still safe.
---
oh no, i just didnt have a better idea for a shitpost
---
I agree with the meme &amp; approve of the smol Billy.
---
I don't think 's has to necessarily signify is. From what I understood of apostrophes, they are used in a place where you omit letters. In "something is" to "something's" you would omit the "i" in is, but it can also mean "something has", leaving out the "ha". But I looked it up more out of curiosity and the apostrophe really doesn't make sense here because a commonly clipped word like "gen" is not considered a contraction. It becomes a new word stem where normal grammar rules apply. You could still apostrophe out a middle part though, like gen'rator.
---
no i think killers should have the priorty since they are more map oriented because of their power
---
No Dwight?! :(
---
Idk, I feel like this format doesnt really work with this situation. Why is blood warden shooting dwight getting hooked? It should shoot you.
---
Insert "I guess" meme
---
Is he still a thing? Around the time I last played, everyone was celebrating because he got banned
---
There are many situational perks, but very few that are literally dead weight until the very end and potentially not good even then.
---
nah,i did not have a better idea
---
Belle is smart for keeping her distance from a group of murderous teens
---
Unlikely, but you can look in the [Trading sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DBDTrade/) and hope you get lucky.
---
tbh i just want no mither to give you bp boost as a reward, like billy addons that take away instadowm chainsaw. it just makes sense and yet here we are
---
wow that was ambitious
---
I think the guy above got most of it right.
---
Vacuum Pallets: Gone (that might be earlier)
---
Window Vault: You now need to be running head on to the window to fast vault. Failure to do so will result in a medium vault. Pallet vaults are unchanged.
---
everyone has suggested this and they said no, they 100% want to keep it so that you start injured
---
I‚Äôm I had one game where this guy was t bagging in the exit gate, I had 8 stacks so I hit him 3 times (MoM) because he didn‚Äôt realize the cooldown was so short. His 2 teammates tried to body block and I was able to down 1 and hook the one I was holding. I love STBFL
---
agree
---
**n u t**
---
no mither won't be touched
---
So I should DC after I get Haddonfield.  
---
Just like usual, got it.
---
Killer offerings are twice as effective as survivor's.
---
Kids haven‚Äôt evolved past 2008, I see
---
You spelled Placebo wrong.
---
As a legion main, I think you did a pretty good ... JOb so far!
---
National Jamboree?
---
I understand that, I'm agreeing with /u/fragileItalianCheese. Sorry, I realize my post wasn't clear now that I've read it again.
---
Or uninstall the game. I don't know what you want from me ‚Ä¶ I can't stop or prevent shitty players from being shitty.
---
I've been using aftercare a lot, it really helps randoms figure out where gens are and stops them from bringing the killer to you (sometimes)
---
Yeah Hybrid is over 500k
---
LolüòÇüòÇ is this pic from a movie?
---
Wish I could fucking afford that, but more like national killing spree
---
Well if you stop tunneling as the killer the survivors may stick around?  
---
All kidding aside, they have mentioned in their stream that they can't ban players for something they know exists and can't fix within their system. Once dedicated servers arrive they can easily monitor DC's and soft ban accordingly. They mention in their most recent server updates.   
---
Also, the longer you play killer the more used to Dc's you will get.
---
you're using it wrong. the correct way to use it is to get to a window or pallet in time.
---
Hell yea, it's balanced because nurse or spirit can can still win it! Kinda like mettle of man. I can tell you that enduring spirit fury would be even worse against this, because you could afford throwing pallets slightly earlier
---
I think most people don't remember how stupidly strong multiple sprint bursts was, even with 80 second cooldown. If
---
I was around from the start the game was way worse back in the day, perks were so much more toxic, instant blinds, old Moris, ACTUAL infinites, pallet vacuum and so much more...
---
I still remember when they added a ping indicator and I didn't have to 1 the chat to check it
---
please don't mention urban here I'll vomit
---
i mean the map ones no others
---
Rip
---
Just enjoy the salt, smile, and move on. Is all you can do.
---
Lmfao. I swear once the memes calling people out for not doing totems started EVERYBODY‚Äôs been cleansing totems. I dont even run hex perks anymore since they get wiped in the first 45 seconds.
---
oh my bad
---
The real legends do that without having dead hard. Fake it till you make it.
---
Sweet!
---
Fairly sure suvivor map offerings trump killer offerings.
---
who complains about hanzo now that scatter is gone?
---
An in-game chat filter would be a good start, but only if it could be turned off as the player wishes. I'd also recommend harsher punishments for toxicity, as well as a "thank you for your feedback" message if someone you reported as toxic is banned. I know a lot of games with playerbases which don't trust the reporting feature due to the lack of feedback. A simple "we've taken action against a player you've recently reported" message would go a long way to making the community more active in reporting toxicity. Behavior could even provide small rewards (100 Shards?) if a toxic player you reported is banned.
---
How am I supposed to ‚Äúgive the other side a chance‚Äù when he refuses to leave me alone give ME a chance to play? Running the killer may be fun at first, but it just gets super stressful because you know you‚Äôre getting facecamped and depipped the second you‚Äôre downed.
---
**The Nurse**
---
*Plaid Flannel*
---
allows you to attack while blinking
---
(e.g. in the middle of a long blink, you can attack before you‚Äôve reached the end, at any point while you‚Äôre teleporting)
---
I think it would be more of a fun thing and not really game-breaking at all.
---
He's not even complaining dude.He's saying killers do the same toxic shit which is why survivors run the same meta perks too.
---
No, I'm just getting better at individual killers, and when I have a good amount of "skill and time" set into them, I can switch to other killers until I have pretty much all of them perfected if you will, then i would switch it up between killers. I would really like to know how it wouldn't work though. :)
---
Give me a reason to counter it with Sole Survivor
---
Sprint Burst is worse

---
It's not supposed to be used for baiting hits, it's for looping. If you mess up during a loop and get too greedy, you can dead hard and make it to the pallet anyway. It's supposed to give you extra time for looping. It's good because it's the only exhaustion perk that you can activate pretty much any time you want. I still think balanced landing is a better exhaustion perk but dead hard is up there, people just don't understand how to use it.
---
When I see a survivor run MoM or Adrenaline*
---
(For the record,  I don't have a problem with NOED, MoM, or Adrenaline. People should learn how to work around them instead of just bitching about them)
---
Fully agree with this meme.
---
Also toxic is a buzz word for SJWs.
---
So it's useless on the pig?
---
I get what you were going for but it doesn't work
---
I hate when people use memes they dont understand
---
Did you get hooked by the survivors? Like 3 times?
---
I was high when I made this post and don't really understand what I wrote. But 29 upvotes. This community is something else.
---
But if no offerings exist then it would be fair all around.
---
yet both EAC and devs said they don't really care so I think we're clear.
---
She's a fun killer that will never be Top Tier, if you dont care about that. Her gameplay is fun and rewarding unlike legion, who's only power is to vault over pallets quickly....
---
Guess they‚Äôre okay with perks being garbage
---
where exactly? do you have a website or a direct link? thx for the reply
---
Hey man 1100ms is an ok ping on console heh
---
Hey, some of may be toxic but we have standards where we draw the line.
---
street meg / sf claud sells for around ¬£90 so around $105.
---
still one of the cheaper cosmetics to buy.
---
you won't get it for $60, but crypter is a very trustworthy seller on steam, i bought all mine from them
---
Pigs addons need a buff
---
Bullying new players isn't really my cup of tea, tbh
---
Honestly English is just one big mess
---
not an event just a thing you can sign up to help with in ptb
---
Well, it's the exact same mindset I had. I wanted to just switch between all the killers, but once you get good at one, you always feel an urge to go back to your better killer.
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm talking about
---
I gotta be honest I'm not sure people are DC'ing on purpose. 
---
I was playing with my sister and got DC'd a few times in a couple hour session. On my screen it showed DC for the killer. I wasn't de-pipped. I got a message that said host had disconnected. 
---
She stayed in the match all of these time and she said it would happen after large lag issues.   
---
I play a good amount of multiplayer games in different Genres but DBD is the only one where I have this happen.
---
I'm still pretty sure we know how his full power will function, just maybe not things like numbers and smaller things
---
Nope. The killer shouldn't voluntarily take the stun for free but still goad the Survivor into dropping it. How easy this is depends on how smart the survivor actually is or how on point their timing is. 
---
Take the stun if it means forcing it down but if the Survivor just waits there to drop it try to swing through it. It's all about forcing Pallets down no matter what through psychological manipulation. Not every killer can just force a pallet down so you have to get creative and give them a reason to. 
---
But if they just DH and drop it when you're out of range, then...
---
You displeased the Entity by asserting your dominance. You made them feel bad :(
---
&gt;which definitely gives them an advantage over the solo players the game is balanced around.
---
HAHAHA Are we still pretending SWF is some new shit that hasn't been thought about balance wise
---
I meant Killer map offerings specifically.
---
Even worse, sometimes you get downed and you get up right as the killer is done wiping his blade
---
I was *sure* it was the other way around, though.
---
I say Trapper wuthout add ons, otherwise leather face
---
Have they changed how it gets triggered? I only ask because every time I get rescued/unhook someone, even with both of us crouching, it seems to trigger the traps.
---
Some people are just toxic and will find something to bitch about. I don‚Äôt see toxic killers as often, but I don‚Äôt play survivor as much (and not very well) so I can‚Äôt really comment on that. I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs someone like that in every fourth or fifth game I play on PC as killer. I always say gg and occasionally gently razz if a survivor was particularly tough to nail down (e.g., ‚Äúfuckin nea, hold still more and this will go faster‚Äù).
---
-	If it was a 4K, it‚Äôs because I was running crutch perks or an overpowered killer because I suck.
---
-	If it was a 1K-3K and the toxic individual died, it‚Äôs because I was camping/tunneling because I suck. (This always perplexes me, because it seems that what they want was for me to have walked to the opposite corner of the map even if I suspect 1-2 crouchers nearby, but whatever.)
---
-	If it was a 1K-3K and the toxic individual lived, it‚Äôs because I suck so hard even my camping/tunneling crutch-perk/crutch-killer using ass couldn‚Äôt even kill them. 
---
-	If everyone escapes, they‚Äôll either take the opportunity to teabag at the exit and shit-talk in post-game, or they‚Äôll tear into whichever teammate they‚Äôve decided was most useless.
---
The toxic mindset is that they know whether someone played ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù, and it‚Äôs their job to put that player in their place. I‚Äôve engaged with a few players like this and, in my experience, they‚Äôve never acknowledged that the behavior is problematic, just that it‚Äôs their opinion and they have the right to say it.
---
It‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs also not the norm in the ranks I play at on my platform of choice. So saying that there isn‚Äôt a culture of toxicity is probably accurate. Saying that toxic players aren‚Äôt common enough to be remarked upon feels disingenuous though at worst and ignorant at best.
---
Until recently I was a dual rank 1 on both sides.  But I haven't been playing as much lately.
---
Ruin is active, but Dwight has stakeout. But a Tier 1 M&amp;A Myers is the killer
---
Yeah and dead hard should have a skill check omegalul
---
Also true for survivors
---
I do declare that you *ooze* manliness, good sir.
---
[X] Doubt
---
But serious talk, when I used to stream as a lady, I would get the worst sexual biased comments, nowadays if I stream as a dude, they're more general nasty comments. Either way people are bitter as shit.

99% of Trappers have NOED

Pretending people don't play meta characters and perks because they're strong? Lol
---
Thank you for actually answering me. He sounds like someone the community doesnt need.
---
I believe he got IP banned last I remember, he switched to ps4 got banned for ban evasion i think and has quietly been on xbone
---
It's super problematic, because it is a bug with the game. Just yesterday, I had a match where it said the Host disconnected and everyone made it out alive. Meanwhile, my friend, our other teammates, and the killer were still in a game getting slaughtered.
---
I have absolutely nothing to add here. You're spot on.
---
I'd slap the plague between huntress and Hag, personally. Other than that... seems on point.

What you just Said doesn't give proof i didn't complain i Said that i didn't understand why us survs get camped and then killer mains are super angry about us running stronger perks
---
Nah i don't care, he apologized about that so he became a better person. I'm not even one of he's suscriber and i believe in every human to be better. I don't have rancor. Please do so

yeah, a better one for this would be the simpsons one where they hit each other with chairs

Yup, its a good thing you called me the whole place is infested. Ill fetch my hatchet.

I'm sure it's a noob pretending to be ochido, don't lie to get cocky that way dude
---
Nurse.
---
Freddy.
---
I like hurting people.
---
Don't know if it's still a thing, but opening a locker with a survivor inside while using Deerstalker is the creepiest thing I've seen in this game.
---
That still doesn't explain the cesspool of toxicity in PC
---
this is a KYF lobby
---
Not trying to get cocky. Ochido just can‚Äôt play well in red ranks. Also, I‚Äôm pretty sure Ochido‚Äôs psn was Ochido22, which is also who I played with ü§îü§îü§î
---
I haven't gotten sexual comments yet, I'm still new
---
It feels worse in this game I think because it‚Äôs more personal. As a killer you are the only person on your team and the gameplay systems facilitate a lot of safety in the survivor team so long as they are in a group and the killer doesn‚Äôt have an insta-down. There‚Äôs a reason the concept of bullying the killer exists ‚Äî once survivors understand what they can and can‚Äôt get away with while still escaping, poor sportsmen can and do use that to tilt their opponent.
---
Luckily, at least at the ranks I play at, toxic players aren‚Äôt very common.
---
Hmm interesting
---
It‚Äôs not just for dodging, it can give you that extra little distance to reach that pallet or window.
---
I don't know. It should be one when two things ally (blood warden and egc) and use one object (dwight hooked) to smack something (me tbagging at the gates).
---
They likely spend most their time alone in their maps unless called to The Bonfire in the center of their side for a meeting, mostly to talk of new killers and changes to trials. Trapper, of course, is the leader whom the Entity sends messages through. The Entity feeds off emotion, so complete isolation of the killers wouldn't feed it as much. By playing off kinship and turmoil when the killers are forced to interact it gets larger feedings. It all depends on how much the Entity warps them outside of trials and if it might purposely calm them at their camp so their energy is spent for sacrifices. 
---
Legion might have spats but they have too strong a bond to disconnect for long. Nurse and Wraith are somewhat confirmed to be lovers by BHVR. For many of the others it might just depend on mood and circumstance. Except for Freddy - everyone hates Freddy. Even The Entity hates Freddy.
---
Aren‚Äôt there dedicated servers now?
---
Still does way too much damage at close range for a sniper and I just hate snipers. Getting one shotted from across the map isn't fun or have counter play.
---
with someone else's Leader, Wake Up, Resilience and Spine Chill, you open the gate 55% faster, for which is 20 / 1.55 = 12.90 seconds. 
---
without someone's Leader it'd take you 20/1.30 = 15.38 seconds
---
My pleasure.
---
No worries, he actually used to be one of the few youtubers people could watch. Back in the day Monto wasn't popular, noob3 wasn't really popular and he was pretty similar to ochido in a sense and people like farmer John weren't there. Only others I could think of are hybridpanda and truetalent. Thankfully around spirits release people started to realize who he really is
---
Nah still the same, maybe the person on the hook isnt holding crouch while getting unhooked? Or the hag runs the addon that allows her to teleport to any trap.
---
I wouldn t but ok
---
He‚Äôs complimenting how much of an epic gamer you are
---
Right. Not sure what‚Äôs triggering it, but it looks like it has something to do with disagreements between the game state between server and survivor. 
---
After the first time, I paid attention to why was going on and the key telling one was when I went for a save, my sister got hit with a big lag spike, I make a save, the killer hit the person I saved which should have triggered borrowed time, but instead she went back to dying. I told my sister ‚Äúbug, borrowed time didn‚Äôt activate‚Äù and then I immediately DC‚Äôd and she came back from the lag with the killer standing next to the hook swinging at a survivor on the hook. 
---
I actually told her ‚Äúuh oh. Buddy got mad I made a rescue.‚Äù She replied with ‚Äúit happened again.

Devs are saying it'll be here in a few months

---
The current ranking system is for lack of a better word, shit. Since ranks reset every month, there should be no depipping.
---
If they held a double BP match every month people wouldn't be so focused on getting them vs trying to win the game.
---
It wont be long before someone pops your cherry... owait
---
I might be stupid but can't find. I only see the full colored one.
---
You essentially just camped, and camping isn't bannable, so you're good.
---
One with counterplay and one without counterplay.... what is the difference between perk A where it can be baited and played around or perk B where you gotta take it or just not hit em
---
Gosh.... this one is a puzzler...
---
I absolutely agree, Black Box is a total waste. If ANYTHING, it's marginally helpful for Dying Light, and if your obsession starts near ANYONE, it's not even helpful then.
---
&gt; Assuming one or two players is killed, the survivors will absolutely do as much as a killer.
---
Uh huh.. hiding is just as difficult as searching a map. Sure. One takes no skill and only requires you to put on the right outfit and sit in a dark corner, the other takes skill. Right.
---
&gt; There‚Äôs a reason why it‚Äôs 1v4, because if it was 1v1 the survivor would never win.
---
Iv4 plus a hatch, plus two doors, plus a bunch of second chance perks. Yeah I'm quite familiar with the odds that BhVR stacks against the killer. It's why I would never say with a straight face that playing survivor is just as difficult as playing killer. It's an utterly ridiculous belief.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs not hard to find a survivor, there‚Äôs certainly no more instinct involved in being a killer than there is a survivor, certainly the same for anticipation, and absolutely skill.
---
Speaking of ridiculous beliefs. Cleaning a totem is no more skillful than walking. You sit down and hold a button for a few seconds. Doing a gen requires more skill than a totem sure since they didn't even bother to allow skillchecks for totems (I guess cause that would be doing too much work according to BHVr), but you'll still only tap a button a handful of times over the course of 80 seconds. There isn't a puzzle involved, there isn't running around and putting items together.  BHvR even thinks that requiring survivors to put gas in a gen would be too taxing on survivors. They don't want playing survivor to be too skillful. They want to keep it as simple as possible. Find a totem and cleanse it, sit at a gen and click a button every 10-20 seconds, run from the killer if he/she finds you but if you mess up here's your second chance crutch perks, and if that doesn't save you you still have your teammates to unhook you, and if none of that saves you you still have a hatch and two doors.
---
I would feel playing survivor is just as skillful as playing killer if they gave survivors more to do such as having to find and put in gas to start a gen, having to repair the door panel door before being able to flip the switch.. something ANYTHING that could be called a legitimate secondary objective(s). But we both know that's not gonna happen now don't we?
---
&gt;The whole point of 1v4 is because you need 4 people in order to actually complete all the tasks require with a chance to survive.
---
&gt; What do killers do that‚Äôs so difficult?
---
It's 1v4 yet you still ask what does the killer do that's so difficult. You answered your own question. 1v4 makes it more difficult by default. 16 perks (much HIGHER QUALITY perks btw) against 4 and our most powerful perks can be cleansed and rendered utterly useless even though we were already at a disadvantage of 16 perks vs 4. If a killer brings in 3 hex perks they could end up with 1 perk vs 16 perks which cannot be cleansed. Yeahhh sounds fair.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs not hard to find a survivor, there‚Äôs certainly no more instinct involved in being a killer than there is a survivor, certainly the same for anticipation, and absolutely skill. 
---
Well see, survivors don't glow with a fire like totems do, so it actually takes some work to find a survivor, especially survivors with dark clothes and survivors with speed perks. And finding them is only the first step. We then have to successfully chase them down TWICE and hit them TWICE unless we have an instadown/chainsaw. And then we have to find another survivor and repeat. That's 12 successful chases that have to end in 12 successful downs, then 12 successful hooks. And in the midst of all of that we have to keep watching our hooks and chase people from them, watch our totems and chase people from them, prevent 5 gens from being completed by finding and chasing people using them, and at the end for all of our work we get to chase people from two doors and an opened hatch. Did I mention having to deal with a bunch of second chance perks in the midst of doing all of that? 
---
And did I mention that killers don't have another person off site helping them like survivors do on comms? It's a one-person show as killer. It's all on us, we have no help from other people. So yeah.. it's a shit ton of work as a killer. Survivors don't come close to matching a killer's output. And survivors being the same skill level as killer? Laughable.
---
&gt; Eat a sandwich and play? Jesus go play as survivor before trying to have an argument about something you know nothing about.
---
I played survivor plenty. Playing as a solo survivor requires more skill and much more work. Playing as a SWF is the game on easy mode since they have 6 or 7 built-in perks in addition to the 4 extra ones they bring it. SWFs require the least amount of skill of them all. But playing as killer is at least three times the work in general. I stand by my stance.
---
Fuuuuuuuuu
---
Happy Clown's got the colored perks, but with red backgrounds in a different file.  
---
I don't know of any non-colored ones.
---
I play survivor and killer half and half, but one time I was playing survivor and fealt overzelous and t bagged at the gate. I got suddenly t3 Myers. I was like "yea I deserved that"
---
Here's the first one! ;)
---
When I play survivor I actually love this cause you get 2 gens right next to each other and if a killer ignores it or goes on a chase you can knock out both for massive gameplay advantage
---
tbh i think it should just give you more bp for using it.
---
You forgot camped as well :D
---
thats true actually i overlooked this
---
lmfaoo i don't play ow anymore but i was a mccree main
---
Idk what it is but when people edit asking "really guys? Downvotes?" I just find it hilarious
---
Doctor all the way, but I will play wraith sometimes.
---
Just because he apologized doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not a pedo.
---
You can also use it prevent getting hostaged by a killer due to it avoiding collision and survive risky hook saves (such as basement).
---
Same thing with me.
---
1. The devs still balance around solos. They really shouldn't, but they do. The Plague is a perfect example of this; a killer who is great against solos since they end up cleansing, but is terrible against SWF since they can be on the same page and make sure nobody cleanses. It's also evident in how, even when generalized for all ranks, a 4-man has a 5% higher win rate than solos.
---
2. 4-man lobbies aren't terribly common, but you don't need a four man lobby to get an advantage. Even just two people on comms is a pretty big boost. That's also not the point. Just because it's not every match doesn't mean it's a fair match when it happens. 1 in 20 lobbies isn't a Boogeyman.
---
People that say "we're not toxic" are toxic themselves, this community is one of the most toxic out of many. Unless you people have a different defintion of toxic for this game what most people see in game is constant bullshit, casual, toxic behavior.
---
I personally think Jake's screams are pretty great
---

You're a lost cause when you think this is happening lol

Devs would be too lazy to make 10 different mori animations
---
tbh when he got leaked i was expecting you to enter a completely different version of the map that only other asleep survivors are in and to wake you up, the awake survivors have to find your body and wake you up.
---
What if they were running the add on that only wounds?
---
Ive been trying to bring attention to this perk ever since the release of endgame. It needs a rework and something fierce.
---
I hadn't thought about that, actually. Truth be told whenever I have been accidentally DC'd it is always through a lag problem hitting before it happens.
---
Sometimes you just know you're getting facecamped. Had a myers find me within the first 20 seconds of a game yesterday and he chased me for all five Gen's. First time I've ever managed to run a killer so well. I just knew I was getting facecamped when I finally got downed. At first I was proud of myself but I realized he was just likely new or bad and I'm not as good as I think I am.
---
I started playing when Huntress Freddy came out, I use Pc. My first main was wraith and nurse and my current is spirit and legion. 
---
(Oh I still like myers and he's a definite main/classic go to for me and I'm switching legion for hag as one of my mains.)
---
Oh I'm not saying you should, just that the game expects you to IF you want to pip. In your scenario, you should give up earlier, go on a hook. Your team, instead of doing generators efficiently, should stop and save you, get hooked a few times themselves to get some more unhooks and chases etc. It's a ridiculous system.   
---
  
---
Same goes for killers if they're doing too well. If you're too fast and efficient, you will depip or safety pip at most.  
---
My point is, it's not just the survivor who runs the killer for 5 gens. EVERYONE gets punished if they play too well. I don't know what they were thinking when they designed this.
---
Getting that adrenaline + sprint burst boost felt real good not gonna lie.
---
I stopped placing traps at pallets and put them around the loop instead, I find that more people walk into it that way. Putting traps on uses pallets instead of breaking them often works too, but I wouldn‚Äôt do it to every single one as most survivors will catch on
---
When they start giving rewards for devotion.
---
You need a merciless killer not a 4k
---
What do they say?

very unique but I'm not sure how good she is. I don't like her too much personally but she was fun at the start for sure. Maybe it's just me.

---
I used to play with NOED a lot.  
---
I'm not playing with it for three reasons:  
---
1) I feel like I don't deserve a win sometimes.  
---
2) I've improved much more without NOED than when I was using it.  
---
3) I usually don't see all gens get powered, so NOED is just a waste of a perk slot. I could instead use Whispers, Spirit Fury, or Nurse's.
---
There are other pedos in the internet dude, it pedochido! Mods and admins if his discord and a lot of victims spoke out, that he herasses and wants nudes from 14 years old "loyal fund" dude!
---
Add-ons spawn no hag plus turns user's TR to 0 = Hag RKO outta nowhere
---
People have a "toxic" experience 1 in 20 games, then complain on Reddit that people are toxic in every 5 games and the comments say "Do we play the same game? I face a toxic 4 man SWF every match and they DC on first hit!"
---
Freddy is the worst killer. He is heavily add on dependent and his ability makes it so he has low gate pressure, can't proximity camp ( or apply pressure at the hooks).   
---
However, all killers can be strong in the right hands.
---
Actually the best comments here, also regains sanity again.
---
crazy to put spirit and hag anywhere that isn't A imo. Also yeah plague A? Idk. And bubba B? I'm starting to disagree a lot on this lol.
---
T-bagging at the end is still toxic, and taunting tbh, just like after pallets and windows
---
god, the survivor side of this community seems to be were i see the most toxicity on here, strait up ignoring everything that is op
---
Omegalul

Crouchdette
---
That doesn't excuse the fact that he was doing it in the first place. He also started witch hunts on innocent players, abuses bugs and glitches, and is overall toxic. He also continues to evade his bans by creating new accounts and switching platforms. He may have admitted to his pedophilia and apologize for it, but that does not mean he has become a better person.

Might wanna try there.

*majority of games have post game chat saying ‚ÄúGG EZ BABY KILLER‚Äù*
---
*Survivors exploit flawed game design to piss off killers*
---
*tea bagging at the gate is considered normal*
---
*SFW is a literally an option that lets friends communicate with eachother to have a significant advantage over the killer, and is easily done to piss off killers*
---
*DBD dev team constantly makes questionable balance decisions and never addresses the game‚Äôs underlying issues*
---
*Game has a lot of options that survivors and killers can take advantage of to not make the game fun for either side*
---
Yeah this game definitely isn‚Äôt toxic, let‚Äôs be blindly optimistic and maybe it‚Äôll go away that way.

you only need 1 exhaustion perk to run the killer. That being said the other perks you run should allow you more time ( or your team mates time to outlast the killer).   
---
I play swf and solo, my perk build is as follows :  
---
Solo: kindred, balanced landing, adrenaline, borrowed time  
---
SWF: unbreakable, balanced landing, adrenaline, borrowed time  
---
If your add-ons are low drop kindred or unbreakable for ace in the hole.

Actually every meme gets it wrong. It should be 
---
Everyone:
---
a lot of perks can be considered "dead weight" until they activate. Not a lot of perks are active throughout the whole match, or at least have pre requisites, or stipulations for activating.
---
For NOED specifically, the fact that it even exists already makes survivors question cleansing dulls or not. Whether it's worth wasting time doing so or if it will literally be a waste of time.
---
Same can be said about other perks like that's basically the design of all Hex totems, or even survivor perks like DS or unbreakable.

Highly doubt it.

His head can't fit sideways through doors or windows so he's immediately out though. He would clip into trees while turning around in a number of maps (mainly red forest) and I'm sorry PH fans, it just won't happen unless they severely shrink his head or just turn clipping off and embrace the "okay so his head is in a tree?" Bill shit
---
First day in the internet?

ok so if a mass murderer apologizes they will magically be a better person?
---
I barely run it myself, save for a certain end-game build on Freddy. Most of the times that I used it, I either get a 4k with only 2 or 3 gens done, or all survs are still alive when the last gen pops and I'm forced to camp one survivor that I just happened to stumble upon and hit with NOED (often one that has not been hooked before). I hate camping from both sides. It's stressful in endgame and not even fun to do (or experience as a survivor). I haven't played killer since the EGC was introduced, so that might make it less stressful, but still unfun.
---
This is what I need in my life ^(and death.)

What a qaste of money.. he capuld buy himself a new outfit for that cost..

Yeah I guess. Not a big deal either way.

They said he would ask for nudes in his discord then ostrisize any girl that said no. I dont recall seeing be underaged girls but I havent looked into it a lot. If it was underaged girls idk why no one has reported him. That's extremely negligent if it's true.

DEAD HARD DEAD HARD DEAD HARD

They gonna rework it btw so that instadowns will get it triggered but the method of getting full MoM stacks will be different.
---
You need to double pip for the adept trophy now.
---
I came back after stopping in early-mid 2018. The amount of improvements seems really good. It's kind of sad though that I'm surprised the devs are actually addressing issues that have been around for a long long time. I kind of figured something like the new endgame and fixing legion would never come.
---
No she doesnt lmao, only time she gets any tracking is if she runs an ultra rare addon.
---
As a Kate main, I thank you! I also run BT and always go back for the save. It's my favourite part of the game.

The hoops some people jump through is insane. Got a 4k today and this Claudette called me a tunneler. Funny part was I was trying not to concentrate on the same person but couldn't tell anyone apart because three of them switched to the same brown Claudette cosmetics.
---
No matter how sneaky you are, you're going to get caught at some point either from being unlucky, a bug in the game, or a toxic teammate. The experience becomes even more sour if you get camped/tunneled/farmed as a result
---
This is all so wholesome. :D
---
Totally agree. Whats up with the billy though ?
---
If its a 2 dollar battle pass then sure. Its kind pointless just for skins or cosmetics it doesnt really matter.
---
The community is most certainly 'toxic' and is honest to god up there as potentially one of the worst communities I've ever played with in PC gaming over the last 15 years.
---
I'm not going to stalk your post history, because i don't care enough, not sure about you, but i have much better things to do than piss someone off in a video game, and then post it on reddit so i can get praise from the echo chamber in this sub.

I agree with you Ciegsarbed4ru. Great that your other posts are not like this but I don¬¥t care who is the one posting . I don¬¥t like this kind of content and I guess I will scroll past the next time indeed

OP bullshit

Oh okay cool! Also I like your flair, very relatable

Youre right. When i started i was a tru3 fan, but i realized when i hit yellow ranks that he was dogshit

If you don't care enough, don't generalise. Simples.

"Yeah, he sexually harassed a bunch of underage girls for nudes and made them feel extremely uncomfortable, but he made a fake apology so it's okay"

Kinda proving my point there buddy

I get the point you're making, man. But as I said, unless the mods deem it as against the rules, my screenshot has as much right to exist as most posts.
---
Wraith's reworks made him better. Still not like amazing, but viable (though I liked playing him even before that)

To add to what he said, its also seen as bad for killers as they can be ultra organised via voice chat, giving them a clear advantage in a game where you arent supposed to have such

Your point was an assumption. I legitimately experince toxicity every 1 in 3 games.

Some advice on using Whispers. Against stealthy players use it to triangulate survivor positions but judging how it behaves on the border of its activation. This way you can not only know theyre here, but also in what general direction they are hiding/croutching to

Probably yes considering the devs need to constantly come up with patches and updates to fulfill everyone‚Äôs appetite?

yes and no with a battle pass the skins would be ofc be chosen before so the pass would be really long if you would have a skin for everybody and also that some characters would come before others. How would dlc characters work buying a battle pass when you don't have all characters leaves a lot of skins unusable and it feels like it would be to clustered but it would still be a fun thing to grind on
---
I receive toxic or hateful messages after at least 70% of my killer matches.
---
Well, it would be funny to get blocked in a bathroom in gideon map seeing him menacingly staring at you.
---
OP as f for survivors
---
If they're running you long enough to Sprint burst 2+ times with no mither, that's on you at this point.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre referring to, can you explain please
---
How do you decide toxicity? TB? Sure, happens all the time. Players sending you unprovoked vulgar messages, killers holding you hostage, fellow survivors intentionally getting you killed? No way that's happening 1 in 3 games.
---
Self care is useless against most **KILLERS.**
---
Totally agree, Its a common effort we have to make to make this community better
---
Hopefully you'll be able to avoid some of the bullshit. If not, murder them.
---
You should still be able to hatch grab if they are in dying. That was bullshit lol.
---
i'm a jake main and i can confirm the only times i've done sabo is for a ritual
---
Well that does mean that you waited for endgame chat to pop up, and if you did to only say gg props to you
---
They have to change up the shards. Get rid of altruism and make it simply be based on how many survivors escape. That way you can do well at chases and this one and still likely pip (since you will also do decent at survival by staying alive so long).
---
Thanks for your response! I definitely did consider making a smooth mask with paper mache but I was working with a budget and wanted to get it done within the weekend. Perhaps one day I'll give it another shot with some more time and money on my hands :)
---
Dont argue with a troll OP.
---
Be sure to post the result after!
---
It would definitely help engage me more. However my issue with battle passes is the exclusivity of them. I wouldn't wanna have to buy the whole pass if I only like one set for a character. So maybe if the pass was just a cheaper way to get some cosmetics but they were sold separately it would be nice. Tbh though id buy it regardless
---
Good luck seeing him play it again he might in a few weeks but as of late he's been memeing on his fans by saying maybe in another year!
---
Keep in mind that it only applies if the survivor is dead on hook, else it would be slowed
---
Hey man....you uh...camped insta ban..48 hrs!
---
D a r n
---
its not about your skill in one area its about being good in every category
---
The wind? Nigga, that‚Äôs an angry vacuum cleaner.
---
*Maybe?* xd that's a concept for another day
---
I mean, there is also that flipside xD
---
It's not bannable, it just shows you beeing an ass :-)
---
Banned...you cheated, lagswitched, tunneled, and camp. Youre basically ochido...banned. lol
---
So long as you got 9 hooks in you should double pip and get the Adept, you don‚Äôt need to 4K anymore.
---
i honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too annoying sometimes. a lot of the time someone is self caring to get a skill check and don‚Äôt run away early enough before i come to them and then it‚Äôs an easy kill. what‚Äôs really annoying is the frequency of skill checks
---
Just because she kidnapped some girls doesn't mean she's lesbian. I don't think somewhere said that she raped them or something.
---
Also, you clearly didn't see Samination animations if you think Huntress can love a man.
---
Yep
---
I don't take NOED for one because I main Huntress, and two because if I can't get my kills before they power the gates I didn't get really get them. Third NOED is a crutch perk and there are way better perks that are more useful.
---
I hate playing killer, I always say gg at the end because being killer is tough and people get too salty
---
Normally it's annoying but tbagging during the mori just kills me.
---
Yea because it's so hard to get a 40sec chase when you can safely transition between loops
---
i was playing killer and some Meg was pointing at a David but i was dumb and thought she was just bm‚Äôing so i killed both of them. then in the end game chat she said that she was trying to get me to kill David because he said the n word a lot in the lobby before the game started. i should‚Äôve listened to her pointing. i felt bad. but he got super salty afterwards so it was kinda worth
---
Absolutely not.
---
the killer spawns are absolutely ass on that map
---
Well see the thing is the Overwatch team are a bunch of lazy hacks.
---
You have to have some form of human verification behind an arbitrary system like "toxicity." It's easy enough to say "this guy was mean to me" but teabagging and telling someone that you'll go to their house and skullf-k their parents are two very different things.
---
I'd honestly be okay with a CS:GO-esque "Overwatch" system where players can review reported chat logs and flag them as toxic. Reviewing toxicity (as well as hacks) in game will have to come when a replay system is implemented.
---
That‚Äôs downright motivational
---
\*enduring\*
---
Yea it's just them waiting to see what the killer does. I do this too.
---
We gotta stick together ü§ôüèº
---
This kind effort should definitely reduce the wish list for this game moving forward.
---
I never understood the complaining about post game chat (on PC at least). You can leave instantly and never see it...
---
Yeah, because it's so hard to hit a survivor once. 
---
See how that works?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true but then you can laugh about them popping out of nowhere
---
I‚Äôm not defending OchiDo, because I think he‚Äôs an asshole and a toxic shitlord, but these are allegations. There was no solid proof, like DM‚Äôs or video clips of him asking for the stuff. I get it we all hate him, I hate him too, but this stuff is serious. I don‚Äôt think just flat out calling him a pedophile when we have very little proof is good at all.
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
yea but with bbq if you are in range when it proc and you go out of rang while it's still on, you won't be seen. So it seem to affect only survivor that are far enough to be seen.
---
The kicker is that‚Äôs there‚Äôs no ingame chat on consoles
---
Not sure on the balance but love the ideas and would love to see this character in the game. 
---
I particularly like the lullaby idea :)
---
For the double pip, yes. But not for the achievement.
---
You can't fix Stupid.
---
I understand but this meme format does not fit
---
Wait.. Player base is declining? But I've heard new people are joining every month
---
Do you know how end game collapse works and the newest dlc?
---
I have read into the leak of the battle pass,  or rumors yet. 
---
But have they said they're going to charge? 
---
If not,  why would anyone be against this? You will get to work for,  and earn skins,  maybe rare items or whatever else they put on there. Instead of having to pay for them,  or save up tons of shards. 
---
I think the battle pass would cause more people to want to play,  and cut lobby times down. So I'm confused why anyone would be mad,  unless we did have to pay since yes this is a paid for game.
---
I understand bming a shitty killer, but bming a baby killer? Lmao get shit on.
---
most likely s/he was bming
---
Easy to say when you're not the person being sexually exploited.
---
hahahaha
---
His head is big for sure, but I don't think it's so big that it'd be a huge problem; it's only an extra foot or so up from a regular head. Clipping would happen probably still happen, definitely on maps like Haddonfield, but I'm a fan of that brand of bullshit, so I'm cool with it. They could even add a quiet \*clank\* or something when he passes his head through a small doorway, or just pass it off as "he's like fog" or something (both games seem to enjoy fog).
---
This game doesn't need more grinding. Especially in the form of timegated cosmetics.
---
If everything from the pass is available after for shards or cells then I'll be alright with it. I won't like it but I'd tolerate it.
---
If the battlepass stuff is completely exclusive it would probably drive me away from the game because nothing is worse than feeling like you *have* to be playing it because then you're not having fun.
---
winning does not = fun
---
So you are?

---
Yea I‚Äôve noticed this for like a week now, it‚Äôs great.
---
Black Ops has a terrible system. The grind takes ages and it has game changing items in it.
---
Dead By Daylight has fucked up drag
---
We'll make it = best team player perk
---
Plenty of reasons. When they do it, though, I can almost hear their heads being swung around like *whoosh*.
---
Yeah, i couldn‚Äôt find how long a slowed timer lasted, so I couldn‚Äôt work around it
---
By my experience... I've gotten far more and more frequent hate messages and toxic behaviour in-game in this game than any other game I've played. I used to play Gears of War, that community was somewhat toxic, I used to play For Honor and that community was fairly toxic and I began playing DBD several months or so ago and I've seen more toxic behaviour from this game than GoW and For Honor combined and then doubled.
---
Yeah like wtf?!
---
I play black ops less than i do dbd and still always get my tiers,  especially with the double xp weekends and stuff they do. Although I do agree they have ridiculous game changing items,  but I do not think it's a terrible system they just miss hitting the mark on balancing basically everything.
---
The last patch was great for me as well personally the prior patch, though good made everything super blurry, the most recent patch has made FPS better and has removed the blurryness.
---
This was before he was banned on PC so idk
---
This looks so great, all of you look awesome!
---
However, longer players know where all the spawns are so your only adding 5-10 seconds. Also, a large group of players play over comms so that adds 0 time for those players.   
---
In red ranks Billy is played ALOT without ruin, he is argueably one of the strongest killers in the game. With enough practice and time you could do the same.
---
Google.
---
Most freddys tunnel a single survivor the entire game. if im that survivor AND i escape... you best believe you eating my butt dance buddy
---
Agreed that it's in the best condition now
---
i think its a great stealth perk because it allows you to know when the killer is coming i think it would be great against spirit and it alway gives you better knowledge of when the killer is coming
---
It means they want you to focus on chasing them while their friends do gens. They'll also crouch/tbag or click their flashlight repeatedly if they have one equipped.
---
i like how this implies the huntress is attracted to the little girls she kidnaps... Yes the straight men are the ones to be looking out for

I'm not sure - does the message you are getting specifically say something about the servers? It seems unlikely to me, but I don't think you could rule it out entirely.

The scariest killer of them all... **THE WATER BOTTLE**
---
Lol sure
---
Oh really? I've never seen that :/ as survivor I've only seen 1 monster dc, and he was being bullied as a new player. As a killer main I love bday cakes because it means the survivors play in really fun ways, lots of chases and saves and stuff
---
what a mad lad
---
How about.. Giving 100% post trial BP like BBQ?
---
I already mentioned in the comments of adding an extra hook before dying.
---
I'd rather they stuck with the BO2 system. Direct purchases only.
---
'cause in order to not waste it you have to walk everywhere, which works in the Killer's favor by slowing the game down.
---

---
My flair is facts.  Nurse is for people who cant win with a balanced killer.  I speak as a killer main.  Respect to people who main literally any killer besides Nurse.
---
Really promising.
---
accept the thicc
---
Its halved
---
I do agree the game is in a good state. There are things that it could improve on, such as console frame rate and certain killers being too powerful/underpowered. They are working on console frames and they have Freddy‚Äôs rework coming out soon so it can only go up from here. However, the community is still very toxic, at least the most vocal ones are toxic.

It is excessive. Everyone knows SWF gains some advantages, but there is counterplay. And tbh, how do you get better at something without challenging yourself?
---
Suicide is badass
---
Me: Has a decent match and they all say GGWP at the end.
---
Also me: Those fuckers are up to something.
---
Holy fuck, I completely forgot about Blood Warden ! How does it work with Endgame collapse now ?!
---
i just want it to not play the injured music
---
like yes, i know im injured. Now more than ever do I need my ears to try to hear more silent killers...
---
It's a way to tilt you. Don't think too much of it
---
It might just be me but having an entire team knowing what the others are doing without wasting a perk slot for aura perks is just not worth dealing with.
---
&gt; hes just your basic bitch toxic survivor
---
so like most streamers who only play Survivor?
---
*Several people are typing. . .*
---
There‚Äôs a chance.  He‚Äôs got a recorded 70+ girls under his belt.
---
I have also been seeing way more SWFs today it's getting kinda annoying seeing MoM and SWFs that just pop 3 gens in like 4 minutes
---
Okay.. I didn‚Äôt Say all that lmaoooooo üòÇ
---
Usually, though I find it useful for when I feel like running the killer around.
---
I'm at like 320 these days, still no reward... So i feel this one big time bahahah.
---
You would think the devs would have Devotion specific costumes you unlock for each character or something.
---
It's almost as if killers want a fair game, HOW DARE THEY
---
Since all the girls she kidnapped were infants that would make her a pedofile, not a lesbian.
---
I'd be very ok with this üëç
---
you can't have it both ways, either get rid of SWFs or balance the game around them. If you want the game to be balanced, then you need to balance from the top down. You can't try to balance around trying to make it accessible to everyone of all skill levels. 
---
&gt;then non-SWF teams will have game rigged against them
---
Think about what you just said? Basically the game with SWFs is rigged against the killer but everyone seems to be ok with that. If you think balancing around SWFs would screw non swfs that should tell you right there how broken SWFs are.
---
Bro just don‚Äôt have friends man, you‚Äôll find games that way.
---
Yeah, mettle had a big part but wasn't the final straw. Freddy is just pretty underpowered right now and a lot of survivors use this to be assholes. I got a little tired of the constant bm even though it doesn't actually matter. The rework might be nice, I just hope they don't butcher him. He really suits a stall style where you use his tracking and the debuffs from dreamworld to keep them all scared and force them to blow up gens, i'd like him to keep something similar to that
---
YES
---
it's a bit like nurse : fun to play against when they are average, boring as hell when they master the character.
---
It‚Äôs still suckish to get as Fred because they can hide in grass and you‚Äôll never see them because the filter‚Äôs constantly blinding you.  this is just me, I wish i could disable the filter.
---
I feel like it would really break her playstyle. At this Ms you cannot catch survivors and are essentially a sitting duck
---
there is something I missed too. The more new stuff they add the more bugs they add too. Cosmetics don't affect it as much since they're low priority but look at how long Meg's bun was spazzing out for, so it would make a small difference now that I think about it but only indirectly
---
what this man said lol

Well it‚Äôs a hell of a lot faster then healing solo with self care, apologies for not knowing the exact numbers.
---
there goes all your karma out the window.
---
Its like teabagging, it varies in function on the context and of the person
---
It even gives you a notification on your hud when someone has it, dude straight up just wanted the points for self caring.
---
Nurse is the only terrifying Killer left in DbD because she is pretty strong, don't take that away from her
---
Let me just do gens, save teamates that haven't been chased all game and escape while I was the only survivor who was chased for 5 gens and got bloodlusted at a pallet while the egc timer ticked down :)
---
The difference being that both adrenaline&amp;hope are guaranteed to activate when their conditions are met.
---
As for MoM, I agree with the dev that they cannot be compared. Many of the killers have no counterplay to it, they have to hit the survivor and if they don't have an instadown or M2 they just get punished. The survivor gets rewarded for losing a chase. I don't care much if it's changed or not, but I think it is flawed by design.
---
well, they need to because without salt miners we would not have a game right lol. Nah there lots of good players who are awesome people. The issue salt miners and redditors highlight the toxic behaviors more then the positive attitude you can have while playing this game. It's sad when someone has to question are they being played lol.
---
or at least a bump in shards received per level, very sad indeed.
---
Ya god damn right it appeals to the Man‚Äôs Fantasy.

---
The problem is, if the killer realizes I‚Äôm in a locker, Head On, run away, Dance With Me, he‚Äôll never know I was there, and I never get hooked, so the killer isn‚Äôt chasing ANYONE, and all 4 survivors can heal or do gens.
---
Game is in a better place than it was in 2016.  No doubt.  But the game is in a rough place right now,  and just because you can say "It isn't 2016 DBD" doesn't mean shit.   Glad the game is better now than it was then with arrow key killers and infinites,  but that does not excuse \*anything\* for how the game is now.  
---
Does that make it ok to update and fix bugs every 3 months with a mid-chapter patch or full on patch?  No.
---
Because the game is in a better place than 2016 does that make it ok to push out DLC that causes instability and more bugs?   No.
---
Is the community toxic?  Every online community is toxic to some degree.   Do I think DBD is more toxic than other communities?  Nope.  But to say the community isn't toxic is not correct.
---
And that, my dudes, is constructive critisism
---
You can use it to get a mid chase boost to a window or pallet. Still beats SB any day.
---
I mean I'm not mad I snorted at it. But I'm mad at myself for laughing
---
There's less extreme way as well. Survivor gameplay is based around the idea that they cannot communicate or share information and require perks for that. This limitation makes coordinated plays challenging and allows killer to take the initiative.
---
SWF with comms break this limitation, getting information that would require perks like Kindred, Bond or even key add-ons to get normally. That is the problem, they have too much information, while randoms are in the dark.
---
However, if devs take a step away from that flawed concept of no communication and allow more baseline information for every survivor (baseline Kindred, ways to communicate, locate the killer, etc.), it will bring random teams much closer to SWF level. Yes, SWF will still be stronger, like coordinated team in any game. But the power gap will be much smaller, allowing for more fair balance.
---
I have seen people use NOED as well as used it myself. Here are some things that I‚Äôve discovered.
---
1. Cleansing totems is not always effective when you‚Äôve got a Nurse or Hag with universal map presence in a place like The Game. You will waste precious minutes totem hunting and being a potato teammate. And this is all for some *hypothetical* perk the Killer may or may not have.
---
2. If you spend valuable time searching and cleansing totems instead of repairing gens, you may have just screwed yourself because now the very last totem is NOED and can‚Äôt be located.
---
3. NOED doesn‚Äôt even work against good SWF who track every totem cleansed. In fact, NOED punishes solo survivors.
---
4. God forbid if the killer face camps, he is guaranteed *at least* two kills. All he has to do is facecamp till the survivor eventually dies. Now, maybe the other survivors rush gens instead of going to the hook. (This is their only counterplay.) If they do that, NOED is up and one or two other kills get secured.
---
5. It just makes you play bad, honestly. When I play killer, I don‚Äôt stress when the gates are powered. More often than not, NOED does activate and I secure free kills on people I may or may not have even downed a single time prior to it activating.
---
6. Finally, the concept of the randomness of where the NOED totem ends up is completely dumb. It could be right next to a hooked survivor or it could appear in front of someone‚Äôs face. Why should the end of a match be decided by a coin toss?? With Ruin, you can power through it or search it out. Even cleansing the totem itself buys some time for the Killer. With NOED, you are a goner if the killer was chasing you as the last gen pops.
---
In conclusion, NOED is indeed crutch, rewards bad plays, penalizes solo survivors instead of SWF, and just straight up is unfun to play against due to its random nature.
---
Power is nice and like the idea, it might be hard for silent hill to allow it though.
---

---
Step 1: choose pig as killer
---
Step 2: choose badham map offering
---
Step 3: down a David and place him to the mattress in the boiler room
---
Step 4: keep him there and wait for other davids
---
Step 5: snu snu party OwO
---
If a killer can't find anyone they'll just turn tail to the hook. Stealth play really only has an advantage against nurse who you can't loop. Otherwise you hiding is just doing a disservice to your team who may be in a worse position and needs a distraction. Stealth players are usually garbage who go down in 3 seconds because they never practice looping.
---
I mean yea that's right. I laughed but I'm mad for realizing my humor is degrading
---
baby dwit
---
My point isn't that other games are more or less toxic than this one, it's that this sub tremendously exaggerates the frequency of toxic actions
---
To be fair some people have bad games.
---
Stop kidding with me whinny kids. Just shut up. I'm pretty sure the next subreddit post will be interesting too.
---
That and alot of his fans found him from MK X. So, there is still an audience there for both games
---
I think a better buff to No Mither would be that you start the trial healthy, but once hit you are broken, and the killer would not see that you are broken. From the killer‚Äôs perspective you just never healed up, and you have a chance of getting slugged
---
Some advice.  All you gotta do is you lose them within your terror radius is take like 10 steps back.  They'll be outside your terror radius at that point and will light up like a Christmas Tree.  Run Monitor &amp; Abuse also helps.  I pair it with Beast of Prey and play him as jumpscare Freddy and play to cut their path off.  Great for mindgames at tall loops and T Walls too.
---
I think map offerings should be secret. Thats it
---
Ah, that's another issue in this sub, the very liberal use of the word "toxic."
---
Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me...
---
To me...
---
But then there'd be less people buying the full dlc. I wanted spirit but I had already gotten most of Adam's perks from the shrine so I would've only bought Spirit.

Thanks, I love playing Fred but the Filter actually gave me a headache once.  This advice will help.

I just wanna say thank you to the Devs for working on console optimization and pushing us closer towards a 60fps reality. I appreciate it, keep up the great work!
---
Enduring got nerfed ?
---
The thing is they‚Äôre never in a chase for those 3 seconds because they hardly get found.  Also hiding in a locker for 6 seconds while the killer leaves isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdisservice,‚Äù I‚Äôm preventing them having to waste time getting another player up from the downed state.
---
At this point I have no clue what to believe. It's a three-way split between the tweet being right, the fog whisperer being right and the whole thing being an intentional leak to hide the real next chapter. They're all just as unlikely as bhvr leaking both Ash and Ghostface, though that one happened so who knows whats right anymore?

Yeah it doesnt stop. DS, Head on, flashlight drops, and only affects pallet stuns.
---
It's because it's the most interactive. It feels like you made a play,when you use it. Balanced landing is stronger, but I use Lithe because it's fun and ends chases instead of extending them.
---
Me too tbh
---
I agree with more or your statement but the problem is the community all feels justified in ‚Äújudging people who are cunts‚Äù so many players consider gameplay mechanics and strategies to be cheap or toxic. I feel like this game may just be doomed to toxicity in its current state. Definitely a way better game then it used to be but it needs a bit of work.
---
&gt; DCs will be easier to deal with once dedicated servers are a thing apparently.
---
which won't be until august they said. You really think people are going to want to keep playing for the next 3 months, much less playing killer when they can't even get through a game without some fragile ego nerd DCing because they got beat? 
---
I know I've stopped playing survivor less because tired of getting screwed by DCers and playing less and less over all because 3 v 1 or 2 v1 as killer isn't much fun either.

Oh you mean what they talked about in the Dev update ? We cant say that just yet. Its not even on the ptb and only talk. Even then i dont find it that bad. How many times per match do you get stunned other than pallets ? Its even a buff if you ask me
---
Pay to win for what? I dont get it. Are they supposed to give blood points in the game pass? That's still pretty negligible seeing as there are already a ton of players with their favorite characters maxed out. It would only matter for new people and tbh it doesnt matter if they buy up all their perks quickly because it still wont make them win. Not when players with 1000s of hours feel like they need to bully new people.
---
eh i have all but thanataphobia. i‚Äôll have to work toward it.
---
Cringe
---
Imagine getting fired this up over a post. What do you want me to tell you, boss? I, much like many other players, will continue to play this game. 
---
Don‚Äôt play the game if you don‚Äôt want to. Lmao.
---
i know exactly what you are taking about, i was confused as well, with all of these people saying to hit lb. You need to start healing, then hit LB/L1
---
as a nurse main i have to disagree, it's like an extra life
---
Can you forget this guy already ? This sub is way too obssessed by him
---
It's pathetic
---
Obviously I don‚Äôt have the numbers so I can‚Äôt be sure about it. Though from my 1.8k hours experience, everytime there‚Äôs two map offerings, survivors‚Äô offering wins.
---
And I do have a vague memory of reading something about survivors‚Äô map offerings having a higher chance than killers, but this was back when there were common and uncommon ones so it could have changed.
---
I see your point just a bit frustrated having to choose between going it alone or having one match per hour. If I want to do survivor. Would you go against swf if they gave you bonus BP for it?
---
found one AMA
---
Like myself, people want to get use out of MoM before the nerf hits.
---
The real answer is that exhaustion no longer recovers while running. Before this change it was the best and everyone ran it even if they had to walk around. It was just way to strong to randomly get it during a chase.
---
Only if you use it like a noob ;)
---
It does help close gaps after you get away with that first gimme. I hate having it against billy and other 1 hitters though
---
shes a lesbian
---
eww no. shes not a pedophile. she can be a lesbian AND kidnap girls
---
If I don‚Äôt see four Dwights, I‚Äôll just dodge the lobby
---
she didnt kidnap the girls to rape them lmfao
---
My favourite is when 3 of the Survivors say ‚ÄúGG‚Äù, but then one guy just spews an entire paragraph of *‚Äúlmao camping baby. had to use NOED to catch me fucking pathetic lmaoooo ez ez‚Äù*
---
Coming from games like COD: black ops 2 for Xbox 360, rainbow six siege, and league of legends, those games make the ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù in this community look like a civil debate in high school.
---
All jokes aside though, I‚Äôve very rarely ran into anyone toxic, the majority of the community is extremely friendly and (for the most part) pretty mature for a gaming community. Honestly this is one of the best gaming communities I‚Äôve been in
---
Same thing happened to me a week ago ! I was the one with the key and the killer was friendly
---
No way he said Clown is the worst. The trapper is complete ass compared to the clown. And Trapper without Ruin? God help you.  Trapper relies on his traps and if the survivors are able to avoid them he sucks and you can dead hard over them. If you can aim clowns bottles he can be quite effective but he is ass at map pressure. I could be wrong since I don‚Äôt play clown much but this is my opinion.
---
Ohhhhh I didn't know that :o then maybe! That's interesting and good to know haha
---
False.  I was killer this round. Killed 2, 2 survived. We all typed this practically at the same time. Felt very strange to have every single player respect one another haha
---
The Hag is slow to start off but she is crazy at gaining momentum. And God help you if she mint rag with MYC. You are honest to God fucked
---
I was thinking more horizontally but maybe vertically for Windows too
---
But Endgame Collapse would be missing
---
sound of my people
---
Ah, Ash in DBD is such a blessing~
---
What about Spirit?
---
I LIKE THE SWORD :0
---
How does the addon work? I have two that i haven't used yet and i wasn't sure if it just meant having unlimited range on triggered traps or if she can teleport without them being triggered.
---
So what if it was 110%?
---
No fuckin way...
---
honestly i think it‚Äôll just be a killer and if we‚Äôre lucky a map.
---
That's awesome
---
Shes not terrifying shes op and annoying as hell to go against... 
---
Terrifying is when a spirit or Myers pulls you off a gen.
---
It would be really interesting. Maybe tweak some other numbers around
---
So what do you propose?
---
Good thing we're **not** all under 18 otherwise Ochido would be here to ask for nudes.
---
 they were bopping your snoot üê∑ UWU
---
I wish I played with neas with a purple flashlight. I remember when I was new to a game they would block every hook with a save in like rank 15. My rank 15 teammates have never flashlight saved me lol.
---
Who knows? There's conflicting info
---
MoM all day everyday!! Best perk for survivors as of right now.. why wouldn't they run it.
---
The weapon is amazing. I think this would be a cool skin, especially if the warning was glowing in her skin. Nice work
---
fair point, but the dlc shouldn‚Äôt have been so rushed to the point where the only positive additions to the game it made were BBQ, Franklin‚Äôs, and a Dwight Face.
---
Honestly after the D strike nerf and before MoM existed, that's what I would call the games best state. Low tier killers could use some buffs but as far as the games history goes, that was as balanced as it could get.
---
All I need for me to come back to this game is better hitbox and people getting punished for rage quit games, been playing since launch but it's hard to spend the little time I have to play games to see people disconnecting in 4 of 5 games I get to play, it's just not fun and totally kills the game for me. Hell, I'd ratter see people suiciding on first hook instead of just plain DC because they missed dead hard, it's ridiculous.
---
I don't know what you think I got fired up over. Just telling you, the game is in a shit state due to DCers and BVHR doesn't want to do anything about it until the late Summer. 
---
Goodie for you if you're going to continue playing. real proud of you, champ. Enjoy your lobby waiting simulator as the wait time gets worse and worse as people leave because they're tired of dealing with IMBA games and BVHR refusing to do anything about it until later‚Ñ¢
---
This idea is subject to change. I am just a fan of the idea that the Nurse shouldn't be able to blink whenever she wants. When I think about it, 110% sounds better honestly.
---
The problem is : they never know if it's a good one or she is just average. They DC right away.
---
These people are dumb as fuck. I had a dude bully the hell out of me last night as killer. I wouldn't have had a big issue to get him but he wanted to flashlight every pallet and it was end game so there wasnt a point in chasing someone else. Afterwards he messaged me to try to make me feel worse so I flat out asked him how many hours he had in the game which he wouldnt disclose. Turns out he had 2100 hours and he thinks it's cute and funny to bully players with 200 hours. Lol. These people are cancerous.
---
Sounds like a good idea
---
ok but he's still bad
---
stating a literal fact isn't "mob mentality" just cuz other people don't deny facts
---
&gt;You literally have one example
---
[Ha](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/198/798/9cf.png)
---
* Bond, Kindred, Aftercare, Empathy, and Token add ons for Keys serve the purpose of showing you where your allies are. These are only useful for a solo player, since a SWF can get these effects for free by communicating effectively.
---
* Crystal Bead and Glass Bead serve to communicate information to your allies. This is useful for solo players, but a SWF can get these for free since with effective communication.
---
* Spine Chill, Premonition, Dark Sense, Blood Amber, Alert, Distortion, and Object of Obsession give one player knowledge about the killer. In a SWF lobby, this means that up to four players have access to this information.
---
* If a solo player finds a Hex, that survivor knows where the hex is. If the killer chases them off, the Hex is still safe for a while. If a member of a SWF finds it, everybody on the team will know where it is, so it's now indefensible.
---
* If Myers sneaks up on a group of solos, each of them will notice one at a time. They'll take a while to get off the gen, likely giving him enough time to stalk to T2. If this same thing happens with a group that are in voice comms, they will all get off the gen the moment one of them notices because they'll start screaming **run run run it's Myers**. Similar deal for any stealth killer.
---
* If Rancor is in play, a solo lobby won't be aware. They won't know their location is revealed, and they might expect the obsession to go for something in the endgame. Not only will a SWF be aware from the first generator, they can capitalize on the information given by the perk.
---
* If a solo player sees Trapper or Hag place a trap, they might not be able to destroy it. If a SWF member sees trapper or Hag place a trap, they can destroy it.
---
* Survivors can run over a Bear Trap without triggering it if it's in the process of being disarmed. This is a tactic that is practically impossible for solos, but it's potentially powerful for SWF.
---
* Adrenaline can be timed if you're in SWF. For solos, Adrenaline plays are down to luck.
---
* If Dying Light is in play, a SWF lobby will know. A lobby of solos won't.
---
* For saves, a solo lobby might send multiple people (or nobody at all) to go for saves since they can't coordinate. A SWF will send 1 person (maybe a second if the first is caught en route), so the gens will keep getting done.
---
Haha legit happened earlier today
---
That's dope!
---
I'm guessing the Black Box skill check debuff still applies through out the game? If not that movement speed nerf seems bleh.
---
I hate these rocks lol the grass always hides the log and I wonder what I'm stuck on.
---
Its going to be a thing. Also enduring is a great precaution perk. I just tanked things and kept going. Nerfing Enduring is bad idea.
---
Not really. Just don‚Äôt waste it; hit it when they‚Äôre about to swing. They HAVE to swing and make you use it if you don‚Äôt waste it
---
Yeah. With freddy you gotta affect his movement speed or people get salty.
---
paulie ester talked about it in a stream
---
Reeeeeepost
---
Tru3 said so, not me. But Tru3 change his mind pretty often. Personally, I think Trapper is the worst killer in the game. Even Tru3 consider Trapper to be also a low tier killer. If you ask Tru3, he will say that Trapper, Wraith, Doctor and Clown are the low tier killers. And Freddy, but sincerely, it doesn't seem like Tru3 actually thinks that Freddy is not that bad after playing him for a bit, but he probably he is afraid to tell this to his fans, because they would get flamed if they find out that Tru3 thinks that others killers are worst than Freddy.
---
But that is just my theory.
---
Not exactly a news article. And like when was this. Like I said the case got appealed late last month.
---
TFW Meg turns into a Hunter.
---
it was when ghostface was leaked
---
Im not sure if you understood what the change was meant to be. It would be a BUFF to the pallet stun recovery and a removal of the other ones
---
To be fair, Freddy has alot of perks as his base power. With the aura reading and such.
---
Agree
---
Meh, who ever gets their first wins, its fine that way,
---
I know im just saying i have more fun when i win
---
This strawman got brought up in the original data thread. 
---
No one is saying Self Care is useless. The problem is that it is overrated by weak players who dont realize they are a hinderance to their team when they constantly fuck off to self heal in a corner several times a game. Many players cant conceptualize playing while injured and rationalize poor decision making as "my teammates are too incompetent to heal me."
---
Its about understanding when its appropriate to self heal and when its not and recognizing being injured isnt a death sentence.
---
having played 1 (one) killer match and a couple hundred as survivor, i can say with certainty from the survivor perspective--the playerbase IS toxic. every single match is full of people who DC on the first hit, farm each other, point each other out to the killer in an attempt to get the hatch, bodyblock each other in doorways, and so much more.
---
Id rather keep it as is. But i dont make these decisions.
---
Mint Rag is a ultra rare add-on. Also, Hag mains get Croquedead get triggered if you talk about Mint Rag, because they think it's a bad add-on for Hag.
---
I love it XD
---
Meh, he wouldn't have made it without the speed boost from the hit anyway. Shit happens I guess.
---
Bruh, trust me, Lv3 Turret was a necessity for the final stage.
---
He cannot play any other game. He caught thunder once playing this because of 12 year old love stupid memes and badly edited video compilations that amke it seem like he is a good player, he knows he wont catch it again in any other game.
---
This format makes me think of this.
---
Trying to save Dwight in basement &gt; Killer is camping in basement with Insidious &gt; Teammates we‚Äôre hiding in Lockers the whole time. &gt; THE KILLER IS LEATHERFACE.
---
You put it in your name, you should expect it.
---
&gt; Bond, Kindred, Aftercare, Empathy, and Token add ons for Keys serve the purpose of showing you where your allies are.
---
And they still do. Good job, SWF will use discord nothing new
---
&gt; If a solo player finds a Hex, that survivor knows where the hex is. If the killer chases them off, the Hex is still safe for a while. If a member of a SWF finds it, everybody on the team will know where it is, so it's now indefensible.
---
Yup SWF will talk to each other and Hexes will get found even by randoms. Nothing new
---
&gt; Spine Chill, Premonition, Dark Sense, Blood Amber, Alert, Distortion, and Object of Obsession give one player knowledge about the killer. In a SWF lobby, this means that up to four players have access to this information.
---
Trying to articulate that knowledge to all of you friends at every second while doing your own shit makes that pretty useless. You think SWF are people getting together trying to come up with strategies and tactics when most of them are just playing casually with their friends.
---
&gt; If Myers sneaks up on a group of solos, each of them will notice one at a time. They'll take a while to get off the gen
---
You mean players will see others running and will look around at their surroundings because a killer is on the loose. This isn't even a SWF issue.
---
&gt; If Rancor is in play, a solo lobby won't be aware. They won't know their location is revealed, and they might expect the obsession to go for something in the endgame. Not only will a SWF be aware from the first generator, they can capitalize on the information given by the perk.
---
See above under the OoO comment
---
&gt; If a solo player sees Trapper or Hag place a trap, they might not be able to destroy it. If a SWF member sees trapper or Hag place a trap, they can destroy it.
---
Sounds good for the trapper or hag because that is a massive waste of time.
---
&gt; Survivors can run over a Bear Trap without triggering it if it's in the process of being disarmed. This is a tactic that is practically impossible for solos, but it's potentially powerful for SWF.
---
Wait wait wait.... Did this come back? I remember this being a tactic in the beginning that everyone would use when you could place traps underneath hooks. Sounds like a glitch if it is happening.
---
&gt; Adrenaline can be timed if you're in SWF. For solos, Adrenaline plays are down to luck.
---
The most rarest occasions will this ever happen. People generally just try to turn generators on as fast as they can.
---
&gt; If Dying Light is in play, a SWF lobby will know. A lobby of solos won't.
---
K, and? They'll know once the obsession is dead and will probably know because the obsession will probably get tunneled whenever found.
---
&gt; For saves, a solo lobby might send multiple people (or nobody at all) to go for saves since they can't coordinate. A SWF will send 1 person (maybe a second if the first is caught en route), so the gens will keep getting done.
---
Literally everything you've said comes down to whether or not the survivor is good or not. No shit SWF has more communication, nothing new.
---
Only with Beads imo
---
The only thing that is annoying about the Nurse are add ons that add more blinks imo
---
The people that do this don't care that it's morally wrong. The only way to fix this problem is to account for people trying to snipe and delaying the stream or not adverting in-game. You can always post your TTV link in the pre-game chat.
---
I play nurse, it's like playing Huntress but you're the hatchet.
---
I wouldn't compare entering someones home to rob them to stream sniping. One of them is an actual crime and causes actual damage. Weird analogy
---
&gt;because you're still knowingly gaining an unfair advantage
---
I mean, the same could be said about voice comms/discord but those are considered pretty much a staple of the game now. 
---
You want to be a walking billboard yelling to the world to come visit your stream? Don't be surprised when people take you up on it.
---
What exactly does being Russian have to do with it being funny or not?
---
Pig Add-Ons need to be changed entirely
---
I think a good transition from nurse would be spirit, she‚Äôs also really high tier and her power is similar to nurse, but she isn‚Äôt game breaking the way nurse can be
---
I do expect it, it's why I mostly play solo and never spectate or use aura perks while streaming. I like to chat with my audience tho so I don't use a delay. However, it still isn't okay to stream snipe even if someone expects you to do it.
---
just kind of ruins it
---
mind game and learn the killers power. If you don't want to watch a guide that's the best i can do for ya. different killers do different things to catch survivors. master the power and you'll catch em. But you have to out smart the survivor. never pick up a killer, use them once, and say they're ass. every killer takes practice. Even freddy can be used optimally, it's just about learning how best to use that particular killer
---
Oh god.. that means you could find it, cloak, and sit on top of it until you see someone running for it and BLAM.
---
I just said that IF you think she kidnapped the girls because she was attracted to them that would make her a pedofile not a lesbian.
---
I was close to making it a Kama, but a big Kama might look weird
---
owo
---
Try Spirit, she'd be the next best thing to Nurse as far as power is concerned, just remember to mindgame at every chance you can.
---
Try Clown or Huntress if you wanna shut down loopers, Hag would also work but you need survivors to go where you got traps set.
---
Getting to rank 1 as a killer in 2016 was actual hell. No bloodlust mechanics, infinite loops and jungle gyms, no exhaustion mechanics, no regenerating hooks, etc.
---
Could you draw the pig or freddy? (I know, I'm gross)
---
A naganata would be cool to see on her. Traditional too

Or they could rewrite all the code, which is a lot of work but not as much as making and selling a new game

The analogy is that just because someone else makes it super easy for you to do it doesn't mean that you should do it or that it's okay to do it. Of course they're not on the same scale or have the same results/consequences, but the idea of "don't do bad thing because it's easy/possible to do it" remains the same.

Lets bot forget when he sexually harassed underage girls

Is this the first time this has happened to you or is the first time you decided to post about it? happens a lot bud people suck, making this post isn't gonna change those invisible asshole clauds and it surely isn't going to give you the pip you probably deserved. but i hope posting this helped you feel a little better
---
Very rarely does a solo escape anyway.
---
imagine playing as leatherface there oh my god
---
I get that but I would like some variety every match or so. I didn't see it often but today I can't go a game with MoM going off and SWFs gen rushing my poor Trapper and Freddy.
---
I think there‚Äôs a channel for german players to find groups on the official discord :)
---
&gt; You really think people are going to want to keep playing for the next 3 months, much less playing killer when they can't even get through a game without some fragile ego nerd DCing because they got beat?
---
Yes?  I don't really care when people DC, I still get points.
---
yeeeaaaa like they're lucky if they get out because if the hatch gets closed it's a free killer for the killer. especially billy
---
Then you have room to complain if you basically paint a flashing neon sign on yourself that says "mori me"
---
That's  actually exactly what I was thinking for the warning. Tbh I just googled demon in traditional Japanese, which is essentially just Chinese, and it was all in this wavy like font so I just did my best to make it like it was cut in with straight lines. There probably a way better characters of letter to put on her, and also a WAY better way to design it
---
It does take the challenge out of the game, which is why I only use comms to talk to friends without mentioning who the killer is, where they are, where I'm at, etc. I play killer half the time so I also encourage not using comms to communicate tactics and whatno, but this thread is specifically about stream sniping.
---
https://mein-mmo.de/dead-by-daylight-disconnect-haertere-strafe/amp/
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is not to give a free escape for the 4th survivor even though it works that way.
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is way for the killer not to be held hostage by that survivor because he got mad for being destroyed and decided to hide.
---
If you put your twitch name in your name while playing a competetive game, all the while you expect and know people to snipe, then im sorry but its your fault.
---
Why so the killers can camp both gens? Sometimes both gens will be super close then there‚Äôs no point in trying... even before endgame as long as 2/5 gens were done the hatch opens. And you can close the dam hatch and can just camp the doors so I don‚Äôt understand why you made this post.
---
And what does it have to do with this thread? This is about survivors using best perks and then complaining that killer does the same. This has nothing to do with you getting facecamped.
---
+ someone with an active detonator to blow up the whole church: downed in basement
---
Me and my friends are all so bad at the game, please let us in a lobby we‚Äôre just playing together for fun
---
No not really.
---
You're not supposed to dead hard out in the open and slam your face into a tree. It's mainly for closing the distance between pallets and windows. Which is really helpful and can save your ass and extend the chase for a really long time. 
---
Dead hard has saved me so many times, even more than DS or Sprint Burst.
---
DC if a gen gets done
---
Could you elaborate on how it ruins it?
---
Poor looping is too complicated to be fixed with quick tips, it depends on what you're doing, but one quick tip I can give is to not give 1 survivor too much of your time.
---
Focus on getting them off of the gens and onto hooks and try to catch them off guard by abruptly switching targets.
---
Learn to use your killer's power effectively to possibly avoid loops completely (surprise hits, instadowns).
---
Remember to not respect pallets against good survivors. Good survivors will always make sure the pallet is going to hit you before dropping it. If you see them doing that, just lunge through it every time. Sometimes you'll get a hit before being stunned, and more importantly you've gotten rid of the pallet (always break it afterward). Chasing survivors through areas where you've broken the pallets already is much easier.
---
I‚Äôm on console and I had the exact same experience! After rank reset I decided to test out other killers and found out I‚Äôm actually complete shit with any other killer lol. I‚Äôve been playing legion since he can kinda ignore defenses too.
---
*TSA will remember that*
---
Good survivors will just cleanse it like they cleanse a Ruin totem. It‚Äôs another garbage totem perk. The survivors you actually would need it against will just outplay it. 
---
That‚Äôs one reason i don‚Äôt use NOED. The other is I‚Äôd rather have a perk that will benefit me all trial rather than the last 10 seconds of the game. The last time I used NOED was like 300 play time hours ago.
---
*this ain‚Äôt it, chief.*
---
Or usernames could be blocked until post game.
---
High turnover, a lot of new people get into it (Its a cheap game on PC, there is nothing quite like it, and has a lot of horror icons in it) but a lot of people take long breaks from the game or quit (Thin skin when facing toxic players, sense of unbalanced gameplay, bugs and crashes, conection problems, get tired of the gameplay and grind, etc).
---
I know people think there‚Äôs a good chance it will be settled, but I haven‚Äôt seen anything about it actually having been settled.
---
No, the community is very much toxic, not as bad as rust, but still toxic af
---
This does not please the eye.
---
The problem here is your opinion isn't the same as his, and that's NEVER allowed!
---
Because it gives you a reason to keep playing when your team is garbage.
---
A person who don't dates Makoto is Nazi
---
*I have no idea what that is*
---
I googled it: thatd be dope dude, with like a shattered wooden hilt, you could even reuse the mori animation, just like adjust her hands 
---
You should draw that man, would look sick
---
Not really necessary tbh
---
So.. People don't continue playing it, is that what it is?
---
That‚Äôs fine but have fun searching for 30 minutes to find the last survivor who‚Äôs hiding in a locker somewhere because they‚Äôre pissed the team got destroyed.
---
It‚Äôs uh, not scary though. You didn‚Äôt even put effort into the outfit, so you‚Äôre literally wearing mommy-did-laundry jeans and a Vans pullover.
---
No shit, anything else you want to say captain obvious? I'm pointing out that what he says is so obvious there is even no point in bringing it out, his post accomplishes nothing. It adds nothing. 
---
Oh, survivors bully killers and then they are surprised when killers run meta perks to stand a chance? What?? Killers tunnel and camp and then survivors run meta perks too? What genius thing you guys want to say next?
---
If he plays while listen the Nier soundtrack I'll merry this guy
---
Wait, you are saying that survivors and killers are both human beings? Say it ain't so!
---
Id rather someone get hatch than waste 20 minutes looking for an immersed claudette
---
I cant be the only one who thinks this guy looks like Ash
---
Censorship isn't as bad as everyone claims it is. This isn't a public platform funded by the government, the first amendment has no bearing here.
---
I agree.
---
Yeah if the Black Box tremendously reduces skill check chances and starts off with all survivors in dream state then the speed nerf is fair.
---
Ok then, let me ask you this. In your entire time streaming, has someone in chat ever pointed out something like "There was a totem back there" or " Hatch is near &lt;X&gt;". ? Because I've seen that occur in nearly every stream. You've probably gained a benefit at some point from having viewers watching that you normally wouldn't have.
---
Ultimately, it comes down to this: You only want the positives of shameless advertising without accepting any of the negatives. A stream delay is your best tool to fight this but you refuse, because you value what the stream/chat benefit you more than the info someone sniping you gains.
---
I don't know what to tell you other than you have the tools to fight snipers and it's easier for you to protect yourself than expect all the complete strangers you go against in DbD to adhere to this moral code you've set out for us here.
---
I preferred the 2.0-2.1 versions of the game. Closest we've come to actual balance.
---
A hatchet cant guard two sides of the map at the same time.  Not like playing huntress at all...
---
1. Whether or not this is a "new" thing doesn't matter. It's still a massive advantage that SWF players have over solos.
---
2. See above.
---
3. I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm not talking about some military coded shit. Literally just "Yo Steve Spine Chill's going off, Wraith's coming time to go" or "Mike OoO is showing me he's going to killer shack, get out".
---
4. 1-2 seconds is enough time to stalk into T2. In a SWF you know exactly what your team is thinking. For solos, they'll spend a second or two thinking "what the hell is that Dwight doing".
---
5. It's really not hard to tell people "Hey killer's at the main building" or "Rancor's on, I'm not saving anybody".
---
6. How on earth is it a good thing for the killer's power to be shut down entirely?
---
7. This was an intentional change.
---
8. For solos, yeah it's rare as hell. In my SWF we're communicating the time until the last gen is done, who is running adrenaline, or whether they should wait to finish the gen.
---
9. A team of solos will **only** know Dying Light is in play once it's too late. A SWF lobby can play to keep the obsession alive, and can better take advantage of the altruism buff.
---
10. Ah yes. Can't come up with an actual counterpoint, so just call me a baby killer. Classy.
---
Honest question, are you guys new to this subreddit? Do you realize every thread that has such a post about one side has a wave of responses "it's the same for the other side hurr durr". Or do you just go around repeating it over and over again?
---
I would change it as to that you can only heal yourself, so you would have to rely on a medkit or self-care to heal yourself.
---
Youre not making any fucking sense dude.Pull your panties out of your ass.You accused him of complaining which he wasn't then accuse me of "pointing out the obvious" then accuse me and him of saying pointless things.If you can't handle replies and other peoples opinions like a grown up don't reply at all jackass.
---
My brain cells died reading this
---
you can't become a better person when you ask young girls for nudes, he was asking for fucking child pornagraphy... He is sick in his head and btw I don't think he ever apologized for it, if he did please send proof because I really think he just ignored it.
---
When I play swf on stream, I tell them to not communicate things like hex/killer locations and use it strictly for just casual friendly banter. Most of the time I am playing killer or solo survivor. And while I do accept that people are going to stream snipe regardless, I do feel the need to point out that it isn't justified in pretty much any situation
---
Lol I love Dwight. His mask is so derpy.
---
The number of survivor streamers who are cunts overwhelms those who are actually nice for this game.  If you are going to advertise, I'm gonna snipe you at least once.  The on stream reaction will determine whether or not it will be every time i face you later.
---
oink oink
---
His fans REALLY want to pretend that never happened.
---
Giving me that side eye.
---
well, nobody would think that anyway
---
*Doin gens you ?*
---
if trump made a rly funny joke, i could find it funny but in a bitter way since he is shitty. you see? someone might do/say something funny but it ruins it if they are shitty
---
It becomes bad for dodging hits, but you can still use it to make it to a pallet/window you otherwise wouldn't.
---
It also still counters Trapper.
---
Okay I‚Äôm done with Ash posts today, I promise. Stay groovy!
---
I really like that weapon,
---
If it was free I‚Äôd be okay with it but I‚Äôm not paying 10 bucks when I already bought the game
---
did you actually just say mics are an unfair advantage? a four man team communicating like a fucking four man team is unfair now? lmfao
---
I've started streaming a series called down with toxicity and I'm hoping to help eliminate stuff like this, sorry ya had to deal with him
---
The perks could be legit, it‚Äôs nice
---
Google steam charts dbd, last time I checked they had some red numbers
---
wrong. you're able to purchase the hollowed blight event skins with auric cells.
---
This dosent really sound like a bad idea
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding you but are you implying Russians are shitty people?
---
I need that sword!
---
For Mint Rag, Hag can look at one of her traps and press ctrl to teleport to it instantly whenever she feels like it (with a cooldown)
---
no, it's about association. if someone is shitty, your brain naturally associate it them with negativity. and my brain automatically associates Russians with negativity
---
What's the source of the picture?
---
Yeah, many get frustrated really early, specially when facing people smurfing or deranking on purpose to stump noobs and feel good about themselves.
---
I can't say I blame them, it happens in most games where there is a progression system and veterans have everythign to help them out while new people have to crawl and endure, it wouldnt be so bad if the ranking system was done better and took into account also playtime and perks used.
---
I play more survivor than killer and hardly ever Hag. The addon in question though is ‚ÄúMint Rag‚Äù and is ultra-rare. She can teleport to any trap on the map, but there is a 15 second cooldown I believe between teleporting. Pretty sure she can only teleport to triggered traps, it would be practically impossible to select a particular trap across the map. So its an unlimited range addon :) You can couple it with the addon that prevents phantasms to appear when triggered, noone will ever be able to tell when or where you teleport, unless obviously they just saw the trap and triggered it.
---
Actually they want non-communicating potatoes, so they can feel great and write GG EZ.
---
:)
---
Why would it be on google play?
---
I‚Äôm not wanting her or the hag. I want to actually chase survivors more or less normally so I can figure out how to deal with the looping. Or is there no general answer and it‚Äôs based on what killer I am playing?
---
killer mains: these survivors are so whiny, they dc the minute they get down or when they see it‚Äôs a nurse!
---
also killer mains: what do you mean lobby dodging isn‚Äôt ok? I wAnT a FaIr GaMe
---
So who else is she supposed be be Lesbi with? most of the female survivors are underage
---
If you can't tell then I'm really tired of hearing this over and over again. I guess you are new here and you have not seen this 500 times over, but it gets really old how tribalistic people are in this game. "Oh, this thing sucks for you survivors? Oh guess what, this kinda sucks for us killers too! You are not the only victims here!" Its almost like there are humans playing on both sides.. it's not a competition who are the biggest victims.   Like, just enjoy the post for once instead of pretending like the post says that one side is the victims and other side is the bullies in general. For example this post here, there is nothing to indicate that the OP believes that killers are being bullied by survivors as a whole and all survivors are having a good time.
---
Haha i'm enjoying em. I've always loved evil dead but only recently started watching the show. Unlimited meme potential lol
---
See imo dbd ranking system is okay, what I don't like is the constant and sometimes unnecessary grind, as a old cs go player with many hours in the game constant Grind kinda turns people off and even though there is high skill cap in cs, people still play it and try to get better
---
People are worried that they will put bloodpoints into it. They are also worried that it's gonna be like most of battle passes. There's a reason why some games market themselves with "No Battlepass!"
---
It IS pay to win. How is it fair that someone who pays gets more rewards to PROGRESS then you do? This game is not fortnite, its not FTP, People have all this shit bc they worked for it.
---
So I put all the perks from purple to red and green to purple.
---
You can download this [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/pdts1iehchqdm3j/Red_Purple_Perks.rar/file).
---
That's the case with PVP. While they haven't said anything officially that I know of, that should be fixed with dedicated servers.
---
I was just tired, literally every other video on my channel has been edited.
---
There will only be very few occasions where I don‚Äôt edit because I hate shitty YouTube videos too, I hate my video that I posted and I would most likely never watch it.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm to lazy to look up guides or watch videos, so I‚Äôm curious if anyone has any quick tips.
---
Dude, if you want to get better at something the best thing to do is to watch and learn from people that are better than you.
---
IF you don't want to fail to learn, then you're stuck. Failing is how we succeed
---
I don't think so. I see this behaviour from both sides. If you have any statistics to back up your opinion you are welcome to show it, otherwise.. nah.
---
The problem isn't that SWF can communicate.
---
The problem is that Solos can't.
---
Until that's fixed, SWF and solos will never be on even footing, so the game can't be balanced.
---
im just gonna laugh at you dude. solo que isnt 4v1. it's 1+1+1+1v1. literally easy mode for killers to go against all solo survivors.
---
Yeah, I think you have a point. This community isn't exactly a care bear convention, but it isn't like Overwatch level bad.
---
I meant to say ‚ÄúNagger.‚Äù
---
Yeah you better be sorry. Somehow I don't think you really are sorry. So take tour fake sorry and shove it somewhere.
---
4-5% higher survival chances on 4 man SWF isn't a problem.
---
Its literally 4-5% different. That's called balanced.
---
I love the salt just as much as the compliments. (I've gotten one compliment.)
---
&gt;wrong. you're able to purchase the hollowed blight event skins with auric cells.
---
Have you misread op's title? 
---
&gt;Has anyone bought the claudette vigo skin(1080 cells) Skin with **Iridescent sharde**
---
I don‚Äôt speak German sorry
---
Contrary to popular belief, people are nice in purple and red ranks. There's sweaty people there obviously but also some chill folks.
---
idk why people stream snipe in the first place if you have to snipe to gain an advantage then your just a bad player
---
Hex: No One Escapes /r/deadbydaylight
---
I mean..its in the meme
---
Dude R6 Siege is ridiculous with the toxic behavior. I think the people here calling everyone toxic just haven't played much else, or this is their first PvP experience and they have really thin skin.
---
How about 2 gens  in one house?
---
It can really help a killer.  
---
Especially if the gate is opened and you have noed. 1 hook and BOOM, they are stuck, freaking out, and its like lambs to slaughter !
---
That's what I've been saying this whole time!!!
---
*Jesus Christ is typing*
---
Game is in a decent state right now, but saying the community isn't toxic is a straight up lie.
---
If you spouted the same shit you can do in this game in any other mainstream title you would get banned within 24 hours. The verbal abuse you get as a killer at average is insane, some people might regard the game as less toxic when they play with their friends but it doesn't change the fact that I have never played a game with a community this fucking salty.
---
pick up on sarcasm friend
---
She just needs her add-ons looked at, take away additional blinks.
---
You can do what you want, I'll keep giving more credence to what the BHVR dev's themselves say.  And I notice you didn't actually answer my question.
---
Instead you brought up solo queue for some reason so good job on that buddy.  Just because apparently you're garbage playing alone doesn't mean everyone else is.  If 4 solo players is "easy mode" for the killers than 4 man SWF + voice comms is "Pwease hold mah hand daddy, I'm scared of a real challenge" mode for survivors.
---
It‚Äôs an incrediblely powerful perk, there‚Äôs no reason not to use it, it‚Äôs like old DS,
---
agreed most people get toxic about certain stuff when they havent understood the frustrations of the opposing side when this game first came out and there were only 3 killer in game i used to play trapper cuz you could place traps underneath people on hooks and didnt relize why people were salty about it until i tried survivor that i relized how stupid it was
---
I don't know how so many survivors seem to fall for this but it gives me good feelies.
---
Gg       :D
---
Ez     &gt;:(
---
I don't really care about points, I've got all perks. I just want to play a real complete match more than once or twice a night.
---
How does someone scream at you for a solid 2 minutes? Haha. 
---
Your first example sounds toxic, but still rare in the grand scheme of things
---
I've always wondered why there weren't ultra rate perks. Some of them definetly fit the criteria
---
I'm a trans dude.
---
NOED rewards killers for losing a match. If a killer is doing well they shouldn't be seeing the gates powered every game or at the very least have the survivors nearly dead by that time.
---
People seem to forget that if the killer is doing well and the survivors are losing, then they are dying as in being wiped out the match. Adrenaline/Hope doesn't become an issue if the killer kills you before gates are powered.
---
MoM on average would activate on the 2nd chase, 3rd chase if you don't heal. If the killer is playing well, you're dead after 3 chases, with the exceptions of the killer dropping the chase (which is the killers own volition) or comboing the perk with other things which should be strong if you're using so much for a tactic to work. With the exception of bodyblocking, which would still be viable after this nerf anyway which is technically the easier/safer way to even get MoM stacks anyway.
---
NOED offers about as much, technically less risk, as any other Hex perk to run, if you're doing good you won't have to worry about it. If you're doing bad it will help you greatly.
---
I personally don't want any of these perks changed, MoM is the first solid survivor perk to come out for a while and to see it nerfed shows how scared the devs are to make survivor perks actually decent again.
---

Because condescension always furthers points üëç
---
Don't respect pallets, lunge through them, learn the mind games, how to moon walk for hiding your red stain at jungle gyms and high walls loops and run something like Enduring + Spirit Fury on 115% speed killers.
---
And also you should learn when to switch targets, if you get looped too much by one survivor, then the gens will get done very fast.
---

---
I'm a purple/red rank killer and play Clown sometimes.
---
Barbecue &amp; Chili/Whispers and Hex: Ruin are staple perks just as they are on most killers. Then, on Clown, Brutal Strength is a better chase perk than Enduring, due to being able to force early pallet drops or secure hits with your bottles, as well as cutting off escape routes with them and then kicking the pallet, the survivor then only being able to make rather limited distance. Fourth perk for me is either Bamboozle or Save The Best For Last, the latter of which being particularly nice on Clown due to being able to throw bottles before hitting someone, denying them optimal pathing or slowing them down and recovering fast enough to capitalize on their unoptimal pathing/slowdown, as well as due to the ability to throw bottles again more quickly after hitting a survivor. Other perk options that I enjoy on Clown are Play With Your Food, which they've fixed for Clown (throwing bottles used to consume tokens, now it doesn't anymore) and which is particularly nice in combination with STBFL, and Fire Up, which makes those bottle-throw-into-pallet-break plays even more effective. So what I'll mostly run looks like this: BBQ/Whispers, Ruin, BS, Bamboozle; BBQ, Ruin/BS, PWYF, STBFL; Ruin, BS, Bamboozle, Fire Up.
---
Ether 15 Vol% + Flask Of Bleach is the best add-on combination, for most builds. Exhaustion add-ons are mean, but currently perhaps too mean to use at all, due to being bugged and applying the status effect permanently. Many of the other add-ons are more or less Quality-of-Life adjustments, with the Gas Area-expanding add-ons seeming kind of underwhelming (on their own or when stacking them they do anyway, and while you could combine them with Ethers or Flask, those are better-paired with each other). Tattoo's Middle Finger is okayish, helping with some mindgames sometimes, but certainly not great. Redhead's Pinky Finger is good, but not nearly Iridescent Head level; Pinky Finger is the Leatherface to Iridescent Head's Billy.
---
If someone DCs in a survivor game I'm in and it's close to the start I just DC as well. Why wouldn't I. They fucked up the game and I'm not gonna hang around out of some sense of obligation especially since there's no penalty. Bring the downvotes etc but we all know this is the logical outcome.
---
BHVR has confirmed that all of the characters in the game are 21+.
---
I gotcha, was confused for a minute there
---
*Record Scratch*
---
Yup. That‚Äôs me. Now you‚Äôre probably wondering how I ended up like this...
---
Someone PLEASE put that on a t-shirt.
---
Its funny how delusional survivors are when it comes to SC, almost like with the old DS. SC is mandatory when you play solo survivor unless you want to carry around a medkit. 
---
The perk was a mistake and its in exactly the same place as Ruin right now, broken but necessary for the meta.
---
There were, but they removed them in an update for some reason (same with brown/common perks)
---
A lot of the people? Toxic as shit. However, there‚Äôs a lot of great people to make up for that! Just like every other community tbh
---
You realize that no one thinks t-bagging isn‚Äôt shitty and toxic right? So if anything Jesus should be loved not hated.
---
Hmm. Odd
---
Bloodpoints? Make it auric cells! With a transaction fee!
---
*CEO logic intensifies*
---
Pinky finger is bugged atm, I would‚Äôve dc‚Äôd too.
---
Hrm. Some digging seems to reveal it was changed so Dying Light obsession isn't supposed to know they're Dying Light until they do an altruistic action. Maybe it was changed back for whatever reason? 
---
Dying Light is very rare it seems nowadays due to the pain of actually getting the obsession dead fast enough vs tunneling him and he loops you for 5 gens. 
---
For Freddy, if it really is true the progress stays the same during the transition, I think it could be a nice way to buff Freddy even though he is being reworked. (Maybe with the rework.)
---
I was always under the impression even though Freddy can't yank you off his totem or generator, he could at *least* start the transition so he could try and slow you down until you're vulnerable to buy some time. 
---
I'm actually a bit pissed if there's no dream state penalty during the transition. Really should be considering the survivor has their arms by their sides usually. It'd at least make him slightly less helpless when a survivor decides to "commit" to the action (Healing, totem breaking, finishing up a gen, etc.) even if all he could do is just slow you down and hope he can hit you/you chicken out before you pop his Ruin.
---
Lol no lie Ill switch to DbD from Overwatch after I've had my fill of toxic ooze for one sitting
---
I had this happen once, when lag kept making me teleport a few feet ahead every so often. teleported through the exit line so they game thought i was still playing. I walked around a bit then "escaped" by trying to re-enter.
---
Watching survivors press their CTRL keys repeatedly isn‚Äôt toxic. If you allow yourself to get tilted by people doing hyperspeed squats then good for you, I guess.
---
I can think of a few streamers that have this mentality, lol.
---
"Doesnt want to do anything" theyve been doing tjungs about it, they are doing more. They cant do more without punishing people who dont dc on purpose with the way lobbies are made now. They arent "refusing to do anything"
---
That's the main reason Freddy is so weak. That transition is nothing besides a downside to his already weak power. His only positive is having the best tracking ability, but that doesnt do much in high ranks. I hope the rework at least places him in mid tier
---
God has left the server
---
Finally, someone that understands the meme
---
I got DBD for free through playstation üíÅ
---
I feel like the map that came with The Plague only has so many lockers because of the Head On perk.
---
Thats because playing against a spirit is a game of chance moat of the time.
---
earlier today i ran the killer around for the last 2 gens and the opening of the exit gate 
---
i got downed and put on a hook right next to the exit gates 
---
the killer didnt have NOED and yet everyone still ran out instead of helping me when i was literally right there and everyone could have survived
---
Well dang
---
They removed them because apparently the algorithm they had coded for it wouldn't give you ultra rare perks. That's what I heard.
---
That‚Äôs fine we can go back and I‚Äôll go back to playing exclusively swf so I don‚Äôt have to get decimated every other match because I have 3 Potato teammates. I‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve had 2-3 gens at 75% and get pushed off by the killer and nothing gets done because the potatoes are either on a hook or looking for ruin because they can‚Äôt hit a skill check. Or option 2 you‚Äôre going to be looking for me forever as I try to finish 2 gens when I‚Äôm last one alive.
---
Censorship in general is a terrible idea because of how very malleable it is as to who and what gets censored.  Frequently censorship hits unintended targets, and the intended targets are left unscathed.  Also, a lot of expression can be taken away from the player which can progressively make it more difficult to say what one wants to say.
---
No, Michael myers. Nuff said
---
that sound terrified me as a child
---
Yeah I agree with this, a consensual filter to chat can be fair to everyone.
---
Survivors don't though.  
---
They keep both items&amp;addons and bloodpoints and they don't depip; what else could you fucking ask for? The only things that get wasted are offerings but they still do their job(i.e. send you to the preferred map/give additional bloodpoints after the trial). Killer's DC only hurts the Killer as they lose everything.
---
All idiots that selfcare in front of teamates deserve to die.  The match ended as it should have.
---
And then they just send a friend request to get you a toxic message or try to get you to join their SWF group so they can talk shit to you.
---
Disconnect should add 10 minutes wait to find a match.
---
&gt;Actually cleanses all the totems
---
&gt;Killer DCs after he hits someone and they don't instantly go down
---
But how can one help being condescending? It's so alluring. Words write themselves out.
---
Fucking NOEr/dbd
---
I disagree. She completely counters loops, with beads or without.
---
Could just say fuck it and no repairing/healing/totem breaking during the transition. 100% speed penalty. I know it's not a huge improvement but at least people can't just sit there as you helplessly watch them finish up a gen or break your totems. 
---
I actually like the transition for mindgames, but there should at least either be the slow, or flat out no "channeled" actions (besides maybe unhooking) during it. You still have to wait, but the survivor's main response will be to run away as they no longer have the advantage of finishing up whatever they were doing.
---
It may be just a bug, but I lose my items and offerings every time a killer DCs, along with the people I'm playing with. We also lose a pip unless we did enough before the killer DCed to earn one. And what food does my offering do if the killer DCs straight away. If I play my only escape cake and the killer DCs 2 seconds into the game, how does that not punish me? I lose my escape cake and earned nothing because the killer decided to quit
---
612 hours and currently rabk 9 due to rank reset plus i stopped playing. I used to be rank 1.

True true
---
Lol this is the most toxic game iv ever played hands down,on console at least.
---
People dont swf to piss off killers, they play it to play with their friends. Yes the infamous 4 man flashlights are a thing but realistically since they nerfed flashlights its great because you can avoid a blind and now you know where someone nearby is as soon as you finish your hook.
---
I think my idea punishes not landing a blink. You have to run around as a no hatchet Huntress for a period of time. In her current state, she can blink as often as she wants so she gets to constantly try to land it.
---
friendly reminder this guy got so mad at being told that telling people to 'get shit on' because he pressed ctrl, that he made this post.
---
also he said tbagging is acceptable if the killer is bad, so good job contradicting yourself
---
Yep just had a match with two DCs and a Ace commiting suppuku on hook. Gave The Ash the hatch because he actually wanted to play the damn game sent him "Groovy" after the match and said gg. I was playing as Freddy which made it sadder. I can't have a single match without someone DCing when I catch them first it's quite sad that people do that against the weakest killer in the game, they need to get dedicated servers our faster so they can actually start working on the rage quiting issue.
---
I feel you.. had a Tapp today who was hiding crouched in a corner at the edge of the map, hoping the killer would find me first so he can escape. I was stupid enough to try finish the last 2 gens on myself. well, I got caught and he t-bagged.. Asshole
---
Even without add-ons, she shits on every other killer in the game(aside from prayer beads Spirit) in my opinion. Her add-ons exacerbate her power but I think she is fundamentally broken. My idea is kind of a bandage fix but it prevents her from just getting to travel through walls and have insane map presence for free.
---
If someone tbags me I don't facecamp them
---
I tbag them back if they're the last one left :)
---
I loved this seen. That show is so goodüò≠
---
I'm surprised we don't have a sack head cosmetic for hillbilly already
---
If he‚Äôs a lagswitcher he deserves the hate but not the racial slurs. Cmon man
---
Even without add-ons she is better than every other killer. That illustrates a lot.
---
So basically say goodbye to when all gens are finished and the killer get one hook and is securing it.
---
Ya no.
---
I lol'ed.
---
Lol I'm saving this literally had me üòÇ I was Myer's to. The Hatemail just kept coming, if your prepared to be a cocky survivor you better now what's in store if your plan backfires
---
30 meters is a bit too far of a range, maybe more like 16/20/24 
---
Also, what would the animation be? Would the survivor throw something at the killer, or would it be more like calling upon the entity to punish the killer for making the game boring?
---
There's a common trait or two Russians share in online games, or so many believe. Including me, to be completely honest.
---
You lose items and bloodpoints if the killer literally pulls the plug/disconnects their PC from the internet; it's a whole new world of retardation and sucks to be you if you have that happen frequently.
---
Daily reminder: Watch Ash vs Evil Dead, it's a good show, and they just added the final season to Netflix
---
Pot kettle
---
It doesnt matter if it's one key getting pressed. What matters are the intentions behind it. People want you to get titled. That's why it happens. I mean if you can ignore then that's cool I guess.
---
This idea is kinda not well thought out. What if the killer is camping Because of exit gates or the survivors are hiding near the hook. If this did get added it could get exploited easily and basically make defending the hook absolutely annoying.
---
Guess were unlucky then. We had just decided it was a bug on the rare occassions we did keep our items
---
DC if a totem gets cleansed
---
I‚Äôm going to edit, I just need sleep.
---
Oh boy I remember when killers used to DC.. How the urntables...
---
As perks you can run a classic M1 build, like : Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury. You can also run something like Brutal Strength or Bamboozle instead of BBQ if you don't have problems with tracking and want more anti loop. 
---
With this build, I recommend  for add-ons Flask of Beach and Solvent Jug/Ether 15 Vol%.
---
Another good build on Clown is :  Ruin, BBQ/Brutal Strength, A Nurse's Calling, Monitor and Abuse and as add-ons Sulphuric Acid Vial and Flask of Beach.
---
What if the killer is chasing someone 30m around the hooked survivor?
---
You know it's shit when you can get a 4k without them doing any gens and still depip
---
And he came back to MK11. And was on a bit of a Mordhau kick.
---
God that show is so good the fact he punched her before makes it funnier
---
The worst is when they sit there on the gen, finish it after being asleep, and adrenaline goes off just as they fall asleep.
---
Censorship in public media, sure. But you are only thinking of blanket censorship in the form of auto chat bans for games, like Siege. There are plenty of examples of better chat filters like with Star Wars Battlefront and Overwatch where it is perfectly fine.
---
With the former, it is user-controlled. The latter is just a chat filter and it is fine. There is nothing wrong with turning a few slurs into asterisks.
---
And I highly doubt that all of the unintended targets are left unscathed. This sounds like another reference to Siege's awful implementation lmao, which no one asked for or promoted.

Just like the DS tsunami before the nerf, people want to do as much as they can with this perk before it's made less broken.
---
DC if a survivor moves
---
NOED, so it‚Äôs kind of karma
---
Oh she‚Äôs beyond broken, if she was made now she wouldn‚Äôt be half as broken as she is,
---
The devs are petrified to touch her in anyway though, the killer community would have a riot, just like survivors did with the exhaustion nerf.
---
Not if all the survivors are trapped in the basement, then end game collapse will never start if I'm informed correctly.

Besides that big bird I'm not spotting anythi-

I had a Dwight on Preschool gather up all chest items and take them down into the boiler room vault area. He then kept vaulting the area to grab Killer's attention. We all get downed, hooked, and killed because Dwight didn't do a damn thing. Post game he was going on about running a store.
---
But why punish the people that stay and play the game.
---
is that a human
---
They've confirmed it'll be fixed once dedicated servers hit. Right now, the game just loses track of SWF once they're placed in a lobby, and they don't have any way to track that without a rewrite.
---
They're working on it
---
They talkes about it in their recent dev update if i'm  correct
---
Thats literally the exact opposite of what I said. I said teabagging is understandable if the killer is shitty in way of tunneling &amp; camping, but bming people at a lower skill level is shitty because it discourages new players from playing a game, one where people frequently complain about wait times in lobbies.
---
Nice reading comprehension though.
---
I know it is the best in terms of sneaking, however, just sneaking in the map wont do much to help the team, I was actually between It and "Technician".
---
It would give you all the rare perks, then the ultra rares. Meaning you needed every very rare perk before you would see a single ultra. So rather than fix the algorithm, they down-graded them all to very rares.
---
Just because you don't look at it doesnt mean that it doesnt exist
---
&gt; doesnt define what way they mean as shitty
---
&gt; gets mad at me for reading comprehension
---
however, judging by the way you constantly use "toxic", it's safe to assume thats not what you meant at all and you're just trying to cover your ass for being toxic yourself. you know the saying, if one person is a dick, then they're the asshole, but if everyones a dick, then you're the asshole? i think that applies to you just fine

I want to believe it, but "If you can't handle people pressing control" mentality runs rampant on this sub.

Oof that joke really done me in

---
Any game can be in its "best state", doesn't necessarily mean it's in a good one.    
---
The exact same could be said for PUBG, from a technical point-of-view.  
---
Doesn't mean it's in a good state.
---
I actually don't use it to just walk around the map crouching. I use urban so when I can hear the heartbeat I just sneak around and hide behind objects. Works really well.
---
FACE ME, SEKIRO!
---
It kills only the obsession OP. It say it in the description.
---
The description of the perk will tell you this. 
---
The generators do not become powered, they are just blocked. 
---
Quite a shame they won‚Äôt do this to noed but they‚Äôll do it to rancor.
---
play however you want and don't let others tell you how to play (but also don't be a scumbag and let your team die if you're mega immersed). i'll admit, Technician isn't that good at all, i'll suggest running Lightweight instead so you can run away from the gen while your scratch marks are already gone and waste a lot of the killer's time searching the area

---
Lol no the hit boxes are broken
---
Auric cells, cosmetics, you forgot charms are gonna be a thing.  Saying ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù in DBD is the stupidest shit ever, you don‚Äôt get an advantage through getting shards through a battlepass either.  And shards can be used to buy DLc characters as well..... and it could use all the support it needs with how buggy the game is sometimes.  I have the majority of dlcs and I get a lot of dailys that use a lot of characters so having a cosmetic on each skin would be cool.  
---
Please don‚Äôt say pay to win because it‚Äôs not like they are gonna put like fucking pre nerf DS in there.  Isn‚Äôt buying DLCs pay to win then?  Cause you get good perks you can‚Äôt get otherwise that are very good except through shards which the chance the perk u want is there is like 1/200 anyways.  
---
So yeah a battlepass would be cool to me.  They already have auric cells which are like vbucks so why not
---
He did, you Just didn't understand his comment correctly
---
David, only because I play a protector build for him. 
---
Certain skins I like can sometimes get the nice treatment. 
---
And those who drop me their item at any point in the match. It is their own little offering. 
---
That is all.
---
"cover my ass" lmao I play fair no matter how bad I get stomped, so yeah getting teabagged when i never camp, tunnel, or fall to other asshole tactics kind of gripes my ass. Likewise, getting teabagged by the last survivor when I smashed their team and they escaped by the skin of their teeth is whack. It doesn't matter your skill or strategy, if people want to be shitty, give you the video game version of the finger, they'll give it to you. So when a game starts and you teabag me behind the first pallet, you can probably expect to get tunneled off the hook. 
---
(And when those exact kind of survivors dc on their first down, I go easy the rest of the game so their team doesn't have to suffer their shitty attitude. If I'm toxic then shiiiit--)
---
How is console right now? It‚Äôs been a long time for me since I‚Äôve played, looking to get back into DbD, but I quit because the fps just got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore.

Covering his bases for content, although i can't imagine he gets many views besides his fanbase that doesn't know about what he did or because to my knowledge he never made a statement about his actions

---
Please tag your post as a shitpost, OP
---
Another "Freddy Buff" (Killer in general buff, but it MAINLY effects Freddy the most) is having killer actions take priority over survivors.
---
Currently if a gen is being worked on, you can't kick it. If a survivor in Dying is being healed, you can't pick him up. It's never really an issue with other killers but with Freddy it is super appearent. 
---
IMHO if a gen is being worked on you should still be able to kick it to block the repair interaction during the animation and maybe make it un-interactable for a second. (As the sparks fly) If a survivor is being healed, you should be able to pick them up and abort the heal so it's at whatever progress it was when you pick the survivor up, etc.
---
Currently if you down a sleeping survivor, and an awake survivor begins healing him, they can get the heal off during the transition and as long as the heal is in progress, you can't pick them up.
---
It's hardly an issue with anyone else but with Freddy it's just super annoying.
---
I've only ever had this happen once, but I had a guy DC before I could get a stack from him, but not 15 seconds later I somehow had all 4 of my stacks.
---
There's an achievement for 3x blinking then grabbing a survivor.
---
As someone who is decent at doctor it only took 3-4 matches since he has built in gen pressure. Adept trappet is another story
---
knowing my luck I'd get caught instantly in those lockers lol
---
"i play fair no matter how bad i get stomped" 
---
that's interesting, considering how in two of your previous posts you say that "im fine playing toxic against toxic people" and "toxic = tunnel... fucking expect it"
---
so no, it's fair to say you're as toxic as everybody else. welcome to reality. you can keep living in your fantasy realm where you're the fairest of them all, or just accept your petty and toxic lol
---
Fengs and Kate. If I get the chance I always give them hatch. Unless they t bagged. If you t bag you get tunneled.
---
Ash because he is Groovy. Everytime I see a Ash I want to spare them so badly but I need blood points.
---
flashlight spamming is what garbage killers use as an excuse to not be able to look up while moving
---
wow so funny man. soo funny
---
I play on Xbox and have been seeing it a ton lately as well (i.e. since right before the Bloodhunt started) and my guess is that since it's been over a month now since Ash was released, more and more players have gotten around to unlocking it as a teachable and have equipped it to the survivors that they actually play.
---
I WANNA CHANGE MY PERKS BUT U DONT BANNED...is there a safe video of someone doing this
---
No it‚Äôs not, I don‚Äôt give a crap about balance I have over 3000 hours in the game most of those are from a year ago. Balance matters but fun should always come first. I‚Äôm a killer main too, but if all you do is buff me then (not a flex) it‚Äôs now too easy to do. I have not lost any games recently. I fought a pretty good squad earlier today but nurse is too strong. I completely missed a guy but hitboxes gave me a hit. I don‚Äôt feel successful and the dudes probably mad about it. Fun? I think not. I forgot to look at a wall once after the pick up Nerf and the dude wasn‚Äôt quite able to reach me with the flashlight. I messed up? Why am I not punished? It‚Äôs stupid. Devs need to revert the game. It‚Äôs horribly balanced. Killer is overpowered. At rank one too btw (again no a flex just saying I‚Äôm not a noob who got it while it‚Äôs free to play) and it‚Äôs too easy. If you got rank one after clown then you‚Äôre not rank one, you‚Äôre more like rank fifteen. Before I had to mindgame to get kills, I had to outplay survivors. Now I just w warrior in rank one and I win at three gens. It‚Äôs just dumb. Not saying pallet to was ok, but they should have stopped there. No other nerfs were needed. Fun is over balance. Killer main and guess what? There‚Äôs four other people in a match, so how come the devs bend wills to the one fifth, the bad, the rank gives that think they‚Äôre good because they got r1 after the nerfs. New killers are boring and unoriginal (besides plague) legion w warrior, clown has no skill involved, spirit is just stupid it‚Äôs not a mindgame if It‚Äôs one hundred percent a guess, standing still? 50/50 if I slide over that pallet or run away/stay. I hope they add some surv buffs to make the game fun again. Now it‚Äôs just getting hit through pallets and fighting proxying hillbillys
---
Flashlight spam to me is clicking it at the killer. just spamming it alot at every moment they can and not using it to save or stun the killer.
---
Not that amazing but it's actually very strong against Freddy. If you blow a gen skill check and Tech procs and prevents the explosion, you still wake up but Freddy gets no loud noise notification so he can't race over to re-sleep you.
---
It wouldn't. The stacks just give bonus BP. I dont think OP was saying you should get an aura reading
---
&gt; The map transformation lasts for 60 seconds before reality returns. However, any Survivors in the Injured or Dying state remain in the Otherworld until they are healed.
---
So, you're a one hit down vs a fast killer you can't do anything about, no stuns, no counters in chase. Sounds great! Pre-nerf Legion was so fun to vs, i'm sure this one would be as well!
---
I cant agree sorry, one of my friends gets a lot of hate comments on Steam, pretty much every 3rd match or so. So i wanted to test it too, just played Hillbilly and got pretty much only 4ks from like rank 20 (didn't play for a while) to rank 8 and didnt get a single comment, my profile is public, the only thing i've gotten we're a few toxic messages in post game chat but thats it
---
My friend who gets spammed with hate comments was also in the same rank (it was after reset) so the only thing different about us we're the playstyles, i usually don't camp, tunnel, down someone when they get farmed and give hatch in rare cases, my friend is tryharding a little more so he "tactically camps/tunnels" sometimes (experinced myself in KillYourFriends)
---
So in conclusion i wouldnt say that if you get hate as a killer that you "deserved it" but, at least for me, not playing like an asshole made me get no comments from assholes :)
---
Don't know about console though, could be different but i would still argue that playing more toxic as killer will get you more toxic reactions in return
---
To be fair, the sentence 
---
&gt; the community is toxic 
---
is just as incorrect as the sentence
---
&gt; the community is not toxic
---
With your build it sounds like it could be decent. As a killer main I use sound a lot. I find almost nobody using technician but it surprises me when people do. With gens that are behind walls instead of going right up to the gen I goto the wall to listen if it's on, If I hear nothing I walk away. I've had someone pop a gen right as I walked away thinking that nobody had touched it. 
---
Personally I'd add lithe instead of we'll make it. You might not be great at chases or looping but lithe is (in my opinion) one of the best chase perks in the game. Make sure you're near a pallet or window when working a gen, if they killer comes over to you go to the pallet/window and prepare to fast vault for 150% movement speed to give yourself way more time to find some where you can vault or loop, or just add a couple extra seconds. It's a matter of opinion and your playstyle.
---
There's a simple solution. Don't be toxic and tbag the killer at the gates. Escape. Don't waste their time.
---
Yeah you know when you kick someone and they go flying back 30 fucking meters. School was tough.
---
A 4-5% difference in winrate is huge.
---
In a moba, a 50% winrate is the ideal. A 55% winrate is a significantly overpowered character, and a 45% winrate means they need buffs.
---
Also, that 5% figure is for the playerbase as a whole. It doesn't differentiate by rank or platform, which is kinda important.
---
I run two solo builds: easy pip build is we'll make it, bt, dh and sc. Escape build is adrenaline, dh, sc and ds.
---
Well I think a lot of survivors hate seeing bbq,ruin and nurses on evey killer...
---
The killer getting a stack means the killer has to try less hard for another hook
---
Wow, never knew that. But now I think that I know how sometimes I automatically could escape his sleep somehow. Thanks for the tip!
---
I make an effort not to camp or tunnel because I understand how unfun it is. Also noed is garbage. I'm so nice to the survivors that I lose games and I'm still treated like shit for it. I'm called a camper and a tunneller when I'm literally focusing on not doing that. All this only happened at ranks 1-4 on Xbox btw. Above that it's fine.
---
Killers also couldn't kick gens.
---
OP, you should really take a step back and think before you post. Look to the right, there's an option to remove the memes.
---
I play on PS4 and it's pretty decent sometimes people disconnect but not every game maybe im lucky idk
---
You forget that most of us have played many other online games. DBD is by far the most toxic I've encountered.
---
This used to annoy me so much. I went afk sometimes because I had to do stuff.
---
Good idea, but not enough. Let‚Äôs also make it so that she doesn‚Äôt have her fatigue drop. Or better yet, not have any fatigue at all. 
---
And also allow her to hit people as she blinks. Never miss a swing ever again!
---
They prefer someone very easy but not annoying like trapper
---
Yea hope they keep balancing it
---
Oh I know it must suck for survivors also seeing the same shit every single day, that's why I play Freddy and trapper so people will have fun. Ruin really isn't that bad tho shouldve said NOED.
---
Lets just leave the nurse alone.
---
Iirc, it was from the show Ghost Adventures, though the image used in it isn't exactly from it, just the text. Here's the [Know Your Meme article](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/eat-my-ass-spirits) about it.
---
He's a chad, don't imply otherwise
---
Play billy, learn his chainsaw. Takes a little while but not nearly as long as nurse. He's my third favorite killer, wraith being first. But you won't win a ton playing him. It's like a 50/50. Legion being my second favorite because he's super fun.
---
Thank you for taking your time to write. I may try to use "Lithe", however, I am such a baby that I avoid having to jump throw windows and vaults as much as I can, but may try doing it some matches to experiment. :V
---
I quit playing for a while just due to toxicity.
---
The spirit is one of the spooky killers that can make me go "OH SHIT" especially when the person puts the add on's that eliminate the sound of her phasing. She be popping out of no where.
---
Satan has joined the server
---
He did make an apology video a month or two ago.
---
just empty threats, reminds me a while back when some random told me they would hack my account because i wouldnt help them with a raid in destiny, i wouldnt worry about it.
---
How in any way does that Punish them?
---
Im sad though because the lobby, and also the smoke effects on the menu and while showing offerings, kill my PS4, the fan gets so loud I'm scared it's gonna overheat and die. I wish matchmaking took less time. DBD is such a unique game.
---
Exciting News
---
"doesn‚Äôt have a way to shut down loops" kek
---
Yeah i could agree on that too my friend told me that even if he didn't camp at all he would get hate comments when hes in red ranks, it wasnt like this before, i was red ranks too but now that they made it harder to get to red ranks there are a lot more really cocky/toxic people, that can't accept losing, in the Red ranks than before.
---
It made me and my friend laugh, lmao.
---
Fell toxic though
---
Same method as changing the UI icons - you shouldn't get banned so long as you do it correctly.
---
How about we also make it so when nurse blinks all survivors in her terror radius gets instantly injured.
---
They really need to find ways to change how progression works. Every chapter we get two new characters and 6 new perks. You need 9 levels per character to get the new perks in third tier and that's around 500k blood points at level 50. Absolutely insane. I'm lucky since I started early and have all killers P3 all perks except legion (Working on it currently). It is so boring especially since I feel like the player base is kinda low currently so more lobby time.
---
Two guys DC'd last night, so the Wraith let me and a Jane player do all the gens and get out. He said he hates DC'ers and how it punishes survivors so heavily. He's an awesome lad and deserves the best in the world.
---
then its a 1/100
---
Look, I'm gonna try one last time to explain this. Using NOED is displacing killer power from the generator phase in favor of killer power in the gate/escape phase. You seem to believe the game is over when the generators are done; the ultimate goal of the survivors is to escape, generators are just a milestone.
---
Sure, we all have the image of the shitty killer that can't put out pressure for shit and uses NOED to crutch it out, swiftly proceeding to proxycamp and prey on altruism. While it's unfortunate that it's mainly used by those kind of players, it's not the only scenario. 
---
As for MoM, I'm not too fussed about it, but it does need some changes; as it stands it just puts M1 killers as a disadvantage while most of the stronger killers can all but ignore it. We want more variety in our games, not to play vs nurse/billy/huntress all day, no matter how fun they may be to vs.
---
More you play the more you get a sense of how things work.
---
I assume you're a newer player so here's a quick tip for vaulting windows, there are 3 types of vaults. slow vault, medium vault, and fast vault. Slow is when you aren't running and vault (this won't active lithe) medium is when you run at the window at an angle, lithe will active but it's a slower vault than fast vault and the killer can easily hit you. Fast vaukt is running straight at the window. Killer has a very small window to hit you, it still can happen but the more you play the more you learn the distance a killer can hit you from and if you should try for the window or not. https://youtu.be/-94Ype1nt5g here's a video on how to fast vault most of the time. Helped me a ton so it should help you too. Have fun.
---
&gt;The killer getting a stack means the killer has to try less hard for another hook
---
But then it still punishes survivors that haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. Gens get done much slower now as the dc‚Äôed person is effectively dead. I mean, if some one dcs at the start of the match, it‚Äôs a huge handicap, but now the killer knows where they are. Factor in certain killers powers like the nurses, Freddy, leatherface, the spirit, hillbilly and some to extent the wraith; its game over.
---
Jason prob won't happen bc of the copyright disputes from the other game
---
Harry Warden from My Bloody Valentine. I would basically only play him if he came to dbd, I want him because he looks badass plus it was one of my favorite movies as a child.
---
4-5% difference is nothing in dbd
---
Mobas are one of the furthest genres from dead by daylight this isn't comparable one bit
---
Dbd is a casual game, its never going to be balanced for the niche higher ranks. It certainly doesn't matter what platform you're on one bit
---
Nice! Wish all players would go for the NOED save! üòÇ
---
Your idea is shit because your Nurse version is literally old Legion without Deep Wounds.
---
Right now, Nurse moves at 96% movement speed. She is slower than survivors, so she needs to use her power all the time to close the gasp between them. Survivors have still time to use Dead Hard or to jump in a locker while blinking or break LOS, they can still do something against her. But with your 110% speed Nurse, she would get so closer by survivors, so her blinks would be completely unavoidable, like Legion Feral Frenzy. 
---
Survivors drop a pallet against Old Legion, he use Frenzy to get the hit. Survivors drop the pallet against your Nurse version, she use her blink to get the hit. The both start to chase survivors with 110% movement speed and then, after their cooldown is gone, they use their powers again to get a second hit and of course survivors could do anything about that. You just remove her map pressure and instead give her an uncounterable power. You know a what sounds to me ? A F*CKING OLD LEGION. 
---
She is would be stronger than him because no Deep Wounds, but old Nurse would still be stronger than her, because your version would not have map pressure. So the only counter for your Nurse would be to gen rush the f*ck out of her, like Old Legion.
---
In the current state of the game, she is fine. When the game will be balanced, she can be nerfed, but right now, she is fine as it is ( even if her add-ons should be reworked ). Your nerf ideas would just revive Old Legion, and nobody wants that.
---
Reading comprehension my guy. Stomping me, getting a 0k, looping me for 5 gens, that's all fair game. Teabagging, loud noise spamming, post game chat flames, that's not being a good gamer, that's being an asshole. I make that clear in these posts too? My fantasy land is having a fun game without people shitting on me for losing because I enjoy gimmick builds and letting 3 mans go more than ranking and getting 4ks. 
---
btw obsessing over this to the point of screencapping a public and easily accessible post for proof is peak sad. At least this post comes from weeks of getting pissed over "its just a ctrl key" mentality.
---
I needed a laugh today. Nice one.
---
Ah, a new Spies from the Shadows buff.
---
I do believe the devs make a strong perk and kill it afterwards as a point to sell the DLC. Since the perk is no longer good, the next survivor dlc may look more tempting.
---
There is a video that tests the audio range reduction of Technicion.
---
It seems to be bugged, or not worth using.
---
I would use it more if the sound range was actually reduced by 8m. 
---
Lithe would be a good replacement. You should think of Exhaustion perks as an emergency in your back pocket. I read that you avoid window vaults, but if you use Lithe, you may see them as your escape!
---
If your obsession DCs, whatever obsession perk you have should receive half of it's stacks
---
Oh, idk like instantly telling the killer your location because some dickhole got caught being a toxic shit. It‚Äôs unfair and depending on your location, team comp and killer used can end the game right there and then.

That pill reading part should be animated and include 4 Claudettes teabagging and flicking their flashlights at the viewer making it impossible to read the text.
---
its all relative, its not toxic to people who dont give a shit, and its really toxic to people who give too much of a shit
---
no, it's not reading comprehension. you can keep saying that, but you say you play fair **no matter what** . sorry, you cant weasel out of this one :^)
---
He wants an aura reading. It would be massively unfair.
---
Well if you only use it to dodge hits and not to loop, then yes. But if you use it in a smart way and have good game sense, then not even close.
---
You do know he's saying adding stacks as in BP stacks, right?
---
I main spirit . I rarely get dcs right away or ever really and I'd say I'm pretty OP with her. If you play easy on them and without ruin they usually stay. Any spirit that camps or uses noed is the real tragedy and I wouldn't blame anyone leaving that crutch. I swear every spirit I play against just tunnels and runs ruin.
---
This is my new favorite thing.
---
They look great. Thanks OP.
---
I'd rather the killer just DC than the survivors.  A survivor DC makes it less fun for the killer and miserable for the other survivors.
---
Shit, I missed that.
---
I like how you look around to see if any of the survivors saw you do that.
---
Pallet Looping
---
You will have less d/cs on average the higher rank you get. If you are still slogging in yellow ranks i feel for you. Yellow rank survivors are still yellow either because they are actually new and don't play as much or they are habitual d/cer's. Oftentimes these d/cers bring rank 3 perks and instaheals but d/c the second they get outplayed, coming up with some convoluted excuse about how the "fucking feng didnt bodyblock for me, loser bitch you suck as survivor kys". I actually recommend playing with swf you can trust until you get to atleast green ranks. Once there, people still will dc but it is far less impactful on the average, because most of the garbage survivors get weeded out at that rank.
---
This happened to me a couple days ago. It confused me. The killer had grabbed another downed survivor and hooked them as well as ‚Äúhooking‚Äù me, but I remained in the grass.
---
How about no?
---
‚ÄúCamping‚Äù is as real as ‚Äúgenrushing‚Äù.
---
Maybe it's just because I play killer, but I get BM messages to groups constantly. There are good people, sure. But there's a lot of toxicity
---
‚ÄúA Stalking oink noise‚Äù
---
SB is just BL but worse
---
Don't know how to change ui icons
---
Bills, they always seem to be the most genuine.
---
Imagine needing to check lockers 
---
*This meme was made by Iron Maiden gang*
---
Definitely agree the game is in its best state since launch but I play both killer and survivor and it‚Äôs got a lot of toxic players.
---
whats this from ?&gt;
---
Oh sweet summer child, how I wish for that to be true
---
Gonna hit you up tomorrow

Well OP. youre a criminal

*Sad Criminal Noises*
---
I was apparently told by a surivivor I grabbed out of a locker that I sniped him but I didn't (I wasn't even aware he was streaming because he had no T.TV name.) He was mad.
---
Regardless though, I don't care if it's "morally incorrect." If you decide to stream, you shouldn't complain about getting sniped. If you can't handle it then don't stream.
---
"how do I turn up the bot difficulty?"
---
Adrenaline gets powered by the hatch closing, which makes no sense.
---
Thank you OP.
---
 I've gotten sick of saying it. The game is so balanced and easy mode right now for both sides. I play perkless unless I'm going for an achievement. The killers are varied enough that there is a play style to suit just about every player out there.
---
Imagine your favourite metal band no longer making music
---
*This meme was also made by Iron Maiden gang*
---
Hmm. How about everyone spawns in the down state. I think thats more fair.
---
If you really did facecamp him, I hope your system DOES crash
---
When you tryna look for cloaked bing bing boi and keepin your eye on the skill checks at the same time
---
Sometimes I wonder if that‚Äôs a blessing or a curse. Still, pre game chat should be a thing. Typing isn‚Äôt super hard on consoles anyway.
---
Yep basically sums it up. Like we get it you want the wazzup mask but stop spamming this sub with it.
---
**Items**
---
Smoke Bomb - A smoke bomb that, when dropped, obscures the killer's vision and removes your scratch marks for a variable amount of time that can be modified by addons.
---
Potion - A mysterious vial of iridescent liquid that gives the user a one-time 5% movement haste status effect for 30 seconds.
---
**Addons**
---
Medkit - Herbal Salve - As a secondary action, cleanse the healing survivor of all negative status effects at the cost of 20% of the medkit charges.
---
Toolbox - Duct Tape - Negates each failed skill check noise notification at the cost of 5% of the toolbox charges.
---
Key - Opal Ring - While channeling the key, leave no scratch marks.
---
Key - Iridescent Ring - While channeling the key within 40m of the Killer, all *other* survivors see the Killer's aura while the killer sees your aura.
---
You won't. It's extremely unlikely.
---
I have a PS4 "group" with just me in it to send screenshots so I can download them on PC easily through website.
---
 I put an image in there around at least once a day, and by the next day? That shit is buried by over 10 groups of people calling me a noob or an asshole
---
Flashlight clicking is the universal message for 'please put me out of my misery'.
---
Blinding the killer at a pallet or window is fair game, just expect to get hit pretty soon because you didn't use the time to run.
---
Diavolo
---
Except they want you to buy auric cells
---
Just pick a killer with 115% movement speed then I guess
---
Nice, now the birds are helping the Killer hook slugged survivors! /s
---
People DC in at least one in three if my games. This isnt even including people who are actually toxic in post game chat.
---
Don't use No Mither. 
---
Just use Resilience but heal yourself to 99, then fully once you get a heartbeat. Much safer. 
---
Prove Thyself is the only perk that helps gens.
---
Preach!!!!!
---
I scored 8700 in a game as the plague Sunday because I forgot that I had formed a lobby and went to go watch GoT.............. 
---
I made a sacrifice due to end game collapse and a greedy point farmer.
---
On one hand I think that could be pretty strong, but on the other we really have to test something to say for sure. That being said I like the overall idea and I‚Äôd love to see pyramid head in the game
---
Your lucky.
---
I can confirm if you're running Dying Light, an obsession DC activates it. You could always try running it with a shroud or something to incorporate a survivor ragequitting into your build.
---
wait a minute 
---
how did a dog do that
---
Nice concept, but I don‚Äôt think the survivors are Vilebloods.
---
Yep, its pretty bad on ps4. What rank are you at because im at green ranks and just about every game the first survivor i down before 1 gen is done [5 gens left] but usually another 2 or 3 fall like dominoes and dc too because one left. I usually let survivors get one gen for every dc or if there is one lone wolf remaining we farm and i let them go.
---
It is actually a bug with the puppet cosmetic. For some reason it makes your beam go more downwards.
---
Wahhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I've been thinking about a pyramid head killer for a while now too. Hes definitely one of my all time favorites, SH is my favorite horror. 
---
I'd love to see him but I dont think it's likely, I just dont see konami giving the ok which is sad. Also I wonder what his backstory would be since it seems the entity chooses killers based on this possible seed of evil in them as a human but idk if SH2 PH was ever human? 
---
I'm really glad you took the time to think of all the powers and perks, they are awesome! Some seem OP but I mean plenty of killers feel that way anyways and are always being tweaked for balance so that's fair!
---
GGWP
---
That‚Äôs why I only play SWF it‚Äôs almost impossible to win games as a solo survivor. Either get hooked and they keep you there till you die so they can do gens or you get caught in the end hooked and they all dip
---
So... for me:
---
OS (C:) &gt; Program Files (x86) &gt;Steam &gt; steamapps &gt; common &gt; Dead by Daylight &gt; DeadByDaylight &gt; Content &gt; UI &gt; Icons &gt; Perks
---
Just simply drag all of the files from the downloaded folder into "Perks" and it should ask you to replace over 100+ items - hit yes and you should be good to go. Back up the folder if you must and also make sure to do this while the game is closed.
---
Amen
---
You don't count the time wasted??
---
Jane, please do Janeeee \o/
---
I fully support this comment and i make an effort to confront everything in my life objectively when it comes to decision but i cannot at this point agree that 1/20 is even close, i am however glad that you dont encounter this as much as others
---
It is 100% safe. EAC doesnt check the files you change
---
If I'm playing survivor and I notice the killer has been chasing for too long (there's like 2 gens left) and everyone is healthy I cleanse totems because I know 95% of the time the killer ain't gonna snowball my whole team unless it is spoonfed to them.
---
Ash, because he‚Äôs Bruce fucking Campbell
---
Killer mains are pure mental, they will face camp and lose the game just so they can face camp a survivor who Tbagged it‚Äôs almost awesome and I love doing it
---
Why? jason has his own game and we have the trapper which is the equivalent of jason..
---
I can see the error, dora explorers community is an utter cesspool
---
&gt;they could rewrite all the code
---
So basically make and sell a new game.
---
Sorry sir I'll delete rn
---
They should make chases shorter and have more focus on escaping the chase rather than prolonging it. Also escaping should be more rewarding and long chases should be less rewarding. I don‚Äôt think anyone particularly likes really long chases and it would make the game more exciting if it was more of a win/lose situation (killer either gets the survivor quickly or the survivor gets away quickly) rather than lose/lose like it is now (killer wastes a ton of time and survivor dies anyways)
---
She‚Äôs deadly ü§£üòç
---
Facecamp = trash
---
It's like a foot and a half forward (horizontally)
---
LMAO
---
But they DC before they even get downed, so before they even have the possibility to be camped or tunneled. And if you DC just because of Ruin, then you are just very bad at the game. You should always expect Ruin in from green ranks and higher.
---
It‚Äôd be really nice with the switch release coming out.
---
The main reason some people encounter extremem toxicity and others encounter it occasionally is timezone and regions, groups of toxic assholes will encounter the same individual more frequently
---
God it sucks being a pleb console player i would definitely use these FeelsBadMan
---
In the dev update they talked about reworking it
---
I more so mean when it's blatantly obvious that you're stream sniping, such as literally messaging in stream chat "sorry for facecamping I really need the Jake mask for Leatherface" while the match is still going, or responding your head yes or no when I suggest to my viewers that they'll probably leave the area once a couple gens start popping.
---
Can I handle stream sniping? Well I'm still streaming Dead by Daylight even if I do have to take extra caution not to reveal any survivor's locations so I would say I can. Am I still going to complain about stream sniping even though I know it's going to occur regardless of whether people care if it's wrong or not? Yes because I know some people don't see it as wrong at first and need a moment to actually think about what they're doing.
---
If only this was true, I‚Äôm trying to dab after I drop a pallet on a killer
---
It varies. I don‚Äôt have too much of an issue but on killers like Doctor there‚Äôs still a noticeable drop. Nurse is still unplayable, but I think that‚Äôll be the case with controller in general.
---
Mettle of Man will be nerfed in the next patch.
---
*inexplicable lion roar*
---
Maple Knight. It's a training wheels addon (Like plaid flannel for Nurse but common rarity) for doc's shock that shows where it'll hit, but you already see the zap anyway so it's pretty useless.
---
IDK what can be changed about it to make it good (probably with a rarity upgrade too) but it just feels super redundant. Like it just is something you use a few times then never again and cry because you have so many and are forced to take them on the bloodweb. 
---
Freddy's Garden Rake, Prototype Claws, and Paint Thinner (Common, Uncommon, Very Rare movement speed addons when you sleep a guy) are kinda shit. It's true there's a penalty when sleeping a dude but it's really short, and AFAIK paint thinner with prototype claws doesn't make you move faster than normal from my testing (maybe it does, I hardly noticed any speed up but paint thinner alone eliminates the speed penalty entirely) so it just feels useless.
---
I'd like Prototype Claws to actually effect Freddy's attack somehow. Maybe a built in sloppy butcher? Paint Thinner could do something like apply aura blindness to the survivor or greatly increase the visual effects of the dream world, effectively throwing the survivors into Silent Hill-esque fog so you can jumpscare them or something.
---
"no matter how bad i get stomped" isn't no matter what, I don't think I'm weaseling out of anything dipshit.
---
The loud bang of the generator wakes you up/startled you awake
---
New player here, been playing for about two weeks now. Here‚Äôs my question-usually when I get hit once and manage to escape I‚Äôll heal myself instead of letting someone else heal me. Bcuz honestly before I had self care anytime I‚Äôd let someone heal me I‚Äôd sit there and watch the killer run towards us, my healer completely unaware that he was coming. This usually followed in me getting downed and my healer getting injured. Nobody wins-so why should I let you heal me? Am I wrong? Thoughts?
---
it is no matter what, also you're being toxic right now, not that i care but it's just proving my point
---
It felt unsportsmanlike, if the survivors absolutely rolled me I shouldn't get to just one shot them all. Sure there are times I wish I used it but eh.
---
Yeah I meant more of like gameplay balance lol but I appreciate the story explanation
---
The thing is that nobody does it for no reason, the person thats tbagging is doing it because they know its the game version of the middle finger. so if tbagging matters to anybody, it matters to the people that do it.
---
This subreddit has made fun of how bad Freddy is for a long time, it makes sense to have failed skill checks wake you up cause they blow up when you do, and when they do it alerts you to their position giving you an advantage. I‚Äôd advise using add ons that allow you to put them in the dream state faster on, always helps me out
---
Awesome. Although the dull machete perk would probably need some other function and something that is affected by perk level
---
Yeah, this is intentionall but the devs are reworking Freddy
---
yeah it's broken with ashy slashy don't use flashlights if you have it
---
all of bubbas add-ons need to be looked at
---
I love Russians I had to live with one and he was awesome super funny guy and drank like nothing could stop him stop giving off this cultural appropriation
---
After the leak more posts were about the wazzup mask rather than the actual leak :/
---
A lot of people dont know the pain that was dbd before 2.0, the renowned vacuum pallet patch. That patch literally made it possible for the M1 killers to get a kill, no, a hit.
---
And put the bonus bp in sacrifice
---
I don‚Äôt need brutality which I can get by doing my fucking job as a killer
---
I want the points for the category I lose from when they dc
---
Yeah, she is üòÅ.
---
I usually report people who dc it‚Äôs listed in the unsportsmanlike category so yea...
---
They added season 3!? Finally!
---
The devs wouldn‚Äôt do such thing, it would ruin the game
---
Kates and Neas, but usually only if they're wearing vanilla skins. Especially if they're not good. Poor Baby Nea needs protecting
---
I usually play with the assumption that Blood Warden is being used. If someone opened the gate(s) when someone was downed, that's your fault and problem. See ya
---
Whatever tard I was just on my smurf smh SWF OP baby survivors
---
You started the aggression. As a wise man once said, no salt without pepper.
---
It really isn't; current molten core charges fast and is spammable, it can be used to clear out detonators and bastions with torb alone (as well as other small fry). Old molten core simply didn't have that kind of damage and didn't charge fast enough to be be able to use it very often.
---
The final stage is mostly a case of sniping the bastions at range then dealing with the OR14s, both ultimates are good at dealing with the OR14s, level 3 turret is far from necessary.
---
But sure keep going around telling people they're fucked just because they have to apply different strategy than what you did.
---
They already asked about it in the survey. It's definitely happening
---
No reason to feel like shit. The perk can be removed from the game and it's not particularly strong if they're smart about it.
---
to be fair he seems to have the least hope and when survivors run out of hope, they become killers.  your comment is canon
---
Yeah I kinda figured. Bummer. We can dream tho
---
Maple Knight: Maybe the area of the shock therapy adds more madness than the static field? Still mostly a beginner tool but can make for fun set ups with High Stimulus Electrode or the tapes.
---
Nightmare Speed add-ons: How about these slow down progression during the Dream Transition? Like Common Gardening Rake = 25%, Uncommon Prototype Claws = 40%, and Very Rare Paint Thinner = 70% as it skips to tremendously. Progress should be halted by default, but this is a good comprimise IMO. Or if you wanna go unique, scoring a Dream Chaser gives different Debuffs. It could be Rake gives a 180 Blindness, Claws give a 60 second Mangled, and Paint Thinner gives a 20 second Hindered penalty of 15%. These would give either a long time of a weaker debuff, a decent time for a decent debuff, or a short time for a strong debuff.
---
Only helps the killer if you don't leave when you should tbf
---
I am lorde
---
Lorde lorde lorde
---
No lemon without lime too.
---
Man looks insane, I‚Äôd have to agree bro
---
There are leaked screenshots of it
---
Just stirring the discussion pot ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Please don‚Äôt eat my ass spirits
---
It was tagged as shitpost, idk what happened. Thx for saying something
---
uhh NOED, Rancor, Devour Hope..?
---
Davids? I like slaughtering Davids. A majority of them hook farm their teammates.
---
I need to know where this is from. It looks like an interesting thing to watch.
---
The thread is pretty much wrapped up and thanks for all the discussion I enjoyed seeing all the opinions and thoughts shared in this thread. (This is the most discussion i've engaged in for a post of mine)My mind had been changed a bit thanks to all the replies i'll update a tier list later if yall intrested.
---
Someone ought to agree with you, so screw it I will. Give me dbd2 electric boogaloo
---
i've actually done Jane, it appears i just forgot to link her! i've updated the comment hehe. and thank you so much! üíú
---
Unless you know they're greedy altruists that have BT or may just insta-save either way. Then they immediately unhook, you get a normal countdown, and they all die for being too altruistic.
---
·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó Gotta make sure you play this video when they do it, too. https://youtu.be/eXBqf4Gfuo0 ·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó
---
Agree, could use a ‚Äúquitter bonus‚Äù like killers get.
---
None. He doesn't fit
---
Yep it's kinda sad people care more about a cosmetic then the killer
---
Honestly I kind of agree that we need DBD2 and that it has to be at least somewhat different, gameplay-wise.  I love DBD, but at this point the gameplay is pretty stale.  And I‚Äôm not against a battlepass either.  I mean, outfits are like $10 a piece now, and I would much rather spend $10 every ‚Äúseason‚Äù on a battlepass and be able to gradually unlock cosmetic stuff.
---
Why doesn‚Äôt he? He has the most interesting story for The Entity‚Äôs desire. You can‚Äôt say he doesn‚Äôt fit because he uses guns either, because Ash uses a chainsaw and Guns.
---
 No rework- they don‚Äôt have any clue how to fix him lol
---
Both Killer disconnects and Survivor disconnects should be punished. Also, I feel like there should be "disconnect compensation." What I mean is a having a slightly larger disconnect bonus, for both sides.
---
Freddy's known to be a bit of a wonky design. He can be effective but he has a lot in his kit that works against itself. A rework has been in the works for him for a long time, and we'll be getting information on it within 2 weeks.
---
It seems to vary from person to person. The player I'm referring to just did the usual basic-bitch "so bad" "pls delete" "uninstall trash" shit-talking post match (keep in mind this was my very first time playing, and playing as the killer at that lol). Other than them I've not run into any.
---
I'd guess the killers who have the most 'bullshit' moves? I've seen threads ragging on the Hag for hooking people and trapping at their feet, I've had players complain that I was 'camping the gen' when they're the ones who kept going back to the exact same gen (of the three that were still available) every time, etc.
---
Glad we're in agreement
---
NO THEY NEED BIKINIS TOO
---
*WHIUAH*
---
EXACTLY
---
A cosmetic not even from Scream lmao
---
I love this
---
We're getting a reveal video within 2 weeks.
---
You should post this to /r/PerkByDaylight/
---
wait what‚Äôs happening i‚Äôm confused
---
Fengs, Neas, und Bills. Bills are like they best I have seen
---
All of them gor counters rofl
---
It got worse the higher I got :( more people getting elitist or didn't want to lose their items so they dc/d.
---
Ash is horror. Mr. Wick is Action. It is different genres. Would you want Rambo or Rocky in the game?
---
There is an option to remove memes
---
But yea if you want what the steam and officialy forums are go ahead
---
These are so good! I think I‚Äôm going to use meg as one or my profile pics. I‚Äôll be sure to have your Twitter linked!
---
cringe culture is dead, shame tbaggers and tunnelers culture is here
---
NOED, chainsaws, frenzy, and pigs dash don't give MoM stacks, although it is very hard to know if they have MoM unless they're ash. What I try to do sometimes (depending on the game) is to just let them go if they get the extra hit, because if they're the last one and heal fully I'll always see them. If they stay injured I can hear them and it's a little easier to catch them off guard.
---
Iirc it's 8 seconds with We'll Make It alone
---
How do you stop rancor?
---
Or the other way around, Imagine a Michael just flossing after he downs you lol
---
But ohms one of those special cases. He has played with seananners, Vanoss, H2O and all of those lot so he gets quite a bit of cross audience from them. Those game channels are more known for random games (Gary's mod, GTA, hand simulator, Uno just whatever takes their fancy)
---
Ohm was the reason I started watching people play dead by daylight and that eventually lead me to monto and the rest.
---
The fact that you have to play a certain killer to counter a perk is mind blowingly stupid, because it's stops people from playing different killers. Wraith, Freddy, all pure M1 killers get fucked over, and there isn't a counter because the perk literally stops the killer from doing their job.
---
This
---
Wdym freddy very op pls nerf
---
&gt;puts ttv in their name
---
HOW DOES HE KNOW WHERE I AM??
---
That would make this game 100000x more enjoyable
---
I like the colors but that would just artificially inflate the costs of the perks in the bloodweb. I guess it is only a couple thousand bloodpoints tho.
---
You‚Äôre gonna have to try harder to troll then that lol
---
I mean its just a game, and if they really wanted the best advantage in game you wouldn't advertise your stream in game or at least in the game the killer is. 
---
I would use a similar analogy as you. The person, that was stream sniped, essentially walked around with money hanging out of his back pockets in a crowded area and was surprised to find his money gone.
---
I saw this group in another post, and on Noob3's video today. Someone find me details, this seems like a story.
---
He was sorta blunt about it but I have to agree. I don't see him being a killer as I just don't see him killing random survivors (and his guns could be used as an attack but have to be balanced like the huntress so that's not a problem). And I also can't see him as a survivor as he's the one that's kicking ass, not the one that's running from an ass kicking himself. You can argue about how his story would fit with the entity's desire but it's about his general perception as he is now as opposed to his backstory. Don't know if any of that made sense but I hope you get what I mean. Basically the TLDR is no one sees him as being a killer (of random innocent people) or a survivor running from someone.
---
We could have the campfire act as the HUD or even a hub for this, which imo would be really cool
---
Because everytime I say "how bad can this 4 man swf be" it allways ends with all of them beeing toxix soo no thanks
---
Get dodged
---
You know the killer has it before it's activated as aura is revealed after each gen
---
Ok but if the killer comes directly to you after the last gen you can‚Äôt do anything.
---
Lmfao a boxer vs someone who kills people with a pencil. Come on now..
---
I wanna know what happened.
---
You dont
---
You hide, wait for someone to open the exit or escape through hatch
---
That easy
---
Then your unlucky, but when 1 gen is left you should be near a safe pallet so you can try to escape.
---
I'd actually say it goes to ohmwrecker. His sub count is 2.1m but he isn't a solely dbd channel although he does have 100+ videos on it and counting plus he twitch streams it a lot.
---
You need a 4k and a double pip.
---
He doesn‚Äôt fit because he‚Äôs not horror. It‚Äôs a horror game and they‚Äôre trying to keep the characters horror related.
---
All these threads and players raging are dumb, dont listen to them mate. What isn‚Äôt actively breaking the game and isn‚Äôt intended by the devs is fine to play with. No matter how scummy, campy, whatever else you play. Remember you can‚Äôt win without taking fun from the other side
---
More like "This guy is either really good at tracking, lucky, or stream sniping"
---
Ah, a fellow Pig of culture I see
---
But he killed random people once upon a time. Yes for payment, but it‚Äôs technically payment from the entity. We‚Äôre not talking about John Wick and who he‚Äôs become. We‚Äôre talking about him paying for his sins.
---
If this is a shitpost, nice, but Legion is not weak. He has amazing walking speed, Frenzy is mostly used to add-on to his arsenal rather than being his primary, and with the changes to perks and add-ons [such as Thantaphobia], Legion is definitely a great killer. He's not as good as Nurse or Billy, but he's way better than he was before.
---
That sucks. Sounds like you are having a rough time. Maybe everyone is dc'ing so much on you because dedicated servers are coming, hopefully very soon, and that dc'ing will be punished the way it always should have been, with timeouts and possibly lengthy bans.
---
Yeah awhile ago
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
It should be multiplicative. 10 minutes for first, 30 for second, 90 for third.
---
Imagine asking for a sequel made by the same devs who cant make a lobby system and thinking things will be better
---
ebin
---
But...why?
---
That‚Äôs not the question.  Though he‚Äôs not horror we‚Äôre talking about a story line. This isn‚Äôt a post to get him in the game. It‚Äôs a post just thinking about who this Character could be in the world of The Entity.
---
Quitter bonus should be higher for killers, a measly 600 bp, c'mon. And survivors should get the same thing, maybe even more
---
I just finished the show but still need to watch the movies. We need more Ash/Evil Dead memes!
---
Remember when 99.99% of the dothraki died like 2 episodes ago?
---
Laurie's got me! Lol
---
a 3v1 is a terrible idea
---
Soo that intro put me off the video, that font and claudette were unecessary
---
Anyways there were some enjoyable moments in the video, which should be shown instead of showing all the boring stuff, you know what I mean
---
Its better to have 5 minutes of interesting gameplay, instead of 10 minutes of gameplay with some funny parts
---
I would also recomending adding some low hearing music just to help with the videos
---
Anyways I hope you take whatever you want from this comment and good luck!
---
This is what the killer sees when she uses object of obsession. Really nice art! Which of the guys are you going to do first?
---
Balanced is best- change my mind
---
Sounds like a logical gameplay balance to me
---
Dc should have a punishment but that‚Äôs just a thought
---
I‚Äôm a simple man; I see Pyramid Head, I upvote (also helps this concept is quite intriguing).
---
It's been stated 100 times in this thread, but if you use Dead Hard to dodge a hit then it's already a useless perk lol.
---
People need to stop underrating Sprint Burst btw, it kind of does what Dead Hard does except it requires no thought. Sprint Burst and run to the Wretched Shop \^.\^ who needs to Dead Hard to a jungle gym in order to make it when you can just run there.
---
Please don't run Sprint Burst and play that way btw :(
---
Somebody just had a bad game as legion
---
What show!?
---
Weird, I only saw the first two on there. Maybe it's not on Canadian Netflix yet?

I see your point but it has flaws as most tier lists are judged mostly off base powers, which Freddy is weak on. But i mean if addons were taken in to account then i guess Myers would be the best since he had a built in mori lol, not much counterplay.
---
I‚Äôll have to try that next time. I never really saw a prompt to cancel and nothing ever seemed to cancel it.
---
Honestly lol

Huh idk

I realized that a while ago but I still do it as a way to say frick you

Make rule set 2 default and give amanda a ultra add on that removes the roar completly like wraiths coxcomb add on.
---
Think of it this way - you've just lost a game of basketball or something and the other player comes over and spits in your face. That's what tbagging is, it's more than just pressing the ctrl button
---
They said that it will have it's gameplay revealed in the upcoming 2 weeks, probably next tuesday
---
Well according to those statistics that were released recently, swf has a +6% or so chance of winning more than a group of solos. Killers just don't like those odds.
---
I'm a console player so I doubt it's the ones in noob's video lol

@Fuskaka why does everyone say that a battlepass would be so bad! If you don‚Äôt want it, don‚Äôt buy it. You wanna spend $10 dollars on one skin or do you wanna spend $10 dollars for several other things. It Wouldn‚Äôt ruin the game. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs adding cosmetics that make you invisible

survivor dcs should count as bbq stacks, full sacrifice points, and disallow them to join a match for ten minutes. killer dcs should count as full escape+power exit gate points and disallow them to create a match for ten minutes. we really need this implemented
---
When a survivor D/Cs on their first down before you can hook them, you can‚Äôt get the 25% BP bonus. It sucks for everyone when they do this.
---
For more PLEASURE
---
Hey, I know, sabotage it the instant it activates, never just leave like a bitch once someone goes down. But as a Killer ? Nah-ah, huge "nah-ah" for me. I can use that slot for something much more fun, useful or simply BP-boosting.
---
The *only* time I use it anymore is for end game builds (I‚Äôm thinking of Freddy, specifically‚Äîcombine it with BW and RM, and it‚Äôs downright dirty). Beyond that, I developed bad habits running it; plus, it feels cheap and I fucking hate going against it (to the point if I‚Äôm solo, I‚Äôll run Small Game to ensure the killer can‚Äôt use it).
---
Jesus.
---
I always look around when doing Gens when I know he's the killer. The moment I see white face, I'm GONE.
---
My point. Wick is too OP lore wise. Ash fits because he is horror, you know ordinary people.  It would be like adding in Agent 47

gotta vault fast

Just press what ever buttton is is to run, it cancels it üëçüèª

Dude imagine battle pass exclusive Nea cosmetic if players are toxic already!! It would make the game even more competitive and just ‚Äúanother battle pass game‚Äù.. also I can‚Äôt thing what I would want in a dnd battle pass, I mean, there would only be skins right?
---
Solid, thanks dude
---
Yeah I realized that too. Honestly I wouldn't mind if the "Survivor locations being revealed" remained gen powered only, but the actual Exposed + Mori was changed to the exit gates being powered. 
---
I mean if you actually save the obsession for last so you could Mori them for shits and giggles I don't see that being any more "Evil" than running NOED, considering NOED activates when the hatch is closed and effects all survivors, while Rancor is obsession only.
